[time=30] [SILENCE]
[time=41] [MUSIC]
[time=50] >> This is the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=53] Thank you for joining us.
[time=55] Have you ever noticed that having a meaningful relationship with some people is almost impossible?
[time=59] No matter how hard you try, there always seems to be major conflict and they always blame it on you.
[time=65] Stay with us today as we describe what it means to love hard to love people.
[time=69] Now let's join our service.
[time=71] [MUSIC]
[time=79] >> This day is fragile.
[time=83] Soon it will end.
[time=87] And once it has vanished, it will not come again.
[time=97] So let us love with a love pure and strong
[time=106] before this day is gone.
[time=122] This day is fleeting when it slips away.
[time=131] Not all our money can buy back this day.
[time=140] So let us pray that we might be a friend
[time=150] before this day is spent.
[time=165] Then it's cold and let us show love.
[time=178] This day is ours for one moment.
[time=187] Let us show love.
[time=198] This day is frail.
[time=203] It will pass by.
[time=208] So before it's too late to determine the time,
[time=218] let us share love.
[time=223] Let us share God before this day.
[time=234] This day is gone.
[time=244] [MUSIC]
[time=267] >> Now remember, we can't stay.
[time=269] We'll just drop off the apples and go.
[time=271] >> So this must be your favorite.
[time=275] >> She's okay.
[time=276] She's just a little different.
[time=279] Just be nice.
[time=280] We'll keep it short but sweet.
[time=282] I haven't seen her since the divorce.
[time=289] >> Julie?
[time=290] >> Julie, it's so good to see you.
[time=294] Oh, come on, come on.
[time=296] Oh, let me look at you.
[time=299] Oh, would you look at that?
[time=302] I'm so glad you stopped by the CV.
[time=305] It's good to see you too, Aunt Lorraine.
[time=309] Oh, this is my husband, David.
[time=312] >> Hello.
[time=313] >> Oh, hello there, David.
[time=316] Well, I'm not saying he's a lot better looking than Randall.
[time=320] Oh, and I'm so sorry.
[time=322] I couldn't make it to your wedding.
[time=324] But I'm sure with your track record, I'll have other opportunities.
[time=329] I just wasn't feeling very well that day.
[time=332] I'll have diabetes.
[time=334] >> And so does my mom.
[time=336] >> Well, I have type I diabetes, the most severe kind.
[time=340] I'm insulin dependent, and I have to watch my diet very closely.
[time=345] And even when I do, sometimes I still feel lightheaded and shaky.
[time=350] All I can do is just drink some juice and lie down and wait until it goes away.
[time=355] Well, Julie knows it can happen any time.
[time=358] My blood sugar could spike high or low for weeks on end.
[time=363] Even the doctor can't regulate it.
[time=366] Well, we would just-- >> You know, I was a new kind of insulin that doctors using me as a guinea pig.
[time=373] I told him that was fine with me.
[time=376] I'll try anything to help regulate these swings.
[time=380] >> Well, is it helping?
[time=382] >> Well, now that's hard to say.
[time=385] Sometimes I think I feel better, but well then like today, I was feeling extra tired.
[time=392] Well, come on over here and sit down.
[time=394] Come on, sit, sit.
[time=396] Now, Pat, I'm going to put you on mute and you just keep right on playing, Vanna.
[time=401] We really can't stay at Lorraine.
[time=404] >> See, diabetes affects your feet.
[time=407] >> So I've heard it.
[time=408] >> Yeah, poor circulation.
[time=412] Someday they'll have to amputate.
[time=415] It happens all the time to us diabetics.
[time=420] >> Well, mom says to say hi.
[time=423] We were over there for dinner tonight and she wanted us to bring by these apples.
[time=427] They're from the tree in the backyard.
[time=429] It was another bumper crop again this year.
[time=433] >> You can eat apples, can't you?
[time=437] >> Plaster of Paris, France.
[time=439] Oh, come on, Susan.
[time=441] Solve the puzzle.
[time=443] Plaster of Paris, France.
[time=445] That's an easy one.
[time=448] >> You like wheel of fortune, Lorraine?
[time=451] >> Oh, yes, yes.
[time=453] I know, especially like the before and after puzzles.
[time=456] You see, something comes before and after the word Paris.
[time=461] >> Wow, how did you get that so fast?
[time=465] Is Vanna pregnant again?
[time=467] >> Oh, no, no, no.
[time=469] She's already had the baby.
[time=470] This is a rerun.
[time=471] >> Well, we just want to drop off these apples.
[time=475] >> Apples.
[time=476] >> Are they from your mother's tree?
[time=478] >> Yeah.
[time=479] It was another bumper crop again this year.
[time=482] >> Well, hopefully the swelling will go down in my gums.
[time=490] And then I can eat these apples before they go rotten.
[time=493] Your mother must have forgot.
[time=495] You see, my gums have been inflamed ever since I went to the dentist for a cleaning.
[time=501] I must have had a reaction to that stuff they used to make your teeth shiny.
[time=506] I'm allergic to everything.
[time=508] I'm allergic to toothpaste, too, you know.
[time=511] Oh, by the way, how is your mother's earlobe?
[time=514] >> Her earlobe.
[time=516] >> Well, yeah, I talked to her last week and she said something about an infection from a cheap earring.
[time=524] >> Well, I don't know.
[time=525] It must have cleared up because when David and I were over there tonight for dinner, she didn't mention it.
[time=530] Did she, David?
[time=532] >> Something rainforest.
[time=534] >> Tropical rainforest.
[time=538] >> You know what they should have said.
[time=540] This is a tropical rainforest dump.
[time=548] >> But the category wasn't before and after.
[time=551] It was place.
[time=553] Tropical rainforest is a place.
[time=556] >> Yeah.
[time=557] Well, it's probably about time we get going.
[time=561] >> Yes, we really need to go.
[time=563] We have some wedding gifts to return at them all before it closes.
[time=566] >> Oh, and I had something all picked out for you, too.
[time=570] I was just waiting for a day when I felt better to go get it.
[time=574] >> Don't worry about it, Aunt Lorraine.
[time=575] You just get well.
[time=577] >> Well, we'll see about that.
[time=580] >> You know, diabetes is degenerative and there is no cure.
[time=586] Oh, sugar was candy before you go.
[time=590] >> Well, okay.
[time=593] Well, goodbye.
[time=594] >> Goodbye, Julie.
[time=596] >> It was nice meeting you and hope you feel better.
[time=600] >> Yeah, well, I'm doing the best I can taking care of myself.
[time=606] It's hard when you live all alone and have what I have.
[time=613] >> Well, I'm sorry, but my mother lives by herself and has what she has, but she doesn't spend all day sitting around TV watching Wheel of Fortune.
[time=621] >> Well, I noticed you were getting-- you were getting into it yourself.
[time=625] >> I was just trying to identify with her.
[time=627] She didn't even care about us.
[time=629] She never asked how you were doing.
[time=631] Didn't know me from Forrest Gump.
[time=634] >> Well, I said she was a little different.
[time=636] She has a few quirks.
[time=639] >> A few quirks.
[time=641] Jules, I think she's already gone over the deep end.
[time=643] >> Well, maybe she has a reason.
[time=646] >> Like what?
[time=649] >> Her husband and daughter were killed 18 years ago in a car accident, leaving her all alone.
[time=659] >> Wow.
[time=668] What do you think it would mean for that couple to be humble and gentle and patient bearing there with Aunt Lorraine in love?
[time=681] What would that look like?
[time=683] If they were going to try to pursue her, if they were going to try to have involvement with her, what would it look like for them to be humble and gentle and patient bearing with?
[time=692] You know, sometimes I think because our view of Christianity is a little too trivial at times, a little too pat, a little too beneficial, we could almost assume that for them to be gentle and humble and patient bearing in love would mean, you know, if they really loved her, they'd go back time and time again.
[time=712] They'd be there often.
[time=714] They'd kind of endure the treatment that they received there.
[time=718] They would pray for her.
[time=721] All too often that is lifted up as the epitome of Christian love.
[time=727] What happens is instead of that, which I don't think is Christian love at all, instead of that, they walk out the door and do what began to happen when Tim expressed the hurt and that came out as anger and his gossip and the commitment that was implied to stay away from her.
[time=742] And maybe we could season that a little bit with an understanding of why she's that way and cause a moment of pause, but we still don't know what it means.
[time=751] We still have no idea what it means to love that woman.
[time=756] If you have your Bibles with you this morning, open them to Romans 12 and we'll continue our study in this little series called Love of Another Kind.
[time=768] Love of Another Kind and the section we're going to study today is verses 14 to 21 and there's a summary statement at the end of this section of Scripture that says, "Do not be overcome with evil, but overcome evil with good." There's no question in my mind that Aunt Lorraine, you can call them quirks.
[time=788] Her behavior was evil.
[time=792] She's selfish.
[time=794] She's self-absorbed.
[time=795] She's dominating.
[time=797] She has absolutely no interest in other people.
[time=800] Her behavior was characteristically evil.
[time=805] And to call it a quirk and to wash it away with some kind of empathy about what might have happened in her past, in my mind is a great breach of what it would mean to express a bold love to dear Aunt Lorraine.
[time=821] The question I want to pose to you this morning is what does it mean not to be overcome by evil?
[time=827] In my opinion, we as a Christian community are overcome by evil when we take either the approach to passively sit and patiently wait and listen and endure the abuse and go back and back again and then pat ourselves on the shoulder that we have somehow loved Aunt Lorraine.
[time=841] To me, that's being overcome by evil.
[time=844] So is the other thing that might happen is you walk out the door and gossip about her and express your anger and make a commitment never to be in her presence again unless you absolutely have to.
[time=853] That is what it means to be overcome by evil.
[time=855] But what does it mean to overcome evil with good?
[time=860] What would a bold, powerful, God-empowered love look like coming from this couple to a woman who is so selfish and so self-absorbed and so committed to herself that she doesn't give a rip about anybody else?
[time=873] What would a bold love really look like in her life?
[time=877] What does it mean for an adult daughter to love her mother who in every phone call finds some way to assail her daughter's wisdom and integrity?
[time=887] Seems like every time they're on the phone that mother finds some avenue and some way to assail her daughter's wisdom was a bold love look like.
[time=895] What does bold love look like for a woman to love her demanding
[time=902] friend who calls on the phone and says, "I can't find anybody else to babysit and I just have to get to the store before the sale ends." It won't be a problem if I drop my kids off for the afternoon, will it?
[time=915] I mean, how does a God-fearing Christ-honoring believer respond
[time=922] to that kind of woman's request?
[time=924] What does a bold love look like?
[time=927] What does it mean for a businessman to express bold love to an employee who is defrauded in his business?
[time=933] What does it mean for a wife to express bold love to her husband when she has just caught him in an affair?
[time=939] What does it mean to love your enemy?
[time=941] What does it mean to love the one who sexually abused you?
[time=944] To love your spouse who is angry and insensitive.
[time=947] To love a friend who gossiped behind your back and damaged your reputation.
[time=951] To love a child who snarls at the offer to go for a walk.
[time=954] To love a surgeon or a service station mechanic who failed to act in your best interest.
[time=959] What does this Christian love mean in these kinds of contexts?
[time=964] Bold love, love of another kind.
[time=968] Bold love of an enemy involves courageously moving toward that person with their well-being in mind willing to risk further pain in order to call them to be a person of love and integrity.
[time=982] Let me say that again.
[time=984] I believe that a biblical bold love of a person like Aunt Lorraine or any of the others we've described already this morning involves courageously moving toward her with her well-being in mind willing to risk further pain in order to call her to be a person of love and integrity.
[time=1005] As you know, this series entitled Love of Another Kind began some weeks ago with the supremacy of love saying that love is the highest calling on our life.
[time=1012] It's the highest virtue lifted up in all the Word of God.
[time=1014] We are nothing if we do not love.
[time=1017] We discovered the next week that we have been loved by a love that is greater than any other love.
[time=1022] It is the love that Jesus Christ has for us seeing us helpless and ungodly and sinful.
[time=1027] And without any resources to change our condition gave his life away for us.
[time=1031] We saw last week a bold love, an unhypical love that is found in verse 9
[time=1038] that love would be without hypocrisy, not some type of superficial, mamsi-pamsi socially acceptable way of relating with people, but a true genuine life-changing love that comes from deep somewhere inside
[time=1054] your soul for another human being.
[time=1057] And last week the focus of Paul's definition of this kind of bold love focused mainly on family members and friends who are in the body of Christ.
[time=1067] While the theme remains the same, what does an unhypical love look like, the people we are called to love are described in verse 14 as those who persecute us.
[time=1078] They are the persecuting ones.
[time=1080] How do we love people who harm and damage us?
[time=1084] The word persecute in the Greek.
[time=1086] Diokko means to pursue someone with the intent of doing them harm.
[time=1091] How are you and I to love someone who pursues us with the intent of doing us harm?
[time=1097] Later on you'll see in verse 20 they are described as our enemy, and in verse 21 as we've already noted they are evil.
[time=1104] I am evil, you are evil.
[time=1106] As a believer we're righteous and clothed in the righteousness of God, but evil resides and we are capable of evil.
[time=1112] Now we are capable of pursuing other people with the intent of doing them harm.
[time=1118] My question is what does it mean to love?
[time=1121] What does it mean to forgive and what does it mean to do good to someone who has hurt you?
[time=1126] Now in the culture, the day, the time, the circumstances in which this book was written, Paul wasn't talking about anything short of his enemies and enemies of Christianity.
[time=1136] It was called martyrdom, it was called putting Christians to death.
[time=1140] They would tie them in animal skins and then throw them into the arena and let them be ravaged by lions and tigers and bears.
[time=1147] The kind of pursuing to do harm meant martyrdom, or it would mean imprisonment where people for no justifiable reason.
[time=1153] Christians were locked up inside of prisons and separated from their families.
[time=1158] The kind of harm that was being done in this day was the confiscation of personal belongings where you're wealth and you're home and sometimes your wife and your kids are taken away from you unjustly and without cause just simply because you were a Christian.
[time=1173] The kind of harm that was being done to these people was ostracism on a more mild manner.
[time=1177] If it wasn't martyrdom or imprisonment or confiscation of goods on the more mild but still severe side of the spectrum, there was social ostracization.
[time=1186] And you couldn't even function as a business person.
[time=1189] You couldn't function as a woman in the marketplace.
[time=1191] You couldn't associate with people because they shunned you and they put you out of their society.
[time=1195] Well what is in that kind in the face of that kind of persecution,
[time=1203] what does Paul say is the way to express bold love?
[time=1209] Well we're not going to go real deep into this passage this morning, but I want to explain what I think Paul is saying here.
[time=1216] And I want to give you just briefly five components of what it means to boldly love your enemy.
[time=1221] Five components of what it means to boldly love your enemy.
[time=1225] In verse 14 it says this, he begins the section on loving your enemy by saying this, "Bless those who persecute you, bless and curse not." There is something in the dynamic that goes on with in your relationship with the one who pursues you for harm
[time=1241] that involves you saying some things.
[time=1243] A blessing is something that you say.
[time=1245] It's a verbal component.
[time=1247] And a blessing is to invoke God's involvement in another person's life.
[time=1251] It is not have a nice day.
[time=1253] It is not a trite expression of I forgive you.
[time=1255] It is not some glib comment that gets you out of the situation.
[time=1259] To bless someone is to call upon God's involvement in that person's life to bring that person into conformity to Christ.
[time=1266] A true blessing is using the power of your words to invoke God's involvement in their life
[time=1272] in a meaningful way that will bring about change for the better.
[time=1276] He says in verse 15, a second component, "Rejoice with those who rejoice and weep with those who weep."
[time=1284] There is an emotional component that is implied when you boldly love your enemy.
[time=1290] And you see, if this was taken out of context, and sometimes it is used in other contexts, namely with other believers, but here it is clearly in the context of how you feel about your enemy.
[time=1300] And the scripture is saying that when your enemy is doing well, rejoice.
[time=1304] And when your enemy is doing poorly weep, in other words, never so harden your heart and never so allow the anger that you feel in your heart for the enemy who has hurt you that you lose all emotional contact with them.
[time=1317] This is an astounding call by God.
[time=1320] Even in the face of the adversary, we are to maintain a level of compassion and empathy for the one who is doing us harm as you saw displayed at the end of the drama as Tim finally learned that this woman had lost some beloved in her past.
[time=1335] And there was an emotional connection. That is true. That is godly. That is how it is always to be.
[time=1341] A third component surfaces in verse 16. We have the same mind toward one another.
[time=1346] Do not be haughty in mind, but associate with the lowly. Do not be wise in your own estimation.
[time=1352] And this is what I call the mental component. There is a certain way to think about your enemy.
[time=1356] There is a certain way to appraise your enemy. And what it is saying is this.
[time=1361] Do not for a moment think more highly of yourself and think less of your enemy than you ought to.
[time=1367] You are as much a sinner in need of the grace of God as is your enemy.
[time=1372] And the moment you begin to think more highly of yourself and be wise in your own estimation and fail to associate with the lowly, in this case the spiritually lowly who would be attacking you,
[time=1382] when you fail to think and maintain the reality that you are in as much need of grace as is that person hurting you,
[time=1389] you will never love without that component.
[time=1392] Sadam Hussein is as much a sinner and deserving of hell as I am.
[time=1398] And I am as much a sinner and deserving of hell as he is.
[time=1402] Now he may have murdered some people and I have not done that.
[time=1404] But when you compare his unrighteousness and my unrighteousness against the holy standard of God, we both fall immeasurably short.
[time=1412] And boldly loving your enemy includes a commitment to remember that reality and never differentiate yourself as somehow less of a sinner.
[time=1422] Number four, comes up in verses 17 to 19.
[time=1426] Never pay back evil for evil to anyone.
[time=1428] Respect what is right in the sight of all men.
[time=1431] If possible so far as it depends on you, be at peace with all men.
[time=1434] Now listen verse 19, "Never take your own revenge beloved, but leave room for the wrath of God.
[time=1440] For it is written, vengeance is mine.
[time=1443] I will repay," says the Lord.
[time=1446] This is the motivational component.
[time=1448] This is why.
[time=1449] Why would we ever come back to Aunt Lorraine's house?
[time=1452] Well let me tell you one thing.
[time=1454] Bold love has no room for revenge.
[time=1457] A true biblical godly love has no room to take a pound of flesh out of the person that hurt you.
[time=1465] The only reason to re-engage in relationship with a person who has hurt you is for the purpose of establishing a godly, joyful, god-honoring relationship that is characteristic of peace.
[time=1477] God jealously guards vengeance.
[time=1479] He says it is mine.
[time=1480] It is not yours.
[time=1481] It is not your place to take vengeance on a person who has hurt you.
[time=1485] My private possession and I will do it in my time and in my way, and we would admit he will do it far better than we ever will or could.
[time=1496] Now this is very interesting.
[time=1497] Look at the fifth component of boldly loving your enemy.
[time=1500] It's in verse 20, "But if your enemy is hungry, feed him.
[time=1506] And if he is thirsty, give him something to drink." Why?
[time=1511] For in so doing, you will heap burning coals upon his head.
[time=1518] This is the active component.
[time=1521] God says not only are there things I want you to say to your enemy, not only are there ways I want you to feel about your enemy and think about your enemy and seek in your relationship with your enemy, but here I call you to give them good gifts.
[time=1537] Good gifts.
[time=1538] You say what is this thing about this heaping burning coals upon their head?
[time=1542] It's an old ancient expression and it was a practice in that particular day that when you had done something that had been shameful, when you had disgraced yourself or your family and you wanted to make some public mend for that disgrace, what you would actually do is take this thing and put burning coals inside the basket and then wear it around.
[time=1564] I don't understand that.
[time=1565] I mean, I wouldn't do that.
[time=1566] You wouldn't do that, but they do that.
[time=1567] For example, over in Japan, and there was a time in Japanese history when if you lost face, if you had the social disgrace of losing face in that culture, if you did it violently enough and severely enough, the only way to save face, you didn't put burning coals upon your head, you committed Harry Carey.
[time=1585] Each culture tends to have its ways of atoning, of giving public acknowledgment of personal wrongdoing, and that's what he is saying.
[time=1594] He is saying the active component of boldly loving your enemy is to give them the kinds of gifts that will shame them into an honest acknowledgement
[time=1605] of what they have done.
[time=1607] This is not a passive, mamsi, pamsi, layover and get slaughtered mentality
[time=1613] in the face of an enemy.
[time=1614] It is a bold, courageous commitment to move into their life and to provoke and entice the involvement of God as you are emotionally connected with them as you are sensing that their sin is no worse than your sin, and as you are longing for a reconciled relationship of peace, you give out good gifts that shame them in the hopes that the above could transpire.
[time=1639] So the question is, what does it mean to love and forgive and do good to someone
[time=1645] who has harmed you?
[time=1647] Well, in our culture, very few people pursue us with the intent to harm us
[time=1653] along the lines of martyrdom.
[time=1655] True?
[time=1656] Not a lot of Christians being put to death here in the United States of America.
[time=1660] Not a lot of believers being imprisoned because of their faith.
[time=1663] Not a lot of believers having their worldly goods confiscated.
[time=1666] And really on a major scale, not a lot of Christians being ostracized from particular social circles.
[time=1673] There may be some, but it's relatively mild.
[time=1676] In other words, the kind of harm that our enemies will do to us in this day and age has little to do with martyrdom or imprisonment or confiscation of goods.
[time=1686] But there is an enormous amount of relational persecution that you and I
[time=1693] live with, where someone pursues you with the intent of doing you harm not in the political or economic realm, but in the relational realm.
[time=1703] And the way that person treats you murders your soul and imprisons your heart
[time=1710] and confiscates your hope and ostracizes you from your faith.
[time=1717] And I believe this kind of persecution is far more devastating and far more serious and well within the parameters of this text.
[time=1725] Having said that, and you can kind of consider that as a backdrop or an introduction, I want to very narrowly now tighten our focus this morning on a kind of person.
[time=1735] A kind of enemy.
[time=1737] A kind of persecutor.
[time=1739] A kind of person who pursues other people to do their harm.
[time=1742] And I call this person the destroyer.
[time=1745] I call them the destroyer because it is the opposite of edification.
[time=1748] To edify someone which is the call of a believer is to build them up.
[time=1751] And if you are not building them up, you are tearing them down.
[time=1754] And so I label this person the destroyer.
[time=1758] And I'm going to talk about a kind of destroyer that is way out here on the continuum.
[time=1762] I'm going to talk about a destroyer that pushes what it means to be a destroyer to the limits out there.
[time=1768] But you may find as you listen that along that continuum you're married to somebody that's somewhere in there or you have a mother something like that or a father that is something like that or a wife that is something like that.
[time=1780] I believe that I have met five or ten full-fledged bonafide serious destroyers in my lifetime.
[time=1786] Some of them I have had to have repeated and prolonged exposure to.
[time=1790] I'm thankful that neither of my mother or father fit this category.
[time=1793] But there are others in my family that I have had to have repeated and prolonged exposure to who clearly fit this way out there destroyer category.
[time=1803] As I was studying this topic, I came across a book by a man by the name of Dan Allender.
[time=1809] And Dan put into words for me emotions and feelings and perspectives that I have had about destroyers.
[time=1815] Those I have known well and those I have not just known but in passing.
[time=1819] And I encourage you if any of this strikes to your heart this morning to buy this book called Bold Love by Dan Allender.
[time=1828] And I will lean heavily upon him this morning as I share some of his insights about the destroyer.
[time=1835] Now there are destroyers in this church.
[time=1839] In fact, interestingly after this morning's message, a man and his wife came up to me and the man said, "You are talking about me. That is me.
[time=1846] That is what I do to my wife." And we went back in the prayer room and had a wonderful time and he confessed his sin and wants to become accountable and wants to learn to be an edifier.
[time=1855] You may have destroyers in your ABF.
[time=1857] You may have destroyers in your family, as I say.
[time=1860] It may be a husband, it may be a wife, it may be your mother-in-law, it may be your mother-in-law, it may be your mother-father-father-in-law, probably someone that is close to you.
[time=1868] Or you may be blessed to not have any of them in your life.
[time=1872] My goal with a time that remains this morning is to define what it means to be a destroyer.
[time=1878] I want to give you a picture of what it means to be a destroyer, what they look like.
[time=1883] Why they work the way they do.
[time=1886] And then I'd like to describe the impact that the destroyer has on his victim.
[time=1891] And then I'd like to, hopefully, from Romans 12, offer some direction as to what it means to love him or her and what it means to be victorious, to overcome evil with good or good with evil.
[time=1906] Now I'll tend to talk about the destroyer in the mail, gender there.
[time=1909] But please be noted, it does not have to be a man, it does not have to be a husband.
[time=1913] It can be a wife, it can be a woman, it can be a mother.
[time=1919] A destroyer can be the father who craftily and pervasively undermines his children
[time=1925] at every point of decision, criticizing their reasoning or their motives, and superintending every one of their relationships with a brooding fear of over protection.
[time=1936] He may look to outsiders to be a committed sacrificial parent, but in fact he is a jealous, obsessive accuser that devours their hearts.
[time=1946] Over time his behavior in their life devours their hearts.
[time=1951] It may be a husband who dominates and tears down his wife.
[time=1957] If she expresses an opinion about a friend or if she even orders a meal without his approval, he can begin a long discourse on the flaws of her logic.
[time=1965] His lecture might literally last for hours, and if she differs with his facts, he intensifies his onslaught of criticism.
[time=1973] He is more than intolerant of other viewpoints, he is methodical and relentless in stalking every thought that differs from his until he has tracked it down, shot it, and left it to die.
[time=1985] She feels like she is a prisoner of his words.
[time=1987] If she tries to get out, she is forced to endure even more relentless torture.
[time=1992] If she sits quietly and endures his tirade, she will be spared the full extent of his violation.
[time=2000] That destroyer could be the father's treatment of his daughter.
[time=2003] Listen to this, think of my daughter Whitney who is six years old, and this is not me and this is not Whitney, but think of us.
[time=2009] At one time when she was six, he put a noose around her neck and forced her to stand all day long in a chair underneath a tree limb.
[time=2019] If she fell or swooned, the noose would hang her like a condemned criminal.
[time=2025] After standing for hours, she felt weak and began to faint.
[time=2029] Her knees crumbled and the noose pulled tight.
[time=2034] She fought to regain her balance, but the chair toppled below her and the rope snapped around her throat and then gave way.
[time=2041] You see, he had tied the rope so that it would sense tight and then release when the pressure was strong enough.
[time=2049] Unbelievable, wasn't it?
[time=2054] It's a true event.
[time=2057] A destroyer could be a mother who was pleasant, a hospitable woman who was known as a good Christian.
[time=2064] She bakes meals for shut-ins, she serves on church committees, she is involved in many civic organizations.
[time=2070] A negative trait overlooked by most is a significant temper.
[time=2074] Behind closed doors, her volcanic fury melts everyone who dares stand in her path.
[time=2080] At one time, her daughter refused to participate in an activity, so the mother slapped her, pulled a shank of hair out of her head, and explosively recounted every wrong her daughter had ever committed.
[time=2093] Her daughter finally caved in and agreed to participate.
[time=2096] The mother remarked, "I'm sure glad you've come to your senses."
[time=2102] Well, if those are some vignettes of how destroyers function some extreme and some more mild, let me give you a couple characteristics.
[time=2109] Some principles that describe the destroyer.
[time=2111] Number one, the destroyer lacks empathy and shame.
[time=2120] What do I mean by that?
[time=2121] He or she lacks feeling for how they make other people feel.
[time=2126] A destroyer doesn't have a sense of connection with this behavior that I'm doing
[time=2132] and the kind of pain and sorrow and the blows to that person's self-esteem.
[time=2138] There's a disconnect going on right there.
[time=2141] You see, the destroyer doesn't see them as a living, breathing person who hurts and has fears and has sorrows.
[time=2147] A destroyer sees this person more like a styrofoam cup.
[time=2151] It's an object to be used, and when usefulness is finished, it can be thrown away.
[time=2157] There's no real value there.
[time=2159] That person has no feelings.
[time=2161] The destroyer has no connection with the feelings of a person.
[time=2165] Now, the destroyer may cry at a funeral or may express joy at a wedding,
[time=2171] but somehow there is a definite disconnect with what they do and the impact that it has on other people and those people's feelings.
[time=2179] For example, the father who's pseudo-hanged his daughter when confronted some years later, his demeanor was pleasant and condescending.
[time=2187] As this information, he was being confronted on what he did to his daughter.
[time=2190] He was just kind of pleasant.
[time=2191] He was just condescending.
[time=2192] Well, what do you have to say?
[time=2194] He did not deny the event.
[time=2195] He merely reinterpreted it as an acceptable means of making a dramatic statement to a little girl who would not listen or obey her father.
[time=2203] He was utterly estranged from the feelings a six-year-old little girl might have experienced at the prospect of hanging to death.
[time=2209] He felt no empathy or concern for her pain then or now some 20 years later.
[time=2215] From his perspective, he was trying to be a good parent, and she misinterpreted his concern as cruelty.
[time=2223] Know anybody like that?
[time=2226] Know anybody who treats you like that and you try to say to them why?
[time=2230] You know why and you think in your mind why doesn't this person understand the amount of pain that they're inflicting on me?
[time=2237] And why doesn't the amount of pain they're inflicting on me cause them to change their behavior?
[time=2244] Why is there a disconnect between that person's heart and my heart?
[time=2250] Number two, the destroyer is given to accusation and mockery.
[time=2255] And by mockery I mean it's like a proverb's word.
[time=2258] It means that the destroyer will find areas of weakness and twist and turn and accuse and make it always the victim's fault.
[time=2268] The destroyer uses very powerfully the language of accusation.
[time=2272] It is the bony finger that he or she points to exploit the fragile weak points in its victim.
[time=2279] Heartless accusation, blame shifting and fault finding that lacks any tenderness or any desire for reconciliation.
[time=2288] Then you saw it in this dad who pseudo-hanged his daughter.
[time=2292] He began to mock her, he began to accuse her, he began to say, "Let me tell you why you ended up being hung on that tree that day." It wasn't because I'm a bad father, it's because you were an unruly little girl.
[time=2305] And now you're bringing it back up to me because you have misinterpreted, it was your fault, it was your fault then and it's your fault now.
[time=2313] That's what a devouring person does, that's what a destroyer does.
[time=2317] Never takes responsibility, never assumes fault and never because he's shameless.
[time=2322] Never does he or she really feel the full import of what he or she has done.
[time=2329] So one, the destroyer lacks real empathy and shame for the damage done in another person's life.
[time=2333] Number two, the destroyer is given to mockery and accusation.
[time=2337] The evidence comes that they are not all they ought to be, they fight that off and they push hard to establish the wrong in the other person.
[time=2345] Number three, and this is amazing.
[time=2349] Number three, the destroyer seeks to control and dominate.
[time=2354] And about now if you live with a destroyer you know exactly what I'm talking about.
[time=2359] You have the sense that this person is seeking to so manipulate and so control that you come under their domination.
[time=2367] Now there may be moments where the destroyer seems helpful, open, kind, generous, long-suffering, sweet, thoughtful, but that is nothing but a veiled attempt
[time=2378] at gaining new footholds for further progress in manipulation.
[time=2383] It is an effort to manipulate to obligate.
[time=2388] The destroyer wants conformity more than anything else.
[time=2392] The destroyer wants unearned devotion that borders on worship, a form of sacrifice that requires the loss of your will, your mind, and your soul.
[time=2401] The destroyer displays a craving to suck the other soul dry until every drop of life
[time=2407] has been drawn for its own benefit.
[time=2411] It's an unbelievable portrait.
[time=2414] These are true living, breathing human beings.
[time=2418] And that's how they function.
[time=2421] A warped sense of empathy and shame.
[time=2424] Unbelievable ability to accuse and shift blame back in the other direction and in so doing destroy further and have no qualms about it.
[time=2433] With the ultimate end of seeking to dominate and control.
[time=2438] In a weird kind, resulting in a weird kind of worship.
[time=2444] Well, if that's a portrait of who a destroyer is, let me give you, secondly, now a major point, second major point to describe the impact of the destroyer in another person's life.
[time=2455] If you have had prolonged exposure to a destroyer, my bet is that you are experiencing these three things.
[time=2461] Number one, you are losing your ability to trust people.
[time=2467] You are losing your ability to be in relationship with people.
[time=2471] Why?
[time=2473] When you and I enter into a relationship with another person, we know in advance we're going to get hurt.
[time=2478] But the underlying assumption is that that person I'm going to be in relationship with has a good heart.
[time=2484] And that when they hurt me, they will eventually own up to their damage
[time=2490] and resolve because of their good heart not to do it again.
[time=2496] There's a certain kind of trust that goes on in all of our relationships, a confidence that if I am hurt by a person, the damage they have done will eventually be resolved because they have a good heart and they ultimately want what is right.
[time=2509] But when you are in relationship with a destroyer, your trust in people is systematically dismantled because the destroyer betrays that trust over and over and over and over and over again and the apologies may be offered and the promises may be made, the real change never comes.
[time=2528] You are nothing more than an object to be used.
[time=2535] And your attempts to forgive and to trust again make you look ridiculous
[time=2543] because the destroyer never really repents.
[time=2548] Number two, you'll find that you are losing hope.
[time=2553] Hope, you will find that the destroyer is systematically taking away
[time=2559] your ability to have hope that tomorrow can be better.
[time=2565] The person who has had long and prolonged exposure to a destroyer has no more hope about the future.
[time=2574] There is no hope in that person that there can be a better tomorrow and with that hope, a motivation and an energy to work for a better tomorrow because the destroyer never changes.
[time=2586] The destroyer steals from the soul a vision of what could be by the destroyer's relentless pursuit of his or her own path of selfishness.
[time=2597] The destroyer wants control and absolute power.
[time=2600] Remember, the destroyer is in this game for control and power and a pseudo form of worship and where a person would have hope for a different kind of relationship, it threatens the destroyer's attempt at control.
[time=2614] And so the destroyer addresses any difference of opinion with fury and cruelty and hatred.
[time=2620] Did you hear that?
[time=2621] The destroyer addresses any difference of opinion with fury and cruelty and hatred using terror to drive home the idiocy of ever even wanting much less working for change.
[time=2634] This should ring some bells in your mind.
[time=2637] There are times in your memory if you've been in relationship with the destroyer where you really put it on the table and you really believed and you really hoped and you really are tried to articulate another way for the two of you to live.
[time=2648] And as you know sooner, it got those words out of your mouth.
[time=2651] You were hit with a barrage of cruelty and hatred and terror making you feel like an idiot for suggesting that change were even needed.
[time=2663] So you have no hope.
[time=2666] You said hopelessly. Without energy?
[time=2670] Number three.
[time=2672] If you've had any prolonged exposure to a destroyer, you are losing your confidence in the power of love.
[time=2677] There was a naive day in your life when you thought love could cover it.
[time=2681] When you thought your love for that other person could prevail.
[time=2684] When you thought your undying pure, simple, flawed, but nevertheless faithful love would eventually conquer the heart of the destroyer.
[time=2693] But now love seems so puny.
[time=2696] Love seems inconsequential in the face of your destroyer.
[time=2700] It seems so foolish to vulnerably stumble back into the loving posture towards a destroyer.
[time=2707] The destroyer mocks the desire to love by making love seem so small and powerless.
[time=2714] And once the destroyer has squashed the heart of his victim, then that heart loses all its purpose and passion for life.
[time=2725] At least a godly life.
[time=2728] What I have seen occur in these cases is that a new passion emerges.
[time=2732] If that person has been a believer and unarmed by this kind of information and been the abused in a destroyer relationship, they oftentimes will revolt in a violent rebellion against that person and against God and against the church.
[time=2747] They'll get a passion, but it's not a godly passion.
[time=2749] They'll get a purpose, but it's not a godly purpose.
[time=2753] And so the impact that you will see in the people who have been destroyed by a destroyer, they are angry, typically they are disillusioned, they are rebellious, they are hurting, they are hopeless.
[time=2769] But the core realities of their soul are they no longer can trust people.
[time=2774] They no longer have any hope for a better tomorrow, and they feel like the greatest reality of all of life, love itself, has been trivialized to nothing.
[time=2785] Let me tell you something else, it doesn't just stop with people.
[time=2789] The person who has had prolonged exposure to a destroyer will typically have lost their trust in God, and they will say to themselves, God, you have seen this now for these many years and you have watched my plight and you have done nothing and I don't trust you anymore.
[time=2808] And that person will also have a complete loss of hope in the sovereignty of God and the fact that God may have a worthwhile plan for their future.
[time=2817] You will not hear them unveil their heart's desire for a future with God and striving to walk with Him in the days ahead.
[time=2824] It will be moot, it will be non-existent.
[time=2829] And you will also find that same person wanting nothing to do with an expression of love of God.
[time=2834] Or they may give lip service to it, but you will not catch them worshiping God, you will not catch them bubbling over and exploding in their heart with the feelings of adoration, love and gratitude for a holy and righteous God.
[time=2847] So if the destroyer is successful, he will destroy, trust in people and God,
[time=2855] he will have quenched any hope for the future in people with people and with God,
[time=2861] and he will have trivialized the greatest adventure of all of life loving people and loving God.
[time=2872] Let me give you a third major category, what can we do about it?
[time=2875] And we're back to this drama again, we're back to those opening illustrations.
[time=2878] We're back to, okay, so what does it mean not to be overcome by evil?
[time=2882] What does a bold love look like?
[time=2885] Let me say this.
[time=2887] I believe as this text indicates that God has some things for you to say to the destroyer.
[time=2892] I believe that a bold love has some things that are far more profound and far deeper and far more powerful than I forgive you or that you hurt me.
[time=2902] I think that there is a feeling that needs to happen and be rekindled in the heart of the one who has been the victim of this that reconnects with the heart of the destroyer.
[time=2911] So there's true empathy and true compassion and a true sense where even Stephen could say about those literally destroying his life father, forgive them for they know not what they do.
[time=2920] And as Jesus did on the cross, there is a holistic, very marvelous thing that happens
[time=2927] in the life of the persecuted when they can stay in touch with the true empathy of the one doing the damage.
[time=2933] And to shut your feelings off and to close down is to mar what it means to be an image-bearer in the sight of God.
[time=2940] There's a calling to think about that destroyer in a certain way to recognize that they are no less in need of saving grace than you are.
[time=2948] There is a way to, and any further engagement with that destroyer is with the purpose of peace,
[time=2954] of a genuine relationship, not some fake relationship, but really going after what it would mean
[time=2960] to love and commune and have fellowship together with honesty and integrity.
[time=2966] And then there are some things that, as I have noted, you must do.
[time=2970] You must do. You must give your enemy what he or she needs.
[time=2975] And what do I mean by that?
[time=2977] You must give your enemy what he or she needs so that you can shame them to a place of repentance,
[time=2985] so far as it is in your power.
[time=2988] Let me be specific here.
[time=2991] You need to give the destroyer the greatest gift you can give, the gift of defeat.
[time=3000] Destroyers are used to winning.
[time=3002] They are used to getting their way. They are very familiar with always having it their way.
[time=3008] And the best gift is the strength to frustrate their attempts to dominate your life.
[time=3015] The very best gift you can give to a destroyer is to, with love in your heart and powerful words,
[time=3022] frustrate their desire to dominate your life.
[time=3029] Let me say something to you. The destroyer will rarely change because of a conversation.
[time=3034] And as I mentioned to you already, the destroyer will probably take the information in that conversation and with an incredible ability, turn it around and make it your fault.
[time=3042] Conversational loan is not the issue. You just give them fuel for the fire.
[time=3048] Instead, I believe one of the gifts you need to give is to set and enforce parameters and boundaries.
[time=3054] And I don't care if you're the wife and you're setting parameters and forcing them for your destroying husband or if you're a child and you're setting them for your destroying parent.
[time=3062] And this is not running in the face of submission both to a husband or to parents.
[time=3067] It is what it means to be a true and bold lover of an enemy.
[time=3073] For example, one woman whose husband often verbally attacked her with vicious and cruel contempt said this to him,
[time=3082] an act of bold love, a true gift. She said this quote, "If you choose to continue this tirade, I will tape it and give a copy to your elder board
[time=3093] and allow them to see what kind of man you are outside the pulpit."
[time=3099] Now I'd say that's a pretty clear parameter.
[time=3104] The parameter is this, don't verbally abuse me.
[time=3108] And the consequence was very clear. If you do, it will be brought to the attention of our church.
[time=3113] Doesn't that sound like heaping calls? Doesn't that sound like a blessing?
[time=3116] Don't those words sound like a blessing coming from that woman?
[time=3120] And hopefully she is feeling attached to the destroyer himself as she says it.
[time=3124] And she knows she's as much a sinner as he is, but what she's hoping for is a true genuine relationship of peace.
[time=3131] And so she does something about it. She gives him what he needs, parameters and consequences.
[time=3139] Now it's true that parameters are sometimes difficult to find, but they always exist.
[time=3144] They always exist. And when you are prepared for the assault,
[time=3150] you can hopefully calmly and confidently restate the parameters of acceptable human response.
[time=3156] When they come at you again, you can say, "Wait a minute, I think you're forgetting the parameters." And then warn the destroyer what the consequences will be if there is further violation of those parameters.
[time=3167] Inform the destroyer that you will walk out of his or her office or hang up the phone or call the police.
[time=3174] And if that's what you've warned and if that is what gets violated, then do it.
[time=3178] Do it with deliberation, do it without apology, and do it without absence of rancor or vindictiveness.
[time=3185] That's not being unsubmissive. That is not being unsubmissive. That is loving your husband.
[time=3194] Let me give you another incident of a daughter who's about, I think, in college, seems to be.
[time=3199] Her name is Jane. She has a destroyer for a father.
[time=3203] And the father all of her life has assailed her and ridiculed her
[time=3209] and verbally destroyed her for any perceived lack of loyalty towards their family, her mother.
[time=3219] And there was a big conflict as to whether or not she was coming home for summer and apparently they got to do an enormous fight.
[time=3226] And here's the phone call that followed. Dad is following up, apparently calling away to college.
[time=3232] Dad says, "Hi, honey. I'm calling to see when you'll be arriving." Jane, chuckling out loud, said, "Well, Dad, I can at least say it will not be in this calendar year."
[time=3242] Dad says, "What? You know your mother is counting on you helping us with the big 4th of July party.
[time=3248] She won't be able to do it without your help." The daughter responds, "Oh, well, that's too bad, Dad.
[time=3255] You know a lot of catering firms do holiday spreads. I'll bet there are some in your area.
[time=3261] Don't get cute with me. You know your mother wants you here. Not a catering firm.
[time=3266] Now, let's get serious. You will be coming home." Now, listen to this. Jane says this, "Dad, do you recall the conversation we had a few nights ago when you yelled and called me some terrible names?"
[time=3277] Well, I told you then I would no longer allow you to sin against me or yourself by enduring your use of rage and shame against me.
[time=3286] So before you get too much more intense in this conversation, let me make it clear again.
[time=3291] I will not stay on the phone if that is your manner of relating to me.
[time=3295] Dad, are you willing to think with me about the way you deal with me and frankly almost everyone else in our family?
[time=3302] Lou. Jane did a good thing. Jane got bold. Jane loved her dad.
[time=3313] Dad's response. Well, fine. I'll tell your mother about your decision.
[time=3317] And let me tell you I have no interest in being lectured by a kid who has no more sense than up Jane interrupts.
[time=3323] Dad, I'll look forward to the day when you do desire to interact. So I'll be talking with you soon.
[time=3329] Goodbye, Dad. Click.
[time=3331] Parameters, consequences. Parameters, consequences. That is not being an unsubmissive daughter.
[time=3337] That is being a bold, courageous lover of an evil father.
[time=3342] Or a father who is acting evilly.
[time=3346] Boy.
[time=3350] Now, be aware, my friends, that if I can in any way just what your appetite,
[time=3356] describe who these people are and give you some idea of the way that you can overcome evil with good instead of being overcome by it.
[time=3365] But I will have to warn you that you will enrage the destroyer.
[time=3369] You begin to move in these areas and you will make your life worse.
[time=3374] But you will also give the destroyer room to repent.
[time=3378] You will give them a chance to acknowledge the violation of their relationship which they have perpetrated on you.
[time=3383] You will allow them to seek your forgiveness for the real violations going on there.
[time=3387] And you will allow them to communicate to you what will have to change in the way they treat you if their relationship is going to continue.
[time=3395] Wouldn't that be wonderful, Aunt Lorraine? Having some honest, bold love coming from the couch?
[time=3403] And though she may at first be infuriated, she senses something in the heart of that couple that really loves her
[time=3410] and is not willing to allow her to continue to violate them like that.
[time=3414] And so they offer her a blessing and they say to her a reflection of what she is to them.
[time=3420] And they let her know that they very much long for continued exposure with her, but if she continues to treat them this way, they will not return.
[time=3427] Now that's what I call bold love.
[time=3431] That's what I call love of another kind. That's what I call something worth living for, not enduring this kind of thing.
[time=3439] Well, loving hard to love people.
[time=3443] Love people who pursue you to harm you.
[time=3447] What does it include? Strong words of confrontation that expose and define parameters.
[time=3455] It involves an emotional component that is done from a heart of sympathy and true compassion for the destroyer.
[time=3463] It is done with an acute mental awareness that you are no less a sinner than they are, and this isn't about you being better, it's about you loving them.
[time=3471] It's done with a motivational concern, not for revenge, but for reconciliation to enjoy the fruits of a God-honoring relationship with a dear woman or man or child or parent.
[time=3483] And it requires an active component of giving gifts that are truly needed that allow shame to be heaped on the head of the one who is perpetrating and playing the role and acting as the evil enemy.
[time=3497] And giving them the greatest gift of all, defeat, providing room for them to repent and stand as a normal human being in genuine relationship with other people.
[time=3516] Well, let me invite you to stand for a closing word of prayer.
