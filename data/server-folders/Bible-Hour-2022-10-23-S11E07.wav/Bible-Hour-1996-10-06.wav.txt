[time=30] In James, chapter 1 it says, "Consider it all joy, my brother, and when you encounter
[time=47] various trials, it's not if it's when they are guaranteed to come into our life."
[time=54] The clear teaching of Scripture is not that God, once we come to Christ, lifts us up out and over the difficult places of life.
[time=62] It is instead that He gives us the courage and the strength to move into the difficult
[time=68] points of life and grow through them and be meaningfully involved with them for His glory
[time=75] and for His honor.
[time=83] This is the Sunday Morning Worship Service of Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=87] Thank you for joining us.
[time=88] Grief is the normal but painful reaction to great loss.
[time=92] The Bible calls us to comfort one another in these times.
[time=95] How effective are you in this process?
[time=97] Stay with us today and learn about giving a kind of comfort that can really make a difference.
[time=102] Now let's join our service.
[time=117] All around you see in security surely there must be a place reserved for only me.
[time=140] Special place to hide, a shelter from the storms outside, never fear the Father's always
[time=153] near.
[time=169] In a world of fear,
[time=196] of reasons yet unclear, can you trust unless you see His plan for you and me.
[time=211] It's working for your good, as only one who loves you could wait and see the best is yet
[time=223] to be.
[time=253] We will be here, in His care.
[time=260] In a world of fear, in His love, in His love, in His love, in His love.
[time=280] We will be here, in His love, in His love, in His love, in His love, in His love.
[time=317] In His love, in His love, in His love, in His love.
[time=317] [REPETITIVE CONTENT - 63 seconds] In His love, in His love, in His love, in His love....
[time=405] Hi, my name is Russell Moore, and I want to welcome you to the Bible hour, and thank you for joining us today.
[time=410] Well, our subject this morning, as we continue in our series on love of another kind,
[time=416] is entitled "Comforting Love." And it's going to address the issue of how to help people who are grieving the loss of a loved one.
[time=425] And I'm amazed at how practical the Word of God continues to be in our lives, where even this very specific issue
[time=434] of helping one another grieve the loss of a loved one is addressed in the Word of God.
[time=439] Paul mentions it in 1 Thessalonians chapter 4, there's a group of believers there, brand new in the Lord,
[time=445] and they were losing people to death, as we even do to this day, and had no idea really
[time=452] where they were going, or how they would end up at the end of the age, and so they were grieving
[time=458] as if they had no hope, as if Jesus hadn't made a difference in their life, and as if they weren't saved, and as if their eternal destiny wasn't secure.
[time=466] And though those were beginning questions of believers way back when, before some of these great truths
[time=472] were established for us about life after death and the presence of Jesus Christ, we have other issues that we deal with, just that great enormous sense of pain and sorrow
[time=485] and loss that we go through as we grieve the departure of a loved one.
[time=490] And I don't know if you have suffered recently the loss of a loved one, or if you have people in your family or in close, kind of close network of friendships who have suffered the loss of a loved one, but we trust that today we'll be able to give you helpful instruction and encouragement as to the kind of comfort, comfort of another kind, comfort that really makes a difference in people's lives for the cause of Christ.
[time=515] And of course I don't think this is just relevant to how one believer would relate to another believer.
[time=521] I really understand God's heart for the lost and the way he wants to use us to reach people
[time=530] outside the family of God, and I would think that much of what is being taught in today's message
[time=537] if applied to your relationship with unbelievers could have a profound and powerful impact
[time=545] on them coming to know Christ, on them coming to know the difference that Christ can make in their life as they experience his love of another kind through your very tangible expressions
[time=557] of love as they have lost a loved one.
[time=560] Well it's exciting to be here, it's exciting to be in the fall, it's exciting to sense the weather is changing and I know that great things are ahead for us and I trust ahead
[time=571] in your life and I pray that God is moving powerfully in your heart and in your life
[time=577] to cause you to seize these days, to love the ones you're around, to invest in them, to
[time=584] pursue them, to commit yourself, to giving what you have, to investing in their life,
[time=590] whether it's reading a book with your child before he goes off to sleep or whether it's taking your wife to dinner, whatever it is that involves you pursuing other people.
[time=597] I encourage you to do that and to be like Christ.
[time=624] You don't have to say it, I can see it in your eyes.
[time=632] Though your heart is bruised, you hide the truth beneath the fine disguise.
[time=643] Well I've got something to tell you, though it's simple, it's said with love.
[time=653] Nothing new, still it's as true as it ever was.
[time=663] He'll never let you go, oh no, that's never been his way.
[time=674] And he said that he would love you, he was talking about for always, he'll never let you go.
[time=686] No matter how low you feel that you have fallen.
[time=695] His arms are longer still, and he wants you to know he'll never let you go.
[time=717] You trace all your failures, and good intentions left behind, and you wonder when you fly again,
[time=730] lost the will to try.
[time=736] But there in your weakness, you will find the winds of the wind.
[time=745] And should you get scared, he'll be there, where he's always been.
[time=755] He'll never let you go, oh no, that's never been his way.
[time=766] When he said that he would love you, he was talking about for always, he'll never let you go.
[time=779] No matter how low you feel that you have fallen.
[time=788] His arms are longer still, and he wants you to know he'll never let you go.
[time=803] And in the desert place where the heart can sing, when your faith is shaken, when you can't be some morning,
[time=813] you're not on your own, you never walk alone.
[time=818] He's got you safe beneath his wings, oh, he'll never let you go.
[time=835] Oh no, that's never been his way.
[time=842] When he said that he would love you, he was talking about for always, he'll never let you go.
[time=855] No matter how low you feel that you have fallen.
[time=864] His arms are longer still, and he wants you to know he'll never let you go.
[time=878] No matter how low you feel that you have fallen.
[time=884] Well, we come this morning to return in our series on love of another kind.
[time=896] And we're in our fifth installment, and we'll focus our series more tightly on particular kinds of people to love.
[time=903] As you noted last week, we talked about difficult people to love, and this week the subject matter is loving people who are in grief.
[time=910] Webster defines grief this way, deep and poignant distress caused by suffering the death of a loved one.
[time=919] As I have watched people grieve, as I have seen the process, I come up with different definitions.
[time=925] A gut-wrenching and motion-packed sobbing that lurches the body as the heart is overwhelmed with a sense of irreplaceable loss.
[time=934] A deep-seated pain that settles in the middle of the chest somewhere and refuses to go away.
[time=940] An ache that won't go away no matter who, no matter when, no matter what.
[time=946] It's a longing for physical exhaustion and fatigue to overpower the mind and heart, making sleep possible.
[time=958] You know, a lot of times when people come to Christ, they give their life to God. They have the assumption that now God is on their side, and that is true.
[time=967] But that God being on their side means that He will now work the circumstances of life out in such a way that they don't grieve.
[time=976] They don't really hurt. They aren't truly confused. They don't reach points of absolute despair where they're really groping for direction.
[time=984] And that just simply isn't true.
[time=987] It interests me that in many places in the Word of God, just when the glories and the wonders of salvation are lifted up and extolled, right on the heels of that comes the inevitability of trials.
[time=1004] For example, in Romans 5, you don't need to turn there, but in Romans 5, as He wakes His way through chapter 1 and chapter 2, and finally in chapter 3, He lifts up the wonder of the gospel, what it means to be saved by grace, and to be right with God, and to have the righteousness of God bestowed on your life.
[time=1020] He labors in chapters 1 through 4 to establish that truth. You come to chapter 5 and He says this, and not only this, but we also exalt in our tribulations, knowing that tribulation brings about perseverance.
[time=1033] And perseverance proven character and proven character hope, and hope doesn't disappoint because the love of God has been poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit.
[time=1042] Now, sooner does He get done explaining and clarifying the wonder of the gospel that it's given by grace, and it's through faith, that He begins to describe what happens after that, and what happens after that is tribulation.
[time=1054] What happens after that is the same kinds of things that happens to other people that have never come to Christ.
[time=1060] We live in a fallen world, and salvation doesn't change that. Salvation doesn't lift us up to now experience only mountaintops of life, and we get to skip the valleys.
[time=1070] It's just not that way.
[time=1072] The Lord told us all about that. In John chapter 16, He said this, "In the world, you have tribulation."
[time=1079] And that's just a statement of fact. Nothing about coming to Christ, nothing about getting right with God, nothing about accepting Christ as your Savior removes you from the normal course,
[time=1089] the give and take of being a fallen person living in a fallen world.
[time=1094] James, the half-brother of John, said it this way, "Consider it all, join my brother, and win you encounter various trials."
[time=1101] Writing to a group of believers, and he doesn't lift trials and tribulation and hardship up as a possibility, he guarantees it.
[time=1109] And he says, "Now, when they come, this is how I want you to act." So the clear teaching of Scripture is that you and I, like everybody else in the world, suffers loss.
[time=1119] We suffer tribulation, and we suffer in all different forms and ways and times.
[time=1124] The kind of tribulation we'll focus on this morning is the loss of loved ones.
[time=1129] We look through the pages of Scripture. We see that Abraham mourned the death of his beloved wife, Sarah.
[time=1135] Jacob mourned the death of his favored son Joseph. The Israelites mourned the loss of men like Aaron and Moses and Samuel.
[time=1144] Mary, Martha, and Jesus outside the tomb of Lazarus, and Jesus has recorded their weeping as he mourned the loss of his dear friend.
[time=1154] In Acts chapter 8, verse 2, it says, "Devout men buried Stephen," you remember he was stoned for his preaching the gospel.
[time=1160] It goes on to say, "They made loud lamentation over him. They wept, they cried, and they mourned the loss of their friend Stephen."
[time=1171] David has found mourning the loss of Saul, then Jonathan, then Abner, and finally Absalom.
[time=1179] You remember Absalom, his son, who rebelled against him and brought a coup and an insurrection against his own father's leadership,
[time=1186] and whose efforts ended in his own death? 2 Samuel 18, Samuel says this,
[time=1192] "And the king was deeply moved at the news of his son's death. He went up to the chamber over the gate and he wept.
[time=1199] And thus he said, as he walked, "Oh, my son, Absalom. My son, my son, Absalom. What I had died instead of you, Oh, Absalom, my son, my son."
[time=1212] Even David, who knew what it was to walk with God, even David, who had a heart for God.
[time=1217] Even David, in all of his wonderful writings about the Psalms and experiencing the euphoric experience of walking with God,
[time=1225] knew the well, the reality of pain and loss and grief.
[time=1229] And as we hear him lamenting the loss of Absalom, we can kind of hear that familiar note in other people's voice when the loved one dies
[time=1237] and how they would long to die in their loved one's place, how they wish they could change places and exchange their death for life the one they love.
[time=1247] You're hearing David's grief sorrow over the loss of his son. You're hearing David's grief, the disappointment of his son's betrayal, Oh, Absalom, my son.
[time=1257] How could you have done that to me? And you're probably hearing David's grief, the guilt over failing in his own fathering of Absalom.
[time=1266] Common themes, longing to die in the beloved's place, sorrow over the loss of that beloved.
[time=1272] Disappointment in the course of that beloved's life and personal guilt over the way you didn't love the way you might have loved.
[time=1280] Had you known this would eventually.
[time=1283] So we read of believers all through the Word of God.
[time=1287] Loud cries, the beating of the breast, sitting in silence, the bowing of the head, sprinkling of ashes.
[time=1295] It would wear a special clothing called sackcloth, a course article.
[time=1300] Grief, pain of loss, it's a Christian reality.
[time=1305] In the five and a half years that I have been at Blackhawk, we have lost sons and we have lost daughters.
[time=1313] We have lost mothers and we have lost fathers.
[time=1318] We have lost sisters and brothers, grandmothers and grandfathers. We have lost them to heart attacks, brain tumors, cancer and AIDS.
[time=1326] We have lost them suddenly. We have lost them slowly. We have lost them quietly. We have lost them violently.
[time=1333] And one thing is for sure, we are not yet done losing them.
[time=1339] Before the calendar changes again, before too long, we will lose another, and then another, and then another. It is inevitable.
[time=1350] What are we to do about it? What are we to do about it? What is our role, one with another?
[time=1357] What does it mean to have a love of another kind in the midst of that kind of heart-wrenching pain?
[time=1364] It seems clear in 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 that we have a role. Paul, you might turn there briefly, Paul is writing to a very young church.
[time=1372] He had been with him maybe only three weeks, and yet they had sprung up in a vital, true, genuine faith, and the church was alive.
[time=1380] And it was alive in many ways, but especially with the hope and the anticipation of the second coming of Christ.
[time=1385] It seemed as though they uniquely were living in that anticipation.
[time=1390] And in the months after Paul administered to them, some in their number, as Christians are prone to do, had died.
[time=1396] Not insulated by that, or from that, by our faith.
[time=1400] And he says in 1 Thessalonians chapter 4, then verse 13, "But we do not want you to be uninformed, brethren, about those who are asleep, that you may not grieve as do the rest who have no hope."
[time=1413] They were uninformed. They were ignorant about some facts about how it works in the rapture, about what it means to have eternal life.
[time=1420] And so their grief was an unrestrained grief like that that comes upon unbelievers who don't have a Savior, and whose death represents either in their mind's annihilation, but in reality eternal hell.
[time=1435] And to lose someone you love and have absolutely no idea of where they're going, no idea of what their eternal destiny looks like is truly an accelerated, painful process.
[time=1445] And the Christian, at least, in the reality of our faith and the knowledge of eternal life has hope that we will be reunited, that the beloved we've lost is not in torture, but rather in the splendid bliss, the presence of Christ.
[time=1457] So there is some help in that knowledge. Look at verse 18, however, I'm intrigued by this. Paul says of them, therefore, comfort one another with these words.
[time=1468] Apparently there's a way, there is a kind of coming alongside, there's a kind of encouragement, there's a kind of interaction that can go on between believers that really can make a difference in the process of grieving the loss of a loved one.
[time=1484] And we have that part to play. How do we bring comforting love?
[time=1490] And you and I, if we've lived it all, know it's a very complicated question to answer because no two situations are alike, no two deaths are alike, no two families are alike, no two experiences in our own life as we approach grieving people, we're never the same.
[time=1503] I mean, everything changes every time you get in the mix and you never have a pat answer and you never know exactly where you're going. What you do know is that the stakes are high.
[time=1512] What you do know is that people are hurting. What you do know is that what you say and what you do can have a deep impact on people because they are incredibly vulnerable.
[time=1524] How can we be effectively used of God to bring a comforting love that makes a difference in people's lives?
[time=1531] Well, first I'd like to establish what I call the conventional approach to comforting people in sorrow, to look at the average person's approach.
[time=1540] And as I learned about this, I saw that it all too often described me and maybe you'll find this conventional approach is describing you, but I can also attest to the fact that as the alternative was lifted up, something in me wanted to move in that direction and maybe that too will be your case.
[time=1558] The conventional approach to providing comfort to someone in anguish usually comes along the lines of like five basic steps and I'll just give them to you and try to explain conventional approach and then we'll contrast it with comfort of another kind.
[time=1571] First of all, the comfort giver tries to help the bereaved person pull his emotions together. In the comfort in the conventional approach to giving comfort, the comforter tries to help the bereaved pull his emotions together, to get his act together, to settle him down, to turn off the sprinklers if you will.
[time=1591] And you've seen this if you've been in hospital situations or funeral homes and you've seen it and you may have done it many times.
[time=1598] It goes this way, the tears of the bereaved and the feelings of the bereaved are beginning to flow and they're flowing with great intensity and somewhere along the line, the comforter starts to feel uncomfortable with the volume and the duration of the weeping.
[time=1614] And decides enough is enough. Maybe it gets too loud. Maybe it gets too guttural. Maybe it gets too expressive of the pain and something in the comforter says enough's enough and out comes the Kleenex.
[time=1630] Or out comes the handkerchief. Or here comes the suggestion, let's go outside and get some fresh air. You'll feel better. Or let's go down to the cafeteria and get something to eat. That'll help.
[time=1643] And in effect what is being said, in translation it's this, I think I've had just about enough emotion from you, so let's pull it together here and I'll feel a lot better.
[time=1655] Oftentimes we are unaccustomed to and we are afraid to move into those highly emotional, volatile experiences with people, especially knowing we don't have a clue of what might really help, but knowing if we do it wrong we can really hurt.
[time=1670] And our comfort zones get stretched and we begin to want to put parameters around the expression of their grief.
[time=1676] And I dare say it's much more for our comfort than for theirs. A second in the conventional effort at Giving Comfort is the fix at stage that try to replace the lost quickly stage that get on with life stage.
[time=1691] A close female friend, Ms. Carries. She's taking it really hard and you can't keep yourself from reminding her that she's only 24 years old and has lots of ticks left in her biological clock and that she should count her blessings that she is not your age.
[time=1705] Meanwhile she is counting her blessings that she is not as insensitive as you are because she doesn't want to think about getting pregnant again, she wants to mourn and grieve the lost of her baby.
[time=1719] Your best friend loses one of his four children and you just want to relieve his pain, i.e. your own pain, and so you say hey, you got to remember now you've got three more kids and they will require all the loving you have.
[time=1732] Conventional comfort wants to replace the lost, wants to fix the problem, wants to change the focus, wants to move on all too quickly.
[time=1744] A third step in the offering of conventional comfort is what we call the offering of sage wisdom.
[time=1754] Oftentimes it's a rich blend of their own life experiences, maybe a little scripture and some deer abbey thrown in along the way.
[time=1760] You ever notice how people feel? They just have to say something profound in the presence of the grieving person?
[time=1771] One man remembers the sage wisdom that came his way at the event of the death of his father.
[time=1780] He says this hundreds came when my father died, they came up to me and said things like well he had a full life, only 53 but a full life.
[time=1792] I guess God needed him more than you and the family did.
[time=1796] You know you're going to grow through this, you know you're a minister and you'll be able to grow through this and help a lot of other people.
[time=1804] Don't forget now, he's a lot better off in heaven.
[time=1809] Well at least he went quickly one guy said, some men his age have heart attacks and live.
[time=1816] One guy said you know you're lucky, your dad died when you were 28, my dad died when I was 7.
[time=1826] You'll get over this, time will heal, time will heal. He says I remember looking into the eyes of those sage wisdom givers thinking you know you're not helping.
[time=1837] This is not how I spell relief. You may be meeting your own need to give words of wisdom but you are not meeting mine.
[time=1845] Conventional comfort givers can't resist the temptation to say something profound. It just makes them feel so much better.
[time=1856] Sound familiar, you're starting to find this sounds a lot like you as I found it sounded a lot like me.
[time=1861] Number four, conventional comfort givers tend to hit and run.
[time=1867] They pay their respects, they say their words, they write their sympathy cards, they send their flowers.
[time=1874] And then they're done. They did the comfort thing.
[time=1879] You see, conventional comfort givers see grief and the offering of comfort as a one time event rather than the prolonged process that it truly is.
[time=1889] If you were to speak with those who have experienced great loss, they would tell you that it is weeks more often months before the reality of the loss takes them to their lowest point, their greatest place of grief.
[time=1902] The greatest apprehension of all that it is, they truly lost.
[time=1906] Most people you and I talk to at funerals aren't near the bottom of the grief curve.
[time=1912] They're working hard, they're trying to give, they're trying to offer things to other people.
[time=1918] They're in denial and it's normal and it's natural and we think that the great moment of crisis is right there at the funeral.
[time=1925] But the great moment of crisis and the great moments of crisis follow like in a methodical beat after the event of the death and they can be intensifying for years until the bottom is reached.
[time=1940] Which means long after the conventional comfort giver has completed his assignment, the bereaved is just hitting stride on real grief.
[time=1951] Number five, conventional caregivers rarely, or excuse me, conventional caregivers really do believe that time will heal.
[time=1963] Conventional caregivers really do believe that time will heal.
[time=1968] The mere marking off of another day on the calendar, think about that, the mere marking off of another day on the calendar will somehow magically heal the enormous loss
[time=1980] in the heart of the bereaved.
[time=1983] Because of that erroneous belief, months later when the conventional caregiver bumps into the once broken-hearted person at the church or at a store somewhere, it is as if the event never happened.
[time=1995] I mean come on, it's been six months now, I'm sure all is well.
[time=1999] I'm sure you've gotten on with life, we don't say these things, we just communicate it with our eyes and with the tone in our voice.
[time=2006] We're sure by now you've learned to bounce back. And we might say something like, it's good to see you again.
[time=2011] So tell me, what's new and exciting in your life? As if to say, let's not go back and deal with those feelings, let's not talk about that stuff, let's not be burdened with that.
[time=2020] I'd much rather prefer a rather positive and forward-looking conversation with you today because you've had time now, you've had six months, twelve months, twenty-four months, and I'm sure by now because time heals, you're all better.
[time=2035] Well, there we are, conventional comfort givers, the wonder-working approach.
[time=2043] We want to replace, excuse me, we want to reduce the emotion, we want to replace the loss, we want to give sage counsel, we want to hit and run, and we want to let time do the healing.
[time=2055] But maybe there's another way, maybe there's a more meaningful way, maybe there's a more significant way, maybe there's a way that God intends for his children to interact with one another at the points of great loss that really represent comforting one another.
[time=2072] I believe there is, and I want to describe it to you, and I must again admit, I don't describe this to you out of my own expertise or marvelous experience, I describe it more by learning about it and seeing it and then longing to be this kind of person and trying to take some growth steps in this direction.
[time=2090] So the time that remains allow me to kind of contrast the approach of conventional comfort with comfort of another kind.
[time=2099] For example, as we noted, conventional comfort asks you to pull your emotions together, enough is enough.
[time=2108] Now listen to this, comfort of another kind says this, no such control over your emotions is necessary.
[time=2115] I love this, you can be out of control, go ahead and grieve, in fact the comfort giver of another kind says now that I am near with you and because you know that I love you irrationally, I give you blanket permission to cry and wail and slobber if you must.
[time=2133] Don't bury anything, don't edit anything, don't sanitize a single thought or feeling, let it out in its raw uncensored form and I won't just tolerate what comes out, I'll honor it.
[time=2146] Let it rip, if it lasts five minutes or if it lasts five hours, if it comes out in ways or if it comes out all at once, if it is mixed with anger and confusion, it doesn't matter because I am here for you and I care for you and I'm going to honor your grief.
[time=2162] Doesn't that sound good? Doesn't that sound how you would want to be treated? Doesn't that sound like the kind of person you would like to be and wouldn't it be exciting if in the moment of grief when we walk in the room something in our demeanor and something in our lips says okay, I'm ready, if you're at this point I'll go anywhere you want to go with your emotions.
[time=2182] I'll be there with you, I will bear your burden and I won't try to fix you and I won't try to correct you and I won't try to straighten you out and I won't try to pull you back together, I'll just be with you, how about that?
[time=2195] How about you lead this thing for me, how about I follow your lead, we'll go wherever your heart sets, I want to learn your real heart, the good and the bad, I want to walk with you and I want to grow with you through this enormous love.
[time=2215] You say now how wise is it to let people emote like that? I mean what in the world doesn't the Bible say to be careful about what we say to other people and shouldn't we try to restrain what they would say so that they don't say things that later would be found contrary to the word of God?
[time=2233] I guess you could take that approach but I noticed when I studied the life of Christ that he was in the premeditated process of asking his disciples questions to surface sinful values.
[time=2245] He was always asking them questions to get what they were thinking that was wrong and sinful and contrary to God's truth up out of their heart and into their mind and out of their mouth so they could see for themselves what's really going on inside.
[time=2261] And it was only then sometimes abruptly and sometimes delayed by months that the Lord would have a chance then to help them deal with the reality of their soul.
[time=2271] I believe you and I should be careful about what we say.
[time=2274] I believe when you and I are administering to other people who are overwhelmed with grief as we would assume roles of helpers and comforters, we need to give people the freedom to say what is really on their heart, bearing their sin, covering their sin and loving them in the midst of whatever might be there.
[time=2290] If you look at Job for example where would we be if Job would never have shared his true heart about what it felt like to lose his kids and his wealth and his herds and all that he had.
[time=2300] And you know if you've read the book of Job the longer he shares the more he begins to get in touch with what he really is feeling.
[time=2306] He evidences an enormous commitment to say what he really feels about God and what he really says and feels about God is sinful.
[time=2315] He calls God unjust and he calls God unfair and he beckons God to submit himself to a courtroom with an impartial judge where Job could bring his case against God.
[time=2328] Think about that.
[time=2330] Why does the Scripture allow us to see into the hearts of these men?
[time=2334] Job you remember was considered a righteous man because hard times come and when hard times come and the superficial commitments that we have in our life are stripped away
[time=2344] and we're really hurting and we're really in pain we are in incredibly teachable moments.
[time=2349] And things can surface in those times that tell us more about what we think about God and what we think about each other and what we think about his word than when things are calm and tranquil.
[time=2358] That's what James says.
[time=2359] Considered all joy when you fall into a various trial knowing that and here comes the maturing process that follows.
[time=2367] I believe that God would long for us to be the kind of comfort givers that are more committed to the person who's hurting than we are staying inside of our own emotional boundaries.
[time=2378] So next time you face that awesome responsibility of having to bring comfort.
[time=2382] A comforting love to someone who has a broken heart please remember you serve them best by liberating them to grieve fully and deeply and chaotically if need be.
[time=2394] Remind yourself that weeping is the language of the soul and that it is a critical part of the healing process and the sooner the heart broken person is able to get the sorrow out no matter how messy it gets the sooner true healing can follow.
[time=2411] Secondly in our contrast conventional comfort is committed to replacing the loss as soon as possible to fill the void to patch the hole to reduce the pain.
[time=2425] But comfort givers of another kind know that's not God's way.
[time=2431] Comfort givers of another kind follow God's lead again when they understand that God is not committed to filling all the holes and patching all the tears and reducing all the pain.
[time=2442] In fact if you were to go back into the Old Testament you would know and learn that God had a very formalized process in which to grieve.
[time=2450] And it could take months and there were sorrowing disciplines to be followed clothing to be eaten and food to be worn and places reserved for the purpose of contemplating the enormous loss that had just been sustained.
[time=2464] Ways to gather friends and family to mourn with them and God is unequivocally in the Old Testament urging people not to move on in their lives prematurely trying to prohibit people from glossing over and running from the lessons that are to be learned through sustaining great loss.
[time=2489] This is a time for enormous self assessment, assessment of personal goals, assessment for meaning of life, assessment about the big choices that are to be made and people in this grieving process stand at a crossroads.
[time=2502] And they inevitably make a decision to continue to submit their lives to a God who has allowed them to be painfully hurt and deeply wounded.
[time=2512] And their faith in these times will emerge stronger and more powerful even as we sang this morning like C. Billow's roll or they will quietly and defiantly say that's it.
[time=2525] I will now take control of my life on my own.
[time=2530] I'm not denouncing God.
[time=2533] I'm not saying I'm denouncing Christ but in the quiet recesses of my heart I am taking control of my life.
[time=2541] You see this is the substance, the underneath substance in the grief process.
[time=2548] This is why it's so critical we allow ourselves to hear, understand and care about what they are really thinking and really saying.
[time=2556] This is why it's so important we don't promote them to replace that loss with something else because the thing that God would bring out of that is character and commitment and faith and obedience against all the odds.
[time=2570] And we are comfort givers of another kind when we understand those dynamics are patient with those dynamics and move skillfully into the life of the one who is hurting.
[time=2585] Number three, the third step in conventional wisdom is what we called sage counsel, that irresistible need to say something profound to someone who is hurting.
[time=2598] People who hurt this way would tell you that it's very difficult to tune in to sage wisdom at some of these points of grief.
[time=2607] They might say to you this is neither the time or the place to be saying these kinds of things to me I appreciate your heart. I know you mean well but this is neither the time nor the place when my heart and my mind is flooded with sorrow.
[time=2620] Now listen to this please, comfort of another kind is more committed to communicating the fact that I am with you.
[time=2628] Listen to that, I am with you, I am committed to you, your loss is my loss.
[time=2635] Your treasure that has been lost was one of my treasures and I know what it feels like for you to lose your treasure because to some degree maybe not as strong, maybe not as powerfully but I need to let you know that I've lost this treasure with you.
[time=2650] And this person was important to me as well. I remember speaking with a friend who had just received the knowledge that his dad, his dearly beloved father had died.
[time=2661] And it was a long distance situation, there was no place for him immediately to go and so in the numbness of the moment he followed his schedule and found himself shortly after receiving this news in a public place, a restaurant.
[time=2673] And as he walked through the door to the restaurant he noticed that everybody was going around and on with their life as if his dad hadn't died.
[time=2683] They were laughing, they were joking, they were ordering, they were talking, they were doing what they were doing and he wanted to stop and scream out to everyone.
[time=2690] Wait a minute here, you can't go on living like this, my dad just died. There is a profound longing in the heart of the grieved to know that others sense a loss that is significant, that is halting, that is impactful, that matters to them, that they are not alone in their assessment of the value of the one they have lost.
[time=2714] So you say well then what do I say? If it isn't sage counsel what do I say? Well let me give you five things that I think you can say that are helpful, that do communicate I am with you as opposed to get fixed, stop feeling these emotions.
[time=2733] Try this one on, first of all I am sorry. You will find that as you embrace the one who is grieving words that will mean the most to them are very simply I am sorry I am so sorry this happened.
[time=2751] Not very profound is it? Just a communication of the very things we are talking about, I am sorry.
[time=2760] A second thing that often comes out of the mouths of comfort givers of another kind is this I don't know.
[time=2766] I don't know why your daughter got leukemia. I don't know why some get 80 years and your husband got 40.
[time=2774] I don't know why the drunk hit your son and not mine. I don't know. You don't know. We don't know. And right now we don't have to know.
[time=2787] I am sorry I am so sorry. I don't know.
[time=2792] A third thing that tends to come out of the mouths of comfort givers is this God cares.
[time=2797] God has committed to you. God is as committed to you today as he was the day before this tragedy began. God loves you. God cherishes you.
[time=2806] I have found in my own heart and the hearts of those I am close to that when calamity invades our life the knee jerk reaction is to say I brought this on myself somehow.
[time=2816] Somehow or another this is my fault. Somehow or another this is my sin.
[time=2820] Somehow or another this is God paying me back for something I did. Some deed I failed to do. Some level of commitment I failed to achieve.
[time=2827] This is my fault. And a comfort giver of another kind reassures. Well sometimes that may be the case.
[time=2833] In the vast preponderance of situations the reality is God is totally committed to you. He cares about you.
[time=2843] The fourth thing that often comes out of the mouth of a comfort giver is this can I serve you in any way?
[time=2850] Can I get you some food? Can I cut the lawn? Can I do the laundry? Can the car be washed and gassed?
[time=2856] An effective comfort givers oftentimes never have to say that or ask that question because they are already perceiving those real physical tangible needs and without request and without drawing attention themselves and without getting in the way they are busily and quietly resolving the issues.
[time=2872] And as I say it's not with a heart to quiet somebody down. It's not can I offer you food so you'll stop crying.
[time=2879] It's just a heart attitude and a disposition and awareness that there are some needs that are going to be needed to take care of in the face of this calamity. Can I help?
[time=2888] A fifth thing that often comes out of the mouth of a comforter of another kind is I love you.
[time=2895] I love you. I am amazed. I continue to be amazed at the great number of people. Many of you are here today who never had anybody say they love you.
[time=2906] Who never had anybody look you in the eye and say I love you to the core of my being. I love you.
[time=2911] Your dad didn't do that. Your mother didn't do that. People that should have done that never did that to you and so you don't even know how to say those words yourself.
[time=2921] Well if there was ever a time to break out of that kind of a thing. If there was ever a time to say in very clear terms I love you. This is the time.
[time=2933] There's a loss. There's a sense of vacuum that fills the bereaved heart as the awareness of all that has lost dawns on his consciousness, dawns on her consciousness.
[time=2944] And nothing you and I will ever do or say will ever fix all that, patch all that and change all that. And any effort to fix all that and change all that is probably manipulation on our part.
[time=2956] But don't underestimate while all that is true the power of the commitment to say I love you and mean it from your heart.
[time=2964] To the one who is hurting. Well, where once we would reduce emotion we strive now to honor their grief.
[time=2977] Where once we would quickly work to replace their loss and talk them of better days that are coming and assure them that everything will be better in the future.
[time=2985] We move into their loss and help them learn from it and grow from it and build character through it.
[time=2991] Where once we were quick to offer sage counsel we now desire to give ourselves true wisdom giving ourselves the love that comes from our heart.
[time=3002] Fourthly, conventional approach to comfort is to hit and run. Make your visit, write your card, do your deed.
[time=3010] Love of another kind stays. Not all at once and not for too long.
[time=3017] Love of another kind continues to return, continues to come back. It stays with the person. It keeps asking about how that person is feeling about life.
[time=3026] Ask about what it was like to go to sleep last night. What it was like not to be able to go to sleep last night.
[time=3030] What it was like not to be able to stay asleep that night. What it was like not to be able to sleep until the appointed time to wake up.
[time=3036] What it was like never to hear your alarm clock because you're already always up.
[time=3041] What it's like to go to work. What it's like to see people that you want to give things to but don't have the emotional resources to give to them.
[time=3048] What it's like to watch them as they scurry out of your way or quietly try to remove themselves from your presence because they don't know what to do with you.
[time=3056] What is life like says the comfort giver of another kind.
[time=3069] Comfort givers of another kind say you know what if we're going to move forward from here it's going to take a new approach.
[time=3076] It's going to be a little bit different than it was in the past.
[time=3079] Long after the initial wave of emotion has passed when the sobering reality of everyday life has set in they will plan to be together, to talk together, to eat together, to share life together.
[time=3093] Comfort givers of another kind don't hit and run.
[time=3098] They stay for the long haul.
[time=3102] Number five, conventional comfort tells us that time heals everything.
[time=3111] Comfort giver of another kind never assumes that time and time alone will heal anything.
[time=3118] The comfort giver of another kind never assumes that well pretty soon everything will be back to normal.
[time=3123] That's a key phrase everything will be back to normal.
[time=3127] I know that when I am involved with people who are grieving I long for things to be back to normal.
[time=3132] I want to get back to places that are normal. I don't like the uncertainty and the differences that exist in this relationship at this point.
[time=3140] But I've got to be honest with you to say this a comfort giver of another kind becomes aware of the fact and begins to understand that those who have suffered true loss may never be normal again in terms of what they were.
[time=3156] Situation may never go back to normal and that isn't necessarily bad.
[time=3162] They as they grow through that as they change as values change as new things surface as priorities in their life as new ways of doing life begin to emerge that are direct results of the grief and the trauma and of God working through that situation.
[time=3175] We would have to recognize there's a new phase of life and the old phase of life may never return.
[time=3182] What used to be normal may never return again and that's okay.
[time=3187] We'll just need to learn to live together in this new phase in this different way the way that you are different and the way that life is different.
[time=3195] True comfort givers seek to understand and nurture those never normal again parts.
[time=3202] Jerry Slitzer who's an author writes about what happened to him with the loss of his mother his wife and his daughter they died in a horrible accident.
[time=3211] He says this I did not go through pain and come out the other side.
[time=3216] I learned to live in it sorrow took up permanent residency in my soul and enlarged it.
[time=3222] The deeper we experience suffering the deeper we enter a new and different life.
[time=3227] It is not the case that we become less through loss loss can often make us much more sorrow can lead us to simpler lives less cluttered with non essentials sorrow can produce compassion and sensitivity
[time=3240] and can inspire people to express more affection to their family and friends and show more concern for concerned for wounded people.
[time=3248] He says I always want the ones I lost back again but I do celebrate the life I have found because they are gone.
[time=3256] I have lost but I have also gained and what I have gained is grace God's grace and that grace has enabled me to clarify my purpose in life discover the wonder of the present moments in life and it has enlarged my soul.
[time=3275] Well what do you say I mean what do you say as a group of believers as a church of people with a light precious faith we cast off the superficial often self protective and manipulative ways of offering conventional comfort.
[time=3297] And what do you say we take some bold and scary steps into comfort of another kind.
[time=3303] And I would hasten to add that what we're talking about here and comfort of another kind is not offered as yet another recipe or another way to approach this which will ultimately lead to the fixing of your friend or your spouse or whoever it is that's grieving.
[time=3319] Again that is not your job and that is not the goal the goal is to effectively comfort and love the one who grieves and where it goes is up to the Lord.
[time=3333] Let me invite you to stand now for a closing word prayer.
[time=3341] I bet most of us are drawn to this comfort of another kind scared to death but drawn to it.
[time=3349] You know I don't believe that God wants each and every person in this church to offer that level of comfort and love to every single other person in this church.
[time=3358] I think it would be wrong for us to try to be that level of loving friend to everyone we know.
[time=3366] At the same time we probably have a sense of those people in our family and our friendship groups where that comfort of another kind is not only appropriate it just seems what God would have us to do.
[time=3380] And I'm inviting you right now in the privacy of this moment to reflect upon that group of friends that close family and friends thing and maybe some of these friends are unbelievers.
[time=3392] Maybe some of these family members are unbelievers.
[time=3396] I just want to say to you that as you go through this little list what it isn't and what it ought to be.
[time=3404] It's never too late you know I mean it's never too late to recognize oh my goodness I've been a conventional caregiver.
[time=3412] It's never too late to reassert in your heart to move forward in the relationship with that grieving person in more powerful and meaningful ways.
[time=3423] And maybe you would write a letter maybe you would take them to coffee and maybe you would just spend some time with them and I don't suggest you dump this whole load on them at once either.
[time=3433] Maybe you just try to apply one of one of these approaches one of these points of giving this kind of care and see where it takes you.
[time=3442] But I trust you'll make a decision today about that because these people are hurting and they're alone and God has designed you with the stuff to make a difference in their life.
[time=3456] Our Heavenly Father as we study this subject of love of another kind it takes us into many different arenas.
[time=3463] And we learn Lord that you have great and awesome plans for us that you have made us people with a noble purpose.
[time=3472] And it's not about our wealth and it's not about our talents and it's not about our looks and it's not about our intelligence and it's not about those kinds of things which the world seems to value so highly.
[time=3484] What you value and the impact you give us which is far more significant than any of those other things can make is the power of love.
[time=3493] The power of love of another kind.
[time=3496] And so again we feel humbled before you.
[time=3499] We feel failures in this great arena of love.
[time=3503] But we trust you hear our hearts we trust you sense that there's something in us that wants to be this way and we ask you God to empower us to be making the choices that allow us to invest in others.
[time=3518] We love you and praise you in Christ's name and all God's people said.
[time=3522] Amen God bless you.
