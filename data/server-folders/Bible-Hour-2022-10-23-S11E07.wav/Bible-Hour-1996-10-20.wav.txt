[time=30] If we could roll the videotape of your life forward to where you had but one hour to live
[time=48] and I came to visit you in the hospital bed and I was to ask you the question, tell me about the high points of your life.
[time=56] Tell me about the really enriched moments.
[time=59] My prediction is that you would not tell me about the time you bought that brand new '67 Camaro.
[time=65] My prediction is you would not tell me about the day you closed escrow on your first little starter house with your spouse or got the promotion you'd worked so hard to achieve at work.
[time=76] My guess is this, you're going to say something like "I remember that one Christmas and everybody
[time=84] was home and nobody was fighting and it was just like being in heaven."
[time=92] Others are going to say "I remember the summer vacations that we took with my family.
[time=96] We camped at that same lake year after year after year after year and the memories and
[time=102] the experiences mounded up on each other."
[time=108] On the flip side if I were to ask you in that one hour before you were to die to look back over your life and I were to say to you tell me about the worst times.
[time=115] Tell me about the darkest moments.
[time=118] Tell me about the most painful things that happened to you.
[time=123] I don't think it would be the day that the '67 Camaro got a ding in the side door.
[time=129] I don't think it'd be about the time that you missed the promotion that you'd been working to achieve.
[time=134] My guess is you'd be going back to the important relationships in your life that blew up on
[time=146] you.
[time=147] This is the Sunday Morning Worship Service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=151] Thank you for joining us.
[time=152] In a short on the street interviews a high percentage of people said that the leading cause relationships fail is because of lack of trust.
[time=160] What do you think?
[time=161] Today Pastor Moore talks to us about when love breaks down a look at personal relationships.
[time=166] Now let's join our service.
[time=191] In your hard times too.
[time=195] Why couldn't we begin with love again?
[time=200] Try to mend a broken heart or two.
[time=205] United we stand, divided we fall.
[time=211] We will live or die together, the same for one and all.
[time=217] We stand together and defend this love without end and we'll honor God forever, together.
[time=235] I need your assurance, just like you need mine all there's just no way to win when we're
[time=244] fighting all the time, got a problem.
[time=249] Well it's up to you and I too talk it out, talk it out, work it out, work it out, however
[time=257] long it takes cause you died and we stand, divided we fall.
[time=265] We will live or die together, the same for one and all, together and defend this love
[time=274] without end and we'll honor God forever, together, you are.
[time=304] Take a look around you if you think you're alright.
[time=311] Oh you've got a mornin' out so warm just down a sight.
[time=317] Oh I can reach out to you now, you can reach back to them.
[time=323] You can be alright, be alright, I'm a fight.
[time=326] Oh we'll all find a way, we stand divided we fall.
[time=334] We will live or die together, the same for one and all.
[time=339] We stand together and defend this love without end and we'll honor God forever, together.
[time=350] We stand divided we fall, we will live or die together, the same for one and all, together
[time=364] defend this love without end and we'll honor God forever, together we will stay.
[time=374] Well would you care to order now or you want to wait a little while?
[time=385] My sisters fly to arrive 20 minutes in scope, she should be here by now.
[time=391] Is this the only coffee shop on this concourse?
[time=394] Yes it is.
[time=396] She insisted that I meet her here but I think I should have gone to the gate anyway.
[time=401] She probably got turned around.
[time=403] Oh I'm sure she'll find her way.
[time=405] I suppose.
[time=407] Would you bring me an iced tea and why don't you bring my sister one too?
[time=412] Okay, two iced teas.
[time=416] Okay Peg, I'll give you three more minutes before I have you paged.
[time=422] Maybe she changed her flight so she didn't have to see me.
[time=434] Peg, oh Peg, I am so glad you're here.
[time=438] I was so worried about you.
[time=440] Worried?
[time=441] Well yeah, your flight arrived 20 minutes ago.
[time=444] Well it feels like about five miles of concourse between here and the plan.
[time=448] I should have met you at the gate like I wanted to.
[time=451] Nonsense, I'm a big girl now, I can find my way around oh here.
[time=455] Oh I suppose.
[time=457] Peg it is so good to see you and you look great.
[time=462] You look good too.
[time=464] Oh Peg, I have missed you so much.
[time=468] Oh here, I got you something.
[time=473] Thanks Len.
[time=475] I never could resist flowers.
[time=477] Don't I know it.
[time=479] I can't count the number of times you went to that vacant lot down the street.
[time=483] And you cut down every single wildflower.
[time=487] Remember the time when I tried to make the world's biggest bouquet?
[time=491] Yeah poor Mrs. Winkler.
[time=494] She never was very happy about finding all of her geraniums missing from the front porch.
[time=500] First you and now Megan.
[time=502] You know she's crazy about flowers too.
[time=505] She is.
[time=506] How is she?
[time=507] Oh she's doing great.
[time=509] Look I brought some pictures.
[time=511] You will not believe how much she's changed.
[time=514] This is Megan.
[time=515] I never would have recognized her.
[time=518] Kids change a lot in a year and a half.
[time=521] Has it been that long?
[time=524] Work keeps me so busy I hardly know what month it is anymore.
[time=528] Now you are still with that consulting firm right?
[time=531] I'm still consulting but I left the company a year ago.
[time=536] Oh why didn't you tell me?
[time=538] I thought I did.
[time=541] Oh it gets so hectic.
[time=543] Tonight I'm in LA and tomorrow night Denver.
[time=547] I had no idea you were freelancing.
[time=550] Seems like you would remember to let your family know a thing like that.
[time=554] I told you Lynn I've been very busy.
[time=557] Even too busy to send a letter once in a while.
[time=561] Lynn what is this?
[time=562] I've only been here a couple of minutes and I'm already feeling attacked.
[time=567] Okay here's your iced tea.
[time=571] Thank you.
[time=572] See your sister made it?
[time=573] Yes.
[time=574] I'd like a coke please.
[time=576] But your sister ordered you an iced tea.
[time=579] I'd rather have a coke.
[time=581] Would you take it back?
[time=582] No just leave the tea please.
[time=585] Thanks.
[time=587] I thought we'd drink tea together like we used to.
[time=590] I don't like iced tea.
[time=592] Oh sure you do.
[time=593] I used to make tea for you all the time.
[time=595] I never liked iced tea.
[time=599] I'm sorry.
[time=601] I was just trying to be thoughtful.
[time=603] I'm old enough to order for myself.
[time=606] I know that.
[time=607] It's from the moment I got here.
[time=609] It's been Peg you should have let me meet you at the gate.
[time=613] Peg you should have told me you changed jobs.
[time=616] Peg you should write more often.
[time=618] Peg drink iced tea.
[time=622] You're mothering me.
[time=624] Mothering you?
[time=625] Yes mothering me.
[time=627] Aren't you being just a little over sensitive?
[time=630] Over sensitive.
[time=632] Lynn.
[time=634] Oh just skip it.
[time=640] So how is Tom's firm doing?
[time=644] Oh no you don't.
[time=646] You're not going to avoid this.
[time=648] I want to know what you're talking about.
[time=651] I'm tired of you always trying to tell me what to do.
[time=655] You've been doing it ever since mother died.
[time=658] I'm telling you what to do.
[time=661] I was forced to raise you.
[time=664] You pushed and pushed on me to be just how you wanted.
[time=668] Because you were too quiet, too isolated.
[time=671] I sacrificed a great deal so you could have a role model.
[time=676] Someone to emulate, someone to respect.
[time=679] You needed someone to control.
[time=681] I did not.
[time=682] Peg you look sickly.
[time=684] Eat your dinner.
[time=686] Peg your hair looks ugly.
[time=688] Let me fix it the right way.
[time=690] Someday Peg maybe you'll grow up to be just like me.
[time=698] I was only 14 when mom died.
[time=701] And you were just a kid.
[time=703] I helped you the only way I knew how.
[time=706] You can't blame me for that.
[time=709] So what's your excuse for Ron?
[time=712] You're not going to bring that up again.
[time=714] I wasn't a kid then.
[time=715] Oh you were acting like one.
[time=717] I was 20 years old.
[time=718] And loved.
[time=719] And ready to quit college and marry him.
[time=722] So you took charge and drove him away.
[time=726] I was protecting you.
[time=728] You were controlling me.
[time=732] Losing Ron wrapped my life.
[time=737] Wrapped your life.
[time=740] Aren't you being a little overdramatic?
[time=744] Look at you.
[time=746] You have a great life.
[time=748] You're successful.
[time=750] You're in demand.
[time=752] I'm alone.
[time=754] The only friends I have are the people I work for.
[time=759] And they hardly make up for going home to an empty house.
[time=765] And you're blaming me for that too.
[time=768] Peg you wouldn't be so lonely.
[time=771] You visit your family more often than once every year and a half.
[time=775] And then when you do, it's a 30 minute layover in the middle of one of the busiest airports in the world.
[time=785] Look Lynn, we aren't getting anywhere with this.
[time=789] I have some calls to make before my plane leaves.
[time=792] I need to be going.
[time=797] Okay, I'll tell Megan you said hi.
[time=801] Are you going to be coming through again soon?
[time=806] I try to avoid all hair as often as I can.
[time=825] Lack of trust and lack of communication.
[time=828] I would say it's mostly being dishonest with each other or not having the respect for one another.
[time=836] Well, influence from friends.
[time=839] Peer group, you know, it's just, you see people and the children are affected.
[time=846] And I don't know how people are so selfish that they don't realize it's not their lives.
[time=851] You know, just, you know, talk it over.
[time=854] Oh, if it's lacking trust and honesty and lack of moral principles, I think.
[time=861] Also, undo it completely.
[time=864] Most of the time it's distrust.
[time=866] A lot of relationships break up over money, you know, stuff like that.
[time=870] But I've been married for 20 years and one thing we don't argue about is money.
[time=877] So, you know, and we trust each other.
[time=880] Well, I think the first one would be lack of trust.
[time=884] If you lose trust in your relationship, then I don't think you have a relationship.
[time=888] I think lack of attention, maintenance of the relationship.
[time=895] People feel loved when others give up their time and attention, you know, being a good listener.
[time=905] I think if you start mistrusting and, well, another one is really communicating.
[time=913] If you can't communicate there, you know, that's another one that would do it.
[time=919] Lack of trust and if one, one of the partners is not willing to work at it, to keep it going.
[time=930] Lack of trust, lack of understanding.
[time=934] My personal opinion, a good religious background, both people having that.
[time=939] I would say that's the major reasons.
[time=942] Well, I had one of those unbelievable moments, just about the end of August.
[time=948] My eldest daughter, Randy, who is a sophomore in high school, elected to ask,
[time=955] and we granted permission for her to go out and do that first quarter, the one she's just finishing right now out in the Santa Fe Valley where Heidi and I grew up.
[time=963] And attending the same high school, living with my brother-in-law and sister, and Heidi's folks are there, and my folks are there, so both set to grandparents, and she's just having a phenomenal time, looking forward to coming home next week.
[time=973] But in August, I was out on other business and had the opportunity to spend some time with her.
[time=980] And it just worked perfectly.
[time=982] My sister said, you know, you've never taken Randy, and she hasn't yet seen our ranch.
[time=987] They have a house, but then they have this ranch, and we just got two brand new four-wheel drive, kind of motorcycle things, and you too can just go out there and have a great time.
[time=995] And I looked at her, and her eyes were full of anticipation, which, of course, meant the world to me.
[time=999] Unfortunately, nobody else said we'll go to, which is very rare, so we jumped in the car and got out there, just about four, four, 30 in the afternoon, and we hit those things and cranked them up, and it took her no time at all to learn how they work.
[time=1011] And before I knew it, she was, you know, breakneck speed off through the prairies, and I was trying to kind of keep up with her.
[time=1017] And as I'm running behind her, I'm realizing, you know, this is amazing.
[time=1020] This is how I grew up.
[time=1022] I grew up on motorcycles, and I grew up with permission to drive on somebody else's ranch, and the smells were the same, and the birds were the same, and the trees were the same, and everything looked the same, and it was kind of this weird deal.
[time=1033] I mean, here we are, unexpectedly, she's getting to live what was such a major part of my life, and I had not even to this date described that part of my life to her.
[time=1041] And she was eating it up, and we were over here and over there, and finally we started to ascend up this mountain and got to the top kind of of their ranch, and came over to the edge of the vista, and just looked down at the cattle, and the green trees, and the river, and just, I mean, it was absolutely spectacular.
[time=1057] Now about 5.30 at night, and the colors are turning those rich colors, and we turned the motorcycles off, and we just sat up there and began to talk, and she began asking me questions about my growing up, and what it was like, and it was just so rich.
[time=1070] We even had a cellular phone with us, and she said, "Let's call Mom." We dialed out to Indiana and had Mom a part of the whole thing, and we kind of finished up and made our way back, and had a long drive back to finally get where you leave these things, and as we were doing that, I was saying to myself, "This is it, and this is it. Life doesn't get any better." This is one of those things, one of those idyllic father-daughter experiences, and I just remember tucking it away in my cherished collection of unforgettable experiences.
[time=1102] If we can roll the videotape forward on your life, and you now have an hour to live, and you're in a hospital bed, and you know you have an hour to live, and if I were able to come and visit you there and ask you the question, what were the high points of your life?
[time=1117] I mean, what were the really enriched moments?
[time=1120] I've got a prediction that you're not going to say, "Oh, it's back in 1967 when I got to buy that first brand new car." Such an exciting moment. That's the highlight for me.
[time=1129] I was not going to say, "Oh, it was the day we closed escrow in our first little starter house."
[time=1135] You're probably not going to talk about that promotion you've been working to achieve and finally had in your grasp.
[time=1141] I don't think that's what's going to be coming to your mind.
[time=1143] I think you're going to be saying things like, "Oh, I'll tell you what." I remember that one Christmas that everybody was able to be there
[time=1151] and nobody was fighting over anything, and it just seemed to happen that particular Christmas.
[time=1158] You might say, "You know, it was those summer vacations.
[time=1161] My mom and dad made sure we had that same week of the summer.
[time=1165] We went to that same lake, we camped by that same tree, and it just seemed like every year we went back, it got better and better and better and better." I think the flip side is also true.
[time=1176] If I were to ask you with just one hour left and you're surveying what has happened in life and I were to say to you, what have been the worst times of your life?
[time=1184] What have been the most painful times of your life?
[time=1187] Where have the darkest points been?
[time=1190] You're probably not going to say all the day we had to get rid of that first brand new car, or the day we moved out of our starter house, or the day that I missed that incredible promotion I've been hoping so much to get.
[time=1202] My guess is your darkest moments are going to be around the relationships that were important to you, that blew up.
[time=1209] The day you got the divorce papers.
[time=1212] The day one of your children stormed out the door, and though they came back physically, you don't think they ever really came back emotionally and relationally to you.
[time=1222] For the last several weeks we've been in a series called "Love of Another Kind." We've been working from the premise that the greatest reality in all of life, the most meaningful experiences that any human being will ever have are not bound up in things.
[time=1238] They're not the tangible stuff that we can hold and touch and buy and purchase.
[time=1244] We're working from the premise that the greatest experiences of life are the giving and receiving of this love of another kind.
[time=1251] It says in Psalm 133 verse 1, "Behold," I mean it's a declaration, "Wow, how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity."
[time=1263] There's something that happens when people get together and they're dwelling together and it's bound up in unity of heart and mind and soul and purpose that somehow transcends all the other experiences of life.
[time=1277] And when those things fall apart and when those things are devastated, there's a pain that comes that somehow is equally as penetrating and piercing and as detestable as any other kind of pain that life knows to offer.
[time=1291] And this morning as we close our series out, I want to go right to the heart of the matter.
[time=1297] And I want to just have us all kind of face the fact that relationships are prone to break.
[time=1303] Relationships are prone to shatter and disintegrate and blow up and fall apart, sometimes slowly little pieces over time and sometimes all at once.
[time=1313] And the question that I want you to ask yourself this morning is, "Who do I need to be to experience relationship to the fullest?" I mean, when love breaks down, why does it break down and what has happened and who can I become to put myself in the best position to experience the real rush of life, meaningful relationship?
[time=1331] And you might ask a secondary kind of a question, kind of a twin question, a corollary question, which is what kind of a person should I look for?
[time=1339] I mean, should I base the analysis on personality or hobbies that we share or background experiences that are similar?
[time=1348] What am I looking for when I'm looking for the kind of person that I want to build lifelong, meaningful relationship with, whether it's a spouse or just a friend?
[time=1358] Well, I've got a one-word answer for you to both questions.
[time=1363] A one-word answer, and it may sound strange to you at first, but I think by the time we're done you're going to understand why it's the answer I'm giving.
[time=1371] I believe as you ask yourself, "Who do I need to be to experience relationship with the fullest?" And what kind of person should I be looking for to experience relationship with the fullest? The one-word answer is broken.
[time=1383] You need to be a broken person, and the person you seek needs to be a broken person. What do I mean?
[time=1391] The Bible says that people are selfish, that from the very get-go, from the very beginning something inside of us is sour, and it says this, "I'm a selfish person. I want what I want.
[time=1403] I can be consumed with the things that I think I need." It also says that we're proud people, which just means that we labor under the misconception that our wants and desires are the most important, that ours are more important than somebody else's.
[time=1419] And you know this from your experience, and I certainly know this from my experience, that if you try to build a lifelong, meaningful relationship with a person who has not been broken in the categories of selfishness and pride, you are sitting on a relational time bump. And it may, excuse me, it may work for a while. You may have some common experiences. You may have some kind of coincidental, meaningful interactions because what you were selfishly pursuing, and they were selfishly pursuing, could coexist for a period of time, but you will eventually find out that unless you are broken, unless they are broken, your relationship will blow up.
[time=1459] Then where you had hoped to find meaning and purpose and satisfaction and joy, kind of being surprised and shocked by all that relationships can give, you will be equally shocked inversely by the pain that it ushers into your life.
[time=1475] So on this theme of brokenness, I want to just talk about four kinds of brokenness. Four kinds of brokenness that should characterize you and me. Four kinds of brokenness that should characterize the other person if you really want to move towards meaningful relationship.
[time=1491] The first one, first kind of brokenness, I call genuine brokenness over personal sin. A genuine brokenness over your personal sin.
[time=1503] I'll tell you what, I want to be in relationship with a person who is able to freely admit to himself and to me and to God that he or she is a sinner. I'm ready to be in relationship with people who can say that about themselves before God and before me and before other people.
[time=1520] In Isaiah chapter 6 verse 5, a man is making that kind of unabashed declaration of his own personal sin. He says this, "Woe is me for I am ruined because I am a man of unclean lips and I live among a people of unclean lips for my eyes have seen the king of hosts." What's he saying? This man happens to be a prophet. He speaks for a living and he speaks the oracles of God. But when he gets a clear perspective on how holy God is, he has this spontaneous confession of his own personal sin. And he says, "You know, the best thing about me is my lips. That's what I use to speak the oracles of God. I am a man of unclean lips. Even the best thing about me is sinful in a certain way." The beginning of genuine and powerful and meaningful relationships is when two people hook up together who have a genuine brokenness over personal sin. Now that might sound negative to you or critical, but consider the alternative. Consider the alternative.
[time=1580] You are either, you are either genuinely broken over your personal sin or you are, you are the other. You're the kind of person who when you violate somebody else, you excuse yourself.
[time=1592] You find a way to justify what you have done.
[time=1596] You blame the other person for their part and try to get them in the mix with you in terms of whose fault this is.
[time=1604] And you tend to mitigate your offense. You tend to try to say what I did wasn't really all that bad. That is the alternative.
[time=1612] People are in one group or the other group. People either have genuine brokenness over personal sin, they stand up, they take responsibility for what they do, or the other alternative is they tend to excuse themselves, blame other people, and mitigate their offense. I'll tell you what I want to do. When I'm in relationship with somebody and that person runs me over, that person crashes into me, that person violates me, and you and I know that's going to happen until we die.
[time=1636] There is no possible way to avoid the breakdown of love. That is going to happen. The only issue that's open to us is what are we going to do with the breakdowns?
[time=1644] And I can tell you that when that happens to me, I don't want that, I feel infuriated and I feel further violated when that person excuses their behavior, tries to justify it, tries to rationalize it, tries to give me the 27 reasons why it happened. I feel further violated when they start the point of the shortcomings that I might have had in the situation.
[time=1664] And often I do. And I become infuriated when they try to redefine what they actually said or what they actually meant as they mitigate their offense against me.
[time=1676] I want to be in relationship with somebody who just stands up and takes responsibility.
[time=1680] You know what? What I did was selfish. What I did was wrong.
[time=1684] What I did violated you. Please forgive me.
[time=1688] Now you know what? I can be in relationship with somebody like that really easily because I can trust that person and I can respect that person deep down inside. But when that person comes up with excuses and blame shifting and mitigating offenses, I say to myself I'm not sure I can trust you with this part of my life. I'm not sure I can let you be that meaningful to me anymore because you just don't get it what you've done here. And if you can do that to me this time, you can do that to me next time. And I just assume back away from you a little bit.
[time=1720] Interesting week for me. My lovely wife who thankfully now is home. Praise God. Went to California for a week.
[time=1728] It's a wonderful opportunity. We try to have for her to go out to California, visit her family and what not in this time. Of course she saw Randy as well and she was gone for seven long days.
[time=1736] Torturous days. The week turned into one long day for me.
[time=1740] By the end of it, I was not doing well.
[time=1744] I made some really bad choices this week because I failed to tell my secretary to back off my schedule down to like a more normal week. And so I had a lot of early morning meetings.
[time=1752] I had a lot of late night meetings. And then of course I'm running these kids here and hither and yawn and trying to work out this and that meal and this thing and that thing over there. And Bobby just wet his pants again and all that kind of stuff's going on. And then the Lord did some things to me this week.
[time=1764] I mean he brought some heavy weight issues right into my life.
[time=1768] All of them that were relating to people in this church and some of them were relating to other people outside the state and they were the kind of issues that just drain you emotionally.
[time=1776] They sap all that you've got and they're high priority issues. You can't say we'll get to it next week. And so the combination of the whole thing just absolutely was overwhelming and I was out of gas. And all week long, Nikki, who is in the seventh grade, she's the reigning princess of the house now that Randy's out of the house. And I'll tell you what, she was phenomenal.
[time=1796] All week long, helping. All week long serving. All week long anticipating.
[time=1800] All week long doing a little something extra. I mean it was amazing how she performed and just expressed love inside the house. I was so proud of her.
[time=1808] Coming about the last day, you know. And I'm feeling a lot of pressure, get this done, get this done, get that done.
[time=1812] I say to her before I leave for an evening thing I got to go do. I say now make sure you do this and this by the time I get home. She said I got it, no problem.
[time=1820] I go, I do my thing, I come home and this and this did not get done. And Nikki's on the phone talking to one of her junior high friends laughing and giggling.
[time=1828] You know what you should have been working? You get what I'm saying here.
[time=1832] Yeah, you're getting the feel. That's exactly how it felt. It was worse.
[time=1836] I say, "Hey, time out on the phone, hang up." Not like finish up in a couple minutes, just time out on the phone, hang up. I thought I told you to get these chores done. I thought I said we had to have that done before I get home. I told you mom, "Mom, come home, want this place nice and clean, what in the world are you doing?" And you know something that bothers me that you're not having that stuff done because I've been noticing some things in you. You've been kind of procrastinating lately. You haven't been all that you normally are.
[time=1856] And I think you could do better. And I'm just, I got a lot of horsepower coming her way and a lot of anger and a lot of energy that she doesn't deserve.
[time=1864] And her poor little countenance, man. She just shrinks under all that. And I walk away and she gets busy on her stuff and then the Holy Spirit kind of does a partial conviction thing on me. I'm sort of convicted.
[time=1880] So, so I go back and I say this to her.
[time=1884] I say, "You know what?
[time=1888] I hope you didn't take what I was saying wrong to you." Nice, mitigating move there.
[time=1896] I really didn't mean, you know, quite, I hope it didn't come across any harder than I meant it.
[time=1902] And I hope you understand, Nikki, it's just been a really hard week for me. You know, mom's been gone.
[time=1906] I gave her all the excuses I just gave you a few minutes ago about, you know, the schedule and about some big issues going on.
[time=1910] I'm just milking that for all I can milk. And then I say, but, you know, I really am concerned about your work habits and you really
[time=1916] do need to be, you know, on top of the job and stuff.
[time=1920] I mean, she's got to be looking at me saying, "What is your deal here?
[time=1926] I mean, what is that about?" I'm doing the old excuse, blame, and mitigate thing on my own daughter.
[time=1934] And I don't know if she caught it this time in the seventh grade, but I promise you, if I keep that stuff up, she's going to get to the place where she can't trust me.
[time=1942] And she certainly has no basis to respect me.
[time=1946] How about I walk in and say, you know something, honey, what I did was wrong.
[time=1950] I sinned against you. You had no business having to listen to me vent all over you about stuff that isn't even your responsibility. You've done a phenomenal job this week.
[time=1962] I made some very bad choices this week. I just made one of them with you and you took a brunt for most of it. Please forgive me.
[time=1970] Now she's got a dad, she can trust.
[time=1974] Now she's got a guy she can respect. Now she's got a path to further open herself up to vulnerable relationship with her father.
[time=1986] Let me ask you, isn't that true?
[time=1990] I mean you think about the way that people relate with you.
[time=1994] Now when they step on you and they bruise you and they kick you, do you find that when they come back to you with their excuses and their blame shifting and their mitigating, do you find you are drawn to them and want to give them a little bigger piece of your soul?
[time=2010] Are you pretty much saying, I appreciate that. Thank you. No problem.
[time=2014] And you kind of do the superficial thing again and then you walk away and you go.
[time=2018] I don't know.
[time=2022] Conflict is inevitable. Violations to one another are inevitable.
[time=2026] But a genuine brokenness over personal sin that lets you stand up and take full responsibility for what you've done, promotes intimacy.
[time=2038] David, remember King David? I mean did he blow it? I mean he committed adultery and then he murdered the gal's husband and then he tried to lie about that covered up and then he held on to that sin for about 365 days before he ever even really got straight with God. But eventually God broke through that man's heart. And David said in Psalm 51 verses 3 and 4, "For I know my transgressions and my sin is ever before me." No excuse. No blame.
[time=2066] No mitigate. Just I know I have done this and it's right here in front of my face. I can see it clearly now. And then he says against the only I have sinned and done what is evil in your sight. And I know you see it too and I know I'm finally looking at it like you're looking at it. And it's my fault and I'm responsible for this thing. You see that's the building block of a solid relationship whether it's with God or with people. You've got to be able to admit and take responsibility for your sin. A genuine brokenness.
[time=2098] And by the way, that is the beginning of relationship with God.
[time=2102] I mean if you're here this morning and you have never, you don't know what it means to get right with God. And you're kind of checking this whole thing out. I'll tell you what, you don't get right with God because you come to church and you don't get right with God because you own a Bible. And you don't get right with God maybe because you stop some activity that are commonly known as you know misbehaviors. That's not it my friends. It's right here at this first issue where you can stand before God take full responsibility for your sin. And sure there are influences that might have had you sinned this way or sinned that way not to say we're uninfluenced by our circumstances but in the midst of all that and with all of it taken into consideration you stand before God and you say I am a sinner. Please forgive me. Please forgive me through the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=2146] I take his death as my death. Please let his sacrifice be in my place to wash me and cleanse me and make me acceptable to you because I am a sinner. That's what it means to get safe.
[time=2158] That's what it means to get right with God. And we'll talk about that at the end of our message here. Let's move to number two.
[time=2166] Number two is this not only are you the kind of person who is genuinely broken over your own sin but there's a second kind of brokenness and I call it an active brokenness and an active brokenness and I call it an active brokenness because it seeks to change. It really seeks to change what's going on in that relationship. In other words it's like this I'm so broken over what my actions have done to you that I not only admit and take full responsibility for them but I will seek and I will work and I will will to change my behavior so I don't hurt you like that again.
[time=2202] That's what I call active brokenness. It's a switch of the soul where you not only take responsibility for what happened but you begin to say I don't ever want that to happen again and you begin to hunt and you begin to search and you begin to work and you begin to change what's going on inside of you.
[time=2218] Psalm 139 verses 23 and 24 this is another one that David wrote.
[time=2222] He says this search me oh God and know my heart.
[time=2226] Try me and know my anxious thoughts and see if there be any hurtful way in me and lead me in the way everlasting. Here he is crying out to the living God for the kind of internal changes that have to happen if he's going to get any better at this thing called and he says to God turn the search light on and look inside my character and look inside my motives and begin to reveal and disclose the things which I don't even know about myself but which will eventually hurt and damage the people in my life.
[time=2258] Had an incredible experience that I will never forget in the pastoral arena in terms of marriage counseling. These people have been together for 26 years. They've been involved in the church for 26 years. They've been named in the name of Christ for 26 years.
[time=2278] And some of us on the outside looking in had some suspicions about what was going on in terms of the dynamics of that relationship but it all took on new meeting when she when she got up and walked out one day and said I'm not going back and we were shocked because of her kind of her commitment to marriage here to four. Another man and I were involved in the counseling of this lady and we had the very real impression that she had never kind of even articulated to herself exactly why she had walked out. So we asked her to write all of it down. Write it down. Write the reasons and the hope that maybe she could deal with some of the bitterness and become more objective and we could begin to work on some of the issues together. Man she wrote.
[time=2318] I mean she didn't write like wordy sentences. She just wrote bullet little sentences that began to give chronology to the violations that she had incurred and this relationship ended up with like two and a half pages of eight and a half by eleven. And then there was the fateful moment when we got them both together and asked her just simply to explain what was on her sheet.
[time=2338] I'll tell you what man. I started crying about the third one and you know I'm holding it back because this isn't about me and I'm trying to stay out of the way as these two people
[time=2348] as she says all this stuff to this guy and now my heart's dying inside.
[time=2352] I can't believe this stuff and I think there was evidence to support much of it.
[time=2356] Just relational violation at one after the other.
[time=2360] But then it really turned eerie when she said this and she held up these papers and said you see these?
[time=2370] I will never throw these away.
[time=2374] I will never not have these because they will remind me
[time=2380] how many times you said you were sorry.
[time=2384] You said you were sorry so many times. You said it over and over and over and over and over again but you know something you never changed.
[time=2396] And she said I am done believing that you will ever change. And so maybe three maybe four maybe six maybe eight months from now my heart might change. I might think differently about this but I'll have these and I'll read them again and they'll tell me again that you do not change. You just say you're going to change.
[time=2420] She said you have lost my respect and I do not trust you anymore.
[time=2428] The meeting was over.
[time=2432] Active brokenness is different.
[time=2438] Active brokenness not only stands up and takes full responsibility for the violation but it begins to change the internal workings of the heart and the mind.
[time=2446] Active brokenness seeks a standard of love found in the Word of God because an actively broken person doesn't want it to be a relative commitment or a conditional commitment where if you perform I'll perform the truly actively broken person says I want to tie my heart and my life to the true standard of what it would mean to love you and this will be the guide not your conditional performance in our relationship and when it gets tough I want this to be written down in black and white as the living Word of God because I don't want to be renegotiating my commitment to love you. The truly actively broken person seeks to tie their heart to the standard of God's Word. Psalm 119 verse 11 the psalmist says that I word have I treasured in my heart that I might not sin against thee. In other words I want so much to learn to love people differently that I memorize these words that tell me how to love people. I commit them to memory so I don't have to open my Bible they're just in my head. In verse 18 the same writer says this open my eyes that I might be hold wonderful things from my law and what he is saying there is not enough to memorize it you need to give me insight and wisdom as to how to apply what it would mean to love that person on a day-to-day basis. In the same writer said this in verse 72 the law of thy mouth is better to me than thousands of gold and silver pieces. What is he saying there I value what it means to be a lover of your soul more than I do gold and silver. So I have memorized the standard and I have asked you to illuminate me in understanding the standard and then I have vowed myself to make loving you more important than anything in the world even money even gold and silver.
[time=2550] Relationships are built by people who have been genuinely broken over their personal
[time=2558] sin and who are actively broken to the degree that they seek to change their heart and their mind to the influences of God's Word. Number three the third kind of brokenness is what I call demonstrated brokenness, demonstrated brokenness.
[time=2574] Now we're going to move from the inside of the person to the outside of the person. The inside of the person is a genuine taking responsibility for sin and then secondarily a trying and a changing of the heart and the mind to think differently and seek ways to change and demonstrated brokenness is when it actually comes out you actually see it change. Paul went and ministered to this group of people called the Thessalonians and they were worshiping false gods, false idols they were dishonest with their money, they were dishonest in their relationships, they were selfish, they were proud, they were arrogant, they were lost, they had relational pain all over the place.
[time=2606] They're miserable and he came and told them about the power of Jesus Christ and the difference that Christ could make in their life in a short amount of time you would not believe how much changed in their lives.
[time=2618] Listen to this says in 1 Thessalonians chapter 1 verse 9 "For they themselves report about us what kind of a reception we had with you and how you turned to God from idols to serve a living and a true God." They didn't just change their religion, they didn't just say "Oh I used to believe in this God and I believe in this God." The change came down to where the rubber meets the road a service of that true and living God as they would love the people in their world. Real change happened. Actual change in their behavior began to be evidenced. Priorities, how you spend your time, how you spend your money, what you count as really, really important.
[time=2658] That begins to change actually in the day-to-day.
[time=2662] One of the greatest privileges I've had since coming to this church was a day that a couple came in for premarital counseling and I asked them if they knew Christ as their Savior and they obviously didn't and their life was in a wreck.
[time=2678] They were living together, they were having premarital sex together. There was all kinds of strife inside of their relational world because they didn't know how to parent and the gal had a daughter from a previous marriage and there was conflict into how everybody was going to fit into this new home and there was no understanding what that was about and to make matters worse they were spending money beyond their means and the debt was accumulating and you can just imagine, I mean really truly significant happening in their life on an ever decreasing scale.
[time=2714] All they had was hurt, all they had was pain, all they had was conflict.
[time=2718] And I said, you know, have you ever come to Christ?
[time=2722] Have you ever asked Christ to be your personal Lord and Savior?
[time=2726] Have you ever been genuinely broken over your personal sin? They said no.
[time=2730] We prayed about that. Have you ever sought real change?
[time=2734] They began to pursue real change. It was absolutely amazing.
[time=2738] You know what happened? True story.
[time=2742] They found out that in 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 you're not supposed to have premarital sex.
[time=2746] That's not really love after all, that's really kind of transgressing and defrauding as we saw last week in our message on the sexual side of love.
[time=2754] And they stopped living together, but they stopped having sex.
[time=2758] They said if that's how God says we're supposed to love each other, we're going to love each other through abstinence just like He said. Then they said hey that works pretty good we're having better times together and we're starting to relate better.
[time=2770] Now we got this problem with our family. Does the Bible say anything about how to raise kids?
[time=2774] They said yeah it does. There's a lot about that. In fact we got a class called growing kids God's way. You could be a part of that class. They said they teach the Bible there.
[time=2782] Yeah they do. They went to that class and they began to memorize Scripture. They began to learn God's principles for how a husband and a wife and a child are supposed to function in a home and they came back six, seven, eight months later and said you won't believe what's going on in our family.
[time=2794] Things are all different now. Things are beginning to change.
[time=2798] I mean we're having so much more fun together.
[time=2802] Talking in relational terms man she begins to love me. He loves me and we're starting to talk and communicate. Wow.
[time=2810] They said the Bible said anything about debt. I mean what I was supposed to handle my money.
[time=2814] I said yeah we happen to have a class on that too. It's called Crown Ministries.
[time=2818] They went over there to sign up for Crown Ministries. They began to study the Bible about money.
[time=2822] They began to memorize Scripture. They began to ask God to reveal things in their heart and in their life.
[time=2826] They began to seek change as actively broken individuals and that was about two years ago. They had quite a bit of debt and as of the latest report they're almost completely out of debt.
[time=2838] Absolutely incredible. You know what?
[time=2842] It's called demonstrated brokenness. Taking responsibility for the damage they're doing to each other and to other people saying I am a sinner.
[time=2850] God help me.
[time=2854] Actively seeking the ways to change their mind and their heart, the direction of their soul.
[time=2858] So they won't hurt people like that anymore and eventually big huge pieces of fruit start falling out of their life and they're picking them up saying this is good.
[time=2866] This is satisfying. This is what life was supposed to be about.
[time=2870] That's an amazing thing.
[time=2874] Let me give you one more just before I quit.
[time=2878] I call it the empowered brokenness.
[time=2882] Empowered brokenness. The amazing thing happens and I can only tell you this from the Word of God. You can't see this one with your eyes.
[time=2890] I can introduce you to these people. They can tell you this stuff. But I can't show you this one.
[time=2894] You've got to just take it by faith.
[time=2898] But the Bible says that when you give your life to Christ when you confess your sins before God and ask God to be your savior through the person of Jesus Christ that right at that moment the Holy Spirit takes up residence in your life and you don't fall over on the floor and nobody has to touch you on the head and you don't, you know, I mean it can hardly notice in it right at first.
[time=2918] But the Word of God says He takes up residence in your life for one explicit purpose and that is to help you change the way you're trying to change.
[time=2930] He comes alongside as divine empowerment inside your heart and suddenly you'll feel you're getting promptings from the Holy Spirit and he guides you into this conversation to say these kinds of things and you don't hear voices and it's all based upon your study of His Word but certain things just kind of begin and you feel like wow I ought to say that and you say that and whoa that was good.
[time=2950] You'll find the Holy Spirit convicting you of sin and teaching you principles from His Word and giving you support and consoling you and encouraging you and leading you and comforting you. It says in Philippians chapter 2 verses 12 and 13 it says this work out your salvation with fear and trembling. That's the part that we do.
[time=2970] That's the part about actively being broken and seeking to understand God's Word.
[time=2974] That's the part about changing your finances and literally working hard to change the way you relate to your wife and to your daughter and all that stuff. That's the that's the you part where you have to exercise your will and make decisions and be different.
[time=2986] But look at the rest of the verse it says for it is God willing to work for His good pleasure. Can I promise you this it happens that God moves inside of your heart and prompts you and leads you and strengthens you and convicts you and you'll find yourself doing things you could not do by yourself in the relational arena. You'll care more for people than you ever cared. You'll be sorry for your sins and other people's lives more than you ever thought. You'll really want to change those things more than you ever thought because it is more than you ever could have thought. It's the help that God gives.
[time=3022] And you might you might say ah man that sounds you know really exciting but I'm in some deep stuff. I mean I'm really struggling. I'm I'm ensnared in some stuff. You know Proverbs 5.21 says this for the ways of a man or before the eyes of the Lord and He watches all His paths.
[time=3042] There isn't a person here that doesn't have some secret sins that doesn't have some secret issues, something that happened to them as a child, something that they've been doing, something that they think you're convinced beyond your wildest dreams. There's no way that you could break free from the power that that thing has on your life. Holy Spirit can break you free from that.
[time=3058] The Holy Spirit will break you free from that if you give him a chance.
[time=3062] It's divine power. It's bigger than human strength.
[time=3066] I can tell you from personal experience in my own life and the life of my friends I have seen God through his Holy Spirit orchestrate circumstances to help people get free of the things they thought they could never break away from.
[time=3082] It's real. It's true.
[time=3086] Now could you imagine? Could you imagine being in relationship where two people are like this both of them genuinely broken over their personal sin both of them pursuing the other person saying man this is what I did and I violated you and it's my fault please forgive me and the other person saying this is what I did to you and it was wrong I violated you please forgive me.
[time=3110] Could you imagine two people actively broken over their sin to the degree that they're seeking a heart level change. They're investing quality time and energy in God's Word to see their heart and the direction of their soul change because they don't want to hurt that person like that ever again.
[time=3126] Could you imagine being in relationship with a person who begins to demonstrate that he's broken this in real life change where his priorities are different her attitude is different the whole thing is beginning to look different because of the process of that brokenness.
[time=3142] Could you imagine being in relationship with another person who you know is indwelt by the Spirit of God whose soul job description is to help that other person live a God honoring loving life.
[time=3154] I mean I'm telling you what you can begin to have some hopes that you can experience relational joy you can begin to have a renewed sense you know what man I can live again this is really worth it we can go back to Psalm 133 verse 1 behold how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity you could begin to bask in relationships you're getting any younger me neither the sad news is I'm like 37 almost 38 it bothers me a lot I mean that I hate it I'd rather be 28 kind of on pause and you know what you start facing the fact that you're getting older you just got to start asking all kinds of weird questions like how's retirement looking and do we have enough money to get the kids through school because they're going to be in college here pretty soon and how's all that going to work and you just start and you get the sense you know what it's happening to me like it happens to everybody else time marches on to end the days don't stop for me the days stop for you and you got to ask yourself a question am I giving myself to the stuff that really matters I mean if I'm laying in that hospital bed and somebody rolls the video tape of my life
[time=3236] am I able to say that I really pursue things that matter and my conviction friends the things that matter are people
[time=3246] quality meaningful heartfelt relationships
[time=3252] I want to give you a minute to reflect on that we've asked some people to come and give you just a moment of pause we actually have time to do this and as these words are being sung I want you to ask that question am I giving myself to the stuff that really matters or am I getting sucked up running after a whole bunch of stuff a bunch of temporal stuff that has no ability to impact me like people do
[time=3299] is fragile soon it will end and once it has vanished
[time=3313] it will not come again so let us love with love pure and strong
[time=3327] before this day is gone
[time=3337] this day is fleeting
[time=3346] when it slips away not all our money can buy back this day
[time=3361] so let us pray that we might be a friend
[time=3371] before this day
[time=3381] this day we're given his golden letters
[time=3395] so love this day is ours for one moment let us so love
[time=3421] this day is frail it will pass by so before it's too late to recapture the time let us share love let us share God before this day
[time=3458] is gone
[time=3465] before this day
[time=3476] is gone
