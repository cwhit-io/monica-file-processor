You know the Lord has brought some great things to my awareness about the ministry of the Bible hour in the last several months. People are coming to Christ through the preaching of His Word and through the music and through the presentation of this ministry and I've been able to meet a number of them and to see the joy and the excitement and the life transformation that's going on in their life, I'm so thankful.
[time=458] We don't very often ask for support to help underwrite the ministry of the Bible hour, but we're going to do that for the next six weeks. We only do it about once a year and I'd like to ask you to consider becoming a part of what we call the Founders Club. This is the group of people that underwrite the ministry of the Bible hour. It's $15 a month.
[time=477] It's a commitment that you might make of $15 a month and you underwrite the airtime and
[time=483] the very small support staff. I receive no salary from the Bible hour, but it would help underwrite our ministry. If you'd be willing to do that, I'd like to ask you to call our secretary, Pat. Pat Arashiro at 493 7400 and communicate your willingness to support the
[time=501] Bible hour. Thank you.
[time=531] Sometimes it's hard to understand the reasons why. Isn't there some way I can say just a
[time=549] piece of me? Isn't there somehow you can take this cup from me? Lord, I hear you whispering.
[time=563] This is how it just has to be. Oh, but God, it's softly hard to say. Goodbye to me. Hold
[time=578] me close as I say. Goodbye to me. Oh, let my heart know that you are all I need. I'll
[time=594] stay right here on my knees until I have the strength to say goodbye to me because I'm
[time=611] so tired of living somewhere in between. Lord, my love for you and my love for me. So take
[time=627] whatever's left of me. I sacrifice it, Lord, to thee. Goodbye to me.
[time=655] I'll cast down every idol that I've built. Yeah, Lord, and lay them all where Calvary's
[time=665] blood was spilled. There where you sacrificed yourself for me. Well, now it's my turn, Lord,
[time=680] to die for thee. Hold me close as I say. Goodbye to me. Let my heart know, Lord, you're all
[time=700] that I need. I'll stay right here on my knees until I have the strength to say goodbye to
[time=716] me. Lord, I'm so tired of living somewhere in between. Lord, my love for you and my love
[time=734] for me. So please take whatever is left of me. I sacrifice it, Lord, to thee. Goodbye to
[time=750] thee. Goodbye. Oh, goodbye. Goodbye.
[time=767] To me. Now, please help me, Lord, to say goodbye to me.
[time=795] Well, I'm excited to talk with you these next couple of weeks on this theme. It's your
[time=804] serve. And as you know, if you've been with us, we just finished about a five or six week
[time=811] series on love of another kind. And I'm so thankful for the way God has used that series in my life and in your life. You don't really know, you know, at the beginning, somewhere
[time=822] in the summer there when we're figuring all that out and coming into the fall and trying to establish a theme and put some topics down. You have no idea how the Lord might use that.
[time=829] And I just want to publicly say I'm thankful to Him for what He's done in our midst on that topic and for the way you all have responded and been responsive to the teaching of His Word. But for the next couple of weeks, I'd like to talk to you on this topic. It's your serve. And I mean by that, I'd like to talk to you about being used by God in the life
[time=850] and the ministry of this church. The part that you would play in this period of time that
[time=859] we're together at this particular church and this particular city and this particular country.
[time=865] Now I don't know if you know it, but the ministry of the church is not primarily to be carried
[time=871] out by the paid professional, if you will. And I think there's a lot of misunderstanding
[time=878] in churches around America particularly on this issue because it seems common and it seems typical and it seems pretty regular. A group of believers get together and they say okay, let's get our church going and we'll get a building and then we'll hire somebody or some people and they can, you know, they can do the preaching and they can do the teaching and then when somebody dies they can bury them and when somebody needs to get married they can marry them and when somebody's sick they can go visit them. And our church will be doing well or not so well, depending upon whether or not the guy we paid or the people we paid to do that do that. Almost as if you come to the end of the year and they come to a business meeting and say well did he do all those things and the answer is either yes or no and it's kind of evaluated on that. And while that is a very common model of ministry
[time=921] and while you can see that in great numbers of churches, in fact probably most of the churches we come from, functioned off that model. I just want you to know that is not what the Bible describes when it talks about how a local church is supposed to function.
[time=939] It is true that God has given leaders to the church and if you were to go you don't need to but Ephesians chapter 4 talks about pastors and teachers and evangelists. As people and
[time=951] often in the New Testament they would end up not having a, you know, a 9-5 job, a 40-hour week job, they'd end up being supported by the people of the church so they could give themselves full time to the process of preaching, teaching and evangelism but really the text says to train the people in the church to do the function of the church, to do the work
[time=972] of the church. The real biblical model is that God gives some people with some certain
[time=979] kind of gifts who then serve everybody else in the way to train and equip and lead and
[time=987] motivate and encourage everybody else then to do the real work of the ministry. And maybe
[time=995] you've never known that and maybe you never would know that just by looking around at most churches. The Bible also teaches that the church has been gifted to accomplish its
[time=1006] objectives. Now what do I mean by that? When a person gives their life to Christ and becomes
[time=1012] a Christian, right there at that moment of conversion, the Bible teaches that the Holy Spirit endows each individual not just the pastor, not just the elders, not just the deacons.
[time=1024] Each and every individual is given a package of spiritual gifts, abilities, capacity to
[time=1032] do things, the work of the church. And those are a combination of who God made you when
[time=1040] you were created in your mother's womb, what your IQ is or isn't, what your aptitudes are,
[time=1047] what your physical appearance, your kind of your likes and your dislikes. And then when you finally come to the point where you come to Christ, usually in a manner consistent with some of those natural things, he gives you additional things called spiritual powers or spiritual gifts that allow you to make a difference inside the body of Christ, one to another.
[time=1069] Most churches function on what they call the 2080 rule, where 20% of the people end up
[time=1076] doing 80% of the work. And that really is a good church by national average. I mean that
[time=1082] would be not a real weak church, that'd probably be a pretty good church. A lot of churches are doing it like 10% are doing 80 of the work. And those 10 or 20% can be exhausted, they
[time=1095] can be worn out, they can be wondering where everybody else is and why there isn't any help. And I don't know the statistics on our church, but I would say to you that one of
[time=1105] the things I'm hoping for in response to this two week little series is that if our percentage
[time=1112] is 2080, that it could go to like 3080 or maybe 4080. I mean I'm really hoping and our staff
[time=1118] is hoping and our elder board is hoping, that as you open your life and your heart to these
[time=1125] messages that you'll make some decisions to plug in in ways that are meaningful and that
[time=1131] are rewarding and that make a big difference in the life of our church. So my goal is directly
[time=1142] and primarily to those of you who are not now being used of God in the life of this church.
[time=1149] For whatever reason, you may used to have been involved and now you're not, or you may be new and never have. Other churches yes, but this church no, or you may be so new to the whole game, the whole deal here in Christianity, you've never served and everything you're hearing so far this morning is like brand new news to you. Then I guess secondarily I would hope that those of you who are faithfully serving would be encouraged by this, by what you're going to hear because I think you're going to see a lot of the things I'm talking about already in your life and I hope it stands as an encouragement to you. I want to do that by asking you three basic questions and I'm going to kind of give them to you as we go and my hope, what we did with the first hour today, my hope is that you will write those three questions down and take them with you as you go out there and ponder them this week and just honestly ask yourself and process through these basic three questions that I
[time=1200] want to ask you. But to get kind of a background and to allow the word of God to speak to us this morning, come with me to Romans chapter 1. I've seen this passage many, many times
[time=1211] and never really studied it and I don't think really ever looked at it with these set of glasses on or from this perspective but it really, it really helps us this morning in
[time=1220] terms of getting a grip on why we would serve in the local church. Why, those of you who
[time=1227] are with us today who at this point are not ministering might consider taking a step in
[time=1233] that direction. And I want to, the passage is verses 8 to 15 but I want to begin in
[time=1239] verse 9 because I think in verse 9 you get the central thought of the passage and we'll work from that central thought. He says in verse 9, "For God whom I serve in my spirit
[time=1250] in the preaching of the gospel of his son is my witness as to how unceasingly I make mention of you." The phrase that I think sets the passage in perspective is, "Whom
[time=1262] I serve in my spirit. Whom I serve in my spirit." What Paul is saying here is that the ministry
[time=1270] that I give, when I minister my spiritual gift Paul is saying, "I do that from deep within
[time=1276] my heart." I do that because of a conviction that's inside of me, certain things that I
[time=1282] value that cause me to want to do this from the inside out. If you know anything about
[time=1288] the life of Paul, he was constantly traveling, exhausted in his travels, exhausted by his preaching and his teaching, he was healing people, he would find himself in debates in the public forum, he would find himself in very obscure ways ministering from house to house, his ministry kind of covered the gamut. He was often thrown in prison, he was often beaten, he was often misunderstood, he was very persecuted by some contemporary religious leaders who did not agree with his position on God and how to be right with God and who took his teaching as a personal offense and so they came after him relentlessly day after day after day. And what he is saying is, "All that notwithstanding, I am serving
[time=1330] God in my spirit from deep within my heart." I'm doing this stuff because I want to do
[time=1336] this stuff. Now as you know Paul was raised and educated in Judaism, he cut his teeth
[time=1343] in his earliest religious experiences in a thing called Judaism which is kind of a warped
[time=1349] but based on Old Testament religion and the way it got really warped was they took it
[time=1355] and turned it into a legalistic mechanical routine external superficial religion. And
[time=1363] so in other words here you got a guy saying, "Now when I serve him today I serve him from my spirit but don't forget that I wasn't taught that from my childhood. I didn't see that in my parents, I didn't see that in my community. What I grew up with was a very mechanical routine external superficial effort at religion." And it was everywhere he would
[time=1386] look and people would just with a devotion and a zeal, I mean they were so committed
[time=1392] to it but it never came from their hearts. For them it meant prestige because the whole
[time=1399] country was wrapped up in the theocracy, the religion was their government. And so if
[time=1405] you were going to achieve positions of status in your country you didn't run for office, you got religious. For others it was a matter of appearance and there were people in his
[time=1417] day and age who would give untiring devotion to their religion simply because it was important
[time=1424] to them to be seen as religious because that was the cultural dimension of the day. If you
[time=1431] were cool you were religious. Now others were swept up by peer pressure and people would find themselves relentlessly pursuing religion with a cavity in their heart, no real meaning
[time=1442] but it was just, you know how peer pressure works, it's just what everybody's doing and so you get swept up in it. He would have been exposed to people doing it for financial gain.
[time=1451] Numbers of them as they ascended into the religious strata of the day began to receive financial compensation and for them that's all there was involved. Paul is saying it's
[time=1464] not that with me, I know I was raised in that and I know people are prone to that but I want
[time=1470] you to know with me it comes from my heart. It comes from deep within me, it's found in
[time=1477] my inner man with my whole heart because of values that I cherish, that's why I use my
[time=1483] spiritual gift. Now he flavors his statement in his choice of word here, looking in at
[time=1489] verse 90, he says, "For God whom I serve in my spirit." The word serve there is a Greek word called Lutreo and it can be alternately translated in the New Testament, serve as
[time=1500] it is properly translated here. Other places it gets translated as the word worship, worship.
[time=1508] And I think he intentionally uses this word because he wants you to know not only is he doing it from his heart but when he uses his spiritual gifts to build the body to him it
[time=1518] is an act of worship. I mean he is trying to honor his God and express love to his God
[time=1524] and say to him things in the use of his gift that we have been trying to say this morning in the singing of our songs. It's the same hard attitude and commitment to worship, it's just a different venue, it's just a different expression. It would be as if he's saying sometimes I sing songs to praise my God for all that he's done in my life and other times
[time=1543] I just use my spiritual gift to show him how thankful I am.
[time=1548] But one thing is clear, his service as an apostle, his preaching, his teaching, his healing,
[time=1555] the suffering of beatings, the suffering of imprisonment, the suffering of misunderstandings, the self-discipline it requires, that whole thing is offered up to God from his heart as an act of worship saying I just want to honor you with the use of my gift. And I hope
[time=1572] God that you'll get as much meaning out of that as when I sit in here and sing these songs
[time=1578] and my heart is overflowing as I recite what you've done for me in saving me.
[time=1582] Now I don't know about you but I mean right there we can time out and say I like that.
[time=1590] Right? I mean there's something very sound, there's something very appealing, there's
[time=1596] something very drawing. What I mean to say is this, wouldn't you like it if that was you? I mean wouldn't that be something to strive after to have those kinds of things
[time=1608] running through your heart to where you could honestly sit down and say this is the God
[time=1614] whom I serve with my spirit?
[time=1619] There's something terribly right there. The second thing that it throws up in my mind is quite honestly there's a there's a mountain of conviction there because I know in my heart
[time=1628] and in my life the times are all too frequent when that's not true of me. I'm back on the
[time=1635] other page. I'm back on the appearance thing. I'm back on the status thing. I'm back on what
[time=1642] you think of me and I do get paid for what I do and there are times when this turns into a job for me and the motivation can sink as low as well. I guess better go to work today
[time=1653] that's where I get my paycheck and I guess if you've ever been involved in service and if you've ever ministered you're not a stranger to some of those feelings either. I mean you know how quickly the stuff can degenerate and move out of a heartfelt sacrificial act
[time=1668] of worship to the true and living God and I mean it can just bleed its way down into
[time=1674] the most base of things. We can all stand back and say you know what if I could just
[time=1680] push a button and get my heart to function right I want it to function like that right there. I want to serve God I want to worship God from my heart as I give my gifts. I think
[time=1694] in this passage he opens up some of the background thought processes and commitments that produce
[time=1701] that kind of a heart. That's what I want to try to explain and I'm going to try to pose those issues to you in forms of three questions and ask you to ponder them through the week.
[time=1709] The first one is found in verse 8. He says this, "First I thank my God through Jesus Christ
[time=1717] for you all because your faith is being proclaimed throughout the whole world. What I see here
[time=1725] is an apostle who is right and as he writes this book he is under the oppression of these
[time=1732] false religious leaders they're plotting to find a way to kill him. He has already had a number of imprisonments. He's already had a number of beatings. In other words there is enough material in his life for him to be anything other than thankful that it would
[time=1747] astound you. How he comes up with a true confession of being honestly thankful for what's going
[time=1753] on is beyond me until I recognize what he's excited about. He is not thankful for the
[time=1760] stuff necessarily that's going right in his own personal life. What does it say? He says I am thankful for what God is doing in your life. That your faith is being proclaimed.
[time=1773] In other words you are so transformed by the power of God that people can't stop talking
[time=1779] about the difference that's being made in your life. He had never met these people. He
[time=1789] had never gone to Rome. This was not his church. He had no self-interest in this. This isn't
[time=1796] one of those deals where the preacher tries to build everybody up for his own namesake.
[time=1799] He's never been there, never met them, never seen them has probably had no impact on the
[time=1805] original starting of the church, but what he is is he is so caught up in the wonder that God will change people's lives in such dramatic ways that it gets talked about. That's why
[time=1819] he's joyful because he's tied to that incredible cause of God. God is in the process of taking
[time=1828] broken, confused, hurting, lonely people and first redeeming them to himself and then changing
[time=1835] their lives in dramatic ways. Heidi and I were driving home to the night going down a road
[time=1843] real near our church and this lady was walking down the street and it was kind of getting towards the evening and it was getting dark and we looked and saw oh yeah that's so and so she's in our church and did the obvious thing, picked her up and noticed a car, figured the car that was back there had been broken and that was the case and so we got a chance to give her a ride home and a wonderful thing you know a great opportunity to help somebody
[time=1864] along the way but a week and a half later I get a letter and she says you have no idea
[time=1874] what's going on in my life. She said I married this guy and let me tell you about this guy
[time=1884] five years ago he didn't know Christ. He was a broken, lonely individual whose dreams in
[time=1894] life had been utterly shattered, his first marriage fell apart and he by his own admission was a great contributor to that and he both gave more pain and received more pain in the disintegration of that marriage relationship than any one person ever ought to have to endure. And through the ministry of this church he found out that God still loved him. He
[time=1920] found out that he was not beyond the reach of God's grace despite how terribly he had destroyed his life and other people and he began to be discipled in this church. In fact
[time=1931] as it worked out I was able to meet with him every week for about two and a half years he and another guy and we would talk about the power of God's grace and we would talk about the difference that God would make in our lives in categories like how you treat people and what you do with your money and what you do with your time and what ought to be important and what ought not to be important. And after about two and a half years of that it seemed like we had gone as far as we could go together and so we stopped meeting and about a year after that he ends up marrying this lady, a woman in our church and she saw
[time=1964] herself I mean it had had unbelievable pain and sorrow because a guy that she had married
[time=1970] had turned out to be men to the best that we understand probably not a true believer
[time=1976] and he just violated her terribly and eventually left her all alone with her kids and so she
[time=1985] begins to meet this guy now. See and you can imagine they're both kind of looking at each other saying are we sure we want to do this again? I mean more pain than we've ever experienced happen right in this thing called marriage but they step back into that together by God's
[time=1999] grace, honorable marriage. She writes me this letter. She says this things like this I just
[time=2008] wrote down the themes. She said you have no idea what it's like to be loved by a guy
[time=2016] like this. I mean the difference that he makes in my life as he understands me and loves
[time=2023] me and cares for me and sacrifices for me and invests in me. She says you have no idea
[time=2031] what it's like to have him as a husband. She says you have no idea. I just got to tell
[time=2037] you what it's like to have him parenting my children, fathering my children to have a man in the house who loves God and loves the word and will work with our kids and will discipline and will encourage and will strengthen and will spend time with. I mean imagine where she's coming from. Then she changed the subject and went on to talk about him in the workplace
[time=2058] and she said I'm so proud of him. He has this job now and he goes so faithful and he works so hard and he's so respected in the workplace and it's such a wonderful thing to know that our financial needs can be cared for by a man who loves us and really wants to provide for our needs. She said you have no idea what it's like to have a spiritual leader in the
[time=2079] home who I can follow. Now my friends, can you think of anything that's worth more to
[time=2092] you than being a part of a process where that kind of life change happens? Is there any
[time=2104] other cause on the planet that would be enough to have you sacrifice your time and your energy
[time=2116] to pull you away from other things that might take your time and interest? Can you think of any other cause that is more exciting and more compelling than the fact that God is in
[time=2128] the process of redeeming people to himself and then systematically and powerfully altering
[time=2134] the course of their life for his glory and in the process letting them enjoy a level of relationship and love and joy that they never otherwise would have known. That is exactly what Paul is saying. He said you want to know why I serve God as an act of worship. You
[time=2150] want to know why I give my spiritual gifts out like this on a regular and tireless basis.
[time=2155] It is because I am overwhelmed with the reality of what Christ can do in the life and the heart of a broken person. He can do so much, he's saying about these Romans, that just
[time=2169] after a short period of time, the changes are so radical they're being proclaimed throughout the whole known world. It's an amazing thing. He's saying your church is not famous for
[time=2183] its pastor. Your church is not famous for the architecture. Your church is not famous
[time=2189] for the people who are buried in the cemetery out back as some churches in America are famous for. Your church is not famous for its choir. It's not famous for the celebrities who happen to attend. It's not famous for how wealthy it may be. What are you saying is this little church in Rome is famous for its faith. He means by that the transforming power of God
[time=2208] that is changing the lives of these people. Your church is famous because it's taking
[time=2214] broken, unredeemed, lost, crushed, pointless lives, redeeming them back to the Father and
[time=2221] allowing him to utterly transform their lives. He says I am so excited about it that even
[time=2227] though my personal circumstances are less than I would like them to be, I can honestly tell you I have a deep and abiding joy and thankfulness that fills my heart. He gets so excited. He
[time=2241] starts praying for these people. He's never even met him. Look at verse 9. He says for God whom I serve in my spirit in the preaching of the gospel of his son is my witness as to how unceasingly I make mention of you. Always in my prayers making requestive perhaps now at last by the will of God I may succeed in coming to you. Again he's never been there.
[time=2260] He's never met them. His name is not attached to this family of believers. All he knows is that the things that are happening there are so exciting and lives are being changed so powerfully that he just gets caught up in his being tied to that great reality and
[time=2276] just starts praying for him on a regular basis. We don't know what he prays. We never read a prayer that he had for the Romans. We've read prayers he's given for the Ephesians and for others and he prays for their power and he prays for their strength and he prays for their love and he prays for their steadfastness and he prays for them to honor God with their lives and we know that he prayed just like without ceasing. I mean he would just be walking
[time=2299] someplace and be overwhelmed with a desire to pray for the spiritual progress of what
[time=2305] God was doing in these people's lives, people he's never met. So I got this first question
[time=2316] for you. I'd like you to ponder this this week. Here's what the question isn't don't write this one down. I'm not going to ask you will you serve. I'm not going to ask you that. Here's my question. Write this one down. Can you find a better cause? Can you find
[time=2336] a better cause? I love it if you'd turn that over this week when you're driving to work.
[time=2341] I'd love it if you talk with your spouse about it or your roommate if you're not married.
[time=2345] I'd love it if you'd get together with a believer when you normally do and just say you know that question he was talking about. Can you find a better cause? Let's try to answer that question. Can you find a better cause than seeing broken lost lives redeemed
[time=2361] to God and transformed by his power into people who love and honor God with their lives? Let
[time=2368] me put it to you another way. I'd like you to think in your mind just for a minute pick a face of somebody in your life a family member a friend a neighbor a casual acquaintance somebody that you know their life is broken you know they are not walking with God you know they are alone you know they're broken can you think of anything that would give you more joy than to be a part of a church that is reaching that individual and now in
[time=2396] your mind see it that person comes to Christ the Holy Spirit and dwells that individual
[time=2404] and now they begin to learn to live for the glory of God. I'm asking you can you think of anything when all the dust settles out of life can you think of anything that would
[time=2416] give you more joy than seeing that mother or seeing that father or seeing that neighbor
[time=2422] or seeing that colleague at work be profoundly converted to a faith in Jesus Christ and then
[time=2428] begin to watch their life transform and to know that you had a part. That's my first
[time=2436] question I invite you to ponder it you know how Paul answered the question nope I can't
[time=2446] think of anything I can't think of any other cause politics can't do that to people pure
[time=2453] education can't do that to people winning the lottery can't do that to people nothing
[time=2460] else nothing else in the world can do that to people other than the person of Jesus Christ
[time=2469] and so if I've got something to offer in that equation count me in I'm happy about it it's
[time=2476] a privilege number two comes out of verse 11 and I love this part I love this part verse
[time=2485] 11 says this for I long to see you in order that I may impart some spiritual gift to you that you may be established the key word I want you to look at or underline or circle
[time=2496] is the word established Paul had a vision part of what got Paul serving from his heart
[time=2503] and as an active worship was because he had a vision for what the collective church could be if it ever got its ducks in order what you've got up here in Rome is a brand new baby church the gospel has obviously gotten there by other believers that were probably saved down in Pentecost Jerusalem the day of Pentecost and they migrated back and they brought with them the gospel but there's been no training there's been no teaching there's been no organizing there's been no mobilizing there's been no structuring of all that the church could possibly be and so he's sitting there saying mid you think you've got a good thing going now because you came to Christ and it is good you're redeemed and your life is changing but there's a whole nother part of this equation and it's this when a bunch of you who are redeemed get brought together in the powerhouse called the New Testament church you guys are going to do things you never dreamed of you guys are going to experience a kind of community and love and intimacy among yourselves that you could never have by yourselves as just solo Christians or little family Christians I mean when we start pulling this thing together and start getting this thing to look like the bride of Christ because you're not going to know what hit you the word established listen to this it's the Greek
[time=2577] word staridzo now what do you think we get from that steroid he says man I want to get there
[time=2585] because when I get there I'm going to start teaching you not just how to live your individual lives I'm going to start teaching you what the church can do together and we're just going to get stronger and stronger and stronger we're going to get on steroids I mean we're going to start performing at levels that are just mind boggling to this community and in the mind of God just saying look
[time=2606] at them I mean picture a bodybuilder who who does nothing and then starts doing a little and then
[time=2612] starts doing a lot and then throws some steroids into the equation what you got is you know mr macho man bible often refers to the church as the body of christ and I think the imagery here is of one
[time=2623] of these roman olympians who is just so so together that he is able to accomplish phenomenal things
[time=2635] in the athletic arena paul has a vision not a spiritual vision with angels and and things not
[time=2644] talking from god when by vision I mean he closes his eyes and he thinks about all these individual
[time=2650] believers up there in the room who don't really aren't aren't connected yet and who don't understand god's plan for the church I mean to have elders and deacons and pastors and teachers and people serving all throughout the ministry of the church and the church collectively witnessing and reaching out and caring for one see those people they didn't know about acts too they didn't see what happened in the New Testament church down there many of them and paul saying what I want to do is I want to get up there and I want to establish I want to stir it so I want to build this church to the
[time=2679] ultimate place it can possibly be for the glory of god I love it look at it in verse 9 does he say oh I got to go do this
[time=2694] does he say oh I'm paid I may as well show up does he say you know for the sake of appearance
[time=2700] I'm going to head on up the room put some things in order see that word at the beginning of verse 11 I long there is a burning deep abiding passion
[time=2711] in my heart to get in proximity with you guys so that we can do this church thing to the best of our
[time=2719] ability he sees a strong vibrant caring effective powerful group of believers bound together in the
[time=2730] church let me ask you a question this is a warm up question now this isn't the one I want you to
[time=2738] deal with this week this is a warm up question number two here's my warm up question do you have a
[time=2744] personalized piece of the vision of this church I mean as you're here today do you know where our
[time=2754] church is going do you know our strategy do you know how we're trying to impact this community for Christ and then right underneath that do you know the part I mean do you have a personal vision for how God's going to use you to get us there because we're not going to do it right if we don't do it together we're not going to be Steridzo if we aren't all pulling on this thing together let me just do it to you really quick here let me just give you a chance to answer that question
[time=2780] very specifically one of the main things our church is about is reaching the unchurched right we had a big congregational vote about two and a half years ago we stuck a stake in the ground and we said this church is going after unbelievers because we surveyed ourselves and we found out
[time=2794] that 80% of us have been saved 10 years or longer and that just didn't quite seem right to us and we together collectively said the way we're going to do it remember that that little booklet
[time=2805] called vision two we said the way we're going to reach those unbelievers is we're going to commit what commit ourselves to build relationships with unsafe people that's all we said we do
[time=2823] I'll build a friendship with an unsafe believer if you'll build a friendship with an unsafe believer and then in the context of that relationship surely surely we're going to have a chance to
[time=2834] share our faith at some point and then surely at some point we'll be able to invite them to
[time=2840] come and see the bigger picture on one of our third Sundays do you have a personal vision for that is is that distant to you is that something that got voted on that you don't much care about and don't want to do and and and it's not for you and that you don't have any of that inside of you and I hope not in fact I hope if you do I hope if that's where you're at you'll be honest and say you know what god I got a repent I really want to pull I really want to pull on this plow I really
[time=2866] want to get in this thing I really want to see this church happen to a level that it reflects
[time=2872] having been on steroids do you have a personalized piece of that part of our vision
[time=2881] I know a lot of you do and and and please let me say to you it's hard isn't it I've been working on it too and it's hard I get discouraged and people I think they're moving and they're not moving I think the doors open and I think the doors closed and then I I get distracted myself and other things and I don't give the time I should I didn't ask you are you perfect at it I'm just asking are we connected to that is it on our hearts and are we willing to move in that direction
[time=2902] the other half of our vision is very simple the first half is that winning people to Christ
[time=2908] the second half of our vision is trying to get them to live all that God would have them live and that's our edification ministries and so for some of you it's the children's division and some of you it's a wana and some of it's the nursery nursery and for others it's the the living Christmas tree and getting that thing to happen and others of you are small group leaders or small group participants and other of you have responsibilities and jobs in your adf here's the question for the week number two number two here's the question for the week
[time=2936] it's not this it's not this it's not do I have to serve are we in crisis mode and will this ministry
[time=2942] collapse if I don't go pitch in that is not the question here's the question are we the best that
[time=2950] we can be as a church right now are we the best that we can be are we as strong as we can be
[time=2963] are we pursuing excellence to the uttermost edge of what we're capable of and as you ask and answer that question maybe you'll be able to find some of the obvious areas
[time=2976] that we're not the best we can be and maybe those will be areas that you could help in and you might respond to help not out of crisis not out of boy if we don't get some more workers
[time=2988] we're going to shut this one down but out of a heart like Paul that says man I really long to see the church in all of her glory standing there as strong as she can be and by goodness if I have something to give in that equation I'm going to give it I'm going to give it count on me I'll be there
[time=3014] are we the best that we can be are we the strongest black ock that we can be a couple little footnotes under this thing before I move to the third point look at verse 12
[time=3026] I love this he says that is that I may be encouraged together with you while among you each of us by
[time=3032] the others faith both yours and mine realize this is the greatest guy that ever lived I mean this is the apostle Paul who has done more for the kingdom of God who has been more gifted who has been more faithful who has been more online with the with the call of God but you know what he says there in verse 12 he says and by the way you know when I come to you I'm going to give you my peace but I'm really looking forward to you giving me your peace I really come with the expectation that you've got stuff for me and this is going to be an interdependent relationship where I minister to you and you minister to me and we all get stronger together because you've got critical things to offer the body your contribution is important he is saying you might not be the
[time=3070] big apostle you might not be the guy that stands up front but let me tell you something I need what you have to offer I need to be impacted by your service and your ministry and this church
[time=3081] needs that I just love the humility there didn't come in as the superstar going to fix it all
[time=3087] another thing they're in verse 13 the next verse says this and I don't want you to be unaware brethren how many times I plan to come to you and have been prevented thus far
[time=3097] you know what he's saying I you know what my plans get messed up all the time my plans go go go haywire all the time I've tried to get there this time and then that time and then the Bible doesn't tell us how many times but it's been a number of different times when he tried and said to his mind okay I'm getting over there a room now and and it falls apart I was so encouraged
[time=3117] by that this week I was hearing somebody talk about that and and the guy who's just saying you know what's amazing I think he was talking about Moses Moses got derailed a lot but Moses just kept
[time=3129] coming back to God and trying again just kept coming back to God and trying again and trying
[time=3135] again and trying again and trying again and I want you to know we've been trying some things here some of them are working and some of them are and it's just great to know that we're in good company we're in really good company and I don't think the mark of honoring God is that everything
[time=3151] you try works I think it's the fact that you're trying and when that one fails you go back to the
[time=3157] drawing board you figure something else out and you come at it again look at verse 14 not a little
[time=3163] footnote this is just so wonderfully says I am under obligation both the Greeks and the barbarians both the wise and the foolish what's he saying the Greeks were the Hellenized they were the educated they were the linguists the readers libraries knowledge I mean they just the barbarians
[time=3180] were called such because they had no learning it wasn't so much what they ate that made them
[time=3186] barbarians it was what they didn't know and he kind of amplifies it at the end of verse 14 both of the wise and the foolish you know what he's saying I'm so committed to get there and to be there with you guys and to establish this church and to get us on steroids in our performance before God because there's people that range every part of the spectrum they're really educated in the higher echelons of society and the uneducated in the lower echelons of society and what we can build here can reach all of them what we can do here is touch every single strata point in the social
[time=3219] structure of the city of Rome and you know he did I mean even members of the Praetorian guard came to Christ through the church at Rome much less the slaves so it's an amazing thing he says let me
[time=3233] tell you something I'm serving I'm giving my gift I'm using my spiritual gifts from my heart as an act of worship why because I am so excited about this cause I can't think of anything I'd rather
[time=3246] give my time to than the reality that I could hook up with the true and living God see people get forgiven for all their sins and begin to live radically transformed life I want that cause that's
[time=3256] my cause I'm in and then he says this when that stuff starts to happen by a church that is strong
[time=3265] and established when it gets organized and it starts moving in ways that honor God then the impact can be even greater I am motivated to give out of the vision of what might become so we need to do
[time=3278] that we as a church we need to continue to hope and plan and believe in what can yet come
[time=3285] and then I'll close with this one number three like a verse 15 he says this thus for my part
[time=3295] I am eager I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome
[time=3303] and if you want an imagery on this one just think of a thumbprint what are you saying here is that I
[time=3309] am eager to make my contribution and I've touched on this already but you got to just let this thing happen as the text shows it to you he says thus for my part it's kind of like as for me in my house it's kind of like from this day forward it's kind of like I don't care what else is out there I don't care what other distractions might be around let me just tell you where I'm at there's the greatest
[time=3329] cause in the world for individual lives which can be exploded in any given community as a church
[time=3335] gets established and strengthened and he's just saying I am not only going to do it I can hardly
[time=3341] wait to do it I am eager to preach the gospel I want to leave my personalized mark on what's
[time=3350] going to happen up there not for my glory I just want the thrill of knowing I got to push my thumb in the clay and pull back and when I step back and see all that God has done I just want to be able to say see I was a part of that that's me right there that's my contribution
[time=3365] we're going to talk about this next week please come back but I just want to just briefly say to
[time=3374] you that when you come to Christ he really does give you things called spiritual gifts
[time=3381] some of you got helps some of you got administration gifts some of you got hospitality gifts some of you got leadership gifts some of you got teaching gifts some of you got giving gifts a lot of us
[time=3393] got kind of a package of those I mean if it helps you understand this a little better I think I probably got gifts along the lines of teaching and maybe leadership definitely no administration
[time=3405] gifts were given out on the day I was showing up just ask any of the staff guys that work for me God gives you a unique package of gifts they come together with some of your natural talents
[time=3418] and abilities and your life experiences and they culminate in this amazing ability that you have
[time=3424] to help the body of Christ and it makes a difference in the kingdom of God and like I say next week I'm
[time=3432] gonna I'm gonna talk more about it but my third question and this one's a doozy so you're ready
[time=3439] this is the big one now this is the big if it's true if it's really true that God has given you
[time=3446] spiritual gifts that when you use them people get helped and the church gets stronger if that's
[time=3459] really true would you consider using them if it's not true and you don't have any spiritual
[time=3469] gifts and there is no extra energy coming through your life when you do your stuff inside the church and it's just a human effort no problem but if it is true that he has given you spiritual
[time=3483] powers to make a difference inside this church think about this week what I'd be willing to use them
[time=3490] so question number one do you know a better cause to give your time and energy to
[time=3496] question number two is this church all it could be I mean are we just killing it in every category
[time=3505] or are there some places we could do better question three if it's really true that God has
[time=3512] given you unique abilities to serve empowered by his spirit would you consider using them here
[time=3519] well let me invite you to stand and we'll have a closing word prayer
