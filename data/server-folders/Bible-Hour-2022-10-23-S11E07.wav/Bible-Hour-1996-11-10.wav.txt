[time=30] There have been moments when I've been acutely aware of the presence of God, sometimes while
[time=45] driving my car, sometimes sitting with headphones on, listening to music, sometimes being alone
[time=52] in a cabin, or being in an auditorium filled with people, climbing a mountain or walking
[time=59] along a river, sometimes in this very room I've experienced genuine moments of worship.
[time=70] Was it worship? Are those experienced descriptions of real worship in my life? What is real worship?
[time=87] This is the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church. Thank you for joining us. What is worship? Where can you worship? How do you worship?
[time=96] Today associate pastor Tim Teder looks at a matter of worship and gives some answers to these questions. Now let's join our service.
[time=131] [MUSIC - 353 seconds]
[time=501] [APPLAUSE]
[time=507] Hi, my name is Russell Moore and I want to welcome you to the Bible hour and thank you for joining us again today. I want to talk to you about something that I almost never bring up on the Bible hour. In fact, only once or twice a year will we ever raise the issue of finances for the Bible hour. For over 20 years the Bible hour has been faithfully preaching God's Word and sending forth the message of the gospel, the saving power of the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=536] Through his death and his resurrection and through those years many many many hundreds of people have come to know Christ as their personal Lord and Savior and thousands of others have received vital instruction that have helped them walk faithfully in the ways of the Lord that have encouraged their heart and given them confidence in the power of God to continue to work in their life. And maybe you've even experienced through the ministry of the Bible hour some of the power of God's Word as it's been taught faithfully.
[time=565] And as you've received the ministry of the Bible hour, well it's this time of year again that we ask for faithful supporters to come alongside the Bible hour and help underwrite the expense of this program.
[time=578] The two main expenses of the Bible hour are the airtime that we have here on Channel 21 and then the two staff people that run the Bible hour. I receive no salary from the Bible hour, the Black Hawk Baptist Church receives no money from the Bible hour,
[time=594] and it's just the costs and the expenses represented in the airtime and the very effective but lean staff that we have that puts together the Bible hour on a weekly basis.
[time=606] I'd like to ask you to consider becoming a member of the Founders Club. The Founders Club is a wonderful group of people that contribute $15 a month to support the Bible hour.
[time=618] And that commitment is something that allows you to become part of the Founders Club. And if you'll join the Founders Club, you'll have this tremendous satisfaction of knowing that you support a ministry that preaches the Word to over 14,000 households every single week in the Fort Wayne area.
[time=638] You'll also receive a letter from me on a monthly basis, giving you an update of how the ministry is going, a letter of encouragement to hopefully stimulate you and your walk with the Lord.
[time=650] And we really do need your help. The Bible hour ran a $13,000 loss last year, and we need new Founders Club members to enable us to continue on in this ministry.
[time=660] So please write us here at the Bible hour and make a commitment to join the Founders Club to continue this ministry of preaching God's Word to a lost and dying world.
[time=690] With a sacrifice of praise. With a song I will exalt you, Lord. Blessed be your holy name.
[time=706] I will give you all the glory you delivered me from shame.
[time=717] I'm created in your righteousness. Blessed be your holy name.
[time=727] Lift him up. His name be lifted higher. Lift him up. Exalt his holy name. Lift him up. His name be lifted higher. Exalt his holy name.
[time=777] I will come into your presence, Lord. With a sacrifice of praise.
[time=787] And with this song I will exalt you, Lord. Blessed be your holy name.
[time=798] I will give you all the glory you delivered me from shame.
[time=808] Blessed be your holy name. You gotta lift him up. His name be lifted higher. Lift him up. Exalt his holy name.
[time=827] Exalt his holy name. Lift him up. His name be lifted higher. Exalt his holy name.
[time=849] His name be lifted higher. Lift him up. Exalt his holy name. Lift him up. His name be lifted higher. Exalt his holy name.
[time=896] Lift him up.
[time=905] Thanks Denise.
[time=907] Already in our service today we've experienced a lot of different forms and styles of worship.
[time=916] And in all of that some of you have may have been more comfortable with one style than another.
[time=923] We've been anywhere from be thou my vision and holy holy holy to the last couple songs of praise and worship which might have had some of your feet moving.
[time=936] But in some of that perhaps some of you struggled a little bit or were uncomfortable or said at least that's not my preference of worship.
[time=946] Well today we're going to look at the issue of real worship. What is it?
[time=953] I'm going to admit to you today that I don't want to preach this sermon.
[time=958] There are a number of reasons why I don't want to give this message.
[time=962] In fact a couple weeks ago I went to Russ and suggested that perhaps it might be better someone else taught this sermon.
[time=970] Russ suggested that perhaps it might be better if I got ready preparing for it anyway.
[time=977] So here we are.
[time=981] I'm still reluctant and I don't want to preach this message because there's going to be so much that's left unsaid after we get done with it today.
[time=992] There's so much to learn in regards to what genuine true worship is all about.
[time=998] And we'll have the opportunity just to touch the surface of it today.
[time=1003] I also don't want to teach it because my own experience in genuine worship seems to be so lacking.
[time=1010] I mean I know this. I know I long for more.
[time=1013] I want more times of coming into the presence of God and responding to him with everything that I've got and even so.
[time=1022] I look at the pattern of my life and I have to be honest and admit there's not as much genuine worship as God longs for as he desires as he wants as there should be.
[time=1033] I also don't want to preach this message this morning because this is an issue that has become a contention in this church.
[time=1041] If you're visiting this morning, if you're watching on television it might be helpful for you to know that our church has been going through time of transition during the last couple years.
[time=1050] And one of the things that has been very affected in that transition has been this worship service.
[time=1055] In fact if you'd attended Black Hawk just a little over two years ago and then been away and come back this morning you would have noticed a lot of difference.
[time=1064] Things have changed.
[time=1066] And that change has been welcomed by some, has been difficult and even opposed by others.
[time=1072] And so it's a volatile issue for me to even speak on.
[time=1078] I think we face a couple temptations this morning.
[time=1082] Some of you will face a temptation of the hearing kind.
[time=1087] Because you have become so distraught and frustrated over the changes in worship at Black Hawk that you're going to be tempted to shut your ears to what I have to say.
[time=1095] Even if some of it is true you won't want to listen.
[time=1100] And I have a temptation to face this morning too.
[time=1104] It's a temptation of the speaking kind.
[time=1106] Because as I approach this issue I have felt the desire to use this pulpit as an opportunity to defend myself and to defend the decisions and changes that have been made in this church.
[time=1120] But I think if I were to do that I would be speaking my own words and not speaking the words of God.
[time=1124] I'd much rather us listen to what God has to say.
[time=1128] And consider what I hope are truths that will lead us to a better understanding of what real worship is all about.
[time=1137] So I invite you to join me in prayer before we even step into this.
[time=1142] Father it is my sincere desire this morning that as we look to you for an understanding of what real worship is that you would tell us.
[time=1152] That you would help us understand.
[time=1155] And God both in my heart and in the heart of the listeners I admit.
[time=1160] We admit that we commit an issue such as this with a lot of opinion, a lot of preference.
[time=1165] And that gets mixed up with truth.
[time=1168] Help us to distinguish one from the other this morning.
[time=1172] And change us Father.
[time=1174] Make us different because of it.
[time=1177] In Christ's name. Amen.
[time=1180] If you were to ask me about the times that I've experienced genuine worship in my life I would think of moments in my life when I had experienced a closeness to God.
[time=1192] I would think at times when I was a child growing up in a Christian family my father was an evangelist.
[time=1197] So we traveled a lot and visited a lot of different churches and a lot of different services.
[time=1202] Listen to a lot of hymns.
[time=1204] Listen to the sounds of a lot of church music.
[time=1207] And as a child I'm sure there were times when I was frustrated and not paying attention and I was squirmy.
[time=1212] But I can't remember those times even as a grade school student sitting in services sometimes by my mother.
[time=1219] And as the people would sing and as the instruments would play and as the hymns were sung I had a joy in singing those.
[time=1228] And I worshiped as a child in a way that I think pleased the Father.
[time=1233] I would think of the afternoon that I spent as a high school student in the basement of my home trying to come into a closeness with God.
[time=1244] Trying to understand who is it God that you are and what is it that you desire require of me.
[time=1250] Some of that time on the floor of my basement just seeking the heart of God and that was worship for me.
[time=1258] I think of the time on a clear night on the Mediterranean Sea as I slept in a sleeping bag on its shore and looked up into this clear sky and at the awesomeness of all that God had made.
[time=1271] I was led into worship that night.
[time=1274] Of times I've sat in churches alongside people who were moved to express themselves in both joy and sadness or brokenness.
[time=1284] I think of moments when I was acutely aware of God's presence while driving my car or while listening through headphones or while in a secluded cabin or in a crowded stadium.
[time=1301] Climbing a mountain or walking along a river bed I've had times of worship and there have been times in this very room that I've worshiped.
[time=1313] In those moments was I experiencing real worship?
[time=1317] Or was I going through some kind of emotion? What is real worship anyway?
[time=1323] Trying to explain worship to you is probably something like trying to describe what excitement means.
[time=1331] I can use the words but you would better understand if I could take you somewhere where you could see excitement in action.
[time=1339] If I could take you to the sixth game of the World Series, take you out on the field as the New York Yankees just mobbed one another and jumped on each other in this mass of human celebration, that's excitement.
[time=1355] If we could go into a closed darkened room where a group of friends are huddled together in silence waiting for the guest of honor to show up and the door opens and everyone yelled out "Surprise! Happy Birthday!"
[time=1368] That's excitement.
[time=1370] Or to take you into a living room as the children come down the steps on Christmas morning, you would see excitement and you would have an understanding of what excitement was because you saw it.
[time=1382] Well, in the same way, if we can somehow see what worship means, it will help us gain some understanding of what it really is.
[time=1390] We can see it in action.
[time=1391] So, I want to take a peek into Heaven's throne room and I'm going to read a passage I don't even want you to turn to.
[time=1397] I want you to listen and as you listen I want you to see it in your mind's eye.
[time=1402] What do you think this is like?
[time=1405] And just imagine although we are just thinking about this now, although we are just imagining this now, there is coming a day when this is going to be a reality to us.
[time=1415] We are going to experience things just like this.
[time=1419] John had the opportunity to peer into the throne room of Heaven and this is what he saw. Listen, see.
[time=1428] I was in the spirit and there before me was a throne in Heaven with someone sitting on it.
[time=1434] And the one who sat there had the appearance of Jasper, Carnelian.
[time=1438] And a rainbow resembling an emerald encircled the throne.
[time=1442] And surrounding the throne were 24 other thrones and seated on them were 24 elders.
[time=1447] And they were dressed in white and had crowns of gold on their heads.
[time=1451] And from the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings and peels of thunder.
[time=1457] And in the center around the throne were four living creatures and they were covered with eyes in front and behind.
[time=1463] The first living creature was like a lion. The second was like an ox.
[time=1468] The third had the face like a man and the fourth was like an eagle.
[time=1474] And each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all around even under his wings.
[time=1480] And day and night they never stopped saying holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty who was and is and is to come.
[time=1489] And whenever the living creatures gave glory honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne, the 24 elders fell down before him who sits on the throne and worshiped him who lives forever and ever.
[time=1500] And they lay their crowns before the throne and said you are worthy our Lord and God to receive glory and honor and power
[time=1507] for you created all things and by your will they were created and have their being.
[time=1513] Pretty awesome sight isn't it?
[time=1516] These beings in the very presence of God caused them to respond in a way that was active.
[time=1523] And if we took the time to look up every example in this book, every example of worship we would find the same thing
[time=1529] that encounters with God led people to an active response.
[time=1534] So let's try to put worship into a workable definition. Let me define it this way.
[time=1538] Worship is responding with all we are to all God is.
[time=1544] Worship is responding with everything we've got to everything that God is.
[time=1552] Now there will be some of you about this time or questioning the usefulness of a message like this.
[time=1558] I mean let's face it we've come through a couple months of very practical sermons.
[time=1563] We've learned on issues like loving hard to love people or understanding the sexual side of love or what it means to serve.
[time=1573] Those are useful topics, things that we can take home and do something with but worship?
[time=1580] Worship? Why should I care about worship?
[time=1583] I mean maybe we put worship on the same interest level as the business meetings at church.
[time=1588] We know they're important, they're probably necessary, but they're just not all that interesting.
[time=1594] I believe you should care about worship. You should care about worship for the same reasons my kids should care about respecting their mother
[time=1600] because it matters to me. It matters to me a lot.
[time=1606] And you should care about worship because it matters to God or not, whether or not you feel as though you care, whether or not you feel as though it matters, know this.
[time=1616] It matters to God. It matters to God a lot.
[time=1623] I want to look at a short text this morning. It's a familiar text.
[time=1626] A lot of times people turn to this when they speak on worship. It's found in the Gospel of John chapter 4.
[time=1632] A familiar story. Jesus has been walking a long way. He's tired. He rests alongside of a well.
[time=1638] In John chapter 4 a woman comes to him, or comes to the well.
[time=1643] She's a Samaritan woman. And because of the bias and prejudice of that day, this Samaritan woman, as she approached the well, had no expectation that Jesus, a Jew, would give her any attention at all.
[time=1655] But Jesus did. He spoke to her. And he conversed with her. And he pointed out some significant things in her life.
[time=1666] And he cared for her. And eventually their conversation led to this question in verse 19 of John chapter 4.
[time=1675] "Sir," the woman said, "I can see that you're a prophet." Now, our father's worshiped on this mountain. But you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem.
[time=1687] Sir, tell me, where do you think we should worship? Notice her question. Her question has to do with the externals of worship.
[time=1695] Where is the proper place for worship? And Jesus answers, but he doesn't answer her question in regards to where worship should take place.
[time=1705] Notice what Jesus says, verse 21. "Jesus declared, 'Believe me, woman, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.'"
[time=1714] Move to verse 23. "A time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks."
[time=1726] That's the kind of worshiper the Father seeks. God is looking for true worshipers.
[time=1733] People understand what real worship is all about. Now, notice what Jesus said. He said, "These kinds of people worship God in spirit."
[time=1743] That means that their worship is genuine and personal. It's not some empty form of religious ritual that is only external.
[time=1756] You see, it does no good to know what all the right steps to take might be. It doesn't do any good to know all the right information about God or the practice of religion.
[time=1766] Those things don't do any good unless we're led into a heartfelt worship of God. That's what it means to worship Him in spirit. It comes from the inside out.
[time=1775] We are involved. We participate with our whole being in the worship of God. We worship in spirit. And Jesus said, "Worshipers that my Father seeks are those who worship in spirit and in truth."
[time=1788] Now, what does it mean to worship in truth?
[time=1790] In truth, it means that when we worship God, we are worshiping everything that is true about Him. It's based on our proper understanding of who God is.
[time=1799] See, it doesn't do any good to be passionate in our worship if we're worshiping a lie.
[time=1806] Romans 1 tells us an interesting fact. Romans 1 tells us that God has made Himself known to everyone. Did you know that?
[time=1813] That everyone living on this earth has been approached by God in a way that allows Him to be known by them through His creation, through what God has made.
[time=1824] Romans 1 says, "There are things about God that are obvious to everyone." And it goes on to say that we in our humanity have this habit of turning away from the truth that should be obvious to us and instead embracing a lie.
[time=1839] So humanity turns away from what is obvious about God through what He has made and instead is more comfortable with embracing what is false.
[time=1848] And their worship of what is false, that sometimes it is passionate, sometimes it is sincere, oftentimes they are moved with great emotion to worship in that way.
[time=1861] They worship in spirit, but not in truth.
[time=1865] I was in college in Grand Rapids and I visited a well-known church there in that city.
[time=1873] And as I walked in on that Sunday morning, I was struck by the beauty of the place, a huge sanctuary with lofty ceiling and along the sides of the wall stained glass windows that reached up above.
[time=1888] It was beautiful. Rich wood decorated all around, up in the front, huge pipes through which the organ music played.
[time=1899] Beautiful. And the organ was playing as we came in. It was awesome.
[time=1903] The choir walked in, took their places and began to sing and the richness of their voices in that place.
[time=1908] And it was moving. And I tell you honestly, I don't think I have ever heard live vocal music that was as beautiful as that choir that morning.
[time=1918] And I was moved. I looked around at the other people there, the other members of the congregation, it was obvious that there were many of them that were moved as well.
[time=1927] They were worshiping in spirit.
[time=1930] But an interesting thing about this church is church did not believe that the Bible was the word of God.
[time=1937] This church does not believe that Jesus was God come in human form.
[time=1941] In fact, this church believed very little in regards to what the Bible teaches about the truth of God.
[time=1947] They worshiped in spirit, but not in truth.
[time=1955] Let's go back to the definition of worship. Worship is responding with all we are to all that God is.
[time=1965] Worship in spirit and worship in truth. How do we do that?
[time=1969] Let me suggest a couple things.
[time=1971] First of all, we need to seek encounters with God.
[time=1977] Seeking encounters with God. How does that sound to you? Does that sound a little strange?
[time=1981] A little out there, a little weird, a little, you know, something that maybe would be in a Star Trek movie out on a mission to pursue an encounter with God in the next dimension?
[time=1993] Or maybe something that they do in one of those wild churches, but we certainly wouldn't pursue an encounter with God here in a Baptist church now, would we?
[time=2003] Well, yes, we would, or at least we ought to. Now, before you get too concerned, I want to admit to you that I have never seen God.
[time=2015] I have never heard the voice of God. I have never experienced, personally, of what I can attribute a miraculous sign of the presence of God.
[time=2028] There have been times I have longed for those things, but I have never experienced any of that.
[time=2036] But knowing God and experiencing the reality of Him and His presence in the world around me is, it is honestly one of the deepest longings of my heart.
[time=2046] You get down there underneath everything, and that's what I long for most.
[time=2050] To know God and to experience God in a way that is meaningful, in a way that is true.
[time=2057] It may not be in the miraculous, but in whatever way I can meet God, that's what my heart longs for.
[time=2062] And sometimes that longing, well, it's been almost to the point of painfulness.
[time=2070] That kind of longing has been expressed in some of the songs we've already sung this morning.
[time=2074] More love, more power, more of you in my life.
[time=2080] Be thou my vision, O Lord of my heart, those are songs of longing for an encounter with God.
[time=2088] I've had encounters with God.
[time=2090] Sometimes while reading is word, sometimes while listening to a song, sometimes while spending time in quiet reflection or in prayer,
[time=2098] sometimes while listening to someone else talk about God or seeing the testimony of someone else's life as they've been changed by the work of God.
[time=2107] In those times, my heart connects with the heart of God.
[time=2112] And it might be a moment of joy that I can't even describe, or it might be a time of brokenness that is very profound.
[time=2119] But either way, I go away from that experience different. I go away changed, and I am led to worship God.
[time=2126] Seeking an encounter with God simply means that you look for ways to go beyond knowing about Him or even being aware of Him,
[time=2133] but you pursue knowing Him and experiencing Him.
[time=2136] Now the Bible, God calls us to experience Him and know Him in those kinds of ways.
[time=2140] Jeremiah says, "You will seek me and find me when you search for me with all your heart." Hebrews 11 says, "Without faith it is impossible to please God because anyone who comes to Him must believe that He exists
[time=2151] and that He rewards those who earnestly seek Him." James 4, "Come near to God and He will come near to you." It means spending personal time with God.
[time=2162] And let me suggest this, for some of you, it means that you need to stop doing your Bible study so that you can spend time with God.
[time=2171] That's right.
[time=2173] I think some of you probably need to stop doing your Bible study so you can spend time with God.
[time=2180] Bible study and spending time with God aren't necessarily the same thing.
[time=2184] I know many people, and I'm including myself in this, who have fallen into the trap of thinking that Bible study or prayer or witnessing to others or going to church or any of the spiritual disciplines is the goal in itself.
[time=2195] You know, if I can just keep faithfully doing these things, God's going to bless me.
[time=2202] And that's just what the Pharisees were in the habit of doing.
[time=2206] They took religious duty and made it the measure of their spiritual success.
[time=2210] Listen, God never intended Bible study or any of the other things to be the goal of your life.
[time=2215] God is the goal of our life.
[time=2219] It's the pursuit of God.
[time=2221] It's knowing and experiencing Him.
[time=2223] See, when this becomes my goal, when my goal is to get into this book every day
[time=2230] and to have my Bible study and devotions every day and not to miss, I become rather frustrated with the routine of that in my life.
[time=2240] And I bet some of you could give the same testimony in your own life.
[time=2243] You've longed to be regular in the routine and the discipline of Bible study, but you just couldn't stay with it.
[time=2249] I think part of the reason is we have our focus wrong.
[time=2252] We're looking at this as the goal.
[time=2254] This is the objective.
[time=2255] It's not.
[time=2256] God is the goal.
[time=2257] God is the objective.
[time=2259] If I have in the long in my heart the desire to know Him and to draw close to Him and to experience Him no matter what it takes,
[time=2265] I'm going to find that a natural result of that is going to be that I'm going to be drawn to spend time with Him in His Word.
[time=2271] I'm going to be drawn to spend time with Him in prayer.
[time=2273] I'm going to be sharing the impact He's having in my life with other people.
[time=2276] I'm going to want to come together to the church and corporate worship with other believers.
[time=2281] Those are going to be the result of pursuing God.
[time=2284] It's not the end in itself.
[time=2286] It comes as a result of seeking after God.
[time=2293] Are you seeking encounters with God?
[time=2295] You take time to be alone with Him.
[time=2299] Do you make time to do that in your life?
[time=2305] Let me ask another question.
[time=2307] Why did you come to church today?
[time=2309] Honestly, really.
[time=2311] Why did you come to church today?
[time=2315] What was on your mind as you got up this morning, as you got yourself ready, as you drove here?
[time=2322] I've got five kids. I know it was going through some of your minds as you did all that this morning.
[time=2331] As you walked in through the doors of this room, did you come with the hope of meeting God today?
[time=2339] Did you even dare give a thought to the possibility that somehow today God might meet you in some way that was new?
[time=2348] That you might gain some new understanding of who He is or that by His Spirit He might come close to you as you come close to Him?
[time=2355] Did you think about that? Did you expect that at all?
[time=2360] Could it be that the reason why many of our churches don't experience times of real worship is simply because people don't come expecting an encounter with God?
[time=2371] Church becomes routine. Real worship.
[time=2376] Responding with all we are to all God is means that first of all we will seek encounters with God.
[time=2384] Secondly, it means that we will be willing to respond in every appropriate way.
[time=2389] When we encounter God, I need to be willing to respond to that encounter in every way that may be appropriate.
[time=2396] Real worship requires a response. That's why we come together.
[time=2401] One hymn writer put it this way, "Come Christians, join to sing. Hallelujah, Amen."
[time=2408] We join together to sing.
[time=2411] In my last church when I was serving in Michigan a number of years ago, the secretary, she prepared the bulletin for Sunday, put down this song as the call to worship.
[time=2422] And she made a typo. So as the people came to church that day, they were called to worship with "Come Christians, join to sin."
[time=2433] Which may be more true of many churches than we'd want to admit.
[time=2438] But we are called to come and to sing and to worship God together.
[time=2445] We come together to respond as a family to our Father. And there is no such thing as spectator worship.
[time=2452] I'm just going to come watch. I'm going to come observe. You can't worship in that kind of way.
[time=2458] Spectator worship is an oxymoron. They don't go together.
[time=2462] It's like saying that I'm somehow going to become healthy by going out and observing the guys working out at the gym.
[time=2470] I'm going to, it's spectator exercise. That's what I'm into. I'm going to go watch.
[time=2475] And I watch them go through their disciplines and their routines and I watch the sweat break out on their faces.
[time=2480] Man, that inspires me. It does something to me. And somehow that's just going to make me healthy.
[time=2485] There's no such thing as spectator exercise. Just like there's no such thing as spectator worship.
[time=2494] We are called to participate. It demands participation. Well, how do we participate? How do we respond to God?
[time=2502] Do you want to be biblical in your responses to worship? We don't have time to look through all the examples.
[time=2507] But let me just put up a list of some of the ways people in the Bible responded to God.
[time=2511] Here they are in the screen. The Bible says that they all stood and worshiped.
[time=2516] Says they sing praises. Speak of all his wonders. Praise God with instruments.
[time=2525] They bowed in worship. Let us kneel before the Lord. Shout joyfully to the Lord.
[time=2533] Sometimes you just got to let one out. Lift up your hands. Now there's one for you in the Baptist Church.
[time=2543] I don't know how many times the last couple of years I've had people come and say is it okay?
[time=2548] Sometimes when we're singing and worshiping I want to lift my hands but no one does it.
[time=2553] I don't know if you're supposed to do it in the Baptist Church. I don't know either if you're supposed to do it in the Baptist Church.
[time=2558] I do know this. David was a man after God's own heart.
[time=2562] And over and over in the Psalms he talks about lifting his hands and praise and worship to God.
[time=2566] Now it's a style that a lot of you aren't comfortable with because you weren't brought up with it and that's okay.
[time=2570] But if God moves you to genuinely, honestly, worship him in the symbol of raising your hands in submission and openness to him,
[time=2579] being ready to receive and accept anything he wants to give you, that is an acceptable, a great way to worship.
[time=2587] I don't know about this. Next one. Praise him with dancing. We might have to move to that one eventually.
[time=2593] But dancing in Scripture, I remember being at a conference when I was in junior high. I grew up in the church very similar to this one.
[time=2602] I was a Christian conference and in the in between times when music was being played I was in a group of college students
[time=2610] that got in a circle and began doing this kind of folk dance to Christian music.
[time=2616] I was really confused because I was brought up believing that any form of dancing, I mean it was from the pit.
[time=2625] And if you're praising God you better not wiggle at all.
[time=2632] And yet there are many, many examples in Scripture of people who in their abandonment and their worship of God express that in the form of dance.
[time=2642] And you know what? That's beautiful in God's sight.
[time=2649] There are many different ways of expressing our worship to God.
[time=2654] But not only are there various expressions of worship which are a delight to God but, and here's where I need you to be patient as you listen to me.
[time=2664] The expression and style of worship changes from place to place and from time to time.
[time=2672] There were drastic changes in the styles of worship from the time of Adam to the time of Moses.
[time=2677] And changes from the time of Moses to the time of David.
[time=2680] And from the time of David to the time of Jesus.
[time=2683] And from Jesus worship to the worship of that early church.
[time=2686] And from the worship of that early church through the centuries to the worship of today.
[time=2690] Listen, God gives us a lot of freedom when it comes to our worship of him.
[time=2695] And worshiping him in ways that are personal and meaningful to us.
[time=2700] But there's the struggle.
[time=2703] Because what happens when I am worshiping God in a way, in a manner that has become meaningful to him.
[time=2710] And I associate with the heart response to the greatness of God.
[time=2715] And then I'm surrounded by people that begin worshiping in other ways.
[time=2720] And if I feel that my way of worship is becoming neglected.
[time=2726] Some of you have wrestled with that dilemma, haven't you?
[time=2731] You're not alone.
[time=2733] Christians throughout the centuries have faced the same sense of confusion when it comes to the changes that affected their worship.
[time=2738] Can I just give you a few examples?
[time=2742] Let me put up a list of concerns compiled by one prominent American clergyman.
[time=2749] Reasons for opposing some of the newer trends in Christian music.
[time=2753] Here's what he writes.
[time=2755] It's too new like an unknown language.
[time=2758] It's not melodious as in the more established style.
[time=2762] There are so many new songs that it's impossible to learn them all.
[time=2766] It places too much emphasis on instrumental music rather than godly lyrics.
[time=2771] And the lyrics are often worldly.
[time=2774] Does that sound familiar?
[time=2776] That was a list put together by a preacher in 1723.
[time=2780] And his arguments against the new menace known as singing hymns in the church.
[time=2786] And the church struggled with the change.
[time=2790] Angelus Charles Finney wrote about some of the conflicts facing churches in the mid-1800s, in regards to hymns he wrote this.
[time=2796] Even now, in a great many congregations, there are people who will rise and leave if a psalm or hymn is given out of a new book.
[time=2804] He wrote about choirs.
[time=2806] How many congregations were torn and rent and sundered by the desire of ministers to form choirs?
[time=2811] People coming to churches because singers were seated by themselves.
[time=2816] And thought great evils were coming upon the church.
[time=2819] These people were learning new tunes that the older people could not sing.
[time=2823] And he also wrote, "It was seriously talked by of some as a matter worthy of discipline that they had an organ in the house of God."
[time=2832] This was only a few years ago and there are many churches still that will not tolerate an organ.
[time=2838] That's what Charles Finney wrote in the mid-1800s.
[time=2841] In the 1500s, Martin Luther outraged his spiritual colleagues by borrowing popular drinking songs, pub songs,
[time=2851] borrowing their melodies and putting Christian lyrics to them.
[time=2855] But today, these same songs, songs like "A Mighty Fortresses Are God" and "A Way in a Manger" are considered Christian classics.
[time=2864] Many of the songs contained in our hymn book faced immediate rejection because they were written in styles that were culturally relevant,
[time=2871] but the church opposed the change.
[time=2873] Now what's my point?
[time=2876] Please, I hope some of you will not become defensive or think that I'm trying to ram a perspective down your throat.
[time=2883] My point is simply this, that change is not the enemy of the church.
[time=2887] We have to stop thinking that change is the enemy of the church.
[time=2893] There is change that is perfectly acceptable to God and even desirable in the church.
[time=2899] Other change that is not, but change is not the enemy.
[time=2903] We at Blackhawk are a church made up of people with different backgrounds.
[time=2907] We are drawn to various styles of worship.
[time=2910] And we need to move away from judgment towards tolerance and then move from tolerance to appreciation.
[time=2919] Now please don't misunderstand me, I'm not suggesting that you need to abandon the kind of worship style that you've become accustomed to,
[time=2926] that connects best with you.
[time=2929] For many of you, that is never going to change and it doesn't need to.
[time=2934] But what I am saying is that we all need to be careful that we don't make moral judgment against styles which are different than our own,
[time=2942] just because they're different.
[time=2944] That's the drama team, if they're, they would come.
[time=2947] And I want you to listen as they give testimonies of worship that is meaningful to them,
[time=2954] ways that they go about connecting with God and responding to those encounters, and listen for the things that are different in their stories and listen for those things that are the same.
[time=2971] My worship begins even before the service on Sunday mornings.
[time=2974] As I'm getting dressed, I take a few minutes to pray and tune into God so that I'm ready to participate in the service.
[time=2980] At church, I love to stand up and sing those praise courses clapping along with the rest of the congregation.
[time=2986] The band blends the songs one into another, expressing what's in my own heart.
[time=2991] Sometimes I don't sing, but just listen and reflect in the privacy of my own thoughts, and I praise God for who he is.
[time=3000] Some weeks I don't feel much like worshiping, but if I allow myself to focus on the music and the words and the scriptures that are read,
[time=3008] I get caught up in the spirit of worship anyway.
[time=3011] When it comes time for the pastor to give his sermon, I feel like I'm really in touch and ready to receive a message from God in his word.
[time=3018] Worship for me is personally uplifting. I like it when my emotions can be involved.
[time=3023] When I was a little girl, I would sometimes go to church with my grandma.
[time=3027] I can still see myself sitting on the pew next to her with my can, can, petticoats scratching against my legs and smelling her lilac perfume.
[time=3036] But what I remember most is what she called the worship service, those great hymns and the anthems from the choir.
[time=3043] I remember saying all the words to the Apostles Creed in the Lord's Prayer, the doxology.
[time=3050] There was a comfort, a warmth in the familiarity of those words, like pulling up a favorite warm blanket on a chilly night.
[time=3060] Even now as an adult, I still go back to those old hymns and words, how God is our refuge, a mighty fortress, a firm foundation.
[time=3071] To me, that's worship, being reminded of the splendor and the holiness of God.
[time=3078] I'm most apt to worship God at 5.45 every morning when I'm sitting in my study, having my quiet time alone with God.
[time=3089] I'm wrapped in my faded terry cloth robe and a steam from the coffee mug fogs my glasses.
[time=3097] I'll spend some time in prayer confessing to God what he already knows.
[time=3104] I'll pray for my wife, the kids, the guys that work the day ahead of me.
[time=3110] Then I'll read a passage from the Bible or maybe read through a hymn or a devotional guide.
[time=3116] Then I'll just talk to God about what I've just read.
[time=3121] I feel so close to him during those times, it's like he's right there with me.
[time=3126] Once when I was reading about Ezekiel and how he fell face downward because he could not stand up in the presence of the Lord,
[time=3136] I was moved to get off my chair and get on the floor too.
[time=3141] The awesome power of God gripped me so I was still on the floor worshiping when my wife got up and found me there.
[time=3149] How little explaining to do.
[time=3152] Once I have spent time in his presence, I feel as though I can go through the whole day with him.
[time=3162] Everything I do, I try to do to his honor and to his glory.
[time=3168] To me that's worship.
[time=3171] I've got some wooded property out behind my house.
[time=3175] It's pretty much wild, I've not tried to clear it.
[time=3178] Some evenings after supper, if it's still right, I like to walk out there and just relax.
[time=3185] Especially in the time of year when the air has a bite to it and the leaves have turned,
[time=3191] I just settle my thoughts and just walk.
[time=3196] It's funny, but most of the time my thoughts turn to the Lord out there in his creation.
[time=3202] Do you blame me?
[time=3205] I can really worship God out there, and I think of songs.
[time=3210] And I'll start singing anything from how great thou art to God is good.
[time=3216] You know, this life is so rushed and removed from what he has made.
[time=3222] I really like to worship God out there in his creation though.
[time=3226] I'll carry a phrase or a thought that I've read with me throughout the whole day and just mull it over.
[time=3234] I meditate on it.
[time=3236] I like to find new ways to look at familiar verses.
[time=3239] When the choir would sing, I'd close my eyes and pretend I was hearing an angel choir from heaven.
[time=3245] Oh, the music was so beautiful.
[time=3248] The harmonies, the organ.
[time=3252] I talked to God out there in the woods.
[time=3255] Got this squirrel that has a nest in this half down elm.
[time=3260] He thinks I'm nutting her and he is, but I don't care.
[time=3264] When I'm out there, it's just me and the Lord.
[time=3267] It's like I fall in love with God all over again.
[time=3270] I need that time in my week to recharge my spiritual batteries.
[time=3274] Some days I'll find myself singing the songs while I'm at work or at home.
[time=3278] Worship is something I do that shows what I feel inside.
[time=3281] It's not a passive thing.
[time=3283] It's an active response to God.
[time=3285] Worship is remembering.
[time=3287] Recognizing God's attributes.
[time=3289] It declares the worth of God.
[time=3291] It gives glory to His name.
[time=3293] Worship is acknowledging and enjoying God's presence.
[time=3297] It's appreciation.
[time=3299] Worship is seeking to conform to God's image through His word, adoring the character of God.
[time=3304] Being amazed at the person and works of God.
[time=3307] When I allow myself to focus on Him, it is a time that can be both intense and exhilarating.
[time=3314] Worship is life-changing.
[time=3316] Life-challenging.
[time=3317] It's a challenge to change.
[time=3319] Worship is praise.
[time=3321] Participation.
[time=3322] Preparation.
[time=3323] Something we were made to do.
[time=3325] Worship is obedience.
[time=3326] Obedience is worship.
[time=3327] Worship is service.
[time=3329] Celebration.
[time=3330] Singing.
[time=3331] Shouting.
[time=3332] Worship is meditating.
[time=3333] Moving.
[time=3334] Movement.
[time=3335] Being moved.
[time=3336] Prayer.
[time=3337] Giving.
[time=3338] Praising.
[time=3339] Personal.
[time=3340] Community.
[time=3341] Communion.
[time=3342] Deliberate.
[time=3343] Worship is a matter of the will.
[time=3345] It's a matter of the emotion.
[time=3346] It's an act of love.
[time=3348] Worship is a matter of the heart.
[time=3350] A matter of the heart.
[time=3352] Heart.
[time=3354] (Applause)
[time=3365] The woman asked Jesus, "Where should we worship?" Jesus said, "Let me change the question." What kind of worshipers do the Father seek?
[time=3377] Those who worship Him in spirit and in truth.
[time=3380] Worship is a matter of the heart.
[time=3382] And each of us, we worship a little differently.
[time=3386] Most of you have grown up in the church.
[time=3388] You have a rich heritage that includes some of the more traditional styles of worship.
[time=3392] Those are always going to be meaningful to you.
[time=3394] Some of you come out of a little or no church background.
[time=3398] And walking into a church like ours can be somewhat of a culture shock.
[time=3403] Your preference will tend to be for music which is more contemporary, progressive.
[time=3408] Please listen to me, all of you, no matter what your style or preference is.
[time=3413] You will do the church no good if you insist that your way is the best way.
[time=3417] There is no best style of worship.
[time=3426] God seeks true worshipers who will worship Him in spirit and truth.
[time=3430] There is not much in this book about what style is written there.
[time=3434] Now it is true that there is going to be a style that leads you to worship more readily that helps you connect with the heart of God.
[time=3442] But there is no best style of worship.
[time=3445] You just can't make that judgment based on the authority of God's Word.
[time=3449] I want to say something to those of you who are moved by the music of Michael W. Smith and Petra and Charlie Peacock and D.C. Talk and other contemporary authors and singers
[time=3459] and musicians.
[time=3461] When you come to this church and you look across the aisle and you see that man who smiles at the sounds of the organ and clutches the hymnal as he sings the hymn that he obviously enjoys.
[time=3472] Do you judge him?
[time=3474] Do you look down on him?
[time=3478] Do you look at that something being out of touch with the times, being old-fashioned?
[time=3485] Don't, don't.
[time=3489] That is your brother in Christ.
[time=3491] And God calls you to love him and in your love learn to appreciate his differences.
[time=3498] For those of you who long for the sounds of great as thy faithfulness and the old rugged cross, I want you to look across the aisle too.
[time=3505] I want you to see that woman who sways a little bit to the beat of the music.
[time=3509] She seems to like the songs that are fast and loud.
[time=3512] Do you judge her?
[time=3514] Don't.
[time=3515] Because she is your sister in Christ and Christ calls you to love her.
[time=3520] And in your love learn to appreciate her differences.
[time=3526] In a moment, I'll give you our address so you can receive a copy of Lessons on Assurance.
