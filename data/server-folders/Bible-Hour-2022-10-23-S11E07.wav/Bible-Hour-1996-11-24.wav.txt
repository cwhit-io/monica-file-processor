[time=30] Thank you for joining us.
[time=53] Stay with us today as Pastor Moore brings us a message entitled "Thanks That Doesn't Quit." Now let's join our service.
[time=89] [MUSIC - 105 seconds]
[time=208] As I walk through this life, there are uncertain times when I lose sight of the reason I believe.
[time=230] Should I give him to sin, or allow for defeat?
[time=242] I wonder how can he forgive?
[time=252] Then I'm reminded that faithless he loves me faithfully.
[time=263] And that moment at that moment his grace is sufficient for me.
[time=275] [MUSIC - 348 seconds]
[time=633] [APPLAUSE]
[time=636] Hi, my name is Russell Moore, and I want to welcome you to the Bible Hour, and thank you for joining us again today.
[time=642] What's exciting, isn't it? The season is changing, and Thanksgiving, and Christmas, and it's time for family and friends,
[time=648] and a very unique and wonderful time, I think, to talk to people about the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=654] There's no better time in most ways. I mean, the culture, the day, the whole feeling.
[time=660] People are interested in spiritual things, and people are aware of the fact that we're coming near to Christ's birthday.
[time=665] And I trust that you'll have a great opportunity in this holiday season to talk to some friends who don't yet know Christ as personal Lord and Savior.
[time=673] And maybe just say something that moves them a little bit closer to a relationship with Christ.
[time=679] Well, that, of course, is what the Bible Hour is all about. We do that every week of the year.
[time=684] We preach God's Word as clearly and as powerfully as we know how, and we lift up the person of Jesus Christ, so that others who do not know Him, who tune into the Bible Hour, will come to an understanding of who He is
[time=695] and the transforming power that resides in the person of Christ, and the way their life can be changed through a relationship with Christ.
[time=702] And we don't do this very often. Once a year, in fact, we make an appeal to those of you who watch the Bible Hour to make a financial contribution to support this ministry.
[time=712] The way we do that is through a ministry called the Founders Club, and that's people just like you who have watched the Bible Hour,
[time=719] who support the ministry of the Bible Hour, who believe in what's being communicated, and want to help support it in a financial way so that its message can continue to be lifted out through the airwaves.
[time=730] To join the Founders Club, it involves a commitment of $15 a month, and you can see our address on the screen in a phone number.
[time=738] If you'd like to write us or call us, we'd love to talk to you about how we can sign you up to be a part of the Founders Club,
[time=745] be a part of that special group of people that have it in their hearts to extend the ministry of the Bible Hour so that people can hear about Christ
[time=753] and have every opportunity to make a decision to accept Christ as personal Lord and Savior, to hear the wonderful, life-transforming message of the love of God,
[time=762] the grace of God, and the power of God to change lives.
[time=766] Well, we're excited that you watched the Bible Hour, and we would be thankful if you join in those who support it on a weekly basis.
[time=773] God bless you.
[time=783] [MUSIC] Even if I stand here before you [MUSIC] Thinking of the graces I have received [MUSIC] I am so amazed by your wonders [MUSIC] Every seed, every start, and this life that I breathe [MUSIC] How can I express the joy that's in my soul [MUSIC] Jesus, I want you to know [MUSIC] What I thought I could be [MUSIC] I could never, I could never [MUSIC] Just this time [MUSIC] Even if I stand here before you [MUSIC] Still there is a distance high, long to close [MUSIC] What I want to know is what I'm trying to do [MUSIC] I want to clean like a child [MUSIC] To the folds of your own [MUSIC] 'Cause you're my child [MUSIC] Oh, does this tell me [MUSIC] Let's sing our part [MUSIC] What I thought I could be [MUSIC] Of my life, oh, oh [MUSIC] Oh, that love for you [MUSIC] The lovely, oh, oh [MUSIC] Does this to me [MUSIC] I freely choose to do your way [MUSIC] 'Cause every moment of my love [MUSIC] Is long and I want you to feel [MUSIC] Only your way [MUSIC] Does this to me [MUSIC] What I thought I could be [MUSIC] My father could be [MUSIC] And the lovely, oh, oh [MUSIC] Does this to me [MUSIC] Only your love [MUSIC] Let's sing our part [MUSIC] What I thought I could be [MUSIC] I thought I could be [MUSIC] And the lovely, oh, oh [MUSIC] Does this to me [MUSIC] Only your love [MUSIC] Only your love [MUSIC] Oh, oh, oh â™ª
[time=995] - Thank you, Lynn.
[time=997] Let me invite you to open your Bible to Hebrews chapter 10.
[time=1000] We're going to start there this morning and eventually end up in Ephesians 1.
[time=1004] We're actually going to study the book of Ephesians.
[time=1006] We started it last week and we're going to continue in it.
[time=1009] But I want to start Ephesians 10.
[time=1011] It'll get us kind of in a good way.
[time=1013] And then after I'm done this morning, we're going to have a time of responsive worship.
[time=1017] And I trust you'll be prepared in your heart for that.
[time=1020] We're going to leave some time and there'll be some songs in a prayer time.
[time=1023] It should be a great, great thing.
[time=1026] Hebrews chapter 10, we're going to leave verses 32 and following as we get going.
[time=1031] Christianity isn't enough.
[time=1034] It's basically what they were saying.
[time=1036] Christianity, for whatever reason, isn't working for me anymore.
[time=1041] Oh, it was great at first.
[time=1043] I mean, back when things were fresh and new, back when we'd just come to Christ, back when we just had the sense, the forgiveness of our sins that we've been washed and we've been cleansed, we were so excited.
[time=1055] All we could think about, all we could talk about was Christ and walking with Christ.
[time=1060] It felt as though God was walking with us every day.
[time=1064] They were saying to themselves, Christ used to be so real to us in our daily lives.
[time=1071] Early on, He was just there all the time.
[time=1074] When they were persecuting us, it didn't matter because we were walking with Christ.
[time=1078] They made public spectacle of us and it didn't matter.
[time=1081] We were walking with Christ.
[time=1083] Imprisonment, we were walking with Christ.
[time=1086] The seizure of our property, walking with Christ.
[time=1089] I mean, back then in the early days, it was so fresh and so real and so powerful.
[time=1097] The fact is that was a memory to them now.
[time=1101] Christ had somehow lost sway in their life.
[time=1106] And the spiritual things that used to move them didn't move them.
[time=1109] The spiritual values they used to hold on to were now still held by them, but they didn't have the emotional component and the mental component.
[time=1116] And it wasn't enough to kind of make decisions for them any longer.
[time=1120] And they were drifting and they were wandering.
[time=1123] They didn't know where it went, but it felt flat.
[time=1126] It felt ordinary.
[time=1127] It felt regular.
[time=1128] It felt routine.
[time=1129] It felt dead.
[time=1131] They didn't know what to do about it.
[time=1133] Some of them were considering going back into Judaism.
[time=1136] Some were saying, "We better just go back into the religion we had before we got Christ." Because Christ isn't working anymore.
[time=1142] And so numbers of them were going back into the external forms of sacrifices and rituals and the externals of Judaism.
[time=1150] Others of them had heard.
[time=1152] There was another church over in Colossae and things had gone flat for them, but they seemed to work it out.
[time=1159] They got some new philosophy going.
[time=1161] They said Christ wasn't enough, but Christ plus human philosophy and Christ plus mysticism
[time=1167] and Christ plus legalism and asceticism.
[time=1170] And they were adding all kinds of new kind of nuances to religion.
[time=1174] And they were revitalized again.
[time=1178] Some of them were looking in those directions.
[time=1181] Others of them kind of just said, "Well, you know what I'll tell you for me.
[time=1184] I'm not going back to Judaism and I'm not going onto some newer, higher form of religion.
[time=1188] I'll just kind of believe in Christ, but frankly on a day-to-day basis I'm just going to live for the things of the world.
[time=1195] I mean, if you want to know what's going to preoccupy my heart and mind, if you want to know what gets me up in the morning, if you want to know what I'm excited about, I mean, you really want to know what drives me.
[time=1205] Well, I'm not going to reject Christ.
[time=1208] But to be honest, I'm probably going to be a whole lot more motivated by material things and my career and stuff like that.
[time=1216] And I'll just have Christ on the side.
[time=1219] Look at Hebrews, chapter 10, verses 32 and following.
[time=1222] It says, "But remember the former days." And I think by that if you read the book you'll understand the former days were the days when things were hot.
[time=1230] The days when they'd just come to Christ.
[time=1232] The days when they'd just, as it says in verse 32, been enlightened.
[time=1236] When they'd first got their glimpse of Christ.
[time=1240] Verse 32 says, "You endured a great conflict of suffering, partly by being made a public spectacle through approaches and tribulations and partly by becoming shares with those who were so treated." Verse 34, "For you showed sympathy to the prisoners and accepted joyfully the seizure of your property,
[time=1258] knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and an abiding one.
[time=1264] Therefore, do not throw away your confidence." Verse 36, "You have need of endurance so that when you have done the will of God you may receive what was promised."
[time=1275] Somewhere along the line it went flat for these folks.
[time=1278] Somewhere along the line the things that drew them out of Judaism to take a bold hard stand against public accusation, against the seizure of property, against imprisonment.
[time=1287] Whatever that fervor, whatever that heat, whatever that stuff that was going on between them and Jesus,
[time=1293] it was a long gone memory now.
[time=1296] And the hot fires of faith had now just kind of ebbed out to barely a little cold,
[time=1303] just embers that were barely hanging on for life.
[time=1307] The process is called losing faith.
[time=1311] Chapter 11, verse 1, "Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen."
[time=1317] Somewhere along the line, slowly but surely day after day, little by little, deep profound convictions of the things of God lost their grip on the heart of these Hebrews.
[time=1330] They were no longer assured of the thing's future.
[time=1334] They no longer had a deep conviction about the things not seen.
[time=1340] Great numbers of us here this morning are losing faith.
[time=1343] Great numbers of us this morning are in the process of the little step by step where the things of God and the things of Jesus and the unseen spiritual realities are losing their ability to impact us as they used to.
[time=1361] The pursuit of God is no longer as sincere or as hot.
[time=1365] Following his priorities for our lives are no longer as meaningful.
[time=1368] Obedience just isn't quite the issue with us that it used to be.
[time=1372] Finding and understanding and studying and knowing his truth just isn't kind of what it used to be for us.
[time=1377] Having deep intimate community and fellowship with brothers and sisters in Christ just really isn't all that it was cranked up to be or the way we used to know it.
[time=1386] And somehow we lose a sense of appreciation.
[time=1389] Somehow we lose a proper valuing so that it no longer impacts us the way that it ought to, the way that it used to.
[time=1397] Oh yeah, I remember really well.
[time=1400] I was 20 years old. I was in a cement truck. I was in the middle of Los Angeles.
[time=1404] I had tears in my eyes. I got enlightened. It dawned on me that God could forgive me for all that I'd ever done, ever would do in the future, that I was washed and cleansed.
[time=1414] It was the thing I didn't think I'd ever get over it completely.
[time=1418] You remember the time you were saved. You remember that first year. You remember that walk with God.
[time=1422] You remember the intensity and the zeal and the desire to have knowledge and understanding and the pursuit of God.
[time=1431] You say to yourself, man, where'd that go? Where did all that go?
[time=1436] Why am I now so easily preoccupied by other things?
[time=1440] Important things, good things, ought to be things. It's not that the things are wrong.
[time=1446] It's not wrong to have a career. It's not wrong to look forward to this or that or the other, but why does it seem to get the hold on my heart that used to be the hold of Christ?
[time=1456] And what can be done about it?
[time=1460] Well, that sets the backdrop, I think, for our study of Ephesians chapter 1. Why don't you come there with me?
[time=1466] Because the thing that's going on here this morning in Ephesians 1 is something that I had never really seen or appreciated before.
[time=1474] It's an amazing thing. Paul says the solution to that problem, and it's a many faceted solution, but one component,
[time=1484] one very important thing which I find conspicuously absent in my personal life.
[time=1489] And as I checked with some fellow believers this week, they kind of scratched their head and said, man, that's missing in my life, too.
[time=1496] It's found right here in Ephesians 1 to remedy the losing of faith, to remedy the devaluing of spiritual reality.
[time=1506] It's a prayer, really. You remember from last Sunday, I mean, he opened up with the list of blessings that God has given us.
[time=1513] Chapter 1, verse 3, God has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places.
[time=1517] He's made us holy and blameless in verse 4. He's adopted us as sons in verse 5, redemption through his blood in verse 7.
[time=1524] The inheritance in verse 11, sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise in verse 13.
[time=1529] I mean, that's it, folks. That's all God could possibly give in the spiritual arena.
[time=1533] Everything pertaining to life and godliness is ours in Christ.
[time=1538] And he just dumps this load of spiritual blessing in our laps in the beginning of Ephesians 1.
[time=1547] But he starts praying in verse 15, and the prayer goes all the way into the chapter, all the way to 23.
[time=1552] He opens the prayer in verses 15 and 16, just kind of with a general expression of gratitude for their faith.
[time=1558] For this reason I, too, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus Christ which exists among you,
[time=1564] and your love for all the saints, do not cease giving thanks for you while making mention of you in my prayers.
[time=1571] That's very basic. You say, man, I'm glad, I'm thankful, I'm excited.
[time=1575] Your faith is found in Christ and in evidences itself and a profound love for the believers.
[time=1583] But then he gets to the heart of his prayer in verses 17 and 18, and this is what I found so intriguing.
[time=1588] Verse 17, that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, now this is the request,
[time=1596] may give to you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of him.
[time=1603] Verse 18, I pray, this is the request, I ask that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened.
[time=1612] Now stop right there.
[time=1615] Paul gets down on his knees, having dumped the spiritual load at the beginning of the chapter, and he says, now God, make it real to them.
[time=1624] Make it matter to them.
[time=1626] Give them a spirit of wisdom and revelation.
[time=1630] The word spirit there, some of you have translations and the S is capitalized.
[time=1633] It's like it's trying to say it's the Holy Spirit. It is not the Holy Spirit.
[time=1637] There is no definite article. It is A Spirit, which only leaves a couple of options, the human spirit.
[time=1643] And he's not praying for us to get that, we already have that.
[time=1647] These people already have the Holy Spirit, and they already have a human spirit.
[time=1651] What he's praying for is the other usage of that word, which is, it connotates an attitude.
[time=1656] They had spirited play. She's down in spirits.
[time=1660] That's the notion here. What he's saying is, oh God, give them an attitude.
[time=1665] Give them a disposition and a demeanor that fully understands what it means to be in Christ.
[time=1672] That's what he's praying.
[time=1674] The word knowledge means to perceive. It means to apprehend.
[time=1677] It means to be able to look at and recognize what you're looking at.
[time=1683] He says in verse 18, that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened.
[time=1689] The analogy that came to my mind, it would be as if you're walking through the woods and you stop somewhere and you have an awareness of what's around you.
[time=1697] There's some trees around you, some leaves on the ground.
[time=1699] There's some sticks on the ground. You're just there. That's what it is.
[time=1705] All of a sudden you take a little harder look at that stick on the ground.
[time=1708] The eyes of your heart are enlightened.
[time=1711] You've gained a spirit of knowledge and wisdom about that stick, and it dawns on you that that stick is not a stick, it's a snake, and it's a poisonous snake.
[time=1721] And suddenly you're now impacted by a preexisting reality.
[time=1725] Nothing changed in reality. It was always a poisonous snake, and you were always standing right there.
[time=1731] What changed was your perception of reality.
[time=1734] It finally dawned on you what you were really standing next to.
[time=1737] As a result, you're adrenaline fired, and you ran the other way.
[time=1740] That is what he's praying.
[time=1742] He's praying the reality is already given to you.
[time=1744] The reality that Jesus Christ died for you and made you holy and blameless.
[time=1749] The adoption of sons, redemption from the marketplace of sin, the inheritance for all of eternity.
[time=1755] I mean all that's reality. None of that's going to change.
[time=1758] He doesn't say give me more of those blessings.
[time=1761] All he says is God somehow make what you've done for me as real as it is.
[time=1768] Make it as real to me as it is in reality.
[time=1772] I mean just bowl me over with the reality of what you have done.
[time=1776] Don't let me stand here. Don't let me walk through my life.
[time=1780] Don't let me make the big decisions of life without being properly impacted by the spiritual reality that surrounds my salvation in Christ.
[time=1789] What's the last time you prayed like that?
[time=1792] I mean that was the question I was asking myself.
[time=1794] That's what I asked my friends.
[time=1795] When was the last time you could sense in your heart, and this I think is pretty common, that spiritual things were waning.
[time=1803] They weren't captivating as they ought to be.
[time=1805] And other things, maybe good things, maybe okay things, but other things were taking hold of your heart.
[time=1810] What was the last time you made that recognition, got down on your knees and said this isn't good.
[time=1816] Father this isn't right.
[time=1818] Father you've got to help me here.
[time=1821] You have got Father please give me a spirit, an attitude, a disposition, a demeanor of wisdom and revelation of all that is mine in Christ.
[time=1833] I mean let those things take priority and precedence in my value system, in my view of reality, in my decision making, in my priorities.
[time=1844] Open the eyes of my heart.
[time=1846] The heart is known as the seed of all the big stuff in life.
[time=1849] I mean your emotions are seated there, your will is seated there, your rational capacities to think and choose are seated in the heart.
[time=1856] I mean it's the control center of life for from the heart flow the issues of life.
[time=1861] So guard your heart, right?
[time=1863] He's saying at that very control center God, open my eyes, allow light, the light of what you've done, the reality of spiritual things to so flood the control room that our decisions are made in light of that light.
[time=1877] That's what he's praying.
[time=1879] That's what he's begging God for.
[time=1881] And I believe that's what you and I got a big God for.
[time=1884] I believe not only is it right for Paul to pray this for the Ephesians, I believe it's a template.
[time=1889] I believe it's an example of prayer.
[time=1891] And I believe that you and I need to cultivate extended periods of time where we get on our knees and say, oh God, it's getting dark in here.
[time=1899] It's getting dark.
[time=1901] Things that used to be clear are not as clear.
[time=1904] Things I used to value, I'm not valuing like I used to.
[time=1907] Things that used to matter to me, don't matter to me like they used to matter to me.
[time=1912] And rather than reading a book or going to a seminar or getting another sermon or whatever that is, and those are good and those are probably part of the solution.
[time=1920] But here's one that I think we overlook all too often.
[time=1923] Get down on your knees and beg God to give you something.
[time=1928] That he hasn't given you.
[time=1930] I mean, something that he can give you more of.
[time=1933] A disposition, an attitude that values what is truly valuable.
[time=1941] Now, as his prayer develops, he prays specifically for three things.
[time=1946] And I want to try to explain this to you this morning so that when you pray, you can pray the way he prayed.
[time=1951] Not in general, give me an attitude that would value valuable things.
[time=1954] What specifically does he then ask God to make valuable to them?
[time=1959] Three things, three very simple things.
[time=1961] The first one is also found in verse 18.
[time=1964] At the beginning of the verse he says, I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened.
[time=1968] And here comes the request, so that you may know what is the hope of his calling.
[time=1975] That's number one.
[time=1976] What is the hope of his calling?
[time=1978] And I struggle with that this week because it sounds so ethereal.
[time=1982] It sounds so doctrinal.
[time=1984] It sounds out of reach to me.
[time=1986] Begin to study and study and think and pray and ask.
[time=1989] And this is my best shot, okay?
[time=1992] The hope of his calling is this.
[time=1994] God has made promises to you as to what he's going to build you into being.
[time=2000] When you and I get saved, we enter the process of sanctification.
[time=2004] The process where God makes us transforms us.
[time=2009] And it's his process.
[time=2010] And the hope of that process is what we ultimately become at the end.
[time=2017] All right.
[time=2018] So have you ever looked at somebody else and said, man, I wish I had that gift?
[time=2027] I mean, I have people in my life who have an incredible level of competency at certain things in their profession.
[time=2033] And I look at that level of competency and I say, man, I would give anything to be that competent at whatever I'm doing.
[time=2042] You know, years ago when Sandy Patty hit the scene, thousands of you women were saying, I would give anything, right, to have that voice, to sing like that woman sings.
[time=2053] I mean, to be able to walk into a room and just ignite everybody there with that powerful
[time=2059] God-given voice.
[time=2062] A lot of us guys, we're going to go home today and return the TV on.
[time=2065] We're going to see Troy Aikman out there.
[time=2067] We're going to say to ourselves, God, what happened to me?
[time=2070] What had it been so hard?
[time=2072] You know, six, three, strong, athletic, quick, read defenses in no time at all.
[time=2076] And then you had a rock out of an arm to deliver the ball right in the right place and win all the games in the last minute deal and make all that money and be all that famous.
[time=2084] You ever wanted to be somebody else?
[time=2086] You ever wanted somebody else's talent?
[time=2088] Have you ever thought about having somebody else's skills, somebody else's resources, somebody else's appearance, and maybe even somebody else's life?
[time=2098] I mean, you don't want just a slice of this person.
[time=2100] You want their life.
[time=2102] You're trapped in a desperately, lonely marriage and it just never seems to work for you.
[time=2109] And you see this other couple and you know this other couple and you say, "Good night, what I wouldn't give." And you say to yourself, "I'd go through any process." I mean, if you say, "Start here," and I don't care if it takes me 20 years, if I come out the end of that and I get to be Troy Aikman or I get to be Sandy Patty or I get to be whoever I get to be, if you guarantee me that at the end of that process, I'll be that person and I'll go through the process and I'll pay a price.
[time=2135] I mean, I'll go through whatever the junk is you got to go through to get there.
[time=2141] Well, let me tell you what it is.
[time=2145] The hope of God's calling on your life is not to make you into a famous athlete.
[time=2149] It's not to make you into a famous singer.
[time=2152] It's not to make you into a famous marriage relationship that works as it ought to be.
[time=2157] Nothing less than this. Listen to this.
[time=2161] The hope of the calling of God on your life is that He is going to make you exactly like Christ.
[time=2170] Think about that.
[time=2172] Who in this world who has ever lived in all of time would you rather be than
[time=2179] or have be conformed to than the person of Christ?
[time=2184] We're not stumbling around here with mere mortals.
[time=2187] We don't get to become like some mere human being.
[time=2190] We get to become like the living true God incarnate Jesus Christ.
[time=2195] That's the hope of our calling. That's where we're headed.
[time=2199] That's where the train called Christianity stops.
[time=2203] When we see Christ, 1 John 3, 2, it says this.
[time=2206] We know that when He appears, we shall be like Him.
[time=2212] Romans 8 says that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.
[time=2218] Why? For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to be what?
[time=2221] To be conformed to the image of His Son.
[time=2225] Every single one of us in this room, the hope of our calling, the destination which awaits us is conformity to Christ.
[time=2234] We will have His joy.
[time=2236] His joy is perfect, my friends.
[time=2238] Christ's joy is perfect.
[time=2240] We will have His attitude, His nature, His heart, His peace, His perfection, His perspectives,
[time=2246] His priorities, His desires.
[time=2249] I mean, we're just going to be in every conceivable way conformed to the image of the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=2255] That is the hope of our calling.
[time=2258] That ought to rock us to the core of who we are.
[time=2260] That ought to change every decision.
[time=2262] That ought to impact everything we do every moment of every day.
[time=2267] I have been so blessed by God that when this is all said and done, I will be like Christ.
[time=2276] Paul is saying, "Oh God, give them an appreciation for that reality." It's true anyway.
[time=2282] God's going to do it whether you pray for it or not.
[time=2285] You don't pray for Him to do it.
[time=2287] You pray for Him to help you appreciate what He's doing.
[time=2293] Make it matter to me.
[time=2297] When was the last time you got on your knees and you said, "God, make it matter to me that when this is all said and done, I will be perfect like Christ."
[time=2307] God, help me appreciate what it means to be on my way to having the mind and the heart and the spirit and the thoughts and the character of Christ.
[time=2314] That's what He's saying.
[time=2319] The second thing He prays for.
[time=2321] The second specific thing in this spirit of wisdom and revelation is also found in verse 18.
[time=2327] I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened so that you may know, first of all, we already looked at this, what is the hope of His calling?
[time=2334] Secondly, and what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints?
[time=2340] A lot of superlatives there.
[time=2342] He wants us to have a deeper understanding, comprehension, clear thought and greater impact
[time=2349] by the reality that we have been given the inheritance, that we have been given heaven.
[time=2357] Now think this through with me.
[time=2359] This is intriguing.
[time=2361] Do you know what it would be like if all God committed to do to us was to make us like Christ, which is phenomenal, but if that was it.
[time=2370] And for us, it was becoming like Christ, but having to live forever on earth.
[time=2376] Think about that.
[time=2379] I don't want to do that.
[time=2380] The last thing I want to do is to be like Christ and yet have to live on a sinful earth with
[time=2387] sinful people the rest of my life or for all of eternity.
[time=2391] Because this sinful earth is going to do the exact same thing to me that they did to Christ.
[time=2397] Sinful humanity does not tolerate perfection and holiness and righteousness.
[time=2402] It's oil and water, those don't mix, those can't cohabitate.
[time=2407] We would find ourselves in a situation where the people around us were increasingly jealous,
[time=2413] unjustly over our holiness and our righteousness and our pureness of heart.
[time=2417] They would hate us like they hated Christ, they would reject us like they rejected Christ, and they would eventually kill us like they killed Christ.
[time=2427] What goes full circle on this thing, what goes full circle on our salvation is not only do we not
[time=2433] have to be ourselves anymore, we get to be like Christ, but we get to go to a place called glory called heaven where everything is perfect and everything is as it ought to be.
[time=2443] And there, to be Christ like, that's when we get to experience the fullness of what that's about.
[time=2453] It's perfect, unhindered fellowship with the true and living God.
[time=2457] Once you become like Christ and all of his attitudes, thoughts, motives and desires, then to be in the immediate proximity of God.
[time=2464] Jesus was lonely for God on earth. Jesus wept for God on earth.
[time=2468] Jesus cried about the separation from God on earth.
[time=2471] I mean, it was hard to be Jesus on earth.
[time=2473] It's when Jesus is in heaven that it all comes together.
[time=2481] Jesus knew what it meant to groan and labor and toil and steward and sacrifice and give.
[time=2487] I mean, to be Jesus forever on earth, no thank you.
[time=2491] To be Jesus forever in heaven, sign me up.
[time=2496] Because then I will be in the ultimate place to experience the wonder of God for all of eternity.
[time=2505] In heaven, as you know, there will be no animosity, no misunderstandings, no time pressures, no stress, no requirements to meet, no need you can't fill, no heart you can't perfectly relate to or connect to.
[time=2518] Every single person you ever converse with in heaven, there will be a complete and tonal meeting of heart, mind, soul and spirit.
[time=2524] It will be rapturous. It will be satisfying. It will be righteous. It will be holy.
[time=2531] That's what he says.
[time=2533] Oh God, somehow let me feel, somehow let me sense, impact me afresh and anew what it means
[time=2541] that you're not only going to make me like Christ, but you're going to take me for all of eternity into your presence
[time=2547] with everybody else there who is just like Christ.
[time=2552] Amazing truth.
[time=2555] It's an amazing truth.
[time=2558] And it is true whether we pray for it or not.
[time=2561] It's going to happen. It's one of the blessings that God has already given to us.
[time=2566] The prayer here isn't, "Oh God, take me there." The prayer is, "Oh God, please let it matter to me that you are taking me there."
[time=2576] Do you understand?
[time=2579] The third thing he prays for is in verse 19.
[time=2583] Verse 19 says, "And what is the surpassing greatness of his power towards us who believe?"
[time=2590] This is a prayer that says, "Oh God, help me understand how strong you are." "Oh God, help me trust your power." I mean, what you're promising here is to make me like Christ and to take me to heaven.
[time=2602] Help me believe that you actually have the power to pull it all off and to keep me faithful and standing strong
[time=2609] between now and the time that you do.
[time=2612] You say to yourself, "Well, I never question the power of God. I don't think that's true." You might not be aware that you question the power of God, but I believe we all question the power of God for a number of reasons. Number one, Paul is praying that we won't.
[time=2625] That tells me we probably do.
[time=2627] And I don't think we ever sit around and say, "You know, I don't think God's omnipotent." I don't think God's omnipotent. I don't think God really is all powerful.
[time=2635] I don't think that's true. I don't believe the scriptures.
[time=2637] I'm not talking about that kind of questioning the power of God.
[time=2640] I'm talking about the practical questioning of God on a daily basis. Is he enough? Is he strong enough
[time=2646] to lead you to an obedient life that culminates in Christ's likeness and all of eternity?
[time=2651] And I think there's a practical sense in which we undermine and underestimate and undervalue the power of God.
[time=2658] I think it shows up every time we sin.
[time=2662] Every time we choose not to trust him for the strength to stay obedient.
[time=2668] He's got enough to get the job done.
[time=2673] You're looking for a transformation. You go into your hairstylist.
[time=2678] You show her a picture of that gal in the magazine that you'd like your hair to look like.
[time=2682] You say, "Make my hair look just like her hair." The question in your mind is, "I wonder if this stylist is any good?" I wonder if as she begins to cut and trim and shape and mold and mousse and comb and dry and all that stuff.
[time=2697] And she does all that stuff. Does she what? Does she have the power? Does she have the creative power to make my hair look like that person's in the magazine?
[time=2708] Most of the time the answer is sadly no.
[time=2712] I just look like a slightly reformed me. Not a transformed me, but you get the issue there in a very common way.
[time=2718] The issue is does the hairstylist have the power to transform? The answer basically is no.
[time=2723] We can modify. We can shape. But I don't have the power to reconfigure your skull, to reconfigure your hair,
[time=2729] and to make it look like that woman's does in the...
[time=2734] Paul says, "Would you just ask God to convince you again that he is powerful enough to do what he's promised to do?"
[time=2743] Well, then he gives us an illustration. Look at verse 19. He says this.
[time=2747] What is the surpassing greatness of his power towards we who believe? Now watch. These are in accordance with the working of the strength of his might.
[time=2755] Verse 20, which he brought about in Christ when he raised him from the dead. Stop right there.
[time=2762] In order for you and I to look like Christ, what happens is this. We die. We physically die unless the rapture comes first.
[time=2770] But we die. We go into a grave. Something has to happen to us before we get to be like Christ in every dimension.
[time=2777] We have to be raised from the dead. The grave has to give our body up, and God has to fashion for us a new body that is fit for all of eternity,
[time=2787] one that never gets sick, one that has never ailed, one that never dies.
[time=2791] And what God is saying is, I did already to Jesus. I showed my power when I raised him from the dead.
[time=2799] That same power will raise you out of the grave and make you look like Christ.
[time=2804] The verse goes on, verse 20. He raised him from the dead, and then he seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places,
[time=2811] far above all rule and authority and power and dominion and every name that is named not only in this age, but also in the one to come.
[time=2817] 22. He put all things in subjection under his feet and gave him his head over all things to the church.
[time=2823] Transformation requires resurrection. God has got to be strong enough to get me out of the grave or I will never get to look like Christ.
[time=2830] Secondly, if I am ever going to get the glory, God has got to be able to lift me there.
[time=2835] He has got to take me to the place called heaven. Is he strong enough? God says I was strong enough to take Jesus there.
[time=2841] You want to know where Jesus is today? He is sitting. Look at verse 20. He is sitting at the right hand where in the heavenly places.
[time=2850] I had the power to take him there. I like this, verse 21. I took him there. The words rule and authority, power and dominion.
[time=2859] Those are words that describe demonic strongholds. That's the verbiage that describes demon power.
[time=2866] In the different echelons of demon power. I take it this way. I not only had the power to raise him from the dead.
[time=2873] I not only had the power to take him into the place called heaven, but I did it against the will of all the demon forces represented in rule, authority, power and dominion.
[time=2882] I put him above every name that is to be named. Both now and forever. You are looking for power. You came to the right place.
[time=2889] You're looking for the God that can transform you and then transport you to the glories of heaven. You came to the right God because I did it already in my son.
[time=2901] That's what he's saying.
[time=2904] But somehow or another, that truth, this is the prayer. God make that truth mean more to me today than it did yesterday.
[time=2916] As I live my life, God, don't let the familiarity of that truth become less meaningful to me.
[time=2923] Somehow through this prayer, God, answer my prayer and make that truth become more meaningful to me.
[time=2932] I think that's the key, my friends. And I just wonder, I just wonder if I could ask you this question.
[time=2939] Does the truth that God is going to make you like Christ mean more to you today or less to you today than the day you learned it?
[time=2947] Does it captivate you? Is it something that you cherish in a way more today than you did the days you learned it, the former days?
[time=2957] Does the reality of what God is going to do for you in heaven, does that mean more to you today?
[time=2962] Are you clinging more tightly to that truth today than when you first really understood it five, ten years ago?
[time=2969] Some of you, fifteen, twenty years ago?
[time=2973] Does the fact that God had the power to raise Jesus from the dead and seat him above all the demons and all the names, does that kind of power shake you now more than it did when you learned about it?
[time=2987] That's what he's praying. That's what he's praying. That's what he's saying. God somehow, please.
[time=2992] Make it mean more to me today than it did when I learned it. Make it mean more to me tomorrow than it does today.
[time=2997] I mean, allow my life to be an ever-ascending appreciation for the spiritual reality that already exists around me.
[time=3004] Well, I was thinking about this whole thing.
[time=3009] And oddly enough, Michael Jackson's name came to mind. Now, you tell me how Michael Jackson fits into this. I don't know.
[time=3014] But I think he does.
[time=3017] We're talking about transformation and we're talking about transportation to a different place.
[time=3022] And we're talking about the power to do it.
[time=3025] I think it's pretty common knowledge that Michael Jackson does not like himself the way he is.
[time=3030] He wishes that he could be transformed into something that he's not, at least his physical appearance.
[time=3036] He doesn't like the way he looks. He wants to look like somebody else.
[time=3041] And so because he's famous and because he's talented, he's richer than rich could be rich.
[time=3048] Money is no object. So he takes his money and he finds the best plastic surgeons in the world and he says, "I'll pay you anything you ask. Just transform me.
[time=3058] I don't want to look like I look anymore. I don't like my image. I want another image."
[time=3064] And they do all of their work. And I guess it's really up for grabs as to whether or not it was a good thing or a bad thing.
[time=3069] You know, beauties in the eye, they'd be older there.
[time=3072] I mean, you wonder, Michael, do you really like the way you look today more than you did when you started?
[time=3076] If you could reverse it, would you? I don't know the answer to that question. That's not important.
[time=3081] Here's the point. Do you realize with all their transformation power and maybe he's thrilled with the way he looks physically?
[time=3088] I don't know. But guess what? They left untouched. All the really important stuff.
[time=3094] They didn't touch his joy. I mean, they can't revamp his joy. They can't revamp his attitude.
[time=3100] They can't change the disposition of his heart. They can't give him perfect peace. They can't give him perfect desires.
[time=3106] They simply can't make him into Christ in any way, shape, or form.
[time=3111] He will never know the joy or the power or the serenity or the sweetness or the love or the sacrifice or the power of Christ.
[time=3119] He'll just never know any of that at the hand of a surgeon.
[time=3122] What I'm saying is that one of the richest people in the world, with all the things at his disposal, went in and said, "Transform me," and all you get is a changed physical appearance. That's all you get.
[time=3134] It ought to mean something to us. That at no cost to us, God said, "I sent my son to die for you, and now I will transform you into his very image."
[time=3145] That ought to force friends, that ought to make us appreciate. Michael wanted a different place to live.
[time=3152] Michael wanted to create heaven on earth through the best of his ability.
[time=3156] So he went to an inland valley in Southern California, a place I happen to have grown up, and I've been to Russia, and I've been to China, and I've been here in Europe, and there, and this, and I'll tell you my opinion, maybe because I was born there, but my opinion, you can't buy better real estate.
[time=3169] Guy paid $30 million for this piece of property, and then he took some more of his money, and he built a mansion,
[time=3175] and then he took some more of his money, and he put some exotic animals, and then he took some more of his money, and he put some amusement park rides, and then he took some more of his money, and he built a home theater, and he took anything he could possibly think to buy. He wanted to buy heaven. He wanted to get it right here.
[time=3190] He spent all he had, or all that he felt was propitious and necessary to create heaven on earth, and guess what he's got.
[time=3197] He's got a piece of real estate on a cursed and fallen earth.
[time=3200] His house got rocked in the earthquake just like everybody else's did a few years ago.
[time=3205] His house, and his crops, and his animals are subject to the same droughts that affects all the rest of Southern California, and the same fires that affect the rest of Southern California. He didn't build heaven.
[time=3214] He did a brief modification on a fallen earth as beautiful and as wonderful as it is.
[time=3221] And beyond the physical stuff, like earthquakes and fires and stuff, you know his animals die all the time.
[time=3226] He's got to replace the animals. And if he gets attached to the animals, that causes pain.
[time=3231] The paint on his little wonder aroma land, that continues to wear off and oxidize. That's got to be redone.
[time=3236] And it breaks. It's got to be fixed. In other words, it's always, always, always in a process of decay.
[time=3241] And worse than that, the people he wants to be with there are still just like him, non-transformed sinners like us.
[time=3250] And so little fantasy land there in the same as Valley has all the animosity and all the misunderstandings
[time=3256] and all the stress and all the pain and all the sorrow and all the selfishness and all the sin of your house and my house.
[time=3264] All the money in the world can't change it.
[time=3270] The things that people really want. Here's what I'm trying to say.
[time=3273] Do you know the things that you really want deep in your being? You want to be different than you are.
[time=3277] And the ultimate expression of that difference would be to have the joy and the wonder of the person of Christ.
[time=3283] And you want to be somewhere you're not. And it's not Hawaii. And it's not the Bahamas.
[time=3287] And it's not the Florida Keys. No place on earth can even get close to doing what heaven is going to do.
[time=3294] And he says, here, it's yours. I give it to you. And I've got the power to get you there.
[time=3299] I've got the power to get you there.
[time=3304] So Paul says in verse 17, pray.
[time=3308] When that reality doesn't impact you as it ought to, as you sit here this morning and you listen to my words and it does not impact you as much as you know it should, Paul says pray.
[time=3319] And say, oh God, please give me a spirit of wisdom and revelation and the knowledge of your son.
[time=3324] Open the eyes of my heart, enlighten me again so that becoming like Christ and going to heaven
[time=3330] and being connected to a God who has the power to do it shakes me to the core of my being.
[time=3335] Alters all of my decisions, affects all of my relationships, all of my priorities and is the preoccupation of my life.
[time=3345] William Randolph Hearst, you remember William Randolph Hearst an extremely exorbitantly wealthy man.
[time=3352] Had a big huge art collection.
[time=3355] One time he read of an extremely valuable piece of art. He's reading through this art deal.
[time=3361] And he sees this piece. He says, I got to have that. I just got to have that.
[time=3365] So he commissions his agent to go find it and buy it no matter how much it costs.
[time=3372] And the agent goes out for months and does this painstaking exhaustive search for the single solitary piece of art.
[time=3381] And when he's done with his search, he comes back to William Randolph Hearst and says, guess what?
[time=3387] And Mr. Hearst is reported to have said, yeah what? And the agent said, you already own it.
[time=3396] It's been in your warehouse for several years. You bought it like 10 years ago.
[time=3405] I don't know what else you're looking for.
[time=3412] But I think what Paul is trying to say, you already have it.
[time=3419] He's already given you every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places.
[time=3424] It's going to culminate in a new you who's going to be just like Christ.
[time=3428] It's going to culminate in a new place, have it itself, and it's all secured by the power of God.
[time=3433] You already have it. Now if we could just be properly impacted by that great truth, let's pray together.
[time=3447] Father, we are mere mortals and we do not see eternal things and we do not see spiritual things.
[time=3452] We see physical temporal things and they have a way of getting a hold.
[time=3457] They have a way of sinking deep. They're tentacles into our heart and we begin to think that it's about the here and now.
[time=3465] The things that we can see and touch and taste.
[time=3468] Help us, O God, enlighten our eyes, open the eyes of our heart.
[time=3475] I mean flood our soul with spiritual light and truth again afresh in anew so that the true spiritual reality that is already ours
[time=3486] so that that stuff is the preoccupation of our life.
[time=3491] We need your help. We ask you to work that in us. In Jesus' name, amen.
