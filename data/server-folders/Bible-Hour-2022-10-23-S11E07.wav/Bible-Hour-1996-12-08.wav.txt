[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=30] - Yeah, Webster, what comes to your mind when you hear the word of rescue?
[time=51] And he'd say this, "To set free from confinement or danger by prompt and vigorous action."
[time=59] What about you, what comes to your mind?
[time=63] Have you ever been rescued?
[time=65] Have you ever been stranded in a blizzard?
[time=67] Somebody came along and rescued you?
[time=69] Have you ever been lost hitchhiking in a forest and somebody came along and rescued you?
[time=74] Ever been drowning and somebody rescued you?
[time=80] I would imagine in a crowd this size, if we could fair it out, kind of the best of the rescue stories, we'd have some pretty exciting, hair-raising tales of real-life rescue going
[time=90] on in the lives of even you who are here today.
[time=93] Let me invite you to take your Bible this morning, come to Ephesians chapter 2.
[time=97] I want to talk to you about what it means to be spiritually rescued, this whole concept of rescue as it is applied to the spiritual dimension.
[time=106] We've been studying the book of Ephesians, and as to date we have come to chapter 2, and the passage of Scripture that we're going to study this morning is found in verses 1 through 10, verses 1 through 10.
[time=119] And the theme of this entire passage, I mean before we look at the individual verses, let me say this, that the theme of this whole passage is found at the end of verse 5.
[time=129] Ephesians chapter 2, the end of verse 5 says this, "For by grace you have been saved."
[time=136] The word saved in the Greek is a word called sozo, sozo, and it means to rescue.
[time=143] This is a passage about being rescued by the grace of God, not from financial difficulty
[time=149] or drowning or being stranded or being lost in the physical sense.
[time=154] This is a passage that explains what it means to be rescued by God in the spiritual dimension.
[time=166] This is the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=173] Thank you for joining us.
[time=174] Webster's dictionary defines rescue as "to set free from confinement or danger by propped
[time=180] and vigorous action." Have you ever been rescued from some predicament in your life?
[time=184] Continuing our study in Ephesians, Pastor Moore looks at what it means to be spiritually rescued.
[time=190] Now let's join our service.
[time=193] A candy cane can be a great reminder of Jesus.
[time=196] It's shaped like a shepherd's staff and reminds us that Jesus said, "I am the good shepherd that lays down his life for his sheep." It is also a strike to write in light, no matter how deep the stain of sin, Jesus can take it out.
[time=209] Even if you are as red as crimson, Jesus can make you as white as snow.
[time=212] It tastes good too.
[time=214] The Bible says, "Taste and see that the Lord is good." And when you turn it upside down, it's the letter "J" and that reminds us of Jesus.
[time=236] I can't help thinking of the one who gave his life for me.
[time=250] Everything about a candy cane from his color to its shape reminds me of my Savior's love
[time=260] that's why I celebrate.
[time=266] Every time I see a candy cane hanging on a tree I can't help thinking of the one who
[time=276] gave his life for me.
[time=279] Everything about a candy cane from his color to its shape reminds me of my Savior's love
[time=289] that's why I celebrate.
[time=298] A candy cane of red and white could just be my favorite sight.
[time=306] The stripes you might need, Jesus made the prize.
[time=312] Every time I see a candy cane hanging on a tree I can't help thinking of the one who
[time=339] gave his life for me, everything about a candy cane from his color to its shape.
[time=348] It reminds me of my Savior's love that's why I celebrate.
[time=356] A candy cane can taste so sweet, it's my favorite Christmas tree.
[time=367] And I can taste the kindness of our Lord, He has offered to forgive me and to wash me
[time=379] so sweet, it's my favorite Christmas tree.
[time=390] Every time I see a candy cane hanging on a tree I can't help thinking of the one who
[time=399] gave his life for me.
[time=403] Everything about a candy cane from his color to his shape reminds me of my Savior's love
[time=415] that's why I celebrate.
[time=423] Every time I see a candy cane hanging on a tree, it's not long enough to ask yourself
[time=434] if the tree is all you see.
[time=437] Everything about a candy cane from his color to his shape reminds me of my Savior's love
[time=447] that's why I celebrate and that's why I celebrate.
[time=464] I celebrate.
[time=479] Every time I see a candy cane hanging on a tree, it's my favorite Christmas tree, it's
[time=504] my favorite Christmas tree, it's my favorite Christmas tree, it's my favorite Christmas
[time=857] for us to do on our own, but God was able to do, a mission of rescue. And it started, part of it was a major story, but it went way beyond that. It was Jesus who came and was born and lived and then died to be our Savior. And when we really have times of honesty in our lives, we know that we are lacking, we know that we are broken, and we need to be fixed, and we need to be fixed.
[time=886] And we need to be freed, and we need to be made right with God. And that's what God did in rescuing us. Listen to the words of this song as Chris sings it in the work of our Savior in rescuing us.
[time=916] Dangling over the edge with the history of faith. Barely remains, once I was blind, but could it be that the excess of light is shading the weary past,
[time=943] with the shadow we cast. And as sin gives way to a toning blood and a dead is paid with the riches of love, there's a hope that I see, there's a freedom in me, there's a comfort in death and in life.
[time=969] Knowing that I belong to the Savior who's making me whole, body and soul.
[time=988] Now I can feel the sense of resolve choosing a new point of view, going against the grave, breaking the chain.
[time=1007] And the shackles fall on the road to peace, and I lose them all as I find my release, because there's a hope that I see, there's a freedom in me, there's a comfort in death and in life.
[time=1026] Knowing that I belong to the Savior who's making me whole, body and soul.
[time=1041] Knowing that hope eternal springs in me, and that freedom seems to willingly carry me through a world of fears I've stored inside of me, Lord a bite in me.
[time=1071] And as sin gives way to a toning blood and a dead is paid with the riches of love, there's a hope that I see, there's a freedom in me, there's a comfort in death and in life.
[time=1094] Knowing that I belong to the Savior who's making me whole, body and soul.
[time=1112] Body and soul.
[time=1129] What comes to your mind when I say the word rescue?
[time=1134] I say the word rescue. What comes to your mind? Several things come to my mind.
[time=1139] The first of which in chronological order in my life was when I was about 16 years of age, I was standing on the top of this hill, about 100 feet high and down below that was a reservoir.
[time=1150] And my buddy Danny had a big black strong male Labrador, 110 pounds or some ridiculous thing. And I had my gorgeous beautiful dog, she was a golden retriever and she wasn't quite as big.
[time=1162] And I had a stick and he had a stick and we were just flying these things out into the reservoir and they'd hustle down there and fetch it and retrieve it.
[time=1169] We went back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and back and forth.
[time=1172] They finally were getting a little tired and one of us threw the stick a little too far and they were both kind of on line with each other.
[time=1179] And it became apparent to the dogs that they were going for the same stick.
[time=1183] And they got out there a pretty good distance and the big male started to feel a little competitive about the whole thing and started swimming on top of my dog and she went under.
[time=1194] And then she came back up a few minutes and he did it again.
[time=1198] And then she came back up and then he did it again and the third time I'd seen enough of that.
[time=1202] And I was on my way down the hill, you know, shedding clothes and dropping wallets and letting go of watches and diving with my rescue dive out there into the reservoir.
[time=1210] Swimming and I finally got up to the black lab and I punched him in the head and pushed him under the water and rescued my dog.
[time=1217] And brought her home safely.
[time=1220] The next time I remember being rescued, Heidi and I were swimming off the coast of California and the Pacific Ocean, having a great time.
[time=1227] And all of a sudden we noticed we were getting incredibly tired and we were trying to make our way back into shore and we couldn't make our way back into shore.
[time=1235] We were caught in a rip tide and it was draining all of our energy and it was kind of that Baywatch scene where they come out of that thing and down the ramp and they bring the little life guard orange deal and throw it out there and swim with you and bring you back in.
[time=1247] Another time I remember being rescued, it wasn't in a physical sense, it was a financial rescue.
[time=1253] And we hadn't intended to get this far like close to the edge of not having enough money to pay our bills but we had and my folks without even knowing it sent us a check for $5,000 and rescued us financially.
[time=1267] And it was only kind of after the check came that we saw the rest of the things and then some unexpected expenses came and it dawned on us without that help we were going under.
[time=1276] Ask Webster what comes to his mind when you say the word rescue, he'd say this, to set free from confinement or danger to set free from confinement or danger by prompt or vigorous action.
[time=1290] What about you? Have you ever been rescued? Stranded in a blizzard, somebody came along and rescued you.
[time=1298] Lost hiking somewhere in a forest, rescued, maybe drowning, maybe a financial rescue has been a part of your past.
[time=1308] And I think with a crowd this size, I mean if we could kind of ferret out like the mediocre rescue stories, I'll bet there's some really exciting, hair raising, you know, last second rescue stories that you could come up here and share, I'd love to hear.
[time=1322] This morning I want to talk about being rescued but I want to talk about not a financial rescue or a rescue from drowning or a rescue from a blizzard or a rescue from being lost in the forest.
[time=1332] We'll talk about what it means to be rescued spiritually by God himself and if you have a Bible this morning open it to Ephesians chapter 2.
[time=1340] Ephesians chapter 2 and if you're brand new to this church and you've maybe come for the very first time this morning, you have come on a tremendous Sunday.
[time=1349] Because this is probably one of the clearest passages in all the New Testament that describes what it means to be rescued spiritually by God.
[time=1359] You may have heard in days past somebody say I got saved.
[time=1363] You may have a friend that went away to promise keepers and came back and said I got saved or went away to a camp, came back and said I got saved.
[time=1370] And you thought to yourself what exactly does that mean? You know what did they get saved from and how did they get saved and what did they get saved to?
[time=1380] This text of all the text in the New Testament answers that question in a more clear and comprehensive way than any other that I know about.
[time=1389] And if you've been here a number of years maybe you're one of the pillars of the assembly, you've been here for 20, 25 years.
[time=1395] It's a great opportunity for you to come again and think through what are the dynamics of salvation and these famous verses down in verse 8 that say for by grace you've been saved.
[time=1406] Many of us have memorized these through faith not of yourselves, it's a gift of God not as a result of works that anyone should boast.
[time=1413] I mean right below John 3 16 are those two verses Ephesians 2, 8 and 9.
[time=1418] So it's a great text. If you wonder what's our church about?
[time=1422] Say what is Blackhawk Baptist Church all about? You've come on the right Sunday because this passage will delineate the central reason we exist.
[time=1432] To be used by God in the process that he is involved in rescuing people from spiritual peril.
[time=1439] So it's a great, great text. It's a privilege really for me to be able to share it with you this morning.
[time=1444] In Ephesians chapter 2 verse 5 at the end of the verse there in verse 5 look in your Bible you'll notice there's a phrase and it happens to be the theme of the entire passage.
[time=1453] It says this, "For by grace you have been saved." Now the word saved in the English is sozo in the Greek and it could have been translated in rescue.
[time=1463] The word really is rescue. For by grace you have been rescued.
[time=1470] And every bit of information in these 10 verses explains some aspect of what it means to be rescued by the grace of God.
[time=1480] I'm going to make three points today that come out of this text. The first one is this, the need to be spiritually rescued.
[time=1486] The first few verses establish the human individual need to be spiritually rescued.
[time=1493] Then the text says this, it tells us the means of spiritual rescue or how do I get rescued?
[time=1500] If I'm lost how is it that God rescues people from the spiritual domain?
[time=1505] And then the third point that this text kind of presents to us is the result of spiritual rescue.
[time=1511] What does it mean? I mean what does it mean I get rescued? I get rescued to what?
[time=1515] I'm in spiritual danger you say and I get rescued you're going to tell me how I can get rescued.
[time=1520] I want to know also what do I get rescued to? What does the rest of my life look like?
[time=1524] If I get rescued by God from the spiritual peril I may or may not be in.
[time=1529] Okay? First of all the need, the need. Look at verses one and two.
[time=1535] It says there you were dead in your trespasses and sins.
[time=1540] In which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience.
[time=1551] Verse three. Among them to all we all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh,
[time=1557] indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind that were by nature children of wrath even as the rest.
[time=1563] Look up from your Bible. You say I'm no further along in understanding my need to be rescued than before you read that because I understand what that said. Okay? Let's work on that.
[time=1574] There's some powerful imagery in those three verses.
[time=1578] And I think the way that we get described, the way that a human person is described until they come to Christ,
[time=1585] the best imagery I can think is go with me now to the mall and in the mall go to a particular store and the store that I think does this as good as anything, one of them is footlocker. Now as you walk into a footlocker, you are immediately confronted with a reality that you have gone into another world.
[time=1602] I mean everything you see has been orchestrated to try to help you buy that product.
[time=1608] The personnel don't come to work in whatever they happen to have in their closet.
[time=1611] They look like referees, right? Or umpires. And you look around and there's great sporting scenes
[time=1617] and you come up to the place where you're going to buy whatever it is you're going to buy and you're standing on hardwood, like the hardwood of a basketball court.
[time=1624] I mean, you sit on a bench to get to shoe-tried on and it's not a chair, it's an actual literal bench like you'd sit on if you were playing.
[time=1631] I mean the whole thing is from stem to stern orchestrated to communicate and I'm beyond some milieu that creates a desire in you to buy what they're selling.
[time=1640] Okay, now, you got that?
[time=1644] Verse 1 of chapter 2 says this, "You were dead in your trespasses and sins
[time=1650] and it's a locket of sphere." What it means is just like footlocker has a roof
[time=1656] and it has a ceiling and it has walls and it has an opening in the back that creates space, right?
[time=1661] The Bible says that you and I are born into the sphere that is defined not by walls,
[time=1669] not by bricks and mortar, but by trespasses and sins.
[time=1674] Trespass means to stumble, and sin means to miss the mark.
[time=1679] And you and I are described as being born into the domain or the sphere that is marked out by our own trespasses and our own sins.
[time=1689] Now, just like footlocker, there is somebody that master minds that sphere.
[time=1694] There is somebody that makes that sphere of influence look appealing to you.
[time=1698] That's called a manager.
[time=1700] And the manager's job is to orchestrate the decorations and train the personnel and make sure the right music's on at the right time.
[time=1707] I mean, he oversees the whole operation so that you get provided the same experience every time you go, that they're best shot at getting you to buy.
[time=1716] Verse 2 of Ephesians 2 says this, "In which you formerly walked according to the course of this world,"
[time=1722] now watch, "according to the prince of the power of the air." The prince of the power of the air is a title that is given to Satan.
[time=1731] And Satan in this scenario, in this analogy, is the manager of this entire world system.
[time=1737] And it is his job, it is his delight, it is his preoccupation, it is his passion
[time=1743] to move into any given culture and to set up shop, to make culturally relevant connections with individuals in the arena of trespasses and sins,
[time=1756] to make things that are appealing and enticing that draw people away from God and enslave them to the involvement in those kinds of activities.
[time=1765] And he does that by verse 2, creating a spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience.
[time=1771] And the word spirit, that word doesn't mean demon spirit, it means attitude, it means like the spirit of the ages.
[time=1777] You walk into a footlocker and there's an attitude in that room, there's an attitude in there, there's a feeling that you get.
[time=1785] It's exactly what Satan does.
[time=1787] He creates a cultural feeling that makes sin acceptable and appealing and relevant.
[time=1797] And he does it differently all over the world.
[time=1800] I mean if you'll branch out with me and you're thinking, let's go down the thing.
[time=1804] You've got footlocker here, you go down in the mall and there's other stores and the other stores have a completely different feeling and a completely different flavor and they're selling a completely different kind of product.
[time=1814] That's true, Satan is not just the prince of the power of Fort Wayne, he is the prince of the power of the air, the entire world system.
[time=1820] And so if you go as I have, if you were to go with me to Japan, you would say now how is Satan selling here?
[time=1827] And he sells completely differently than he does in America.
[time=1831] In Japan, Satan sells, I don't know if you know this, there's not even a word for personal sin in the dictionary of the Japanese language.
[time=1839] There is no one word that can communicate the concept of a divine being who has absolutes that the individual breaks.
[time=1849] Now that, my friends, is very creative in terms of locking a people into a religious or worldview system that prohibits them from coming to a knowledge of Christ, because they don't even have a word that can get you to step one in coming to Christ which is to recognize that you violated the law of a holy God.
[time=1869] That's interwoven all through their culture.
[time=1872] The only sin they have basically there is the sin of social disgrace, to lose face on a human to human basis and the whole ancestor thing is very, very strong.
[time=1880] And when you sin there, you don't sin against the God, you sin against your ancestors.
[time=1886] It's a closed system. It's very difficult to find Christ in that system.
[time=1891] Go down the road a little bit from Japan and go to China and find out that the closed system there isn't, it's not a language barrier, they're just totally committed to atheism.
[time=1899] They teach their people from the get-go through their curriculum and their schooling and their prohibition against churches and all that kind of stuff.
[time=1907] They use a lot of religious, I mean governmental horsepower to shut down people even understanding that there is a God.
[time=1915] You go to culture, to culture, to culture, you walk through the mall of the world and you see that Satan is a very capable manager and he sets up different stores with different feelings and they all sell the same product, separation from God.
[time=1931] They all sell trespasses and sins.
[time=1934] They all sell and work with a sphere that lacks people in separation from God.
[time=1943] Well you say, are we willing customers?
[time=1946] I mean, do we like to purchase in these stores?
[time=1950] Well, verse 3 says, "We lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind."
[time=1958] Those are the two strongest words of the New Testament, lust and desires to communicate motivation and motivation.
[time=1965] Lust is kind of a runaway desire, epithemia.
[time=1968] It's a powerful, all-consuming.
[time=1970] It takes people to the point of irrational decisions.
[time=1973] Doing things they wouldn't do if they weren't kind of like given over to that lust at that particular moment and it's not just sexual, it can be for anything.
[time=1980] And the word desire communicates that willfulness that comes in the heart.
[time=1984] Once the lust is aroused, it's like I'm going to get this thing and I'm going to get it now and I don't care what price I have to pay to get it.
[time=1993] The human condition, apart from Christ, is described as very willing to consume products
[time=2002] in the marketplace of this world system which is orchestrated by Satan.
[time=2008] We've got some products here from Footlocker.
[time=2013] And because we're only borrowing them, the price tags are still on.
[time=2017] So you come over here to this nice sweatsuit and you find out this thing costs a lot of money.
[time=2022] I mean, I don't know, 80, 90 bucks.
[time=2027] You know, you want to go in the Footlocker, you want to try it on, you want to buy it?
[time=2031] You got to pay the price, right?
[time=2036] Verse 3 says this, there's a price to be paid.
[time=2040] After talking about living in our lusts and the desires of our flesh and our mind, it says this.
[time=2045] And we are by nature children of wrath, even as the rest.
[time=2052] The price tag at Footlocker, 80, 90 bucks.
[time=2056] The price tag in the store of life to live in violation to the holiness of God, to get swept up in the milieu of what Satan offers in trespasses and sins.
[time=2067] You come to the end of your life and you pay, not with money, you pay by suffering the wrath of God for all of eternity.
[time=2077] Man, I mean, when the Apostle Paul sat down to write this thing, you'd think he was thinking of a 20th century wall.
[time=2084] I mean, the imagery is so connected.
[time=2087] He's saying you don't go into the marketplace of sin and deal with the manager there whose name is Satan and not pay the price when it's done.
[time=2098] So first of all, the need. And you know what? I just want to say two things.
[time=2103] Some of you have trouble, maybe, really sensing that you're lost.
[time=2111] And it's very difficult to ask somebody to save you until you have a clear impression that you're lost, right?
[time=2119] I mean, for example, Heidi and I out there in the ocean, we were in trouble a lot sooner than we knew.
[time=2127] Our energies and our strength and our distance from the shore began to be the byproduct of that riptide
[time=2134] long before we ever recognized it.
[time=2137] We'd been lost a long time before we started really being aware that we needed to be saved.
[time=2143] Same thing financially. We didn't have a little nest egg there of money and say, well, let's just get right out there on the edge of bankruptcy.
[time=2149] What do you say? Let's spend it all today.
[time=2151] We just spent here, spent a little bit here, and then there was unexpected expense.
[time=2154] There's another unexpected expense. And we were on the path.
[time=2157] We were in trouble long before it finally dawned on us.
[time=2161] And then the gift came from my folks, and there were some other expenses that finally showed us how much trouble we were really in and didn't know it.
[time=2169] Some of you here today, you're not connecting with this stuff.
[time=2173] You're saying, I don't get it. I don't feel lost. I don't feel like I'm buying in the store of Satan.
[time=2177] I mean, I do a few bad things, but if you're trying to say that I'm lost and I'm in spiritual peril,
[time=2183] I'll be honest with you today, Russell. I don't feel that way. Okay, no problem.
[time=2186] Let me ask you to do something. Do what I did. Do what I did.
[time=2191] When I was 20 years old, I was hearing a message about being lost, you know, and it didn't connect with me either. I'm thinking, well, that must be somebody else.
[time=2201] But I went home that night and I said, God, if it's me, I mean, if I'm lost, would you do me the favor of making that really clear to me?
[time=2210] I mean, if I'm kind of getting swept in the power of a riptide and I'm early in the process and I'm not aware of it, please, would you let me know?
[time=2218] You see, sometimes you just got to deal with God wherever you are today.
[time=2224] And some of you today don't feel lost, but you might really be completely lost and in great spiritual peril.
[time=2229] All I can encourage you to do is say, hey, God, if that's me, make that clear to me.
[time=2235] Please make that clear to me. And you watch. God has a way of answering that kind of prayer.
[time=2242] And then you can kind of make another decision about what you want to do about being lost.
[time=2249] Okay. Number two, the second thing that I wanted to say out of this text is the means of spiritual rescue.
[time=2256] I mean by that, how does God save people? How do we get saved?
[time=2261] How does a person who is both locked into the sphere, you know, the sphere of trespasses and sin,
[time=2267] locked in there and also a willing participant inside there?
[time=2270] I mean, not looking to go anywhere else. I mean, I kind of like what I see here and I'm thrilled to stay.
[time=2274] I mean, how does a person who is both locked in there and a willing participant ever, ever reach the standard of perfection to be able to go to Heaven?
[time=2286] Well, the answer comes in the following verses. Verse four, let's begin there. It says this, but God, I love that.
[time=2292] But God, see, now this is cool. You remember the first two words of verse one and you, and you were dead and your trespasses and sins,
[time=2299] and that's kind of the bad news. You get the verse four, you get the good news, and the first two words of the good news are but God.
[time=2304] God's going to do some rescuing here. God's going to take some urgent action on our behalf.
[time=2310] But God, verse four, being rich in mercy because of his great love with which he has loved us.
[time=2316] And I wish I had more time. We could talk a lot about the love of God that moves him to save us.
[time=2321] Verse five, even when we were dead in our trespasses, God made us alive together with Christ.
[time=2329] And then this famous phrase, "By grace you have been saved." Verse six, "And you and I have been raised up with him. He saves us by raising us up with Christ and seating us with Christ in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus."
[time=2348] I know that's kind of confusing, but here's the point. When you get saved by God, when you recognize your lost and you cry out to be saved,
[time=2355] which I'm going to talk about in a second, what happens is you get moved out of the mall.
[time=2360] I mean, you get taken out of this shop and you don't go into another shop, you get completely lifted out of the entire mall in a spiritual realm.
[time=2368] We still live here in our physical bodies and we have to live here until we die and get to go to heaven.
[time=2372] But the spiritual identity, the spiritual citizenship, the spiritual belongingness, the real us, we look what it says.
[time=2380] We get verse six, "Raised up with him and seated in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus." That happens at the moment of salvation.
[time=2389] And that can never be lost, that can never be reversed. That is the blessing, that is the grace of being rescued by God.
[time=2396] Your spiritual identity, your spiritual reality gets moved to another place.
[time=2402] Now you've got to live down here. You've got to finish up down here, but the reality is our spiritual identity is in heaven.
[time=2410] Verse seven, he goes on, "In order that in the ages to come he might show the surpassing riches of his grace in his kindness towards us in Christ."
[time=2418] And all that means is later on we've kind of become these eternal trophies of the love of God.
[time=2423] That God would take people as sinful as we are, as wretched as we are, and rescue us out of that whole trapped system.
[time=2430] He just puts us on display for all of eternity. See, look what I can do in the life of a person.
[time=2437] Now this is where it gets good. These next two verses, look at this, don't miss this. This is the heart of it.
[time=2442] For by grace you have been saved through faith. Listen to this, not of yourselves. It is a gift from God.
[time=2455] And he says it again in case you missed it. Not as a result of works that no one should boast.
[time=2462] I wish there were some way I could play back to you the common responses that I get from a great diversity of people.
[time=2473] I can talk to male or female, older, young, rich or poor, big or small, educated, uneducated.
[time=2481] I talked to all these different people about how to get to heaven, right? I mean it's part of one of the things I do.
[time=2487] And though there is tremendous diversity in their appearance and their age and their status,
[time=2493] there is a commonality in their answer. I asked this question, if you were to die today and stand before God.
[time=2499] And God were to say, why should I let you into heaven? That's my kind of my question.
[time=2504] You would not believe the standard response I get from diversities of people, black or white.
[time=2510] It doesn't matter. Here's the answer I get, basically. Well, I'm trying really hard.
[time=2517] God, I tried really hard. I know I'm not perfect. Nobody is.
[time=2522] But I never murdered anybody. And I was never like, and then they named some notorious sinner.
[time=2529] The commonality of answer is this. God, when it's all said and done, I'm hoping that you let me into heaven because even though I'm not perfect, I tried hard and I didn't do some of the big cardinal sins.
[time=2541] I just can't tell you the universality of that answer that just kind of spans the spectrum of potential respondents.
[time=2552] Now look again at verses 8 and 9 and see if it squares with the Bible.
[time=2556] Verse 8 says, "For by grace you have been saved through faith, not of yourself."
[time=2567] It is the gift of God. It's seen that he says it again.
[time=2570] Not as a result of works that no one should boast.
[time=2576] My friends, God does not save people based upon their own merit
[time=2583] because their own works, no matter how good the person thinks they are, fall impossibly short of the standard that God has
[time=2591] for entrance into the kingdom of heaven. Now friends, we're working double time today on the visuals.
[time=2595] So I got one for you. This is the pogo stick, right?
[time=2599] I know what you're thinking. Go ahead. Do a few. Not going to happen today.
[time=2605] So just let that thought go. Objective. Get to the moon.
[time=2611] It's ridiculous isn't it? I mean it's absolutely ludicrous that you're going to jump your way to the moon on a pogo stick.
[time=2619] Now here's what people do. They try to get to like a super powered pogo stick.
[time=2622] They say, "Well I'm going to lose some weight. I'm going to power up on my legs and I'll lift and I'll get better at pogo jumping and I'm going to find a better pogo and I'm eventually going to pogo my way." Now my friends, that is exactly, I mean that is a comparable illustration of the notion I am going to deserve heaven.
[time=2638] I'm going to earn heaven. I'm going to work hard enough. I'm going to do good enough.
[time=2642] My do goods are going to be better than my bad bads.
[time=2644] I mean I'm going to find a way to literally jump to the moon on a pogo stick.
[time=2651] The Bible is just incredibly clear. It says it in the Old Testament and it says it in the New Testament.
[time=2656] If you think for a minute that you are going to earn heaven by the absence of bad deeds
[time=2662] and the presence of good deeds in your life, it is laughably ridiculous.
[time=2667] Because the distance between your sinfulness and the holiness of God is immeasurable.
[time=2677] Now let me ask you, how are you going to get to the moon?
[time=2682] Literally, how am I going to get to the moon?
[time=2685] Only one way I'm ever going to get to the moon.
[time=2688] And it's if somebody called the President of the United States gives me some type of a free pass to get on the shuttle and fly there.
[time=2699] Right? It's got to be a gift. It's got to be a gift.
[time=2704] And it's got to be a gift that would obviously, I don't even merit.
[time=2707] I mean the kinds of people that get to go on those things are astronauts.
[time=2711] People who are in perfect physical condition, have perfect eyesight and perfect hearing and are brilliant engineers and have been in the thing for years and years and years and there's the cream of the crop and you finally get to the top 100% of every astronaut that ever wanted to do it and they get in that thing and they go.
[time=2730] In other words, when God says I want to bring you to heaven, I want to transport you to heaven.
[time=2736] Out of the sphere of trespass and sin and you say I'm going to earn it or deserve it.
[time=2743] He says you got the time out. You don't get it.
[time=2748] I'll bring you. I can get you there.
[time=2751] But you come as my guest and you come as a gift that I happen to provide for you
[time=2758] through the person of my son.
[time=2761] That's how a person gets rescued.
[time=2766] Look again, verse 8.
[time=2769] It says therefore by grace you have been saved through faith.
[time=2773] You say what do I do? Do I work? Do I try to do better today than I did yesterday and merit?
[time=2778] No, it's impossible. It's ridiculous and it's laughable.
[time=2782] What do I do? Here's our role in this thing. It's called faith.
[time=2787] You and I put our faith in the person of Jesus Christ that he is the one that paid the price tag
[time=2796] on all of our sin and transgression. He paid the wrath price tag.
[time=2801] That's exactly what he did. Jesus came on Christmas, he lived a perfect life and when he died, he stepped up to the counter there at Foot Locker and you and I were getting our plastic out or you and I were getting our dollar bills out and Jesus stepped up and says time out, I covered this one. It's a free gift. Take that stuff.
[time=2818] You don't have to pay for that stuff. It's yours.
[time=2822] When Jesus died on the cross, he took the full brunt of God's wrath for all the sin in my life
[time=2829] and your life and everybody's life.
[time=2831] That's why when he died on the cross, the last word he said was it is finished.
[time=2835] He meant by that I paid the price.
[time=2838] But it is of no value to you unless you put your faith in the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=2844] Today you're in one of two camps.
[time=2846] You're in the camp of self achievement where you're going to try to stand before God on your own works and your own merit and I don't care what religion you've got going because every religion in the world has a works component to it.
[time=2857] Or you're standing there through faith saying Jesus is my only hope.
[time=2864] He paid the price for my sins. He paid the wrath price instead of me.
[time=2869] And my faith is not in my religion and it's not in my good works and it's not in my achievement or the absence of misdeeds.
[time=2876] It is completely and totally in the fact that Jesus paid the wrath price for me.
[time=2882] Okay? That's how God saves people.
[time=2886] That's how God rescues people and he doesn't rescue people any other way.
[time=2890] That's why the Bible says there is no name under heaven by which a man can be saved but Jesus Christ.
[time=2899] It's a wonderful truth. You and I don't have to remain locked in the sphere of transgression
[time=2905] and sin any longer. We can be free.
[time=2910] Third point as we kind of wrap up here.
[time=2914] The third point is okay what do I get saved to?
[time=2917] I understand that I need to be saved. I'm locked up in the sphere.
[time=2921] I understand how I get saved. I get saved through Jesus who by expressing my faith in him he paid the wrath price.
[time=2928] Okay, but what happens to me like the rest of my life?
[time=2933] Verse 10. Look at this. This is one of my favorite verses in the whole Bible.
[time=2939] For we, that means those of us who have given our lives to Christ in faith.
[time=2944] For we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus for good works which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.
[time=2953] This is an astounding truth, my friends. When you and I come to Christ the word of workmanship there could have been translated masterpiece.
[time=2961] It was used of a literary masterpiece of the ancient day.
[time=2965] And the idea is when God gets to work on you, my friends, God being perfect, what he does is perfect.
[time=2972] He turns you into his masterpiece created in Christ Jesus. What does it say?
[time=2977] For what? For good works. What good works? Well the good works that God prepared beforehand that means before the foundation of the world that you and I should walk in them.
[time=2987] The astounding truth is this and there isn't a person I know, there isn't a person I know that doesn't want to have a sense of significance in life.
[time=2994] They want to have the sense that when they're done what they did mattered.
[time=2998] They want to have a sense that when they're done with life they didn't just survive another busy day, another busy week, another busy month, another busy year.
[time=3006] And the whole thing is just kind of a monotonous, mindless, meaningless routine of life.
[time=3010] People are looking to make a mark. People are looking to make a difference. People want a count, right?
[time=3016] And what this says is if you give your life to Christ he will make you into a master piece that is perfectly suited to accomplish the good works that he wants you to do.
[time=3028] The good works that he has for you to do that he decided for you to do even before he created the heavens of the year. That's pretty heavy.
[time=3036] Maybe that's love in your wife. Maybe that's love in your husband. Maybe that's raising your kids. Maybe that's reaching that person at work for the gospel.
[time=3049] Maybe that's helping set up a set for a living Christmas tree that's going to reach 20,000 people in the next two weeks.
[time=3055] You know what? He's made you a masterpiece with capacities and abilities to make a difference in the spiritual warfare for people's eternities.
[time=3066] And you, and this is the part I like about this first, you are perfectly suited to the work he wants to do. There's a one-for-one correlation.
[time=3073] He made you special to do a unique work that's just that he's got just for you.
[time=3078] That's why this stuff over here. If you can't see this little skinny thing is a fly rod. And the other thing obviously is a pole vault.
[time=3088] Now, you know, you think about a pole vault. I mean, I'm amazed. It's the one sport I never ever wanted to try.
[time=3095] I mean, you see them. They run down that thing and they bend the pole and I think, man, what happens if it snaps? What happens if you fall backwards on the runway?
[time=3100] What happens if anything? But they make these poles in such a way that they can catapult 140, 150, 160-pound athletes, you know, 17 feet in the air and then they gracefully fall over this thing.
[time=3112] Just try that with a fly rod, right? Just put that little thing in your hand and start running down the runway and stick it in the hole at the bottom and watch the thing snap.
[time=3122] It's not suited. It's not suited. There's not a one-for-one correlation on the way that that thing was created for its intended use.
[time=3133] But you put this fly rod in the hand of a master fisherman and put him out on a lake or put him up in the Rockies of Colorado somewhere looking for freshwater trout and let him stand out there and do his thing.
[time=3144] And you watch him work that thing. Before you know it, there's fish after fish after fish. I mean, it's like magic and the pole is perfectly weighted and perfectly suited to throw that line out there and get it just where it needs to be and then to be able to pull.
[time=3159] Oh, my. Hand that guy a pole-volting pole. Put a string off the end and say, "Here, go fish." He comes back with nothing. No one-for-one. No one-for-one.
[time=3173] Do you know it's like to be one-for-one suited perfectly to live the kind of life where God is just up there going, "Yes!"
[time=3182] That's exactly why I created you. And that is the exact thing I had for you. That is the exact life I wanted you to touch.
[time=3190] That is the exact ministry that I wanted for you to accomplish. I promise you, if you've never felt that, you haven't begun to live.
[time=3201] It's a long way from being enclosed in trespasses and sin, lacked in the sphere that is orchestrated by Satan, to be rescued by God and having your identity secure in heaven through faith in Christ.
[time=3214] And then you begin to live the rest of your life one-for-one. This is what I created you to do. See? You're doing it.
[time=3224] It's a thrill. Life is hard. I don't want to paint an unrealistic picture. Life can be unfulfilling, and mind is as yours is.
[time=3235] But there are some sweet spots. There are some really sweet spots that come along.
[time=3240] And you say, "Oh, this is one of those deals." You created me for this one. This is that one-for-one thing going on.
[time=3248] So what comes to your mind when you hear the word rescue?
[time=3253] I guess my question for somebody this morning is, "Have you ever been rescued spiritually by God?"
[time=3259] God longs to do that. But God can't begin to do that until you cry out for help.
[time=3266] You've got to be in to say, "Hey, you know what? I've got a need. I don't like the way it's going. I don't like who I am.
[time=3271] I'm on the edge. I'm really out here on the edge, and good things I don't see are in the future for me.
[time=3277] I really am in the power of sin. Trust passes into sin. That's me.
[time=3281] I'm a high-functioning trust pass-in sinner, but I'm a sinner.
[time=3285] And I keep tearing my life down. And it's getting worse.
[time=3289] And worst is, I know I've never dealt with God on the matter.
[time=3294] God wants to rescue you, but there's got to be a sense of personal need.
[time=3300] And then you've got to express your faith. Faith not in your good works, not in your pogo stick.
[time=3305] Faith in the person of Jesus Christ who paid the wrath price.
[time=3309] And then you just anticipate how he transformed you as Chris's song indicated.
[time=3315] Because he will transform you. It's slower than you'd like, but he transformed you.
[time=3319] It's powerful. It's wonderful.
[time=3321] Let me invite you to stand for a closing word prayer.
[time=3330] Will you bow your heads with me for a minute? And if you can, close your eyes, but if you don't like to do that, just leave them open.
[time=3335] But just bow your head for a moment of quiet here. We've got a few minutes.
[time=3340] I want to talk to those of you who have never cried out to God to be saved.
[time=3345] You've been to church. I didn't say that. You've got a Bible. I didn't say that.
[time=3349] You've been through some confirmation. I didn't say that. You've had some experience. I didn't say that.
[time=3354] What I'm saying is if you're here today and you have never cried out to be saved from trespasses and sins, I want to talk to you.
[time=3363] And if you have that in your heart, if you can feel that.
[time=3366] That sense of guilt and that sense of shame and the weight of responsibility for your sin.
[time=3373] You know, that's the spirit of God working with you right now.
[time=3376] That is the spirit of God working with your heart bearing witness to the truth of his word.
[time=3383] I'm going to say a little prayer here in a minute. It's the prayer of salvation.
[time=3388] And if you want to get saved today, if you want to get rescued by God and move into a different kind of life,
[time=3396] then quietly in your heart, wherever you are, God will hear you. It's not a matter of location. It's a matter of sincerity.
[time=3402] God will hear you and He will rescue you right now from your sin.
[time=3407] You follow along. Quietly in your heart as I pray this.
[time=3412] My gracious God and Heavenly Father, I know that I am a sinner.
[time=3419] I know that my life is full of trespasses and sins.
[time=3427] But I believe in Jesus Christ.
[time=3431] Right now, right here, I put my faith, not in my good works.
[time=3438] I put my faith completely in Jesus Christ to be my Savior, to transport me.
[time=3447] I believe that Jesus paid the wrath price for my sins.
[time=3453] And so I ask Him to be my Savior, to come into my heart, and to begin to change my life one for one.
[time=3467] Heavenly Father, You have heard these prayers.
[time=3471] And Father, we know what You do in response to those. You save people.
[time=3475] Thank You for saving the people who prayed that prayer right now.
[time=3479] And Father, we pray You give them a sense of what You've done.
[time=3482] You've done it spiritually, but give them a sense, confirm it for them.
[time=3487] They begin to be powerful in their life as they walk with You for Your glory and for Your honor.
[time=3494] And the rest of us who got saved earlier than today, we just want to say thank You, a fresh and anew,
[time=3502] for providing salvation in Christ for there is no other way.
[time=3507] We pray these things in Christ's name, and all God's people said, Amen. God bless you.
