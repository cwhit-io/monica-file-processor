[time=30] This is the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=53] Thank you for joining us.
[time=54] Welcome to a special edition of the Bible Hour.
[time=57] Today's program includes special music, drama, some songs from the Living Christmas Tree, and a special Christmas message from Pastor Moore.
[time=65] Now let's join our service.
[time=67] All right, all right.
[time=69] This is it.
[time=71] Christmas will be here in T minus 10 hours.
[time=76] That means that we've reached the moment, the big moment.
[time=80] This is the last chance we've got at getting the Christmas spirit.
[time=84] Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.
[time=88] You might say I feel just a little silly yes.
[time=91] Oh, well let me ask you this, oh Miss Tower of Yul Thai Joy.
[time=96] Have you felt like it was Christmas yet?
[time=98] Mm?
[time=99] Got the goosebumps, the warm rush, the joy, the tears, the laughter.
[time=104] I almost laughed yesterday when I saw two old ladies duking it out over the last tick on the Elmo.
[time=109] Hey, you Charles Dickens would have given up on you by now.
[time=114] So I'm not in the Christmas spirit yet.
[time=116] What else is new?
[time=117] Well, neither am I, you said that's the whole point.
[time=121] We only have 10 hours left to get the Christmas spirit, all right?
[time=124] Phil, I am exhausted.
[time=127] I've got it.
[time=128] Why don't we start tomorrow working on the Christmas spirit for next year?
[time=132] Oh no, Marsha.
[time=133] No, no, you're the one that keeps telling me that you're tired of all of your Christmases running together because you haven't felt special during Christmas since you were 16 years old.
[time=143] Okay, so you want to buy me a brand new bike with a banana seat, stick it under the tree and eat a tray full of cookies and sweets and stomp around on the rug with your boots covered with ashes, fill my stockings with Smarties, Neccos and Pez, and wake me up at
[time=158] the crack of dawn, then maybe I'll be in the Christmas spirit.
[time=162] Oh boy, I can see you're going to be a tough one this year.
[time=165] But that's all right because what I have got planned is going to change all of that.
[time=169] If this doesn't melt that icicle heart of yours, nothing will.
[time=173] Are you ready?
[time=175] Yes, but I feel so stupid.
[time=177] All right, now let's make sure we've got everything.
[time=180] Have you got the list?
[time=182] Ah, there it is.
[time=184] Okay, pumpkin pie.
[time=186] Check.
[time=187] Mince pie and M&M cookies with the Christmas colored M&M's.
[time=191] Check.
[time=193] Little cider, egg nog and hot chocolate.
[time=197] Check a roux.
[time=198] And now for you.
[time=199] Have you got the videos?
[time=201] Yes.
[time=203] All right, Charlie Brown Christmas special.
[time=209] Check.
[time=210] The Grinch who stole Christmas?
[time=214] Check.
[time=215] White Christmas, Rudolph the Red Nose Ranger, and it's a wonderful life, original black and white.
[time=220] Check, check, check.
[time=223] Still, this is ridiculous.
[time=225] There's over seven hours of video here.
[time=227] Well, yeah.
[time=228] That's the point.
[time=229] We are going to take those alt-emotions by storm, see?
[time=232] We are going to overload on the senses, and hopefully something inside will flicking.
[time=235] And you make us feel the Christmas spirit.
[time=238] I got it all planned out.
[time=239] Well, call me when you feel something, okay, and I'll just bask in the glow.
[time=243] Oh, no, Marcia, no contact ice here.
[time=245] We are going for the real McCoy.
[time=247] We are going to feel like it's Christmas if it kills us.
[time=250] Okay.
[time=251] But let's start off light.
[time=254] How about Charlie Brown?
[time=256] Fine, and pumpkin pie, I think.
[time=265] All right.
[time=273] Here's yours.
[time=283] Did you press play?
[time=284] Ah, that'll help.
[time=286] There we go.
[time=288] Oh, no.
[time=297] All right.
[time=303] Feel anything yet?
[time=312] Ha-ha.
[time=313] You?
[time=315] Oh, I think.
[time=323] Sorry, it was just heartburn.
[time=330] This isn't going to work.
[time=331] I don't feel a blessed thing.
[time=333] Give us some time.
[time=335] I don't want to give a time, Phil.
[time=336] I mean, come on.
[time=338] If I don't have this warm to the cockles, peace on earth, goodwill towards men, Christ is the Lord, feeling by nine o'clock on Christmas Eve, I don't deserve to feel anything at all.
[time=348] Come on, hon.
[time=349] Don't bail out on me now.
[time=352] Try the Grinch.
[time=354] Come on, hon.
[time=355] You love the Grinch.
[time=357] Pop in the old Grinch.
[time=358] I don't think some indefinable green mammal in a tacky Santa suit and his wimpy dog are going to cut it this year, Phil.
[time=366] Well, you love the Grinch.
[time=368] Look, come on.
[time=373] I don't feel a thing.
[time=376] Look, obviously, there's something wrong.
[time=379] I don't know how many Christmases.
[time=381] I haven't felt the first spark of what the season is all about.
[time=384] I did my part, OK?
[time=386] I held up my end of the deal.
[time=388] I finished my Christmas shopping early.
[time=391] I bought things at the church boutique.
[time=394] I took canned goods down to the local food pantry.
[time=397] I've even put coins in the salvation army bucket.
[time=400] Come on.
[time=401] If that doesn't do it, nothing will.
[time=404] You've given it a good college tribe.
[time=406] And I think little Cindy Lou who's going to bed.
[time=408] But-- Oh, cut it out.
[time=414] It's just the snowstorm.
[time=416] I think there's a candle and some matches on top of the TV.
[time=418] All right.
[time=425] All righty, here we go.
[time=428] We'll have light here in just a second.
[time=431] Let's see which end of the match to strike.
[time=435] There we go.
[time=436] Phil, is that the crystal nut dish?
[time=443] Yeah.
[time=445] We had to make do.
[time=447] Anyway, it's kind of nice, don't you think?
[time=450] Why don't you come on over here and sit?
[time=453] You're not going to sing that silly who-ville song again, are you?
[time=457] Oh, no, no.
[time=458] I sang all I know.
[time=459] You know, for a moment there, I almost felt peaceful.
[time=474] Me too.
[time=477] Do you think Mary and Joseph felt like this?
[time=479] Like what?
[time=481] Frustrated, exhausted, hassled from standing in line
[time=487] and people pushing and shoving.
[time=489] And no electricity?
[time=491] Yeah, I suppose.
[time=493] Different, though.
[time=495] How so?
[time=496] Well, they had Jesus right there with them.
[time=500] I mean, right there in their arms, he was that close.
[time=504] But he was a baby.
[time=505] Well, yeah, but that only meant that only meant that he had all of their attention.
[time=513] Yeah, you're right.
[time=516] You know, sometimes I wish there could be a star.
[time=520] What do you mean?
[time=522] I mean, like every year, like a Bethlehem star, you know?
[time=525] You could look up and always know what direction you needed to go.
[time=530] Yeah, but how many of us would actually look up?
[time=532] Yeah, we'd probably miss out on that parking spot we've been waiting for.
[time=535] [LAUGHS] Oh.
[time=539] Why do you think Christmas changes when we get older?
[time=543] Oh, I don't know.
[time=547] I guess we just lose the wonder of it all, you know?
[time=549] How wonderful it all is.
[time=552] It's like the manger becomes ordinary and commonplace, like it's just a part of life.
[time=558] But it's more than that.
[time=560] It is life.
[time=561] Well, yeah, we can't just take it as part of a package and hope that that will do it for us.
[time=567] It has to be wonderful every time.
[time=570] But it's not.
[time=571] I don't know why.
[time=574] Well, I think it's still wonderful, even if we don't feel like it.
[time=579] The angel song doesn't lose its message just because we can't hear it right now.
[time=585] Phil?
[time=586] Mm?
[time=587] I wish we could start this whole thing over again.
[time=589] You know, start the season back from the very beginning.
[time=592] And this time, do it right.
[time=597] Marcia?
[time=598] Mm?
[time=600] I think we already have.
[time=603] Got any of those Christmas cookies left?
[time=606] Oh, no.
[time=606] There is a woman with the Christmas spirit if ever I saw one.
[time=610] Thanks, Phil.
[time=611] You bet.
[time=613] Hey, the lights.
[time=614] [INAUDIBLE] Did you invite carolers?
[time=619] [INAUDIBLE] Come on in.
[time=624] I've never seen these people before, hun.

[time=655] Well, we sure do.
[time=656] Come on.
[time=657] You guys come on in.
[time=658] Have a seat.
[time=659] We're going to go change into something a lot less comfortable.
[time=662] You can feel free.
[time=664] Phil, would you plug in the tree?
[time=667] Yeah.
[time=669] Phil, plug in the tree.
[time=671] [LAUGHTER]
[time=677] I hate this part.

[time=782] Let man give songs and floss, while fields and floods, while fields and plains, repeat the sounding joy.

[time=1085] (Music)
[time=1313] Stories that are real, and stories that are made up are all part of Christmas. Can I read you guys a story? Can I read you a story, Michelle?
[time=1324] This is a new Christmas story written by a man named Max Lecato, and it's called "Alabaster Song." Let me read it to you.
[time=1335] I was six years old when I met an angel called "Alabaster." That was a long time ago. I'm grown up now and have a little boy of my own, but I still remember "Alabaster." Here's how I first met him.
[time=1350] My parents always put our Christmas tree near my room. I could see it through the doorway. When everyone thought I was asleep, I would lie in bed and stare at the lights and count the shiny balls. I would watch the color glimmer on the icicles. And I know this sounds a little funny, but I would talk to the angel.
[time=1368] High atop the tree he sat, he had feathery white wings and a gold and halo. I knew he wasn't real, well at least I thought he wasn't real, but he looked so friendly with those red chubby cheeks and bright eyes, and he looked young. Maybe that's why I talked to him. All my brothers and sisters were older than me, and he was the only one in the house my age.
[time=1391] So I talked to him, and I named him "Alabaster." I asked him questions about being an angel. I asked him, "Do angels have to go to bed early? Do your wings keep you warm? Do you ever get tired of sitting on the tree?" He never spoke, but that didn't keep me from asking.
[time=1409] One night, when I was in that in-between place between asleep and awake, I asked just one more question. What was it like to see Bethlehem? That must have been the right question, because suddenly Alabaster was standing beside my bed. Oh, it was wonderful!
[time=1428] His face was round and his eyes were bright. His gold and halo and white feathers glowed and sparkled. He talked to me like we were old friends, and when he spoke, he sounded like he was missing.
[time=1438] His two front teeth. Oh, it was a great night. We went to the fepherds because they were awake. Oh, and they were so nice. And most of the times they thought we were stars, but that night they knew something special was in the air. And he giggled, and he giggled, and he giggled, and he giggled, but made me giggle too.
[time=1457] By now I was sitting on the edge of my bed. Well, what did you do? We just sang. Do you want to hear the phone?
[time=1465] Yeah, I said. And from that little angel came the most beautiful music. He put back his head and fill our house with the melody only Heaven had heard and only Heaven could make.
[time=1476] He sang and sang like God himself was listening. I put my head on my pillow and listened until I opened my eyes, and the sun was up, and it was Christmas morning.
[time=1490] Get up. It was my dad shaking me. Come and see your presence. I jumped out of bed and ran to the tree. There was everything I'd asked for, skates, a baseball glove, a train. I was so excited. I forgot all about alabaster in his song.
[time=1505] Soon all the presents were open. We all sat around talking, and laughing, and looking at all the new stuff.
[time=1512] That's when I heard the song again. Alabaster's song. The room was full of it. I looked up. Little alabaster was on the tree with his head back and his mouth open. He was singing just like he had the night before.
[time=1526] I looked around at my family. No one else was looking at the angel. They were all talking like nothing was happening at all.
[time=1534] Do you hear the singing? I asked my dad. No. Do you mom? No, she answered. No one else heard him. But I heard him as clear as if I were on the tree next to him. His head was turned toward the window, and he was singing to Jesus just like he had done that first night in Bethlehem.
[time=1556] The next Christmas when I was seven, I heard him again. And the next. He would stop at my bed on Christmas even, sing. And from the top of the tree on Christmas morning, he would sing to Jesus.
[time=1567] And every year I saw him. And every year I heard him. Then I got older.
[time=1574] I forgot to look for him. I forgot to listen for him. And after a few Christmases, I didn't hear him anymore. I forgot about his song.
[time=1584] Until today. Today's Christmas. And this morning as we opened our presents, I noticed that my little boy, my little boy was looking at the angel on the tree.
[time=1595] And after a moment, he turned to me and said, Do you hear the song, Daddy?
[time=1602] Lulee, lulee, thou little tiny child.
[time=1612] By by lulee, lulee, lulee.
[time=1620] Lulee, lulee, thou little tiny child.
[time=1630] By by lulee, lulee.
[time=1644] By by lulee, lulee, lulee.
[time=1671] Herod the king in his raging, charged at he hath this day. His men of might in his own sight.
[time=1695] All young children to slay.
[time=1704] Lulee, lulee, thou little tiny child.
[time=1713] By by lulee, lulee.
[time=1721] Lulee, lulee, thou little tiny child.
[time=1730] By by lulee, lulee.
[time=1744] I really love the Christmas story and I love to tell it and today I want to tell it using some of this stuff up here on this table.
[time=1754] And I hope it helps you understand just how exciting it is that God sent his son to be our Savior.
[time=1763] And to help we're going to have some stuff on the screens because a lot of this stuff you won't be able to see unless it's up there.
[time=1772] And so I'm like wondering where it is.
[time=1781] I'll just kind of get started and hope they fix that problem.
[time=1785] There we go. Now that's not much but this is.
[time=1792] The Bible starts with these incredible words.
[time=1795] It says in the beginning God. In the beginning God.
[time=1801] And the Bible says a lot about God.
[time=1804] It says that God is all powerful.
[time=1807] It says that God is all wise. He knows everything.
[time=1811] It says that God is on my present which means that he's everywhere all at once. He's never not anywhere.
[time=1818] But the only thing the Bible says about God three times in a row is that he's holy.
[time=1827] It says in Isaiah chapter six verse three.
[time=1831] And one called out to another and said holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts.
[time=1838] The whole earth is full of his glory.
[time=1843] And today if you will I'd like you to let this beautiful clear pristine picture of water represent the holiness of God.
[time=1852] There is no contamination. There's no nothing vile, no sin, no selfishness.
[time=1856] God has never sinned and God will never sinned and God can't even be tempted to sin.
[time=1861] He is holy and he's righteous and he's pure.
[time=1866] And for a reason I don't understand God wanted to have fellowship with some created beings.
[time=1873] And so he said let us make man in our image according to our likeness and let them rule.
[time=1883] And so God created man in his own image.
[time=1887] In the image of God he created him male and female he created them.
[time=1893] And so God as the scriptures say created man in his own image.
[time=1900] Now that meant a lot of things too.
[time=1903] Man had the ability to think and the ability to choose, the ability to have relationship with the true and living God.
[time=1912] But one of the things that was so wonderful and so marvelous about the way God created man and woman in the very beginning was that they too
[time=1922] were holy, spotless without blemish.
[time=1929] God put them in a garden and we'll let this tree represent the garden.
[time=1934] It says in Genesis 2 8 that the Lord God planted a garden toward the east in Eden
[time=1940] and there he placed the man whom he had formed.
[time=1944] Out of the ground the Lord caused to grow every tree that is pleasing to the site and good for food.
[time=1951] The tree of life also in the midst of the garden and then of course the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
[time=1958] And we'll let this tree be the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
[time=1961] It was a great time to be alive.
[time=1964] Adam and Eve sinless, holy, uncontaminated by sin in the presence of a pure and holy righteous God bound up in all the creative genius of God
[time=1978] the garden that knew no sin and had no sin.
[time=1982] Man it was a great thing.
[time=1984] And God said to Adam and Eve y'all can do anything you want to do in the whole wide world.
[time=1989] You can eat from any tree, you can do anything you want to do but I'm going to ask you not to do one thing.
[time=1997] The Lord God commanded the man saying from any tree of the garden you may eat freely but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
[time=2004] You shall not eat from the day you eat from it.
[time=2008] You will surely die.
[time=2011] Just that one thing Adam and Eve just that one thing and I don't know why he put that tree in there and I don't know why he said you can't eat from it.
[time=2020] Maybe it was because he wanted to know if they loved him enough to obey him.
[time=2029] But there came a day it says in the Bible.
[time=2033] Apparently Eve got, and I think Adam because the Bible says he was with her and there's a word that means proximity.
[time=2040] I think they were both in proximity to each other and I think they were both in proximity to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
[time=2047] And Satan, Satan had taken the form of a snake.
[time=2053] And who knows maybe he was wrapped up in that tree or maybe he was standing next to the tree.
[time=2059] The Bible says that he was the most crafty, the serpent was the most crafty of all the beasts that God had made.
[time=2069] And Satan asked Eve a question, has God said, has God said you shall not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil?
[time=2080] And she answered and said yeah he has.
[time=2083] He said that if we eat of it or even touch it, she kind of added that, God didn't say that.
[time=2088] She said if we eat it or even touch from it then in the day we do that we'll die.
[time=2093] And then Satan lied to her and he said you shall surely not die.
[time=2099] He called God a liar and he said that God wasn't telling the truth and he said the only reason that God doesn't want you to eat from this tree is that you like he will be able to know good and evil.
[time=2109] And on that tragic day the Bible says that when Eve saw that the tree was good for food and that it was a delight to the eyes and that it was desirable to make one wise.
[time=2128] She took from its fruit and she ate and something terrible happened that day where she had been given a pure and a holy and a righteous heart before God.
[time=2144] That sin had corrupted her heart, that violation of God's law did something to her heart that made it evil and it made it wicked and it made it selfish.
[time=2161] The Bible says she gave to her husband and he ate also, oh man.
[time=2168] And there goes Adam's heart, once a pure, holy, loving, self-sacrificial heart that could commune with God and have no sense of separation from God.
[time=2183] But that sin put a great, great barrier, a great division between a holy and a righteous and a pure God and men and women with sinful hearts.
[time=2196] And they could no longer walk with God in the cool of the day.
[time=2199] And they could no longer freely interact with God, they felt shame.
[time=2203] In fact it says that the eyes of both of them were open and they knew they were naked and they sowed fig leaves together, covered themselves.
[time=2211] You see because no longer could they stand the penetrating gaze of a holy God for they no longer were holy themselves.
[time=2220] And God took them out of the garden so they could never come back.
[time=2225] In fact put an angel there to guard to make sure they never came back.
[time=2231] It was a sad, sad day.
[time=2235] Well not too long after that, actually a long time but not very many pages in Scripture.
[time=2242] Adam had a son.
[time=2245] And the Bible says in Genesis 5-3 it says this, when Adam had lived 130 years he became the father of a son, now listen to this, in his own likeness.
[time=2259] God had made Adam in God's likeness but now Adam had sinned and corrupted his heart.
[time=2265] And so when he gave birth or they made a son together they had a son that was in their likeness.
[time=2274] And the problem of a sinful wicked heart had gone now from one generation to the next and that generation had another generation and the child that they bore was sinful.
[time=2285] And then the children that this person bore they also had a sinful heart.
[time=2289] And it just went on and on and on and on down to the generation so that everyone who was ever born was born with that sinful wicked selfish heart and rebellion against God.
[time=2301] And it went from that generation to this generation to the next generation to the next generation until it finally came to your generation.
[time=2309] It finally came to your family.
[time=2315] And there's your grandpa and your grandmother and they were born with sinful hearts.
[time=2322] And here's your mom and dad.
[time=2325] That's how they were born, sinful hearts rebellious against God selfish to the core.
[time=2333] Guess who this is? This is you.
[time=2339] This is your heart.
[time=2341] This is how you were born.
[time=2343] You were born alienated from God.
[time=2347] The great King David after he had committed adultery and after he had murdered the husband of the woman that he had committed adultery with cried out and saw him 51-5.
[time=2360] That this behold I was brought forth in iniquity and sin did my mother conceive me.
[time=2367] What he was giving evidence to was you know what this wicked heart I was born sinful.
[time=2373] That's why I sin because my heart is corrupt, deceitful and selfish.
[time=2380] And it represented a great separation between he and God just like it represents a great separation between me and God and you and God our hearts.
[time=2387] There's just no way because God said as David reflected his heart and saw him 51-6 behold you desire truth in the innermost being.
[time=2397] What you want right here in the core of my life, you want truth.
[time=2403] And I don't have any of it to offer.
[time=2407] And I can't be in fellowship with God.
[time=2409] And I can't walk with God and I can't go to heaven and be with him for all of eternity.
[time=2415] And so the cry of the human heart David tried out purify me with hissop and I will be clean.
[time=2422] Wash me and I will be wider than snow.
[time=2424] He cried out oh God creating me a clean heart.
[time=2432] You know there's no way for a man to do that for himself.
[time=2435] There's no way for a child to clean their own heart.
[time=2441] All the religion in the world, all the activity, all the nice behavior, all the stuff you could possibly get yourself to do
[time=2449] will never ever ever change the core reality of your heart.
[time=2455] And that's why Christmas is so exciting.
[time=2463] They called his name Jesus. God sent his own son and they said some pretty amazing things about his son.
[time=2472] They said he was counselor. They said he was mighty God.
[time=2475] They said the government would rest upon his shoulders.
[time=2478] But they said one thing that just has to ring through all of history.
[time=2484] They said that this one was born of a virgin.
[time=2489] This one didn't have an earthly father.
[time=2492] This one didn't get his nature from the generation before because by a miracle the Holy Spirit brought forth
[time=2501] conception in the womb of a woman.
[time=2504] And what you get in the heart of the baby who lay in the manger is a pure heart.
[time=2510] It's a righteous heart.
[time=2512] And that's why they said about Jesus.
[time=2514] He is the lamb without blemish.
[time=2517] He is the pure and holy righteous Savior who can lay his down.
[time=2522] His life is down for us. He who knew no sin.
[time=2526] He who knew no sin.
[time=2530] The miracle of Christmas my friends is that what was born in that manger about 2,000 years ago was not born of a man.
[time=2538] It was not born of a corrupt seed that was passed from one generation to the next generation until it finally found its way to your heart.
[time=2544] He was born of a virgin. He was conceived by the Spirit of God and he is holy and he is righteous.
[time=2552] And so he is the one who can die for our sins.
[time=2555] He is the one who can pay the penalty for our wicked heart.
[time=2562] It says in Luke 1.30, "The angel said to her, 'Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.
[time=2571] And behold, you will conceive in your womb a son and you shall call his name Jesus.'"
[time=2581] The word Jesus means Savior.
[time=2585] You shall call his name Savior because he is the one.
[time=2590] He is the only one who can save us from our sins.
[time=2596] You know what happens when you put your faith in Jesus?
[time=2599] Do you know what happens when you ask Jesus to be your Savior?
[time=2603] It's an amazing thing. It says in 2 Corinthians 5, 17, "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ,
[time=2611] therefore, if any man is in Christ, he is a new creature.
[time=2617] Old things have passed away.
[time=2619] Behold, things have become new." And that newness includes a clean heart,
[time=2628] a forgiveness of all sins past, present, and future.
[time=2632] So that finally, once and for all, we can again, man, let's get rid of that.
[time=2640] We can again have fellowship with the true and living God.
[time=2645] We can walk with God through this life.
[time=2649] We can ask for His help and He hears our prayers.
[time=2652] We can live according to His truth because we have a new heart.
[time=2655] These are the promises of the new covenant where God said, "I will take away the heart of stone, and I will give you a heart of flesh, and you will honor me, and you will obey me, because I will not just save you from hell.
[time=2667] I will change your heart."
[time=2673] It says in 1 John 1, 9, that if we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us all in righteousness and to cleanse us.
[time=2686] I just really have one question for you today.
[time=2692] Which one of these represent your heart?
[time=2695] Which one of these is you?
[time=2698] And you know, you might be here today and you might be like four, five, or six, or seven years old, and you're saying, "You know, I think this right over here is me, because I don't obey my parents like I'm supposed to, and I do lie to them, and I do sneak behind their back, and I know that that comes from my sinful heart, that comes from right in there.
[time=2718] But there may be others of you who are 40, or 50, or 60, and you say, "Yeah, I'll tell you what I've got.
[time=2725] I've got a life history of what this heart has done to my wife, and to my husband, and to my kids, and to my friends." Yeah, I've got a life script that explains the color, the disposition, the sinfulness, the wickedness that resides in my heart.
[time=2747] And the great reality of Christmas, and the great reality of this very moment, is it doesn't have to be that way.
[time=2754] Because Jesus came to make you new.
[time=2757] Jesus came to wash and to cleanse you from all unrighteousness.
[time=2766] Let me invite you to bow your heads for a closing word of prayer.
[time=2774] Heavenly Father, we look inside, inside the chronicle of history,
[time=2783] and no sooner did Cain slay Abel than the whole thing.
[time=2788] Like a big, huge snowball began to take its momentum.
[time=2792] And we look back to that moment in history where sin entered the human heart, and we look at all that's transpired, and we see the murders, and the rapes, and the dishonesty, and the broken vows, and the broken families, and the broken hearts, and the broken lives.
[time=2808] And we know that nothing in human history was ever going to reverse that except that you sent your pure, holy, righteous Savior.
[time=2817] For those of you who are here today who have never prayed to receive Jesus, then you might be five, or you might be six years old, or you might be forty, or fifty, or sixty.
[time=2827] But if you want to have a clean heart today, and if you want God to perform that miracle in your heart today, it can happen right here and right now.
[time=2838] I'll say a prayer out loud, and if you say it in your heart, God will hear it, and God will save you, wash you.
[time=2847] It goes like this.
[time=2849] My gracious God and Heavenly Father, I know that I am a sinner.
[time=2854] I know that I have a wicked heart.
[time=2857] I see it in my life.
[time=2860] I want to be in Christ.
[time=2862] I want to be forgiven through Christ.
[time=2864] I want to be washed. Why does snow?
[time=2868] By the shed blood of Jesus Christ.
[time=2872] And so I ask Him to be my Savior right here and right now.
[time=2879] And Lord, for those of us who have been saved now for a long time, now we wonder where our Christmas spirit might have gone.
[time=2888] Father, help us never to forget the image of that pristine, pure heart coming up out of that manger.
[time=2895] It wasn't just a baby. It was a pure baby.
[time=2898] It was a holy baby. It was a righteous baby, and it was your son.
[time=2904] And we would worship you right now for the power of Christ to cleanse us from sin.
[time=2910] We would worship you right now for the difference that Christ has been making in our lives
[time=2916] since we accepted Him as our Savior.
[time=2918] We thank you and we praise you in Christ's name. Amen.

[time=3087] In the sixth month, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee, to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David.
[time=3103] The virgin's name was Mary. The angel went to her and said, "Greetings, you who are highly favored. The Lord is with you."
[time=3111] Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.
[time=3117] But the angels said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary. You have found favor with God. You will be with child and give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus.
[time=3128] He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father, David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever. His kingdom will never end."
