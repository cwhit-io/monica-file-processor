[time=0] [beep] [beep] [beep] [beep] [beep] [beep] [beep] [beep] [beep] What was going on in the heart of the mind of Paul, not in a moment of crisis on the plane of Dora, or in the preaching of Acts 7,
[time=48] but day after day and month after month and year after year through all of the beatings and all of the stonings
[time=55] and all of the hardships and all of the sleepless nights and all of the imprisonments and all of the false accusations.
[time=62] Where in the world did that man find the strength in the inner man to stay faithful to his calling?
[time=70] [MUSIC]
[time=76] This is the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church. Thank you for joining us.
[time=82] Where does inner strength come from? Where did Joseph get the strength to resist temptation?
[time=87] And why is it that many times we fail to resist temptation?
[time=91] Join with us this morning as Pastor Moore talks about praying for power. Now let's join our service.
[time=97] [MUSIC - 87 seconds]
[time=189] [APPLAUSE]
[time=201] When I think of the wisdom and scope of his plan, I fall down on my knees and I pray to the Father of all the great family of God.
[time=210] Some of the Martyrd in heaven and some down here on earth, that out of his glorious unlimited resources he will give you the mighty inner strengthening of his Holy Spirit.
[time=220] And I pray that Christ will be more and more at home in your hearts, living within you as you trust in him.
[time=227] May your roots go down deep into the soil of God's marvelous love, and may you be able to feel and understand as all God's children should, how long, how wide, how deep, and how high his love really is.
[time=242] He gave it more grace when the burdens grew greater.
[time=249] He sent it more strength when the labors increased.
[time=256] To added affliction, he added his mercy to multiply trials.
[time=268] His multiplied peace, his love has no limit, his grace has no measure,
[time=281] his power has a boundary known to him.
[time=290] For out of the infinite riches in Jesus,
[time=301] he gave it and he gave it and he gave it again.
[time=314] When we have exhausted our store of endures,
[time=321] when our strength has failed, here the day is half done.
[time=329] When we've reached the end of our hearted resources,
[time=337] our fathers forgiving has only begun.
[time=346] His love has no limit, his grace has no measure,
[time=355] his power has a boundary known to him.
[time=365] For out of the infinite riches in Jesus,
[time=377] he gave it and he gave it and he gave it again.
[time=402] Those are such great lyrics, a real reflection of the heart of a God who loves to give.
[time=411] It's his character to give grace and peace.
[time=418] Who wouldn't want to trust a God like that?
[time=420] Who would shrink away?
[time=422] It would have to be someone who was ignorant, maybe someone who was so caught up with his own agenda, so living in just the here and now that he couldn't possibly step back
[time=439] and see the big picture and realize what God is doing.
[time=446] Probably someone like me, or maybe even like you.
[time=453] Maybe someone who would know how the little eagle felt when its day had come
[time=462] and its parents not so gently nudged it out of the nest and over the edge of the cliff so that it could find its wings
[time=473] and discover that they were sufficient.
[time=477] Not just to break its fall, but sufficient to soar.
[time=483] They had given those wings, the parents, but it's up to the eagle to use them.
[time=491] And often it's the same with us.
[time=493] In those first few moments before he chose to use them, can you imagine what it was like?
[time=500] The terror of falling like a rock toward the earth.
[time=505] The total bewilderment of how it had happened.
[time=510] Feeling betrayed and abandoned and alone, helpless, unloved, unprotected.
[time=519] Do you know what that feels like?
[time=521] Of course you do.
[time=523] You've been there.
[time=525] I have felt feelings like that as recently as last night.
[time=529] It's not beyond any of us.
[time=534] But the good news is that we continue to learn that God is there,
[time=540] that He's not given up on us and He's not lost sight of us.
[time=545] He calls us to walk by faith.
[time=548] And over and over throughout Scripture we see instances of men and women having real feelings like that.
[time=556] The Psalms are filled with them, wondering where God has gone.
[time=560] In their time of weakness and despair, not sensing His presence, crying out,
[time=566] "Oh Lord, my soul longs for you."
[time=573] In this my time of great need.
[time=578] I fear you have left me alone.
[time=584] There is no one who cares, who can answer my prayers.
[time=590] Lord, I feel I am sinking like stone.
[time=596] But Lord, you've promised to hear when I cry out in prayer, when I search for you with all my might.
[time=606] So please hear me now in this hour of despair to my darkness into your light.
[time=615] You are a rescue in God.
[time=618] You are a saving Lord.
[time=620] May you delight in the sound of your children's praise.
[time=623] You are a rescuing God.
[time=625] You are a saving Lord.
[time=627] And I will praise your name to all my keys.
[time=632] Oh Lord, my eyes can now sing.
[time=637] The sin that I've hidden from you.
[time=643] The price that it's caused me to pay.
[time=648] All the pain and despair, even sickness to bear,
[time=654] and the shame and reproach of this day.
[time=660] But now I open my heart and I humbly repent of the sin I have committed against you.
[time=669] And for the time that I have so foolishly spent
[time=675] in hiding from your holy view.
[time=679] You are a rescuing God.
[time=682] You are a saving Lord.
[time=683] And you delight in the sound of your children's praise.
[time=687] You are a rescuing God.
[time=689] You are a saving Lord.
[time=690] And I will praise your name to all my days.
[time=693] You are a rescuing God.
[time=695] You are a saving Lord.
[time=697] And you delight in the sound of your children's praise.
[time=700] You are a rescuing God.
[time=702] You are a saving Lord.
[time=704] And I will praise your name to all my days.
[time=715] Hope, praise your name.
[time=745] [MUSIC - 232 seconds]
[time=979] [APPLAUSE]
[time=981] [MUSIC - 137 seconds]
[time=1122] Listen to these words.
[time=1124] [MUSIC - 7 seconds]
[time=1140] That really is the prayer of our hearts this morning.
[time=1143] And there's another prayer that we have, and that is that before this service is over, when you get toward the end of the message you're about to hear, that you will discover what it means to really fall in love with God all over again.
[time=1157] We serve an awesome God, one who has chosen to not only redeem us and adopt us, but to engage us by allowing us to partner with Him, elevating us to service with Himself, a great God.
[time=1173] Saying, "Will you stand?" "Well, please, we're going to sing together." I belong to a mighty God.
[time=1178] [MUSIC - 101 seconds]
[time=1282] Do you believe it? Come on, one more time, sing it out.
[time=1285] [MUSIC - 17 seconds]
[time=1309] - Thank you for your good singing this morning.
[time=1311] You may be seated.
[time=1312] - Well, that's wonderful, wonderful worship.
[time=1322] Thank you so much.
[time=1324] Let me invite you to take your Bible this morning and come with me to Ephesians chapter three.
[time=1328] And if you're visiting today, be helpful for you to know that we're studying the book of Ephesians and we just kind of take it passage by passage and chapter by chapter.
[time=1338] This morning, we come to Ephesians chapter three.
[time=1340] We'll be looking at a passage in verses 14 to 21.
[time=1343] And to help you tune into the topic this morning, let me begin with kind of a question I'll direct at your heart, direct at your mind.
[time=1351] The question is this, are you winning or losing the battle?
[time=1356] Are you winning or losing the battle for obedience this morning?
[time=1361] Are you strong in obedience this morning as you sit here and reflect upon the last month or so of your life or are you weak?
[time=1369] Are you under control or are you out of control?
[time=1375] Is your heart soft towards God and the things of God in his direction in your life or are you hardened in your heart against him?
[time=1382] The passage that we're gonna study this morning is really a prayer.
[time=1387] It's a prayer that Paul utters for power.
[time=1390] And there is the heart of the prayer in verse 16.
[time=1394] I invite you to look there just at the beginning before we go back and then look kind of at each verse.
[time=1398] But in verse 16 it says this, that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with power through his spirit in the inner man.
[time=1409] That in reality is what Paul is praying for.
[time=1412] That you and I, or in this case, that the saint at Ephesus would be strengthened with power through his spirit in the inner man.
[time=1420] And as I ponder that phrase, I often ask myself the question, why is it that some men and women are so strong in the inner man and others are so weak?
[time=1432] I mean, what was it in the heart, the inner man of Abraham that gave him the strength to raise the knife up over Isaac, fully intending to pludge it down into his chest?
[time=1445] Where did he get the strength to do that?
[time=1448] What was going on inside the inner man of Joseph who in the very clutches of Potiphar's wife after months of personal seductive solicitation and in her frustration she finally reaches out and grabs onto his garment.
[time=1462] Where did the guy get the strength in the inner man to leave the garment and run out of the house?
[time=1468] Where did Joshua and Caleb get the strength to return back with the 10 others who had investigated the land and stand against their testimony in front of the entire assembly.
[time=1481] And though much of what they said was true about the size of the land and the size of the people and the fortification of the city and the people were buying it, hook, line, and sinker, where did Joshua and Caleb get the strength to stand up and say it's not true if God wants us to have the land, we'll have the land.
[time=1498] I mean, how come they could look at those giants and those weapons of war and not feel timid in their hearts as the others did?
[time=1504] What was going on in the heart and the mind and the inner person of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego on the plane of Dura as every representative from the major countries of the world had been summoned there by an egomaniac who had constructed this golden image and set up the sound of the trumpet, everybody bows down or the fire in that furnace right there, you're in.
[time=1527] I mean, what was going on inside of them as that big band began to play and you could hear the shuffle of feet and the ruffle of clothing and the whole place just went flat.
[time=1540] And there they are, standing.
[time=1542] What was going on inside the inner man of Stephen
[time=1549] in Acts chapter seven, I mean, there he is.
[time=1552] He's preaching the gospel to people that are lost and on their way to hell and he gets to the end of his message and they start grinding their teeth at him.
[time=1561] Literally, the text says, gnashing their teeth.
[time=1564] It wasn't a surprise what was coming next when they bent over and picked up the very rocks that would soon crush his skull and take his life.
[time=1572] But he just keeps preaching the truth and at the end begins to beg God to forgive these folks for they know not what they do.
[time=1580] What was going on in there?
[time=1583] Why was he so strong?
[time=1586] What was going on with Paul?
[time=1590] Not a moment of crisis in Acts seven or the plane of Dura with Shadrach.
[time=1594] Not a moment of crisis.
[time=1595] But I mean, what was going on day after day and week after week and year after year?
[time=1600] Through all of the beatings and all of the stonings and all of the hardships and all of the sleepless nights.
[time=1607] All of the hard-heartedness that filled many of the churches he himself had planted and had attempted to grow.
[time=1613] All of the imprisonments, I mean, how did the guy continue to get up day after day after day and give his life, as he said, a drink offering, pouring it out that the elect might come to Christ?
[time=1625] Where do you get that kind of strength?
[time=1627] How come those people were so strong and then there's this other list of people that were so incredibly weak?
[time=1633] What happened in the heart of Cain when he slew Abel?
[time=1636] I mean, what a weak, impoverished, foolish, sinful thing to do.
[time=1642] What had gone out of Esau
[time=1648] when he gave his entire birthright for one meal?
[time=1658] What happened with Lot's wife?
[time=1660] When she was leaving unquestionably the most sinful, depraved, wretched city in the face of the earth, why did she look back?
[time=1669] What was attractive to her there?
[time=1672] What was wrong inside that made her long for the days of yesteryear?
[time=1677] Where was David's heart?
[time=1686] I mean, what had gone wrong inside of that man when he looked out across the housetops and saw her and beckoned for her and brought her to his palace and took her in that room and then violated her and his relationship with God?
[time=1703] Where was that young warrior that had faced Goliath?
[time=1708] Now, what happened to Peter on that inside man thing?
[time=1716] After three years of living and eating and sleeping and drinking and witnessing the very miraculous power of the incarnate God, all of the power and all the wisdom and all the love and all of the deity in techno color for three years and he says, I'll never deny you.
[time=1734] The next day he did to a total stranger.
[time=1739] What happens to the inner man?
[time=1746] Where does it go?
[time=1748] And which camp are you in this morning?
[time=1751] It's certain you're in one or the other because there is no holding pattern in the spiritual world.
[time=1760] I mean, you're heading in a direction.
[time=1762] I'm heading in a direction.
[time=1763] Which direction are you heading in today?
[time=1765] To a weakened, impoverished inner man that will cave in on you or are you heading in the direction of a stronger inner man?
[time=1776] A strengthened inner man that will serve you well.
[time=1781] The great news in this text, the great news in this prayer is that help is available.
[time=1790] God stands in a posture that is ready and available to help.
[time=1795] Available to help you today, you personally, I mean, if this is you heading in this southbound direction, he stands ready to help you today in this hour, in this place.
[time=1807] And like so many of us, if you have a loved one that is gone astray, that is belligerently pursuing a path that they know is wrong, that they know is self-destructive, that they know will lead to no end, but they've lost the inner strength to turn and genuine repentance back to the truth.
[time=1831] Then what this passage holds for you is as Paul, the very prayer for strength to come from on high, to help and to encourage.
[time=1839] And you know me well enough to know that this is not a cause and effect deal.
[time=1842] I am not promising you a little formula.
[time=1845] I am not promising you a little, you know, ditty thing that if you do this, God will do this.
[time=1850] It's a dynamic thing that goes on between the human heart and the true and living God.
[time=1854] And it is not in our control to pray power where and cause effects that violate human will, but it is Paul's pattern and it is his strong and firm conviction that this prayer makes a difference or he wouldn't be on his knees praying it.
[time=1869] And so while I don't offer you a quick fix and a solution to every problem, there is a pattern and there is a man who was close to God, who believed enough in the power of prayer to beg God, to strengthen the people he loved in the inner man.
[time=1883] Paul is praying for power.
[time=1886] Paul is pleading with the true and living God to communicate divine strength and power through the Holy Spirit into the inner man of the folks that he loves at Ephesus.
[time=1895] And my goal this morning is to explain this prayer to you.
[time=1899] I wanna walk through this prayer, verse by verse.
[time=1902] I want you to understand it because my hope is that it will build conviction in your heart to either pray for yourself or to pray for your loved ones or to pray for our church or to pray for whoever's on your heart in the pattern and with the conviction and the hope and the expectation that fills the heart of Paul.
[time=1920] It begins in verse 14.
[time=1922] He says in verse 14, "For this reason I bow my knees before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name." You and I know that there is no one prescribed posture for prayer.
[time=1936] The Bible does not say you have to be on your knees.
[time=1939] Abraham was standing before the Lord while interceding for the people of Sodom and Gomorrah.
[time=1944] David sat before the Lord while praying about the prospect of building the temple.
[time=1949] Jesus fell on his face and prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane.
[time=1954] Lots of postures.
[time=1956] The one that's being assumed here by the Apostle Paul is that of dropping to his knees.
[time=1961] It's a position that at least visually represents a tremendous sense of vulnerability and dependence on the true and living God.
[time=1968] It's a posture that if reflecting the true longing of your heart, God, I am desperately in need of what only you can provide.
[time=1978] It's as if to say on my knees down here, Lord, I have stopped trying to solve this problem, not stopped caring, not stopped hurting, not stopped desiring for change, but I've stopped trying.
[time=1989] I'm at my wits in here, Lord.
[time=1991] This is bigger than I am.
[time=1994] I need your help.
[time=1996] If this is ever gonna happen, it's gonna be because you showed up.
[time=1999] It's a very common posture of prayer.
[time=2004] Ezra, who had the unenviable responsibility of leading the Israelites home from their captivity in Babylon.
[time=2013] They had been there for a great number of years under the discipline and chasing hand of God for hundreds and thousands of years prior to that, they had spurned his divine intention to use them as a missionary nation to reach the other nations of the world.
[time=2027] And they had no heart for God and no commitment to his heart for the other nations.
[time=2032] So finally, in desperation, God sends them to captivity.
[time=2036] They stayed there a long time.
[time=2038] Ezra leads them back into the Holy Land where God hopes to resume his divine program using them to reach the lost.
[time=2044] And they are not in the land, but a short time before they again violate one of the cardinal rules that God established for them.
[time=2052] Do not intermarry with the pagans.
[time=2056] Do not intermarry with the pagans for when you marry a woman or a man who does not worship the true and living God, your affection for them will eventually bleed your affection for me and you'll begin to worship the false gods of the world.
[time=2069] Back in the promised land for only a short time, intermarrying and Ezra, their leader, cries out in verse five of chapter nine, I'll read it to you, Ezra nine, five.
[time=2079] But at the evening offering, I arose from my humiliation.
[time=2082] Even with my garment and my robe torn, I fell on my knees and I stretched out my hands to the Lord my God.
[time=2091] And I said, oh my God, I am ashamed and embarrassed
[time=2098] to lift up my face to you.
[time=2099] Our iniquities have risen over our heads and our guilt has grown even to the heavens.
[time=2108] You see, this posture of prayer is very appropriate because Ezra knows that the frail and sinful fabric which makes up the heart, the soul, the mind, the inner man of mere mortals has also quickly run back and returned to, if you will, its own vomit.
[time=2129] But so he just falls down in his knees.
[time=2132] He says, God, have mercy on us.
[time=2135] I'm embarrassed even to lift my face up to you.
[time=2138] Our iniquities have risen above our heads.
[time=2140] We're drowning in our own sin.
[time=2142] We're killing ourselves, wallowing and drowning
[time=2148] in the mire of our own iniquities.
[time=2150] You know why Daniel was on his knees three times a day?
[time=2157] Because it was his job to lead them while they were in captivity.
[time=2160] And he knew they were slow learners and he knew the repentance wasn't real and it wasn't genuine.
[time=2165] And so he got on his knees all the time before God.
[time=2167] They called him camel knees.
[time=2170] Begging, oh God, please change their hearts.
[time=2173] Oh God, please turn their hearts towards you.
[time=2175] Oh God, please strengthen them in the inner man.
[time=2177] And what you find here in the book of Ephesians is Paul.
[time=2181] Paul had done about all Paul could do for the saints at Ephesus.
[time=2185] You know, Paul had been there three years, longer than we know him being in any other place.
[time=2190] He had preached all of his best messages.
[time=2194] He taught everything he knew to teach them.
[time=2197] He went house to house.
[time=2198] He knew them name by name.
[time=2200] He trained up elders for them.
[time=2201] He established their church.
[time=2203] He left them only a short while ago.
[time=2205] And already he hears of great division that's going on inside the church between the Jew and the Gentile.
[time=2210] He hears of husbands who aren't loving their wives.
[time=2212] He hears of wives who aren't loving their husband.
[time=2214] He hears of children that aren't submitting to their parents.
[time=2216] He hears of spiritual warfare that they're losing against the forces of evil.
[time=2220] He hears of people getting drunk.
[time=2222] He hears of all this stuff.
[time=2229] So he falls on his knees.
[time=2231] As a posture of the vulnerability and the dependence that filled his heart, he said, oh God, help us, help us.
[time=2241] Look at verse 16, now you come to the heart of the prayer.
[time=2245] He prays that he, mainly God, namely God, that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with power through his spirit in the inner man.
[time=2258] To pray intelligently, I want to take just a moment and explain to you what the Bible means when it says the inner man.
[time=2263] The inner man is a broad term in the New Testament.
[time=2266] It includes everything about you and me that is not our outer man.
[time=2269] It is all about us that is not physical.
[time=2272] The outer man are our muscles, our tissues, our fluids, our organs, our body, the shell in which the real man lives.
[time=2280] The inner man is the real you.
[time=2283] Living inside this physical body, it includes your mind, your will, your character, your soul, your heart, your conscience, your capacity for faith.
[time=2292] If you were to survey in the New Testament and look for all the components, the mind, the will, the heart, the soul, the conscience, the character, the capacity, if you find all that stuff, that is all gathered together in this term, the inner man.
[time=2305] It is the real you.
[time=2307] And what Paul is saying is he's not isolating.
[time=2314] God, give them strength of will for choices.
[time=2316] He's not saying give them strength of heart to pursue you.
[time=2319] He's not saying give them strength of conscience to alarm them when they get close to out of bounds categories in their life.
[time=2326] He's just grabbing all that in one big component called the inner man and he's saying, God, strengthen that whole inner person.
[time=2333] Now the word strengthen, and this is what I like about this person so much.
[time=2337] Now listen to me, this word strengthen denotes a vast improvement over what is already there.
[time=2343] In other words, Paul is asking God for power that they already do not have.
[time=2349] He is not praying God, help them use the power they already have, it's not what he's praying.
[time=2354] He is not praying, God help them live up to their potential.
[time=2358] What he is saying is God, bring a new source of power to them and outside source of power to them, a not now possessed source of power.
[time=2367] Additional to what you've already give them, infuse them with something that they do not now possess.
[time=2373] Namely your power.
[time=2375] Now I love that because the word of God tells us that we are new creatures in Christ.
[time=2380] It tells us we have everything pertaining to life and Godless.
[time=2383] It tells us we've been given and blessed with all the spiritual blessings in the heavenly places.
[time=2387] It says that we'll never confront a temptation which we do not already have the strength to find the way of escape.
[time=2393] In other words, you know, he's already given as everything we ever needed.
[time=2396] And by that can hold us fully accountable for any failure or sin or misdeed.
[time=2402] But this prayer says now in addition to all that stuff that you already equipped us with at the point of our salvation.
[time=2410] This prayer says God give us more.
[time=2413] Bring extra stuff.
[time=2416] Bring in some more power to us.
[time=2421] The word power there is dunamas.
[time=2422] It's the word we get dynamite from.
[time=2424] It's God's power.
[time=2425] It's to infuse, to be infused with God's power, the spirit power.
[time=2432] It's an amazing thought in it.
[time=2435] You and I, by virtue of this passage, are well within our boundaries.
[time=2439] When we fall on our knees and say God, please,
[time=2445] I'm really struggling here.
[time=2447] I'm not doing well.
[time=2448] The inner man is weakening.
[time=2451] I gave some things away.
[time=2453] I need help.
[time=2456] I know you've given me everything pertaining to life and Godliness.
[time=2458] I know I'm fully and totally responsible for all of my sin, but God, please, infuse me with power that I don't have right now so that I can walk obediently.
[time=2470] You say, how do you get that power?
[time=2475] Verse 16, the agency is the Holy Spirit.
[time=2478] You and I both know that when we come to Christ, we're baptized by the Holy Spirit into the body of Christ.
[time=2484] The Holy Spirit takes residence in our physical bodies and our physical bodies actually become the temple of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2490] He resides within us.
[time=2492] And Paul knows that.
[time=2494] And so Paul is saying through the avenue or through the agency, through the wonder of what it means to be spirit and dwelt believers through that agency, oh God, communicate your power to us.
[time=2506] One more thing about verse 16 and then we'll move on.
[time=2512] And this is wonderful.
[time=2513] How much power?
[time=2515] How much power is he praying for?
[time=2516] Look at it again, verse 16.
[time=2518] That God would grant you, now here it is, according to the riches of his glory.
[time=2524] Not out of his riches, but according to his riches.
[time=2527] There's a big difference there.
[time=2529] You're in financial straits.
[time=2531] You lost your job, the economy's falling apart.
[time=2533] You got a lot of kids.
[time=2534] You got a lot of expenses.
[time=2535] People aren't getting fed.
[time=2536] The heat's getting shut off.
[time=2537] You need about 5,000 bucks to get back on your feet.
[time=2541] You know a rich man.
[time=2542] You go to the rich man.
[time=2543] You explain the situation.
[time=2544] You say to him, I need help.
[time=2546] I need about $5,000.
[time=2547] The rich man takes his checkbook out and writes you a check for $25.
[time=2551] Hands it to you and says, brother, I hope it helps.
[time=2553] That man gave you out of his riches.
[time=2556] When that check gets cast, it comes out of his riches.
[time=2559] All that stuff he's got back there, it gets out of that.
[time=2561] That's not what he's praying for.
[time=2564] He is not saying God, give us strength out of your omnipotent power.
[time=2567] He is saying God, give us strength according to.
[time=2570] You go to a different rich man.
[time=2571] You explain the situation.
[time=2573] You say, I need 5,000 bucks.
[time=2574] He sits down with his checkbook.
[time=2575] He writes you a check for $25,000.
[time=2579] He hands it to you and says, I hope this helps.
[time=2583] He gave according to his riches.
[time=2587] He gave to you in light of all that he had.
[time=2589] According to his riches, and that's how Paul is praying.
[time=2594] He's saying, oh God, grant to us according to the riches of your glory, that you would infuse the inner man through the ministry of the Holy Spirit so that we would be strong.
[time=2604] So that my dear friends here at Ephesus would be strong enough to live in obedience.
[time=2608] That basically is the prayer.
[time=2611] But you know what this passage just gets better?
[time=2616] Because he explains now why he wants that to happen so bad.
[time=2619] Look at verse 17, he says, so that.
[time=2621] See that little phrase, so that.
[time=2622] Now he's gonna tell you why he's praying that prayer.
[time=2625] And he could have answered this a million different ways so that the glory of God could be lifted up, so that the holiness of God could be put on display, so that the church and her reputation would remain pure and pristine.
[time=2636] So that the people being violated would no longer be hurt, but he doesn't, that's not in his heart.
[time=2641] Look at what's in his heart, verse 17.
[time=2642] I'm asking God to give you the strength to obey verse 17, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith, and that you being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all the saints, what is the breadth and the length and the height and the depth to know the love of Christ, which surpasses knowledge, that you might be filled up to all the fullness of God.
[time=2667] You know, he's praying this because he loves them, and he wants them to know and understand and comprehend that a new level, the degree to which Christ loves them.
[time=2676] I love that.
[time=2677] I mean, this isn't rally to the call of obedience for the sake of the church or the glory of God, and those are wonderful causes.
[time=2684] This is a guy that so loves these people, and he knows the fruit of obedience.
[time=2689] And he knows what it's like to stay in a trial for a long, long time and come out the other end and get a whole new perspective on the love of God because he stayed faithful even though it was really hard.
[time=2700] And he just wants these people to experience that same rush of experiencing the love of God.
[time=2707] It says in verse 18, "The breadth.
[time=2711] How broad is the love of Christ?" Well, it covers Jew and Gentile.
[time=2715] There is no partiality.
[time=2717] Nobody anywhere on the planet of the earth, brown, black, red, white, yellow, any color, any physical deformity, any mental disorder.
[time=2724] There's nobody on this planet who is outside the breadth of the love of Christ.
[time=2728] The length of Christ's love?
[time=2731] How long has he been loving you?
[time=2733] Ephesians 1, we saw it tells us that he had chosen us from before the foundation of the world.
[time=2738] In eternity past, God made a love covenant with you, and it's been going on since then, and it's never gonna end.
[time=2744] It's really long.
[time=2747] The height of God's love, every spiritual blessing.
[time=2751] He has stacked his love so high in your life that he has, as we've noted, given you every possible conceivable spiritual blessing, and stands with a posture now to add more in the power category.
[time=2762] What's the depth of his love?
[time=2765] Well, I don't know, but it seems like we got pulled out of a pretty deep, dark, mirey pit of sin.
[time=2772] I think Christ reached way down deep into the whole depravity thing, and picked us up out of that stuff.
[time=2782] And I think we know that you can't out-send God, and no sinner is too sinful to be reached by the penetrating love of Christ, and he'll reach down as deep as he needs to reach.
[time=2791] The point he's making here is, listen, you need staying power.
[time=2799] You need this power from God to be communicated to your inner man so that you can stay in the path of obedience long enough so that God can write chapter after chapter after your life.
[time=2812] And some chapters are hard, and some chapters are labeled confusion, and some chapters are labeled doubt, and some chapters are labeled.
[time=2819] I wouldn't have chosen it this way, and you need to keep living in obedience so that he can keep writing the chapters of your life until you finally come to that one chapter that says, oh, now I understand what he was doing.
[time=2836] Joseph.
[time=2838] Joseph is a classic example of this.
[time=2839] Joseph doesn't know why he got sold.
[time=2844] I mean, he knows his brothers are jealous, and maybe he shouldn't have shared some of the stuff about those dreams, but he doesn't think it merits him being sold down into the land of Egypt, and he has absolutely no idea.
[time=2852] He has no idea why having risen to the second in command of Potiphar's household, and he says no to this lustful woman, he has no idea why he gets thrown in prison.
[time=2861] I mean, you'd think God might reward him after that extraordinary commitment of obedience, but now he's lost and alone and forgotten in a dungeon in Egypt for a sin he didn't even commit.
[time=2872] And the very many helped through the interpretation of that dream who promised to remember them promptly forgot him, and he stayed there for a long, long time.
[time=2882] Now, what happens if along the way somewhere, Joseph says in that enormously pagan culture of Egypt, powerful and strong and successful, and giving all the credit to the Nile and all of their other false gods?
[time=2896] I mean, what happens if all alone, desperate and confused, Joseph says, I'm out of here on this obedience thing, I'm buying into this other program?
[time=2904] You know what, I don't think he'd ever come to the comprehension that he has right now in heaven.
[time=2911] Because as he stayed obedient, and as he walked down that thing, he finally then did die, but before he died, he was the second most powerful man in the world.
[time=2921] He wore the Pharaoh's signet, he rode in the Pharaoh's chariot, and he had total control over the entire land of Egypt, and far more significant than that.
[time=2930] Joseph was the one man that God used to preserve the nation of Israel and bring them safely into the womb of Egypt where they could multiply to 2 million and then go do the evangelism thing.
[time=2942] I mean, he was the one guy.
[time=2944] None of his brothers had a heart for God.
[time=2946] And I'll promise you, he didn't know that when he died, but I'll bet he knows it now.
[time=2952] Then he sits up there in heaven and he basks in the bread and the length and the height and the depth of Christ for him.
[time=2963] That Christ would have chosen Joseph, that one guy to be that critical link in world history.
[time=2971] You don't think he basks in the love of Christ?
[time=2974] That's why Paul says so that, listen, you gotta pray for strength, you gotta stay strong, you gotta have a strong inner man, you gotta walk the path, you gotta stay obedient to God's calling.
[time=2984] Because yeah, if you bail out, you get to learn about the forgiving grace of God again, and you get to learn about his unconditional love, and he always forgives you, and you cannot send the grace of God.
[time=2993] You can learn and relearn that level of love from Christ over and over again, but he's saying there's another plateau out there of experiencing the love of Christ.
[time=3001] And it's on the other end of a long obedience.
[time=3004] So pray and pray like crazy.
[time=3008] But God will give you the strength to get there.
[time=3011] Because the rewards and the riches of that level of relationship with Christ, well, they explode him into the doxology.
[time=3021] Look at verse 20, he gets this running in his mind and he can't hold on anymore.
[time=3025] He's like, okay, here I go.
[time=3027] Now to him who is able to do exceeding abundantly beyond all that we ask or think according to the power that works within us, to him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever, amen.
[time=3044] I hope you get his heart here.
[time=3046] I hope you get the sense that when he really begins to understand the way that God, I think at this point, you guys, he stopped thinking about the folks at Ephesus and he started thinking about that path of obedience in his own life, and he's in prison right now, and he's been in prison before, and he doesn't know where he's heading, but he's totally convinced that God will continue to apply the strength of his life to allow him to finish his course and new levels of understanding the love of Christ are just around the corner, and so he explodes.
[time=3077] I mean, think of Jesus.
[time=3081] Now this is impossible, it could never have happened because Jesus is God and God is never even tempted by sin, but in a moment's time here, hypothetically, what would have happened if it's somewhere along the line of Jesus' life, somewhere about the Garden of Gethsemane when the cross and bearing all the sins of all humanity began to cause blood that come out of his pores instead of sweat, what happens if about right there, Jesus says, I'm not up for this obedience anymore, I'm out of here.
[time=3108] No resurrection, no Easter morning, no glorious,
[time=3115] splendid moment when Jesus comes up out of that tomb, and here's all those angels singing, and realizes that he just did it, he was just the atoning lamb and begins to see God exalt him and his name above every name, and everybody kneels, and everybody bows for all of eternity, and Christ can then offer that, I mean, he would never have known the extent and the dimension of the love of God as it was expressed through the resurrection and his ascension and his exaltation, and you go to Revelation chapter five and you hear the song of the elders and you see the bulls of incense being thrown and praise and worthiness to the lamb, never does he get to experience all that stuff if he bails, if he bails on the long obedience.
[time=3155] That's exactly what Paul is saying, that's why he's praying this prayer, he says, I want my beloved saints at Ephesus to know the other side of this thing, the kind of experience of God's love that you only get on the other side of obedience.
[time=3170] Listen to the progression in verse 20 and 21,
[time=3176] he is able, he is able to do
[time=3182] he is able to do exceeding abundantly.
[time=3185] He is able to do exceeding abundantly beyond all that we ask.
[time=3198] You see it building, he just begins this doxology of praise.
[time=3204] Long obedience in the same direction grants the privilege of seeing your heavenly father do exceeding abundantly beyond all that you could ever ask or think, so pray.
[time=3216] Pray for me, pray for you, pray for your loveless.
[time=3221] What do I pray?
[time=3224] Pray for strength, God's strength, a new strength, a strength that the person doesn't currently have to be infused into their heart and life through the ministry of the Holy Spirit.
[time=3238] Wilbur Chapman, an old evangelist, told of the testimony given by a certain man in one of his meetings.
[time=3245] The man said this, I got off at the Pennsylvania Depot as a cramp and for a year I begged on the streets for a living.
[time=3255] One day I touched a man on the shoulder and said, hey, mister, can you give me a dime?
[time=3262] As soon as I saw his face I was shocked to see that it was my own father.
[time=3267] I said, father, father, do you know me?
[time=3270] Throwing his arms around me and with tears in his eyes he said, oh my son, at last I have found you.
[time=3278] I have found you, you want a dime?
[time=3281] Everything I have is yours.
[time=3284] The man went on to say, think of it, I was a tramp.
[time=3288] I stood begging my own father for 10 cents when for 18 years he had been looking for me to give me all that he had.
[time=3298] You know, I don't know who you're begging off of today.
[time=3301] I don't know what broken sister and you're trying to drink from.
[time=3308] I don't know what source of pseudo-life you're pursuing.
[time=3312] I don't know how impoverished your inner man is, but I know one thing.
[time=3319] Your father stands prepared this morning to give you everything he has.
[time=3327] And he's been looking for you, he's been looking for you.
[time=3330] Not to scold you, not to discipline, not to beat you up, not to tell you how worthless you are.
[time=3336] He's been looking for you to help you, to be strengthened in the inner man, to know the long path of obedience so you can experience a kind of love with Christ.
[time=3349] That is experienced only by the obedient.
[time=3356] But just stand with me for a closing word of prayer.
[time=3359] You know, it's great to have you here this morning.
[time=3363] I have wonderful news from last week.
[time=3366] Kind of at the last moment thing there in the service, we gave you an opportunity to give you know, in a retiring offering to Dick and Barb Kelly, really to the Slavic Gospel Association and through them to prisoners who are in Russia who don't know Christ.
[time=3381] And I was just so amazed when I got the report on Monday or so that you all gave $5,000 with no advance notice, only about a 10 minute little deal.
[time=3392] And there you go out the door, given all that money.
[time=3396] And somebody in our church had already given $5,000 to that very project.
[time=3401] And so Dick has the money and he's I think soon to be on his way, the prisoners are obviously waiting.
[time=3408] They can't go anywhere.
[time=3409] And you know what, our guys are gonna go there and they're gonna give the gospel.
[time=3414] And then they're gonna give them gifts and then they're gonna give gifts to their kids.
[time=3417] And then they're gonna say this is because of Christ.
[time=3420] And your holiday joy isn't over yet, okay?
[time=3424] It's what I'm trying to tell you.
[time=3425] The gifts you've been given, they're gonna get distributed in this next month.
[time=3428] And I'll look forward to giving you reports.
[time=3430] But for now, let me just commend you and thank you and honor you for the sacrificial giving that you did last week for those folks.
[time=3437] Let's pray together.
[time=3438] Our Heavenly Father, we stand before you today.
[time=3442] Many of us, many of us, many people here know that the inner man has been weakening and they're seeing telltale signs and they're small right now, but the snowball builds in a hurry.
[time=3455] And we pray that you would stop them in their tracks with this message of love and hope even this morning.
[time=3463] And we pray God for those who have already gotten to the bottom of that hill and have really done some damage that they would again see you pursuing them, searching for them, looking to give the strength that they need to recover.
[time=3476] And for those who may be strong this morning, for those who sense your power and who are walking in the spirit.
[time=3482] Nah, man, pride comes before a fall.
[time=3486] And might we even be called back afresh and anew to the kinds of prayer, the kinds of postures of dependence and vulnerability, begging you to continue to strengthen us in the inner man.
[time=3496] We do pray it for your glory and for your honor.
[time=3498] We pray it in the name of your blessed son, Jesus Christ.
[time=3502] And all that's people said.
[time=3504] Amen, God bless you.
