[time=30] Being diligent to preserve the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace.
[time=50] This passage is a call for unity.
[time=52] It's a call for unity in the church.
[time=56] It's a call for unity anywhere there are a community of believers who name the name of Christ.
[time=69] This is the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=73] Thank you for joining us.
[time=75] Today Pastor Moore continues his study of Ephesians with a look at unity in the body of Christ.
[time=80] Please stay tuned as he shares with us about walking to the beat of a different drummer.
[time=85] Now let's join our service.
[time=93] Sometimes I forget, sometimes I can't see.
[time=120] Whatever comes my way will be with me.
[time=129] My life is in your hands, my heart is in your feet, I'm never without hope, that way my future is with you.
[time=147] My life is in your hands, and though I may not see clearly, I will lift my voice and sing.
[time=162] 'Cause your love draws amazing things, Lord I know my life is in your hands.
[time=180] Nothing is for sure, nothing is for keeps.
[time=190] All I know is that your love will live eternally.
[time=199] Sometimes I forget, sometimes I can't see, that whatever comes my way will be with me.
[time=217] My life is in your hands, my heart is in your feet, I'm never without hope, not when my future is with you.
[time=235] My life is in your hands, and though I may not see clearly, I will lift my voice and sing.
[time=249] 'Cause your love draws amazing things, Lord I know my life is in your hands.
[time=262] Oh, when I met my weakest, Lord, you buried me.
[time=272] So I'll become my strongest, Lord, in your hands.
[time=292] My life is in your hands, and though I may not see clearly, I will lift my voice and sing.
[time=313] 'Cause your love draws amazing things, Lord I know my life is in your hands.
[time=327] I trust your love, my life is in your hands.
[time=357] All I had to give was a broken heart, torn apart.
[time=379] All I had to give was an empty hope and promises, but in return you gave me joy, that could never be torn.
[time=394] And in return you gave me love, that was more precious than gold, so whatever you have to give, you don't have to be ashamed.
[time=410] Just come as you are, and present Jesus' name for in return of a torn life, will give you life for finally, and in return of a raging storm.
[time=431] A Lord will come to see, so whatever you have, the Lord has so much more, so what do you have to give?
[time=451] Oh, if you were like me, you didn't have a lot of gold.
[time=460] The position of my knee, you didn't know what I've been told, but I'm glad you didn't look on the things that I had, but you looked on the things you were able to give me.
[time=483] Oh, for in return he'll give you joy, that could never be torn, and in return he'll give you love, that was more precious than gold, and in return for a torn life, he'll give you life for finally, and in return of a raging storm.
[time=512] A Lord will come to see, so what do you have to give?
[time=542] Thank you, Jenny, and what a great, great truth is bound up in that song.
[time=567] Let me invite you to come with me in your Bible to Ephesians, Ephesians chapter 4, and if you're new this morning with us, or if you haven't been with us for a while, you'll be helped by knowing that we're studying the book of Ephesians.
[time=581] We're just going through it passage by passage and chapter by chapter, and we're at a place in this book, chapter 4, and the passage will be verses 1 through 6.
[time=593] Let me jump to what I think is the heart of the passage before I kind of go back and deal with each verse, and it's found in verse 3, chapter 4, verse 3, it says this.
[time=603] Being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
[time=609] This passage is about unity, it's about experiencing unity, it's about the importance of unity, it establishes why we can have unity, and how we can have unity.
[time=620] And it comes at a remarkable point in the development of this particular book.
[time=624] We're at a transition point in the book, and Paul is going to leave what he has been doing in chapters 1, 2, and 3, and he's going to take up a completely different reality or focus in chapters 4, 5, and 6, and so we're right there at the transition point.
[time=641] Here to 4, in chapters 1, 2, and 3, Paul has been describing for us the wonderful reality of getting saved.
[time=649] He's been taking us into the spiritual arena of what does it mean to truly be born again?
[time=655] What happens when somebody comes to Christ?
[time=657] What happens spiritually when a person accepts Christ as their personal Lord and Savior?
[time=662] And you might remember that, you might reflect with me, go back to chapter 1 for just a minute, and remember that in verse 3, Paul said this, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ."
[time=678] And that's kind of his umbrella statement that he's going to put a whole bunch of information underneath that, and basically he's saying, "When you come to Christ, when you're born again, God gives you every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places."
[time=691] And those include verse 4, "You become holy and blameless." Verse 5, "You're adopted as His Son," verse 7, "You're redeemed out of the marketplace of sin through His blood."
[time=703] Verse 9, "You get to know the mystery of His will." Verse 11, "You have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to His purpose."
[time=712] Verse 13, "He says, 'You're sealed in Christ with the Holy Spirit." Remember, the Spirit of God performs the function of an engagement ring that God gives us in the here and now until we can realize some of these other spiritual blessings, many of which won't happen until after we're in heaven with God.
[time=730] This is one of the greatest expositions and displays of the spiritual workings that go on behind the scenes in salvation anywhere in the New Testament.
[time=740] And he caps that off in chapter 1 with this marvelous prayer, remember this prayer, where he begs God to open our eyes that we might have a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him.
[time=753] In other words, this is all that happened to you at the point of salvation, and then he drops down to his knees and begins to beg God that we would understand and comprehend it.
[time=761] It's an amazing thing.
[time=763] You come to chapter 2, and it's the same thing all over again from a slightly different perspective. This time he's going to say, "This is who you were, and this is now who you are."
[time=772] In chapter 1, excuse me, verse 1 of chapter 2, he says, "You were dead in your trespasses and sins."
[time=779] In other words, without Christ, without a personal relationship with Christ, we're dead in our trespasses and sins.
[time=786] And we walked according to those, according to the course of the prince of the power of the air, that the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience.
[time=793] In verse 3, we lived in the lusts of our flesh indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind.
[time=799] In fact, we were by nature children of wrath even as the rest.
[time=804] In other words, to put on the great display the reality of what happens to us when we come to Christ, Paul faithfully reminds us of our deplorable and hopeless condition outside of Christ.
[time=815] And then he breaks through with the news, verse 4, "But God, being rich in mercy because of his great love with which he loved us, made us," verse 5, "alive together with Christ."
[time=828] We were dead, but now we're alive in Christ.
[time=831] Verse 6, "We've been raised up with him, seated in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus."
[time=837] And then those famous, of all famous verses, chapter 2, verses 8, 9 and 10, "For by grace you have been saved through faith, it is not of yourselves, it is a gift of God, not as a result of works, lest anyone should boast."
[time=851] He's saying, "You know how you got all that stuff? You want to know how all that happens to you, that you could be given everything pertaining to life and godliness and blessed with all the spiritual blessings in the heavenly places?
[time=861] You want to know how you can go from being a dead spiritual corpse to being alive in Christ and seated in the heavenly places?
[time=868] That all happened by the grace of God, not by your works, not by your efforts, you just apprehend the person of Christ through faith.
[time=876] He's just laying out the reality of salvation just blow after blow.
[time=881] And then verse 10 in chapter 2, "We become His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works," which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in there.
[time=890] Again, we go from a dead corpse that is locked in the sphere of transgressions and sins, running around on the impulse of lusts and desires, doing the works of death.
[time=901] We go from that to being alive and made into a masterpiece that God Himself fashions so that we can do not works of death, but good works, what good works, the good works that God prepared before the foundation of the world that we should walk in them.
[time=917] He's saying, you know, welcome to salvation. It doesn't get any better than this. Then He's right.
[time=926] Then in chapter 3, he drops to his knees. Again, remember this, maybe from last week, he said, "For this reason," in verse 14, "for this reason I bow my knees from every family in heaven and on earth that drives its name," verse 16, "that God would grant you according to the riches of His glory to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner man."
[time=946] He says, you know, my first prayer was that you'd be able to comprehend what God has done for you in salvation, and my second prayer is that you would be willing to call upon God to give you the strength to experience all of it in your life.
[time=960] Now, here's what I want you to notice. This is fascinating. So far, three chapters, the book of Ephesians, and He hasn't told us to do one thing.
[time=970] There hasn't been one command. There hasn't been one exhortation. There hasn't been one law we're supposed to keep. One directive we're supposed to follow.
[time=979] It's just been one long, uninterrupted discussion and then prayer about the wonders of what God has done for us in saving us.
[time=990] But with chapter four, all that changes. He stops his discussion of what it means to be saved at the end of chapter three, and now he begins a discussion of the implications of our salvation.
[time=1003] He's saying, now let me tell you the difference that it can make between now and the time you die.
[time=1009] Let me bring it down now to the practical level of how you get to live your life based upon the reality of this awesome salvation that I've been telling you about in chapters one, two, and three.
[time=1020] And by the time he's done with this book, there's only six chapters. So by the time we get done with chapter four, five, and six, he will have given us instruction as to our words and our speech, our spiritual gifts, how to be filled with the Holy Spirit.
[time=1033] The whole issue of drunkenness, how wives are now enabled to live because of Christ, how husbands are now empowered to live because of Christ, how children are now able to live because of Christ, how fathers can father, employees can serve their masters, how masters can employ their, you know, employees.
[time=1052] And then he ends with chapter six with this great discussion of our spiritual armor and how we are now suited to do battle against the forces of wickedness that would oppress and interfere with our lives.
[time=1064] In other words, every single category of life, I mean, what is more important than that stuff?
[time=1069] He's going to deal with every single one of them and it's all filled with hope and it's all filled with vital energy from the spirit of God saying, look, your life can be different because of the reality of this great salvation.
[time=1087] Now, of all those topics, of all those topics, okay, speech, spiritual gifts, Holy Spirit, drunkenness, wives, husbands, children's, fathers, employees, employers, spiritual armor.
[time=1097] Which one do you think he starts with?
[time=1102] He starts with unity.
[time=1104] Look at it, verse three, be diligent, as I already read to you earlier today, be diligent to preserve the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace.
[time=1115] And I'm thinking to myself, well, that's a strange place to start.
[time=1120] I mean, that's kind of a strange place to start.
[time=1123] Why start there, isn't there?
[time=1125] I mean, when you get done with all this other stuff and you're now going to tell us how to live, why do you start with unity?
[time=1131] And as I was thinking that through, let me try this on you here.
[time=1135] Try this on you.
[time=1137] I'll bet you.
[time=1139] No, I don't mean I'm going to bet you, but I mean I bet you.
[time=1143] I'll bet you.
[time=1145] I can tell you whether you had a great holiday, I'm talking about Christmas and New Year's now.
[time=1151] I'll bet you, I can tell you whether you had a great holiday or a miserable holiday, and I can do it all in one word.
[time=1159] And that one word is not money.
[time=1163] And it is not presence.
[time=1166] And it is not food.
[time=1169] And it is not work or vacation.
[time=1172] It's not even health that I mean by that physical health.
[time=1175] It's none of those words.
[time=1177] It's one word and it's called unity.
[time=1181] I'll bet you, you are somewhere on the continuum between having a great, best ever holiday, miserable, worst ever holiday.
[time=1188] You're somewhere in there.
[time=1190] And what determined that for you wasn't presence and food and money and holiday and vacation and work and physical health,
[time=1197] what determined where you were on that spectrum was all bound up in what he's talking about here in this word called unity.
[time=1205] My guess is that the greatest single factor that determined whether or not you had a great or a miserable holiday was in direct proportion
[time=1212] to the level of unity or disunity that you experienced this holiday with the people that you love.
[time=1219] True?
[time=1221] We could have testimony after testimony stand up here on this stage and they will say, you know what really tore my heart out this holiday and made this holiday one of the worst I've ever experienced
[time=1234] was that my family was at each other's throats.
[time=1238] And it might have been a mother with a son or a father with a daughter or a brother with a sister or some in law, but it was there and it just cast this shadow over everything.
[time=1250] Others of you could stand up here and say, you know, I don't know that I could have articulated before we started talking like this this morning.
[time=1255] But now that you mentioned it, do you know that's really true?
[time=1258] Do you know what made this holiday better than all the other holidays?
[time=1261] I mean, you know what stuck this one out as a red letter holiday?
[time=1265] It wasn't that I was able to give more or get more. It wasn't that the food came out right.
[time=1270] Do you know what it was?
[time=1273] We loved each other.
[time=1275] I mean, we actually experienced what it means.
[time=1279] We tasted that stuff called, I love you and you love me and we're together.
[time=1286] And the stuff that I might have feared from days past didn't raise its ugly head.
[time=1292] And I'm here to tell you.
[time=1294] It's one of the greatest holidays of my life.
[time=1297] Now you just bear that out of your mind from it. You just see, you just test that.
[time=1301] And maybe that's why, maybe that's why with this whole litany of instruction he's going to give us about every major category of life.
[time=1307] He starts right here at the concept of loving one another and living together in community
[time=1314] and enjoying the greatest reality that God has to offer
[time=1320] in response to salvation, which is intimacy, true, genuine, loving.
[time=1326] Now listen, I'll bet you your holiday is a microcosm of your life.
[time=1330] Try this one on first sight.
[time=1331] If you came up in a childhood where it was full of discord and full of fractions
[time=1338] and fighting and arguments and discussion and tearing apart of your family, my guess is you look back on your childhood with kind of sadness and sorrow.
[time=1349] And you're still trying to figure out what to do with some of the scars that it left you with.
[time=1353] On the other hand, if you came up through a family that was full of harmony and unity that was committed to each other and worked their problems out in constructive ways and moved through their life with meaning and purpose that gave ever deepening sense of loving community, you look back on your childhood with a sense of sentimentalism like, man, I never had it so good. I wish I could get back there. Those were the days.
[time=1378] Well, on these lines, what happened last year? Not last holiday, but last year?
[time=1384] You know for a fact. I mean, you test this in your heart and your spirit that if relationships with the people you love were going on the skids and they were heading the direction, wrong direction, it doesn't matter.
[time=1394] If you got a promotion, if you got more money than last year, if you're healthy or physically, I mean, all that stuff somehow just finds second place to this other reality called unity.
[time=1404] Now, mark it. Listen to this. From the beginning of time, from before the beginning of time, God existed in fellowship with the Godhead.
[time=1413] God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, John One tells us, faced each other in perfect unadulterated fellowship for all of eternity past.
[time=1422] That was all they were doing was enjoying the relationship that existed between them.
[time=1428] One of the most painful statements that Jesus ever makes is, "On the cross there, my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" Because what he had experienced for all of eternity, which was perfect unity with the Father, was at that moment severed by the reality of his becoming sin to die for our sins.
[time=1446] You wonder about the pain at the cross. That's it. It's not the nails.
[time=1451] And it's not the spear. It's the reality of broken fellowship with God.
[time=1455] However, that all worked. Now, when God created you, He created you in His image. And that means a lot of things.
[time=1464] That means you can think. That means you can add numbers.
[time=1467] That means you can make choices. That means you have emotions.
[time=1470] But all of those things add up to something far more significant.
[time=1475] When God made you in His image, He made you with the same capacity for a relationship that He has.
[time=1481] He made you relational. And all those other components that make you what you are are subordinate, and they are for the purpose of a relationship.
[time=1491] Now, the Bible says that we can be reconciled to God.
[time=1495] It means that our relationship, which if left in our sin, our relationship with God is destroyed.
[time=1501] There is no relationship with God except His wrath at us.
[time=1504] And the wonder of salvation is that Jesus deals with our sin so that we can be reconciled with God
[time=1510] and the relationship comes back together.
[time=1512] The pinnacle of His experience, and the pinnacle of human experience,
[time=1518] is to experience unity, is to experience relationship.
[time=1525] And that, my friends, is what heaven is all about.
[time=1528] That's why God is there. That's why we are there with God.
[time=1532] That's why the city has been built. That is why there will be a new heaven and a new earth.
[time=1536] That will be, if you will, the playground, the backdrop in which we will enjoy God and enjoy each other
[time=1544] perfectly for all of eternity.
[time=1548] That's where this whole thing goes.
[time=1552] So what is Paul saying to us this morning? He is saying this.
[time=1556] Now that we're done talking about salvation, when it comes down to you getting to live the blessings of salvation,
[time=1563] the first of which, the greatest of which is you get to, you get to strive after and taste
[time=1573] what it is God created you to have in the first place.
[time=1578] Loving, meaningful relationships of integrity.
[time=1583] And I think that's why He starts here.
[time=1587] Jesus in the upper room in John 13, right? He's preparing the guys. He's going to go. He's going to leave the crucifixion,
[time=1593] the death, the burial, the ascension. He's not going to be around anymore.
[time=1597] And He's given His guys final marching instructions. And He says up there in the upper room after He had girded Himself with that cloth and washed their feet and served them and that way He says this to them, "By this all men will know that you are my disciples."
[time=1611] What, how does He finish that? Does He say everybody's going to know your my disciples because you'll carry around a big Bible?
[time=1618] Well does everybody know your my disciples because you joined a church?
[time=1622] Well everybody know your my disciples because you don't cuss and you don't drink and you don't smoke and you don't do all these things.
[time=1627] Is that what it all is? This will know that you are my disciples if you what?
[time=1633] If you love one another.
[time=1637] He says against the backdrop of a world that is dead in their sins and their trespasses and that is getting driven around by their lusts and their passions and their desires which inevitably caused them to crash into each other at every turn and there's discord and friction and faction and hurt and pain.
[time=1651] In the midst of a world like that you guys will be able to love each other and that love will tell them unmistakably that you belong to me
[time=1663] because that is one of the characteristics that defines me above all other.
[time=1669] I am a lover. God says I am a lover and I love relationship
[time=1676] and when you begin to experience and taste it you inevitably put it on display to a lost and dying world
[time=1682] and they begin to have a sense oh you you you must be from God.
[time=1688] You must be connected to God. This must be what God is doing in your life.
[time=1693] And you know and I know that all the efforts of man to find unity all the laws that we've passed all the conferences that we've held all the treaties that we've signed all the accords that have been moved towards all the agreements that have been you know purposed none of those are able to create true unity that only comes as a result of salvation through Christ
[time=1715] the radical transformations that occur. He is the only way to taste that stuff.
[time=1722] Now it is not automatic and you and I already know that.
[time=1728] It is not oh boy I came to Christ and now every relationship in my life is perfect.
[time=1732] Oh boy I came to Christ and now my relationship with my mom and dad works and my relationship with my wife works and my relationship with my kids work and my relationship with my friends work it's not that way it's not automatic it doesn't just happen and he says that in verse three look at it again he says be diligent be diligent to preserve the unity of the spirit and the bond of peace.
[time=1753] The word diligent means to make haste means to have great zeal.
[time=1758] It means to give and expend yourself with an urgency that this above all else will be held on to what is that our unity.
[time=1770] And the question of course then is well how do I do that?
[time=1774] How do I make haste after unity? How do I give myself to pursue unity and that is the very question that he answers in verse two.
[time=1782] In verse two he delineates four components of unity. In verse two it's like if you're making the cake called unity he's got four ingredients that got to go into the recipe and you know me better than to say that you know this is a recipe I don't believe in cause and effect things but these are the things that if you and I pursue the Holy Spirit through Paul tells us what we're going to taste on the other end of this thing we're going to be surprised by this reality called unity.
[time=1810] Let's go to verse one and find our way to verse two. Verse one says this I therefore the prisoner of the Lord entreat you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called.
[time=1822] You see that's the transition verse. He's saying I've been telling you all about what it means to be saved but now in verse one he says I therefore based on all I've said I want you now to work at walking in a manner that is commensurate with all the stuff I've done inside of you by virtue of salvation it's now your chance to live differently walk is like the pattern of your life. It's now time for you to experience the practical implications of what it means to be saved. Now verse two and here come these four components with all one humility two gentleness three patience and four showing forbearance to one another in love and I just want to try to explain these words to you and help you see them work in your life. Number one is humility Now the people who lived in this era the Romans and the Greeks did not even have this word in their vocabulary this word was coined by Christians and we suspect invented by Paul himself under the ministry of the Holy Spirit. This word did not exist in the cultural day in the everyday vocabulary in the dictionaries of the day this was non-existent word.
[time=1890] All the Romans and the Greeks could think of when they came across this notion their notion of humility was cowardice it was an ignoble thought. In fact they put a premium on pride and arrogance and they lifted up pride as a virtue to be confident and self-asserting and independent that to them was a virtue and it's not totally uncommon to our day you say the word humility to many people on the street today and they do not understand what you and I understand what the Bible teaches they see it as this kind of this broken self-deprecating hunched over person who just thinks too poorly of themselves you say humility to them they don't get it and you talk to them about what really makes it and they say no you got to be strong you got to be self-asserting you got to be independent you got to be on your own you got to be autonomous but what does this word mean it's a compound word and it means this think lowly it means to think lowly about yourself think lowly about yourself I want to be careful here because there is no room in the word of God and you are nowhere instructed in the word of God to think lower of yourself than you ought to think there is no virtue or piety or spiritual growth in beating yourself up and I know that many of us here today struggle with this you can you can you can read yourself the riot act better than anybody and you can tell yourself mean things about yourself better than anybody and when you're done you're an emotional little thing on the floor because you've done such an effective job of beating yourself up as you tell yourself all the things that you ought to be that you aren't and all the things that you and that's not what this is this is not thinking more lowly about yourself than you should on the other hand it is not thinking more highly about yourself than you should it's not puffing yourself up true humility now listen to this is dependence upon God true humility is when you put yourself under God and you are submissive to him you and I made in the image of God we have been given abilities we have been given talents and those lead us to have possessions and education and social status and appearance and we have power in our being because we were made like God in many many ways and all those things are good all of those things are God given all of those things should be acknowledged and enjoyed but here's where pride comes in it's when you and I allow those God given gifts whether natural talents or physical things that we possess to lead us to a to an arrogance and an independence from God where we get out from underneath him and there is then a lack of submission the first and all the Bible the first and all the Bible was the sin of pride it was committed by Lucifer in Isaiah 14 and this is what he did Lucifer was the greatest the most splendorous of all the created creatures of all the created angels Lucifer got like the major stuff in terms of gifts and beauty and talent and ability and instead of gratefully receiving those things from God he got up on himself and he eventually said I am a God instead of saying everything that I have came from God and I am under God and I will submit to God and I will honor God as my creator he in his moment of pride and arrogance did this I am like God I am equal to God I will run my own show I will make the decisions that normally God would make that is the absence of humility that is the reality of pride Adam and Eve are the first humans that ever sinned and God blessed them God gave them enormous talents they were the first beings they were perfect they were sinless they were gorgeous they were everything you could ever want to be as a human being God blessed them richly and the temptation that Satan brought to them was the same one he fell with he said to them you will be like God instead of being underneath God if you'll just eat of that tree you can be like him you can be independent you can be on your own you can make your own decisions about good and evil pride pride is the stuff that rises
[time=2157] up inside of us now listen to this this is where unity is destroyed unity is destroyed because people lose their sense of dependence and submission to God and they start saying this I want this I want to do it this way I have been suffering too long I choose not to I will not put up with that I will not continue you cannot do that to me unity is destroyed because people lose their sense of dependence and submission upon God humility is this position instead of saying I I I humility is this everything that I am and everything that I have has come from the hand of a benevolent God and the fact that even at this moment I can stand here and take the next breath which is yet another of his marvelous gifts I am totally dependent upon God for life and breath therefore I will serve him everything that comes to me in my life every situation every hardship every blessing everything that comes my way will come to my way with the strong understanding that I am the creature and he is the creator the very breath that I take is from him I am completely dependent upon him and I'm going to stay right underneath him and any time somebody says no more of God no more of his leadership no more of his direction I'm going to do it over here I'm going to do it my way I'm going to do it this way and that's contrary to his direction you are dealing with a proud arrogant heart that has lost its grip on humility now let me tell you something it always destroys unity because as soon as a person moves out from underneath God's will for their life and starts satisfying their own needs and their own desires they will inevitably crash into the people around them and it might be a short term problem at a Christmas party or it might be a long term problem it might be a divorce but no matter where it is it's always the same reality as soon as the person starts pretending to be God and making those decisions they will always violate the people they love the most it happens without fail so the word of God says you want to taste unity you want to begin to experience one of the greatest blessings that God has for you as a result of your salvation interface with people in your home and in your church out of a sense of gratitude to be alive and I'm so glad that God even allows me to live and I'm thankful that God has given me this day and I will honor him with it I will spend this day right underneath God thankful and grateful that he even gives me another breath and whatever he needs me to do today however he wants me to go whatever his bidding is I'm just going to do it because I know who I am strong powerful image bearer the second one gentleness look at it in verse two with all humility and gentleness now again this word has nothing to do with weakness or timidity or cowardice to be gentle is not to be weak it is not to be it is not to be spineless it is not to be some kind of a milk toast not to be fearless backless purposeless principleless nothing alright gentleness gentleness was used to describe wild animals who were then trained and brought under control this word in its common everyday usage was used of the process of or the result rather of a wild animal that was strong and independent and wild and doing whatever it wanted to do wherever it wanted to do it and it got trained and was then brought under control you think of it in terms of a horse a big strong fast horse that's been wild all of its days and it runs the wide open range and it does what it wants when it wants and when it runs it runs at its own pleasure for its own length into its own destination and it's a strong powerful beast in the field and then you make it gentle and what you have done is you have broken that horse to the place that that horse now runs at your pleasure at your speed and to your destination but you have not diminished the strength and the spirit and the power of the beast that's exactly how God wants to see us he wants you to see yourself as this marvelously and wonderfully created thing with power and strength and ability and the power of choice and the power of movement in your life he don't want to break you and make you some weak spineless thing in all your power and all your strength but you are happily bridled by the will of God and you take and use that power for his glory and for his honor think of this in terms of a father in a home a father in a home who hopefully is humble and he says you know I know who I am and I know who God is and I know where I get all that I got I'm right under here he's a humble man but he's also gentle you know a man in a house usually the physically the strongest one in the house and the strongest voice and oftentimes not always but oftentimes the most intimidating force inside that house you let that power run out of control and you can do more damage to a wife and children than you know what to do with but you take that strong image bearing father and let him be under the control of the spirit of God and he starts to use all that stuff that God gave him to lead his family into places that honor God into decisions and life courses and involvement with people that honor God and mature those little kids and that wife you let him use that power that God has given him to confront his family in their sin not wildly and not in anger but bridled by the purposes of God and he moves into the life of his wife and his children and confronts the error of their way with the truth of God's word in gentleness that same strong powerful father bridled to admit his own failures to his family and to say you know I'm not perfect and I did blow it and I did lead us astrayer whatever that issue was about and that same father with the strength to stand up and try to lead again do you see how that promotes unity do you see how that has to be in a home or in a church whether leadership in the home or the church for a place to experience unity power that is under control bridled as it were under the directive of God think of it in terms of a mother every bit as wonderful every bit as strong every bit as marvelously created in the image of God with her own special unique feminine qualities and she says I'm under God I know who I am I refuse to use the things he has given me to try to stand independently of him I am under God and you watch that godly strong purposeful gifted woman begin to bridle herself underneath the leadership of her husband and say I really want to use my strength and my power to accomplish the leadership that you're giving our home I'm with you I'm underneath you I'm next to you I'm supporting you we're together in this you can count on my follow ship and as that just ripples out throughout the entire household as she begins to nurture her children and care for them in a way that only a mother can care and provide things in the home that only a woman can provide and you begin to see this balm of spiritualness just come over the family and unity begins to emerge because at the core of that home there's a strong man and a strong woman who are humbled before God and bridled under his purposes and you give children a chance to live they get to taste heaven before they ever get there because they get to experience it underneath your leadership and they want to come to Christ they want to come to Christ not out of some great fear of hell and their own sin they want to come to Christ because they have seen the power of Christ produce something in their home that is more valuable to them than anything can your neighbors see it and your unsaved friends see it
[time=2701] your house is endowed with peace well the third quality there verse two with all humility and then gentleness and now this word patience patience means long-tempered long-suffering and it implies the reality that we all live with in our relationships
[time=2725] and that is that they don't always go as scheduled we get hurt and we get violated and sometimes that can stay for a long long time and some of you listening to this message today recognize that the very dynamics which are being described not only are not happening in your house but people are turning on you and inflicting belligerent blows against you and you are saying are you nuts I'm supposed to walk with humility and gentleness in the midst of this hostile treatment and I just want to I want to be gentle and I want to be very careful here because I have never been the object of that kind of treatment that many of you have but the word of God says unity is still pursued even though everybody else around you is thrown in your face it's the ability to stay humble patience is the ability to stay humble and gentle for a long long time no vindictiveness you continue to purge your soul of vengeance you continue to allow the spirit of God to wash you clean and you and you maintain the ability to pursue love in the face of mistreatment for a long long time and I don't know how hard it is but some of you do the best imagery I comes to my mind and because Paul's throwing these animal metaphors around the one that comes to my mind is of a well-trained dog a well-trained dog and the master puts the dog down the master says down and the dog goes down as commanded and that was a feat in itself but this dog is so well trained that the master now can engage himself in a conversation over here with somebody else and that leads to a phone call and that leads to something else and now it's been a long long time and that dog has not heard from his master and that dog has not been reinforced directly in that command by his master and then a cat runs by and the dog begins to shake you know with the sense of I ought to be running after that cat but the dog stays right there in his spot he was put down and he stayed down now you've got to admit that fires you up doesn't it that's a dog that's the kind of dog you'd like to have now without the demeaning notion of being an animal that's what God's looking for and there's integrity there isn't there
[time=2879] there's intrinsic value in that the ability to continue to pursue love in the face of mistreatment for a long long time and stay on post and stay in your position and say God put me here God set me right here and I'm not deviating until I hear the next command and I can see the temptations and I can quiver with the notion that there's another way I might like to live but I'm here and I'm staying here because this is where God put me now I hope you feel the dignity that God builds in to that life because it is remarkably similar to the life of your Lord who was tempted over and over again and had the power at his disposal to extricate himself from the long difficult path of obedience all the way to the cross but never did and said life is but a vapor long patience now is a vapor in light of eternity powerful concepts aren't they I mean they're just enormous things that invade our minds and our hearts and our lives and we're inspired to be like them and we want to be called to be these kinds of people the last one here the fourth one at the end of verse 2 is called forbearance forbearance to one another in love the first way I know to describe this word to you is that it's like a blanket it's the blanket of love that we throw over other people's sins it's the blanket forbearance is the blanket of love that we throw over another sin to cover their sin rather than to berate them for it to throw it in their face and to use it against them in an angry divisive way now you and I know first of all first Peter 4 8 says love covers a multitude of sins love covers a multitude of sins you and I know that the word of God does not want us to have relationships where we never deal with our problems where somebody violates you and you just owe it never happened and I forgive you totally that is not a sound view of the scriptures the word of God calls us to speak the truth to one another in love the word of God calls us to work out our problems and to deal with the facts to embrace reality and to like iron sharpening iron to mature each other as we work for each other's best interest working through the conflict in our relationships that is the biblical model but having tried to do that to the best of your ability and not having it resolved in the best of ways because it always doesn't resolve in the best of ways what this is talking about is you don't keep a little list somewhere in your head of past violations and at the next one when you're really hot you just begin to read that list and throw that right back at that person's face for parents doesn't do that and you will never know unity if you keep that list you will never know the fruit of unity if you keep that list in your heart and if you let it out of your mouth as you have occasion forbearance is the stuff that throws a blanket over that you tried to resolve you did your best as the scriptures say so far as it depends upon you you worked for peace you couldn't get it it's blanket time at that point in your life there may be another time to resurface that and deal with that but certainly not in an angry and a vindictive way for parents refuses to exploit another sin to throw another sin in their face to keep a scorecard of previous infractions Proverbs 10, 12 says this hatred stirs up strife and you've seen it happen there's a little bit of a conflict going and then somebody whips out their list and they just start firing down all those things and they just take a big spoon and they stir your family into a place of enormous strife you know what that is that's hatred for parents doesn't do that the proverb says hatred stirs up strife but love covers all sin so there you got it you want to make a cake called unity you want to taste the sweetest thing you've ever tasted you want to taste the very thing for which God redeemed you you want to give your children a chance to taste something that they may never have anywhere but in your home humility get underneath God stay there refuse to think more highly of yourself than you ought to think and refuse to think more lowly of yourself than you ought to think gentleness bridle the enormous power that God has given you to interact with other people and use it only for his purposes in their life patience stay in your trial a long long long time stay on point and to the best of your ability throw blankets of love over infractions that you cannot resolve for the glory of God look at verse 3 we're almost done here being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit you ever wonder why he says preserve? being diligent to preserve the unity of the spirit of the Barnaby why didn't he say being diligent to create the unity of the Spirit how come he doesn't make it our project to go out there and build houses of unity how come he implies the unity is already there and it's our responsibility just to preserve it well in my Bible we got to turn the page go to verses 4 5 and 6 because the unity already is there now he's going to go back and listen to this verse four times he'll use the word one seven times in three verses he uses the word one
[time=3217] verse four there is one body when you and I come to Christ we get baptized into one body there might be many denominations and many geographical locations and ethics and race and colors and creed that come into this thing called Christians but it is one body of Christ that's all we got there's only one body and we're all in it same one verse four he says one spirit there's only one holy spirit the same holy spirit that baptized you baptized me the same holy spirit that indwells you and dwells me look at all the stuff we got going for us in terms of unity we all got baptized in the same body of Christ we all got the same holy spirit working inside of us now verse four just also you were called in one hope of your calling what's the hope of our calling we're all coming to be like Christ every single one of us is moving to the exact same destination in terms of our heart our value our characters what we think is important we are all moving to have Christ's likeness and so wherever we started out there we're all going in the same direction and it's all centered in the person of Christ we have one hope verse five one lord one lord you get mad at that person over there because they did something mean to you and you want to say to them you're nothing you're worthless you might want to remind yourself that the same Jesus that found you valuable enough to die for found them valuable enough to die for same Savior same Lord verse five one faith that doesn't mean the subjective faith by which you receive Christ that still that's the faith the doctrine once for all delivered to the saints Jude 3 we all believe the same stuff we all have the same Bible we've all committed ourselves to the same truth verse five one baptism and here's the big one verse six one God and Father of all one God and Father of all who was overall and through all and in all want to know the basis for unity you want to know why we get to try to preserve it because it's already there it's already there because it's one body one spirit one hope one lord one faith one baptism one father it's an amazing truth you know it's really tempting in that you hear this message you think about your house you got a little conflict and you start hearing these things about humility and then you know generalists and patients you all of a sudden you just get x-ray vision I mean you can see exactly how your wife blows it in all those categories I mean you can just leave just see just exactly how your husband just doesn't cut it x-ray vision perfect insight and it's so easy to say you know if that person if that other person would just and then you use that x-ray vision to change all those things that are wrong in light of these and boy we had a great day I just wish he'd change boy had a great service I just wish she'd change
[time=3383] how about this how about we do this differently how about today at lunch or some time during the day
[time=3389] if you've had some friction in your house you go to that other person and you say you know you probably got x-ray vision on me on this thing without yelling and screaming at me and I promise I will not defend myself
[time=3403] would you just tell me what you see tell me how I contribute
[time=3409] tell me how I contribute to the lack of unity in our house and then keep your word don't refute it just walk away say thank you I'll pray about that and maybe if you're lucky the other person will say well okay tell me no no that wasn't where I was going wouldn't it be great wouldn't it be great to use that stuff with the heart of love and support with the common goal of unity saying you know what it's a new year man it's 97 and nothing in our life is going to make the big difference for us not money not job not house not career nothing is going to make the big you know it's going to make the big difference for us unity how can we get there get on the same team communicate honestly
[time=3455] and pursue it well okay why don't we stand for a closing word of prayer
[time=3465] our gracious God and Heavenly Father we stand before you as a group of people that are thrilled beyond our wildest imaginations to be the recipients of salvation what you have given us in Christ we only can pray that you would help us understand because it is so vast and as we even look at the first implication of it that we would have unity together and be with us Father as a church and give us your strength and your encouragement we love you and we praise you we are thankful for your son Christ and whose name we pray and all God's people said amen God bless you In a moment I'll give you our address so you can receive a copy of lessons on assurance
