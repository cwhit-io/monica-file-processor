[time=48] This is the Sunday Morning Worship Service of Black Hawk Baptist Church. Thank you for joining us.
[time=54] If you had several things in your life that you needed to change spiritually, what would they be?
[time=59] In today's message from Ephesians, Paul isolates five areas that we should consider changing that would have positive effects in our lives.
[time=67] Stay tuned as Pastor Moore looks at seven principles to live and die by. Now let's join our service.
[time=74] [MUSIC]
[time=93] Darkness around me, sorrows around me, and though there be trials, still I can sing.
[time=116] For I am this threshold, my God reigns within me, and I am determined to live for our King.
[time=139] I am determined to be invincible, till he has been, his purpose in me.
[time=160] And I'll be shall shape me, or you'll ever go save me.
[time=170] I am determined to live for our King.
[time=183] [MUSIC]
[time=190] Hell's gates are trembling, from saints' prayers ascending, darkness is crumbling, from praises we see.
[time=211] Our sovereign bacteria is waiting before us, and we are determined to live for our King.
[time=232] Hell I am weary, I'm bound to be a space, I'm bound to be a space, I'm bound to be a space.
[time=261] To be invincible, till he has been, his purpose in me.
[time=275] I am this threshold, my God reigns within me, and I am determined to live for our King.
[time=301] [MUSIC - 19 seconds]
[time=326] We've turned the page, our new day has longed, and we've just rearranged what is right and what's wrong.
[time=337] Somehow we've drifted so far from the truth, that we can't get back home.
[time=346] And where are the virtues that once gave us life?
[time=352] And where are the morals that governed our lives?
[time=358] Someday we all will awaken all the back, and just to find what we've lost.
[time=372] We need to get back to the basics of life, a heart that is pure, and a love that is blind,
[time=384] a faith that is fervently grounded in Christ, the hope that it does for all time.
[time=396] These are the basics we need to get back to the basics of life.
[time=407] The newest craze is to reason, just meditate, and you can overcome any doubt.
[time=418] After all men is a God, they say God is no longer alive, but I still believe the old rugged cross.
[time=433] Oh, I still believe there is hope for the lost, and I know the rock of all ages will stand
[time=444] through the changes of time, through the changes of time.
[time=452] We need to get back to the basics of life, a heart that is pure,
[time=461] and a love that is blind, a faith that is fervently grounded in Christ,
[time=470] the hope that it does for all time.
[time=476] These are the basics we need to get back to the basics of life.
[time=485] And we've let the darkness evade us to hope, we gotta turn inside.
[time=497] And we need the passion that burns long and low to come and open our eyes.
[time=506] There's no room for spout of life, we need to get back to the basics of life,
[time=517] a heart that is pure, and a love that is blind.
[time=524] We need to get back to the basics of life, a heart that is pure,
[time=532] and a love that is blind, a faith that is fervently grounded in Christ,
[time=541] the hope that it does for all time.
[time=547] Oh, these are the basics we need to get back to the basics of life,
[time=554] a heart that is pure, and a love that is blind, a faith that is fervently grounded in Christ,
[time=571] the hope that it does for all time.
[time=577] Oh, these are the basics we need to get back to the basics of life,
[time=587] the basics of life, the basics of life, the basics of life.
[time=608] Well, the passage that we're studying this morning causes me to ask you a question as we get started.
[time=617] If we were going to list two or three things, in fact, if you were going to list two or three things that you'd like to change in your life these days,
[time=627] and I mean by that the last four or five weeks, what would those be?
[time=632] I mean if I could just kind of stop here for a little bit and you were to take out a piece of paper and a pen and reflect upon your spiritual condition and your walk with the Lord and situation with your family, just your life. I mean if you were just to ponder that for a little bit, would you be able to isolate a couple of two or three, four, five things that you sense are slipping in your life?
[time=653] Areas in which you feel like you're losing control, other areas where you may be letting go a little bit.
[time=661] As I reflected on that question this morning early in my office, I wrote down a couple of things.
[time=666] The first was self-discipline. A lot of the people that I've talked to recently are feeling the brunt of our weather
[time=672] and are losing momentum internally and feeling a little depressed and I'm in that group
[time=678] and not working out physically like I normally do, gaining a few pounds.
[time=682] A buddy kind of mentioned a thing to me the night, like when was the last time you worked out and he was looking down, you know, not in my eyes. I think I'm carrying a couple extra today that I wasn't last month.
[time=694] The second thing I wrote down was just a sense of selfishness. I'm kind of sensing in me.
[time=699] I'm waiting to see if someone else will get the phone more than I normally do,
[time=705] waiting to see if someone else, namely my wife, will go pick up the kids so I don't have to, waiting, you know, to see if somebody else will meet that need and if they don't, yes, sure, I'll get on over there and do that.
[time=717] The third area I wrote down were priorities. You know how important it is to major on the majors, minor on the minors.
[time=722] You don't have enough time to do everything you're supposed to do. It's pretty important to figure out, you know, okay, in the limited time I have, what am I supposed to be giving myself to?
[time=729] I'm finding that slipping a little bit, having trouble kind of going after the really important things.
[time=734] In fact, sometimes intentionally losing time, doing things that really aren't the majors at all.
[time=741] A little bit like the paint on your car, it never asks permission to oxidize, it just does, all on its own.
[time=747] The weeds that find their way into our garden, they don't usually ask permission, you don't plant them,
[time=754] they just spring up and there they are, and they begin to take root, they begin to grow, they seem sometimes to have a life of their own, and they take a concerted effort to kind of pull them out
[time=765] and get back to where you want to be.
[time=768] In the passage that I want us to look at this morning, Paul isolates five areas, and they seem almost randomly selected.
[time=777] And he wants to invite us this morning to exchange vice for virtue in about five specific categories.
[time=785] What I like about the passage this morning is that he is not scolding us, he is not going to give us a verbal tongue
[time=791] lashing instead, he is going to reason with us, he is going to make an invitation to live by exchanging vice for virtue.
[time=801] I invite you to come to that passage, it's in Ephesians chapter four, and as you're turning there, let me remind you of what Paul has been doing as we have studied this book in the last several months.
[time=811] Paul began back in the Ephesians chapter one by getting straight the reality of what it means to be saved.
[time=818] He said that when you got saved, God made a decision to bless you with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places.
[time=824] He meant by that he made you holy and blameless, he adopted you as one of his children, he redeemed you from the marketplace of sin.
[time=831] He gave you understanding into the mystery of his will where we are no longer truly and profoundly confused about who God is
[time=837] and what he's doing in this world, and how this world will eventually end up.
[time=842] He gave us an inheritance which is far beyond our wildest imagination, which we will enjoy forever in eternity.
[time=847] He sealed us by his Holy Spirit.
[time=850] In chapter two, he clarified that that salvation is not something that we work to achieve or earn in our own merit.
[time=856] It is instead something that God gives us, unmerited favor, the grace of God, and we embrace Christ through faith.
[time=864] We take a hold of the death and the resurrection and the life of Jesus Christ through faith and we say if I'm ever to know God, if I'm ever to be in heaven, if I'm ever to have those spiritual blessings, it is simply and totally and exclusively because Jesus Christ purchased them for me in his death.
[time=881] And I believe that and I have accepted Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior.
[time=887] In chapter four, he turns a corner and he says, "Having clarified what salvation brings to you in chapter one,
[time=893] having clarified how you get saved in chapter two and chapter three, I want now in chapter four to turn the corner and begin to describe the changes that knowing Christ can make in your life on a day-to-day basis."
[time=905] It's called Transformation, Metamorphis, the growing into the reality of what God has made you spiritually in Christ.
[time=914] And he works his way into this thing and we've noted in the last couple of weeks, chapter four verse 17.
[time=920] He says, "As saved as you might be, there will be the tendency, there will be the option, there will be the propensity to walk like you used to walk before you were saved." It's called the walk of the Gentile.
[time=933] It starts in the futility of our minds verse 17, darkened in our understanding and the ignorance.
[time=938] We begin to believe things that aren't true, we go back and we change our mind about certain things about God and about His Word and about our lives
[time=945] and about our priorities and about the things that are really valuable to us.
[time=948] You start lying to ourselves and that seeps its way into the hardness of the heart and we become callous.
[time=954] And what that means is we become able to hurt people in our lives and no longer feel appropriate levels of guilt and shame for our behavior
[time=964] and the way we impact people.
[time=965] It's called the hardening of the heart and the callousing of our feelings as they ought to really convict us.
[time=972] But no, we're hardening, see?
[time=974] That opens us up in verse 19 to a commitment to live to satisfy our appetites.
[time=980] Sensuality doesn't have to mean sex, it can mean any commitment that you have in your heart to gratify yourself over principled God-honoring life.
[time=990] It says at the end of verse 19 that impurity comes with greediness.
[time=994] The moment we enter the arena of satisfying our wants and desires, we find that they are never satisfied.
[time=999] And the heart of we work to satisfy them, all they do is create greater levels of dissatisfaction with life.
[time=1006] And so it's a perpetual cycle that is characterized by greediness.
[time=1010] No matter how many times I try to satisfy my wants, the harder I work to satisfy them, the more want I have within me that never seems to be able to be satisfied.
[time=1018] And he invites us no longer to walk like that.
[time=1021] He said, don't you remember, that was the old way.
[time=1023] And last week from verses 20 to 24 we talked about that.
[time=1027] There's an old way to live.
[time=1029] It's like old garments, stop putting them on, leave them alone.
[time=1033] You've taken them off, refused to put them back on again.
[time=1037] How do I do that?
[time=1038] Verse 23 by the renewing of the Spirit of my mind to continue to think accurately about life and about God and about the real choices that face me.
[time=1047] So that I can put on a new life, a life that is characteristic of righteousness and holiness in the truth, verse 24.
[time=1055] And having clarified that and gotten to this point in his argument, he now as I have said somewhat randomly isolates five areas in life.
[time=1065] And as I have said, he does not scold us.
[time=1068] He invites us to think clearly about the choices that are in front of us in these five areas.
[time=1074] And he invites us to exchange the vice that we may find ourselves in for the virtue of God.
[time=1080] Virtuous living. And I'll do my best to explain them to you and to make the choice that God would have you make as appealing as possible.
[time=1088] The first one is found in verse 25.
[time=1091] We're invited there to exchange falsehood for truth telling.
[time=1096] Therefore, laying aside falsehood, speak truth, each one of you, with his neighbor, for we are members of one another.
[time=1107] Our whole system is built on lies. You know that, I know that. Lawyers lie, teachers lie, preachers lie, salesmen lie, secretaries lie.
[time=1114] Advertisers even lie. Politicians even lie. Governments lie.
[time=1120] The whole system is built on a fabric of lies.
[time=1124] Everything about it, what would happen if for any 24-hour period everybody were compelled to tell the truth?
[time=1130] I mean, what of everybody? Every newspaper, every reporter, every politician, every doctor, every pastor, everybody always told nothing but the truth for 24 hours.
[time=1138] My prediction is our whole economy would completely collapse in that 24-hour period of time.
[time=1143] The whole thing is so supported by lies that if the truth were known about all the stuff we think is true that isn't true, things would just fall apart.
[time=1153] Lying, otherwise known as cheating in school, cheating on our income tax returns, betraying a confidence, flattery, making excuses.
[time=1166] I mean, the gazillion ways that you and I can be involved in falsehood.
[time=1174] It isn't just isolated and narrowed down to the place where somebody asks you a point-blank question and you give them a point-blank lie.
[time=1182] And we have a whole bunch of excuses as to why we feel justified in our falsehoods.
[time=1186] If I told my boss the truth, he'd blow his stack.
[time=1190] If I told my husband how I feel about his consistent traveling, he would get defensive, withdraw, and things would get worse.
[time=1198] If I told my parents how frustrated I am in school, they would be too disappointed to understand.
[time=1204] If I told my wife how sexually frustrated I am in our marriage, she would accuse me of having a one-track mind.
[time=1210] If I told my professor the real reason I didn't finish my paper on time, she would dock my grade.
[time=1216] Well, excuses notwithstanding, let me tell you what the real exchange is being offered to you this morning.
[time=1223] It is the exchange of either broken hearts versus authentic relationship.
[time=1228] Broken hearts versus authentic relationship.
[time=1231] When people submerge their true feelings in order to preserve harmony, they undermine the integrity of a relationship.
[time=1239] When people choose to buy peace on the surface, they leave submerged hurt feelings, troubling questions, and hidden hostilities,
[time=1250] which inevitably lead to inauthentic relationships.
[time=1255] When the commitment is to never say anything unsafe, to refuse to discuss misunderstandings,
[time=1263] to refuse to refill hurt feelings, to air frustrations, to ask difficult questions in time the integrity and the quality of that relationship will deteriorate.
[time=1276] The secret agendas of hurt and misunderstanding lead to detachment and distrust and bitterness.
[time=1285] And finally, feelings of love begin to die.
[time=1291] Mark my words this morning that when you choose the path of falsehood for whatever reasoning you may have in your mind,
[time=1299] whenever you buy into a false pseudo-harmony that is not built on the truth,
[time=1306] you leave just beneath the surface the kinds of hurt feelings and doubts and troubling questions
[time=1314] and hidden hostilities that will inevitably destroy the true integrity of the relationship you seek to have.
[time=1322] Just leave the misunderstandings undiscussed.
[time=1326] Just leave the hurt feelings unresolved.
[time=1330] Just refuse long enough to air the true frustrations, and in time the inevitable will set in.
[time=1337] The misunderstandings will lead to detachment, from detachment to distrust, from distrust to bitterness and from bitterness to a total absence of subjective feelings of love.
[time=1351] It will happen every time and it will happen without fail, and many of you are experiencing it this morning.
[time=1358] Now this is not a call for unbridled truth.
[time=1362] This is not a call to say whatever is in your mind at any given time, so long as it's true.
[time=1368] This is not a text that gives you permission to blurt from your heart all the pain and all the sorrow and all the brokenness and all the stuff that you have there, even though it may all really be there.
[time=1378] If you look at chapter 4, look at verse 15, but speaking the truth in love we are to grow up in all aspects into him who is the head even under Christ.
[time=1386] Truth is always to be bounded by love.
[time=1390] The truth is never to be blurted in a wholesale manner without proper understanding of the impact your words will have on the party to whom you are addressing.
[time=1398] And the guard and the grid and the commitment is always first and foremost what does it mean to truly love that other person?
[time=1409] And with that in your mind and with that in your heart then you will speak things that you might otherwise not speak and you will not say things you might otherwise would have said.
[time=1417] But you move to authentic relationships and the right stuff starts getting said with the right heart and the right commitment and the right motive and the right end in mind which is an ever deepening and ever authentic relationship.
[time=1429] That is the way that God has designed it and that is what builds us up. Again chapter 4 verse 15 you will notice that when you are speaking the truth in love you are in a position to grow in all aspects into Christ who is the head.
[time=1443] True, authentic relationships are built upon nothing less than the truth which is spoken in love.
[time=1451] But here is how it tends to work. People often one of the least articulated excuses but the one that drives the engine most often is this.
[time=1461] I will not speak the truth to my spouse or I will not speak the truth to my child or whoever is in view here.
[time=1467] And then there is another excuse that is given as a plausible reason why that would be unwise. The truth is this.
[time=1473] I will not speak the truth because if I speak the truth I am going to have to listen to the truth.
[time=1479] If I dare step into truth talking I may have to step into truth listening.
[time=1485] And if I have got a slice on this issue, if I have got an angle on how I think this thing works, I mean if I have got a perspective on how you have hurt me you can count on the fact that you have got a slice on how I have hurt you.
[time=1497] And I am pretty committed not to have to hear that stuff.
[time=1502] The things that keeps me away from telling the truth is the commitment never to have to hear the truth as you reflect it back to me as to how I might have hurt you.
[time=1512] But think about it for a minute. It is like going to the dentist. He looks inside there and he pops his head out and he says well what do you want me to tell you?
[time=1520] You want me to tell you what makes you happy? What do you want me to tell you the truth?
[time=1525] It all depends on what you value. If you value teeth, if you value eating a good meal and eating them with your own teeth, you say well why don't you go ahead and just tell me the truth.
[time=1536] And then we can get on with the painful process of correcting what is wrong. But in the end we will be better for it.
[time=1543] That's why James says to be quick to hear. You and I need to cultivate the skill of listening to the truth so that we will then be in a position to carefully speak the truth in love.
[time=1556] The great challenge that faces us is to convert the energy we typically expend to defend ourselves and to explain ourselves and to justify ourselves to convert that commitment of energy to the power of listening carefully and being vulnerable
[time=1572] and contemplating what we have heard and then changing the things in us that need to be changed, that make the exchange of truth an even more pleasant exercise next time.
[time=1585] It is a scary and a terrifying thing to speak the truth, to stop the lying that goes on, to stop the subtle compromises of truth for a pseudo kind of peace that eventually and perpetually undermines what could have been a strong, intimate, authentic relationship.
[time=1608] Because it involves listening to the truth and not just listening to the truth but changing in light of what has been said.
[time=1617] So application like point number one that comes out of this verse is this and you might write this down, I mean you might take this to heart.
[time=1624] What happens if after the service you were to find someone who loves you and someone that you love and you were to sit them down and say this?
[time=1631] If you knew that I wouldn't get defensive and angry, I mean if you knew that I wouldn't get defensive and angry and retaliatory, what hard truth would you like to tell me that you really think I need to hear?
[time=1648] Now wouldn't that be an experience? How about an entire church, 1,500 people committed to the truth, not falsehood, no more lying, seeking out people that they genuinely love and know that love them?
[time=1663] Disarming the situation by saying look, I promise, I won't get defensive, I won't become angry, I won't retaliate, I just want to honor the truth of my life today.
[time=1675] So what hard truth have you observed about me that you'd like to tell me?
[time=1680] In the process you'll be exchanging falsehood for truth telling.
[time=1686] In the process you'll be exchanging superficial relationships for authentic relationships.
[time=1692] In the process you'll be exchanging the status quo for real opportunities to grow.
[time=1699] Number two, found in verse 26. He says be angry and do not sin and do not let the sun go down on your anger and do not give the devil an opportunity.
[time=1713] Now we've headed into some really really deep waters my friends because anger is a very complex and difficult thing to discuss especially as one point in a message that only lasts like 35 or 40 minutes.
[time=1725] So I want to put a little footnote on this thing and asterisk and tell you to be very careful with what I'm about to say.
[time=1730] I'm going to do my best, I'm going to be as clear as I can, but this is a very complicated and deep and intriguing subject.
[time=1737] And if you kind of go off on one of these tangents and go too far with it, I fear for how it might be applied in your life.
[time=1743] But let me take a stab at this by saying this, this verse invites us to exchange unrighteous anger for righteous anger.
[time=1750] Unrighteous anger for righteous anger.
[time=1754] Alright, well here we go, what is, let's take a stab at trying to understand unrighteous anger.
[time=1759] Unrighteous anger might be the kind of thing talked about by our Lord in Matthew chapter 5 verse 22 when He said this,
[time=1765] "But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be guilty before the court.
[time=1769] There is a kind of anger that is clearly sin.
[time=1772] There is a kind of anger that violates the law of love.
[time=1775] There is a kind of anger that makes you guilty before the law of God and it is inappropriate and it is used to highlight our need for salvation."
[time=1783] And He goes on in that passage, Matthew chapter 5, to say this, "When you begin to become so angry that you say about someone else, rakah or you fool,
[time=1794] you have clearly crossed the line out of righteous anger and into unrighteous anger."
[time=1800] So what does it mean when you say rakah or you fool?
[time=1804] Though these are not, you know, terms we use in our like normal course of life, it communicates this.
[time=1810] "I am so angry at you that I say rakah or you fool to you which means I have devalued you.
[time=1817] I despise you.
[time=1819] I think you of little or no worth." The words rakah and you fool communicate character assassination to the core of that other person's being.
[time=1829] They say, "You are of no value.
[time=1832] What you have done hurts me so bad.
[time=1834] The way you have treated me has wounded me so deeply.
[time=1837] I now say in my heart to you, you are of no value to me or anyone else."
[time=1844] James 1.20 says that this kind of anger does not accomplish the righteousness of God.
[time=1851] An unrighteous anger is a seething, fuming, sometimes explosive resentment for the way you have been hurt, mistreated or maligned and taken advantage of.
[time=1862] The extent that you devalue the person who did the hurt.
[time=1867] Let me go a little further with this.
[time=1869] It is true that people deeply hurt us and it is legitimate to feel that pain.
[time=1874] And it is legitimate to feel the reaction to being hurt that way.
[time=1878] But the minute you push your anger or allow your anger to go to the place that you devalue or despise the person that hurts you, you have crossed the line.
[time=1888] Because let me assure you of one thing, the person who hurt you matters to God.
[time=1893] He matters to God as much as you matter to God.
[time=1896] And nothing he will ever do will keep him from mattering to God.
[time=1901] And nothing he will ever do should keep you, keep him from mattering to you.
[time=1911] Anytime anger goes to the place where you strike back and seek the wound and even the score, so to speak, on any given issue.
[time=1918] And the motive of your heart is retaliation and vengeance.
[time=1922] You have gone too far.
[time=1924] Paul never went there.
[time=1926] Paul was beaten, Paul was maligned.
[time=1929] Paul was thrown in prison.
[time=1931] Paul had people who organized themselves to oppose his work and his ministry.
[time=1936] But nowhere in the words of the New Testament do we ever find him going to a place
[time=1942] that he was so angry with people that he said you no longer matter to me and you no longer matter to God.
[time=1949] The people who opposed him most were the scribes and the Pharisees.
[time=1953] And they followed him from place to place all over Asia Minor.
[time=1956] They were versed enough in the Old Testament to cause great confusion in the churches that he had planted.
[time=1961] And he said in Romans 9 that I would not only die for these people, I would give up my salvation for them.
[time=1968] I would wish myself a cursed if they could come to Christ, speaking of his fellow countrymen, among that group of course were the scribes and the Pharisees.
[time=1979] Christ never ever went to the place that he devalued people.
[time=1986] Few people have been hurt, misunderstood, maligned, failed to be honored as much as Christ.
[time=1994] Like no one has ever been hurt like Christ has been hurt because he's the only pure, true righteous Savior.
[time=1999] And never do you find him in his heart saying about the people who hurt him, what you have done to me is of such great offense you no longer matter to me and you no longer matter to God.
[time=2009] Because even to the end he was crying out to his heavenly Father about the very ones who had put him on that cross,
[time=2016] the place where he would bear the sins of all the world, crying out saying, "Oh God, forgive them, for they know not what they do." And if you think that as a virtue peculiar only to Christ, then read Acts chapter 7 and find Stephen being like Christ
[time=2029] and looking into the eyes of those who were taking his life.
[time=2034] And he never allowed himself to go to the place that they didn't matter anymore.
[time=2038] He still had compassion, he still hurt for them, he still cared about their eternal destiny.
[time=2043] And so he, like Christ, cried out, "Oh God, forgive them, for they know not what they do."
[time=2051] When he says be angry and do not sin, he excludes the kind of anger, the places in anger that we can go
[time=2061] where the people who have hurt us no longer matter to us and no longer matter to God.
[time=2066] That means we close off feelings of compassion to them, we close off feelings of benevolence to them, we stop doing, as it says in Romans 12, to help our enemy, to feed our enemy, to clothe our enemy.
[time=2078] Why? Because they don't matter to us anymore.
[time=2082] To the best of my ability, that's probably a start on what it means to be involved in unrighteous anger.
[time=2088] Righteous anger is rare indeed.
[time=2091] If you ever experience it, you've experienced a rare feeling.
[time=2095] Because it is utterly void of self. Righteous anger is utterly void of self.
[time=2101] It may be an awareness of how you have been hurt, but it is never a defensive thing in retaliation against being hurt.
[time=2108] Righteous indignation is anger at evil, it is anger at injustice, it is anger at immorality, it is anger at ungodliness.
[time=2118] Paul became very angry with the church at Corinth for tolerating incest.
[time=2124] Somebody had his mother's, excuse me, somebody had his father's wife in a sexual way, and the church tolerated it, and the church did nothing about it, and it dishonored God, and it dishonored Christ,
[time=2135] and it dishonored the Word of God, and the ministry of that church, and Paul was angry with those people.
[time=2139] But even the perpetrator himself, Christ never, excuse me, Paul never so devalued that he didn't care about his spiritual eternity.
[time=2147] In fact, he called for the church discipline of the offending party, so that in that church discipline,
[time=2155] that offending party could come to his senses and return to Christ.
[time=2160] In 1st Timothy 1, Paul became very angry with Hymenaeus and Alexander.
[time=2164] They were false teachers, and they were undoing the truth that he had so carefully pursued and laid the foundation of godliness in that church.
[time=2172] But he never once became so angry with Hymenaeus and Alexander that he stopped caring about them,
[time=2179] that they stopped mattering to him and stopped mattering to God.
[time=2182] In fact, like the people in Corinth, he also turned Hymenaeus and Alexander over to the church discipline process,
[time=2189] and the heart of church discipline is always restoration.
[time=2191] It is never, you know, it's never, we don't care about you anymore, get out of our lives.
[time=2195] It is always, we care about you, return to Christ.
[time=2199] Psalm 97-10 says, "Hate evil, and we should." Psalm 69-9 says, "To have zeal for the house of the Lord, and we should." It is perfectly portrayed in John chapter 2.
[time=2210] Jesus goes up for the Passover, and he goes up to Jerusalem, and he finds there in the temple a very familiar scene.
[time=2216] He sees these money-changers, and these guys were people in the employ of the temple, and of course, folks were traveling from all over the Holy Land to do worship and to do worship right, but in order to do worship right, you had a certain kind of animal, and that animal had to be without blemish, and it was very difficult to transport that kind of an animal all the way to Jerusalem, and so they would come there expecting to buy the animal that they could then worship God and atone for their sins.
[time=2238] Things had gone bad, things had got sour, and the men who would sell those peculiar kinds of animals knew they were in demand,
[time=2246] and so they sold them at an extortionist rate, and they were then abusing the very people they were there to supposed to help,
[time=2254] and they were abusing the worship, and they were just bringing shame upon the temple of God.
[time=2259] Jesus got very mad. Jesus got very upset, and it wasn't a defensive anger, it wasn't a self-protective anger.
[time=2267] In fact, he quotes Psalm 69 in this passage and says, "Seal, zeal for thy house has consumed me."
[time=2274] You know what he did? He sat down in his anger, and he made a scourge.
[time=2279] If you read the text, it'll say he made a scourge. He didn't just pick one up.
[time=2283] You know, in the rush of it all. He didn't just supernaturally create one. He made one.
[time=2288] That takes time. A scourge is a whip of sorts, and it has many thongs that come out instead of just one like tail.
[time=2294] It has like six or seven or eight tails, and in those tails are traps of metal and glass and all kinds of stuff in there,
[time=2301] and you can just see the Lord in his anger sitting down and finding some leather, and beginning to wind that leather together into a grip, and then coming to the end and saying, "Okay, now where's my metal and my stuff?" And so looking over here and maybe breaking a glass and taking pieces of it and weaving it into the tail of this scourge, and then he looks and he says, "Yeah, that'll do it."
[time=2322] And then he goes off into the temple and drives all those guys out of there.
[time=2328] He was angry, but he was not self-protective in his anger. He was not vengeful.
[time=2333] He was not defending his own rights. He was defending the rights of his heavenly father in the holiness and the purity of the temple.
[time=2340] The other's a place for anger.
[time=2343] Yes, there's a place to stand up and to defend and to confront and to be animated even in the process and to have that even punctuated with great expressions of emotion, but it is never self-protective.
[time=2353] It is never to be retaliatory. It is never to even the score, and it should never be done with a devaluing heart of the person you're angry at.
[time=2361] It is instead a powerful defense of God and his word and justice and what is right.
[time=2367] And while it may be highly confunive, it is never. It never crosses the line into raka or you fool.
[time=2376] It is always done with a heart of compassion for everyone involved.
[time=2381] Told you, deep waters, difficult to understand, different, even more difficult than it is to understand is it to apply in your life.
[time=2389] But there's great caution. Look at verse 26 and 27, "Be angry and do not sin and do not let the sun go down on your anger, and do not give the devil an opportunity." Let me tell you something, my friends.
[time=2398] If you are here this morning and you are struggling with unconfessed anger and your anger is all about you and it's self-protective and it's retaliatory
[time=2405] and you feel strong impulses of vengeance and evening the score, you have given the devil an opportunity in your life.
[time=2412] And it is a powerful opportunity.
[time=2414] He has destroyed more lives than we could count simply because the individual refused to forgive an offense
[time=2422] and instead chose to nurture and cherish and cultivate and catalog an angry, vindictive heart.
[time=2429] And that is all the room he needs to destroy your life.
[time=2432] He can allow the tentacles of that unconfessed anger to find its way into every dimension of your life.
[time=2438] It's very simple, it goes like this, life is all about relationships and unforgiving angry people don't do relationships well.
[time=2446] And as a result, they don't do life well either.
[time=2450] And out of anger and out of vengeance and out of a lack of forgiveness, you can make a host of decisions that lead you down a path you never otherwise would have gone.
[time=2459] It's a hard concept to fair it out. It's a hard concept to understand.
[time=2464] But the Apostle Paul invites and encourages you to exchange this morning an angry, vindictive heart for righteous indignation,
[time=2475] which does set limits and does stand up for what is right, but is done from a heart that honors God and values people,
[time=2483] even the people who have offended you.
[time=2487] Number three, the third exchange invites you to make this morning is found in verse 28, it says this.
[time=2493] Let him who steals steal no longer, but rather let him labor, performing with his own hands what is good
[time=2499] in order that he may have something to share with him who is in need.
[time=2503] The exchange here is not stealing for work, actually it's stealing for sharing.
[time=2509] Work is just the means to get to the place where you have something to share.
[time=2514] The exchange is stealing versus sharing.
[time=2518] Now think about stealing for a moment, what is stealing?
[time=2521] Stealing is when you get to the place that you are so focused on material things, and particularly a material thing,
[time=2528] you are so convinced in your mind foolishly that that material thing is the difference between happiness and unhappiness in your life.
[time=2534] You have given your heart and your mind over to the degree that you think your life somehow, the happiness therein,
[time=2540] depends upon having that possession, but you can't buy it or don't want to buy it.
[time=2545] And you are so committed to having it that you are willing to violate the one who truly owns it and violate your own character
[time=2552] and violate your relationship with God so you can satisfy your want for that simple material thing.
[time=2560] Think of the weakness of heart, think of the distance you would have to go to get to the place where you would value a material thing,
[time=2568] whether it be a dollar bill or something that a dollar bill can buy and compromise your integrity and your relationship with God by stealing it.
[time=2583] You can steal by failing to pay a debt.
[time=2586] You can steal by falsifying your expense account.
[time=2589] You can steal by not paying fair wages to your employees.
[time=2593] These are all ways the Bible talks about stealing.
[time=2598] I mean, imagine where it would be in my life if going into Bobux, one of my favorite stores, they sell golf clubs.
[time=2607] Going in there, seeing the newest and the best and the brightest of all the golf clubs being so fixed and so focused on getting that thing into my hands
[time=2617] that I would actually steal it from the man that owns that store and have to live with the character, compromise and guilt and shame
[time=2626] every time I looked at it that I stole it.
[time=2630] Imagine being at LS heirs and looking at a beautiful piece of clothing, maybe a beautiful sweater, knowing how badly you want it,
[time=2637] knowing how little you can afford it, knowing how appropriately it might fit in the shopping bag you already happen to have with you
[time=2643] and feeling the temptation to reach and to steal.
[time=2648] The piece of jewelry, fraud on a tax return, the money on your dad's dresser,
[time=2656] whatever it is, think of how warped and how wrong it happens in the heart that would actually allow you to reach and take,
[time=2667] choosing a thing over your own integrity and the quality of your relationships with people.
[time=2673] Paul says, "Well, you could trade that in if you like." There's another way to approach life. It's found in verse 20, he says, "Let him who steals no longer, but rather let him labor.
[time=2683] Performing with his own hands, what is good?" The word labor there means to work hard. It includes manual labor.
[time=2689] It includes working to the point of exhaustion. It includes toiling and sweating.
[time=2694] He says, "Man, don't you understand, get after it. I mean, if you're healthy and you're strong and if you're able, put yourself to work.
[time=2702] Doesn't matter what it is, as long as it's honorable, put your hand to the plow." He says in the second Thessalonians chapter 3, "If you don't work, you don't eat."
[time=2713] Now imagine if that were applied in America today.
[time=2716] If you don't work, you don't eat. Think of the healing that that would bring to our culture and the people in our cities
[time=2723] and the people in our lives. If you don't eat, excuse me, if you don't work, you don't eat.
[time=2728] Now, if you can't work because of some physical disability, no problem. We'll take care of you.
[time=2734] But if you can work, you don't eat unless you do work.
[time=2738] You know what would happen? It would restore people's dignity. It would restore people's self-esteem.
[time=2744] It would allow them to really enjoy the meal they just consumed.
[time=2748] God knows that there is something intrinsically healing and strengthening in the process of work.
[time=2757] So work hard, but not to get, not to be able not to buy that material thing.
[time=2762] Work hard to be able to give, to be able to share. See it there in verse 28?
[time=2769] Don't steal, but labor, performing with your own hands what is good.
[time=2773] Why? In order that you may have something to share with him who has need. Look at the exchange that Paul invites you to this morning.
[time=2781] Trade in the me focus and the my focus and the demandingness and the delusion, the possession and things
[time=2788] and materialism to find the quality of your life. Trade that whole warp fork focus in that might even go to the place you could steal to have a possession.
[time=2796] In exchange, take up a work ethic where you find the intrinsic healing of a good long hard day that's put in for the glory of God.
[time=2805] And when you're done with that long hard day, stop by somebody's house and give them something out of the abundance of what you've received in your work.
[time=2813] Who do you think's happier on a daily basis? Who do you think's happier on a daily basis?
[time=2818] The person who wakes up so focused on material things they'd compromise their soul to get it by stealing it from somebody else?
[time=2823] Or a person who's looking for, yeah, it's another long hard day, yeah, it's another kind of maybe it's a drudgery day.
[time=2828] Maybe I'm not even well suited for the work I'm doing now, but you know what, I got a job.
[time=2832] I'm gainfully employed and I have the privilege of giving myself and the pursuit of actionless through the very best job I can and better than that,
[time=2840] when I'm finally paid, I'll find a little something extra and I'll give it to somebody who's in need, it says at the end of verse 28.
[time=2847] Maybe that person in need will be kept from stealing by my gift.
[time=2851] Maybe that gift to the person in need will be the kind of incentive to keep them going and keep them on the straight and narrow.
[time=2859] I guess that the guy that gets up and goes to work to pursue excellence and give a little of the extra is probably a lot happier
[time=2868] than the person who wrongly thinks that life is defined by material possessions.
[time=2873] Number four comes out of verse 29, it says there let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth, but only such a word as is good for edification according to the need of the moment that it may give grace to those who hear.
[time=2885] We just go ahead and need to go ahead and write my name across this verse.
[time=2889] Sometimes I can be sarcastic, sometimes I can be unthinking in my choice of words and I'm saying it to this person and I forgot this person's in the room and what I said really hurt that person.
[time=2902] The exchange here is between destructive communication and edifying communication.
[time=2908] Words that tear people down and hurt people versus words that build other people up.
[time=2914] The word unwholesome means rotten, it means worthless, it means useless, it means diseased, it was used to describe rotten vegetables and rotten fruit.
[time=2925] And what is so amazing to me is that what comes out of our mouth has the power to negatively impact other people.
[time=2933] Whether it's sarcasm or whether it's focusing on their faults and continually talking about that or whether it's giving them a defeatist attitude as you describe your opinion of them and who they are and what they're not and all they should have been and the powerfully unwholesome words that tear down and destroy.
[time=2950] By the way, this word even is broad enough to include things like off-color jokes and profanity and dirty stories and crude things and Paul says in Colossians 3 verse 8, put off filthy communication.
[time=2961] Get it out of your mouth.
[time=2966] Or he says, you can do it that way if you want to do life that way, do life that way but here's an exchange.
[time=2971] Try this, look at verse 29, try a different way of talking, allow the words to be good for edification according to the need of the moment that it may give grace to those who hear it.
[time=2986] Edification means to build somebody up and it's not talking about positive talk and it's not talking about flattery and it's not saying things that aren't true just to make them feel good for that little second and then have to live with the reality they're not as good as you made them up to be.
[time=2999] I mean these are skillful, powerful, true, genuine words that strangely enough have a genuine impact on another person's soul, another person's heart, another person's mind, another person's perspective about God.
[time=3012] You and I have been given the power to literally do significant building up in other people's lives simply by the use of our words.
[time=3023] I love that little phrase there in verse 29, you see it there, according to the need of the moment, according to the need of the moment in my opinion that implies a very insightful, thoughtful, premeditated, careful articulation of the right word at the right moment.
[time=3039] You're aware of who you're talking to, you're aware of what you're about to say, how it would impact everybody else who might hear it now or later in the future.
[time=3047] You know the person's life story, you know enough about them to know that these are appropriately powerful words to build up their soul and to give them vision, to give them hope, to give them encouragement to continue to live for God.
[time=3059] Isn't that amazing? You and I have that kind of power, that sounds like the kind of stuff only the Holy Spirit could do.
[time=3064] But the Bible says that you and I can do that to each other if we will exchange the unwholesome word for the powerfully chosen, carefully selected words of grace.
[time=3076] It's an awesome thought.
[time=3079] In Luke chapter 4 they said about Jesus, and he later kind of warned you against this, but he says in all, we're speaking well of him.
[time=3087] You know he said beware when all men speak well of you, and they didn't eventually, they just needed to get to know him a little better.
[time=3092] But in Luke 4 it says, and all we're speaking well of him and then this, and wondering at the gracious words which were falling from his lips.
[time=3101] Huh? How about that?
[time=3103] We send somebody to where you work, we ask you to leave, you know we say okay, tell us the truth.
[time=3110] What are some of the highlights? I mean what are the things that really stand out about this person to you?
[time=3114] I mean could you imagine if one of them would say you know what sometimes I drive home wondering about the gracious words that fall off her lips?
[time=3125] Could you imagine people saying that about you?
[time=3127] I mean meaning wondering, I don't get how he does it.
[time=3131] I don't get why his or her words seem to mean so much to me and make such a difference in how I view myself and my job and my boss and money and life.
[time=3143] Now I don't get it, I don't get what, man, powerful stuff comes out of her mouth.
[time=3152] And I just seem to be left feeling stronger and better.
[time=3157] Now I tell you what, that's something that you don't have as an epitaph.
[time=3160] The people I was around wondered, and how gracious words could fall from my lips.
[time=3169] Look at verse 30, it says there do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
[time=3176] Up in verse 27 the warning is not to give the devil an opportunity.
[time=3180] And kind of the inverse of that down here in verse 30 is hey don't grieve the Holy Spirit, the word grieve means to make sad.
[time=3185] Look don't make the Holy Spirit sad, God, the Trinity, they have emotions, they feel things.
[time=3191] And the Holy Spirit's going through life with you, I mean he indwells you and you go into that place and you're in that situation
[time=3197] and he's prompting you about what you could say that would really minister to another person.
[time=3202] Or you got some stupid comment in your mind and he's throwing the bells and the whistles and the fire sirens and he's saying don't say that and you run right over the top of him and say that thing anyway.
[time=3210] He goes home grieved that night.
[time=3212] I mean in a sense you know he gets back up there and they say so how to go to the Holy Spirit he says oh man it's a tough day.
[time=3218] Bummer of a day, bad day.
[time=3220] Why is that?
[time=3221] Oh I'm just really sad, why are you so sad? Well I was working with Russell and I was just, we were on a roll and all of a sudden he just went off
[time=3229] on this subject matter and the way he said it and the tone and his voice and it was just devastating.
[time=3235] And I told him all about it before he did it.
[time=3238] Oh is this a tough situation, there she was at work and it was the perfect time and the perfect moment and she'd been building up to it by her life testimony
[time=3246] and I was prompting her to go ahead and just say these words of grace she got scared and backed away, hard day today.
[time=3254] Well exchange number five is found in the last two verses of this chapter, verses 31 and 32.
[time=3262] Now this is really big.
[time=3265] Not only does he invite us to exchange falsehood for truth, unrighteous anger for righteous anger, stealing for sharing, corrupt and degrading communication
[time=3274] for uplifting communication but he gives us one last like option this morning, bitterness versus forgiveness
[time=3282] or grudge holding versus forgiveness, look at verse 31.
[time=3286] He says all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you along with all malice.
[time=3292] Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other just as God in Christ also has forgiven you.
[time=3301] Bitterness, it means grudge bearing and it's the kind of stuff that leads us to harsh opinions about other people.
[time=3307] It makes us sour and crabby when we hang on to our bitterness in our grudges.
[time=3311] It brings a scowl to our face, it infuses venom into our words and it erupts, look at it build here in verse 31.
[time=3319] The bitterness bleeds into wrath and the wrath bleeds into anger and finally it comes out on a thing called clamor which is a word that describes public outburst.
[time=3328] You're finally so angry and so bitter and so disgusted, you just fire a whole barrage of venom filled angry words at that other person.
[time=3338] And those are slanderous in nature, again verse 31, clamor then to slander and you're tearing them down and you're destroying their reputation and you're saying things that aren't true
[time=3346] or you're saying things that may be true but you have no business saying in public or anywhere else for that matter.
[time=3352] Put away from you along with all malice which is just a general word of just I wish I could hurt that person.
[time=3358] I just wish I could hurt that person.
[time=3361] I'm so bitter and so wrathful and so angry.
[time=3365] I just wish bad things could happen to that person.
[time=3368] So do you want to go through life like that?
[time=3372] Who do you want to be?
[time=3374] Well once again my friends you're going to have more than ample opportunities to become bitter and hold grudges because lots and lots of people are going to hurt you.
[time=3381] Lots and lots of people are going to hurt you.
[time=3384] People who promise they never hurt you are going to hurt you.
[time=3387] You want to hang on to bitterness and let it flow down that path or would you rather trade that in this morning for a thing called forgiveness?
[time=3393] Look at it again verse 32 and be kind to one another.
[time=3396] Tender hearted forgiving each other just as God in Christ also has forgiven you.
[time=3403] Forgiveness to release the debt to let go of the grudge to be restorative.
[time=3411] To let it start again to clean the slate to wipe it clean and so that from your heart you can actually be kind again and you say you don't understand what basis on what basis should I forgive that guy or that woman.
[time=3425] You understand how bad they are. You don't understand how they're going to continue to do that to me. You don't know how badly they've hurt agreed.
[time=3432] The basis for forgiveness is never found in the person meriting it.
[time=3438] The verse 32 forgive each other just as God in Christ has also forgiven you.
[time=3443] The only merit, the only reason, the only justification that you should continue to forgive a person that hurts you is because of the degree to which God has forgiven you for the hurt you brought on him.
[time=3454] The degree to which you and I have violated God and the way that he did and continues to forgive us, that is the grounds upon which we forgive other people who hurt us, not their merit, not the extent of their repentance, not their promises never hurt us again.
[time=3469] That is never the grounds for forgiveness in the New Testament.
[time=3473] It is always, it comes from an overwhelming sense, you know, God has forgiven me.
[time=3481] And so as you struggle with that, it's time to go back and say, "Oh God, please remind me again of fresh and anew." The extent to which you have forgiven me for my sin, remind me of how sinful I am, remind me of how much I violated you, remind me of the cost that it was for you to forgive me, so that from my heart I can give forgiveness to the person who continues to hurt me.
