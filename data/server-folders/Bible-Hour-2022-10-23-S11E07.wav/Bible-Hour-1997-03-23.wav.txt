[time=30] (music)
[time=48] This is the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=52] Thank you for joining us.
[time=53] In today's message in the series from the Book of Ephesians, Pastor Moore continues his look at God's plan for the family.
[time=60] His focus today is the role of the parents.
[time=62] Stay with us today as we look at Ephesians chapter 6, verse 4.
[time=66] Now let's join our service.
[time=68] It was a different day.
[time=71] I knew it was going to be a different day when I awoke.
[time=74] You see, I've been following Jesus for quite some time.
[time=77] I had become one of them, as some of my friends would say.
[time=81] And today was the day He was to come to Jerusalem.
[time=84] I begged my friend Thaddeus to join me.
[time=87] Now, to call Thaddeus a skeptic is sort of like calling the Dead Sea mildly salty.
[time=94] He's a lawyer.
[time=95] Who's the son of a lawyer?
[time=97] It's inbred, skepticism.
[time=99] A skepticism about everything that cannot be proved by case and evidence.
[time=104] We've been friends since we were boys.
[time=107] But since I started to follow Jesus, there came a strain on our friendship.
[time=111] It probably developed as a result of my persistent speaking of the Christ.
[time=115] He thought I was being irresponsible.
[time=118] I thought he was being a lawyer.
[time=121] Anyway, today was the day.
[time=124] Today was the day I was hopefully going to introduce Thaddeus to Jesus' teaching.
[time=129] He had heard things Christ had said many times.
[time=131] He just never heard them from his own mouth.
[time=134] "I don't understand you Thaddeus.
[time=136] Why do you have to be such a skeptic about everything?" Answer me that.
[time=139] Skepticism is healthy.
[time=141] It keeps one from looking like a fool.
[time=143] Oh, or it could reveal the fool.
[time=145] One really is.
[time=147] Senator?
[time=148] No, thank you.
[time=151] There comes a point where one has to believe what he sees.
[time=154] Otherwise, he will be a fool.
[time=156] How much proof do you need?
[time=158] Have I ever lied to you?
[time=159] Huh?
[time=160] Have I?
[time=161] Well?
[time=162] Never.
[time=163] I told you about the baby being born in Bethlehem.
[time=164] Was it true?
[time=165] Perhaps.
[time=166] You heard it from my father's own lips.
[time=169] So your father has said a number of things.
[time=171] That doesn't mean I believe them all.
[time=174] You saw how Herod was so convinced he had your baby brother put to death.
[time=179] Along with a thousand other Jewish babies.
[time=181] If he didn't believe Jesus was the Messiah, then why did he do that?
[time=185] If he is the Messiah, then why didn't he put Caesar in his Roman pigs to death?
[time=190] Messiah is to bring us freedom.
[time=193] Most of us don't want much in this life, David.
[time=196] All we want is a chance to have a little freedom and to raise our families without some infidel stepping on our back.
[time=204] So if he is the Messiah, then where is the freedom?
[time=208] They're in his words.
[time=210] They are life.
[time=213] Hey.
[time=219] Hey, pay the man. Words. Words are fleeting.
[time=224] Alright. Then how about the stories?
[time=229] How about what people have said about him?
[time=232] At the age of 12, he amazed the scholars in the temple with his wisdom and understanding of the scriptures.
[time=238] Stories.
[time=239] He was baptized.
[time=242] And a voice from heaven said this is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased.
[time=247] Stories.
[time=248] Be quiet and listen for a change.
[time=251] Granted, I am only a shepherd and you.
[time=261] You are a lawyer.
[time=265] But perhaps maybe I can teach you something.
[time=271] Haven't you heard lawyers can't be taught anything?
[time=276] Alright. Then how about a friend?
[time=280] Alright. I'll listen to what he says.
[time=294] You'll listen? I'll try to keep an open mind.
[time=298] What makes him so special?
[time=300] Oh, fattiest. What he says. What he does. I've heard him many times. He's not like any other teacher.
[time=307] Look. Look. He's coming.
[time=330] With your voices praise him on high.
[time=337] Praise him, praise him.
[time=346] With your voices praise him on high.
[time=352] Praise him, praise him.
[time=360] With your voices praise him on high.
[time=367] Praise him, praise him.
[time=376] With your voices praise him on high.
[time=382] Praise him, praise him.
[time=390] With your voices praise him on high.
[time=397] Praise him, praise him.
[time=405] With your voices praise him on high.
[time=412] Praise him, praise him.
[time=420] With your voices praise him on high.
[time=427] Praise him, praise him on high.
[time=441] With your praise, with your voices praise him on high.
[time=458] Praise him, praise him.
[time=466] With your voices praise him on high.
[time=472] Praise him, praise him.
[time=479] With your voices praise him on high.
[time=486] Praise him, praise him on high.
[time=494] With your voices praise him on high.
[time=1671] As we approach this subject matter this morning of parenting.
[time=1674] I want to ask you the question again.
[time=1676] What are you looking for?
[time=1679] Where are you putting your focus?
[time=1682] Something that looks good on the outside or something that runs good on the inside.
[time=1687] If you have a Bible this morning I invite you to open it to Ephesians chapter 6.
[time=1691] And we're going to give kind of the fourth and final installment in our series on the family.
[time=1695] And the text we come to is about children and about parents.
[time=1700] It opens in verse one.
[time=1701] It says children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right.
[time=1707] Now that's the outside.
[time=1708] That's the fact that children are supposed to obey their parents.
[time=1712] They are in fact supposed to do what their parents tell them to do.
[time=1716] And that's where sometimes the emphasis comes on the look right, act right, smile right, talk right, study right, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[time=1722] And we have a responsibility to teach our children that it is their obligation to obey us.
[time=1726] And it's our responsibility to tell our children to do the right kind of things.
[time=1732] But if you look at verse two, the far more important subject matter begins to enter the scene.
[time=1737] Honor your father and mother, which is the first commandment with a promise.
[time=1742] I consider it the most important subject material because it is possible to have children who do everything right on the outside for a period of time.
[time=1749] And if that is the primary focus, you may because of your intimidating size and some of the stuff you have in your artillery, be able to force them or coerce them or shame them or bribe them or manipulate them into the right outside stuff.
[time=1764] But eventually it's going to get down to whether or not they honor you.
[time=1768] Eventually it's going to get down to the inside dimension of their heart and mind.
[time=1772] Do they have a heartfelt love and respect for their parents?
[time=1776] Do they deeply respect, hold somewhere in their heart that a child should hold for the people who brought them into the world, a love from the heart for the parent.
[time=1787] And that of course leads us to look not just at the action, but at the heart.
[time=1793] In my studies this week I came across one parent's description of what he would really like to see happen in the life of the child.
[time=1802] And not excluding some of the outward manifestations of obedience, but a very insightful and poignant description of the kinds of things that this parent is hoping to see in the life of the child.
[time=1812] Let me read it to you.
[time=1813] First he said, "I'd like to see that my child discover that his deepest innermost love needs can and only ultimately will be met by the love of God." I want a child who won't have to bounce from person to person, crowd to crowd, spouse to spouse, looking for that inner love need to be met by a human being, when in point of spiritual fact it can only be ultimately met and maintained by the love of God.
[time=1840] I'd like my child to discover that his or her sense of significance comes from being in a right relationship with God and carrying out his purposes in life instead of getting on that earthly achievement treadmill which says, "I'm only a somebody if I perform, if I score high, if I set records of some kind every year." I'd like my child to be freed up from the need to please and placate people because that is a dead end road in the final analysis.
[time=1866] I am praying that my child will experience soul satisfaction in pleasing and enjoying God and having healthy and loving relationships with people in the family of God.
[time=1878] I'd like my child to learn how to derive strength and courage from God so as to be able to overcome temptation and feelings of failure and discouragement and gain spiritual strength to be able to stand firm in the faith in a world that is ravaged by sin and evil.
[time=1894] I'd like my child to lead a surrendered enough spiritual life to be able to receive and respond to promptings of the Holy Spirit that make the Christian life an adventure.
[time=1905] I'd like my child to be able to trust in God's provision and watch care so that his or her life is freed up from scrambling and fretting about every dollar and every deal along the way.
[time=1919] I'd like my child to be secure enough spiritually so that they are sure of their place in heaven so they will be liberated from the crippling fear of death.
[time=1928] Lastly, he says I'd like my child to be liberated by the love of God enough to pursue and enjoy his or her own God given vocational passion whether that be in business or medicine, construction, ministry, the arts, politics or education so that his or her life's work is just an outer expression of God's inner work and wiring pattern.
[time=1954] I sure wish somebody would have come alongside me when I was making that first purchase of an automobile and asked me the question what are you looking for?
[time=1962] I mean what's the criteria you're going to try to answer in this purchasing decision.
[time=1967] Are you just looking for something that looks good on the outside or are you looking for something that runs right on the inside?
[time=1976] A lot of you are at the end of the child rearing process and you hear these words and you hear this focus and something inside of your heart agrees with that notion.
[time=1984] You say man I wish somebody would have been there early, early on in the child raising game because we got so caught up in the look right, act right, smile right, talk right, study right thing that somewhere along the way the relational connections got broken and they've not to this and they've been reestablished.
[time=2003] Others of you are just starting out they just drop that newborn into your arms for the very first time and we trust that you'll hear it loud and clear.
[time=2013] You got to start and you got to change and you got to love and you got to grow your child from the inside out, not the outside in.
[time=2021] And then there are the rest of us who are knee deep in kids, hip deep, neck deep, drowning deep in kids.
[time=2028] The day to day struggle in our life is to somehow remember the issue that it all starts at the heart.
[time=2034] It's a relational issue with your kids.
[time=2038] Never ever ever opt for the simplicity of outward
[time=2044] conformity and that and that alone.
[time=2049] Well in verse four he talks to us as parents it says, "And fathers do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and the instruction of the Lord." Now fathers in the Greek it's a term that could be translated parents, okay, so this is really for all of us who are in the child rearing business, not just the father but the parent.
[time=2070] And the phrase I want to begin to look at this morning is "Do not provoke your children to anger." What does that mean? Do not provoke your children to anger.
[time=2080] It's subject I think to a lot of misunderstandings.
[time=2083] Oftentimes I think people see it as a head-to-head confrontation between parent and child in which the parent is intentionally frustrating, tormenting or teasing or abusing their child.
[time=2095] And in that same encounter the child finally explodes right there in front of the parent for that kind of treatment.
[time=2102] Now I'm sure that is included in what it means to provoke your children to anger, but that might be its most basic understanding. Do you realize that a child who is
[time=2114] provoked to anger by a parent may initially express that anger in the presence of the parent, but that will soon stop.
[time=2123] And the anger that is provoked in the heart and mind of that child will begin to bleed its way out in all of that child's other relationships or just some of those other relationships.
[time=2135] Now it may appear calm on the child parent front, but there will be trouble with a sibling or there will be trouble with a teacher or there will be trouble with a coach or there will be trouble with a friend or there will be trouble with the family dog. Somewhere along the line the anger that has been provoked by that parent or parent is going to find its way out of the heart of that child in 99% of the cases.
[time=2163] The real point at which this began was in the home as that parent provoked his child. So it raises the question how do parents, how do parents provoke their children to anger? Well there could be a list I imagine a million miles long, but I have tried to reduce it down to three major categories. Number one, you provoke your child to anger when you fail to live a fully consecrated and surrendered life to God. You say, wait a minute, I thought this was about me and my child. Well it is, but it starts in your relationship with God. Anytime a parent fails to live
[time=2205] a fully consecrated and surrendered life to God they are in fact provoking their child to anger. Why? Because the child was built by God to be led by a spirit filled fully surrendered Christ honoring parent. They have it in eight cents, they have a longing in their heart, they have a cavity inside their soul that can be filled only by the presence of Christ honoring spirit filled parents. And anything short of that leaves them in the provoked state which eventually leads to anger.
[time=2239] You see they need things from you, they can only get from you when you are fully surrendered. They need the kinds of words and the kinds of time and the kinds of love and the kinds of insight and the kinds of self-sacrifice. They need those things from you which they can only get from you when you are first fully surrendered to the true and living God and empowered by his spirit. That is why the section began. Do not be drunk with wine for that is dissipation but be filled with the spirit.
[time=2264] Remember these are just categories of how you live out what it means to be filled with the spirit. When you and I as parents step out of God's will for our lives known or unknown in ways known to our children and unknown by our children, they are provoked.
[time=2280] Wouldn't it be great if life could be compartmentalized?
[time=2286] Wouldn't it be great if the decisions I make over here in my relationship with God were utterly cut off and had nothing to do with and had absolutely no bearing on my relationship with my kids but my friends it's not that way.
[time=2296] You see it doesn't come down to a nice meal at McDonald's.
[time=2302] It doesn't come down to showing up at a sports event.
[time=2305] It doesn't come down to spending a certain amount of time.
[time=2308] It comes down to who you are and are you surrendered and are
[time=2314] you filled and in that way you will give things to your kids that
[time=2321] are so much bigger than meals at McDonald's and your present your presence at athletic events and those are important.
[time=2329] Let me say it to this way it is impossible to separate your
[time=2335] personal walk with Christ and the way your children experience you. It is impossible to separate your personal walk with Christ and the way your children experience you and some of you are trying to do that. Some of you are saying in your heart I love my kids I want my kids to have a good upbringing I don't want to provoke my kids to anger I don't want to push onto my kids some of the damage that can be done to them in the early years they'll have to deal with in college and later in married life I don't want all that to happen in life but you know what I'll just do good with my kids but over here I've got this area of compromise but I love that too much to give up and it won't hurt my kids or I've got this area of compromise and I love my kids but that will affect them and you're lying to yourself it's a non-reality it doesn't exist and so the
[time=2383] beckoning of scripture is not to provoke your children to anger the second way the second way that we provoke our children to anger is this you provoke your child to anger when you fail to love your spouse with all of your heart you say oh no aren't we to the children yet I mean now you're going to talk about my house first you can talk about my relation with God now my relationship to my spouse but yeah yeah I am once again your
[time=2411] child has been built by God with certain longings and certain expectations unspoken even in the mind of that child there is a innate sense of what ought to be happening between my mother and my father nobody has to teach your child that and nobody can un-teach your child that stuff all you can do is fail to meet those expectations fail to show them the kind of dynamic loving pursuit that ought to happen between a husband and a wife and as you fail to do that you will provoke your child to anger you will set a flame in their heart all kinds of mysterious energies that they don't fully comprehend and might not even be fully aware of but which will later find their way out into self-destructive behavior your child doesn't need
[time=2457] tapes and your child doesn't need seminars to find out that there's a certain way that mom and dad are supposed to relate and when they don't relate somehow something happens bad inside of me you know what they may not be able to articulate it they
[time=2475] may not be able to explain it to you you might be able to sit down and ask them what you consider some probing questions and they may come up with all these answers that leave you believing that the problem with you and your spouse aren't affecting your child they may not be able to rebuke you and and your family for not loving as they ought to love they may
[time=2497] not even know the particulars of what is going wrong between you and your spouse they may not even know that it's happening but you need to know this they'll sense it they'll feel it and the things that they are supposed to be receiving from you as a husband and wife team they will not be receiving and it will leave them in a state of provoked anger and you know what it doesn't matter if the child is six years old or 18 years old or 22 years old I've worked with kids who are 22 years old just completed a very successful college degree done very well academically done very well athletically have nothing but the bright things ahead of them in life and suddenly they find out that mom and dad aren't really doing as well as they thought and they're all kinds of skeletons that are coming out of the closet and divorce is imminent and you can see a well adjusted 22 year old kid begin to just crumble right at right there right at that age in life now listen a lot of us are trying to play a hand that
[time=2562] we didn't like the you know what got dealt a lot of you are here today and you're single and you don't want to be single and your family isn't together the husband and wife thing has been long since destroyed and you tried hard and it blew up and there's nothing to be done about it and I want you to know that the word of God is very understanding and God is very sympathetic to that and this is not intended to bash that state or that condition and your calling in life is to take what you have and to do the very very best that you possibly can do and to find a church like this one that can help potentially fill in some of the blanks wherever we possibly can help and small groups of people to come into your life and be the kind of supporting people that they need to be.
[time=2605] The third way that parents provoke their children remember
[time=2613] now these are broad categories the third way you provoke your child to anger is when you fail to enjoy them for who they are.
[time=2623] When you and I fail to enjoy our children for who they are.
[time=2627] You know we get so caught up in the look right, act right, smile right, talk right, study right, clean your room right thing and those are good things aren't they.
[time=2635] But when those become the issue when your child begins to sense that somewhere deep inside your heart that's really all that matters to you because they don't ever get that wonderful beautiful gaze that comes from your eyes that just says you know somehow I just enjoy you for who you are.
[time=2653] The predominant thing about their relationship with you is a sense of being enjoyed.
[time=2659] You know I don't understand it we don't know a lot about what God and the Heavenly Father and the Son the second member of the Trinity we don't know a lot about what those guys did for all of eternity past.
[time=2671] We do know one thing the book of John tells us that they stood face to face in perfect fellowship with each other.
[time=2679] There was something going on between the Heavenly Father and the Heavenly Son that locked them in a gaze with one another and there was nothing but pure enjoyment.
[time=2688] There was there was total vulnerability.
[time=2690] There was nothing being hidden.
[time=2692] There were no hidden agendas.
[time=2693] There was no self covering up.
[time=2695] There was just absolute total exposure and in the midst of that total exposure total acceptance and total love.
[time=2701] When was the last time your child?
[time=2703] Felt that from you.
[time=2707] You know you get into space and time you jump right into the relationship with Adam and Eve and the Bible says they were naked and not ashamed.
[time=2713] They were naked not just physically they were naked emotionally and spiritually and intellectually they were naked in every category of their life.
[time=2720] It means they were hiding nothing from each other and yet naked and not ashamed.
[time=2725] Now beautifully before the fall there was no sin and so there was nothing to be ashamed of.
[time=2729] But that is what your child was created to experience.
[time=2732] That is the capacity to be enjoyed that sits as a remnant even after the fall and your child longs to experience being known for who he is and loved all the better.
[time=2743] Some parents blow that whole foundational relational
[time=2752] component when they get so caught up in the look, ax, smile, talk, study, clean deal.
[time=2757] Other parents blow that dynamic by saying you know I don't really care and what they mean is I don't care about you.
[time=2766] Neglect.
[time=2767] Stay out of my way.
[time=2768] Don't bother me.
[time=2769] Make it on your own.
[time=2770] Do your own thing.
[time=2771] Make your own choices and you find on either side of that continuum the heirs where your child never really feels loved and understood for who he is.
[time=2781] And so it's this insane and crazy maze that we have to walk as parents seeking to as we'll note here in a minute discipline and give instruction because it isn't a free for all and it isn't just find your own way but it can't be this controlling dominating conditional component.
[time=2800] Remember this my friend your child was designed by God to be deeply enjoyed by you, his parents.
[time=2808] To be able to look up into your eyes and find something utterly uncritical, unanalyzing, unfixing, uncorrecting.
[time=2818] Just enjoyment.
[time=2822] We'll look at verse four again.
[time=2824] It says don't provoke your child to anger but bring them up.
[time=2828] This is a very positive statement.
[time=2830] This has got to communicate to you.
[time=2833] This whole bring them up thing.
[time=2835] There's vision here my friends.
[time=2837] There's a vision when you close your eyes for who your child can be and I like the way it was articulated by the father we read from earlier.
[time=2845] It's not just behavioral things, it's internal values and dynamics and experiences and the way they learn to struggle with life.
[time=2852] I mean there's got to be a vision inside your heart and mind for the kind of mature godly thing you're trying to produce first from the inside and then later the outside as God gives grace.
[time=2865] Well he gives two words here about bringing them up, discipline and instruction.
[time=2869] We'll briefly talk about each of them and again I'm going to have to stay way up at the principalized level for lack of time and you know we have an entire course here in the church called Growing Kids God's Way or Growing Kids.
[time=2878] It's by Gary Eso and numbers of you have gone through it.
[time=2881] It just gives tremendous help in the specifics.
[time=2883] But let me see if I can't what your appetite.
[time=2885] Discipline here.
[time=2886] Discipline talks about character development.
[time=2889] Character development doesn't happen by accident in the life of your child and when they're young in that zero to five year deal there's got to be things like spankings and there's got to be you know punishment that helps them understand that they are not the center of their universe.
[time=2907] You realize that each and every one of us was born thinking that we are God that we are the reason everybody else exists.
[time=2914] That we are the reason everybody else should you know function in our benefit all the time and that doesn't have to be taught that's just right in the heart the second the child is born.
[time=2923] And you do your child no favor by reinforcing that falsehood in their mind.
[time=2930] The Minnesota Crime Commission a bunch of policemen they get together and they write this way.
[time=2934] This is interesting I don't believe everything it says but it's getting close.
[time=2938] They say this everybody every baby starts life as a little savage.
[time=2942] He is completely selfish and self-centered.
[time=2945] He wants what he wants when he wants it his bottle his mother's attention his play mates toys his uncle's watch or whatever.
[time=2952] Deny him these things and he seeds with rage and aggressiveness which would be murderous were he not so helpless.
[time=2961] He's dirty he has no morals no knowledge no developed skills this means that all children not just certain children but all children are born delinquent it permitted to continue in their self-centered world of infancy given free reign their impulsive actions to satisfy each and every want every child would grow up a criminal a thief a killer or a rapist.
[time=2982] That's going a little bit too far and throwing the baby out of the bathwater so to speak but it certainly gets to what I see in the heart and life of my kids.
[time=2989] And I hear from my parents it's pretty close to what they saw in me there is an innate selfishness.
[time=2995] And we do our children no favor by coddling to that and letting them think that the world revolves around them.
[time=3003] Susan Wesley she raised 17 kids two of which were John and Charles Wesley men of the great faith men who have had a tremendous impact on the world for the cause of Christ she says this the parent who studies to subdue self will in his child works together with God in the renewing and saving of a soul.
[time=3021] The parent who indulges it does the devil's work makes religion impractical salvation unattainable and does all that in him lies to damn his child soul and body forever.
[time=3032] That's a good little quote can you imagine if you have this little child and you never once curb its selfishness you never once help it understand there's a thing called discipline and there are consequences for choices.
[time=3046] I've got you know five kids the youngest is three and we're in that little stage here with Bobby he's he's three and a half now see and he's thinking he rules the world.
[time=3054] He's thinking that he is you know God of our household all these sisters exist for him his mother exists for him I exist for him.
[time=3064] He's big on this word why I say hey don't do that why.
[time=3068] It's like you got a reason because if you don't I'm probably going to go right ahead and do it.
[time=3075] So I have the old sit down with him and I get a little of him I say hey Bob you got to obey me.
[time=3081] You got to obey me the first time if I say put your blanket away don't say why say okay dad and go put your blanket away.
[time=3089] So he says why.
[time=3095] I say because if you don't I'm going to spank you.
[time=3099] He says really I say really.
[time=3104] So yesterday that was talk was yesterday morning so yesterday a little bit later on the day he did some he shouldn't do.
[time=3110] And you know he knew he was wrong and he knew he had been properly briefed prior to that whole occasion and so we went into his room and you know he drops his pants and he comes around the side and climbs up on my legs and there we go.
[time=3124] And you know he's screaming and wailing and crying and you know what I'm not mad at him.
[time=3130] I love him.
[time=3131] I just love him enough he needs to find out early in the game he is not the center of the universe.
[time=3139] First time obedience is what that curriculum calls for and I think it's very very good.
[time=3143] I see parents say no and then they say no and then they say no and then they say no and finally the kids like man you only I'm only in trouble with you when you're irate.
[time=3154] Now what's that telling me about the God you represent?
[time=3157] Is this discipline about you or is this discipline about me?
[time=3161] You know I think there's ways to help your children and discipline them consistently and faithfully and before you're out of control that help them get a very clear picture that they are not the center of the universe and I think you give your child a great gift when you do that.
[time=3176] You know you move along though they get into the 16 to 18 age we got a couple of them in that rather six to 18 age and these are just rough things that come to my mind in terms of parameters but we pretty much stop spanking you know after about six or seven years of age and hopefully we've done a good job with that anyway so there isn't a lot of need for it.
[time=3193] And then the discipline changes to what I call restorative discipline.
[time=3197] Work a lot on trust in our household and you show yourself faithful with this and this and this you get a little more rope you show yourself faithful that you get a little bit more and when there's disobedience it's mainly an issue of breaking trust you didn't do what you were supposed to do you didn't hold up your end of the bargain and that's not just a behavioral problem you see primarily that's a relational problem.
[time=3216] And so we go after that on a relational level what's going on here between the two of us.
[time=3222] Why did you choose to do that and how can you restore your level of trust on that particular issue that's why we don't do a lot of grounding in my house it just seems it just seems like there's nothing too grounding I mean your child just sits home for that many times they lose all their activities and what did they show you how did they get to restore themselves.
[time=3239] We work more like on work details you mess up on a couple things you disobey over here and there you get a chance to restore our confidence in you by doing something about it performing some extra tasks and then we get to watch the attitude that task is done with and we get to watch the promptness and the manner and the thoroughness and then we get to talk about that that's not a cure all it's not a magic thing but it keeps us on a highly relational level the issue here is you and the issue is me and the issue is me trusting you and you trusting me and are we going to honor each other in this situation because you know what that's pretty much what it is between you and me and God it's pretty much a relationship and the whole issue comes down to trust and am I going to trust him and am I going to honor him we don't do a lot of
[time=3284] of bribing in our house and we don't do a lot of nitpicking in our house for example grades I hide in I refuse to sit there and say to a child before they sit down to watch a TV program have you done all your homework maybe when they're real young but very soon they just know if they get grades that are below the acceptable deal they're going to pay consequences and as they get close to doing that midterms come out and the reports come out they got to sit down on a piece of paper and say okay next semester this is what I got to give up if that grade stays there if I get an unacceptable grade and then instead of asking them have they done their homework they ask us for help with their homework it's a much better arrangement we've only had one child so far that's dropped down in those low grades and she wrote out her deal in advance because we could see it coming and she faithfully followed all those consequences in her life and the next semester she was on the honor roll didn't want to go there anymore didn't want to give those things up anymore allow natural consequences wherever possible to be the disciplinarian well a lot more can be said what about instruction
[time=3345] instruction is an entirely different thing discipline is character discipline is learning to say no to yourself discipline is learning that you are not the only person in the universe that you need to control yourself put yourself under control instruction on the other hand is the wisdom of proverbs and it's talking about how you relate to other people you if you have not entered into the conversations with your children about how people work how they're wired up how why people get angry why people manipulate why people act the way they do in response to other people's behaviors you've missed one of the major categories of your child's life it is an unspeakable privilege to talk to your child at a heart level about how they're relating with their friends and their peers and their coaches and their teachers and all the rest and those are the things that need to be seized where the wisdom of God can begin to be fed into their mind how do people feel what is that person
[time=3402] feeling what was that person feeling do you think when they said that to you why might they have said that how did you react how did that make you feel how did that make you behave why do you want that to let you behave that way why didn't you choose this road what were your options what were you feeling what were you thinking what are your choices you know in Deuteronomy six it says you're supposed to teach God when you sit in your house and walk by the way and lie down and rise up and I don't think that means that you are a constant verbalization of the character of God every time you're with your kid what I think it means is there are teachable moments in life and some of them happen when you're sitting in your house in a movie just got done and it wasn't the kind of movie that upheld the kind of values that you might uphold and so you get to think that through and talk all about that it might happen as you're walking by the way it might happen as you're lying down at night it might happen as you're rising up in the morning but God gives you the unspeakable privilege of discipling your children for 18 years both in character development under discipline and instruction in terms of how they relate to other people
[time=3464] the word of God calls you to stay in relationship with your child it's messy and it's confusing it raises more questions than it answers oftentimes their behavior for you to stay in relationship their behavior you may need to give them enough room to violate certain of your preferences even violate certain principles of the word of God but but you're you're you're not totally in control of all that are you what you're called to do is stay in relationship with your kids and in the midst of that do the best you can to give discipline and instruction and the word of God if we've learned anything from the way he works with us the focus is on the heart God is far more concerned with your heart and the attitudes of your heart than he is external obedience that is shallow and hollow and has no core reality
