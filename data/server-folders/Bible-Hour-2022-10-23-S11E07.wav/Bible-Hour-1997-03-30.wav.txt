[time=30] This is the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=53] Thank you for joining us.
[time=54] On this Easter Sunday, Pastor Kelly Bird remembers the resurrection and what it means to us as he gives us a resurrection reminder.
[time=62] We hope you'll stay with us today.
[time=64] Now let's join our service.

[time=1984] He shows David his love. He shows David his love by forgiving David for the adultery and the sexual sin with Bathsheba and the murder of her husband in the battle that followed.
[time=1994] And he brought David back into his arms. David a man it says after God's own heart. He showed love to Job by limiting Satan's attack on Job.
[time=2004] And in the end after Job had painfully endured all of that blessed Job with two times as much as he had ever had in the beginning.
[time=2011] He showed him his love. Jesus showed the love of God.
[time=2017] And the New Testament there as he walked and lived and ate with and ministered to the people, and not just the people, the homeless people, the helpless people, the lepers, the sick, the hungry.
[time=2028] Everywhere he went, evidencing and extending love to people. Yet it's powerful.
[time=2034] It's powerful as each of those examples are, right? And they are powerful. I hope you see that. I hope you sense that.
[time=2040] Not one of them surpasses in significance or impact. The level of love he showed you 2,000 years ago Friday when he hung on that cross for you.
[time=2053] None of those examples in any way shape or form surpassed in significance or impact. The level of love he showed for you 2,000 years ago today when he defeated death and he left that tomb empty.
[time=2065] So you could have life. The ultimate act, the ultimate act of love.
[time=2072] The blood-stained cross and the empty tomb stand today as the symbols of his deep and personal love for you and I, his deep and personal love. Look at Romans chapter 5.
[time=2083] Romans chapter 5, take a look. And again, just be amazed and be encouraged and be thankful for the reality of what has taken place. Romans chapter 5, we'll start at verse 6.
[time=2095] I want you to just see and be reminded of what he did as he evidenced and showed love to you and to me in a divine and supernatural way.
[time=2103] Verse 6 says this, "For while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. For one will hardly die for a righteous man, though perhaps for the good man someone would dare even to die, but God completely different than us."
[time=2120] God demonstrates his own love toward us and that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us, much more than having now been justified by his blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through him.
[time=2135] Verse 10, 4, "If while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more having been reconciled, we shall be saved by his life."
[time=2149] Look back at those. I want to show you four things there. Verse 6 says, "For while we were still helpless, Christ died for the ungodly."
[time=2158] Verse 8 says that he demonstrates his love and that while we were still sinners, and verse 10 says that while we were enemies, think about that.
[time=2165] We were helpless ungodly sinners who were enemies of God and he extends to you an everlasting love.
[time=2175] Amazing, the amazing love of God. Folks, this morning, be reminded, please, that you have been divinely and supernaturally loved.
[time=2187] Number 2, second thing that we're reminded of this morning, the death and resurrection of Jesus reminds me that I am forgiven.
[time=2196] Think about it. You're forgiven. You are absolutely and completely and totally forgiven.
[time=2204] Now, the events surrounding the cross and the tomb brought clarity, right? They brought clarity and resolution to what was a major, major dilemma.
[time=2215] There was a major dilemma. The major dilemma was the presence of what we call sin.
[time=2222] And the presence of sin, up into that point, left us separated from God, a holy God, who didn't unite himself, didn't fellowship with that which was imperfect.
[time=2233] So here you are and here I am, completely sinful. Romans 3 says that there was none righteous, no not even one. Romans 3, 23 says all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, his standard of holy perfection.
[time=2248] And so there's this dilemma. We're left with an eternity separated from God, separated from the love of God unless something happens and something happened.
[time=2260] He injects his solution into the dilemma. It's called the scandalous grace of God.
[time=2268] I like that word. The scandalous, the uncanny, the confusing for you and I, right? I mean, it is for me. For me, it doesn't make sense.
[time=2278] That there was the dilemma. And it was a dilemma because of what I had done, because of my sinfulness and my humanness.
[time=2288] And into this dilemma, he injects, God the Father injects his only son and extends this unbelievable, incomprehensible grace, unmerited favor.
[time=2302] And what happens? Well, with the substitutionary key word, the substitutionary death, and he substituted himself for who, for you and for me.
[time=2315] With the substitutionary death of Christ on the cross, what does 2 Corinthians 5, 21 say? It says he made him who knew no sin.
[time=2327] Jesus, right? He knew no sin. He was perfect.
[time=2330] He hadn't done anything, thought anything, gone anywhere to deserve what he got, you and I had.
[time=2335] And he made him who knew no sin, it says, to be sin. Think about that.
[time=2341] All of the sin of an entire world placed on the shoulders of one man, sent to die in a substitutionary sense for you and I.
[time=2351] And he made him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf. Why? The verse goes on to say, so that we might become the righteousness of God.
[time=2360] So that we might become like him, so that we might have a relationship with him.
[time=2367] With the shedding of his blood on the cross, we were and are forgiven. You are forgiven. Look at Psalm 103.
[time=2377] Start at verse 8. Look what it says there.
[time=2381] The Lord is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in loving kindness.
[time=2386] It goes on to verse 9 and says, he will not always strive with us, nor will he keep his anger forever.
[time=2393] He has not dealt with us according to our sins nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. Has he?
[time=2400] He hasn't, has he? Has he? You know that that's true. He has not dealt with you. He has not dealt with me according to my iniquities.
[time=2413] According to my transgressions, he has been compassionate with me.
[time=2420] Keep going. For as high as the heavens, listen, for as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his loving kindness toward those who fear him.
[time=2433] And verse 12, as far as the east is from the west, so far as he removed our transgressions from us.
[time=2443] Folks, you have been forgiven. We celebrate this morning an event that reminds us of the fact that we have been forgiven in a supernatural and divine way.
[time=2456] We have been forgiven. Flip over to Colossians chapter 2.
[time=2463] Colossians chapter 2, another powerful passage that just kind of encapsulates this whole thing of the death and the resurrection and this idea of being forgiven.
[time=2474] Look what it says. Colossians chapter 2 verse 10.
[time=2478] And in him you have been made complete it says. And in him you have been made complete and he is the head over all rule and authority.
[time=2485] And in him you were also circumcised with a circumcision made without hands in the removal of the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ.
[time=2495] In him, in other words, our spirit has been circumcised. We're not talking about a physical circumcision.
[time=2501] Having been buried with him, verse 12, having been buried with him in baptism in which you were also raised up with him through faith in the working of God who raised him from the dead.
[time=2512] And when you were dead, when you were dead in your transgressions and the uncircumcision of your flesh, he made you alive together with him having forgiven us all our transgressions.
[time=2527] Be reminded this morning people that what took place 2,000 years ago this weekend allows anyone in this room today to stand before a living, loving and holy God and experience complete and total forgiveness.
[time=2540] And it's the only thing that deals with the dilemma. It's the only thing. And he did it so that your dilemma could be solved.
[time=2554] You've been forgiven.
[time=2558] You have been divinely and supernaturally loved. You have been divinely and supernaturally forgiven.
[time=2564] And thirdly, the death and resurrection of Jesus reminds me that I am transformed.
[time=2571] You have been, anyone here this morning who lives in relationship with Christ, the Bible tells us that you have been and I have been completely and totally changed.
[time=2581] At the very, very core of who we are, way down deep inside, we have been radically altered.
[time=2589] Yeah, it's true. Look at 2 Corinthians 5, 17.
[time=2594] 2 Corinthians 5, 17, just after 1 Corinthians, before you get two Galatians, 2 Corinthians 5, 17.
[time=2603] Pretty brief, but pretty powerful. It says, therefore, if any man is in Christ, he is a new creature.
[time=2610] The old things have passed away. Behold, new things have come.
[time=2616] You are a new creature. You are no longer lost in the dilemma. You are no longer spiritually dead in relationship with a risen Lord.
[time=2625] In relationship with a risen Lord, you have been completely changed. You have been made new. The old mindset, the old attitude, the old bitterness, the old anger.
[time=2634] The old selfish, independent spirit has been done away with, the Bible tells us.
[time=2640] And you have been made new. Completely new. Look at Romans 6, back up just a couple of pages back over to Romans.
[time=2648] Romans 6, again, a powerful picture that takes this whole idea of the death and resurrection and really makes a point.
[time=2655] It makes a big point about you are a nice transformation. Look at Romans 6 verses 5 to 7.
[time=2661] It says there in Romans 6 verse 5, "For if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, certainly we shall also be in the likeness of his what? Resurrection."
[time=2675] Knowing this, that our old self was crucified with him, that our body of sin, the old self, that the old you, right?
[time=2683] The sinful, fleshly, self-motivated, self-driven deal that lived independent of God, right?
[time=2689] That old self has been done away with. It says there in verse 6, done away with that word, that phrase in the Greek means to be rendered powerless.
[time=2699] You think of a mad, man-eating lion that's been shot with the tranquilizing dart.
[time=2709] And what happens to the dangerous lion then, right?
[time=2713] Rendered powerless, my daughter, a little Wesley right a few weeks ago. She falls out of our friends.
[time=2719] Oh, he's not here, I can say. It was Russ and Heidi's suburban, right?
[time=2723] She's in Russ and Heidi's suburban. She falls out, standing up. She falls out of the back seat.
[time=2728] You know, the suburban's kind of high. She falls from the back seat, standing out right onto her forehead, on the driveway.
[time=2736] And she gets this huge thing on her head, and we rush her to the deal, and they throw her in this, you know, that they're going to give her the CAT scan.
[time=2743] They throw her in that thing, and she's like taking swings at this doctor. She's like not going in that thing.
[time=2749] So, boom, right? Rendered powerless.
[time=2752] It's just amazing to see her just go from this angry, swinging, scared little thing to just hands folded completely in La La Land.
[time=2760] No ability to do any harm at all.
[time=2763] Now, think about the picture. You have been radically transformed and changed.
[time=2770] And yes, there's that confusing thing that there will still be some struggle. That's true.
[time=2775] But spiritually and supernaturally and divinely, you have been transformed, and you now have, this passage tells us, the capacity to live life differently.
[time=2783] And you didn't used to have that. And now you do.
[time=2787] Because he died, and he rose, and in doing that, he gives you that same resurrection power to live life in a new and meaningful way.
[time=2795] It's an amazing picture. As a believer, you have been given a new heart, a new mind, a new soul, a new will, and a new desire.
[time=2805] Think of it this way, this whole picture of being transformed. Think of it this way. Try this one on.
[time=2811] Think about Jesus, and try to picture in your mind what he must have looked like when he was brought to the tomb by Joseph of Arimathea and by Nicodemus.
[time=2827] Think about that. What had he just gone through? How must he have looked? Really?
[time=2837] He had just been beaten for hours. He had just been whipped with a cat of nine pales. Within an inch of his life, death sentence was 40 lashes, and he got 39.
[time=2851] He'd had this crown of thorns shoved into his skull. He'd been spit on. He'd been crucified, nails through the wrist and through the feet, stabbed in the abdomen and left to die.
[time=2865] Think about what he must have looked like. Think about how he must have felt. And what did he say in the cross? He said it is finished. I am done. And he was. He was spent.
[time=2879] And then he goes into the tomb. And how does he come out? What's the word that comes to your mind?
[time=2887] Trim. Transformed. Right? Changed. And he ascends into heaven, and there he is today. And think of him now today. Think of what pictures come to your mind today as you picture Christ in glory.
[time=2902] Beaten spit on, tortured, stabbed, no. But isn't that the way it is sometimes for you and I? And I'll speak for me. You know what? I've tried to live 21 years apart from God.
[time=2913] And I'll tell you what I ended up, where I ended up, beaten. I ended up stabbed. I ended up finished. I ended up done.
[time=2922] I ended up tired and worn out from trying the impossible to live life with purpose apart from relationship with Christ.
[time=2933] Hold on to that picture. What happened to Jesus, the transformation, it's the very same thing that happens to a human heart and a human soul when we come to Christ.
[time=2946] Lastly, number four, the death and resurrection of Jesus reminds me this morning, and I hope it reminds you that I am satisfied.
[time=2957] That I am satisfied. You could throw a couple other words in there. It reminds us that we're fulfilled. It reminds us that we're taken care of.
[time=2971] Here in now and and ultimately, the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, what we celebrate here this morning reminds us that we are satisfied with reference to the everyday and of here in now, today's pain, today's confusion, today's hurt.
[time=2988] I am strengthened. I am bolstered by the reality that he has lived and experienced the full brunt of everything I face and more, and he offers me a way through it.
[time=3000] And I'm telling you, I looked people. Again, I spent 21 years, the last, you know, seven, eight of which I looked for other options to get through it.
[time=3011] And there were none. There were a lot of promises made by a lot of things out there that said, "Hey, come find life here." But nothing, nothing saw me through it.
[time=3023] Only relationship with Christ and the path that he provides for me and for you right here to work and move our way through with his help and assistance through whatever life might bring.
[time=3037] That's for today. Now, with reference to the future, with reference to what comes after this, I am satisfied. I am fulfilled by the realization that he has prepared a place for me, an eternal home, a place called heaven.
[time=3051] And whatever pain or confusion I may experience here in my earthly body, there is the hope and promise of heaven, the only thing, the only thing, the only place, the only thing, I'll say it again and again and again, the only thing that truly satisfies.
[time=3069] There's the hope of a better place that he has gone to prepare. Second Corinthians 4, 16 to 17, go back over there. We're kind of flipping back and forth between the two verses. But look at Second Corinthians 4, 16 and 17.
[time=3086] What does it say there? It says this, "Therefore, therefore we do not lose heart. But though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day for momentary light affliction, for momentary light affliction, verse 17, is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparisons.
[time=3112] And then let me read for you verse 18. "While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen, for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal."
[time=3129] I'm satisfied here today. Here today is hard sometimes. Here today doesn't make sense sometimes. Here in today, I struggle at times to understand it.
[time=3145] But I fundamentally believe that God is good and that in his goodness and in his good plan for me, he has provided a way for me to get through.
[time=3155] And he helps me with that and I need help with that, but I'll tell you what I'm looking forward. I'm living in my heart for a day where we would be, those of us that know him, eternally satisfied.
[time=3170] Now let me ask you a question. There's four things. We could have done four more. But think about these four things for a second.
[time=3176] Today reminds us that we are divinely and supernaturally loved. It reminds us that we are divinely and supernaturally forgiven, everything.
[time=3188] It reminds us that we are in relationship with him completely and totally transformed and changed.
[time=3195] And it reminds us that we have the opportunity and the privilege of being ultimately satisfied, fulfilled in him in the here and now and even in the future.
[time=3208] Those four things added together. I'll tell you what that says to me. That to me is a great description of what the Bible calls eternal life.
[time=3224] Think about it. Eternal life. What is eternal life? I think somebody asked Jesus then, didn't they? And he said in John 17, this is eternal life.
[time=3238] And then how did he choose to define it? Did he say this is eternal life that they would live for a long, long time, forever?
[time=3245] I mean, he could have gone the quantitative route, right? But he didn't. He went the qualitative route. He said this is eternal life, that they may what?
[time=3255] Say it. That they may know thee. That you might know God.
[time=3263] And that's eternal life, people, to know God today. And in knowing him to experience him and his love and his forgiveness and his transforming power and the satisfaction that comes in relationship with him.
[time=3279] It's eternal life. It's maybe the fifth thing that we would want to add to our list today. And we might want to make it just big and bold eternal life, all of which adds up to eternal life.
[time=3292] Well, I am extremely and so very thankful that this morning, you know, as I got up and I drove in here, that these things, again, even though there's real struggle at times, these things feel like, to me, they feel like reality.
[time=3315] It is the reality of my life as I continue to try my best to live it in relationship with him. It is reality in my life because of the scandalous grace of God, the uncanny, unthinkable grace that he extended to me.
[time=3332] And I want you to know this morning that if you're here with us and this morning to date, in all honesty, just between you and him, if you're here today and you don't live in relationship with him, then I'm really sad for you.
[time=3350] Not that I feel sorry for you, and I don't say this in a condemning way. I just want you to know how sad it is for me to know that there are people today in this world and in this room.
[time=3363] And today, this day that we celebrate, let's be honest, it's not that significant for you.
[time=3371] It doesn't really remind you of much, other than maybe the last time you were here a year ago.
[time=3381] And that's sad for me because I would want for you the realization and the understanding of what it's like to be loved, because you haven't experienced that yet.
[time=3393] You don't know what that's like to be loved that well.
[time=3399] It makes me sad because I would want for you the joy and the freedom of being forgiven, forgiven of everything, and to know what it's like to live life with that kind of forgiveness and that kind of freedom to be able to breathe again.
[time=3415] It makes me sad because I would want for you the understanding of what it means to be transformed.
[time=3422] I know, again, I know what it's like to not be transformed. I know what it's like to face life and all you've got yourself.
[time=3428] And nothing miraculous or spectacular has happened in your soul, and that's all you've got.
[time=3434] And I would want for you something far, far greater, and I would want for you to be satisfied.
[time=3442] I would want for you the joy and the thrill of being able to live life knowing that today and in the future there is a satisfaction that awaits you, that nothing in this world can touch.
[time=3454] And you may be trying really hard. I know you may be. I know you may be trying really hard today to convince yourself that something in this life satisfies you, but you know, and I know that it doesn't.
[time=3465] And so my prayer for you and my hope for you this morning is that if you are here and you're trying to live life outside of relationship with him, that the reality of what took place today 2,000 years ago, Friday, when he died for you, and Sunday when he rose for you, might finally today just knock you over.
[time=3489] And that you might say with a humble heart, I'm tired of trying this on my own. God, let me into relationship with you.
[time=3498] Let's stand.
[time=3500] And as you stand, let's just bow our heads and close our eyes, and I just want you to know again, if you're here this morning, and any of what we've talked about, you know, has brought you to a point where you would really like to talk about these things.
[time=3513] You would really like to ask some more questions. We would love to do that with you. Let's pray.
