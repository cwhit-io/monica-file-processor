[time=50] - This is the Sunday morning worship service
[time=57] of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=59] Thank you for joining us.
[time=61] We all know someone who has fallen to sin.
[time=63] The Bible says that it is the proud, independent, and arrogant who are the most likely to fall in their walk with Christ.
[time=69] In Ephesians chapter 13, Paul tells us to take up the full armor of God so that we can stand firm.
[time=76] Today, Pastor Moore looks at what the Bible says about spiritual warfare, putting on the armor of God.
[time=82] Now let's join our service.

[time=659] Thank you, Cheryl.
[time=660] This is an interesting how God can give some gifts to some people in the family and leave the others just totally out.
[time=666] You know, it's just fine, Lord.
[time=668] Ephesians 6, let me invite you to open your Bible to Ephesians 6.
[time=674] If you're visiting today, we have been studying the Book of Ephesians for many months now and taking it chapter by chapter and passage by passage, and we come to this section of Scripture verses 10 through 17 on spiritual warfare, and we kind of gave the first installment last week and are continuing to its conclusion today.
[time=692] I want to begin this morning by reading verses 11 and 12 of Ephesians chapter 6.
[time=697] Put on the full armor of God that you may be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil.
[time=704] For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.
[time=716] 18 years ago as a seminary student, I studied this text and looked at it in the original language, and thought I came away with it with a pretty good understanding of what the text was about and the truth that was in it and the concepts that God was trying to convey, but as I look at the text again, I have to admit that 18 years ago I was remarkably naive as to just what was really involved in the struggle against sin and Satan and the world of spiritual darkness.
[time=745] As time has worn on, I have found new ways to understand the text.
[time=750] Paul Guey was the chief of staff at Grace Community Church, and I had just gone into the ministry, and he had agreed to disciple me, and we met every single week for about an hour, for over a year until finally he decided to give his heart to another woman and to disqualify himself from the ministry, and I was disillusioned and shattered, and it took years really before we could speak again and have meaningful conversation.
[time=773] Cindy Hoyt was a member of my volunteer junior high staff.
[time=778] I had about 50 junior high volunteer staff people to help us with the sum 300 kids that were called our youth ministry.
[time=784] Cindy was a leader, Cindy was a teacher, Cindy was a student of God's words, Cindy was an evangelist, Cindy was faithful until she decided that she had some profound unanswered questions about the person, the nature, and the work of God.
[time=796] So profound were those questions that she never got them resolved, and she left our ministry, and we never heard from her again.
[time=804] Then there was a little church I pastored in Southern California for a couple of years, and I had never seen, in all my days, the amount of dissension and disgruntled-natured people as they argued, and would backbite, and would gossip, and would lie, and would tear the church apart.
[time=822] Then I came here and met a man and gave my heart to him, and discipled him, and met with him on a weekly basis, and had him as an associate pastor, and was enjoying ministry together until one day he decided to give his heart to another and commit adultery.
[time=837] Then I got word from California that my sister, not Cheryl, but another one, who had been married to her husband for some 26 years, and it had a profound impact on my understanding about God and God's Word and the early formative college years of my life.
[time=852] She decided to walk out on her husband without biblical grounds and hasn't gone back.
[time=859] You see, these are good people we're talking about here, people who loved Christ, people who were walking with the Lord, and if you'd have said to them two or three years prior to their defection, this is what you'll be doing in two or three years, they would have looked at you, and they'd have said, "That's ridiculous!
[time=875] That's preposterous! I love God, and I love His Word, and I'm going to walk obediently all the days of my life." Somewhere along the line, they began to think thoughts, and then they made some choices, and then they adopted some attitudes, and then they set a course of life.
[time=895] Totally contrary to the Word of God.
[time=900] With a new kind of urgency, I stand before you this morning, and I want to say this to you, that might be you next time, and that might be me next time.
[time=911] I mean, we might be the ones who have confronted with where we would be two or three years from today who would say, "Are you crazy?" It's not me.
[time=920] I love God, I love Christ, I love His Word, I want to finish.
[time=925] But all it takes, you know, is for us to begin to think some thoughts that we shouldn't think, and make some choices we shouldn't make, and begin to adopt some attitudes we shouldn't have, and suddenly, a life course, a radical change, and life course can be adopted.
[time=940] As we begin looking at this text a little more specifically this morning, go to verse 13 and look at the last six words.
[time=947] They should ring in our ears as we leave this place this morning, therefore, take up the full armor of God that you may be able to resist in the evil day, and here they are, having done everything to stand firm.
[time=961] The Word of God does not just alert us to the reality of a spiritual, unseen battle with the forces of wickedness.
[time=968] It not only tells us it's there, it then tells us about the armor that we can use as we combat it.
[time=975] But the theme of this passage is having done everything to stand firm,
[time=981] because Paul, as he writes this, is already aware of people who have defected from the faith.
[time=986] People he thought would never desert the cause of Christ, have done so.
[time=993] And so he cautions, and he warns, and he implores, and he begs, "Do everything in your power to stand firm."
[time=1003] World War II, there was a little mountain only about 556 feet tall
[time=1009] on a little island called Iwo Jima.
[time=1012] It was the site of the greatest blood loss in all of American battle.
[time=1018] Save, of course, the Civil War.
[time=1022] Of all the times, the American troops have gone to battle.
[time=1024] Never have we lost more men than we lost at Iwo Jima.
[time=1027] 19,000 were wounded, and 7,000 died.
[time=1031] Over a little piece of rock in the Pacific, 556 feet tall.
[time=1035] The Japanese had been there a long time, and they had dug very deeply into place, and they were guarding with a great tenacity, the territory that they had as theirs.
[time=1045] I have in front of me the last words of the Japanese commander, the last thing he ever radioed back to Tokyo before the battle was over.
[time=1055] He said this, and it's a great model to us about this notion of standing firm, having done everything. It says this, "The battle is approaching its end.
[time=1064] Since the enemy's landing, even the gods would weep at the bravery of the officers and men under my command.
[time=1070] In particular, I am pleased that our troops with empty hands carried out a series of desperate fights against an enemy possessing overwhelming material superiority on land, sea, and air.
[time=1082] However, my men have died, one by one.
[time=1086] And I regret very much that I have allowed the enemy to occupy a piece of Japanese territory.
[time=1093] Now there is no more ammunition, there's no more water.
[time=1098] All the survivors will engage in general attack.
[time=1105] There's an abandonment to protecting territory that is portrayed in this man's last communication,
[time=1113] life and death, that should ring in our hearts as we think about the spiritual battle
[time=1120] that we face every day of our lives against the enemy.
[time=1124] Having done everything to stand firm.
[time=1131] I want to say this to you this morning that Satan and his demonic host want a place in your life.
[time=1136] They want to gain some territory in your spiritual life, in your physical life, your emotional life,
[time=1142] your mental life, your financial life. I mean, they want to move on in and occupy.
[time=1147] And they know your name. They know your first name, your middle name, and your last name.
[time=1151] They know where you were born. They know who your parents were. They know how you grew up.
[time=1155] They know the significant events in your life. They know your strengths and your weaknesses, your attitude, your character, the way you process, your worldview, your political stances.
[time=1163] They know everything about you and they have a plan, a strategy to move into your life.
[time=1170] We saw last week that it has three basic phases. They want to tempt you to step outside of God's will.
[time=1174] And as they're tempting you, they're committed to deceiving you about the ultimate consequences of making that choice.
[time=1179] They don't want you to see the end from the beginning.
[time=1182] They tempt and then they deceive and once you commit that sin they want to accuse you, they want to beat you up, they want to hold you down, and they want to make you feel as though you do not matter to God anymore.
[time=1190] And the thing between you and God will never be fully restored.
[time=1194] They have that strategy in a tailor-made fashion with your name on it this morning and they are waiting for you
[time=1200] to give them a chance to move into your life. Be sure of that. Be sure of that.
[time=1208] This is not general vague stuff. I mean, it is in a sense.
[time=1212] There's always more questions we'd like to have answered about the spiritual forces of wickedness that's, you know, are just behind the thin veil of our ability to see.
[time=1221] But don't let that part diffuse your understanding that they exist.
[time=1226] They know who you are. They have a strategy and they are waiting for the opportunity to strike.
[time=1232] This morning, Paul reveals to us the armor of God.
[time=1236] Ephesians 6 goes beyond the declaration that these satanic forces exist and calling us to stand, having done everything against them, it tells us how to stand.
[time=1246] It offers us the armor of God and I would offer them to you this morning as six checkpoints.
[time=1251] And I want you to evaluate your life this morning.
[time=1253] I want you to bring the honesty of your heart and your life and vulnerability to the true and living God as he is revealing himself in this word.
[time=1260] And I want you to say, am I vulnerable on one of these points?
[time=1264] I want you to honestly ask yourself, how vulnerable am I here?
[time=1268] And remember the standard isn't just avoiding this stuff.
[time=1271] It is doing everything in your power to stand firm.
[time=1275] So six, six of them, six checkpoints in spiritual battle number one.
[time=1281] "Gird your loins with truth." "Gird your loins with truth." Verse 14, "Stand firm, therefore, having girded your loins with truth." Paul at the moment of his writing this book is chained, no doubt, to one of the Praetorian guard, he's in prison, which means that he has chained to one of the elite fighting members of the most devastating war machines ever known in history, a Roman soldier.
[time=1306] And he knows that the spiritual battle is an invisible one and an effort to connect with the stuff that you and I can find tangible.
[time=1314] He looks at this Roman soldier and says, I will liken the invisible spiritual battle and the warfare there to the warfare that is obviously visible that would have been pervasive in the minds of those to whom he wrote.
[time=1328] So under each of these points, I will try to explain the piece of armor first and briefly in physical warfare and then make the corollary into spiritual warfare.
[time=1335] "Gird your loins with truth." Every Roman soldier typically wore a full-body tunic.
[time=1342] It was nothing but a big huge piece of cloth with three holes, cut in it, one for the head and two for the arms, and it would be kind of the basis of his wardrobe or his military outfit.
[time=1351] And as you might expect, it would fall all the way down to his ankles for purposes of warmth and protection from the elements, which was fine when that was needed, but when they would go into hand-to-hand combat, that same tunic could pose a terrible threat.
[time=1365] The man could get caught up in his own garment.
[time=1368] The man could step on it. The man could fall over it.
[time=1370] It could be grabbed by another person.
[time=1373] And so what they would do as they would enter into battle is they would gird their loins.
[time=1377] They would take that long tunic and wrap it up and tuck it in and cinch it up under the leather belt that they typically wore.
[time=1385] So that their legs were free and they could move and they could dodge and they wouldn't trip and stumble over their own clothing.
[time=1393] In spiritual warfare, the girding of your loins is made clear in 1 Peter 1.13.
[time=1398] It says this, "Gird your minds for action." The thing that Peter is asking and the thing that Paul is asking here, that we gird up, that we cinch up, that we tuck in, that we don't let loose things hang on the outside, are the imaginations of our heart, of our mind.
[time=1415] The meaning is this, tuck in or cinch up the loose imagination of your mind.
[time=1419] You and I make ourselves incredibly vulnerable to the attack of Satan when we allow our imaginations to go places, they were never intended to go.
[time=1428] It's an amazing thing. God has given us this thing called a brain, and we humans and scientists and doctors still understand fully the power of the mind and the beauty of the mind and the wisdom of the mind.
[time=1438] It's an amazing thing. God has given each one of us an incredible gift.
[time=1443] It has the capacity to imagine, to see the future, to envision the future, to go places that we aren't there yet.
[time=1451] And what happens is when we get offended and we become angry, we can commission our imagination to have all kinds of angry thoughts, things we would say, things we would do, the way we would respond, and we can really infume and inflame our heart with this imagination as it runs down the path of anger. Don't do that.
[time=1470] Gird your loins up. Gird up the loins of your mind.
[time=1474] The same could be said of lust, and it's impossible to live in this day and age and not see a zillion lustful images across the screens of our lives all the time.
[time=1482] And the word of God says, "Do not commission your imagination to exploit and to fulfill and to walk down the path of that lust event, even if it's just in your mind." It's a loose garment.
[time=1494] You're going to trip. You're going to fall. Materialism or doubt, anxiety, self-deprecating thoughts, fear, all that stuff is the beginning of tripping yourself up in the battle against Satan.
[time=1506] You get caught in your own garment.
[time=1509] That's why it says in 2 Corinthians 10-5, "We are taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ." In other words, when some event occurs that produces anger in your heart, you choose to commission your mind in a way that is captive to the obedience of Christ, and Christ would speak to you of forgiveness and compassion and understanding and patience and benevolence.
[time=1529] He would not speak to you of a long tirade of revenge in that other person's life.
[time=1534] In the lustful encounter, the obedience to Christ would speak to you of seeing that other human being as an image bear valued by God and not to be exploited for simply sexual purposes and compassion and repentance would come into your heart at that moment and you would shut that whole scenario down, bringing your thoughts captive to the obedience of Christ.
[time=1554] You leave no room in your thought life for the development of sinful movement.
[time=1559] Had lunch this week with an elder in our church, it's always a privilege to talk with a man who's further along in years and more mature and was asking questions of his life and covered the business side of things and went on to the spiritual side of things.
[time=1572] He said, "You know, it's a great thing.
[time=1574] I'm experiencing that I've grown through a kind of a phase of my life where certain temptations that used to have a real grip on me have lost their grip.
[time=1583] They're still there, but the whole thing is much more in the category of victory for me."
[time=1589] Very excited, he said, "But I found that I've got new struggles that are I strong." He says, "For me now it's resentment, it's anger and resentment and I'm struggling being angry at people and being resentful of them." He says, "So I've decided now that I'm moving in my mind.
[time=1605] He said, "I'm going to win this game in my mind." And then he said this and I wrote it down as soon as lunch was over because it was so appropriate to the text.
[time=1611] He said this, "I'm walking around with a readiness to forgive." He is commissioning his heart and his mind to be in a state of readiness, not for resentment, but for forgiveness." It's an amazing, great wisdom. That's what this text talks about.
[time=1629] You gird up the loins of your mind when you cinch in and advance the possibilities that would move you in negative places.
[time=1636] You have a gal in our small group, Heidi and I meet with a small group on Wednesday nights, just four or five couples there and we've been meeting about a year and we're learning to love each other and enter into each other's situations and the hardships and the joys and all that stuff, you know, small group stuff.
[time=1649] And one of the gals came to small group two weeks ago and was by herself.
[time=1653] I said, "Where's your husband?" And she said, "Well, he's got on this weird shift at work.
[time=1656] He's got to work six weeks now, the night shift." So he won't be in small group for six weeks and trying to be sensitive, you know, and understanding and part of all that.
[time=1665] I said, "Well, that's going to be hard on you, isn't it, with the kids and all?
[time=1667] I mean, the schedule being so different. He won't be there to help." And she said, "Yes, it's going to be hard, but I'm really looking forward to the next six weeks because I'm going to make some unique and particular investments in the life of my kids." I said, "Wow, that's great." I said, "Well, you know, next week's week's, that's a long time.
[time=1682] You're probably going to get lonely." And some of the time you might share with your husband in the intimate ways and all that stuff.
[time=1687] I said, "You're not going to be there for you, isn't it?" Well, she said, "Yes, that's true. That'll be different. It won't be as intimate.
[time=1692] It won't be as personal and all that kind of stuff.
[time=1694] You know, I'm really excited about the time when he doesn't have to work like that.
[time=1697] That time is going to come to an end, and then we'll be able to be back in our normal schedule." And I said, "Well, you know, long time, and at six weeks, I mean, you could get discouraged over that amount of time." And she... I know, you'd think I was doing a bad thing.
[time=1709] I was just trying to be understanding it.
[time=1711] And she had the right answer for that.
[time=1714] And I walked away from the deal going, "My goodness, there it is.
[time=1718] She is honestly embracing the hardship of her life. She's thought through those categories, but she has a counter-attack measure. She has...
[time=1725] You know, the things are tucked right in there tight, and she knows exactly how she's going to strategize.
[time=1729] She's tough mentally. She's mentally tough, and she's ready, and she's going to win.
[time=1732] I think she is winning, given to this day.
[time=1734] Be easy for her to slump down into depression, and then fall into a whole bunch of other problems that later she'd have to fight her way out of.
[time=1741] But she's just right there on the edge, holding her mind sharp.
[time=1745] Some of you are saying this to yourself.
[time=1750] It's only my mind. It's no big deal.
[time=1753] I can entertain these sinful thoughts in my mind because it's only my mind that it's no big deal.
[time=1758] Let me tell you something. That comes straight out of hell.
[time=1761] You weren't original with that thought. That comes from Satan.
[time=1764] And if he can get you to believe that it's okay for you to go anywhere you want to with your imagination, he is one happy camper.
[time=1773] The truth of God's Word is this, that it is a major piece of your armor, what you do with your mind.
[time=1780] It is a hotbed of the spiritual battle.
[time=1783] And so we must be careful with the magazines and the books and the movies and the conversations and the television shows. I mean, everything that provides the seed thoughts needs to be carefully scrutinized.
[time=1795] And not only do we need to keep out the crud, we've got to make sure we continue to feed on the truth of God's Word so that the loins of our garment are tucked safely where they belong.
[time=1806] So a thought, reap an action.
[time=1809] So an action, reap a habit.
[time=1812] So a habit, reap a character.
[time=1814] So a character, reap a destiny.
[time=1818] It's just that easy. David knew it all too well.
[time=1822] David first thought about it before he did it.
[time=1824] They're on the rooftop when he should have been at battle looking down, gazing on the beautiful nakedness of Bathsheba.
[time=1830] Later he wrote these words in Psalm 1914, "Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight, O God my rock and my redeemer." You want to know what it means to do everything to stand firm?
[time=1843] It doesn't just mean you refuse sinful thoughts.
[time=1846] It doesn't just mean you shut down the sinful side.
[time=1849] What it means is you cultivate a mental capacity to worship God.
[time=1854] You say, "God, allow the meditations of my heart and mind to be an act of worship in your sight all the days of my life." I will not only keep what's wrong out of my head, I will begin to offer up continual sacrifices of appropriate God-honoring thoughts
[time=1871] that I hope will be found acceptable in your sight.
[time=1875] David went way past having to clean up his thought life and he went to a thought life of active worship.
[time=1884] Check point number two, verse 14.
[time=1887] Stand firm therefore having gritted your loins with truth, and here it is, having put on the breastplate of righteousness, the breastplate of righteousness.
[time=1896] In physical warfare it was a sleeveless piece of armor.
[time=1899] It covered the torso. It would have been made of metal.
[time=1902] Typically they bang it into shape and fit it around the guy as he goes off into battle, and it's to protect the vital organs.
[time=1909] It's one thing to get stabbed or hit with a spear or shot with an arrow through your arm or through your leg, and that's bad.
[time=1917] But try taking a hit in the torso where your heart or your lungs or your stomach get affected,
[time=1924] and as you know in that day and age they didn't call 911, there was no ambulance, there was no emergency service, there were no lung machines.
[time=1931] When you got hit in that area they just sat with you until you died.
[time=1935] It was a foregone conclusion.
[time=1940] Now you say what's the corollary in the spiritual world? We'll look at the phrase.
[time=1944] Put on the breastplate of righteousness.
[time=1947] What is the thing that protects us the vital organs of life in the spiritual battle and its righteousness, otherwise known as obedience?
[time=1956] It's a radical commitment to protecting the vital organs of life through obedience.
[time=1961] The Word of God is very, very clear on a whole bunch of issues.
[time=1966] There's a certain list of do's and there's a certain list of do's and don'ts.
[time=1969] Now mind you, Christianity is not bound up in the do's and the don'ts.
[time=1973] Christianity is a relationship, a love relationship with Christ, and He said, "If you love me, you'll keep my commandments." So don't forget the love thing, but realize this.
[time=1980] There's a double yellow line that runs through your life.
[time=1984] And the Word of God has pointed it out and it is said to you, "Do not cross the double yellow line into the oncoming traffic." It is certain sheer death.
[time=1994] Do not get drunk.
[time=1996] Do not cheat.
[time=1997] Do not steal.
[time=1999] Do not lie.
[time=2000] Do not lust.
[time=2001] Do not gossip.
[time=2002] Do not overeat.
[time=2003] Do not sleep too long.
[time=2005] Do not be lazy.
[time=2006] Do not give your life away to the things of disobedience.
[time=2009] Don't cross that line.
[time=2014] And the joy of obedience is not just that we stay away from certain things.
[time=2017] It's God puts the right stuff in front of us.
[time=2020] And He's where people have purpose, where people have organization.
[time=2022] We've got to be going somewhere and it's not enough just to be going away from evil.
[time=2026] He says, "Here's where you go.
[time=2027] Obey me by loving me with all your heart, mind, soul, and strength.
[time=2030] Obey me by loving people.
[time=2031] Obey me by rejoicing through your circumstances and serving me and giving financially and evangelizing and ministering with your spiritual gifts and being faithful all the days of your life." You see, this is so big.
[time=2043] This is so amazing.
[time=2044] Do you realize what happens?
[time=2046] When you, the Bible says that the Christian is in one of two states in every second.
[time=2050] Now we're always saved because we're born again and we're eternally secure.
[time=2053] But you're in one of two states in any given second.
[time=2055] You're either under the influence of the Spirit of God that's called walking by the Spirit, Galatians 5, or you are walking by the flesh.
[time=2062] All of us are in one of those two categories all the time.
[time=2067] And the reason that obedience is such a premium in the Word of God and would be reflected by this protecting of the vital organs is because when you commit a sin, you don't just have to deal with that sin.
[time=2079] You see, what you do is you take yourself out from underneath the influence of the Spirit of God and you put yourself in the category of being run by the flesh.
[time=2088] And the normal leading or filling of the Spirit, as we saw in Ephesians 5, it ceases in your
[time=2094] life.
[time=2095] The ministry of the Spirit of God is diminished at that point.
[time=2098] And you are given over to the power of the flesh.
[time=2100] You give yourself to that.
[time=2102] Immorality, it says, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions, envy, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these.
[time=2113] It's not just that act of disobedience.
[time=2116] It's that you move yourself into the realm of disobedience.
[time=2119] You cite your flesh and you thwart the ministry of the Spirit of God who wants to lead you and prompt you.
[time=2127] When under the power of the Spirit of God, it's love and joy and peace and patience and kindness and goodness and faithfulness and gentleness and self-control.
[time=2134] All the stuff we've got to be about.
[time=2137] So please understand that.
[time=2140] Please understand that your isolated, my isolated, little, active disobedience that nobody seems to see that might not even take very long is in reality a movement, a shifting of our heart to the place of rebellion where the flesh can then really run its course and where Satan can have full sway in our life.
[time=2156] And that's why when we do sin, we need to be so consistent and so faithful and so quick to repent at a real level and resubmit ourselves to the ministry of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2168] David knew all about that.
[time=2171] David taught some thoughts.
[time=2173] And then David moved himself under the power of the flesh to some places that he stayed for an entire year before he fully repented.
[time=2180] And then he wrote something like this and Psalm 139 he said, "Search me, O God, and know my heart and try me and know my anxious thoughts and see if there be any hurtful ways that there be any hurtful way in me and lead me in the way everlasting." See, that's what it means to be doing everything in your power to stand firm, having done everything
[time=2200] stand firm.
[time=2201] You don't just sort of want to be away from the sins in your life and you don't come over
[time=2207] to the edge where you're looking over just as close as you can to the sinful stuff in your life.
[time=2212] You say what David said, you give God full prerogative to search all of your heart, all of your thoughts and see if there's anything hurtful in there and then you give him full permission to lead you regardless of what that may mean into the path of obedience.
[time=2225] It's a radical, wholesale commitment away from sin and into the path of obedience.
[time=2232] Don't dance and don't flirt with sin.
[time=2236] Check point number three, found in verse 15.
[time=2240] And having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace.
[time=2245] Shod your feet.
[time=2246] Put the right shoes on, physical battle.
[time=2248] We're talking about boots today, sandals yesterday, right?
[time=2251] The Roman soldier had to be equipped with the kind of sandals that he could make those long marches, sometimes several hundred miles long, without getting blisters and infections so that when he gets to battle, his feet work and he's got a strong foundation with which to do battle.
[time=2265] Those same sandals have to not only be able to trek long distances but in the fight be able to get a good grip so he can have a strong solid foundation.
[time=2275] Now there's some disparage discrepancy in thought on this and I don't want to be too dogmatic, I'll just tell you what I think.
[time=2280] Some have said that the shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel means you've got to be all about evangelism.
[time=2285] And I think we need to be about evangelism but I don't think that's what this is saying in this text.
[time=2289] It's the preparation look of the gospel of peace.
[time=2293] It is the result of the gospel that isn't focused here.
[time=2296] It is the gospel which leads you to peace with God.
[time=2299] Now what does that mean?
[time=2300] You and I are to stand in the confidence of God's unconditional and irrational love for us.
[time=2306] When you and I are in battle and you and I are taking blows and we're getting hit and we're
[time=2312] trying to find something to stand on, the thing we're supposed to stand on like nothing else is the reality of God's irrational unconditional love for us, that nothing we will ever say or do will ever separate us from the love of Christ.
[time=2325] That's where you stand because it gets messy doesn't it?
[time=2329] And it gets confusing.
[time=2331] Satan had his way with Adam and Adam sinned and what did he do?
[time=2335] He went and he hid himself and he didn't hide himself from Eve, she was with him.
[time=2338] And he didn't hide from the animals, he hid from God.
[time=2342] And God came and found them and asked the rhetorical question, where are you?
[time=2346] Which was to point at the fact that Adam, you are hiding from me.
[time=2351] Of course in that case it was appropriate because there was shame and there was guilt and there was appropriate levels of self-contempt, but God sought Adam out and sacrificed those animals to cover over the sin that they might once again be together.
[time=2364] And Satan will do his very best to convince us that somehow we need to hide from God again.
[time=2374] Where there would have been normal confession of sin and restoration of fellowship and the cycle of life, Satan will seek somehow to undermine the foundation that in Christ we are utterly and totally forgiven for all of our sins past, present and future that the abounding grace of God super abounds over any of our sin and that there is mercy that is fresh and new at the dawn of each new day.
[time=2396] But Satan wants us to discount and mitigate and alter and minimize the love of God, experientially in our own hearts.
[time=2406] My favorite passages are these Ephesians 3 so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith.
[time=2412] Now listen, that you may be rooted and grounded in love and that you might be able to comprehend
[time=2419] with all the saints what is the breadth and the length and the height and the depth to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge that you might be filled up to all the fullness of God.
[time=2430] He can't say it any better.
[time=2431] He can't use any better terms.
[time=2433] What he's saying is this, you want to be rooted and grounded and you figure out just how much God loves you.
[time=2438] And you try to get ahold of the incomprehensible, the breadth and the length and the height and the depth of the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge.
[time=2445] What he's saying there is no matter how much you think Christ loves you, he loves you more than you think he does.
[time=2451] You're wildest imaginations about an undying love and an uncompromising love and an unconditional
[time=2457] love and an irrational love are not sufficient.
[time=2459] He loves you more than that.
[time=2464] Romans 8 says, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?" It's a rhetorical question and he brings the answer, nothing, nothing physical and nothing spiritual.
[time=2473] He says this, "Shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword." Now that's the physical stuff that might separate, nope, can't do it.
[time=2483] Then he moves to the other side, the spiritual side.
[time=2485] He says, "I'm convinced that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities." That's the good angels and the bad angels, the angels and the demons.
[time=2492] Nor the present, nor things come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other created things shall ever be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[time=2505] My question to you this morning is simple.
[time=2506] Do you feel like you need to hide from God today?
[time=2510] Is there something between you and God and is that something growing because you're making it into something that it ought not be?
[time=2516] If it is, then Satan's having his way with you.
[time=2523] I now have two teenage daughters.
[time=2528] It's an interesting way to live.
[time=2531] And Satan wants them both.
[time=2535] Satan knows their name, Satan has a plan.
[time=2538] Satan wants them both, promise you that, just like he wants your kids.
[time=2543] And the world wants my two teenage daughters, and there are these little demons that run around with skin on.
[time=2549] I call them teenage boys.
[time=2550] They want my daughters too.
[time=2559] Let me tell you one thing we're not going to do in my house.
[time=2562] We're not going to make love conditional.
[time=2564] We're not going to say I'll love you if you perform.
[time=2567] I'll love you if you're good enough.
[time=2570] I'll love you if you meet our standards.
[time=2573] I'll love you if you live up to our expectations.
[time=2576] That's something that's never going to get said in our house.
[time=2578] And I hope it never gets communicated, though I'm sure at times it does.
[time=2583] Because the last thing I want in the world is for my girls to feel like there's something
[time=2589] they can do, something they can say, something that they can become, which would break off the vital love relationship, which we have shared since their birth.
[time=2599] Because if somebody can get in between me and them, other than the guy that great Christian
[time=2605] white on that shining horse that's going to marry them at the end of the age.
[time=2609] Anybody but that gets in between me and them, and we're in trouble.
[time=2613] We're in trouble.
[time=2617] So I want to love them, whether they're smart or dumb.
[time=2621] Athletic, non-athletic, pretty, ugly, drunk, sober, pure, pregnant, home on time, home
[time=2632] late, good attitude, bad attitude, love my God, reject my God.
[time=2641] I love you because I don't love you based on what you do.
[time=2646] I love you based on who you are.
[time=2649] Now does that connect?
[time=2651] God is trying to say that to you this morning.
[time=2655] That's exactly how he feels about you.
[time=2658] That is why he feels that way about you.
[time=2661] And anything in your mind or heart that is different from that is not the truth.
[time=2667] And it's the beginning of satanic work in your heart and life.
[time=2676] You see, you can't fight the enemy if you believe in your heart that you're still at war with your own
[time=2682] commander.
[time=2684] You can't do it.
[time=2686] Okay, number four, checkpoint number four, verse 16.
[time=2689] Verse 16 talks about a shield of faith that is able to extinguish all the flaming
[time=2695] missiles of the evil one.
[time=2697] Now in the physical battle, you see in these movies, I think they're probably pretty accurate to history where these great forces come against each other and they stop about 100 yards apart and then the archers start the battle and the archers fire these flaming arrows and those would have been, you know, covered with cloth and then pitch and then they light the pitch and then they fire the thing and when the pitch hits something hard, the pitch spatters and ignites anything that it touches.
[time=2719] And it didn't take, you know, the opposing army very long to figure out what they needed was a big something to be able to stop that thing before it penetrated.
[time=2727] And so they came up with big shields, two and a half usually by four and a half feet, you know, two and a half wide, four and a half feet tall and they covered it with water-soaked stuff on the front and so it could take the blow and diminish the burn and they could then continue to move closer and closer until finally the battle started.
[time=2742] I mean, that part of the battle started.
[time=2745] Spiritual battle, spiritual corollary, the flaming missiles.
[time=2748] What are the flaming missiles of Satan?
[time=2750] I don't know for sure, but I think they are these.
[time=2752] They are the major trials and setbacks that Satan brings into your life.
[time=2756] I mean, the big ones that hit hard and stay long, the loss of a loved one to cancer,
[time=2762] the failed career, the broken marriage, the rebellious child.
[time=2767] These are the heavy incoming long-term big time devastation stuff.
[time=2771] And I don't understand it, but if you read the book of Job, sometimes the Lord, in His love and through the grid of His love gives permission for the stuff that happened in our lives.
[time=2779] And Satan begins the volley, the big, huge stuff that wants to shake us to the core.
[time=2784] And the design of his flaming missiles is to get us to mitigate against the character of God and say, "If God really loved me, He wouldn't let this kind of thing happen to me." Listen to Proverbs 30, verses 5 and 6.
[time=2797] You want to know what the shield of faith is?
[time=2799] It says this, "God is a shield to those who take refuge in Him.
[time=2804] God is your shield, and you embrace Him through faith." And as Satan's plan A works out in your life, which would be a major trial into your life so that you will question God, His goodness, His faithfulness, His righteousness, His justice and His benevolence.
[time=2821] If you can get into a trial long enough that you begin to mitigate against the pure holiness of God, then Satan has you right where he wants you.
[time=2829] And there are two responses that everybody all believers have in the midst of a trial.
[time=2833] And only two, you either turn against God, you may not reject Christianity and quit coming to this church, but in your heart you get angry at Him and you get mad at Him and you get bitter and you stop your prayer life and you stop your devotions and you begin to move away from God.
[time=2848] Or you allow that trial to drive you back into the presence of God and you're able, through the midst of it and at the end of it, to say with new conviction, "God is good and God is righteous and God is just and God is benevolent." We had prayer this morning with a man whose wife had committed adultery and with the elders, we laid hands on this guy as it says in James 5, had a tremendous time of prayer and he made a statement before we prayed for him and it was just a beautiful statement.
[time=2875] He said, "I am so thankful to God that in the midst of this enormous trial in my life,
[time=2881] that God has allowed me to get closer to Him rather than further away." The flaming missiles, my friends, they're coming, they're coming into my life and they're coming into your life.
[time=2893] And there's two responses. You either grab a hold of God, the shield, your protector, and you reaffirm His nature and His character, or you allow that crisis to make you question Him
[time=2904] and loosen your grip on Him and distance yourself from Him.
[time=2908] Psalm 73 says, "Whom have I in heaven but the and besides the I desire nothing on earth."
[time=2914] Did you hear that? "Whom have I in heaven but God and besides God I desire nothing on this earth.
[time=2919] My flesh and my heart may fail me but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever."
[time=2926] Romans 8 says that God is the one who works all things together for good.
[time=2929] Proverbs 8 said, "Blessed is the man who listens to God." Matthew 7 says, "God is the one who will never give His child a stone when they ask for a fish." James 1 says, "God is the giver of every good thing bestowed in every perfect gift." Philippians 4 says, "God is the one who was promised to supply all of our needs according to His riches in the glory of Christ Jesus." Ephesians 1 says, "God is the one who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ."
[time=2956] How are you doing this morning? Moving closer to or further away.
[time=2959] Questioning the character of God or reaffirming it.
[time=2962] Check point number 5.
[time=2964] Check point number 5 is the helmet of salvation.
[time=2968] The helmet of salvation.
[time=2971] And of course in battle, the helmet of battle was absolutely essential.
[time=2976] I mean you run out there in this big horde of guys and everybody's got a big broad sword or a big old hatchet or an axe or something and everybody's flailing stuff everywhere.
[time=2983] You could die by accident.
[time=2984] I mean you could die on the glance of another man's sword.
[time=2987] And if you take it to the head, you're done.
[time=2989] I mean it's just this vital sense and peace of equipment that must be had.
[time=2994] You see what's the corollary in the spiritual battle?
[time=2997] 1 Thessalonians 5 says this, that the helmet is the hope of salvation.
[time=3001] The helmet is the hope of salvation.
[time=3005] What does that mean?
[time=3007] Once again the picture here is hardship of battle.
[time=3011] It's the struggle. It's the fear of losing.
[time=3013] It's the assault of Satan on your life.
[time=3016] This is probably not one of the happier times or seasons in life.
[time=3019] And when you're in the midst of that battle, you have got to hang on to the hope of your salvation.
[time=3024] Now what is that? It is this, that there is coming a day when you will no longer have to fight Satan.
[time=3028] You will no longer be consigned to the sin cursed earth.
[time=3031] You are going to heaven, the glories of heaven, the wonders of heaven, the radiance of heaven and the very presence of Christ.
[time=3038] It's the place where all of our tears will be wiped away, no death, no mourning, no crying, no pain.
[time=3043] Just Christ and the radiance of Christ causing us to be illumined as we share His glory.
[time=3049] Satan wants to rob us of that hope.
[time=3052] Satan wants us to live for the now, the here and the present.
[time=3056] Satan wants to say that the future is not worth waiting for, not worth sacrificing for, not worth, you know, waiting on God to give us all of eternity.
[time=3066] And the victory is found as heaven becomes more tangible to us because we commit our hearts more and more and more to it.
[time=3075] And as we do that, the world has less and less a grip on our hearts.
[time=3080] 1 Corinthians 15, 58 says, "Therefore my beloved brethren, be steadfast and movable always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your toil is not in vain in the Lord."
[time=3090] Paul wrote that at a low point in his life, didn't see a lot of fruit, but he had hope.
[time=3097] The true and living God would make something of his life's work and at the end he would be free from the battle and forever in heaven.
[time=3105] Abraham, Joseph, Moses, David, Peter, Paul, they all came to breaking points in their lives where they wanted to give up and live for the present.
[time=3113] And they all turned instead, as Hebrews 11 says, to grab ahold of the future.
[time=3119] And they confessed, they were not living for today, but they were living for a city whose architect and builder was God.
[time=3129] 1 Thessalonians 5, 8 says, "God has not destined us for wrath.
[time=3133] The destination, the end of our life, when we're done here on earth, it is not about wrath, it says instead, but for obtaining salvation."
[time=3141] How clear is heaven in your eyesight these days?
[time=3144] How willing are you to live for eternity and not for today?
[time=3149] Check point number 6.
[time=3152] Verse 17 says, "Take the helmet of salvation and then finally the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God."
[time=3159] Now obviously in physical warfare the main instrument of doing battle was both defensively and offensively your sword.
[time=3166] There were several kinds of swords, there was the big long broad sword, about four feet long, and there was a little thing the Greek calls the Makayra, which was about an 18 inch long dagger.
[time=3174] And this is the one when the big stuff was no longer there, and it was just you and this other guy, you grabbed for that thing.
[time=3181] This is the hand to hand combat that you see Jesus having with Satan in the wilderness in Matthew chapter 4.
[time=3187] In spiritual warfare it is the word of God, it is the thing that you hold on your lap.
[time=3192] And this is not a book written by men as much as it is the inspired word of God.
[time=3197] And the power of God resides in this true and living word of God, in errant and perfect.
[time=3203] And the same power that God used in his word when he said, "Let there be light." The same creative power that brought about all that you see and all that exists and the same creative power of his word that causes it to be sustained and function
[time=3216] as he wants it to function is the same power that is resident in this true and living word of God.
[time=3222] And that is why when Jesus after 40 days of fasting being hauled off into the wilderness all by himself, no friends to go hand to hand face to face,
[time=3230] nose to nose with Satan himself was tempted three times, and in all three times Jesus responded with very short responses from God's word.
[time=3239] He didn't articulate the wisdom of the world, he didn't talk himself into obedience as the best policy, he just said,
[time=3245] "Look, here is what God's word says on the matter, and he grabs it and does battle."
[time=3253] That's why David said, "Thy word have I hid in my heart, that I might not sin against thee." An effective warrior for the cause of Christ will know their personal weaknesses, their areas of character flaw, the places where they are most susceptible,
[time=3264] and they will memorize portions and passages of Scripture that act as that little macayra in their hand as the evil one comes to tempt and to deceive.
[time=3272] And the word of God will cut it straight all the way to the bone and the marrow, and it will divide the error from the truth,
[time=3278] and it will give you clear passage to obedience, finding your way out of that trial, finding your way out of and through that temptation to disobedience.
[time=3287] No God's word, study God's word, develop your own personal convictions about God's word, and then yield and wield it as a mighty weapon in your spiritual battle.
[time=3301] It's great, isn't it just to be in God's word this morning together?
[time=3306] It's a spiritual battle we fight.
[time=3309] It is not one of flesh and blood.
[time=3313] And again, in this effort to get the invisible to be tangible, Paul likens it to the Roman soldier.
[time=3324] But Peter did a different thing. He grabbed a different analogy. Peter said that the devil is like a roaring lion.
[time=3335] He's always on the prowl seeking someone to devour.
[time=3342] I've been reading a book lately by Peter Kepstick. He's an internationally acclaimed big game hunter down in Africa, and an author.
[time=3351] I've written several books, one of them's a classic. The one I'm going to read from this morning as I close is as he tells about the lion in his classic work, Death in the Long Rest.
[time=3362] Now I invite you to envision this, be there, and think about your adversary and his parallels to the lion.
[time=3371] As July, the half-breed Mazua Bushman sat over his cigarette and beer he saw movement from his own hut.
[time=3379] Across the shadowy compound came his son, seven years old, his only living child.
[time=3385] Sleepily, the boy walked past the old man to relieve himself at the edge of the bush, and July watched him pass.
[time=3392] Neither knew that Death waited only a few feet away.
[time=3395] The big male leopard had lain flat against the cool sand for more than two hours, watching the camp from the thick bush just past the first ring of deep black shadows.
[time=3406] He had seen the strange, hairless baboons feeding around their fires, then with much chattering going into their grass caves where they slept.
[time=3415] Only one old male had stayed in the open, and the leopard sized up the best approach through the dense bush to slaughter him from behind.
[time=3424] Then the young one had come out of the cave and was walking directly, stupidly, right at him.
[time=3429] Without the smallest sound he bellyed to the edge of the winter-dry brush near the opening of the compound.
[time=3434] His seven feet of steely muscles rippled hard beneath the rosetts of his glossy dappled hide, his hind claws digging into the sandy earth to grip for his charge.
[time=3445] At the very edge of the light's hollow the child stopped, fumbling with his loin apron, and at that instant the leopard burst forward from the murk, a silent, hurtling streak of death.
[time=3458] Quicker than thought he was on the boy.
[time=3461] The impact drove the child backward into the circle of light where, with the leopard on him, he turned open mouth to his father paralyzed with shock and pain.
[time=3471] Ignoring the horse screaming, shout from July, the big cat, executed the boy with a single crushing bite at the base of the head.
[time=3481] And grabbing him with long fangs across the middle leap back into the bush and the blackness.
[time=3489] True story.
[time=3492] Kepstik goes on to say about the leopard besides his incredible strength. He moves at blinding speed from close quarters and is noted for his patience, calculating intelligence and hair raising ferocity and boldness.
[time=3506] Many natural history books claim that he is afraid of men, but I don't know a professional hunter or game officer who would agree with that statement.
[time=3513] He's shy, secretive, yes, but he's afraid of nothing.
[time=3518] Leopards frequently, listen, leopards frequently live very close to man's habitations, picking off a stray cow or goat, even taking a man child if they think they can get away with it.
[time=3531] And then he says they usually do.
