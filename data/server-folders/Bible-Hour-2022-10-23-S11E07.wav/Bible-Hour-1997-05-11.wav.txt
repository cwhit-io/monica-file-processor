[time=30] This is the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=51] Thank you for joining us.
[time=52] This week we begin a series on the life of David, a man after God's own heart.
[time=57] David was a shepherd boy, giant killer, cave dweller, poet, musician, warrior, a
[time=63] dolderer, murderer, and king.
[time=65] Today we begin our series with a look at the story of David and Goliath.
[time=70] Now let's join our service.
[time=71] How about this one?
[time=74] Wow, that's too pretty.
[time=78] This to playing.
[time=83] And this, hmm.
[time=89] Ooh, that's too expensive.
[time=92] There aren't any dresses left in the city to look at, Mother.
[time=94] We've seen them all.
[time=96] Look, why don't you let me make the dedication dress for you?
[time=100] I would really love to do it, and it would mean so much more.
[time=103] There isn't enough time.
[time=104] It's next Sunday.
[time=105] But all I've got is time.
[time=107] Please let me do this.
[time=109] You know, if your father would hear, he'd agree with me.
[time=112] Have you noticed that for the past six years since Dad died, he seems to agree with you a lot more than he did when he was alive?
[time=119] Your father and I got along splendidly.
[time=122] We had our little disagreements, but we never let the sun go down on our anger.
[time=127] It must have been the summer you lived in Alaska.
[time=131] Your father and I just knew how to disagree, agreeably.
[time=135] Oh, you mean like my 12th birthday?
[time=137] Then Dad decided to get me a basketball hoop for the garage without consulting you first.
[time=143] Not that again.
[time=144] For two weeks, you just glared out the window at us every time we played.
[time=148] Eventually, we couldn't take it any longer.
[time=151] Well, it was your decision to take it down.
[time=153] I was offered a bribe, a huffy stingray with pink and white streamers off the handlebars.
[time=160] Dad took it down and you got me a bicycle instead.
[time=163] Well, it was more becoming a girl your age.
[time=166] It was a bribe.
[time=168] Well, let's see how you and Philip do after 20 years of marriage, knock on wood.
[time=174] Oh, I wish we would have had you dedicated as a baby.
[time=178] Then we could have used the same dress.
[time=180] Well, you didn't.
[time=182] I know.
[time=183] Your father and I came to the Lord later on in our marriage.
[time=186] Let's see, how old were you?
[time=188] Oh, I was eight.
[time=190] I remember because I got to go to my first vacation Bible school that summer.
[time=194] I remember.
[time=195] You won that little trophy for memorizing the most scripture verses in a week.
[time=200] I remember you standing up there reciting those verses with your head down the entire time, just twisting the hem of your dress.
[time=207] You were so shy.
[time=209] I was also cheating.
[time=211] I had the verses written out and pinned on the underside of my hem.
[time=215] What?
[time=217] There was no way I was going to let Timothy Meadows beat me.
[time=220] Oh, I hated him with a vengeance, always sitting in the front row, knowing all the answers, always called on to lead the hand motions in every song, first in line for
[time=231] cookies and Kool-Aid, winking at me all week long.
[time=235] He was devastated when I beat him.
[time=238] I had no idea you cheated.
[time=240] I am so ashamed for you.
[time=242] You'll get over it.
[time=243] I did.
[time=244] Besides, it's too late to ground me.
[time=247] I remember, I beat him on a verse in Luke.
[time=250] Something like, "No man can serve two masters, and you cannot serve both God and money."
[time=258] Timothy Meadows?
[time=259] Yeah, he's a banker here in town now.
[time=262] I just can't believe that you cheated.
[time=264] Do you know what?
[time=267] Your mommy is just full of little surprises.
[time=270] Come here, sweetheart.
[time=272] Say, how is Philip with the baby?
[time=276] Oh, he's great.
[time=278] Every time he's around her, he's a babbling idiot.
[time=280] Well, what's his excuse the rest of the time?
[time=284] I just can't believe he isn't here with you to help pick out a dress for her.
[time=288] Mother, you know he has class.
[time=290] If he wants to hold on to his assistant fellowship in the psychology department, he's got to show initiative.
[time=296] It's very competitive.
[time=297] Well, I certainly hope he finds time to get a haircut before Sunday.
[time=302] Does he have a proper suit to wear?
[time=304] Yes, mother.
[time=305] And shoes?
[time=306] Yes, mother.
[time=307] Now, not Birkenstock's sandals.
[time=309] I mean real dress shoes.
[time=310] He has shoes.
[time=312] Goodness, I just don't know what I would do if your daddy ever showed up at church wearing sandals.
[time=318] You'd probably faint and then disown us.
[time=322] No?
[time=323] You disown us first and then you'd faint.
[time=326] Honey, is she eating well?
[time=329] You know, it is important to get her on a regular schedule, so it gives her a sense of order in her life and she knows what to expect.
[time=337] She's only three months old.
[time=338] I know, but it's never too early to start.
[time=341] I mean, it didn't hurt you, Annie.
[time=343] Oh, I don't know.
[time=345] Phil says there are new studies that show that a patterned routine at an early age can inhibit their creativity.
[time=352] Maybe that's why I can never color outside the lines.
[time=354] Oh, nonsense.
[time=356] Babies need a sense of pattern.
[time=358] It gives them a feeling of security.
[time=361] We may do a few things differently with you.
[time=364] Uh-oh.
[time=365] One, I promise not to make you eat something green with every meal.
[time=369] And if you want a basketball hoop for your twelfth birthday, you can have one.
[time=372] Oh, heaven, help us.
[time=374] You can wear earrings when you turn 18.
[time=377] And on Sunday evenings, I may even let you wear slacks to church.
[time=382] Oh, Lord, come and take me home.
[time=386] And we promise never, never to raise a hand to you.
[time=390] Now wait a minute.
[time=392] You mean you're never going to spank her?
[time=394] There are other ways to discipline a child, Mom.
[time=397] We're no longer in the dark ages.
[time=399] In fact, Phil says that we are a generation of damaged psyches, and that there's no telling how much untold harm has been done to our self-concept by our parents spanking us.
[time=409] Oh, really?
[time=410] That, you know, somebody must have beaten him with a stupid stick.
[time=415] That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard of.
[time=419] Now your father and I disciplined you according to the scriptures.
[time=423] You're saying spankings are biblical?
[time=424] That's right.
[time=425] Now it says in the Bible that when children misbehave, the rod of correction will drive it far from them.
[time=432] Well, Phil says we'll be using time out.
[time=436] Oh, great.
[time=437] I'll get you matching referee shirts.
[time=439] Oh, dear.
[time=440] I know that times have changed, and being a parent today is so much different from yesterday.
[time=446] In my generation, Spock was the baby doctor.
[time=450] In your generation, he's a Vulcan.
[time=453] You did all right, Mom.
[time=454] I could have done worse.
[time=456] Well, you just do the very best that you can, and you pray for a lot of grace from God to help fix your mistakes.
[time=464] Why won't you let me make the dress for you?
[time=467] Oh, all right.
[time=469] Really?
[time=470] You mean it?
[time=471] Yes, I'd like that.
[time=472] Oh, great.
[time=473] Oh, dear.
[time=474] You know what.
[time=475] I have just got hundreds of dresses at home that we can pick from.
[time=478] But fun.
[time=479] Well, I know that we'll find something that you'll just love.
[time=482] I will make the most beautiful dress.
[time=484] It'll be darling.
[time=485] I'm sure it will, and it will be a precious, deep-saked that she can give to her daughter.
[time=491] You know, I don't think you ever stop being a parent.
[time=496] I know you never stop caring.
[time=498] I wouldn't want you to.
[time=500] She really is beautiful, isn't she?
[time=503] Yes, she is.
[time=506] Just like her mother.
[time=509] When you were small, I could tell, When you were hurt or sad, you would cry.
[time=537] And I would try to ease the pain you had.
[time=547] I'd rock you gently late at night, And kiss the pain away, In the morning it
[time=561] would be okay.
[time=565] I know your hurts are bigger now, In places I can't touch, though I can try.
[time=576] I know that I can never do enough.
[time=585] I'd rock you gently if I could, And kiss the pain away, if only I could make it all okay.
[time=603] So I commend you to the Father, Who can wrap his arms around you.
[time=613] He'll calm your fears, Find your wounds much better than I can do.
[time=623] And he'll be with you forever, Wherever you may go.
[time=633] So I commend you to the Father, Who loves you so.
[time=657] My greatest joy will come one day, When you will start home, your love and life
[time=667] Will grow in time to children of your own.
[time=676] So rock them gently while you can, And kiss their pain away, And know the Lord
[time=690] will make it all okay.
[time=694] So I commend you to the Father, Who can wrap his arms around you.
[time=703] He'll calm your fears, And find your wounds much better than I can do.
[time=713] And he'll be with you forever, Wherever you may go.
[time=723] So I commend you to the Father, Who loves you so.
[time=736] And he'll be with you forever, Wherever you may go.
[time=761] And the things of you, You find security, Resisting all the changes
[time=776] that days and years can bring.
[time=792] He'll be with you forever, Wherever you may go.
[time=850] Hear the Spirit calling to wake the living dead, To reach the heart of masses, Who
[time=861] cry out for living red, A rise of mighty army, Take up the shield and sword, For the
[time=877] rest is golden lamb, Beside the open door, Is the new and fresh of loyalty, His spirit,
[time=896] Calling you to God, Was gone through the door, For the Lord will go by You, Into a greater
[time=912] world, You never know, Where He leads me, I will follow, And where He leads me, I will
[time=937] follow, Into a greater world, You never know before,
[time=962] He'll be with you forever, Wherever you may go, Is gone through the door,
[time=982] Or the Lord will go by You, Into a greater world,
[time=991] He'll be with you forever, Wherever you may go, Is gone through the door,
[time=1007] Wherever you may go, The verse up there on the screen is one of the most intriguing
[time=1033] verses, At least to me, in all the Old Testament, 2 Chronicles 16, 9, For the eyes of the Lord
[time=1041] move to and fro throughout the earth, That He may strongly support those whose heart
[time=1047] is completely His.
[time=1050] It describes the fact that God is engaged in an active, insightful search, and He is looking for a person.
[time=1058] This search is selective.
[time=1060] It is discriminating.
[time=1063] He is not looking for the simple, or the gifted, the wealthy, or the poor, the beautiful, or the ugly, the educated, or the ignorant.
[time=1070] He has a completely different criteria.
[time=1073] He is looking at the heart.
[time=1075] He is actively and insightfully searching the world over to support wholly the people
[time=1081] whose heart are completely His.
[time=1084] It's an amazing thought.
[time=1087] For the next five weeks, we're going to have the privilege of studying the life of the only man in Scripture who is twice called a man with a heart after God or a man after
[time=1097] God's own heart.
[time=1099] His name is David.
[time=1102] David, the shepherd boy, giant killer, cave dweller, poet, musician, warrior, adulterer,
[time=1110] murderer, and king.
[time=1113] RC Sproul said of David that he was the Renaissance man.
[time=1117] He was indeed a world-class poet, writing over one half of the Psalms, a gifted, skillful
[time=1123] musician selected among all the musicians of the nation to console a demon-possessed
[time=1129] or demon-oppressed king, David an invincible military warrior and commander, leader extraordinaire,
[time=1137] the greatest king in Israel's history.
[time=1141] One of his own countrymen, speaking of David before he reached the tender age of 17, said
[time=1147] this about David, "Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse, the Bethlemite, who is a skillful
[time=1154] musician, a mighty man of valor, a warrior, one prudent in speech, and a handsome man
[time=1160] and the Lord is with him." None of those great attributes or talents or gifts or accomplishments make his life
[time=1170] worth studying.
[time=1171] It is the fact that he had a heart for God that makes his life worth our study.
[time=1178] In 1 Samuel 13, verses 13 to 14, it says this, "And Samuel said to Saul, 'Samuel was the
[time=1185] great prophet of God, and Saul was the then reigning king.'" Samuel brings rebuke upon the king Saul by saying this, "You have acted foolishly.
[time=1194] You have not kept the commandment of the Lord your God, which he commanded you, for now the Lord would have established your kingdom over Israel forever, but now your kingdom
[time=1203] shall not endure." Now here it is, "The Lord has sought out for himself a man after his own heart, and
[time=1212] the Lord has appointed him as ruler over his people, because you have not kept what the Lord commanded you." The man Samuel is referring to is none other than David.
[time=1224] In contrast to King Saul, who was not chosen by God but by the people, and chosen by the people because he was tall, dark, and handsome, he turned out to be a thin-skinned, hot-tempered
[time=1234] man who was given to depression, whose greatest fault was that he disobeyed God.
[time=1239] He failed to honor the God of Israel, and as a result, as you have seen in that passage, God rejected him and took the throne away from him and gave it to a different man.
[time=1249] God said, "What I need is a man with a heart, a whole heart for me." And so he began this insightful search, this exacting scrutiny of all the hearts of Israel
[time=1260] and found in David a heart that was completely his.
[time=1266] The place that we will begin our study of his life is found in 1 Samuel 17, and if you'd like to join me there, you can read from the text or the verses should come up on the screen as we move along.
[time=1278] This is early in David's life, he is, again, not yet 17 years of age.
[time=1285] The scene is established in chapter 17, verse 3, in the Philistines, stood on the mountain on one side, while Israel stood on the mountain on the other side with the valley between them.
[time=1294] That is the valley of Elah, the valley of Elah, and the valley of Elah should not be pictured
[time=1301] in your mind as a sharp canyon, it was about a mile across, and the Philistines were on this side, bibwacked here, and the Israelites were bibwacked over here, and then a gradual
[time=1311] half-mile descent would lead from either side until the streambed was found in the middle of them.
[time=1316] And for who knows whatever reason they had found themselves in a standoff, a comparative advantage couldn't be found, and so they were waiting and thinking and strategizing and hoping something would come along that would allow the battle to fall in their favor.
[time=1329] Nothing really is going on except what is happening in verse 4, there is a great champion.
[time=1333] It says there are then a great champion came out from the armies of the Philistines named Goliath from Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.
[time=1343] Now that means to us he was nine feet, nine inches tall, nine feet, nine inches tall,
[time=1350] the man would make Kelly Bird look short, who is six-seven, who I refused to hug because
[time=1357] he makes me feel too small.
[time=1360] Verse 5, "And he had a bronze helmet on his head, and he was clothed with a scale of armor,
[time=1366] which weighed 5,000 shekels of bronze.
[time=1369] The stuff the guy put on to go into battle was 125 pounds in weight."
[time=1375] Might have weighed more than David at this time in his life.
[time=1378] He also had bronze grieves on his legs, shin guards, as we would know them, and a bronze
[time=1384] javelin slung between his shoulders.
[time=1387] And the shaft of his spear was like a weaver's beam, and the head of his spear weighed 600 shekels of iron, that's 16 pounds.
[time=1395] Just the head of his spear, and his shield carrier also walked before him.
[time=1402] This is needless to say, this is an imposing figure.
[time=1405] This is a giant, literally truly a giant.
[time=1409] And he comes to make a taunt against the living God in his armies, verse 8.
[time=1416] And he stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel and said to them, "Why do you come out to draw up in battle array?
[time=1421] Am I not the Philistine and you servants of Saul?
[time=1426] Choose a man for yourselves and let him come down to me.
[time=1428] If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will be your servants.
[time=1432] But if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall become our servants and serve us." Again the Philistine said, "I defy the ranks of Israel this day.
[time=1443] Give me a man that we may fight together." Now this man didn't do this once, he didn't do it twice.
[time=1451] He did it two times a day for 40 days, look at verse 16, and the Philistine came forward morning and evening for 40 days and took his stand.
[time=1462] Over and over and over and over and over and over again this Philistine stood at the bottom of the ravine and bellowed out his rebuke against the true and living God.
[time=1474] When you say what was the reaction of Saul, the great and mighty King Saul and all of Israel, verse 11, "When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed
[time=1485] and greatly terrified." The Word of God does not speak lightly here, they were absolutely shaking in their boots.
[time=1494] They were to the core of their being flush with fear at the thought of facing this great
[time=1500] giant.
[time=1505] And so they are in a great standoff, and the great Philistine continues to herald his taunt and the Israelites continue to quake in their boots until David shows up.
[time=1515] Now David, at no business being in this battle he was a boy, but his dad, Jesse, had a lot of sons and three of David's older brothers were in this battle and were at this point and were encamped on that mountain.
[time=1527] And so Jesse wanted to know how they were doing.
[time=1530] And so he sends David along with a wagon and a cart and a bunch of stuff, food and refreshments and all that kind of stuff.
[time=1536] And he sends David along to the point of battle so that he can A) replenish the needs of his brothers and then B) bring news home as to the health of the well-being of the three boys.
[time=1547] So David shows up on the scene and in verse 23 we can pick the narrative up there it says, "And as David was talking with them, behold the champion, the Philistine from Gath named
[time=1558] Goliath was coming up from the army of the Philistines and he spoke these same words and David heard them." Verse 24 "When all the men of Israel saw the man they fled from him and were greatly afraid." Can't you see this?
[time=1573] David has no idea about the Philistine, he's got no idea what's going on.
[time=1576] He gets in the middle of a bunch of army guys, he's trying to catch up on what's happening.
[time=1580] All of a sudden the Goliath thing happens and he's standing all by himself because everybody ran away.
[time=1585] I mean they just were terrified and they fled from his presence.
[time=1591] He catches up with them.
[time=1592] Verse 26 "As two very interesting questions, then David spoke to the men who were standing by him saying, 'What will be done for the man who kills the Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel?' And one is, 'What in the world, how come nobody's down or fighting that guy?'
[time=1608] Now in the ancient world there were great prizes and bounty offered to the valiant who would go and fight the impossible situation.
[time=1616] In fact, later you'd find out that Saul had offered several things, one of which was his own daughter in marriage and as you'll find out that by the way was no prize.
[time=1626] And then you could also, sorry, you and your whole family could live tax-free for the rest
[time=1632] of your lives.
[time=1633] There were other incentives.
[time=1635] But he's asking a beginning question, anybody even want the prize?
[time=1641] Then the second question comes in verse 26, "For who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should taunt the armies of the living God?" Now there's the real question, do you understand what it means to be uncircumcised?
[time=1655] Circumcision was a sign of the covenant that God gave to his chosen people to say, "In a physical outward manifestation I am committed to you and you are committed to me and I will
[time=1665] protect you and I will lead you and I will guide you and I will make you prominent." And he is saying, "There is a man down there who has no promises from our God who is not
[time=1675] circumcised.
[time=1676] He is estranged from God.
[time=1679] Do we or don't we have the true in living God?
[time=1681] Are we or aren't we circumcised?
[time=1685] Has he made a covenant with us or hasn't he?
[time=1687] What are we doing letting some man outside the covenant of God threaten the truth and the veracity of the promises of our God is essentially what he asks in verse 26.
[time=1696] If you won't do it for money, what in the world are we doing standing around when there
[time=1702] is some uncircumcised guy down there taunting our God and all the promises that our God has made?
[time=1708] Well, word gets around, David is upset about this and so they get David an audience with
[time=1715] King Saul, look at verse 32, David said to Saul, "That no man's heart fail in account
[time=1721] of this Philistine, your servant will go and fight with him."
[time=1727] Then Saul said to David, "You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him.
[time=1732] For you are but a youth, while he has been a warrior from his youth, I find this very intriguing.
[time=1737] Do you know who is the most likely candidate to walk down that half mile slope and take on Goliath?
[time=1741] Saul.
[time=1743] He was elected to be the king because he was head and shoulders above all of his countrymen.
[time=1747] If we're going to send giant against giant, we're going to send Saul against Goliath.
[time=1752] And besides that he's the king who better to stand for the honor and the glory of God.
[time=1758] And in the midst of this little boy, this 17-year-old David, he says, "You're not able
[time=1764] to go against the Philistine," and he's hard, he's thinking, "But I sure hope you do because I don't want to.
[time=1770] Forty days have gone by, two times a day.
[time=1772] I have had to find something else to think about other than the nagging promptings of the Holy Spirit that it should be me down there at the bottom of that ravine." Well, David says, "I don't think my size matters."
[time=1787] Verse 35.
[time=1788] He tells a story about when he was tending the flock there.
[time=1791] He was a shepherd boy.
[time=1792] And one of the great hazards of being a shepherd boy is that there are lions and there are bears in that part of the world and they will attack the herd, the flock.
[time=1799] And that had happened to him.
[time=1802] Verse 35, "I went out after him, meaning the beast, and attacked him and rescued it from his mouth, taking the sheep now out of the lion or the bear's mouth.
[time=1812] And when he rose up against me, I seized him by his beard and struck him and killed him.
[time=1820] Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear." Now watch.
[time=1823] And this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them since he has taunted the armies
[time=1829] of the living God.
[time=1831] Well, then there's this hilarious scene where Saul tries to outfit David in his military
[time=1837] garb and it's like trying to put a 52 long on a 39 regular him.
[time=1840] It just doesn't work.
[time=1842] You know, David gets all this stuff on, girds the sword over him, and then the text says and he tried to walk, which obviously means he couldn't.
[time=1849] So he sheds all that stuff.
[time=1852] Gets rid of that.
[time=1853] Just going to be who he is.
[time=1854] Now watch.
[time=1856] Verse 40.
[time=1856] "And he took his stick in his hand and chose for himself five smooth stones from the brook
[time=1864] and put them in the shepherd's bag which he had, even in his pouch, and his sling was in his hand, and he approached the Philistine.
[time=1872] Then the Philistine came on and approached David with the shield bear in front of him.
[time=1876] When the Philistine looked and saw David, he distained him for he was but a youth and ruddy with a handsome appearance.
[time=1882] And the Philistine said to David, "Am I a dog that you come to me with sticks?" And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
[time=1890] Imagine what that would have sounded like.
[time=1892] The Philistine also said to David, "Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds
[time=1898] of the sky and the beasts of the field." Then David said to him, "You come to me with sword and spirit and a javelin, but I come
[time=1909] to you in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have taunted.
[time=1916] This day the Lord will deliver you up into my hands and I will strike you down and remove your head from you, and I will give the dead bodies of the army of the Philistines this day to the birds of the sky and the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may
[time=1931] know that there is a God in Israel, and that all the assembly may know that the Lord does not deliver by sword or by spear, for the battle is the Lord's and he will give you into our hands." Then it happened.
[time=1947] Look at verse 48.
[time=1948] I love it.
[time=1949] Then it happened.
[time=1951] When the Philistine rose and came and drew near to meet David, that David ran quickly toward
[time=1957] the battle line to meet the Philistine, David put his hand into his bag and took from it a stone and slung it and struck the Philistine on his forehead, and the stone sank into his forehead so that he fell on his face to the ground, thus David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone and he struck the Philistine and killed him, but there was no sword in David's hand.
[time=1978] Then David ran and stood over the Philistine and took his sword and drew it out of its sheath and killed him and cut off his head with it.
[time=1985] When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled, and the rest of the story
[time=1991] goes on to say the nation of Israel followed in mass and slaughtered them and came back and pillaged their camps.
[time=1997] It was a great, great day in the history of the nation of Israel.
[time=2006] Now we've all, many of us I guess, heard this story numerous times and something surfaced as I studied at this time that had never surfaced before.
[time=2014] And you know I'm not given to formulas, I'm not given to equations.
[time=2016] I don't think our deal with God is, you know, if I do this, then God has to do this.
[time=2020] I think it's a relationship, it's dynamic, and there's a lot of confusion that goes on in our relationship with God and that's why we walk by faith.
[time=2027] So please don't misunderstand me, but a formula does, in essence, emerge as I look at this text again.
[time=2033] I wanted to share it with you this morning.
[time=2034] By way of observation, it looks like this to me.
[time=2037] Weakness plus principle plus courage equals victory, weakness plus principle plus courage
[time=2048] equals victory.
[time=2049] David was clearly the weaker of the two.
[time=2051] I mean this story is used even now when the individual tries to fight the megacorporation and it's going to be a David and Goliath.
[time=2057] The guy didn't have the resources, the guy didn't have the power, the guy didn't have the stuff to take on somebody as big as that corporation.
[time=2064] David was a boy, he was facing a giant.
[time=2066] Saul said so, you're not able, you've got my permission.
[time=2070] It's not a matter of my permission, it's a matter of being able to go against this guy.
[time=2075] He's a giant who was trained from his youth to kill people.
[time=2078] What are you doing, David?
[time=2082] David came from a position of acknowledged weakness.
[time=2088] Principle.
[time=2089] However, David's heart was full of principle and I love this more than anything else in
[time=2095] the story.
[time=2097] David asked a question of the other soldiers, who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should taunt the armies of the living God?
[time=2106] Who does this guy think he is and more importantly, who do we think we are?
[time=2110] Have we forgotten the God that we serve and the promises that he has made to us?
[time=2115] David had principles in his heart that he was not about to have some person violate.
[time=2122] Then finally, the great statement that he made out there before he fought him, he said this, "I'm going to slay you.
[time=2126] Why?
[time=2127] That all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.
[time=2130] Do you understand that the whole reason that God raised up the nation of Israel was so that he could bless them and it could cure your way so that all the other nations of the world who were serving all of their false gods would have to acknowledge that the true and living God lives in Israel." And to have this Philistine put under siege the army of Israel and to do it by taunting the living God was in effect going to send the message out that the real God of the heavens
[time=2158] and the earth does not reside in Israel.
[time=2160] And David was not going to stand by and let that happen.
[time=2163] So help him for his life.
[time=2166] He would rather have died down there in that ravine than not take his stand to defend the reality that we have the true and living God in Israel.
[time=2175] It's an amazing conviction at a very, very tender age.
[time=2180] And secondarily, that was the message he wanted to say to the unsaved world, to the redeemed or the people of Israel, he wanted them to know that the Lord does not deliver by sword or by spear.
[time=2190] It's not a matter of personal competence, it's not a matter of genius and wealth and all the things that the world seems to think are necessary for victory.
[time=2198] It is a matter of just being faithful in the battle for God and let God win the battle.
[time=2204] See these were two things that he held dear in his heart as principles that he was not going to have compromised.
[time=2210] There was no standing around as long as those issues were on the table.
[time=2215] He was a man of courage, he came from a position of weakness but his heart was full of principle
[time=2222] and then there was this thing called courage.
[time=2225] Courage is not blind faith.
[time=2227] Courage is not denial about the inevitability of some consequences if you were to take a certain course of action and courage should never be understood as wild presumption upon God.
[time=2239] Courage is found in the heart and it says this, "I have tested God on smaller things.
[time=2248] God and I have walked together in other kinds of situations and based upon what he has done
[time=2254] in those situations I can stand here today and I'll hold my ground and I'll take what comes." Remember what David said?
[time=2263] He said, "The Lord who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, he will deliver me from the hand of the Philistine." David got ready to kill a giant by practicing on lions and bears.
[time=2276] He did his work in private, he did his work in the lonely places of life, he did his work when there weren't two armies watching out there as a little shepherd bore, he just responded to the promptings of the Holy Spirit and went after the obstacles as they came and he learned along the way that God was faithful.
[time=2292] And now he's standing before the biggest obstacle of his life and he says, "You know what?
[time=2298] God did it that time and he did it that time and he did it that time and he did it that time.
[time=2301] He's going to do it this time.
[time=2304] I'm standing out there, I'm going to take it on.
[time=2309] Weakness plus principle plus courage equals victory.
[time=2317] That by way of observation, let me move now to application.
[time=2320] Let's talk about your life, let's talk about my life, let's get off the valley of Ela and let's get into the city of Fort Wayne.
[time=2328] No nine foot nine guys walking around these days but there are a lot of impossible situations
[time=2334] facing many of us today.
[time=2336] Loving a spouse that is proving unlovable over time and in serious ways.
[time=2343] Completing an education that you believe God calls you to do and now it's harder than you thought and money is running short and time is hard to find and you're not sure you've got it but you really feel he wants you to stay at it but it just absolutely looks impossible.
[time=2356] Faithful at work, you feel trapped, you don't know a way out, you don't know where the end is coming and you hate it and you feel trapped and you don't know how in the world you're going to continue to go there and give God an offering and a sacrifice on a daily basis.
[time=2370] Forgiving someone who has wronged you, paying off an enormous financial debt that you want to be responsible to but it feels like it's an impossible thing to do.
[time=2379] Helping with some type of physical pain or illness that's come into your life.
[time=2383] Moving forward after the loss of a loved one.
[time=2385] Whatever your Goliath is and some of you have him today and some of you don't.
[time=2388] I mean some of you are sitting here today and I say what's your Goliath and it's right there in Technicolor and others.
[time=2393] You're just kind of in a spell of time right now, a little period of life where God isn't having you face any of those guys.
[time=2401] For those of you who are facing a Goliath, let's think through this principle one more time, weakness, do you face this giant from a position of acknowledged weakness?
[time=2413] You say well what do you mean by that?
[time=2417] David later in life wrote this behold I was brought forth in iniquity and in sin my mother conceived me.
[time=2421] Do you stand before a holy and a righteous God with an awareness of your own personal sinfulness and forgiven as you are by a loving and gracious Savior who died on your behalf.
[time=2430] You still understand that there are things about you and there are perspectives and there are hard attitudes that lead you to collaborate with David in this psalm and say yeah I'll tell you me too.
[time=2441] I was brought forth in iniquity and in sin my mother conceived me and it's still there.
[time=2446] And God has no obligation to love me and God has no obligation to stand with me in this process but I come to him over and over again and find his mercies new and fresh every morning.
[time=2455] It's a position of weakness spiritually first.
[time=2458] David later wrote in another psalm Psalm 39 he said this Lord make me to know my end and what is the extent of my days.
[time=2464] Let me know how transient I am.
[time=2466] Behold thou hast made my days as hand breaths and my lifetime has nothing in thy sight.
[time=2471] Surely every man at his best is a mere breath.
[time=2474] Moving outside the spiritual dimension of weakness he looks at the physical frame he looks at his body he looks at the transient nature of life and says I'm alive today I may not be alive tomorrow.
[time=2484] There are no promises there are no guarantees the frailty of humanity is one breath after the next.
[time=2489] He said God help me number my days remove from me an arrogant or a proud or an independent heart that sees 75 years or 85 years or 90 years of uninterrupted strong health.
[time=2501] It's a broken dependence upon God a position of weakness.
[time=2509] Paul said it this way in the New Testament this in fact is how God works.
[time=2513] There were not many wise according to the flesh not many mighty not many noble but God has chosen the foolish things of the world to shame the wise.
[time=2521] And God has chosen the weak things of the world to shame the things which are strong.
[time=2526] I want to ask you a question as you face the giant in your life are you trying to operate from a position of arrogance and strength is it going to be you who's going to win the battle is it going to be your cleverness and your strength and your stamina and your commitment and your whatever that's going to resolve this thing.
[time=2541] Let me give you another little hint out of Isaiah chapter 40 this is how the real thing works it says this that God gives strength to the weary and to the one who lacks might
[time=2554] he increases power even though the youth grows weary and tired and the vigorous young men
[time=2560] stumble badly yet those who wait for the Lord wait for the Lord acknowledge your weakness acknowledge your dependence those who wait for the Lord will gain new strength they will mount up with wings like eagles they will run and not get tired they will walk and not become weary.
[time=2578] Satan would like nothing more than for you to power up on your giant fix your own problem push your way through figure your thing out take control of everything because he knows
[time=2588] as you do that you operate in your own strength and you will make the situation worse.
[time=2593] And God beckons you through the life of David to acknowledge and through the New Testament that the real battles are won from a position of weakness humbly submitting your sinful
[time=2604] heart before a holy and righteous God understanding the very life you live and your humanity is but a breath away from its end and standing on the promises of God not describing a mealy
[time=2617] mouth milk toast spineless self appreciating type of attitude at all just a true acknowledgement
[time=2624] of the weakness that is real in us principle principle you heard him say it over and over
[time=2632] again this uncircumcised Philistine taunting the armies of the living God you see David loved God somewhere down deep in David's heart David loved God which meant the name of God
[time=2643] and the character of God and the reputation of God and the faithfulness of God meant more to him than his own life now I don't know where that kind of stuff comes from I don't know how you learn to tie yourself to that kind of principle but David got so far beyond himself in this situation he got so lost from himself in concern for the for the reputation
[time=2665] of God that he went down there and he took on a giant people who live by principle learn
[time=2672] to stop asking the question what about me what about my life what about my situation what
[time=2678] about how I wanted my life to go and they start getting lost and the principles and the truths and the reality of a true and living God Nathan Hale you remember Nathan Hale captured
[time=2689] by the British and hung in New York City as a spy he said I only regret just before he
[time=2696] got hung he said I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country he got
[time=2702] lost in this notion that there could be a place a nation where people could worship the true and living God free from the tyranny of the government gave his life up for it and regretted only that he didn't have another one to give Martin Luther standing before the diet of worms accused of heresy condemned for declaring that men are saved by faith and
[time=2722] faith alone said this my conscience is captive to the word of God here I stand I cannot do
[time=2730] otherwise Martin Luther was liberated because he lived by great transcendent truths that
[time=2737] come from the word of God and he found the standing for those truths more important to him that his own life he was free Peter and John and acts for and when they had summoned
[time=2749] them they commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus but Peter and John answered instead of them whether it is right in the sight of God to give heed to you rather than to God you be the judge for we cannot stop speaking what we have seen and heard
[time=2764] these men were free to live by principle rather than self absorption
[time=2770] Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego standing in front of the very fiery furnace that later consumed the guard who threw them in in front of the most powerful man in the world said
[time=2780] this if it be so our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the furnace of blazing
[time=2786] fire and he will deliver us out of your hand O King but even if he does not let it be known
[time=2792] to you O King that we are not going to serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up do you understand that in today in Fort Wayne in this city when you are invited
[time=2803] to compromise your principles upon which you live you are being invited to deny that the true and living God whom you love and serve is able to take care of you when you and I compromise in business or in our private lives or wherever we live Satan is saying jump the
[time=2818] fence and say with me that God is not an able provider of your needs compromise your
[time=2825] principle and your truth the word of God and the life of David say this never compromise
[time=2831] truth for the path of least resistance for pleasant circumstances for personal gain for the accolades of people for financial success never compromise the truth lose yourself in
[time=2842] the truth learn to live for and sacrifice for and treasure the glory and the honor of God
[time=2850] so help you God as you live it in the practical circumstances of your life David later in
[time=2857] life said this the judgments of the Lord are true these are the principles that he lived by the judgments of the Lord are true they are righteous altogether they are more desirable
[time=2868] than gold yes then much fine gold sweeter also than honey and the drippings of the honey
[time=2874] comb moreover by them thy servant is warned in keeping them there is great reward we need
[time=2883] to learn my friends to value the truth of God and the principles of God and the honor of God and the glory of God more than gold more than the honey and the drippings of the honey comb so what is driving you as you face your giant today is it your own personal
[time=2900] agenda is it trying to work your life out in pleasant and convenient ways reasonable ways which may lead you to compromise or is the thing that drives you most the thing
[time=2911] you hold the highest the value you lift up above any other is the honor and the glory of God weakness plus principle plus courage courage I believe with all my heart that ninety
[time=2928] five percent of us who are here today where we given the opportunity to stand in David shoes seeing hindsight now 2020 as to what happened we want to choose David's path we want to stand up against that giant we want to go down that vow I want to do that thing throw it in their cutters head off hold it up for the world to see and say I followed God in a person here doesn't want that path I believe similarly that as you face the
[time=2950] giants in your life today in this city in this day and this age I believe deep down in your heart you really want to honor God in a similar way that David did back then you're asking
[time=2961] how you're asking where do I get the courage where do I get the courage to stand up for
[time=2968] my principles from a posture of weakness to give God the glory well listen to again the
[time=2974] words of David he said I went out after him and attacked him and rescued it from his mouth and when he rose up against me I seized him by his beard and struck him and killed him he's talking about those lonely moments without the crowds without the accolades where he was just simply following the promptings of the Holy Spirit and in a little bit by little bit many decisions time and time again until he eventually was taking on bears and lions he learned that God would be faithful to him that God would not desert him you know I don't
[time=3005] think that David went from not trusting God and compromising and disobedience out there
[time=3011] in the field by himself to suddenly going out and taking on that lion I think there was a moment by moment walk with God in the little places the private places the little decisions and one thing built on the other and finally as he felt the spirit of God prompting him to take on that lion he did and he found out that God would be faithful it leads you
[time=3031] to examine the quality the integrity of your day by day walk with God and if you want to
[time=3037] win against the giant in your life you must understand that step by step one step at a time you must pay special attention to the private victories of your life you must listen to God and respond to the Holy Spirit and repent of directions and find him faithful to give
[time=3053] you the strength to walk in the trust and obedience mode and you will eventually over time find him leading you to take on the giants of your life weakness plus principle plus
[time=3065] courage equals victory now I want to say a few things about victory here as we close in
[time=3071] the case of David and Goliath it's so wonderful because victory in this way honoring God led
[time=3077] to circumstantial blessing I mean he actually walked over there borrowed his sword and cut his head off with it lifted it up and then the big battle began as the Israelites routed
[time=3088] the Philistines that day David later took the head of the Philistine Goliath and put it in the public place and everybody got to see it and everybody got to know that David won and David later took the sword of Goliath and the shield of Goliath and all the stuff
[time=3102] and put it in his tent we have reason to believe that David would have kept that armor all the days of his life and might even have eventually established a war room in his own palace and in there sent front and center might have been the very armor of Goliath all the days
[time=3116] of his life as he celebrated the victory that God gave him on that field Daniel won an
[time=3123] experiential circumstantial victory the lions did not consume him that day he walked out of there Shadrach Meshach and Abednego went into the fire but were not burnt and they came out not even the smell of smoke was on their being there are times and there are
[time=3139] battles where God will give you the circumstantial victory but my friends don't forget Joseph
[time=3145] Joseph went up against the giant of lust in Potiphar's wife and he won he stood strong
[time=3151] he stayed strong and then God allowed him to be thrown in prison where he was lost and forgotten for a great number of years don't forget Abraham who was promised the son who
[time=3164] would be the seed through which all the nation of Israel would come and he waited day after day after day after day after day until finally his wife was past the point of conceiving and he himself was past the point of of giving what needed to have conception and so there they were most of chapter 11 of Hebrews is full of people who walked most of their life
[time=3184] and waited and waited and waited and waited and waited for the circumstantial blessing that had been promised so there may be a great delay my friends and many of you may be valiantly
[time=3194] fighting or have just fought a goliath and won and you're saying now how come I don't get to cut his head off and put it in a public place and take his armor and set into my house and remember forever the victory that God gave me how come circumstantially my position has gotten worse well sometimes that how it works ask Joseph ask Abraham ask Job who
[time=3217] all those years went without the children that he had loved and lost and without the wealth and the riches and the reputation and sat scraping his own skin with a patchured
[time=3228] as he was covered boils head to toe wondering when in the world God was ever going to stop this thing Joseph got blessed in a delayed way Abraham got blessed in a delayed way Job
[time=3244] got blessed in a delayed way but there are others who never got blessed on this earth
[time=3250] there are others who stood up against their giants and never ever ever got their circumstantial blessing in the here and now Stephen for example stood up against the giant of animosity that flowed from the hearts of the Jews at the preaching of Christ and from a position of weakness
[time=3265] and based on the principle that they needed Christ and with the courage to stand there he got stoned and his life blood blood out on the earth and he was no more in the physical
[time=3276] temporal sense he got his reward later after his life and who better to look to along these
[time=3283] lines than our Savior Jesus Christ who came in weakness standing on the principle that
[time=3290] he would honor God and everything he said and everything he did and had the courage to become sin on our behalf that we might become the righteousness of God but he lived his whole life without ever receiving circumstantial blessing he was a man of sorrows he was acquainted
[time=3305] with grief it was hardship his entire life he got rewarded after death victory please
[time=3315] do not leave this place hearing me say or hearing the word of God say that God is going to give circumstantial blessing in the here and now if you will just come from the position of weakness tie yourself to the true principles of God's word and have the courage to stand there and please do not impugn the character of God if to the best of your ability you are following that line of reasoning and you're not being blessed circumstantially that is
[time=3340] not how he works and he has made no such promises let me just give a closing word to you who
[time=3349] are mothers you know I mean what a great topic for mothers day David and Goliath right what
[time=3355] happened to Hannah well I don't know about that think about this now do you realize that
[time=3363] in many ways lady this is you this is you you come from a position of weakness in some
[time=3369] ways more often than not we find the principles of God's word held tightly and lifted up better
[time=3378] and exalted more thoroughly in the lives of women than we ever do in men and sometimes
[time=3384] because of cultural influences it is your courage that allows you to stand against all kinds
[time=3391] of abuses and things that should not be the case and you honor God with your lives.
[time=3400] The year was 1809 it was a very good year of course nobody knew it at the time because every eye was on Napoleon as he swept across Austria like a frenzied flame in a parched wheat field little else seem significant the diminutive dictator of France was the talk
[time=3416] of all Europe the terror of his reign made his name a synonym for military superiority and ruthless ambition that same year while war was being waged and history was being
[time=3427] made babies were being born in England and America but who had the time to think about
[time=3434] babies and bottles and cradles and cribs when Austria was falling somebody should have in
[time=3442] 1809 a veritable host of thinkers and statesmen drew their first breaths William Gladstone
[time=3449] was born in Liverpool Alfred Tennyson began his life in Lincolnshire all of her Wendell Holmes made his first cry in Cambridge Massachusetts Edgar Allan Poe in nearby Boston began his
[time=3461] poignant life and in Hoganville Kentucky in a rugged log cabin owned by an illiterate laborer and his wife were heard the tiny screams of their newborn son Abraham Lincoln all this
[time=3473] and more happened in 1809 nobody noticed the destiny of the world was being shaped by Napoleon
[time=3481] over in Austria or was it the babies that nobody noticed were in fact the genesis of
[time=3489] a new era it was their lives their brains their writings that would dent the destiny
[time=3497] of the entire world ladies God has given you a unique role in the kingdom of God to shape
[time=3506] to mold and to fashion the character of your daughters and your sons in much the same way
[time=3512] that Timothy's heart and life was shaped by his own mother and many of you will shape
[time=3518] the destiny of this church and this city and possibly this nation in ways that will not
[time=3525] yet be seen for years to come.
