[time=44] - This is the Sunday morning worship service
[time=50] of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=51] Thank you for joining us.
[time=53] You reap what you sow.
[time=55] This morning Pastor Moore talks about consequences of sin in his message titled, "David and Absalut." Now let's join our service.

[time=637] (gentle music)
[time=655] Every morning when I wake up and get out of bed, I tend to hobble for the first four or five yards on my way to the bathroom.
[time=667] About 21 years ago, when I was 17, I was in a motorcycle accident, and the motorcycle had a defect that I was unaware of, and at 55 miles an hour, I crashed, and the motorcycle landed on my right foot and broke every bone in my right foot.
[time=685] And the event, you know, is long since past, it's over.
[time=690] The motorcycle has been repaired, the stitches have been taken out, the medical bills have been paid, but I continue to live with the consequences of that event in my life.
[time=704] And I guess, as I, you know, get old, get really old, you know, like my 50s and 60s and stuff, that it'll even get worse.
[time=714] I imagine as time goes on, the arthritis or whatever it is in there that rumbles around those first few steps will become more painful over time, not less.
[time=721] Consequences, the unavoidable result of a course of action.
[time=728] Stay out in the sun too long, gonna get burnt.
[time=731] Eat too much, too often, you're gonna get overweight.
[time=738] Consistently spend, more than you make, you're gonna go broke.
[time=742] Smash every bone in your right foot, you're gonna limp.
[time=745] As we continue in our study this morning of God's word and of David's life, we find that David is on a collision course with one of the laws that governs the spiritual universe.
[time=759] It can be found in Galatians chapter six, verse seven, and though it'll be illustrated out of an Old Testament character's life, this quote comes from the New Testament, the law is still around, it still applies, it's still in force.
[time=772] Galatians six, verse seven says this, do not be deceived, God is not mocked.
[time=779] For whatever a man sows, this he will also reap.
[time=784] Of course, Paul writing this particular text is writing to an agrarian community.
[time=790] They know all about the laws of sowing and reaping.
[time=793] No farmer ever sowed corn and reap wheat.
[time=798] You sow corn, you reap corn, you sow wheat, you reap wheat.
[time=801] Well that same law basically exists in the spiritual domain.
[time=807] If you sow sin, eventually you're gonna reap the consequences of sin, and if you sow obedience, eventually you're going to reap the consequences of obedience.
[time=819] David thought he could beat the system.
[time=823] David thought he could put his hand on a hot stove and leave it there for a long time, then pull it away and not find shriveled burnt flesh.
[time=831] David thought he could jump from a two story building into the law of gravity, would not eventually have its way in his life, and he'd crash into the ground below.
[time=839] That's why the verse says, do not be deceived, you see.
[time=843] It's very easy when it's you to talk yourself into the notion that you can sow the seeds of sin and not suffer the consequences.
[time=854] I guess sometimes because God is gracious and removes or mitigates some of those consequences, I guess sometimes because the consequences of your sin tend to hit other people more than you.
[time=864] Or maybe it's because in the analogy, you sow one day and you don't reap the next minute.
[time=870] You don't put corn in the ground this instant and the next instant take an ear of corn, "Hey, eat it." There's a delay factor, there's a pause in there.
[time=879] There's time where it looks as if nothing is happening.
[time=883] And then eventually what you've sown comes to fruition.
[time=887] Verse says, God is not mocked.
[time=892] When you and I, when David, when anybody else for that matter, thinks that they can violate this spiritual law that governs the spiritual universe.
[time=902] When you think you can jump off of a building and not fall to the ground, you are in those preliminary moments mocking God.
[time=911] You are in effect turning your nose up at God and treating him with contempt, making God ridiculous by trying to outwit him or trying to evade his laws.
[time=924] This morning, we come to the last chapter of David's life,
[time=931] not the last message I'm gonna give on David.
[time=933] There's one more next week about Mephibosheth.
[time=936] It's hard to say, but it'll be a good message I trust.
[time=940] But in this message, we come to the last chapter in David's life, it's harvest time.
[time=947] It is in fact the last 20 years of his life and he has a huge crop to harvest.
[time=952] And I just wish I could say that it was a good crop.
[time=956] I wish I could say it was a crop of peace and tranquility and unity and community.
[time=960] But it's not, you see.
[time=962] Behind the scenes of all of his great public accomplishments.
[time=966] All the while that David was expanding the borders of Israel from 6,000 square miles to 60,000 square miles.
[time=973] During all those days, the first 20 years of his reign, when he was abolishing the idols and establishing Jerusalem as the center and returning the ark and uniting Israel into the worship of the true and living God.
[time=985] During all those great years when David was establishing trade routes with other nations and now the wealth was just literally pouring, falling, cascading into Israel.
[time=996] While that was going on and the privacy of his own home, he was sowing bad seed.
[time=1002] Sinful habits, lustful passion,
[time=1008] which led to parental neglect, which led to all kinds of unresolved conflict, which finally kind of lay dormant from the public view and even from David's view under the soil, but eventually the thing came to full bloom and he reaps an incredible harvest of incest and rape and murder and hatred and insurrection inside the boundaries of his own house.
[time=1032] And he so fills, if you will, the barns of the palace with this sin that it explodes and bursts into public view before he's done.
[time=1039] Do not be deceived.
[time=1045] God is not mocked.
[time=1048] For what a man sows, he will reap.
[time=1052] By the time David comes to the end of his life, he ends up a beaten man, sobbing uncontrollably over the loss of one of his children, broken, bruised, twisted and confused and the harvesting of his sin is almost more than he can bear.
[time=1068] He had no idea that his sin would produce this kind of stuff.
[time=1073] The thing that came to my mind this week was, remember when you were a kid making popcorn for the first or second or third time and you'd seen your mom do it a few times, you got that pan out, that designated popcorn pan and you put it up on the stove before the air popper came along and all that stuff, you get the oil going, get the thing hot, you fire in a little bit of those popcorn deals and you think, "Oh, that won't be enough." See, it fired a few more.
[time=1096] Well, that's not enough.
[time=1098] And pretty soon you get it where you like it, put the lid on, you come back a few minutes and it's just everywhere.
[time=1102] It's coming out over the top, it's burning the stove, it's falling around, your mom's mad at you, he's like, "What am I gonna do?" But happened to David.
[time=1109] David had no idea when he poured a little more lustful passion in his life, did a little more of that, cultivated a little bit more of that, he had no idea that after he put the lid on that, so to speak, and walked away from it, it was gonna explode all over his life, but it did.
[time=1123] Jose, I'm not talking about David, but just expanding on the principle that what you sow you'll eventually reap says it this way, sow the wind and reap the whirlwind.
[time=1138] In other words, it's more than your bargain for, all you sowed was wind, but what came back was a tornado.
[time=1146] 200 mile an hour winds, a whirlwind came bruising its way through your life, why?
[time=1153] Because sometimes you lose, often in fact, you lose control of what is happening in response to your own sin.
[time=1160] You intended to sin and you intended to have this much consequence, but it gets out of your control.
[time=1166] Circumstances, you did not anticipate a rise which explode the consequence of that sin far beyond your wildest dreams.
[time=1173] Other people react in strange ways to your sin that you didn't anticipate.
[time=1177] It causes them to sin in ways you didn't think they'd sin and suddenly it's exploding all over the kitchen.
[time=1183] And then don't forget God.
[time=1185] You have no way of knowing how God is going to react in the consequence arena to any given choice you may make to willfully sin against him.
[time=1193] And so you have no idea how God is gonna complicate multiply and bring the consequences into your life as a result of your, you thought I was just a little sin.
[time=1202] Boom.
[time=1204] So the wind reaped the whirlwind.
[time=1205] If you don't think so, ask Frank Gifford, right?
[time=1210] He stunned.
[time=1213] He had no idea that was what was gonna happen as a result of this.
[time=1215] He thought I was just a little thing right there.
[time=1217] He had all figured out, got out of his control, circumstances, people's reactions.
[time=1223] Who knows, maybe even God's involvement, boom.
[time=1225] A tornado has running through his life.
[time=1229] And what about David?
[time=1237] In Deuteronomy chapter 17, long before there were any kings in the nation of Israel, God wrote the Pentateuch and in the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Bible, he gave very clear instructions about how the king should conduct himself when Israel finally would have a king.
[time=1254] He said a number of things in Deuteronomy 17.
[time=1255] Number one, he said that the king must be chosen by God.
[time=1258] Number two, the king must be an Israelite.
[time=1262] Number three, the king must have a copy of the law of God.
[time=1267] That seems rather obvious.
[time=1268] It was a theocracy at that time and the king would be chosen by God.
[time=1272] He would be an Israelite from among God's people and he would cherish the law of God and the implied thing there, of course, is he would rule the people of God by the Word of God.
[time=1282] And then there were three things the king could not do under any circumstances.
[time=1286] Number one, he could not multiply horses.
[time=1288] The pagan practice of kings in David's day was for the king to multiply horses because horses were the machines of war.
[time=1296] And as we have great arsenals for protection, they were the aircraft carriers and the jets and the tanks of yesteryear and the pagan king had no alliance with the true and living God and had no covenant with Jehovah that God would be the warrior, the victory in the battle as we learned earlier in David's life is really the lords.
[time=1315] And David seemed to remember that truth all through his days and so he never violated that thing with God as a king to overstock with horses, put his trust in the war machines of the day.
[time=1326] Never did that.
[time=1327] The second thing the Bible said a king could never do in Israel was to multiply money.
[time=1334] Never to hoard wealth and to get treasures, storehouses of wealth for himself.
[time=1339] God had a completely different design for all the prosperity that he was gonna bring into the nation of Israel and it wasn't for the guy on top to get super, super, super, super rich.
[time=1346] It was for the guy on top to enjoy the blessings of the land but to redistribute that wealth and to care for the needy and to meet the needs of people and to show the benevolent heart of God.
[time=1354] And by and large, David obeyed that.
[time=1356] He never really multiplied the wealth in ways that he could have.
[time=1360] But the third thing that the Lord said king could never do, he violated terribly.
[time=1367] And God said the king of Israel will not multiply wives.
[time=1370] The king of Israel will not be involved in polygamy.
[time=1373] Now of course that was a general truth since the beginning of the first marriage when the two should become one but there was special emphasis towards this in the reality of the life of the king because what would happen is the king would need to secure and establish and then secure relationships with foreign nations.
[time=1389] And oftentimes in that day you would grant a daughter or a wife of some kind to the other king and so that's supposed to solidify the arrangement.
[time=1398] And David did some of that.
[time=1401] And David did worse than that.
[time=1402] David took wives from Jerusalem and got extra wives from within the nation of Israel.
[time=1407] He took concubines and while he was faithful about the horses and faithful about the money he was a man of passion and he never learned to control his passion.
[time=1416] And so he sowed seeds of lustful passion in the garden of his own family over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.
[time=1427] In 2 Samuel 5, for example,
[time=1434] we intersect with David's life at a particular point.
[time=1436] David, you remember I had had the 10 years of wilderness experience between the time he was 20 and 30.
[time=1443] He was broken out there, stripped of all his crutches, finally said, God, you're enough for me.
[time=1447] I don't need anything else in life but you.
[time=1449] And about the age of 30, Saul's life was taken in a battle with the Philistines and David was in part installed as King of Israel.
[time=1458] I mean by that he was located in a place called Hebron and had a very small portion of the land of rule and a very small number of the people were actually following him at that time.
[time=1466] He stayed there for about six and a half years.
[time=1469] And finally, he got to be king of the whole land.
[time=1473] And I told you last time what a successful man he was became really the monarch of the Middle East and was phenomenally gifted and very successful and his reign was a pleasure to everybody involved.
[time=1484] Well early in that process as he was beginning to see that God was with him, it says in 2 Samuel 5, 12 this and David realized that the Lord had established him as king over Israel and that he had exalted his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel.
[time=1500] In other words, David's finally in charge, he's finally in Jerusalem, he's finally got the thing rolling the right direction, he's beginning to see the fruit of his labor, he's beginning to see what an incredible leader he is and all the stuff that's falling in the line, people are happy, people are wealthy, things are going great.
[time=1515] Second Samuel 5, 13, meanwhile, while all that's occurring, David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem after he came from Hebron and more sons and daughters were born to David.
[time=1527] Too many wives and too many sons.
[time=1531] In direct violation to Deuteronomy 17.
[time=1533] You see how many wives, we don't know.
[time=1537] There are seven of them named, seven of them are named as wives of David, we know their names and there's a whole other category that are unnamed and I don't even know, can't even number how many he actually had, how many children, while 21 that we know of, but there are indications that there were far more than that and in addition to the unnamed wives we don't know about, there is this thing called the concubine and we have no idea how many there are there.
[time=1562] All of this in direct violation to God's word, all of this seed that is being planted in the garden of his own life and his own family, a talented man, a gifted man, an accomplished man, a successful man, a blessed man sowing bad seed.
[time=1578] The amazing thing is that even though his wives
[time=1584] and his concubines increased, his passion for women was not abated.
[time=1591] The more he had, the more he wanted.
[time=1597] And so he kept adding and adding and adding and the passion for women is never satisfied nor the passion for any other kind of sin in our lives is never satisfied by a full harem of whatever it is, it's only increased.
[time=1609] And so he finally feeding that sin in his life and feeding that sin in his life and giving way to that sin in his life, he finally stands on the rooftop of his palace one evening when he should have been out there in battle and he's got, who knows, 20, 30, 40, 50, a hundred women he could call to satisfy what he was feeling there in the way of a sexual desire.
[time=1632] He looks over the fence and sees this one that he doesn't have and says, I want her.
[time=1639] And I don't know what it is.
[time=1643] I mean, David had been sitting in this category through these wives and concubines the whole time and I don't know what it is that pushed the button there with God in terms of Bathsheba.
[time=1652] And maybe it was the murder that followed, I don't know.
[time=1654] Maybe it was the disgrace that came upon the nation in Israel, but it pushed the button of God and that was it.
[time=1659] Now you remember last week, we took the whole hour to establish this wonderful blessed truth that God pursued David first and foremost to forgive him.
[time=1672] Remember David didn't want to confess?
[time=1674] He committed adultery, found out that she was pregnant, thought, well, I'll cover it up.
[time=1678] The first plan didn't work, the second plan didn't work.
[time=1680] He sends Uriah out there.
[time=1681] Uriah gets murdered by the murder note that David sent him.
[time=1684] So he's trying to cover up his own sin and God loves David and God has a huge heart of compassionate forgiveness and that's what all these songs have been about this morning and that's the great truth that we praise and celebrate.
[time=1694] And so don't forget that.
[time=1695] I mean, God worked incredibly hard through the prophet Nathan until David finally confessed his sin and you read the Psalms there in 32 and 51 and you realize that David experienced what it meant to be forgiven by God.
[time=1707] He was washed, he was cleansed, he was singing, he was rejoicing, he was thrilled to the core of his being.
[time=1715] But guess what?
[time=1717] The consequences were still on their way.
[time=1720] And if you hear me say anything to you this morning, understand that there is a world of difference between being forgiven for your sin and having to live through the consequences of your sin.
[time=1734] Those are two different things.
[time=1735] And God makes no promises anywhere that when he forgives you of your sin, in terms of the temporal consequences that may come as a result of your behavior, he makes no promises to wipe all those out.
[time=1749] Now, of course, the great consequence of hell is forgiven in Christ.
[time=1756] But if you break your arm, Robin, a store and you get done and you've confessed to God that what you did was wrong and you're sorry, you take all the money back to the store and you go to court and you go to jail by your own admission, and that's all great.
[time=1770] You repent it and you're forgiven, but guess what?
[time=1772] Your arm is still broken.
[time=1775] And God does not step in magically and heal the broken arm.
[time=1778] And there are other consequences that go on far more devastating than a broken arm, as you will see, in the context of the damage that we set off in motion like dominoes that go through the relationships of our life, that when we sin, we live through the consequences.
[time=1793] And so this morning I intend, I guess, I mean, that maybe that's why so many chapters were given this way, I believe it's right for us to look at the consequences and look at this truth and let this stand as a wake up call in our own lives in the here and now to say, hey, there's a world of difference between being forgiven by God and then living through the consequences.
[time=1813] Unless we get that confused.
[time=1817] Now at the great moment in the court of the king, as you know, David didn't want to confess and so David receives Nathan who was sent there by God and it says in 2nd Samuel 12, 13, I don't believe we have these for you, so I'll read them to you, says this.
[time=1832] Then David said to Nathan, I have sinned against the Lord.
[time=1836] Remember that great confession?
[time=1838] And Nathan said to David, the Lord also has taken away your sin, you shall not die.
[time=1843] Now here's a classic case of God removing the consequence at some level and God is sovereign in that choice.
[time=1849] God can at different points choose to break the law himself.
[time=1853] In other words, not give you the consequences that you deserve.
[time=1855] David should have been put to death for the adultery and he should have been put to death for the murder of Uriah.
[time=1861] But now listen, it keeps going.
[time=1864] He says, however, very next verse.
[time=1866] However, David, because by this deed you have given occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme, the child also that is born to you shall surely die.
[time=1876] You know that child that was conceived in that adulterous act with Bathsheba?
[time=1881] It's gonna die as a consequence to your sin.
[time=1887] And then it says, now therefore, Nathan's still speaking, now for therefore the sword shall never depart from your house because you have despised me and have taken the wife of Uriah, the Hittite, to be your wife.
[time=1900] Thus says the Lord, behold, I will rise up evil against you from your own household.
[time=1905] I will even take your wives before your own eyes and give them to your companion and he shall lie with your wives in broad daylight.
[time=1917] Indeed, you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel and under the sun.
[time=1922] Amazing, isn't it?
[time=1926] No sooner does he give his great confession and receive pardon for his sin.
[time=1930] And then even beyond that, God graciously spares his life.
[time=1934] Then here comes the list of consequences that are gonna mark David's life between this moment when he is 50 years old until he dies 20 years later.
[time=1941] And the first will be the baby will die.
[time=1943] And then generally two other things.
[time=1945] Number one, and number two, David, listen, the sword will never depart from your family.
[time=1951] Interesting, your family, where do you sow his seeds?
[time=1955] And the third great consequence that he states in general way is that I will raise up evil against you from your own household.
[time=1964] And so this morning I wanna just briefly highlight
[time=1970] for you the stairway down to a broken heart, the stairway down to a broken heart, the consequences that flowed into David's life as a result of his cultivating this sinful seed in the garden of his family.
[time=1983] Remember now at 50, David was the monarch of the Middle East.
[time=1986] David was king, David was glorious, David was talented, David was handsome, David had everything he could possibly want.
[time=1994] One minute.
[time=1995] And then he gave it away, the next minute.
[time=2003] And the giving away took 20 years.
[time=2005] And he went and lived, in my opinion, hell on earth.
[time=2010] And by the time this man is done, he dies a broken man.
[time=2014] Seven steps on the stairway down to a broken heart.
[time=2022] Seven steps, the first step was the infant that died.
[time=2024] Second Samuel 12, 15.
[time=2025] So Nathan went to his house, and then the Lord struck the child that Uriah's widow bore to David, that's interesting in it.
[time=2033] Not Bathsheba, but that Uriah's widow bore to David so that he was very sick.
[time=2040] And then it happened on the seventh day that the child died.
[time=2044] Now from the day that child was born until the day that child died seven days later, David cried out to God to remove the consequence.
[time=2051] David, the man with the heart after God, David the king, David the close one, David the writer of the Psalms, David the guy that really understood God and walked with God, David gets on this sackcloth and ashes and refuses to eat and weeps and wails and cries out before God, oh God, please spare me this consequence, don't take this child out of my life.
[time=2069] At the end of the seven days the child died just as God had said it would.
[time=2076] Broke his heart.
[time=2080] The next step down, and I want you to,
[time=2086] I don't want you to, but you need to.
[time=2087] I mean, you need to think about this not just in terms of David, you gotta get in there with him and you gotta let it be happening in your family if you're ever gonna really feel this stuff as David felt it or get close to the pathos that is appropriate.
[time=2099] The next thing that happens in David's life is that one of his sons rapes one of his daughters.
[time=2105] Now think about that, your son rises up in violence against your daughter, takes her and rapes her in the palace, in your own home.
[time=2118] Well, what's the situation?
[time=2121] Well, Absalom, one of David's sons, now remember 21 kids that we know are hard to keep track of them all, but Absalom is a special sore spot in the life of David.
[time=2131] Absalom's sister is beautiful, she's gorgeous, she's a knockout, her name is Tamar.
[time=2137] And their half brother, another of David's sons,
[time=2143] whose name is Ammon, he definitely looks on the outside.
[time=2148] I mean, he looks at this package and says, I have got to have this.
[time=2152] It says in 2 Samuel 13, one, and Ammon, the son of David, loved her.
[time=2157] Now it was after this that Absalom, the son of David had a beautiful sister whose name was Tamar and Ammon, the son of David, loved her.
[time=2163] Now that's a weird kind of love in it, I mean it's a disgraceful, disgusting, incestuous lust is really what it is.
[time=2170] Tamar is not interested, Tamar wants nothing to do with this guy, this guy is driven by his lust, whenever he learned that, this guy is willing to do things to satisfy his lust that he shouldn't do, wonder where he learned that.
[time=2183] So he comes up with a sick plan to feign that he himself is physically ill and the only one who can console him and the only person who's cooking will help will be Tamar.
[time=2193] So he sends his buddy over, gives the message to Tamar, Tamar naively believes this thing and ends up behind closed doors with Ammon who solicits sex with her and she puts him off.
[time=2204] Second Samuel 13, 15, well, second Samuel 13 and following, listen to this.
[time=2208] When she brought them to him to eat, he took hold of her and said to her, "Come, lie with me, my sister." But she answered him, "No, my brother, "do not violate me for such a thing is not done in Israel.
[time=2220] "Do not do this disgraceful thing." However, he would not listen to her since he was stronger than she, he violated her and lay with her.
[time=2230] What a deplorable picture.
[time=2234] Then it says this, then Ammon hated her with a very great hatred.
[time=2241] For the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her and Ammon said to her, "Get up and go away."
[time=2258] What a wicked thing.
[time=2258] How would you like to be the father?
[time=2261] How would you like to know you had a son that would do that?
[time=2265] That would scheme, that would premeditate, that would lie, that would plan and that would then force himself on his own sister?
[time=2278] And how would you like to have a daughter?
[time=2281] How would you like to have a daughter who has now been raped?
[time=2286] I mean, by her own brother, in your own home, I mean, how does she cope with all that?
[time=2292] How does she think her way through that?
[time=2294] Well, the third step on the way down
[time=2300] is connected to that second one.
[time=2302] And it is this, Absalom develops an intense hatred for Ammon.
[time=2306] It says in seconds, Samuel 13, "Then Absalom, her brother, said to her, "'Has Ammon your brother been with you?
[time=2314] "'But now keep silent, my sister.
[time=2315] "'He is your brother.
[time=2317] "'Do not take this matter to heart, my lance.'" I mean, the poor girl.
[time=2323] So Tamar remained and was desolate in her brother Absalom's house.
[time=2327] Now, if you're a Jewish woman, I just gotta tell you, you can't get any lower.
[time=2332] The one person who might care and have the strength to do something about it is writing it off and telling you to do nothing about it and don't even take it to heart, pretend it never happened.
[time=2339] And if you've ever been with somebody who's been abused like that, that's probably the worst thing they could possibly hear.
[time=2344] And then she is called to remain desolate in her own brother's house.
[time=2347] And the whole deal for Jewish women was, of course, to have babies, I mean, that was their whole place in life.
[time=2352] But there's a reason behind Absalom's counsel, 2 Samuel 13, 22, Absalom did not speak to Ammon, either good or bad, for Absalom hated Ammon because he had violated his sister.
[time=2367] So now for a great space of time, there is absolutely no communication.
[time=2371] This is like the passive-aggressive deal.
[time=2372] This is the super-silent cold.
[time=2374] I'll rip you apart by refusing to acknowledge you even exist.
[time=2377] The hatred ran so deep and so hot in Absalom's heart for his brother.
[time=2382] Now you get the little glimpse in the scriptures and about this time word gets to David that his daughter had been raped and the text says that David was angry.
[time=2395] He was angry, well, big deal.
[time=2399] David, why don't you go do something?
[time=2403] Why don't you work this thing out?
[time=2404] Why don't you get involved?
[time=2405] Why don't you lead?
[time=2406] Why don't you take your kingship and your strength and your power and your charisma and your heart for God?
[time=2410] And why don't you get down here in the middle of these, your kids and help them try to figure out who God is and how to love each other?
[time=2417] And the text reveals that David did absolutely nothing.
[time=2421] He refused to get involved with his kids.
[time=2426] Guess what happened next?
[time=2429] The fourth step down, Absalom murders Ammon, which was his plot from the very beginning.
[time=2435] It says in 2 Samuel 1328, an Absalom commanded his servants saying, see now when Ammon's heart is married with wine and when I say to you strike Ammon, then put him to death, do not fear, have I not myself commanded you, be courageous and be valiant.
[time=2450] And the servants of Absalom did to Ammon just as Absalom had commanded.
[time=2454] Then all the king's sons arose and each mounted his mule and fled.
[time=2460] Absalom had gotten them all out in this area of the country where they were supposed to be doing something and that was all just a hoax.
[time=2467] And he got them alone, he got them away and he got, you know, Ammon drunk and then he had his servants kill him and all the other brothers knew that, I guess if Absalom's gonna start killing everybody, he's mad at it, we better get out of here 'cause he's been mad at us for a long time too.
[time=2479] And maybe this is the beginning of the end for all of us.
[time=2483] So David gets word.
[time=2488] But his troubles are just beginning.
[time=2491] His troubles are just beginning because the fifth step is now Absalom is so angry and he hates his father so much and he has turned himself so completely and totally against King David that now he works to usurp his father's throne.
[time=2508] And this I guess is the worst of the worst, isn't it?
[time=2510] Absalom began to sit in the gates when his people would come to Jerusalem to receive counsel and justice and decisions from King David.
[time=2520] Absalom who apparently was an incredibly talented, incredibly gifted, very verbal, very brilliant and persuasive charismatic individual.
[time=2527] He sat out there in the gates and he intercepted the people on their way to see his dad and he heard their story and he made him feel good about the fact that he heard their story and he commiserated with them and as they were leaving he would systematically undo the counsel that David had given or undermine the judgments that David had made.
[time=2546] And apparently he was very persuasive and very capable for the short amount of time he was able to get enough of the country to want to follow him instead of King David and worked his magic enough inside the military regime that he could bring out a full fledged, bona fide coup against his father and expelled David from the city.
[time=2565] Second Samuel 15, 14 and David said to all of his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, arise and let us flee for otherwise none of us shall escape from Absalom.
[time=2574] Go and haste lest he overtake us quickly and bring down calamity on us and strike the city with the edge of the sword.
[time=2580] I mean, Absalom came in in a big fat rush, a big huge gust of wind and it blew David right out of the city.
[time=2587] And now the harvesting of David's sin begins to overflow
[time=2596] the palace walls and now it's just public knowledge and everybody's got to live now under the consequences of David's sin.
[time=2605] It gets worse, Absalom comes to power, Absalom now has command of the palace and one of Absalom's advisors tells Absalom that if you will just take your father's concubines, if you will enter them and violate them sexually, it will show to all the nation that you are greater than David.
[time=2626] And so it says in second Samuel 16, 22 that they pitched a tent for Absalom, where on the roof where did so much of this begin?
[time=2637] David on the roof looking at Bathsheba, probably in that very location, they pitched a tent for Absalom and Absalom went into his father's concubines at the sight of all Israel.
[time=2649] This is a gross and sorted scene of open sexual immorality, leaving no question in anybody's mind what Absalom was doing to his father's concubines.
[time=2661] And by the way, it is intended to be an irreconcilable difference.
[time=2666] That is how deep Absalom hates his father, David.
[time=2670] He wants to do things that will ensure they will never ever, ever be able to reconcile again.
[time=2675] David out there in exile by the providence of God
[time=2682] and through his own incredible giftedness is able to turn things back around and he is now ready to retake the city.
[time=2691] And the great battle is going to happen between the forces of David and the forces of Absalom.
[time=2696] And Joab, as you remember, the one who faithfully executed David's order to execute Uriah the Hittite, Joab the great general of David was in the lead and was in charge and before he went to battle against the forces of Absalom, David looked him in the eye and said, "Don't you kill my son, "and don't you let any of our men kill my son.
[time=2712] "You treat Absalom with kindness." And David's heart was still wide open to Absalom despite all that had happened.
[time=2720] And as the battle ensued, apparently Absalom had a huge, had a hair.
[time=2725] They had to cut it regularly, the Bible says.
[time=2729] And he was fleeing because they were losing the battle to David's army and he got his hair caught in a tree and kind of a comical scene, you know, the horse keeps going and here's Absalom hanging from his hair out of this tree.
[time=2743] And he's obviously very vulnerable and no one is around to help him and Joab comes along and kills him.
[time=2751] (indistinct chatter) And when David finally heard all this in 2 Samuel 1833, it says this, "And the king was deeply moved "and he went up to the chamber over the gate and wept.
[time=2763] "And thus he said as you walked, "Oh, oh, my son Absalom.
[time=2768] "My son, my son Absalom.
[time=2773] "Would I had died instead of you?
[time=2775] "Oh, Absalom, my son, my son." David is a beaten man.
[time=2782] David is sobbing at this point as if he has lost his mind.
[time=2787] Every crutch has been removed.
[time=2791] He is at the bitter end.
[time=2792] He is broken and bruised.
[time=2794] He is twisted and confused.
[time=2796] The harvesting of his sin is almost more than he can bear.
[time=2800] Galatians 6-7, do not be deceived.
[time=2806] God is not mocked.
[time=2810] For whatever a man sows, this, he will also reap.
[time=2814] The infant dies.
[time=2818] One of his sons rapes one of his daughters.
[time=2822] One of his sons bitterly hates one of his other sons.
[time=2826] One of his sons murders one of his sons.
[time=2828] One of his sons usurps his throne.
[time=2831] One of his sons violates his own concubines.
[time=2834] One of his own sons is killed in battle.
[time=2840] One writer put it this way, "Peligamy is just Greek for Dunghill."
[time=2849] Polygamy is just Greek for Dunghill.
[time=2854] David trampled down the first and the best law of nature in his palace in Jerusalem.
[time=2861] And for his trouble, he spent all his after days in a hell upon earth.
[time=2865] David's palace was a perfect pandemonium of suspicion and intrigue and jealousy and hatred.
[time=2872] All of it breaking out, now into incest and now into murder.
[time=2875] And it was in such a household, if such a cesspool could be called a household, that Absalom David's third son by his third living wife was born and brought up.
[time=2886] A little ring of jealous and scheming parasites, all hateful and hating one another, collected around each one of David's wives.
[time=2895] And it was in one of the worst of those wicked little rings that Absalom grew and got his education.
[time=2901] David threw some seed and he got completely out of his control.
[time=2909] He had no idea how the other people in his life were gonna react to his throwing of that seed and he had absolutely no idea how God was gonna react to the throwing of that seed.
[time=2918] Well as we closed this morning, I just wanna try to make two obvious points of application for our lives today.
[time=2928] The first one is to those of you who are sowing, to those of us who are sowing, to those of you who are sowing, the question is this, what kind of seed are you sowing today?
[time=2939] What kind of seed are you sowing these days?
[time=2943] You see, you might be sowing sinful seed.
[time=2950] You just might be compromising the truth you know, you need to live by not in all the areas of your life.
[time=2956] Like David, you're having success in the military arena and you're having success in the national worship arena and the uniting of Israel under Jerusalem and the ark of the covenant.
[time=2965] You might have enormous success financially in the area of trade and all that stuff.
[time=2970] I mean, not all of your life is a desolate thing at this point, but behind the scenes in a small way in a calculated way in what you hope is a very restricted way you just may be sowing some bad seed.
[time=2984] And you may be saying because of the time delay of it's harvesting, I'm getting away with it.
[time=2989] God must not really be too mad at me for it.
[time=2992] Maybe it's not really out of bounds after all.
[time=2994] Maybe God thinks I'm worthy of a little exception on this one and you're telling yourself you've made it, there's no problem, there won't be any consequences.
[time=3004] Oh, don't be deceived.
[time=3008] God is not mocked.
[time=3011] What you sow, you will also reap.
[time=3014] One writer said this, sin does not serve well as a gardener of the soul.
[time=3021] It landscapes the contour of the soul until all that is beautiful has been made ugly and all that is high has been made low and all that is promising is wasted.
[time=3030] Then life is like a desert parched and barren.
[time=3033] It is drained of purpose.
[time=3035] It is bleached of happiness.
[time=3037] Sin then is not wise but wasteful.
[time=3040] It is not a gate but only a grave.
[time=3043] What kind of seed are you sowing these days?
[time=3049] Are you really ready for, you really wanna expose your life to the explosive components that are hovering all around the sowing of sinful seed?
[time=3062] And working with a man that doesn't live in this state married for 26 years.
[time=3069] For 26 years, successful in business.
[time=3071] For 26 years, an obvious leader in the church.
[time=3074] For 26 years, pursuing all the interests that filled his heart.
[time=3078] And for 26 years, failing to love his wife and his kids.
[time=3082] Not in obvious ways, not by beating them, not by sexually abusing them, just by being selfish in his time and his perspectives and by not entering into their cares and their concerns and not pursuing them as the word of God would call him to pursue them.
[time=3097] Now, all of a sudden, without much warning, the lid can't hold the harvest of hatred and disrespect
[time=3108] and desire to be away from him that fills the heart of his wife and his children.
[time=3116] One of his sons hates him to the core of his being.
[time=3119] One of his sons is so disillusioned and has been so hurt and so mistreated by this father that he hates his dad for all he's worth.
[time=3131] His wife will have nothing to do with him.
[time=3136] I don't know.
[time=3141] I think David calls out to us this morning and a wake-up call and saying, "You know, I'm a gracious and I'm a forgiving "and I'm a compassionate God "and I can forgive any sin you can commit.
[time=3152] "In fact, I want to forgive any sin you commit "and if you don't confess it, I'll find you "and I'll bring you to the place that you confess your sin.
[time=3158] "So I can forgive you your sin.
[time=3160] "I got no problems with forgiveness," God says to you today, but he says, "Do not forget the other side, the other part.
[time=3166] "Do not forget the law that governs the spiritual universe "and will not be mocked and you will reap what you saw." And God calls out to you in the life of David this morning and says, "If in privacy and if yet the consequences "if not so overwhelmed you that you've chosen to stop, "stop based upon the testimony of David's life." He would come here today and he would say, "Stop your sowing," whatever it is, however good it feels, however nice it seems, stop your sowing.
[time=3192] You do not want to reap the harvest.
[time=3196] And the second thing I'd like to do by way of application is speak to those of you who are harvesting.
[time=3203] Those of you who are harvesting, some of you, you've already planted and it was bad seed and now you're in the middle of the harvest and you relate with the message that is here today from David's life because you're beginning to see the very foundation of your life crack and crumble and fall and you're gonna live now a thing maybe for a moment and maybe like David for 20 years until you die, you are realizing you're going to live in the consequence of a bad harvest.
[time=3229] And your question is, how do I handle it?
[time=3231] Well, handle it like David did.
[time=3235] David, this is so remarkable.
[time=3238] This is one of the things that just amazes me about David's life.
[time=3241] The question I'll ask you is this, how will you choose to respond to God during the bad harvest?
[time=3245] How are you going to choose to respond to God during the bad harvest?
[time=3249] Many of us, myself included, I am prone to become angry at God when God lets me suffer the consequences of my own sin.
[time=3258] Somehow I forget that I did the sinning and somehow I forget that he told me in advance there'd be consequences and somehow I'm capable of becoming angry at him for having an allowing me to walk through the consequences of my own sin.
[time=3270] You relate to that?
[time=3272] It's a funny strange thing that can go on inside my heart.
[time=3274] I can accuse God, I can blame God, I can run from God, I can want to live without God as he just allows the normal consequences of my own sin to have their way in my life.
[time=3285] It's common and it's foolish.
[time=3293] Some of you have a veneer over your heart right now between you and God and it's getting crusty and it's getting harder and it's getting thicker and it's getting harder to penetrate.
[time=3301] And you don't like the way your life is gone and you know that some of that is the consequence of your own sin and somehow instead of doing what David did you're allowing yourself to become more distanced from God by your anger and your bitterness and your blaming.
[time=3314] It's a very, very common response.
[time=3316] You say, okay, how did David respond?
[time=3318] Well, remember the seven days that he fasted and had the sackcloth and ashes and all that stuff?
[time=3324] And at the end of those seven days, God said, I'm not gonna release this consequence and the baby died, do you know what David did?
[time=3330] Listen to it, it says David arose from the ground, washed, anointed himself, changed his clothes and came into the house of the Lord and worship.
[time=3340] Worship God, worship God.
[time=3345] David was unpresentable in an external way and so he got up off that ground, he cleaned himself off and that would have been very appropriate in that day then to anoint himself to change his clothes and the first place he went and the first thing he did was he got in the presence of God and fell prostrate and worshiped the true and living God.
[time=3362] There's only two ways to respond to the bad harvest.
[time=3366] You either get angry and bitter and walk away from God or you stay soft in your heart towards God and you worship God and you extol God even though the consequences are hard and they remain and they may walk you all the way to your grave.
[time=3378] You still do what David did and you worship God.
[time=3380] And that's what he did.
[time=3383] There were other circumstances that I don't have time to develop for you in that last 20 years and over and over and over again, David chose to worship God.
[time=3392] In fact, that famous statement where David says, I refuse to give God that which cost me nothing happens in that last period of his life and somebody loves him so much, he's on his way to worship and they want to provide the sacrificial animals and David says, not on your life.
[time=3407] I will not offer God that which cost me nothing.
[time=3412] I mean, this was heartfelt, sincere, intense worship going on and David's heart in those last 20 years of his life even though his life was falling apart at every point.
[time=3421] Will you do that with God?
[time=3423] That's what he's asking.
[time=3425] That's what he's saying in David's life.
[time=3427] You've got to learn to worship me no matter what.
[time=3430] And maybe that's why David is remembered as the man with a heart after God.
[time=3436] Maybe after all, that's the real component that defines him.
[time=3439] Maybe that's what God saw when he looked out there and saw that little 17-year-old boy out there tending his sheep.
[time=3446] Maybe he saw a heart that would pursue him no matter what.
[time=3449] In the hard times that he didn't deserve, ages 20 to 30 and in the hard times that he did deserve.
[time=3458] David sought God.
[time=3460] Little shepherd boy out there fighting the lions and the bears and the tigers, he kept his heart right with God.
[time=3467] That brief little meteoric rise, the national stardom, maybe those three years between 17 and 20, kept his heart right with God.
[time=3475] Goes out there in the desert, all alone, hunted like a wild dog, running around from cave to cave, bunch of just mal-contents, finding him, keeps his heart right with God.
[time=3484] The first 20 years of his kingship, through all that success, established the ark and Jerusalem, did his best to unify the nation, kept his heart right with God.
[time=3497] The last 20 years of absolute miserable, hellish existence, reaping the whirlwind of his own lustful passion over and over and over and over and over again, he worshipped God.
[time=3509] What a man.
[time=3512] What a model.
