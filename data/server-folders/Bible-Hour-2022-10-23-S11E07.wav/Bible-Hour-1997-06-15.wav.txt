[time=30] This morning, I want to talk to you about father power, the incredible, often underestimated
[time=50] God-given power of a father in the home.
[time=62] This is the Sunday Morning Worship Service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=65] Thank you for joining us.
[time=67] Pastor Moore's message today is about fatherhood.
[time=70] In father power, he looks at the God-given, often underestimated power of the father in the home.
[time=76] We hope you'll stay with us.
[time=77] Now let's join our service.
[time=80] Oh, good morning, son.
[time=93] Good morning, Father.
[time=95] Did you sleep well?
[time=97] Yes, I slept fine.
[time=101] Well?
[time=103] Okay.
[time=117] Is this all there was?
[time=120] Yep.
[time=121] And you're certain you didn't drop anything.
[time=123] I'm positive.
[time=124] Did you have the man double check his bag?
[time=126] Yes, Father.
[time=127] Just as I always do.
[time=128] There was nothing else there.
[time=130] Perhaps you should visit the post office and check this afternoon.
[time=133] They may have mislaid something.
[time=135] Yes, Father.
[time=137] No telegrams or phone calls this morning.
[time=140] No, nothing.
[time=141] I wonder if the phone is working.
[time=143] I'll do it.
[time=144] It's fine.
[time=145] I checked it twice.
[time=147] Well, we're bound to hear something by tomorrow.
[time=152] Yes, Father.
[time=157] Father?
[time=161] How long are you going to wait?
[time=167] As long as I have to.
[time=170] But he has been gone for three years.
[time=173] Don't you understand?
[time=174] He's never coming back.
[time=176] Oh, three years is not so long.
[time=179] He'll come back.
[time=180] If not today, then soon.
[time=183] Perhaps even tomorrow we'll see him walking up that road toward his home and we'll be here to welcome him.
[time=188] But why?
[time=189] What?
[time=190] Why?
[time=191] Why do you still wait?
[time=194] Why do you even hope anymore?
[time=196] How can you pretend that he's going to come back?
[time=199] At first I could understand, but not week after week, month after month, year after year.
[time=205] When is this stupidity going to end?
[time=210] Is that what you think?
[time=211] That my waiting is stupid?
[time=214] Well, yes.
[time=217] I'm sorry, I don't like to say this.
[time=221] I've tried to be supportive.
[time=222] I've tried to understand.
[time=224] I've tried to believe that you were right to wait for all of these years.
[time=227] Then it showed how much you care, but I mean, well, there comes a time when you have just got to accept the fact that even love has its limits.
[time=236] And you think this is the time?
[time=238] Yes, I do.
[time=240] Forget about him.
[time=241] Let him die.
[time=243] I am dying.
[time=246] Yes.
[time=247] Well, how can you say that about your own brother?
[time=249] It's easy.
[time=250] Don't you care about him?
[time=252] Of course I did, but did he ever care about us?
[time=254] I mean, look at what he's done.
[time=257] He's an obvious that he doesn't deserve this waiting, not even for a single day.
[time=261] Come on, won't you face the truth?
[time=265] And just what is the truth?
[time=270] The truth is that he took everything that you had to give and then left.
[time=276] You know the truth.
[time=278] You heard the stories just like I did.
[time=280] You heard how he squandered his money on wine and women, slept in the finest hotels, ate the best food, wasted his money on gambling and on parties.
[time=288] Father, he did everything he wanted to do and never once considered you.
[time=292] In fact, he's probably telling himself right now what a stupid foolish old man you are.
[time=299] Is that what you think I am?
[time=307] What should I think?
[time=309] I mean, isn't it foolish to wait around for three years for someone to return, he's done everything he could to disgrace you?
[time=315] So you want me to stop waiting?
[time=318] Yes.
[time=319] I can't.
[time=320] But why?
[time=322] I love him.
[time=324] Father, he is a thief.
[time=327] Yes, I know.
[time=328] He's a liar.
[time=329] I know.
[time=330] A clotting.
[time=331] I know.
[time=332] A truck.
[time=333] Father, he is full of evil.
[time=334] I know.
[time=335] In short, he is everything that you have ever hated the most.
[time=337] And he is my son.
[time=339] I will this never end.
[time=342] Never.
[time=345] Then you'll wait?
[time=350] Yes.
[time=352] I wait.
[time=354] Why?
[time=358] Because I love him as much as I love you.
[time=369] He is never going to come home.
[time=373] Oh, he'll come.
[time=377] Maybe not today, but soon when he finally realizes how much I love him and I'm still
[time=383] here waiting, he'll come and I'll be here, ready to welcome him with my arms wide open
[time=390] and I'll place a coat on his shoulders and rings on his fingers and we'll kill the fatted calf to celebrate his return for my child was lost.
[time=401] But now he's found.
[time=404] Come home, son.
[time=407] Well, imagine with me as we start this morning, if you can, maybe even close your
[time=413] eyes and try to really picture this.
[time=414] What would happen if Clark Kent woke up one morning and somehow forgot that he possessed
[time=420] superhuman power in their book, Gary Smalley, John Trent, the hidden value of a man.
[time=426] They had a little chapter there entitled when Clark Kent forgot his power.
[time=430] It goes like this.
[time=432] He slaps the snooze button on his bedside clock radio and compresses it to the depth of an index card.
[time=439] At breakfast, he slams his coffee mug down the table and sends it clean through two inches of splintered mahogany.
[time=445] He yells his frustration at a sports article in the newspaper and cracks a thermal paint window in the dining room.
[time=452] He also ruptures his wife, Lois, left eardrum.
[time=455] She collapses in agony beneath the table as he heads back to the bathroom.
[time=459] In the hallway, he brushes against Clark, Jr., leaving him with a cracked collarbone and a severe concussion.
[time=466] On his way out the door, he swats the cat off his favorite chair and welds the unfortunate animal into the wallpaper.
[time=474] Leaving the house, he swings the door closed and rips it right off its hinges.
[time=478] He kicks a bicycle off the side wake, planning it 50 feet up in the neighbor's elm tree.
[time=484] He says, "Ah, but that's unrealistic.
[time=487] How could Superman not realize his own powers?
[time=491] How could he miss seeing the devastation, the pain, the havoc he has left in his wake?
[time=498] How could he look at the bruises, the tears, the brokenness, the chaos, and not realize
[time=504] he had caused it all?" This morning I want to talk to you about father power, the incredible, often underestimated
[time=514] God-given, intrinsic power that God gives to a father inside the family.
[time=521] I don't want to talk about the downsides of it, as illustrated by Clark Kent.
[time=524] I want to talk about the upsides of father power.
[time=528] God has put fathers in a unique role.
[time=530] You can talk about the Dallas Cowboys all you want.
[time=533] You can say it's their powerful offensive line.
[time=535] You can say it's their aggressive attack defense, their mighty receivers, their incredible running backs.
[time=540] But in my opinion, the reason the Dallas Cowboys went where they went and did what they did was because it was a guy in the middle of the huddle named Troy Ekman.
[time=547] He was the quarterback.
[time=548] And because of his skill, his dedication, his competence, his professionalism, and his leadership, everybody found their full place in the sun.
[time=557] They were balanced and they achieved their highest possible potential.
[time=560] I believe that's exactly how it works with father power.
[time=563] In the middle of the huddle called the family, there's just one individual who's been given a unique responsibility.
[time=569] And that responsibility is to so love and to so commit and to be so involved and to so balance and to so energize everybody else that they all rise to their highest potential and you have a thing called the family.
[time=581] It's a powerful role to mark the soul, the mind, and the heart of the individuals, the
[time=587] wife and the children inside his sphere of influence, father power.
[time=593] In 1980, Dr. James Dobson put it this way.
[time=596] The Western world stands at a great crossroads in its history.
[time=599] It is my opinion that our very survival as a people will depend upon the presence or absence of masculine leadership in the millions of homes.
[time=609] I believe with everything within me that husbands hold the keys to the preservation of the family.
[time=619] Father power, the power of the father inside the home, and this morning in specific to do five things.
[time=625] I want to give them to you all in advance and then I'll go back and work my way through.
[time=628] Number one, father power turns ordinary experiences into the times of our lives.
[time=635] Number two, father power turns failures, disobedience, and rebellion into character shaping victories.
[time=643] Number three, father power turns average people into champions.
[time=649] Number four, father power turns insecure people into trophies of grace.
[time=654] Number five, father power turns lines of authority into meaningful relationship.
[time=661] Number one, father power.
[time=665] Father power turns ordinary experiences into the times of our lives.
[time=669] I'm going to work really hard on this first main point, not the cry all over myself, fall down weeping and wailing because it's going to be about my dad and I love my dad.
[time=675] I've got great memories, but here we go.
[time=678] There's this house.
[time=679] It's an ordinary house.
[time=681] It's found at 1333 East Mountain Street, Glendale, California.
[time=686] You drive by that house, then when we live there, you drive by it today or in my frequent trips home to California, as I often do.
[time=693] You come along the curb, you look at the house, you say, "Ordinary house." It's got grass, got a few trees, got a fence, two-story house, ordinary house.
[time=703] But when we live there, it was an extraordinary house because something happened on the inside
[time=709] of 1333 East Mountain Street that made it unbelievable and unbelievable place to live.
[time=716] My father had a sweatshirt.
[time=718] I can still remember the smell of it to this day.
[time=720] It was the rough-out sweatshirt.
[time=721] It was the thing he got into.
[time=723] It seems like every day after work, he got in the door, he put that thing on and we were ready to go.
[time=728] It was in that shirt that we had our pillow fights and our horse rides where we got bucked off and attacked and we played hide-and-go-seek and the laughter and the love and the hugs and the kisses never seemed to end.
[time=739] That sweatshirt somehow seems to be the symbol of the physical contact that happened between my father and I, that father power that made 1333 East Mountain Street extraordinary.
[time=749] When I was living there, I had a dark gun, an average ordinary dark gun.
[time=753] In the hands of a kid, it's nothing but a mere toy.
[time=756] You add father power to the dark gun and something special happens, something magical, something wonderful begins to happen.
[time=762] My dad had a vision for that little dark gun, so he bought about 20 of them.
[time=766] They're the kind with the little plastic handle you stick that dart and they don't sell them anymore.
[time=770] They consider them dangerous.
[time=771] The little plastic dart goes in there and then the little rubber tip, you lick it and shoot it just right.
[time=774] It sticks on your mirror.
[time=775] That dark gun.
[time=777] He bought about 20 of those, went down and got about 100 more extra darts so that we could transform the living room.
[time=783] Not into a nice place where people sit and talk about things that don't matter, but into two forts that opposed each other and every piece of furniture in the living room and really in the entire house became suspect to build that one fort on that side and the other fort on that side.
[time=796] Then he said rules, he said this, you can hide behind your fort and you come out from behind your fort.
[time=801] It doesn't matter where you go, but if you get hit by an opposing dart you're out and you're out until the end of the game until everybody else on your team has been extinguished and the wars began.
[time=809] And they went and they were long and they were furious and they were screams and there was excitement and there was fierce little boys with a humble behind couches waiting for bad people to come and shoot him as he was the only guy left on his team.
[time=819] Incredible experiences of victory and loss and laughter and love and broken couches and broken chairs and who knows what else my mother had to endure?
[time=829] Father power had hit the home.
[time=832] Four doors down from 1333 East Mountain Street in Glendale, California, there's a park called
[time=838] Nibley Park, average ordinary park has grass and trees and swings and tennis courts has
[time=844] all the things that ordinary houses, I mean rather ordinary parks have until my dad showed up.
[time=850] Then father power took over the park and suddenly kids were being organized into two opposing football teams.
[time=855] They were getting positions, they were getting instruction, they were getting motivation, they were huddling up and little huddles and seeing plans drawn on his hand and they were encouraged to run their patterns exactly as he told them and when they didn't they heard about it and when they did they won and it was so engrossing and so captivating that on Saturday mornings when my dad wouldn't show up they'd come up from the park, assault the house, knock on the door and say hey can super sport come out and play today?
[time=878] That was his nickname and the neighborhood super sport was his name.
[time=882] He turned an ordinary average park not just for his own kids primarily for his kids but if you got in the splash effect of the father power that he had you had a great time no matter who you were, no matter where you were, there was ordinary little chest, little chest
[time=897] in the basement of our house, very small little basement, not like you think of your little little place, little basement just off the side of the garage.
[time=905] In that basement there was a chest, it was my dad's dad's chest, it was my grandfather, Robert I'm more the first, it was his chest and I can still remember the musty smell that would come out of it, wafting out of it as you'd lift up the lid and inside would be a fascinating world of pictures from my dad's era, my dad's dad's era, my grandfather's era and books that he would have read and he was into fishing, there were more little fishing things, more little fishing flies and more little things to make fishing flies and anything I'd ever seen in my life and extra fly rod reels over here and then there were some bullets and then there were some handguns and then next to the chest there were some guns that were leaning up that were obviously my grandfathers, an nostalgic experience.
[time=945] But then father power hits the scene, I remember my very first hunter safety course, took place in that closed out little basement down there as we handled together that rifle and he began to teach me about the safety and about pretending that the gun is always loaded and never assuming that it's not loaded so you'd never pointed at anyone and all the kinds of little hunter safety rules that his dad had taught him that he was now teaching me and it went from there to Saturday mornings out at Castank where we would drive 45 minutes from our house, there was a greasy spoon out there, we'd have bacon and eggs first, a little bit of hot coffee to get my dad going and then we'd parked the car on a lonely desolate road and we would walk down these river beds and hunt for hours on end and shoot every rabbit quail and dove that had the lack of sense to show up in our path.
[time=986] He had legendary shots there, legendary shots, no man had ever made before happened, it was super power, father power down on the river beds of that little place in Castank, California.
[time=995] I can remember them as if they were yesterday.
[time=999] Father power is energy.
[time=1001] Father power is energy that gets invested to expand a child's heart, mind and soul.
[time=1007] Father power is energy that is invested to expand a child's heart, mind and soul and it doesn't matter if you do it like Bob Moore did it.
[time=1015] It doesn't matter if you want to do it through books or through antique cars or through computers or chess tournaments or woodworking or however you want to expand your energy into the life of your child, just expend the energy.
[time=1029] Father power transforms the ordinary experiences of life into the times of our lives.
[time=1036] It is focused energy, it is concentrated energy, it is directed and measured and sacrificial
[time=1042] energy that infuses life into the heart of the child who receives it.
[time=1046] Let me give you a question here this morning, I want to give you the summer challenge.
[time=1051] Behind each point we'll come to summer challenge.
[time=1052] I love preaching to a specific event in my mind.
[time=1054] I want to talk to you dads about how the summer is going to play out.
[time=1058] The weather is finally cooperating and the schedules are lightening up and the kids are home from school and there's time to travel if your kids are a little farther away or maybe they're coming home from college.
[time=1066] I want to ask you something, Dad.
[time=1067] How much energy are you planning to throw at your family this summer?
[time=1072] How much Father power energy are you planning to enthuse into their hearts and their lives?
[time=1078] I know you're thinking about summer, I'm thinking about summer, everybody's thinking about summer.
[time=1082] Friends for summer, I ask you this morning, are your plans about investing time and energy in the life of your kids?
[time=1089] Be creative.
[time=1090] Set a new standard for yourself and for the way you'll interact with your kids.
[time=1096] Give it some careful thought, take some risks, do whatever you need to do to get after your kids in a powerful way.
[time=1103] Father power, Father power.
[time=1107] Father power turns failures, disobedience and rebellion into character shaping events.
[time=1114] Let me tell you something about kids, I have five of them, they're foolish, they're disobedient
[time=1122] and at times they can be downright rebellious.
[time=1124] That's a given, right?
[time=1125] You were, I was, they are, everybody's are.
[time=1127] That's a fact, children can be foolish and disobedient and rebellious, no matter how much you love them, no matter how wonderful they may be, they're just what they are.
[time=1136] Let me tell you now, there's a couple of options here.
[time=1138] Dad, you've got a foolish moment in the life of your child, you've got a disobedient moment in the life of your child, you've got a rebellious moment in the life of your child squaring you right in the face.
[time=1147] What are you going to do about it?
[time=1150] How are you going to respond?
[time=1151] A lot of dads are passive and do nothing.
[time=1154] They turn their back, they frown, they say little, they scow, but they get out of the situation
[time=1160] and they leave it to somebody else to deal with if anybody else wants to deal with it.
[time=1165] I call that no power.
[time=1167] There's no power.
[time=1168] The passive do nothing, no power approach to foolishness, disobedience, and rebellion.
[time=1173] The second approach that is often taken by fathers is what I call the abusive power and that's that explosive angry tone, that frame, that hand, that whatever it is that is out
[time=1184] of control, the words that shouldn't have been said, the attitude that should never have been conveyed, an explosive angry out of control, reaction to your child's foolishness, disobedience or rebellion.
[time=1194] That's abusive power.
[time=1195] Let me tell you about father power.
[time=1200] Father power is different.
[time=1203] Father power in the face of the foolishness of one of his children chooses not to explode and not to run away but to move, to move into the life of that child.
[time=1214] Father power begins to ask questions, not to find judgment, not to find the grounds for
[time=1220] disobedience so that he can listen because he's very interested to hear what is going
[time=1226] through the mind, the heart, and the emotional framework of his child in a foolish or disobedient or rebellious moment.
[time=1233] Father power moves in, it listens, it asks questions until it begins to feel the feelings
[time=1239] of that foolish or disobedient or rebellious child.
[time=1244] It engages the heart and the soul of the child.
[time=1247] It stops what it's doing, it composes itself and it very strategically with great wisdom begins to ask the kinds of questions that might surface the kinds of thinking and eventually the kinds of feeling that is going on inside of that beloved child that would provoke such a foolish, disobedient or rebellious act.
[time=1264] Father power then adds that critical, on-the-spot information through his already existing profile in that child, what the patterns of that child are, what the attitudes of that child are, what the personality of that child is, what the strengths and weaknesses of that child happen to be.
[time=1279] Coupled with a proper understanding of the stage of life of that child, whether just a weed toddler or a child or an adolescent or an emerging adult, Father power moves in.
[time=1290] You say, ask questions, what's he trying to understand, where is he going, where does it lead?
[time=1295] Let me give you two words.
[time=1298] First he's looking for how the child has been victimized, following people living in a fallen world, in a fallen family, with a fallen father, and a fallen mother, and fallen brother, and sisters, and fallen friends, what is behind this rebellious event in the life of your child?
[time=1312] Where's the hurt, where's the pain, where's the disillusionment that's going on inside of your child that provokes that kind of behavior?
[time=1319] Father power insightfully moves through questions and emotion and concern to try to surface
[time=1325] and to try to provoke in some gentle way an honest expression of what the child is really thinking in terms of what is the hurt and what is the pain and what is the unsatisfied longing that's existing inside the heart of that child.
[time=1338] Then Father power moves secondly to a thing called agency.
[time=1342] How is that child choosing to respond to the hardship of life, that trial, that injustice, that disappointment, that difficult situation?
[time=1353] My youngest daughter is Whitney.
[time=1357] She gets a buck for this, she's excited about it.
[time=1361] She's seven, Whitney is a precious jewel.
[time=1366] Whitney is truly the delight of her mother and her father as are her sisters.
[time=1371] Whitney tends to be liked by everyone she meets, every Sunday school teacher, every person that comes across her path, tends to say what a delightful, sweet, compliant, gracious little girl you have there, and of course they're understating it, in my opinion.
[time=1385] Not too long ago, Whitney began to change a little bit.
[time=1389] Whitney began to become antagonistic.
[time=1393] Whitney began to fight with her sisters just a little bit, was teasing, and was uncharacteristically unkind, was quarreling, if it was a toy it was between she and Bobby, if it was a TV show it was she and Kelly, if it was where we're going to sit in the car it might be me, you know, there were just things that weren't going on well.
[time=1411] Just an unusual kind of abrasive way to life, and I must admit there were times in this process
[time=1418] where I did the no power thing, I just turned my eyes the other way, got busy with something else and figured Heidi would deal with it at some point in time.
[time=1426] There were times in this little episode where I was abusive in my power and I mean by that I was short in my tone and short in my comments and unsupportive in my corrections of her and just trying to solve the problem with a little dab of discipline right there.
[time=1443] By God's grace this father power thing started moving in my life and in my heart and prompting of the Holy Spirit, got a quiet moment with Whitney, right on the heels of another one of these really abrasive moments, we got a loan together and I began to ask some questions, I began to listen, I went to school on what is going on inside the heart and mind of a
[time=1461] set, what is it like to be a seven year old in the more household with three older sisters and a younger brother who some think walk on water, you know, I mean what is it like to try to live inside this high house power environment, she began to tell me, tears streaming down
[time=1478] her face, she began to see in her little words what is it like to have three older sisters who are involved in all kinds of athletic events that take them sometimes across town, sometimes out of town that require brand new equipment and brand new shoes and brand new clothes and brand new stuff and what is it like to have all those older sisters have their friends over all the time and they're either having friends over or they're walking out the door saying goodbye, I'll see you tomorrow, I'll see you later tonight, she want to know how come all those big things were happening to all those big girls and how come it wasn't happening to her and she was beginning to wonder what was wrong with her and what was wrong with her life and what has she done and how come she was continually being left out of the picture and not getting the attention, man we were both crying by
[time=1518] the time she was done with that, she was right, it was hard, it was really hard, what about
[time=1527] her agency, so that's why you've been a little bit cantankerous, that's probably not the word I use but that's why you've been a little difficult, a little argumentative, that's why the fights and as I say her agency in response to that victimization was a lot of
[time=1542] shutdown, a lot of resentment, a lot of antagonism and the quarrels and the spats and the anger and the tears and the moods, well see it's right here, it's right here, the father power
[time=1553] and really oftentimes mother power gets to do it's work, two hearts connect and they say
[time=1562] sometimes without words but often with words I understand how hard that must be, I thank you for sharing with them, I didn't think about that, you're really right, I mean there is a lot of stuff going on, I could see how you could feel those way, whether let me tell you this your day is coming, you're seven, you know they're like seventh grade and eighth
[time=1579] grade and eleventh grade and they didn't get to do all that stuff when they were your age, it's not you, it's just your stage and your day is coming and I promise you you'll be doing all that stuff just like they are, maybe different things but you'll be on the go just like they are and we'll be following you around all over town trying to keep up with all your activities, it's going to happen, it's just your little young right now and Whitney by the way you're right, we are a little bit out of balance, there are some things that we need to do to shore this thing up and so who would you like to have over here in the next week or so and what are you thinking along this and how can we balance that and what can we do over here and at the end of that little chat though, I had to say it,
[time=1618] I had to say you know I understand how you're feeling and I think some things you had to balance here but you got to know something, if this stuff keeps up, you're going to get a spanking, there are consequences for your behavior, I understand why you're hurting but you're responsible to act in a way that honors God even though you're hurting, it's my job to discipline you if you don't, wow big smiles, big hugs, she felt loved, she felt secure,
[time=1642] the boundaries are back, I feel understood, I know where I fit, I can live again, that's what she's been doing, back to a normal self by and large, I don't want to make this sound overly simplistic, this is happening, these kinds of conversations are happening at every single level in my house, father power, you see father power turns failures and disobedience
[time=1664] and rebellion into character shaping events, who's going to let her know about how hard
[time=1670] it is to live in a broken sin infested world, who's going to identify with her that life doesn't work the way you want it to go and people don't always love you the way they should and people can let you down and even when they're not life just hurts sometimes, who besides a father or a mother ever is really going to get inside to the level that they can share that and who besides a loving father and a loving mother are going to come alongside and say I understand all that, we can make a few corrections but the reality is you have got to live in a way that honors God even if it hurts.
[time=1700] Summer challenge, let me ask you guys a question, can you think of anything more satisfying
[time=1706] to do this summer with your time than moving in asking questions, carefully listening and feeling the feelings with your child or your children so you can have some connecting experiences where this idea of victimization and agency come in to focus for maybe the first time and you begin to see real change and real growth in the life of your child, anything you can think of that is more fun than that, anything you can think of more meaningful than that, I don't think there is, I honestly ask myself that question, I don't think there's
[time=1735] one thing I'm going to do this summer that would be more fulfilling and more gratifying
[time=1741] and moving in with the purpose to ask important questions to listen in a non-judgmental way
[time=1748] to allow them to surface what's really going on in their heart and to connect with them at that level, it's the big bonus for the summer, number 3, number 3, father power turns
[time=1758] average people into champions, this is so true and it's so good, father power turns
[time=1764] average people into champions, let me tell you about every child that ever was, every child that ever was is unique, right, snowflake, there's no tool like, no tool in my household,
[time=1775] no tool in your household, there's no two children who are ever alike, they're all unique, second fact, they're all gifted, every single child has been gifted and that means that
[time=1785] they are unique and they are gifted which makes them uniquely gifted, true, every child
[time=1791] is uniquely gifted and I'm not talking about the super talent uniquely gifted tiger woods type or the brainy kid that beats all the school records and academics or the exceptionally
[time=1802] gorgeous child that just somehow got given all the really good physical genetic genes, I'm just talking about the fact that every single child is unique and every single one of them is gifted and that means every one of them is uniquely gifted, in fact I think we need to work against the stereotype that you're only gifted if you're super bright, if you're super athletic or if you're super good looking, I think there's a whole other range of giftedness and we need to minimize the stuff that the world throws at us and lift up the other stuff that is true about our kids.
[time=1833] As a dad, as a father, father power, it is your unique privilege to help your child, number one, believe that he or she is uniquely gifted, that's quite a task, help them actually believe that they are uniquely gifted, to discover what that unique gifted it is, gifted it is, to develop that giftedness, to learn the boundaries of that giftedness, oh yeah
[time=1853] I'm gifted and that's a wonderful thing but it only goes so far, character has to take me the rest of the way, to celebrate that unique giftedness and then here's the wonderful thing when you finally help them learn to minister that giftedness and to give that giftedness away.
[time=1870] Every child uniquely gifted, Dr. Jim Hines from his book The Farmer's Wife says it this way, nearly every child has at least one unique strength or talent.
[time=1881] Only a few stand out head and shoulders above the rest in schoolwork but academic brilliance is only one kind of gift, schools focus on it but we must not let that blind us to children's
[time=1892] many other gifts, we must nurture every gift of every child not to do so is a sheer waste
[time=1899] and he lists 20 of them ready, curiosity is a gift, away with people, perseverance, ambition,
[time=1907] organization, courage, coordination, dexterity, music, art, dramatics, physical strength, just
[time=1915] the raw physical strength that some people have, fluency, listening, wit, perceptual awareness,
[time=1922] energy, calmness, anger and by that he means inability to tolerate injustice, a sense of
[time=1929] humor.
[time=1930] There's 20 of them right there as I was reading through those, this week I read it through the first time kind of at an academic level just saying, boy, I want to know what those 20 are.
[time=1939] And I came back to a little bit later and I put a child, one of my own children's name in my mind and I read through those things and I was astounded at how many gifts they have and maybe how we are wrongly overemphasizing just one or two of them and how there's a whole
[time=1955] another like spectrum that needs to be engaged in.
[time=1961] He finishes his article this way, he said, "Gifted adults were once gifted children.
[time=1966] The lucky ones whose particular talents were detected and valued by their parents." Did you hear that?
[time=1971] Let me say it again.
[time=1972] "Gifted adults, the people you now recognize as gifted, gifted adults were once just gifted children.
[time=1977] The lucky ones whose particular talents were detected and valued by parents." Look at what your child does.
[time=1983] Look at all he does with his mind, his body, his feelings, his ideas, his materials and with people.
[time=1989] Look at the full scope of who he is.
[time=1992] Then he adds, "Do not pressure him and please do be honest.
[time=1996] You do not help your child by seeing a talent that does not exist." I'll tell you what, I'll do something with you today.
[time=2008] If your dad here today or a mother here today and that list ran by a little too quick and
[time=2014] you want to call my office this week, I will send you a copy of that article free of charge.
[time=2018] Just call my office, give us your name and address and we'll fire it right out to you.
[time=2020] I feel that strongly about it.
[time=2022] Then you and your wife, you and your spouse can have that thing in your hand and you can begin with each child's name in your mind to look through that list and begin to find the things that this summer you want to begin to cultivate and to cherish in that child.
[time=2034] Let me give you a principle I learned a long, long time ago in a very bad situation I had with my eldest daughter Randy where I was improperly discipling her, kind of the guru of child ministry at Graysh Community Church where I grew up as a man, was a man by the name of Dr. Fred Barsha and Fred looked at me and he said, "Russell, never forget this.
[time=2050] Never correct a fault in your child by focusing on faults.
[time=2060] Correct the faults in your child's life by focusing on their strength.
[time=2064] When you focus on their faults you deplete their self-image, you deplete the resources they need to change something that's wrong about them and so you put them in a tailspin by doing that.
[time=2075] You want to correct the faults of your children, focus on their strengths, build them up, give them a healthy sense of who they are, what their powers are, what their gifts are so they'll have the resources to change what is inadequate or strong or rebellious about them.
[time=2088] We'll never forget it, it was great advice.
[time=2092] Great advice.
[time=2093] Things that I cherish most as a child was when I was a senior in high school and a person
[time=2099] of average athletic talent but I happen to have ended up in a small school where I was captain of the football team and the quarterback of the football team and we had been co-champions
[time=2109] of our league and we were in our first round of the playoffs.
[time=2112] It was big stuff and we were playing a team called Fillmore and then this particular part of California the fog can settle in in certain seasons so that it's just, you can't hardly see your hand in front of your face.
[time=2122] Now this particular night, the night of our game, the fog settled in very, very low and you could no longer see the field from the stands.
[time=2130] Now I don't recommend this and it might not always work but it just somehow it did this
[time=2136] particular night but my dad was so committed to me and so concerned for me that he left the stands and came down onto the sidelines and every time I came off the field when the
[time=2146] head coach was done yelling and screaming at me for the mistakes I had just made while I was out there, I'd find my way over to him as the defense was trying to survive.
[time=2152] You know, the situation and he'd whisper four little words into the, in a little ear hole in my helmet, over and over and over again every time I came off the field he would whisper the same forwards, not so loud that anybody else would hear it and I would be embarrassed in front of my buddies.
[time=2167] He would just communicate the truth over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.
[time=2171] One of the best games I ever played, I was a hero that night, I threw a touchdown pass,
[time=2177] I ran for a touchdown that won the game, we went on to the next level, it was a celebrating moment in the life of my football career as limited as that may have been but it was even a bigger moment in the life of my time with my dad.
[time=2189] Well, what the four words were, over and over and over, you can do it.
[time=2198] And he said it in different ways.
[time=2199] Sometimes he would put the emphasis on to you, you, not anybody else, you can do this.
[time=2205] Sometimes you put the emphasis on the word can, you can do this, i.e. keep going, keep
[time=2211] trying, keep struggling, it was an amazing thing.
[time=2216] What is it like?
[time=2217] You know what it's like to have a parent, you know what it's like to have a father believe in you?
[time=2223] You have gifts, you have talents, you can go places, you can do this thing.
[time=2228] That really is nothing but the summit of the mountain peaks of my mom and dad's commitment to believe in me and to call me to use whatever gifts I might have had for the glory of God.
[time=2240] More challenge, summer challenge.
[time=2242] What kind of an investment are you willing to make in the lives of your kids to help them discover that they are uniquely gifted by God this summer?
[time=2250] What kinds of activities, what kinds of places, what kinds of things, what kind of reading?
[time=2254] I mean, not just physical abilities now, look at the whole realm of who they are, my question to you dad is this, what kind of an investment are you willing to make so that at the end of this summer you've got a child who has discovered a new and a fresh degree to which they have been uniquely gifted by God.
[time=2270] Once again, I don't think you can make a better investment of your time.
[time=2272] Number four, number four.
[time=2275] Father power turns insecure people into trophies of grace.
[time=2279] There's a common thread that runs through all of humanity and it doesn't matter if you live here or if you live in India, if you live in Russia, if you live anywhere in the world, the common thread exists all over the globe and it's always existed since humanity began, it's this, the longing, the longing to be loved.
[time=2294] It doesn't matter what language you put it in, it doesn't matter what food you wrap it around, what kind of dress they wear, what kind of clothing or housing.
[time=2302] It doesn't matter everybody who ever lived has a deep and say she will longing to have the sense that they are love.
[time=2310] Now you as a father, you put your child in one of two frameworks.
[time=2314] Framework number one is if you want my love, you earn it, you deserve it, you earn the right to be loved by me, you keep my rules, you obey me, you perform, you get good grades, you keep a submissive spirit and if all that stuff is kept often enough and regular enough, I'll give you my love.
[time=2333] Then there's this other framework called grace and that's the love that you give based on
[time=2341] your own commitment to love, not based on your child's commitment or ability to give
[time=2347] you what you want.
[time=2350] Grace says don't work for my love, don't try to deserve my love, just enjoy it because you already have it.
[time=2358] The most destructive father power in the world, the most abusive father power in the
[time=2364] world is the one that sends the message my love for you is to some degree conditional.
[time=2370] I will love you if you perform, I will love you if you obey, I will love you if you grow, I will love you if you persevere in this situation.
[time=2379] Father power abolishes that from the relationship entirely.
[time=2385] Father power says you need not perform or strive or achieve or accomplish for my love because you already have it.
[time=2392] Father power says you need not obey me or conform or comply or submit to me to earn my
[time=2398] love, you already have it.
[time=2401] Father power says you need not change or grow or alter or be different in any way for my love because you already have it.
[time=2409] Father power says you do not need to sustain this direction or persevere or continue or maintain this standard if you'd like to have my love because you already have it.
[time=2422] Summer challenge dads.
[time=2424] Summer challenge and I think this is true of all the things you want your kids to think about by the end of this summer, of all the messages you want your kids to get this summer.
[time=2432] As you fight your way through the static of all their activity and the static of all the things you're going to watch on TV and all the movies they're going to see and all the places they're going to go.
[time=2439] The one clear message I think you want to leave them with at the end of the summer is you know something your dad loves you unconditionally from the bottom of his heart.
[time=2451] Let me give you two practical helps on this.
[time=2453] Number one they need to sense it.
[time=2456] It can't just be said to them they need to sense it.
[time=2460] So here's my little tip of the day.
[time=2462] Say it to yourself as you are with them.
[time=2465] In your own mind to yourself quietly run the tape over and over again.
[time=2470] You're going out to take the trash out.
[time=2472] You're going to get a nice scream.
[time=2473] You're going to dive into the ball game.
[time=2474] You're eating dinner.
[time=2475] You're cleaning up the yard.
[time=2476] Just say it over and over to yourself quietly in your own little head.
[time=2479] Just say you know something I love you unconditionally.
[time=2482] I love this child with an everlasting love.
[time=2485] There's nothing this child could ever do that would ever spurn my love.
[time=2490] And you watch the indirect impact that it will have on your demeanor and your tones what they sense in your eyes, what they feel like from just being in your presence.
[time=2501] You don't have to say it at this level.
[time=2502] You have to say it to yourself over and over and over again and just let it flow.
[time=2507] See what happens.
[time=2510] Many of us run entirely different tapes.
[time=2512] Many of us run critical tapes.
[time=2513] Well, if you'd only done this, well, if you'd only done this, well, why didn't you say that?
[time=2517] Well, why did you do that?
[time=2518] Well, what about this?
[time=2519] Well, you're not responsible, you've got to be responsible.
[time=2520] Well, those all may be true.
[time=2524] But don't let that be the recurring tape that runs in your head.
[time=2527] The second thing, the second tip of the day here is you do need to say it.
[time=2530] You need to say it often and you need to say it clearly and you need to say it with arms and hugs and kisses.
[time=2536] I love you no matter what and you need to say that I love you no matter what on the heels of their greatest failure and you need to say I love you no matter what on the heels of their greatest success.
[time=2545] You need to say that failure won't change my love and that huge success.
[time=2548] You know what?
[time=2549] I don't love you anymore because of that success because I loved you anyway before you had that success.
[time=2553] You afterwards, even if you don't keep this success, you've got to come up with creative and powerful, different ways that capture their attention and captivate their heart that show them you mean what you are saying when you say I love you no matter what.
[time=2568] Find new and creative ways.
[time=2569] Do it over and over and over again.
[time=2571] Even when they say, oh, dad, I already know that.
[time=2573] Say it over again.
[time=2576] Say it more.
[time=2578] Number five.
[time=2580] Father power.
[time=2582] Father power turns lines of authority into meaningful relationship.
[time=2586] I want you to do this for a minute.
[time=2588] I want you to throw all the formal structural stuff of fatherhood out the window for a minute.
[time=2593] For a minute, I want you to pretend that you're not the God ordained authority in their life.
[time=2597] I want you to look at your kids and I want you to say, oh, so I'm not your father anymore.
[time=2602] I don't have that line of authority.
[time=2604] I'm not the provider.
[time=2605] I'm not responsible to pay for your food and your clothing and your insurance.
[time=2608] I'm not responsible to correct your character.
[time=2610] I'm just another human being on this planet with you.
[time=2613] Now line them up with the other people in your life.
[time=2615] Put them all in a row.
[time=2616] There's no special father relationship going on right here with your kids, and I've got a question for you.
[time=2620] Who do you want to spend time with?
[time=2625] Who captivates your interest?
[time=2629] Who draws you to them?
[time=2632] You'll never know what it means to have a meaningful relationship with your kids unless you strip in your mind all the formal structural stuff that obligates you to them and them to you.
[time=2640] You've got to find ways and times to get that out of your heart, just like we do in our relationship with God.
[time=2646] We've got to let go.
[time=2647] If I never went to church again, if I never read the Bible again, if I never gave to the church again, if I never did the form of religion again, would I still love God in my heart?
[time=2659] Ask yourself that question, and I think you'll find a resounding "yes" exploding out of
[time=2665] your own inner man.
[time=2667] So oftentimes we deceive ourselves, or we let the ritual get in our way, and we think the only reason that we're involved is because we're supposed to be.
[time=2677] So strip the supposed to be's, and look at that little child, look at that life, look at that budding young man, or that budding young woman, and say, "I have all the people in the world who I want to spend time with.
[time=2689] What's you?
[time=2690] I want to be your friend.
[time=2695] I choose friendship with you.
[time=2698] I want to pursue you as a person." Well, we're almost ready to close, but I can't resist this.
[time=2705] Some of you are here today, and you've never had a father like that.
[time=2708] I mean, I haven't had a father like that.
[time=2710] My kids don't have a father like that, but I mean, you never even got close to that kind of experience, and maybe what makes matters worse is you don't understand what it means
[time=2721] to have a relationship with your heavenly father.
[time=2726] Let me tell you something.
[time=2727] No matter what kind of home you came from, every single one of us has a heavenly father.
[time=2733] The God who is in heaven longs to treat us and to behave towards us like has been described
[time=2740] in this message.
[time=2741] Let me show you.
[time=2742] Number one, your heavenly father, not your earthly father now, your heavenly father wants to turn the ordinary experiences of your life into the times of your lives.
[time=2752] It says in John 10-10, Jesus is speaking on behalf of his father, and he says this, "I came that they might have life and that they might have it abundantly." Life without a personal relationship with the heavenly father is just like going through the motions.
[time=2765] You get married, but it's not what you thought it would be.
[time=2767] You have kids, but it's not as meaningful as you'd hoped.
[time=2770] You have a job, but it just seems well, it's just a job.
[time=2773] Recreation is just recreation, and even a beautiful day like this leaves something longing in your heart.
[time=2780] Heavenly father power turns the ordinary experiences of life into the times of your lives.
[time=2786] He wants to walk with you.
[time=2787] He wants to teach you.
[time=2788] He wants to encourage you.
[time=2789] He wants to support you.
[time=2791] He wants to give you an entirely different view on money and time and people and sin and what it means to love and how to really live.
[time=2799] Trying to live without that heavenly father power is like walking through life and black
[time=2805] and white, and there's a whole another reality awaiting you.
[time=2809] As he comes into your life, he forgives you of your sins to the person of Jesus Christ, and you begin to live because there's heavenly father power in your world.
[time=2820] The second point I made was heavenly about real fathers or natural fathers, physical fathers.
[time=2825] Here's the second one.
[time=2826] Heavenly father power turns your failures and your disobedience and your rebellion into character-shaping victories, and with many of you, God is still working to do that.
[time=2836] You rebelled.
[time=2837] You ran away from him.
[time=2838] You disobeyed from him.
[time=2840] You turned your life over to things you know you should never have given yourself to, and now you think that God is so angry he could never forgive you, and he wants to throw you into hell for all of eternity, and that is not the truth, because heavenly father power
[time=2853] is totally committed in turning your failures, your disobedience, and your rebellion into character-shaping victory.
[time=2860] He says in Hebrews 12 verse 7, "It is for discipline that you endure, and God deals with you as with sons." Did you hear that?
[time=2867] Do you love your son?
[time=2868] That is how God loves you.
[time=2869] And then it goes on to say, "For what son is there whom his father does not discipline?" God is looking at the events of your life.
[time=2876] He's looking at your rebellion and your foolishness and your disobedience, and he is hoping that eventually that will compound the place that you give it all to him, and say, "Now God, please help me understand why I hurt so bad, why life is so empty, why even the best of
[time=2892] days leave me longing for more.
[time=2894] Help me understand the ways in which I have been victimized, and oh God, teach me what it means to use my choices and my agencies to honor you."
[time=2905] He stands with arms open wide, even as the drama portrayed Matthew 18 in the Prodigal Son, that was God's story.
[time=2911] It comes right out of the scriptures, and God is pictured there in that armchair, and the other son is saying, "Give up on him, he's not coming back, and God your heavenly father is sitting there like this, today he's saying, "Come home." We can make something big out of those failures, that foolishness and that rebellion, but you got to come.
[time=2932] Number three, heavenly father power turns average people into champions, and this is so true.
[time=2937] Jesus says in Ephesians 2-10, "For we are God's workmanship created in Christ Jesus for good works which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them." God is like a master painter, and when you accept Jesus Christ into your heart, into your life, God will take the mess of your life, and he'll begin to paint it into something gorgeous and something beautiful, and you notice it says the good works, not to be saved
[time=2959] by your good works, but to walk in those good works that God prepared for you, before the foundation of the world.
[time=2964] He's got a purpose for you.
[time=2965] He wants to use you.
[time=2968] He wants to help you believe that you're uniquely gifted because you are.
[time=2971] He wants you to help you discover the ways you're gifted, and develop the ways you're gifted, and celebrate your giftedness, and then ultimately he wants to help you minister your gifts.
[time=2979] Not like I minister as a professional pastor type guy, I'm just talking as an average ordinary, wonderful human being that's been uniquely gifted by God, and you walk through your world and you touch people you love about in powerful and meaningful ways as you use your giftedness.
[time=2993] There's another way to live, it's called living under the influence of heavenly father power.
[time=2997] He can make that difference in your life.
[time=3002] Number four said this about fathers, and I say about the heavenly father, that heavenly father power turns insecure people into trophies of grace.
[time=3011] Remember there were two frameworks that a father could set up with his children.
[time=3013] Number one, you can work and try to deserve my love and try to prove yourself and try to sustain and maintain and keep up the pressure in your life so that maybe at the end of life I'll love you.
[time=3023] There are some people who think that's how it works with God.
[time=3026] Some people think that God the heavenly father's got these scales and he's measuring the good stuff against the bad stuff, and if you can just pour enough of the good stuff on there then at the end of the age he'll finally say okay, you can take a break from all your work now, I'll love you, you've earned it, you've deserved it.
[time=3040] And you know what God says about that?
[time=3042] God says that is blasphemous.
[time=3044] God hates that structure, he hates that framework, that is not how you get right with God.
[time=3050] God says I am a God of grace, I am a God of mercy, I am a God of forgiveness, and you
[time=3056] need not work or strive or achieve or maintain to have my love because you already have it.
[time=3062] I expressed it to you in the death of my own son Jesus Christ who paid the penalty for all your foolishness, disobedience and rebellion.
[time=3069] Just reach your hands out and accept the gift of Jesus Christ.
[time=3074] God is not the kind of father that puts us in the work paradigm, he is a grace paradigm God.
[time=3084] Number five, heavenly father power turns lines of authority into meaningful relationship.
[time=3089] If you're here today and you don't know Christ, you know what it means to be under the line of authority with God.
[time=3094] You know what it means to have the displeasure of God in your life because of your unconfessed sin, because of the fact that you are spurning the work of Jesus Christ in your life.
[time=3102] You know what it's like to feel the guilt and the pain and the pressure of all your disobedience.
[time=3106] And the heavenly father power seeks to turn that guilt and that shame and that contempt that you have about yourself or your sin into a meaningful relationship with God.
[time=3116] John 3 17 says this, I love this verse, not 3 16, but 3 17 says this, "For God did not
[time=3122] send the Son into the world to judge the world." Your heavenly father did not send his Son into this world so that his Son could judge you for your sin.
[time=3131] That is not why Christ came.
[time=3134] What's the end of the verse say, "But that the world should be saved through Christ."
[time=3140] You see God is endeavoring in longing to change the line of wrath and authority in your life
[time=3146] to meaningful relationship.
[time=3147] God wants to walk with you, he wants to talk with you, he wants to spend the rest of your days on earth here.
[time=3152] He wants to be a part of your life as you live it and then when you die he wants you to take you to the glories of heaven.
[time=3157] Jesus said it very clearly, "No man cometh unto the Father but through me." You want to experience heavenly power in your life?
[time=3166] Heavenly Father power, you want to walk with God, you cannot do it through church, you cannot do it through the Bible, you cannot do it through works, you cannot do it through your own effort, you can only do it through a personal relationship with the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=3179] And if you'll give your life to Christ and let him forgive you of your sins and accept him as your Lord and Savior, then the heavenly Father power begins to take its place in your life and things change.
[time=3192] Things change in a great way.
[time=3196] Lot of stories come out of the gulf, right?
[time=3198] The gulf war.
[time=3199] I'm almost done, we're almost out of here.
[time=3202] One of them comes from a guy by the name of Captain Evans.
[time=3205] Captain Evans flew an A10E I guess, it's a Warthog, one of those jets that was especially
[time=3211] designed to fly very low over the infantry and give them support in the gulf war.
[time=3217] These planes because of their low proximity and slow flying speed have been given additional armament and so typically the pilot is safe but not always the plane itself.
[time=3228] Captain Evans had flown 20 successful sorties into Kuwait supporting the men on foot.
[time=3234] The 21st sortie that he was asked to fly was against the Iraqi Republican guard, the most fortified of all.
[time=3241] He had a sneaking feeling about this whole event and sure enough the 23mm cannons ripped along the side of his plane and while he was safe the warning lights inside of his cockpit began to explode.
[time=3251] The plane shuttered and rocked and tumbled and a thin line blue smoke began to flow out
[time=3257] the back of his aircraft.
[time=3258] He was fearful that at any given moment the hydraulic system would fail, he would crash behind enemy lines.
[time=3266] the account. Yet as part of the best trained Air Force in the world, Evans forced aside
[time=3272] the fear that trawled into the cockpit with him and made his mind go through a rigid checklist
[time=3278] in preparation for an emergency landing. Controlling his thoughts, he says, airspeed check, altimeter
[time=3285] check, fuel levels check, family check, hydraulic pressure check, ILS check, flaps check, family
[time=3294] check. In spite of himself, the one thought our friend couldn't hold captive was the one he
[time=3304] treasured most of all. Home, the picture of a loving wife and three children, the youngest only
[time=3312] three, was zipped inside the top pocket of his flight suit. Just let me get home Lord, just let
[time=3323] me get home. As we closed this morning, I want you to know the number one reason why kids grow up
[time=3330] without father power. The number one reason why kids grow up without father power is a thing called
[time=3337] the focus factor. Fathers lose their focus. They think they are here to have a job and a career and
[time=3344] to earn money and to provide an existence for their family and for themselves. They lose focus and
[time=3350] they begin to think that there are other things more important and greater demands and louder
[time=3356] voices calling for their attention. And they say to themselves, you know, I'm going to get back
[time=3362] on track with my kids next week. I just got to get this one project finished and I'll be on the job.
[time=3367] I just got to get to this next month and then I'll be right back where I ought to be.
[time=3371] Oh, you know, it's been a tough year. I got another really tough year coming, but I'm sure at the end of this next year, I'll really be in position to get back involved with my family.
[time=3380] You know, I'm going to get this thing into balance very, very soon. We say to ourselves, well, there are some men who have sat where you have sat in this very sanctuary, who have been a
[time=3392] part of this church, who no longer sit in these pews. And if they could be here today, they would
[time=3398] stand here and they would say to you, do not deceive yourself with the promises of tomorrow.
[time=3405] Love your children today because tomorrow may never come.
[time=3409] Several years ago, one of our elders, a man who helped build this church, the father of three,
[time=3416] Jim Hindle, was getting up on that morning like any other morning and was heading off to do his exercises. He was a phenomenal racquetball player, a picture of health, went over to IPFW to run his
[time=3426] several miles around their track and drop dead. If he were standing here today, he would say to
[time=3434] you, knowing what he knows, hey, don't believe the lies about tomorrow. Not too long ago, a man
[time=3440] that ministered to most of the Christian listening community in Fort Wayne, a man by the name of Jeff Carlson, was driving home from Ohio, just a routine deal over to Ohio and come back and
[time=3451] working on some things there, driving in his car. And for reasons we don't fully understand, he goes outside the yellow line there on a curve and crashes right into a truck.
[time=3461] He doesn't sit in his pews anymore and he has lost the privilege of loving his family and
[time=3467] thankfully he did the days of his life. It wasn't too long ago that another man by the name of Scott,
[time=3474] Scott Hevel, and really we honor him and Jeff and Jim and all the other
[time=3481] fathers that aren't with us today because from reasons we don't fully understand, got his chosen to take them home. Scott, the father of four, madly in love with his wife,
[time=3492] working hard and having great success at staying focused on his family. If he were here today,
[time=3501] he would say this to you, this is your highest calling. There is no greater thing you'll ever
[time=3508] apply yourself to than to love your wife and your kids. He would say this is the true measure
[time=3515] of a man, not how much he makes, not how much people he commands in the workplace, not his accomplishments, not those outside successes, be those what they may, that is not the measure of a man. In a moment, I'll give you our address so you can receive a copy of lessons on assurance.
