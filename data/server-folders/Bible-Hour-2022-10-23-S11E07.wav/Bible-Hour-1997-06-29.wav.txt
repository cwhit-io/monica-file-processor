[time=30] First, this morning, I want to talk about the author himself.
[time=45] I want to talk about Peter.
[time=46] I don't know about you, but when I receive a letter from somebody, if it's lengthy at all, more than one page, I don't start up here with Dear Russell.
[time=54] As soon as I'm done opening the thing, and I can't immediately recognize who wrote it on the first page, because it goes to a second or a third or a fourth, I flip back and I find out who wrote me the letter, and then I go back and I read the letter.
[time=66] In much the same way, I want to spend a moment acquainting you or reminding you of who has written first Peter, and it's very appropriate for a patriotic celebration such as this.
[time=84] This is the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=88] Thank you for joining us.
[time=89] Today, Pastor Moore begins a series from the book of first Peter.
[time=93] In Peter, the man of his message, we look at the life of Peter and how the Lord used his ministry.
[time=99] We hope you'll stay tuned.
[time=101] Now let's join our service.
[time=114] It's a celebration, all across the nation, everybody think.
[time=124] It's a celebration, say it again it's a celebration, let freedom ring, not a celebrate, it's a
[time=137] celebration, all across the nation, everybody think.
[time=143] It's a celebration, say it again it's a celebration, let freedom ring, celebrate.
[time=153] Thank you, we thank you Lord, for blessing from above.
[time=160] Thank you, we thank you Lord, for freedom and for love, we thank you Lord, for liberty.
[time=170] We thank you for this man, because of you, we can be free, let's take a spin, it's a
[time=184] celebration, all across the nation, everybody think, it's a celebration, say it again,
[time=192] it's a celebration, let freedom ring, a celebration, America, America, America, God
[time=205] shed his grace on ease, and proud my good, with brotherhood, from sea to shining sea.
[time=221] It's a celebration, all across the nation, everybody think, it's a celebration, say
[time=232] it again, it's a celebration, let freedom ring, celebrate, come on and celebrate, celebrate.
[time=248] America, land out the free, Big Mac with purchase of large fry and soft drink, home
[time=264] of beanie babies and Michael Jordan, where brave is really more of a reference to fighting
[time=270] the crowds at Glenbrook Mall than fighting in the armed services.
[time=275] A tour of Bosnia might be a tad bit safer than the 14 hour sale at Ayers, America, where
[time=282] one trip to Myers can get you, potatoes from Idaho, muffin tins from Canada, cornflakes
[time=289] from Battle Creek, shoes from Brazil, a clock radio from China, chocolate chips from Germany,
[time=297] olive oil from Italy, Snapple from Chicago, and coffee beans from some guy by the name
[time=303] of Juan Valdez.
[time=305] Do you realize how lucky you are?
[time=307] Do you realize you could have been born somewhere else?
[time=311] And do you realize that if someone hadn't sacrificed to help establish this country, you wouldn't be talking on a cell phone today?
[time=319] We take it off for granted, don't we?
[time=321] All the stuff we have.
[time=324] Maybe if we spent a few days living in a third world country, we'd be more grateful for what we have.
[time=330] And maybe we'd be gripped by the fact that we didn't do anything to deserve to be born here in the United States.
[time=337] God just graciously plopped us here.
[time=340] And if you really think long and hard about that, you'll eventually come to realize the awesome responsibility that we carry as a nation because where much is given, much will
[time=352] be required.
[time=353] Our fathers built this land on the foundation of the word.
[time=360] They gave their lives for truth and liberty.
[time=365] But today there's something missing.
[time=370] We've pushed aside God's word.
[time=373] It seems we've lost our reason to believe.
[time=378] The banners torn in tattered beneath the cloud of sin.
[time=385] And it's time we took a miracle back to the cross again.
[time=391] We gotta love what another stand together, fight this war no matter what the cost.
[time=403] We gotta pray for our children and turn our hearts to heaven, and seek to be one nation
[time=412] under God.
[time=419] We bow to this world's idols.
[time=422] We have built our Babylon.
[time=425] When will we see we're on a dead end course?
[time=431] Although we used to stand amazed at the miracle of birth, but now it's nothing more than just
[time=440] a choice.
[time=441] You see the world is slowly dying and the end is drawing here, but our only hope is
[time=451] Jesus.
[time=452] We gotta let the whole world hear.
[time=459] We gotta love what another stand together, fight this war no matter what the cost.
[time=471] We gotta pray for our children and turn our hearts to heaven and seek to be one nation
[time=481] and turn our hearts to heaven and seek to be one nation under God.
[time=497] We gotta love what another stand together, fight this war no matter what the cost.
[time=510] We gotta pray for our children and turn our hearts to heaven and seek to be one nation
[time=523] under God.
[time=524] We gotta love what another stand together, fight this war no matter what the cost.
[time=533] We gotta pray for our children and turn our hearts to heaven and seek to be one nation
[time=552] under God, one nation under God.
[time=576] I remember saying that phrase every morning in Mrs. Bixler's second grade class.
[time=588] I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for
[time=595] which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, that means undivided, with liberty and justice
[time=603] for all.
[time=607] You know we are so far from that, from being under God, not just as a nation but as individuals.
[time=615] For those of us who know God personally, sometimes I wonder if he's ashamed to call us his.
[time=620] The way we live our lives so emotionally shut down from all the hurting people around us.
[time=626] God has a passion for the loss and the hurting.
[time=629] God has a passion for you no matter what hurt you're wrestling with.
[time=634] He loves you so deeply that he would rather die than live without you.
[time=641] He was 21 in 1944.
[time=654] He was hope and he was courage on a lonely shore, sent there by mother with love beyond
[time=666] her tears, just a young American who chose to rise above his fears and as I watch him
[time=677] struggle love that you, without a thought of turning back, I cannot help the wonders.
[time=692] What did he die for when he died for you and me?
[time=699] Made the sacrifice so that we could all be free?
[time=706] I believe we will answer each to heaven.
[time=714] For the way we spend a priceless liberty, look inside and ask the question, what did
[time=727] he die for when he died for me?
[time=743] To the darkest day in A.D. 33 came the mercy and compassion of eternity sent there by the
[time=759] father with love beyond his tears, lame last one, the only son to bear the guilt of all
[time=771] these years and as I watch him struggle love that he'll, without a thought of turning back,
[time=781] I cannot help the wonders.
[time=788] What did he die for when he died for you and me?
[time=795] He made the sacrifice so that we could all be free?
[time=803] I believe we will answer each to heaven.
[time=811] For the way we spend a priceless liberty, look inside and ask the question, what did
[time=824] he die for?
[time=825] He died for freedom, he died for love and all the things we do to pay him back could
[time=841] never be enough, what did he die for when he died for you and me?
[time=854] He made the sacrifice so that we could all be free?
[time=861] I believe we will answer each to heaven.
[time=870] For the way we spend our priceless liberty, look inside and ask the question, what did
[time=884] he die for?
[time=888] When he died for me?
[time=897] Oh, does he die for you and me?
[time=916] My dear brother, dear Frank, to Hiram, how?
[time=921] Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=926] I thank my God for you, for your perseverance and your steadfast hope.
[time=932] How can I thank you for this past year?
[time=934] For the friend you've been, you've always stood firm, you've never wavered.
[time=938] I know it's been a long time since we've seen each other.
[time=942] For some reason I've been thinking about all the acquaintances lately.
[time=946] Yeah, it's me, surprise, no, I haven't fallen off the face of the earth, a lot of times
[time=953] I wanted of you have.
[time=955] I write to you from a prison in Jerusalem where I'm being held for preaching Jesus Christ to the Gentiles.
[time=961] It's my 37th month at Angola, but time just seems to stand still here, especially on death
[time=968] row.
[time=969] I've been assigned to the dungeon prison in the Roman barracks in Jerusalem.
[time=974] It's not much different than the prison in Antioch except colder and dirtier if that's
[time=982] possible.
[time=983] I'm working a graveyard shift, beginner to Angova, yeah, stuck, and what a pit.
[time=991] I might as well be one of the inmates.
[time=995] I was put in chains by the Romans to keep me from being killed by an angry crowd of Jews.
[time=1000] It's been several hours now since sunset and I continue to hear the shouting and crying above me in the streets.
[time=1008] Sometimes I marvel at the anger still in the world.
[time=1011] There was a riot yesterday, you've probably heard about it in the news, strange.
[time=1016] No one was trying to escape, three guys just went berserk, nine more ended up dead.
[time=1024] With all the pent up hate and anger around here, I guess I should be surprised it doesn't happen more often.
[time=1031] And now as if things weren't black enough, another one of those itinerant holy men came through today.
[time=1038] For someone who claims to preach only love, he certainly stirs up hate.
[time=1042] The Romans want him exiled, the Jews seem to want him dead.
[time=1049] And what a world has become when being chained to a prison is the safest place for someone.
[time=1055] And now another riot, well, I managed to keep clear, but I swear, I wish they'd just let
[time=1061] this come kill each other off, or the world would sure be a better place.
[time=1067] If the truth be known, my brother, I almost welcome the silence of this cell.
[time=1072] I even welcome the shackles.
[time=1075] God must force me to be still and examine the storm that only seems to swirl around me.
[time=1082] And how fitting to lift my hands to him and feel the weight of earthly chains knowing I have long ago been set free from my sin through Christ Jesus.
[time=1091] In your last letter, you asked if the solitude and endless rows of steel bars ever got to me.
[time=1096] In all honesty, I must tell you, no, not anymore.
[time=1100] I don't mind the separation from the world.
[time=1103] And the world and what I did with it is how I got here, funny.
[time=1107] But even the bars seem to remind me that I'm free from all that now.
[time=1112] Ever since you helped me find Jesus last year.
[time=1116] There's this prisoner that both the Romans and the Jews seem to hate.
[time=1121] Paul is his name, I believe.
[time=1123] And not only do I have this scumb to contend with, but also certified fruitcakes like this
[time=1130] one guy named Ray.
[time=1133] There's no one in the prison tonight, except the jailer.
[time=1137] There's been a new guard assigned to my cell block.
[time=1139] What a strange man he is.
[time=1141] Absolutely crazy.
[time=1142] He seems so sad and so alone.
[time=1145] He's very bitter and full of rage.
[time=1148] He came to jail like I used to be.
[time=1150] He even blessed those that put the shackles on.
[time=1154] Most prisoners curse and yell the entire time about getting out.
[time=1157] But this Paul is strangely quiet, almost content.
[time=1163] Sometimes I wonder if he even knows where he is.
[time=1165] I quit trying to figure Ray out.
[time=1168] I mean, here's a guy who got nobody on the outside who shoots somebody during a robbery
[time=1176] and gets first degree and now has maybe three months left.
[time=1182] But every morning, when I check on him, he seems almost happy.
[time=1190] Like he's looking forward to something crazy, absolutely crazy.
[time=1198] This place must be getting to both of us.
[time=1201] I've tried to talk to this jailer, but I'm not so much, no so much what he's heard.
[time=1207] Having a conversation with this guard has been almost impossible, but I keep trying.
[time=1212] This prisoner keeps telling me about a man who came to take the punishment for my sins.
[time=1218] Even died for me.
[time=1221] This Paul says there is no condemnation for those who believe this man and I've never
[time=1227] even met him.
[time=1228] Now how can that be?
[time=1230] How can this be?
[time=1232] This jive ray keeps handing me about some guy a long time ago, forgiving all the trash I've heaped in my life.
[time=1240] Some guy I don't even know, loving me.
[time=1243] In spite of everything, no condemnation ray said, yeah, right.
[time=1251] That ain't the way justice in this world is dolled out.
[time=1255] I wish I could help him.
[time=1257] It's something I can always do.
[time=1261] Remember him in your prayer, pray for him.
[time=1264] Well, it's of little matter to anyone.
[time=1268] Hello who gives a rip, nobody I know.
[time=1273] So my dear brother, until I am able to write again, well, I better be going.
[time=1278] I must return to my watch, perhaps this year I'll hear from you.
[time=1283] That's it I guess, call some time if you remember.
[time=1288] Please greet the brethren in abundant love of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1291] In the amazing love of our Lord.
[time=1294] Until next time.
[time=1295] Later.
[time=1296] Grace.
[time=1297] Peace be with you.
[time=1299] I'd like to begin this morning with a kind of a visualization exercise, so if you'll
[time=1307] trust me for this, close your eyes.
[time=1309] I promise I'll stay right here and you stay right there.
[time=1311] We'll just do something with our imaginations.
[time=1315] With your eyes closed, I'd like to ask you to picture yourself at work.
[time=1318] If you're a homemaker, then busy at work, making your home.
[time=1323] If you're in industry somewhere and see yourself, please, engrossed in what you're doing.
[time=1327] In a typical way.
[time=1330] Without any warning or anything to set you off, you look up and there you see a religious
[time=1336] leader standing looking at you.
[time=1338] You don't know much about this religious leader.
[time=1340] You've only known about him for about a year.
[time=1342] You met him briefly a year ago, but you've heard a lot about him and his powers and what he does.
[time=1349] He looks at you and he says this, "Follow me and I will make you become a fisher of
[time=1357] men." Okay, open your eyes.
[time=1365] As I participated in that myself in my office this week, I saw several different reactions in my own mind.
[time=1371] Number one was, "I'm not going to follow you.
[time=1374] I already have a course for my life.
[time=1377] I'm not just aimlessly floating through life here.
[time=1380] I've made some decisions in the past.
[time=1382] I have some values.
[time=1383] I have some principles.
[time=1384] You want me to follow you?" Another reaction was, "What do you mean you will make me?
[time=1393] You will make me.
[time=1394] How are you going to make me?
[time=1396] Are you going to force me?
[time=1398] You're going to coerce me?
[time=1399] Do I voluntarily sign up and having done so lose all prerogatives over my life?" And I end up being a fisher of men by your power in my life to coerce me into some course of action.
[time=1410] Finally, "What do you mean you're going to make me?" The third reaction I had was, "I don't know if I want to become a fisher of men."
[time=1423] Many of you might have been thinking, "I like my vocation.
[time=1426] I don't want to be a missionary for anyone, any religious leader.
[time=1430] I like my job.
[time=1431] I enjoy my job.
[time=1432] I'm good at my job and I have absolutely no intentions of changing my job."
[time=1438] This morning we're going to start a study in the book of 1 Peter.
[time=1442] We're going to spend the rest of the summer studying the book of 1 Peter and we're going to learn about a living hope and we're going to learn about a life of holiness and we're going to learn about how to live a life that is full of loving and meaningful passionate relationships.
[time=1455] We're going to learn about what it means to submit to authority and what makes a marriage work and how to have a clean conscience and on and on and on.
[time=1462] These topics are going to come and we'll be refreshed in our heart as we study this book.
[time=1466] And this morning, I'd like to just talk about the author.
[time=1469] I'd like to just talk about Peter.
[time=1470] I don't know about you, but when I receive a letter from somebody, if it's longer than a page, I don't just immediately read the letter.
[time=1477] I'm finding myself diving back page two, page three, page--oh, there it is.
[time=1482] That's who wrote me the letter, respectfully so-and-so.
[time=1484] Then I go to the beginning and I read the letter and the knowledge that I have about that individual and their opinions about life and their life experiences.
[time=1493] What makes the letter so much more meaningful to me, I think I get a better grip on what there might be intending or feeling or going through as they write.
[time=1501] I'd like to give you a chance to do that same thing this morning rather than diving into the letter.
[time=1506] Let's think about who wrote the letter for a moment.
[time=1508] The visualization exercise we encountered this morning as I began speaking was actually happening to Peter.
[time=1516] That's how it happened in his life.
[time=1517] He had met Christ a year earlier.
[time=1519] It was a brief encounter.
[time=1520] He didn't have much conversation with Christ.
[time=1523] He had definitely heard about Christ.
[time=1524] He'd heard about the miracles.
[time=1525] He'd heard some of the phenomenal teaching.
[time=1527] He'd heard about the claims to be the Messiah that was promised in the Old Testament.
[time=1531] He, of course, being a Jew looking for, anticipating the coming of a Messiah.
[time=1537] But a year had gone by and he was in this boat or on the seashore and he was busily engaged in his vocation.
[time=1543] He was a fisherman by vocation.
[time=1546] It wasn't a fun thing for him necessarily.
[time=1548] It wasn't a break away from the office.
[time=1550] That's what he did.
[time=1551] He was at the office.
[time=1552] Nothing hard.
[time=1553] He was engrossed in his fishing.
[time=1554] He looks up and there is Christ.
[time=1559] Christ says, "Follow me and I will make you become fishers of men."
[time=1565] And instantly Peter is at a crossroads.
[time=1568] Peter is at the most important crossroad of his life.
[time=1572] Peter is now forced to make a decision to leave his way of life, his way of thinking,
[time=1578] the things that consumed him from the earliest days of his memory and begin to follow now
[time=1585] the person of Christ.
[time=1586] And this morning I just want to talk about that one sentence, "Follow me and I will make you become fishers of men." I'd like to break it into three parts.
[time=1594] The first is, "Follow me." I find it to be an amazing beginning.
[time=1600] Jesus, as you know, I mean in soliciting Peter, he is doing something that is strategic in the Lord's mind to his life and ministry and to your life and to my life.
[time=1610] He is putting the twelve apostles together and they were the only hope for the cause of Christ after the death, the resurrection and the ascension of Christ.
[time=1618] He didn't start an organization, he didn't write any books, he just called these twelve guys together.
[time=1623] Now this is a big event in the life of Christ.
[time=1625] Christ prayed over this encounter.
[time=1627] Christ sought the Father's will as to who he should bring into his apostleship.
[time=1633] What I find so amazing about this beginning is that all Christ did was say, "Follow me."
[time=1640] He did not say, "Here's a statement of faith.
[time=1643] Read this carefully.
[time=1644] I'll test you on it if you pass the test cognitively and if you believe everything in my statement
[time=1650] of faith, you can be one of my apostles." He didn't say, "Here is my well-defined religious creed.
[time=1657] Read it, understand it, ascribe to it and I will let you in." He didn't say, "Here's my organization that I started.
[time=1664] These are my organizational goals.
[time=1665] Here's my charter statement.
[time=1667] Here's my vision.
[time=1668] Here are the core principles of my organization.
[time=1670] Understand all about this.
[time=1671] Be totally convinced in the power and the processes of my organization.
[time=1676] You can be in." He didn't say that.
[time=1679] Furthermore, he did not say, "Here is a behavioral code.
[time=1681] You want to be one of mine.
[time=1682] You want to be in my group.
[time=1683] You want to walk with me.
[time=1684] Here's the twenty-seven thousand things.
[time=1686] You got to stop doing that violate behavioral code." And here are the twenty-seven thousand things you got to start doing.
[time=1693] Read all this stuff, agree to all this stuff, commit yourself to all this stuff and you're in." He didn't say that stuff.
[time=1701] He just said two words, follow me.
[time=1707] You see, Jesus called Peter to himself.
[time=1711] Jesus said, "I want you to follow me." Peter already had a synagogue.
[time=1717] He already had a place of worship.
[time=1719] He already had some holy scriptures in the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Bible.
[time=1723] He already had a way of being religious.
[time=1726] In fact, he was so religious that it was pervasive in everything he did.
[time=1731] What he ate was determined by his religion.
[time=1738] What he thought was determined by his social calendar was determined by his religion.
[time=1744] His political views were determined by everything about this man was already being determined by his religious views.
[time=1750] I find it very interesting that Jesus did not say, "Peter, trade in your religion or my religion." He said, "Trade in your religion for me." Follow me.
[time=1762] He invited Peter to a personal relationship to follow him as a human being, as God incarnate.
[time=1770] He did not invite Peter to a religious system, a statement of faith, a defined creed, an
[time=1776] organization or some behavioral code.
[time=1779] He said, "Peter, follow me." And then over time, of course, Peter dropped his nets and followed Christ.
[time=1790] But over time, Christ began to define the extent of what it meant to follow Christ.
[time=1799] Jesus began to clarify what it means to follow him.
[time=1803] He said in Luke 16, in a clarifying moment.
[time=1806] This is what I meant, Peter.
[time=1807] When I said, "Follow me," it means this, "No man can serve two masters." For either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold the one and despise the other.
[time=1816] You cannot serve God and Mammon.
[time=1818] And Mammon stands as money as an emblem of anything that would divide a heart.
[time=1822] It doesn't have to be money.
[time=1824] It could be pleasure.
[time=1825] It could be family.
[time=1826] It could be a wife.
[time=1827] It could be a husband.
[time=1828] It could be children.
[time=1829] It could be a job.
[time=1830] It could be a location.
[time=1831] It could be anything.
[time=1832] What Jesus is saying is, "Peter, I am inviting you to follow me exclusively.
[time=1837] I must have all of your heart.
[time=1841] You cannot share your heart with anyone but me if you're going to follow me."
[time=1847] There's an exclusivity involved in your decision to come after me.
[time=1851] I demand all of you.
[time=1855] On another occasion, defining what he meant by what it would mean to follow him, Mark 10,
[time=1862] he says, "But it is not so among you.
[time=1865] Whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant and whoever wishes to be first among you shall be slave of all." And Jesus is here contrasting the way that Gentile leadership works and the way that the leadership inside of Christendom is going to work.
[time=1878] And he is inviting Peter to shed all of his notions about greatness in terms of having
[time=1884] the place of priority, being the privileged one, being the honored one.
[time=1888] And Jesus says, "You've got to throw away the entire world system of how you impact people.
[time=1893] And if you're going to lead people with me, you've got to lead from the bottom up and you've got to become a servant.
[time=1897] You've got to become the slave of all." And he means to say this, "Peter, you will not only follow me exclusively but you must follow me sacrificially.
[time=1905] You must give up things that you think are dear to you, things that the world offers you in order to follow me in a sacrificial way." That's how it works when you follow me.
[time=1915] Of course, the following verse says, "For even the Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve and to give himself a ransom for many." In another clarifying moment, Jesus says to Peter, "Peter, he summons all of his disciples
[time=1931] to get it.
[time=1932] He says this, "If anyone wishes to come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me, for whoever wishes to save his life shall lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel shall save it." What is he saying?
[time=1945] He is saying, "I not only want you to serve me exclusively and sacrificially in some of the categories of your life, I want every single category of your life committed to me.
[time=1956] In fact, I want your entire understanding of what it means to be alive, to be subordinated, to giving your life to me.
[time=1963] Whoever wishes to save his life, you're going to lose it.
[time=1965] But if you lose your life for me, for my sake and the gospel's sake, you'll have a life.
[time=1973] Follow me exclusively.
[time=1975] Follow me sacrificially and follow me completely.
[time=1979] Every single dimension of your life." Well needless to say, as Jesus was clarifying what it meant to follow him, and by the way, the multitudes were following him.
[time=1988] Everywhere he went, now he'd do another miracle, or almost everywhere he went, and there was no entertainment, there were no special effects, there were no super hot sound systems.
[time=1995] I mean, can you imagine in a culture that is totally divorced of some of the wowing sensations that you and I experience to come across a man who could break the laws of nature
[time=2006] at will?
[time=2007] Do you know how awe-inspiring that would have been?
[time=2008] Do you know what an addictive thing that could be for the multitudes?
[time=2011] I mean, if you think you're in a hurry to go see the latest movie, or to go watch some great basketball player, play basketball, or to see some sensational event, imagine the intensity, and the energy, and the desire to get in proximity to Jesus as he is actually doing a miracle in your presence.
[time=2028] Hards of people followed him.
[time=2031] Some of them followed him, apparently casually and from a distance, but others wanted to make a claim of discipleship to him.
[time=2037] Others getting swept up in the aura of the awesome experience of being in the presence of Christ as he would teach, or as he would heal someone, or raise someone from the dead, or give someone back their sight, they would want to claim allegiance.
[time=2049] I'm with him.
[time=2050] I'm a part of him.
[time=2051] We're together.
[time=2052] I'm on his team.
[time=2053] And the fact is, as Jesus would work through these clarifying exercises of what it means to follow me exclusively and sacrificially and completely, it says in John 66 as a result
[time=2063] of this, 666, as a result of this many of his disciples withdrew and were not walking
[time=2069] with him anymore.
[time=2072] It was intentionally clarifying the reality of what it meant to follow him so that the masses of people who were calling themselves disciples would understand that they were not his disciples.
[time=2081] They would say the anti is too high.
[time=2083] I can't give like that.
[time=2086] And so they withdrew and they would walk with him no more.
[time=2089] You know what I love about this.
[time=2091] You know, Peter made a lot of big mistakes, right?
[time=2094] Now oftentimes the church has a lot of fun with Peter's attitude, and he always put his
[time=2100] mouth and on the darker side, you know, the denial of Christ and the failure that he had there.
[time=2106] Later in the book of Galatians, he gets rebuked by Paul.
[time=2109] But I love this about Peter.
[time=2113] Jesus therefore said to the twelve right on the heels of the statement that everybody was withdrawing and not walking anymore.
[time=2117] Jesus looks at the twelve and he says, "Now, do you want to go away also?"
[time=2123] See everybody walking off on the distance there?
[time=2126] There's the door.
[time=2127] Is that what you want to do?
[time=2129] You find something in your heart saying, "Ah, I wish I was with those guys, leaving this radical, fanatical commitment to Christ." Simon Peter had answered him and said, "Lord, to whom shall we go?
[time=2141] Because you have the words of life and we have believed and have come to know that you are the Holy One of God." What I love about this is Peter doesn't say, "Okay, to which other religious system were we going to go?
[time=2154] Which other theology were we going to ascribe to?
[time=2156] Which other creed were we going to follow?
[time=2158] Which other organization were we going to jump in with?" Peter got the message, "When Jesus said, 'Follow me, he meant it.' So at the moment of Christ there's Peter answers and said, "Lord, to whom?
[time=2169] Who else am I going to follow if I don't follow you?" Peter was actually at that moment in time at the epicenter of what it means to love God
[time=2180] and to be a Christian and to walk in fellowship with God.
[time=2183] He was personally following the person of Christ.
[time=2187] It wasn't creed and it wasn't doctrine and it wasn't ritual and it wasn't the externals.
[time=2191] It was a deep, inner thing going on between Jesus and Peter.
[time=2200] As best as we can understand, while he stumbled from point to point, you will remember that he stayed on course following Christ.
[time=2209] He was so following Christ that at times when they were on the stormy sea and Christ would walk out there and they would finally recognize that it was Jesus walking on the water.
[time=2218] Peter, man, he's out of the boat, he's in the water, he's either walking on water in one place, he just throws himself into the water, whatever it takes to be in proximity to Christ.
[time=2227] He didn't stand back and intellectually wait to hear more theology or learn more about a kingdom program or learn more about a creed or learn more intellectual stuff.
[time=2236] I mean, he just wanted to be with Christ, he loved Christ, he loved Christ.
[time=2244] And somehow he was able to hang on to this notion that it wasn't religion and it wasn't externals.
[time=2249] It was very, very personal.
[time=2253] Now this next part of the phrase, follow me and then he says this, I will make you become.
[time=2260] Now when I read that and of course I had heard this a hundred times, if you've been in the church, you've heard this a hundred times, you've seen the Sunday school lessons and you've sung the songs and you've cast, you know, for fish and brought in men and we've all done that stuff.
[time=2273] And so familiarity tends to breed indifference but for some reason this week, the little word become.
[time=2278] I will make you become.
[time=2279] And I kind of looked again at the text, I looked in the Greek.
[time=2282] What is this about?
[time=2283] Why did the word become?
[time=2284] Why didn't he just say and I will make you fishers of men?
[time=2289] Why did he say I will make you become fishers of men?
[time=2296] And I love this.
[time=2299] I believe it's because what Christ is promising here is far more than just a change in vocation.
[time=2305] He's saying I'm not just going to release you now from fishing for fish to doing something different by way of vocation.
[time=2310] Now you can do this over here called fishing for men.
[time=2315] You follow me, I will make you become something different than you are right now.
[time=2321] I will change you from the inside out.
[time=2325] I will so profoundly affect you and your life that you will become something radically different
[time=2331] than you are and as a result of that radical internal difference you will end up doing something different but that my friend will be a secondary consequence to the first and primary cause which will be I am going to change you at the core of who you are.
[time=2345] Don't you long for that?
[time=2346] I mean isn't that what you want?
[time=2348] I mean isn't that really what you want from Christ?
[time=2352] Do you want him simply to put band-aids on the behavior of your life or are you dying for him to take a hold of you and shape you and mold you and make you something profoundly different than the day he met you?
[time=2365] There's the promise.
[time=2367] If you follow me I will make you become something different than what you are.
[time=2376] He is saying to Peter, Peter I have the power to change who you are, not just what you do
[time=2383] but what you think and how you feel and what you long for and what you value.
[time=2388] I can change all that stuff on the inside first and then as a result you'll find yourself
[time=2394] doing different activities.
[time=2399] Whitney and I just got back from California, Whitney is my 7-year-old daughter.
[time=2402] I think I mentioned her to you the other day and I take a different daughter every year and this daughter I got this year, a different child every year and the child I took this
[time=2411] year was Whitney, 7 years old.
[time=2412] We get back.
[time=2413] I don't know if everybody was in our house but they weren't around it so it's just me and Whitney and this is a couple days after we get back and we're just sitting on the couch and we're all alone in the den and she's kind of for Lauren kind of downcast and she kind of looks like I'm feeling that so I said what are you feeling?
[time=2426] She says well I want to go back to California and she got me thinking about me and that's
[time=2435] what I was thinking because you know it's la la land when you're on vacation, right?
[time=2439] You go where you want to go, you eat what you want to eat, you do what you want to do and it's just one long list of wonderful things that are next to do until time's up and you come home and then there's that readjustment period where you've got to assume the responsibilities of life again and I thought I was the only guy feeling it.
[time=2451] So here's little Whitney, back with her sisters, back in the house, back with her chores, back with her routines, back with all the stuff.
[time=2456] She says man I just wish that you know we were back in California again.
[time=2461] So I grab her and we start talking about that and pretty soon I'm trying to move this thing into a little more positive arena and I say to her I say now just tell me who loves you
[time=2471] more than anybody in the world and as you know I do this often but this one turned out differently and she says well my sisters and I said no it's not right and so I tickled
[time=2480] her and ripped on her hair and poked her in the neck and grabbed her knee and finally she eeks out what she knows I got to hear, oh daddy you do but go through that and then
[time=2489] I say now who do you love more than anybody in the world and she goes back to her sisters and then I fight her again and then she goes to her mother and then I fight her again and finally she says me and I kind of think we're done.
[time=2501] I love you more than anybody in the world she says, okay and I'm kind of watching TV she backs off just a little bit she's butt and I look at her but I don't love you as much
[time=2512] as I love Jesus and I'm thinking of my head you know good but I look at her kind of like
[time=2520] why and she just goes now I didn't make this up okay to fit my message this is true.
[time=2525] She looks at me she says he's got powers.
[time=2532] I promise you that's exactly what she said, he's got powers i.e you don't have those powers
[time=2538] he has powers you don't have and I thought to myself man that is exactly that is exactly
[time=2546] what Jesus was saying to Peter I've got powers and I can make you from the inside out to think
[time=2556] and to feel and to react and to desire and to long and to value for things that are radically
[time=2562] different than what you've got up this morning thinking you were going to be about.
[time=2567] You make the decision Peter to follow me and I will change you forever from the inside out you say how did Christ do that well I don't have time this morning to go through it all but I got to throw a couple of them in number one Christ changed and transformed Peter by telling him the truth.
[time=2583] Jesus was forever teaching his disciples and particularly Peter remember Matthew 18 there's this whole discussion about forgiveness and Peter thinks he's going above and beyond the call duty by saying seven times aren't I a great guy and wouldn't that be magnanimous and Jesus just squares up on him and says no Peter it's 70 times seven which is to say you never stop forgiving people for the wrongs they've done against you and then he jumps into that analogy about how much God has forgiven Peter and if God's forgiven you that much Peter how could you ever fail to forgive another person and Peter consistently throughout his time with Christ opened his mind to the truth of God and allowed the truth of God to change the way he thought he said this is how I think but this is how God thinks I choose what God thinks I choose God's values I choose God's truth over and over and over and over again
[time=2630] Christ taught Peter the truth.
[time=2635] Christ also gave Peter transparency Christ invited Christ orchestrated Christ manipulated
[time=2642] the situations so that Peter could have an open honest transparent relationship with God
[time=2649] Christ refused to have Peter thinking one thing in his heart but saying something different to please Christ with his mouth and so he would over and over put Peter's in position where Peter would eventually say what was really in his heart even though what was in his heart was wrong.
[time=2666] Remember the conversation that he had with the disciples who would have been to say that I am and they say well some say your Elijah some say your Jeremiah some say you're one of the great prophets and but that's not where the Lord wanted to go the Lord wanted to go right down to the core of what those guys believed and so then he said and who do you say that I am he knew where he was going from the beginning of this conversation what the Lord wanted to do was give his men a chance to surface and particularly Peter a chance to surface what was really in their heart and sometimes what came out of Peter's mouth was diametrically opposed remember the time he rebuked the Lord Lord said I'm gonna go die on the cross he said no you're not I mean that is just like way offline with kingdom program stuff and this particular case of course came the great confession of faith thou out you know the Christ is some of the living God upon this church or upon this rock I will build my church.
[time=2715] He gave Peter hope remember the amount of transfiguration Matthew 17 somehow someway the living
[time=2721] God in the form of human flesh who veiled the Shekinah glory of his presence to all of humanity by his flesh took Peter and some of the boys up on top of the amount of trans figuration and we don't know how he did it and the Bible isn't very specific but it does say that his face began to shine in other words Christ pulled back somehow the veil of his humanness and what began to emit from his person was the representation of the glory of God and Peter fell in love with it and said let's stay right here for the rest of our lives and you and I know as we study the New Testament and find out from the book of Revelation that that in fact will be the essence of heaven the thing that is going to thrill us above anything else in heaven is that God's Shekinah glory his illuminating presence will fill us and thrill us to the core of our being.
[time=2764] He gave that to Peter early in their experiences together and as we study through the book of 1 Peter you'll find out why because Peter need to learn about hope that a better day is coming and that better day is found in heaven and it transformed Peter's life.
[time=2779] God transformed Peter by giving him purpose, by giving him purpose, he didn't just say follow me and I will make you become something for yourself, follow me and I will make you a fisher of men, I will let you participate in some way with the advancing of the kingdom
[time=2794] of God, it changed Peter's life.
[time=2796] No longer now was he sitting there fishing to make money to eat so he could go back and fish to make money to eat so he could go back to fish to make money to eat, Peter suddenly was a part of moving the kingdom of heaven on earth and then of course Christ absolutely
[time=2812] transformed Peter's life today for gave him for denying.
[time=2815] Remember the Lord's Supper there and Peter made some pretty bold claims about his loyalty to Christ then he would never deny Christ, he'd rather die than deny Christ and then within hours there they are in the courtyard where Christ is being tried and there's an unnamed slave girl I mean they don't even dignify her by her name, she says aren't
[time=2836] you with Christ and you know what happened, you've got a dialect that sounds like you're from the area that Christ is from, aren't you the one that I saw with Christ?
[time=2847] No, I'm not with Christ, no then he said no I promise I'm not with Christ and then the
[time=2853] third time you swore and promised, when you want to talk about the low point in Peter's
[time=2859] life, from what the Lord do that he say hey you know three and a half years I work with you three and a half years I give my life to you three and a half years I let you see all my miracles three and a half years I teach you everything I know three and a half years and we come to one crisis point and you deny me in front of an unnamed slave girl, now
[time=2877] he makes breakfast, invites Peter in there, in front of everybody else again value clarification change from the inside out let's be honest to you guys let's be transparent we're not gonna do this behind closed doors hey Peter I got a question do you love me and that wonderful
[time=2892] he goes right back to the first two words he said to Peter follow me do you love me remember
[time=2898] Peter this is not about a code this is not about religion this is not about externals this is supposed to be something very intimate and very wonderful between you and me do you love me oh you do well let's get back at work let's get back to the thing we're doing
[time=2915] and then of course after the ascension of Christ the transforming power of God came upon Peter as he was indualled by the Holy Spirit and you and I as members of the New Covenant share that same incredible awesome reality that the Holy Spirit when we come to Christ comes into our heart and guides us and leads us and teaches us and convicts us and produces his fruit and it is that power that transforms us that resident power of Christ and the form of the Holy Spirit many says fishers of men right follow me I will make
[time=2946] you become third thing fishers of men you follow me I will change you now here's the point
[time=2955] my friends it is true that Peter became an apostle and it is true that Peter became a
[time=2961] missionary but you got to go unnoticed today that for most of you here today God has absolutely no intention of rerouting your life to become a missionary you are likely exactly where you are and you are exactly where you ought to be God has led you to your vocation you
[time=2975] love it and you're good at it and you're feeling the pleasure of God's hand on your life as you do what you do you're a builder you love to build you're a businessman you love to do business you're a teacher you love to teach you're a homemaker you love to do homemaking I mean that's you're there because that's where God led you God is not trying to lead you out of that industry what he is trying to lead you into are the lives of the
[time=2996] people that you interact with in that vocation the great truth in the end of this sentence
[time=3002] is this if you follow me I will change you to the degree that you care more about people
[time=3008] than anything else in the world you'll care so much about people that you become a fisher of people no matter where you are primarily in your sphere of influence I will make you
[time=3020] become a person who values the eternal truth over temporal circumstances you begin to see
[time=3026] with eternal goggles and instead of seeing a person lost and without Christ having a miserable day you will see a person without Christ lost having a miserable eternity you'll look past
[time=3037] the physical visible temporal realities of life he will so change you and so make you
[time=3043] become another kind of person that the internal the eternal and the invisible seem to be all you can really see and you'll find in your heart and your life a passion for people
[time=3054] that you thought was beyond your ability to attain because it was it's Christ created and Christ generated you say that happened to Peter you better did after Jesus ascended
[time=3069] and Peter received the Holy Spirit there was this thing you know while Peter was receiving the Holy Spirit there's a thing called day of Pentecost everybody every Jew and their sister have come to Jerusalem I mean everybody's there and it says in chapter two verse fourteen
[time=3082] of Acts it says but Peter taking his stand with the eleven isn't that wonderful to hear no more renouncing Christ no more denying his relationship with Christ no more swearing and promising and cussing that he never knew Christ instead in the public view now not in front of an unnamed slave girl but in front of the whole watching Jewish world he takes his stand with the eleven he raises his voice and he declares to them men of Judea and all
[time=3107] of you who live in Jerusalem let it be known to you and give heed to my words the sermon is way too long and way too wonderful to read this morning but let me tell you he says this this man Jesus Christ a little excerpt from the sermon delivered up by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God you nailed to a cross by the hands of godless men and put him to death he wraps up by saying repent and let each of you be baptized in the name
[time=3133] of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins and he says you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit what he is saying is fall in love with the same Christ that captured my heart
[time=3144] he didn't say repent and be baptized in the name of the Baptist church or the Presbyterian
[time=3150] church or the this church or the this organization get in the name of Jesus Christ give your life
[time=3156] personally to him the forgiveness of your sins and then he'll give you the Holy Spirit and transform your life the same way he is mine at the end of the sermon it says this so then those who had received his words were baptized and they were added that day about three thousand souls now again my friends I'm not telling you that you need to so fall in love with Christ that he'll
[time=3176] make you become a preacher who wins three thousand souls to Christ in one outing I don't ever expect that to happen in my life I wonder if three thousand souls will ever come to Christ through all the preaching of all my sermons of all my life and you know what it doesn't really matter to me doesn't really matter to me what matters is that Christ is deepening my love for people
[time=3196] starting to help me value the eternal things and people's eternal destiny more than the temporal the invisible rather than the visible what he happens to do with those results are entirely up to him again on this theme of him denying Christ in front of this little unnamed
[time=3214] slave girl as acts develops and as the New Testament church makes its shattering impact upon the
[time=3220] ancient world there was all kinds of persecution that arose and they were throwing people in prison not the least of which was Peter and now he stands before a magistrate now he stands before someone who could take his life and he they threatened him and say you had better never preached Christ again enough of this Christ stuff Peter and John answered and said to them well whether it is right
[time=3241] in the sight of God to give heed to you rather than to God you'll have to be the judge on that one but you can take this one of the bank we cannot stop speaking what we have seen and heard
[time=3252] you know what I love about this there's no legalism there he is not saying listen I've been
[time=3259] commissioned as an apostle and so I have to preach even if it kills me you understand I joined up
[time=3265] with Christ and when I joined up with Christ I said I do certain things and this is one of the things so I don't care what you do I'm going to be faithful to my commitment what are you saying is this I can't stop speaking it's too late Christ has changed me so completely I have so become
[time=3280] another person that I can't stop do you hear the freedom in those words do you hear the transformation
[time=3287] ringing out of his lips as he says that I think with great joy and a great sense of self-awareness you know threaten me all you want it's too late for me he's changed me too
[time=3299] completely he's changed me too profoundly I simply can't stop talking don't you long for that don't you long for those kinds of changes in your life that are so deep
[time=3313] and so profound that even the worst and most adverse of circumstances can't seem to reverse it because it's no longer a commitment that you're trying to keep it's who you are that's the promise of Christ and then one last thing as we close I wish I could really develop
[time=3328] this for you but you realize of course that Peter being born bred raised indoctrinated a Jew
[time=3336] picked up with him all the intended prejudices of Judaism and they considered Gentiles as dogs
[time=3343] second-class citizens unworthy of the love of God and certainly never able to have direct access
[time=3350] to the presence of God if a Gentile was ever going to get to God it was going to come through the purifying impact of the Jews of the nation of Israel I mean he was a full fledged bona fide flaming bigot when it came to the Gentiles he despised the second-class Gentile
[time=3369] and wouldn't you know it in the process of Christ and letting Peter become something entirely
[time=3375] different Christ said to Peter okay Peter assignment number two now instead of preaching to the Gentile into the very house of a Gentile named Cornelius and I want you to tell him how without
[time=3389] your help without the nation of Israel without the holy priesthood Israel I want you to tell him how without Israel he can come directly into the same love relationship as you have with me
[time=3399] and Peter put his heels in and drug his feet and it took a vision and he finally even got into
[time=3406] the house of Cornelius and as the first thing he says out of his lips in the front of in front of Cornelius and all these guests these Gentile guests that Cornelius invited who he wanted to come to Christ Peter says this you yourselves know how unlawful it is for a man who was a Jew to associate with a foreigner a visit with him and yet God has shown me that I should not call any man unholy or
[time=3424] unclean I don't call that a very good introductory remark to a bunch of you know okay I think of you as unclean unholy but I but God said not to that's basically what he said you know what he did
[time=3435] he told him how to come to Christ he told him how to repent of their sins he told them how Christ
[time=3442] had died for them and they accepted Christ they came to Christ they were baptized in the name of
[time=3449] Jesus Christ it says in Acts 1048 and then they asked him to stay for a few days they must have had fellowship you want to talk about a total transformation of an individual he became something
[time=3460] completely and totally different we don't know how he died for sure because the Bible doesn't tell us but what we do know from history which can't be trusted like the word of God is that he was
[time=3471] allegedly crucified martyred for his continuance to proclaim Christ when they crucified him history says that he refused or asked rather not to be crucified upright but to be turned upside down so there would be no similarity there with the preciousness of his own lord's crucifixion didn't want to mock that or even approximate that in any way please kill me but that's fine but upside down not like my lord and the weeks to come we're going to have the privilege of studying this man's writing the things that he learned he lived in a very very difficult and tumultuous time into the reign of Nero he's going to teach us a lot about suffering and in the midst of learning about suffering he's going to teach us about how to hang on to the things that are truly important in life and they're all going to come back to this passionate compelling wonderful love for people
