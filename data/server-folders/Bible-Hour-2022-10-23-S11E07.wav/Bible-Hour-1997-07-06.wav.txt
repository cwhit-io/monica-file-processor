[time=30] They reached a place of absolute hopelessness. Webster defines hopeless as no expectation
[time=50] of good or success. The persecution was so fierce and so legal and so regular and so
[time=59] universal that there was no place to escape it and they came to the place that they had no expectation of good or success. Their life had utterly fallen apart and there was no
[time=69] hope that it would ever recover.
[time=79] This is the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church. Thank you for joining us. Last week in our introduction of a book of First Peter, we discussed the author and the times he lived in. Today in A Living Hope, Pastor Moore begins his study of the book with a look at verses 1-12. We hope you'll stay tuned. Now let's join our service.
[time=118] [MUSIC]
[time=148] This is my prayer. When the race is finally run, I want to hear well done from the audience
[time=160] of one. When the drive for recognition starts to give the rest of me, all I gotta do is
[time=177] look around and the people serving selflessly and they don't serve for glory and they're
[time=186] not keeping score. There's a sign that's written on their voice, a sign I've seen before.
[time=198] I'll be content to serve an audience of one. Only his approval counts, but all is said
[time=212] and done. And this is my prayer. When the race is finally run, I want to hear well done
[time=223] from the audience of one. In the not too distant future, when the crowds all fade away, I'll
[time=236] stand alone before my lord. And this is what I long to say. I'm honored to serve an audience
[time=248] of one. It's what I've been created for every since day one. So this is my song, as I bow
[time=262] before your thought. I love to hear well done from the audience of one. So this will be
[time=276] my prayer until the race is finally run. I want to hear well done. I love to hear well
[time=288] done. I want to hear well done from the audience of one.
[time=328] These are the places I was so sure I'd find
[time=356] this. I've looked in the pages and I've looked down on my knees. I've lifted my eyes in expectation
[time=373] to see the sun still refusing to shine. But sometimes he comes in the clouds. Sometimes
[time=383] his face cannot be found. Sometimes the sky is dark and grey and some things can only
[time=394] be known. Sometimes our faith can only grow when we can't see. So sometimes he comes in
[time=412] the clouds. Sometimes I see me sail around on the ocean. So brave and so sure even when
[time=434] skies are clear. But when the clouds start together, I watch my faith turn to fear.
[time=449] But sometimes he comes in the clouds. Sometimes his face cannot be found. Sometimes the sky
[time=460] is dark and grey. Some things can only be known. Sometimes our faith can only grow when we
[time=476] can't see. So sometimes he comes in the rain and we question the blame and we wonder why
[time=493] God can see so far away. Time will show us. He's been right there with us and sometimes
[time=507] he comes in the clouds. Sometimes his face cannot be found. Sometimes he comes away.
[time=521] Things can only be known. Sometimes our faith can only grow when we can't see. So sometimes
[time=537] he comes in the clouds. Here comes in the clouds.
[time=567] Amen. Looking forward to it. Thank you, Kevin. Let me invite you to open your Bible this morning
[time=574] to 1 Peter chapter 1. If you were with us last week, you know we began a study of the book of 1 Peter. What that means is we're going to make our way through this wonderful epistle kind of verse by verse, passage by passage, chapter by chapter until we've finished
[time=590] the book. In last Sunday we kind of did an introduction to the author himself, Peter.
[time=597] And this morning we get to jump in to the first nine verses and try to understand the message that is there for us. July 19th, couple days from now, July 19th, but 64 AD, that's next
[time=611] week 1,933 years ago, Rome went up in flames. Rome was a very densely populated city and
[time=620] the streets were very, very narrow and people lived in high wooden tenements. And once the
[time=626] fire started, it went for three days and three nights and turned the entire city into a raging inferno. Valiant efforts were made to check the fire and it was successful at first, but
[time=638] it broke out all over again, got completely out of control and almost the entire city went up in flames. The losses were enormous. People in Rome lost their family and their
[time=649] friends. They lost their homes. They lost much of the architectural, cultural statement
[time=655] that Rome had once made for them. Their places of worship were consumed in fire and their
[time=661] idols were consumed and in that they lost their gods. They lost almost everything. It
[time=668] left the people feeling devastated and shocked and particularly angry. There was a rumor
[time=674] on the streets that Nero had set the fire, found a front row seat and enjoyed watching
[time=680] it to his great delight. As more and more of the populace of Rome discovered what Nero had done, Nero found the urgent need to redirect their hostility away from himself. Somebody
[time=691] was going to get slaughtered in this process. The people were very, very angry and very upset.
[time=698] In his effort to redirect the hostility, he needed a scapegoat. He needed someone else to blame for this other than himself and he picked the Christians. It was a good pick
[time=708] and it worked. It worked for a lot of different reasons. The Christians were already looked at with a jaundice eye because of their association with Jews and there was a high anti-Semitism
[time=719] sentiment in the hearts of people of Rome. It worked because Christians refused emperor worship and categorically rejected the Roman gods. It worked because many of the Roman
[time=730] prominent leaders had wives who had converted to Christianity and it infuriated them. This
[time=737] act of independence on the part of a woman and a wife was more than they could conceive.
[time=743] It worked because Christians were always saying that the world was going to end in some kind of an inferno, that this present day would burn up at the end of the age. The effort
[time=755] worked and it worked brilliantly. All of the anger and all of the hatred that sits just
[time=761] below the surface in any given culture or community, particularly at Rome, became inflamed and focused and directed at Christians. They were imprisoned without trial. They were lynched.
[time=773] They were racked. They were seared. They were broiled. They were burned. They were stoned.
[time=779] They were hanged. They were lacerated with white hot knives. They were thrown out of the horns of wild animals. Rome went into a blood craze frenzy and all of the very most
[time=789] savage and base and shocking and repulsive imaginations that could possibly be held in
[time=795] the human heart. Now we're legal. And they were not only legal, they turned into sport.
[time=799] It was not only sport, it turned into entertainment. They can hardly wait to re-broadcast the Tyson
[time=807] fight. They're anticipating it to be the most viewed fight in boxing history. Certainly
[time=815] not because it was one of the greatest fights in all of boxing history, but because the animal savagery of one man biting another man has got our culture in a very curious state. Imagine
[time=828] what it must have been like when they loaded the Colosseum to a packed capacity crowd standing room only and brought in living, breathing human beings and set them out in the middle of the Colosseum and then released the wild animals to tear them and dismember them and
[time=844] devour them and ravage their bodies. It was a frenzy. Nero is said to have rolled Christians
[time=853] in tar, stuck them on posts, and lit them on fire using them as tiki torches for his
[time=859] palace parties. Persecution was wholesale and it was, listen to this, universal. It
[time=866] was universal. Unlike the Holocaust in Germany, which was limited to a very confined geographical
[time=873] area, this Holocaust went as far as the Roman Empire, which was the world. It was a worldwide
[time=881] legalized wholesale, universal persecution of Christians and they had no rights. They had no protection. They had no recourse. They had no security. They had no one they could trust and worst of all, there was nowhere to run. It went through all of Rome, Asia
[time=897] Minor, Pontius, Galatia, Asia, Bithynia. So they had to find someplace to hide and so
[time=903] they found refuge in the catacombs beneath the city of Rome. That's a glorified term for tombs. There were miles and miles and miles of caves underneath Rome where they
[time=914] buried their entombed and the Christians seeking refuge found only there to live sometimes
[time=920] for years among the decaying dead. Those who did not run to the catacombs ran out of the
[time=927] city and into the wilderness. But as far as they ran, they ran into further levels of persecution because the frenzy spread throughout the entire Roman Empire. And as they ran,
[time=938] they lost everything they had. They lost their jobs. They lost their businesses. They lost their livestock. They lost their homes. They lost their life savings. And there was no relief
[time=949] and no refuge and no place to go. It's called being hopeless. They were hopeless. There
[time=959] was not a flicker of hope in their hearts when Peter wrote this book that their life
[time=965] would ever return to normal. Webster defines hopeless, no expectation of good or success.
[time=976] Hope is about the future. Hope involves an expectation that somehow, some way tomorrow will be better than today. And these people were living hell and they had no reasonable
[time=989] reason to expect it would ever be different and they were right. Their life had fallen
[time=995] apart and they had no hope for recovery. And here's what's so interesting. All of that
[time=1003] was true because of one thing. All of that hopelessness, all the reality of that persecution
[time=1009] was true because of one very simple thing, a choice that they had made to accept Christ.
[time=1019] If they hadn't accepted Christ, none of this would happen to them. You see when an earthquake
[time=1026] strikes, it pretty much gets everybody. And so everybody's got problems. When a volcano erupts, it affects everybody. When a tornado hits, it affects everybody. When an invasion from an enemy army affects comes, it affects everybody. But in this case, it was specified and specific and classified only to those whose faith was in Christ. You see these persecuted
[time=1047] believers losing their lives and losing their families and losing their lives all that they had known prior to this great persecution. They still had unsaved friends whose lives were remaining relatively untouched. I mean, some of them went through the hardship of the fire of Rome, but they were back on the mend and their life was getting back in order.
[time=1064] They had hope. They were going to recover in this day and age. But these believers simply
[time=1071] because of their confessed faith in Christ, that was the single determining factor which put them outside of society. And it is to this hopeless group of people full of confusion
[time=1082] with all of their doubts and all of their questions that Peter begins to write and look at verse 3. He offers them something. To a hopeless people, Peter offers a living hope.
[time=1094] Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy
[time=1100] has caused us to be born again, what? To a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus
[time=1107] Christ from the dead. He is saying, and you'll see in the text later, he is not denying the
[time=1115] hardship and the distress and the enormity of the difficulty and the trial. He is in fact asking them to embrace the difficulty of their life here and now. But he is saying, do not be mistaken my friends. We have a living hope that has come to us through the person of
[time=1131] Jesus Christ and his resurrection from the dead. Now, you and I, we have no knowledge
[time=1140] of this reality. We have no knowledge of persecution. We have no personal, real, genuine, experiential
[time=1147] knowledge of this kind of persecution. Oh, maybe somebody got fired because of their faith in Christ and went down the street and maybe got a better job. My friends, we celebrated the fact this weekend that we live in America and we're the most, I mean, it's hard to find the words, isn't it, to say thank you to God that we got born in America, that our families aren't taken from us, that we get to choose our religion, that we get to come here. I mean, think of the things that God has given us. We don't know anything that you people know about. But in another sense, we do understand hopelessness. And before I explain what I
[time=1184] want to do today is talk about the seven components of a living hope, I want to try to connect with our day and our culture. And I want to remind you that some of us know about hopelessness.
[time=1191] Some of you are hopelessly married to the wrong person. And there is an altogether different
[time=1197] kind, but deeply penetrating persecution that you live with on a daily basis. The longing in your heart that will never be fulfilled to be loved the way you knew you could have been loved. Some of you feel hopeless in a dead end career. And because of financial
[time=1211] obligations and certain other situations and the training that would be needed to make a transition, you know there is no way out and you're going to spend the rest of your life doing a job that you know you were never built to do. Day in and day out. Some of you
[time=1226] know the hopelessness of a bad health condition. And there is never going to be an improvement of your health. It's just going to get worse over time and rapidly at that. Some of you know about the hopeless feeling in your heart with the loss of your soulmate and you connected at the level everybody dreams about and now he or she is gone and you don't see a better alternative. You don't see another alternative, it's just hopeless. But I want to go beyond
[time=1252] those kinds of hopelessness. I want you to know that all hope, now listen to this, all
[time=1259] hope that is not bound up in the resurrection of Jesus Christ is in reality a dying hope.
[time=1264] There are only two kinds of hope. There is living hope and there is dying hope. And if you don't have hope in Christ and the resurrection of Christ, what you have, I don't care how good it is. It is a dying hope. Jacques Cousteau. Didn't you love that guy? Didn't you love
[time=1278] the places he took you? The things he taught you, the things he showed you. Didn't you just love that guy? He lived an amazing life. He had a deep, driving passion in his heart
[time=1289] to explore what was underneath the surface of the sea and then to show everybody he could what he found out. Jacques Cousteau. He invented the aqua lung so he could go down there.
[time=1300] I mean, necessity, the mother of invention, he'd long so deeply to get down there he invented what it took to get down there. He was a former French naval officer and kind of became
[time=1310] the environmentalist emeritus of the world. Jacques could go anywhere and the doors were wide open to him and to his experiments and exploration. He loved the sea. He would fly
[time=1321] all over the world on a supersonic jet, the concord to rendezvous with one or two of his
[time=1327] research vessels, the calypso, of course, being one of those. Once on his research vessel
[time=1333] that was staffed with the best equipment money could buy and the greatest technicians and the experts from around the world, he would embark into his exploration of some dimension
[time=1344] of the underworld, the underwater world. And not only did he get the joy of discovering
[time=1350] he captured it on film, 50 years of films come to us from this incredibly gifted individual
[time=1356] and he had the thrill. You know how excited it is. It's one thing to be excited about discovering something for yourself but the real rush is when you get to show your friends what you discovered. He showed the world what he discovered. But you know what? As
[time=1372] wonderful as it was. It was a dying hope. Newsweek ran the story because, well, the title was
[time=1382] this one fantastic voyage. What is true of a voyage? They always come to an end. Jacques
[time=1392] Cousteau died last month at 87 years of age and as good as he had it and as wonderful
[time=1399] as his life was and as filled with hope and anticipation of the next great event, the next
[time=1405] great discovery, the next great thing that he accomplished and they fell like dominoes in his life. He was on, he was living a thing called a dying hope and now the event is over
[time=1417] and he is dead and soon the memory of Jacques Cousteau will be dead. Oh, he'll live in our
[time=1425] minds but he may not live in the next generation and he certainly won't live in a third. To understand, it's a dying hope. California, last month playing golf, got a little irritated
[time=1439] at the guy in front of me. Old guy, gray hair, hunched shoulders, had his wife driving the
[time=1447] cart, had another cart behind him with his attendant in it. He gets out of his cart and
[time=1453] takes these little itty bitty steps and I'm trying to play golf and he finds, the attendant
[time=1459] is hanging on to his arm. Little itty bitty steps, finally gets out, they give him a club, he punches the ball, pretty good shot, down the fairway, about 50 yards. Hands the club back, does this. You know, I mean hole after hole. Guess who it was? Bob Hope. Bob
[time=1482] Hope, 92 years old, still playing golf, you got to give the guy a hand and I heard the "Oh, how could you be mad at that?" Why? Because you love him, don't you? Well the most
[time=1495] beloved people in our generation, everybody loved Bob. Everybody loved Bob. Bob, Bob knew
[time=1502] something that few people ever got to know, adoration from everybody he met. He was loved,
[time=1509] he was enjoyed, he was appreciated and that by the way was far more significant to him than he happened to have been famous, successful and wealthy. Almost all over the world this man could go. He immediately recognized, doors flew open. He had direct access to all
[time=1526] the presidents and all the leaders of the most, you know, of the world. I mean he was just an amazing man, far beyond a comedian. He was a world leader and guess what? It's
[time=1538] almost over. I mean you got to plot a guy for being 92 and playing golf but you also got to face, I mean the thing that ran through my mind is he had it all. He had it all. He had everything anybody could ever want but look at him. He's hobbling to the ball and
[time=1554] when I come play this course next year he may not be alive. Why? It's a dying hope.
[time=1563] You see that man was filled with one great accomplishment after the next. It was a marvel less life. It was the best that life could give apart from the resurrection of Jesus Christ but it's almost over. Pretty soon, pretty soon the event of his life will be over, he
[time=1580] will be over and soon enough the memory of Bob Hope will be over. They sold all of her
[time=1588] gowns at an auction, not Jackie. Princess die, right? They sold them for a lot of money.
[time=1598] There's a photo that ran this week at Newsweek magazine. Amazing scene. There she is in all of her incredible beauty. There's just something about Princess die. You know when she's standing there in that gorgeous dress and she's dancing, she's getting flung out on the end of this dance routine and guess who's holding her hand? John Travolta, the king of dance. I
[time=1617] mean what a moment. The queen and the king all at the same place, the same time doing the dance and you see in the background of these beautiful marble pillars it's obviously a palace somewhere gorgeous in the world and you're thinking now there's a moment which I could have been there and in the background of the picture the real story is being told
[time=1638] because they're up next to one of these pillars are Ron and Nancy Reagan and they're hanging
[time=1644] on to each other in all the affection that they enjoyed through the years and Nancy's just captivated looking to die as you'd expect and Ronnie's got one of the big Ronnie smiles
[time=1654] going and he's looking over at some friends and they're all just kind of saying it isn't this something isn't this a moment and she's there dancing in the gown that then sold the auction for a quarter of a million bucks. What a moment. Guess what? It's over and it's
[time=1673] not coming back and it kind of stood out in my mind as a pinnacle of like Ronald Reagan
[time=1680] eight years as one of the most popular presidents in the history of the United States of America.
[time=1684] Imagine all the experiences he had, all the places he got to go, all the people he got to see. I mean these kind of moments with Prince's die and John Travolta in the ballroom dance a diamond dozen in his autobiography. You know what? It's over and now he can't
[time=1703] even remember that he was there because of his disease and pretty soon we're going to
[time=1711] hear the terrible news that he's dead and then a generation's going to come pretty soon.
[time=1716] They don't even know who Ronald Reagan was. Do you know the names? Do you know the names
[time=1722] of the great pharaohs of Egypt? No you don't do you but they won't know his name either.
[time=1727] Why? It's a dying hope. It's a dying hope. My friends any hope that is not intrinsically
[time=1738] bound up into the person of Jesus Christ, his death and his resurrection is a dying hope.
[time=1744] I don't care how good it is. So in a sense we're going to speak out of this book about a people who have suffered a level of persecution that you and I likely, likely will never know.
[time=1756] But don't think that the truth of this book is irrelevant to you because you and I are now susceptible apart from persecution to giving our lives to a dying hope. And Peter
[time=1770] says to us, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Let me remind you of what a living hope is.
[time=1776] Live for a living hope. You who have no persecution and you who have freedom to choose, you choose a living hope." Let me explain it to you. Seven components of a living hope. He begins in verse one. It says here, "Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ to those who reside as aliens
[time=1792] scattered throughout Pontius, Galatius, Capidocia, Asia and Bethania." Here it is. Who are chosen.
[time=1798] You see that? The first component of a living hope is the realization that you have been chosen by God to be saved. You did not come to Christ by accident. You were not saved
[time=1809] by happenstance, by chance, by coincidence or probability. You have been saved by the sovereign choice of a sovereign God. It is God who pursued you for salvation. It is
[time=1820] God who convicted you through the ministry of His Holy Spirit so you can see and recognize and repent of your sin. It is God who illumined to you the beauty of the person of Jesus Christ as your Savior. It is God who regenerated you. God chose you. You see in verse two? According
[time=1838] to the choice was, according to the foreknowledge of God, the Father, and some of the worst theology
[time=1844] that has ever been said is the notion that this foreknowledge was God looking down the annals of time, seeing our choice, and because He could see our choice, He chose to choose us. That's not what it means. Foreknowledge, knowledge in the Bible means to love. Adam
[time=1860] knew his wife. It is a love intimacy. God, love intimacy to us beforehand. In other words,
[time=1867] His choice of us was not random. It was not speculative. It was not probability. Even the choice of us was based upon something namely His love for us. He loved us beforehand and
[time=1880] based upon that love beforehand, He sovereignly chose us to be His children. This is so important
[time=1887] because when life is hard, when it's tough times, when life spins out of control and
[time=1896] jobs are lost and businesses go broke and livestock is missing and homes are burned,
[time=1903] it's common to think back through the chain of events that led you to that point in your
[time=1909] life and say, "Man, I wish that sequence of things hadn't occurred." You've got a bad marriage. It's very common for you to sit there and say, "If only I hadn't wanted to become an accountant because if I hadn't wanted to become an accountant, then I wouldn't have chosen that college to go to. And if I hadn't chosen that college, then I never would have met Frank, my husband, and Frank's an idiot. Why did I want to be an accountant?
[time=1932] It led to this in my life, right? You get in a car accident and you're standing on the side of the road and you're looking at your mangled automobile and the steam is flying out of the hood and you say to yourself, "Why did I ever want to go to the fireworks tonight?
[time=1946] Why did I just stay home and watch TV? If I hadn't wanted to go to the fireworks, I wouldn't have been in the firework place and I wouldn't have been on Coliseum Boulevard and I wouldn't have gone through that signal. That idiot who ran the red light wouldn't have hit me.
[time=1957] Why did I want to go to the fireworks tonight?" These people were saying that on a far deeper level. They were saying this, "Why in the world did I ever listen to that guy named
[time=1970] Alexander? Why did I ever accept his invitation to go to that house church there in the city
[time=1978] of Rome and why did I ever listen to the preaching of the gospel of Christ? If only I hadn't
[time=1986] have met Alexander and gone to that person's house and heard that message and I wouldn't be a Christian today and I wouldn't be suffering like I'm suffering." It's exactly what they were saying. Peter says, "No, no, I'll reroll the tape. That's not how it happened, okay?
[time=2000] You did not come to Christ by accident. You did not just happen to meet Alexander. You didn't just happen to go to the house church. I'll tell you, that whole thing was laid out by the sovereign plan of God based upon his incredible love for you. He chose you. He pursued you. He hunted you. He convicted you. He illumined you. He brought you to himself
[time=2018] with irresistible power. Don't ever mitigate your salvation down to the fact that it happened as an accident." Isn't that refreshing? I mean, you know, God can take us some hard
[time=2030] places in life. God can lead us in some directions. We don't want to go. And there
[time=2037] are times when we can find ourselves saying, "Man, I just sometimes wish I hadn't ever.
[time=2043] How did I get caught up?" Boy, that was a mistake. And Peter breaks through and says
[time=2049] it wasn't a mistake. It was a loving sovereign choice. God wanted you. Number two, the second
[time=2058] component of a living hope is found in verse two and it says this, "According to the foreknowledge or chosen according to the foreknowledge or foreloving of God." Now watch, "By the sanctifying
[time=2068] work of the Spirit that you may obey Christ Jesus." The word I want you to see there is sanctifying, sanctifying. And the point I'm trying to make in this is this, God chose
[time=2079] you and eternity passed based upon his love so that you would become a Christian. And what Peter is saying to these people is this, "And God is still choosing you every single day, every single hour, every single minute, every single moment, God is choosing you to sanctify
[time=2094] you. He has not backed up on you. He has not forsaken his promises on you." Isn't that
[time=2100] the second thing we do? We get in a hard situation. We begin to say to ourselves, "God doesn't care about me. God can't be trusted. God must not love me because if he could be trusted and if he did care about me, he wouldn't let this kind of stuff go on in my life. Oh, for a little while I can suffer. But you mean I'm going to lose the rest of my life suffering under the persecution of the Roman Empire? God has forgotten me. God is breaking his promises
[time=2121] to me. God cannot be trusted is what they were saying." When Peter says, "No, wait a
[time=2127] minute. Time out." God never promised you a rose garden, so to speak. God never said that if you come to Christ, its peaches and cream the rest of your life, what God promised was if you come to Christ, he will move heaven and hell and earth along with it to make sure that when it's done, you look exactly like Christ. He will conform you to the image of his son and that's what he's doing in the sanctifying process. He is taking the trial and the heat of the trial to burn the dross off of these people's life and to continue to form them into the image of Christ, verse 2 says, so that they could obey Christ. He
[time=2161] hasn't forgotten them. He hasn't deserted them. He isn't uncaring about their circumstances.
[time=2167] He isn't unmoved emotionally by the loss of their children and their homes and their businesses and their jobs. He cares about every last little bit of it. And he is totally engaged at that very second working his promises out, which was, "I will make you like my son."
[time=2181] And we can use this material to make you like my son as easily as we can use blessings in your life to make you like my son. Number three, third component of a living hope
[time=2194] is the realization that we have in verse 2 been sprinkled with his blood. This is a weird little phrase, isn't it? Can you imagine reading that? Sprinkled with his blood. If you didn't know what that meant, you'd think that somebody took the actual blood of Christ and sprinkled it on your head. And you'd think, "Now that's a weird ceremony." In fact, one of the reasons
[time=2212] that Nero's accusation against the Christian stuck so well was because their communion, the Christian communion was closed. If you weren't a believer, you didn't get to go to communion. And what the outside people heard about communion was the eating and the drinking of the body and the blood of Christ. And there was a rumor, a strong rumor outside of Christianity that the Christians were cannibals. That's not what this means. This
[time=2237] comes out of Exodus chapter 12 verse 13. It's describing the first Passover. You remember what happened? God sent Moses and he said, "Moses, you tell Pharaoh, I want the nation
[time=2248] of Israel to come out of the land of Egypt. Let my people go." And Pharaoh made the stupid mistake over and over and over and over again of not doing what God asked him to do. And so God began to beat. The plague means blow. God began to beat the nation of Egypt until
[time=2264] they finally let his people go. And the last blow was an angel of death that was sent through
[time=2270] all of Egypt and it would pass over each house and it would kill in that house the eldest.
[time=2276] And last, of course, you'd observe the Passover. And that includes the slaying of an innocent
[time=2282] lamb, Amblamish lamb, and the taking of that blood and the sprinkling of the blood along the doorpost. And if you had expressed your faith in God by putting that blood from that specified lamb, everybody had their own lamb, an Amblamish lamb, right there on the doorpost, then when the angel of death moved through the land of Egypt, it would see the sprinkled blood and it would pass over your house and your child would not die. You know, this
[time=2309] is a rich picture, isn't it? He's saying to these believers, he's saying, "You know, you're all getting slaughtered everywhere, aren't you? You're getting slaughtered in so many different ways. You didn't know people get slaughtered in this many ways and in this many numbers. I mean, you're just absolutely getting massacred. But don't forget now.
[time=2326] There's a first death and you guys are tasting that, but there's a second death and the second death is separation from God and heaven. The second death is hell. The second death is a kind of persecution that doesn't come from the hands of men, it comes from the hands of God and it is where the fire never dies and the thirst has never quenched. And let me tell you something, you're never ever, ever, ever, ever going to experience that because
[time=2349] you've been sprinkled by the blood of Christ. It's amazing truth in it. Hopeless people,
[time=2362] their lives are destroyed as they knew them. They have no hope for a change in their future and they were right, their future wasn't going to change, many of them died. And Peter comes
[time=2373] and says, "But wait a minute, you're not hopeless." Number one, I want you to realize that you've been chosen by a sovereign God. He loves you. He saved you. Number two, he is faithful to his promises. He is sanctifying you and transforming you even in the midst of this holocaust. And number three, you've been sprinkled by the blood of Christ, which means you will never, ever, ever, after you physically die, you'll never go to the second death. Number four, this is where it really gets good. I mean, if that isn't good enough,
[time=2406] just hang on to this thing. There's a description in verse four that I can so hardly wait to
[time=2412] feel. I've never felt it in my life, neither have you, but I want to. Look at verse four,
[time=2420] it says, "To obtain an inheritance," that's heaven. "To obtain an inheritance," which is now three words, imperishable, undefiled, and will not fade away. Do you see that? Heaven
[time=2434] is imperishable. It's undefiled and it will not fade away. As a young student of the
[time=2441] Bible, I used to come to this particular text because I knew it was about heaven. And I tried to build messages around this text that I could tell people what heaven was like.
[time=2453] And no matter how hard I studied this verse, I was never able to produce a message which told people what heaven was like because this verse doesn't tell you what heaven is like.
[time=2461] This verse has nothing to say about the streets of gold, about the pearly gates, about the new heaven and the new earth, in descriptive terms. There's nothing here in descriptive terms about the wonder of God's presence, which of course is the essence of heaven being in his immediate presence. There's nothing. You can't learn really anything descriptively about heaven from this verse, but here's what you do get from this verse. This kind of broke on my mind big this week. What this verse says is that heaven will never stop
[time=2488] lasting. Heaven lasts forever. The only thing you learn about heaven from this verse is
[time=2494] that heaven goes on and on and on and on and on forever and ever and ever. It never stops.
[time=2499] The moment never ends. It never dies and its memory will never fade because it will be forever. This verse doesn't tell us what it's like in heaven. It tells us that heaven
[time=2509] will never go away. Imperishable. The word means to be conquered by an enemy army. And
[time=2517] when you have something beautiful and you have something precious and of course think of the land of Palestine that was always being invaded by enemy armies and big chunks of Palestine
[time=2526] were being taken by the Philistines or taken by the Jebusites or taken by whoever they were fighting. And what he is saying is this thing called heaven will never ever come unto the influence of an enemy army. No one will ever take it away. The second word is undefiled and it means unable to be touched by sin. Undefiled means sin and evil and contamination will never
[time=2549] affect heaven which is a huge concept because you and I know that Rome didn't fall at the hands really of an enemy army. Rome fell under the weight of her own corruption, her own sin, her own immorality and my guess is so will America. Who is going to stand up and
[time=2566] take America away from us? By force. I don't know. But there is another war going on and
[time=2574] we are losing it every single day. The weight of our own immorality is becoming very, very heavy and it is not beyond possibility at all for the whole economic political system to just go poof under the weight of our own immorality. This verse says that will never
[time=2590] happen in heaven. Heaven is a perfect place. In fact Revelation 21 says that nothing unclean
[time=2597] and no one who practices abominations shall ever be able to come into heaven. In other words, heaven will not corrupt itself. Nothing will never get inside of heaven that will cause heaven to corrode itself morally so that eventually heaven is no more. So it will never be conquered by an enemy army. It will never be defiled in and of itself and then this third thing unfading, this third word is unfading. It is an inheritance which is imperishable
[time=2620] and defiled and will not fade away and that is a word that is used in reference to flowers and flowers fade. And you look at the beauty of a flower and you look at the gorgeous nature of the flower and the delicate parts of it and you say this is the most gorgeous wonderful beautiful thing in the world that has ever created. Look at this flower. How did God do this? And then it gets brown. And then it begins to disintegrate. And this is what
[time=2646] it means. Heaven will never diminish in its glory. Heaven will thrill you, unlike your
[time=2654] new car, the first time you see it, the hundredth time you see it, the millionth time you see
[time=2661] it, it will always be able to thrill your soul because it will never fade. When it be
[time=2668] nice to have something, when it be able to buy something that always produced the same exhilarating feeling as it did the day you bought it. That's what it's saying. Heaven will give you a rush for all of eternity. You see as good as christening the calypso
[time=2690] was. I mean as excited as Jacques Cousteau was that day out on that dock somewhere who knows where, when he finally raised all the money to get all the grants to build the big ship with all the expensive equipment. And finally the long 12, 13, 14, 18, 24-month process was done and the press was there and the dignitaries were there and there was Jacques Cousteau and the moment of glory, excitement of his life and they crashed that champagne thing against the hall of calypso. I mean that was an incredible moment. But it's not heaven. In fact it's
[time=2722] over now and the man who loved it most is now dead and soon the memory of the man who loved
[time=2728] it most will be forgotten. Could you imagine standing on the steps of the capital or wherever
[time=2735] they do that out there in Washington D.C. and here's the whole supreme court and here's all the congress and here's all the senate and here's the whole world looking on TVs and here's you and your wife and you're it. And you're the guy that's going to walk up there or you're the lady that's going to walk up there and put your hand on that bible and be inaugurated as the president of the United States and in an instant become the single
[time=2757] most powerful human being on the planet. Imagine what that feels like. As good as it is my
[time=2765] friends. It's over. That already happened in Ronald's life. The event itself is over.
[time=2774] His memory can't remember it. He will soon be dead and the memory of Ronald Reagan will
[time=2780] soon be dead. That is not true of heaven. You get it? That is not how heaven works. We
[time=2789] show up at the shores of the pearly gate and it's like wow and the next millennium it's
[time=2795] wow and the next millennium it's no kidding forever because heaven is imperishable. It's
[time=2807] undefiled and it will never fade away. Number five. You say it sounds pretty good. I hope
[time=2817] I get to see it. I mean I hope when I get there they let me in. That's the end of that's
[time=2826] the end of verse four. To obtain an inheritance which is imperishable and defiled will not fade away and it says it is reserved in heaven for you. It is reserved in heaven for you.
[time=2835] The reservation is confirmed. Now this is so important to these people. Try to put in your mind's eye. Try to get into your emotional capacity, the idea of having everything you ever had taken away from you. You thought you had it and then the political arena shifted
[time=2849] and the winds changed direction and then you were the persecuted, you were the outskirts and what you thought you had you no longer had. And these people have experienced incredible loss and they're saying don't promise me heaven as this beautiful thing. I had some beautiful things you know and I don't have them anymore. How do I know heaven won't be like all the other things that I used to have and don't have anymore? How do I know I'll get this place you call heaven they say to Peter. And Peter says well by divine
[time=2876] decree and the power this place has been reserved for you. And nobody's stronger than God can
[time=2884] take it away from you. And he is trying to reignite and trying to rebolster their ability
[time=2890] to have hope again. And what is so important about that component is that they've got a place to go called heaven which is far greater than anything they've ever experienced and that they are confident that when they get there it'll be theirs and nobody will take it away from them this time. And then right on the heels of that is number six. Not only
[time=2914] is it reserved for you but verse five. Number six verse five you are protected by the power
[time=2921] of God through faith for salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. Don't forget these people now say okay you got a great place it's called heaven I'd love to do that.
[time=2932] Now you promised me that it'll be mine nobody will take this one away from me correct it's reserved. But the next question they've got in their mind is well yeah okay but how do I know I get there? My friend was staked. My friend Fred he was broiled. My child is
[time=2950] dead. Don't you get it we were trying to get out of the city we were trying to get to a place we called heaven some place away from this Roman tyranny and a lot of my friends never even got to the destination. And so Peter says now listen to this let me tell you something here. Not only is heaven a place that's wonderful and not only do you have a place in heaven but God guarantees you're going to get that. And these are military
[time=2974] terms here some of your translations say shielded and that's because it's the connotation of military might. God by the power of military might divine military might is going to give
[time=2987] you an entourage to protect you all the day spiritually of your physical life here and usher
[time=2994] you into the direct presence of heaven. And you think about desert shield and it's transitioned desert storm and the aircraft carriers and the number of atomic warheads
[time=3004] and the tanks and the support staff and you think about the greatest army that was ever assembled which is what that was down there in the Gulf and it is nothing. It's nothing
[time=3016] compared to the divine protective power that guarantees you're getting to the location.
[time=3026] See can you feel God saying to these people listen I know your life's fallen apart but listen I chose you for salvation. I'm working in the midst of this hardship to sanctify you and make you like Christ and don't forget I'll never let you go to hell you've been sprinkled by the blood of my son. And just remember now gang where I'm taking you is a place called heaven that is imperishable and under file that will never fade away it'll never lose its luster in your heart. I've guaranteed your place in my heaven I've reserved it for
[time=3055] you and don't forget I'm going to protect you all the days of your life until I get you there. You actually have hope you have living hope not a dying hope. And this one blows
[time=3067] my mind this is number seven and it's found in verse seven and this one's hard even to say out loud in public but it's true. It says then the proof of your faith being more precious
[time=3077] than gold which is perishable even though tested by fire he's talking about their faith being tested by the trial. Now listen it will result in praise and glory and honor at the
[time=3088] revelation of Christ and I always thought that that meant that my faith and I think it's partly true that my faith being properly tested and I stand strong then at the end of the age Christ gets the praise and the glory and the honor. That's true but it's
[time=3104] true from a different passage. What this passage is saying is that when you get there into heaven and your faith has proven itself which it will then the praise and the glory
[time=3115] and the honor are going to be given to you. When you show up God is going to give praise
[time=3124] and glory and honor to you. Now tell me that won't be a rush. Standing in the presence
[time=3133] of God and hearing him praise you and give you glory and give you honor for the way you
[time=3142] conducted your life honor. It says in 1 Peter 2 20 for those of you skeptics who don't think
[time=3148] God is going to do that and I needed these verses too. It says in 1 Peter 2 20 the one who suffers righteously finds favor with God. You realize that men find favor in the heart
[time=3158] of God. Romans 2 talking about the truly converted says their praise is not from men but from God. That means God gives men praise because the truly converted take their praise
[time=3169] not from men but from God. Romans 2 also says 2 10 says that the saved what they get is
[time=3176] glory and honor to every man who does good. So we're going to show up there and he's going
[time=3185] to just break into praise and we're going to be the object of it. Now that's not so hard to believe. Have you ever been around a parent who's proud of their child? It can get nauseating can it? No that's what he's going to do. He's going to drool all of us
[time=3201] praises and glory and honor. This is my child. You see what he's saying to these poor persecuted
[time=3207] people is that down here on earth you were ridiculed. What you got from the lips of men was ridiculed and you were mocked and you were hated and you were cursed and you were blamed for things you didn't do. But when you get to heaven, not men, not people like
[time=3223] Nero, insane maniac, debauched, depraved men but the pure holy righteous living God is
[time=3230] going to open his mouth and he's going to give you praise and he's going to give you glory and he's going to give you honor won't you hang on please. Isn't this worth living for?
[time=3240] Isn't this worth suffering for? You don't want to run away from Christ do you? You don't want to recant your faith do you? You don't want to walk away from a living hope do you?
[time=3252] No you don't. Chosen by God. Sanctified by his power. Sprinkled by his blood. There
[time=3258] is an imperishable inheritance a confirmed reservation divine protection en route and
[time=3264] when you arrive praise and honor and glory from the lips of God. Makes me want to keep
[time=3271] living my faith. How about you? Verse 8. You say what do we do in the meantime? Heaven's
[time=3280] a long way away. I got you know I'm going to live 70 plus. Verse 8 and though you have
[time=3286] not seen him you love him. You love him and that when we were last week Peter follow me
[time=3295] Christ said Peter fall in love with me love me live for me follow me do what I say go where
[time=3301] I want you to go get caught up in your affections for who I am. What Peter is saying is here now you guys got to do the same thing I had to learn how to do which is to love Christ between now and the time you get glorified in heaven just spend your whole life loving Christ. Not such a bad thing to be doing between now and the time he takes us to glory and
[time=3319] gives us glory. And what does it all produce? What does a living hope produce like a verse
[time=3326] 6? Just quickly now we're almost done. A living hope produces this in verse 6 in this what's this? That's the living hope up there in verse 3. In this you greatly rejoice. A
[time=3338] living hope produces great rejoicing so that even though they're in the midst of these trials and they're being hunted like wild animals to be slaughtered like wild animals he is saying because you have a living hope you can greatly rejoice. Look at the universe 8 it says you believe in him and you greatly rejoice with joy in expressible and fall of
[time=3360] glory. You're saying there's no reason to be downtrodden here there's no reason to be the poor suffering self poor me pitied believer sure embrace your trial and hurt over the loss
[time=3372] of your loved ones and the loss of your life and the purposes you'd set before you as you tried to live. Oh yeah you're hurt over all that but there is a greater reality in your life and that is that you have a living hope and so you can greatly rejoice and you can rejoice with a joy in expressible. There's just no end of that. Well it's exciting in
[time=3396] it we are living hope and here's what blows my mind because we got to be a couple of things
[time=3406] because we got to live in America and then on top of that and more importantly we got to know Christ. I mean you put those two things together we're living about the best lives that anybody can live and you know what that means all it is going to do one thing just
[time=3422] going to get better and so we have all people just have to work hard I think a pinch in
[time=3429] ourselves and saying God help me be grateful help me be grateful got a family I love got
[time=3436] a family that loves me I'm saved I'm free I get to pick my vocation by and large and
[time=3444] now I get to wait forever. We want to close with praise so we've asked the guys to come
[time=3451] and lead us in a couple of closing songs and good I didn't know where you were Scott.
[time=3460] And you know somewhere from you saying very well by the way that I was so proud of us as a church I love it when you just let it out you know open your mouth and now we get to do it again but let's do it with the sense of gratitude for how good life is how good
[time=3474] God is and how wonderful heaven is going to be.
[time=3478] Our gracious God and Heavenly Father it is our great joy and privilege to sing you honor and glory and praise in whatever glory honor and praise you may send our way at the end
[time=3490] of the age. We will be saying in our hearts it's only because of Christ it's only because
[time=3498] of Christ it's only because of Christ and so we worship you today because of Christ and
[time=3505] for giving us a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead we pray these
[time=3514] things in Christ name and all God's people say amen God bless you.
