[time=30] This is the Sunday Morning Worship Service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=47] Thank you for joining us.
[time=49] Many times today we hear people say, "I can't help it.
[time=52] He made me do it.
[time=53] I'm a victim of my own circumstances." As he continues his study in the book of 1 Peter, Pastor Moore explores what the Bible says about acting as free men.
[time=63] We hope you'll stay tuned.
[time=65] Now let's join our service.
[time=86] (Music)
[time=170] Now the years have come, and the years have gone, and the cause of Jesus still goes on.
[time=182] Now a time has come to count the cost, to reject this world, to embrace the cross,
[time=196] and one by one let's live our lives, for the one who died to give us life,
[time=210] to the drum and sound of final day, as proudly said and proudly said,
[time=223] "I can't only dance to the men, with all my strength, with all I am,
[time=236] I will see to all the years come, and I pledge allegiance to the men,
[time=253] to the men of God, to all my faith, to all our faith, to all our shame,
[time=268] I will see to all our years come, and I pledge allegiance to
[time=282] the men of God, to all my friends of Jesus, to the men,
[time=295] with all my strength, with all I am, I will see to all the years come,
[time=308] and I pledge allegiance to the men of God, to all our ages, to the men,
[time=321] with all my strength, with all I am, I will see to all the years come,
[time=333] and my friends of Jesus, to the men of God,
[time=347] to all our lives, to all our lives."
[time=377] You're quiet laughter a smile on your face, the way you hold my mouth,
[time=392] in a loving embrace, you showed the kind of love I needed to see,
[time=403] Dad, I know you've been just like a father should be,
[time=416] but your gentle strength, your loving touch, your faith in Jesus taught me so much,
[time=434] you had the patience to put up with me,
[time=441] Dad, I know you've been just like a father should be,
[time=454] you gave me everything you could give,
[time=462] and you are the one who taught me how to be,
[time=473] I pray that one day my son says to me, Dad, I know you've been just like a father should be,
[time=490] you gave me everything you could give,
[time=504] and you are the one who taught me how to be,
[time=517] I pray that one day my son says to me, Dad, I know you've been just like a father to me,
[time=553] I know you've been just like a father, I know you've been just like a father,
[time=597] this morning I want to talk with you about a little phrase that comes out of the passage we're studying,
[time=603] and the phrase is this, act as free men, act as free men, you see it's possible to be free,
[time=612] but not to act as a free person, as I illustrate in those opening phrases, for example,
[time=620] that's me, that's just the way I am, you see what that phrase really is saying is this,
[time=626] I am determined, there's nothing that I can do about it, if you don't like the way I'm behaving, I'm sorry, that's me, that's just the way I am, I'm determined in essence, or the phrase,
[time=638] he makes me so mad, these are the words of an enslaved person, not a free person,
[time=644] and they mean this, I'm not responsible, my emotional life is governed by something outside of my control,
[time=651] he makes me, he makes me so mad, I'm not responsible for my emotions, another enslaved statement,
[time=661] I can't do that, I just don't have the time, that reveals this sentiment, something outside of me,
[time=669] namely limited time, is controlling me, I can't do what you want me to do, I can't be held
[time=675] responsible to do what you want me to do, why? Because I don't have time, I'm not really a free person, I'm not really responsible for my life, why? Something outside of me, something called limited time is controlling me, another enslaved sentence, if only my wife were more patient,
[time=693] what this is really saying is this, someone else's behavior is limiting my effectiveness,
[time=700] it's my wife, it's her problem, it's her impatience, if only my wife were more patient,
[time=706] I would do this, this, this, life would be this, this, this, I would feel this way or that way, in essence someone else's behavior is limiting my effectiveness, the last sentence I read to you,
[time=716] I have to do it, this in essence is saying this, circumstances or other people are forcing me to do what I do,
[time=724] I am in fact not free to choose my own actions, these phrases come out of an understanding of
[time=732] a deterministic paradigm, a deterministic paradigm where things are determined for us.
[time=737] Three common venues of thinking into the deterministic paradigm, the first is genetic, I am the way I am,
[time=743] and that comes to me from my grandparents, there are certain things in my genetic pool, and I am not really free to choose my emotions, my choices, the direction in life,
[time=754] because I have these certain things called genes that have been handed down to me through my family tree, it's called genetic determinism. Another category into that would be the psychological determinism,
[time=765] which is not my grandparents, it's my parents, it's the way they raised me, it's the things they did to me
[time=771] or didn't do to me, the things they said to me or didn't say to me, the love they showed me or didn't show me, the reason I am acting this way right now is because of the psychological problems or the way that my psychological makeup has been determined for me by my parents.
[time=786] I am not free to choose my response, it has been determined by my parents.
[time=791] And the third underneath this deterministic paradigm is the environmental factors.
[time=797] In this case, it's not your grandparents, it's not your parents, it's your wife, your kids, your job, your culture, your society.
[time=805] I am doing these things because my wife is not patient enough, because my child is giving me a problem, because I don't like my job, because I live in America, and these things happen in America.
[time=815] I am not free, so you're here again, don't you? That's me, that's just the way I am.
[time=821] That is a very strong deterministic sentence, which is trying to jettison personal responsibility
[time=827] and trying to say that I have been determined by my grandparents, or by the way my parents raised me, or by the way my wife is treating me.
[time=835] He makes me so mad. I'm not free, am I? To choose my emotional response in this situation because of the way that he has acted.
[time=845] That's an environmental determinism. I can't do that, I just don't have time, what is that?
[time=850] That's an environmental determinism statement saying, don't hold me responsible for this particular thing, I don't have the time.
[time=856] There's something in my environment that is really at fault here, not me, I'm not free.
[time=862] We talked about if only my wife were more patient. I have to do it.
[time=867] Well now what could that mean? I have to do it because of the genes that I inherited from my grandparents.
[time=872] That's the only way I can do these things. It's genetic. I have to do what?
[time=876] Well my parents raised me a certain way and I can't get outside that paradigm, I just have to be this way.
[time=880] I have to do it what? Well because of the circumstances I had no choice.
[time=884] It's enslavement. The Word of God invites us to be free, to act as free men because we are.
[time=897] Peter is writing and we'll open our text in a little bit, but Peter is writing to a group of believers who have very, very harsh circumstances.
[time=906] The environmental factors in their life are incredibly harsh. They are being persecuted, they are being put to death, they are being made sport of as they are being put to death.
[time=915] And long before that they had lost all their rights, their possessions, their jobs, their homes, some of them family members.
[time=921] And they were falling into sin that you might want to open to 1 Peter, chapter 2.
[time=927] For those of you who are joining us today, we've been studying through the book of 1 Peter, just kind of in a sequential nature trying to understand what the author is saying.
[time=935] As he wrote to these people back 2000 years ago, and then because we believe that this is God's Word, we try to find the principles and apply them to our own lives here in the 20th century.
[time=947] Now these believers were being persecuted, of course because of their faith, their whole life had been turned upside down, and they were falling into a deterministic paradigm, an environmental deterministic paradigm.
[time=958] Look at verse 11 of chapter 2, "Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers to what? To abstain from fleshly lusts which wage war against the soul?"
[time=968] It's obvious that these believers were falling into fleshly lusts, and that doesn't just mean sensual things, that's any gratification of your selfishness.
[time=975] That could have happened in a relationship with a Christian, it could be just mean spiritedness, or selfishness, or you could be lying, or you could be cheating, or you could be compromising financially,
[time=985] or I mean any category where self is being gratified is what it means by fleshly lusts.
[time=992] And apparently these believers, under the umbrella of the harsh environmental circumstances in which they were living, were beginning to detach themselves and say,
[time=1001] "I am not really responsible for my behavior because, well man, I'm under incredible pressure."
[time=1007] You could hear them saying that, couldn't you?
[time=1009] This persecution thing with Nero, it's just gone on too long, and I was able to obey at the beginning, but my resources are now depleted, and I just can't.
[time=1016] I just can't continue to obey God under these circumstances.
[time=1022] They might say, "I don't see how the Lord could love us.
[time=1025] I'm confused about my relationship with the Lord, and as a result, I'm not obeying Him anymore.
[time=1030] I don't see how God really loved me.
[time=1032] He could put my family through these torturous things, and I lost my wife, and I lost my kids, and I lost my job, and I wanted to live in Rome.
[time=1038] Now I'm out here in Antioch somewhere, and I hate my life, and I can't believe that a God who truly loves me would let this happen to me.
[time=1045] So my behavior, you see, isn't my fault, it's somebody else's fault.
[time=1052] There's a progression in the deterministic mindset where once the deterministic approach has been adopted, it's not my fault, I don't have time.
[time=1066] That's just the way I am.
[time=1068] Once that language begins to fill our mind, then sinful behavior can be justified, and it becomes a status in our life.
[time=1076] And instead of repentance, instead of turning from fleshly lusts, we blame or justify that behavior on someone or something else other than ourselves.
[time=1086] The word of God this morning invites us to stand up and act as free men, free women.
[time=1092] Now freedom, as you're going to see, as this text unfolds, is going to come off in three different ways.
[time=1098] So what does it mean to act free?
[time=1099] Number one, you choose your values.
[time=1101] When you're truly free, you choose your values, and by value, I mean you choose what is going to be important to you.
[time=1108] You reserve the right to choose what is important to you.
[time=1113] Secondly, you act on those values.
[time=1115] First, you choose your values, then you act on those values, and then thirdly, you enjoy or reap the fruits of those values.
[time=1121] You choose your roots of those first two choices.
[time=1124] You choose your values, then you choose to act consistent with your values, and then you reap the benefits of that kind of freedom.
[time=1129] And that is exactly what Peter is calling for in the life of these highly distressed believers.
[time=1134] Now, by the way, I do believe that we get bad genes.
[time=1138] The Bible is very clear.
[time=1139] We are born sinners.
[time=1141] God created a perfect man and a perfect wooderman in Adam and Eve, and they fell, and when they did, they brought sin.
[time=1146] And all the human race, Romans 5 says, and you and I are born sinners, and we get that genetically.
[time=1151] That happens because we're born of a man or born of a woman or born of the union of two.
[time=1156] And I have bad genes, and I have some of the same sinful traits that my dad has, and I have some of the same sinful traits that my mom has.
[time=1164] And that's true, and so do you.
[time=1165] If you know yourself at all, you've found those things out.
[time=1168] I also believe that parents do damage to kids.
[time=1172] I believe that our psychological well-being is damaged, and the word of God is very open about that.
[time=1177] And it talks about the sin that has visited down to the second, the third, and the fourth generation.
[time=1182] And the stuff that a father or a grandfather starts doesn't play its sinful way out into following generations because he warps his kids.
[time=1189] I think Jacob is a classic example of that with the favoritism that was shown to the sons.
[time=1194] And all that happened to Joseph could largely be attributed, in my opinion, to the favoritism that was the sin that was bound up in the heart of his father.
[time=1201] That then found its way into the second generation.
[time=1203] So I'm not saying that doesn't exist.
[time=1205] It exists.
[time=1206] Genetic sin exists.
[time=1207] Psychological damaging from parents exists.
[time=1210] The Bible acknowledges it.
[time=1211] And certainly, environmental pressures are openly acknowledged in the word of God.
[time=1216] We're reading about people who are in incredible stress under environmental.
[time=1220] And the word of God acknowledges that it can be used as an excuse to fall into sin.
[time=1226] So all three of those things exist.
[time=1228] Please don't hear me to say this morning that I don't believe in genetic sin or I don't believe in the psychological damage that a parent can have on a child or that I don't believe that certain circumstances in life, environmental things can have a huge impact on a person.
[time=1241] They're there.
[time=1242] That's what's so wonderful about it.
[time=1244] The word of God is saying all that notwithstanding, all those things existing, let me teach you how to be free of those things.
[time=1254] They're there. They're real and they're powerful.
[time=1258] But let me teach you how to live above them.
[time=1261] Let me teach you to how to live in spite of them.
[time=1264] Let me show you how to be free.
[time=1266] So you are not determined by the genes.
[time=1268] You are not determined by psychological problems that were inherited or given to you by your parents, etc.
[time=1274] Now Christians are especially prone to this.
[time=1278] We're talking about genetic problems and psychological problems and some of you are thinking, boy, he's got that world by the throat this morning.
[time=1287] He's talking about that secular psychology psychobabble stuff and he's saying that you're responsible for hair and I'm glad he's saying it about those people out there, those unsafe people.
[time=1297] Let me tell you who the greatest perpetrators are.
[time=1300] You know how we do it?
[time=1302] We do it by adding one simple sentence.
[time=1306] We say it this and the word by the way is Lord.
[time=1310] Goes like this.
[time=1312] Sorry about being late to my appointment here, 15 minutes late in fact.
[time=1316] Sorry about that.
[time=1317] I was on the phone with my unsaved mother and I felt that the Lord wanted me to spend a little more time with her on the phone and so I'm late.
[time=1328] What am I saying? Not my fault, I'm late. I'm not free to make my decisions as to hang up or not hang up.
[time=1334] The Lord called this one so don't hold me accountable for being 15 minutes late with you.
[time=1338] We do that all the time, don't we?
[time=1340] It's called Christian ease.
[time=1342] And all we have to do is take our bad choices and find a Christian slant to throw at it and blame it on the Lord and suddenly we think we can wipe our hands and walk away from it and say, well, no, my problem.
[time=1353] I was following the Lord.
[time=1354] No, I can't help you with the junior high ministry this year.
[time=1357] I know I said I would earlier in the summer, but now as things have played out, here it is, the Lord has brought some changes into my life and I don't feel that he is leading me to minister in the children's vision or the youth ministry anymore.
[time=1371] So sorry.
[time=1372] Determinism beyond our wildest dreams.
[time=1377] And we don't just go to environment and parents and genetics.
[time=1381] We go to the source.
[time=1382] God is why I can't help you.
[time=1386] God is why I'm late.
[time=1388] God is why I can't keep this commitment.
[time=1396] Let me show you how this works out of my life.
[time=1399] I think we got some slide support for this one.
[time=1402] About six years ago, almost seven now, we were at a decision point.
[time=1408] Crossroads.
[time=1409] Where are we going to live?
[time=1410] What are we going to do for a career?
[time=1411] The Masters College and Grace can be church in about 12 years.
[time=1415] I felt called, here we go, of the Lord to be a senior pastor and so crossroads.
[time=1421] Now I want you to let this represent values inside my heart.
[time=1425] Just plus this little picture right here and this is what's going on inside of me six years ago as I think this through.
[time=1431] Now I choose, I want to dim the lights just a little bit, I choose to go ahead and spike certain values inside my internal thinking.
[time=1439] And I spike church, but not because they're more important to me to family as it might look, but we're at a career crossroads.
[time=1445] And so one of the things I'm really looking careful at is career, church, ministry, decision.
[time=1450] Then family, how does this thing work for my family?
[time=1453] And then how about a place to house my family?
[time=1456] You know, when you're trying to find a place to encapsulate seven people, it's an issue.
[time=1459] And then you take weather and at that particular point I put weather way, way low.
[time=1463] Now as you know I grew up in California and the weather's perfect where I grew up in California, it's the best thing God ever did in terms of weather.
[time=1469] But at this particular time I choose to push that value down.
[time=1473] I'm not saying this to myself necessarily, I'm just what? I'm just following the Lord and I bring these values.
[time=1480] I look at Fort Wayne. Well Fort Wayne hits these completely out of the park.
[time=1484] I mean you can't find a better place if those are the values that you prioritize, church and family and a home and the kinds of stuff we have here.
[time=1492] And so you say to yourself, you know what? God has led me.
[time=1497] God has led me to Fort Wayne. I praise God for your direction. Thank you all so much. We come here.
[time=1503] Next slide.
[time=1505] Yeah, that's right.
[time=1512] You get here. You live here.
[time=1515] You'll be here a couple of years. Some hard things happen in the church and things you're going to expect begin to happen in your life.
[time=1521] And suddenly you're miserable and you begin to say God, how could you be so mean, spirited as to lead me to Fort Wayne?
[time=1534] Because the weather here sucks.
[time=1544] Did the Lord change? Did the Lord change? No. Did Fort Wayne change? No.
[time=1550] Did our church change a little bit? What changed?
[time=1554] The values that I chose to make important at my life at that time.
[time=1560] And so I sit there and say, "Hey Lord, this is a bum deal. This is a rap deal. I don't know if I really want to live here.
[time=1565] This is like year 2, 3, 4. I don't know if I really want to live here, man. I can't stand it. Where's the weather?
[time=1569] I haven't seen the sun in 35 days. I've seen it in my friends. I'm calling home. California, you guys got sun out there.
[time=1574] We don't have sun out here. It's 35 days. No sun. Click.
[time=1579] I'm not sure I like the Lord. I'm not sure I love the Lord. I'm not sure I want to serve the Lord. Why?
[time=1583] Because this is spiking and I'm blaming it on him.
[time=1588] I think here's his response.
[time=1590] Excuse me. Time out. Hold the phone. I made you as an image bearer. That means you get to make choices.
[time=1597] Not just about where you're going to live. You get to make choices about what's important to you.
[time=1601] Now, when you were making the decision about Fort Wayne, you chose to spike certain values.
[time=1607] They were good values. They were the right values. They were a great ministry. They were a place to raise your family.
[time=1613] They were a place to have a home. They were a place to do all this stuff.
[time=1617] You chose Fort Wayne based upon the values that you chose to spike in your life at that time.
[time=1626] And you called it my will because it worked with your values.
[time=1632] Now, you change your values on me. I haven't changed. Fort Wayne hasn't changed. What I called you to do hasn't changed.
[time=1642] You change your values. It no longer fits your new values and you blame me.
[time=1647] As if I am not a God to be worshiped, to be loved, to be served, and to be adored.
[time=1653] Do you see how it works? Act as freemen. Act as freemen.
[time=1660] Then you're saying choose your values. And once you have chosen the right values,
[time=1666] then you can choose appropriate behavior. And then when those two things come together, there are some remarkable blessings which I will talk about at the end of this sermon.
[time=1675] There are two. The text just highlights two incredible benefits.
[time=1678] If you'll be free, which means choose your values, choose your behavior based upon your values, then there are two enormously unbelievably mind-boggling consequences that just flow out of this.
[time=1688] That will bless your life. Now, let's go to verses 16 and 17. Let's try to see this in the text.
[time=1695] Look at verse 16. Here it is. Here's the phrase. This is, in fact, the central phrase of the entire section of this book.
[time=1701] Act as freemen. Then he says, as a qualifier, "Do not use your freedom as a covering for evil, but use it as a bond slave of God." What's he mean? He is saying, "Don't use your freedom, the ability as a human being to make choices about values and about behavior.
[time=1719] Don't use that as a covering for evil. Don't use that to fall into the fleshly lusts of verse 11. Don't start spiking all the wrong values.
[time=1728] Get all disjointed with me and then run off into sin and blame me for your sin.
[time=1733] Don't use your freedom as a covering for evil." He says, act as a freeman in verse 16 and use that freedom to make yourself
[time=1743] choose to make yourself a bond slave of God. In other words, spite the values in your life that will ultimately lead to you being a bond servant of the true and living God. Be free.
[time=1755] Now, what are those values? Well, he didn't give all of his values.
[time=1758] I mean, take the whole Bible, right? But he pulls four of them. Look at verse 17.
[time=1762] He lists four key values that are appropriate to the experience and the time in which these people are living. What are they? One, honor all men. You choose to have a value that's above all the other values that you will honor all men, and you'll see how hard that is.
[time=1778] Number two, love the brethren. Number three, fear God.
[time=1781] Number four, honor the king. Spike those values in your life because you want to, because you're coherent, because I'm telling you to as the true and living God, be a free human being and choose the values that you're going to have in your heart. What's going to be important and what's not going to be important? Now, another graph here.
[time=1800] Let's see how this works. These people were under enormous persecution.
[time=1805] You see, I have the four values here to the left, honor all men, love the brotherhood, fear God, honor the king. But this last one that is predominant and prevailing and has a priority right now in their lives is the word other. Now, what might that mean to them?
[time=1819] If they spike the value, I want my job back. Remember, they lost their jobs.
[time=1825] If they spike the value, I want to live in Rome.
[time=1828] I loved Rome. Rome was the cultural center of the world.
[time=1831] I don't like living out in this cave in the middle of nowhere.
[time=1834] If they spike the value, you know, and this is big, I'd like my wife back and I'd like my kids who were lost in the persecution.
[time=1844] What he is saying to them is if you spike one of those values, were any of those wrong? Is it wrong to want your job?
[time=1851] Is it wrong to want to live somewhere like Rome?
[time=1855] Is it intrinsically immoral to want your wife? No.
[time=1858] He's not even saying, in this case to these people, don't want immoral things. He's even saying, even in the moral category, you have got to learn to diminish certain things.
[time=1872] If you spike them, if you spike those things, you will be miserable.
[time=1877] You will end up hating me because the way I'm letting the world go now, isn't going to fit those, and you will fall into fleshly lusts.
[time=1887] So here's what he says. Next slide. Here's what he wants.
[time=1891] Here's freedom. Here's a choice.
[time=1895] He says, you choose to diminish those other values.
[time=1898] You make them less important to you because you're free. Act as a free man.
[time=1902] Your values are not determined. You determine your values.
[time=1906] And you determined then to spike honor all men, love the brotherhood, fear God, and honor the king. And even in your deplorable, harassed, persecuted circumstances, these values can thrive.
[time=1922] These values can make you whole. These values can produce enormous satisfaction, completeness, a life worth living. Act is free men.
[time=1933] But if you choose to spike the other, well, Katie brought the door.
[time=1941] And the time that remains, I'd like to show you how he intends for that to work in their lives in two key categories. Number one was how it works with government.
[time=1948] Freedom. Acting as a free man in an oppressive government.
[time=1952] And then secondly, acting as a free man in an employment situation,
[time=1958] an employment situation. And you'll find that's a very generous word, employment. And at the close, as I said, I want to try to highlight the two blessings that flow as a result of acting as a free man.
[time=1969] The first one is the government.
[time=1972] The section he entertains here in verses 13 to 15 is about the government.
[time=1976] Found something out this week about Nero, coincidentally, that just struck a cultural chord in terms of a contemporary event.
[time=1984] Let me tell you something about Nero. Nero came to power in 54 A.D.
[time=1990] He came to power at 17 years of age. He was an avowed, avid, dedicated, maniacal, homosexual.
[time=2000] He was a pathological liar. He was a murderer.
[time=2005] And he killed himself at a very young age.
[time=2009] Who's that sound like you? Cunanan.
[time=2013] Does that sound like the reign of terror that the homosexual population of our country just sat under? Cunanan at the age of 17 voted most likely not to be forgotten and an avowed, open, homosexual, even at that time.
[time=2026] A gigolo, given his whole life to the perpetuation of his trade, homosexuality. They say a pathological liar.
[time=2033] His friends say he could lie at the drop of a hat.
[time=2036] We know he was a murderer, or these preponderance evidence indicates.
[time=2040] And of course, he committed suicide, not like Nero at 31, but in his mid-20s.
[time=2045] Now, what I'm trying to tie here for you is the homosexual community is up in arms against the FBI. Maybe there's some legitimacy. Maybe there isn't.
[time=2052] But the point they're trying to make is, look, we had a guy on the loose who had us in the crosshairs, and he was a liar, and he was a murderer.
[time=2059] And we were terrorized. Now, here's what it is.
[time=2063] How would you like to live in a country where Cunanan becomes the president, more than the president, not checked by any collateral powers, becomes the monarch, the Caesar. That's who Nero was.
[time=2075] And his vengeance was against Christians.
[time=2079] The reason the Christians were in such hot water is because Nero was an incredibly good liar. He was able somehow to convince the entire population that the Christians had started that fire, not himself.
[time=2093] The original truth was on the streets, and he somehow weaved a web of deceit and got people inflamed against the Christians, and we know he was a murderer.
[time=2102] He used to take and wrap Christians in tar and cloth, tie them to poles, and light them on fire to provide the light as a tiki torch wood for his many unbelievable parties, and I mean that in the worst of ways.
[time=2116] He would sit as the reigning power over their persecution in the Colosseum as they would be dismembered by wild beasts, and he would love every minute of it. And he was in charge.
[time=2129] He was God. He was worshiped as God by the Romans.
[time=2135] And you're a Christian, and he's put his crosshairs on you.
[time=2141] And he has authorized and made wholesale and made world-wide, and no holes barred the complete persecution of you and your kind.
[time=2152] That is what these people were living with. You want to talk about a hostile environment?
[time=2157] Do you see how easy it would be, even as a believer in that day, to begin to break the laws of Rome, to begin to not be submissive to the laws of Rome,
[time=2168] to begin to beyond what is given to us biblically to honor God, where we honor God.
[time=2174] But I mean, can you can you begin to hear the deterministic thinking where you do whatever you want to do and blame it all on Nero?
[time=2180] Excuse your behavior because of the beasts that Nero is, and justify any manner of sin against the Roman government because of Nero himself.
[time=2192] Look at verses 13 and 14. Listen to what the Word of God says.
[time=2196] My friends, my believers, my fellow lovers of Christ, submit yourself for the Lord's sake to every human institution,
[time=2207] whether to, let's just put his name there, whether to Nero, as the one in authority or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers.
[time=2216] The word submit is a military term, and it means to voluntarily, voluntarily rank yourself underneath a superior.
[time=2225] So as all the justification was running like wildfire through the Christian community, as they would be subversive and they would be in lack of submission to the Roman government,
[time=2237] Peter says to them, you stop your justification. You stop acting like slaves.
[time=2242] You start being free men, which means you choose a value.
[time=2248] Now what's the value? You remember I read it to you in verse 17, one of the four that Peter listed was honor the king, honor the king.
[time=2255] You choose a value to honor the king. Now listen, not because Nero deserves it.
[time=2259] Not because there's some intrinsic value or worth in the person of Nero.
[time=2263] There was next to nothing in this man that was worth any kind of respect.
[time=2267] If you let him and the quality of his life determine the amount of respect
[time=2273] you will give his office, you're in bondage to him.
[time=2276] He now controls the degree to which you will honor the office of the king.
[time=2281] And Peter says, no, you've got to be free of that.
[time=2284] You choose on your own free will to honor the man and the position in the place of king.
[time=2290] And you're free. And then it doesn't matter who he is, or how he acts, or how wonderful or how bad he is.
[time=2297] You are acting as a free, autonomous lover of God.
[time=2303] And then of course, having chosen that value, act on that value, and Paul, Peter calls them, the action called for his submission.
[time=2312] It's an amazing truth isn't it? I told you, living free is hard.
[time=2319] Because living free is living responsible, and living responsible is hard.
[time=2326] A man by the name of Victor, Victor Frankel, taken captive in the Nazi regime during World War II as a Jew and imprisoned in one of their camps.
[time=2336] One day naked and alone in a small room he began to become aware of what he later called "the last of human freedoms." The freedom his Nazi captors could not take away.
[time=2349] They could control his entire environment.
[time=2352] They could do what they wanted to his body.
[time=2354] But Victor Frankel himself was a self-aware being who could look as an observer at his very involvement.
[time=2360] His basic identity was intact.
[time=2364] He could decide within himself how all of this was going to affect him.
[time=2370] Between what happened to him, or the stimulus, and his response to it was his freedom or power to choose that response.
[time=2379] In the midst of his experience, Frankel would project himself into different circumstances such as lecturing to his students after his release from the death camps.
[time=2387] He'd mentally project out there.
[time=2389] He would describe himself in the classroom, in his mind's eye, and give his students the lessons he was learning during his very torture.
[time=2398] Through a series of such disciplines, mental emotional and moral, principally using memory and imagination, he exercised his small embryonic freedom until it grew larger and larger, until he had more freedom than his Nazi captors.
[time=2413] They had more liberty. They had more options to choose from in their environment.
[time=2418] But he had more freedom, more internal power to exercise his options.
[time=2423] He became an inspiration to those around him, even to some of the guards.
[time=2427] He helped others find meaning in their suffering and dignity in their prison existence.
[time=2432] That captures it right there. Be free. Be free. Do not be determined.
[time=2440] Be a self-aware, autonomous, image-bearing human being.
[time=2446] And decide for yourself what will be important to you.
[time=2451] And then choose to act upon those values. In this case, value, I will honor the king.
[time=2458] Action or behavior that follows, I will submit the king.
[time=2464] Let's see how it works in employment. He takes up employment next.
[time=2468] And really, as I say, employment is a graceful word for a very, very, very bad situation.
[time=2472] From a historian writing on this period of time and the experience of a slave, let me say this, "In the time of the early church, there were as many as 60 million slaves in the Roman Empire."
[time=2486] This was no small problem. It was pervasive. I continue.
[time=2490] It was by no means only menial tasks which were performed by slaves, doctors, teachers, musicians, actors, secretaries, stewards and slaves. In fact, all the work of Rome was done by slaves.
[time=2500] Roman attitude was that there was no point in being master of the world and doing one's own work.
[time=2506] Let the slaves do that and let the citizens live in pampered idleness.
[time=2510] The supply of slaves would never run out.
[time=2513] Now, listen, slaves were not allowed to marry, but they cohabitated.
[time=2517] And the children born of such a partnership with the property of the master, not of the parents, just as lambs born to a sheep belonged to the owner of the flock, not to the sheep.
[time=2527] It would be wrong to think that the lot of slaves was always wretched and unhappy and that they were always treated with cruelty.
[time=2533] Many slaves were loved and trusted members of the family, but one great and escapable fact dominated the whole situation.
[time=2539] In Roman law, a slave was not a person but a thing, and he had absolutely no legal rights whatsoever.
[time=2547] For that reason, there could be no such thing as justice where a slave was concerned.
[time=2551] Whatever a master does to a slave, undeservedly in anger, willingly or unwillingly in forgetfulness or after careful thought,
[time=2559] knowingly or unknowingly is judgment, justice, and law.
[time=2563] In regard to a slave, his master's will and even his master's caprice, or whim, if you will, was the only law.
[time=2573] That is unimaginable to me.
[time=2576] I cannot even begin to imagine having someone else, just one person, be the sole monarch of my life.
[time=2586] And though they would allow me to cohabitate and have children, they then at any moment could separate me from them without justification
[time=2594] and without cause and without reason other than they want to.
[time=2598] And to be able to say to me, yesterday you did this, tomorrow you will do this.
[time=2602] And you seem to enjoy that too much, so for the rest of your life, you never get to do that again.
[time=2607] Or I'm cutting your arm off today, or I'm killing you today.
[time=2613] I really have a long way to go before I'm able to understand at an empathetic level what that is about.
[time=2622] But this is the life those people lived, day in and day out, 60 million, 60 million slaves.
[time=2632] What's the value?
[time=2637] Verse 17, honor all men.
[time=2642] Amen?
[time=2643] [AMEN] The men who are my masters?
[time=2646] The men who are my masters who are the cruel and insanely jealous and the ones who take the light and destroy my life masters?
[time=2653] Yes.
[time=2654] Honor all men.
[time=2655] That's the value.
[time=2656] What's the behavior?
[time=2657] Look at verse 18.
[time=2659] Servants, be submissive to your masters with all respect.
[time=2663] Not only to those who are good and gentle, and there were some, but also to those who are unreasonable.
[time=2669] For this finds favor, for the sake of conscious towards God, a man bears up under sorrows when suffering unjustly.
[time=2679] See, there you can feel it all over again, couldn't you?
[time=2682] You got to be nuts.
[time=2683] I can't live doing the way that honors God.
[time=2684] I mean, I'm sorry I ever confessed Christ.
[time=2686] I mean, confessing Christ left me into the persecution of Nero, which gives my master now unbelievably excessive interest in persecuting me.
[time=2694] If I do the slightest little thing, he can be all over me for nothing.
[time=2697] I'm not going to honor God.
[time=2698] I can't be responsible.
[time=2699] This isn't my fault that Nero is such a wacko and I happen to be owned by somebody who I can't get out from underneath, and I have no just recourse.
[time=2705] I have no court of appeals.
[time=2706] I have no way to extricate myself from the situation.
[time=2708] If you think I'm going to be accountable to live a godly, holy, righteous life, you're nuts is what they were saying.
[time=2714] They had themselves down a long path of enslavement to justify their fleshly lusts.
[time=2723] And Peter says, no, no, no, no, no, don't do that.
[time=2727] Be free.
[time=2728] Act as a free person.
[time=2730] Choose your values.
[time=2731] Don't let anybody else choose your own values.
[time=2733] And one of the values God is calling you to choose is to honor all men, even wicked masters.
[time=2738] And once you've chosen that value, act consistently with that behavior.
[time=2742] Choose to act consistently with that value and so be submissive as God would have you be.
[time=2751] Stephen Covey writes on this subject very, very well.
[time=2754] He has a personal example that goes like this.
[time=2756] Once in Sacramento, when I was speaking on the subject of proactivity, a woman in the audience stood up in the middle of my presentation and started talking excitedly.
[time=2763] It was a large audience, and as a number of people turned to look at her, she suddenly became aware of what she was doing.
[time=2768] She grew embarrassed.
[time=2769] She sat down.
[time=2770] But she seemed to find it difficult to restrain herself and started talking to the people around her.
[time=2774] She seemed so happy.
[time=2775] I couldn't hardly wait for the break to find out what had happened.
[time=2778] When it finally came, I immediately went to her and asked if she'd be willing to share her experience with me.
[time=2783] "You just can't imagine what's happened to me," she said.
[time=2788] "I'm a full-time nurse to the most miserable, ungrateful man you can possibly imagine."
[time=2794] Nothing I do is good enough for him.
[time=2796] He never expresses appreciation.
[time=2798] He hardly ever encourages me.
[time=2800] He constantly harps at me and finds fault with everything I do.
[time=2804] Listen to this, this man has made my life miserable, and I often take out my frustration on my family.
[time=2814] Does that sound like what Peter's talking about?
[time=2816] This man has determined my emotional status.
[time=2819] It's his fault why I treat my family so poorly.
[time=2825] She goes on.
[time=2830] "We almost pray for his demise," she says.
[time=2835] The other nurses feel the same way, then she says this to him.
[time=2838] "And for you to have the gall to stand up there and suggest that nothing can hurt me, that no one can hurt me without my consent,
[time=2846] and that I have chosen my own emotional life of being miserable well, that was just no way I could buy into that."
[time=2854] "But I kept thinking about it," she said.
[time=2856] "I really went inside myself and I began to ask, do I have the power to choose my response?"
[time=2862] "When I finally realized that I do have that power, when I swallowed that bitter pill and realized that I had chosen to be miserable,
[time=2870] I also realized that I could choose not to be miserable." At that moment I stood up.
[time=2876] I felt as though I was being let out of San Quentin.
[time=2879] I wanted to yell to the whole world, "I'm free." I've been let out of prison no longer am I going to be controlled by the treatment of another human being.
[time=2890] Be free.
[time=2892] How do you be free?
[time=2894] You choose values.
[time=2896] Honor all men.
[time=2898] Then you choose to act consistent with your chosen value.
[time=2901] Submit to your master.
[time=2904] And then you're free.
[time=2906] Now I've been talking about the results.
[time=2908] Here they are.
[time=2909] Two results.
[time=2910] The amazing results.
[time=2913] The first one can be found up in verse 12.
[time=2916] It says, "Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles.
[time=2920] Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles." And what that means, that word excellence, that means a sense of wholeness.
[time=2926] Do you realize that when you choose your own values and act consistently with your values, you are a person of integrity.
[time=2933] You are whole.
[time=2935] There is no hypocrisy in your life.
[time=2937] You are complete.
[time=2938] You are solid.
[time=2939] You are submitted to God because you have chosen to be submitted to God because of the values you have chosen for yourself.
[time=2945] There is no hypocrisy in that.
[time=2949] Let's take, for example, the lack of integrity, the hypocrisy that can mark our life, even in Christianity.
[time=2956] Let's say, for example, we choose to spike a value in our life called money.
[time=2960] Possessions.
[time=2962] We spike that value.
[time=2963] We nurture the spiking of that value.
[time=2965] And we consistently, maybe unknowingly, but we diminish the competing values that God would have for that one value, having money.
[time=2974] We come into church.
[time=2976] We feel obligated in our heart because we're afraid what God might do if we don't.
[time=2980] And so we give 10%.
[time=2983] And if the truth were known, we give 10% because what we don't want to have happen to us is for him to get mad at us and then do something that would violate that number one value called money.
[time=2993] And so we give.
[time=2995] We give and we say to ourselves, we give because, well, we love God.
[time=3001] What an empty hollow existence.
[time=3003] What a hypocritical way to live your life.
[time=3007] Happens to me.
[time=3008] Happens to you.
[time=3011] Spike the wrong value.
[time=3014] Act as if you haven't spiked the wrong value and you have no integrity.
[time=3018] You're a hypocrite.
[time=3022] Before the service, a dear friend of mine in this church explained in our prayer time, explained the process that he's going through as he's learned that his wife has cancer.
[time=3034] And he, not knowing what I was talking about today, he was able to say, you know, when I first got the news and the test results came back, I'll tell you what, I was just, I didn't know how to handle it.
[time=3043] I didn't know how to process it.
[time=3044] I felt like my world was coming in like this.
[time=3047] And he says, you know, I got together with a good Christian friend when we talked these things through, and I prayed for peace, and I can tell you when I woke up this morning, it was okay.
[time=3057] I don't want my wife to have cancer, but it was okay.
[time=3062] And what was he doing?
[time=3065] Certain values had spiked in his life, and some of those, without even trying to spike them, some okay values just got a little too high.
[time=3073] And then a tragedy strikes, something that runs directly into those values.
[time=3078] And he doesn't know how to think, he doesn't know how the world's going to go on, he doesn't know if he can continue.
[time=3083] It gets together with a Christian friend, they begin talking, and going back over what's really important, what's not really important, who is God, can God be trusted?
[time=3093] How should you be towards your wife in the midst of this?
[time=3096] And suddenly certain values are getting diminished, and other values are surfacing?
[time=3101] And there's peace. Peace, what is peace? Peace is integrity.
[time=3105] He's now going to be able to walk through this situation as a whole human being, and he'll fight that, as we would expect.
[time=3112] But with good help, he'll walk with integrity.
[time=3118] What's the price you could give for integrity?
[time=3120] I mean, that's the ultimate thing that comes as a result of acting as a free man, the second one as we close.
[time=3128] It's a byproduct, but it happens, it's called evangelism.
[time=3132] You see again in verse 12, keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles, so that in the thing in which they slander you as evil doers, they may on account of your good deeds.
[time=3140] Now watch as they observe them and glorify God in the day of visitation.
[time=3146] What are you saying is you live that kind of life, you choose to choose your values, and then you choose to behave consistent with your values.
[time=3153] You live that kind of whole, God-honoring, full, integrity life, and the unsaved people around you are going to sense it, they're going to be alerted to it, they're going to be drawn to it, they're going to be shocked by it.
[time=3165] And you'll have a powerful witness for the cause of Christ, because you're acting as a free man, you're acting as he designed you to act, choosing your values, and choosing to act consistent with your values.
[time=3179] Herb and Ruth Klingen missionaries in the prior to and then during the Second World War, they were on staff at Grace Community Church when I was there.
[time=3189] They spent time in a terrible internment camp in the Second World War in the Philippines under the Japanese tyranny.
[time=3195] They tell about the people that were murdered in that camp, they tell about the deprivation of the people and the way they were starved to death.
[time=3203] They tell about the horrors of their camp and in his diary, Herb describes those three years that he was locked up inside this camp and he names a man by the name of Kunishi.
[time=3213] He says Kunishi was the fiercest and most hated of the Japanese authorities.
[time=3219] He was a ruthless, brutal, murderous torture who starved people to death, who would shoot people in the head personally.
[time=3229] You know all kinds of unbelievable things.
[time=3232] Herb writes this, "Kunishi found that an inventive way to abuse us.
[time=3236] He increased the food ration, but what he gave us was is it called P-E-L-E, P-E-L-E, which is unhusp rice.
[time=3249] Eating the rice with its razor-sharp outer shell would cause intestinal bleeding that would kill us in hours.
[time=3257] We had no tools to remove the husks and doing the job manually by pounding the grain or rolling it with a heavy stick consumed more calories than the rice would supply.
[time=3268] It was a death sentence for all of us." What a diabolical thing to do.
[time=3276] You've got control of these people.
[time=3278] They are in your power.
[time=3279] You are starving them to death and you throw mounds of unhusked rice in front of them and say, "Hey, have that."
[time=3286] If they eat it, they die.
[time=3288] If they try to unhusk it, they die.
[time=3291] But the food is within their reach.
[time=3294] He goes on to tell how before we consumed it and he admitted the fact that they were so hungry that many of them would have eaten it knowing it would kill them.
[time=3306] He says, "Just before we were in that place of decision, we were liberated by General MacArthur on February 24, 1945."
[time=3316] We later found out that was the very day that Kenushi had planned to kill us all.
[time=3322] Herb closes the wonderful testimony by saying this.
[time=3325] Years after the war, we learned that Kenushi had been found working as a groundskeeper at a Manila golf course.
[time=3332] He was put on trial for his war crimes and hanged.
[time=3336] Before his execution, he professed conversion to Christianity saying he had been deeply affected by the testimony of the Christian missionaries that he had persecuted.
[time=3351] In 1 Peter chapter 2 verse 9, he says, "I have made you a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possessions,
[time=3357] so that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who calls you out of darkness into his marvelous life."
[time=3363] And we do that through the proclamation of the gospel and we do that through the proclamation of our lives.
[time=3368] We do that as we act as free men, choosing our values, choosing to act consistently with our values and reaping the benefits.
[time=3380] My question to you this morning is, are you acting as a free human being?
[time=3390] As you would look, you would back up from any sin in your life, the relational tension in your life, or any individual private sin in your life.
[time=3399] Those would be the high points for you to back up from and begin to then to do a values check.
[time=3405] What have I spiked in my life? Get outside yourself, look inside yourself, which values have I spiked?
[time=3413] And you'll find the ones that have led you to that kind of sin.
[time=3417] And then you do the free thing, you change it.
[time=3420] You take those values and you push them down. In some cases you throw them out.
[time=3425] Then you beg God and you pray for God to spike the values that honor him.
[time=3432] Act as free men. Let's stand for a closing word of prayer.
[time=3439] Our gracious God and Heavenly Father, we need services like these periodically because as we've sung, the heart is prone to wonder.
[time=3454] And all too quickly, and sometimes without even our noticing, we begin to choose values and cultivate them
[time=3461] and water them and provide shade and nurture them and they grow.
[time=3466] And it's only after they've grown and reached disproportionate levels that we then begin to see the behavior that results from them.
[time=3475] I know I've seen it in my life, Lord. Seen it in the last seven days.
[time=3480] And I'm so thankful that we can come back to you and you can remind us of the great gift that you've given us in Christ
[time=3490] to be free.
[time=3493] And we pray, Lord, that we would not, in the midst of such enormous national freedom,
[time=3499] in any way, diminish our responsibility to act free in our freedom.
[time=3507] To choose our values.
