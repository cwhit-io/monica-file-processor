[time=30] (music)
[time=48] This is the Sunday Morning Worship Service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=52] Thank you for joining us.
[time=54] What is the difference between religion and Christianity?
[time=57] As he continues our study from the book of First Peter, Pastor Moore gives us five building blocks of salvation.
[time=64] We hope you'll stay tuned.
[time=65] Now let's join our service.
[time=67] (music)
[time=79] Silence, try to fathom the distance looking across the canyon carved by my hands.
[time=92] God is gracious and would still separate us.
[time=98] Were it not for the bridge His grace has made us.
[time=106] His love will carry me.
[time=113] There's a bridge to cross the great divine.
[time=120] A way was made to reach the other side.
[time=126] The mercy of the Father calls His Son His life.
[time=133] His love is deep.
[time=136] His love is bright.
[time=139] There's a cross to bridge the great divine.
[time=146] (music) Silence, faith long, on my own I'm an angel.
[time=156] He found me hopeless alone and sinned as Savior.
[time=163] He's provided a path in promise to guide us.
[time=169] Take Him past all the sin that would divide us.
[time=177] His love delivers me.
[time=184] There's a bridge to cross the great divine.
[time=191] A way was made to reach the other side.
[time=197] The mercy of the Father calls His Son His life.
[time=204] His love is deep.
[time=207] His love is bright.
[time=210] There's a cross to bridge the great divine.
[time=217] My Lord is light and give me mine.
[time=223] Oh, there's a bridge to cross the great divine.
[time=233] There's a cross to bridge the great divine.
[time=238] Oh, there's a bridge to cross the great divine.
[time=245] Oh, there's a bridge to reach the other side.
[time=253] The mercy of the Father calls His Son His life.
[time=259] His love is deep.
[time=262] His love is bright.
[time=266] There's a cross to bridge the great divine.
[time=272] There's a cross to bridge.
[time=274] There's a cross, there's a cross, there's a cross to bridge.
[time=278] There's a cross to bridge.
[time=284] There's a cross to bridge the great divine.
[time=300] It probably got me these new paints.
[time=305] My sister, Mary Ellen, said I could pay all her fingernails and toadails.
[time=311] So I paid each one a different color that I guess she got bored because she fell asleep.
[time=324] I paid her arms and legs too.
[time=331] Mommy went shopping.
[time=333] She left me to babysit for my baby brother Herschel.
[time=337] Herschel has measles.
[time=339] He has little, tidy red polka dots all over his body.
[time=344] So I took my tidiest brush and I dipped it in the red paint
[time=352] and I connected the dots.
[time=357] Now I am practicing my spelling on the wall.
[time=361] I think I will write down all my friend's names.
[time=365] There is Freddie and Marsha and Christopher.
[time=374] Hello, Mommy.
[time=377] No, I am not picking on the wall.
[time=381] I know you told me to wear a spark but I didn't get no paint on my clothes.
[time=388] Mommy, if I told you I painted the wall, would you spank me?
[time=398] You would?
[time=403] Then Freddie did it.
[time=405] God's going to get you for that.
[time=410] [MUSIC]
[time=435] Dad, you are still up.
[time=438] Not past 12, is it?
[time=440] 4, 30.
[time=442] We bolded 10 games tonight and the automatic pin setter was broken so we had to set all the pins by hand.
[time=449] No good, huh?
[time=451] Well, you can't win them all.
[time=453] Good night, Dad.
[time=457] What?
[time=460] You found pills in my dresser drawer.
[time=464] Are you accusing me of taking drugs?
[time=467] Let me see those things.
[time=469] Dad, these are dynamites.
[time=473] Good night.
[time=478] Now what?
[time=482] I don't know, Dad.
[time=484] You tell me.
[time=486] What do you smell on my breath?
[time=491] Oh, really?
[time=493] Well, maybe that's what the dynamites are for.
[time=495] Are you going to be excused now?
[time=499] You got a call from old lady Johnson?
[time=503] No, we did not throw a rock through her front window.
[time=506] A bowling ball, yes, a rock, no.
[time=509] Dad, quit yelling, you'll wake up the whole neighborhood.
[time=513] Two months, solitary confinement to my room with nothing but bread and water.
[time=517] Dad, are you sure you're not overreacting to the tension of the moment?
[time=521] All right, Dad, all right. Good night.
[time=526] God is going to get you for that.
[time=551] [MUSIC]
[time=559] Sylvia, I'm taking the afternoon off for a round of golf.
[time=562] If my wife calls, tell her I can't have lunch with her today, tell her I am in an important meeting with the boss.
[time=569] And if the boss calls, tell him I'm out with TJ Williams.
[time=573] He's one of our biggest clients.
[time=576] And if TJ Williams should call, tell him I'm having lunch with my wife.
[time=581] Pretty clever, huh?
[time=584] No, Sylvia, I am not asking you to lie for me.
[time=588] As your boss, I'm ordering you to lie for me.
[time=593] Yes, I know this is the fourth time this week I've broken a lunch date with my wife.
[time=598] That's just as well.
[time=599] She could stand to lose a few pounds as it is.
[time=602] But two weeks in April, whatever for?
[time=609] Oh, I am sorry, Sylvia.
[time=611] Have your baby on your own time, not mine.
[time=614] Well, goodbye, Sylvia.
[time=615] Have a good day.
[time=617] God will get you.
[time=618] No, no, not again.
[time=619] Don't say it.
[time=620] Look, I'll change.
[time=621] I promise.
[time=622] I'll be good from now on.
[time=624] Sylvia, I've just reconsidered.
[time=627] Take two weeks in April.
[time=629] Take two months in April.
[time=631] Matter of fact, why don't you take the rest of the day off today with pay?
[time=635] I'll hand all my own calls.
[time=638] God will get you for that.
[time=658] All right!
[time=659] Yes?
[time=660] If you're going to get me, God, get me now.
[time=663] Go ahead.
[time=664] Throw down the thunderbolts, the fire and brimstone.
[time=666] I deserve it.
[time=672] Come on, God.
[time=673] What's taking you so long?
[time=674] Go ahead.
[time=675] I'm an easy target.
[time=679] What?
[time=682] You're not.
[time=685] You didn't?
[time=689] You won't?
[time=691] But they all...
[time=695] They're gone.
[time=698] What is this?
[time=703] Wow, this is some fancy slate.
[time=706] Who does this belong to?
[time=707] Billy Graham?
[time=710] Come again?
[time=712] Me?
[time=714] Oh, no, God.
[time=715] There must be some mistake.
[time=716] My slate has thousands of marks on it.
[time=719] I've let you down every day of my life.
[time=724] You say your son cleaned it up for me?
[time=728] Jesus?
[time=730] Just to prove how gracious you are.
[time=734] You sure did a good job.
[time=736] Look at that.
[time=737] Not even a streak.
[time=740] Are you sure this is mine?
[time=743] What do you mean I don't have to accept it?
[time=745] Of course I'll accept it.
[time=746] I'd be a fool, not to.
[time=749] I think all my life I've tried to run away from you.
[time=755] God, I'll get you for that.
[time=758] You sure got me, Lord.
[time=761] You got me wondering why I didn't turn to you a long time ago.
[time=771] I died for you.
[time=775] I'd do it all again with a hat to show you what you really mean to me.
[time=786] I cried for you.
[time=789] I hung on the cross so you wouldn't have to.
[time=793] I made a way to set your spirit free.
[time=799] That's how much I love you.
[time=803] That's how much I want you to do.
[time=807] I gave up my own life that you want my love.
[time=814] That's how much I love you.
[time=818] That's how much I want you to see.
[time=821] That you will look so good.
[time=823] You drew me so much to you.
[time=828] I gave you the stars.
[time=832] The sun, oh yes, I went to that far.
[time=836] So no matter where you go, you think of me.
[time=842] The mountains bear.
[time=846] The beautiful oceans are there to remind you that I can say goodbye for you.
[time=856] That's how much I love you.
[time=860] That's how much I want you to do.
[time=864] That I gave up my own life that you want my love.
[time=871] That's how much I love you.
[time=875] That's how much I want you to see.
[time=878] That you are my child and you leave so much to me.
[time=886] That's how much I love you.
[time=896] That's how much I want you to see.
[time=906] That you are my child and you leave so much to me.
[time=928] One of the things that I like observing in other people is that thing called human ingenuity.
[time=935] The can do spirit, the indomitable spirit, the person comes up against unbelievable odds or obstacles and somehow they reach deep down inside.
[time=945] They bring all the resources that they are and have to bear on the problem and they come up with a solution.
[time=950] I love it. I love to watch it.
[time=952] Dr. Alexander Calendre, who's a professor at the University of Washington, actually in St. Louis, wrote a book called The Teaching of Science and Mathematics.
[time=962] And in it, he tells a story that I love because of this thing, human ingenuity, goes this way.
[time=970] Some time ago I received a call from a colleague who asked if I would be the referee on the grading of an examination question.
[time=978] He was about to give a student a zero for his answer to a physics question while the student claimed he should receive a perfect score in wood if the system weren't set up against him.
[time=989] The instructor and the student agreed to an impartial arbiter that I was selected.
[time=994] I went to my colleague's office and I read the examination question.
[time=998] Show how it is possible to determine the height of a tall building with the aid of a barometer.
[time=1005] The student had answered, take the barometer to the top of the building, attach a long rope to it, lower the barometer to the street, then bring it up and measure the length of the rope and the length of the rope is the height of the building.
[time=1018] I pointed out that the student had a strong case for full credit since he had arrived at the right answer.
[time=1025] On the other hand, if full credit were given, it could well contribute to a high grade for the student in his physics course.
[time=1032] A high grade in physics is supposed to certify competence in physics, but the answer didn't confirm this.
[time=1039] So I suggested that the student have another try at answering the question. I was not surprised that my colleague agreed. I was surprised that the student did.
[time=1048] I gave the student six minutes to answer the question with the warning that his answer should show some knowledge of physics.
[time=1056] At the end of five minutes, he hadn't written anything. I asked if he wanted to give up.
[time=1061] The student said, "No, I have many answers to this problem. I'm just thinking of the best one."
[time=1067] I excuse myself for interrupting him and asked him to go on, and in the next minute he dashed off his answer, which read,
[time=1073] "Take the barometer to the top of the building and lean over the edge of the roof. Drop the barometer, timing its fall with a stopwatch."
[time=1082] Then using the formula, S equals one half the power of two, calculate the height of the building.
[time=1088] At this point, I asked my colleague if he would give up. He conceded and gave the student almost full credit.
[time=1094] In leaving my colleague's office, I recalled the student that said he had other answers to the problem, so I asked him what they were.
[time=1100] Oh, said the student. There are many ways of getting the height of a tall building with the aid of a barometer.
[time=1105] For example, you could take the barometer out on a sunny day and measure the height of the barometer and the length of its shadow.
[time=1111] Then measure the length of the shadow of the building and by the use of simple proportion, determine the height of the building.
[time=1117] Or, he said, if you want a more sophisticated method, you could tie a barometer to the end of a string, swing the barometer, use it as a pendulum,
[time=1125] and determine the value of G at street level, and then at the top of the building, and from the difference of the two values of G, the height of the building can't, in principle, be calculated.
[time=1134] But, he said, there's a very basic method that you would like. In this method, you take the barometer and begin to walk up the stairs.
[time=1143] As you climb the stairs, you mark off the length of the barometer along the wall with a pencil.
[time=1149] When you get to the top, you then go all the way back down, counting the number of pencil marks, and that will give you the height of the building and barometer units.
[time=1157] Finally, he said, there are many other ways of solving the problem.
[time=1163] But the best way is to take the barometer to the basement and knock on the building superintendent's door.
[time=1171] When the superintendent answers, you say to him as follows, Mr. Superintendent, here I have a fine barometer.
[time=1181] Tell me how tall this building is and I'll get it to you.
[time=1184] Oh, I love that.
[time=1193] Human ingenuity. It's an amazing thing. The power of the human mind, the will and the spirit.
[time=1198] They come together, they get confronted with a problem, and suddenly they find solutions, sometimes many solutions.
[time=1203] We used to have a communication problem. It used to have to get in the immediate proximity of another person to communicate with them.
[time=1210] It took a lot of time, it was very expensive, and you needed to talk to a whole bunch of people in a matter of few minutes, and you couldn't do it traveling on location to talk to them.
[time=1218] So a guy by the name of Alexander Bell came up with a thing called a telephone solution.
[time=1224] Transportation problem. Somebody came up with this idea of a car, so we didn't have to ride horses and buggies everywhere.
[time=1231] We went, the problem was they were too expensive, only the very rich could afford them.
[time=1235] So a guy by the name of Henry Ford comes up with this thing called an assembly line and figures out how to make thousands and thousands and thousands of them
[time=1243] for a fraction of the cost, and we all got cars.
[time=1247] Now you take this can-do spirit.
[time=1250] You take this human ingenuity and this hard work ethic and apply it to trying to solve the God problem.
[time=1257] Not the communication problem, not the transportation problem, but the God problem, and you come up with a thing we call religion.
[time=1265] Religion.
[time=1267] Religion, it comes under different names, different branches, different banners, but religion basically says this.
[time=1275] I can get to God.
[time=1278] I can clean up my life.
[time=1280] I can change this or that.
[time=1282] I can treat people better.
[time=1284] Somehow, someway, you present the problem, getting to God.
[time=1288] I'll use my human ingenuity.
[time=1290] I'll come up with a whole bunch of different kinds of religions throughout time and in different places of the world.
[time=1295] And we will solve our God problem.
[time=1297] We will get to God.
[time=1298] That's why I spell religion with two letters.
[time=1301] D-O. Religion is all about do.
[time=1305] Religion is all about doing this and doing this and doing that and doing the other thing.
[time=1310] Religion is all about not doing this and not doing that and not doing that.
[time=1316] I believe there is in the hearts and minds of many people a scale of sorts and they see their life works and they try to figure out a way to get their good works to outweigh their bad works.
[time=1327] And they're doing, doing, doing, doing in the process.
[time=1330] That's called religion.
[time=1333] Religion is man's effort, man's attempt to solve the God problem.
[time=1342] Now the Bible reveals a completely different reality.
[time=1348] The Bible says that in fact it is not what you do.
[time=1354] There is a different way to solve the God problem and it goes against our grain.
[time=1360] When the Bible says there's a different way to solve the God problem than with our own human ingenuity and our own hard work it goes against our grain because we've been raised to in many ways we have the benefits of human ingenuity.
[time=1372] What do you mean it doesn't work when it comes to getting to God and solving the God problem?
[time=1377] Well Christianity says this, that Christ has solved the God problem for us.
[time=1385] Christianity says that our efforts will never be enough.
[time=1390] Our own human ingenuity and work ethic will never be enough to solve the God problem.
[time=1395] And you and I both know that there are limits as wonderful and as splendid as human ingenuity is.
[time=1400] We know there are limits to human ingenuity.
[time=1402] If you don't think so ask the people who were on the Titanic that night.
[time=1406] It was proclaimed as the unsinkable ship.
[time=1408] They were so confident that they had engineered a ship that was so unsinkable.
[time=1413] We all know they did not even put on enough lifeboats to cover the number of people.
[time=1419] That and a zillion other examples will show us and remind us again of the painful truth that human ingenuity has limitations.
[time=1429] Now I spell Christianity entirely different than I spell religion. I spell Christianity D-O-N-E, done.
[time=1437] And herein is the chasm of difference between religion and Christianity.
[time=1443] Christianity isn't about what you and I are going to do to solve our God problem.
[time=1448] Christianity is about what God has already done to solve the God problem for us.
[time=1455] God recognizes the limitations of human ingenuity.
[time=1458] He recognizes we'll never in our own power and strength be able to solve the God problem.
[time=1463] So because he loves us he solves it for us.
[time=1466] Visa V done. Christianity.
[time=1469] The word of God says that the work involved in coming up with solutions to the God problem has already been done.
[time=1477] And it isn't about balancing the works in our life trying to get the good to outweigh the bad.
[time=1484] It's about the cross.
[time=1487] If the image of religion is a set of scales the image of Christianity is a cross.
[time=1496] Why a cross? Because it is on the cross that the work was done by God himself to solve our God problem.
[time=1507] It's an amazing truth.
[time=1509] And you know what? Believe it or not the Bible from cover to cover says that.
[time=1515] We could go to any book in the Bible and you will find these truths from cover to cover.
[time=1520] The Bible says the human achievement is it's good in its own place.
[time=1525] But when it comes to solving the God problem it is inadequate.
[time=1529] And Christ is the answer.
[time=1532] Now I don't have time this morning to teach the entire Bible obviously.
[time=1536] It just so happens that as a church we're studying through the book of 1 Peter.
[time=1541] And we come this morning to one verse which better encapsulates the teaching of the whole word of God on salvation than any other verse I know of.
[time=1551] You can find it in 1 Peter chapter 3 verse 18.
[time=1554] If you don't have a Bible with you we'll put it up on the screen.
[time=1557] This is like the distilled condensed truth about how the God problem gets truly solved.
[time=1565] It says this.
[time=1567] For Christ also died for sins once for all.
[time=1572] The just for the unjust.
[time=1574] In order that Christ or He that Christ might bring us to God.
[time=1579] Christ having been put to death in the flesh was made alive in the Spirit.
[time=1584] Now out of this very verse this is all I have time to teach this morning.
[time=1588] Out of this one single solitary verse I want to try to explain it.
[time=1592] So I'm going to give you five building blocks of salvation.
[time=1595] There are five cardinal truths about how to solve the God problem in our lives.
[time=1603] We'll just walk through them here.
[time=1604] Number one Christ died for sin.
[time=1608] Christ died for sin.
[time=1609] Now this is where religion misses it more dramatically than any other place.
[time=1613] Religion misunderstands the truth of God's word because when it comes to sin religion is continually
[time=1621] minimizing or trivializing or underestimating the impact of sin upon our own souls and the
[time=1631] holiness of God.
[time=1634] Religion says that that chasm because of our sin can be spanned through human effort and it
[time=1641] reveals a catastrophic underestimation of the damage that sin does to our relationship
[time=1650] with God.
[time=1651] The Bible clearly says we're born sinful.
[time=1653] In other words we come out of the womb selfish.
[time=1656] If you have any kids you can believe the Bible is true in this one.
[time=1660] Nobody had to teach your kids to be selfish.
[time=1662] I look at my own life.
[time=1663] Nobody had to teach me to be selfish.
[time=1666] I certainly went through some events which may have accentuated my already intrinsic selfishness.
[time=1671] But I mean being selfish came very, very natural.
[time=1674] Secondly the Bible says that I then take that sinful nature that I have and I choose the sin.
[time=1681] I feel selfish.
[time=1682] I see the selfish option as I look at an interaction with another human being.
[time=1688] Then I see myself choosing my sin, choosing selfishness.
[time=1693] And the Bible says that nothing can no human effort can ever change those realities about
[time=1700] our sinfulness.
[time=1703] No amount of work, no amount of effort will ever be able to change those realities that were born sinful, that we choose sin and we can't change it.
[time=1711] In an effort to try to explain that the Bible says it this way.
[time=1715] In the Old Testament it says this, can the Ethiopian change his skin?
[time=1721] Can the leopard change his spots?
[time=1725] Then you also can do good who are accustomed to doing evil.
[time=1729] The word good, you say good, I do good.
[time=1731] I'm nice to people.
[time=1732] I give a little here.
[time=1733] I gave some of my time here.
[time=1734] I was nice when I could have been mean over there.
[time=1736] I agree.
[time=1737] We all have some level of goodness.
[time=1738] We do some good things.
[time=1740] But that's not what the Bible means.
[time=1741] The Bible isn't talking about relative.
[time=1743] You're good versus you're bad at talking about being perfect.
[time=1746] Are you perfect?
[time=1747] Are you holy?
[time=1750] No, not.
[time=1752] Can you change that?
[time=1753] Can you become perfect?
[time=1754] Can you become holy?
[time=1755] I don't know.
[time=1756] Can an Ethiopian change the color of his skin?
[time=1759] If I'm Chinese, can I change myself to Hispanic?
[time=1766] I can't.
[time=1767] My human ingenuity doesn't go that far.
[time=1771] Can a leopard, you know a leopard can do a lot of things.
[time=1773] They run fast.
[time=1774] They hunt at night.
[time=1775] Their eyes are incredibly perceptive in the middle of the night.
[time=1778] They smell.
[time=1779] They have a keen sense of smell.
[time=1781] They're enormously strength.
[time=1782] They're quick.
[time=1783] They can do amazing things.
[time=1785] They can't change their spots.
[time=1787] Leopard ingenuity can only go, "That's what God is saying.
[time=1791] Listen to me." Religion is telling you you can do it.
[time=1795] You can do it.
[time=1796] Stop this.
[time=1798] Start that.
[time=1800] Try harder.
[time=1802] Come back again.
[time=1804] Religion says you can do it.
[time=1805] God's word is this, only Christ can do it for you.
[time=1810] Only Christ can do it for you.
[time=1812] And He did it for you when He died for your sin.
[time=1816] Christ says, "I paid your debt." Christ said, "I did for you what you could not do for yourself."
[time=1824] Big day in the more household yesterday.
[time=1826] Our eldest daughter now has her driver's license.
[time=1831] She loaded up her three sisters and a cousin that we've got staying with us from California.
[time=1835] They got in our car and they left our house on the way to the mall.
[time=1839] That was a terrifying thought.
[time=1841] We did have plastic in hand at the house.
[time=1843] They did not go with them.
[time=1845] So here I am hiding our left at home with little Bobby, four-year-old Bobby.
[time=1848] And so he and I jump in the pool and we're playing and we're doing all the games we normally do in the pool.
[time=1853] And suddenly he gets us insane idea.
[time=1854] He wants to ride his bike into the pool.
[time=1858] I'm thinking, "Live and learn, bud." So I'm sitting, I'm standing in the shallow end.
[time=1864] I get his bike up there on the edge and he doesn't know how to stop his bike.
[time=1867] He doesn't know how to start his bike.
[time=1868] All he knows how to pedal his bike.
[time=1869] So we get him on his bike and I get him in the push and he gets himself pedaling and he goes around the edge and comes to the deep end and just takes this left-hand turn and goes right into the pool.
[time=1878] And he does this belly flop dive right over the top of his handlebars.
[time=1882] He comes up smiling.
[time=1883] He's liking this.
[time=1884] He wants to try that again.
[time=1885] So we load him up again.
[time=1886] This time he does the dive right into the shallow end.
[time=1890] Now he's fine.
[time=1891] Everything's okay.
[time=1892] He comes up.
[time=1893] He's thinking, "Oh man.
[time=1894] That was cool.
[time=1895] I want to do that again." He says to himself, "I'm going to get my own bike off the bottom of the shallow end now." So he swims down there.
[time=1901] He grabs a hole in the handle and there he is under water trying to swim up.
[time=1905] But it's too heavy and he's not going anywhere.
[time=1908] And I'm thinking, "What and how long he'll do that?"
[time=1917] Finally he figures it out.
[time=1920] I'm not enough for this.
[time=1922] I'm going to die trying.
[time=1925] So let's go.
[time=1927] Comes up to the surface, gets some air.
[time=1929] And then I do for him what he cannot do for himself.
[time=1934] I haul the thing out back up on the cement so he can ride it back in again.
[time=1939] You know what that's about?
[time=1942] It's exactly what God is saying.
[time=1946] He's looking at us.
[time=1947] He applauds the effort.
[time=1948] Attaboy.
[time=1949] I'm glad that you're trying to accomplish this with your life.
[time=1952] I'm glad you care about a relationship with me.
[time=1955] I'm glad you want to try to work at a relationship with me.
[time=1958] But it's beyond your abilities and if you don't let go here pretty soon you're going to die trying.
[time=1964] And that's the judgment that Kelly was talking about early today.
[time=1967] It's appointed for man to live once and then comes judgment.
[time=1969] And if you die hanging on to your self-achievement and you die hanging on to your own self-effort then it's separation from God for all of eternity.
[time=1977] God says you've got to let go of that stuff.
[time=1979] You've got to let go of that self-effort and that religious thing.
[time=1982] And you've got to come right over here to the place where you understand that Christ did for you what you could never do for yourself.
[time=1990] He says in Isaiah 1, come now.
[time=1992] This is God speaking.
[time=1993] Come now and let us reason together.
[time=1995] I love that.
[time=1996] God's saying let's sit down and talk this through.
[time=1998] Let's think this over.
[time=1999] Come now.
[time=2000] Let us reason together says the Lord.
[time=2002] Then he says this, though your sins are as scarlet, they will be made white as snow.
[time=2009] White as snow is the standard.
[time=2011] It's absolute holiness.
[time=2012] Scarlet is a red color that depicts that your fountain pen is leaking and sin is just contaminating all of your garment and you look stained by your sin and you cannot, the detergent, the effort, you cannot cleanse your own garment.
[time=2027] But God says come reason with me.
[time=2030] Don't you understand?
[time=2031] I am the one.
[time=2034] Though your sins are as scarlet, they will be as white as snow.
[time=2039] We sing a hymn about it in Christianity.
[time=2041] It's called what can wash away my sin?
[time=2044] What can wash away my sin?
[time=2046] And the verse doesn't go human achievement.
[time=2051] The verse goes what can wash away my sin?
[time=2054] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[time=2060] Can cleanse me from my sin.
[time=2062] That's the first building block there.
[time=2064] The second one.
[time=2066] The second one, the verse goes this way, for Christ also died for sins, I love this little phrase, once for all.
[time=2073] Once for all, wouldn't that be great?
[time=2075] How would you like to pay your electrical bill for the last time in your life?
[time=2078] I mean, this month you write that check out, you mail it on in and that's it.
[time=2082] Once and for all, you can continue to use electricity the rest of your life as much as you want.
[time=2087] Wouldn't that be great?
[time=2088] Your gas bill.
[time=2089] Write it up, send it in, pay it off, and no more gas bills ever again, grocery store bill.
[time=2097] Go to Scots, pay that thing, and they say to you, that's it?
[time=2101] Once for all, come back as many times as you need to come back, get whatever you need, load it up, no more bills.
[time=2111] Jesus says, hey, you know what?
[time=2113] I died for your sins, and I paid your debt in full.
[time=2118] And He means to say once and for all.
[time=2122] This is why it's so cool.
[time=2124] See, religion, religion, you climb your way up and you try to get close to God, you try to become acceptable to God.
[time=2131] Then you have a bad day, then you have a bad week, you commit sin, you fall away, you get angry at God, something goes wrong in your life, and all of a sudden you're sliding back down this huge hill, you were trying to climb to get up to God.
[time=2143] And where are you?
[time=2144] You've got to start all over again.
[time=2146] The first truth tells you the hill never gets there.
[time=2148] You're not strong enough, you're not able even to do it, but why spend the rest of your life trying to try and try and try?
[time=2155] Christianity says, hey, Christ paid the debt you couldn't pay.
[time=2159] He paid it so well.
[time=2162] When God solves the God problem in your life, He solves it forever.
[time=2166] Once for all, it's paid.
[time=2169] Now that's an amazing benefit.
[time=2172] It's hard for us to believe that.
[time=2175] So God makes these incredible promises.
[time=2178] Listen to this one.
[time=2179] This is the amnesia promise.
[time=2181] It comes out of Jeremiah 31.
[time=2183] He says, I will forgive their iniquity and their sin, I will remember no more.
[time=2188] In other words, not only will I forgive you, but I'll forget that you sinned.
[time=2194] So 10 years from now, you accept Christ today.
[time=2196] You come to Christ today, you give the religion thing a break, and you step in to the death and the resurrection of Christ.
[time=2203] God saved me, not a do thing anymore, a done thing, what Christ did for me.
[time=2207] 10 years from now, you're thinking to yourself, well, am I going to be okay?
[time=2212] Somebody asked God about my sinful life in the last 10 years since I even got saved.
[time=2216] All the things I did wrong still.
[time=2219] God says out there, I'll make a promise to you right now.
[time=2222] I'll promise right now.
[time=2223] Not only will I forgive you for every single sin you ever commit the rest of your life, I'll forget you ever did it.
[time=2228] It'll be gone.
[time=2230] He makes the East West promise.
[time=2234] This says this.
[time=2235] So far as the East is from the West, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.
[time=2241] And so you get this mental picture of a straight line, and your sins go off there to the East, and you go off there to the West, and you never stop going in those two opposite directions.
[time=2254] And so the longer it is, the farther it is from you.
[time=2258] He makes a deep sea promise, Micah 7.
[time=2261] I will cast their sins in the depths of the sea.
[time=2264] He was writing 2,000 years ago.
[time=2266] He wasn't writing the people who looked with telescopes into the knowing that the space goes farther away from us than the ocean.
[time=2273] I mean, 2,000 years ago, nobody had ever gone underneath the ocean.
[time=2276] Whatever they dropped in the ocean, poof!
[time=2278] It was gone.
[time=2279] They had no sonar.
[time=2280] They had no retrieval devices.
[time=2282] I mean, you're out there in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
[time=2284] You dropped something.
[time=2285] It's gone forever.
[time=2286] That's the point.
[time=2288] God is saying, "Look, you know something.
[time=2290] What Christ did for you there in the cross, He did it once and for all.
[time=2295] The issue is over.
[time=2298] Forgiveness." Now, number three, and this is beautiful.
[time=2303] This is the heart of the matter, right here.
[time=2306] For Christ also died for sins.
[time=2308] That's number one.
[time=2309] Number two, He died for sins once for all.
[time=2312] Number three, the just for the unjust.
[time=2316] The just for the unjust.
[time=2319] Jesus is the just.
[time=2321] You and I are the unjust.
[time=2323] The just died for the sins of the unjust.
[time=2327] You say, "Well," people say, "What gave Jesus the right to die for everybody else's sins?" I mean, why couldn't Muhammad do that?
[time=2336] Why couldn't Confucius do that?
[time=2338] Why couldn't somebody else do that?
[time=2340] The answer is very, very clear.
[time=2343] Jesus is the only one in history who has a record of no sin.
[time=2349] Jesus as the Son of God, God in the flesh, lived a perfect life.
[time=2355] He never violated the golden rule.
[time=2357] He never violated any one of all of the stuff that God ever taught.
[time=2362] He lived a perfect, holy life because He was God in human flesh.
[time=2367] And so Christ stands as the only person in all of history who is just and therefore is able to die for the unjust.
[time=2378] Suppose I go crazy.
[time=2381] Suppose I have one of these problems like these things you read about in the newspaper, normal guy gets his gun, goes down to where he works and shoots everybody he sees.
[time=2388] They arrest me.
[time=2390] They convict me, justly.
[time=2393] They sentenced me to a life of imprisonment.
[time=2397] Ten years into my deal.
[time=2399] I contract this unusual disease which can be treated successfully but only treated in this certain hospital.
[time=2407] I appear before the judge.
[time=2409] I say judge.
[time=2410] I'd like to live.
[time=2411] I know I'm in prison for my life but I'd like to see the rest of my life.
[time=2413] Is there any way you could let me out and go have this treatment?
[time=2418] Now this wouldn't happen but go with me here for a minute.
[time=2420] The judge says yes but society has a debt.
[time=2423] Somebody has to pay the debt.
[time=2424] Somebody has to be in that cell when you're out there getting that treatment.
[time=2427] Now who are we going to find to pay that debt for you?
[time=2432] Timothy McVase, that's something I'll cover it.
[time=2436] The judge says what do you mean?
[time=2438] You already owe for your own murders.
[time=2442] You can't pay for Russell's murders.
[time=2445] You have to pay for your own murders, right?
[time=2449] In order for somebody to stand in for somebody else they have to not have their own debt to pay otherwise they're just paying their own debt.
[time=2457] That's why Christ is the only one who can pay for the debt of our sin
[time=2463] because he is the only one who never sinned.
[time=2466] He doesn't have his own debt to pay.
[time=2469] That's why Acts 4 says this.
[time=2471] There is salvation in no one else.
[time=2474] For there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must be saved.
[time=2480] Buddha had his own sin problem to pay for before God.
[time=2484] Muhammad has his own sin problem to deal with.
[time=2488] I have my own.
[time=2489] You have your own.
[time=2490] Jesus was the just dying for the unjust.
[time=2495] I hope you understand that that is so critical.
[time=2499] When Jesus was born of a virgin there, Jesus was born of a virgin there into the world through Mary.
[time=2506] That was God coming and taking the form of human flesh to live an absolutely sinless perfect life so that as the just, as holy, he could die for those of us who were unholy.
[time=2520] Principle number four, building block number four.
[time=2523] So here it comes.
[time=2524] Number one, Christ died for sins.
[time=2526] Number two, he did it once for all.
[time=2528] Number three, he was the just dying for the unjust and now you say, well, why did he do that?
[time=2534] It's the obvious.
[time=2535] Number four, that he might bring us to God.
[time=2539] Let me show it to you up here on the screen that he might bring us to God.
[time=2542] We got the two of us.
[time=2543] We got us and we got God.
[time=2545] There we are.
[time=2546] Problem.
[time=2548] We're born sinful and then we choose to sin and so our sin creates a barrier between us and God.
[time=2555] And here we are separated.
[time=2557] Here we are unable to be in real life.
[time=2560] We got a God problem on our hands.
[time=2562] We feel the guilt.
[time=2563] We feel the shame.
[time=2564] We feel the separation.
[time=2565] We don't feel the sense that we're together with God like we long to be in our hearts.
[time=2570] So we try it through religion, human achievement.
[time=2573] We try to make efforts to leap the chasm, to span the distance through our human ingenuity,
[time=2579] through our resolve, through our promises to do better, over and over and over again, and all it ever leads us to is death because we are unable.
[time=2588] You've got to let go down there, buddy.
[time=2590] You're not able to do that one.
[time=2593] So Christ died for sins.
[time=2595] Look here.
[time=2596] See the cross.
[time=2598] And when you have the cross, then you have a way across the chasm to God.
[time=2603] That is clear and simple.
[time=2606] You don't have to die.
[time=2607] You don't have to go to hell.
[time=2608] You don't have to spend eternity separated because Christ, his death provides a way across to span the distance created by our sin.
[time=2619] It's a tremendous truth.
[time=2621] That's why Christ died.
[time=2624] That's why Christ died for sins.
[time=2627] That's why I did it once for all.
[time=2629] That's why as the just, he's willing to die for us as the unjust because God longs to be back in relationship with us.
[time=2636] And the only way it can be done is through Christ.
[time=2639] Jesus said that himself.
[time=2640] He said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life." I, Jesus said, "I am." You can see why.
[time=2645] I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[time=2648] No man comes to the Father but by me.
[time=2652] The fifth.
[time=2654] The fifth truth.
[time=2655] The fifth building block.
[time=2656] The fifth principle about salvation.
[time=2658] This is so rich.
[time=2660] Look at it at the Universe 18.
[time=2662] It says that Christ, having been put to death in the flesh, was made alive in the Spirit.
[time=2668] It was, that mean.
[time=2669] Well, you know and I know that Christ died through crucifixion at the hands of Roman soldiers.
[time=2676] He was put to death in the flesh.
[time=2678] But what happened three days later is that he was raised from the dead.
[time=2682] He came back from the dead.
[time=2685] Now my friends, this is the greatest event in all of history.
[time=2689] It's bigger than landing on the moon.
[time=2692] It's bigger than the invention of the telephone.
[time=2694] It's bigger than the invention of an assembly line.
[time=2696] This is the pivotal point in all of history.
[time=2699] A man came and said he was God to die for our sins.
[time=2703] And people looked at him like he was nuts.
[time=2705] Oh yeah, you're God.
[time=2707] Well, who am I?
[time=2709] Superman?
[time=2711] He says, "No, I'm God honest.
[time=2712] I'm God.
[time=2713] I'm not one of these nuts.
[time=2714] I'll show you I'm God.
[time=2715] I'll do miracles.
[time=2716] I'll heal this person and I'll heal that person and I'll heal that person.
[time=2719] I'll do things that no human being can do to help you believe that I am truly God.
[time=2724] God come to save you from your sins." Then he did all those miracles and thousands and thousands of people saw them.
[time=2730] But he said, "The ultimate proof to you that I am the true and living God is that I will die
[time=2736] and three days later I'll come back and I'll be alive." Well, good Friday.
[time=2742] We celebrate good Friday.
[time=2744] That's when Jesus died.
[time=2746] And then Easter Resurrection.
[time=2748] That's when three days, Jesus came back from the grave.
[time=2751] And it is, this is hard to believe I know, but it is one of the most documented events
[time=2758] in all of history.
[time=2759] When you study historicity, did an event really happen?
[time=2762] Did Columbus really discover America?
[time=2766] There is more historical evidence that Christ lived, predicted he would die, died, and rose
[time=2773] from the grave as he said he would, than there is proof that Christopher Columbus discovered
[time=2780] the terra firmer we call America.
[time=2785] It's an amazing thing.
[time=2788] He is alive as he said he would be, which means we get to walk with Christ.
[time=2793] We get to love Christ.
[time=2794] Christ loves us.
[time=2795] It's a dynamic relationship day in and day out as we await finally we get to go to Heaven
[time=2801] where he is.
[time=2802] So there you have it.
[time=2804] Five building blocks out of 1 Peter chapter 3 verse 18.
[time=2807] Number one, Christ died for sins.
[time=2809] Number two, he died for sins once and for all.
[time=2811] It was the just for the unjust.
[time=2813] Why do you do it?
[time=2814] To bring us to God?
[time=2815] Where is he now?
[time=2816] He's alive.
[time=2818] Risen?
[time=2820] You said I don't believe it.
[time=2822] Too good to be true.
[time=2824] I like my work ethic.
[time=2825] I think people only should get what they deserve.
[time=2829] I want to try to work my way to Heaven.
[time=2832] I don't, this is hocus pocus.
[time=2833] It sounds too good to be true.
[time=2836] Okay, maybe, maybe not.
[time=2839] Suppose you had a 25 year old son.
[time=2843] You live in Washington.
[time=2844] He lives in Arizona.
[time=2847] You're concerned about him because he's had a problem with drugs in the past, but he's pretty much gotten things straightened away.
[time=2852] He's in Phoenix now.
[time=2853] He's running a little computer analyzing business out of his apartment there.
[time=2857] And you're hopeful.
[time=2861] Suddenly he stops calling.
[time=2863] You return the calls.
[time=2865] For a long time the just rings, rings, rings pretty soon it's disconnected.
[time=2868] You write a letter.
[time=2870] You write a second letter.
[time=2871] They don't return.
[time=2872] Finally they start coming back and the post office writes vacant, vacant on the return.
[time=2879] And you believe your worst fears have come true.
[time=2883] Your son has dove into the drug culture.
[time=2890] What would you do?
[time=2893] Just ask yourself, what would you do?
[time=2896] Would you stay in Seattle?
[time=2898] Would you say, "Oops, hope I hear from him someday." What was she?
[time=2904] Her son dropped off the face of the earth.
[time=2908] She has his really highest drugs.
[time=2911] No, you wouldn't.
[time=2913] You do just what this lady did.
[time=2914] Her name is Michelle Moore, M-O-H-R.
[time=2917] She spells it wrong.
[time=2919] Newsweek August 18, 1997, just this most recent edition.
[time=2923] The article is entitled "The Seamier Side of Life." She says this.
[time=2929] "For the past three years I found myself standing toe to toe with the denizens of the drug underworld.
[time=2935] My son Jeff vanished from his home in Phoenix, Arizona just before his 25th birthday.
[time=2940] He was a drug user.
[time=2941] Here it is.
[time=2942] And I went looking for him.
[time=2946] One step led to the next.
[time=2948] Each person would expand our search by suggesting new places to look.
[time=2952] Those who trusted us gave us addresses of crack houses.
[time=2955] Others would either clam up or show us their weapons.
[time=2958] We never tested their threats.
[time=2960] We would just quietly say thanks and leave.
[time=2962] One pool hall in El Cajon, California.
[time=2966] Her search led into the San Diego area.
[time=2970] One pool hall there, fronted for a shooting gallery.
[time=2973] The film seemed to ooze from the walls.
[time=2976] Stales cigarette smells, coupled with the long time unwashed bodies of the inhabitants, assaulted us as we walked in.
[time=2983] I spoke with a young girl who thought she had seen Jeff the week before.
[time=2986] As we talked, she began to weep, putting her arms around me.
[time=2989] She said, "I wish my mom would come looking for me.
[time=2992] I really hope you find your son." It took seven trips and all.
[time=2997] Vicki, her best friend, came with me on three occasions.
[time=3001] I moved as far into the drug underworld as I could get, even dressing as a bag lady to search for Jeff in homeless communes.
[time=3010] I'd work, save money, take a trip, return home and start the process again.
[time=3015] I'd work, save money, take a trip.
[time=3018] Finally, my efforts paid off.
[time=3020] Years of searching the streets taught me well.
[time=3023] Jeff was buried deep in the drug life, but I eventually managed to get a message to my son.
[time=3029] By this time, I had no money, so my friends raised funds for me to leave for Phoenix.
[time=3034] That's actually where he had migrated back to the next day.
[time=3037] Jeff rode 10 miles on his bike in 106 degree heat to reach me.
[time=3041] We leapt into each other's arms.
[time=3043] He was thin.
[time=3044] He had recently been beaten up and his teeth were badly needing repair, but he was alive.
[time=3050] He had been trying to leave the drug life for about a year.
[time=3054] Jeff is now back home with me, cleaning our clean, working, attending narcotics anonymous
[time=3060] and hoping to help others walk out of the darkness of the life he worked so hard to leave behind.
[time=3066] We've both learned a lot through this.
[time=3068] For me, it's simple.
[time=3070] Enough love can move mountains, create miracles.
[time=3076] Is it really so hard to believe?
[time=3079] Is it really so hard to believe that the God of Heaven, the one who created you, looks down and sees you lost?
[time=3087] Not in the drug world, the sin world, the world of sin.
[time=3092] Do you expect him to stay up there in Heaven and just have a twinge of remorse over what is happening in your life,
[time=3099] the suffering and the pain and the loneliness and the desperate result of all of it?
[time=3104] Eternal separation in hell?
[time=3106] No way.
[time=3107] He didn't dress like a bag lady, he dressed like a human being.
[time=3112] He entered our culture.
[time=3113] He went deep into our culture to find us, and he is this morning trying to send a message of grace to you.
[time=3125] He's saying, "I want to give you a clean slate.
[time=3128] My son has paid the debt, won't you please accept it?"
[time=3136] In closing this morning, I just want to say there are typically three kinds of responses to this truth.
[time=3142] One response is, "Well, I've already accepted Christ, and I guess I'm in that category.
[time=3148] In fact, I am in that category.
[time=3149] I have accepted Christ, and I am done with religion.
[time=3151] I don't believe that I can earn the pleasure of God.
[time=3153] I've accepted it as a free gift through Christ.
[time=3157] Many of us here today are in that camp, and I have a question for us.
[time=3161] When was the last time, and who was the last person?" We told about it.
[time=3169] Who was the last person?
[time=3171] What is their name?
[time=3172] Who are we striving for even today to tell them that their Heavenly Father loves them?
[time=3181] The second response often to the truth of this message is for people to reject it or to postpone it,
[time=3188] and I don't want to beat you up here today.
[time=3191] I just want to acknowledge that this is a category of response, and some of you are in it today.
[time=3195] You are rejecting this, or you're going to postpone your decision about it.
[time=3200] I understand that.
[time=3203] Here's one of the major things that goes on.
[time=3207] We have trouble admitting to ourselves and to God how sinful we are.
[time=3213] It's kind of a self-preservation mechanism that goes off inside of us, and when it comes time to really admit that we're this sinful and that we deserve death and that we can't achieve the pleasure of God in our own merit, we just back away from that.
[time=3227] That's just frightening to us.
[time=3230] We don't have a clear sense of our own sin before Holy God.
[time=3235] I have a suggestion for you, a prayer, really.
[time=3239] Ask God to show you how sinful you are.
[time=3243] Ask God to show you how much you need Him to save you from the world of sin.
[time=3249] I did that.
[time=3250] I prayed that very prayer about 20 years ago.
[time=3253] I was in a church and I could sense that it was right.
[time=3256] I could sense that Christ was the answer.
[time=3258] I mean, it made sense something was tugging, but I didn't commit.
[time=3261] And I went home that night and I said, "You know something, God?
[time=3264] I don't really feel the kind of, oh, maybe mentally.
[time=3268] I feel the kind of need to be saved out of my own sin that I think I need to feel before I can give my life to Christ." Then I asked him, I said, "If you're real and if Christ is real, would you show me how sinful I am?" And you know, he answered that prayer.
[time=3284] He answered that prayer.
[time=3285] My eyes opened up and I looked at my, boy, it's not like he should have needed it.
[time=3289] I mean, I should have been able to see it all on my own.
[time=3292] Doing drugs and drinking and all that stuff.
[time=3296] But you know, I can deceive myself.
[time=3298] You can deceive yourself.
[time=3299] You can mitigate it.
[time=3300] You can play it down and suddenly you don't feel like you're all that sinful because you're not as bad as so-and-so.
[time=3306] Man, sometimes we just got to pray, "Oh God, please open my eyes to my own sinfulness." There's a third reaction to this truth and that is to accept it.
[time=3317] Some of you are ready to accept Christ this morning.
[time=3320] Oh, you've heard about it before.
[time=3321] You've thought it over.
[time=3323] And for some reason, something inside of you is saying, "That's it.
[time=3326] Today's the day.
[time=3327] I'm going to give my life to Christ.
[time=3328] I am done trying to do.
[time=3331] I can't do.
[time=3332] I know me too.
[time=3333] Well, I've been trying and it's stupid.
[time=3335] I need it done for me.
[time=3338] I want to encourage you to do it.
[time=3340] Accept Christ.
[time=3342] Confess to God your sin.
[time=3344] Accept Christ as your personal Lord and Savior.
[time=3347] And watch Him transform your life for the glory of God.
[time=3351] Let me invite you to stand for a closing order prayer.
[time=3355] Heavenly Father, thank you for a chance to come into this building today and listen to music
[time=3367] and see dramas and hear somebody talk about your grace.
[time=3372] For those of us who have already accepted Christ, we want to pray this Lord.
[time=3379] Father, help us to share that good news.
[time=3384] Help us to have hearts of compassion, to take the chances, to step out and spend the time,
[time=3392] make the investment, to share the good news that your son has paid the price for people's sins.
[time=3403] For those of you this morning in the postpone or reject category, I don't want to force you to do anything and don't do this if you don't want to.
[time=3411] But if you want to pray to ask God to show you your sin,
[time=3417] follow along and I'll lead in a prayer like that.
[time=3421] God, I sense something is true here today, but I'm not ready to commit.
[time=3432] And maybe it's because I don't see me as sinful as I am.
[time=3440] And I would ask you God if that's what needs to happen.
[time=3445] Open my eyes to my sinfulness.
[time=3449] And open my eyes to Christ as the one who died for my sins, so that I can make this decision.
[time=3461] For those of you this morning who are ready to accept Christ, if you'd like to follow along in your heart, God will hear you.
[time=3468] Pray like this.
[time=3470] My Heavenly Father, I confess to you that I am a sinner.
[time=3475] And I am not able to earn your pleasure.
[time=3479] My human ingenuity is not enough.
[time=3481] I am not strong enough.
[time=3483] And I let go.
[time=3484] I let go of that whole attempt.
[time=3488] And I receive the gift of Christ.
[time=3491] I accept Christ as my Savior right here, right now, the one who died for my sins once for all.
[time=3500] Thank you for saving me, God, through your Son.
[time=3506] Heavenly Father, all of us together, wherever we are in this, we ask you to be powerful in our lives, show us the things you need to show us, and teach us the things you need to teach us.
[time=3518] Father, I love you and praise you for the person in the work of Jesus Christ and whose name we pray.
