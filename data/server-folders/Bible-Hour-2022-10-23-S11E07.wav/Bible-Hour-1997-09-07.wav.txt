[time=55] Probably one of the biggest triumphs in the boy's life isn't winning the science fair or having the most marbles.
[time=63] It's carrying on the legacy of the family business.
[time=67] It's the honor of being the next generation to serve the community.
[time=72] It's the pride and blessing of his father.
[time=76] It's the sort of thing that doesn't fit in a shoebox.

[time=84] Peter was looking at the church in persecution.
[time=89] And he came up with a list of four changes or four things that this church needed to implement or re-emphasize or recommit itself to.
[time=100] Let me read you this passage.
[time=102] 1 Peter, chapter 4, verses 7 through 11.
[time=104] He says, "The end of all things is at hand.
[time=107] Therefore be of sound, judgment, and sober spirit for the purpose of prayer." That's number one.
[time=112] Folks, I want you to pray.
[time=113] Number two is found in verse 8.
[time=115] Above all, keep fervent in your love for one another because love covers a multitude of sins.
[time=121] That's number two.
[time=122] Love each other.
[time=123] Be fervent in your love for one another.
[time=127] The third is found in verse 9.
[time=128] Be hospitable to one another without complaint.
[time=132] Number four in verse 10.
[time=134] As each one has received a special gift, employ it in serving one another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.
[time=142] Whoever speaks, let him speak as it were the utterances of God.
[time=145] Whoever serves, let him do so as by the strength which God supplies.
[time=151] So that in all things, God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belongs the glory and dominion forever and ever, amen.

[time=525] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 178 seconds]
[time=711] (gentle music)
[time=901] (gentle music) (gentle music) (gentle music) (gentle music) - That's such a beautiful song.
[time=921] And I think the people whose lives we studied this morning at a first Peter would have sung it in a whole new way.
[time=928] You know, you are my hiding place.
[time=930] You always fill my heart with songs of deliverance whenever I am afraid.
[time=935] I will trust in you.
[time=937] First Peter, chapter four, we're studying the lives of some folks who had much to fear.
[time=942] They were under heavy, heavy persecution.
[time=945] To set the scene for our message this morning, I want to ask you a couple questions.
[time=949] And the first one is this.
[time=950] If you could change the physical plant here at Blackhawk, you think about our buildings, your structure.
[time=958] If you could change four things in the physical plant dimension about our church, what four things would it be?
[time=965] Some of you might like to change the color of the carpet or some of you might like to have all brick on the outside of our building.
[time=971] Others of you might like to add a steeple to have a more traditional feel.
[time=975] Somebody else might want to stick a pipe organ in the room.
[time=977] A lot of different choices there depending upon what you're interested in.
[time=980] Now if you gave me that choice, here are the four things that I would do.
[time=983] And by the way, I don't think much about this.
[time=985] I love our facilities.
[time=986] But for the sake of this message, if I was going to change four things, the first thing I'd do is I would have us all on one side of the campus.
[time=993] I'd grab that stuff on the south side, on the north side, and I'd bring it onto this side.
[time=997] And then I would do away with that farmhouse over here on the corner of our property.
[time=1003] We'd be nice about it, but it'd just go away.
[time=1006] Then I'd take all this combined stuff from the north and this side, and I'd move us all deeper into our property.
[time=1014] We have about 23 acres here, and I'd set us much deeper in there, and we'd put the athletic field strategically and throw a lake in some trees and winding driveways and just be gorgeous.
[time=1023] I think you'd love it.
[time=1024] Trust me, I really do.
[time=1026] And then the fourth thing that I would do is I would abolish all the building debt.
[time=1032] Suddenly we would have no building debt, which would be nice.
[time=1035] I think we have a couple million in debt, which is okay.
[time=1038] I mean, these were good decisions, but we'd get rid of that.
[time=1040] Now, my second question is this.
[time=1043] If you could change four things about Blackhawk, not physical now, but spiritual, what would they be?
[time=1053] If you could change four things about us, our ministries, our hearts, our attitudes, our walk with God, whatever that component is, if you could change four things that are spiritual about this church, what four would you change?
[time=1068] Peter is writing, and he steps back for a moment, and he just looks at the church under persecution.
[time=1076] He says, "You know what?
[time=1077] Here are four things you guys need to do if you want a glorified God.
[time=1081] These are four things you need to re-establish or re-emphasize or stay with.
[time=1085] Whatever it is, he identifies four spiritual things that these churches need to do if they're going to glorify God." Let me read you the passage.
[time=1094] Chapter 4, verse 7. First Peter, chapter 4, verse 7, and following, "The end of all things is at hand, therefore be of sound judgment and sober spirit for the purpose of prayer." That's the first thing. Pray.
[time=1109] The second is found in verse 8.
[time=1111] "Above all, keep fervent in your love for one another because love covers a multitude of sins." The third one is in verse 9.
[time=1121] Be hospitable to one another without complaint.
[time=1126] And the fourth in verse 10, "As each one has received a special gift, employ it in serving one another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.
[time=1137] Whoever speaks, let him speak as it were the utterances of God.
[time=1141] Whoever serves, let him do so by the strength which God supplies, so that in all things, God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belongs the glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen." Four things that Peter says, if you want to remain strong, if you want to be a prevailing church, if you want to, as he says at the end of verse 11, give God glory through your church.
[time=1168] You all need to strengthen or you all need to get after these four things.
[time=1173] The first one is he wants him to pray.
[time=1175] Look again at verse 7.
[time=1176] And these might be called Peter's prescription for a prevailing church and they are fourfold.
[time=1181] Number one, verse 7.
[time=1182] The end of all things is at hand.
[time=1184] What he means by that is Christ is coming soon.
[time=1188] The imminent return of Christ.
[time=1190] There is nothing left on the eschatological calendar that has to happen before Christ can come again.
[time=1196] It is imminent.
[time=1197] It could happen before the service is over and we could be raptured and we could be in heaven.
[time=1201] And this whole thing called the church age could be over like that.
[time=1207] He's saying a lot of that reality.
[time=1210] I want you to be of sound judgment and sober spirit for the purpose of prayer.
[time=1214] Now when I was looking at that early in the week, I was feeling pretty bummed out.
[time=1219] I mean, sound judgment and sober spirit.
[time=1222] If you know me, you know I don't like those terms.
[time=1225] I mean, it just gave this picture of this guy walking around all day with sound.
[time=1229] Oh, I wouldn't do that.
[time=1232] You can probably do that.
[time=1233] Oh, I wouldn't do that.
[time=1234] So, you know, sound judgment and sober spirit.
[time=1237] Just walking around like some spiritual zombie all day with his entire focus on not having any fun.
[time=1244] Now thankfully, as you study the text, you'll find out it's a lot better than this.
[time=1248] What this means is it is the cool head.
[time=1252] It's a balanced mind to exercise self-control and moderation.
[time=1258] Now put it in its context.
[time=1261] People are being persecuted and it's fierce and it's severe and it's relentless.
[time=1266] And this persecution has affected every area of their life.
[time=1270] Their home life, their jobs, their financial status, their lifestyles.
[time=1276] There is no area of their life where this oppressive, dominating persecution has not negatively affected them.
[time=1283] And that gets old.
[time=1285] It gets tiresome.
[time=1287] It wears on them.
[time=1290] And they, under that kind of pressure, that mental, emotional pressure can begin to think in an unclear way.
[time=1299] They can begin to believe things that aren't true.
[time=1302] They can begin to buy into lines of reasoning just under the sheer pressure alone, which would move them out of this category of a cool head and a balanced mind to make the right kinds of choices to continue to glorify God.
[time=1319] Without this sound judgment, their minds can become somewhat irrational, lose their balance, and turn to the wrong kinds of places or solutions for comfort and encouragement, for relief from the trial or the struggle.
[time=1332] He is saying think rightly about your trial.
[time=1334] And if you remember what he already said to them, you have a living hope, not a dying hope.
[time=1339] Don't forget that.
[time=1341] Think long for the pure milk of the word and buy it, grow in respect to salvation.
[time=1346] Don't forget that.
[time=1348] Think clearly about the fact that this horrible persecution puts you in a place, 1 Peter 2, 10, to proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous life.
[time=1360] These tragedies, these hardships, they put you in an optimum position to declare the goodness of God to a lost and a dying world.
[time=1368] Verse 13, he said, "Gird your minds for action.
[time=1371] No loose thinking, no careless thinking, no wrong thinking, no sinful thinking, because what you think you will eventually become." 2.16, act as free men.
[time=1383] Remember, choose, choose for yourself what values you will give your life to.
[time=1388] Do not use your freedom as a covering for evil, but use it as a bond slave of God.
[time=1394] And so pray.
[time=1396] You beg God.
[time=1398] You get in the prayer mode with God, and you say, "Oh God, here are my thoughts, here are my values, here are my feelings." Help align them.
[time=1406] I mean, let's do battle together, God, to make sure that I continue to have a balanced, cool head in the midst of unbelievable persecution.
[time=1415] Things like submitting to the king, even though he's Nero.
[time=1417] Make that important to me, God.
[time=1420] In the battle of prayer with God, make me, God, have an honor to submit to a master who is harsh, unreasonable, and arbitrary.
[time=1427] Help me to love a husband who doesn't follow the word of God.
[time=1429] Help me to love a wife with an understanding servant's heart.
[time=1432] Help me not to return evil for evil, but give instead of blessing where evil was given.
[time=1438] These are the great battles that go on inside of prayer when people are struggling under persecution to live a godly, glorifying life for the purpose of God.
[time=1450] Now interestingly, as I was processing this in my own heart, the battle for this kind of thinking in my life is not so much against the world, and it is not so much against Satan, and it's not so much against other people.
[time=1462] This battle is fought in my heart with God.
[time=1466] It is God that I fight with for these kinds of truths to really be true in my heart.
[time=1473] Like Jacob, who wrestled with God, like Jonah, who bemoaned the evangelistic call to Nineveh, like Elijah, who sought thought of himself as all alone.
[time=1483] You see, these men did battle with God to continue to think properly about what was really going on, and to major on the majors, and to minor on the minors.
[time=1493] Peter is saying you guys want to continue in this whole thing.
[time=1495] You've got to go to prayer, and you've got to go to prayer with God, and you've got to fight for sound judgment in the sober spirit.
[time=1502] You've got to get face to face with God, and see it the way God sees it, and begin to accept it the way that God wants you to accept it, and begin to want it the way that God wants it in your life.
[time=1513] So he says, "Pray."
[time=1519] Knowing that all the end is here, you know, the end of all things.
[time=1524] I mean, this life is vapor.
[time=1525] The church age is almost over.
[time=1527] It could end in a heartbeat.
[time=1528] Why?
[time=1529] Allow yourself to forget the eternal scope of what God is doing in humanity.
[time=1536] Be of sound judgment, a sober spirit.
[time=1538] Be rehearsing and reestablishing God's truth in your mind so you maintain balance and a cool head, and pray for the help and the strength and the endurance to glorify God with your life.
[time=1550] Now, my question of application on this point to you this morning is the one I gave myself.
[time=1556] And it's this, is there any area in your life right now, whether it be a relationship with a spouse, a friend, a relationship, money, your job?
[time=1567] Is there any area in your life right now that the Holy Spirit surfaces where you are not thinking with sound judgment and a
[time=1578] sober spirit, where your mind is giving way to think things that just simply aren't true, where you begin to buy into the deceptive lies, the veneer of temptation.
[time=1593] This verse invites you to go to prayer with God and wrestle
[time=1599] with his truth and primarily with him for what you'll do about
[time=1605] that area.
[time=1608] And will you come out the other end with this commitment at the end of verse 11 to glorify God in all things glorify God through
[time=1617] Christ.
[time=1619] Number two, he says, "Love one another." As I look at you guys, I mean as I look at your church, he's saying, as I look at us in the dispersion, the persecution, the second thing we've got to be doing if we're going to stay on track here is we have got to stay fervent in our love for one another.
[time=1635] Now, as you know, loving one another is a great, it's the second greatest theme in all the word of God.
[time=1641] The first is a love God and the second is to love each other and it's everywhere.
[time=1644] It's pervasive and old and New Testament truth.
[time=1646] But Peter puts a spin on it in this verse that is especially appropriate to the people he's writing to.
[time=1652] He says, "Above all, keep fervent in your love for one another." Why?
[time=1657] Because love covers a multitude of sins.
[time=1662] Again, what's the context?
[time=1663] You've got a hurting, tired, defeated, grieving church.
[time=1668] They've been beat up by Nero and the Roman government and everybody else who wanted to jump on the persecution bandwagon and find a reason to vent whatever they were mad about at these Christians.
[time=1678] And it's natural for a group of people under that kind of heat and that kind of pressure to begin to pick at each other and complain against each other and to highlight each other's faults, to become prophets of doom about the thing called Christianity.
[time=1693] To have a defeatist attitude, anytime you're with your family and something goes wrong, you've got a flat tire and it's hot and you're stuck and you want to be somewhere else.
[time=1701] Don't you begin to feel it happen inside there?
[time=1704] That's exactly what was happening inside the church.
[time=1706] And they were sinners.
[time=1708] We're all sinners.
[time=1709] And nobody's not going to be sinning until Jesus comes back.
[time=1712] And so under this persecution, as they would sin, sometimes against each other, instead of forgiving and loving and covering the sin and staying on the same team, what they were doing was they were augmenting and accentuating and highlighting and holding all kinds of stuff in their hearts against each other.
[time=1731] Can't do that.
[time=1733] He uses a little term there, fervent in verse eight.
[time=1737] That's an athletic term.
[time=1738] And it pictures a sprinter or a horse that is in this great sprint or race.
[time=1744] And as the finish line is being approached, and if you watch this at all, you'll notice these sprinters, they begin to lean and they begin to flex and they begin to strain and they begin to reach to the outside limit of their physical abilities to win.
[time=1760] He says that's how you've got to love each other.
[time=1762] That's how you've got to cover each other's sin up.
[time=1767] You've got to be committed to finish strong in covering one another's sins through forgiveness and understanding.
[time=1776] We've got to strain to understand why that person would have done that to us from their perspective.
[time=1783] We've got to strain to understand compassion to get in their shoes so that we can forgive them for what they did to us.
[time=1793] We've got to be straining to think and hope the best about each other instead of the worst and instead of writing each other off and walking away and saying, well, I'll never have that relationship again or at least it'll never be the same.
[time=1807] That violation will never go totally unmarked in my life.
[time=1812] Peter says, no, no.
[time=1814] Use every spiritual fiber in your being to love and forgive and think the best of a Christian who has insulted or injured or been unkind or rejected or been ungracious or made you feel unwelcomed or brought hostility towards you or misjudgment or misrepresentation or mistreatment, whatever it is, whatever it is that those people, that Christian, that individual has done to you, strain, strain, lean to cover that sin, to release
[time=1843] them of the death they owe you for the injury they brought you.
[time=1848] You see, the church is full of imperfect people and we will continue to sin.
[time=1853] Blackhawk is full of sinful Christians and we will continue to violate each other on a regular basis until Christ comes back and we're either going to choose to hold grudges against each other for our sins and put little walls of separation in our hearts towards the people who have hurt us or we are going to choose to cover.
[time=1878] We're going to strain.
[time=1879] We're going to lean and we're going to cover through forgiveness.
[time=1884] The only thing that will ever allow us to rise above our own stuff, our own sin, is the covering ability of life.
[time=1897] So my question by way of application this morning, again, the same one I posed to myself and I have a little homework assignment for myself and I need to get to this week.
[time=1907] But here's the question, who in this church, I'm asking for a name now in your head, who in this church has hurt you?
[time=1918] Been unkind to you, sinned against you, treated you in a way you didn't want to be treated, failed to honor you.
[time=1927] Who in this church has injured or rejected or sinned against you
[time=1933] where you still know in your heart your harboring instead of covering?
[time=1938] That's very difficult stuff because if the pain was, if it was a hurt that really hurt then you don't want to put the person's name in there right now because you're not ready to let go.
[time=1949] But what the Word of God is saying this morning is if we're going to be a prevailing church, we're going to have to strain to
[time=1960] release that person deeply, meaningfully, in genuine stuff.
[time=1965] We've got to let that go.
[time=1967] Whatever they did, however they hurt you, whatever they said, whatever they didn't say, whatever the power they exercised over your life, you have to stop not just restraining yourself from retaliation.
[time=1976] You have to become proactive.
[time=1978] We have to be proactive and strain and work to make sure that the sin there does no more damage in our church.
[time=1986] It's covered.
[time=1989] If you get a name, if the Spirit of God prompts a name I encourage you, deal with it, go get it, write the letter, make the phone call, whatever you've got to do.
[time=2003] Number three, this third thing that Peter as he looks at the church says is you've got to be hospitable.
[time=2009] Verse nine, be hospitable to one another without complaint.
[time=2011] Now the word hospitable, literally translated means this, love strangers, love strangers.
[time=2018] If you're going to prevail, if you're going to be strong, if you're going to make it through all this stuff that Nero's throwing at you and in the end give glory to God, you're just going to have to love strangers.
[time=2029] Now in Peter's world, you've got a persecuted church.
[time=2033] And the refugee problem is everywhere.
[time=2036] People are fleeing out of Rome and they think they find a safe haven and they get more persecution in one of these outskirts cities and then they flee from there.
[time=2043] The whole Christian world in essence was on the run.
[time=2047] And when they ran, they had nowhere to turn.
[time=2050] They had no safe places and holiday inns and stuff of the day were like brothels.
[time=2055] They didn't have a reputable like chain of hotels and motels to stay at.
[time=2061] What was there were the inns and the inns by and large were drinking taverns and brothels.
[time=2066] And so travel was very difficult for the conscientious believer, not to mention all this persecution.
[time=2075] And so Peter is saying you've got to open your homes up.
[time=2080] And then he says verse nine, without complaint, which in there he understands and gives credence to the kind of things that happen to people who open their homes up.
[time=2088] We get taken advantage of.
[time=2089] The person stays too long.
[time=2091] The person's too grumpy.
[time=2092] They're ungrateful.
[time=2093] They eat too much.
[time=2094] They want the best of, you know, you know what happens to you when you open your home.
[time=2099] He encompasses that and he says be hospitable.
[time=2102] Be lovers of strangers without complaint.
[time=2106] Now the truth is my friends, we tend to love our friends.
[time=2112] Right?
[time=2115] We don't love straight.
[time=2116] Oh, we do.
[time=2117] We sing songs about it.
[time=2118] We say, but we tend to love our friends.
[time=2122] But this verse calls us to love people outside our normal cycle of friends or rather circle of friends and offer them the generous kinds of hospitality we offer to our friends.
[time=2137] Now my question this morning, and I trust you'll just not like bump this over to somebody else this morning.
[time=2144] Let this come on in.
[time=2146] When was the last time you had a stranger in your house?
[time=2156] Not a strange person.
[time=2158] You might have had me, okay?
[time=2159] That doesn't count.
[time=2160] When was the last time you had a stranger in your house?
[time=2163] I just answered that.
[time=2164] It was the last time you opened your door.
[time=2167] You were the house, the house you loved, the house God gave you, the house you said, oh God, it's so good that we just want to honor God with our house.
[time=2172] We'll raise our kids here.
[time=2173] We'll just have a godly house.
[time=2174] You know that house.
[time=2175] When was the last time you had a stranger in that house?
[time=2179] Getting the warmth and the protection or the air conditioning and the soft drinks and the food and the clean sheets.
[time=2186] When was the last time a stranger was in your home?
[time=2193] Because you know that stranger matters to God and therefore he matters to you and you love the stranger and it's what it takes to have a prevailing church.
[time=2204] That's tough in it.
[time=2206] That's really hard.
[time=2207] Maybe it was a missionary.
[time=2209] You didn't know him, but they were coming through town.
[time=2211] You heard about it from the church.
[time=2212] You took him in your house.
[time=2213] That's hospitality.
[time=2214] Maybe it was a foreign exchange student.
[time=2217] You didn't know him, but they wanted to come and you figured great, you can stay in our house because we just want to have the chance to impact you for the cause of Christ.
[time=2226] Maybe, and you don't want to church our size.
[time=2229] That could be somebody right here who you don't know.
[time=2235] And they might be new.
[time=2236] They might not be new, but what was the last time you just went over to somebody and said, hey, instead of us packing up and going home today or going to wherever we normally go to eat, which is never together.
[time=2245] Any chance for coffee this week?
[time=2247] Love to have you over.
[time=2249] Have you met anybody here at Black Hawk?
[time=2251] Have you had a chance to make any friends here at Black Hawk?
[time=2254] Oh, come on over.
[time=2256] I got a great set of friends.
[time=2259] Come on over.
[time=2261] You see, for Peter's day, it was unbelievably critical, wasn't it?
[time=2265] Because the persecution and the brothel situation and, I mean, it could be a matter of life and death for some of these people if a Christian was not hospitable.
[time=2274] But you know, in our day, it's pretty significant, isn't it?
[time=2278] Because if we're not a warm, receiving, hospitable church, and I don't mean by that we have a visitor center between these doors here.
[time=2286] I mean that our homes are going open, just as the text says, open your doors, open your home, love strangers, let them in.
[time=2293] Number four.
[time=2295] Number four is found in verse 10.
[time=2299] And verse 10 says, "As each one has received a special gift, employ it in serving one another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God." That's a complicated verse, and it's pregnant with truth.
[time=2311] Let me give you the kernel of it.
[time=2313] When it says in the middle of verse, serve one another.
[time=2317] Serve one another.
[time=2318] You see, again, in Peter's day and under this persecuted context, these people had had a ton of hardship.
[time=2325] They had suffered great loss and gone through great hardship with great difficulty and enormous inconvenience, and they were fully put out, if you will.
[time=2333] I mean, what they were ready to do now was baton down the hatches and close everybody out and stop serving everybody and say, "You know what?
[time=2341] I've had a hard go with this thing, and I'm going to take care of number one here for a little while." Peter's saying, "If you do that, if you do that, if that becomes regular, I mean there may be a place to try to recover from an especially exhausting period of your life, but I mean if this becomes your norm, if you start taking care of yourself and if you justify that by the fact that you happen to be exhausted or whatever's going on in your life, that's too hard for you.
[time=2364] Because didn't that what we say?
[time=2366] Man, if you knew how hard I had to work to make a buck, you wouldn't ask me to minister my spiritual gift to the church.
[time=2370] I'm so totally completely exhausted just trying to survive in this crazy city and raise my crazy family.
[time=2376] You expect me now to serve in the church and use my spiritual gift?
[time=2379] You've got to be nuts.
[time=2382] Well, see, there's this, like, the spiritual reversal that happens.
[time=2385] Jesus said it's when you give that you live.
[time=2387] When you give, you don't die, you live.
[time=2391] And when you use your spiritual gift, instead of coming up with a hundred reasons why you're too exhausted and you're too tired and things have been too hard, and that you say, "Instead, you know, I am exhausted, but man, I'm committed.
[time=2405] I am committed to ministering my spiritual gift to my brothers and sisters in Christ." That builds a prevailing church.
[time=2415] When the going gets tough, the tough get going is how Peter might have said this.
[time=2419] Don't clam up.
[time=2420] Don't hang on.
[time=2422] Don't just lick your wounds.
[time=2423] Don't fall into a pit of self-absorption.
[time=2426] You've got to give.
[time=2427] You've got to serve, and you've got to minister.
[time=2429] There is where your spiritual renewal will come from.
[time=2434] Then you say, "What am I going to serve?
[time=2436] What do I serve with?" Again, verse 10 says this, "As each one has received a special gift." That's the spiritual gifts that God gives us at the point of salvation, and everybody has several of them.
[time=2449] You can see in verse 11, he kind of groups them in two big categories.
[time=2453] There's the speaking category of gifts, and there's the serving category of gifts, and they interlap, and they intertwine, but they are God's unique abilities that he has given you to minister to the people that are around you in this church.
[time=2469] The only way, he is saying to them, the only way for you to be a vibrant, glorifying, God-honoring, prevailing church is if you will stay other focused, even though the persecution might lead you to an inward focus.
[time=2488] Okay, so my question this morning by way of application is very simply, "Do you know your spiritual gift?" Do you know your spiritual gift, and are you serving others with it?
[time=2499] Are you doing it?
[time=2500] Are you going the extra mile, and are you believing the word of God that says, "Even though you feel like you've got to take care of you at this point, you've got to find a way to minister your gift, and when you do you'll find there's a renewal." Not just to you, but the people around you.
[time=2515] Do you know your spiritual gift?
[time=2516] We have a ministry here called Network.
[time=2518] It's designed to help you discover your spiritual gift.
[time=2520] You can call the church office, talk to the people who run network.
[time=2524] Well, not only help you learn your spiritual gifts, but we help you find the place in our church that meets your gift package and your passion.
[time=2535] So Peter sums up in verse 11.
[time=2538] At the middle of the verse he says, "So that in all things, God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belongs to glory and dominion forever and ever." He says, "You guys, this isn't about me.
[time=2549] This isn't about Peter's glory.
[time=2551] This isn't about Peter's ability to build a church.
[time=2554] We do all this stuff because we want to bring glory and honor to God.
[time=2561] Lift him up.
[time=2562] Praise and adore him.
[time=2564] So Peter's prescription, number one, pray.
[time=2567] Do battle with God.
[time=2569] Maintain a sound judgment and a sober spirit.
[time=2572] Major on the majors.
[time=2574] Never let the stuff in your life get you thinking weak thoughts and wrong thoughts and sinful thoughts because you'll eventually become what you think.
[time=2582] Love one another, specifically in this sin category.
[time=2585] We've got to be active.
[time=2588] We've got to be hustling.
[time=2589] We've got to be moving to find ways to cover and release each other from the violations that we have.
[time=2595] We've got to be constantly giving each other clean slates.
[time=2600] We've got to be hospitable.
[time=2602] Open the doors of your house.
[time=2606] Bring a stranger in.
[time=2610] Employ your gift.
[time=2612] Serve.
[time=2614] Well, I couldn't resist the opportunity to talk about us.
[time=2624] I mean, not just like his four points.
[time=2626] In other words, I'm amazed that Peter chose those four.
[time=2630] He could have chose a different four and there's hundreds of things that he probably could have said.
[time=2635] You know, the Lord in the book of Revelation, he comes and he walks through the lampstands of the seven churches and with each church he has different things to say.
[time=2643] You want to start this.
[time=2644] You want to stop that.
[time=2645] You want to go back to your first love.
[time=2646] You want to do this.
[time=2648] Well, what would happen if Peter came and spent some time with us with all his wisdom?
[time=2655] What four things would he put on the table for us?
[time=2657] Would it be those four?
[time=2658] Or would it be a different four based upon our circumstances and our people?
[time=2663] What if Christ would come?
[time=2665] I mean, not for resurrection.
[time=2666] I mean, for, you know, rapture purposes.
[time=2669] What if he were to just come and visit with us and evaluate us and leave us with four things?
[time=2675] What would those four things be?
[time=2678] What are the things?
[time=2679] What are the four things that we ought to be about to be a prevailing church?
[time=2683] Well, fact is, Peter's not coming and Jesus isn't coming.
[time=2687] And that's not the way that the Lord wants this thing done these days.
[time=2691] He gives the church elders, spiritual men who are mature in the things of God, and it's their job to shepherd the church.
[time=2698] It's their job to look at the church and say, hey, based upon who we are in Fort Wayne, 1997, this is these are the four things.
[time=2707] So you have an insert.
[time=2708] If you take that for just a minute, I want to invite you to look at what they said.
[time=2713] Now, they did this a couple years ago.
[time=2717] They got together and they took a real careful look.
[time=2720] It's the insert that's white building a prevailing church.
[time=2723] And on the side that says the mission of Black Hawk Baptist Church, they identified four things that we ought to be about.
[time=2732] And they took into account who we were and how long we'd been in existence and what our facilities were and what our staffing was.
[time=2739] I mean, they took a look at us and they said, here's our mission, you see it there, to respond to the Word of God by four things, interestingly enough, exalting the Lord, edifying one another, number three, equipping one another, and number four, evangelizing our world.
[time=2760] If you will, turn the page over for a second.
[time=2763] You say, what do those words mean?
[time=2765] Those four Es.
[time=2766] Well, here's like a real quick definition, exaltation.
[time=2769] What they meant by that is they believe that we as a church need to give ourselves to corporate praise and preaching.
[time=2776] We need to come in here on a weekly basis and we need to give our hearts away to God, sing in these praise songs that are full of truth and full of adoration and full of theology about who God is and how we ought to respond to Him.
[time=2788] And then we as a church need to come in here and be ready to submit and respond to the preaching of His Word.
[time=2795] That's what they mean by exalt.
[time=2797] They consider that one of the four things we have got to be doing.
[time=2802] It's good to have you here doing it by the way this morning.
[time=2804] Number two, edification.
[time=2807] They mean by this authentic relationship with fellow believers.
[time=2811] They have set a course for our church that leads us to kinds of relationships where we talk about what is really going on in our lives.
[time=2819] Not the layered kind of relationship where everything is always okay and you never drop the veneer.
[time=2826] You never drop the mask, if you will.
[time=2828] You never drop your guard enough to let somebody see where you might be struggling.
[time=2832] You might be sitting.
[time=2834] You might need some help.
[time=2836] Edification.
[time=2837] The elders have chosen this word to symbolize the kind of love that Peter spoke about today in the text.
[time=2845] Number three, equipping.
[time=2847] And of course, ministry of spiritual gifts.
[time=2849] They are completely and totally committed and convinced that our church will never be a prevailing church.
[time=2854] And we will never reach the potential to glorify God until we know what our gifts are and we are happily employing them to build one another up.
[time=2863] And then, of course, evangelism.
[time=2866] And in these days, we are talking about redemptive relationships, that hospitality thing extending out there to unsaved people and letting them into our homes, letting them into our lives, letting them be a part of our day-to-day so that we can present the gospel.
[time=2887] Now, if you will, look at the question.
[time=2890] If you were to pie graph the number of hours per week that you spend engaged in these activities.
[time=2897] Now, I mean by that, of all the time in the week you're going to give to the Lord.
[time=2901] Or is that two?
[time=2902] Or is that four?
[time=2903] Is that six?
[time=2904] Is that eight?
[time=2905] I mean, how many hours a week do you give to the things of the Lord like that?
[time=2911] If you were going to pie graph the number of hours and where they would go, as they would fit under these four things, what would that look like?
[time=2921] Scott's going to come.
[time=2922] We're going to close our service in a minute by singing a song.
[time=2924] But first, I want to invite you to take some time.
[time=2927] I'm going to give you three or four or five minutes here to do this analysis of the time I give to the thing called Christianity or to the work of the Lord.
[time=2937] Where does it go?
[time=2938] Am I balanced?
[time=2940] Or am I out of balance?
[time=2942] And then if you look on the other side of the paper one last little bit over and you'll see a place for you to make a commitment.
[time=2948] And you don't hand this in.
[time=2949] This is you and the Lord.
[time=2950] Maybe you and your friend.
[time=2952] Based upon the evaluation of your life on those four Es, what do you want to start?
[time=2958] What do you want to stop?
[time=2960] What do you want to continue?
[time=2962] I mean to balance things and to do your part to build a prevailing church.
[time=2968] I really meant to have my little pie graph able for you to see.
[time=2974] I didn't get it done quite soon enough.
[time=2976] But if you were to see it, you would find that it is predominantly given to exaltation, the preaching component,
[time=2985] and equipping.
[time=2987] It's as if my whole life can be consumed in that.
[time=2991] And I have some excuses because I don't get to work with unsaved people.
[time=2995] And I'm predominantly around believers all the time.
[time=2998] And so evangelism is, that's a pretty good excuse, don't you think?
[time=3002] There's not a lot of people on my block that we really connect with as a family.
[time=3006] And that's typically been a place for evangelism for us.
[time=3008] And so that's probably a pretty good excuse.
[time=3010] The point of the matter is there's always a reason.
[time=3013] You know, there's always a reason.
[time=3015] But the little sliver here that needs to get some territory in my life that needs to broaden and balance this thing out is definitely the evangelism one.
[time=3025] And so as I flip my sheet over to what I want to stop, start, or continue, two exciting things that I feel the Lord has been driving in me and one, both in the category of evangelism.
[time=3035] One is to start a seeker small group.
[time=3039] We actually did have a little success this summer with some of our Christian friends reaching to the unsaved.
[time=3045] A couple of parties for Fourth of July and then Labor Day.
[time=3049] And we all purposed together to invite unsaved friends.
[time=3052] And there were a number of unsaved people there.
[time=3054] And a lot of us went away feeling as though the party had taken on an entirely new level of significance.
[time=3061] Because it was something more than just us.
[time=3063] It was them and it was Christ.
[time=3065] And we didn't preach and we didn't give tracks.
[time=3067] We just tried to build relationships.
[time=3069] Then the end of that would be this seeker small group.
[time=3072] And Heidi and I have purpose in our heart to make invitation to some of these people and invite them to meet every other week.
[time=3077] And we'll have some ice breakers and we'll just throw a text on the table and let them interact with what they think that's about and not try to fix them and answer all their questions.
[time=3087] Just let them explore God's word on some pretty important topics.
[time=3091] And we're hoping that God will use us to win some people to Christ through that.
[time=3095] The second thing that I feel compelled to do.
[time=3097] I'm looking forward to it is to get a little exercise thing going.
[time=3101] I got to exercise.
[time=3102] I gained too much weight if I don't.
[time=3104] And the thing that has weighed Heidi and I down in this often has been how do we add something else to our life?
[time=3111] Very, very busy.
[time=3112] Five kids.
[time=3113] How are we supposed to add a big piece of this pie called evangelism?
[time=3117] We don't know where it fits and we can be so depressed when we realize we don't know where to put it, you know?
[time=3123] One of the key principles in relational evangelism, it's not an extra thing you add to your life.
[time=3130] It is something that you incorporate in what you're already doing.
[time=3134] And that has given us liberty, vis-a-vis these parties that we would have gone to anyway through the summer.
[time=3140] That was an extra -- we just added the evangelistic components.
[time=3144] So exercise is one of the things I got to do anyway.
[time=3147] So we're getting some guys together and going to try to invite some unsaved friends and play a little hoop through the winter months.
[time=3154] And I'm very excited about that.
[time=3156] And we've already been making some contacts.
[time=3158] And people are excited.
[time=3159] They want to play.
[time=3160] They want to get together.
[time=3161] I'm talking about unsaved people.
[time=3163] Which we had time for you to come up and share the part of your pie that you got to, you know, the Lord's prompting.
[time=3168] And he's saying, "Hey, let's do a little better over here." And then what the suggestions would be.
[time=3172] This week, as I was awash in the emotions of Prince's Diet, I was sitting in Scott's office.
[time=3179] And he has a paperweight on his desk.
[time=3181] And it's a 40-year calendar.
[time=3184] It's this thing right here.
[time=3186] And you can move the dial and you can get to any year you want to go to in the next 40 years.
[time=3192] And I flipped over to 2007 and picked the date, I guess, you know, it'll be the 8th.
[time=3199] 2007, I'll be the 8th if I'm reading this thing right next time.
[time=3202] And it gives you a sense of where am I going to be 10 years from now?
[time=3206] I mean, Princess Di had no idea when she got into that Mercedes as she left the Ritz, only 36 years of age.
[time=3212] That was the end.
[time=3213] That was the last car ride she was ever going to take.
[time=3216] So much of life.
[time=3217] So much of what's going to happen to me in the next 10 years is completely and totally out of my control.
[time=3222] And it's out of your control.
[time=3224] And it can be a little scary.
[time=3226] But as I reflected on that and as I reflected on these things, our service together, you know, I can't control if I'm going to be alive or dead.
[time=3235] And I can't control whether my kids are going to be alive or dead or have cancer or do whatever is going to happen to us in the next 10 years.
[time=3240] But I can control at least these four things.
[time=3243] I mean, it is within my power to say I'm going to give myself to exalting God, right?
[time=3250] That's within our power.
[time=3252] That is our choice.
[time=3254] It is within our power to say and I'm going to be faithful to be involved deeply and meaningfully in other believers' lives for the purpose of building each other up.
[time=3263] It is within our power to say I'm going to learn my spiritual gifts.
[time=3267] I'm going to know my spiritual gifts and I'm going to use my spiritual gifts in this church to make it as all that it can be.
[time=3273] And it is within our power to say and I am going to build relationships to win people to Christ.
[time=3279] And I just have this feeling that if we give ourselves to the things that are within our power, regardless of what this brings, what this represents, all the uncertainties and all the unknowns, yeah, it really doesn't matter, does it?
[time=3293] I mean, that's beyond us.
[time=3295] We'll give ourselves to the things that we can.
[time=3298] And here's the other great truth and we'll close with this is that, you know, in these next 10 years or 20 years or 40 years or however far we're going out there, God's going to be faithful the entire time.
[time=3309] He's never going to break one promise to us.
[time=3311] He's never going to desert us.
[time=3313] He's never going to forsake us.
[time=3315] [MUSIC]
[time=3341] This is calling from the mist with temptations to resist.
[time=3354] But our lives are more than this here in this place.
[time=3362] When all is said and done, and our time has finally come,
[time=3375] what will we say for what we have done while here in this place?
[time=3387] [MUSIC]
[time=3394] Home and score is like the fields and the beautyless earth is.
[time=3406] One day with her and be still here in this place,
[time=3414] and then our every little task will be read from pages passed.
[time=3424] And only what we've done for Christ will last here in this place.
[time=3432] When all is said and done, and our time has finally come,
[time=3445] what will we say for what we have done while here in this place?
[time=3461] He lives place.
[time=3474] When all is said and done, and our time has finally come,
[time=3488] what will be said for what we have done while here in this place?
[time=3505] [MUSIC]
[time=3515] Here in this place.
