[time=30] [MUSIC]
[time=48] This is the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church. Thank you for joining us!
[time=54] Pastor Moore looks at the end of the book of 1 Peter as we continue our study this week.
[time=59] Paul finishes his letter. He gives three warnings or things that we should watch out for as Christians.
[time=64] We hope you'll stay tuned. Now let's join our service.
[time=67] [MUSIC - 467 seconds]
[time=563] I have been searching for such a long, long time and I have been missing something in my life.
[time=577] What I've lost to you pull me through.
[time=587] I found myself. I found myself in you.
[time=597] Never belonged or wanted to.
[time=611] Now I belong forever to you.
[time=619] You made me see all I can be. You put your faith in me and I have been searching for such a long time.
[time=640] And I have been missing something in my life. What I've lost to you pull me through.
[time=657] I found myself. I found myself in you.
[time=668] [MUSIC]
[time=697] I found myself in you.
[time=749] Well, if you're new to Christianity or new to the church, not necessarily this church, but the church, and you haven't heard of a guy by the name of Max Lucado and you like to read.
[time=762] I want to strongly recommend him to you. He's a tremendously gifted writer who loves God and has tremendous insights into the things of God.
[time=770] You can pick up one of his many books in any Christian bookstore in town. Max Lucado, I want to begin this morning with a quote taken from one of his books.
[time=778] God came near. And the chapter is entitled Warnings. Warnings.
[time=787] I was mad. Real mad. The kind of mad that makes your jaw ache. But I had no one to blame except myself.
[time=796] I had seen that silly light burning on the car panel for days. And for days I'd ignored it. Too busy.
[time=804] I'll take the car to the mechanic tomorrow, but tomorrow never became today.
[time=809] The light continued to burn, vainly waving red flags before my blind eyes. Something was wrong, but I had too many things to do.
[time=818] Next time I'll pay attention. I mumbled to myself. The flashlight I was waving must have looked like a dancing firefly to the oncoming traffic.
[time=828] The situation was not pretty. A cold winter night stranded on a lonely highway in rural Brazil with my daughter and pregnant wife.
[time=837] My breath became smoke as I stood on the shoulder flagging cars. I promised myself I would never ignore a warning again.
[time=846] Warnings. Red lights in life that flash us and signal us of impending danger.
[time=854] They exist in all parts of our life. Sirens scream as a marriage starts to sour.
[time=860] Alarms blare when a faith weakens. Flares go up to alert us of morals being compromised.
[time=869] They manifest themselves in a variety of ways, guilt, depression, rationalizations.
[time=875] A friend might confront, a scripture might sting, a burden might prove too heavy.
[time=880] Regardless of how they may arrive, warnings come with the same purpose, to alert, to wake us up.
[time=889] We usually know that trouble is just around the bend. Christians who have fallen away felt the fire waning long before it went out.
[time=899] Unwanted pregnancies or explosions of anger may appear to be the fruit of a moment's waywardness,
[time=905] but in reality they're usually the result of a history of ignoring warnings about an impending fire.
[time=913] If you have your Bible with you this morning, I invite you to take it and open to 1 Peter chapter 5.
[time=918] We've been studying the book of 1 Peter now for a long, long time and we're going to come to the last passage in the book this morning.
[time=926] We've skipped a passage which I'll get to in two weeks.
[time=930] We kind of skipped around a little bit because of our third Sunday.
[time=934] And the way it falls now I'll preach verses 8 through 14 this morning of chapter 5.
[time=940] And then in a couple of weeks I'll finish chapter 5 verses 1 through 7.
[time=945] But Peter is now ending his book. He's been writing to some dear Christians, some faithful believers who,
[time=952] as we have studied, have come under a kind of persecution that the world had never known prior to this.
[time=957] They've been mistreated and mocked and scorned.
[time=960] And it's as if now he's saying, you know, I've taught you so much.
[time=964] I've given you so many of the specifics of how to endure and how to face your situation.
[time=970] But before I sign off, before I end this letter, I just got to give you three warnings.
[time=976] Three kind of warnings before I just end the whole thing.
[time=980] A little bit like a parent raising their college student all the way up to the point they're going to leave for college, the cars packed, everybody's staying in the driveway.
[time=987] And it says, as if, yeah, I spent my whole life telling you things and teaching you the things.
[time=990] But before you go, three things, you know.
[time=992] Make sure you hit the books, watch out for the bad crowd and don't call if you need money.
[time=997] Three warnings. And so Peter is going to give us three warnings to these dear people.
[time=1003] Just general things. Keep this in mind now as I end my book.
[time=1007] And we'll see if it has any connection with our lives this morning.
[time=1010] Number one, morning number one is this, beware of spiritual naivety.
[time=1018] Beware of being spiritually naive. The word naive means easily fooled or gullible.
[time=1026] He says, don't be naive. Things are not as they appear.
[time=1030] Life and circumstances should never be taken at their face value.
[time=1036] There is always a moral or a spiritual agenda going on just below the surface.
[time=1045] Just below the surface of your relationships, your money choices, your recreation choices,
[time=1054] your thought choices, your emotions, your words, just below the surface of all that stuff,
[time=1060] there is a moral spiritual agenda, a raging battle going on.
[time=1066] In fact, he goes so far as to say, you are being hunted.
[time=1072] You are being stalked by the devil. Don't be spiritually naive.
[time=1080] Don't think that for one day you will live without being stalked and hunted by your adversary,
[time=1087] your adversary, the devil. Look at it in verse eight.
[time=1092] Be of sober spirit. Be on the alert.
[time=1097] Your adversary, the devil, prowls about like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour.
[time=1105] The spiritually naive pay little attention to the forces of wickedness.
[time=1110] They want to write Satan off as some mythical figure with a pitchfork and horns appointed tail.
[time=1116] They want to diminish and minimize his impact upon their daily lives.
[time=1121] Don't be spiritually naive. The scripture paints a completely different picture.
[time=1127] The scriptures tell us that the devil or Satan was originally created by God as one of the angelic hosts.
[time=1135] His name was Lucifer, and Ezekiel 28 tells us he was very unusual, exceptional.
[time=1144] He was unsurpassed in splendor and beauty. He had enormous power and capacity for ministry.
[time=1152] He was originally created holy and righteous to serve the true and living God.
[time=1158] But he chose to rebel. His heart was filled with pride.
[time=1162] And he tried to usurp the throne of God. And God cast him out of heaven.
[time=1166] And as he was cast out of heaven, the scriptures tell us he took a third of the heavenly host with him.
[time=1170] And so constitutes his demon forces.
[time=1175] And since that fateful day, the scripture tells us that he has been tirelessly opposing God's work,
[time=1183] trying to pervert God's word, hindering God's servants and snaring the wicked.
[time=1191] He has called many different things. The ruler of demons, the ruler of this world, the great dragon, a roaring lion as in our text today, the vile one, the tempter, the accuser.
[time=1204] He, as I mentioned, is unbelievably powerful, may be the most powerful of all the created beings.
[time=1212] He is, however, not omnipotent. He is highly mobile.
[time=1218] Covers territory faster than things that we understand being fast, but he is not omnipresent.
[time=1224] He is genius, brilliant, clever, but he is not omniscient.
[time=1230] In other words, he does not possess the divine attributes of being omnipotent and omnipresent and omniscient,
[time=1237] but he is way, way above and beyond outside of the normal stuff that mere mortals are made of to be sure,
[time=1245] and even of the other angelic beings.
[time=1249] Now, the picture described of him is in verse 8 of a roaring lion.
[time=1254] You see him there. Be of sober spirit, be on the alert, your adversary the devil prowls about.
[time=1262] He is in perpetual motion. He is always on the move because he can never have this thing inside of him satisfied.
[time=1270] He longs to destroy people's lives. He is like an addict, and the more he gets of destruction, the more he needs.
[time=1280] The more he committed he is to pursue it.
[time=1284] He seeks someone to devour it. It does not matter to him who anyone will do. He is not prejudiced. He is not biased.
[time=1293] He is not bigoted. He just wants to devour people, and so he is in perpetual motion.
[time=1298] He is motivated by his insatiable appetite to destroy.
[time=1303] Consequently, he is in perpetual motion, and he is characterized here with enormous strength like the lion,
[time=1311] and blinding speed, patients which never seems to wear out an unbelievable skill in acquiring what he wants.
[time=1326] You say, "How does he do it?" How does he devour people?
[time=1330] Well, this is not goblins and ghosts and little creatures that sneak up on you at night.
[time=1335] Ephesians 6 says that our struggle is not against flesh and blood. It is against rulers and powers against spiritual forces of wickedness.
[time=1343] In other words, right below the thin veneer of life, right below the surface, this demonic power, these demons and Satan himself are tirelessly at work to devour.
[time=1359] And they follow a carefully sequenced three-phase attack, a carefully sequenced three-phase attack. They begin. Satan, first of all, plays the role of tempter.
[time=1372] Satan is a master at tempting people to sin. He paints pictures. He creates images. He creates world systems. He creates cultures.
[time=1384] He sets countries in motion in such a way that the fundamental stuff of that culture, the fabric out of which that culture has been woven,
[time=1393] has the stuff to excite inside of us our lusts, the lusts of the eyes, the lusts of the flesh and the boastful pride of life.
[time=1402] He understands you. He understands me. He knows about your past. He knows about your mom and your dad and your childhood experiences
[time=1411] and your failures and your weaknesses and your insecurities and your overconfidence points. He knows everything about you.
[time=1418] And he works in ways very strategically and with enormous patience and then with blinding speed to pounce and to have success in devouring you.
[time=1428] And that all begins by being able to tempt. He will tempt you in your relationship with your spouse.
[time=1436] He will always offer you a way that is contrary to sacrificial love. He will always offer a rationale and a thought process
[time=1446] and a modus of operandi that will lead you in the contrary way to things of God, which would be to love and care for
[time=1453] and sacrifice and minister to and be strong or confront or do whatever. Whatever it would mean to be godly, he's got an alternative.
[time=1460] He's got an alternative for the hundred dollar bill you found upon the street and wondering what to do with it. He's got an alternative for your encounters with the needy.
[time=1467] He's got an alternative for your ministry in this church. He's got another way to view everything. He's got another approach
[time=1473] and it always represents sometimes subtly and sometimes overtly, but it always represents what would be contrary to the things of God.
[time=1481] So he tempts. Secondly, he deceives. The second thing he does is he deceives. And this is where I think his genius is.
[time=1493] He never really shows somebody the end result of his course. When he tempts, he does it in such a way that he masks to the best of his ability,
[time=1503] the obvious consequences that would come from living contrary to God. He helps us rationalize our selfishness. He helps us minimize the consequences of any particular behavior.
[time=1516] He never uses the same ability and the same power through media and through other mediums. He never uses the stuff at his disposable to put on display
[time=1525] the consequences of people living in contrast or contrary to the word of God. He glosses it over. He leaves that part out in your thinking and in his cultural fabric, if you will.
[time=1540] And then the third thing he does in this sequence of attack, he first tempts, he then deceives and then accuses. Once you've bought in,
[time=1549] once you've stumbled, once you've crossed over the line, once you bet on the bait, once you committed the sin and done the deed, he then begins a ministry of accusation in your life.
[time=1560] Saying things like, do you realize what a terrible thing it is that you have done? Do you realize what an awful human being you really are?
[time=1569] Do you realize how worthless you are? Do you realize how often you fall? Do you realize how tired God is of you and this whole process?
[time=1578] And it comes in very familiar terms. I've used generic terms, but he grabs the terms that really sting in your life.
[time=1590] He knows the kinds of phraseology that comes out of the painful experiences of your past. He knows how to slip the dagger of accusation deep inside your ribcage and then twist and turn.
[time=1601] He seeks to immobilize you. He seeks to separate you from hope that God can actually use you for something.
[time=1616] And so in verse 8 it says, be sober, be on the alert and then in verse 9 resist him. Resist him.
[time=1626] Be sober and be on the alert seem to say, don't be naive. There is never a moment in your life when you're not being hunted and stalked.
[time=1635] Life is not as easy as it appears. If for a moment you think that your life is about God, you and the people around you, you're naive.
[time=1645] There is a fourth component. And unless you factor it in and unless you're alert and sober enough to faithfully recognize it, you're being naive.
[time=1655] But then this other word resist. Satan has a way of attacking us through the areas that we leave unsubmitted to Christ.
[time=1670] You may give Christ 85% of your life, but reserve this one little area for yourself. Reserve this one little area of sin.
[time=1678] This one little area that somehow we justify to ourselves we deserve. We've got it under control. It'll never really do any damage.
[time=1685] I'll just keep this one for me. I don't want to give my whole life up.
[time=1690] I'll just hang on to this one little vise and I'll keep it under control.
[time=1697] It's those areas where full submission and lordship of Christ is held back that Satan is usually most successful.
[time=1707] And he wants you to forget about his existence and he wants you to feel comfortable with that area until the time is right.
[time=1718] And then he will move with blinding speed and you will find a level of devastation beyond your wildest dreams.
[time=1729] Reviewing some of my notes as I thought about spiritual warfare and such and I don't think it was too long ago that I shared this story with you.
[time=1738] And I just felt like I wanted to share it again because it's so powerful.
[time=1743] It's told by Peter Kepstik he's an internationally acclaimed author and big game hunter.
[time=1751] And his many many books in one he tells a story of a lion or a leopard.
[time=1758] As the half-breed Mazwa Bushman sat over his cigarette and beer he saw a movement from his own hut.
[time=1767] Across the shadowy compound came his son seven years old his only living child.
[time=1773] Sleepily the boy walked past the old man to relieve himself at the edge of the bush and July watched him pass.
[time=1780] Neither knew that death waited only a few feet away.
[time=1784] The big male leopard had lain flat against the cool sand for more than two hours watching the camp from the thick bush just past the first ring of deep black shadows.
[time=1798] He had seen the strange hairless baboons feeding around their fires then with much chattering going into the grass caves where they slept.
[time=1808] Only one old male had stayed in the open and the leopard sized up the best approach through the dense bush to slaughter him from behind.
[time=1819] Then the young one had come out of the cave and was walking directly stupidly right at him.
[time=1824] Without the smallest sound he bellyed to the edge of the winter-dried brush near the opening of the compound.
[time=1830] His seven feet of stealing muscles rippled hard beneath the rosetts of his glossy dappled hide.
[time=1838] His hind claws digging into the sandy earth to grip for his charge.
[time=1844] At the very edge of the light's halo the child stopped fumbling with his loin apron and at that instant the leopard burst forward from the murk a silent hurtling streak of death.
[time=1857] Quicker than thought he was on the boy.
[time=1861] The impact drove the child backward into the circle of light where with the leopard on him he turned open mouth to his father paralyzed with shock and pain.
[time=1872] Ignoring the horse screaming shout from July the big cat executed the boy with a single crushing bite at the base of the head and grabbing him with long fangs across the middle.
[time=1884] Leop back into the bush and the blackness.
[time=1894] You can't see Satan.
[time=1897] We only have awareness of the things we can see.
[time=1901] And of all the things that we can see, God said Satan is like a roaring lion.
[time=1910] This is his desire, this is his intent, this is his skill, this is his strength, this is his way with people.
[time=1919] Besides his incredible strength the leopard moves at blinding speed from close quarters and is noted for his patience, calculating intelligence, hair raising, ferocity and boldness.
[time=1928] Many natural history books claim that he is afraid of men but I don't know of a professional hunter or game officer who would agree with that.
[time=1936] He's shy, he's secretive, yes, but he's afraid of nothing.
[time=1943] Leopards frequently live very close to man's habitations, picking off a stray cow or goat, even taking a man or a child if they think they can get away with it.
[time=1954] They usually do, he says.
[time=1957] How close are you this morning to the edge of the fire? How close are you out there to the perimeter of darkness?
[time=1968] You came here this morning thinking your life was well in order, not thinking much about Satan, not thinking much about being stalked, having some area of sin quietly, neatly tucked in the little private place of your life safely under control.
[time=1982] You come here this morning to worship God. Part of what that would mean for you this morning would be to lift that secret sin out into the open and say to God, "God, this is the stuff from which opportunity is made."
[time=1996] I don't want to do an encounter with the leopard, thank you. I just assume submit.
[time=2003] So whatever I thought I had there, whatever meaning I was driving out of that, whatever I thought I had to keep my hands so tightly locked around, I submit.
[time=2014] Move back, will you this morning away from the edge of the compound? Because the text says, "You're being stalked."
[time=2026] Number two, he says, "Now, before you leave for college, beware of this second thing, beware of a thing we'll call spiritual self-pity."
[time=2035] Spiritual self-pity, look at it in verse 9, "But resist him," this is a continuation of this alarming report about being stalked by Satan, "but resist him firm in your faith," now here it comes, "knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your brethren who are in the world."
[time=2054] Spiritual self-pity is a deadly condition.
[time=2059] It's characteristic of people who believe, and that means all of us at different points in our lives, that we are a special case.
[time=2067] What God is allowing to happen to us, the amount of trial, the severity of the trial, the hardship, the adversity, the persecution, and if anybody had reason to move into this category, it would have been these dear folks to whom Peter is writing.
[time=2081] But you know, it's the feeling I've been singled out. I'm receiving more than my fair share of hard knocks in life.
[time=2088] Elijah got there, said, "Oh, only I am left in this crusade for God."
[time=2094] Jonah got there, Jonah wanted to commit suicide, he felt so singled out, so mistreated, so misunderstood by God.
[time=2104] Job got there when he said that it would be better for him, never have to have been born.
[time=2111] He implies in that, as did Elijah and Jonah, God is so unjust, God is so harsh, God is so unfair, God is treating me in this special category in such a ridiculous way.
[time=2122] I'm having to suffer and endure things no other Christian has ever had to suffer much less and endure successfully.
[time=2129] People get paralyzed by spiritual self-pity. The text says, "Hey, let me help you out."
[time=2135] Remember now, the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your brother and who are in the world.
[time=2141] They're making it, you're going to make it. This isn't abnormal.
[time=2147] You see what happens in this downward spiral of self-pity, spiritual self-pity, as we begin to accuse God.
[time=2154] We begin to accuse God of being unfair or unjust or unloving or insensitive or whatever, and that leads us to a more dangerous place called alienation from God.
[time=2166] We begin to so convince ourselves that God cannot be trusted, that we then put distance, the softness, the soft humility that needs to be characteristic of our hearts under the authoritative hand of God begins to harden over.
[time=2180] We calcify, we create a cold heart, and we distance ourselves then from humble submission to God.
[time=2187] It all starts with spiritual self-pity.
[time=2191] I've got an inferior intellect, an inferior ability, an inferior ministry, an inferior career.
[time=2197] Why do you have to give me this spouse? Why this child? Why did I have to have that father or that mother or grow up in that little town?
[time=2205] And it all begins to snowball in itself, and suddenly the person is paralyzed under their self-pity because they've accused God and now find themselves cold-hearted to the God they have wrongly accused.
[time=2216] And when you are alienated from God, guess who else you're alienated from.
[time=2221] Everybody else in your world, you can't shut your heart down to a relationship with God and keep your relationship with people alive.
[time=2230] It doesn't work that way. And then comes this spirit of jealousy. Why isn't he sick? Why am I sick? Why isn't he sick?
[time=2244] Why do they have such great kids? Why does he like his job so much? Why do they always seem to have more than enough money?
[time=2254] And the thing just spirals down until total paralysis takes over.
[time=2259] Warning, warning against spiritual self-pity. You say, "What do I do about it? I'm knee-deep in it. What do I do about it?"
[time=2269] Go back to the beginning. Ask yourself the fundamental question. What does God really owe me? What does God really owe me?
[time=2276] The answer is justice. The only thing God owes anybody is justice. And what would justice lead to in your life and my life? Death, physical and eternal death.
[time=2285] You know what that means? My next step is a gift. Straight from the hand of God. My next idea. My next breath. My next accomplishment. My next sunrise.
[time=2298] My next conversation with a friend. Gift. It's all a gift that I don't deserve. Now add to that the fact that saved, eternally saved, and dwelt by the Holy Spirit.
[time=2313] Possessor of his inerrant, inspired word, a church, fellowship, family, friends. Start over. Start back with the real question.
[time=2327] Tell me, what is it exactly that I deserve from God?
[time=2333] I was talking with Bob Barkis before the service in the prayer room there. We both were sick last week.
[time=2338] And we were shocked by how much we take our health for granted. We don't have cancer. We don't have a brain tumor. We don't have a broken leg. We just had the flu.
[time=2349] Which meant that it was hard to get out of bed. Harder than usual. Stand there in front of the closet. Try to get the energy to put clothes on. And you thought when I last week, I breathed right through this part.
[time=2360] You see the fact that we can get up in the morning, that we want to get up in the morning, that we put our clothes on, that we want to eat. Gift. Way more than we deserve.
[time=2372] And then realize this, he says, look at verse 10. After you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace who called you to his eternal glory in Christ will himself perfect, confirm, strengthen and establish you.
[time=2386] In other words, God is using even the hardship of your circumstance for his purposes and to fulfill his promises which are to perfect and confirm and strengthen and establish you.
[time=2397] You haven't been forgotten by God. God hasn't singled you out. God hasn't left you. God hasn't put you in a lurch. God hasn't reneged.
[time=2405] God, in fact, is intimately involved in the very experience you're suffering. He knows exactly how long you've been in it. He knows how long you need to stay in it because he's in a process of perfecting and confirming and strengthening and establishing you.
[time=2417] It's an amazing thing. So it should be joy. Are you dead today? No. Rejoice. Are you bound for eternal hell today? No. Rejoice.
[time=2431] Has God forsaken you? Even for this period on earth? No. He's active even in that. Rejoice. Does God love you? Yeah. Rejoice.
[time=2443] Does God faithful to his promises? Yeah. Rejoice.
[time=2448] Spiritual self-pity that will paralyze you, take you out of the game, alienate you from God and from people and friends. What else is there?
[time=2458] If you're cold-horted towards God and you're cold-hearted towards the people around you, where are you?
[time=2464] Thirdly, he says this. Thirdly, he says this. Beware of spiritual exhaustion. Beware of spiritual exhaustion. Look at verse 12. He says through Sylvanas.
[time=2479] Sylvanas, this might be another name for Silas, who we've met several other times, but Sylvanas in this situation seems to be the secretary.
[time=2487] Peter's dictating this letter and maybe now up to this place, Sylvanas has been writing it down. And Peter is speaking through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2495] And all of a sudden, you know, Peter comes over and takes the pen and says, now, you know, through Sylvanas, our faithful brother, I have written to you briefly.
[time=2503] Exorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Now here it is. Stand firm in it.
[time=2510] What I have been saying to you, this is the true grace of God. Now, just stand in it. How do you do that?
[time=2520] Stand. I mean, that has the idea of will and purpose and strength, and your standing firm, which implies opposition.
[time=2528] Your standing firm, but your standing firm in something called the grace of God, and the grace of God is all about God.
[time=2533] The grace of God is he did everything. He saved us. It was the work of Christ. We cannot work for our salvation.
[time=2540] How do you stand in the midst of grace? I was hunting around for an illustration on this.
[time=2548] And the only one I could think of is it goes on between my son and I. Bob, he's four. He's just a little guy yet, but man, is he tough.
[time=2555] You know, he really thinks he's tough. And we get back there on the back bed, the king-sized bed there, and we play this game.
[time=2561] Who can knock who off the bed onto the floor? It's a little violent at times, especially when the big girls show up.
[time=2569] You know, Nikki and Kelly and Whitney. Now, they outweigh him by sometimes 100 pounds. Don't tell him I said that. They'd be offended by that.
[time=2576] And they can get tough, and he deserves it sometimes. They'll pop him, and boom, he's on the floor on his head, and he's crying.
[time=2582] He's not sure he likes this anymore. He's like, "Wow." Well, he finally learned that if he would just team with me, he'd say, "Dad, how about it's us against them?"
[time=2592] I'd say, "Okay." And I kind of get up on all fours, you know, on my knees and my hands, and he finds this spot right underneath my chest.
[time=2598] He crawls under there. And then when they attack, and they leap, and they jump, and they push, and they smash with pillows, he's tough. He's safe.
[time=2608] Because he's got this incubator thing going. And then at just the right moment, he can come out and strike.
[time=2615] He can get a punch in, or he can give an extra push that helps him go over the edge. He quickly tucks back in.
[time=2621] That's what it means, I think, to stand under the grace of God. You see, the battle's over, my friends. Satan's been defeated. It happened at the cross.
[time=2631] It's over. Now, the question is, are you and I going to huddle up underneath the grace of God, and in there, choose to stand firm?
[time=2642] Oh, look at the play-apart from time to time. We'll take some blows at the enemy from underneath the protective grace of God.
[time=2649] But you've got to stay under the grace of God. You can't be hustling out there on your own like Bob does.
[time=2655] Sometimes it gets a little cocky, and you get, boom, he's off. It's exactly what happens.
[time=2661] Do you ever feel like you're fainting spiritually? Do you ever feel like you're a spiritual failure?
[time=2666] You're inept in the struggle against sin. You're discouraged with how you're handling adversity. You're tempted to defect.
[time=2673] You're tempted, and what I mean by that? You're not tempted to burn your Bible. You're not tempted to call a church to say, "Take away my membership."
[time=2679] You're just tempted to live outside of God's grace. You're just going to work life out on your own.
[time=2689] It's as if Peter is saying, "You know what? I know what you feel like out there. I know you feel like collapsing spiritually.
[time=2694] You're cowering down there in the catacombs, and you're feeling like just giving up on this whole thing.
[time=2699] I see you out there hiding on the hillsides in those caves, and you feel like giving up.
[time=2704] I see you out there in the absolute isolated places of the deserts, but he's calling to me saying, "Stand firm, but stand in the grace of God. Don't defect."
[time=2714] Paying on to what you know to be true about God and his grace.
[time=2718] It's an amazingly common problem. Do you realize that almost every church, almost every letter that Paul wrote,
[time=2725] he mentions the component in that church that is having trouble staying underneath the grace of God?
[time=2732] In the book of Galatians, he said this to these people who had come to know Christ through faith, and he presented the gospel.
[time=2737] He says this, "I am amazed that you are so quickly deserting him who called you by the grace of Christ for a different gospel."
[time=2748] Life got tough on the Galatians, and some of these convictions about being saved by faith and really relying on the grace of God got tested by some false teachers, and there was a component of them
[time=2758] that were running out from underneath the grace of God, deserting God, hanging on now to a different gospel.
[time=2765] Stand firm, stand firm, take your position underneath the protection of the grace of God.
[time=2771] To the Hebrews, he says this, "For this reason we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard,
[time=2778] lest we drift away from it. Take care, brethren, unless they should be in any one of you, an evil,
[time=2786] unbelieving heart in falling away from the living God."
[time=2792] Did you hear it? An evil, unbelieving heart that leads you to fall away from the living God,
[time=2799] then he finishes, "Let us therefore be diligent to enter that rest." There it is. Stand firm under the grace. Be diligent to enter the rest.
[time=2808] We must work, not at our salvation. We must work, not at trying to please God.
[time=2813] We must work at staying under the grace of God, continuing to trust, continuing to submit, continuing to stay under that protective place.
[time=2824] To the Colossians, it was a different thing. He said this, "See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary principles of the world, rather than according to Christ." In this illustration or in Colossians situation, it's like somebody was beckoning them. Come on out.
[time=2843] Come on out from underneath the grace of God. We've got a thing called philosophy.
[time=2847] Come on out into our empty deception. Come on out into our elementary principles.
[time=2852] Don't trust that God can continue to forgive and continue to love and continue to pick you up and continue to transform and perfect and confirm and strengthen and establish you.
[time=2861] Don't your circumstances prove beyond the shadow of the doubt that you've just got to give up on the grace of God.
[time=2869] And many of them were believing that. And many of them were walking out from underneath it into philosophy and the empty deception, the traditions of men.
[time=2882] To the Corinthians, he said, "Be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord,
[time=2889] knowing that your toil is not in vain in the Lord." Stay underneath there. And while you're there, be busy with the things of the Lord.
[time=2898] Work for the Lord, knowing that he will make something of this.
[time=2902] You don't have enough on your own. He'll make something of this.
[time=2907] I could go to several different passages in the New Testament right now to show you Paul's struggle with his own heart not to defect.
[time=2916] I chose one for this morning. He says this in Philippians chapter one.
[time=2920] One thing I do.
[time=2924] For getting what, one thing, one thing I do, forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.
[time=2939] That's the apostle Paul. He is constantly disciplining himself to forget what has gone behind him and to hang on to what is yet ahead of him, the goal, the prize, the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.
[time=2955] Remember this one? It's called the fellowship of the unashamed.
[time=2963] It catches the spirit, I think, of what Peter is saying. Stand firm.
[time=2968] It goes this way. I am part of the fellowship of the unashamed.
[time=2973] I have Holy Spirit power. The die has been cast. I've stepped over the line.
[time=2979] The decision has been made. I'm a disciple of his.
[time=2984] I won't look back, let up, slow down, back away, or be still.
[time=2990] My past is redeemed. My present makes sense. My future is secure.
[time=2995] I am finished with and done with low living, sight walking, small planning, smooth knees, colorless dreams, tame visions, mundane talking, chintzy giving, and dwarfed goals.
[time=3009] I no longer need preeminence, prosperity, position, promotions, plaudits, or popularity.
[time=3016] I don't have to be right. First, tops, recognized, praised, regarded, or rewarded.
[time=3023] I now live by presence, lean by faith, love by patience, live by prayer, and labor by power. My face is set.
[time=3033] My gate is fast, my goal is heaven, my road is narrow, my way is rough, my companions few, my guide reliable, my mission clear.
[time=3043] I cannot be bought, compromised, detoured, lured away, turned back,
[time=3049] diluted, or delayed. I will not flinch in the face of sacrifice, hesitate in the presence of adversity, negotiate at the table of the enemy, ponder at the pool of popularity, or meander in the maze of mediocrity.
[time=3064] I won't give up, shut up, let go, or slow up till I've preached up, prayed up, paid up, stored up, and stayed up for the cause of Christ.
[time=3074] I am a disciple of Jesus. I must go till he comes, give till I drop,
[time=3081] preach till all know, and work till he stops.
[time=3086] And when he comes to get his own, he'll have no problems recognizing me.
[time=3092] My colors will be clear.
[time=3099] You got any unheated warnings in your life this morning?
[time=3106] Has the Holy Spirit been prompting, tugging, saying let go of this, let go of that?
[time=3114] Well, for one, beware of spiritual naivety.
[time=3120] You're being stalked. You've been stalked this morning, you'll be stalked this afternoon.
[time=3124] He's very patient. He's very clever. You may not know it until it's done.
[time=3132] Beware of spiritual self-pity. It will paralyze you.
[time=3136] It will freeze your heart and lock you to an isolated place
[time=3142] where you feel neither the warmth of God nor the fellowship of people.
[time=3147] And beware of spiritual exhaustion. Beware of the thing that's plagued believers
[time=3154] since the beginning of being believers, disillusionment, and quitting.
[time=3162] Quitting on Christ, quitting on God, quitting on the fundamentals, quitting on the basics.
[time=3177] All of us are pilgrims in this dark and fallen place.
[time=3187] We're from the trouble we have seen.
[time=3194] Looking for an answer for some reason to go on.
[time=3201] Searching for some unforgotten dream.
[time=3208] Deep within our longing, at our point of greatest loss,
[time=3214] we can find a source of healing and the cross.
[time=3222] There is our river of hope for you and me.
[time=3229] Our crimson fountains, streaming down from cavalry.
[time=3235] And it's there for every bleeding, refugee of the war.
[time=3242] Every bad earth, survivor, who can bear the pain will mourn.
[time=3248] There's a cure for every desperate dying soul.
[time=3255] Come get washed in the river of hope.
[time=3272] Throughout the course of history, the father of mankind has felt our pain
[time=3280] hurt our lonely crimes.
[time=3285] Reaching down into our misery, he said his only son to die.
[time=3292] The spotless lamb, the perfect sacrifice.
[time=3298] Now the curse of death is broken, we can rise above the falls
[time=3305] to the one whose blood was poured out for a song.
[time=3313] There is our river of hope for you and me.
[time=3320] Our crimson fountains, streaming down from cavalry.
[time=3326] And it's there for every bleeding, refugee of the war.
[time=3333] Every bad earth, survivor, who can bear the pain no more.
[time=3339] There's a cure for every desperate dying soul.
[time=3346] Come get washed in the river of hope.
[time=3360] In the midst of our reflection, there's a comfort we can't know.
[time=3367] Down where the waves of mercy flow.
[time=3374] There is our river of hope for you and me.
[time=3381] Our crimson fountains, streaming down from cavalry.
[time=3387] It's there for every bleeding, refugee of the war.
[time=3394] Every bad earth, survivor, who can bear the pain no more.
[time=3401] There's a cure for every desperate dying soul.
[time=3408] Come get washed in the river of hope.
[time=3441] Once again, Father, we stand to close in prayer.
[time=3447] We would invite whoever it is, whatever you are this morning, right there in the privacy of where you're standing.
[time=3462] What would you say to God this morning, privately, quietly, secretly?
[time=3465] What would you say to God this morning to these warnings?
[time=3470] Would you give him worship?
[time=3477] Father, we thank you and praise you for your word, for its truth.
[time=3483] Thank you that we are not left here not knowing and being warned and being guided and instructed by the true and living Word of God.
[time=3489] Thank you that we have each other, this great assembly of believers who want to move in the same direction for the same reasons for the glory of God.
[time=3497] Hold us tightly together, unify us, help us to bring glory and honor to your name.
[time=3503] We thank you most of all today for the person of Jesus Christ who died for our sins, who stood in our place, who took our blows and who heals us through his death and resurrection.
[time=3515] Pray these things in his name and all God's people said. Amen. God bless you.
