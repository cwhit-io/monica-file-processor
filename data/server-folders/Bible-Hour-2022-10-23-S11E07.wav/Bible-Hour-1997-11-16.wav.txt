[time=30] And so he begins, "Behold," I mean this was a sight out of nowhere comes this rich young
[time=49] ruler crashing into the presence of Christ and here is the question on his mind, look at a teacher, "What good things shall I do that I may obtain eternal life?" Now that
[time=61] is the question of the ages, is it not? I mean that is the question that everybody wants an answer to. The interesting thing is not everybody walks around with that question on their mind all the time. My experience is that if you get into a conversation with somebody
[time=76] eventually they'll either have an opinion or wish they knew about eternal life, knew how to resolve that issue in their life but it's not front and center all the time. And we don't know what brought it front and center in the life of this rich young ruler. We don't know if somebody died in his family that brought this issue. Man, where did my dad go? Where
[time=96] did my mom go? Where did my sister go? What happens after death? We don't know, it doesn't tell us. Maybe somebody was sick and about to die. Maybe his wealth was in jeopardy. Maybe he knew that in a short amount of time he would be broke and bankrupt and then he's starting to ask some more deep questions about life. What happens after you die? Maybe he was just
[time=115] tired of his religion. Sure he was a rich young ruler, a leader in the synagogue but maybe that whole thing was not satisfying. That whole external religious experience wrapped up in the synagogue experience left him without a sense of joy and peace and the kind of sense
[time=130] that he was walking with God. We don't know what brought this question to the surface but we can see it is right there on the top of his brain. It is blunt, it is well articulated,
[time=140] it is focused and he is asking a very, very important question, what do I have to do to have eternal life? This is the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=158] Thank you for joining us. This week in his study of the Ten Commandments, Pastor Moore looks at the fourth commandment, honor your father and mother. We hope you will stay tuned.
[time=167] Now let's join our service. Well we continue this morning in our study of the Ten Commandments.
[time=175] We have called the series the Big Ten and as you know if you have been here it has been our endeavor to each week kind of associate a different Big Ten school with that week's commandment. So this morning here we are at Ohio State. I have a flag here that someone
[time=190] brought. I have got my son thought this was a Juana jacket but actually it is a letter
[time=197] jacket given to me by a Buckeye faithful and we continue on this morning in our study of the Big Ten. Now I believe we come this morning to the fifth commandment and in case
[time=209] you are not familiar with it it is going to flash up here on the screen. You can read through it with me. It says honor your father and your mother that your days may be prolonged
[time=218] in the land which the Lord your God gives you. Honor your father and your mother. And when
[time=225] you think about Ohio State and when you think about the Buckeyes there is probably one name
[time=232] or one coach that comes to mind and that would be Mr. Woody Hayes. Now it is kind of a similar
[time=238] thing with Woody as we bumped into with Bobby Knight and that is it is sad that so many times when you hear the name Woody Hayes your mind immediately goes to one of his most unfortunate
[time=249] moments as a coach that dreadful Knight there when he punched that player from the other team in the stomach after having intercepted an Ohio State pass and it got thrown over all the headlines and bad move obviously. But again it is so unfortunate that an incident
[time=265] like that can sometimes overshadow the good and positive things about a man. And in Woody's in that instance there were some things that he did that were really very encouraging that were really I think pretty profound. One of which was this. He had a deep commitment
[time=281] as a coach and as a recruiter. People will tell you that in his day there wasn't a better recruiter in the country than Woody Hayes. But there was a way that he went about recruiting
[time=292] that was really unique at least in that day and it was very unique to him. While his assistant coaches would take a prospective player and tour them around the stadium there at Columbus and they would take him through the campus and fill his head with dreams of Big Ten Championships and Rose Ball appearances. Guess where Woody Hayes would be? They called Woody
[time=313] Hayes the master of the living room. While the student athlete was out getting recruited
[time=320] by the assistant coaches Woody Hayes would be in the living room with the players mom and dad. Because they believed firmly that they were the ones that deserved the respect.
[time=329] They were the ones that he wanted to honor. They were the ones that yes he wanted to get to that's true but he wouldn't just do it in his recruiting. Stories are told and the legend is and it seems to be pretty factual that all through a player's four years there to Ohio State it would not be uncommon for Woody Hayes to be sending his mom or his dead birthday cards to visit parents while they were in the hospital for whatever reason. There was something there in his mind he understood what it meant to honor and give respect to a mom and dad it went a long way in their hearts and in their minds.
[time=381] And it goes way back down the line. They had a vision. I prayed for the future.
[time=397] But I wouldn't take the world for what they gave to me. I'm living the legacy.
[time=422] I am standing tall when I'm on my knees. I'm living the legacy.
[time=449] Something in common deep inside me knows that for me who are gone gives me the vision who
[time=470] fills me with the passion to make the message carry on. Now I'm not perfect. Life's not
[time=486] easy. But for the future's sake I'm gonna do the best I can. I'm living the legacy.
[time=497] I'm living the legacy. I'm living the legacy. I am standing tall when I'm on my knees.
[time=515] I'm living the legacy. I'm living the legacy. I'm living the legacy. I'm living the legacy.
[time=562] What comes to mind or maybe better said what comes to the forefront of your heart, you,
[time=570] individually, you out there this morning, when I ask you this question, how do you feel about
[time=576] your mom and dad? How do you feel about your mom and dad? Kind of feelings, race across
[time=584] your mind, what kind of things come to your memory? Or maybe another question might be
[time=590] how do you feel about honoring your dad and your mom? How do you feel about honoring
[time=598] them? You see the truth of the matter is that in a room this size with all these people,
[time=605] your answers, the things that came to the forefront of your heart as I ask those questions,
[time=611] the answers would range, wouldn't they, from way over here to way over here. Because there's a lot of folks in this room today who have, and we're thankful for this, who have benefited greatly from a lifetime of investment and love and relationship from a mom and dad
[time=626] that they dearly love and cherish and praise God for that. There is as well on the other
[time=632] end of that spectrum here in this room this morning, another large group of people who didn't have it like that, whose memories of mom and dad and whose memories of growing up and whose memories when we talk about honoring mom and dad, it get to be very confusing.
[time=647] You see, theirs was a childhood filled with loss and shame and guilt and frustration
[time=654] and loneliness perhaps. And so when you bring all of that together in one room and we try
[time=660] to begin to think about what it means to honor our father and our mother, that can
[time=666] be for many a very challenging thought. How do you cope with that? How do you deal with that? Well, this morning in the drama that you're about to see, we would invite you just to follow along and what you see and what you hear may really resonate inside of you. You may really connect with it or you may not, but even if you don't, I bet there are those that you know who have been through similar experiences. And we've all got to grapple with this issue of honoring our father and our mother. And where does God fit into it? How does he help or what role does he play? We want you to think
[time=699] these things through. We invite you to consider honoring your father and your mother this morning. Look, I thought we agreed, mom is not going to be able to fit
[time=712] all dad stuff into the townhouse. It's only a few boxes. A few boxes? She said these
[time=719] were the things that were most important to him. Look, humor her, will you? Let her
[time=726] keep the things that remind her of him. She'll let go of this stuff in time. For
[time=732] now, she needs it. Needs it? Isn't that a little bit overstated? Jerry, who's over
[time=742] stating? I mean, all day long, you've been on edge. It's like the least little thing
[time=749] that tells you. What's going on? I don't know. It's nothing. Lift with your
[time=762] legs, not with your back. So, how long do we have to get the assessment deposit to
[time=770] the condo association? By closing at five o'clock. And it's four thirty already.
[time=777] Where has this date gone? You'd think we could bring the check over tomorrow. If only we could call. But they've already disconnected the phone. Now, why can't they be that efficient when you move in? Really. Jerry, do you remember the story
[time=794] behind this phone? I've never seen dad so upset. Well, how would you react if you
[time=800] were the dad and came home only to find your son frantically trying to put a smashed phone back together again? I thought he was going to kill me. And it was all your fault. My fault? Who pulled the phone off whose lap and then throw it across the room? Who was beginning to make her third call after already monopolizing it for two hours? Well, we used to go at it, didn't we? Yeah,
[time=826] how did mom and dad stand it? I don't know. But I know he wouldn't have won children of the year award. Yeah, well, dad would have never won father of the year award
[time=839] either. No, I guess dad was no saint. But you have to admit, we had a lot of
[time=847] opportunities our friends never had. Yeah, I suppose, like Camp Minneconi. How many
[time=854] years in a row? Many. And my ten years of dance classes. Music, camp. My flying
[time=860] lessons. He was so proud of you when you soloed. Do you remember how he sent us all
[time=867] even your instructor out to dinner? Yeah, he was generous. We had access to his car,
[time=875] his boat, his money, everything except him. Come on, dad did the best he could. You
[time=887] don't have to defend him, Sue. Dad's not around anymore to reward your loyalty.
[time=892] What? You think dad treated me better? Is that why you think I stand up for him?
[time=898] Look, you were a girl. You did better in school. You always did exactly what he wanted you to do. I did not. What is with you today? Why do you insist on carrying on about dad? I guess I just feel like, like sometimes he shut me out. Like he was penalizing
[time=918] me for not turning out exactly the way he wanted. Jerry, he loved you. Yeah. Look, I
[time=928] know things weren't the greatest between you two, but can't we just focus on the positive? I am angry, Sue. The man's dead, Jerry. And I'm angry at him. Is that allowed?
[time=941] He was never there for me. And now when mom needs him, he's not there for her either.
[time=946] The guy doesn't even know how to die at the right time. I don't want to tell you.
[time=956] But we need to get that check to the association office. I don't want to risk a penalty.
[time=966] So I'll just go and you can stay and finish putting the boxes on the truck. Okay? All right.
[time=974] That'll be fine.
[time=979] Jerry, I... I'll be back in about a half an hour. And we can talk more then. Yeah, sure.
[time=996] Well, bye. See you. Oh, great. Sue, you didn't tape up the bottom of the box. Would you look at...
[time=1023] Would you look at this? A handprint in plaster. Susan, age five.
[time=1037] A coupon book for daddy had Christmas. Good for one free back rub. Good for emptying the garbage.
[time=1047] What's this? Camp Miniconi. This is a letter I wrote my first summer away.
[time=1063] Music, camp, birthdays, Father's Day. Roses are red, violets are blue. Most cards rhyme, but this one doesn't.
[time=1074] Love Jerry. I really had a way with words.
[time=1081] He actually saved all these. And they're all from me.
[time=1091] He saved every stink and card and letter I ever wrote him. And in order, no less.
[time=1101] Dear dad, hi.
[time=1105] This seems really weird. I never wrote a letter to my own dad before. Except cards, but I only put my name on those. Camp is okay.
[time=1116] We sing songs every time we eat. They make Kool-Aid here from bugs.
[time=1122] Everybody swears a lot here, but don't worry, I'm not going to.
[time=1127] It rained yesterday and Tommy Stims and me got all muddy when we took a shortcut from the craft lodge.
[time=1135] One of the guys in my cabin doesn't have a dad who lives with him.
[time=1146] He doesn't know much about playing ball. I'm trying to teach him to bunt like you taught me.
[time=1156] I like camp, but I like it at home too.
[time=1162] You're picking me up Sunday, right? I'll have lots of stories to tell you.
[time=1168] I'm glad I don't have to stay here for more than a week. I hope you remember to write me.
[time=1177] It's you, love, Jerry.
[time=1207] I think, down on my knees, lifetimes of boxes, time lends to me, letters and photographs, yellowed with ears.
[time=1229] Some bring in after, some bring in tears, time never changes the memories, the faces of loved ones who bring to me.
[time=1255] All that I come from, and all that I live for, and all that I'm going to be.
[time=1273] My precious family is more than alone to me.
[time=1291] Wise men and shepherds, down on their knees, bringing their treasures to lay at his feet.
[time=1308] Who was this one under, baby that came, living and dying?
[time=1321] He gave life to me, and time never changes the memory, the moment his life.
[time=1335] First peers through me, telling all that I come from, and all that I live for, and all that I'm going to be.
[time=1360] My precious Savior is more than alone to me.
[time=1390] I can remember it as though it were yesterday, I was in the fourth grade, I don't know why they did it, but they lined up all the fourth graders, both classes, about 60-70 of us out there, on the big athletic field, along the far fence line, and then we were going to have this race.
[time=1409] And everybody on the word go was supposed to race the other side, and we were going to see who was going to win. The teacher organized all this.
[time=1416] Now I can't explain it to this day, but I can tell you with vivid clarity, standing on that starting line, expecting to win.
[time=1427] I knew very little about everybody else in the group, I just moved to the school from another city. There was just something in me that I expected I would win, and somebody said go, and we raced, and in fact I thought I had one.
[time=1442] Until a couple of my classmates, a little bit later, had instructed me that Ruben Gonzalez had really won, and Jeff Young had come in second, and I scratched my head on amazement and thought, well, I wonder if they had an end for advantage.
[time=1454] I mean, maybe they didn't start right, maybe the finish line was crooked, and somehow it just looked like they won.
[time=1459] In the sixth grade, it was about all the second week into the baseball season, and I didn't go out for baseball. I didn't know how to play baseball. I never played baseball.
[time=1467] I didn't have a baseball glove, really, kind of still hate baseball this day, as a matter of fact. But back then, they were struggling as a team, and saw it's astounding.
[time=1477] I'd go into the coach's office, shut the door, sit down, coach, I think I can help.
[time=1482] Literally. I think I can solve this for you. I know the tryouts were a while ago. I know I didn't come. I know I'm a little late, but I really think I could help.
[time=1491] And I don't know what he was thinking, but he agreed. And so I show up at practice, and all the day long, he gives me permission to come to practice.
[time=1499] All day long, I'm telling my friends, my buddies, I'm coming to practice, and things are going to be different.
[time=1505] I mean, I'm really going to make a significant difference. I mean, I'm a great player. I mean, I'm going to turn this whole thing around.
[time=1510] You're going to see, it's just going to be unbelievable. I'm going to be a starter. I remember saying these things. I get out to practice.
[time=1515] They loan me a mitt. Send me out there to take, you know, fly balls, kind of basic rudimentary stuff.
[time=1520] I can't catch a thing. They're landing all around me. People are laughing. They bring me in for batting practice. I can't hit the ball.
[time=1527] It's an amazing thing. I wish all these stories, like, stayed back there in 4th and 5th and 6th grade.
[time=1535] Not too long ago, buddy of mine, big guy, 6 foot 2, played for Brown University.
[time=1540] He was injured, not in high school and college, but I mean, just later in life. And he had to get his big motorcycle in his front door.
[time=1545] I don't know why he wanted his front door. Off his porch in the front door, going to put it somewhere in the back room, work on it.
[time=1550] I don't know. He's obviously injured. He's hobbling. He's bandaged. He's on crutchets. And it's one of these big motorcycles.
[time=1556] I mean, not a little thing like I have when I was growing up. I mean, one of these big, I have no experience with those kind of bikes.
[time=1561] And he said, I just said, I'll handle this. And I went over there and grabbed the handlebars, kicked the foot stand up, and I was going to just push it right through his front door.
[time=1570] And I don't know whether it was the first step or the second step or what happened, but all of a sudden, the weight of the bike started to lean away from me and it got past dead center.
[time=1579] And it was obvious to me we were going over because this thing was heavier than I was and I wouldn't go stop it.
[time=1584] And it started to go and suddenly it stopped.
[time=1587] And he, knowing a little bit more about the situation, and having worn me in advance, Russ is really heavy. You might not do it that way.
[time=1593] He hobbled behind me on one foot because he loved his motorcycle and he knew what was going to happen.
[time=1597] And at just the right critical moment, he grabbed it, you know, and he kept it from going over.
[time=1603] Now, have you ever noticed that some personality types tend to drastically overestimate their abilities?
[time=1610] I mean, some of us just do that. We do that constantly and we do that all the time, and we aren't, now not everybody does this.
[time=1618] Some people, you know, have the other problem and they underestimate wrongfully their abilities and they're really better than they think and then there's this other group over here.
[time=1626] And we're just always thinking we're better than we are. We have an inflated view of ourselves.
[time=1630] We have an inflated view of our place in life and our importance in life and our contributions to things we are a part of.
[time=1637] It's just amazing. It's natural, it's instinctive, and it seems to have a life of its own.
[time=1644] It just perpetuates itself and you'd think that enough counsel and enough thinking and enough pondering these kinds of things.
[time=1651] I consider these kinds of people egomaniacs just for the term this morning.
[time=1656] There's just something weird that goes on inside their brain.
[time=1659] They're almost beyond help. Words of caution rarely slow them down.
[time=1665] Watching other people fail rarely slows them down.
[time=1669] In fact, nothing but the severe lessons of harsh reality begin to even temper this disease they have in their head and their mind and their heart.
[time=1679] In other words, it wasn't until the race was over and the stats were in and everybody else agreed that I didn't win, that I even began to be open to the notion that I wasn't the fastest person in the school.
[time=1690] And I'll tell you this, if we hadn't had that race in fourth grade, I'd still think I was the fastest guy in the school.
[time=1697] It's only a little bit of reality that tempers that.
[time=1700] And a bunch of races since then through junior high and high school that have proven to me I'm not really a very fast human being.
[time=1707] Reality over and over and over again banging the head of the egomaniac is usually the only thing that can help cure at least temper the problem.
[time=1717] It's the school of hard knocks. It's failure. It's exposure.
[time=1723] It's the jarring stuff of reality that slows this kind of temperament personality down.
[time=1729] Wow, maybe I'm not as good as I thought I was. Maybe I'm not as important as I thought I was.
[time=1734] Maybe I tend to overestimate myself.
[time=1738] This morning, if you have a Bible, open it to Matthew chapter 19. Jesus encounters an egomaniac in chapter 19.
[time=1748] This guy has got it bad.
[time=1753] And I don't know where I got it and I don't know where he got it, but he has it.
[time=1760] And he is grossly, as you will see, overestimating his abilities.
[time=1766] Now, he comes to Jesus with this burning question about eternal life.
[time=1771] And Jesus strategically takes the Ten Commandments. In fact, the one that we're going to study this morning.
[time=1776] The one about honoring your father and your mother, and he drops it out of sequence when it was originally given it was number five.
[time=1784] He throws it back in the number nine. I'll show you why.
[time=1788] And so it's Jesus, the egomaniac, and the Ten Commandments.
[time=1793] And he leaves this poor guy with a painful but lasting brush with reality.
[time=1801] Now, the story is told in three different books. It's told in the book of Matthew, it's told in the book of Mark, and it's told in the book of Luke.
[time=1807] And oftentimes, those three books, the first three gospels, will tell about the same story, but because there's three different writers, they bring out different things about the same event.
[time=1818] And I'll do my best without having you turn to those other books to kind of feed that information in so you get a full look at what is actually going on.
[time=1826] Matthew, chapter 19, verse 16, it says this, "And behold, one came to him and said, 'Teacher, what good things shall I do that I may obtain eternal life?'"
[time=1837] Now, that's the setting. Who is this guy? This guy, first of all, Matthew 19 tells us is young.
[time=1842] The same chapter tells us that he's rich, and then Luke adds that he's a ruler. He's the rich, young ruler.
[time=1851] Now, to be a ruler in that day, in that context, likely meant that he was a faithfully devoted religious leader in the synagogue.
[time=1859] And so, the community of people in which he lived, it wasn't like he was a pastor, it would be more like he was a lay elder, a well-known elder in the community, committed to the synagogue and to the religion.
[time=1871] He would have watched himself carefully in terms of the feasts and the festivals, the type of clothing he would wear.
[time=1878] He would have followed the Old Testament Jewish law pretty closely. That's what it means.
[time=1883] He's the rich, he's young, and he's a ruler in the synagogue, a devout, honest, kind, wealthy, prominent, well-known, influential religious young man.
[time=1892] Okay? That's who this guy is. Underneath, he's a raging egomaniac, as you'll see. He is blinded by his own overestimation of himself to the truth about himself.
[time=1905] The thing I love about this story, and it gives guys like me a little hope, is that in Mark 10, Mark adds that Jesus deeply loved him.
[time=1915] Jesus deeply loved him. He was greatly loved by Christ. So what you've got is the rich young ruler who mattered to God.
[time=1922] The rich young ruler who was deeply loved by Christ. It's a beautiful little story here. Look at verse 16 again.
[time=1931] Matthew opens up with Behold. Matthew shocked. Matthew can't believe that this one would come to Christ.
[time=1938] It's like out of character. Mark adds that he ran into the presence of Christ. I mean, he sprinted into the presence of Christ.
[time=1946] It was a public setting. Everybody who knew him, many of the people who were there would have known him as he was a ruler in the synagogue.
[time=1953] Remember Nicodemus had a question about eternal life, and he found Christ win in the night under cover of darkness.
[time=1959] Nicodemus didn't want to be known that he didn't know the answer to how to get to heaven.
[time=1963] This kid, this particular day, didn't care who knew. He runs into the presence of Christ in a public setting and blurts out this question, teacher.
[time=1973] What good things shall I do that I may obtain eternal life? That's quite a question.
[time=1978] I mean, that is probably the ultimate question, isn't it?
[time=1981] I mean, when you get past some of the mundane stuff, what people really want to know is how do I live forever?
[time=1986] Is there a forever? What happens to people after death? And if there is ever after, how do I get there?
[time=1992] Then that's the question that he poses.
[time=1994] Now, what the text doesn't tell us, Matthew doesn't tell us, Mark doesn't tell us, Luke doesn't tell us.
[time=1999] Why was this question like burning in his heart?
[time=2003] I think it's a universal question, but I don't think all of us run around every minute of every day with that one at the front of our thinking.
[time=2009] I mean, for some reason, at this particular moment in his life, that spiritual issue came to a boil, and he really had a burden to understand the answer to that question.
[time=2020] Maybe it was a death. Maybe it was a death in his family. We don't know. Maybe a mom died or a dad died or a brother died or a sister died.
[time=2027] Maybe his wealth was being eaten away, and soon enough he'd be broke, and so maybe the security that sometimes people find in wealth was waning.
[time=2036] And it may, wow, you know, what happens? What's the real meaning of life? And what happens after life?
[time=2043] Maybe he was sick and knew he was coming into a bad disease. The beginnings of leprosy might have shown up on his body.
[time=2049] We don't know why, but the fact is something had provoked this deep level of thought to the front of his mind to cause him to run into the presence of Christ in the public place and ask for an answer on this most significant question.
[time=2064] Interesting scenario. Very interesting. Now, here's how the conversation goes. Look at verse 17.
[time=2073] And Jesus said to him, "Why are you asking me about what is good? There is only one who is good."
[time=2081] That's a very important thought, and you'll see why as we develop. What Jesus is saying is, you're asking him about what good thing you have to do.
[time=2087] Let me get to the answer here. Real in a hurry, there's only one who is good, and you'll see why that's so important in a minute.
[time=2095] But he backs up. Jesus does. But if you wish to enter into life, keep the commandments.
[time=2104] Verse 18, the rich young ruler who is loved by God says this, "Which ones?" Jesus said, "Now, you shall, here they come, not commit murder.
[time=2117] You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not bear false witness.
[time=2123] And finally, honor your father and your mother." Now, if you were to go back to the Decalogue when they were originally given to God by Moses on the stones,
[time=2130] you would find that murder is not in that order. It's actually, honor your father and mother, and then comes murder, adultery, steal.
[time=2137] Why did Jesus reverse the order? And then, look again at verse 19, he adds something that was never given in the Ten Commandments.
[time=2147] "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." So right away, you can assume and understand that Jesus, the master teacher who had knowledge of what filled people's hearts,
[time=2158] was beginning to take something like the Ten Commandments, rearrange them and add them to make a direct hit on the spiritual issue in this man's life.
[time=2172] Look at verse 20. Jesus said to him, "Excuse me, the young man said in verse 20." This is amazing. Here you go.
[time=2180] All these things I have kept, what am I still lacking? I'm the fastest kid in class.
[time=2191] I can save the baseball team. I can handle this motorcycle. What you've got going here is a well-developed ego-manianism inside this guy's head.
[time=2203] I think he really thinks he was doing it. I think he had done a very, very good job of convincing himself that at some level, maybe because he was trying hard to keep them, that he was actually keeping them.
[time=2218] This is an amazing profession. Now, watch. This is maybe why Jesus changes the order, which would be the easiest of the Ten Commandments to keep, at least in my opinion, not committing murder. So Jesus puts that at the top.
[time=2229] Lots of us haven't committed murder. Second one, adultery. Lots of us haven't committed adultery. Next one, stealing.
[time=2239] Actually, lots of us stole some gum. Did you ever steal gum as a kid? I don't know. I did. Okay. Lots of us have never stolen anything.
[time=2248] But here we go. Now we're getting down to the meddling. False witness.
[time=2253] Since have you ever lied? Have you ever lied? You want to go to heaven? Never once in your entire life ever bear false witness.
[time=2264] Now he's going to go to a much harder one to keep. It's at the beginning of verse 19, the one we're about today. Honor your father and your mother.
[time=2273] Now, honoring your father and your mother doesn't mean you feel good about your mom and dad. It doesn't mean you have warm feelings about your mom and dad.
[time=2278] It doesn't mean you think your mom and dad were great. It doesn't mean anything about that kind of stuff. Here's what it means.
[time=2282] It means that you obey your parents. In the biblical sense, to honor your father and your mother means that you obeyed your mother and your father.
[time=2291] It's more than that because the word honor doesn't just describe external things. It talks about matters of the heart. You obeyed them.
[time=2298] You obeyed them from your heart with a willing heart. No sarcasm. No anger. No rebellion. No. Okay, I'll do it.
[time=2310] Complete and total obedience from the heart every single time they ask you to do something.
[time=2317] Now you get a little idea why maybe he reversed the order. Lots of people could stand up in the room and say never murdered anybody.
[time=2324] And it's true. Lots of people could stand up in the room and say never committed adultery. It's true.
[time=2330] Lots of people could probably stand up and say I've never really stolen anything.
[time=2335] But now how many could stand up and say I've never once told a lie and then stand up beyond that and say and in every situation I always obeyed my parents from my heart with the right attitude.
[time=2348] This guy is. This guy is standing up in public saying I've kept all this stuff. What's next?
[time=2358] It's an amazing thing. He adds in another text. He says I've done all this from my youth.
[time=2364] Which means youth means the age of accountability. From the very moment that I was able, because as a child you know a two, three, four year old.
[time=2373] Okay, from the moment I was like an adolescent or an adult where I could be held responsible for my actions from that moment until this moment I have kept all of these things.
[time=2383] And if that isn't bad enough, Jesus adds this last one which of course is not one of the 10 commandments, but he puts it in there like it is.
[time=2391] Verse 19 you shall love your neighbor as yourself. This is ridiculous. I mean this is mind boggling.
[time=2399] You know what that means don't you? That means who's your neighbor and the scriptures?
[time=2404] The scriptures teach your neighbor is anybody that you know. Anybody that's next to you. Anybody that you come across.
[time=2411] Remember the Good Samaritan? He called him his neighbor. The Good Samaritan didn't know the guy in the ditch. He just happened across the path of the guy in the ditch so do your neighbor.
[time=2421] Now you're not just supposed to be nice to him. You're not just not supposed to kick him. You're supposed to help him. You're supposed to love him.
[time=2428] You're supposed to be gracious and compassionate and self-sacrificing and loving to every single person you've ever met all your life.
[time=2436] You go many extent up says yeah I've done all that for my youth. No problem. What's next? You get on? I'm good.
[time=2445] I've kept them. Now here's the truth. He may have kept some of them. He may have in fact been a very good son. He may have in fact been a good citizen.
[time=2454] But the interest requirement to heaven isn't trying hard at the 10 commandments. It isn't being good at some of them. It isn't you know keep four out of six.
[time=2463] It is a perfect record on all of them. And as you notice here Jesus even adds not just those but anybody you've ever encountered have you treated them with self-sacrificial love.
[time=2476] Now what is Jesus doing? Jesus isn't teaching that you get to heaven by works. Jesus is carefully trying to shock this individual who is grossly overestimating his goodness.
[time=2491] Into the raw reality that he not only hasn't kept the 10 commandments but he can't keep the 10 commandments.
[time=2499] It's completely beyond the human endeavor to keep the commandments of God. Can't do it. Now see here's a major misconception about the 10 commandments. I hear this often.
[time=2512] People are under the impression that it's like this stair step deal. And these 10 commandments represent this stairway. And if you keep the commandments you can almost just kind of walk your way up into the presence of God. Like it shows here.
[time=2527] If I just have one God that's a step I'm getting closer. If I keep no I also okay I'm closer. No taking the Lord's okay. I'm closer. Keep the Sabbath. Watch my parents. No murder blah blah blah. I go all the way up I make it.
[time=2540] A lot of people think that. Let me tell you something. That is not why the 10 commandments were given. That is not why the 10 commandments were given.
[time=2548] God never gave the 10 commandments to the human race so that they would know how to walk up a moral ladder to reach heaven. You say okay why? Why did God give the 10 commandments?
[time=2563] Let me show you Galatians 3 24. What's that saying? Galatians 3 24 says this. Therefore the law that means the 10 commandments. The law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ.
[time=2578] That we may be justified by faith. Leave that up there for a minute. Do you understand what that's saying? That is saying that the reason God gave us the law is so the law could show us be our tutor.
[time=2589] How much we need Christ so that we could be made right that we're justified means right. Be made right with God. What's it say? Through faith. Not through works. Not through working trying to ascend the moral steps of the 10 commandments.
[time=2604] The 10 commandments should obliterate the human propensity to overestimate our goodness and think that somehow we could merit the pleasure of God.
[time=2613] The 10 commandments should wipe that out in our minds. And it should tutor us, draw us into the presence of Christ and say oh Christ can you forgive me for falling so short the glory of God.
[time=2629] Romans chapter 3, look at this. Romans chapter 3 verse 20 talks about the 10 commandments. It says this. Because by the works of the 10 commandments, by the works of the 10 commandments, no flesh will ever, sorry I added that, will be justified in a sight. What's that say? No human being in all of history will ever be able to walk their way up the stairway and at the end be able to say look I'm justified in your sight God.
[time=2658] I've done enough. I've been good enough. I've earned this. I've worked my way here. What does it say? For through the law comes the knowledge of sin. The only thing, the only thing that God ever intended the human race to get out of the 10 commandments was the knowledge of their own sin.
[time=2679] God's intention is for us to be broken underneath the reality of the standard of the law of God that we can't measure it. And somehow we want to turn it around and say oh now that I know the expectations I'll do a really good job keeping them and I'll earn the pleasure of God.
[time=2697] It's absolutely backwards. One more verse here, John chapter 1 talks about the 10 commandments. It says for the law was given through Moses, that's who we got the 10 commandments from, right, he went up on to Mount Sinai, he came back with the 10, the two tablets, the 10 commandments.
[time=2712] We got the law through Moses, but grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ. Grace, forgiveness, forgiveness.
[time=2723] So Jesus encounters this delusional kid. He's young, he's wealthy, he's popular, and he's really overestimating himself.
[time=2736] Now, he reorders the 10 commandments, putting them kind of in a different order that makes it harder to keep the ones at the end.
[time=2744] Your mother and your father loving your neighbor as yourself, and unfortunately the young man still caught in this delusion about himself responds by saying all these things I have kept, what am I still lacking?
[time=2755] Now, verse 21, this is cool. Jesus is going to go a little bit deeper. He's now going to move out of the theoretical and he's going to go right in to penetrate this kid's heart.
[time=2769] But before we look at it, I want you to know that Mark adds right at this point, right after the kid says, I don't miss anything, I kept all the law.
[time=2778] And before Jesus really takes him to task, in the other gospel, the book of Mark, it says this, and looking at him, Jesus felt love for him.
[time=2789] Jesus is now going to rock this kid's world. Jesus is going to say something very hard for this kid to understand.
[time=2795] He's going to try to pop his bubble, if you will. But the Lord doesn't do it out of anger, and the Lord doesn't do it out of spite, and the Lord isn't taking personal offense to the fact that this kid is lying to him about his assessment of his performance.
[time=2809] The Lord just looks at him, he's just madly in love with him. And so he's going to offer this next question or statement out of a heart of compassion and love for a highly deluded young man. Look at it here, verse 21, Jesus.
[time=2826] Jesus said to him, if you wish to be complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven. Come follow me.
[time=2839] Now what's Jesus saying there? What's Jesus teaching? Is Jesus teaching that you get saved by getting rid of all your possessions?
[time=2845] Is he teaching that possessions are evil? Is he teaching that rich people can never go to heaven? Is he teaching salvation through philanthropy?
[time=2854] Absolutely not. Here's something I want you to listen to very carefully.
[time=2858] Nowhere else, nowhere else in the Old Testament or the New Testament, does God or Jesus ever ask anybody to sell all their possessions? This is it.
[time=2868] This is not something that Jesus is trying to teach to everybody. This is not how you come to Christ in the truest sense.
[time=2876] What he is doing is he is now going to put his finger on an issue in this guy's life that he hopes will further cause and realize, man, I haven't kept the Ten Commandments and I can't keep the Ten Commandments.
[time=2891] If you wish to be complete, go and sell your possessions given to the poor, then you get to go to heaven. It's an amazing statement.
[time=2900] It's like this. Oh, you think you're the fastest kid in the school? You think, okay, get on the line. We're going to race in just a minute. You'll find out just how fast you are.
[time=2909] No, you want to come out a little late for baseball. You think you, and I think, I said these kinds of things in the coach, you think you can turn the whole thing around?
[time=2916] Well, we're practicing at three. Here's your bat and your glove. Have at it.
[time=2922] Jesus is saying an effect to this guy. Oh, you think you've kept all the commandments. You think you can go to heaven based upon an absolutely staneless, perfect record of obedience to all the commandments I've listed.
[time=2939] That's what you think? Oh, here, let me give you an application. Go sell everything you have and give it to the poor. Follow me. We'll go minister to some people.
[time=2947] It's a gracious, loving, compassionate act from the heart of Christ to try to ring this kid's bell. Not that make him go sell. Money's not bad.
[time=2956] Having wealth is not bad. It has nothing to do with the issue. It is. Are you ready to recognize that you have not loved everyone you've ever seen as yourself?
[time=2965] Well, you at least admit that, and will you admit it out of the context of what you've done with your physical possessions?
[time=2977] Look at verse 22. But when the young man heard this statement, he went away grieved for he was one who owned much property.
[time=2991] He didn't win the race, did he? Lord knew he wouldn't win the race. Lord didn't even want him to win the race.
[time=2997] The Lord wanted to admit that he was losing the race. He wanted him to confess his sin to the notion, keep the commandments.
[time=3007] He wanted that rich young ruler to fall down on his knees and say, "Oh God, from my youth I've been breaking them. There's something wrong inside of me. Can you help me? Can you forgive me? Can you wash me? Can you cleanse me?"
[time=3032] Now, this really isn't a bad deal. Ultimately, the fact that he went away grieved, I wish there was the rest of the story here somewhere, Paul Harvey.
[time=3041] But it's not here. You can't find any more about this rich young ruler in the rest of the New Testament.
[time=3049] But this isn't a total loss here, my friends, because it takes this kind of encounter with the reality. And it doesn't happen all at once.
[time=3060] Giving your life to Christ, while it happens all at once when you finally confess your sin before God and ask him to forgive you.
[time=3067] But coming to that place truly and genuinely in your heart, that doesn't happen the first time you hear that you're a sinner or the first time that you hear you've failed God.
[time=3075] It takes repeated exposure to reality that you failed God till finally your heart breaks and you cry out to be forgiven.
[time=3083] And this likely is one of those kind of encounters, and I hope to meet this guy in heaven.
[time=3090] I hope that this encounter with Christ, he walks away grieved.
[time=3093] My hope is that he thought about it, he pondered it, he saw the truth of it, and he gave his life to Christ.
[time=3099] He stopped saying he could work his way to heaven and he started saying, "God forgive me by your grace through your Son." I don't know if we'll meet him there, but this is not necessarily a total loss in terms of the encounter.
[time=3112] It might have been one of the steps that God is going to use to bring this guy to his knees.
[time=3121] So, Jesus, the Ten Commandments and the Egomaniac.
[time=3129] Two questions for you this morning as I close.
[time=3137] This guy provoking your heart for spiritual things.
[time=3141] Remember this guy came running into a crowd, pushed his way through, found Christ, and blurted this profound spiritual question, "What do I got to do to be saved?"
[time=3150] What was it in his life that provoked that kind of urgency?
[time=3155] We don't know what it was, but I'll promise you whatever it was, it was God at work.
[time=3161] God may have taken his mother or his father or his sister or his wife or his child or whatever.
[time=3169] God is in the business of trying to get our attention off of the mundane, off of the physical, off of the everyday of life.
[time=3178] God is in the business of trying to provoke that question out of our hearts.
[time=3183] And if you're here this morning and God is doing some provoking, that's a good thing.
[time=3190] It's very good to recognize that and say, "God, I really think that behind that disease or behind that death or behind that business failure or behind..."
[time=3198] I think you're behind that.
[time=3200] I think you're trying to get me to lift my eyes off of the horizontal and go just a little bit vertical here.
[time=3207] So my number one question to you this morning is God provoking you?
[time=3211] Is God raising spiritual issues in your life to kind of a heightened awareness?
[time=3218] Thank Him for that. Thank Him for that.
[time=3225] Now my second question to you is, are you willing to admit what this man wouldn't admit?
[time=3233] Are you willing to say, "Hey, guess what? I'm not good enough." Not only haven't I kept the commandments, but I can't keep the commandments.
[time=3242] Remember now, the 10 commandments are not a ladder to spiritual progression.
[time=3250] They are not a stairway to heaven.
[time=3253] They were given to you, as it says in Galatians, to be your tutor.
[time=3261] They're there as your tutor.
[time=3263] God wants to instruct you.
[time=3265] What does He want to teach you? He wants to teach you that you're a sinner and you need to be saved by grace.
[time=3270] It's impossible for you to keep His law.
[time=3273] And He wants to use the 10 commandments to lead you to a place that you cry out to be saved by the grace of God through the death and the resurrection of Christ.
[time=3287] Let me invite you to stay on this morning as we close.
[time=3291] And if you would, just bow your heads for a quiet moment of reflection.
[time=3302] You know, I think back on my life and I realize that in those early years, 10 years of age until 2021 when I got married,
[time=3314] all the stuff I got into, all the trouble I got into.
[time=3319] If I would have just obeyed my parents, I never would have gotten into any of that stuff.
[time=3325] If I would have just honored my parents, even just externally, what about you?
[time=3332] I mean, the boundaries that your parents laid down for you, the kinds of stuff that, I mean, even today, that your parents want you to be involved in.
[time=3343] Is there evidence there that you need to be saved?
[time=3346] Is there evidence there that you need to be forgiven by the grace of God?
[time=3356] Well, this morning, if you'd like to pray and receive Christ as your Savior, I'm going to go ahead and just say a little prayer out loud.
[time=3362] And I'll invite you to say it in your heart.
[time=3365] Say it in your heart and mean it to God. You can get off the treadmill of works.
[time=3371] You can confess that you can't keep the commandments.
[time=3376] You can be saved by the grace of God. If you want to pray it in your heart, pray it like this.
[time=3382] My gracious God and Heavenly Father, I might not be a rich, young ruler, but I am a sinner.
[time=3393] And I have not kept the Ten Commandments, and I cannot keep the Ten Commandments.
[time=3400] And I understand this morning that you never, I mean, you know I can't.
[time=3405] You never intended them in my life for that purpose.
[time=3409] Instead, you wanted them to teach me that I'm a sinner in need of being forgiven.
[time=3415] So please forgive me.
[time=3418] Forgive me for breaking the Ten Commandments. Forgive me for not loving the people in my life as I ought to.
[time=3425] Give me the grace that comes through Christ.
[time=3430] But I might know eternal life. Live with you forever and ever and ever.
[time=3439] Father, we thank you for hearing those prayers.
[time=3442] We thank you for listening to the hearts of those who have done business with you this morning.
[time=3447] Many of us have prayed that kind of thing in days past. Thank you for hearing our prayer when we uttered it.
[time=3453] Thank you for continuing to give us grace, to forgive us day in and day out of all of our sins.
[time=3459] Thank you for giving us the law, the objective rule that shows us how far we fall short.
[time=3466] So that we are not deluded to think that we could earn your pleasure on our own.
[time=3472] We love you and praise you for your grace and for your goodness, pray these things in Christ's name.
[time=3476] And all God's people say.
