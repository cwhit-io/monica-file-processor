[time=41] Is there a God? I mean, if you and I didn't live in America where you just pull a coin out of your pocket and it says in God we trust it's kind of the foundation of our civilization, is there any evidence?
[time=54] Is there any evidence that might lead us to believe in the existence of God?
[time=60] [MUSIC]
[time=67] This is the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church. Thank you for joining us. How do we know there is a God?
[time=74] Is there any evidence that might lead us to believe in the existence of God? In faith has its reasons. Is there a God?
[time=81] Master Moore looks at four arguments that have stood the test of time on the issue of building a case for the existence of God. We hope you'll stay tuned. Now let's join our service.
[time=91] A candy cane can be a great reminder of Jesus. It's shaped like a shepherd's staff and it reminds us that Jesus said, "I am the good shepherd that lays down his life for his sheep."
[time=101] It is also a stretch red and white. No matter how deep the stain of sin, Jesus can take it out. Even if you are as red as crimson, Jesus can make you as white as snow.
[time=111] It tastes good too. The Bible says, "Taste and see that the Lord is good." And when you turn it upside down, it's the letter "J" and that reminds us of Jesus.
[time=120] Every time I see a candy cane hanging on a tree I can't help thinking of the one who gave his life for me.
[time=146] Everything about a candy cane from its color to its shape reminds me of my Savior's love that's why I celebrate.
[time=163] Every time I see a candy cane hanging on a tree I can't help thinking of the one who gave his life for me.
[time=177] Everything about a candy cane from its color to its shape reminds me of my Savior's love that's why I celebrate.
[time=194] I can't help thinking of red and white because it's me my favorite sight. The stretch in my meat, Jesus made the prize.
[time=212] Like a shepherd who protects me from the harmful things in life, they're my journey to be walking by my side.
[time=225] Every time I see a candy cane hanging on a tree I can't help thinking of the one who gave his life for me.
[time=239] Everything about a candy cane from its color to its shape reminds me of my Savior's love that's why I celebrate.
[time=259] A candy cane can taste so sweet, it's my favorite Christmas tree. And I can taste the kindness of our Lord.
[time=273] He has offered to forgive me and to wash me wide as snow.
[time=280] I'm a child now and I want the world to know.
[time=286] Every time I see a candy cane hanging on a tree I can't help thinking of the one who gave his life for me.
[time=300] Everything about a candy cane from its color to its shape reminds me of my Savior's love that's why I celebrate.
[time=321] Next time you see a candy cane hanging on a tree is how long enough to ask yourself if the tree is all you see.
[time=335] Everything about a candy cane from its color to its shape reminds me of my Savior's love that's why I celebrate.
[time=352] And that's why I celebrate.
[time=362] I celebrate.

[time=1072] If we hadn't come from families and homes and parents were for the most part there was at least a general belief in God. If we didn't believe that the Bible is the word of God, if we thought instead it had no real connection to God, just a bunch of religious writings that have been collected through the years. I mean, if all that were true, no America, no parents like that, no belief in the Bible is God's word. Is there any evidence that we could look to?
[time=1101] That would give evidence to the existence and the reality of God. I think there is. And this morning I want to give you just the high points on four classical arguments that have stood the test of time and debate in building a case for the existence of God.
[time=1122] Now, before I build this case or make this argument, I want to remind you of how it is that human beings deem something as reasonable. Faith has its reasons. How is it that human beings go through the process of deeming something as reasonable or unreasonable? Basically, we do it every day. We compile evidence.
[time=1143] And then we consider the evidence, and then we make a decision based upon the weight or in light of the weight of that evidence.
[time=1153] This has been a great week for me to think through some of these things because when I first got exposed to this kind of stuff, this kind of thinking, I rejected it categorically because you know what? You can't prove God.
[time=1164] He's invisible and you can't touch him and you can't hold him. There is no way to prove the existence of God beyond a shadow of a doubt.
[time=1174] And since that was kind of my criteria, proving God beyond the shadow of a doubt, I kind of categorically rejected this kind of thinking.
[time=1182] I don't know if that came from an illustration or a story that I'd heard of some college professor, some atheist college professor in some classroom somewhere who had said, you know, there is no God.
[time=1191] I know there is no God. And if you want me to believe there is a God okay, then God, you come, you strike me dead right now and I'll believe.
[time=1198] I mean, that's kind of like that absolute, of course, but that wouldn't be absolute, would it? Because there might be other explanations as to why he felt that.
[time=1206] God studied some of this this week and there was a different term that was being used. I'd like to submit it to you this morning.
[time=1212] Instead of beyond a shadow of a doubt, why don't we use the phrase or the reality or the concept beyond a reasonable doubt?
[time=1221] Can we make an argument for the existence of God, not beyond the shadow of a doubt?
[time=1228] Can we make an argument for the existence of God beyond a reasonable doubt?
[time=1233] You recognize, of course, that if you were called, many of you will be in the next 12 months, others, have you had been in the last 12 months to be sitting for jury duty right down here in our court systems?
[time=1244] You would be charged with the challenge to weigh all the evidence that is brought during the trial and then to render a guilty, not guilty verdict.
[time=1256] Right? That's be your job. You have to sit there and you have to listen to the evidence and at the end, there's, you know, you got to make a decision, guilty, not guilty.
[time=1264] Now, interestingly, the judge would not ask the prosecuting attorney to prove the case to you, the jury. He would not say beyond a shadow of a doubt.
[time=1276] The standard phraseology that judge would use is this, that the prosecuting attorney must present sufficient evidence to convince the jury beyond a reasonable doubt, a reasonable doubt.
[time=1290] To expect any prosecuting attorney to present enough evidence at a trial to convince all the jurors beyond a shadow of a doubt is deemed by our judicial system to be unreasonable and unrealistic.
[time=1302] That's not how it works. Except in the field of math and formal logic, pretty much all the rest of our lives must be negotiated on determining probability factors.
[time=1317] Sell them. Do we get to make decisions on the basis of so much evidence that we move out with absolute certainty?
[time=1325] For example, this morning you walked into this building. Then you chose a pew and you looked at the pew, it's probably the pew you sit in on a regular basis.
[time=1337] And you recognize, don't you, that you did not have absolute certainty this morning of the ability of that pew to hold your weight?
[time=1344] You based your decision on probability of evidence. It is the same pew. I've never heard of a pew in this church collapsing under anybody's weight.
[time=1353] I don't see any physical evidence that makes me feel that the strength of this pew has in any way been compromised.
[time=1358] That is not absolute certainty. That is probability. And based upon that, like so many other decisions that we make all day long, we sit down and we put our full unguarded weight as we plop in the pew.
[time=1373] You might choose to go to McDonald's today after the service and have a burger. You will there again make a potentially life-threatening decision based upon probability factors not absolute certainty.
[time=1388] Which would have been true if you'd chosen Burger King or Taco Bell. You didn't meet the cow. You don't know the farmer. You don't know how the cow was slaughtered.
[time=1399] You don't know where the cow's meat has been. And you don't even know, very interestingly. You do not even know if they cooked that meat long enough so that the bacteria that could potentially be lethal to you were properly killed.
[time=1413] You don't know that, do you? You do know that people have died in the last year of that very thing in the United States of America.
[time=1422] But what you don't know is is it true of that hamburger at this McDonald today, but you're going to make a decision based upon probability factors.
[time=1431] And it's probably a very sound decision. You're going to make a verdict. It's safe enough for me to eat. You're going to eat.
[time=1441] You weren't when you got married. Absolutely certain of your spouse. You are not right now. Absolutely certain of your job tomorrow morning.
[time=1457] And no matter where you choose to eat this afternoon, you will not be absolutely certain that your lunch has not been poisoned with arsenic.
[time=1465] Okay? It is how we live. We live in the arena of reasonable doubt. We live day in and day out by determining probability factors.
[time=1476] And as I have said, if you take the notion of beyond any shadow of a doubt, absolute total certainty and apply that to any number of the decisions that we have to make on a daily basis, you're in big trouble.
[time=1493] So what I'm going to do this morning is I'm going to address this question. Is there a God from the vantage point of reasonable doubt, not from the vantage point of absolute certainty?
[time=1511] So the question again, if I wasn't born in America, in God we trust. If my parents didn't believe in God, if I didn't believe the Bible was the word of God, can I build a case? Can I build a case to myself that there is a God?
[time=1525] And as I say, it must be understood from the outset that insistence on absolute proof of the existence of God is unreasonable and unrealistic request for a person to make.
[time=1535] Now with that in mind, with that in mind, four classic arguments that have stood the test of time and debate building this kind of argument for the existence of God.
[time=1546] The first one is this. It's called the cosmological. The cosmological argument. I've termed it the cosmological reason because this is a series about faith having its reasons.
[time=1557] And so the question is, are there some cosmological reasons why I might want to believe in the existence of God? And I tell you the truth this morning, I wish I had a jury box up here.
[time=1568] I wish right here and I could get 12 of you to come and sit in the jury box because when you stay theoretical on this stuff, when you put it in the ethereal, when you say, well, you know, and you leave it out there kind of on it, just a mental intellectual level, it's not as convincing.
[time=1583] But if you would please see yourself in the courtroom in a jury box and the question is very clearly put before you, is there any evidence to believe in the existence of God beyond a reasonable doubt?
[time=1597] And the first line of argument I would come to you with is this notion of the cosmological reasons. Cosmas, it means world. Logos, it means reason.
[time=1609] The question is, how do you explain the existence of the world? That would be my first question for you. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, how do you explain the existence of the world on your way here?
[time=1624] You saw trees and you saw grass and you saw bushes and you saw the sun.
[time=1634] Well, I would just take that one by faith.
[time=1637] We'll just believe that it's still out there. Even though we haven't seen it for a great number of days now, and probably won't see it for a great more many days, we'll believe the sun exists.
[time=1648] As I was saying, you saw trees, you saw grass, you saw water. Now, why do they exist? Why do they exist?
[time=1659] Now, here's how the argument goes. You look at everything you can see, and I wanted to find that for purpose of illustration as the sphere inside this building.
[time=1668] This is everything you and I can see with microscopes or telescopes. Every single thing that you and I can comprehend and see or understand that is, is this, it is contingent.
[time=1681] It is dependent on something else for its existence.
[time=1686] You and I cannot find one thing in all the sphere of everything we can discover that is not contingent, that does not depend on something else for its own existence, the obvious ones.
[time=1705] The tree depends upon the air for its existence. Grass depends upon water for its existence, and both of them depend upon the sun.
[time=1714] Now, that is a very unsophisticated argument, and if I were a doctor or wanted to risk more detail, we could go into how a cell works.
[time=1724] We could go into microbiology, we could go into the universe, and there would be people who could articulate very clearly as obviously as a tree needs air, how every single thing is dependent on something else inside this sphere for its existence.
[time=1743] Furthermore, then nothing is independent, nothing is self-reliant, and in fact, everything is in a gradual state of entropy. Everything is disintegrating.
[time=1757] Now, Mr. and Mrs. Jure, if all that you see and comprehend and know about as being an existent is contingent and fragile and fading, please answer this question for me.
[time=1773] Who or what? Either way, who or what is the explanation for all these contingent objects?
[time=1783] There's only two choices for your answer. The person I would be arguing against in the courtroom, I'm going to argue that it's something outside of the sphere.
[time=1795] I don't believe that all this stuff, which everything I know about is contingent and dependent and deteriorating.
[time=1801] I don't believe that anything inside this sphere sustains at all.
[time=1806] I don't believe that the cause or the first cause for everything that I can know about, which is all contingent, I don't believe the first cause is found in the contingent sphere.
[time=1815] I believe it's found outside the contingent sphere.
[time=1820] My, my, my, my arguer, my opponent in the law, and the court is going to say that it happens inside that somehow because if he goes outside, then we're very, very dangerously close to having a God on our hands.
[time=1833] He has got to make his case that somehow everything that we know about, which is contingent, is a result of other contingent things.
[time=1840] That seems illogical to me. Let me say it to you this way.
[time=1843] If everything in the circle is contingent and dependent and fragile and interreliant on other things in the circle, how rational is it to locate the ultimate cause or the first cause of everything inside the circle, whereby definition, nothing in the circle is self-caused?
[time=1862] That's a strong argument.
[time=1865] I mean, if you're not dizzy with the words, it's a strong argument.
[time=1870] Let me read it again.
[time=1872] How rational is it to locate the ultimate cause or the first cause of everything inside the circle, whereby definition, nothing in the circle is self-caused?
[time=1886] Doesn't a thinking person have to conclude that the answer or the explanation for all that exists to lie outside the circle?
[time=1896] And whatever is outside must be non-contingent, must be self-caused, self-reliant, and independent, which would make it what?
[time=1907] Eternal, unlimited, and all-powerful, and those kinds of adjectives come dangerously close to a working definition of God.
[time=1920] So where are you going to land?
[time=1922] And maybe you're not ready to land. Maybe you want to hear more. That's good because I got more.
[time=1926] But at this point, I want you to think, so I've either got a pick that happened within everything that is everything I know about.
[time=1935] Everything is contingent, dependent.
[time=1938] Or I can say, no, I don't believe that all of this happens by something that is itself contingent.
[time=1945] It requires something outside of the sphere that is all-powerful, that is able to cause it all to happen.
[time=1954] Number two, the second argument is what they call the teleological argument.
[time=1961] Teleological argument, and so I say the teleological reasons.
[time=1965] One of the worst things about these arguments is that they're so hard to say.
[time=1969] Teleological, it means order and design.
[time=1974] Order and design. It's one of the strongest of the arguments.
[time=1979] The teleological reasons are these.
[time=1983] How do you account Mr. and Mrs. Jerr for all the intricacies and the symmetry and the purposefulness of the world?
[time=1994] Now we're not asking, how did it get here?
[time=1998] We're asking, how come it's so complex? How come it's so intricate? How come it's all so purposeful?
[time=2010] Philosopher William Pealey wrote this.
[time=2013] Quote, "There simply cannot be a design without a designer.
[time=2019] There cannot be contrivance without a contriver.
[time=2023] There cannot be order without choice." End quote.
[time=2028] You understand what he's saying? He's saying it's impossible to find something that is, well, designed and not have a designer.
[time=2037] Doesn't this kind of thing right here, the steel and all this stuff?
[time=2041] Doesn't this require the notion of somebody that designed it?
[time=2048] Doesn't design itself argue for a designer? Doesn't contrivance or the ability to contrive, argue for a contriver?
[time=2055] Doesn't order, argue for a person who makes choice.
[time=2059] Now my opponent would come to you and he would say, no, it doesn't.
[time=2063] I can answer all of that issue in one word, chance.
[time=2068] If you give chance enough time, then the order that you see can happen accidentally without a designer, without one who has purpose and a vision and a design to create it.
[time=2084] Now you don't need that. All you need is time plus chance.
[time=2089] He would say to you that a chance collision of floating gases out in space set in motion a random series of events that over billions and billions of years finally brought us to the complex state of where we are today.
[time=2106] We've all heard this theory. It is widely held. It is taught in institutions. Now, problem, I would say.
[time=2114] I still haven't heard the explanation for where the floating gases came from in the first place.
[time=2121] If your argument to my jury is that these gases were floating around and enough time transpired, a chance collision of them happened.
[time=2130] My first question is back on this first argument, the cosmologic argument, which is, okay, just one thought, where did those gases come from?
[time=2137] Do we have an origin for those yet?
[time=2142] Now, beings as we'll move along, my next question is, how is it?
[time=2148] I mean, what are the probabilities that these gases and floating things could emerge and eventually produce even a single molecule, let alone something as complex as photosynthesis, for example, or an eagle flying through the air?
[time=2165] What is the probability? I mean, could somebody with some math and statistical ability work this stuff out for me so that I know a little bit more about what I'm saying yes to when you tell me time plus chance?
[time=2177] And the fact is that the scientists that have worked the probabilities on this blush with embarrassment as the numbers exceed your wildest dreams to imagine the probability given that they already existed of them colliding in such a way that life emerged.
[time=2196] Now, I would come at this way, dear Mr. and Mrs. Jure, you know, I'd roll a car right into the courtroom and I'd lift up the hood and I'd say, do you look inside the hood, please notice the wires, do you notice the hoses, do you notice the engine there, do you notice all that stuff?
[time=2215] Now, how many times, if we took all the pieces, multiple pieces, put it all there, stick it in a factory and blow the factory up, how many times will we have to blow the factory up before that engine appeared?
[time=2229] Because that's the question that we're asking. That's what time plus chance says. Time plus chance asks the question, how many times do I have to blow up the automobile factory before automobiles appear?
[time=2243] How many times, another way to say it is, how many times will a tornado have to go through a junkyard before a fully assembled and functioning 747 emerged?
[time=2256] Now, how many times would you have to do that?
[time=2259] See, my mind says, I don't think it matters how many times you do it.
[time=2263] I think you do it. A gazillion, billion, trillion, gazillion, billion, trillion times 10 to the 20th power. I don't think it's going to happen.
[time=2270] I don't think design happens by chance. It just doesn't make sense.
[time=2278] Does that make sense?
[time=2280] Dr. George Walls, the Nobel Prize-winning microbiologist and professor emeritus at Harvard University, concluded this, that it is not just unlikely that life could emerge by chance.
[time=2296] It is impossible. Not improbable. He declared it is impossible.
[time=2303] And I really do wish I had the time. I mean, some of the numbers I came across this week were absolutely astounding when they start to work out the probability of even the assembling of a single molecule.
[time=2322] You can't describe the odds. It's so far-fetched.
[time=2331] Now, Charles Darwin himself, in a chapter entitled "Organs of Extreme Perfection" in his book "Origin of Species."
[time=2341] He said this, quote, "To suppose that the eye with so many parts all working together could have been formed by natural selection seems I freely confess absurd in the highest degree."
[time=2357] And you see, when he looked through his microscope so many years ago, it only would magnify maybe a hundred or two hundred times.
[time=2363] And so he looked at a simple cell, and he thought that simple cell was simple.
[time=2368] And so this wasn't such a far-stretched little imagination thing for him to think that with time that we'd figure out how all that happened.
[time=2374] But you use the technology that we have today, and you find out that a single cell is the...
[time=2380] I mean, it puts some of our most advanced companies and manufacturing systems to absolute shame.
[time=2389] Just a single cell. What he thought was just nothing.
[time=2395] So in other words, the more science has been able to delve into the complexities of what he thought might have been the beginning of life,
[time=2402] the conclusion of scientists is man, the odds are impossible.
[time=2409] So, I would come to you, and I would say, as you contemplate the intricacies of life, the symmetry of life,
[time=2419] the purposefulness of life, things like photosynthesis, things like an eagle flying through the air, or far more dramatic than that,
[time=2427] a thing like a brand-new little baby in your arms.
[time=2431] My question to you today is, does something in your heart agree with William Paley when he said there simply cannot be a design without a designer?
[time=2443] There cannot be contrivance without a contriver, and there cannot be order without a choice.
[time=2450] But to me, that's very convincing.
[time=2453] Very convincing.
[time=2455] To you, if the answer is yes to that question, then you have a whole new appreciation for one of the major arguments for the existence of God.
[time=2464] Doesn't mean you necessarily believe in God yet, but you have a new appreciation for one of the reasons why people think their faith is reasonable.
[time=2472] Now, number three.
[time=2474] Now, we've called this moral reasons.
[time=2477] Moral reasons.
[time=2479] Then we're in the courtroom, and I'm trying to build a case to get you to decide beyond reasonable doubt that there is a God.
[time=2488] And so, I come over to you, and I say, now, Mr. and Mrs. Jer, I have another question I'd like you to think through for me here.
[time=2494] You know, there's over four, almost five billion people in the earth today, and by and large, the vast majority of them all hold the same moral code.
[time=2506] And it doesn't matter what they eat for breakfast, it doesn't matter what they dress, it doesn't matter about their language, it doesn't matter, you know, about whether they're industrialized or if they're third world.
[time=2515] You know what? All these people around the world prefer truth telling over deceitfulness.
[time=2524] Now, where did that come from?
[time=2527] Now, my opponent would come, and he would say that the gases that had chance collision over and over and over again, and the germs and the genes, I mean, that all, this highly universal moral code also emerged.
[time=2544] Through this time plus chance process.
[time=2549] How do we account for the fact that in every culture on the planet, not only in this generation, but in every generation we know about, truth telling was preferred over deceitfulness, kindness is chosen over violence, and loyalty is valued over backstabbing.
[time=2567] And the list could go on. Our gases and germs and genes capable of creating a moral code of values and implanting them in the minds and hearts of people around the world, a consistent morality, billions of individuals all over the world.
[time=2585] As I was working on thinking, trying to learn this argument, think this thing through, my grandfather came to mind, his name was Russell B. Seymour, we called him Kid, and he spent his whole life, basic adult life as an attorney and then a judge.
[time=2597] He was a federal judge, he ruled in bankruptcy courses, cases.
[time=2601] And bankruptcy, as you know, is somebody's got overextended, somebody can't pay their bills, and now we're going to figure out of the remaining assets held by that individual, who's going to get what among the debtors?
[time=2614] And it implies, doesn't it, a sense of morality, a sense of right and wrong, a sense of who loaned and what win, and under what conditions, and under what agreements were made, and what signatures were signed.
[time=2627] I mean, the whole process from beginning to end of dispersing a bankrupt person's assets to his many debtors, which he does not have enough to cover, is the process of trying to weigh people's claims.
[time=2642] The grandfather was an agnostic, he didn't believe in God.
[time=2650] He would say to me, Russell, one thing you never want to do is embarrass or excuse me, correct your wife in public, that was one of his deals.
[time=2658] He's a very moral man.
[time=2661] And one of the codes that he lived by was you never correct your spouse in public.
[time=2668] There's a sense of oughtness to it.
[time=2671] I mean, there was something that rung inside of me when he said, "I think that's a pretty good statement." You ought not do that.
[time=2676] You ought not do that.
[time=2677] Where does the oughtness come from, kid?
[time=2681] This is the question I wish I could ask.
[time=2683] He's dead now.
[time=2684] How is it that you are trying to push your sense of oughtness on me, have you ever taken the time to offer an explanation for why you have a sense of oughtness?
[time=2697] Have you ever taken the time, my grandfather, to answer the question, why do you have a sense of oughtness that guides you through the very technical legal process of dispersing limited assets to multiple claims?
[time=2719] It's a compelling argument.
[time=2721] Where did it come from?
[time=2723] How does it happen?
[time=2725] My mind goes to a moral God, a God that has absolutes, a God that gives the human race a sense of oughtness.
[time=2738] That seems far more plausible to me than that through this time plus chance process emerged this moral code.
[time=2749] Number four, lastly number four, that's what I call the experiential reasons.
[time=2754] There are experiential reasons to believe in God.
[time=2757] Now, as I've tried to say to you, I cannot prove, and I'm not attempting to prove the existence of God beyond a shadow of doubt.
[time=2763] I'm trying to offer thoughts and arguments that may help you come to a place where you could believe in Him beyond a reasonable doubt.
[time=2770] And this, of all the arguments this morning, is likely the weakest, but it has merit.
[time=2776] What do I mean by experiential reasons?
[time=2778] There are people who claim to experience God.
[time=2782] There are people who experience the presence of God, who say they receive guidance from God, who say they are strengthened by God.
[time=2793] Now, again, this is not conclusive.
[time=2795] And my proponent would certainly come to the floor and he would say, "Yeah, well, then let's talk about David Koresh, because he's in the group.
[time=2801] And let's talk about Jim Jones, because he's in the group." And I would admit quickly that there are delusive, unwell, unstable individuals who manufacture religious experience for their own weird purposes,
[time=2815] whether money or just control over people.
[time=2817] That is a given point.
[time=2818] But would you please allow me then to marshal my witnesses to the stand, because I would like to bring doctors from this very community.
[time=2826] I would like to bring lawyers from this very community.
[time=2829] I would like to bring truck drivers from this community, housewives from this community, who grew up in this community, went to school in this community, and who are recognized as stable, rational, whole, healthy people.
[time=2841] And they will file through this witness stand, and they will tell you that they feel the love of God.
[time=2849] They will tell you that they have received forgiveness from this God.
[time=2853] They will even go so far as to say that this God is slowly but surely transforming their lives, the way they think, the way they act, the way they treat people.
[time=2866] Therefore, I don't think that this argument should be dismissed.
[time=2870] Some of you would be the ones I would call.
[time=2874] Some of you live in this community and have lived in this community, and you hold positions for long periods of time,
[time=2880] and people have seen you in the hardships and the stresses and the positive times, and people have seen you in all kinds of different situations, and you would constitute part of the argument for the existence of God,
[time=2893] because you are not delusive, and you are not gathering people to manipulate them for your own personal ends under the name of religion.
[time=2901] You are just living your life, and living it well, and you would speak under oath to the notion and the reality in your life that you experienced the presence of God.
[time=2918] So there they are. Is there a God?
[time=2922] I mean, is there any evidence of a God? Is there anything out there that could help me move to a place beyond reasonable doubt where I would say, you know what, I am convinced.
[time=2935] I believe there is a God.
[time=2940] The first question that you asked yourself is where did all this contingent stuff come from?
[time=2946] If everything I can see and touch and understand and experience is contingent, where did all of it come from?
[time=2951] Does it build a case for an absolute being that put it in place?
[time=2958] The second question you would ask yourself is how can it have so much design?
[time=2963] How can it have as much design as it does without a designer?
[time=2969] The third question you would ask yourself is how come everybody in the world, by and large, holds to the same basic moral code?
[time=2981] Where did that come from?
[time=2986] And then lastly, you might ask yourself how come there are so many solid thinking, normal, rational people who claim that they experience God in their daily lives?
[time=3001] William Durant, one of the great historians of our generation, said this quote, "The greatest question of our time is not communism versus individualism.
[time=3009] It is not Europe versus America. It is not even the East versus the West. It is this, whether man can bear to live without God."
[time=3020] You see, until about 100 years ago, the existence of God was never questioned.
[time=3026] What Will Durant is saying is we are a civilization unique to others where the existence of God is being truly and genuinely questioned and where the notion that there is no God is being embraced by millions.
[time=3042] He is saying that as he has purviewed world history, the big question facing us uniquely is whether or not we can bear to live without God.
[time=3055] Now there have been some who have tried, there have been some who have been very articulate about their philosophical atheism, and they have lived it to the best of their ability.
[time=3065] And what you do is when you read about these men, you find them to be bleak and hopeless and fearful men.
[time=3073] For example, Voltaire said at the end of his life, "Strike out a few sages or wise men, and the crowd of human beings is nothing but a horrible assembly of unfortunate criminals, and the globe contains nothing but corpses.
[time=3089] I tremble to have to complain once more of the being of beings in casting an eye over this terrible picture.
[time=3097] I wish I had never been born." Those are the words of a committed philosophical atheist.
[time=3108] That is where his worldview takes him.
[time=3111] Will Durant says, "The biggest question we face is can we survive?
[time=3116] Can man bear to live without God?" Renan said it this way, "We are living on the perfume of an empty vase."
[time=3125] H.G. Wells, another atheist said this, "There is no way out or around or through it is the end."
[time=3134] Robert Inglesall, another atheist said this, "Life is a narrow veil between the cold and barren peaks of two eternities.
[time=3142] We strive and vain to look beyond the heights. We cry aloud, and the only answer is the echo of our own wailing cry."
[time=3153] The one I like the most, Mark Twain, listen to what Mark said, Mark and Wright, man, and Mark had to think.
[time=3159] He said this, "A myriad of men are born. They labor and sweat and struggle for bread.
[time=3164] They squabble and scald and fight. They scramble for little mean advantages over each other.
[time=3170] Age creeps upon them. Infirmities follow. Shames and humiliations bring down their prides and their vanities.
[time=3177] Those they love are taken from them, and the joy of life is turned to aching grief.
[time=3182] The burden of pain and care and misery grows heavier year by year.
[time=3186] At length ambition is dead, pride is dead, vanity is dead, longing for relief is in their place.
[time=3193] It comes at last, death. The only unpoisoned gift earth ever had for them.
[time=3201] And they vanish from a world where they were of no consequence, where they achieved nothing, where they were a mistake and a failure and a foolishness, where they have left no signs that they have existed,
[time=3212] a world that will omit them a day and forget them forever.
[time=3216] And then another myriad takes their place and copies all they did and goes along the same profitless road
[time=3223] and vanishes as they vanish to make room for another and another and millions of myriads to follow the same arid path through the same desert and accomplish what the first myriad
[time=3233] and all the myriads and myriads after it accomplished.
[time=3236] Nothing.
[time=3240] There is the musing, there is the reasoning. That is where you go when there is no God.
[time=3248] Bertrand Russell said this, that man is the product of causes which have no provision of the end they were achieving,
[time=3258] that his origin, his growth, his hopes and fears, his loves and beliefs are but the outcome of accidental
[time=3267] caucasians of atoms that no fire, no heroism, no intensity of thought and feeling can preserve
[time=3274] an individual life beyond the grave, that all the labors of the ages, all the devotion, all the inspiration,
[time=3281] all the noonday brightness of human genius are destined to extinction in the vast death of the solar system.
[time=3289] And that whole temple of man's achievement must inevitably be burned rather buried beneath the debris of the universe in ruins.
[time=3298] He concludes all these things if not quite beyond dispute are yet so nearly certain that no philosophy which rejects them can hope to stand.
[time=3313] Is there a God? Is there a reason to believe there is a God?
[time=3320] I sure think so.
[time=3321] T.B. Laramor sure thought so.
[time=3324] Listen to his words as he neared the end of his life, a man who had given his life to God in Christ.
[time=3330] He said this, "My faith has never been stronger, my hope has never been brighter, my head has never been clearer,
[time=3338] my heart has never been calmer, my life has never been pure, I love all, I hate none, my love for some lifts my soul into the realm of the sublime.
[time=3347] I am willing to die today, I am willing to live a thousand years to tell the old story of Jesus and his love.
[time=3353] My friends are dear to me, association with them is sweeter to me, my sympathy for suffering souls is stronger,
[time=3360] my love for all the pure, the true, the beautiful, the good and sublime, from the bud, the blossom, the babe, to him, from whom all blessings flow is truer, tender, sweeter than ever before."
[time=3374] He concludes, "I sleep soundly, I dream sweetly, and rejoice evermore."
[time=3386] Let me invite you to stand this morning as we close our service in a word of prayer.
[time=3394] Every service, at the end of every service, through this hole in the brick wall on my left is another room, not the visitor's room,
[time=3403] but what we call the harvest room, and it's a place where there are trained people from our church that would want to help you with any spiritual questions you might have.
[time=3411] Maybe a message like this raises some questions, and there are some folks that are just going to be standing around right through that little slot after the service,
[time=3419] and you don't need an appointment, and you don't need to pay them anything, and you just ask them whatever question you have, and they'll do their best to answer it.
[time=3434] Heavenly Father, as these four arguments are again articulated, my heart resonates with them, and I am convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that you exist.
[time=3448] My decision is in, my verdict is in, I feel better about it every day, and I thank you for it.
[time=3460] And I pray this morning, Lord, for those whose verdict is not in, they're still in deliberation, and that's the place they are today.
[time=3468] That's the place their life has brought them to.
[time=3471] And as they have taken the time this morning to come and listen to this presentation of these four arguments,
[time=3479] I ask that you would be powerful in their life, as you have been in mind, that last argument, the experience of God,
[time=3489] and philosophically the weakest one, but sometimes is the most powerful one in experience and practice.
[time=3494] I pray that you'd make yourself real to these people, that over the intervening days as they ponder some of these questions,
[time=3501] and look for a reasonableness in their own mind that you would assist and aid them.
[time=3506] For you do love them deeply, and you long to be in relationship with them in a unique way through Christ.
[time=3512] And Father, we who are convinced thank you and praise you for that and for the person of Christ.
[time=3518] It's in His name that we pray this morning, and all God's people said.
[time=3523] Amen. God bless you. Thanks for coming.
