[time=759] I'll tell you what, I'll give you the, I'll give you the couple one, two, three definitions, Webster definitions, you try to come up with the word. Are you ready? First, first couple phrases of this definition, one, a legally authorized period of delay, two, a suspension of activity, three, a waiting period set by an authority.
[time=788] Anybody know the word? Moratorium. All right, try again, now you're catching on. One, right or parek, parek, parek, parek was it of a sovereign, two, regal character or bearing, three, a privileged class. What's the word? You're all sleeping, aren't you? Did you have your coffee?
[time=814] Word is royalty. Now you're thinking to yourself, Russell, what does this have to do with our topic this morning? The answer, absolutely nothing. Just thought I'd kind of try it. Let balloon. Okay, now, the next word does have something to do with our message this morning. So listen very carefully. What word does this definition describe? One, it is one and only.
[time=838] Two, it is different from any other. Three, it has no equal. One and only, different from any other and it has no equal. What word comes to your mind? Heidi, just kidding. Yeah, okay, still trying aren't I?
[time=858] We'll get you awake. Yes, unique, you had it. The word unique. The word unique. Now this morning we're continuing in our series, faith has its reasons. Last week we looked at this question, is there a God?
[time=873] This morning we're going to take up the question, is the Bible true? Now the connection between last week and this week is this. If God exists, I mean, if as a result of last week, you're a little more open to the notion that
[time=887] a God actually exists. The question comes, how can we get to know him? What is he like? What is he not like? What is his character? How does he think? What is his plan? Why did he create us? Where are we going? How does this whole thing come to an end? How will we ever know the answers to those kinds of questions if he doesn't tell us these things?
[time=914] Now first of all, I believe that God is. Secondly, I'll just admit right up front, I believe that God has spoken to us and I believe that he has spoken to us in the Bible.
[time=925] Now, as I mentioned, I'm going to try to build an argument for the fact that I believe that the Bible is God's Word and the argument I'm going to build will not withstand the test of beyond a shadow of a doubt.
[time=938] I cannot prove to you that this book is in reality God's Word, quote unquote, beyond a shadow of a doubt.
[time=946] But I'd like to build a case that might lead you to conclude within a reasonable doubt, as if you were asked to try a case down in the courthouse there in Allen County Seat.
[time=957] Beyond a reasonable doubt, is there evidence that can be marshaled? Is there an argument that can be built that would help us understand or comprehend and/or believe this in fact to be God's Word?
[time=969] And the whole argument I'm going to build this morning centers around this Word unique, this notion of uniqueness.
[time=977] And here's what I want to say to you. I believe that by the time we're done here, you're going to find that the Bible is truly unique from any other book.
[time=986] It is in fact one and only of its kind. It is different from any other book that has ever been written, and in fact it has no equal.
[time=995] That's my argument. You see, if I can build a case this morning for the uniqueness of the Word of God.
[time=1003] Now, before I build a case for the uniqueness, I want to admit that in many ways the Bible is not unique. It is very, very common.
[time=1012] In other words, when you use the five senses, this Bible looks very common. It is. I mean, it's made out of ink and paper.
[time=1020] It has a cover. It has an index. It has a table of contents. And that sense, this Bible, as any other Bible, is utterly common.
[time=1030] Common paper, common ink, common cover. When you look at it or rather read it, you open its pages. You know what? It's common stuff.
[time=1041] You don't suddenly look into a page and read a scenario about some enemy army attacking Israel.
[time=1047] And the Bible itself doesn't begin to metamorphize. And visions and characters begin to explode out of the book.
[time=1053] It's very common when you read it. You don't see pictures. You don't hear sounds. Things don't fly out of it.
[time=1059] Certain verses don't begin to glow because, you know, it's God's Word. Now, it's very common in that sense.
[time=1065] You smell it. It smells like any other book. It smells like ink and paper. And if you've left it around a long time, it smells like dust.
[time=1073] And I imagine if you were to eat it, it would taste like any other book.
[time=1078] So in a very real sense, before I begin to build a case for the uniqueness of the Word of God, I want to admit up front and clarify.
[time=1085] I am not talking about the way it looks, the way it reads, the way it feels, the way it smells, or the way it tastes.
[time=1091] It's utterly common in that regard. But in eight other ways, in eight other ways, the Bible is utterly unique.
[time=1102] It is one of a kind. It is not like any other. It is distinctive. Let me try to explain these eight ways.
[time=1110] First of all, it is unique number one in its composition. It's composition. And I mean by that, how it got put together.
[time=1117] Did you know that the Bible was written over a period of 1,600 years?
[time=1124] You see some of these massive novels in the book story. What a minute. How long took the guy to write that?
[time=1130] You know, two years, three years, four years. It took 1,600 years over 60 generations to compile this thing we call the Bible.
[time=1140] It was written by over 40 authors. Among them, a political leader, a fisherman, a herdsman, military officers,
[time=1146] cupbears, prime ministers, doctors, kings, tax collectors, a rabbi, compiled over 1,600 years,
[time=1155] written by 40 different authors living in three different continents, Asia, Africa, and Europe.
[time=1163] One person put it this way. The writers themselves were a heterogeneous, meaning vastly diverse number of people.
[time=1172] Not only separated from each other by hundreds of years and hundreds of miles, but belonging to the most diverse walks of life.
[time=1180] In their ranks, we have kings, herdsmen, soldiers, legislators, fishermen, statesmen, courtiers, priests, prophets,
[time=1189] a tent maker, a rabbi, a gentile physician, not to speak of others of whom we know nothing apart except for their writings.
[time=1197] Many of the authors we know nothing about except that they wrote and contributed to the Bible.
[time=1202] The writings themselves belong to a great variety of literary types. I mean, when you examine from a literary sense,
[time=1210] what kind of writing is it? You'll find that it spans the spectrum of law, history, religious poetry,
[time=1218] didactic treaties, lyric poetry, parable allegory biography, personal correspondence, letters back and forth, personal memoirs and diaries.
[time=1230] It is utterly unique in its composition. 1,600 years, 40 authors, three continents.
[time=1236] And here's what I find so remarkable about it. The Bible talks about highly controversial subjects.
[time=1243] It talks about capital punishment. It talks about the origin of the world.
[time=1247] It gives morality. I mean, these are things that people argue about all the time.
[time=1252] But if you study the Bible, you will find that over a 1,600-year period from three different continents,
[time=1258] 40 different authors from all different walks of life completely agree on the controversial issues the Bible addresses.
[time=1266] There is a continuity and a harmony and a unity of thought that makes this particular book absolutely unique.
[time=1275] It is different than any other book that has ever been written in its compilation.
[time=1281] Secondly, let me tell you about it. It's circulation. It's circulation.
[time=1286] How many books did you sell? How many copies have they printed?
[time=1290] The Bible is without question the single most published book in the history of the world. Did you know that?
[time=1303] Billions of Bibles have been published over the years and tens of millions will be published and circulated this year around the world.
[time=1314] At one point the British and foreign Bible society had to publish one Bible every three seconds,
[time=1322] every minute of every day in order to keep up with the demand for Bibles.
[time=1327] That's about 32,000 copies a day, 365 days of the year.
[time=1333] One person said it this way, the Bible has been read by more people and published in more languages than any other book.
[time=1340] There have been more copies produced of its entirety and more portions and selections than any other book in history.
[time=1349] Overall, there is absolutely no book that reaches or even begins to compare to the circulation of the Scriptures.
[time=1357] In fact, the first major book printed on the first printing press ever invented was, you guessed it, the Bible.
[time=1368] Number three, it is unique in its translation. It is unique in translation and here's what I mean by that.
[time=1376] The Bible is the single most translated book of any book in the history of the world.
[time=1382] No other book has been translated from its original language into other dialects and other languages than any book in the history of the world.
[time=1392] It has in fact been translated into over 1,200 different languages or dialects.
[time=1399] And there is at this moment an army of translators working all around the world to yet bring it into people's languages who do not have a copy of it.
[time=1410] It is an ongoing effort. It is an amazing thing.
[time=1415] No other book, nothing by Aristotle, nothing by Plato, nothing by Darwin, nothing by any other author even comes close
[time=1425] to the number of translations that the Bible has undergone.
[time=1429] And in that sense, it is utterly and completely unique.
[time=1433] Number four, the Bible is unique in what we'll call its reliability or its historicity.
[time=1440] In other words, the Bible is so old, several thousand years old.
[time=1446] The question is raised. It's been passed down generation to generation.
[time=1450] And for a great number of those thousands of years, there was no printing press.
[time=1455] And so that copy was made by hand.
[time=1458] How can we be sure that what we read today is what the author wrote when he wrote it 2,000 years ago, 3,000 years ago, or 4,000 years ago?
[time=1469] In other words, how can I trust it to be reliable to the author's original writings?
[time=1475] That's a good question, isn't it?
[time=1477] Well, let me tell you this. This may not surprise you by now, but there is more manuscript evidence to support the Bible
[time=1485] that it has been responsibly passed down, that what you read today is what the author originally wrote
[time=1492] than any other piece of ancient literature in the world.
[time=1497] No other piece of ancient literature, no other book coming from the eras in which the Bible comes
[time=1505] has more manuscript evidence, more copies of copies of copies that can be compared to each other still
[time=1512] extant to review whether or not this English version of Plato is really what he wrote.
[time=1518] There is no other book in the Bible that has as much, excuse me, no other book in the world that has as much manuscript evidence to support its reliability than the Bible.
[time=1527] For example, you went to college, many of us go to college.
[time=1530] We go to college, we go to college, we got to read Plato, we got to read Aristotle.
[time=1533] These are the biggies. These are the guys that have affected Western thought in an enormous way.
[time=1538] And nobody, as the professor makes that assignment, stands up and questions the content of the work of Plato or Aristotle,
[time=1545] the reliability or the historicity of Plato or Aristotle.
[time=1550] They just take it for granted that it's been passed down responsibly.
[time=1554] They take it at face value, and in fact what they read is what was written.
[time=1558] Do you realize that there are less, listen to this, less than 10 existing copies of the ancient handwritten manuscripts
[time=1568] to compare for accuracy and transmission quality when it comes to Plato and Aristotle?
[time=1574] There are only 10 at most to compare to make sure that what you got as a textbook in college was what Plato wrote,
[time=1582] was what Aristotle wrote. You see this book right here?
[time=1585] This book is supported by no less than 1,400 manuscripts,
[time=1593] by which we compare to cross check to evaluate the accuracy and the transmission quality of this text throughout the centuries.
[time=1603] That, by the way, is largely due to the Jews who have so, through the centuries,
[time=1609] valued this book, that when they would transcribe it, they wouldn't just have somebody like cross reference them,
[time=1616] and you know, like you have somebody else read your letter to see for typos, they would not only count every word in the original and then every word in their copy,
[time=1625] they would count every letter in the original and then every letter in the copy.
[time=1632] There's just been this zealous, incredible effort on the part of the Jews to do this.
[time=1638] So, for example, of the sum 184,000 words that are in the New Testament,
[time=1644] I mean, if you were to count up all the words in the New Testament, you'd find there's 184,594.
[time=1650] 400 of them are disputed.
[time=1653] Only 400, not paragraphs, not sentences, not chapters, 400 words of the nearly 200,000 words that make up the New Testament are disputed,
[time=1664] and none of the 400 words that are disputed have any effect on any major doctrine or teaching in the Scriptures.
[time=1671] They are incidental, peripheral words that if you take it this way or that way, it does not affect the major doctrine or teaching that comes from God's Word.
[time=1681] Now, the Bible is utterly unique in its reliability.
[time=1685] No other ancient manuscript can even get close to claiming 1400 copies.
[time=1693] To verify its reliability as we read it in the English text.
[time=1697] It's pretty amazing stuff.
[time=1699] Number five, the Bible is utterly unique in its accuracy.
[time=1706] It is utterly unique in its accuracy.
[time=1708] Now, what do I mean by that? It's different than the last point.
[time=1711] How does the Bible record when the Bible talks about actual historical events?
[time=1715] It talks about people, it talks about places, it talks about events.
[time=1719] How does the biblical record of what happened compare to non-biblical,
[time=1725] just basic historical records of that same event?
[time=1729] When the Bible describes an historical event and a history book from that era describes the same event, how do they compare?
[time=1738] Well, for years, people have attempted to discount the Bible.
[time=1743] Because, for example, the Bible speaks long and often about an enemy nation of Israel called the Hittites in the Old Testament.
[time=1751] If you read the Old Testament, you'd find over and over and over again the nation of Israel crashing in and doing battle with the nation of the Hittites.
[time=1760] Problem, search history books all you want.
[time=1764] You will find no trace of evidence to support the existence of the Hittite nation
[time=1770] in that region of the world in that period of time.
[time=1774] And so people throughout time who wanted to discredit the word of God would say, "See, you can't believe that this is really God speaking to you because in there is a description of the Hittites and we can't find any trace of them in history books."
[time=1791] Well, in 1906, an archeological dig confirmed the existence of the Hittites
[time=1799] and the word of God, the Bible was vindicated.
[time=1802] They unearthed the capital city of the Hittites and 40 other cities that made up the Hittite nation.
[time=1809] So for a long, long time people thought they had the Bible over the barrel on that one and said, "You know, where are the Hittites?" And then comes 1906, the capital city is revealed through this archeological dig and 40 other cities that were the Hittites.
[time=1822] Another example of that, in Daniel chapter 5.
[time=1825] The king of Babylon, the Bible says, is Belchazar.
[time=1829] If you read Daniel 5, you'll find that the king of the historical Babylon at that particular period of history was named Belchazar.
[time=1837] When you read the history books, you don't find Belchazar's name.
[time=1840] You find a man by the name of Nebuchadnezzar.
[time=1844] And they're saying, "See, there it is again." The Bible is missing its reality point.
[time=1850] We know from history the man's name was Nebuchadnezzar, but the Bible has the wrong name, you can't trust the Bible.
[time=1856] It simply isn't accurate until 1956.
[time=1860] There was an archeological dig in that area, and it unearthed three stones, and on these stones were inscripted the rest of the story.
[time=1869] Nebuchadnezzar was in fact king according to these stones of Babylon in that period, but he went away to fight an extensive battle on foreign territory.
[time=1879] And in his extended absence, he appointed his son to be king of Babylon. Guess what his son's name was?
[time=1886] Belchazar. Belchazar.
[time=1890] And so it is as if with time and the further discovery and the improvement of history, the Bible isn't found to have greater and greater possibilities for air.
[time=1902] It seems with the passing of time and the unearthing of more evidence, the Bible is justified. It is exonerated from potential claims against its potential inaccuracies.
[time=1914] Some still exist. There are still places in the Old Testament where things are said to have happened that historical records says is different.
[time=1921] But the path that we've been on so far in history is that there's either a way to reconcile those things.
[time=1928] It's just a lack of information, and the Bible proves itself to be true over and over and over again.
[time=1935] Let me give you a sixth category. This is amazing.
[time=1939] To me, the Bible is utterly unique in science.
[time=1944] It is unique in science. Now the Bible is not a book about science.
[time=1947] The Bible is not a science book. The Bible makes no claim to giving technical scientific definitions or explaining the universe and stars and stuff like that.
[time=1958] But when it does make reference to the things of science, it is unbelievably accurate, and it is accurate about things which were not discovered scientifically for thousands of years. For example, thermodynamics.
[time=1975] The law of thermodynamics is the law of conservation of mass and energy. The law of thermodynamics says that nothing really ultimately is ever destroyed, right?
[time=1987] Now we've discovered that scientifically. It's a relatively modern concept.
[time=1992] Yet thousands of years prior to it being discovered and stated scientifically in the scriptures, the book of Isaiah, chapter 40 verse 26 says that it is God that creates things and it is God who holds them together by the power by His power and not one of them ever fails. Did you hear that?
[time=2012] God has created these things. It is God who holds them together by His power and not one of them ever fails.
[time=2020] Nehemiah said of God, you have made heaven and earth and all things in the seas, here it is, and all things in them, you hold them all together.
[time=2032] Ecclesiastes raises the question, is there anything of which it may be said this is new? Answer.
[time=2040] Ecclesiastes says everything has been from old time.
[time=2044] Thousands of years prior to scientifically discovering the law of thermodynamics, the scriptures affirms the conservation of mass and energy.
[time=2056] I find that very interesting. Let me give you another example from science. The second law of thermodynamics, that while mass and energy, though always conserved, is nonetheless being broken down, it is constantly breaking down. Order is going to disorder. Cosmos is going to chaos. System is going to non-system. The Bible says as much. In Romans chapter 8 it talks about the fact that the earth has been put under a curse and that it is groaning. It is falling apart. It is going from order to disorder. Another example, the science of hydrology, the cycle of water. And you know that.
[time=2096] It basically goes, as you know, from the sea through evaporation to the clouds. The clouds are moved over the land. They drop their water through and it comes down as rain. The rain runs in creeks. The creeks run into streams.
[time=2108] The streams run into the ocean, back into the sea, and the thing goes over again like that.
[time=2112] The evaporation process begins again. So that's called, we know, the hydrological cycle. Notice evaporation, transportation, and precipitation. Well, did you know that it was described in the scriptures?
[time=2124] Thousands of years before the scientific evidence or terminology was placed on it. In Isaiah chapter 55 and Ecclesiastes 1, the entire water cycle is given in those two chapters. Ecclesiastes 1, Isaiah chapter 55. In Job 36 it speaks of evaporation and interestingly condensation. Excuse me, condensation.
[time=2148] This is thousands of years prior to scientific discovery.
[time=2152] The Bible is unique. I know of no other ancient document that without even intending to, but in the process of talking about the history of a particular nation and talking about God, ends up intersecting with scientific truth and describing it perfectly and accurately long before it was ever discovered. I could go on.
[time=2172] The field of astronomy. In 1473 to about the middle 1500s when Copernicus presented the idea that the earth was in motion, people were astounded because they believed it was like a record. It was a disc. It was flat.
[time=2188] And if you went through the pillars of Hercules at the rock of Gibraltar, you'd fall off the earth. Then along came men like Kepler and Galileo in the 17th century and gave birth to the modern astrology.
[time=2200] Prior to that, there was this confused idea that we were a flat disc and above us, oh maybe a thousand, forty-four, maybe a thousand fifty-six stars. That's all everybody thought was up there.
[time=2212] Oh, a thousand, forty-four to a thousand, fifty-six stars. That's all there is.
[time=2216] Listen to what the Bible says about this stuff. In Isaiah 55-9, it says that the heavens are so high that they are immeasurable. In Genesis, it equates the number of the stars of heaven with the number of grains of sand in the sea, meaning they are innumerable. Jeremiah said that the stars can't be counted. And now we know there are probably a hundred billion stars in our galaxy alone. Now how is it that this ancient book? Everybody else counts. Oh, there's a thousand.
[time=2252] These prophets, writing in the Old Testament, say, no, that's innumerable. You'll never count them all. And the bigger our telescopes get and the more powerful they get and the further they probe to space, the more resounding comes the message from the scientists, we will never count them all. That makes the Bible unique.
[time=2276] It's interesting to know that the oldest book in the Bible is Job. Not actually, Genesis is the first, as you read the Bible, but Job is the oldest. It predates Christ, the life of Christ by a couple thousand years. Now in that book, Job 26-7, it says that God hangs the earth on nothing.
[time=2296] That's what it says. Job 26-7, "He hangeth the earth on nothing." What did Job get that idea? See, that's an amazing statement when you stop and think that you can read other sacred books of other religions that say the earth is on the back of elephants. And it's when the elephants move, that causes the earthquakes.
[time=2316] You can read Greek mythology which says that the earth is on layers of honey and butter and sugar.
[time=2324] Other ancient literature comes up with their explanations for how the earth stays where it is. The Bible says God hangs it on nothing.
[time=2336] It's an amazing thing. Another thing from the book of Job, I find this so intriguing.
[time=2340] He says that the earth is turned like the clay to the seal. Not a seal as in a ocean-going deal. A seal as in your signature.
[time=2352] And you say, "How'd that work?" Well, there was soft clay. You couldn't write your name in the sink. If you're going to sign a document, you had to put some soft clay on there.
[time=2360] And then you had a cylinder. And in the middle of the cylinder ran a stick.
[time=2364] And on the cylinder was your name. And so like, you know, a rolling pin thing in the kitchen, you would roll your seal over that soft clay and it would imprint your signature in it. The signature raised on the cylinder through it was a stick so that it could be rolled like a rolling pin.
[time=2384] As Job said, the earth is turned like the clay to the seal, which means what? It rotates on its axis.
[time=2392] Now, how is all this happening? How does this guy, the first author of the book of the Bible, the oldest book of the Bible?
[time=2400] How does he come up with this stuff? How does he know that God hung the earth in space? How does he know that the earth, and he probably doesn't, but his statements reveal what we now know to be true that the earth is turning on its axis. Job also describes the earth as a, the Hebrew word is clog, and it means sphere. Long before Job knew it was a sphere, he was saying it was a sphere. Galileo, of course, discovered it years and years. Here's another one. Listen to this. Galileo discovered this that God gives weight to the wind. The Bible says God gives weight to the wind. There was no way to measure weight to the wind in Job's day. It is interesting also that the earth has perfect balance. You know, like a basketball, I've ever seen a basketball out of around, and it just begins to do this, and if the earth were not perfectly balanced, we'd be catapulted into space. The earth is a perfect sphere, and it is perfectly balanced. The depths of the sea have to be balanced with the height of the mountains. The weight of the mountains have to be balanced with the weight of the waters. That is called the science of isostices. It's an incredible thing, but way back in Isaiah chapter 40, centuries before the science of isostices was ever even described, Isaiah says, God measures the weights in the hollow of his hand. He measures the heavens with the span. He comprehends the dust of the earth in a measure, and he weighs the mountains in scales and puts the hills in a balance. Now go figure.
[time=2496] Go figure. That's amazing.
[time=2500] That is amazing. What am I trying to say?
[time=2504] I believe that there are reasons to establish good sound factual historical reasons to establish the Bible as a unique book.
[time=2516] There is no other book like it. It has no equal in these regards. I'm probably killing you, but I've got to go one more. It is interesting to me, this one author says this, that Herbert Spencer died in 1903 he received many prizes for his scientific research.
[time=2536] He was given one particular accolade for discovering the five categories of the knowable. Now some of you have heard this before.
[time=2544] The five categories of the knowable, that is everything that can be known can be placed in one of five categories. Everything is either time, force, action, space, or matter. So said Herbert Spencer.
[time=2560] Everything can fit in there somewhere. Everything that is can fit in time, force, action, space, or matter. He dies in 1903, hailed as a genius for having discovered that categorization of all things in existence in the universe.
[time=2576] Now I don't think you realize that the very first book of the Bible, Genesis 1-1 says this, "In the beginning, that's time, God, that's force, created, that's action, that heavens, that space, the earth, that's matter." It's already there. First verse of the first book of the Bible. The Bible is an amazing book. And while it does not choose to speak in scientific terminology, here's the point.
[time=2608] It makes no scientific inaccuracies.
[time=2612] Number seven.
[time=2616] This one is even more astounding than the previous.
[time=2620] The Bible is unique in prediction. The Bible is unique in its ability to predict things to happen before they happen and then to see them happen exactly like the Bible said they would. Now we could drown ourselves in this morning.
[time=2636] I want to give you a couple examples. Number one about Christ.
[time=2640] Do you realize that there are 332 specific predictions about the person of Christ given in the Old Testament? Hundreds of years before he is ever born and all of those predictions were absolutely and specifically fulfilled in his life.
[time=2656] Did you hear that? 332 predictions about an individual given hundreds of years before he is born and they are fulfilled in his life and his death and his resurrection. In other words, in print before Christ ever showed up by a couple hundred years was his lineage the city in which he would be born, the manner in which he would be born, the kind of ministry he would carry out in his life how he would live, how he would die, and that he would rise again from the dead.
[time=2684] You know any other ancient books that kind of make those sweeping predictions about an individual and then several hundred years later, see them perfectly fulfilled. Here's another one.
[time=2696] 150 years before this individual was born the Bible predicted that a man would be born by the name of Silas that he would rise to power in the Middle East and that he would grant the Jews to be released from their captivity.
[time=2712] Isaiah said that in chapter 44. He said all that stuff.
[time=2716] 150 years later a man was born.
[time=2720] His name was Silas. He became king and he released the Jews exactly like the prophets he said he would 150 years before.
[time=2732] You know what? The Bible is unique. In Ezekiel one more here. In Ezekiel 26, God said to the prophets that the city of Tyre would be destroyed. He went further than that.
[time=2748] He made a prediction that not only would it be destroyed but a conqueror would come and wipe out that city. And then the city would be scraped clean and everything left on the city surface would be thrown into the ocean. You get the prediction?
[time=2764] A particular city, a specified city, the city of Tyre. A conqueror is going to come. A conqueror will conquer and then destroy and then do what conquerors never do. The conqueror will throw the rubble of the city into the ocean. Now why?
[time=2780] Why would a guy ever do that?
[time=2784] And the Bible went on to say that a city would never be built on that site again for the rest of the history of the world.
[time=2792] That's what I call a pretty tough prediction to fake.
[time=2796] Let's start at the back and move to the front. Right now there is no city on the location where Tyre was at that time. There is no city and there has never been a city since it was destroyed.
[time=2808] You can go to the ruins of Tyre and see them this day. There is no city and there has never been a city and there has never been a rebuilding of the city. Now that's interesting because Jerusalem has been destroyed and rebuilt 17 times in its history and Tyre has never been rebuilt. That's because the Bible says Jerusalem will always be a city and the Bible says Tyre will never be a city.
[time=2832] Now the prediction of this great conquer was fulfilled in Nebuchadnezzar who came and he did exactly what the Bible said he would do. He destroyed the city. He sieged it for 13 years and then he finally smashed the walls down and protection in that day and age was through your walls. They were 150 feet high and 15 feet thick. Those were the dimensions of the city of Tyre. He crushed the city. Problem. When he came in to take the spoil from the city, there was nothing there. Why?
[time=2864] Because Tyre was built on the coast and it was inhabited by the Phoenicians and the Phoenicians had boats and how this missed Nebuchadnezzar's notice I have no idea but they got in their boats and they went a half a mile out into the ocean where there was this island and they had reestablished their civilization on that island during this 13 year siege and Nebuchadnezzar didn't even know about it.
[time=2888] Nebuchadnezzar, he breaks through the walls but there was nothing to get. He had no navy so he left.
[time=2896] And to that degree the prophecy went unfulfilled.
[time=2900] But 250 years later a man by the name of Alexander the Great came through. The son of Philip the Macedon. He was moving east to conquer the world.
[time=2912] He came into that area and he needed supplies for his some 50,000 troops. He wanted the city of Tyre to provide it but they were still out on that island.
[time=2924] He had no ships. So what did he do?
[time=2928] He had his army pick up the rubble that Nebuchadnezzar had made of the city. He made him throw it into the ocean in a very organized way, made a cause way and marched out there and slaughtered 60,000 of them took their spoil and left.
[time=2944] Just exactly like the Bible said, what happened?
[time=2948] There's a city called Tyre. It'll be conquered by a conqueror.
[time=2952] It'll be flattened. Then its remains will be thrown into the sea and there will never be a city on that premise again for all of history.
[time=2960] Today there's no city. Today its ruins are in the ocean.
[time=2964] They were put there by Nebuchadnezzar. They were, excuse me, by Alexander the Great.
[time=2968] They were first destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar. Do you know any other ancient books that make those kinds of predictions and see them fulfilled? I don't.
[time=2980] We'll breathe a sigh of relief. We're on number eight.
[time=2984] The Bible is unique in its influence.
[time=2988] The Bible is unique in its influence. It can safely be argued that no one single book has had a greater impact on humanity at large than the Bible. People have tried to wipe it out.
[time=3000] People have tried to discredit it. People have tried to destroy it.
[time=3004] But the Bible, unlike any other book in history, prevails. One man put it this way.
[time=3012] Unbelievers for 1,800 years have been refuting and overthrowing this book and yet it stands today as solid as a rock.
[time=3020] Its circulation increases and it is more loved and cherished and read today than ever before. When the French monarch proposed the persecution of the Christians in his dominion, an old statesman and warrior said to him "Sire, the church of God is an anvil that has worn out many hammers." So the hammers of the unbelievers have been pecking away at this book for the ages, but the hammers are worn out and the anvil still endures. If this book had not been the book of God, men would have destroyed it long ago. Emperors and popes, kings and priests, princes and rulers have all tried their hand at it, but they have died and the book itself still lives.
[time=3064] Another author said this, "A thousand times over the death now of the Bible has been sounded. The funeral possession has formed.
[time=3072] The inscription has been cut on the tombstone. The committal has been read, but somehow the corpse never stays put. No other book has been so chopped, knived, sifted, scrutinized and villainized. What book on philosophy or religion or psychology or letters of classical or modern times have been subject to such a mass attack as the Bible?
[time=3096] With such venom and skepticism, with such thoroughness and erudition upon every chapter, line and tenet, and yet the Bible is still loved by millions, it's read by millions, and it's studied by millions." So, as we try to draw this thing to a close this morning, let me just restate my proposition, the Bible is unique.
[time=3124] The Bible is one and only, it is different from all of the books and it has no equal in terms of books. Because of its composition, its circulation, its translation, its reliability, its accuracy as it relates to science and its ability to predict the future and its influence on mankind.
[time=3148] Now, I want you to consider one last thing before we go.
[time=3152] Why? Why is this book so unique?
[time=3158] Why is this book unlike any other book?
[time=3162] Well, the Bible makes some claims for itself. I want you to read them.
[time=3166] Timothy here says this.
[time=3170] Now, this is the Bible talking about itself.
[time=3174] All Scripture is inspired by God.
[time=3178] It is profitable, therefore, for teaching, reproof, correction, training.
[time=3182] The word I want you to focus on is inspired by God.
[time=3186] This, the unique book of all history, when you open its pages and you say to yourself, why are you so unique?
[time=3194] Why are you different than every other book that has ever been written?
[time=3198] The Bible answers the question with this claim for itself that is, in fact, inspired by God. That's why it's unique.
[time=3206] Look at 2 Peter up here, verse 1. You'll see it. The Bible says it again for itself.
[time=3214] The text says, "For no prophecy," meaning the scriptures, "was ever made by an act of human will, but men who were moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God." The Bible would say to you, as you ask the question, why are you so unique? It would say, because I am inspired by God, men wrote me, but only as they were moved by the Holy Spirit, which is why they could intersect with scientific thoughts long before they were scientifically discovered with perfect accuracy. Because the God of science was writing this book through these mere mortals.
[time=3258] So, I believe the Bible is unique. That's almost undisputable, isn't it? That's just fact. Now, the question where we move out of fact and into reasonable doubt is why? And the Bible offers an answer.
[time=3270] It is because it is inspired. It was written by men who were moved by God himself. One last claim the Bible makes for itself. Hebrews chapter 4 verse 12. And this is where you get involved.
[time=3282] This is where I get involved. Listen to this. The Word of God is living and active. Now you say, is it living? Does it grow?
[time=3290] Living and does it grow? Does it get up and walk? Does it do what living, growing, active things do? No, it's common in that regard. We already admitted that to you. What does it mean?
[time=3298] In what way is it living? In what way is it active? Well, keep reading.
[time=3302] It's sharper than a two-edged sword, piercing as far as division of the soul and the spirit, the joints and the moral and able to judge the thoughts and the intentions of the heart.
[time=3314] It is living and active as it intersects with your mind and your heart, the thoughts and intentions of your heart.
[time=3322] That is where the Bible is alive. That is where God's word will speak to you in a way that no other book will ever speak to you. I want to close with this challenge.
[time=3334] You'll never know that for yourself unless you what?
[time=3338] Read it.
[time=3342] Have you ever read it? I'm not the whole thing.
[time=3346] How about one book? Have you ever read one book of the Bible?
[time=3350] Now you've heard lots of people say lots of things to you about it. Maybe you've formed opinions upon it based on what people have said about. But I'm asking you a question.
[time=3358] If this book is the most unique book in the history of the world, do you ever hear it? You're reading?
[time=3366] And if there's an outside chance, maybe a reasonable doubt that the reason it's the most unique book that has ever been written is because it's God.
[time=3374] Speaking to us, doesn't it merit your reading?
[time=3378] I think it does. I want to challenge you to read the book of John. It's in the New Testament.
[time=3386] If you don't have a Bible, you call our church, we'll get you a Bible. Free of charge.
[time=3390] And if you will spend 30 days reading this book, 15 minutes a day, starting the book of John, just read it for 30 days in a row, 15 minutes each day, and then you make your own decision about this fact of it's being living and active.
[time=3406] You put the final litmus test on this thing and say well, okay, if it is God's Word, it claims to be alive and active.
[time=3414] It claims to be able to speak to my mind and my heart in a very unique way.
[time=3418] And if it doesn't do that at the end of 30 days, then okay, fine, you've made your decision. It's unique for another reason and we don't know what that is, but it's not because it's God's Word.
[time=3430] I challenge you. I'll give you my own personal testimony on this thing that I have never, ever, ever, ever in all my life read a book that can speak to my heart, speak to my mind the way this one does.
[time=3446] I believe it is the God's Word. I believe it is alive.
[time=3450] I believe it is active. But I didn't believe that until I read it myself. So take the challenge.
[time=3458] Is there a God? I think there is.
[time=3462] And if there is a God, is it reasonable to assume that he would have tried to communicate with us in very clear and specific ways? I think it is.
[time=3470] And if he did, and he put it in a book, would it be unusual for that book to be the most unique book in all the world? Probably not, because God wrote it.
[time=3478] Have a look see for yourself. Let me invite you to stand and we'll close our service with a word of prayer. If you have any spiritual questions or concerns in your life, right behind this curtain there's some folks that are trained part of our church. They'd love to answer any questions you have on spiritual matters.
[time=3494] Thanks for joining us this morning. It's always great to have you here.
[time=3498] And we're just thrilled for the privilege and the opportunity to say these kinds of things. Submit them to your thinking.
[time=3506] Our gracious God and Heavenly Father, as we draw our time together to a close, we've considered the things of the Bible.
[time=3514] For those who whose curiosity has been heightened, Father, be powerful in their hearts and their lives and draw them to the reading of the scripture so they can find for themselves whether or not it is alive and active.
