[time=30] This is the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=52] Thank you for joining us.
[time=54] Pastor Moore continues his series on faith with a look at the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=58] When faith has its reasons, is Jesus who he said he was, we examine the evidence that proves Jesus' claims.
[time=65] We hope you'll stay tuned.
[time=66] Now let's join our service.
[time=68] During this season, we're used to singing O come let us adore him.
[time=72] But it's a difficult assignment.
[time=73] Let's face it.
[time=74] It's hard to really adore any baby that doesn't share our last name.
[time=77] Sure, our children and our grandchildren we adore.
[time=80] The rest all look the same, squirming little squinting noisy bundles of need.
[time=85] But this child was adored.
[time=88] Why strangers know less?
[time=89] Not because he looked any different than any other newborn.
[time=92] He still squirmed and squinted and wailed when necessary.
[time=95] But because of who they believed him to be.
[time=99] Joseph, what are you doing?
[time=101] I was going to get you some more water.
[time=104] Maybe they have some more blankets inside.
[time=106] No, stay here.
[time=107] Sit with me for a while.
[time=110] I can't sit still.
[time=112] I am just so mad about all of this.
[time=115] My uncle was supposed to have us.
[time=117] You'll wake him up.
[time=119] It's OK.
[time=120] We'll go home in a few days.
[time=124] Joseph can only rest like you.
[time=128] It's hard to rest with a cow staring at you all the time.
[time=133] Watch.
[time=135] Wherever I go, whatever I do, I turn around and it just stares at me.
[time=142] You can't understand why you don't see this.
[time=146] See what?
[time=147] The miracle in my arms.
[time=149] Think about it, Joseph.
[time=150] Oh, that's the problem.
[time=152] I've got too much to think about.
[time=154] In the first place, we've got to get you out of here.
[time=157] Into a house or something where people can't just gawk.
[time=160] It's not safe for you or the baby.
[time=162] He does have a name.
[time=165] For you or Yeshua.
[time=170] Are you worried about what people will think?
[time=173] You're here in your hometown with a woman and a baby, and you're not married.
[time=178] No, it's not that.
[time=180] It's just-- well, it's just that I'm
[time=187] worried about what people will think.
[time=189] Joseph said.
[time=189] Well, I know, but look, I know what happened, and you know what happened, but nobody else.
[time=196] Not a single soul on the face of the earth believes what we do about that.
[time=201] Who is it?
[time=202] We came to visit the baby.
[time=204] Is this him?
[time=206] Yes.
[time=206] It's a baby.
[time=207] What?
[time=208] You never saw a baby before?
[time=209] Oh, not like this one.
[time=211] Look, I don't want to be rude, but there's really nothing to see here.
[time=215] So why don't you just move along, and we'll be on our way shortly.
[time=220] If you doubt us, you could check with the innkeeper.
[time=222] We have full permission to be here.
[time=223] What we want to know is that this is the one.
[time=227] What?
[time=228] One.
[time=229] The one the angel talked about.
[time=231] Nope.
[time=232] Sorry.
[time=232] Wrong, baby.
[time=233] Move along, eh?
[time=236] Did you say angel?
[time=239] Yeah.
[time=241] As in tall, bright light, deep voice.
[time=246] Yeah.
[time=247] There were hundreds of them.
[time=249] They filled the entire sky.
[time=252] Mary, this is strange.
[time=254] You saw an angel, and then I saw an angel, and now these guys-- This has to be the one.
[time=259] It's the only baby in Bethlehem and a manger, just like the angel said.
[time=264] What else did he say?
[time=265] We were in our fields just an hour ago.
[time=268] Angels appeared out of nowhere, and told us a savior was born today in Bethlehem, that he was the Christ.
[time=276] Ma'am, I don't know who you are, but I believe you are holding the Messiah in your arms.
[time=284] Messiah?
[time=286] It still sounds funny to say.
[time=289] Of all the times for him to come, it's this time.
[time=293] Of all the villages, it's mine.
[time=297] Of all the women, you.
[time=300] Of all the men, it's me.
[time=304] So if Christmas-- This Christmas-- The one about the virgin being with child seems a little strange to you?
[time=309] We can see.
[time=310] It is strange.
[time=311] But strange and true are best friends.
[time=314] And God has his own ways.
[time=315] Strange but marvelous.
[time=317] Unlikely but miraculous.
[time=318] That God will begin his life here on Earth in the same place that you and I did.
[time=323] In the womb of a young woman.
[time=325] When small child in the land of a thousand.
[time=333] When small dream of a savior tonight.
[time=341] When small hand reaching up to the starlight.
[time=348] When small city of love.
[time=356] One king bringing his gold and riches.
[time=371] One king holding an army of might.
[time=378] One king dealing with incense and candlelight.
[time=385] One king bringing his love.
[time=393] Oh.
[time=399] See him lying a cradle beneath him.
[time=406] See him smiling in the stone.
[time=413] See his mother praising his mother.
[time=419] See his tiny, eyelids grow low.
[time=430] One small child in the land of a thousand.
[time=437] One small dream of people of mind.
[time=444] One small hand reaching out to the starlight.
[time=451] One small savior of my life.
[time=470] I don't know if you happen to have seen the most recent edition of Newsweek.
[time=477] But on the cover it says who's faith for the kids?
[time=482] Who's faith for the kids?
[time=484] Mixed marriages, holidays and hard choices.
[time=488] Now I don't want you to be confused.
[time=490] I'm not against mixed marriages in any way, shape or form.
[time=493] That's not the point of this article and that's not why I'm talking about it.
[time=496] The focus of the article is the complexity of decisions about whose faith should take
[time=502] precedence in the home once a mixed marriage has occurred.
[time=505] They give some vignettes.
[time=507] Amy was raised as a Jew in New Jersey.
[time=510] Tom grew up a Methodist in Wisconsin.
[time=513] They plan to share both religions with their four month old son Graham.
[time=517] Both believe it's important that Graham have a faith but they'll let him choose which one.
[time=524] Hello and Christine Amourman hopes Tony, a Roman Catholic, will someday join her church.
[time=530] In the meantime they worship with their daughter Karina who's two at Mass and at the Mormon Temple in Oakland, California.
[time=538] A third vignette at their wedding last month, Adam and Episcopalian and Hillary, a Jew, exchanged
[time=545] vows before a rabbi.
[time=548] Finding one who would agree to marry them was "hellish" they say.
[time=552] They plan to raise their kids as a Jew or as Jews.
[time=556] A fourth vignette the article offered was "Religion wasn't an issue for jury, a Buddhist Japanese American." And Christopher, a Catholic Italian American, jury didn't have to convert but before a priest would marry them she had to agree to raise their children as Catholics.
[time=574] On the surface this seems like a very acceptable, a very mature, conscientious and reasonable
[time=581] way to try to resolve these kinds of issues inside of a family so the family has a chance to stay together.
[time=588] These kinds of compromises seem reasonable and the article kind of lays out a premise
[time=594] by one of the mothers involved who said this quote "After all there are many paths to God."
[time=601] There are many paths to God implied then is "Let's not get all worked up over whether
[time=607] we're going to get to God through Muhammad or Buddha or Confucius or Joseph Smith or Mary Baker Eddy or Reverend Moon.
[time=616] It's like getting in a fight over which fast food restaurant you're going to go to.
[time=619] It doesn't really matter.
[time=620] They all serve the same Greece, right?
[time=623] I mean that's the idea, that's the premise of the article.
[time=628] And I guess I'm okay with the premise of the article unless one thing, unless one thing,
[time=635] unless Jesus is who He said He was.
[time=640] I'm okay with the article unless Jesus is who He said He was.
[time=645] You see Christ made some claims.
[time=647] He said some things that rule out the notion that there are many paths to God.
[time=654] Jesus said some things which rules that out completely.
[time=658] He said "I am the resurrection and the life.
[time=661] He that believes on Me, though He were dead, yet He shall live.
[time=665] And whosoever lives and believes in Me shall never die." Jesus said "I am the light of the world.
[time=672] He who follows Me shall not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life." Jesus said "I am the door.
[time=680] I am the shepherd.
[time=683] I am the father, are one.
[time=685] I am the bread of life." Jesus said "He who has seen Me has seen God the father because we are one."
[time=696] Jesus said "Come unto Me, all you who are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."
[time=703] Jesus said "Whosoever drinks of the water that I shall give Him shall never thirst again."
[time=709] Jesus most pointedly said "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[time=716] No man comes to the Father but by Me." You see with alarming regularity, Jesus claimed to be the Son of God, the only Savior for
[time=728] sin, the only way to God, and man's only hope for heaven.
[time=736] Now if Jesus is truly the Son of God, then making decisions about these various religious
[time=745] systems is like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.
[time=751] It's a hopeless cause.
[time=753] The issue isn't which religion, the issue becomes what are you going to do with the person of Jesus Christ?
[time=761] What are you going to do with the person of Jesus Christ?
[time=767] Peter said "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God," and Jesus said "Yes I am."
[time=774] You put on trial, they said "Are you or are you not the Son of God?" In Mark 1462 and Jesus looks straight back at the questioner and says "I am."
[time=785] You see Jesus forces you to make a decision about who He is.
[time=790] When a person stands up and claims to be God and claims to be the only way, the only hope
[time=797] of salvation, it forces an issue.
[time=801] Is Jesus who He said He was or isn't He?
[time=805] Jesus did not claim to be merely a religious leader.
[time=810] He did not claim to be a philanthropist.
[time=812] He did not claim to be a political activist.
[time=815] He did not claim to be a great moral teacher.
[time=819] Jesus claimed to be God.
[time=824] Now as you begin to think through how you are going to answer this question in your own heart, your own mind.
[time=830] Jesus is Jesus who He said He was.
[time=832] I want to invite you to not kind of take the immediate answer well.
[time=836] I believe what I believe about Jesus because that's how I was raised.
[time=841] Where I believe about Jesus, what I believe about Jesus because somebody I respect believes this way about Jesus, or I heard this about Jesus.
[time=850] There is in fact a very classic approach to take as you want to kind of reason your way
[time=856] through this issue.
[time=857] Who is Jesus?
[time=858] What he did is Jesus who He claimed He was.
[time=861] And there are ways that you can think your way through that question other than while that's how it was raised or that's what I've always thought or that's my general notion.
[time=868] I mean we're in a series on faith has its reasons and I want to share with you this morning kind of a classic approach to think your way through is Jesus who He said He was.
[time=880] It goes like this.
[time=881] As you see on the screen, Jesus claims to be God.
[time=884] That's no question.
[time=885] I mean that's over and over and over in the scriptures Jesus has claimed to be God.
[time=889] Now there are only two alternatives with that claim.
[time=892] It is either false or it is true.
[time=895] Now that's a fact.
[time=897] Jesus claimed to be God and there's only two possibilities there.
[time=900] It is either false, in fact was not God, or His claims were true.
[time=906] He was in fact the true in living God.
[time=910] Now the classic approach to this goes one step farther.
[time=914] If the claims were false then there's two possibilities.
[time=918] Jesus knew they were false as He was saying them as He was walking around telling people that He was the Son of God.
[time=923] He knew they were false in which case He was a liar.
[time=928] Or the second alternative is that He did not know they were false.
[time=932] He walked around telling everybody that He was God and He in fact didn't even know that He wasn't God.
[time=938] He thought He was God.
[time=939] He really believed He was God even though He wasn't and that makes Him a lunatic.
[time=944] He was insane.
[time=945] He wasn't in full possession of His mental faculties.
[time=949] The third option is that His claims were true and that meant that He would be Lord.
[time=955] So there's really three options with Christ.
[time=958] He was either a liar, He knew the facts, He knew He was not God, but He went around telling
[time=965] everybody He was God and while He was telling them He knew He wasn't.
[time=968] He was just a full-fledged, bona fide liar.
[time=971] The second option is that He was a lunatic.
[time=974] He really believed He was God.
[time=976] I mean He really thought He was God when in reality He wasn't, a self-deceived lunatic.
[time=982] Or He was God which makes Him Lord.
[time=986] They've called this little line of reasoning the trilema.
[time=990] There's really only three things to do with these claims about Christ.
[time=993] Either He's a liar, He's a lunatic, or He's a Lord.
[time=997] Now let me explain a little further.
[time=1000] If His claims were false, He is either a premeditated liar who knowingly made a schedule and went
[time=1007] from town to town spreading falsehoods about Himself or He's a lunatic.
[time=1012] He's a self-deceived lunatic, tragically trumpeting claims that He thought were true about Himself but in fact were not true about Him.
[time=1020] Or the third option if His claims were true in Christ, if in fact His claims were true
[time=1026] that He is God then in Him we can find forgiveness and we can find love and cleansing that we so desperately need.
[time=1033] And we ought to spend the rest of our lives gratefully worshiping Him without apology.
[time=1039] Now in the time remaining I want to help His time to think through these three options.
[time=1043] I want to take a walk down the liar road.
[time=1045] What is the possibility that Christ was a liar?
[time=1048] What's the probability there?
[time=1049] This is a serious faith has its reasons.
[time=1051] Then we'll walk down the lunatic road a little ways and see well what are the chances He was a lunatic?
[time=1057] And then we'll come back and look at the Lord option and see if there's any evidence that might support that notion.
[time=1063] First of all, a liar was Christ a knowing liar.
[time=1067] Is it reasonable to assume that Christ was a premeditated liar?
[time=1070] Remember now, not a lunatic, not a self-deceived person.
[time=1075] He's in full possession of His rational capacities.
[time=1079] He knows that He is not God but He tells everybody that He is all of His life.
[time=1086] Now historians will tell you that the life and teaching of Jesus Christ set the standard
[time=1092] of morality and ethics.
[time=1095] Those who have studied the life of Christ will tell you that in His teachings and in His life practice the man held the standard in terms of morality and ethics.
[time=1106] I'm not talking about a guy like Jim Baker who has come and gone on our scene.
[time=1110] I guess he's trying to make a comeback.
[time=1112] But who masqueraded for a long period of time as a man of God and who was later found out
[time=1118] to be nothing but a charlatan who was in it for the money and who was breaking federal and state laws to keep money that he gained through religious means.
[time=1128] Jesus lived His entire life in front of this same group of people in Palestine.
[time=1134] And when it was over from birth to the grave, His mother, His brothers, His disciples,
[time=1141] the multitudes and even His detractors, even His most ardent enemies, highly respected
[time=1147] Christ and His personal integrity, His teaching and His honesty.
[time=1155] So the question that follows on this is, would Jesus knowingly challenge family and friends
[time=1165] to abandon their careers and to risk everything if deep down he knew he was a complete phony.
[time=1173] Following Christ in the day of Christ was not the same thing as following Christ today.
[time=1177] You can change from whatever following you've got to follow Christ.
[time=1181] You don't lose your job.
[time=1182] You don't lose your family.
[time=1183] You don't lose your friends by and large.
[time=1185] You go unscathed by the United States government because of where we live.
[time=1189] But that was not true in Jesus' day.
[time=1191] And if Jesus was a liar, that meant that He was knowingly asking His family and His friends to risk everything they had and potentially their life knowing that He was lying to them
[time=1203] the entire time.
[time=1205] Is it reasonable to assume that Christ would subject His mother and brothers and close friends to the distinct possibility of arrest, imprisonment and even death just so He could continue to spread His falsehood for whatever reason.
[time=1218] You've got to ask yourself that question.
[time=1221] And here's another question you've got to ask yourself.
[time=1223] Would Jesus, a man of His talent, a man of His ability, a man of His worldwide influence,
[time=1230] do that to Himself?
[time=1231] What do I mean here?
[time=1234] It wasn't, Jesus was not tried, arrested, tried and crucified for His teachings.
[time=1241] People appreciated His teachings.
[time=1243] Jesus was arrested and tried and crucified for one reason.
[time=1248] And that is, He claimed to be God.
[time=1251] That is why they arrested Him and that is why they tried Him and that is why they crucified Him.
[time=1257] Now, why would He do that to Himself?
[time=1259] If He knew He wasn't God, why would He continue to lie to everybody to say that He was God through the mockings and the arrests and the trial and being stripped and then beaten and then whipped and then spit at and then finally killed, crucified.
[time=1273] Wouldn't you think at some point in time He would have said, "Time out, just kidding.
[time=1280] I was a carpenter.
[time=1281] It got really boring.
[time=1282] I got this Messiah thing going.
[time=1284] It seemed to work.
[time=1285] I was pulling it off for a long time.
[time=1286] But listen, this is not my idea of how to spend Friday afternoon.
[time=1291] I was lying.
[time=1292] Send me to jail if you need to.
[time=1293] Listen, don't kill me.
[time=1295] Now why do I say that?
[time=1297] Have you noticed in your personal life that people tend to hang on to falsehood as long as it works to their advantage?
[time=1303] People will continue to tell lies as long as it works to their advantage.
[time=1307] People don't tend to die for their deception.
[time=1312] Pain has a way of flushing out a liar.
[time=1315] True?
[time=1316] It works that way in my house.
[time=1319] As long as somebody in my house thinks that by hanging on to this lie, they're going to get what they want.
[time=1324] They hang on to it.
[time=1325] But as soon as the facts are on the table or enough evidence is there and they see, "Woo, if I continue down this path line," he knows I'm lying, "He's going to kill me for this." Oh, Dad, I was lying.
[time=1334] I'm so sorry.
[time=1335] I feel so bad.
[time=1336] Please forgive me.
[time=1337] That's what liars do.
[time=1338] Liars hang on to lies as long as lies work to their advantage.
[time=1341] Liars give lies up as soon as they find out that keeping the lie doesn't work to their advantage.
[time=1345] The question you've got to ask is how could a man of worldwide influence and the stuff that Jesus was made of continue to push this lie all the way to his own death, all along
[time=1356] the way he had multiple opportunities to recant his position as God.
[time=1361] Is it rational to think of him as a premeditated liar?
[time=1365] Somehow that doesn't seem to fit the facts.
[time=1367] People don't, now they're exceptions, but as a rule, people don't tend to die for their
[time=1374] lives.
[time=1375] Okay, that's the liar road.
[time=1378] What about the lunatic road?
[time=1381] Now hundreds of people have claimed to be messiahs, right?
[time=1384] Hundreds of self-deceived, glassy-eyed weirdos claimed to be on missions from God.
[time=1388] I'll never forget the time at about 21 years of age before I was even ordained, yet I was in this ministry.
[time=1393] I was at this church in the middle of Los Angeles, and there were so many people that wanted help from the church that they would assign one of the 30 pastors on staff to be pastor of the day.
[time=1401] And if you were pastor of the day, that meant anybody who came in off the streets, you needed to try to meet their needs, physical needs, spiritual needs, counseling needs, whatever.
[time=1410] So here I am, wet behind the ears, dripping wet behind the ears, sitting there and in comes Jesus.
[time=1415] True.
[time=1416] The guy walked right in, sat down.
[time=1419] I said, "How can I help you?" And he said, "Well, the question is, how can I help you?" I said, "Well, I don't know, what do you have in mind?" And he said, "I just need to tell you." He says, "He stands up, puts his hands on my desk.
[time=1431] The angel looks at me very closely and says, 'I am the Christ, the Son of the living God.'"
[time=1437] And I thought, "Mm, nobody taught me what to say next.
[time=1444] I fumbled around.
[time=1445] My secretary thankfully heard the situation and she goes in, "Russell, ask to see his
[time=1451] hands," which I did, and to which then he put his hands in his pockets and pulled out
[time=1464] the Jim Beam bottle in which the label he had found a message from God that told him
[time=1470] that he was the Son of God, the Christ, the living one.
[time=1474] I mean, ask any policeman down there in the Fort Wayne Police Department, they run into Jesus all the time down there.
[time=1480] That's not a problem, it happens all the time.
[time=1484] Throughout history people will say they are killing for God, they are on a mission from God, they are the Messiah, they are the Holy One.
[time=1490] God told them to rape, God told them to murder, God told them to beat and maim people.
[time=1494] That, lots of people running around with the claim to be the Son of God.
[time=1501] But later, after you arrest these kinds of people and throw them in prison and do a little background check, the story comes out that these are typically unstable individuals.
[time=1510] They have unstable backgrounds, they have a long and charted history of bizarre behavior.
[time=1516] They say to themselves, at the end of the deal we should have known, you know, here's another guy playing with, you know, less than a full deck.
[time=1524] Now, if the claims are false, if Jesus claimed to be God is false and he is not lying, that
[time=1532] leaves the option that he really thought he was God when he wasn't, that means he was somehow separated from reality and lost some part of his ability to think rationally and
[time=1544] truthfully about what was really going on in life.
[time=1548] But I want to ask you this morning, does Jesus fit the profile of a demented person?
[time=1553] Does Jesus fit the profile of a lunatic?
[time=1557] One person said it this way, experts in psychology and psychiatry have gone over the records of the life of Jesus with a fine-toothed comb, looking for any tale-tale signs of psychotic
[time=1568] behavior.
[time=1569] They have not been able to find even a hint of instability.
[time=1572] There isn't a trace of evidence, not a shred of information that would even suggest concern about his psyche, quite the contrary.
[time=1581] Jesus, by all indications, was a picture of emotional and psychological health.
[time=1587] His teaching was brilliant, even his detractors emitted that.
[time=1590] His scope of knowledge was breathtaking.
[time=1593] His relationships were strong and secure.
[time=1595] He was steady and adversity, calm and a crisis.
[time=1598] He showed absolutely no propensity for any kind of erratic or psychotic behavior.
[time=1603] In short, there is just no basis on which to assess Jesus as being anything less than
[time=1609] a healthy, whole, integrated person deserving respect and even admiration.
[time=1615] We know signs whatsoever of lunacy or dementia."
[time=1622] It's a good point.
[time=1623] I mean, he not only didn't show the tale-tale signs of being a lunatic, but when his life was under the crucible of pressure as everything was falling around and chaos was happening
[time=1634] all around him, he stood as calm and as cool as you can imagine with strong, vibrant relationships
[time=1640] to those he loved, caring for his mother, forgiving the repentant thief, fully in control of
[time=1646] himself as he responded to the needs of others around him.
[time=1649] It doesn't sound like a lunatic.
[time=1652] It doesn't sound like a crazy man.
[time=1656] It leaves us with this third option.
[time=1659] Maybe.
[time=1660] Maybe he was God.
[time=1662] Maybe in fact, the claims were true that he so repeatedly said, "Maybe in fact Jesus Christ was God." Now, if that's the case, you would expect a few things to be true.
[time=1674] If Jesus Christ were in fact God, the Son of God, the Savior of the world, you would expect a couple of things at least to be true.
[time=1679] The first, I'll give you four things that I think God expect of somebody who really is God in human flesh.
[time=1685] Number one is words.
[time=1687] If in fact Christ came to teach us about God and how we ought to live, you would expect his words to be amazing.
[time=1695] You would expect the teaching of Christ to be astounding because he isn't a mere man.
[time=1700] He's God in human flesh.
[time=1704] You think about, it's so hilarious.
[time=1706] I love to watch it happen.
[time=1708] Michael Jordan will be out there doing some phenomenal non-human, semi-non-human activity on the basketball court and his fellow professionals will begin to hail him as though he were other than what?
[time=1720] And because we know of no other human that can do these kinds of things.
[time=1727] Now imagine a guy, and Michael would admit, he is not God, imagine a guy who says he's God.
[time=1733] What would you expect to see?
[time=1736] As I say first, his words ought to be absolutely amazing.
[time=1739] When Jesus spoke, he spoke about the real issues and the questions that fill people's hearts.
[time=1745] He addressed the subjects of who is God, does God love me, does God care about me?
[time=1751] How can I relate to God?
[time=1754] What about my sin?
[time=1755] How can I be forgiven?
[time=1756] Where do I go when I die?
[time=1758] How can I live in this world?
[time=1760] And he did it with pure, lucid spirituality.
[time=1764] When Jesus spoke, there was a clarity and a definitive nature and authoritative tone that absolutely stunned the people who were listening.
[time=1773] He addressed the greatest problems that throbbed in the human heart, clear and more definitively and more authoritatively than anybody ever has.
[time=1781] He taught about angels, he taught about heaven, he taught about earth, he taught about hell, he taught about sin, he taught about holiness.
[time=1787] He explained and interpreted the past, he predicted the future, he explained the present.
[time=1793] Nobody ever asked him a question, he couldn't answer.
[time=1796] Nobody ever posed a problem, he couldn't solve, he utterly astounded people, confounded people.
[time=1801] There was no explanation for his words other than that he was God.
[time=1807] In Luke chapter 4 verse 32 it says they were continually amazed at his teaching.
[time=1813] In John chapter 7 verse 46 they said never did a man speak the way this man speaks.
[time=1820] In Matthew chapter 7 at the end of the Sermon on the Mount, the multitudes it says there were amazed at his teaching, they were awestruck, when he was 12 years old, Luke 2 verses
[time=1831] 46 and 47 say that he went into the temple and had dialogue with the religious leaders of the day.
[time=1836] And the religious leaders of the day would have been the most area-dite, brilliant, devoted scholars in all the nation of Israel on the Old Testament text and at 12 years of age Jesus walks in and it says when he left they were amazed both at his questions and his answers.
[time=1853] He was able to teach the teachers at 12.
[time=1858] You see the fact is that nobody ever spoke like he spoke or talked like he talked.
[time=1863] No one ever knew the wisdom that he knew.
[time=1865] By common consent of history Jesus is the greatest teacher who ever lived.
[time=1870] Even the people who reject him cannot deny the incredible power and wisdom of his teachings.
[time=1876] The Gospels, those books in the Bible which record the most of his teaching where he would actually utter his truth.
[time=1884] The Gospels are the greatest literature ever written, or read.
[time=1888] They are read by more people, quoted by more authors, translated into more languages, represented in more art, set to more music than any other thing ever said or written by any other human being in all of history.
[time=1901] Jesus stands alone as a teacher, shoal, a man by the name of shoal in mash who was a Jew
[time=1908] who said this, Jesus Christ is the outstanding personality of all time.
[time=1914] No other teacher, Jewish, Christian, Buddhist, or Muhammadan, is still a teacher whose teaching is such a guidepost for the world in which we live.
[time=1923] Other teachers may have something basic for an oriental or an Arab or an Occidental,
[time=1931] but the very act and word of Jesus has value for all of us.
[time=1935] He became the light of the world.
[time=1938] Why shouldn't I as a Jew be proud of that?
[time=1942] Nicodemus had it right when he said to Jesus under the cover of night, "We know, we know
[time=1949] that you are a teacher from God."
[time=1955] One of the things you'd expect if God were to take the form of human flesh and in that have as one of his missions, the teaching us how to understand God and how to know God and how to live before God is that his teachings would have a uniqueness about them that is
[time=1971] unequaled by other teachers, and Jesus certainly has that mark.
[time=1976] Secondly, the second thing you might expect from God in human flesh would be works.
[time=1981] He would be able to do some things that normal human beings cannot do.
[time=1986] If he was God's son and Savior of the world, you would expect Jesus to perform some miracles.
[time=1993] And there is in fact no way to explain the works which he did in his life except that he was God in human flesh.
[time=2001] It says in Matthew 4 that news about Christ went out into all Syria and they brought to
[time=2007] him all who were ill, taken with various diseases and pains, demoniacs, epileptics,
[time=2013] paralytics and he healed them all, healed everybody.
[time=2017] The distinctive mark about the miraculous healing power of Christ is that he basically banished disease in all of Palestine from the southern tip of that nation to the northern
[time=2028] tip of that nation, Jesus in his three and a half year ministry virtually banished all disease because he would heal everyone he saw, he would heal them totally and he would heal them instantly.
[time=2041] Now there were occasions where he chose not to heal and he gave an explanation as to why, but every time he wanted to heal, he could heal everyone he wanted to, he totally healed them and he instantly healed them.
[time=2052] In John chapter 2 it says that when Christ was in Jerusalem at the Passover during the feast, many believed in his name, why?
[time=2059] It says they were beholding his signs which he was doing.
[time=2065] It didn't take a whole lot more than that to verify the claim that he was God, then when they watched him do all these miracles.
[time=2074] He could control nature by turning water into wine in John 2.
[time=2077] He was still the storm in Matthew 8, he was able to control fish in Luke 5 and John 21.
[time=2082] He could multiply food in John 6.
[time=2084] He walked on water in Matthew 14.
[time=2086] He took money from the mouth of a fish for taxes.
[time=2091] He cursed a fig tree and it dried up upon his cursing in Matthew 21.
[time=2096] Had control over nature.
[time=2097] He had control over disease.
[time=2099] He healed the leper in Luke 5, he healed a paralytic in Mark 2, he healed Peter's wife of a fever in Mark 1, he healed a nobleman son in John 4, he healed a withered hand in
[time=2110] Mark 3, he healed a deaf and dumb person in Mark 7.
[time=2114] He gave back sight to a blind person in John 9, he healed 10 lepers in Luke 17, he restored an ear in Luke 22.
[time=2123] Those are some of his miracles.
[time=2124] In fact the Bible says in the book of John that all the books in the world would not be able to contain the works and the words of Christ.
[time=2130] What you find in the New Testament and if you were here last week you know that the New Testament is a unique book unlike any other book ever written in the history of the world and what you find in this very unique book is a partial record of the miraculous power of Christ.
[time=2143] It's undeniable, Julian the apostate who was a Roman emperor from 361 to 363, now we're
[time=2151] talking about a non-Christ follower and apostate, an enemy of Christ, Julian the Roman emperor
[time=2157] 361, 363.
[time=2159] He was a hater of Christians and a hater of Christ, he said this, "Jesus has now been celebrated about 300 years.
[time=2167] Having done nothing in his lifetime worthy of fame unless anyone thinks it is a very
[time=2173] great work to heal lame people and blind people and exercise demoniacs in the villages
[time=2179] of Bethsadia and Bethany." I kind of like that.
[time=2184] Who is this Jesus guy think he is being worshiped now for 300 years, he didn't do anything worthy of fame unless you want to give him like a little bit of credit for healing people
[time=2194] instantly, totally and completely wherever he went.
[time=2198] I mean even his critics couldn't deny the fact that he was miraculous.
[time=2205] All they could do was try to diminish the import of the miraculous things he did.
[time=2211] Thirdly, thirdly, if you were the Son of God,
[time=2218] you might expect him to be sinless.
[time=2223] You might expect him to be utterly different than the rest of us in this category, sin.
[time=2228] You might expect him never to have a selfish word or a selfish thought or a selfish act.
[time=2233] You might expect him to always completely and totally observe all that God would have a human being observed because he is the living God himself.
[time=2242] In fact, when confronted by the miraculous power of Christ, his detractors, the antagonists, the scribes and the Pharisees, you know what they finally had to resort themselves to?
[time=2251] They couldn't deny all the healings and all the power over nature.
[time=2254] They just couldn't explain it away.
[time=2256] He did too much of it too often to try to make people think it was a hoax.
[time=2260] He really didn't heal that person.
[time=2262] It was just too extensive.
[time=2263] So they finally fell back to their last ditch position and they said, "Okay, he's got supernatural power, but let me tell you where he gets it.
[time=2270] He gets it from hell.
[time=2272] He gets it from Satan." They would impune his character, but the record is clear that Christ was sinless.
[time=2280] Now, if I ever tried to stand up here and make the claim that I was sinless, my wife,
[time=2288] you know, could just stand right up.
[time=2290] My kids, they're on call.
[time=2292] They're ready to tell you.
[time=2293] They want to share a few things.
[time=2295] They go on in a more household.
[time=2296] I have friends right now in the audience raising their hand saying, "Please, let me come forward.
[time=2299] I'll tell you that I'll tell these people you're not sinless."
[time=2306] Jesus lived and walked and breathed with the same people for his 33 years.
[time=2313] The record is very clear.
[time=2314] Peter, who was with him, said this, in 1 Peter chapter 2 verse 21 and following, he says
[time=2321] that Christ did no sin.
[time=2325] Similar of his disciples, John says in 1 John 3, 5, "In him there is no sin."
[time=2332] In John 48, Jesus stands in front of a great crowd of people and says this, "Which of you convicts me of sin?" Speak.
[time=2342] And there was silence, absolute silence, not one person.
[time=2348] And he invited them to.
[time=2350] Go ahead.
[time=2351] Point it out.
[time=2354] Pilot.
[time=2355] Pilot would have given anything to have found just one accusation to be legitimate in the conviction of Jesus, to alleviate him of his own guilt.
[time=2363] But he said, "I find no fault in this man." Washed his hands, turned him over.
[time=2372] Nobody ever could.
[time=2374] The Jews couldn't find fault.
[time=2375] The Romans, the disciples, history, nobody could because there wasn't any.
[time=2380] It wasn't only the absence of sin, but the presence of holiness and righteousness.
[time=2386] Jesus could never have written Psalm 51, Psalm 32, Romans 7.
[time=2391] He never could have confessed his sin because he never needed to confess his sin because he never sinned because he was the true and living God.
[time=2398] It says in Hebrews chapter 4, "We do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weakness, but one who has been tempted in all things as we are," here's the phrase, "yet without sin." Christ was without sin.
[time=2412] In Hebrews 7, speaking of Christ it says this, "For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy and innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners and exalted above
[time=2424] the heavens." Speaking of course of Christ.
[time=2428] Absolutely amazing.
[time=2430] And the one person in all of history who would have been most motivated and in the best position to reveal the sin of Christ would have been who, Judas.
[time=2442] Judas would have been delighted to find some reason to justify the betrayal that he had given of Christ, but he couldn't find it.
[time=2448] Anything to pacify his own pain, to soothe his own wound, to alleviate the guilt and the
[time=2455] pain of what he had done, and in trying to get rid of the money and wash the blood off his hands, Judas cried out, "I have sinned in that I have betrayed innocent blood."
[time=2468] Even before Judas took his own life under the weight of the guilt of being the one who betrayed Christ, he had to admit the obvious.
[time=2477] The thing that was driving and compelling him to suicide was that he had betrayed innocent blood, the only innocent blood that had ever lived.
[time=2487] Paul confirms the same when he says that Christ who knew no sin in his death became sin for us.
[time=2493] He was the spotless lamb, the perfect Son of God who on the cross took on all of our sins,
[time=2499] none of his own because he didn't have any, took all of our sins and bore the weight and the guilt and the punishment and the wrath of God there for us.
[time=2509] Number four, if Christ were the Son of God, you would expect for him to have power over
[time=2520] death.
[time=2522] You would expect for him to have power over death and he did.
[time=2526] He rose Jarius' daughter from the dead.
[time=2531] The widow's son was dead and he raised him from the dead in Luke 7, Lazarus was dead in John 11 and he raised Lazarus from the dead and when he himself died, he raised from
[time=2543] the dead.
[time=2545] He was conqueror and master of death.
[time=2548] The thing that is the great ultimate end of all of humanity, the thing that all of us wish wouldn't happen, Jesus conquered it because he wasn't merely human, he was God.
[time=2559] In Hebrews chapter two it says that Jesus took flesh that through death he might destroy death and deliver us from the power of death.
[time=2568] Jesus in fact controlled his own death.
[time=2571] Nobody, he says, takes my life from me, I lay it down of myself in John 10.
[time=2576] When it was time for Christ to die and the crucifixion, there were human agents, there were people who nailed with that cross and lifted that cross up but long before the natural process of crucifixion had taken his life, he gave up his own spirit because he was in
[time=2589] control of death.
[time=2591] He died when he wanted to die, he died where he was supposed to die.
[time=2594] He died how he was supposed to die and once he was dead, he controlled that death through his own resurrection and the empty tomb, stands as witness to that.
[time=2602] There are 500 eyewitnesses that have borne account of the fact that Jesus was resurrected from the dead.
[time=2607] The power and the life of the disciples who were before his resurrection, timid and scattered
[time=2613] but after his resurrection and the evidence of his power over death went on to proclaim him throughout all of the region and the known world, many of them died as martyrs for the
[time=2623] Christian faith believing that Jesus was, we said he was, as he vindicated that claim through his own resurrection.
[time=2631] This church is evidence that Jesus had power over death.
[time=2636] For we are here today, those of us who are part of this church are here today by the power of God.
[time=2642] We believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, that he has power over death, that he now lives in us and the building and establishing of this church is the completion of his promise to build his church even though the gates of hell would prevail against it.
[time=2658] So how are you going to explain this, Jesus?
[time=2660] What are you going to do with the claims that Jesus had to be the Son of God?
[time=2666] He said things so profound they could never have come from human lips.
[time=2671] He did things so amazing, so miraculous they could never have been accomplished by human power.
[time=2677] He lived a sinless life and he mastered death.
[time=2684] Which option makes the most sense to you?
[time=2687] This is a series on reason, faith has its reasons.
[time=2692] Is it more reasonable to believe that Jesus was a willful liar?
[time=2698] Running around, lying to everybody, risking the life of his loved ones and friends and eventually dying for his own lie?
[time=2705] Does it make sense to you?
[time=2707] Does it make sense to you that this man was a lunatic completely out of touch or at least enough out of touch with the reality that he didn't know that he wasn't God and that he thought he was every time he said it?
[time=2718] Or does it make a little more sense to believe that if there is a God that God would want
[time=2726] to communicate to us through his word, through the Bible, the most unique Bible that was ever, the most unique book that was ever written and that one of the main themes of the Bible and one of the main purposes of God's communication to us was to record the birth and the life and the death and the resurrection and the words and the miracles of his beloved son who came to save us.
[time=2746] Which is more reasonable to you.
[time=2751] Who is Jesus Christ?
[time=2753] H. G. Wells, an atheist, in the May of 1935 and readers died digest said this, quote, "When
[time=2763] I was asked which single individual has left the most prominent impression on the world,
[time=2770] the manner of the question almost carried the implication that it was Jesus of Nazareth and I agreed." Napoleon said this, "I know men and I tell you that Jesus Christ is not a man.
[time=2784] Superficial minds may see a resemblance between Christ and the founders of empires and the gods of other religions, that resemblance does not exist.
[time=2793] There is between Christianity and whatever other religions, the distance of infinity.
[time=2800] Everything in Christ astonishes me.
[time=2803] Between him and whoever else in the world, there is no possible term of comparison.
[time=2808] He is truly a being by himself.
[time=2812] The nearer I approach, the more carefully I examine, everything is above me.
[time=2817] Everything remains grand of a grandeur which overpowers." Napoleon continues, "I search in vain in history to find the similar to Jesus Christ
[time=2827] or anything which can approach the gospel, neither history, nor humanity, nor the ages, nor nature offer me anything which I am able to compare it or explain it with.
[time=2838] Here everything is extraordinary." John the French atheist said this, "Whatever may be the surprises of the future, one thing
[time=2848] is sure, Jesus will never be surpassed."
[time=2858] Another has written, "This Jesus of Nazareth, without money and arms, conquered more millions than Alexander, Caesar, Muhammad, and Napoleon.
[time=2867] Without science and learning, he shed more light on things human and divine than all philosophers and scholars combined.
[time=2874] Without the eloquence of schools, he spoke such words of life as were never spoken before or since and produced effects which lie beyond the reach of or her or poet.
[time=2884] Without writing a single line, he set more pins in motion and furnished themes for more sermons, orations, discussions, learned volumes, works of art and songs of praise than the
[time=2895] whole army of great men of ancient and modern times."
[time=2902] Another has written, "He is the supreme master of everything.
[time=2908] He is the master of hungry crowds and angry Pharisees.
[time=2911] He is the master of clever theologians and bitter sinners.
[time=2915] He is the master of stupid disciples and lonely governors.
[time=2918] He is the master of his own self.
[time=2920] He struggles in the midnight of all of fighting sweat and blood and tears and comes forth victorious and complete devotion to God." In the terrible agony of the cross, he is master.
[time=2931] Everything around him is in fury.
[time=2932] Even the elements are in chaos and he is calm, master of his own will, his own tongue and
[time=2940] his own heart.
[time=2941] He pauses in the midst of all the chaos of the sin bearing act on the cross to forgive a penitent thief.
[time=2947] He opens the door of paradise to that thief.
[time=2950] He comforts his own mother.
[time=2951] He takes care of his beloved disciple, John, and in the midst of the shock of the loss
[time=2957] of blood and the terrible thirst that he endured, he calmly fulfills the last prophecy, says
[time=2964] I thirst, knows it is done and offers his spirit to God.
[time=2970] And in doing, he purchased salvation for all who come to him.
[time=2978] I don't know.
[time=2981] What do you think?
[time=2987] Is Jesus who he said he was?
[time=2993] One closing scripture as we draw our tongue to an end, we'll go back to the beginning.
[time=3001] Again I've got no problem whatsoever with intermarriages and I don't even have a problem with various names for religions.
[time=3011] That's not my issue.
[time=3014] My issue is Christ.
[time=3017] Who is he?
[time=3018] And what are you going to do with the fact that he claimed to be God, that he claimed to be the only way to God, the only hope of salvation?
[time=3027] This verse says there is salvation in no one else.
[time=3037] Why?
[time=3039] Because there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we
[time=3048] must be saved.
[time=3051] That is the central issue.
[time=3056] Jesus drives himself down through humanity like a great wedge.
[time=3062] And everybody who has ever lived has to deal with the reality of who Jesus said he was.
[time=3070] And you can't write him off.
[time=3073] You can't say oh he was a great teacher because great teachers don't claim to be God.
[time=3080] He is more than that.
[time=3081] He didn't give us that category.
[time=3083] He didn't leave himself in the category of religious leader or political activist or any other thing other than that he was the son of God come to save people from their sins.
[time=3093] Now you can do anything you want with that.
[time=3095] You can say nope I believe he is a liar.
[time=3098] He knowingly, premeditatedly lied about that issue all of his life.
[time=3104] It's an option, that's a legitimate option, that's an option.
[time=3108] Or you can say no I don't think he is a liar.
[time=3111] I think he was a lunatic, I think he was out of his mind, I think he is one of these crazies.
[time=3116] Well then if that's, what are you going to do with that what everybody says about him?
[time=3121] What are you going to do with his book, what are you going to do with his impact and influence on history?
[time=3126] What are you going to do with the fact that he spoke as no man had ever spoken, that he did works, no man had ever done, he was sinless, that he conquered death.
[time=3138] I believe faith has its reasons and I believe the most reasonable approach to Jesus is to
[time=3145] confess him as Lord.
[time=3148] Not Muhammad, not Buddha, not Confucius, not Reverend Moon.
[time=3154] Not to get confused about Methodists, Episcopalian, Presbyterian, Baptist or anything else.
[time=3161] Give your life to Christ.
[time=3166] Give your life to Christ because there is salvation in no one else.
[time=3173] Would you stand with me this morning as we close and prayer?
[time=3183] Take a moment this morning and bow your head and be assured that, I mean I want to talk
[time=3190] to you for a minute if you're on the fence on this issue, if you've been on the fence on this issue, and I'm not going to embarrass you in any way, ask you to come forward or
[time=3199] raise your hand or do anything crazy in a public setting like this, but who is Jesus?
[time=3208] Who is he?
[time=3210] Liar, lunatic or Lord?
[time=3216] Now if this message and maybe others and beyond these messages, things that God has been doing in your heart, the circumstances of your life, the processes of your thinking, if you come
[time=3229] into the place that you see the reasonableness of Christ as Lord and you're ready to embrace him as such and give your life and cry out to be saved, I want to help you do that this morning.
[time=3239] So I'm going to pray that little prayer that I so often pray, that prayer of acceptance,
[time=3247] giving your life to Christ.
[time=3249] If you're here this morning and you want to make that final decision and entrust your eternity to Christ, then I invite you to say it in your heart, I'll say it aloud you say
[time=3260] it in your heart to God.
[time=3262] If you mean it, God will hear you and God will save you.
[time=3266] I invite you to say it.
[time=3269] Goes like this, my gracious God and Heavenly Father, I believe that Jesus is Lord, not
[time=3279] a liar and not a lunatic, I believe he is who he said he was.
[time=3284] And I accept Jesus Christ as my personal Lord and Savior right here and right now.
[time=3291] I commit my life to Christ as the only name by which men may be saved, the only name, the
[time=3301] only one, the only path by which men may be saved.
[time=3307] He is unique, He is God, He is my Savior.
[time=3313] And Father, for those who have prayed the prayer this morning, would you give them a great sense of you're having heard and acknowledged that prayer and having done the act of salvation
[time=3325] in their hearts?
[time=3326] I don't know how you'll choose to confirm that for them in the days to come, but I pray you'd confirm it, make it as real to them as it is real.
[time=3335] And Father, I thank you again, stand in awe and amazement that you do exist, that you have
[time=3341] communicated to us in the Word of God and that it holds the record of Jesus.
[time=3347] Thank you for giving us your only Son to be our Savior, we praise you and love you, pray these things in Christ's name.
[time=3378] He was a baby, a miracle, come to men.
[time=3383] He was a carpenter, healing with chalice dance.
[time=3389] He was the long promised guide to the promised land.
[time=3396] He was, He was, He was.
[time=3413] He was a teacher, amazing the multitude.
[time=3418] He had a wisdom that none could explain, and he was a rebel confronting the righteous
[time=3428] ones, but none of them could understand why he had a love for the lost and forgotten ones.
[time=3440] He was a friend to the friend that sent for, and he was a shepherd who showed him the way
[time=3450] to God.
[time=3453] He was, He was, He was, but he was rejected and he was abused.
[time=3469] He was delivered up to die, but in the power of heaven, he rose from the grave, and he
[time=3480] grew, who he was.
[time=3496] Some write him off as a figment of history, some say he's only a crutch more than we.
[time=3506] Some say he'll always be shrouded in mystery, but every man needs to understand that he
[time=3517] is the answer to all we've been looking for, he is the light that will ever endure, and
[time=3527] he is the hope that will last through eternity, he is, he is, he is, he is, a son of God,
[time=3552] a holy one shepherd Messiah, peace of mind eternal life, that's who he is.
