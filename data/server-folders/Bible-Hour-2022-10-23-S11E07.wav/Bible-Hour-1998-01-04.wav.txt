[time=30] (music playing)
[time=48] This is the Sunday Morning Worship Service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=51] Thank you for joining us.
[time=53] Today, Pastor Moore returns to his discussion of the Ten Commandments.
[time=56] In "Why No Stealing," he looks at what God says about this commandment.
[time=61] We hope you'll stay tuned.
[time=62] Now let's join our service.
[time=64] And we want to welcome you back to our series on the Big Ten.
[time=68] If you've been with us for a while over the last couple of months, you know, we took a break in our look at the Ten Commandments for the month of December.
[time=77] But now we're back.
[time=78] And this morning, we're going to be looking at the commandment that has to do with stealing.
[time=83] With stealing.
[time=84] And thou shalt not steal and we'll talk more about that a little bit later.
[time=88] But right now, we want to invite you to begin to prepare your hearts and maybe be thinking
[time=95] about some things that might allow this time of worship here at the beginning of our service to be a time that for you would be encouraging and uplifting.
[time=105] In the songs that we're about to sing, there is kind of a common thread, especially in these first few.
[time=112] You'll hear Marilyn and the praise team, the vocal team singing a song and then you'll be joining us in a moment.
[time=118] And you'll hear the phrase exalt, exalt him.
[time=123] What does it mean to exalt the Lord?
[time=126] The word exalt means to speak or to tell of one's achievements, to lift high, to applaud
[time=134] and to applaud not just verbally but emotionally.
[time=139] Let me ask you this morning, maybe just to consider in the quietness of your own heart, why does God deserve to be exalted this morning in your life, in your own heart?
[time=151] Why does he deserve today, in your own heart and life?
[time=154] What has he done?
[time=155] What has he accomplished?
[time=156] Where has he been?
[time=157] What has he brought you through?
[time=160] Does he today deserve to be lifted high, to be applauded in a sense, in your own heart and your own life, not just verbally but emotionally, deep inside?
[time=170] We hope this morning that you can remember these things.
[time=174] We hope this morning that in remembering them, you too, along with us, are willing to exalt him and to lift his name up high.

[time=2967] Come to I Timothy chapter 6, and we'll get to this idea of loving money for just a minute.
[time=2973] Loving money.
[time=2975] I Timothy 6, 10, for the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil, and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many of pay.
[time=2987] Not the working for money, not the saving of money, not the investing of money, not the giving of money, the love of money.
[time=2995] The love of money is the root of all sorts of evil.
[time=2998] You see, when a person begins subtly and easily in our culture to believe that their life consists of money and the things of money, the places of money, the house that money buys, the car money buys, the clothes money buys, the vacations money buy, they begin to give their heart to a love of money, and then they plunge themselves into these kinds of foolish things where they take things that are not thirst, they defraud, they alter the scales, they do all that kind of stuff, the deception that is involved in stealing somebody that is not yours.
[time=3033] Let me give you a couple little questions to ask yourself to find out if you have the love of money.
[time=3037] You're ready, number one.
[time=3039] Do you spend more time thinking about money than you do thinking about doing a good job?
[time=3043] When you're at work, when you're at work, do you think more about the money you're going to get, the money you're going to earn, or do you think more time about how to do a good job?
[time=3054] If you spend more time thinking about the money you're going to earn, you probably have a problem with loving of money.
[time=3058] You should be engrossed in the work ethic.
[time=3061] You should be engrossed with the privilege of work and the desire to do excellence, the pursuit of excellence, the desire to do it better every single time with the greatest level of efficiency and commitment and thrown us as is possible.
[time=3073] Excellence needs to be the pursuit in the marketplace, not money.
[time=3077] Excellence, not money.
[time=3079] Number two, when you never have enough, you know you love money when you never have enough, the Bible talks about the daughters of leech, daughters of leech who say give, give.
[time=3090] That's all they ever say.
[time=3092] Give, give.
[time=3093] There are three things that will not be satisfied or that will not say enough.
[time=3098] The Bible talks about the earth that is never satisfied with water and fire that never says enough.
[time=3104] In other words, people, water, the earth's need for water and fire, these are things that have insatiable desires that never learn to say enough, except by the power of God and the changing of your paradigms and the changing of your priorities, and you come along with Paul in Philippians 4 and say, "I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I am." That, my friends, is a difficult pursuit and is not to be taken lightly and it does not happen by accident.
[time=3134] You come to the place of contentment by changing values and changing priorities and changing how you spend your time and it is not necessarily easy, but it can be done by the power of God.
[time=3146] Number three, you know you love money when you flaunt it.
[time=3152] When the greatest joy is in life, the thing that makes you the happiest is when you are wearing, driving, or living in what money can buy.
[time=3160] Number four, you know you love money when you resist
[time=3166] giving it away, whether it's to the church, so as not to rob God or whether it's in a free will offering above and beyond to meet somebody's physical need or emotional need or spiritual need or whatever it is, you just never can quite see the point in it.
[time=3183] And so you never want to give and when you give, you give just the smallest possible amount and there's no freedom in it, there's very little joy in it for you, you love money.
[time=3195] Number five, you know you love money when you will sin to get it.
[time=3198] You know you love money when you will sin to get it and this is kind of bringing us full circle back to the eighth commandment.
[time=3204] First time of the sixth, many foolish and harmful desires.
[time=3208] You love money and that loving of money will plunge you in to foolish and harmful desires which then throw you in to ruin and destruction.
[time=3216] You start doing the things that you can't do in terms of taking other people's possessions.
[time=3226] So I want to close this morning with a question, who do you want to be?
[time=3230] It's really not what you want to do, steal or work, it's who do you want to be in it.
[time=3236] Who do you really want to be?
[time=3238] The Bible says there are acceptable ways to acquire and there are unacceptable ways to acquire.
[time=3243] And the path you choose will say a whole lot more about who you are than what you have.
[time=3251] Do you want to be a Jacob?
[time=3255] Remember Jacob stole the birthright?
[time=3256] Do you really want, is that who you want to be?
[time=3259] Do you want to be a deceiving, conniving, selfish, manipulative person who would steal to the hurt of another and to the deception of his own father?
[time=3269] Is that who you want to be?
[time=3272] Do you want to be a Judas Iscariot?
[time=3274] He was a thief?
[time=3278] Do you want to be an Aiken?
[time=3280] Remember the words of Aiken?
[time=3282] They are the classic formula for stealing.
[time=3284] Aiken said this, "I saw among the spoils a beautiful garment,
[time=3290] 200 shekels of silver, a wedge of gold.
[time=3292] Then I coveted." And then I took.
[time=3298] That's how it all works.
[time=3300] You see it?
[time=3302] You covet it?
[time=3304] You take it.
[time=3306] Is that who you want to be?
[time=3308] Do you want to be a seer, covet, or taker?
[time=3312] Through the holidays here, we were down at the gym playing some ball and trying to get some exercise and work off the holiday excesses.
[time=3320] And I was leaving, and I was leaving with just my little son Bobby.
[time=3322] He's four years old, and I went out this side of the gym, and he went out the other side, and I said, "Hey, I'll meet you in the four-year." He didn't come for the longest time, and I was kind of like, "Where is he?" And so I went back in the gym.
[time=3332] I didn't see him there, so I thought, "Well, he had already gone there." So I went back there and didn't see him there, and so I'm like, "Well, where'd he go?" So eventually I called real loud, and he comes around the corner, and he walks up to me with his hand behind his back, and he puts it up in the air, and he says, "Dad." He's kind of stuttering these days, but I won't do this stuttering.
[time=3349] He says, "Dad, can I take this home with me?" And what he's got in his hand is an old, useless tennis ball.
[time=3358] For some reason they had it in the gymnasium.
[time=3360] This is an old, wiped out, the fuzz is gone, flat, nothing.
[time=3363] It's a tennis ball, he wants to take it home.
[time=3365] And I said, "Bobby, just kind of quickly thinking, "Would that be enough?" I said, "Hey, Bobby, that's not yours. That'd be stealing. We can't take that." And then he looks at it again, and then he looks at me and says, "But I really want it." Right? There it is.
[time=3382] So I had a lot of teachable moments.
[time=3384] So I get down on my knees, I kind of crouched down like this.
[time=3387] I came here, and he pulls up in tight here like this, and I say, "Hey now, we got two choices.
[time=3393] We can get two things, we can't have both.
[time=3396] You know, I've been talking to you about being a gentleman, which means you treat your sisters nice, you obey your mom and dad, you obey God that's being a gentleman.
[time=3405] I've been talking about being a gentleman.
[time=3409] If you put the ball back, you're a gentleman.
[time=3413] If you keep it, you're a thief, you're a stealer.
[time=3418] I said, "Which one do you want to be?" And he put the ball in his pocket and walked out.
[time=3422] No, just kidding.
[time=3426] I was really excited because, yeah, a lot of parental pressure, not like he wouldn't feel what I wanted him to do.
[time=3432] He takes a little ball, he goes back in the gym, throws it, and off he goes, comes home.
[time=3438] Isn't that really the issue?
[time=3441] Who do you want to be?
[time=3443] You're going to be throwing your taxes out here pretty soon.
[time=3446] Who do you want to be?
[time=3448] Do I be a gentleman?
[time=3450] Do I be a lady?
[time=3451] A person of dignity?
[time=3454] Or do you want to be a thief or be a stealer?
[time=3457] When you go home today and you survey everything in your vast domain, and you see the three or four things that aren't yours, who do you want to be?
[time=3466] You want to be a gentleman?
[time=3468] A lady?
[time=3469] You want to be a thief?
[time=3471] And for some of you, I know you're here because you can't get a group this big and not have somebody who's really stepped over the line.
[time=3478] Some of you have been doing some shoplifting.
[time=3480] Some of you have been doing some big-time employee theory.
[time=3484] Some of you have taken some things, and they mean a lot to you, and what would be terrifying to you is because the magnitude of them is to admit it and to find ways to make restitution.
[time=3493] I only got one question.
[time=3495] Who do you want to be?
[time=3499] Do you want to be a gentleman?
[time=3501] A lady?
[time=3503] Glorifying God with your life?
[time=3505] Or do you want to be a thief?
[time=3508] And if you've got a big nut to crack on that when you need help, and so again, I'll just say it.
[time=3511] You need to find somebody.
[time=3512] Tell them what happened.
[time=3514] And let other people guide and lead you to the place, not only of restitution to the person you stole from, but restitution where, of your dignity.
[time=3523] Would you stand with me and we'll close.
