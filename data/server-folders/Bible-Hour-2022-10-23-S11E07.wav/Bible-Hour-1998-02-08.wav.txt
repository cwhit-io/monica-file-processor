[time=384] And when he had taken the book, "The Four Living Creatures" and the 24 elders fell down before the lamb, having each one a harp in golden bowls of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.
[time=396] And they sang a new song saying, "Worthy art thou to take the book and to break its seals for thou a slain." And did purchase for God with thy blood men from every tribe and tongue and people and nation.
[time=411] And thou hast made them to be a kingdom and priests to our God and they will reign upon the earth.
[time=417] Worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing.
[time=426] To him who sits on the throne and to the lamb, be blessing and honor and glory and dominion forever and ever.
[time=436] And the Four Living Creatures kept saying amen.
[time=439] And the elders fell down and worshiped.
[time=444] Our gracious God and Heavenly Father, as we assemble here this morning.
[time=450] And as the music directs our minds and our hearts to the theme of Christ, the precious lamb of God, we look off into the future through the book of Revelation and we see people of every tribe, tongue and nation,
[time=468] spending all of eternity as priests, worshiping and serving the true and living God.
[time=474] And with a loud voice, this great throng among whom we will be blessed to participate.
[time=481] With a loud voice, we will cry out worthy as the lamb that was slain to receive power and riches, wisdom, might, honor, glory and blessing.
[time=491] And while we can see ourselves there in a future day, we find ourselves here right now.
[time=499] And it is in our hearts for you are the lamb of God.
[time=503] You are the one who died for our sins.
[time=507] You are the reason why we will escape the wrath that we so deserve.
[time=515] And so on this beautiful blessed Sunday morning, we come to worship you and we pray that you would save us further from ritual, that you would save us from going through the motions, that as God has prompted us at the beginning of our service, we would engage the true and living God from our hearts with active minds.
[time=535] Be glorified today and pray in Christ's name.
[time=538] [AMEN]

[time=566] There's a great, broad road through the meadow
[time=573] and many travel there.
[time=580] But I have a gentle shepherd.
[time=587] I would follow any way.
[time=594] Up a narrow path through the mountains
[time=601] to the valley far below, to be ever in his presence,
[time=616] where he leads me, I will go.
[time=642] And there are many wondrous voices.
[time=649] Day and night, they fill the air.
[time=656] But there is one so small and quiet.
[time=663] I would know it anywhere in the city or in the wilderness.
[time=677] There's a ringing crystal plane to be ever close beside him.
[time=692] When he calls me, I will hear.
[time=710] Where he leads me, I will follow.
[time=718] When he calls me, I will hear.
[time=725] Where he leads me, I will follow.
[time=732] When he calls me, I will be.
[time=748] There's a great, broad road to nowhere.
[time=772] There's so many traveling.
[time=779] But I have a gentle shepherd.
[time=786] I would follow any way, though the journey take me far away.
[time=800] From the place I call my home, to be ever in his presence,
[time=815] where he leads me, I will go.
[time=845] Okay, fine.
[time=862] You've wanted to break free from our families so badly, go ahead.
[time=868] You don't hold our values, you don't believe what we believe in, fine, go ahead.
[time=873] You win, have it your way, pack your bags.
[time=879] Because you know it's enough, it's just flat out enough.
[time=883] No more fighting, no more arguments, no more heartbreak.
[time=888] So just go ahead, I am letting you go.
[time=891] You're free to get out, just pack your bags and go.
[time=898] I imagine almost each and every one of us here this morning could stand and give testimony
[time=904] of an unruly, rebellious, recalcitrant teenager who caused so much destruction in the life
[time=911] of their family and to themselves that the father, after years of exercising patience
[time=917] and kindness finally one day just had to say goodbye.
[time=924] I let go.
[time=926] Have your own way, you win.
[time=930] And that gleeful, defiant teenager leaves slamming the door behind him not knowing at that moment the gravity of the decision he is making and not accurately assessing the
[time=941] evil of the world that he is about to enter.
[time=947] I think we find something of this dynamic in Luke 15 there in the story of the parable, the prodigal son and we don't hear the stuff that led up to the departure but it might have gone something similar to what I noted.
[time=960] And the son finally bursts out of the house saying I'm free, I'm free and in just a short
[time=966] season he is acting like an animal, he is living like an animal and he is eating with
[time=973] the animals.
[time=975] The father figured that would likely happen but the boy was so sure he knew where to find
[time=981] his freedom.
[time=982] So confident that life at home with the father was not his style.
[time=988] And so he begged the father until the father finally let him go.
[time=994] If you have a Bible with you this morning I invite you to turn to Romans chapter one and we'll continue to study this particular book, the passage that we come to this morning
[time=1005] is verses 24 to 32, chapter one verses 24 to 32 and three times in these verses a terrifying
[time=1014] phrase is repeated three times and verse 24 it says therefore God gave them over.
[time=1023] In verse 26 says it again God gave them over and again in verse 28 it says that God gave
[time=1034] them over.
[time=1038] This is a phrase describing one of the most terrifying events that could ever happen to a human being short of the eternal judgment and wrath of God.
[time=1047] This is what God does to people who continue to want to have it their way, who continue
[time=1053] to fight against him, who continue to push against his truth and fail to say in their hearts what Denise just sang a moment ago where you lead I will follow.
[time=1064] This is a description of God withdrawing his restraining and protective hand off the life of an individual.
[time=1072] This passage is about unbelievers and while unbelievers do not have the indwelling ministry
[time=1078] of the Holy Spirit they nevertheless enjoy a restraining force on their own life and
[time=1084] on the evil things around them a protective force the hand of God in their life.
[time=1092] But they can come to a place where God will in fact give them over and three times he
[time=1099] does that in this passage and we'll explain that as we go.
[time=1106] In Psalm 81 it says but my people did not listen to my voice and Israel did not obey
[time=1112] me so I gave them over to the stubbornness of their heart to walk in their own devices.
[time=1123] In Hosea chapter 4 verse 17 it says Ephraim that's another name for the northern tribes the northern kingdom.
[time=1129] Ephraim is joined to idols let him alone, let him alone.
[time=1139] Stephen preaching about the days of Moses and the golden calf God turned away and delivered
[time=1148] them up to serve the host of heaven.
[time=1153] God turned away and delivered them up to serve in other words the golden image that
[time=1159] they had created, Judges 10 13 therefore I will deliver you no more.
[time=1170] Second Chronicles 15 2 if you seek him he will let you find him but if you forsake him
[time=1180] he will forsake you.
[time=1185] Second Chronicles 24 20, Zechariah the son of Jadiah the priest why do you transgress
[time=1192] the commandments of the Lord and do not prosper?
[time=1197] Because you have forsaken the Lord and he also has forsaken you.
[time=1207] These are terrifying, terrifying moments in people's lives.
[time=1212] Why does this happen?
[time=1214] What do people do to bring God to the place that he lets them go?
[time=1219] Well look again at your text verse 18 it says that the wrath of God is revealed from heaven
[time=1226] against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men and here is what they do who suppress the truth in unrighteousness.
[time=1234] God turns men over, God gives up on people, God throws in the towel, God abandons people
[time=1242] when they suppress the truth, when they actively choose to suppress the truth in their unrighteousness.
[time=1252] You remember we studied this last week what truth?
[time=1256] Well verse 19 the truth that is known because that which is known about God is evident within
[time=1262] them for God made it evident to them well what truth that since the creation of the world his invisible attributes, his eternal power, his divine nature have been clearly seen being
[time=1273] understood through what has been made and they are without excuse.
[time=1280] They say I know who you are God that is not a question in my mind creation screams to
[time=1287] me your invisible attributes what are those his eternal power and his divine nature and
[time=1293] then you God make it evident inside of me that the evidence that is in creation gets made since to me by your spirit.
[time=1302] I know who you are I have no question as to who you are but then they say I do not want
[time=1310] you I do not want you verse 21 for even though they knew God they did not honor him as God
[time=1318] or give thanks.
[time=1320] They refuse to sing the song that Denise just saying.
[time=1325] They refuse to say look I do not know where we are headed.
[time=1329] I do not know what the implications are on my life of you being the invisible God of you being the one with the eternal power and the divine nature of me following and submitting to you I do not know what that all entails but I will just say it really clear right here right now I will go wherever you lead me I will follow you.
[time=1349] You are the one I will honor and glorify you are the one I will give thanks to regardless of what happens circumstantially in my life they refuse to say that why why do people refuse
[time=1361] to say that look again up at verse 18 they suppress the truth where they suppress it in unrighteousness that means their own sin John 3 19 says the light is coming to the world
[time=1373] meaning Jesus and men love the darkness rather than the light for their deeds were evil.
[time=1382] You say how in the world can human beings get all of this evidence of the divine creator
[time=1388] proclaimed to them by his creation have that same God make that evidence make sense in their
[time=1394] heart know who he is and then choose against him why do people do that they do that because
[time=1400] they love their sin they do that because they love their unrighteousness they do that because they love the darkness rather than the light.
[time=1412] I know who you are I do not want you and then the third statement they may care at the beginning
[time=1418] of this passage is and by the way I am smart not to want you verse 22 professing to be wise
[time=1425] they became fools they thought themselves enlightened they thought themselves advanced
[time=1431] they thought themselves sophisticated intelligent rational but the rejection of the true living
[time=1438] God choosing instead to hang on to their own sin they can call themselves wise but the reality
[time=1444] is they have become the greatest fools of all for no one is a greater fool who thinks himself wise when indeed he is a fool and then they say and by the way I not only know who you
[time=1455] are I do not want you I am smart not to want you and I want another I want another I will put another in your place but the other that I will put in your place will be of my own creation my own design and to serve my own purposes verse 23 the exchange the glory of
[time=1471] the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and of four footed animals and crawling creatures you say why why does God say I give you up it is
[time=1489] because of this progression of rebellion against him he finally says okay have it your
[time=1495] way you win I'm letting you go and as that truth suppressor walks out on God gleefully
[time=1506] slamming the door behind him he has no idea the gravity of the decision that he is making
[time=1516] God says you are free now you are free from my restraint you are free from my protection
[time=1523] you are free from my wooing my prompting and my tugging you are free I will no longer
[time=1532] restrain you as I have in the past and I will no longer restrain the evil one and his designs
[time=1539] against you as I have restrained him in the past remember Job Satan had a plan for Job
[time=1545] and and the Lord allowed Satan to do part of the plan but not all of the plan God restrained
[time=1553] the evil one in Job's life and set limits God is saying I will give them over I will
[time=1560] move the boundary of what I will allow the evil one to do to you now I will back it up
[time=1566] I will broaden his scope I will give him more permission in your life than he had before
[time=1572] remember Jesus said to Peter the evil one desires to sift you like wheat but I have prayed
[time=1578] for you in other words I will limit what the evil one will be able to do to you God gave
[time=1587] them over God gave them over God gave them over God with holds now to some degree his
[time=1595] restraining influence of their own wickedness in their own heart he lets that come to more
[time=1601] fruition and he also allows the designs of the evil one to come to greater fruition
[time=1607] on their life in this process Genesis 6 3 God says my spirit will not strive with man forever
[time=1618] God is slow to anger God is patient but enough is enough enough is enough came across to
[time=1631] powerful at least to me an illustration of this I want to read it to you if you have
[time=1639] been to the Niagara Falls you know there is a river above the falls and the further you
[time=1645] go up the river the quieter calmer and more placid the river seems to be but the closer you get to the falls the more rapid the river seems to flow and then there is the white water and eventually of course there is the crashing of the water over the falls in vision for teenage boys in a fishing boat they're out to three miles above the falls and they are rowing around and there is a rope from their boat all the way to shore where God
[time=1672] has a hold of the other end of the rope they want to explore the river downstream and so
[time=1680] they are heading downstream which is easy because the current is flowing that way and then the rope gets a little taunt and they say God give us more rope and God says you
[time=1691] don't want any more rope you don't know what is on the other side you really really you
[time=1697] don't want any more rope we want more rope we know what we are doing we're sixteen years old after all we know all about life reluctantly God gives them a little more rope actually
[time=1709] they start jerking hard on the rope and force a little out it gets to the point where they
[time=1715] are getting into white water and it's getting real fast and God is saying you you you don't want any more rope and they're saying what do you mean the river is getting really fast
[time=1725] white water we love the action let go of the rope cut us free cut us free we're sick and tired of you holding us back from all the fun that we are going to have down river
[time=1737] God is pleading with him don't don't do it as long as I still have this cord as long as
[time=1743] I still have this much impact on your life there's hope but young boys know better and
[time=1753] they start using filthy language and they start heaving stuff out off the boat and doing all kinds of despicable things for the last time God let us go and finally the broken
[time=1766] heart God relaxes his grip just just a little bit and the rope is gone and then the boys
[time=1775] are free they are so free and in a matter of moments they're dead free to kill themselves
[time=1784] free to take a trip to descend into a pit that cost them their lives now in the passage
[time=1795] in front of us here verses 24 to 32 this is exactly what is happening as I have said
[time=1803] God gives them over three different times the first time God gives them over to natural sin the second time that God gives them over he gives them over to unnatural sin then the
[time=1816] third time God gives them over he gives them over to a depraved mind to depraved mind
[time=1824] let's look at this verse 24 therefore God gave them over in the lusts of their heart
[time=1831] to impurity that their bodies might be dishonored among them for the exchange the truth of God
[time=1838] for a lie and worshiped and served the creator excuse me the creature rather than the creator
[time=1845] who is blessed forever amen this little phrase God gave them over is a judicial term it has
[time=1852] a judicial flavor to it in the New Testament it is used in the context of giving people over to a court giving them over to a judge giving them over to being sentenced giving
[time=1863] them over to the punishment giving them over even to execution this is a this is a formal
[time=1869] giving over to judgment and what God gives these people over to here is not a court or
[time=1875] a judge or a sentencing of any kind look at the text what God is doing is God is giving them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity God is giving them over not to a judge but
[time=1888] to the vile stuff that fills their heart God is giving them over to epithemia the word
[time=1895] for lust run away desires God is giving and broadening the boundaries and restraints that
[time=1901] he used to have on their own lusts and now he is letting them experience and have the sensation of and enter into and think longer about and imagine more clearly in the epithemia
[time=1915] the runaway craving all consuming desire to have this stuff satisfied the problem is that
[time=1922] these longings and these passions are vile because they come from their wicked heart they
[time=1929] come from their heart now of course when the Bible says heart it doesn't mean just the thing that beats inside your chest it doesn't just mean the seat of your emotion it means the heart is used to describe where you do all the big stuff you think and your reason and you choose and you feel and you long it is the sum total of what you are and God is saying that he gives them over to what is in their hearts which is impurity Jesus
[time=1956] just said it well in Matthew 15 for out of the heart come evil thoughts murderers adultries
[time=1965] fornication steps false witnesses and slandering these are the things which defile the man Jesus
[time=1972] was saying look it's not what you eat that defiles you it's not what you put in your system that defiles you it's what comes out of your system that defiles you you are evil you are
[time=1983] intrinsically sinful you are born in an adversarial position against God with a bent to do evil
[time=1992] that is the gift that comes to us through Adam and Eve in the fall that is that is who
[time=1998] we are and when God gives us over he gives us over to a fuller expression of the stuff that is in our hearts the evil fox the murders the adultries the fornications the thefts the
[time=2009] false witness the slandering Jeremiah of course the heart is more deceitful than all else and
[time=2017] is desperately sick there's a horrible condition and it is the condition of every human being
[time=2025] who's ever been born God turns men over to their own hearts desire he refuses now to restrict it he refuses now to protect them against it and some would say man great punishment
[time=2038] I mess up and you know I get involved in some kind of sexual sin and the way you choose to punish me God is you turn me over to more sexual sin great deal I mean you know I couldn't
[time=2050] think of it any better well think about all that for just a minute think about divorce
[time=2057] think about what happens when God when a man thinks about committing adultery and continues
[time=2063] to suppress the truth of God and then begins to enter into conversations with a woman who is not his wife and eventually begins to say things in that conversation that are entirely inappropriate and eventually it leads to an affair to adultery and that finally is exposed and so there's a divorce and as as a person is turned over more and more and more to that is that really a good thing I mean is it really enhance life these two people promising to love each other tell death do them part now utterly torn apart and devastated and destroyed you know anybody going through a divorce under these kind of conditions who say and give me some more of this this is wonderful you know anybody's children who are saying give us some more of this the insecurity that fills my heart the reason I can't sleep the the wedding of my bed the terror that I feel in the dark I mean give me some more of this this is good yeah turn me over some more you know anybody with these kind of divorces who looks forward to Christmas who looks forward to Easter who looks forward to those family gatherings where we're all supposed to get together but we don't know who to get to whether with when and where and how you see it it's the wrath of God isn't it it looks
[time=2131] like to the unbeliever it looks like more of the same it looks like more of what I want it looks like more pleasure it looks like more sex it looks like more whatever it is but in reality it is the wrath of God the natural consequences of people violating his
[time=2146] divine order begins to take its consequence in their life and it's it destroys them happens
[time=2152] not just sexually happens financially you know anybody right now who gave his heart or
[time=2159] his mind over to the notion that life consists of possessions began to lust after possessions
[time=2165] began to think about possessions live for possessions went out and brought all that stuff and is now under a mountain load of debt saying gee whiz give me some more of this how can I get
[time=2177] more of this in my life these people are stressed these people are in pain these people walk
[time=2183] around with a dark cloud over their head all the time because the weight of their financial debt and the enormity of the compounding interest and the impossibility of ever paying it all back and the emptiness of what they bought to be able to soothe the soul that is hurting
[time=2199] anybody around saying give me more of that sign me up for a second one of those but you know what as much as it hurts because God gives them over they sign up for it again as
[time=2212] in pain as they are they run after other women as in pain as they are they run after new things to buy it's insane isn't it absolutely insane because that's what fills the human
[time=2225] heart God gives them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity in that little phrase
[time=2231] the universe 24 that their bodies might be dishonored among them is why you understand that this text has principally a sexual theme to it the giving over is principally to sexual
[time=2243] things and in this case heterosexual behavior for an occasion adultery that kind of stuff
[time=2252] but look what it says in verse 25 they keep exchanging it's not that they're sinning in
[time=2262] the sense of what they're doing it's it's it's not the expression of this lust that continues this process that God continues to give them over it is now having been get over to the first time you continue verse 25 to exchange the truth of God for lie and worship and serve the creature rather than the creator who's blessed forever amen you get round one under
[time=2282] your belt you see the emptiness of sin you see the violence of your own heart you see the destruction that it brings on your family your friends your life your reputation everything you cared about and instead of repenting you go right on ahead and exchange some more truth of God for yet another lie in other words you come up with new explanations for the tragedy of your life you come up for new explanations as to why you will not honor God in fact most people in these kinds of conditions now have a vengeance against God they blaspheme him they defame his character because how could my life end up like this if God is a loving God when when the truth is they rejected him he gave them over because of that rejection and now instead of seeing the emptiness of life without God and repenting and coming back to God they come up with new lies they come up with new exchanges of the truth of God for yet another lie they come up with new systems to worship and serve the creature rather than the creator this is a recalcitrant heart this is a stiff-necked heart this is
[time=2340] a heart that refuses to do what it says in verse 22 21 to honor God and give thanks despite
[time=2346] the evidence and so over 26 he gives him over a second time it's amazing this time he gives
[time=2354] them over to unnatural sin unnatural sin and if you're visiting with us this morning
[time=2362] I just would acknowledge to you that I understand that what this text is saying runs completely
[time=2368] contrary to to what the popular opinion is about sex about the sexual liberation that
[time=2376] we hit in the 60s about the ever increasing affirmation and embracing of homosexuality
[time=2384] you know I don't live in a vacuum I understand that this runs completely contrary to that but if you can stay with this discussion long enough to at least hear what God has to say about this verse 26 for this reason God gave them over to degrading passions for their
[time=2402] women exchange the natural function for that which is unnatural in the same way also the
[time=2408] men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire towards one another men with men committing in decent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their heir now next Sunday we're going to devote to the topic of homosexuality so I'm not going to go into this a long long way I just want to point out that what the
[time=2430] Bible says is that this is the second point where God removes his restraint this is the
[time=2438] second place in this text where God says now I'm not going to hold you back from from what's in your heart and I'm not going to hold the evil one back from being able to affect you
[time=2448] and impact you with this kind of stuff it is described for the women as degrading passions
[time=2457] and they exchange here's yet another exchange first it was the truth about God for lie false religious system now the exchange is for what is natural verse 26 the natural way of having
[time=2469] sex a man and a woman for that which is unnatural two women having sex together verse 27 men
[time=2479] abandoned here it is the natural the normal the way it's supposed to be function of the woman and they they leave the woman behind and they begin to burn in their desire toward one another men with men committing in decent acts and receiving in their own persons the do penalty of their air the point I'd like to draw this morning from this portion of scripture
[time=2500] is there is a downward spiral here and I think you can see it in our culture we kind of broke
[time=2509] out of the restrictive as it was called narrow-minded prejudiced views of our forefathers of our culture
[time=2518] and I went through the sexual liberation movement in the 60s and free love was in vogue and Romans
[time=2526] one 24 came into full blossom God said okay you can have it you're a crowd calcitrant heart
[time=2533] you're demanding your own way pack your bags I'm going to I'm going to give you that kind of space and America found its way into more illicit sexual relationships home heterosexual
[time=2545] relationships than it ever seen in its entire existence and we saw the devastation to our
[time=2553] families we saw the devastation to our nation and to our culture and to our integrity and
[time=2560] to our children we saw it all but as a nation verse 25 we came up with new explanations for
[time=2568] all that stuff we again exchanged the truth of God for yet another lie we found new ways to worship the creature rather than the creator and so God is in the process of giving us over
[time=2580] to this second dimension of demonation homosexuality and you can see that is coming very rapidly now
[time=2589] to a whole new level in our country and it is being accepted in circles and it is being given
[time=2598] air and time and television and in movies and it's an amazing thing America is beginning to fully
[time=2608] embrace this next step of the wrath of God the lust in the heart if left unchecked and unrestrained
[time=2618] by God will migrate from the natural to the unnatural is the point the lust that fills our
[time=2626] heart the depravity that fills our hearts the stuff that finds its way into the hearts of the human by virtue of the fall if left unchecked by God will first leak out into heterosexual sin
[time=2639] and will eventually continue to corrupt until it finds its way into the degrading passions the exchange of the natural for the unnatural doesn't happen to everyone everyone doesn't do this
[time=2653] but it happens in general it happens to cultures and you are watching it and if you're here this morning again and you don't have a commitment to Christ and you're seeking
[time=2664] and you're thinking these things through there's a lot of ways to try to work on proving the Bible to people and trying to prove the existence of God but you know what this is gotta stand out hopefully in your mind this was written thousands of years ago and this is exactly what is happening in our day and age for these exact reasons when we bought evolution as opposed to creation
[time=2686] it led us shortly thereafter to the sexual revolution of the 60s which is leading us
[time=2692] full-fledged into this thing called homosexuality and it should at least give you a moment of thought maybe God did write this book
[time=2702] maybe I don't like some of the things it says but maybe he did write this book this is uncanny
[time=2710] the unnatural stuff is not just limited to homosexuality I mean you look around what's going on
[time=2716] we have child molestation hitting new levels on a regular basis that's unnatural
[time=2722] we have children killing their parents that's entirely unnatural
[time=2729] and now here's the one that y'all know I'm going to this is super super unnatural we have mothers
[time=2736] killing their children not all mothers but as God continues to remove the restraints
[time=2744] from our culture generally from individuals specifically we begin to tumble downward into this
[time=2752] this that are all the depravity of our hearts and we pick up momentum as we go
[time=2758] and as one decade the 60s moves us this far then the 70s moves this far and the 80s moves
[time=2766] and we just get this big snowball of stuff going and it is God turning us over
[time=2772] it is God taking his hands off of us and it's terrifying
[time=2778] then then there's a third thing that he says here about being turned over and this one also is
[time=2790] remarkably present in our culture verse 28 notice the beginning of verse 28 and just as they did
[time=2799] not see fit to acknowledge God any longer now I don't mean to beat this drum too hard but listen to that again so okay we go into heterosexual sin and depravity but instead of when we live in
[time=2810] down there in that mire instead of acknowledging we were wrong and repenting no we come up with new lies new exchanging of the truth for new lies verse 25 God gives us over into homosexuality
[time=2821] and instead of seeing the devastation that that begins to have on our culture and on our families and on our lives instead of saying oh God look at what you're doing we need to repent verse 28
[time=2833] we continue not to see fit to acknowledge God any longer we come up with new lies we come up with
[time=2839] new exchanges of the truth we come up with new reasons and new explanations never ever ever to
[time=2845] go back to verse 21 that we should just honor God and give him thanks that we should humble ourselves
[time=2852] live for the glory of God and be grateful for whatever he chooses to do in our lives so again this theme of truth suppressing you you suppress the truth God gives you over
[time=2864] you suppress the truth that that gives you he gives you over you suppress the truth of that gives you he gives you over until finally he's given you over to look at verse 28 a depraved mind
[time=2875] where do you suppress the truth in your mind finally he gives you a mind that no longer can think
[time=2881] like i think and that doesn't mean you're not brilliant that doesn't mean you can't do statistics or you know these people that amaze me with mathematics and these genius people who do science and these genes who utterly and totally are lost in this whole passage not saying they get
[time=2896] stupid saying they get foolish at a depraved mind the text says they get a depraved mind God
[time=2902] gave them over to a depraved mind you say what exactly is it a depraved mind well follow the
[time=2908] text for a minute look at verse 29 they are filled with all unrighteousness wickedness greed evil
[time=2916] full of envy and murder and strife and deceit and malice they are gossips slanders haters of God
[time=2923] insolent arrogant boastful and winners of evil disobedient to parents without understanding
[time=2930] untrustworthy unloving and unmerciful wow here it is verse 32 in order to pray the mind is here it is although they know the ordinances
[time=2943] of God that those who practice such things are worthy of death they not only do them
[time=2951] but then they give hearty approval to those who practice them that's a depraved mind it's a
[time=2957] couple of things number one a depraved mind is this it knows the ordinance of God it knows
[time=2963] that this heterosexual relationship outside of marriage is sin i got that i know that that also is not a question in my mind i know that this homosexual relationship is sin i know the
[time=2975] ordinance of God knowledge is not my problem furthermore i know look at verse 32 that when i
[time=2983] practice these things i am worthy of death i know that i am not going to escape judgment
[time=2990] for my continued movement against the ordinances of God that i also know and here is the ultimate of a depraved mind i continue to do them and i give hearty approval
[time=3003] to my friends who do the same that's a depraved mind you can be brilliant and have a depraved
[time=3010] mind you can be a genius and have a and knowledge is not the issue i know the ordinance of God i even know the consequence of breaking the ordinance of God is my own death but i continue to do it and then i slap my friends in the back for doing the same have you ever heard a group of men sitting around sharing a couple of beers talking about why they divorced their wives this is it this is it in technicolor and it typically goes something like this they start
[time=3036] by bashing their wives fat ugly demanding lazy controlling worthless whatever whatever they
[time=3045] can think of that fits her shortcomings boom they got that down in spades they never mentioned
[time=3052] themselves or what they would have done or what they might have contributed it's all there
[time=3058] they then migrate to begin to justify their adulterous affairs i was forced into it
[time=3066] what else what i do what could you possibly expect me to do next then they then they describe their divorce and then they describe their remarriage and by the
[time=3079] time they're done they have convinced themselves that what they did was the bright intelligent
[time=3085] reasonable rational loving thing to do she'll be happier i'll be happier which in fact might be true
[time=3093] but the reality is they know that that whole sequence of beginning to um fail to love their
[time=3101] wife pursue their wife begin to defame their wife to have outside affairs to go through them that whole they they know all that they know the ornaments of god they know that those who practice that are worthy of death they do it and then they sit around and cheer each other on for
[time=3116] doing it you've seen these television shows and you've seen these news shows where celebrity power
[time=3127] celebrity opinion makers get on and they begin to give party approval to the decadence of our society
[time=3134] they give evidence of a depraved mind and as our society listens to that and begins to parent
[time=3142] that back our society gives evidence of yet being turned over by god a third time to having a depraved mind so in many ways there you have the last 30 years in american history
[time=3158] written right there for you in the scriptures several thousand years before it occurred
[time=3165] and it happens this way over and over and over again in societies throughout time so what are we saying this morning abandoned by god
[time=3175] god begins to take his hands off the restraining protective role of the unsaved person why
[time=3186] because the unsaved person takes the truth that god gives them and says i know who you are i don't want you i'm smart not to want you i want another god because of that continued rejection gives them over in the lust of their hearts first to
[time=3201] natural sin secondly to unnatural sin and thirdly to a depraved mind
[time=3207] these three turning overs are the wrath of god on their life you know people say hey if america
[time=3216] keeps going the way it goes man god is gonna let it go on us i mean we're just gonna bring wrath what i'm telling you is he already is the fact that this cycle is in motion let's you know god is
[time=3230] already bringing wrath against our country it's not something he's gonna do in the future it's something he's doing right now we're in the process of it now i may have a cataclysmic
[time=3239] expression and we may be destroyed by some enemy nation or we may collapse some of the weight of our own dad or whatever it is i mean yeah there could be more of that but this we're in it right now we're living the wrath of god in america it's being unveiled now as we close i want to give you the great news and this is where i'm so glad that we have a
[time=3259] worship package scheduled here to kind of tidy this thing up listen to me now joys this is who this is who i am joys this is who you are
[time=3270] short of the grace of god this is us right here this text this is us but for the grace of god
[time=3276] now if you don't think so you come back in a couple of weeks i'll talk about the self-righteous person that paul wants to talk about in Romans 2 and you think you're so good this could never apply to you and you're okay without all this help and you don't do those things in fact you're not sure you need jesus you're so morally right and upstanding you come on back next a couple weeks from now we'll talk about you but for the rest of us who see a little more clearly that ours isn't a problem with self-righteousness ours is a problem with the gravity remember at look 15 when the father finally let his son go but the text says that the father was
[time=3306] gazing the father indicates that the text indicates that the father though he had let his son go with half of his inheritance kept a wary eye on the horizon hoping that one day his son would come back in that text it says that that young man finally came to his senses he was down or eaten like an
[time=3322] animal eaten with the animals and eaten what the animals eat and he says the text says he finally came to his senses in other words having spent all that he had and having got to move the
[time=3331] restraining hand off he finally was in a position to see himself for how wicked and desperate he
[time=3337] truly was and he got up and he went home and when he got there the father threw a party clothed them gave him a ring and threw a big feast in 1st Corinthians 6 it talks about
[time=3349] fornicators and it talks about adulterers and it talks about the effeminate and it talks about homosexuals and it says this such were some of you but you were washed you see the great message
[time=3361] is that while you're living even though God is slowly turning you over to his wrath he has a
[time=3367] redemptive purpose in the turning over and his hope is that you like the prodigal son will fall
[time=3374] to such depths that you can no longer avoid the inescapable conclusion that you're in desperate trouble and you need to repent of your sin and Isaiah 1922 it says he smites that he might heal
[time=3390] God smites that he might heal so on 1st 1971 it was good for me that I was afflicted
[time=3398] who comes to Christ who comes to Christ Jesus says the people who come to Christ are poor in spirit
[time=3408] they're emotionally spiritually bankrupt by their own sin they see they see how how they have nothing
[time=3415] they're they're broke spiritually what a better place to find that out than eating with the pigs
[time=3421] who comes to Christ those who are broken hearted over their sin those who are hungering and thirsting
[time=3427] for righteousness what better posture to find in your heart hungering and thirsting for righteousness and when you've seen the fullness of your own sin lived out as God has taken his hands off you and let you go as God has taken his hands off of culture and let it go so the both you and your culture can run off into your sin and find yourself to be the sinful wicked desperately impoverished individual that you are so there is in this the golden thread of God's redeeming grace and again as I say as long as you
[time=3462] have breath though God may be giving you over to his wrath as long as you are living there is
[time=3469] always his hope there is always the hope that he has that eventually somehow in the further revealing of your own sin you'll turn to Christ our gracious God and heavenly father we've got
[time=3481] Christ right in the crosshairs he's in our focus he is at the forefront of our hearts and our minds
[time=3488] as we have sung these songs and that is exactly where he belongs we are never more like we ought to be
[time=3496] than we are then when we are standing on our feet reflecting and praising
[time=3502] you for your son and for his great work on the cross for our sins thank you for this great event
[time=3510] this morning of celebration together thank you for your son thank you for forgiveness thank you for
[time=3516] that great day we have thought about already this morning when at the end of the age we all sing together in heaven worthy is the land we love you and pray these things in Christ's name
