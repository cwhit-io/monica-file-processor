[time=30] Paul has been saying that sin has so bent us over and made us to stoop under the weight
[time=48] of our own guilt and the enormity of God's wrath in our life, blind, crippled and crooked
[time=55] under the weight of sin. All of us, Gentile and Jew alike, wicked and self-righteous alike,
[time=63] lost in a miserable condition of our own blindness being crippled and crooked, we have no hope of recovery. It is a condition we cannot ourselves solve any more than the blind man could have solved his condition, the crippled man could have solved his condition or the one stooped. All the king's horses and all the king's men could not put us back together
[time=83] again, but now says chapter 3 verse 21, the reality is that God has a son.
[time=98] This is the Sunday morning worship service of Blackhawk Baptist Church. Thank you for joining us. Pastor Moore's series on the Book of Romans continues today with a look at how to be right with God. We hope you'll stay tuned. Now let's join our service.
[time=138] Lord, I go but to the one who was waiting for me.
[time=153] No effort at his feet. He brought me to his side and embraced away my pain and misery.
[time=178] Only his love could show me my need. And only his blood could set my heart free.
[time=200] Reaching. Reaching. I've been born with the plans. Reaching by the blood of his sacred
[time=220] eyes. He has wrapped up his captain. Set his prayers over me. I will sing his praise
[time=239] for him. I am redeemed. As I walk through this life, there are uncertain times when I lose
[time=262] my heart. Are the reason I am healed. Should I give him to sin or allow for him to be?
[time=282] I wonder, how can he forgive? Then I'm reminded, your faithless, he loves me faith me.
[time=302] In a moment I've been born with his grace. It's a vision for me. Reaching by the blood
[time=323] is a vision for me. He has wrapped up his captain. Set his brother free. He has seen his praise
[time=347] as well forever. He has seen his praise as well forever.
[time=365] He has seen his praise as well forever. He has seen his praise as well forever.
[time=399] I will sing his praise. He has seen his praise as well forever.
[time=410] He has seen his praise as well forever.
[time=433] Hi and welcome to the Bible Hour. It's great to have you watching this morning and trust
[time=449] that our time together around God's Word will be profitable and encouraging as you walk with the Lord. One of the unique and wonderful ministries that our church has is a Christian
[time=461] school. And our Christian school has over 500 kids in it now. We are from kindergarten
[time=467] all the way up to 12th grade. And it's a tremendous opportunity. And I've asked the principle
[time=474] of our school a dear friend of mine, Steve Longbreak. If he'd come, I think registration is starting up pretty soon and we want to give you folks an update on our ministry at the school and how possibly your kids could even be a part. Hi Steve. Hi Russell.
[time=488] We're starting to open up registration. That will happen tomorrow, Monday, March 9th.
[time=494] And our school started 25 years ago because some people at the church here really wanted
[time=500] their children to have an opportunity to have Christian people open the Word of God when they wanted to, pray when they wanted to, and to teach from a Christian perspective, English and science and math and all those subjects that everybody else teaches, but from a little different slant. So we have a different philosophy and I'd encourage you to consider what that
[time=520] might mean to your family. That maybe with a teacher who is really praying for your child
[time=527] and you know a lot of teachers in the public school can do that as well. But then we have freedom here to open the Word and really teach what it has to say in each of those classes that I mentioned before. And we've had a tremendous blessing here at Blackhawk Christian School. Our kindergarten through 12th grade began to double track in 1987. And at this
[time=548] point this next year we'll be kindergarten through 9th grade with two classes per grade level. And so we have some openings in some of those classes because we have been able to double those in size. And we're looking forward to really having a great year next year as we double that 10th grade and get them started in biology and everything they're doing. The key here though is our teachers love Christ. And every day they realize the
[time=572] impact they can have on your children as they work with them. And so I'd encourage you to consider what you might be able to do for your family by calling us. Blackhawk Christian
[time=583] School is on 7400 East State Street and the phone number is 4937470 if you're interested.
[time=592] You can call a high school there. The elementary is 4937400. So I'd encourage you to think
[time=598] that over. You know, when we were moving here from California about six and a half years ago, one of the things that the church made sure happened to me and my wife was to take
[time=609] a tour of the school. And it's one of the greatest decisions that we've ever made.
[time=617] Come into this city and having our kids in this particular school. And it's not just that. And I think you've said this. It's not just that the Bible gets taught. There's an atmosphere of love and support, academic excellence, the pursuit of excellence in general
[time=631] that I see reflected in my kids and character, man, character is the issue. And it's an amazing
[time=639] thing. And we've really been fortunate to be able to link together families who are like-minded and teachers that have that same philosophy about life and be able to instruct
[time=649] our kids at homes, you know, all around the city as they visit with families that they have Christ in common with. That's really true. Well, I'll tell you, one of the things
[time=659] I just want to say to you who are watching the Bible Hour and as you make this decision, if you have children in these grades, I was praying earlier today, kind of just thanking
[time=669] the Lord for blessings in my life. And I know I grew up in a very confusing day and in a
[time=678] very confusing world. Because what I was taught at home, the biblical things I was taught at home, those were not taught and supported at the school. And so most of my friends,
[time=688] you know, that peer pressure thing, even in the fourth and fifth grade, they believed completely different things than my parents believed, and my church believed, and I was really confused on that stuff. And it wasn't until I was in my 20s that that stuff finally settled down and I felt really at peace. And I think if you're seeing any of that in the life of your child, Black Hawk Christian School is a phenomenal option. Call us if we can help you. 493 7400. God bless you, and thanks for being with us today.
[time=716] Let me invite you to open up to Romans. And let's read the passage this morning. We're
[time=723] going to continue Russell's going to continue to take us through this great book this morning and let's take a look at verses 21 to 31 in Romans chapter 3. Romans chapter 3 verse
[time=737] 21, it starts right there and it says this, "But now, apart from the law, the righteousness
[time=743] of God has been manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets, even the righteousness
[time=749] of God, through faith in Jesus Christ, for all those who believe, for there is no distinction,
[time=756] for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. Being justified as a gift by
[time=763] his grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus, whom God displayed publicly
[time=769] as a propitiation in his blood through faith. This was to demonstrate his righteousness because
[time=775] in the forbearance of God, he passed over the sins previously committed. For the demonstration,
[time=781] I say, of his righteousness at the present time that he might be just and the justifier
[time=787] of the one who has faith in Jesus. Where then is boasting? It is excluded by what kind
[time=794] of law of works? No, but by a law of faith. For we maintain that a man is justified by
[time=801] faith, apart from works of the law. Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of
[time=808] Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also, since indeed God, who will justify the circumcised
[time=815] by faith and the uncircumcised through faith is one. Do we then nullify the law through faith? May it never be. On the contrary, we establish the law.
[time=827] I believe in faithfulness. I believe in giving of myself for someone else. I believe in peace
[time=848] and love. I believe in honesty and trust, but it's not enough. For all that I believe
[time=862] may never change the way it is unless I believe that Jesus lives. Where there is faith, there
[time=877] is a voice calling. Keep walking. You're not alone in this world. Where there is faith,
[time=891] there is a peace like a child sleeping, a hope everlasting in me. Who is able to bear
[time=904] every burden to you, every hurt in my heart? It is a wonderful, powerful place where there
[time=927] is a man across the sea, never heard the sound of freedom, only in his dreams. There is a
[time=944] lady dressed in black, in a motorcade of catalacts, daddy's not coming back, and our hearts begin
[time=957] to fall, and our stability grows weak, but Jesus meets our needs. If we only believe
[time=969] where there is faith, there is a voice calling. Keep walking. You're not alone in this world.
[time=983] Where there is faith, there is a peace like a child sleeping, a hope everlasting in me.
[time=996] Who is able to bear every burden to you, every hurt in my heart? It is a wonderful, powerful
[time=1014] place where there is faith.
[time=1027] Oh, oh, oh, oh, where there is faith, oh, oh, oh, where there is faith, there is a voice
[time=1052] calling. Keep walking. You're not alone in this world. Where there is faith, there is
[time=1065] peace like a child sleeping, a wonderful, powerful place where there is faith, where there is
[time=1083] faith. Let me invite you to open your Bibles this morning to Romans chapter three, Romans
[time=1095] chapter three and verse 21. As you've noticed this morning from the reading already begins with two very significant words. Well, little words really, but in the context of this book,
[time=1108] they're huge words and they are but now. Life was going along a certain way, but now it's
[time=1114] going a completely different direction. I was thinking about some other experiences outside the scripture like that. My mind went to the single waitress living out. I think it was Colorado not too many years ago whose life was hard. She struggled to make ends meet.
[time=1128] She was living on waitresses, wages and had financial struggles and difficulties as you might experience. But if she were to tell you the story, she'd say, but now everything's different. Remember a couple of years ago that was the gal that won the $79 million lottery ticket? She gets $4 million a year, $100,000 a week. Things are different these
[time=1149] days in her life and hopefully not for the worst because that kind of money can really do you some damage. But now, you know, I was struggling, I was striving, I was attempting.
[time=1159] I took it once, I took it twice and I finally passed the bar exam and now I'm a lawyer.
[time=1165] I get to practice law. Same thing can be said of a doctor, what it must feel like after all those years of education and training and pursuit and study to finally be a full fledged bonafide physician. A coach who finally wins a national championship and his whole
[time=1181] career really is now at rest because he's done it. But now I've won. I was thinking of
[time=1188] these kinds of illustrations and the ones that seem most dramatic to me were the people who for years, some of them their entire life, that had been suffering a physical ailment.
[time=1200] But who were instantly healed by Christ. Remember the guy in John chapter 9, he was born with a blindness. He was born blind. He'd never seen a sunset. He'd never seen a bird in flight.
[time=1211] He'd never seen the face of his parents. You know what I mean? All of his life, he'd say, "I'd never seen any of these things but now." You see, now I sit on a knoll every evening
[time=1223] at the top of the mountain there and watch the sunset. Now I not only see birds, I'm a bird watcher. I've learned their names. I've studied their habits. But now I see my
[time=1234] parents and really I'm going to be a parent because I can see now and I can work now and I've found a wife and we're going to have children of our own. John chapter 5 tells
[time=1246] a but now story, the lame man at the pool of Bessadia for 38 years and his sickness.
[time=1251] He said, "I have no man to put me in the pool when the water is stirred up. God would occasionally send an angel and stir the water of the pool. The first person to get their body in there would be healed of their sickness." And he'd been there potentially a long, long time, 38 years in his sickness. But while I am coming, another steps down before me. He met Jesus.
[time=1270] Jesus instantly and completely transformed his sickness and removed completely. His illness
[time=1276] arise, take up your pallet and walk and the text says immediately. But now the man became
[time=1282] well, took up his pallet and began to walk. Amazing transitional points in people's lives.
[time=1289] The dear crippled woman in Luke chapter 13 who for 18 years the text says was bent over
[time=1295] double and crippled. She was crooked. She couldn't stand up straight. Jesus had a but now experience with her. "Woman, you are freed from your sickness." And it says immediately.
[time=1306] She was made erect and she began to glorify God. People caught and locked in a miserable
[time=1314] condition of blindness, being crippled, being doubled over with no hope of recovery. All the king's men and all the king's horses couldn't put Humpty Dumpty back together again. And
[time=1325] then they encountered Christ. And Christ gave them a but now experience. I was blind but
[time=1332] now I see. I was crippled but now I walk. I was crooked but now I'm straight. If you
[time=1341] get a sense of the excitement and the energy and the never looking back experience represented in some of these illustrations you'll have some sense for the spiritual dynamic that's going on in chapter 3 verse 21 but now. But now apart from the law, the righteousness
[time=1359] of God has been manifest. Verse 22, "Even the righteousness of God through faith in Christ
[time=1366] for all those who believe." In the early parts of the book of Romans, Paul has been working
[time=1374] in chapter 1, 2, and 3 to establish our blindness. Spiritually blind. He's been working to show
[time=1381] us how crippled we actually are, unable even to walk in the paths of righteousness. How
[time=1388] crooked, how bent, how heavy we stoop under the load of guilt and shame in the very wrath
[time=1394] of God. Sin has made us blind to the beauty and the splendor and the majesty of God. And
[time=1400] as a result we reject Him as He has hailed it to us in creation. And we worship another God, God's of our own imagination which lead us into further corruption and sin. Sin he
[time=1410] says in Romans 1, 2, and 3 has so crippled us to the point that we can no longer walk
[time=1416] in love. All we do is hurt each other and use each other and bring pain into each other's lives. Paul has been saying that sin has so bent us over and made us to stoop under the
[time=1427] weight of our own guilt and the enormity of God's wrath in our life. Blind, crippled
[time=1433] and crooked under the weight of sin. All of us, Gentile and Jew alike, wicked and self-righteous
[time=1441] alike, lost in a miserable condition of our own blindness being crippled and crooked.
[time=1448] We have no hope of recovery. It is a condition we cannot ourselves solve any more than the blind man could have solved his condition. The crippled man could have solved his condition or the one stooped. All the king's horses and all the king's men could not put us back
[time=1463] together again. But now, says chapter 3 verse 21, the reality is that God has a son. God
[time=1473] has a son. The king had a son. The king's horses. The king's men. But the king had
[time=1479] a son and that son can change everything. He can remove our blindness. He can cause us
[time=1486] to see the beauty and the majesty and the wonder and the glory of God and where we were rejecting him and committing idolatrous sins and walking in the foolishness and the darkness of our own mind we can now fall prostrate in our hearts and give him the glory and the honor that is due his name. We can finally see him for who he is and then spontaneously
[time=1505] erupt with the kind of worship that is due to God of his glory and magnitude and wonder and splendor. His son can heal our crippled condition. We can long now to love one another.
[time=1518] We can try to help and serve and minister and give in some of the deepest pains now that fill our hearts are the times when we fail to love the people we love. He can heal our
[time=1531] bent over condition. He can lift off of our hearts, our minds, our souls and our conscience,
[time=1537] the enormous weight of our own guilt for our own sin and the wrath of God bearing down upon it. And we now can wake up in the morning with a sense of his love, a sense of his pleasure.
[time=1548] We can feel the joy springing up in our hearts knowing that we are right with God because God has a son who can give us a but now experience. I was unto the wrath of God, but now I have
[time=1566] his grace. I was spiritually dead, but now I'm spiritually alive. I was utterly lost
[time=1573] in my sin, but now I am found. I was proven guilty by the record of my own sinfulness,
[time=1580] but now I am declared righteous. I was rightfully condemned, but now I have been forgiven. These
[time=1588] two small insignificant words in any other context take on a whole new meaning, don't they? When you find them here in Romans chapter 3 verse 21, you say, "How does all this happen?"
[time=1599] How does the but now experience happen? Well the text could be preached on for 100 years and never ever ever be exhausted. This is the most powerful, most concise and clear statement of the gospel anywhere in all of the Scriptures. But for our purposes this morning I want to
[time=1615] try to gather some thoughts under three main headings. How does this happen? One, God gives us his righteousness. Number two, God redeems us from our sin. And number three, God satisfies
[time=1627] his own wrath. How does the but now experience happen? How does a life get transformed? How
[time=1634] do we go from judgment to grace, from death to life? Well it's very simple. God gives us
[time=1642] his righteousness. God redeems us from our sin and God satisfies his own wrath. The age old question, "How can a man be just with God?" is what Job said. The rich young ruler said, "Teacher, what good things shall I do that I may obtain eternal life?" The Philippian
[time=1658] jailer and the tail end of that great localized earthquake said this, "What must I do to be
[time=1664] saved?" And the answer is nothing. Nothing. You're blind, you're crippled and you're crooked
[time=1673] and there is nothing you can do. There is no good thing Jesus eventually said to the rich
[time=1679] young ruler. It is all what God has done for us and the person of his son. In his son he
[time=1688] has given us the very righteousness of God. And through his son he has redeemed us from
[time=1696] our sin. Through the punishment he brought upon his son he has satisfied his own wrath.
[time=1703] He can do nothing except exercise our faith in the work of Christ. Romans tells us that
[time=1710] man can be right with God but it cannot be done by man. It cannot be done on man's terms
[time=1716] by the means of the human achievement or by the purposes of man. It happens and it only happens when God gives his righteousness, when God redeems from sin and when God satisfies his own wrath. So let's look at it this morning as it unfolds in the text. Number one, God gives us his righteousness. I was condemned. I was guilty of moral treason against God
[time=1739] but now I have been given the very righteousness of God. Verse 21. But now apart from the law,
[time=1748] the righteousness of God, I love that phrase. If you have a pen with you this morning underline it, the righteousness of God, it happens again in the next verse. Again though, verse 21, but now apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets. Again verse 22. Even here it is, the righteousness of God.
[time=1767] I mean it's like Paul is stunned and shocked. You know what you get? You get the righteousness
[time=1773] of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all those who believe. You see, if you understand
[time=1782] anything about the economy of God, when you start getting offered the righteousness of
[time=1788] God, this is not a relative goodness. This is not an occasional righteousness. This is
[time=1796] not a now and again and a then performance of a nice kind thoughtful deed. This is describing
[time=1802] absolute, pure, total, complete righteousness and it only has one source. The Old Testament
[time=1809] says the righteousness of God falls from heaven like the dew of the morning. It only can be found in God Himself and if a man is ever going to be saved, if a woman is ever going to be saved, it will only be as they are given this special, unique, pure, holy righteousness
[time=1826] of God. One person I was learning from this week had an illustration, I think is helpful
[time=1833] at this point. He says, imagine that some wealthy eccentric baseball fanatics got together
[time=1839] and decided too many mediocre ball players had been winding up in the Hall of Fame. It
[time=1845] lost its value and prestige because too many no names kept ending up abducted or inducted
[time=1852] into the Hall of Fame. So they met these wealthy eccentric baseball fanatics to formulate a new honor society of professional baseball players. They're going to call it the All-Universe
[time=1865] Players Association and it's going to be a big, big deal. There's going to be unprecedented media coverage for anyone who finally performs his way into the All-Universe Association.
[time=1876] Upon induction, the player receives a gift, $25 million, a home in Palm Springs and many
[time=1882] other lesser but very interesting gifts and awards. But these eccentric wealthy baseball
[time=1889] fanatics have some entrance requirements into the All-Universe Association. First of
[time=1895] all, you have had to have played for at least five years. No rookies allowed. Now beyond that initial requirement, there are two others. The first is you must play your entire career
[time=1910] without committing a single error, not one. That means no throwing errors, no fielding
[time=1917] errors, no pass balls, no wild pitches, no box, no getting picked off base, no getting caught stealing a base, error-free baseball. The second requirement is that the player
[time=1929] must bat, you guessed it, a thousand. He must get a hit every time he steps to the plate.
[time=1935] No fly out, no way strike out, no fielder's choice. Any of that stuff, it's all over.
[time=1941] Got to bat a thousand. Two simple requirements into the Elite All-Universe Players Association.
[time=1951] Now think about it. Who do you know that's gone error-free? Some of you know more than I do because I don't know a lot about baseball, but Steve Garvey did. Steve Garvey actually had a season in which he did not make one single error the entire time. Guess what he batted that season? 284. 284. And guess what he did in the next season? Had a whole bunch
[time=1970] of errors. The highest batting average to my records in the history of baseball is held
[time=1976] by Hugh Duffy, 1894. He batted 438. Best guy ever, separate of the plate, 438. The standard
[time=1987] is a thousand. And in the year that Hugh Duffy did that, batted 438. You know how many errors
[time=1993] he had? 27. See, it ain't going to happen, is it? It's just not going to happen. No human
[time=2002] being is ever going to play, not one year, their entire baseball career without an error
[time=2009] and every time they step in the plate, batted a thousand. The righteousness of God is an
[time=2016] absolute standard. And it is very similar to this entrance requirement as stated. Number
[time=2023] one, to have the righteousness of God, you must never commit an error. You must never sin. You must never, in your words, your thoughts, your deeds, your behavior, your motives from
[time=2035] the moment you were born until the moment you die, you must never, ever commit even one sin.
[time=2044] That is the standard of the righteousness of God. But more than that, it's to be righteous,
[time=2050] it isn't just to abstain from sinful things. It is always to do the right thing. You got
[time=2058] sins of co-mission, the sins you do, and then you got sins of omission, the times you should have loved, the times you should have sacrificed, the times you should have given up, all the things you are compelled to do for other people. And that I guess is represented in batting
[time=2074] a thousand. You not only can't make any errors, you got to knock it out of the park. In every relationship you're in, every time you step up to the plate, people you know, people you don't know, people you love, people you don't love, enemies, strangers, friends, family, spouses. See, it just ain't going to happen, is it? That's why when God begins to say He
[time=2098] had got something for you. I'm going to give you the righteousness of God. He's talking
[time=2107] about something incredible. He's talking about, it's as if you had never committed an error
[time=2115] and you had always been out of the thousand. And that's the incredible thing about Christ.
[time=2122] That is the incredible thing about Christ. Look at verse 22 again, "Even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ." Why in Christ? Why does the faith, why does God
[time=2134] give His righteousness through faith in Christ? Why does the sentence read that way? Why can't
[time=2141] it just say God will give you the righteousness of God if you try hard or some other ending
[time=2147] that why is Christ tied into this? Because my friends Christ is the one who lived error free and who batted a thousand. Christ is called the sinless Lamb of God. The Bible tells us
[time=2159] that Christ was tempted in all points as we are yet without sin. Christ as He lived from
[time=2165] His birth until His death on His earth was tempted in every conceivable possible way
[time=2171] that human beings get tempted yet He never wants sin, error free living. Hebrews 7 calls
[time=2177] Him holy, innocent and undefiled. But beyond that, not only did He not sin, not only was
[time=2185] He abstaining from that which was evil, He batted a thousand. He always loved everyone perfectly.
[time=2193] There were no sins of omission in the life of Christ. Jesus said in John 8, "I do nothing
[time=2199] of my own initiative. I always do the things that are pleasing to Him." What you find in
[time=2207] Christ is the best illustration and the best way to get your hands around what is the righteousness
[time=2213] of God. It is to be absolutely, totally pure and separated from any evil, no sin. And it
[time=2219] is to be totally, completely given in your heart and your behavior to love to the glory of God. And Jesus did both all the time. And so He gives us, He gives us the righteousness
[time=2236] of God. It is an amazing thing. Back to the opening illustrations, He does not give partial
[time=2242] sight. When He healed the blind man, the blind man didn't get like one good eye and one bad eye. The blind man didn't need contacts and glasses. The blind man was given perfect sight.
[time=2252] And so when God heals us of our spiritual blindness, He gives us the righteousness of God, not submitigated, half-hearted, almost their righteousness, but the full orb, righteousness of God which is embodied in Christ. The man he healed didn't hobble. He had gone from not
[time=2270] being able to walk at all. Now all I healed you, you can hobble. No, it was 100% ability to walk with total complete freedom instantly. Boom, get up and walk and He did. She didn't
[time=2280] stand halfway erect or with slumped shoulders, there was no evidence remaining of her disease.
[time=2288] So God gives us the righteousness of God. It's an amazing thing. And it requires a great
[time=2295] exchange. I call it the great exchange. There's a verse out there in 2 Corinthians 5.21 that
[time=2303] says this, that God made Him Jesus. That He who knew no sin to become sin on our behalf
[time=2312] that we might become the righteousness of God. And there's two exchanges going on. The first one is when we give to Christ all of our sin. He who knew no sin became sin. And
[time=2322] He didn't become sin because He was a sinner or that He sinned. He became sin because He took all of our sin. The only way that we could ever have the righteousness of God was first to be divested of all of our unrighteousness. And so we had to give it to somebody and so we gave it all to Christ. And so Christ became sin and not just sin and generally became your sin and my sin and all the sins of all of humanity wrapped up in Christ. He who knew
[time=2346] no sin became sin that we might become what? The righteousness of God. And so Jesus in turn
[time=2353] gives us His very righteousness, absolute and total perfection. It's called the great exchange.
[time=2361] It's the greatest deal going. And it is the only way to be saved. The only way to be saved
[time=2368] is to give your unrighteousness to Christ and to let Christ give His righteousness to you. And here's the great thing. He'll give it to everybody and anybody. Look again at the end of verse 22. See it says the righteousness of God through faith in Christ. Look at the
[time=2382] word all. For all those who believe, the end of the verse 22, for there is no distinction.
[time=2388] What do you mean no distinction? Verse 23, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. What are the two distinctions in people that Paul has made so far in the book? There are Gentiles and there are Jews. He's proven that both Gentile and Jew, the one wicked, the one
[time=2405] self-righteous wicked, they are all condemned and under wrath and under the law, their mouths need to stop, they are accountable to God. And so he breaks the news of the but now, you can actually have, instead of wickedness and condemnation and wrath, I've got the righteousness of God
[time=2421] here. He makes it very clear and by the way, it extends to both. It extends to everybody. There
[time=2427] is no distinction. Why? Because you've all sinned. And the point of verse 23 isn't to show how sinful we are. It is to show how savable we all are. We are all savable. God will give His righteousness
[time=2442] to anyone without distinction that would put their faith in Christ. It's an amazing thing.
[time=2452] So where I was condemned and lost, but now I have the righteousness of God. And of course,
[time=2463] point of clarification here, the righteousness of God is something that is given to us. And you've
[time=2472] got to understand that God lives outside of time and space. And you and I, though having received
[time=2479] the very righteousness of God, we're still kind of living our way through this thing. And the Bible, as you'll find in the later chapters of Romans, is very clear. We never cease from sin. We actually never stop the sinning. But the gift of God is the righteousness of God that the transfer that
[time=2496] happens, our sin, it's all of our sin, even though we haven't sinned it yet. It's the sin we're gonna sin before now and the time we die. That's why salvation is for all your sins past, present and future. And it's hard for us to understand that because we're so sequential. But we will not actually live like what we are until after we're dead and we get resurrected. And then comes our
[time=2517] perfect practice. But it is nevertheless the gift of the complete full or unmitigated pure
[time=2525] righteousness of God that comes to us through faith in Christ Jesus. Number two,
[time=2535] how do I have a but now experience with God? Well, tell you what, He redeems us from our sin. Number two, He redeems us from our sin. And the point Paul is making here is this. I was sold. Science
[time=2547] sealed delivered and sold. I was bound and I was enslaved by sin. Sin owned me. I was sold into the
[time=2555] marketplace of sin and sin was my master's sin dominated me. And though I might eke out a good deed from time to time, the pattern of my life was sin. The characteristic pattern of my life was sin because I am a sinner and I have been sold to sin and I was under the mastery of sin.
[time=2569] I was in the domain of sin. People who yet know Christ, people who are unsaved, have the hardest
[time=2579] time admitting to themselves that they are sinful to the core of their being. They'll admit happily
[time=2587] to being a little selfish from time to time and not quite meeting the standard over here. And I did this over there, that there's almost an aura of humility in their willingness to admit some
[time=2598] akin, but ask them to admit that the core of their being, the innermost part of who they are, is sinful and in bondage to sin until, oh, I've done bad things, but don't call me a bad person.
[time=2610] I've done sinful things, but don't call me a sinner. You see, the truth that Paul has been
[time=2617] trying to establish in Romans 1, 2, and 3 is that, yeah, you do bad things. You want to know why you do bad things? Because you are a sinner. You are bound up with sin. You are entwined with sin.
[time=2627] You are under the mastery of sin. You're in the domain of sin. It's just all that, what you are.
[time=2633] And so you come to a passage like this and you find out that God in verse 24 justifies us as a gift
[time=2640] by His grace through, here it is, the redemption, which again is in Christ Jesus. Man, today,
[time=2647] want to redeem something? Somebody gives you some coupons for Mike's car wash. You redeem the coupon. You go down there and get your car wash. You want to redeem a lottery ticket. You go down there and cash it in. One of the gazillion people get to do that. See, in Paul's day, the word redeem didn't bring to mind Mike's car wash and the lottery. It brought to mind a place called
[time=2669] the agura. When you heard the word redemption, your mind flashed to the scenes you'd seen at the agura. The agura was the place where human beings, men and women, would stand up on a seller's block,
[time=2682] start naked in front of a whole crowd of potential bidders and they would be sold in that marketplace
[time=2689] for whatever the highest bidder would grant. The place of agura. Now personalize it, I want you
[time=2695] to see your sister standing naked on that block in front of a bunch of people there in the city of
[time=2702] Fort Wayne and they have been empowered by a corrupt government now to buy, to purchase, to own as a piece of property your own sister, maybe worse your daughter, maybe worse your son. What
[time=2716] do you got that matters to you in this life? Put them up, strip them naked and let them be bid on
[time=2722] by people who view them for their potential usefulness. Let me ask you a question if that
[time=2731] happened and your sister or your daughter or your son got sold for $10,000 and they were carted
[time=2739] off into the captivity of their new slave owner and that slave owner could do anything. I mean anything he or she wanted to do because they were not considered humans, they were considered
[time=2749] property like a car or an ox or a shovel. They could be killed, they could be raped, they could be sold, they could be worked from morning until night, anything, doesn't matter, and there's no recourse, there's no legal rights. So your sister gets sold, your daughter, your son
[time=2764] gets sold. Would you go buy, would you go buy a bigger house? Would you go buy another car?
[time=2775] Would you buy some new clothes? If you knew that with that same money you could redeem
[time=2782] your son, you could redeem your daughter, you could buy the person back and grant them freedom.
[time=2792] I don't think you would. I mean if you really got a little mental picture of your precious
[time=2800] sweet daughter standing up on that and she gets sold and she runs off and she has to do whatever and be done to whatever all of her life. You're not going to work tomorrow to buy another house and you're not going to work to get a better car, you're going to work every single day of your life to find enough finally the money to buy her back. See that's what happens to the unbeliever,
[time=2824] that's how we're born. We're born slaves to sin, we're born slaves in the marketplace of sin in this beautiful word redemption in verse 24 is that same heart of God where he looks and he sees you and
[time=2835] his own son comes and says I will pay the price to buy them back. First Timothy 2-6 says that he
[time=2843] gave himself a ransom for all, kidnapped as it were and he says what's the fee? What's the ransom
[time=2852] to get this child back all your life? First Peter 1-18 knowing that you were not deemed with
[time=2858] perishable things like silver or gold. See the point is when you get sold in the marketplace of sin you can't get bought with stuff like silver and gold. That currency doesn't work there. What works?
[time=2868] What currency works in the marketplace of sin? Well the verse says but with the precious blood of a lamb unblemished and spotless the blood of Christ. There's only one commodity that could buy
[time=2879] you and me and anybody else out of the marketplace of sin and it's none other than the blood of Jesus Christ and because of that same feeling you have in your heart of love and commitment to
[time=2890] abhorring even the mental picture of one of your children being sold in the slavery so Christ couldn't stand the thought that that would happen to you so he gave his life. It's powerful stuff.
[time=2902] Number three here and this is so exciting. God satisfies his own wrath.
[time=2911] God satisfies his own wrath. The only way that you and I can have a but now experience
[time=2917] where life was this way but now it's this way is if the very wrath of God gets resolved.
[time=2924] You see it's this way. God was mad at me. God was furious with me. He was outraged against me
[time=2934] for my hard heart and my rebellion and my sinful behavior. That's how God used to feel about me
[time=2940] but now I have peace with God. But now I have peace with God and that is the word propitiation.
[time=2948] $25 we're looking at verse 25 when God or rather whom God displayed publicly as a here it is
[time=2956] propitiation in his blood through faith. You could say propitiation is translated satisfied.
[time=2965] God satisfied himself in the death and the penalty he brought upon his son
[time=2972] the wrath that he would have given to you. He is satisfied. You see you got to ask the question what happened to all that anger and wrath and judgment. Remember we studied that in Romans 1
[time=2984] verse 18 we looked a little bit about that word wrath and it meant heated burning fury of bitterness
[time=2990] against the sinner full of venom and poison pictured as God foaming at the mouth. Where did that God
[time=2997] go? What happened to that God? What happened to that burning heated fury full of bitterness and
[time=3005] venom and poison of God foaming at his mouth bringing wrath upon the ungodly sinner who rejects
[time=3011] him and his son. Where did that God go? Have you ever been in a fight? Maybe not a fist fight but like an angry fight with somebody you love. Have you ever noticed that whatever those issues
[time=3022] are that produce that become secondary and the major problem is now you're angry at that other
[time=3029] person. I mean there's some serious intense emotion going on inside of you about that other person and okay you're on your way back to restoration and you talk through the issues and people admit what they did and they say they're sorry and oftentimes that's resolved. What is it resolved
[time=3045] is and actually I heard what you said but I'm still really mad at you for the way you treated me, the way you hurt me, the way you made me feel. That's what he's talking about. See God has that too.
[time=3055] Oh yeah we could get things resolved and become righteousness of God. We could get things resolved
[time=3062] to be redeemed out of the marketplace to sin but what happened to the heated burning fury of bitterness and venom and poison that pictured God foaming at the mouth angry at sin in the sinner who did it. Well that all gets taken care of. See he doesn't feel that way anymore.
[time=3078] That's why it's a button-on experience. Whereas you were in the crosshairs of his wrath destined
[time=3085] to be resurrected after your death fit with bodies for eternal damnation and destruction which then would be persecuted and tortured for all of eternity with no remission and appropriate
[time=3095] expression of his wrath towards you. That's all gone now. He didn't feel it anymore. He doesn't
[time=3102] feel why because that's been satisfied. That's been satisfied. You say how did he get satisfied?
[time=3107] Surely our griefs Christ himself bore and our sorrows he carried. We saw him stricken and smitten
[time=3118] of God and afflicted. Christ was pierced through for our transgressions. Christ was crushed for our
[time=3124] iniquities. The chastening of our well being fell upon Christ and Christ's scorching healed us.
[time=3131] In other words all that wrath and all that venom and all that poison and all that bitterness
[time=3137] went crashing down on the person of Jesus Christ on the cross and the stuff that we were supposed to bear he bore and so God is fully satisfied. Everything is completely resolved now
[time=3149] and his emotions towards thus will forever be only love and peace and harmony.
[time=3155] All that stuff is now gone forever because Christ bore it.
[time=3159] If Christ doesn't bear that there is no but now with you and God it's just but.
[time=3167] Uh oh. He's still mad. He's still full of wrath. He's still angry. I'm still in really big trouble.
[time=3179] So what an amazing thing. What a great text. We go from blinded spiritually crippled morally
[time=3190] crooked under the weight of our own guilt in Romans one two and the first part of three
[time=3197] and suddenly there's a there's like boom in the midst of the darkness comes this great light
[time=3205] called but now and the God says I'm going to give you my righteousness through my son
[time=3212] and I'm going to redeem you from the marketplace of sin through my son and I'm going to satisfy
[time=3220] the wrath that I have against sin by pouring it out of my son so that we can be at peace together
[time=3229] forever. I want to close this morning with a little picture a little picture that I love
[time=3236] about this look at in your Bible there look at verse 26 there's so much more that could be said about this but verse 26 says for the demonstration I say of his righteousness at the present time
[time=3247] now here it is that God might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Christ.
[time=3257] You see God by doing it this way is both just and the justifier.
[time=3265] He has upheld the law. He has upheld righteousness. He has he has
[time=3273] meted out justice for the sins of humanity. He has been just but he has found a way to do it
[time=3282] that makes him the justifier in other words he makes us righteous in the process so that we aren't destroyed for all of eternity. He has been both a righteous judge and a gracious judge at the
[time=3293] same time. I love the story of an Indian chief. I may have shared it with you before but
[time=3301] just every time I see this passage every time I see these words just down the justifier the Indian chief comes to my mind he's the way the story goes he's a young man in his 40s and he's
[time=3312] just doing his best he knows he's young for his age he knows that everybody's looking at him he knows that the whole kind of future of the tribe depends upon his ability to be both a just
[time=3322] chief and make honest decisions that people can respect and follow at the same time he doesn't
[time=3328] want to get caught up in that and rule is such an iron fist that he breaks the will of the people destroys their unity and so he's all you know trying to do his very best to give these kinds of things and one day they bring a woman they bring a woman in front of him for judgment who has
[time=3343] stolen from her neighbor she's stolen from her neighbor and in that particular tribe justice would mean that she received 40 lashes tied to a pole and then
[time=3356] whipped 40 times there are two problems number one the woman is very old and frail and thin
[time=3364] her ribs are showing then he knows that if he gives her justice she'll die
[time=3371] the second problem is she happens to be his mother
[time=3377] and he loves her and there he finds himself caught on the horns of a dilemma
[time=3387] he knows that justice must be given he knows that justice must be meted out he knows the law must
[time=3393] be fulfilled but he looks at this peer treasured mother and he says if I give you justice you're
[time=3399] gonna die and so he says with tears in his eyes strapper to the pole and so the whipped guy comes
[time=3409] and hesitantly takes her over to the pole and ties her up there and rips the stuff off and there you can see the bony rib cage exposed and just as the guy's gonna begin this justice thing the
[time=3422] chief says wait and he takes off his his indian chief thing and sets it down there and he goes
[time=3428] down there and he wraps his arms around his mother and he says okay you can start and he takes all
[time=3437] the 40 lashes and he's at that moment isn't he is at that very moment both just and the justifier
[time=3448] and that's what you see in this passage you see the only possible way for god both to be just
[time=3456] at the same time the justifier our gracious god and heavenly father you are the great
[time=3465] and awesome and mighty one we have come to worship today and in our singing and in the preaching of
[time=3471] your word we would realign ourselves underneath you we would resubmit we would resign up we would
[time=3478] recommit for you or god that is worthy of our lives both now and forever more we love you and
[time=3486] praise you and pray these things in christ name and all god's people said amen god bless you
