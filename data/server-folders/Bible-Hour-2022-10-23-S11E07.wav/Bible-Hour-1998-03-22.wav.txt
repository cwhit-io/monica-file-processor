[time=85] This morning, it's about your relationship with the one that you sit next to, the one that you sit behind, the one that you sit in front of.
[time=92] This morning, this is about us taking a look at what God's word says our relationships are to look like.
[time=99] [MUSIC]
[time=107] This is the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=111] Thank you for joining us.
[time=112] Today, Pastor Kelly Bird looks at what first Peter says about right relations in the body of Christ.
[time=118] We hope you'll stay tuned.
[time=119] Now let's join our service.
[time=121] [MUSIC - 70 seconds]
[time=219] I'm so glad I've learned to trust him.
[time=226] Precious Jesus, say your prayer.
[time=233] And I know that he is with me.
[time=240] But we'll be with me to the end.
[time=247] Jesus, Jesus, I trust him.
[time=254] I burn him more and more.
[time=261] Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus.
[time=268] We hope for praise to trust him.
[time=280] Jesus, we hope.
[time=289] [MUSIC]
[time=304] [APPLAUSE]
[time=309] Listen to the words in Isaiah.
[time=312] It says this, "To whom then will we liken God?
[time=316] Or what likeness will you compare with him?
[time=319] As for the idol, a craftsman casts it.
[time=321] A goldsmith plates it with gold, and a silversmith fashions chains of silver.
[time=326] He who is too impoverished for such an offering selects a tree that does not rot.
[time=331] He seeks out for himself a skillful craftsman to prepare an idol that will not totter.
[time=337] Do you not know?
[time=338] Have you not heard?
[time=339] Has it not been declared to you from the beginning?
[time=341] And have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?
[time=345] It is he who sits above the vault of the earth, and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers.
[time=350] It is he who stretches out the heavens like a curtain and spreads them out like a tent to dwell in.
[time=358] It is he, the one and only God, true and living God.
[time=363] Think about it in your own life.
[time=365] Who is there like him?
[time=367] Who is there, who is there that reaches into your life and teaches you like he does,
[time=373] and mold you and shapes you like he does, and faithfully stays with you like he does.
[time=378] Who is there?
[time=381] Nobody.
[time=383] Let's pray.
[time=384] Father, we're reminded this morning of what a great and powerful God you are.
[time=388] This passage in Isaiah speaks of your awesome greatness, and yet we know of the personal touch as well that you bring to our lives on a daily basis.
[time=397] And Lord, we're thankful for it this morning.
[time=399] We're thankful that you are who you are, thankful that there is none like you, and thankful for the opportunity to lift that praise up to you this morning.
[time=408] God, we pray that as we continue to worship you here right now, that you would hear and see that our hearts are full of gratitude.
[time=416] Thank you for being who you are.
[time=418] There is none like you, and all God's people said.
[time=429] [MUSIC]
[time=439] [MUSIC] I lift thy voices leading to the Lord [MUSIC] I judge thee into meaning song [MUSIC] Heaven, hope and believe [MUSIC] That's all you gave to me [MUSIC] Oh, I don't have to see [MUSIC] Your power and glory [MUSIC]
[time=471] [MUSIC - 23 seconds]
[time=500] [MUSIC] Lord, all we build [MUSIC] My very be gone [MUSIC] Heaven and the deep winds are grey [MUSIC] And so I bless you, baby [MUSIC] The worship is mine [MUSIC] I suffer by the way [MUSIC] In my heart you shall reign [MUSIC] Lord, I sing your mighty praise [MUSIC] Lord, for your spiritual grace [MUSIC] I come before you singing [MUSIC] With singing [MUSIC] Hey, sir, if I want to die [MUSIC] Lord, Jesus must respond [MUSIC] I hear the every music [MUSIC] With music I command [MUSIC] Lord, I sing your mighty praise [MUSIC] Your Lord, your spiritual grace [MUSIC] I come before you singing [MUSIC] With singing [MUSIC] The praise you will want to die [MUSIC] Lord, Jesus must respond [MUSIC] I will hear the every music [MUSIC] With music I command [MUSIC] Praise, praise, praise [MUSIC] Praise, praise, praise â™ª
[time=609] (audience applauds) - Thanks, Scott, and music folks.
[time=616] What a great time of worship, huh?
[time=618] Good way to start the morning.
[time=620] Well, let me invite you, if you would, to open your Bibles to first Peter chapter three.
[time=624] First Peter chapter three, we're gonna take a break.
[time=627] This morning, in our ongoing study of the book of Romans, Russell is away for the weekend.
[time=632] He and Heidi got a chance just to slip away and I think actually get some rest, which, you know, he needs these days to him turning 39 and everything.
[time=640] (audience laughs) So you might want to tell him when you see him next time, that you'd hope he's rested up and feeling good, but we were glad for them to be able to get some time together, just the two of them away for a couple days.
[time=651] And so in his absence, we're gonna just jump into this great passage here in first Peter chapter three, verses eight to 12, that talks about right relationships, healthy relationships in the body of Christ.
[time=664] This morning, it's about you and me.
[time=666] This morning, it's about your relationship with the one that you sit next to, the one that you sit behind, the one that you sit in front of.
[time=673] This morning, this is about us taking a look at what God's word says our relationships are to look like.
[time=679] And I hope that you would agree.
[time=681] I think that you would, that if this church and if our mission and what we believe God's doing here is ever gonna come to fruition and we believe it is, that's gonna be, to a large part, obviously due to him and his work.
[time=693] But also, as you know, he uses people.
[time=696] He uses his body to accomplish his work, and he can't use a divided body.
[time=702] He can't use a body that isn't living together in right relationship together.
[time=707] And so this morning, we look as just an encouragement to you and hopefully an encouragement to me.
[time=712] We look at this passage and say, God, what do you have for us?
[time=715] We want to be a people that live in right relationship.
[time=719] When I was in seminary, I think it was my first year, maybe my second year of seminary, I was younger.
[time=728] And I hadn't learned some things yet in my life.
[time=731] And I remember being 23, 24 years old.
[time=734] And there was, in my mind, I think, though my motivation was right, I didn't know any better in a sense.
[time=740] There wasn't my mind this idea that I wanted to be a godly man, a godly young man.
[time=746] We used that term a lot back then.
[time=748] You want it to be, you were supposed to be, it was important to be godly.
[time=752] And so I worked hard at being godly the best way and the only way I knew how to be godly.
[time=758] And as a seminary student, it wasn't hard.
[time=760] It was all right there in front of me.
[time=762] I was growing leaps and bounds in my understandings of the texts.
[time=766] I was growing in enormous ways in my understanding and in my ability to debate eschatology.
[time=772] I was growing and increasing in knowledge in my ability to understand and communicate church history.
[time=778] I mean, I was giving everything I had to this pursuit of being a godly man and godliness in my mind at that point meant that you knew as much as you could.
[time=786] And you could debate as much as you could and you could convince.
[time=790] And all of that seemed to be wrapped around what is really, really good stuff, the word of God.
[time=794] But in my mind, that's what it was to be godly.
[time=798] A wonderful man and a dear friend.
[time=800] And you've heard Russell refer to him before.
[time=802] Dr. Chuck Smith, the late Dr. Charles Smith, used to be the dean over here at Grace Seminary in Warsaw, went on a lake and then went out to the master's seminary and served in that same position there at the master's seminary.
[time=815] And he was an insightful, very knowledgeable, but very insightful man who had taken an interest in me and he sat me down one day at lunch.
[time=824] And he sat me down one day at lunch because of this, because although I was growing in my understanding and increasing in my knowledge of biblical truth, he also knew at the same time because of some mutual friends that my wife of about 18 months was getting ready to leave me.
[time=841] Yeah, she was getting ready to leave because what was going on in my home, I mean, forget what was going on in the classroom, what was going on in my home was pathetic.
[time=852] There was no love, there was no pursuit, there was no relationship.
[time=856] And he knew that.
[time=858] And he sat me down one day and he said to me this, and he didn't say it tongue in cheek and he wasn't trying to be sarcastic, but in essence he said this, Kelly, don't ever forget, you're only as godly as your worst relationship.
[time=871] You're only as godly as your worst relationship.
[time=876] And he began at that point to teach me and to further his investment in me and in so doing my understanding that godliness, yes, has a lot to do with what we know and what we understand and what we can communicate, but it has a lot to do as well with what we do with that truth in the context of the people that we live life with.
[time=896] You with me?
[time=898] And he helped me begin to see that day that I could know a great deal of truth, but unless that truth is lived out in the context of loving, sacrificial, giving relationships, it's all for now.
[time=912] And, you know, I think this morning the same could be said of the church.
[time=916] I think this morning it might be good for us as a body to maybe say the same thing to remind ourselves in the same way we're only as godly.
[time=928] This church will only be as effective.
[time=931] This church is only as godly if we can say it that way as its worst relationship.
[time=939] And I know as I even say those words, I mean, something inside me resonates with that because I believe it to be very, very true.
[time=946] I believe what I said earlier is true.
[time=949] That our effectiveness as a church and our progress as a body in this kingdom and devour that we're a part of can be greatly, greatly diminished and greatly hampered when your relationship in mind isn't what it needs to be.
[time=963] When your relationship with that person sitting across the room for me this morning isn't what it needs to be.
[time=970] Peter proclaims this very truth right here in our passage this morning, and he's been talking about it all through the book up to this point.
[time=977] And let me just tell you, let me remind you this that in chapter 2 verse 12 he emphasized living in right relationship with the Gentiles.
[time=986] In chapter 2 verse 13 he talked about living in right relationship with the government.
[time=996] The employer-employee relationship.
[time=998] In chapter 3 verses 1 to 7 he talked about living in right relationships as husbands and wives with your spouse.
[time=1005] And now he comes here to 1 Peter 3, 8 to 12, and let's look and see what it says there.
[time=1010] He says to sum up, because again he's been talking about this idea of relationship.
[time=1014] He says to sum up, let all be harmonious, sympathetic,
[time=1020] brotherly, kindhearted, and humble in spirit.
[time=1023] Not returning evil for evil or insult for insult, but giving a blessing instead.
[time=1029] For you were called for the very purpose that you might inherit a blessing for.
[time=1033] Let him who means to love life and see good days refrain his tongue from evil and do good.
[time=1040] And his lips from speaking guile and let him turn away from evil and do good.
[time=1044] Let him seek peace and pursue it.
[time=1047] For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous and his ears attend to their prayer.
[time=1052] But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil, against those who do evil.
[time=1058] So here we have it, a picture, a really clear picture I think, a great picture of right healthy relationships
[time=1065] within the church itself and the passage kind of breaks down like this.
[time=1068] Verse 8 talks about what these healthy relationships should look like.
[time=1073] And again as you saw there in verses 9, 10, 11, and 12, it's going to give us a picture of what they shouldn't look like.
[time=1079] All right?
[time=1080] Right relationships with a fellow believer.
[time=1082] Now I want you to do this.
[time=1083] I want you to in an attempt to try and make this for you and for myself as practical as possible.
[time=1088] All right?
[time=1089] I don't want this to be an exercise in theory.
[time=1091] I want it to be something that as we think about it and as we look at the Scriptures and as we mull this over in our own hearts and as the Spirit of God does this thing.
[time=1098] I want you to have if you would two people in mind today, two people.
[time=1105] I mean this is about relationships in the body of Christ.
[time=1108] This is about you and me.
[time=1110] This is about us.
[time=1112] And I know that there are in this body.
[time=1116] I know that there are in your life probably more than two, but let's just pick two.
[time=1120] Let's you and I be willing in our hearts today to pick two relationships that we have in this church.
[time=1125] And maybe we could go as far as to even just quietly, again privately in our own heart,
[time=1131] pick two that maybe at times represent for you a real challenge.
[time=1135] You know we've got those relationships in our lives.
[time=1138] We're that person for some people.
[time=1140] You know what I mean?
[time=1142] There's sometimes where you know it's not all rosy.
[time=1144] It's not all smooth.
[time=1145] It's not real easy.
[time=1146] But we're here and we're together.
[time=1149] And this passage calls us to live life together, to be a part of this body and then the words that he uses here in verse 8 that we'll look at would indicate that our relationships are to be strong.
[time=1160] So would you be willing today to all the way through this time together today, all the way through this message?
[time=1165] Would you have two people in mind?
[time=1169] That you know in your heart things probably could be better with them.
[time=1174] As far as it depends upon you, things could probably be healthier.
[time=1178] And with those two faces kind of etched at the forefront of your mind and heart today, would you be willing to allow the Spirit of God to move you and convict you and bring you along in that process?
[time=1189] Would you do that?
[time=1190] And would you, at the same time, note in verse 8 as we jump into this, would you just so that we're all on the same page?
[time=1196] This says in verse 8 to sum up, let, and then what your Bible say?
[time=1201] Huh?
[time=1202] To sum up, let all, everybody, this message is for all of us.
[time=1211] For every one of us that are a part of this body, this message applies to us.
[time=1216] And the things that we're about to see, the things that we're about to look at are worthy of everyone's consideration, all right?
[time=1224] So let's start out.
[time=1225] First part of the passage, healthy relationships within the body of Christ.
[time=1229] We're going to see five, we're going to see five marks, five marks of a right relationship with a fellow believer.
[time=1236] Number one, it says in verse 8, let all be harmonious.
[time=1241] It says let all be harmonious, write that down, harmonious.
[time=1245] And let's look at that word carefully, all right?
[time=1248] It says in the original language, that word harmonious means simply this.
[time=1253] It says it's a like-mindedness.
[time=1256] We are to possess and share together a like-mindedness with respect to fundamental
[time=1262] truths and an inward attitude of unity that leaves division unthinkable.
[time=1270] That leaves division unthinkable.
[time=1273] Did you catch that?
[time=1275] A like-mindedness with respect to fundamental truths, there should be, and I believe there are, fundamental biblical truths that would bind us together.
[time=1283] Things that we won't compromise on, things that we die for, things that we believe in, things that this book teaches us.
[time=1290] And we are bound, it says, by a harmonious like-minded commitment to those truths.
[time=1296] And if that word's going to be lived out now, it's that commitment to those fundamental truths that we share that would then lead us in our relationships together to have something like division be almost unthinkable, unthinkable.
[time=1314] Harmonious living, that's what it's talking about.
[time=1316] That's what the word says.
[time=1319] Flip back to Romans, chapter 12, just for a second.
[time=1322] Romans, chapter 12, verse 16.
[time=1328] What does Paul say here about this idea of harmonious living?
[time=1332] Romans, chapter 12, verse 16.
[time=1338] It says this right there, verse 16, Romans 12.
[time=1341] It says, "Be of the same mind," same word there.
[time=1345] Be of the same mind toward one another.
[time=1347] Do not be haughty.
[time=1349] What would keep us from this kind of relationship?
[time=1352] What would keep us from living together in relationship with each other harmoniously?
[time=1358] Right here, he says, "Do not be haughty in mind, but associate with the lowly.
[time=1363] Do not be wise in your own estimation.
[time=1366] Never pay back evil for evil to anyone.
[time=1369] Respect what is right in the sight of all men." If possible, verse 18, great verse, "If possible so far as it depends on you, be at peace with all men." Never take your own revenge, beloved, but leave room for the wrath of God.
[time=1384] For it has written vengeance his mind, "I will repay," says the Lord.
[time=1389] But if your enemy is hungry, feed him.
[time=1391] And if he is thirsty, give him a drink.
[time=1394] For in so doing you will keep burning coals upon his head.
[time=1397] Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
[time=1402] Great passage, great picture of what it means and what it looks like to live harmoniously.
[time=1411] Skip over a few pages.
[time=1413] He gets back to this theme in chapter 15.
[time=1416] Romans 15, go to verse 5.
[time=1420] Romans 15 verses 5 to 7.
[time=1424] Same word is used again, that harmonious word in the Greek.
[time=1428] Same word is used here.
[time=1430] Romans 15 verse 5 says, "This now may the God, who gives perseverance and encouragement, grant you to be of the same mind with one another according to Christ Jesus.
[time=1440] That with one accord you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1446] Wherefore, accept one another, just as Christ also accepted us to the glory of God."
[time=1455] That's a great truth.
[time=1457] And it's a great truth that again and again and again, in your memory and mind, in history,
[time=1463] past and in what's going to happen in the future, sadly, but true.
[time=1467] It's a truth that has been violated again and again and again.
[time=1472] I keep a listing, I got a file in my office.
[time=1477] And when I come across, and it's sad, it's a tragic file to have to keep, but I keep it.
[time=1483] Just for my own memory and for my own, the work that God's doing in my own heart with regard to this issue,
[time=1491] I keep a list of things that I read.
[time=1494] I get periodicals, I get journals, I get magazines.
[time=1496] And I hear about churches splitting.
[time=1500] You read about it and you hear about it.
[time=1502] Churches that divide.
[time=1505] And churches whose doors get closed down because the people within those doors, the people within those walls couldn't live together.
[time=1513] You hear about it all the time.
[time=1515] I've kept a list of things in the last ten years that I've read, things that have caused that kind of tragic dilemma,
[time=1523] that kind of tragic division.
[time=1526] Church splits, reasons for church splits, kind of my own top ten, if you will.
[time=1532] Church in Florida, six years ago, split over the carpet color in the auditorium.
[time=1538] Serious, color of carpet in the auditorium.
[time=1542] Church in Texas, several years ago, split over the presence of acoustical instruments being present in the worship center.
[time=1552] Another church in Oregon split when a dog was allowed to live indoors at the Parsonage.
[time=1558] A lot of churches have homes for the pastor, and this pastor had a dog, and that church split because that pastor let his dog inside the house.
[time=1567] Some churches split over the kinds of songs that get sung or don't get sung.
[time=1572] Some churches split over the link.
[time=1574] Church in Connecticut split because the link, typically, of the pastor's prayer on Sunday was again and again and again much, much too long.
[time=1582] Church split.
[time=1584] Some churches have split over the dislike of the church's letterhead.
[time=1589] Change the letterhead, or I'm leaving.
[time=1595] Came across several months ago, a church that split because of the name of the church that was out on the sign.
[time=1601] Some folks were going to adjust that church split.
[time=1604] Some churches split because there was one church in Minnesota that split because the elders wanted their names in the bulletin each week along with the pastors.
[time=1612] Church split.
[time=1616] Meantime, right, people, real people, real families, moms and dads, kids, brothers, sisters.
[time=1626] Meantime, real people are living in a hopeless, messed up world, dying and going to hell.
[time=1633] And we're arguing about the color of carpet in auditoriums, the kind of songs that do or don't get sung, names in a bulletin, living in factions with each other.
[time=1645] Nipping at each other, fighting with each other.
[time=1648] And meantime, there's people right outside those doors.
[time=1653] And I say those doors, I don't mean because this church does those things.
[time=1656] I mean, right outside the doors of thousands of churches in this country, and there's people right outside those doors that desperately need hope, that desperately need help, that desperately need to be pursued.
[time=1667] And the church fights, and the church wrestles, and the church bickers about these kinds of things.
[time=1673] Remember the word again, in the Greek, an inward attitude of unity that leaves division unthinkable.
[time=1681] Absolutely unthinkable.
[time=1685] Now, if I can, let me ask you some questions again now.
[time=1688] And this would be an attempt to try and bring this back home, back to your own heart, back to my own life, and to give us an opportunity to take this word and this truth and apply it to your life in mind.
[time=1701] Can I ask you some questions, and can you commit to answer them honestly?
[time=1706] Just before God, just between you and Him in your own heart, have you said something lately?
[time=1712] Have you?
[time=1714] Have you said anything lately, done anything, even harbored an attitude that was in any way divisive?
[time=1723] In any way unkind, in any way potentially, factious?
[time=1730] Have you said anything?
[time=1734] Maybe 50 people didn't hear it, maybe just one heard it, maybe 50 did.
[time=1739] You think about that this morning, anything, said anything, done anything, harbored an attitude.
[time=1745] Is there someone, here you go, another one for you, is there someone, anyone in this family today who you are at odds with?
[time=1752] Today.
[time=1755] Anybody?
[time=1756] Anybody in this family today with whom you are irritated, someone that you're avoiding, because things between you aren't right.
[time=1764] Things between you aren't harmonious.
[time=1768] And today they continue to be that way, whether it's your fault or theirs.
[time=1775] Another question for you, have you gossiped about someone recently?
[time=1780] Have you gossiped about someone recently?
[time=1782] Have you said something demeaning or critical about someone to another individual or group of people?
[time=1788] Anything?
[time=1791] Now, here you go, if the answer, if the answer to any of the above questions is true in your life or mine, if the answer is yes to any of the above, then I believe this morning before God in the privacy of your own heart and mind, we need to do three things.
[time=1808] Three things, really basic.
[time=1811] But in light of this text and in light of its truth and in light of what the church needs to be, relationally, you and I would need to do three things.
[time=1819] We would need to stop.
[time=1821] Stop that.
[time=1823] We would need to make a conscious choice in our hearts before God this morning to stop and to seek repentance.
[time=1829] And repentance, I believe, would look like this.
[time=1831] Number one, you stop doing it.
[time=1838] And number two, you ask for forgiveness from God for the sin that you've committed by harboring that attitude by saying that thing by feeling that way and harboring that feeling against that person.
[time=1844] You seek forgiveness from God for the sin and the potential danger that that sin created with respect to unity and harmony.
[time=1853] And then three, you go to that person.
[time=1856] And you say, you know what? I said something. You know what? I've been thinking something.
[time=1861] You know what? This thing that happened between us, we've got to get it right.
[time=1865] It's that important. This place and these people and this body, it means that much to me.
[time=1871] You need to do that. You need to go to that person and make it right.
[time=1876] You need to stop. You need to ask forgiveness from God.
[time=1878] And you need to go to that person and seek forgiveness from them and do your best to restore the relationship.
[time=1884] And don't forget this, before we move on from harmonious, please don't forget this.
[time=1888] And I believe it's as true as anything.
[time=1891] Please remember that if there's one place, you know, the Bible talks about the prince of the power of the air.
[time=1897] The Bible talks about Satan and how committed he is to ruining this thing that God's doing in the church.
[time=1904] And can you think of a place that you have seen him strike more often than this arena
[time=1913] of relationships within the body?
[time=1915] I mean, all those things I read to you, the list of church splits and all that stuff.
[time=1919] You got to know he was back there. He was applauding. He was happy. He was thankful.
[time=1923] He was glad that people had turned on each other.
[time=1927] He was thankful that that church's reputation and that church's ministry had been diminished.
[time=1932] And he would love to see this church's relationship.
[time=1935] He would love to see this church's ministry diminished and depleted because we can't live together in harmony.
[time=1942] And so when you sit there and you say to yourself, "Well, yeah, I had to answer yes to a few of those questions
[time=1948] Kelly asked, but I'll get to it later." Don't forget that even that right there can be a foothold for him to come in and begin to do incredible things
[time=1957] against what God's doing here with us, with the people of the city, with the people in this church.
[time=1963] Don't let it go. Don't forget it.
[time=1966] Harmony, an inward attitude of unity. The passage goes on. Back to 1 Peter 3.
[time=1976] It says, "So to sum up, let all be harmonious." And the second thing he comes to is the word sympathetic, sympathetic.
[time=1984] The word in the Greek is really two words, all right? Two words brought together.
[time=1988] And the first one means this. It means to be affected.
[time=1992] The word means to be affected, to have feelings stirred up within by another's circumstance.
[time=2000] To have feelings stirred up within due to the circumstance of another, to be affected.
[time=2007] And the second word that makes up the total of that word is another Greek word that simply means with, with.
[time=2015] So in other words, the word means when Peter says here that we're to be sympathetic with each other.
[time=2020] It means that we are to be affected along with another, sharing in the feelings and emotions that have been stirred in that individual.
[time=2028] From the linguistic key to the Greek New Testament written by Fritz Reineker and Ken Rogers, it says this.
[time=2034] The word denotes a readiness. Are you?
[time=2039] The word denotes a readiness and a desire to enter into and share the feelings of another,
[time=2045] to unite with them in their sorrow, confusion, grief or their joy can be either way.
[time=2051] A readiness and a desire to enter into and share the feelings of another.
[time=2057] Now, I see this in my own life. I see it in my life as a husband. I see it in my life as a father.
[time=2064] I see it in men's lives as husbands as I watch them and myself trying to learn and grow in our understanding of what it means to love a wife.
[time=2073] I see this in women's lives. It's not just a man thing, I don't think.
[time=2078] I see it in men's lives. I see it in women's lives. I see it as ladies grow in their ability to relate with their friends.
[time=2085] I see it across the board. I see this and when I say I see it, what I'm referring to is this.
[time=2093] Whether it's me with my wife or my wife with our kids or a friend, either way, there is in all of us.
[time=2100] I think I see this. It's almost like a panic sometimes.
[time=2106] That when difficulty, when pain, when discouragement or when confusion rears its head in the life of someone we're dealing with,
[time=2114] we move at lightning speed sometimes to clear it up.
[time=2119] We move at lightning speed to say whatever needs to be said to offer advice, whatever advice needs to be given,
[time=2125] but we move at lightning speed to get it cleared up because we don't like the presence of the pain.
[time=2131] We don't like the presence of that struggle. It makes us uncomfortable.
[time=2136] We don't like it and so we move and we offer advice and we say things and we teach and we prod and we bump them.
[time=2141] We want to get rid of whatever that is. I see it in men and I see it in women.
[time=2146] Now ask yourself, please, and write this down if you would, ask yourself this question today.
[time=2151] Why? And that may not be you. You may have grown through that and if you have, it's wonderful.
[time=2156] A lot of us struggle with that though. We get uncomfortable when things get really messy and we want quickly to get it cleared up.
[time=2165] Why? Ask yourself this and write down an answer if you would.
[time=2169] Why are we so quick to define sympathy as the gentle and insightful provision of an answer?
[time=2178] Why do we make that correlation and why do so many of us do it so often?
[time=2184] We kind of take sympathy, okay, now being here for this person, we kind of take that with providing them with an answer to get out of their dilemma.
[time=2194] Why so many times is fixing the individual, getting rid of the difficulty, so important that it moves us away from what seems to be biblical sympathizing.
[time=2206] And here's another question for us. Why are we so sure that God wants their difficulty gone?
[time=2213] Why are we so convinced in those situations so many times that what God wants for them is to be out from under that?
[time=2220] Why are we so convinced of that?
[time=2225] Well, I hope you've written a couple things down. I'd love for you to answer that question from your own mind and your own perspective.
[time=2232] Let me run through just three things that came to my mind, all right?
[time=2236] Three things, the question is why is biblical sympathy so hard?
[time=2241] Why is biblical sympathy as we've just defined it?
[time=2244] A willingness to be affected by, a willingness to enter into and share the feelings that have been stirred in another.
[time=2252] Why is that so difficult sometimes? Well, number one, I would suggest this, we're prideful.
[time=2258] I'm prideful. When my wife's fallen apart and things are going wrong and she's really hurting and things have gone absolutely nuts,
[time=2265] and I see and I sense her hurt and her pain, there can be a really sinful thing that goes on there with me.
[time=2274] I can become so prideful that all I really see there is an opportunity to do what?
[time=2280] To make a difference. I'm going to make a difference here. I'm going to make an impact.
[time=2285] And part of that can be okay, but there's a real part of that that times when you face it and I face it where it's prideful,
[time=2292] where we're so quick to offer answers and we're so quick to want to get rid of that because we want to be able to look at that and see what we've done.
[time=2300] And for the other person to realize what we've done and how we've helped and how we've fixed it and how it was a good thing they came to us.
[time=2308] Why is biblical sympathy so hard? Because we're prideful and want to make a difference.
[time=2313] We're more committed to making a difference at times than we are to opening, simply opening our hearts to the individual and listening and hearing about what's happening in their heart and in their life.
[time=2326] We're prideful. Number two, I think biblical sympathy is hard sometimes because we're lazy.
[time=2331] We're emotionally lazy and that refers to what I was just kind of talking about.
[time=2337] We're a verse, at least I can speak for myself, so many times I find myself a verse too and wanting to stay away.
[time=2344] I don't like the presence of things that I can't handle.
[time=2347] I don't like the presence of things in my life, in the life of another that I'm with when things are going on that are ugly,
[time=2354] when things are going on that I don't understand, when things are happening that I can't get my arms around.
[time=2361] And biblical sympathy calls me to stay there anyway so many times I resist that.
[time=2369] And I offer my answers anyway and I offer my path of direction anyway because I want to do anything I can to get rid of this confusing messy thing that's hard for me as well.
[time=2381] And so boom, off I go with my little speech, my little sermon, my little whatever.
[time=2390] Third reason why I think sometimes biblical sympathy is so hard is because we have bought into the lie.
[time=2396] We have bought into the dangerous not to mention a heretical line of thinking that associates struggle and discouragement with spiritual weakness or spiritual immaturity.
[time=2410] Have you ever had that happen to you? Have you ever seen that take place?
[time=2413] Ever witnessed that go on? Somebody who's really hurting, somebody who's really discouraged?
[time=2418] And you almost get the sense as you listen to those who are trying to help them that they better get that stuff dealt with.
[time=2426] Quick because the more they struggle and the more they hurt somehow that would equate to the more spiritual immature they are.
[time=2433] And that's just not true, it's just not right and it's a dangerous way of thinking that many of us buy into it times.
[time=2440] Because again we're so averse to it and we want to see it all cleaned up that we even begin to associate spiritual maturity with the absence of struggle in our life.
[time=2450] And that's just simply not what the Bible says, it's not what it teaches. Jesus again and again told us, Paul again and again told us that we would suffer, that we would bump into things that were difficult, that trials would be a part of our life.
[time=2468] And never do we see the struggling with the trial being associated with the level of or lack thereof of spiritual maturity.
[time=2479] We resist in our lives this call the biblical sympathy, really allowing our feelings to be stirred.
[time=2488] Because so many times our pride gets in the way, so many times our emotional laziness gets in the way and so many times this heretical unhealthy line of thinking gets in the way.
[time=2498] This word calls us right here people, you and your relationships me and mine to be willing to take the time to be affected by and stirred by the feelings and emotions of another, whatever they might be.
[time=2511] And I think there's a place for you and I to come in and offer direction and hope.
[time=2515] I think there's a place for that to happen but so many times in your life and mine I think it happens much too quickly.
[time=2524] Back to verse 8, he says to sum up let all be harmonious, sympathetic and now he moves to this word brotherly, brotherly.
[time=2532] And it's a basic word we won't spend a lot of time on it this morning but the basic gist of the word is this.
[time=2538] Brotherly in the Greek is a basic word that carries with it a strong and powerful picture.
[time=2543] It means literally a deep and ongoing, a deep and abiding commitment that goes beyond the circumstantial, that goes beyond the circumstantial.
[time=2556] There's a brotherly love where I'm going to be willing and you're going to be willing to do what it takes, go where you have to go, say what you have to say, go to whatever links you might have to go to to be there for you.
[time=2569] It's a deep and ongoing abiding love, a brotherly love.
[time=2573] I've seen this lately evidenced again and again as I've watched sometimes with laughter and sometimes with amazement.
[time=2582] My son, a little Russell T and now he's got a sister who's kind of moving up an age and she's getting mobile and she wants to hang with big brother and she wants to go where he goes and do what he does.
[time=2594] We've got this house out there, offline a road, we've got some property.
[time=2599] It's about an acre and a half in the backyard you can't see the end of and there's trees everywhere and they just have great times out there playing well.
[time=2605] So now she's starting to want to do that more and more and more so and so she doesn't get it yet.
[time=2610] She will on the, and it's kind of, there's trees to climb over and it's somewhat maybe kind of dangerous but she still wants to go out there anyway with him.
[time=2620] Well, but she'll be inside 15 minutes prior to, she'll be inside, they'll be playing, she'll be kicking him in the ribs.
[time=2627] She'll be walking them across the head and he'll be there trying to exercise self-control.
[time=2631] She'll just be, you know, the little fireball that she can be sometimes and then five, ten minutes later they're wanting to go outside and play and they're walking out to the back and there she is.
[time=2641] With all that having gone on there, she is walking kind of waddling behind him and they get to the woods and there might be three or four other kids with him and we'll watch it from the window.
[time=2649] The three or four other older kids go shooting off into the woods and there she is not even to the edge of the woods yet.
[time=2654] She starts to cry, she got left and who comes back every single time?
[time=2659] He does. Every single time.
[time=2662] Yeah, I mean, and why did I talk about getting whacked across the head?
[time=2666] Well, because again, it's a deep and abiding commitment that goes beyond the circumstantial.
[time=2671] You and I know she would have every reason, he would have every reason at that point, humanly speaking, to say, "Hey, forget it." But every time you see him come back out of the woods and you see the arm go around her shoulder and walk in her back into the woods and all the friends are off doing their thing and there he goes.
[time=2685] Ten, fifteen minutes later, here he comes.
[time=2688] Back out of the woods, arm around her, helping her over sticks.
[time=2692] Brotherly love.
[time=2696] You and me.
[time=2697] You helping me.
[time=2698] Me helping you into the woods.
[time=2701] You helping me, me helping you out of the woods.
[time=2704] Over the things that are hard to get over, under the things that we have to go under.
[time=2708] You get the picture.
[time=2709] That's what should mark, that's what should characterize our relationships together.
[time=2714] How are you doing with those two people in your mind so far?
[time=2717] God, speaking to you, spirit convicting you.
[time=2720] Things that you can work on.
[time=2722] I hope so.
[time=2723] I know it is for myself very much so.
[time=2725] Don't forget what Peter himself said a passage or two back.
[time=2728] Go to 1 Peter 1, 22 with regard to this brotherly love that you and I are to have for each other.
[time=2735] Says in 1 Peter 1, 22, "Since you have in obedience to the truth, purify your souls for a sincere love of the brethren fervently for a sincere love of the brethren fervently love one another from the heart."
[time=2751] Our love for each other, our brotherly commitment is to be a fervent one, full of energy and passion.
[time=2757] Back to 1 Peter 3, Peter moves on.
[time=2760] Not only are we to be harmonious, not only are we to be sympathetic, not only are we to be brotherly, but he goes on and says, "Now kind-hearted, we're to be kind-hearted, the fourth mark or sign of a healthy relationship within the body of Christ is that it is kind-hearted.
[time=2777] A better word might be or another word might be tender, tender-hearted with each other.
[time=2784] Maybe even better might be the word or the idea of compassionate." And someone said it this way.
[time=2790] A kind-hearted person is one whose heart is easily touched.
[time=2797] Is that you?
[time=2799] Is your heart easily, easily touched?
[time=2804] Is your heart, is your heart tender towards people?
[time=2807] Is your spirit typically kind and gentle?
[time=2810] Are you prone to show mercy?
[time=2813] Ephesians 4-32, look quickly if you would at that it says, and be kind, and be kind to one another.
[time=2821] Tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also as forgiving you.
[time=2826] Does that represent your heart towards people in this church?
[time=2830] Does that represent relationally the way you approach and see people?
[time=2834] Is there a tenderness to your heart that's easily touched, that's easily affected?
[time=2840] Or do you quickly dismiss what's happening in their lives?
[time=2844] Do you quickly dismiss it and move on since it has little bearing with respect to your immediate comfort or circumstance?
[time=2851] Recently one author made this observation, "Where has compassion gone?" he says.
[time=2855] "Where have our hearts gone to?" And by that please remember he says, "I'm not asking with regard to the homeless or the lost, though I could.
[time=2864] I'm asking where have our hearts gone for each other?
[time=2867] Why do I sense in the church today a pace of life and an approach to people that keeps so many of us distant, unaffected and tragically self-consumed?
[time=2878] Are we willing to consider that in the spiritual busyness, in the frenzied pace of church life,
[time=2885] we have postured ourselves in a way that time and time again leaves those who are hurting, alone, and looking for help elsewhere?"
[time=2894] End quote.
[time=2896] That's too true.
[time=2898] In my opinion that's too true.
[time=2900] The busyness of our life, the frenzied pace of church activity leaves us so many times postured in a way where this idea of really being there,
[time=2910] this idea of really listening, this idea of really identifying, this idea of my heart really genuinely being touched by what's happening in your life.
[time=2918] Sometimes I'm too busy to be touched by you.
[time=2921] I've got too many things going on to be moved by what's happening in your life.
[time=2928] And so off we go.
[time=2932] Harmony is sympathetic, brotherly, kind-hearted.
[time=2936] And lastly, fifth mark of a right, healthy relationship in the body.
[time=2941] Humble in spirit.
[time=2945] It says right there in verse eight and humble in spirit, this last quality is in essence to one quality, right?
[time=2951] It's really the one thing he could have put it at the beginning as a jumping off point, instead he puts it at the end.
[time=2956] It is the one thing that allows the other four to even take place.
[time=2961] You see, you don't find genuinely sympathetic, non-divisive, brotherly, compassionate people who aren't what?
[time=2969] Humble in spirit.
[time=2970] You don't find it.
[time=2972] The phrase literally means this, and I want you to see the definition of what it means for you and I to be humble in spirit with each other.
[time=2978] It means this, the word the Greek phrase means to have a mild opinion of oneself.
[time=2985] To have a mild opinion of oneself and an exalted opinion as well as commitment to others.
[time=2994] A mild opinion of oneself, an exalted opinion of others.
[time=2999] Philippians two, Philippians two, three.
[time=3003] What does it say there?
[time=3005] There you have it.
[time=3006] Do nothing, Paul says to those at Philippi.
[time=3009] He says do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind.
[time=3014] There's that word in the Greek, that phrase, same phrase from 1 Peter 3.
[time=3018] With humility of mind, let each of you regard one another.
[time=3023] Let each of us regard each other as much more important than ourselves, much more important than himself.
[time=3032] You see the humble minded person here in this church has come to realize that our gods, our God ordained function on this earth really has little to do with me and a great more to do with others.
[time=3045] Let me ask you some questions before we close this up.
[time=3048] How do you typically respond when your agenda is tampered with or just plain obliterated?
[time=3053] How do you respond when your agenda, what you want to see happen, where you want to go, the way you think it should be done?
[time=3061] What happens in your heart when your agenda is tampered with?
[time=3065] When it's time to go and the family's not ready, when the group picks the restaurant that you didn't want to go to, when your daughter picks the wrong boyfriend, how do you respond when your agenda is tampered with?
[time=3077] How do you respond to someone who offers honest criticism or tells you that you've let them down?
[time=3084] When someone says it hurts me that you didn't make time for us this week, what's your response?
[time=3091] When someone says why don't you do a better job of keeping in touch, you said you would, you haven't.
[time=3096] How do you respond?
[time=3099] When someone says why when I get home do I have to ask for a hug? Why time and time again do you remain so removed from me, physically?
[time=3112] You need to be more gentle, please, when you talk with the kids.
[time=3117] When we hear these things, how do we respond? Are you two things? Are you defensive?
[time=3123] The most sure fire indicator of a lack of humility in one's spirit?
[time=3130] Or do we humbly listen, willingly taking in things that may even be hard to hear?
[time=3137] But what characterizes you? What characterizes you?
[time=3141] Are you defensive or do you humbly listen?
[time=3144] How do you respond when someone here talks with you about something you've said or done?
[time=3148] How do you respond when someone else receives the recognition that maybe you should have gotten?
[time=3155] All of this again, just trying to get you to think about the state of your spirit.
[time=3161] Is it humble? So that's what it's supposed to look like.
[time=3164] That's what it's supposed to look like, harmonious, sympathetic, brotherly, kind, hearted, humble and spirit.
[time=3170] And what it shouldn't look like, well there it is, verses 9 to 12, let's look at them just real quick and then we're going to close and have some time of worship
[time=3177] with regard to these truths. It says, not returning evil for evil or insult for insult, verse 9,
[time=3183] giving a blessing instead. Look at verse 10, let him who means to love life and see good days refrain his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking guile.
[time=3190] Let him turn away from evil and do good.
[time=3193] Let him seek peace and pursue it for the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous and his ears that tend to their prayer.
[time=3199] But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.
[time=3204] Hi, and welcome to the Bible Hour. We're so thankful that you're with us today.
[time=3209] And I want to take a moment to talk to you about something that I'm very, very excited about.
[time=3213] It's an offering that our church is giving to kind of a community.
[time=3217] And every now and then, you come across something you feel is so vital and so strategic and so important that while you're developing it for the people of your own church, you just have a sense that it has a broader appeal.
[time=3228] And that's what I'm excited to talk to you about today. It's a conference that we're offering on April 18th called Matur Choices, Matur Choices.
[time=3236] And the great news is Jay Kessler has even agreed to come and be a part of the conference as our keynote speaker.
[time=3242] But there's a driving force behind the Matur Choices Conference.
[time=3247] And it's one of the pastors on our staff. His name is Gene Cheryl and Gene Cheryl today.
[time=3252] I want to introduce you to Gene and have Gene tell you a little bit about it. Good morning, Gene.
[time=3255] Good morning, Russ.
[time=3256] Thanks for being with us today. Thanks for the invitation to be here.
[time=3259] Yeah, now what is Matur Choices all about?
[time=3261] Well, Matur Choices is born out of a passion of my part.
[time=3265] As you know, I'm the Associate Pastor in Pastoral Care.
[time=3269] And on a week-to-week basis, we have members of our congregation who are facing crisis situations in their families.
[time=3276] And they will approach me and they will ask me to give them information or assistance regarding some of those issues.
[time=3285] And so a crisis time is not a good time to be making wise decisions because time is of the essence.
[time=3293] So the Matur Choices Conference is born out of the desire in our part to provide good quality information to families that are facing those kinds of choices.
[time=3304] Now, you've told me there's like four key areas that these crisis happen.
[time=3308] Or if you're prepared in these four areas, you're pretty much okay.
[time=3311] Now, what are those?
[time=3312] Well, let me talk about those four.
[time=3314] One of, for example, is life and career choices.
[time=3317] And just to kind of give you an example, here in Fort Wayne, a number of our corporations are going through downsizing, through corporate mergers, and through hostile takeovers.
[time=3326] And in that process, some of those middle managers, men and women, are finding themselves out of a job.
[time=3333] And they're in their 40s and 50s.
[time=3336] And if you saw the National News here just a couple of weeks ago, a number of corporations are finding out that they can beef up their bottom line by replacing
[time=3343] that 40 and 50 year old with a 20 and 30 year old and return more money to their investors.
[time=3349] So, Matur Choices will have some seminars for people in that age bracket who have maybe lost their job due to downsizing or whatever other reason.
[time=3357] That's exactly right.
[time=3358] How to face that issue and how to be proactive and find another job.
[time=3361] We'll have professionals here to lead those workshops.
[time=3363] And those are entitled Life and Career Choices.
[time=3366] Okay.
[time=3367] Then we have another area.
[time=3368] There's a lot of caregiving.
[time=3374] A number of folks are finding that as their parents are entering the age in, of course, America is in the age-wave process.
[time=3381] People are living much longer.
[time=3383] And as they are living longer, they're facing choices and they're asking their children who now are in those middle ages to enter their lives and help them to make choices regarding where they're going to live those years out.
[time=3390] Most of them are going to be living in retirement homes.
[time=3392] In Fort Wayne alone, there are a number of new retirement homes that have gone up.
[time=3396] And so, the, the 40s and 50s and 60-year-olds are now entering their parents' lives to be caregivers.
[time=3404] And they need information as to assessing those needs and how to make good choices.
[time=3408] And, and for one example alone is in the area of finances.
[time=3412] And we're going to be doing financial choices as well too.
[time=3415] And that is about Medicaid.
[time=3417] And in Medicaid, it's not like income tax.
[time=3420] If you make a mistake on your income tax and you find out that you have money that really should be coming back to you, you can file an amended return.
[time=3427] Well, when you're setting up in a state plan and when you're setting up the caring for your, for your parents or even for yourself,
[time=3435] if you've made a mistake in there, you can't file an amended return about Medicaid.
[time=3439] Those choices and those decisions have to be made well in advance.
[time=3443] Interesting.
[time=3444] So, we have people who are going to leave those workshops as well.
[time=3446] Now, the third category is financial.
[time=3448] Right.
[time=3449] And then the last one is in health.
[time=3451] Because we're living longer and we're eating better.
[time=3455] How we live those latter part of our years has a whole lot to do as to how we take care of our bodies.
[time=3461] Marty Pastura, who's the director of the Downtown YMCA, is going to come and lead one of those workshops.
[time=3467] We actually have three workshops.
[time=3469] One will address staying fit for, you know, for all of your life through all those stages.
[time=3473] Another will have to do with eating healthy and eating for fun as well too.
[time=3478] Just because you're on a health plan for a diet doesn't mean it has to be blah food.
[time=3483] Right.
[time=3484] So, we have a dietitian who's going to lead a workshop.
[time=3486] And then staying emotionally and mentally fit as well too.
[time=3490] So, we have someone who will direct a workshop in that category.
[time=3493] That's exciting.
[time=3494] It is.
[time=3495] Sounds like a great deal.
