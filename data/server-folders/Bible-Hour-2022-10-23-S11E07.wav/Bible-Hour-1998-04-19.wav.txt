[time=87] This is the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=96] Thank you for joining us.
[time=98] Today Pastor Moore continues his study on the book of Romans.
[time=101] His message is entitled "Life in the Trenches".
[time=104] We hope you'll stay tuned.
[time=105] Now let's join our service.
[time=112] We've turned the page for a new day has come.
[time=120] And we've rearranged what is right and what's wrong.
[time=126] Somehow we've drifted so far from the truth that we can't get back home.
[time=135] And where are the virtues that once gave us life and where are the morals that governed our lives.
[time=147] Someday we all will look back and we'll find just to see what we've lost.
[time=161] We need to get back to the basics of life.
[time=167] The heart that is cruel and the love that is blind.
[time=173] A faith that is fervently grounded in Christ.
[time=179] The hope that endures for all time.
[time=185] These are the basics we need to get back to the basics of life.
[time=196] The newest rate is to reason it out.
[time=202] Just meditating you can overcome every doubt.
[time=208] After all man is a god they say God is no longer alive.
[time=217] But I still believe in the old rocket cross.
[time=222] But I still believe there is hope for the lost.
[time=229] I know the rock of all ages will stand through the changes of time, through the changes of time.
[time=242] We need to get back to the basics of life.
[time=248] The heart that is pure and the love that is blind.
[time=254] A faith that is fervently grounded in Christ.
[time=260] The hope that endures for all time.
[time=266] These are the basics we need to get back to the basics of life.
[time=275] We've let the darkness invade us too long, we got to turn the tide.
[time=287] Oh and we need compassion to burn long ago to come and open our eyes.
[time=296] There's no rule, no rule on our mind.
[time=303] We need to get back to the basics of life.
[time=308] A heart that is pure and the love that is blind.
[time=315] We need to get back to the basics of life.
[time=321] A heart that is pure and the love that is blind.
[time=327] A faith that is fervently grounded in Christ.
[time=333] The hope that endures for all time.
[time=338] Oh these are the basics we need to get back to the basics of life.
[time=346] The heart that is pure and the love that is blind.
[time=357] A faith that is fervently grounded in Christ.
[time=363] The hope that endures for all time.
[time=368] Oh these are the basics we need to get back to the basics of life.
[time=376] The basics of life, the basics of life, the basics of life.
[time=401] Several months ago, well I was at a basketball game here at the school, it was a girls game I think and at the conclusion of the game, folks were coming out of the stands to say hi to kids and parents were greeting each other and players were making their way to and fro and in the midst of it all, I looked down and saw a $20 bill right there on the floor, feet walking over it and kind of getting pushed aside and so I kind of locked in on that thing and walked over and picked it up and immediately was faced with the decision and I realized as I held it in my hand that you know you get that feeling people are watching you and I don't know if anybody was but I thought gee whiz this is a good time to make a good choice with this thing and so I found an official, a school official I think and gave it to him and he said he'd you know take care of it and I don't know what that meant but you know, I was thinking what if that had happened on my way in and it was outside
[time=455] in the parking lot and there hadn't been anybody around, nobody watching, nobody there, you know they say if you want to know the character of an individual, if you want to know what
[time=466] someone's really made of, you don't watch their public life, you watch them in what, in private because it is in private where we make choices, it is in the privacy even of our minds sometimes where we are confronted with situations and based upon the principle
[time=482] and the integrity that exists in our heart, we make decisions that reveal a great deal
[time=488] about our character, watch the drama here and see if you can't kind of maybe identify with some of these scenarios, you know it applies to kids, it applies to middle adulthood all through life, we have to make choices, do we make the right ones and what is it inside of us that helps us make those decisions.
[time=509] My mother always told me to do the right thing, it wasn't always easy and I didn't always do it, but I will say one thing, I at least tried to do the right thing, there was this
[time=522] time, when I was seven, Mommy, look what I found at the YMCA, a little purse, and there's
[time=537] money in it, really, well who does it belong to, nobody, it was sitting all by itself
[time=547] on the shelf by the window where we wait for Mrs. Spillman to pick us up after swim lessons, there's nobody there but me and Katie Spillman and I know it doesn't belong to her because I asked her, I see, Jenny what do you think is the right thing to do with this little purse,
[time=565] I knew you were going to ask me that and I already did it, oh you know how we get real
[time=572] hungry after swim lessons right, well Katie wanted to take the money down to the vending machine and buy candy, but I did the right thing and I said no, good for you, Jenny,
[time=582] I'm proud of you, see I told her that I had to ask your permission first because you don't
[time=588] like me to have snacks before dinner, so I was thinking maybe after dinner, we could go
[time=594] to the quick mart and I could buy some candy, Jeanine, it didn't take much for mom to convince
[time=602] me that returning the purse, money and all, to the YMCA was the right thing to do, and
[time=609] she even bought me a candy bar as a reward, doing the right thing became a bit more complicated
[time=615] during my college years, hey girl we're a fan, at the library waiting on you two no
[time=623] shows, didn't Jack give you the message, what message, we don't need to do any research
[time=631] tonight, what, did Westmoreland give us an extension I didn't hear about, no, no, no,
[time=637] the papers still do tomorrow morning, we just don't have to do it, wait a second, what am
[time=644] I not getting, oh how about three already written English lit 300 term papers guaranteed
[time=652] A's, what, that's right Jeanine, take your pick, we've got Hamlet's existential dilemma,
[time=658] the forces of nature in King Lear and ooh, Lady Macbeth is villain, where did you get
[time=665] these, oh Jack's sister lifted him from her profs office back at Eastern and FedExed him over to us, I guess these two courses are exactly identical, she grabbed four of them, Jack got the first one, the rest of them are ours, as soon as we change the names of course,
[time=681] I think we should take Jack out for pizza tonight huh, oh pizza come on the Mandy serves a steak, Jeanine, I don't know you guys, do you really think this is right, how could
[time=692] it be wrong Jeanine, yeah it's not like we're stealing answers to an exam or anything,
[time=698] besides no one will ever know, yeah what's the problem, I don't know you guys, oh come
[time=704] on Jeanine, do you want to stay up all night working in a library, just to turn in a questionable paper in the morning, but wouldn't you rather spend the evening with three friends enjoying a nice steak dinner and waking up in the morning to a guaranteed A, I knew in my heart that
[time=721] it was wrong, but in my head I just didn't know why, I ended up telling my friends I had
[time=727] a brilliant idea and a head start on the paper while I was waiting for them at the library, I don't think they bought it, they ended up getting A's, I gotta be, they had a nice
[time=738] steak dinner and I had a candy bar in the study carol at the library, I did the right
[time=745] thing but it continues to be a challenge, did you check your eggs, yeah, these went off
[time=763] special yesterday, you still want them, no I guess not, do you want me to put them back,
[time=769] no my bagger can do that, oh hey would you scan those for me first and see if they're
[time=777] 50% off, they were with the after Easter stuff, no pull pies, you want them, I guess
[time=784] I don't need those either, any coupons, nope that'll be 9133, and as I reach for my purse
[time=797] out of the corner of my eye I see the box of chocolates on top of my groceries, bagger must have grabbed them by mistake, a rush of excitement ran through my body, I was getting a free box of expensive chocolates, I didn't plan it, it was an honest mistake, if the cash
[time=815] you're noticed, of course I would act surprised but if not, they were mine free, you know,
[time=829] I couldn't even bring myself to eat just one piece of this expensive chocolate because
[time=835] I knew that it wouldn't taste nearly as good or be worth nearly as much as the candy bar
[time=841] I had so long ago, when I did the right thing.
[time=846] I know that he gave his life for me, said all our spirits free, so I gotta do right, gotta
[time=861] do right, all of my life, and I never dreamed that I could be home like you, well, he's
[time=875] making my dreams come true, wanna do right, wanna do right, I wanna do right, oh, you
[time=887] got to do right, oh, yes you gotta do right, let him be your guiding light, yes you gotta
[time=899] do right, let him be your guiding light, listen to me people, yes you gotta do right, yes you
[time=915] gotta do right, I used to say love was just a game we played, now I see it in a different
[time=930] way, so I gotta do right, you gotta do right, and I never dreamed that I could be home like
[time=947] you, well, he's making our dreams come true, so I wanna do right, wanna do right, I wanna
[time=957] do right, oh, you got to do right, yeah, yes you gotta do right, let him be your guiding
[time=975] light, listen to me people, you got to do right, yes you gotta do right, well we just can't
[time=993] keep on living like we're living, we just can't keep on living like we're living, we just
[time=1015] like we're living, we just can't keep on living, we just can't keep on living, we just can't
[time=1032] keep on living like we're living, we just can't keep on living like we're living, we just
[time=1071] living, we just can't keep on living like we're living, we just can't keep on living
[time=1094] on living like we're living, we just can't keep on living like we're living like we're
[time=1101] face the practical nitty gritty. This morning, I want to make an appeal to you for authentic
[time=1108] Christianity. Why the church is full of people like you and me desperately trying to cover
[time=1116] up and measure up astounds me when I read how openly the Bible describes the false failures
[time=1124] and sins of its heroes. Moses struck the rock and never went into the Holy Land. Jonah upon
[time=1134] preaching to the Ninevites and their unbelievable conversion was so depressed he wanted to kill
[time=1141] himself. David, his adultery and plot of murder are recorded throughout all of history in
[time=1148] black and white in God's Word. And certainly no attempt was made to gloss over the life
[time=1154] and times, the failures, the struggle and the denials of Peter. Flawed, fragile, sinful
[time=1163] men, God made no attempt to cover up or gloss over their failures. You almost get the impression
[time=1171] that God is saying okay everybody, masks off. There is a better way to live and it has something
[time=1177] to do with humility and brokenness and honesty and perseverance and unconditional love. If
[time=1187] you have your Bible with you this morning, let me invite you to open it to Romans 7.
[time=1191] We've been studying the book of Romans and we come kind of passage by passage through this book. And Paul in Romans 7, an effect is saying okay everybody, drop your guard.
[time=1206] Take off your masks as he admits for all the world to see that he still struggles with
[time=1214] sin in deep, confusing and sometimes unmanageable ways. I'll say that again. This morning Paul,
[time=1226] by letting you look inside of his own life, invites you to drop your guard and take off your mask as he admits for all the world to see that he still, even now an apostle, years
[time=1239] and years and years into his converted life, a leader of the New Testament church, he admits
[time=1246] that he still struggles with sin in deep, confusing and sometimes unmanageable ways.
[time=1255] I was trying to think of a way to review the book of Romans for us this morning and a photo
[time=1262] album came to my mind. I was thinking about a photo album and if we could take the contents
[time=1269] of Romans and make it into pictures or snapshots, I think this is what you'd see. As you open
[time=1275] the page to the first set of photos, you'd see the picture of a person who is weighed down with the guilt and the shame of their sin. There would be a sense of their lostness.
[time=1287] There would be a sense of emptiness. There would be a sense of shame and guilt. As Romans chapters 1-2 in the beginning of chapter 3, try to hold everybody in the world accountable before God. We are sinners. We do not measure up to his standard. We begin understanding
[time=1303] the grace of God by understanding that we are at empty with God because our sin alienates
[time=1309] him and keeps us from walking in fellowship with him.
[time=1315] If you return the page again to yet another picture in the photo album, you might see a picture of a person who is full of joy, whose heart is full of peace, who has the peace
[time=1325] of God written across their face. Because there you would see the understanding in Romans 3, the end of 3, 4, and 5 that we can be justified by God through faith in Christ. And
[time=1337] where we were once alienated from God and ashamed by our sin and weighed down by our guilt because of the provision of the death, the resurrection, and the sacrifice of Christ,
[time=1348] we now have peace with God. We have hope. The enmity with God is over.
[time=1355] And if you return the page again in the picture album of Romans, you'd come to chapter 6 and in chapter 6 you'd see a person who is full of hope, full of determination, and optimism
[time=1365] would mark this individual because they learned in Romans chapter 6 that they are no longer under the domination of sin. Sin is no longer master over them. They can, through the power
[time=1377] of God, because they're forgiven through Christ, break free to live a different kind of life. They can live a life that honors God. They can live a life that brings glory to his name. They can break out of the patterns that are self-destructive, the patterns
[time=1393] of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the boastful pride of life that lead people into cul-de-sacs of emptiness. And so in chapter 6 we'd see pictures of an individual
[time=1403] whose head is up and whose face is determined, who is convinced there is a better way to
[time=1409] live. And that would be true as they find themselves in Christ.
[time=1416] But as you turn the page of your photo album, yet one more time to Romans chapter 7, you would find a blank page because the activity that is going on in Romans chapter 7 is sinful,
[time=1430] it is shameful, it is unspeakable. But it is true. Even in the life of the Apostle Paul,
[time=1439] his photo album would be blank in chapter 7 because he would resist and would never want to put the photos of his behavior out there where he would try to go through that
[time=1450] over and over again. In other words, Romans chapter 7 is the chapter of sin in the believer's life. And though he has been freed from bondage to sin, and
[time=1461] though he can live differently, what we have to face in Romans chapter 7 is that Christians continue to sin even after they're born again, even after they're liberated from the power
[time=1472] of sin. And so I call the message this morning, life in the trenches. Life in the trenches.
[time=1479] Not the, not life on the mountaintop, spiritual experiences like we enjoyed last Sunday celebrating
[time=1485] the resurrection of our Lord. But there is a part of Christianity that we must embrace, that we must admit, that we must learn how to handle. And that is the part of Christianity that though we are forgiven, sin is still a struggle for us. And even like the Apostle
[time=1501] Paul, we can struggle against sin in deep and confusing and in times unmanageable ways.
[time=1510] So let's take our masks off and let's face the truth. I want to make four statements out of this text about life in the trenches. Four admissions of a believer who is in sin.
[time=1523] Four admissions of a believer who is in sin. Number one, the first admission that you will hear from a believer who is in sin is this, I long to live differently. If you have your
[time=1534] Bible open, look at the end of verse 18. Do you see there he says, "For the wishing
[time=1541] is present in me." Beginning of verse 19, "For the good that I wish," the end of verse
[time=1549] 21, "the one who wishes to do good." And here's the clearest statement of it all in verse 22, "For I joyfully concur with the law of God in the inner man." Now my friends,
[time=1562] that is uniquely the mark of a believer. And that is what separates the unbeliever from
[time=1571] the believer in terms of their perspective about their sin. The Bible says that unbelievers
[time=1578] love unrighteousness, that they love the darkness. They make friends with their sin.
[time=1585] But the fundamental mark of a believer is that he has a changed heart. He has a new disposition. He has a new orientation and therefore a new longing fills his heart for
[time=1597] I joyfully concur with the law of God in the inner man. A person who has been saved
[time=1603] longs to obey God, longs to serve God, to live for God, and to vote his life in new
[time=1610] ways to God for God's glory. A true believer wants to walk with God and run with God and
[time=1617] fly with God through life. If you ask a true believer, what is at the core of their heart?
[time=1624] What is the greatest longing of their heart? They will tell you something to the effect that what I really want to do is I want to live in a God-honoring way. Paul over in Philippians chapter 3 kind of explains it further detail how much he joyfully concurs with the law of
[time=1640] God in the inner man when he says this, "I count all things in my life to be lost in view
[time=1646] of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord." At the core of Paul's heart,
[time=1654] at the core of his life, what he is saying is the greatest thing in all the world to him
[time=1661] is the knowing of Christ Jesus my Lord. He does not mean by that intellectual know.
[time=1672] He does not mean by that a mental understanding of who Jesus is. When he says knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, he is referring to the kind of knowing that throughout the Bible depicts an intimate love relationship. He says, "All I want to do is be found in Christ. I don't
[time=1690] want a righteousness of my own derived independently of Christ through my own efforts and of course Paul knows you can never be righteous on your own effort." He says, "I want the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith in Christ." He says, "I want to know Christ.
[time=1708] I want to know the power of his resurrection of my life." And then he says, "I even want to know the fellowship of his sufferings." In other words, he's saying, "If knowing Christ,
[time=1718] if being in relationship with Christ would lead me to a lifestyle that brings enormous suffering and persecution. I choose that so long as it's with Christ over a life of comfort
[time=1730] without Christ." The first admission of a believer, the first true admission of a believer in
[time=1739] sin is this, "I long to live differently." Number two, it gets more intense than that.
[time=1746] Not only does a believer wish he could live differently, but a believer in number two, he says this, "I hate the lingering presence of sin in my life." In verse 15 of chapter
[time=1760] seven in Romans, he says, "But I do the very thing that I hate." In verse 19, he says,
[time=1766] "But I practice the very evil that I do not wish." In verse 24, he says, "Wretched man
[time=1773] that I am." I mean, what you hear from the heart of Paul when he realizes that though now even as saved, he continues to struggle with sin. He says, "I'm a wretched man."
[time=1787] A believer hates his sin. A believer fundamentally hates his sin. It torments his soul. It ruins
[time=1799] his day. It makes a joyful life impossible to live. All else could be well in the life
[time=1809] of a believer. His family could be healthy. His bank account could be full. His job could
[time=1815] be wonderful. His recreation could be awesome. All of that could be as good as it gets, but
[time=1824] if a believer is involved in sin, it will destroy his ability to enjoy all of those things because
[time=1834] he cannot stand unconfessed, unrepentant sin. It destroys his life. And that's what Paul
[time=1842] is saying in Romans chapter seven. David said it in his own way. David was nothing really
[time=1849] had changed in David's life from before the time that he committed adultery and then murdered that woman's husband. And afterwards, he hadn't lost his throne. He hadn't been found out
[time=1861] by the populace. He hadn't lost popularity. He hadn't lost his money. He hadn't lost his good looks and his strength and his intelligence. Nothing of any significance had changed in
[time=1872] his life before the moment that he committed adultery with Bathsheba, except sin had entered
[time=1879] his life, a sin that he was unwilling for a period of time to repent of. And we believe it was about a year before he finally was confronted by the prophet and repentant of his sin. But even though everything in his life had remained the same and should have been as satisfying to him as it was before, he says this in Psalm 32, "When I kept silent
[time=1900] about my sin," now listen to this existence, "my body wasted away through my groaning all
[time=1908] the day long." It was relentless. He says, "Day and night, your hand was heavy upon
[time=1914] me. My vitality was drained away as with the fervor heat of summer." That is the existence
[time=1924] of a true believer who is involved in sin. It seems to taint every single area of that
[time=1932] person's life. There is no way around it. There is no relief from it on a real consistent
[time=1939] level. And things that used to satisfy your heart, things that used to be a wonderful experience if you carry unconfessed, unrepented sin in your heart will become bland and vanilla
[time=1952] and boring and you'll wonder why and where did all the happiness go? You see, because
[time=1961] when we come to Christ, we are changed from the inside out. There's a real substantial
[time=1967] change that happens to us when we become believers. And as a result, we cannot live the way we
[time=1973] used to live and feel good about it. We cannot continue to act in ways that we used to act
[time=1979] without paying an enormous toll in our hearts because those behaviors are so contrary to
[time=1986] who God has made us to be. I was thinking about this yesterday. I had two things going
[time=1992] yesterday that perfectly illustrate this. I stuck out and played nine holes yesterday
[time=2000] and I shouldn't have. I shouldn't have. Number one, I was sick. And number two, my wife
[time=2008] needed my help. Our son has the chicken pox. And he doesn't fall asleep now until about
[time=2015] four in the morning because the medication he's on, like he sleeps for a couple of hours and he's just wired like all night long. For two nights in a row, my wife has done duty with him and stayed up. And her system has run down now to the point that she has a large and very, very painful canker sore on her lip. So not only is she not rested
[time=2035] all the day, but she is suffering from the fatigue in a very painful way in her mouth.
[time=2042] I should have stayed home. I should have given the pleasure of golf, rest, relaxation, whatever
[time=2049] you want to call it, a way to serve her and to support her and to help. And you know how
[time=2055] the story ends. I run out there. I get play in the game and it's a better day in terms
[time=2061] there's no win. My golf swings working perfect. I'm firing a great score. I'm with people I like and I enjoy and I hate every minute of it. Hate every minute of it. Everything's
[time=2074] circumstantially ought to be lighting me up, but because my heart is not right with God, because I am doing something I should not do. And it's not like, you know, doing something super, super sinful. The spirit of God had been clear. My responsibility was somewhere
[time=2089] else. It was a time to love. It was a time to sacrifice. It was a time to give. It was a time to be a player and somebody else's life backed out, ran away, hated it, absolutely
[time=2101] hated it. You see, when we come to Christ, there are things in our hearts that change.
[time=2110] And those things that change cause that kind of behavior to absolutely grieve our hearts
[time=2117] and our minds to the place that what ought to be enjoyed can't be. The third admission
[time=2123] of a center in sin, the third admission of a believer in sin is this, and this is big.
[time=2130] There is still a part of me, a big part of me, that is very responsive to temptation
[time=2136] and sin. Yes, I'm born again. Yes, I have a new disposition and a new orientation. But
[time=2145] the fact is, there's still a part that lingers in my being that is very sensitive and responsive
[time=2152] to temptation and to sin. Look at verse 17. He says that there is sin that still indwells
[time=2159] me. Verse 20, the end of the verse, but sin which dwells in me. Verse 21, I find in the
[time=2167] principle that evil is present in me. Verse 23, but I see a different law in the members
[time=2174] of my body. And they wage war against the law of my mind, making me a prisoner of the
[time=2180] law of sin which is in my members. Now this is very confusing. If you try to nail down,
[time=2188] okay, well, what is it that still remains that is sinful? What does he mean by the flesh?
[time=2194] What is he actually saying? And I must admit to you that a lot of study does not bring enormous clarity as to exactly where that sin is still located inside the human being.
[time=2204] But the main point he is trying to make is that there is still a part of Paul, the Apostle
[time=2210] Paul, the founder of the New Testament church, the writer of much of the New Testament, the man who is in history as devoted to God. He admits that even with all that other stuff
[time=2222] being true, there is still a huge part of him that is very responsive to the temptation
[time=2230] and to sin. He is saying to us here, yes, I have a new heart. And yes, I have a new mind
[time=2236] with new goals and new longings and new aspirations. I see things differently now that I've come
[time=2242] to Christ. I see people differently. I see issues differently. I see time differently.
[time=2247] I see sin differently. I am radically changed because of my relationship to Christ, but I have to admit that there is still a significant part of me that is very, very responsive to
[time=2263] temptation and sin. He is saying there that I am stuck as long as I am in this flesh,
[time=2272] as long as I still live on this planet, in this body, in this humanness, my humanness and my flesh. And I live in a sin-tainted world. And I cannot beat that out of me. I cannot
[time=2284] starve it out of me. I cannot pray it out of me. I cannot Bible study it out of me.
[time=2290] I cannot serve it out of me. There is nothing he is saying that he will ever be able to
[time=2297] do that will take him to a place where nothing in him is responsive to temptation and to sin.
[time=2306] Now, it is true that you can diminish your responsiveness to temptation and sin. It is
[time=2313] true that you can diminish the power of the things of this world to be persuasive in your heart. And that is by trying to starve out the deeds of the flesh and to pray against
[time=2325] them and to have Bible studies to shore up your heart and your thinking and to serve other people and to get your life moving in a direction that makes sin obviously less attractive. We can do that. And Paul was doing all of that. Maybe better than we will ever do. But the fact of the matter is this. Even in his maturity, even in his devotion
[time=2348] to God, there was still a huge part of Paul that remained very responsive to temptation
[time=2356] and to sin. The fourth admission. The fourth admission that he makes here is that I will
[time=2362] be stuck with this sin problem for the rest of my life. I will be stuck with this sin
[time=2371] problem for the rest of my life. Look at verses 24 and 25. He says, "Wretched man that I am,"
[time=2378] and here's the longing. "Who will set me free from the body of his death?" Paul knows that he will not stop being responsive to sin and temptation as long as he is in his body.
[time=2390] The only solution for him is to get out of his body, to get completely out of his humanness.
[time=2395] And then you hear verse 25. "Thanks be to God through Christ Jesus our Lord." And he
[time=2401] is not here thanking God for the forgiveness of his sins that come through Christ. He is thankful and he's done that other places. But that's not what he's thanking God for here. What he is thanking God for here is the reality that when he sees Christ, when
[time=2416] Paul actually lays his eyes on the resurrected Christ, that will be the moment when Paul
[time=2422] will forever be set free from this stuff in him that still lingers towards sin. It's an
[time=2432] amazing little phrase, "Who will set me free from the body of this death?" Set me free as a phrase that was used of a soldier running to rescue one of his comrades out of the arms
[time=2444] or the hands of the enemy. You picture a scene in your mind where one of your comrades in
[time=2451] battle has fallen and is about ready to be taken a prisoner of war and that guy cries out, "Who will set me free?" That's the phrase, "Who will come and rescue me? Who will come and set me free?" I don't want to go into captivity with this enemy. I'm going to brave friend. A brave soldier runs to his rescue and frees him. Paul is saying,
[time=2472] "Who will rescue me? Who will finally and fully and totally deliver me?" Not just from
[time=2479] the punishment of sin, but from sin itself. And of course he cries out in verse 25, "Thanks
[time=2486] be to God, that'll come through Jesus Christ, my Lord." In 1 John chapter 3 it says this,
[time=2493] "We know that when Christ appears, we will be like him because we shall see him just
[time=2499] as he is." I don't understand all that my friends, but there will be something about seeing Christ and you may die first and then be resurrected and see him the moment you
[time=2510] die you're with the Lord and that may be the moment where you are totally transformed and conformed to Christ. Or you and I may be alive when Christ comes in the rapture and when we see him there that will transform us instantly. It is not death that transforms
[time=2525] us. It is the sight. It is being in direct visual contact with Christ and then we will
[time=2533] be like him because we shall see him just as he is. Paul is saying, "Until that moment
[time=2540] I will not be fully transformed. Sin will never be fully rooted out in my life, but there
[time=2546] is a time when I see Christ and sin. I will never disobey God again. I will never have
[time=2556] a selfish motive again. I will never say a hurtful thing or even what to say a hurtful
[time=2562] thing or even feel a hurtful thing again for all of eternity." Excuse me here. It is
[time=2576] an amazing thing. Four admissions of a believer in sin. Number one, I long to live differently.
[time=2581] Number two, I hate the lingering presence of sin. Number three, there is still a part of me that is very responsive to sin and temptation. Number four, I am stuck with this
[time=2594] sin problem for the rest of my life. Having taught you the text, I want to bring a couple
[time=2603] of words of application and we will wrap it up. I want to talk by way of application to three different categories of your life. First, I want to try to apply this truth to you individually, personally, and then I want to try to apply this to you and your friends.
[time=2618] Then I want to try to apply this to us corporately when we meet together. First, individually.
[time=2627] Look again at verse 15. Do you see what he says there for that which I am doing I do not understand? You and I need to be able to embrace the confusion of sin in our life.
[time=2641] You need to be able to say I don't have all the answers about obedience. I don't have all the answers about how to be victorious in this situation. I mean not only do I not
[time=2651] have answers for you, I don't have answers from me. I don't understand why I continue to sin. The Bible says I will but I still don't understand it. I don't have everything
[time=2662] down pat in my life. I don't have everything wired. I don't have everything under control.
[time=2668] I don't know why sometimes when at the beginning of the day I come with a fresh heart to the Lord and I have a quiet time and I read the scriptures and I pray and I give the entire day to the Lord. I don't understand why those days are sometimes my most sinful and rebellious
[time=2682] day. I don't understand. I don't get it. There are things working inside of me which
[time=2690] are incomprehensible. In verse 17 he says something else. He says so no longer am I the
[time=2701] one doing it but sin which indwells me. He talks about his imperfection. Not only do we need to say I don't understand myself, we need to say I accept the fact that I am an imperfect human being. It doesn't mean we make friends with our imperfections. It doesn't
[time=2717] mean we give into them. It doesn't mean we use them to rationalize our way to characteristically sinful behavior but there is something inside of each of us that needs to be able to embrace our imperfections like Paul did. Another thing that I think we need to do personally
[time=2733] is we need to leave room for failure. We need to leave room for failure and that's a touchy
[time=2740] thing because we're called to holiness. We're called to holiness. We've got to strive for holiness. We long for holiness. We want to be holy. But sometimes if you let that stuff push itself out to an extreme and we fail to leave room for the fact that we will never
[time=2758] make it on this earth. We will never achieve it on this earth. We never leave room for failure then we have to pretend that we never fail and that is dangerous stuff. And then
[time=2773] lastly individually I think we need to be able to admit our true feelings to God. Verse 24
[time=2779] Paul models that he says wretched man that I am. I mean that is a gut wrenching admission
[time=2785] of his emotions about himself to God. So individually be able to say you don't understand.
[time=2792] Individually be able to accept your imperfections. Individually you need to leave room for failure in your life. Individually you need to admit your true feelings to God on these issues.
[time=2805] Now let me talk about the truth of this text as it relates to friendships. I want to say
[time=2811] this, you need to seek to cultivate the kinds of relationships with other people that will
[time=2817] allow you to be honest and to share your struggles. Do you have people in your life even besides
[time=2824] your spouse who know the deepest darkest stuff about you? I believe based upon this text and
[time=2833] another one I will read in a minute you should. If you are going to experience the full dynamics
[time=2839] as God intended you to experience them there need to be trusted, honored friends in your
[time=2845] life who know the deepest darkest stuff about you. In James chapter 5 James writes this
[time=2856] confess your sins to one another and he is not talking necessarily about the sin that
[time=2864] I just did to you so I confess it and you already know it. The context allows for a confession
[time=2870] of sins that had nothing to do with me sinning against you had to do with sins that you might not even have known about if I didn't what? Confess them, confess your sins to one another
[time=2881] verse goes on and pray for one another so that you may be healed and the healing there
[time=2887] is not a physical healing it is a spiritual strengthening and healing of your inner man.
[time=2893] Listen, why do you think God gave us a Bible that so unashamedly discloses the sin in
[time=2901] everybody's lives? Why do you think God did that? Why do you think that God was careful
[time=2908] to preserve people's lives in an honest way not just the high points not just the great successes of Moses and David and Jonah and Peter? Why is so much of the record complete
[time=2919] and replete with their sin? I don't think it's by accident. I think he is trying to promote
[time=2925] a kind of community inside saved sinners believing sinners where not irrationally and
[time=2933] not stupidly and not without caution but in the context of close meaningful strong relationships
[time=2940] we are to be able to confess our sins one to another so we can pray for each other so that we can be healed. It is not a solo sport sinning is not a solo sport. Dietrich Bonhoeffer
[time=2955] a man who lived through Hitler's day and made the conscious deliberate choice to go back
[time=2962] and minister where he knew the chances were high he would eventually be incarcerated by Hitler and he was a man of tremendous faith a man of tremendous strength in God says this
[time=2973] on this particular topic. "sin demands to have a man by himself it will draw him from
[time=2983] the community the more isolated a person is the more destructive will be the power of
[time=2989] sin over him and the more deeply he becomes involved in it the more disastrous is his isolation sin wants to remain unknown it shuns the light in the darkness of the unexpressed
[time=3003] it poisons the whole being of a person this can happen listen to this this can happen
[time=3010] even in the midst of a pious community of believers you see if all we ever do is bump
[time=3018] into each other on superficial levels and that's appropriate most of the time but if that's the the sum total of our community as a church if we don't have pockets of people that are entering into meaningful relationships sharing the deepest darkest struggles of the heart then we have a loud sin to isolate us from real community he goes on in confession
[time=3043] the light of the gospel breaks into the darkness and seclusion of the heart the sin is brought
[time=3049] into the light the unexpressed is openly spoken and acknowledged all that is secret and hidden
[time=3055] is made manifest it is a hard struggle until the sin is openly admitted but God breaks
[time=3062] gates of brass and bars of iron he says Psalm 107 let me go a little bit further with
[time=3070] this quote you need to hear this the expressed acknowledged sin has lost its power it has
[time=3078] been revealed and judged as sin it can no longer tear the fellowship asunder now the fellowship
[time=3084] bears the sin of the brother he is no longer alone with his evil for he has cast off his
[time=3090] sin in confession and handed it over to God and I would add to his brothers and his sisters Bonhoeffer says it has been taken away from him now he stands in the fellowship of sinners
[time=3101] who live by the grace of God in the cross of Jesus Christ the sin concealed separated
[time=3107] him from the fellowship made all his apparent fellowship a sham the sin confessed has helped
[time=3115] him define true fellowship with the brother in Jesus Christ in quote I believe that I believe
[time=3122] the Bible teaches that and I believe a lot of us are scared to death of it I believe a
[time=3130] lot of us are scared to death of it to be seen for who we really are and the fear of
[time=3137] being rejected because we're not holy enough or by this time we're not mature enough or
[time=3143] I can't believe you could still struggle with that I have a buddy who used to be an alcoholic
[time=3154] well he still is an alcoholic he's just not a practicing alcoholic been off that stuff for a long long time and I love one of his phrases they taught it to him in those AA meetings that's this you're only as sick as your secrets you are only as sick as your
[time=3172] secrets why because if you're keeping secrets you lack integrity you lack the integrity the
[time=3182] soundness that says I refuse to wear a facade I refuse to wear a mask I am who I am and
[time=3192] I invite you to love me as I am and I will do the same in return you're sick if you keep
[time=3200] your secrets because it reveals that you really do want to hold on to that sin oftentimes
[time=3208] your refusal to admit it to a brother or a sister and the implied accountability that goes with it really reveals you don't really want to repent you want to stop it for now
[time=3218] you want to back away from it for a period of time but you don't really want to be free from it and you're sick with your secrets because sin makes you sick it weakens your
[time=3231] system it tears down your moral fiber it takes away the power and the strength to live a prevailing
[time=3239] life so individually I think the passage means some of those things and corporate friendship
[time=3246] wise I think it means some of those things let me get done here with this last thing which is corporately corporately what does it mean to us what is this passage one of the implications of this passage to us corporately and I got to say this to you from my heart Sunday morning
[time=3261] in this room should be an intensely powerful time for you and God Sunday morning should
[time=3271] be an intensely powerful time for you and God it should not necessary it is but the highest
[time=3278] thing about Sunday morning should not be seeing your friends seeing how everybody looks catching
[time=3284] up on their week wondering about the music wondering about the message these are good
[time=3290] things but that is not essentially what worship should be about in your heart and your life as you come here every Sunday morning the truth of this passage tells us that we struggle
[time=3302] still with sin that is deep it is confusing and sometimes it is unmanageable and that
[time=3310] leads me to believe that when you and I come into this room it is preeminently a time to re enlist with God we come here to re up to re any to recommit to re repent to re give
[time=3326] our life to God and you say to me why do you lose your salvation if you if you had no remember we are eternally secure but that is based upon his faithfulness his faithfulness not our faithfulness and our sin is treason our sin is compromise our sin is blasphemy our sin
[time=3346] is treacherous and we need to come here every Sunday morning saying oh God wherever I am
[time=3353] today still hard in my sin or fully repent of my sin you got to know wherever I am I need
[time=3359] the spirit of God to continue to work in my heart because I want to re enlist today I want to re up I want to recommit I want to re repent count me in another seven days man
[time=3370] I'm on I'm on the team I'm on the team and I'm on a fresh and I'm on a new because since
[time=3377] I was here last time I've had fresh treason you see I don't like a kind of Christianity
[time=3384] that portrays people that once they come to Christ and get to a certain level of maturity they never really have any bad sin anymore they never have any really deep questions they never have any struggles because when I watch Paul go through the New Testament do you realize that his admission of sin got bolder and stiffer the longer he was in the
[time=3402] Lord the last thing he said about himself over in the closing letters of the New Testament for him anyway we're in the book of Timothy and he called himself the chief of sinners
[time=3412] he'd never said that about himself before in other words the longer he was with the Lord the more clearly he saw his sin and the more it drieved his heart and and the more powerful it was in in the sense of I have violated my god we need not come here on Sunday mornings
[time=3431] to put icing on the cake to dress up the fringes of our lives this needs to be a time where
[time=3440] we radically surrender again and again and again and again to whatever the spirit of
[time=3448] God through the music through the preaching or just whatever he's doing in your heart
[time=3455] so personally we say things like I don't understand I need to accept my imperfections I need to learn and leave room for my failures I need to admit my true feelings to God on
[time=3469] our friendship level this text means in my opinion that we need to be able to confess our sins to one another and we're in trouble if we don't have some friends that help us do that so that we can pray for each other and so that we can be healed and then corporately
[time=3487] we need to come in here every Sunday morning with a sense in our hearts that is so directed
[time=3494] towards God that makes us so vulnerable in his presence that leaves us so honest with
[time=3501] him that we are not ashamed to re-up we are not ashamed to re-enlist we are not ashamed
[time=3511] to admit the treason that we have committed against him in the previous days and hours
[time=3519] and we hope then to leave with hearts of integrity and honesty and truth let me invite you to
