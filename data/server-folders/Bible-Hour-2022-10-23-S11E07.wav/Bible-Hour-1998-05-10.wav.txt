[time=30] The Bible Hour is sponsored today by D. O. McCombensons.
[time=49] Celebrate the lives of the people you love.
[time=53] Probably one of the biggest triumphs in the boy's life isn't winning the science fair.
[time=60] Or having the most marbles.
[time=63] It's carrying on the legacy of the family business.
[time=67] It's the honor of being the next generation to serve the community.
[time=72] It's the pride and blessing of his father.
[time=76] It's the sort of thing that doesn't fit in a shoebox.
[time=80] D. O. McCombensons Funeral Homes.
[time=91] This is the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=95] Thank you for joining us.
[time=97] Do you know what it means to worship God?
[time=99] Does it mean to sing hymns and attend church on Sunday?
[time=102] And what about the rest of the week?
[time=104] Today Pastor Moore talks about what God's definition of worship is.
[time=107] We hope you'll stay tuned.
[time=109] Now let's join our service.
[time=111] Well, it's Mother's Day.
[time=112] And we wanted to just kind of do something special if we could for our moms.
[time=116] You know, the bread was a start.
[time=118] We also thought, you know what, let's hear from some of our own people about moms.
[time=124] And so we got a great group of folks together, some on the younger side, some kind of in the middle, and some a little bit later in life.
[time=132] And we gave them a chance to talk about their moms, what they enjoyed doing with their mom, what they appreciate about their mom, what they want to emulate in their mom.
[time=140] And we thought you'd enjoy taking a listen and seeing what they had to say.
[time=144] So take a look.
[time=148] [MUSIC]
[time=153] Me and my mom like to go to the grocery and we just hang out there and we get all our stuff and mess around.
[time=160] But she's always up and talking to me all the time, fine-eater.
[time=165] And we go camping and take long walks there.
[time=171] And she's always there for me.
[time=173] She's the best mom.
[time=175] My mom takes me to the mall and we like planning flowers together in our garden.
[time=180] My mom and I play with my mom on the computer.
[time=186] And it's fun because there's this game on the computer that we play and we keep it.
[time=192] And it's so competitive and we keep trying to beat each other.
[time=197] My mom and I play with puzzles and we watch movies and we play house.
[time=202] Me and my mom, we like to go camping together and we always have a fun time.
[time=210] And we ride bikes together and that's always fun.
[time=217] My mom takes me to the park, feeds me food.
[time=221] She makes me dinner.
[time=223] She makes me breakfast.
[time=226] She takes me to go to the library and pick out books.
[time=231] Some of the fun things me and my mom did when we were little.
[time=235] When I was little, we had like a special cuddle time.
[time=239] She'd give me like a hundred kisses.
[time=241] Sometimes my mom takes me to the ice to stand and jumps on the train pulling.
[time=245] And we like to go shopping and go to the library.
[time=249] My mom and I play games.
[time=252] We ride bikes and we watch a way.
[time=256] Me and my mom like to go shopping together and we like to play games with each other and like to tell jokes and she makes me laugh.
[time=267] My mom do's pick some flowers and makes cakes
[time=273] and go to the fair and buy some groceries.
[time=281] What I love to do with my mom, I think she's so kind.
[time=285] I just, she like on my birthday, whatever kind of cake I want, she gives me and she, I don't know, I just appreciate her so much.
[time=295] She's always like running me places and doing stuff with me.
[time=299] And I just love her so much.
[time=311] The thing I like the most about my mom is she's always willing to listen to us and she's always put God in her family first.
[time=317] The thing I like the most about my mom is that she's always the same and she's consistent.
[time=321] I like how my mom is so nice to everybody and I hope I can be more like her and like her when I'm her age.
[time=329] The thing I like most about my mom is probably all the running around she does for me
[time=335] and just taking care of me and bringing things to me at school or whatever
[time=341] and I just appreciate that.
[time=344] The greatest thing about my wonderful mom is that she's a great Christian and she encourages and helps me
[time=351] with my problems and she's fun and she makes me feel good about myself.
[time=359] The thing that I like the most about my mom is how she's always patient with me no matter how much of a pain I am.
[time=365] The thing I admire most about my mom is the fact that she's always there for me and that she's always willing to talk to me whenever I need her, whenever I'm struggling with a problem.
[time=373] I just really love her a lot. Thanks mom.
[time=385] One of the things that I appreciate about my mom, a quality that I would like people to see in me is she was very committed to her family.
[time=392] She had quite a spirit and she worked hard for her family and never complained.
[time=397] She also taught me how to cook and she made great pies.
[time=402] My mom had the ability to make my friends feel like part of the family and to make others feel welcome in our home.
[time=410] So hospitality is something I like to emulate in my mom.
[time=414] One of the fondest memories of my mother is when I was overseas and had been in combat she would always pray for me.
[time=425] Hopefully see that I came back safely.
[time=428] Okay one of the qualities about my mother that I really appreciated and I'd like to emulate is she always prayed with us and told us about God.
[time=437] I brought Bible stories into our lives and made a part of our everyday life and I would like to carry on that tradition with my boys.
[time=444] I think the one thing that I really like about my mother is her sense of humor and her ability to bring out the best in a situation
[time=453] and she doesn't take herself seriously and it just makes life a lot of fun and brings a lot of laughter into my life.
[time=461] The quality I would like to most emulate in my mother is the spirit of giving, the fact that she always puts her friends and family first and foremost.
[time=468] When I think of my mom I think of a woman who loves the Lord deeply.
[time=473] One of my fondest memories of her is from the time I was a young child she would tuck me in at night and she would pray with me.
[time=481] And I remember feeling like her prayers really reached God and I remembered when I would pray it felt like it bounced off the ceiling.
[time=490] One of the best memories I have about my mom is the fact that she would pray for me.
[time=494] There were times when I was a child I'd be laying in bed and she would come in and place her hands in my head and she would pray for me.
[time=501] She was thinking that I was asleep but I was awake and I heard every word.
[time=505] I think what I really appreciate about my mom the most is just watching her live her Christian faith day by day and this was really evident.
[time=512] A year ago December my father died and I told my mom that it was really neat for me to watch him die a Christian death.
[time=519] But I get to watch her live her faith and especially now as she lives without my father it is so good to talk to her.
[time=527] And she will often say to me how the money might be tight or whatever but she always adds that she's just trusting the Lord.
[time=534] And it's really neat for me to see this live day by day by her.
[time=537] One of the best memories I have of my mother is back when I was 18 and thoroughly thought I knew it all and was sure I did.
[time=545] My mother was trying to tell me some things and I politely told her I said mom you can't tell me what to do anymore.
[time=552] I'm 18 now and I can do whatever I want to do.
[time=556] And she said yes that's true but there's one thing I can do for you that you can't control or have anything to do with.
[time=564] And I said what's that?
[time=566] She said I can pray for you.
[time=569] And from this day forward I've never forgotten that and I'm sure she did pray for me many many times.
[time=576] I'm always gotta believe that she never went to bed till late.
[time=591] Yet I never heard her complain about her family or their team.
[time=600] There were times she should have been sleeping yet late in the midnight hour.
[time=609] She'd get down on her knees and you could hear her say Lord fill them with your power.
[time=621] Mama liked to burn the midnight oil down on her knees and pray.
[time=629] If you asked her why she did it, she said she did it cause she care.
[time=639] Mama knew that Jesus was waiting as she knelt by a rock and chair.
[time=647] Oh I'm glad my mom was willing to burn the midnight oil in prayer.
[time=665] Now mom was going to be with Jesus I got a family of my own but whenever the clock strikes midnight
[time=679] you will find me all alone.
[time=683] That's when I start to call upon Jesus for his wisdom and his power
[time=692] because it seems that he loves to hear a deadest prayer even in the midnight hour.
[time=703] Mama liked to burn the midnight oil down on her knees and pray.
[time=712] If you asked her why she did it, she said she did it cause she care.
[time=721] Mama knew that Jesus was waiting as she knelt by a rock and chair.
[time=729] Oh I'm glad my mom was willing to burn the midnight oil in prayer.
[time=740] Years from now and my grown little boy has a family of his own.
[time=748] Will he be lying grand when the hour is late and pass the legacy on?
[time=766] Mama liked to burn the midnight oil down on her knees and pray.
[time=775] If you asked her why she did it, she said she did it cause she care.
[time=784] Mama knew that Jesus was waiting as she knelt by a rock and chair.
[time=792] Oh I'm glad my mom was willing to burn the midnight oil in prayer.
[time=805] Now there's a daddy who's willing to burn the midnight oil in prayer.
[time=835] When I think about moms and especially my own and even as I watch my wife with our three kids,
[time=847] there is a word that comes to mind over and above all other words.
[time=851] When I think about describing the love of a mother and that would be sacrifice.
[time=857] You all, all of you mothers, you make sacrifices, hundreds of them on a weekly basis.
[time=863] You give up your life in many respects to love and care for and make the kind of investment that you make.
[time=870] And we want to make sure you hear us loud and clear this morning.
[time=873] Thank you. Thank you for doing that. Thank you for loving us that much.
[time=878] Thank you for caring that much and thank you for having that kind of a heart.
[time=885] Well let's worship. What do you say?
[time=888] And again remember regardless of the week that you've had, regardless of the morning that you've had, don't forget that. Bring that week. Bring the last three or four hours.
[time=898] Let's collectively together bring it all to him right here and let me remind you of what it says in Psalm 103.
[time=906] It says, "Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name." That word "bless" means say, think and say good things about him.
[time=918] Bless his holy name and forget none of his benefits.
[time=921] He who pardons all your iniquities, who heals all of your diseases, who redeems your life from the pit, who crowns you with loving kindness and compassion, who satisfies your years with good things, so that your youth is renewed like the eagle.
[time=941] [MUSIC]
[time=961] For the beauty of the earth, for the glory of the skies, for the love which rely on life,
[time=981] over and around the skies, for the hope to leave it with art in a brittle place.
[time=1000] [MUSIC]
[time=1006] For the wonder of each other, of the day and of the night,
[time=1020] do that day and tree and fire.
[time=1027] So the people and stars are mine, so you'll fall to be with me.
[time=1036] Can't start in a great long day.
[time=1044] [MUSIC - 112 seconds]
[time=1184] Well, let me invite you to open your Bibles this morning to Romans chapter 12.
[time=1190] We continue in our study of the Book of Romans, and we come this morning to one of the most famous couple of verses,
[time=1197] and the whole Bible, Romans chapter 12 verses 1 and 2.
[time=1201] It's those verses about a living, presenting yourself, your body's a living sacrifice, holding acceptable to God, and I'm not just saying this because it's Mother's Day, but as I look around for a contemporary example of people who live this verse, presenting themselves, a living and holy sacrifice acceptable to God, oftentimes the role and the pattern and the sacrifice and the living for other people
[time=1226] that really is embodied in motherhood is what often comes to my mind.
[time=1230] I'm going to take a different tack with it, though, because the text kind of demands it.
[time=1234] The word I urge you, see at the beginning, is really a military term.
[time=1239] It's Para Colleto, and it was used of generals who would urge their troops into battle,
[time=1246] just on the brink of moving towards battle.
[time=1249] They would urge their men with great talks and such, and so I'll defer the day to Paul's imagery.
[time=1257] On December 7, 1941, Roosevelt called it a date which would live in infamy.
[time=1263] At 7.55 a.m. on that Sunday morning, a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor by Japanese naval and air forces sunk and severely damaged 18 of our ships,
[time=1274] destroyed 200 of our planes and killed 3,700 of our people.
[time=1281] The next day, President Roosevelt went before Congress to ask for a declaration of war against Japan.
[time=1287] On December 9, he spoke to the nation by radio, and this is an excerpt from that very first fireside chat.
[time=1297] The sudden criminal attacks, perpetuated by the Japanese and the Pacific, provide the climax of a decade of international immorality.
[time=1306] Powerful and resourceful gangsters have banded together to make war upon the whole human race.
[time=1312] Their challenge has now been flung at the United States of America.
[time=1317] The Congress and the people of the United States have accepted that challenge.
[time=1322] Together with other free peoples, we are now fighting to maintain our right to live among our world neighbors in freedom and in common decency without fear of assault.
[time=1332] We are now in this war.
[time=1335] We are all in it all the way. Every single man, woman, and child is a partner
[time=1342] in the most tremendous undertaking of our American history.
[time=1346] We must share together the bad news and the good news, the defeats and the victories,
[time=1352] the changing fortunes of war.
[time=1355] Every citizen in every walk of life shares this same responsibility.
[time=1361] The lives of our soldiers and sailors, the whole future of this nation, depend upon the manner in which each and every one of us fulfills his obligation to our country.
[time=1373] On the road ahead, their lives hard work, grueling work, day and night, every hour and every minute the United States does not consider the sacrifice to do all one can
[time=1384] to give one's best to our nation when the nation is fighting for its existence
[time=1390] and its future.
[time=1393] It is not a sacrifice for any man old or young to be in the army or navy of the United States, rather it is a privilege.
[time=1400] It is not a sacrifice for the industrialist or the wage earner, the farmer or the shopkeeper,
[time=1406] the trainman or the doctor to pay more taxes, to buy more bonds, to forgo extra profits, to work longer or harder at the task for which he is best fitted.
[time=1417] Rather, it is a privilege.
[time=1420] We are going to win the war and we are going to win the peace that follows.
[time=1426] And in the dark hours of this day, and through the dark days that may be yet to come, we will know that the vast majority of the members of the human race are on our side.
[time=1436] Many of them are fighting with us, all of them are praying for us, for in representing our cause we represent theirs as well.
[time=1443] Our hope and their hope for liberty under God almost gives you goosebumps, doesn't it?
[time=1450] Articulate, impassioned, stirring call to action on the heels
[time=1457] of one of the greatest tragedies in wartime American history.
[time=1462] I'm thankful as you are that this challenge and this call did not fall on deaf ears.
[time=1467] The people of America worked grueling work day and night, every hour, every minute.
[time=1472] They sacrificed, they gave their best.
[time=1477] The industrialists did, the wage earner did, the farmer did, the shopkeeper did, the trainman did, the doctor did, everybody did, everybody did all they could to survive,
[time=1487] to win, to conquer.
[time=1490] The reason I believe that kind of stirs us in our inner man, the reason it gives us goosebumps, the reason almost now and astoundically you look back at that particular time in history and wish you could have been a part of it, and some of you I know were, and thank you for what you did, is because you and I were made to live for a cause.
[time=1510] You and I were made to live for something bigger than ourselves, something we could be called to, something we could be challenged to that we could work for and be stretched towards and sacrificed for this noble cause.
[time=1524] That's part of what it means to be a human being, that's how God made us.
[time=1527] And this morning, as we huddle around, not our radios, but the Bible, we listened to yet another call, a call that is even greater than the one we just read.
[time=1536] It is the call of Romans chapter 12, verses 1 and 2, look now if you will, and let it stir you, for it is what you were made to respond to.
[time=1544] He says, "I urge you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice acceptable to God,
[time=1554] which is your spiritual service of worship.
[time=1558] Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what the will of God is,
[time=1568] that which is good and acceptable and perfect." Again, the word urge is paracalato, it is the word that was used classically and this time, in this era, by military commanders who were calling their troops to go do something which may cost them their lives.
[time=1588] And this morning, Paul, like any great commander calling his people to battle, answers a couple of really profound questions that have to be answered if people are going to respond to a call of this magnitude.
[time=1601] And those are, you know, what is it that you're asking me to do?
[time=1604] Why are you asking me to do it and how am I going to get it done?
[time=1609] And so we'll follow that as our outline this morning.
[time=1611] What the why and the how of becoming a living sacrifice for God?
[time=1617] What exactly is he calling us to do?
[time=1620] You see it in verse 1, the phrase is that you and I would present our bodies a living and holy sacrifice acceptable to God.
[time=1630] God is not just interested in our bodies.
[time=1635] As you know, God wants our soul, our mind, our strength, our hearts.
[time=1640] He wants all of us, but the reason just the body is here listed is because it's exemplary of all the rest.
[time=1646] This is Old Testament language, the imagery that is conjured in the mind of the person who reads this, thinks of the Old Testament burnt offering.
[time=1654] And in the Old Testament, there was a specific time and a specific place and a specific activity that went on which comprised worship, the giving of yourself.
[time=1662] And you didn't give yourself on the altar.
[time=1664] You didn't crawl up there and get burnt and allow the aroma of your burnt flesh to ascend to the heavens.
[time=1669] It was instead something else, a prized lamb, a prized dove, something which had the quality and the nature and the stature of what was supposed to be in your heart by way of saying thank you to God and acknowledging him and paying tribute to his greatness.
[time=1685] So the body is really not all that God wants, and it's never all that he's wanted.
[time=1690] He's never wanted compartmentalized, segmented, detached kind of worship.
[time=1694] In fact, that's what happened in the Old Testament.
[time=1697] They, like we, lost the real significance of that specific time and place.
[time=1702] For us, it's Sunday morning, it's the time of worship, corporate worship.
[time=1705] For them, it was the festival and the feast and the times when they would go to the temple and offer and sacrifice a specific way, a specific time.
[time=1713] But God's never been interested in that being the sum total of our worship.
[time=1718] That has always been supposed to be, anyway, kind of the culmination of an entire lifestyle of worship.
[time=1726] What God was hoping in the Old Testament was that as people would cultivate their farms and love their wives and raise their children, they would do that every minute of it, every moment of every day with a heartfelt sense of gratitude to the true and living God for the very breath they would take, the very land they would cultivate, the food they would eat, the ones they would love.
[time=1743] It would all be a sense of under that sovereign protection and provision of God,
[time=1749] so it all culminated then, day in and day out, moment by moment acts of worship, and the presence of God would finally culminate in the offering of a specific thing, an animal to be burnt.
[time=1761] That's why Jesus quoted Deuteronomy 6 verses 4 and 5, "Hear, O Israel, the Lord, our God is one God, and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength." And that was to be the ongoing everyday practice of worship.
[time=1781] And those times were to be celebrated sometimes corporately as national feasts
[time=1787] would come on certain dates at certain times in certain places, and the overt, if you will, active worship would take place, and the offering would be made.
[time=1796] The danger that faces us is the same one that faced them and that they failed to more often than not.
[time=1802] They compartmentalized it, they segmented it, they detached it from their life.
[time=1807] In other words, that offering was no longer really representative of what was happening in their hearts and life day to day, moment by moment.
[time=1814] It was a show, it was a sham, it was hypocritical, it was merely ritual, it was external, it was devoid from the moment by moment stuff
[time=1824] that God was really looking for.
[time=1827] That's why He said to them, "My name is 5, I hate.
[time=1830] I reject your festivals.
[time=1832] I don't delight in your solemn assemblies, even though you offer to me burnt offerings and your grain offerings.
[time=1837] You know, I don't accept them, and I don't even look at the peace offerings of your fatlings.
[time=1841] Take away from me the noise of your songs.
[time=1844] I will not even listen to the sounds of your hearts." You see, what happens is when people like you and people like me stop worshiping God
[time=1854] on a day in, day out, moment by moment basis, living with hearts full of gratitude and a desire just to honor Him any way we can in every circumstance we find ourselves.
[time=1864] When we disenfranchise that stuff from the act of worship, God is annoyed by our worship.
[time=1871] He finds it irritating, it sickens Him, and He wishes it would stop all these beautiful songs we've sung this morning and what Scott played there on the piano.
[time=1880] You know, if that is separate and distinct from who we are, the rest of our lives,
[time=1886] then God says, "Please just stop it." I don't care how expert it is, I don't care how technically sound it is, I don't care if your grain offering is exactly like I prescribed in the book of Leviticus, that's really not the issue with me.
[time=1897] I want to know, is it reflective of your heart?
[time=1900] Is it really who you are?
[time=1902] Is it merely symbolic of the kind of worship you offer me day in and day out?
[time=1906] He said in Hosea, chapter 6, he said, "For your loyalty is like a morning cloud
[time=1913] and like the dew which goes away very early." You know, you make these promises to me.
[time=1919] You make these statements in the act of worship about how you're going to live for me and how you're going to honor me and how I am worthy of the best of your life.
[time=1928] But you know, it's like a cloud in the morning, it's like dew.
[time=1931] It doesn't stay long enough.
[time=1934] Before noon, all those commitments have disappeared, evaporated, and can be found no more.
[time=1939] And then he says this, "For I delight in loyalty rather than sacrifice and in the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings." What God calls for in us is this loyalty representative of an internal commitment,
[time=1955] hearts, minds, thinking processes, values, life choices that really worship him,
[time=1964] that really represent choices that are commensurate with who he is.
[time=1970] In Isaiah, he says, "Who requires of you this trampling of my courts?
[time=1977] Bring your worthless offerings no longer." In other words, you say, "Look, somehow you got this screwed up.
[time=1984] If you think for a minute that I'm requiring you to do this, if in fact what you're doing in the court offering your burnt offerings, offering your worship per se, if you think that I want that when it's not representative of the rest of your life, look, let's just call the whole thing off." In fact, he says, "I cannot," he says in Isaiah 1, "I cannot endure iniquity in the solemn assembly.
[time=2006] I am weary of bearing your hypocritical sacrifices."
[time=2012] He says, "So when you spread out your hands in prayer, you know what I'm going to do?
[time=2016] I'm going to hide my eyes from you." Though you multiply your prayers, I won't even listen.
[time=2021] I'm going to close my ears.
[time=2023] I want nothing to do with you.
[time=2025] When you treat me that way, and when you sow demeaned
[time=2031] what could be happening between us, count me out.
[time=2038] God wants you and God wants me to get up every morning with this cinnamon on our lips.
[time=2042] Psalm 95, come let us worship and bow down.
[time=2045] Let us kneel before the Lord our Maker, for He is our God and we are His people,
[time=2051] the people of His pasture and the sheep of His hand.
[time=2054] Much in echoing the phraseology of Roosevelt and his great charge to America,
[time=2060] God is saying to the industrialist, "As an industrialist, worship me."
[time=2068] Whatever that means, whatever decisions you're making that day, however you're treating the people that work for you, however you're pricing what you're selling, however you're distributing your profits, whatever it means to be an industrialist, do it as a worshipper and then come into my house and sing the songs and reaffirm and celebrate who you've been all week.
[time=2089] He's saying to the wage earner, you know, whatever it means to worship me as a wage earner,
[time=2097] as a person who kind of punches a clock and works from this time to this time and has some of the exciting things and some of the drudgery that's bound up in all of that, moment by moment as the wage earner, do me a favor, worship me in the midst of all that.
[time=2113] As a farmer, as a shoe, as a shopkeeper, as a trainman, as a doctor, as you work at the task for which you have been best fitted, do it from a heart that is worshiping me.
[time=2124] You know, it's really amazing.
[time=2128] As you read the rest of the Book of Romans, he never really, it's not like we all have to become missionaries.
[time=2134] It's not like we all have to give all of our money away.
[time=2136] It's not like we all have to spend every single moment of every single day telling everybody who doesn't know about Jesus, about Jesus.
[time=2142] He's not so much concerned that you and I stop functioning in the ways we do.
[time=2147] I mean, that's who he's made us to be.
[time=2149] We fit into society.
[time=2150] We make our contributions.
[time=2151] In fact, we make our greatest contributions to the Kingdom of God by being who we are, by being doctors and trainmen and shopkeepers and wage earners and industrialists.
[time=2159] He's not asking for us to become monks.
[time=2161] He's not asking for us to disappear into some desert, lonely place.
[time=2165] That's the opposite of what God wants.
[time=2168] God wants you to be who He has made you to be to fit into this community as He has designed you to fit into this community.
[time=2174] He just wants you to do it with a heart of worship.
[time=2177] Every single minute of every single day.
[time=2179] Now, when you track the worship language through the New Testament, there are some words that are key worship words.
[time=2184] Lutreo and Praskan, oh, there's a bunch of them.
[time=2187] I don't have time to prove it all to you this morning, but what you'll find is that God considers these following things worship.
[time=2192] In Romans 14, when you serve your brother in Christ, God calls it worship.
[time=2197] In Romans 15, when you share the gospel with an unsaved person, God calls it worship.
[time=2204] Romans 15, 16, it says ministering as a priest, the gospel that my offering of the Gentile might become acceptable.
[time=2211] That's pretty clear, isn't it?
[time=2213] When you and I get engaged in a conversation with an unsaved person, and we are ministers, we are priests and priests in the Old Testament, as you know, did offerings.
[time=2220] And what we are doing is we are offering that Gentile up that he might become acceptable to God through Christ.
[time=2228] In Ephesians 5, you know that everyday grind you and I have for obedience to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which we've been called to bring every thought captive, to pursue diligence, to pursue loving one another.
[time=2240] I mean, that whole thing that you and I do to walk in obedience before God, God calls the whole thing worship.
[time=2246] The whole thing is worship, Ephesians 5.
[time=2248] The word is pleasing, and that's a worship phrase, pleasing to God.
[time=2252] Hebrews 13, 15 makes the obvious point that we make a sacrifice of praise to God with our lips, giving thanks to his name.
[time=2261] Remember the folks in Romans chapter 1 who fell into all kinds of memorality and all kinds of sin and who were given over to the lust of the flesh and all that stuff.
[time=2268] You know what their big problem was?
[time=2269] Remember, they did not honor God or give thanks to God.
[time=2273] They didn't worship God with their lips, which of course would come from their hearts.
[time=2280] The Bible says that when you give to the poor, you give to your financial resources.
[time=2284] In other words, God basically says every single thing you do in all your life is a bunch of worship if your heart is right, if you're full of gratitude, if you're full of giving thanks, if you're full of honoring God in your heart, then no matter what you do, so long as it's obedient, you know, so long as it stays within the moral boundaries of Scripture, that is all the stuff of worship.
[time=2305] So what does God calling us to do?
[time=2307] What is He urging us to do?
[time=2309] You know, on a lifestyle worship, every moment of every day, every thought, every choice, every decision, every conversation, every task, as a spouse, as a parent, as a student, as a worker, as a friend, it's all done.
[time=2322] It's all offered.
[time=2324] It's all really done in the presence of God.
[time=2326] There's always two things going on inside your heart and mind.
[time=2329] There's what you're doing and there's who you're doing it for.
[time=2335] Before I leave this point, you know, when you step back from your life, just a little bit, and you take the time to ask yourself, you know, the big question is like, what am I doing?
[time=2346] What am I really doing?
[time=2347] I know what I do for a living, but what am I doing?
[time=2350] And where am I going?
[time=2352] What brings substance?
[time=2353] What brings purpose?
[time=2354] What brings meaning to my life?
[time=2358] And there's a lot of things that you put in the answer category there.
[time=2362] But there's one that God knows is the ultimate answer that must fill that place in your heart or you will never, ever, ever learn to live.
[time=2371] It'll always be wrong with you.
[time=2373] It'll always be missing.
[time=2374] It will always be out of whack.
[time=2378] And the answer to that is, you know why I live?
[time=2380] You know where I'm going?
[time=2381] Do you know what I do today?
[time=2382] I worship God.
[time=2386] In the privacy of my own heart, through all the thoughts, the choices, the decisions, the conversations, the tasks, in all my roles, man, I'm just a living, I'm just a living, walking, offering.
[time=2400] To God.
[time=2404] Now the second question that he answers is why?
[time=2409] Why?
[time=2410] Why is God calling us to be living sacrifices?
[time=2414] You know, in the speech by Roosevelt, he answered that question very clearly, didn't he?
[time=2418] He said there are some international immoralitys going on around here.
[time=2422] There's a bunch of gangsters that are making war on the whole human race and they threaten our future, they threaten our nation, they threaten our freedom.
[time=2433] He was calling a nation to war because if that nation didn't go to war, things were going to change tremendously.
[time=2439] The whole world would change tremendously.
[time=2441] He was right.
[time=2445] Look at verse 1, and you're going to find a completely different level of motivation going on in verse 1 than what is common and typical.
[time=2453] Chapter 12, verse 1, I urge you, therefore, brethren, here it is, "By the mercies of God." The basis of Paul's appeal is in the phrase, "By the mercies of God."
[time=2467] I love it.
[time=2469] You and I both know that if we were threatened right now, physically, physically threatened, we would rise up and defend ourselves.
[time=2476] That's part of who we are. It's one of the strongest motivations that God has given people.
[time=2482] But when God moves to this level, when God begins to pursue you and me for lifestyle worship,
[time=2489] He does not threaten us.
[time=2491] He does not try to motivate us by the fear of loss.
[time=2496] He does not say to us, I urge you, therefore, brethren, because if you don't, Satan will win.
[time=2502] Satan's already lost. Christ is taken care of that. He is fully and thoroughly defeated at the cross.
[time=2506] Now, he doesn't know that yet, and he's still running around like he's got a chance, but that game is over.
[time=2511] Here's what he doesn't say, "I urge you, therefore, brethren, because if you don't, you'll lose your salvation."
[time=2517] No, he doesn't do that. He's already covered that in spades.
[time=2520] Remember Romans chapter 5 said, "There's no possible way you can ever lose your salvation." Romans chapter 80 came back and said it a completely different way through the ministry of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2529] "There is no threat in this verse. There is no coercion in this verse.
[time=2534] There is no sense of you had better do this or else." And then it was not there. Why? That's not worship.
[time=2544] That's survival. That's self-preservation. That's about me.
[time=2549] It's about what I want to keep. It's about what I need. It's about the kind of country I want to live in.
[time=2555] That's not worship.
[time=2558] Let me show you what worship is.
[time=2561] "I urge you, therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God." Now what does he mean?
[time=2567] He is summoning all that he has taught us so far in the book of Romans.
[time=2572] That God has been merciful to us.
[time=2575] That you and I began in Romans 1, 2, and 3 rightfully under the wrath of God.
[time=2581] That was our just desserts for our sin. That was the best thing, the most proper thing.
[time=2585] The righteous thing for us was the wrath of God and we were under it.
[time=2589] Temporally and bound to it eternally apart from chapter 3, the very righteousness of God coming into our lives through the sacrifice of Christ.
[time=2598] By the mercies of God.
[time=2601] And how did you get this great prize?
[time=2603] The righteousness of God based upon the merit of Christ. Did you work for it? Did you earn it? No.
[time=2608] Romans 4. Just put your faith in a God that saves people who cry out and trust only in Christ and His death and His resurrection.
[time=2617] And what did you get in addition to the prize of the righteousness of God?
[time=2621] Romans 5, you got peace with God. Romans 6, you got freedom from the power of sin.
[time=2626] Romans 8, you got the whole ministry of the Holy Spirit flooding into your life to ensure that forever you'll be with God.
[time=2634] You hear any threats? There's no threats.
[time=2638] Any coercion? No coercion.
[time=2643] It just sounds like a normal natural response that ought to flow out of our hearts
[time=2650] because of the goodness of God.
[time=2654] God, you have done so much for me.
[time=2658] God, you are the one who took the form of human flesh and lived on a sin cursed earth and was misunderstood by every human being that you ever saw or met or encountered. None of them worshiped him the way he was due.
[time=2671] You bore my sins. You became sin.
[time=2674] But I might become the righteousness.
[time=2677] Wow.
[time=2680] Now out of that, what is worship? Worship is gratitude.
[time=2684] Out of gratitude for all that God has already done and already provided and already promised and already secured for all of our lives and for all of eternity.
[time=2697] By the mercies of God.
[time=2699] Now see, that makes this whole thing really worship.
[time=2704] Because he wants us to be moved in our hearts and our minds
[time=2710] to exercise our free will as image bearers of God and say based upon this incredible God and the incredible thing that he has done, I now pledge my whole life.
[time=2724] Every moment of every day.
[time=2727] Not out of fear or threat that Satan will win.
[time=2729] Not out of fear or threat that I'll lose my salvation.
[time=2731] Not out of fear or threat that God will discipline me.
[time=2733] Not out of fear or threat that my life will fall apart.
[time=2737] And response.
[time=2739] Thinking, reasoned, logical response.
[time=2743] Heart felt, heart moved, heart impassioned response to how good God really is and to how good he's been to us.
[time=2751] So how do I do that?
[time=2753] That's the third major deal.
[time=2756] And that is answered in verse two.
[time=2758] Look at this, he says.
[time=2760] Do not be conformed to this world.
[time=2765] But be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.
[time=2774] A couple of key thoughts that tell us how we're saying.
[time=2778] You know, how do I get there, Russell?
[time=2781] And I say to myself, how are you ever going to get there, Russell?
[time=2783] Because the fact of the matter is, I don't do this.
[time=2785] I don't do this.
[time=2786] I don't live every moment of every day.
[time=2788] Every thought, every decision.
[time=2790] It truly is not captivated by this sense of gratitude to all that God has done.
[time=2795] It is not easy.
[time=2797] It is not without sacrifice.
[time=2799] And that's why the whole urging comes from the imagery of trying to get troops to go do something that they, well, frankly, would rather not do.
[time=2807] Risk their lives on the battlefront.
[time=2809] Why?
[time=2810] You know, how do I do this really hard thing, which in fact shouldn't be hard, but because I am who I am, it is hard.
[time=2818] He tells us, number one, do not be conformed to this world.
[time=2821] I love this.
[time=2823] When you and I, the word conformed, means it's an acting word and it means to take a pose that is not yourself.
[time=2830] You know how an actor may be happy that day, but if the part calls for sadness, man, boom, sad, that's called being conformed.
[time=2838] It is not a one-to-one relationship to who we really are.
[time=2843] Now, what the Bible is telling you is that when you and I act like the world acts, when you and I live like the world lives, we are not really acting like who we really are.
[time=2855] We're taking a pose.
[time=2857] You say why?
[time=2858] Remember now, in the process of getting saved, God transforms our nature.
[time=2863] Remember that stuff back in Romans 6 and Romans 7, when Paul cries out, he says, you know, I joyfully concur with the law of God and the inner man.
[time=2871] He's got to, he's saying, you know what?
[time=2872] I really am different now that I'm saved.
[time=2875] There's a fundamental difference inside my heart that marks me because of what God did at the moment of salvation.
[time=2882] I'm a different human being with different longings, different aspirations, different passions.
[time=2888] The true ontological change has occurred in the regeneration process of salvation.
[time=2894] And that's why when Paul writes this, he says, look, when you do what the world does, you are acting like something other than what you really are.
[time=2905] Stop it.
[time=2907] Don't take poses that don't represent the real you.
[time=2916] In other words, don't sacrifice your life for anything less than God.
[time=2922] You know the real cause.
[time=2924] You know the real being.
[time=2926] You know the real one, the only one who is really worthy of sacrificing your life for.
[time=2932] Don't offer it on any other altar.
[time=2934] It's not really you.
[time=2938] The Old Testament, they'd run after Baal.
[time=2940] They'd run after Astoroth.
[time=2942] And what they wanted was, they wanted what they wanted.
[time=2945] They'd reversed it again.
[time=2946] And they'd turned God into a cosmic genie who they could hopefully manipulate so that he would solve all their problems.
[time=2953] That is world worship.
[time=2955] That is how the world worships.
[time=2958] I don't care what the name of the religion.
[time=2960] I don't care what decade or what century you find it.
[time=2963] Whenever human beings worship their gods, they are in fact worshiping themselves.
[time=2967] They are trying to gain control of the uncontrollable through an image they have created so they can get what they want.
[time=2976] And the Scripture is saying don't go there.
[time=2980] You know that this whole thing is so much better than that.
[time=2985] You know how empty that kind of stuff is.
[time=2988] Whether you call it religion or just pure selfishness.
[time=2991] You know the dead end, call the sack of living for yourself.
[time=2996] Don't begin to pose in a way that isn't really you.
[time=3004] He says instead be transformed.
[time=3006] That is a great word.
[time=3007] See it there?
[time=3008] Do not be conformed to this world in the next phrase, but be transformed.
[time=3012] Metamorphous.
[time=3014] Happens to polywogs.
[time=3016] And it happens to Christians.
[time=3019] It is when you grow into what you already are.
[time=3024] Fair?
[time=3025] God has made you something wonderful at the point of salvation.
[time=3028] He has made you a partaker of the divine nature.
[time=3030] He has made you a new creature.
[time=3032] He has given you new desires, new heart, new aspiration, new understanding, new insight.
[time=3037] And yet you're stuck at this immature embryonic level.
[time=3042] And so you trip and you fall and you stumble and you worship like the world worships.
[time=3045] And you even do that with God.
[time=3046] You try to get God to give you the things you want.
[time=3049] So you can be happy or so to speak.
[time=3052] He says no, no, no.
[time=3053] You've got to metamorphous.
[time=3054] You've got to continue to grow.
[time=3058] You've got to continue to transform into people who don't worship and who don't act and who don't want like the world.
[time=3070] Learn how to begin to change and learn how to worship God.
[time=3074] And in so doing, let go of your demands on God.
[time=3077] Let go of that quiet barter system you have going with him and the bribes.
[time=3081] And if you will do this, then I will do this.
[time=3083] Or if I will do this, then will you do that?
[time=3089] Based on the mercies of God, he says let go of conditional worship and grow or transform or morph into a no strings attached, already grateful.
[time=3099] Just let me say thanks, worship her.
[time=3103] That sounds nice, doesn't it?
[time=3104] I wish that was me.
[time=3105] No strings attached, already grateful.
[time=3107] Just let me say thanks, worship her, in every dimension of my life.
[time=3112] You saved me, you redeemed me, you're transforming me.
[time=3117] My eternity is secure.
[time=3119] My life is better than it ever ought to have been in the first place.
[time=3122] You know, I'm grateful, God, I'm just really grateful now.
[time=3125] The question I'm asking you today isn't what can you do for me, but how can I serve you?
[time=3132] It says, you know, continue to change that way.
[time=3135] Continue to change that way.
[time=3139] And say, how do I do that?
[time=3142] The next phrase answers the question.
[time=3144] Buy the renewing of your mind.
[time=3149] What is he saying?
[time=3150] Change the way you think.
[time=3153] You and I fall victim to one of the great lies of all time, and I tell it to myself, and you tell it to yourself.
[time=3159] And it comes out in different ways.
[time=3161] This is just the way I am.
[time=3165] I don't want to do that because that's not really who I am.
[time=3168] There may be something God wants you to do.
[time=3170] And the lie is this, that we don't get to decide who we are.
[time=3174] The lie is that we don't get to choose our thoughts and our values.
[time=3179] And as soon as you believe the lie, that you don't get to choose your thoughts and your values, that you're not really a self-aware, image-bearing person who can step outside, say, these are my values, these are my thoughts, they're wrong.
[time=3190] I need to change them, step back in and change them.
[time=3193] As soon as you believe that's not true of you and you can't do that, then you're right, that's just the way you are.
[time=3199] And you will not metamorphists.
[time=3201] You will not transform because it all happens in the renewing of your mind.
[time=3206] Well, let me get this.
[time=3207] If you don't give financially, if you don't give financially the way you should, because you love money, or you feel entitled to a higher standard of living than you are now experiencing, and so giving money away is defeating what you feel entitled to have, and what certainly God is working on your behalf to ensure.
[time=3227] If you don't give money the way you should, because you have a tremendous fear in your heart of the future, you have security issues, what this text says is, wait a minute, time out, change the way you think.
[time=3238] Understand that the love of money is the root of all evil, and those who pursue it have pierced themselves with mini-asara.
[time=3245] Understand those of you who think that you're entitled to a higher standard of living that the Scripture says with food and clothing, that you should be content.
[time=3253] That's it, food and clothing.
[time=3255] Everything above that is already a higher standard of living than what you and I are entitled to.
[time=3260] Regardless of how our parents lived or how our friends now live, it's hard, isn't it?
[time=3264] No, I got changed the way I think.
[time=3266] I changed my values.
[time=3267] I got to renew my mind.
[time=3268] Here's the truth.
[time=3269] The truth is with food and clothing, I've got more than I deserve.
[time=3272] I'm to be content.
[time=3275] For those of you struggling with money issues and fear of the future and security issues, you know Jesus said it back there in the mouth, Sermon on the mountain.
[time=3282] He says, "You know, look at the birds.
[time=3283] They don't sow, they don't reap, they got no barns." My father takes care of them.
[time=3290] Yeah, it's easy to say and hard to do.
[time=3292] Russell, I agree.
[time=3293] I agree.
[time=3295] It's hard work.
[time=3296] That's why he's urging us to go to battle.
[time=3298] That's why this isn't some Mamcy Pamsy little suggestion.
[time=3301] I mean, he knows the gravity of what he is saying when he calls you and I to take an honest look at how we think wrongly that leads us there to stagnation so we are conformed and we don't live the way.
[time=3313] God, it's hard.
[time=3315] That's the call.
[time=3319] For example, if we don't evangelize the way we should, maybe because we don't care about lost people or because we don't want to be contaminated by lost people or because we don't feel adequate to minister to lost people.
[time=3328] Change the way you think.
[time=3329] The Bible doesn't say give into that.
[time=3331] The Bible doesn't say make excuses for that.
[time=3333] The Bible doesn't say stagnate right there.
[time=3335] The Bible says, okay, now change.
[time=3337] Metamorphists.
[time=3338] Grow into what you really are.
[time=3340] Well, what am I really?
[time=3342] I'm a person who has been so loved by God that when I read Luke 15 and I see the parable of the lost coin, the lost sheep, and the lost son, whoa, people matter to God.
[time=3354] Whatever else is mattering to me more than lost people, now let me think that one through.
[time=3359] What is it that I think is more important to me than lost people?
[time=3361] Change that.
[time=3364] Change your mind, renew your mind.
[time=3368] I don't want to be contaminated by lost people, right?
[time=3370] So read the New Testament and watch Jesus go get contaminated over and over and over and over and over and over again with the tax collectors, the sinners.
[time=3378] Of course, he was never contaminated, was he?
[time=3380] But from somebody's perspective, he might have been, but he wasn't.
[time=3383] In fact, he said, that's why I came.
[time=3384] Sick people need doctors.
[time=3386] Well, people, they're fine.
[time=3387] I'm going to go with the sick.
[time=3392] Don't feel adequate.
[time=3393] Well, I understand.
[time=3395] I understand.
[time=3397] Don't feel like I understand.
[time=3399] So to Paul, when I'm weak, then I'm strong.
[time=3403] He calls us to understand what it is in our thinking and our values and our priorities that keep us from metamorphizing, from changing, from transforming into more fully living sacrifice to God.
[time=3416] And it's hard, but we've got to do it.
[time=3418] Now, I've got to get out of here.
[time=3419] Last phrase, look at this, that you may prove what the will of God is.
[time=3424] This is amazing.
[time=3425] I love this.
[time=3426] See, God just treats us like adults because we are.
[time=3429] That you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good, and accept the word prove means to approve after testing.
[time=3436] And what he is saying is, look, you don't have to take it for me on this one.
[time=3439] You go ahead and you take some steps out there in the transformation mode, renewing your mind and being a little more sacrificial, being a little more worshipful with your life, and you find out for yourself if it isn't good and acceptable and perfect, the will of God.
[time=3453] He's saying, would you, it's a process, right?
[time=3457] And he's saying, wherever you are today, I'm challenging to take a little bigger step next time on one of those issues in your life, and I think you'll find, he says.
[time=3464] I think after testing me, after experiencing it, I think you'll find that the will of God for your life is really good.
[time=3472] It really is acceptable, and it really is perfect.
[time=3475] And on the basis of that experimentation, take another step, continue to change and continue to morphize.
[time=3482] It's an exciting thing.
[time=3489] The Apostle Paul, like many, many, many commanders in days past, summons you to present your bodies a living in holy sacrifice
[time=3500] every minute of every day doing what you do for the glory of God, hearts full of gratitude and lips full of praise.
[time=3506] He says, then, don't be conformed.
[time=3508] To this world, be transformed how, by the renewing of your mind.
[time=3511] Why should I do all this stuff?
[time=3513] There's no fear here, perfect love casts out fear, and that's not worship anyway.
[time=3520] Do it because of his mercy.
[time=3523] Do it because of what he's already done on your behalf.
[time=3527] Let's pray.
