[time=449] [MUSIC - 195 seconds]
[time=664] [APPLAUSE]
[time=670] Your mother-in-law is controlling, demanding, vindictive woman who for the last 20 years has been doing
[time=677] everything in her power to drive painful friction wedges into your relationship with your husband and your children.
[time=683] Her latest attempt just surfaced in a conniving manipulative 30-minute phone conversation with her son, your husband, in which she worked him over until he finally changed the long-awaited just-us family summer canoe trip vacation plans to a week at Grandma's house in Toledo.
[time=701] Your anger explodes into a tirade as you rant and rave against your husband for his spineless response.
[time=708] And you promise him that under no circumstances will you be spending a week at this evil woman's house?
[time=715] The next day, feeling trapped and alone, you begin to ask yourself, "What would Jesus do?"
[time=725] One of your co-workers who is newer to the firm than you are and far less dedicated than you are, but obviously more gifted, just got the promotion you've had in your sights for three and a half years.
[time=737] You sarcastically compliment him on his success, but the truth is you wish you would fall deathly ill,
[time=743] suffer a major heart attack or just drop dead, whichever comes first.
[time=748] You go from his office to everyone who will listen, undermining him, the promotion process and the firm.
[time=755] In a quieter moment, feeling rejected and frightened, a question forms in your mind.
[time=763] What would Jesus do?
[time=768] It's 2.30 a.m. and you're suddenly awakened from a deep sleep by your teenage daughter who is standing,
[time=774] terrified at your bed, telling you there was a man staring at her through her bedroom window.
[time=780] You fly out of bed, out the door and into the backyard, the shadow of his body glides over the back fence and you stand screaming into the darkness, a threat to kill him, followed by warnings that he never, ever do it again.
[time=794] Hours later, as the adrenaline rush subsides, you ask yourself.
[time=802] What would Jesus do?
[time=805] This morning we have the privilege of continuing in our series, "What Would Jesus Do?" I want to give my thanks to Beth Armstrong and Dave Burwell and Kelly Bird for the incredible support and contributions already to this series.
[time=818] The question "What Would Jesus Do?" is more than a fad, it's more than a gimmick to sell bracelets.
[time=824] It strikes at the heart of what it means to be a Christian.
[time=831] In Ephesians chapter 5, it says this, "Therefore be imitators of God, love, just as Christ also loved you."
[time=840] In Philippians 2 it says this, "Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus."
[time=847] Paul says it this way in 1 Corinthians 11, "Be imitators of me just as I also am of Christ."
[time=855] In John 13 verses 14 and 15 Christ said it this way, "If I then the Lord and the teacher wash your feet,
[time=863] you also ought to wash one another's feet, for I gave you an example that you should do as I did to you."
[time=875] What would Jesus do?
[time=878] In fact, in our study of the book of Romans we found out in chapter 8 that this is the central destination
[time=884] of every single person who ever gives their life to Christ.
[time=888] It says there that God, whom he foreknew, he also predestined, and here it is, to become conformed to the image of his son.
[time=898] This question strikes at the very core of God's decreed plan and purpose for each and every one of us to become like Christ.
[time=910] It applies to every area of our lives, what would Jesus do?
[time=915] We've asked that question in our personal lives, what would Jesus do?
[time=919] We've asked that question inside our relationships within the church, what would Jesus do?
[time=924] This morning, in our second and final installment, we asked the question what would Jesus do outside the church,
[time=931] and more particularly what would Jesus do in the crossfire?
[time=936] What would Jesus do when under persecution?
[time=940] At the most threatening points in our lives, when people are pursuing us to harm us, the question is this,
[time=948] when self-preservation flies and the sense of survival comes to the top of our consciousness,
[time=954] and all that stuff kicks in, what would Jesus do?
[time=960] In 1 Peter chapter 2, 21, yet another verse calling us to be like Christ says this, "For you have been called for this purpose since Christ also suffered for you,
[time=971] leaving you an example for you to follow in his footsteps." We ask ourselves what would Jesus do in our personal lives inside the church, outside the church, and particularly this morning when suffering persecution, when another seeks to do you harm?
[time=988] If you have a Bible with you, we're following Romans chapter 12 and the passage which provoked this question in our minds
[time=995] as it has been popularized, but the essence and the contents of this text seem to force the personality of Christ into our minds,
[time=1003] in verses 9 to 21.
[time=1007] We've already looked last week at verses 9 to 13 and this morning we'll finish by trying to understand,
[time=1013] you know, how do you handle persecution?
[time=1016] How would Jesus handle persecution verses 14 to 21?
[time=1020] The text will help us answer this question, what would Jesus do at three different levels?
[time=1024] First of all, the attitude of Christ in the crossfire.
[time=1028] We're going to go internal and ask questions about the hard attitude of Christ and of us amidst suffering.
[time=1034] Then secondly, the text will help us with the associates of Christ in the crossfire.
[time=1039] And then thirdly, the actions of Christ in the crossfire.
[time=1044] Number one, then the attitude of Christ amidst persecution.
[time=1048] Let me read you, verses 14 and 15, follow along.
[time=1052] Bless those who persecute you, bless and curse not.
[time=1057] Rejoice with those who rejoice and weep with those who weep.
[time=1063] The word persecution there in the text is diaco in the Greek.
[time=1066] It means this, to pursue someone with intent to do them harm.
[time=1075] You and I live in a country of great religious freedom.
[time=1077] It's unlikely, although we have questions, that we will ever in our lifetime be beaten or imprisoned
[time=1083] because of our religious convictions, our tendency to follow Christ.
[time=1089] But there are others who would pursue us to do us harm.
[time=1093] When I say the phrase, "Pursue to do you harm," does anyone come to your mind?
[time=1097] An annoying, nitpicking neighbor who turns you into the homeowners association or the city for not cutting your lawn appropriately or for misplacing your garbage cans.
[time=1107] A persistent, relentless gossip at work who seeks to undermine you and your performance and your reputation.
[time=1114] A calculating, vicious, former spouse who finds great joy in using and abusing the kids
[time=1120] as the last avenue to aggravate and hurt you.
[time=1123] Anybody out there pursuing you to do you harm.
[time=1126] This text is the text that teaches you how to respond, teaches me how to respond.
[time=1135] It is an attitude. Look at verse 14, "Bless them, don't curse them."
[time=1141] In other words, "Bless" does not mean to stand over them or near them and act like you're a priest and do the name of the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit and all that stuff.
[time=1149] It means this, to wish them the best, the one who persecutes you, the one who is pursuing you to harm you. In your heart, we are called to be like Christ
[time=1160] in that we would wish the best on them.
[time=1163] We would wish that God would pour out His goodness and His grace on their life.
[time=1169] Not so much to lead them to repentance so that they can come and ask you forgiveness for what they've done.
[time=1173] It's much bigger than how they might be treating you in the future.
[time=1176] You're just genuinely in your heart. See the condition of that persecutor and his lostness or his confusion or whatever is going on in the heart and mind of the person who is seeking to do you harm and out of that rises up well springs of compassion by which you ask God to bless them,
[time=1193] to enhance their life.
[time=1198] Wish that God would pour out His goodness on them. It's the attitude of Christ on the cross.
[time=1202] It's the attitude of Stephen before he too was martyred and died at the hands of angry men and each of them seeking the forgiveness of God upon those who were taking their life.
[time=1216] Been gone a little bit recently and one of the reasons was to be in California to do a funeral for my aunt, my dad's sister. It's a beautiful ceremony afterwards we went to her place of,
[time=1225] former place of residence, to her condominium and we had a little son Bobby in the place had a pool and so Heidi, you know, got Bobby in his little suit and my sister and I, my wife, and Bobby kind of went on down to the pool and found when we got there that the pool area was locked.
[time=1240] And rather than make the long trek back to my aunt's, former aunt's, the ceased aunt's place get the key come all the way back, well there was a low place in this little wrought iron fence and so we kind of stepped over it and got in and Bobby was having a great time.
[time=1253] We were sitting there enjoying the sun, relaxing and enjoying some memories of our aunt.
[time=1258] And you could see this guy coming a mile away. He had an attitude that would never end.
[time=1262] And you know the kind of person I'm talking about. He didn't have to open his mouth and you knew he had a bad attitude. And he comes to the gate with his key and he opens the gate and he says across the pool to us in this bombastic tone, now do you know why I'm opening the gate? No?
[time=1281] Well, it's so you can leave.
[time=1287] And I'm like, you know, I'm going to roast this guy.
[time=1293] Now why would that be that we need to leave?
[time=1296] Well, it's obvious you are trespassing here, we saw you climb over the fence, you have no right being in this pool area. And then I lost it.
[time=1306] I didn't yell on screen, but it allowed preacher's voice.
[time=1313] I said, you know, I don't appreciate the condescending tone you're addressing me in.
[time=1322] As a matter of fact, we do belong here. My aunt just died.
[time=1328] How am I doing?
[time=1331] We didn't want to take the time to walk and get the key.
[time=1334] And I didn't say this part, but it was in my heart.
[time=1336] So why do you just shut your mouth, shut the gate and get the fat out of here?
[time=1342] I just powered up on the guy. I humiliated him.
[time=1347] And I knew I was going to do it before I did it.
[time=1351] Now listen to the rest of 1 Peter chapter 2. Christ, Christ, while suffering it says,
[time=1357] committed no sin, nor was any deceit found in his mouth.
[time=1362] And while being reviled, he did not revile in return while suffering.
[time=1367] He uttered no threats, but kept entrusting himself to God.
[time=1371] Who judges righteously.
[time=1376] You know what? Somehow, because of the power of Christ in our lives, we're supposed to have the resources to look at a bad attitude individual
[time=1385] who presumes me guilty before finding out that I'm actually innocent.
[time=1392] Have the resources to absorb even that minor amount of persecution.
[time=1397] And look instead from a heart that says, you know, I don't know why he has that incredibly bad attitude and approaches people in such an abrasive way, but it's probably because he's got some spiritual needs in his life.
[time=1409] And I'm not going to contribute to those.
[time=1412] How about I bless this man?
[time=1414] How about I graciously get up, walk over, cover his sin, explain to him the situation in private.
[time=1421] Restore his dignity.
[time=1424] How about I bless him rather than curse him?
[time=1433] The next verse in verse 15 says, "Rejoice with those who rejoice and weep with those who weep."
[time=1440] This is an amazing evidence of this resource I'm talking about that we have in Christ that we need to appropriate.
[time=1448] It's rejoicing with those who rejoice. Most of us struggle, I think, with when other people get the promotion we thought we should have or get the house or get the car or get the break or get the benefit or get the finally the boyfriend that leads to the husband, get the child finally after you.
[time=1463] When they get the thing that really thrills their soul, there's a lot of us who struggle with a sense of jealousy,
[time=1470] a sense of envy, a sense of comparison, and the attitude of Christ, even with those out in the world who may be persecuting us, is when they get a break, when their hopes come true, we're able to truly rejoice with those who rejoice.
[time=1485] We somehow lose ourselves and our comparative disadvantage in what has God has chosen to do in their life
[time=1491] and we get genuinely excited about it.
[time=1496] And then it says that we are able to weep with those who weep.
[time=1500] And here again, at least for me, the struggle that I have when people are sorrowful and in trouble is
[time=1508] unless they are pure victims in the situation, if they've had any agency at all, if they've contributed all to their plight,
[time=1514] that leads them to weep and be sorry for their circumstances.
[time=1517] My mind tends to run in a very calculating way instead to a fault finding this is your problem,
[time=1523] this is the thing you made your bed, you lie in it, and I detach myself to a certain degree from their plight.
[time=1532] That's not how Jesus lived. That's not how we're destined to be. That is not what Jesus would do.
[time=1538] Jesus, of course, as you know him in his life, as he's recorded in the Gospels, was very aware of people's responsibility for their own actions, was very aware for people reaping what they would sow.
[time=1550] But there was another side of Christ that was open-hearted, full of compassion, able to look past the contributions that person had made to their own plight.
[time=1560] And move, be moved, be moved to the place of tears.
[time=1568] So this notion of being like Christ in the crossfire starts internally.
[time=1573] There are certain attitudes that, as it always is with Christianity, it always starts from the heart.
[time=1579] But now we move to a second category, and it is the associates of Christ in the crossfire.
[time=1587] Do you know where these ugly, un-Christ-like responses come from in us when we want a curse instead of bless,
[time=1594] we want to be jealous instead of rejoicing, where we want to be callous and distancing instead of weeping and involved?
[time=1601] Do you know where that comes from inside of us? It is an inflated ego.
[time=1607] We think too much of ourselves, and therefore we think we have a right to be treated by people in a certain way
[time=1615] or to receive a certain amount of blessings from God, to be insulated from a certain amount of pain and sorrow.
[time=1620] We just think too highly of ourselves.
[time=1627] When we are persecuted, it is that we shouldn't have to be treated by somebody like you.
[time=1634] I'm too much. I'm too good. I'm too valuable. You have no right to treat me this way.
[time=1641] I deserve better, and I certainly don't deserve that.
[time=1645] When we curse, we curse the one who treats me in a way less than I think I ought to be treated.
[time=1652] When we bless the ones who treat us in a manner commensurate with the way we think, we ought to be treated.
[time=1665] Calamity. I'm not sorrowful, and I don't weep with people who weep.
[time=1671] I don't feel their pain because I'm too good and I'm too much about me to care about them at that level.
[time=1677] And if I do care about them at the level that I'm weeping for them as they weep over their situation, it just might imply my having to give up some time, some resources, and some energy to care for their needs.
[time=1688] Much safer, much more about me if I can just shut that stuff down.
[time=1694] Now look at verse 16, if you would, and you'll see what I'm trying to say here.
[time=1697] Be of the same mind towards one another.
[time=1702] That does not mean unity. That sounds familiar to some unity texts about believers in the church.
[time=1707] This context is about how you treat people who are persecuting you, how you live with people outside the church.
[time=1712] What this means is, be of the same mind, which means do not be a respecter of persons.
[time=1718] Do not value people one above the other. Be of the same mind toward everybody.
[time=1724] Then it says in verse 16, do not be haughty in mind, or proud or arrogant.
[time=1730] Then it says, but associate with the lowly, and finally the verse says, do not be wise in your own estimation.
[time=1736] In other words, three times, be of the same mind towards everybody, which means no respecter of persons fail to see the distinctions. You're all a bunch of sinners.
[time=1744] Do not be haughty in mind, and do not be wise in your own estimation.
[time=1748] In other words, have a low estimation of yourself, or have an accurate estimation of yourself.
[time=1756] We are vile, wretched, selfish sinners saved by the grace of God, and what we really deserve is hell.
[time=1764] That's where I'm supposed to be right now. I am in absentia.
[time=1768] I am missing from where I belong at this moment based upon my sinfulness and my selfishness.
[time=1774] But for the grace of God, I am not there. I am here, which leads me to be treated by you in a certain manner.
[time=1783] Now, I strive for balance in this concept with you.
[time=1786] We are not to let people walk all over us, and abuse us, and violate us, and then write it off as though,
[time=1792] and justify it all in some less than healthy, dysfunctional way by saying, you know what, I really deserve this hell. I mean, treatment you give me isn't as bad as hell, so just do whatever you want to.
[time=1801] No. We have value. We are image-bearers. We are loved by God.
[time=1806] And as such, we do set boundaries for people, and we do act with dignity.
[time=1810] And there are times when we stand for our rights, but with this verse and this context is trying to say to us is this.
[time=1817] When we are persecuted and we instinctively curse, rather than bless, it is because we have an inflated ego of ourselves.
[time=1825] When we cannot rejoice at another person's success or accomplishment, it is because we have an inflated view of what we deserve.
[time=1834] And when we cannot weep with those who weep, it is because we have an ego problem.
[time=1840] That their situation and their calamity is somehow substantially and demonstratively different than what would be ours were we in their case.
[time=1848] Because I promise you, if you change places with the person who is weeping, you will think everybody in the world ought to weep with you.
[time=1858] Do not be, verse 16, a respecter of persons. Do not think there are certain categories of people and you are among the better.
[time=1865] Do not be haughty in your own mind as you think about yourself. Do not be wise in your own estimation.
[time=1874] Now the litmus of verse 16, the litmus of verse 16 are these associates. Do you see them there? The middle of the verse, but associate with the lowly.
[time=1883] Associate, it means to be carried along with, to be swept away by as if by a flood, so that you eventually give yourself up to the lowly.
[time=1896] Be thinking of yourself without the haughty-ness of mind and without being too wise in your own estimation that you not only have contact with the lowly,
[time=1908] but you associate with them to the degree that you are carried along with them, you are swept away by them and you eventually give yourself up to them.
[time=1919] As did Christ. Philippians 2, who although he existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped.
[time=1928] I mean, he was God. He is God. Reaching for God wasn't a reach.
[time=1934] But he emptied himself taking the form of a bondservant being made in the likeness of men he humbled himself. He humbled himself.
[time=1946] The reason Christ could bless those who persecute him and not curse them. The reason that he could rejoice with the people in Kaina and make the wedding wine.
[time=1955] The reason he could weep outside the grave of Lazarus with those who were weeping is because he had humbled himself.
[time=1963] He associated with us, didn't he? How much? He associated by coming here, taking the form of human flesh.
[time=1970] I mean, he got so carried away with us, he became one of us.
[time=1976] In all ways, but for the sin.
[time=1981] It's a tough standard, isn't it?
[time=1986] What would Jesus do sometimes? Sounds like a delightful answer to a difficult problem and other times it is the problem because it is so demanding.
[time=1997] I mean, it is so selfless.
[time=2002] Number three, the actions, the actions of Christ in the crossfire.
[time=2009] Now these remaining verses, I want to pull just four things at them for you, four little actions.
[time=2015] Number one is found in verse 17.
[time=2018] Never pay back evil for evil to anyone. Any questions about that? What didn't you understand about the word "no"?
[time=2025] Never pay back evil for evil to anyone. Respect what is right in the sight of all men.
[time=2034] Now the Bible says that murders and thieves and purgers and rapists and abusers need to be punished.
[time=2043] They need to be put to death, some of them, others of them need to be put in prison, but that is a responsibility that is given to the government.
[time=2049] And we're going to get to that in Romans 13.
[time=2051] We're going to talk about the God ordained government and the way that God brings wrath on the evil doer.
[time=2057] It is never the prerogative. In anywhere in the scripture it is never the prerogative of the individual to exact his own revenge.
[time=2068] No, action number one is no personal revenge.
[time=2074] You and I, as we deal with our enemies, seek to protect ourselves from bodily harm the word of God gives us that.
[time=2082] We can seek to protect our reputations with hearts that are right before God.
[time=2086] We can seek to protect our personal property from those who would want to take it away from us, but never ever ever motivated by personal revenge.
[time=2093] There is never the situation where we go beyond protecting what is ours and our responsibility to protect to this extra measure of punch that we're going to give the person who is our enemy or who persecuted us or who threatened our financial well-being.
[time=2109] No personal revenge.
[time=2112] The second thing you'll find in verse 18.
[time=2115] If possible so far as it depends on you, be at peace with all men.
[time=2120] The second action is to seek peaceful solutions.
[time=2124] Seek peaceful solutions.
[time=2130] A soft answer turns away wrath, right?
[time=2133] My bombastic calloused cursing of this individual at the pool excited his instability and he said even worse things to me after I responded to him sinfully as I did.
[time=2148] Seek peaceful solutions.
[time=2151] Now it's important that you know the first two words of the verse if possible because it's not always possible.
[time=2156] You and I know there are people who for whatever reasons and no matter how we treat them are not going to be at peace with us.
[time=2162] Because it's not even an issue about us at some point it's just an issue about them.
[time=2165] And it's not that you and I are supposed to give up truth and give up integrity and give up what is right.
[time=2172] We made, not truth as in biblical truth, we may choose to be maligned.
[time=2177] We may choose to take the short end of the stick for the sake of peace.
[time=2181] We are never called to give up the truth of God's word for peace.
[time=2187] Never called to compromise for truth.
[time=2191] Never, excuse me, compromise the truth for peace but to seek peace.
[time=2196] It's a delicate, very, very delicate.
[time=2198] If you've been in any situations at all you know it's a very delicate thing but God is saying in your heart into the best of your ability seek peaceful solutions.
[time=2207] Number three is found in verse 19 and it is this.
[time=2214] Never take your own revenge beloved but leave room for the wrath of God for his written vengeance is mine I will repay says the Lord.
[time=2226] Leave room for the wrath of God is behavior number three leave room for the wrath of God.
[time=2231] Realize that God will by no means leave the guilty unpunished.
[time=2237] Now we already know from the beginning of the passage that our heart is not for them to be punished.
[time=2241] Our heart is for them to be blessed by God and redeemed by God and saved by God and then to be given all the blessings he could possibly give to any human being.
[time=2248] That's our heart. That's our attitude.
[time=2251] But there is a sense that God has built within us well what about justice?
[time=2255] What if I don't exact my own revenge and what if the government is an able or doesn't wish to or in this particular period of history doesn't exact?
[time=2264] Where does justice live?
[time=2267] Well verse 19 says rest yourself in this you just refuse your own revenge and leave room for what God will do.
[time=2275] God is a just exacting judge.
[time=2278] He will settle the account if need be.
[time=2283] Now then there's this last one number four out of verse 20.
[time=2289] And this is the really hard one it's it says this but if your enemy is hungry feed him
[time=2295] and if he is thirsty give him a drink.
[time=2298] For instance doing you will keep burning coals upon his head.
[time=2302] Now the burning coal metaphor has been somewhat misunderstood and I don't claim to have the absolute truth on this but my best understanding of this is shame.
[time=2309] In this culture when a man or a woman would do something obviously wrong and outside of cultural boundaries and wanted to repent publicly they would carry around on their head burning coals.
[time=2319] And it was their open unmitigated statement of their shame and their repentance for what they had done.
[time=2327] If your enemy is hungry feed him and if he is thirsty give him a drink.
[time=2331] For instance doing you will he burning coals upon his head and I believe in the flow of this text obviously we recognize that people most often come to Christ out of a deep sense of conviction of their sin.
[time=2342] Even this is restorative this is not a vindictive spiteful helping of the enemy.
[time=2347] This is a gracious compassionate full-hearted longing for their salvation and you respond to them and their persecution by helping administering in the hopes that the shame will eventually open their eyes their need for Christ the only one who can take away shame.
[time=2366] So the attitude what would Jesus do to the one who is persecuting me the one who is seeking to do me harm.
[time=2376] And who are the associates of Christ in the crossfire I mean how do I view myself and how does that work out and who I pay attention to and associate with and esteem myself.
[time=2388] The actions that he would have me do well never take your own revenge no personal revenge seek peaceful solutions leave room for the wrath of God help minister to your enemy.
[time=2407] You know this is exciting isn't it to come here on Sunday morning and to worship like this and not to go through routines and rituals.
[time=2420] We don't come here for that we come here to engage our hearts with the true living God and to the best of our ability say to him you know whatever you want whatever is lacking whatever is missing whatever is short in my dedication
[time=2436] to you today man I want to make it I want to make it up I'm not make it up in the sense you'll keep me safe not make it up and just I just don't want to be short I don't want to be deficient I just want to come read and list recommit
[time=2448] resubmit.
[time=2452] Do you have any enemies I guess what I'm asking you do you have any enemies do you have a mother-in-law that isn't an enemy.
[time=2459] Mine is a great ally do you have somebody at work do you have a sister or a brother I mean do you have any enemies out there people that have been or are pursuing to do you harm in one category of another and the question is do you want to be like Christ.
[time=2476] You know what would Jesus do and I confess I stand before this stuff as much a sinner as anybody else and I'm terrified by what they call me to do here.
[time=2486] But I think like you there's something inside your heart that says you know that's truth I mean that is the way that I'm supposed to live that will make me whole that will make me a high integrity individual.
[time=2503] I want to take a stab at that I might need some help some practical wisdom help I need some accountability help you know I really need to get that thing straight.
[time=2514] I've been harboring it too long and the issues are too big and the estrangement is too wide and we've been going through a really interesting scary situation as our family.
[time=2525] We just last week had our fourth encounter with a peeping Tom and that little vignette I read at the beginning of the teenage girl standing terrified at her father's bed at 2 30 in the morning was my daughter and me.
[time=2538] And I did run out and I did threaten and I did give warnings.
[time=2544] You know for some reason whatever it is going on there.
[time=2549] We're being kind of in that sense persecuted we're being pursued for harm because it's terrifying my family and me and feel restricted and doors got locked and drinks got to be pulled and the you know the funnest the freedom of life that we so get to enjoy here in America that I think a lot of people in other parts will never get to enjoy.
[time=2568] It's kind of been robbed in a way.
[time=2574] After that first encounter when I ran out there and screamed and yelled lost my voice and couldn't preach.
[time=2578] That's by the way where my voice went.
[time=2583] And the adrenaline rush began to subside you begin to say you know what how what do you do how do you protect and take care of what is yours to take care of.
[time=2594] And at the same time how do you have a heart of compassion and commitment to bless to actually bless and wish from the core of your being that this person would you know.
[time=2613] Well as I was working this morning on this text and I finally came to this last point help minister to your enemy I the spirit of God I think began to say to me now how are you going to minister to this guy.
[time=2621] I mean you've been spent a lot of time thinking how to call the police and have all the reports you've had reported and learn all you can about this subject and take all the precautions you can with lights and shades and even think about how to catch the guy and you've spent a lot of time about that.
[time=2634] How much time have you given thinking about how to minister to this individual.
[time=2640] So as I was sitting there I thought you know what I need to do and I just wrote this this morning I said I need to hang a note right by his favorite window.
[time=2649] Because I got that thing lit up like day and he still comes.
[time=2654] But I'll just hang him a note.
[time=2656] I'll say this dear peeping Tom.
[time=2662] That's the first draft so if you get any ideas talk to me after the service.
[time=2665] It goes this way please please seek the help you need to overcome this compulsion to look in other people's windows.
[time=2671] A compulsion right.
[time=2672] I don't think you I mean what's going on in that head.
[time=2675] What makes you want to get out of bed at two in the morning and come look in some high school girls window who's asleep for crying out loud.
[time=2681] And find ways to wake her up and scare her and stare at her and what was that.
[time=2687] How many times you have to go out at two thirty the night before you get a situation that suits all those criteria so you go home feeling fulfilled if that's what fulfills you.
[time=2694] I mean what a what a deal.
[time=2697] Please seek the help you need to overcome this compulsion to look into other people's windows because he's been doing it people down the street he's been doing it over there been hearing about it.
[time=2706] Then I say the second paragraph you are of great value to God.
[time=2712] And therefore to us.
[time=2716] I don't think you're lurking in the shadows and terrifying high school girls is God's plan for your life.
[time=2725] I might want to change that God's highest use.
[time=2728] You know I'm trying to instill look there's a better way to live.
[time=2733] Last paragraph and this has only been true in the last couple of days.
[time=2736] I have been praying that God will bless you first with a personal relationship with Christ.
[time=2742] And second with a high integrity fulfilling life.
[time=2749] Now I wanted to add something in there see here verse 20 offer to feed offer to give a drink.
[time=2755] I wanted to say and I would be willing I wanted to put some in there about helping pay for counseling even and our family we will help pay.
[time=2761] But I thought you know he's going to read that he's going to think oh that's it I'm supposed to come tell myself you know identify ask for counseling then you call the police then I'm dead.
[time=2767] I didn't know how to say that without making him feel like I was trying to get a hold of him.
[time=2775] So I got to take this home talk to Heidi and the kids and see if they're up for that.
[time=2779] Any steps you need to take?
[time=2783] What would Jesus do?
[time=2785] If he were you and he had your enemy.
[time=2788] Man what a central question.
[time=2790] What an absolutely central heart core of the matter issue.
[time=2796] Now look at verse 21.
[time=2799] Says do not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good.
[time=2804] That's really the issue isn't it.
[time=2806] Is evil which is present ever present all over everywhere in you out of you everywhere is evil going to win the word overcome the word Nike victory who wins the evil or the good in your life.
[time=2823] When we when we bless the enemy instead of curse then we win.
[time=2829] But we may not see them justice we may not be able to you know beat the living daylights out of him we may not see them have to restore what they've taken but when we bless instead of curse we Nike we overcome we win good wins in our life.
[time=2845] When we humble ourselves as we are called upon to in verse 16 and not be wise in our own estimation and let that humbling process draw us to a regular association being carried and swept away with by the lowly.
[time=2862] We win we don't lose we win.
[time=2869] And when we can manage an action response that is not revenge that is a peaceful solution that leaves room for the wrath of God and ministers to the enemy we win.
[time=2886] Now seeing a lot of our hearts that feels like losing because winning is wrongly defined as having the upper hand being proven right having the other person admit we were right.
[time=2897] I don't see it here.
[time=2899] I don't think has anything to do necessarily with winning or losing good and evil.
[time=2905] Now there's a question that just screams out at us from this text.
[time=2909] I mean there's a question that just begs to be asked.
[time=2912] At least in my mind and the question is this you come through this text and see how you're supposed to treat the enemy and you got to ask yourself this question what about me right.
[time=2921] What about me who takes care of me in this whole thing.
[time=2928] I want to change the little phrase from what would Jesus do to what has Jesus done and there's your answer.
[time=2937] God has in Christ so fully cared for all of our needs and made promises to care for all of our needs that we need not worry about those.
[time=2947] And that what he said in the sermon on the Mount.
[time=2950] Hey listen you let me worry about how you get taken care of.
[time=2955] You give yourself to the seeking of the kingdom of God.
[time=2960] I'll handle the other stuff.
[time=2963] What has Jesus done he has forgiven us for all of our sins past, present and future.
[time=2968] What has Jesus done he has appeased the wrath of God that was focused on our lives because of our sin gone.
[time=2976] He has made us joint this is such an amazing thought especially in the context.
[time=2980] He has made us joint heirs you know what that means that he has freely given us full ownership of everything that was his.
[time=2988] You want to talk about trying to bless an enemy rejoice with those rejoice with those weep.
[time=2993] I mean Christ gave wretched filthy enemies sinners like you and me he gave us full participation in everything that he owns.
[time=3003] And he owns everything.
[time=3007] What about me I know I know I feel the same thing what about me no no no what has Jesus done.
[time=3017] Our needs are so fully and emply and totally filled.
[time=3025] In Ephesians Paul prays over and over for the Ephesian saints he says that Christ would draw on your hearts through faith and that you now listen to this.
[time=3031] That you being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and the length and the height and the depth of what the love of Christ.
[time=3041] In order for you and I think to walk this path in Romans where we treat our enemies this way we have to be so grounded and so secure in the height and the breadth and the depth of the love of God that we're able to give away things like this.
[time=3059] And let's take a minute close with this song.
[time=3072] Sometimes I can say all the wrong words sometimes I can think of only me I know that my pride can hire the tenders.
[time=3090] The longs to show I came may I do his love for you may I lift your eyes toward heaven may I come to you and lead you to his light.
[time=3115] May I cry his tears before may I be the place that you can run to where you'll hear his voice and see him in my eyes.
[time=3135] All your life may I be his love.
[time=3150] I want to live my life for his glory and to hold his word here in my heart to let us know and hold you every part of me so I'll live my life.
[time=3175] May I be his love may I lift your eyes toward heaven may I come to you and lead you to his light.
[time=3195] May I cry his tears before may I be the place that you can run to where you'll hear his voice and see him in my eyes.
[time=3215] All your life may I be his love and I know that only when I follow him can I begin to love.
[time=3245] May I be his tears for you may I be the place that you can run to where you'll hear his voice and see him in my eyes.
[time=3269] All your life may I be his love.
[time=3285] May I pray I'll be his love.
[time=3300] In this very room, there's quite enough joy for one like me and in this very room,
[time=3328] there's quite enough love for one like me and there's quite enough hope and quite enough power to chase away any good.

[time=3468] And there's quite enough hope and quite enough power to chase away any good.
