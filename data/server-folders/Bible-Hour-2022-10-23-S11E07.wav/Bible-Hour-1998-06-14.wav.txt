[time=30] What does Romans chapter 13 verse 1 say?
[time=47] Let every person be in subjection to the governing authorities.
[time=55] Now the rest of this passage, which we'll study this morning down through verse 7, explains why to be subject and it explains how to be subject.
[time=65] But the truth of this passage is this, let every person be subject to the governing authority.
[time=81] This is the Sunday morning worship service of Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=84] Thank you for joining us.
[time=86] Today, Pastor Moore continues his study in the book of Romans.
[time=89] We hope you'll stay tuned.
[time=90] Now let's join our service.
[time=99] [MUSIC - 280 seconds]
[time=401] [APPLAUSE]
[time=408] But I will sing of your strength.
[time=410] In the morning, I will sing of your love.
[time=412] For you are my fortress, my refuge in times of trouble.
[time=417] O my strength, I will sing praise to you.
[time=420] You, O God, are my fortress, my loving God.
[time=425] As we gather as God's people, that's our main purpose for Sunday morning, to corporately give God praise and acknowledge that he's our fortress, lift up our voices and praise to him, our audience of one.
[time=439] Let's all stand together, lift up our voices together and give Hallelujah, Hallelujah to the Lamb.
[time=445] [MUSIC - 228 seconds]

[time=838] [MUSIC - 251 seconds]
[time=1099] Try this one on for size. It's 1776 and you, like many of your friends, are getting sick and tired of being governed and taxed by a king and his parliament and ocean away who refuses you representation.
[time=1118] Taxation without representation has become not only a way of explaining what is wrong these days in the colonies, but a call to arms.
[time=1128] For nearly six years now, the revolutionary attitude of the Boston Tea Party has been sweeping the colonies.
[time=1134] Finally, the pent-up hostilities can be controlled no longer, and the shot fired in lexicon massachusetts is heard around the world.
[time=1142] The revolution is on.
[time=1145] As you bid your wife and kids farewell and pick up your musket balls and powder, who are you going to fight with?
[time=1157] The revolutionaries?
[time=1160] Or the king?
[time=1163] Well, as we ponder answers to these questions, I invite you to rise above your own political opinions, your background, and anything you may have learned so far about patriotism and open your Bible to Romans chapter 13.
[time=1179] We will assume as we begin this discussion that you are a believer, that you have been saved by the grace of God to the sacrificial death of his son Jesus Christ.
[time=1189] We will assume at the outset of this discussion that you have in your heart the intention to honor God with your life.
[time=1196] You have read Romans chapter 12 verses 1 and 2, and you would be the living sacrifice wholly and acceptable to God that God would have you be.
[time=1206] And we would assume this morning that you will interpret your sacrificial offering of your life not upon your traditions or what you may have learned in human history.
[time=1216] You will determine that upon the truth of God's Word. In your heart, God's Word is an errance.
[time=1222] It is the beginning and the end of truth, so far as God would have you live as a living sacrifice.
[time=1228] So you look only to his Word and exclusively to his Word to understand his interpretation of what it looks like to be a living and holy sacrifice.
[time=1242] What does Romans chapter 13 verse 1 say?
[time=1247] Let every person be in subjection to the governing authorities.
[time=1255] Now the rest of this passage will truly study this morning down through verse 7 explains why to be subject and it explains how to be subject.
[time=1265] But the truth of this passage is this, let every person be subject to the governing authorities.
[time=1273] If you have a Bible with you this morning and you'd like to, although we'll have it on the screen for you, the second major instruction that comes to believers in the New Testament about their response and role and relationship the government is found in 1 Timothy chapter 2 and it says this.
[time=1287] First of all then, I urge that in treaties and prayers and petitions and thanksgivings be made on behalf of all men.
[time=1296] For kings and for all who are in authority, in order that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity.
[time=1306] This is good and acceptable in the sight of God who desires all men to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth.
[time=1314] There you have it my friends.
[time=1316] There are other verses in the New Testament that talk about the government, but that basically is the sum total of everything that Christ would have you know about how you are to respond to your governing authority.
[time=1328] First, be subject to them. Secondly, pray for them. Why? That you may lead a tranquil and quiet life. Why?
[time=1338] Because that is good and acceptable in the sight of God.
[time=1341] And what kind of God is he a God who desires all men to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth?
[time=1348] You can add some answerly passages like Titus 3, which say this, remind them, speaking to believers, to be subject to rulers,
[time=1357] to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good deed.
[time=1362] Now watch, to malign no one, to be uncontentious, gentle, showing consideration for all men.
[time=1372] That is how we are to fill our heart and our mouth and our deeds in response to the rulers and authorities.
[time=1378] Malign no one.
[time=1382] We could add 1 Thessalonians chapter 4, make it your ambition to lead a quiet life and attend to your own business
[time=1390] and work with your hands just as we have commanded you so that you may behave properly towards outsiders and not to be in any need.
[time=1399] What does God say to the Christian who has a desire to honor God with his life by being a living sacrifice?
[time=1405] How does God interpret that into the venue of our response to government?
[time=1411] Very simply it is this, be subject, it means to rank under, it means to obey them.
[time=1418] Now that does not mean that, as I know you are thinking, we are talking about revolutions this morning, and if your government calls you to war, they have been given, as you'll note this morning in this passage, the power of the sword, and if they enlist you, you go and you fight.
[time=1432] But in terms of a revolution, in terms of insurrection, in terms of an overthrow, a violent overthrow,
[time=1439] be subject to the governing authorities, and secondly, pray for them, not necessarily pray for economic stability,
[time=1449] not for personal freedoms even, pray for tranquility, pray that the government that is in power will cause peace to fall upon the land
[time=1457] so that you can go about the business of the Great Commission because God is a good God wishing that none should perish but all should come to eternal life.
[time=1466] Now there's one exception to these two basic principles, and it is this, any law or command that would require disobedience,
[time=1473] any law or command of a government that would require you directly, you, to disobey God's word,
[time=1480] then you like the midwives in the book of Exodus back in the land of Egypt when Pharaoh was requiring of them to kill the male children,
[time=1490] you like the midwives refused to do that.
[time=1493] And you like Daniel of old who was instructed never to pray, you refuse to do that, you go ahead and pray.
[time=1502] And you, Shadrach, Meshach and Abindigo, who are called to bow down to the golden image in idolatrous worship, you refuse to do that.
[time=1511] Why? Because God has said clearly in the New Testament that you obey Caesar for the things of Caesar and you obey God for the things of God,
[time=1519] and God is ultimately your authority, and where your government and your God cause you to clash, you obey your God.
[time=1529] But, please understand that like Daniel who disobeyed the government and then did it openly and then took the punishment that that government gave him,
[time=1541] he went into the lion's den, and Shadrach, Meshach and Abindigo, before they were thrown into the fiery furnace,
[time=1547] said in their great confession that our God is able to deliver us, and even if he does not, O King Nebuchadnezzar, we will not bow down,
[time=1556] and there is with this personal disobedience to the civil authorities based upon the authority of God's word the willingness to suffer the consequences that will be meted by that government.
[time=1567] So yes, we disobey, we disobey when the government asks us personally to disobey the word of God,
[time=1573] and instead doing we know the consequences of that disobedience will be ours, and we will take them.
[time=1579] Then you say, no, wait a minute. Does this kind of teaching 2,000 years ago relate to the kinds of governments we know of today,
[time=1587] Saddam Hussein in particular, or as an example?
[time=1592] I would remind you that the Roman government, the government that was in rule, while the New Testament was being written,
[time=1598] new horrors that Saddam Hussein hadn't even dreamed of yet.
[time=1604] Because in the Roman government there was personal ownership of human beings as though they were nothing but a bench or a piano or a piece of carpet.
[time=1615] No personal or humane rights, no dignity owned or granted to a slave, there were nothing more than an ox at best.
[time=1625] As a result, three slaves to every Roman citizen at its peak in Roman's history, those people could be sold or bought, they could be sexually mistreated, anything goes.
[time=1637] They could be killed on the spot, and the slave owner need give no explanation other than I wanted to.
[time=1644] Yes, my friends, God knew exactly the level of corruption to which government could fall when he wrote this text through the hand of Paul.
[time=1654] The conquered people of Rome were little more than property.
[time=1659] They had no voice in government, they had very little, if any, legal representation had they been taken advantage of,
[time=1665] and the Jews, like the other conquered people, chafed under that Roman rule.
[time=1670] And under that chafing there grew a sect, a group of people called the zealots, Jewish people who chafed under the Roman rule.
[time=1679] Now these zealots, based upon Old Testament passages which were taken out of context, refused to pay their taxes to Caesar.
[time=1687] So they stopped paying their taxes, and they engaged in terrorist activity, many of them becoming assassins and taking the lives of their rulers.
[time=1696] Roman rule was harsh, and the Jewish attitude of insurrection was rapidly expanding, and it eventually went in the Jerusalem Holocaust of AD 70,
[time=1707] to which the city and its temple were utterly destroyed, and some 1.1 million Jewish people were slaughtered mercilessly there by the Romans
[time=1715] to squelch this insurrectionist attitude, men, women, and children, including priests.
[time=1722] You see, now wait a minute.
[time=1725] I mean, as we look down through history, we've got to ask the question, isn't there a better way to order society than government?
[time=1731] We look at governments down through history, and we see non-stop corruption, non-stop self-interest, non-stop abuse of the masses, illegitimate power-wielding, isn't there another way?
[time=1743] Well, the answer to that originally was yes.
[time=1747] God instituted a theocracy over Israel, where God himself was king, and there was no king between God, and the people for God himself was king.
[time=1756] And as a result, when Israel went to war, they went to war knowing that the ever true and living God had decreed at a just war, and so they fought.
[time=1765] And when God as king provided for taxation, they knew that tax rate or amount was exactly what it ought to have been because God, not human legislators, set the amount, a theocracy.
[time=1778] When laws and justice were enacted in terms of personal problems, and murder, and thievery, and rape, and all those things, when the laws about that stuff,
[time=1788] and the consequent penalties that came with those came directly from the hand of God and so the people could rest in knowing that those were the right laws and the right punishments for crime.
[time=1800] The welfare plan was established directly by God.
[time=1803] There was no bickering arguing or discussing whether too much in aid was given to the needy or too little.
[time=1808] God had covered it, but the people didn't like it.
[time=1812] They said in 1 Samuel 8, now a point for us, a king, to judge us like all the other nations.
[time=1817] They said, "We don't want God for our king. We want a human being to rule over us."
[time=1824] And God said to his prophet at that time who was lamenting their choice of a human feeling that he himself, Samuel, had been rejected.
[time=1830] God said this, "For they have not rejected you, Samuel, but they have rejected me from being king over them."
[time=1837] And in the same passage for Samuel 8 verses 11 and following, God tells them this about their choice.
[time=1842] He says this, "This will be the procedure of the king who will reign over you.
[time=1846] He will take your sons and place them for himself and his chariots and among his horsemen and they will run before his chariots."
[time=1852] And he will appoint for himself commanders of thousands out of fifties and some to do his plowing and to reap his harvest and to make his weapons of war and equipment for his chariots.
[time=1861] And he will also take your daughters for perfumers and cooks and bakers and he will take the best of your fields and your vineyards and your olive groves and give them to his servants.
[time=1871] And he will take a tenth of your seed and your vineyards and give those to his officers and to his servants.
[time=1877] He will also take your male servants and your female servants and your best young and men and your donkeys and use them for his work.
[time=1883] And he will take a tenth of your flock and you yourselves will become his servants.
[time=1889] It's no surprise to God, the injustice of human government.
[time=1894] It was not his original plan. Plan A was a theocracy. That was rejected.
[time=1899] Plan B is what you and I live with and what everybody else has lived with and throughout history.
[time=1906] And though God's original plan, Plan A was a theocracy to rule directly.
[time=1911] And he will again, as you know, your scriptures rule directly in the millennium, but for now, now listen to this.
[time=1917] But for now, God is still committed to organization and structure in society.
[time=1925] And even though human governments are Plan B, he still loves people enough to want them to live in a stable and just society.
[time=1934] And that takes us back to government, human government, and that takes us back to our response to human government in Romans 13.
[time=1946] Now in Romans 13, you're going to learn beyond this basic overarching principle to be subject to the governing authorities.
[time=1955] And again, that's in the context of Romans 12. What does it mean to be a living and holy sacrifice?
[time=1960] We learned that part of what it means to truly worship God is having a right relationship to civil government.
[time=1969] That begins with subjection and then he will, this morning we'll look at three points that he'll surface. Let's look at the first one.
[time=1976] And these will appear on the screen. You can write these down if you want. Here's what Paul says to you.
[time=1980] Here's what it means to be in subjection. The first is a why. Why should I be in subjection?
[time=1984] Number one, respect your government because its authority ultimately comes from God.
[time=1992] Respect your government because its authority ultimately comes from God. Would you read verses 1 and 2 of chapter 13?
[time=2001] Let every person be in subjection to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God.
[time=2009] And those which exist are established by God, verse 2. Therefore, he who resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God.
[time=2020] That's pretty clear. Therefore, he who resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves.
[time=2031] You see, here's the common tendency and problem in the human heart when it comes to submitting to a government.
[time=2039] We begin to put our focus on the human agent involved in government. We look at Saddam Hussein.
[time=2047] The revolutionaries looked at the king and his parliament.
[time=2051] We look at the current ruling presidents. His political views are either too conservative or too liberal.
[time=2059] He's different than we are on abortion or on gays or on the size and role of government.
[time=2064] The particular leader may have questionable character and we begin to focus in on that man and the senate and the house and the Supreme Court
[time=2073] and the laws that are disseminated and to the degree to which they differ from our personal opinions about these issues.
[time=2079] We either feel compelled to submit or not to submit. That is wrong.
[time=2085] That is not the basis of our submission to authority.
[time=2089] That is not the basis of our honoring and paying taxes and rendering customs to our government.
[time=2095] It has nothing to do with the individuals in office or their policies or the way they carry them out.
[time=2102] We end up saying, "I don't have to submit and I don't have to pay taxes and I don't have to pray for and I don't have to fear and I certainly don't have to honor."
[time=2111] Because I don't agree because the things they are doing are wrong and they may not even agree with scripture.
[time=2119] Well, it's not what the Bible tells you to hold in your heart towards your government.
[time=2123] It says this, verse 1, "Submit to your government not because you agree with it, applaud it, support it because of its theological beliefs
[time=2130] because of its foreign policy, because of its welfare policies.
[time=2134] Submit to it because there is no authority except from God." God put it there.
[time=2140] God put that government there and therefore you and I are called to submit to it as long as we are under it.
[time=2146] Now, it is possible to flee.
[time=2148] The scripture does not tell you you can't flee and get away from a government you don't like, but there is no room for you and I to be involved in a revolution against the existing government.
[time=2158] Why? Because God put it there and when God doesn't want it, He'll take it down.
[time=2162] It has nothing to do with personalities or programs or policies or laws.
[time=2168] It has nothing to do with any of that stuff.
[time=2170] It has everything to do with the fact that number one, God establishes government.
[time=2173] Do you realize that God has established Castro and Cuba?
[time=2176] Do you realize that God is the one who has established Sodom and Iraq?
[time=2179] Do you realize that God is the one who has put Clinton in the White House?
[time=2182] Do you realize that God is the one who had Hitler in Germany at the same time he had Churchill in England?
[time=2188] Do you realize that it was God who had Ceausescu in Czechoslovakia at the exact same time as he had Reagan in the United States?
[time=2196] God did it all. God does it all.
[time=2198] These are God's choices. These are God's people.
[time=2201] These are God's ministers to accomplish God's purposes in those people's lives at that particular era of history.
[time=2207] You say, why? Why would a gracious, loving, compassionate God ever put a guy like Hitler in power over the German people?
[time=2217] My answer is this, I don't know. I don't know. And the Bible doesn't tell us.
[time=2224] It says in Deuteronomy 29-29 that the secret things belong to God.
[time=2229] There are so many things that you and I don't know about God and His purposes and His plans.
[time=2234] And it is utterly arrogant for you and I to assume that we will obey the things in the Scripture that make sense to us.
[time=2241] Now, we are King, aren't we? We are God. We rule over the Scripture, and that is not how we approach the Scripture.
[time=2247] We submit to the Scriptures acknowledging there are many things about the character, the nature, the attributes, the program, and the plan of God that will utterly confound us.
[time=2258] Deuteronomy 29-29 again says the secret things belong to God.
[time=2261] Now, then it goes on and says this, the things revealed belong to us.
[time=2265] In other words, what is revealed and what we do understand, that belongs to us.
[time=2270] Why? The verse continues so that we may observe all the words of His law.
[time=2276] You and I get what we get and we are able with limited finite capacity to understand God and His Son and the Holy Spirit and His plan for the ages in a limited finite capacity.
[time=2287] And our knowledge is not given to us so that we can then take that knowledge and question Him.
[time=2292] Well, based upon what you've given me, I question you.
[time=2296] No.
[time=2297] By will never, ever, in titles and individuals to question the sovereign authority of God or His plan throughout history.
[time=2305] It is instead so that we might observe, that we might obey, that we might sub what submits.
[time=2311] And maybe, maybe the rebellion in people's hearts against governments is in reality a rebellion in their heart against the God who established the government
[time=2321] and their sick and tired ultimately of the God who would allow that kind of government to cause their living conditions to fall so substandard.
[time=2328] The rebellion may in fact be against the very God who established the order.
[time=2335] So, number one, under point one, is God establishes governments, now look at verse two for the second part of the reasoning.
[time=2342] And because God put that person in charge, therefore verse two, He who resists authority has opposed the very ordinance of God.
[time=2350] My friends, when you and I go against the governing authority, no matter which one, no matter where they are, no matter how bad they may be,
[time=2357] you need to understand you are going against the very ordinance of God.
[time=2362] And you are not taking down the forces of hell and evil. You are taking on God and His order.
[time=2368] Now, they may be instruments too of Satan, and they are corrupt, and they are vile, and they are wicked, and they do horrible things.
[time=2375] But God says, listen, here's your focus. You're focused to know, number one, I put them there, number two.
[time=2380] When you oppose them, you oppose me because I put them there.
[time=2388] One of the authors that writes in history about the experience of the Roman, I mean the believers in Roman days says this.
[time=2399] It was not consequential whether the Roman emperor was kind or good, whether he was a persecutor of Christians or a lover of Christians.
[time=2407] It was not consequential whether he was elected by the people, whether he was appointed by the Senate, or whether he took over in a military coup.
[time=2414] It was not consequential whether the assertion of imperial authority by Caesar was just or unjust, whether he was wicked or whether he was basically good.
[time=2423] None of that was consequential. It was simply and only that government, as it exists in any situation, is for the purpose of God in that situation.
[time=2431] And resistance and rebellion against that government is resistance and rebellion against God.
[time=2442] Wow. Talk about rethinking some things. Point number two. Point number two.
[time=2451] The text says this, respect your government because it is God's instrument to reward good and punish evil.
[time=2459] Respect your government because it is God's instrument to reward good and punish evil. That's found in verses three and five, they say this.
[time=2468] For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior, but for evil. Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what it's good, and you will have praise from the same.
[time=2478] For as a minister of God to you, for good. For if you do what is evil, be afraid. For it does not bear the sword for nothing.
[time=2485] For it is a minister of God and a avenger who brings wrath upon the one who practices evil.
[time=2492] Wherefore it is necessary to be in subjection not only because of wrath, but also because of conscience sake.
[time=2500] Now let's think this through. What is a government supposed to do? I mean, if God is the one that ordains them, what is the basic pattern?
[time=2509] Why does He put them in place? And the answer is this. A just government is one that rewards and encourages moral and righteous behavior from its citizens.
[time=2519] Likewise, a government is doing what God would intended to do when it rewards and encourages moral and righteous behavior from its citizens.
[time=2529] Likewise, a government is doing what God wants it to do when it disciplines, brings justice and retribution on its lawbreakers.
[time=2537] That basically is the, that's it. That's what God wants it to do.
[time=2542] And assuming that that kind of thing is enforced, and we know that that's not always the case, and we know of missionaries who did nothing wrong and who were persecuted simply because of their faith in Christ.
[time=2553] But on the whole, when a government is, when you evaluate a government, a government is good or bad, a government is as God would have it to be, whether it is not communistic, socialistic, a democracy, a monarchy.
[time=2565] That has, that the structure or the form has very little if anything to do with the subject. All he says is this, what I want a government to do is punish the evil and reward the good.
[time=2577] Government to restrain evil. Do you realize that it's safer right now on the streets at night in communist China than it is on the streets of Los Angeles at night?
[time=2588] Do you realize that they are doing a better job of what God intends a government to do, to punish the evil doer. They do that better than we do.
[time=2597] They are in that sense a better minister of God than we are. And you say, well, wait a minute now, communist, communist China and their overt atheism against God and their severe persecution and suppression of the truth.
[time=2613] My friends, do you realize that as the estimates are emerging out of communist China, there are said to be some 50 million believers in communist China and their faith is vibrant and strong and pure and righteous and holy.
[time=2628] And they are completely being conformed to the image of his son. And God does that regardless of the form of government. And sometimes God does that in an easier way when governments are oppressive.
[time=2640] It's an amazing thought, isn't it? Do you realize that the people of Russia know more about crime and pornography and drugs and corruption today than they ever did before the Iron Curtain came down?
[time=2653] I'm not advocating communism. I'm saying that the paradigm, the ultimate paradigm by which we must evaluate governments is not whether or not the citizenry is free or represented or has a vote or is in a democracy, the ultimate criteria by which God gives us
[time=2669] to evaluate government systems is whether or not they punish evil and reward good behavior.
[time=2676] That is the ultimate paradigm. We have other paradigms and we love our freedoms and we love our country and we are grateful as probably the most governmentally blessed in that sense to have freedom of all who have ever lived.
[time=2689] But don't confuse that temporary transcendent blessing with what God intends for government to be and to do.
[time=2699] The U.S. law is replete with the reinforcing of good behavior and the punishing of bad. At least it was. It's getting rewritten daily.
[time=2709] What do I mean? Take, for example, the institution of marriage. The American legal system so reinforced these couple of verses for most of its tenure.
[time=2718] How? Well, it upheld marriage. It rewarded people who did what God wanted them to do. A man and a woman, they get married, they live in a home and they have kids.
[time=2726] That's God's design. And our laws have reinforced that throughout most of our history.
[time=2730] How? Well, first of all, we defined marriage as a man and a woman. That's under attack.
[time=2736] Secondly, we upheld it by having very restrictive divorce laws. We wouldn't grant a divorce for any and every reason.
[time=2742] We tried as a government to respond to what God wanted to have done in terms of reinforcing good behavior and punishing evil behavior.
[time=2750] And illegitimate, unbiblical divorce is illegal. It is bad behavior. It is evil. It is not what God intends.
[time=2756] And so our laws would try to, try to hem that up. And there would be penalties for unbiblical divorce and there would be rewards for staying married, one of which are tax exemptions and interest on your homes, those kinds of things, and dependence.
[time=2770] Those are ways that government in non-violent, non-physical ways move in and our forces and ministers of God to reinforce what is good and to discourage what is evil.
[time=2782] Now, that is the real, that is the real crooks of it. Now, just for a second here, let me tell you a little bit about how things were when God was running the government in terms of punishing the evil doer.
[time=2797] And this is not an exhaustive study, but let me give you a couple of principles that come out of the Old Testament that it was like when God was king.
[time=2804] First of all, the punishment was public. Punishment was public.
[time=2808] You would get punished in front of your family, your friends, and the community. And that was for the purposes of deterrence.
[time=2816] You broke the law. You didn't disappear somewhere and get punished. You got punished right there in the middle of everybody for what you had done.
[time=2822] Secondly, it was just. The phrase in I for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, which is often aligned by people who don't understand the scripture, is nothing more than this.
[time=2829] You got to make the punishment fit the crime, and you can't over punish, and you can't under punish.
[time=2834] And so in I for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a leg for a leg, an arm for an arm, and however that verse goes.
[time=2838] But that was the basic concept. Make it just. No over punishment and no under punishment.
[time=2843] Number three, it was impartial. The law was blind. Like we have in our country, it's supposed to be blind. Why?
[time=2850] The blindfold is saying it doesn't matter if you're wealthy or poor. It doesn't matter if you're high or low social standing.
[time=2855] It doesn't matter if you have a position in the community or not. In fact, Deuteronomy 13, 6, warns against any type of partiality, even against family members, like sons and daughters, wives, close, close friends, and even yourself.
[time=2867] So it was public. It was just. In other words, the punishment fit the crime. It was impartial, and it was without delay.
[time=2874] The fourth one is it was without delay. Deuteronomy 25 envisions the scene, and the judge, it says, "shall make him lie down and be beaten in his presence."
[time=2882] The trial's gone. The witnesses are there. However, the system worked and finally the decision comes down.
[time=2887] He's guilty, and the punishment is whipping. Boom. Right now, right here, lay him over and do it. That's how it happened.
[time=2894] It was absolutely without delay. Ecclesiastes 8 has an interesting comment on that.
[time=2900] It says this, "Because the sentence against an evil doer is not executed quickly, therefore the hearts of the sons of men are given fully to evil."
[time=2912] God says, when he was king of the government, of course he is still king, that when you postpone the just proper punishment for sin, you may exact it, but when you let too much time go, it causes evil to grow in the hearts of those and society.
[time=2929] The fifth principle, there could be many more, but I'll give you a fifth. It was corporeal. It was physical. It was physical.
[time=2940] It was beating. It was lashes. It involved physical pain.
[time=2945] Excuse me, the point I wanted to make was that it was restorative. Point five is that it was restorative, and a component in that was that it was corporeal.
[time=2952] It involved beatings and lashings and whippings. Physical damage brought to the individual who took that stuff, and it was also restorative in the sense that if a theft had occurred, you made the thief pay back to the people he stole from.
[time=2967] There was a one-to-one accountability for what was taken and what was returned.
[time=2971] Do you know there are no prisons in the Old Testament in that industry? There is no prison system in the Old Testament.
[time=2979] If you committed a crime that was not for capital offense, and there were about 35 crimes you could be killed for in the nation of Israel under God's economy,
[time=2986] if you didn't do one of those and you were in the theft arena or something like that, what happened to you was, as I have said, you got punished publicly.
[time=2993] You got punished justly. You got punished impartially without delay, and you got punished in a restorative fashion so that you could pay back what was due.
[time=3001] You would be beaten physically for your offense, and it was over. It was highly restorative. You had paid truly your debt to society.
[time=3010] So the way a criminal was punished was not to stick him somewhere where he is off and of no earthly good to anyone for a long, long time.
[time=3018] But to give him the dignity of working with his hands, even as Ephesians says, let the one who steals still no longer, but work with his hands, that he might supply those in need, pay back what he has taken.
[time=3027] It was a restoration of dignity because the man could make a restitution. It was also physical, and it was bodily.
[time=3033] It was a matter of whipping and lashing so that pain came instantaneously, and shame was public, and now, and then it was over, and you went on with your life.
[time=3041] You paid with your punishment for your crime, and you went on with your life, and if you committed another crime, you went through the exact same cycle again, unless, of course, you commit a crime that's worthy of death, and then you were immediately and quickly put to death once your guilt was established.
[time=3055] It's an amazing system, isn't it?
[time=3058] And if you know anything about our criminal system, that's how it sort of used to kind of be around here.
[time=3064] And now our prisons are full and overflowing, and crime rates are rising as we systematically move away from what God says a government is supposed to do, which is to what?
[time=3075] Bring retribution and pain against the evil.
[time=3078] Bear the sword, which, by the way, is used for nothing other than to kill.
[time=3082] That is one of the strongest statements of Capitol punishment in the New Testament.
[time=3085] You don't do anything with a sword, except what? Kill.
[time=3088] That's what they're designed for.
[time=3092] So we've given up on all that stuff.
[time=3094] So, we respect the government.
[time=3097] We submit to the government, right?
[time=3099] Who it is, or what they're doing, we submit.
[time=3101] Why?
[time=3102] Because it is established by God.
[time=3104] Point number one.
[time=3106] Secondly, because they are designed to punish evil and reward good.
[time=3110] And even the worst sort of government does that.
[time=3115] No government.
[time=3116] Could you imagine a situation with no government?
[time=3119] Could you imagine where there's no ruling authority?
[time=3121] Absolute, total anarchy.
[time=3123] Have you ever heard of a government that rewards evil?
[time=3126] That rewards the rapist, the murderer, the thief among its citizenry?
[time=3130] Of course, when they get into power and absolute power corrupts absolutely and they do all that stuff and don't hold each other accountable.
[time=3135] But in terms of the citizenry, have you ever heard of a law of a land that rewards the rapist, the murderer, and the thief?
[time=3140] No, that's not what they do.
[time=3142] Even the worst forms of government punish evil.
[time=3145] And no people on the earth today would be better off today without their current government than if they had no government.
[time=3151] Because then all turmoil would break out.
[time=3154] Anarchy and terror would rule.
[time=3156] No one would be safe.
[time=3158] So plan B is plan B.
[time=3160] It's hard.
[time=3161] It's abusive.
[time=3162] It's not God's plan.
[time=3164] But we submit to it because God has authored it.
[time=3167] God has sanctioned it.
[time=3169] And we understand, thankfully, that it is much better than plan C, which would be no government at all.
[time=3175] Finally, the third point from this text is this.
[time=3178] Respect your government by paying your taxes and honoring the government.
[time=3184] Look at it in verses 6 and 7.
[time=3187] For because of this, you also pay taxes.
[time=3192] For rulers are servants of God, devoting themselves to this very thing.
[time=3198] Render to all what is due to them.
[time=3200] Tax to whom taxes do, custom to whom, custom fear to whom fear and honor to whom honor.
[time=3208] Now again, I'm not going to go into great length on this point for one amount of time and for two, the IRS is doing a super job.
[time=3215] Right?
[time=3216] They're running around all over the place and they have abuses and that system could be revised and hopefully it will be.
[time=3221] But the point is, you understand that because God established that power and has given that power,
[time=3227] the opportunity to tax, we pay and we need to pay and we need to pay in full and we need to pay as an act of worship.
[time=3234] That's the point.
[time=3235] Again, we cannot get our focus on the personality or the programs or the legislative process that goes through on that.
[time=3243] That is not for us.
[time=3245] I mean, we have votes and we have rights and being involved in government is great with Dan Coates and Dan Coel the other day.
[time=3252] We thank them both for the incredible job that they do and for serving us and our country and all that's wonderful.
[time=3258] I mean, we have privileges, civil, peaceful privileges that we need to be aggressively pursuing.
[time=3265] That's true.
[time=3267] But the same is also true.
[time=3270] We are called to pay our taxes because that government is established by God and if they love you to tax, we pay it and we don't pay it begrudgingly and we don't pay it.
[time=3278] Of course, in our hearts, there's a sense of my lands that could go to such better use.
[time=3282] I wish I could give this to God, but then you say, oh, the government is a minister of God, I guess it is.
[time=3287] It is serving his purposes, his civil purposes, which confound me totally in this day and age, but I trust him as a sovereign ruler of the universe.
[time=3297] Wouldn't it be great?
[time=3299] Wouldn't it be great if we had such a loose grip on our money
[time=3306] and our preferred standard of living and we could in our hearts actually have a sense of worship
[time=3312] when we pay our taxes?
[time=3315] That'd be a lot like Jesus, wouldn't it?
[time=3318] Then of course, he got his out of the mouth of a fish.
[time=3321] Well, let me write you to stand and we'll close in prayer.
[time=3330] I want you to know that I am a patriot, I do love America.
[time=3336] I sing the national anthem to put my hand over my heart.
[time=3342] If I was drafted to go to war, I would.
[time=3344] If my son was drafted to war, I would.
[time=3346] If my daughter was drafted to war, I'd tell him to go.
[time=3348] I'm not a pacifist.
[time=3350] I do not believe the Bible says you can't take a human life, that is not the issue.
[time=3354] If an intruder would come to my home and threaten my life and my family, I would take his life and I would take it without regret.
[time=3360] I may have afterthoughts, but I would take it instantly and completely to protect my family.
[time=3364] I'm not a pacifist and I'm not an anarchist.
[time=3366] I'm not a communist, I'm not a socialist.
[time=3369] But I'll tell you one thing.
[time=3371] Above all that stuff, I'm trying to be a biblicist.
[time=3373] What does the Bible say?
[time=3377] What does the Bible say about the revolution of 1776?
[time=3381] You were there and you got swept up in that little taxation without representation thing.
[time=3388] And you say, well, how could that be wrong?
[time=3390] I mean, look how God has used America.
[time=3392] Well, let me tell you something.
[time=3393] God is in the business of using sinful people and sinful choices to make good things.
[time=3397] That's what he does because that's what everybody's doing all around us, making sinful choices all the time.
[time=3401] God always can't take bad things and make them good.
[time=3404] You don't justify the means by the ends, right?
[time=3407] You look at Scripture and you say, what does the Bible say?
[time=3410] Now, hopefully, we'll never have to be in that situation.
[time=3413] I mean, hopefully, our lifetimes, we'll continue to enjoy these incredible freedoms.
[time=3417] But I want you to know, friends, that if we don't, this is what the Bible says.
[time=3423] This is our place of submission.
[time=3425] And we lead a quiet, tranquil life that's good and acceptable in the sight of God, a good and gracious God who longs for all to come to the knowledge of Christ.
[time=3435] Let's pray.
[time=3438] Heavenly Father, we come again to worship you and to submit our hearts to you.
[time=3442] And we love our country so much.
[time=3445] We get goosebumps when we sing some of our national songs and we think about some of our veterans
[time=3451] and we think about the great battles and we even sense you moving and orchestrating in our past.
[time=3456] And Lord, we don't understand all that.
[time=3459] We thank You and praise You for this great place called America.
[time=3462] But at the same time, Father, we will live in submission to Your Word.
[time=3467] And so we will submit to our government.
[time=3471] Unless, of course, they directly call us to disobey You and then we will disobey them and stand the consequence.
[time=3477] Help us, O God.
[time=3479] Help our country.
[time=3480] As we are called, we pray for our leaders.
[time=3482] We pray that You help them to do what You have called them to do, which is to reward good and punish evil.
[time=3489] We might live tranquil lives.
[time=3492] We love You and praise You.
[time=3493] We pray these things in Christ's name and all God's people say.
[time=3496] Amen. God bless you.
