[time=30] [MUSIC]
[time=48] This is the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=52] Thank you for joining us.
[time=54] Today Pastor Moore continues his study in the Book of Romans.
[time=57] We hope you'll stay tuned.
[time=58] Now let's join our service.
[time=60] [MUSIC - 231 seconds]
[time=310] [APPLAUSE]
[time=316] Listen to these words from George Washington, "No country upon earth ever had it more in its power to attain God's blessings.
[time=325] Much would be regretted where we did a part from the road which Providence has pointed us to so plainly.
[time=332] I cannot believe it will ever come to pass.
[time=335] The great governor of the universe has led us too long and too far to forsake us.
[time=341] And I hope and trust that there is good sense and virtue enough left to recover the right path."
[time=348] [MUSIC - 227 seconds]
[time=603] Let's pray together.
[time=606] Father, we take this time to pause and reflect upon the Providence that was so evident as our country was established.
[time=619] And to ask that you would show us the ancient path, show us the footsteps of Jesus, so that as our country moves toward the next century,
[time=631] that we might reestablish a connection with you, and that we might once again know the rest that only comes from you.
[time=643] [AMEN]
[time=645] [MUSIC]
[time=657] Our fathers built this land on the foundation of the world.
[time=663] They gave their lives for truth and liberty.
[time=669] Yet today there's something missing. We've pushed aside God's word.
[time=675] It seems we've lost our reason to believe.
[time=681] The banner's torn and tattered beneath the cloud of sin.
[time=687] And it's time we took America back to the cross again.
[time=693] We've got to love one another, stand together, fight this war no matter what the cost.
[time=705] We've got to pray for our children, and turn our hearts to heaven, and seek to be one nation under God.
[time=718] [MUSIC]
[time=722] We've bound to this world's idols. We have built our Babylon's.
[time=728] When will we see we're on a dead end cause?
[time=734] Where we used to stand amazed at the miracle of birth.
[time=740] But now it's nothing more than just a choice.
[time=746] You see the world is slowly dying, and the end is drawing here.
[time=752] But our only hope is Jesus. We've got to let the whole world hear.
[time=760] We've got to love one another, stand together, fight this war no matter what the cost.
[time=772] We've got to pray for our children, we've got to turn our hearts to heaven, and seek to be one nation under God.
[time=808] We've got to love one another, stand together, fight this war no matter what the cost.
[time=818] We've got to pray for our children, we've got to turn our hearts to heaven, and seek to be one nation under God.
[time=826] We've got to love one another, stand together, fight this war no matter what the cost.
[time=836] We've got to pray for our children, we've got to turn our hearts to heaven, and seek to be one nation under God.
[time=849] We've got to seek to be one nation under God, seek to be one nation under God.
[time=879] We've got to pray for our children, we've got to turn our hearts to heaven, and seek to be one nation under God.
[time=909] Make all things new, and the blessings of the land we love are really gifts from you.
[time=923] If my people will humbly pray, and seek my face and turn away from all their wicked ways, then I will hear them, and move my hand, and freely then will I forgive, and I will heal their land.
[time=954] Unite our hearts, and want to hold, and make us hungry for your peace, and burden for the poor, and grant us hope, that we might see a future for the land we love, our life, our liberty.
[time=983] If my people will humbly pray, and seek my face and turn away from all their wicked ways, then I will heal them, and move my hand, and freely then will I forgive, and I will heal their land.
[time=1038] And I will heal their land, heal their land, heal their land, heal their land.
[time=1068] Well let me invite you to open your Bible this morning to Romans 14, and we've been studying our way through the Book of Romans, and we come this morning, kind of in that chronological orderly way to Romans 14, and it just so happens that it's about Christian liberty, and that kind of goes with our patriotic theme this morning in a sense than the word that liberty is there, but it's not about being a Christian in a free land.
[time=1096] It's really about knowing how to live the life of liberty that Christ has given us in the spiritual dimension. Christian liberty, what do I mean by that?
[time=1107] There are some things in the Bible which are black and white. We're not supposed to lie, we're not supposed to cheat, we're not supposed to steal, we're not supposed to covet, there is no liberty on those issues.
[time=1118] It's not a matter of personal choice or preference where some Christians should feel free to do that, another shouldn't. It is categorically dismissed as sin, and it is to be extricated from our life.
[time=1128] Those are black and whites, and on some things, and many things, the Scripture is very, very clear, that would be sin, and those kinds of things hinder our walk with God, and we need to flee temptation and pursue holiness.
[time=1142] When we talk about Christian liberty, though, we don't talk about the clean black and white issues of sin that the Scripture delineates.
[time=1149] We are talking about certain kinds of behaviors or activities that God has not spoken in black and white terms. He has not said definitively that this is sin.
[time=1161] Some of these kinds of activities can be engaged in by certain Christians, and when they do those things, they feel as though they have sinned, even though God has not said they have sinned.
[time=1171] They feel guilt, and shame, and conviction.
[time=1175] Other Christians can do those same kinds of activities and feel absolutely no guilt, no conviction, and no sense of having sinned.
[time=1184] We call those gray areas. Let me show you a couple of them in this text. Look at verse 2 of Romans chapter 12.
[time=1191] "One man has faith that he may eat all things, but he who is weak eats vegetables only."
[time=1200] You see what I mean? There are some Christians, and both of those men, there are believers who can eat anything.
[time=1206] It doesn't matter. Put it down. I'll eat it. I have total freedom, and when I'm done eating, I don't feel guilt, shame, or conviction.
[time=1212] Put some of that same food in front of another Christian, and if they eat it, they'll feel enormous amounts of guilt and shame and conviction.
[time=1220] They'll have to ask forgiveness of God for having eaten that.
[time=1223] You say, "Help me understand that." Well, for example, in the church at Rome, there were people who had been converted out of their Old Testament Judaism.
[time=1231] They had been watching carefully all the rituals and all the legalistic and all the external stuff that was bound up in Old Testament Judaism.
[time=1239] And these people come to Christ, and they would break into two separate groups.
[time=1243] Some of the Jews that came to Christ would say, "You know what? I'm so glad I am free from all that old covenant stuff.
[time=1252] I can now eat any kind of meat any time I want, prepare it any way, because I'm now in the new covenant, and I'm free.
[time=1260] I have Christian liberty, and they're right. They're absolutely right.
[time=1264] But there were other Jews that came to Christ out of that Old Testament stuff that did never get that free.
[time=1271] I mean, they're free from the parameters of what God would allow them to do, but in their own heart and their own mind and their own conscience.
[time=1278] They could never eat pork, because it was tied to what they could never do in their old way of worshiping God.
[time=1285] They would be called a weak Christian.
[time=1288] A strong Christian would have been one of those Jews that was free from all that stuff.
[time=1293] The Sabbath observance, the festivals, the feasts, and the food, it's gone for me. I'm now a believer.
[time=1299] Another Jew comes to Christ just as saved, weak faith, not in the sense that they didn't really get saved,
[time=1305] weak faith in the sense that they aren't really free to live all the Christian liberty that is truly theirs now that they're in the new covenant.
[time=1313] Let me give you another example that was going on inside of this very Roman church as it related to food.
[time=1319] Some of the believers in this church at Rome were Gentiles. They had come out of pagan backgrounds, not Old Testament Jewish, but truly pagan idolatry.
[time=1329] And for them, food was tied to that pagan experience. They would go to the pagan temple, and they would eat and eat and eat, and they would eat certain things.
[time=1339] And with that, they would drink other things, and oftentimes become intoxicated, and there, under the name of pagan worship, they would have sex with prostitutes there at the temple.
[time=1349] They would get saved remarkably, totally, completely forgiven by God for all that stuff.
[time=1355] And then they too would break into two groups, not on purpose, it's just how it worked in their hearts and in their minds.
[time=1361] And some of those pagans coming out of that idolatry could then, having come to Christ, they could eat anything.
[time=1367] They could even eat meat that had been originally offered in one of those pagan temples, didn't get consumed, and was sold out the back door in a marketplace situation.
[time=1379] And it didn't cause them to stumble, it didn't cause them to feel guilt or shame. They didn't matter to them where that meat had been the night before, because they were born again, and they were free, and it was just food.
[time=1390] But there were other Gentiles who had been saved out of that same pagan experience, who if they knew that that piece of meat had been in that temple the night before, the very temple where they had so violated and sinned against God,
[time=1405] that to eat that meat would cause them to feel so much guilt and so much shame and so much conviction, they'd have to confess it as having sin.
[time=1415] It wasn't sin in and of themselves, itself, that meat, nothing sinful about that meat, it's just meat.
[time=1421] But to them, because of their background, because of their being bound by their conscience, it was completely out of bounds.
[time=1428] That's called a gray area, that's where this whole concept of Christian liberty comes in, because some Christians are called strong in faith, they're free, other Christians are weak in their faith, they're bound in their conscience.
[time=1441] So there's a whole bunch of stuff out there that some believers can do, and other believers can't do, not because God has said black and white, but because of what's going on in their heart.
[time=1451] Let me give you another example, out of this text, look at verse 5, you'll see not just food was an issue, but so were days, days, look at verse 5.
[time=1461] One man regards one day above another, another regards every day alike.
[time=1467] Let each man be fully convinced in his own mind, what does that mean, and this was true both of Jews and Gentiles.
[time=1473] A certain Jew would come out of Old Testament religion, and he had to observe the Sabbath, if he didn't do certain things and restrict his behavior and live a certain way on the Sabbath, see, he would regard one day the Sabbath above another.
[time=1487] There were special days to him, and you had to do special things on that day to maintain a clear conscience before God, and if you didn't, if you treated it like any other day, then he would feel guilt and shame and have to confess his sin.
[time=1500] But there were other Old Testament Jews that knew the Sabbath was gone, and it didn't matter, and so were the festival days, and so were the feasts.
[time=1507] Every day was the same to some of those Jewish converts.
[time=1512] Same in the Gentile arena, some Gentiles felt, and some of us in this auditorium might connect with this.
[time=1519] I can bring this to real contemporary thing, there are some people in our church who look at a pagan festival, like what, like Halloween.
[time=1526] And there are some believers in this room who go, "I don't give a rip about Halloween," and it's alleged satanic origins.
[time=1532] To me, it's an opportunity for my kid to dress up like a football player, and for me to have fun, and maybe with some unsaved neighbors, and run around the place and get some candy and have a great time.
[time=1541] I'm free, it doesn't matter to me, it doesn't affect me, I don't go home feeling, "Oh my goodness, I violated my relationship with the Lord."
[time=1548] There are others of us in this assembly who, because of its origins, and its place, and demons, and spirits, and witches, and crossbones and skulls, and that whole nine yards,
[time=1561] for them to allow themselves, or their kids, to participate in that, anyway, no, it's impossible, it's an absolute guilt-ridden, conscious, violating experience.
[time=1573] Okay? Same thing was going on here, I don't know what the days were, so to speak, but they were Roman pagan holidays.
[time=1580] And some Greeks had been converted, totally free to do whatever, big deal, it's just a day, it's like any other day.
[time=1586] Other Gentiles having been converted, whoa, I can't get near that. When I get near that, I feel like I violated my relationship with God.
[time=1595] So, Paul pretty much restricts here, and other places in the New Testament, his discussion today's, and to food, because it universally touches both the Jew, because they had food and day problems,
[time=1609] and the Gentile who came to Christ, because they too had food and day problems, but gray areas aren't just limited to food and days.
[time=1620] Alcohol, alcohol is a gray area. Tobacco is a gray area, movies are a gray area, dancing gray area, playing cards, playing the lottery, how you cut your hair.
[time=1634] Some people see a girl with a butch haircut and immediately, immediately, all kinds of, all kinds of things are now applied to that particular girl because of that haircut.
[time=1644] Body piercing, implants, faceless, jewelry, I mean there's just a whole wide world of things that God has not said in black and white, this is sin.
[time=1655] So it's out of bounds for everybody. There's a whole bunch of stuff that he has not definitively categorically said is absolute sin that constitutes this gray area.
[time=1666] And some believers have freedom. It doesn't matter to them. Stick an earring in your nose. Big deal. I'm free. Other people stick an earring in your nose.
[time=1678] See what I'm saying? And we're all over the map, and that's okay. That's all right. That is to be expected because we have different backgrounds.
[time=1689] We have different expressions of our relationship with Christ. The question though is how in the world are we going to love each other?
[time=1701] How in the world are we going to fellowship with each other? How are we going to stay together? How are we going to continue to be a force for the cause of Christ
[time=1711] When these kinds of issues, gray areas have so much potential to divide us. And that is what Paul wants to address in this topic called Christian Liberty.
[time=1724] It's an amazing thing. Here are the two typical reactions. And if you're in one camp with the other, you're going to hear yourself talking in a minute.
[time=1732] The first reaction is in verse one. Look at verse one. Now accept the one who is weak in faith, but not for the purpose of passing judgment on his opinions.
[time=1746] Look at verse three. Let not him who eats regard with contempt, him who does not eat. Now we're talking about reaction one in the stronger brother.
[time=1757] The stronger brother has the faith to be able to do all these kinds of things in these gray areas and never wants to feel guilt, shame, conviction or anything like that. He's free, too free in Christ.
[time=1765] He tends to look at the weaker brother. What does it say? First of all, he doesn't accept him. Now the word accept means open arm and brace.
[time=1773] Let him in. Hug him. Love him. You know, be kindred. Don't let these issues keep you from having unity.
[time=1782] What a strong brother will tend to do to a weaker brother is keep him at arms distance.
[time=1787] Then look at verse three. To hold him in contempt. And that means to think little of him. To think little of him.
[time=1794] Well that individual must not really understand the scriptures as he ought to, not really appreciating the full liberty that comes in Christ.
[time=1801] He's depreciating what Christ really did on the cross. And he's adding things that should never be added to what Christianity looks like.
[time=1808] And then they, they deride and demean and hold in contempt the weaker brother. And so there's a fraction in the church.
[time=1815] That's a problem. Now look at the other reaction in verse three, a very typical reaction on the part of the weaker brother looking at the stronger brother.
[time=1825] It's at the end of verse three that you may prove, oh wait a minute, wrong chapter, sorry, 14, here you go.
[time=1831] Let not him who does not eat, end of verse three, judge him who eats. See there it is. Let not him who does not eat.
[time=1839] That's the weaker brother. He doesn't have freedom to eat. You don't sit around and judge the guy who does.
[time=1845] Don't you do your little deal in your head which says you know if he really loved God or if she really was going to honor God they would set that aside
[time=1853] because there's a higher standard that we could live at. And it would include not doing this and not doing that and not doing this and not doing that.
[time=1860] And so the weaker brother has a tendency to judge the stronger brother as having a commitment problem to God.
[time=1868] It's very natural, it's very normal. Why? Because the weaker brother doesn't do those things as a reflection of their commitment to God because they don't have freedom to do it.
[time=1876] When they do those things they feel guilty. They then believe that when a stronger brother does those same things they feel guilty too, which isn't the case.
[time=1885] And then they judge that person for violating a conscience and they should be purer. They should have a higher standard. They should do it differently.
[time=1892] Two common reactions. The strong brother looks at the weaker brother and belittles their commitment to Christ, holds them in contempt and keeps them away.
[time=1901] The weaker brother looks at the stronger brother and judges them. It says man you must not really be committed to God the way I'm committed to God or you wouldn't do that kind of stuff.
[time=1910] Now guess what? The big issue here is not the gray areas. The big issue that Paul goes on to talk about is not now try to add a whole bunch of more rules and regulations so he can eliminate these two categories.
[time=1925] Weak, strong, everything is nailed down. No, he doesn't do that. You know what he does? He says listen to me now.
[time=1932] You folks have got to learn how to love each other in the midst of this kind of confusion. In the midst of this kind of lack of absolute clarity.
[time=1943] We have got to learn how to continue. Look at it, it's in verse 15. Look at chapter 14 verse 15 says, "For if because of food your brother has hurt," now watch, here's the phrase.
[time=1954] You are no longer walking according to love. His greatest concern here is not to try to define which behavior is which or what or who's better. It's this.
[time=1964] Love each other. That is the point. How do we coexist? And not just in a quiet, removed, agreed to disagree stance. How do we wrap our arms around each other?
[time=1978] How do we not judge each other? How do we not demean each other? That's what he's going to address. And I love that perspective. I absolutely love that.
[time=1987] Because relationships are the issue, aren't they? We have no freedom to sin. We're sin is sin. We have no freedom to sin. We're sin is sin. It's out of bounds.
[time=1995] Now everything that's not out of bounds you know what the most important thing is. It isn't whether you do it or you don't do it. It's how you feel about people who do it or don't do it.
[time=2001] It's loving each other. It's a community thing. It's unity. It's us. It's the church. And that's where he's going to go.
[time=2007] Now, he's going to give us an answering this. He's going to give us two ways. Because these are hard hurdles. It's easy to stand up here and say not to judge each other.
[time=2016] It's easy to stand up here and say to love each other. It's very hard to do it in practice when somebody stepping on one of your spiritual taboos.
[time=2024] Very hard to do. And Paul knows that. And so he's going to approach it in two different ways. First, the first 12 verses of this chapter he's going to give us some things to think about.
[time=2035] When you feel like judging, when you feel like holding in contempt, when you feel like pushing out of your life, think about these four things.
[time=2043] I'm going to call them perspectives for unity. There's four sub points to that.
[time=2047] Perspectives for unity. Think this way about your brother who is either having too much liberty or not enough liberty.
[time=2056] Then he's going to go beyond that. He's going to talk about some choices that we need to make. Not just thinking, but doing.
[time=2062] And there'll be two main points on that. All right? Here we go.
[time=2066] Number one, perspectives for unity. I told you there's four sub points. Here's the first sub point. Here it is.
[time=2071] The number one reason that you and I should accept our differing brother or sister in Christ is because the Lord does.
[time=2081] That's good. Look at verse three again.
[time=2083] The Lord accepts him. Why don't you? Look, let not him who eats the strong guy regard with contempt, him who does not eat the weak guy.
[time=2092] Now he reverses it. And let not him who does not eat the weak guy judge him who eats the strong guy.
[time=2099] Why should you not do that to each other? Look at the end of the verse. For God has accepted him.
[time=2103] It could read, "For God has accepted both of them." In other words, the Jewish convert who can't eat pork because of conscience and the Jewish convert who can, they look at each other.
[time=2118] And they say, "Should I accept you? Should I love you? Should I be a part of your life? Could I recommend you? Can I respect you?
[time=2129] Can I have fellowship with you? Can I honor you even though you eat and I don't or I eat and you don't? Can I accept you?"
[time=2137] Well, here's the truth. God already has. God already has. God fully and totally embraces the weaker brother.
[time=2146] He puts his arms around the person who for conscience sake cannot eat meat that has been offered idols.
[time=2151] For the Jew converted who cannot eat, no problem. I love you. You're part of me. It's not a problem with me.
[time=2158] And God comes over to the liberated Christian, the strong in faith who has ability to eat meat whether offered idols or a Jew having been converted eating Old Testament pork.
[time=2168] I accept him. He's not violating me. No problem in our relationship.
[time=2174] And so God begins by saying when you want to restrict your fellowship with somebody, when you want to judge, when you want to push somebody away over one of these issues, you just remember this. I've already accepted them.
[time=2185] That's amazing in it. Some of you, if you saw another Christian brother or sister sitting down having a glass of wine with their dinner, whoa!
[time=2195] What is that? Where's your commitment to Christ?
[time=2199] Others of you could sit down and have a glass of wine and never at once have a problem. Never once feel attention of guilt.
[time=2205] And you're wondering, should we accept each other? God says, I already have. I completely honor, accept and respect the individual who chooses for conscience sake not to have a glass of wine.
[time=2214] And God says, I completely and totally without reservation accept the individual who sits down and has a glass of wine. No problem. I accept you both.
[time=2222] Therefore, what? Accept each other. Accept each other. It's not an issue.
[time=2229] Number two, I love this one because this one hit me right between the eyes this week.
[time=2235] Verse four, the second sub point there is, the Lord sustains both of them. Look at it.
[time=2242] Who are you to judge the servant of another? To his own master, he stands or falls. Now watch and stand he will for the Lord is able to make him stand.
[time=2253] Here's what happens. The stronger brother holding in contempt, the weaker brother, for being so restrictive and narrow and necessarily and for mitigating the freedom that God gives us in Christ.
[time=2264] Begins to say, you know, that Christianity, that brand of Christianity, it'll never work. You watch, there'll be some real serious negative consequences in their life because they're so narrow.
[time=2276] They're so weak in their faith. They're so limited in their expression of Christian liberty. They're headed for bad times.
[time=2284] They're going to fall. That's what I say. They're predicting. That's kind of self justifying thing. They're not living the way I'm living.
[time=2291] They're obviously then therefore living wrong. There's the judgment. And living wrong will lead them to stumbling.
[time=2296] The weaker brother turns on and looks stronger brother. That says, you know what? You can't live that close to the world. You can't live in those kinds of things.
[time=2303] You need some extra boundaries and rules in your life. You need to make some higher standard choices on your life or eventually and inevitably you will stumble.
[time=2312] You will fall because your brand of Christianity won't work. The Lord says, time out. Let me tell you how I feel about that part of it.
[time=2320] Look at it again. Who are you to judge? To his own master. Let me tell you, the weaker brother stands accountable to me, not you.
[time=2330] And the stronger brother stands accountable to me, not you.
[time=2336] And they stand or fall and their relationship with me. And by the way, they're going to stand. You want to know why?
[time=2342] Because I am able to make them stand. Do you realize that God can work just as powerfully and just as faithfully in the weaker brother's life to keep him standing strong for the glory of God as he can in the stronger brother's life?
[time=2356] God isn't saying, well, gee whiz. I don't know. I don't know. I'm not going to help the weaker brother. That's a messed up way of looking at Scripture.
[time=2364] I don't know. I'm not going to help the stronger brother. The Lord loves his children. And if one person for conscience say can't do it and the other can, he doesn't withhold his love and his support and his ministry and his involvement in their life.
[time=2377] He's totally committed to both. Think about that. Next time you judge a brother for their weakness or their strength.
[time=2385] See, that's what he's saying. Number three. I love this one too. I learned this one from my wife many years ago.
[time=2393] The Lord, I put point number three is this. The Lord understands them. Look at verses five and six.
[time=2398] One man regards one day above another. Another regards every day alike. Remember we looked at this first. Now here's the point.
[time=2405] Let each man be fully convinced in his own mind. What's he saying? Be authentic. Be authentic. Be fully convinced in your own mind.
[time=2417] If you're going to keep a day, keep it. But don't keep it from external pressure. Keep it from your heart before me.
[time=2422] And if you're not going to keep a day, then don't keep it out of external. Keep it fail to keep it in your heart for me.
[time=2429] In other words, whichever way you go on this issue, do it from an authentic relationship with Christ. It goes on. Look at verse six.
[time=2436] He observes the day. Why should he observe it? He should observe it for the Lord. Not for external, not for ritual, not for people's opinion.
[time=2443] And he who eats does so for the Lord. For he gives thanks to God and he who eats not for the Lord, he does not eat and gives thanks to God.
[time=2454] God doesn't care if you eat or don't eat. I mean, me, for example. God doesn't care if you watch a day or don't watch a day.
[time=2461] You know what he's looking for? If you do eat or don't eat, if you do watch or you don't watch, are you doing it authentically from your heart as honoring God with your life?
[time=2469] That's what he's looking for. And he understands the difference. Whereas you and I, we can't look at another person.
[time=2475] I said my wife earlier, she was raised in somewhat of a liturgical ritualistic church, which in my opinion had long since stopped communicating the gospel.
[time=2487] And for that, now we're not in a gray area anymore, are we? You stopped communicating the gospel. That's bad. That's sin.
[time=2493] But I want to talk about parts of that services that were ritualistic.
[time=2498] And you'd get up a lot and you'd sit down a lot, you'd sit down a lot and you'd sit down a lot.
[time=2502] And there were pre-rehearsed, pre-written prayers and pre-written like oaths that you would say.
[time=2508] And I sat there with a negative attitude primarily because they had stopped preaching the gospel, which I think is appropriate.
[time=2513] But then I would splash that over to their ritual.
[time=2517] And I kind of wrote everybody off in the whole place until I looked at her.
[time=2521] And she was born again and she had heard the gospel, she had heard it through campus crusade for Christ, athletes in action.
[time=2527] And you know what? When she said those prayers, they were very doctrinal, they were very scriptural.
[time=2532] And those oaths, they were also very scriptural. And when I watched her saying them, it dawned on me, you know what?
[time=2539] That's real. That's genuine. That is from her heart. That honors God.
[time=2546] So that's the point.
[time=2548] God is looking at the heart and He's saying if you eat or you don't eat, you have a day, you don't have a day, you have a routine prayer, you don't have a routine prayer.
[time=2555] You stand up too much, you stand up too little. Look, I have no word about all that stuff.
[time=2559] Whatever you like, as long as it's not declared as sin, whatever you like.
[time=2564] But whatever you do, whatever you do, do it to glorify me.
[time=2570] Live from me. Live from my glory. Live from my honor.
[time=2574] It's a powerful point. You've got to think about that when you look at another brother.
[time=2578] The last one here, number four, comes in verses 10 and 11, and it's this, the Lord will evaluate everybody in the end.
[time=2586] Verse 10, "But you, why do you judge your brother, or you again, why do you regard your brother with contempt?
[time=2593] For we shall stand before the judgment seat of God, for it is written, as I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall give praise to God."
[time=2601] Look at verse 12, "So then each one of us shall give an account of Himself to God." In other words, you and I don't need to play judge.
[time=2610] We aren't supposed to play judge, and we aren't even able to play judge.
[time=2615] Because most of what God is going to look at is the condition of our heart as it relates to gray areas, and we can't see other people's hearts, and we can't see other people's motives.
[time=2623] And so God says, "You guys, sit this one out, sit this one out, and know that in the end I, the one who can see the thoughts and the intentions and the motives of people's hearts, I will deal with it."
[time=2635] Now, this is not the judgment seat in terms of heaven or hell.
[time=2639] This is the beam of seat there in 1 Corinthians 3.
[time=2641] It is the evaluation point that every Christian goes through before the Lord, where the quality and the nature of their commitment and life and honoring God is evaluated by Christ, and rewards are given, or rewards are lost, but it's not a heaven or hell decision.
[time=2655] Just so you know, that's what that's about.
[time=2657] So, perspectives, we got a wide range of people in this church.
[time=2665] Some can and some can't.
[time=2668] How are we going to be together?
[time=2670] Some can dance, some can't dance.
[time=2672] Some can cut their hair in certain ways, and others would feel very sinful for that.
[time=2676] Some can in moderation, and without drunkenness, use alcohol, and others can't.
[time=2679] Some can use tobacco, and others can't.
[time=2682] Some can play cards, and others can't.
[time=2684] Okay, that's true, and God has not spoken definitively on any of those issues.
[time=2688] Anything else, not forbidden in Scripture.
[time=2691] How are we going to live together?
[time=2692] Not tall, right?
[time=2693] I mean, love.
[time=2694] How are we going to put our arms around each other?
[time=2696] Well, watch out for the judging and the belittling and the degrading.
[time=2700] And when you feel tempted to go there in your mind, whether you're the strong or the weak person, remember four things.
[time=2706] The perspectives.
[time=2707] Think these things through with that person in mind.
[time=2709] You know what?
[time=2710] The Lord accepts them.
[time=2711] The Lord's got his arms around that guy.
[time=2714] The Lord has his arms around that gal.
[time=2716] There's no distance there.
[time=2718] And you know what?
[time=2719] The Lord is going to sustain that person and work through that weak form of Christianity, or that strong form of Christianity.
[time=2726] And beyond that, you know what?
[time=2728] The Lord is ultimately concerned, at least in these gray areas, with what is in their heart.
[time=2733] And eventually and ultimately the Lord will work it all out with them anyway.
[time=2737] They're at the beam of seed.
[time=2738] So, you know what I'm going to do?
[time=2740] I'm going to love.
[time=2741] I'm going to accept.
[time=2742] I'm going to appreciate the difference.
[time=2744] I'm not going to be threatened by the difference.
[time=2746] I'm going to let God be God.
[time=2748] And I'm going to hold on to the unity of the church.
[time=2751] Okay?
[time=2752] Now, we've got to go to this next thing.
[time=2755] You come to the end of those four little points, and you almost have the impression that you know what?
[time=2760] It's a live and let live deal.
[time=2762] It's a live and let live deal here in the church.
[time=2765] If the strong want to eat a certain thing, or go a certain place, or drink a certain thing, or wear a certain thing, you've got to let them do it.
[time=2774] Why?
[time=2775] Because when I see them doing things that bug me, I just got to remember those four points.
[time=2778] I'll rethink it.
[time=2779] I'll let the Lord be the Lord.
[time=2780] And so they're free to do whatever they want to do.
[time=2782] You could almost think that at the end of those first twelve verses.
[time=2785] By the same token, you could almost feel like, "Well, it's a live and let live." And so don't ever give any thought to the weaker brother.
[time=2791] But the chapter doesn't stop there.
[time=2794] And the chapter at this point says this.
[time=2796] Don't let anybody take your liberty.
[time=2799] Don't let anybody threaten your freedom.
[time=2801] He's talking about your heart now.
[time=2803] Or bind your conscience to things which are not in and of themselves evil.
[time=2806] But, but you need to take care of your weaker brother.
[time=2812] This is not a license to live out the fullness of your Christian liberty.
[time=2817] Because there is a higher law, and the law is we love each other.
[time=2821] And if my living out my Christian liberty causes a weaker brother to stumble, I need not live that out in a way or in a place that it causes that person to stumble.
[time=2831] And that's where he's going here.
[time=2833] It's great truth.
[time=2834] It is so consistent with how we are supposed to treat each other.
[time=2837] Christianity is not about liberty.
[time=2839] Christianity is about loving one another.
[time=2841] And for the one who has a lot of liberty, he restricts voluntarily that liberty to protect the other, the weaker brother.
[time=2847] Look at it.
[time=2848] Choices for unity, the first sub point on this one is don't hurt your brother.
[time=2854] Don't hurt your brother.
[time=2857] Verses 13 and 15.
[time=2859] Look at it.
[time=2860] Therefore, let us not judge one another anymore.
[time=2863] But rather determine this.
[time=2865] Now watch.
[time=2866] Not to put an obstacle or a stumbling block in a brother's way.
[time=2871] Verse 14.
[time=2872] I know and am convinced in this, in the Lord Jesus, look, that nothing is unclean in itself.
[time=2879] Paul is saying the stronger brother is right.
[time=2882] He is right.
[time=2883] Nothing in and of itself is unclean.
[time=2886] That is the things that Christ hasn't said our sin.
[time=2889] Everything else is okay.
[time=2891] But look it.
[time=2893] To him who thinks anything to be unclean to him it is unclean.
[time=2898] Now watch.
[time=2899] Do you understand that?
[time=2901] There may be nothing in there isn't.
[time=2903] There is nothing in the scriptures that say you can't take a bunch of dried out weeds, roll them up in a piece of paper, stick them in your mouth and light them in fire.
[time=2912] Nothing.
[time=2913] It doesn't say that.
[time=2914] It's not sin.
[time=2915] It's not a black and white.
[time=2916] But do you realize that there are people, Christian people, devout, loving, gracious,
[time=2922] godly Christian people that if they ever got close to that would feel as though they had committed like broken one in ten commandments.
[time=2931] See that's what it says.
[time=2932] Look at the end of verse 14.
[time=2934] But to him who thinks anything to be unclean to him it is.
[time=2939] And for him to do that is sin because of his conscience.
[time=2945] Because of his integrity of his heart with God.
[time=2948] You can't break your conscience.
[time=2950] You can't break your integrity.
[time=2951] And so if you're a weaker brother and you get involved in something which is a gray area, God has not declared it as sin.
[time=2959] And you do that.
[time=2960] Then what you end up doing is you do sin.
[time=2962] Not because it was wrong to do that thing.
[time=2964] It's because it was wrong to violate your conscience.
[time=2969] Look at verse 15.
[time=2971] For if because of food your brother is hurt you are no longer walking according to love.
[time=2977] Do not watch.
[time=2978] Do not destroy with your food him for whom Christ died.
[time=2982] Who is he talking to?
[time=2983] He is talking to the stronger brother who has liberty to eat anything.
[time=2987] And you realize that take for example a brand new convert out of that Greek pagan culture.
[time=2995] A weaker brother has no freedom to eat that meat because of the association to the temple.
[time=3002] And so if a stronger brother out maybe out of that same background but no problem with the meat.
[time=3007] He sits down and kind of in a cavalier non-respecting unloving way throws the meat on the table.
[time=3014] And at some point in the meal says guess where I got that.
[time=3018] And all of a sudden however it happens the weaker brother is led to stumble, to violate his conscience.
[time=3028] That can and often does throw a chain reaction of spiritual digression in the heart and the life of that weaker brother.
[time=3035] And before you know it the weaker brothers as well have already violated my relationship with God by eating that food with my Christian brother.
[time=3041] And so he was kind of weak anyway so he winds up back maybe at the temple maybe involved in all that stuff that he hates.
[time=3048] And the thing that threw him over the edge the thing that got him going down that long horrible black path from which he will eventually repent was that a stronger brother took his liberty to a place he had no business taking it in the presence of a weaker brother.
[time=3064] And so it is see these phrases the end of verse 13 a stumbling block the person trips.
[time=3070] And then you can see it again in verse 15 if because of your food then the person gets hurt spiritually damaged.
[time=3076] And then the word is even used there in verse 15 being destroyed and that doesn't mean they lose their salvation.
[time=3080] It just means that this whole thing they were trying to do before God just boom.
[time=3084] All because all because a stronger brother didn't realize that potential and didn't love and didn't take care of and didn't protect his weaker brother
[time=3093] or sister in Christ. See that's yeah well don't let anybody take your Christian liberty away.
[time=3099] Don't let anybody tell you something is sin that God hasn't said is sin.
[time=3103] And don't go around judging other people and don't hold people in contempt all that's true.
[time=3108] But listen we have a responsibility to each other not to conduct our lives in such a way that would bring a weaker brother to a place of stumbling of being hurt possibly destroyed.
[time=3120] So he says don't so carelessly use your freedoms in Christ that you cause another Christian brother to stumble.
[time=3126] And then he throws in that little phrase at the end of the verse look at it in the verse 15 for whom Christ died.
[time=3132] Remember who you're dealing with here. Remember who you're dealing with here.
[time=3135] This is a precious beloved child of God and Christ died to redeem that child.
[time=3140] And you don't go messing with that child.
[time=3145] I mean you got to value that child like Christ valued that child when he died for him.
[time=3150] Okay.
[time=3153] Now it gets even broader than that.
[time=3157] In verses 16 and 18 he opens up our concern the stronger brother's concern not just a weaker brother's but to the testimony of believers in general.
[time=3165] This is going to be very interesting I hope I can get this done in five minutes.
[time=3169] Watch this look at verses 16 through 18 therefore do not let what is for you a good thing be spoken of as evil.
[time=3177] In other words time the stronger brother you got liberty in Christ that's a good thing don't let the good thing be spoken of as evil.
[time=3183] For the kingdom of God in verse 17 is not eating and drinking but righteousness peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.
[time=3189] For he who is in this way serves Christ watch is acceptable to God and approved by men.
[time=3197] Approved by men I believe that's where the unsaved world comes into this passage it is being approved by men.
[time=3204] You and I need to live inside the church in such a way that the outside world who is watching approves of the way what?
[time=3213] The way we eat no the way we dress no what we eat or drink no the way we treat each other.
[time=3223] Do you understand the point of our testimony to the unsaved world isn't what we choose to do or not do in the gray areas that's not the point.
[time=3231] The point is if a stronger brother were to be so calloused and hard-hearted toward a weaker brother that he would do something to cause the weaker brother to stumble or to be hurt or to be destroyed.
[time=3242] The watching unsaved world would say why in the world would I ever want to get to be a part of a group like that.
[time=3247] Look how callous they treat each other look at the indifference with which they approach each other.
[time=3253] I don't have time to go there this morning but that that point is born out in 1 Corinthians chapter 10 and the scenario is an unbeliever who invites two believers to dinner.
[time=3262] The unbeliever invites two believers to dinner and the unbeliever doesn't know it but the unbeliever has a strong Christian and a weak Christian.
[time=3271] And the unbeliever not trying to prove a point or doing crazy happens to serve meat and it happens to be meat that was bought at a temple, a pagan temple.
[time=3281] So now you've got a strong brother who could eat you've got a weaker brother who can't eat without sitting in his own heart and the question is what do you do?
[time=3289] What does the stronger brother do? Does he eat so as not to offend the unbeliever or does he not eat thereby offending the unbeliever host
[time=3300] but honor his Christian weaker brother and you know what the text says don't eat don't eat.
[time=3306] You choose the honoring of your brother in Christ who isn't free to eat don't you violate his conscience
[time=3313] don't you lead him to be hurt stumble or destroyed and the reason is the unbeliever will look at that kind of love and say I'm not offended
[time=3321] I'm amazed that people care for each other like that there is our testimony that is the testimony element of gray areas.
[time=3330] It isn't that we got to refrain from certain things because the world will think certain things about us.
[time=3335] That isn't it we got to refrain from sin because Jesus said sin is out of bounds and that will destroy our testimony if we get involved in sin.
[time=3343] But all this other stuff that God hasn't said is sin we don't refrain from that because if we do they'll think certain things about us.
[time=3350] And secondly I'm disappointed in churches who are most known by the unbelieving community around them because they don't do certain gray areas.
[time=3359] I think that's harming to the name of Christ not helping.
[time=3363] That should never be the issue. We should be known first and foremost for our adamant love for Christ and our love for each other which is evidenced by the way we treat each other and part of that is the gray areas where the strong brother gives deference to the weak brother
[time=3374] and the unbelieving world says now that's love. I want to be a part of that. I want to be treated like that.
[time=3380] That's how people are supposed to treat each other. There's your testimony.
[time=3385] So how do you have unity? How do you have unity in a church where you've got weak brothers limited and constrained by their conscience and they've got to stay within that and we need to honor them?
[time=3398] You've got strong brothers who have all kinds of liberties and you've got to let them in their own way and in their own place in such a way that they don't offend or cause to stumble
[time=3405] you've got to let them be who they are. How does all that work together?
[time=3408] You've got different age groups. You've got different backgrounds. You've got different perspectives. You've got culture changing. How do you survive?
[time=3414] Number one you've got to think some things. You've got to have a certain perspective. Remember?
[time=3418] God accepts that other brother, weak or strong. God sustains that other brother, weak or strong. God understands that other brother, weak or strong
[time=3425] and God will ultimately evaluate that brother, weak or strong. So don't you get in the business of doing that?
[time=3430] So that's how you think about each other. So there's no internal judging going on. No judging the book by its cover.
[time=3437] But then secondly there's some things we've got to do and that is one we have got to limit our Christian liberty in such a way that we do not cause to stumble or hurt or destroy the weaker brother and that ends up being our greatest testimony that we would be approved by men.
[time=3451] Verses 22 and 23 as we close. The faith which you have has your own conviction before God. Don't violate your conscience my friends.
[time=3461] Happy is he who does not condemn himself and what he approves. Nobody's trying to make, if you're weak we're not trying to make you strong.
[time=3467] If you're strong we're not trying to make you weak. You're okay. Live your conscience before God. Now watch 23.
[time=3472] But he who doubts is condemned if he eats because his eating is not from faith and whatever is not from faith is sin.
[time=3480] Well there you have it. Unity in the church amidst the diversity. Let me invite you to stand and we'll close in a word of prayer.
[time=3492] Our gracious God and Heavenly Father we see here a great principle. It runs its way all the way through the scriptures.
[time=3504] And it's bigger than gray areas. It's bigger than the taboos. It's bigger than the rituals. It's bigger than all that stuff. It's people.
[time=3513] It's people. And your greatest concern is that we treat each other in love. We walk according to love and in that give great testimony to the unsaved world.
[time=3523] That pray that it help us. Help us thrive in unity for your glory and for your honor. We pray these things in Christ's name and all God's people say. God bless you.
