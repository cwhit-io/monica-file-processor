[time=527] name, truth, reveal, my future, see, reveal, my day, love and freedom, life and war,

[time=560] name, Jesus, what a beautiful name, Jesus, what a beautiful name, Jesus, what a beautiful
[time=588] name, Jesus, what a beautiful name, son of God, son of man, and that was slain, joy and
[time=607] peace, strength and hope, grace that laws are fear away, Jesus, what a beautiful name,
[time=654] name.
[time=655] Let me invite you this morning to open your Bibles again and really for the last time,
[time=663] at least in our Sunday morning experiences to the Book of Romans and instead of going to Romans 16, I want you to go to Romans chapter 1.
[time=673] Well, it happened again this week.
[time=679] Another person came to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ through the Book of Romans.
[time=687] People have been getting saved through the study of the Book of Romans for almost 2,000 years now.
[time=693] The man by the name of Aurelius Augustine came to Christ through the Book of Romans in AD
[time=699] 386.
[time=700] He was sitting in a garden, he was weeping over the horrible condition of his soul and
[time=706] he picked up a scroll and on it was written Romans chapter 13 verses 13 through 14 and
[time=712] having pondered that scripture, he came to know Christ in his words, he said it this way.
[time=717] So further what I read, nor did I need, for instantly as the sentence ended, by a light
[time=724] as it were or a security infused into my heart, all the gloom of doubt vanished away.
[time=733] Aurelius Augustine, one of the great church fathers in church history.
[time=739] About a thousand years later, another person came to Christ through the Book of Romans.
[time=744] His name was Martin Luther.
[time=746] He wasn't struggling with Romans 13, he was struggling with Romans chapter 3 and this phrase the righteousness of God.
[time=753] He said this, "Night and day I pondered until I grasped the truth that the righteousness
[time=759] of God is that righteousness whereby through grace and sheer mercy.
[time=764] God justifies us by faith.
[time=767] Thereupon I felt myself to be reborn and to have gone through open doors into paradise.
[time=774] The whole of scripture took on a new meaning," he said, "and whereby before the righteousness of God had filled me with hate, now it became an inexpressibly sweet in greater love.
[time=786] This passage of Paul," he said, "became to me a gateway to heaven." Martin Luther, several centuries later another man came to saving knowledge of Jesus Christ
[time=797] through the study of the Book of Romans, his name, none other than John Wesley.
[time=804] Wednesday evening, May 24, 1738, he wrote this in his journal, "I went very unwillingly
[time=810] to a society in Alders Gate Street where one was reading Luther's preface to the epistle to the Romans." About a quarter before nine, while he was describing the change which God works in the heart through faith in Christ, "I felt my heart strangely warmed.
[time=827] I felt I did trust in Christ, Christ alone for my salvation and an assurance was given me that he had taken away my sins, even mine, and saved me from the law of sin and death."
[time=842] And yet again this week in my office, a young lady who attends our church, she and her husband and their newly born baby for about a year and a half now, sitting in the service last Sunday, listening to the Book of Romans and feeling the Spirit of God penetrate her heart with the searching question, "Are you really saved?" And unable to resolve that in her own mind, she came into my office and asked the question, "How can I know?" And after a few moments of conversation, she was clear enough in her mind that she was not saved at all, as tears filled her eyes, she longed to accept the Savior, and there she did.
[time=874] You say, "Wow, you know what makes the Book of Romans such a powerful book?
[time=882] How is it that some of the greatest people used of God in all of church history have been saved through the Book of Romans?
[time=888] And how is it that even in this day, even in our day, even in our church, even in the last three days, the Book of Romans still reaps a harvest of souls for God?
[time=899] How is that?
[time=900] Well look at chapter 1 verse 16.
[time=905] Paul says, "There I am not ashamed," there it is, "I am not ashamed of the gospel."
[time=911] Romans is a book about the gospel.
[time=914] Well what about the gospel?
[time=916] Look at verse 16 again, and it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes.
[time=923] He means by that to the Jew first and also to the Greek.
[time=927] He explains a little more in verse 17, "For in it," in what?
[time=931] In the gospel, and therefore in the Book of Romans, "in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith as it is written, but the righteous men shall live by faith."
[time=944] Today as we say farewell to our Sunday morning study of the Book of Romans, I want to say the gospel to you one more time, the way that Paul said it in the Book of Romans, the
[time=954] way he said it to Augustine, the way he said it to Luther, the way he said it to Wesley, and the way he said it to the young lady last week.
[time=961] We have looked in our study of the Book of Romans at individual chapters, we have looked at paragraphs, we have looked at phrases, we have looked at words.
[time=969] This morning I want us to look at the whole thing.
[time=972] I want you to understand in one last sweeping move what the gospel really is.
[time=978] What is this thing that has the power of God for salvation?
[time=983] Not in part but in total.
[time=986] I want you to see the flow.
[time=987] I want you to see the argument of the Book of Romans.
[time=993] So you ask me, well, okay, what is it?
[time=995] What is the gospel?
[time=998] Exactly what is the gospel?
[time=1001] You might ask it another way, what must I know or what must I do to be saved?
[time=1006] And the answer is here in the Book of Romans.
[time=1008] In fact, I will endeavor to give you the whole book this morning in 20 words or less.
[time=1012] Now, not my 20 words, but 20 words I'll put on the screen.
[time=1016] All right, 20 words or less just by way of overview.
[time=1020] Let's begin.
[time=1022] The gospel begins with the wrath of God.
[time=1028] That may sound harsh, but it's true.
[time=1031] The gospel begins with the wrath of God.
[time=1034] Look at chapter 1, verse 18.
[time=1037] For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness
[time=1044] of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness.
[time=1048] The first thing a person must know, the first thing a person must understand, the first thing a person must grapple with in their own heart, is that their own ungodliness and their own unrighteousness is what brings to them justly and rightly the wrath of God.
[time=1064] Isaiah declared, "Behold, the day of the Lord is coming, cruel with fury and burning anger to make the land a desolation, and He will exterminate its sinners from it."
[time=1076] Nehem says, "A jealous and avenging God is the Lord.
[time=1080] The Lord is avenging and wrathful.
[time=1082] The Lord takes vengeance on His enemies, and He reserves wrath for His enemies.
[time=1087] The Lord is slow to anger and great in power.
[time=1090] The Lord will by no means leave the guilty unpunished." Nehem, chapter 1, verses 2 and 3.
[time=1097] You see, God has made no attempt to conceal the fact of His wrath.
[time=1103] He is not ashamed to make it known that vengeance and fury belong to Him.
[time=1109] His own challenge is this, quote, "See now that I, even I am He, and there is no God with me.
[time=1115] I kill and I make alive.
[time=1117] I wound and I heal.
[time=1119] Neither is there any that can deliver you out of my hand.
[time=1123] For I lift up my hand to heaven and I say I will live forever.
[time=1126] If I wet my glittering sword and my hand take hold on judgment, I will render vengeance
[time=1132] to my enemies and will reward them that hate me." No apologies in the book of Romans.
[time=1139] No apologies in an understanding of the gospel and no apologies in all the Scripture that God is a God of wrath and vengeance and fury and fire.
[time=1150] You say, "Well, in fact a study of the Bible, the concordance, all the Bible in composite
[time=1156] together will show to you that the Scriptures talk more about God's anger and His fury and His wrath than it does His love and His tenderness, because God is a holy God.
[time=1165] God hates all sin and His anger burns against the sinner every day," Psalm 7 verse 11 says.
[time=1175] What do you suppose that is?
[time=1178] Why do you suppose that the glorious message of being saved, the gospel which literally means the good news?
[time=1185] Why do you suppose the good news begins with such bad, terrible, horrible, awesome news about a holy righteous God who warns all who will listen of His unrelenting vengeance
[time=1195] and wrath?
[time=1197] Well, why does Jesus, in His recorded words in the New Testament, say more about hell
[time=1205] and more about fire and more about judgment and more about damnation than He says about heaven?
[time=1212] You might begin to get a clue.
[time=1214] It is this.
[time=1215] You and I have a problem.
[time=1217] Our problem is pride.
[time=1219] Our problem is arrogance.
[time=1222] Our problem is this.
[time=1223] We so overrate ourselves and our comparative goodness to other people, and we so underrate
[time=1231] the holiness of God whereby He sets a standard of absolute perfection to ever enter His presence.
[time=1239] Our pride so overestimates ourselves and so underestimates His holiness that we are
[time=1246] doomed to a Christless eternity because we never really get the point.
[time=1253] That in and of ourselves, standing in our own merit, attempting or achieving or striving
[time=1259] to please God in and of ourselves, brings only the wrath of God for at our best we are
[time=1266] ungodly.
[time=1267] At our best we are unrighteous and it is a holy God who does not wink at sin nor does
[time=1273] He grade on the curve nor does He take into consideration people's problems in this sense.
[time=1278] You either are perfect and thereby acceptable into heaven or you are not perfect and thereby His wrath for all of eternity.
[time=1286] We have trouble with that.
[time=1288] It's no problem for most of us to say, "Oh yeah, I make mistakes.
[time=1291] Oh yeah, I'm not all that I ought to be.
[time=1293] Oh yeah, I make a sin from now and then." But to say that we are sinners, to categorize ourselves internally and externally in our composite and our totality, against the standard of absolute perfection and say this, "I am
[time=1306] an ungodly, unrighteous sinner and I deserve the wrath of God." That is the beginning of the gospel.
[time=1313] People who get saved say that about themselves and they say it without hesitation and they say it without reservation.
[time=1320] People who get saved say, "I don't know why I'm still alive.
[time=1324] I don't know what it is that would cause a God as holy and His righteous to allow a person as sinful and wretched and selfish and proud and arrogant as me to even take the next breath." That is the beginning of the gospel.
[time=1337] We are sinners.
[time=1342] And so the wrath of God abides on us.
[time=1347] Now, having come to that, He wants to go and I'll show you at the end of middle of chapter
[time=1355] three if you have a Bible you can flip there this morning.
[time=1358] He labors in the first three chapters of the book to say the wrath of God is on everybody.
[time=1363] The moral person, the religious person, as well as the immoral, overtly unrighteous person.
[time=1368] He draws this part of His argument to a close at chapter three, the middle of verse 19 and He says this, "That every mouth may be closed and that all the world may become accountable to God." That's what He wants.
[time=1381] He wants everybody to understand that they are accountable to God for not being perfect and therefore, they are under the wrath of God.
[time=1388] Verse 20 says, "Because by the works of the law, no flesh will be justified in His sight." See, there it is.
[time=1394] No matter how hard you try, no matter if you're better than your neighbor or your friend or your wife or your spouse or anybody else you can think of, that is not the issue who you might be better than.
[time=1405] The issue is, are you perfect?
[time=1407] And the answer is no.
[time=1409] And can I get perfect by my effort?
[time=1410] And the answer is no because verse 20 says, "By the works of the law, no flesh will be no one, not you, not me, not anybody." And so we are condemned.
[time=1422] The gospel begins with the wrath of God.
[time=1424] We stand as condemned sinners worthy of His wrath for all of eternity.
[time=1429] And two of the greatest words that you will ever read are found in verse 21 and they are but now.
[time=1435] In the book of Romans takes a major transition step in chapter 3 verse 21 when Paul says,
[time=1441] "But now, having come to the place that you can say without reservation, that you are an unrighteous sinner unto the wrath of God, now having heard that and understood that and embraced it in your heart," let me tell you the great news, "but now." Look at it.
[time=1455] Verse 21, "Apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been manifest, being witnessed by the law and the prophets." Verse 22, "Even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all those who believe for there is no distinction." You come out of the end of chapter 3 asking yourself the question, "Well then, how do I ever get to heaven?
[time=1476] If I can't earn it, if I can't strive for it, if I can never be perfect because I'm already not, what is my lot in life?
[time=1484] What is my hope?
[time=1485] Where do I look?" And the answer is you look outside yourself and you look into the eyes of Jesus Christ to receive there His very righteousness of God.
[time=1495] I call it the great exchange.
[time=1500] It is exchanging my sinfulness and my pride and my arrogance and my selfishness and my sinfulness for the very righteousness of God.
[time=1509] The standard is perfection, the standard is righteousness, the standard is holy, and only in Christ will I ever be able to meet that standard by His work, by His efforts, by His
[time=1519] holiness, by His death and His resurrection I get to receive as a free gift, the only thing that will ever make me acceptable in the sight of God, a thing called the righteousness of God that comes to me through Christ.
[time=1534] Second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 21 says this, "He made Him who knew no sin," speaking of Christ.
[time=1540] God made Christ who knew no sin to become sin on our behalf that we might become the righteousness
[time=1546] of God.
[time=1547] That's the great exchange.
[time=1548] That's when the Holy Spotless Lamb of God took on your sin and my sin, became sin, died and paid the penalty for our sin, and in return gave us the very righteousness of God.
[time=1560] It says in Isaiah 53, "Surely our griefs He Himself bore and our sorrows He carried.
[time=1567] Yet we ourselves esteemed Him, stricken, smitten of God and afflicted, but He was pierced through for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities, He was chasing for our
[time=1577] well-being, and by His scourgings we are healed."
[time=1583] You understand?
[time=1585] It's a substitute.
[time=1587] He stands in our place.
[time=1588] He dies the death that we should have died.
[time=1591] It's an amazing thing.
[time=1594] First Peter chapter 1 says, "Knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things like silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your far fathers.
[time=1602] No amount of gold and no amount of silver would ever have been enough to give God to appease God for our sinfulness.
[time=1609] We were not redeemed with things like that.
[time=1611] We were redeemed, it says, in the text, with the precious blood of the Lamb unblemished the spotless one, the blood of Christ." So Christ died.
[time=1622] The Gospel, as it is presented in the book of Romans, says that Christ is the one through whom we receive the very righteousness of God.
[time=1633] He redeems us by His blood, in other words, He buys us out of the marketplace of sin into
[time=1639] which we had been hopelessly sold, and He satisfies in His death the wrath of God.
[time=1647] The wrath of God that is hot and flaming against our sin is completely satisfied by the death of Christ.
[time=1656] God has propitiated, and the transaction that occurs then at that very moment is then God
[time=1662] through Christ gives us the very righteousness of God.
[time=1668] That is the beginning.
[time=1670] That is the starting point of the whole thing.
[time=1675] Now you say, "Okay, how do I get that?" You say, "God is willing to give it to me through Christ.
[time=1681] The only way I can ever be saved is to have the righteousness of God.
[time=1684] The only way I can ever get the righteousness of God is through Christ, but what do I do?
[time=1689] That's my part in the equation, look at verse 22 of chapter 3.
[time=1694] Even the righteousness of God, what through faith in Christ?
[time=1699] You and I can't earn the righteousness of God.
[time=1703] You and I can only put our faith in the one who did, and who had it, and who gives it to us.
[time=1710] We are given the righteousness of God at the moment that we put our faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=1716] Think of verse 25, whom God displayed publicly as a propitiation in his blood watch through faith.
[time=1723] It's all about faith.
[time=1725] Do you understand that?
[time=1727] Do you understand that you get saved not by coming to church, not by trying to do your best, not by being to the best of your ability, an honest and respectable person, not by owning a Bible, not by joining this church, not by getting baptized.
[time=1739] None of that saves you.
[time=1740] One thing saves you when you put your faith in Jesus Christ that he died for your sins
[time=1747] and that through his death you can have the righteousness of God, that is the moment of saving faith.
[time=1753] And so chapter 4 of Romans is all about faith.
[time=1756] I mean if faith is the only thing that you and I do to get saved, we better know what that is, right?
[time=1761] And he says in chapter 4 that faith is not works, and faith is not circumcision, faith
[time=1767] is not some external religious experience, and faith is not the possession of the law,
[time=1773] what is faith?
[time=1774] Remember the life of Abraham?
[time=1775] Look at chapter 4 verse 20, "Yet with respect to the promise of God, Abraham did not waver in unbelief but drew strong in faith, giving glory to God, and being fully assured that
[time=1786] what God had promised he was able also to perform." Faith is believing that God will keep his promise.
[time=1794] What promise?
[time=1797] The promise that if you believe in Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, he will forgive you for all of your sins past, present, and future.
[time=1806] Very simply that's it.
[time=1808] Faith is all about believing that God will keep his promise.
[time=1812] What's his promise?
[time=1813] His promise is that if you believe in my Son, I will forgive you for your sins.
[time=1816] And when you stand before me on judgment day, I will not send you to hell, which is what we deserve.
[time=1821] I will send you to heaven, not on your works, not on your efforts, but on the work and the effort of my Son.
[time=1829] Now in this little conversation I had with the gal from our church this week, there was a question in her mind, "Well, how does that happen?" And it is somewhat, it can be somewhat nebulous.
[time=1838] I mean, it can sound kind of ethereal.
[time=1840] I want you to think about meeting a person, because when you get saved, you come into a relationship with Christ, right?
[time=1846] What do you do when you meet somebody?
[time=1849] You acknowledge their presence, you stick your hand out, and you shake their hand.
[time=1853] You embrace them.
[time=1856] We talked about the deepest, most intimate way that two people can embrace each other, the intimacy of marriage.
[time=1860] And though there's nothing sexual at all in this becoming a Christian thing, if you will think of purely the embracing that goes on between a husband and a wife and the full acceptance, the full receiving of another human being.
[time=1874] That's all it is.
[time=1876] It is a total receiving, it is an accepting, it is a greeting, it is a unifying view to
[time=1883] the person of Christ.
[time=1885] Then you do it in your heart.
[time=1886] You reach with the arms of your heart.
[time=1888] You reach out and you accept.
[time=1890] You embrace Christ.
[time=1891] And in that you are saying, "I am a sinner.
[time=1894] I am destined for hell.
[time=1895] I am worthy of the wrath of God.
[time=1897] I only can find the righteousness of God in Christ Christ.
[time=1902] Please be mine.
[time=1903] Please be my Savior.
[time=1904] I accept you.
[time=1905] I meet you.
[time=1906] I greet you." You do that in a little prayer.
[time=1908] I'll offer you an opportunity to do that at the end of the service.
[time=1910] It's a heart to heart interaction between two people, you and the person of Jesus Christ who is a resurrected living Lord who has no body physical frame that we can see at this point.
[time=1919] He is in heaven, but his spirit is omnipresent and he meets you when you seek him.
[time=1928] So that is what we do.
[time=1929] What God has done provided his son.
[time=1931] What you and I do is put faith in his son.
[time=1934] And what is the outcome?
[time=1935] What happens when a person does that?
[time=1937] What happens to Augustine and to Luther and to Wesley and this young lady this week?
[time=1942] What happens to a person when they accept Christ as their Savior?
[time=1945] Look at chapter five verse one.
[time=1948] What happens to that person is they there are at peace with God.
[time=1952] Look at it.
[time=1953] Therefore, having been justified by faith, see the point?
[time=1956] Once you put your faith in Christ, you are now justified.
[time=1959] Well, what does that do?
[time=1960] We have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1966] The consequence of coming to know Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior is peace with
[time=1972] God.
[time=1973] It's an amazing thing.
[time=1975] It's a beautiful thing.
[time=1978] And the kind of peace which I'm going to show you now is explain in the next three chapters.
[time=1982] Chapter five will give you a component of that peace.
[time=1985] Chapter six, seven, eight will explain another component.
[time=1987] What kind of peace with God?
[time=1988] What are you talking about?
[time=1990] Well, the first thing is this.
[time=1991] Being at peace with God does not mean that he solves all your problems on the day-to-day basis.
[time=1996] It does not mean that he gets you the job you need, he solves your financial problem, he heals you of your disease, he gets you the mate you've been looking for, et cetera, et cetera.
[time=2004] Look, it says in verse three, it says, and not only this, but we also exalt in our, what,
[time=2012] our tribulations, knowing that the tribulation brings about perseverance and perseverance-proven character and proven character hope.
[time=2018] And hope does not disappoint because the love of God has been shed abroad in our hearts.
[time=2022] Right away, I mean on the heels, the instant of coming to Christ and finding that you are now at peace with God, meaning your sins are forgiven past, present and future, he steps in to remind you that that peace is not some type of panacea, not some rose-bud glasses.
[time=2036] It is instead the tribulations that everybody in the world has to live through, but you get to live through it walking hand in hand with a true and living God who loves you and who has forgiven you from your sins and who will work through this tribulation to produce character in your life.
[time=2052] So it is not the easy believerism, it is not the success gospel, it is not come to Christ
[time=2060] and have all your problems solved, it is come to Christ and live through your problems in the peace of God knowing that his power resides in you.
[time=2069] But here's something else I want you to see.
[time=2071] Look at chapter seven.
[time=2074] I love this part about the peace of God.
[time=2076] Do you realize that the peace of God extends all the way to even our struggles, not with
[time=2083] the outside world, but with our own sin.
[time=2086] Member Roma, chapter seven is the chapter about Paul struggling with sin.
[time=2089] Chapter seven is the chapter where Paul says, "Even though I am a forgiven Christ follower, there are times where I still struggle with sin in deep, confusing and often unmanageable
[time=2100] ways." Look at verse 17.
[time=2103] We're now no longer am I the one doing it, but sin which indwells me.
[time=2107] The wishing of good is present in me, verse 18, but the doing of good is not, for the good that I wish I would do I don't do, but I practice the very evil that I don't want to do.
[time=2117] He says in verse 21, "I find in the principle that evil is in me and the one who wishes to do good, and though I joyfully concur with the law of God and the inner man, I see a different law in the members of my body." This is one of the great things.
[time=2130] One of the first questions that the gal had for me on Friday after she had come up from her prayer of faith, she said, "Well, okay, I understand now that I'm saved.
[time=2138] I get it, but what happens if I sin?
[time=2142] What happens if today I sin?
[time=2143] What happens if tomorrow I sin?
[time=2144] What happens if next week I sin?" And she said, "You know, I understand sometimes you sin and you didn't really plan on it.
[time=2149] It was kind of a mistake.
[time=2150] It was kind of an oops, but what about those sins that I know are sins before I do them?"
[time=2157] See, and here comes the kind of peace that God gives us.
[time=2160] And I said, "You know what?
[time=2161] God forgives you for all of your sins past, the ones you've done, the ones you're going to do today, and all the ones you're going to do tomorrow." And this smile came across her face, this sense of relief.
[time=2173] You mean, no matter what I do, from now on, I'm totally and completely forgiven because I put my faith in Christ.
[time=2178] The answer is yes.
[time=2179] You want to know how that's true?
[time=2183] Look at chapter 8, verse 31.
[time=2185] And he says this as he wraps up these three chapters about being at peace with God.
[time=2191] And now remember, he's including all the tribulation that the world can bring.
[time=2194] And he's including all the sin that a Christian can do after they're saved.
[time=2198] And he says this in verse 31, "What then shall we say to these things?" Okay, great.
[time=2203] You got trouble in the world.
[time=2204] You got trouble in your heart.
[time=2206] If God is for us, who is against this?
[time=2208] Verse 32, "He who did not spare his own son, but delivered him up for us all, how will he
[time=2214] not also with him freely give us all things?" You get it?
[time=2219] God covers everything in your life when you come to Christ.
[time=2223] He asked the question again in verse 35, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?" And he lifts off all this stuff.
[time=2229] Tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, naked, and this peril and sword.
[time=2235] Verse 37, "And all these things we are overwhelmingly conquerors through who, through Christ who loved us." And he says, "For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, or heights, or death, nor any other created thing shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus, our Lord." That's what we call the doctrine of what?
[time=2257] Eternal security.
[time=2260] The gospel is this, that sinners are given the righteousness of God through faith.
[time=2268] And they then have peace, peace with God.
[time=2273] That's some kind of love in it.
[time=2277] That is some kind of love.
[time=2280] We enjoy the peace of God.
[time=2283] Our sins are forgiven past, present, and future.
[time=2286] We have hope through our trials.
[time=2287] And when he comes to the end of the section, he says, "And by the way, if I forgot to mention anything at all, let me mention everything all at once, nothing at all can ever separate you from my love.
[time=2296] It's over.
[time=2297] It's done.
[time=2298] As Christ said on the cross, it is finished.
[time=2301] When you put your faith in Christ, nothing else needs to be done to keep you at peace
[time=2307] with God for all of eternity." Okay but the gospel is more than that.
[time=2314] Come to chapter 12 verse 1.
[time=2318] The gospel is more than that.
[time=2321] That is part of the gospel but that is not all of the gospel.
[time=2325] The gospel goes on because Paul is not done with the book.
[time=2328] And the book is all about the power of God into salvation, right?
[time=2331] And so you come to chapter 12 verse 1 and you read these words, "I urge you therefore brethren by the mercies of God." That's what he just told you about.
[time=2342] The mercies of God.
[time=2343] The mercy of God is that which takes sinners, gives them the righteousness of God through faith and then lets them live at peace with God, right?
[time=2350] Okay.
[time=2351] "I urge you therefore brethren by the mercies of God to do something.
[time=2354] I want you to present your bodies a living and a holy sacrifice acceptable to God which
[time=2360] is your spiritual service of worship.
[time=2364] Do not be verse 2 says conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable
[time=2374] and perfect." I love those first couple of words in chapter 12 verse 1 when he says, "I urge you know that's a military call, it's a call to prepare troops for battle." It's what a general would say to prepare his troops to go into battle and what are you saying this?
[time=2390] He's saying, "Join me.
[time=2392] It's an amazing love I've given you.
[time=2394] It knows no limits and no bounds.
[time=2396] It is unconditional.
[time=2397] It is a unilateral contract that I make with you that is utterly independent of how you may treat me.
[time=2402] I love you forever.
[time=2403] You are forgiven forever.
[time=2404] That is some kind of love.
[time=2407] Now I urge you, show that love, live that love to the people around you."
[time=2415] That's what he's saying.
[time=2417] He's saying, "I have loved you so fully and so freely and so completely and so sacrificially.
[time=2422] I am now inviting you to join the wonderful process of sharing that love with the people
[time=2428] around you, the saved people around you and the unsaved people around you.
[time=2433] Be like me and show a fully, freely, complete sacrificial love to the people around you
[time=2440] even as I have shown it to you." And you say, "What does that mean?" I mean, put some stuff on that little skeleton of walking around loving the people, sacrificially
[time=2450] and fully like Christ loved you.
[time=2452] Well, he does that, doesn't he?
[time=2454] The rest of the book now is just an explanation of how you act when you are a living sacrifice.
[time=2461] Having been saved freely and totally and forever by God, now live as a living sacrifice.
[time=2466] Not to keep your salvation.
[time=2467] He already covered all that.
[time=2468] You can never lose your salvation.
[time=2469] This has nothing to do with trying to earn the pleasure of God.
[time=2472] That was given to you as a free gift in Christ when you received the righteousness of God.
[time=2476] This living sacrifice stuff is now simply an act of gratitude.
[time=2482] Having seen all that God has done for me, how ought I to live?
[time=2486] What would be the appropriate response to such an awesome, incredible God?
[time=2490] Answer.
[time=2491] Live as a living sacrifice to exude the love of God to the people around you.
[time=2496] That's it.
[time=2497] That's the answer.
[time=2498] Well, what does that look like?
[time=2499] Look at chapter 12, verse 6.
[time=2500] He's going to list about six or seven different things.
[time=2503] The first thing, as we saw when we studied the book, chapter 12, verse 6 is this, "And since we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let each exercise
[time=2513] them accordingly.
[time=2514] If you've got the gift of prophecy, then make it.
[time=2516] If you've got the gift of service, then do it.
[time=2518] If you've got the gift of teaching, then teach.
[time=2520] If you've got the exhortation gift, then do it.
[time=2522] And giving.
[time=2523] And leading.
[time=2524] And mercy.
[time=2525] Be a living sacrifice.
[time=2526] Take the spiritual endowment that God has given to you and use it in the lives of other believers for the glory of God." There's just no way.
[time=2535] There's just no way that a born-again believer, having been endowed with spiritual gifts, would
[time=2542] not look into the face of a God as merciful as our God and not discover their spiritual gifts and minister them for his glory.
[time=2550] It is inconceivable.
[time=2554] And I know that some of you sit here in this category this morning.
[time=2558] You are in this church.
[time=2560] You have been saved by this great God and he has given you these miraculous gifts of ministry and you don't know what they are and you are not using them.
[time=2569] It's inconceivable.
[time=2572] He says, "Further evidence of a living sacrifice," look at verse 9, "Let love be without hypocrisy, abhor what is evil, cling to what is good." Then he says in verse 10, "Be devoted to one another in brotherly love," and he explains what that means.
[time=2585] We give preface to one another.
[time=2587] We honor one another.
[time=2588] We are diligent in our love for one another.
[time=2591] We are serving the Lord and rejoicing in hope.
[time=2595] You're saying the people around you, not as you minister your spiritual gifts, he switches to another category and he just says, "The folks around you, they ought to just experience this incredible love that I have given to you as you prefer them, as you serve them, as you honor them, as you rejoice with them." This is normal.
[time=2615] He says, "This is natural responses to having been saved by such a gracious God and Savior."
[time=2624] But it gets unnatural here.
[time=2625] Look at chapter 12, verse 14, "Bless those who persecute you, bless and curse not," look
[time=2631] at verse 20.
[time=2632] "The enemy is hungry, feed him, and if he is thirsty, give him a drink.
[time=2636] For in so doing you will heap burning coals upon his head," and you remember those are the coals of shame, which we hope will lead to his conversion.
[time=2644] In other words, we are so overwhelmed and so transformed by this God and his great mercy
[time=2650] to save us so powerfully that we treat our enemies in a certain way and we bless them
[time=2657] and we are gracious to them and we never take our own revenge and we feed them and we give
[time=2663] them drink, hoping that in this peculiar treatment they will find the bottom of their shame to
[time=2671] go back to where we started, which is to that chapter 1, 2, and 3, where they say above themselves, "I am a proud arrogant selfish sinner, and what I have done to that other person is scandalous.
[time=2681] How can I ever be forgiven?
[time=2682] Oh, it is the righteousness of God through faith." It is an amazing thing.
[time=2689] You and I are called to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which we have been called.
[time=2694] In other words, you and I are called now to walk in a manner that is worthy to the salvation with which we have been saved, or by which or through which we have been saved.
[time=2702] It doesn't stop there.
[time=2704] Look at Romans chapter 13, "We become peculiar and awed in our response to government, and unlike all the other people of the world who do not know Christ and who have their own opinion about how to handle government, and their own insurrections and their own revolutions and their own ways to rationalize the disobedience to the governing authority." You and I don't do that.
[time=2724] You and I have been so powerfully saved by a gracious and a merciful God that we do in verse 1, let every person be in subjection to the governing authorities, because there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God.
[time=2738] And we know in verse 2 that if we were to resist our government, it is as if we are resisting God Himself, do you understand?
[time=2747] We submit, we submit, we submit to injustice, we submit to mistreatment, we submit to political
[time=2754] views.
[time=2755] Well, if we have a chance, we vote and change it, but if we can't and it's law, we submit.
[time=2760] We are a people who walk peculiar before the true and living God in our response to the governing authorities.
[time=2767] Why?
[time=2768] In hopes that people will see in us the love of Christ.
[time=2772] And so as it says in verse 7 of chapter 13, we render to all what is due to them.
[time=2777] We pay our taxes, and we pay our customs, and we fear to whom fear and honor to whom honor.
[time=2783] We owe nothing to anyone, and it says in verse 8, except to love one another.
[time=2788] Because in loving our neighbor, we fulfill the law.
[time=2791] It's an amazing thing, and this is what it means to be a living sacrifice.
[time=2797] This is what it means to look in the face of a gracious and merciful God and say, "God, what do you want from me?
[time=2802] You've given me the thing I could never have earned, you gave me the most valuable thing in the world, you've given me eternal life, it cost you the life of your Son, it is the righteousness of God, it is mine through faith, I can do nothing to earn it, I can do nothing to lose it.
[time=2814] I am secure for all of eternity." What do you want?
[time=2817] Name it.
[time=2819] You say, "Jump, I say, "How high?" What can I do?
[time=2823] How can I serve you?" He says, "Well, minister, your spiritual gifts." He says, "Love the people around you, serve them." He says, "Love your enemy, love your enemy." He says, "Submit to the government, no matter who they are, no matter what they do, because they're from me, and if you don't submit to them, it's like you're not submitting to me."
[time=2849] Then he turns a corner in chapter 14 and he puts our focus off the government and he puts it back inside the church again for an amazing discussion, and he wants to talk about those who are weak in faith and those who are strong in faith, remember?
[time=2863] Verse 14, chapter 1, excuse me, chapter 14, verse 1, he says, "Now I want you to accept
[time=2869] the one who is weak in faith." See, there's people who are weak in faith, which means that they don't have a thing called Christian liberty.
[time=2877] There are things that they can't do that God hasn't said they can't do, it's not sin, it's just that in their heart they don't have a freedom to do it.
[time=2885] And there's another category of believer called the strong in faith, and this isn't the faith he gets saved by, this is just how you walk after you've been saved, and there's these strong people, and they can do lots of things, they can do almost anything that the Bible doesn't say you can't do it, they just have an unbelievable freedom.
[time=2899] Remember this whole deal about eating meat that had been offered to idols, and some people observe certain days, and some people don't observe certain days, and in the midst of this whole great discussion about how to be a living sacrifice, God takes the time out and says, "Now look, this happens inside the church in a very important and critical area." You have got to take care of each other.
[time=2919] You who are strong, do not violate those who are weak.
[time=2924] You who may have freedom to eat meat, you who may have freedom to not celebrate a certain day above another and just treat all days the same, that's great.
[time=2932] There's no problem with that.
[time=2933] There's no sin, you go ahead and have your liberty, but do it in a way that you do not hurt or bruise the weaker brother in your midst.
[time=2942] Why?
[time=2943] Look at the end of chapter verse 22, he says, "The faith which you have, in other words, if you're a strong faith person, have it as your own.
[time=2951] If you're a weak faith person, have it as your own." We're not trying to get you to switch camps.
[time=2954] The faith which you have, have as your own conviction before God.
[time=2958] Happy is he who does not condemn himself in what he approves.
[time=2961] In other words, if you're a strong faith person and you live like a strong faith person, don't change your mind, don't compromise your convictions.
[time=2968] If you're a weak faith person, then live like that and don't compromise your convictions.
[time=2973] Verse 23, "But he who doubts is condemned if he eats because his eating is not from faith and whatever is not from faith is sin." In other words, God is saying, "Honor your, be a person of integrity.
[time=2984] Live within the boundaries of your faith." Well, we come to chapter 15, we come to chapter 15 and we talk, he goes all now back about
[time=2996] the church.
[time=2998] Remember chapter 15, there were nine marks of a great church, how we treat each other,
[time=3004] we bury each other's burdens.
[time=3006] We don't distance ourselves when somebody's having a hard time, we get in there and we help.
[time=3011] Secondly, he said, "We edify one another," meaning we build each other up.
[time=3015] Then he said, "We dwell in unity together," which doesn't mean we agree on everything, it means that we disagree agreeably, we're a mature group of people and where the Bible hasn't spoken definitively and we have different opinions about the color of the carpet or about a program we may start or about an approach we're going to have over here where we live in unity.
[time=3032] We don't all have to believe the same thing about the same piece of carpet, but if that's the decision, then well, that's my favorite color too, I mean, in a sense, I support it.
[time=3039] Whatever it takes for unity, whatever it takes for unity.
[time=3042] Whatever he said then, the fourth thing, we worship together, we have extended periods of time, whereas the company of the redeemed, we give our hearts back to God in the corporate assembly, we lift its head in one accord, our voices together to God, which we've done this morning.
[time=3056] We accept one another, we admonish one another, we support one another, we pray for one another, we refresh one another, that's chapter 15, it makes us a great church.
[time=3063] In other words, what he is saying is there is a living sacrifice that you do as an individual
[time=3069] and as individuals you treat people a certain way, you honor your enemy a certain way, you submit to the government a certain way, you treat the weak or stronger brother thing, but in 15 it's kind of like he says, now collectively listen to me, there's a way that you function collectively and collectively you become a great church when you do these
[time=3086] certain things.
[time=3087] So he is very concerned, not just about our individual private lives, the gospel doesn't just address our individual private lives, the gospel addresses our corporate lives
[time=3098] and how we act together and the testimony that our church has.
[time=3104] Then you remember he closes out the book, chapter 16, and this was last week, by it's like he can't let go of this book until he has acknowledged the significant accomplishments
[time=3116] of some remarkable people.
[time=3118] And suddenly you and I discover that the gospel is all about encouragement, the gospel is all about recognizing remarkable efforts, making remarkable efforts, and those who have I guess
[time=3129] who have been living sacrifices and above and beyond the call duty sort of way get their names listed here in chapter 16.
[time=3136] And you remember there were some components that made them remarkable, it's that they were saved, they weren't just giving lip service to the gospel, they didn't just give a head as sent to the gospel, they were actually truly born again saved individuals.
[time=3147] You remember they were servants that made them remarkable, they didn't view themselves as trying to get out and distance and be away from the work and get other people to do their dirty work for them.
[time=3156] When a need was there they didn't look the other way or find excuses, they saw their whole paradigm, they saw their whole perspective as I'm here to serve other people.
[time=3164] Remember they were passionate about the church, some of them were dying, risking their necks, necks, prisca and aquila were risking their necks for the growth of the church, literally
[time=3173] almost dying.
[time=3174] Remember remarkable people he makes note of here are in the pursuit of excellence, the
[time=3180] pursuit of excellence, they are outstanding individuals and they are tested and approved,
[time=3186] they've gone through the fires and they've been found faithful.
[time=3190] So there it is, and that's the gospel.
[time=3193] The gospel is not just a prayer, the gospel is not just a Jesus please save me, the gospel
[time=3200] begins with this profound conviction of personal sin and understanding that we are under the
[time=3206] wrath of God.
[time=3209] And out of that lostness there is a focus on the person of Jesus Christ for only through
[time=3215] Him comes the very righteousness of God.
[time=3220] And how do I get that through Christ, I get that not by effort, not by work, not by beating myself up, not by moral resolutions, I get that by putting my faith in Him, I greet Him, I embrace Him, I accept Him as my Savior, as the only way for me ever to be rightly related
[time=3236] with God.
[time=3237] But having done that what happens to me, I am at peace with God, I am in total peace with God.
[time=3243] Now my life has tribulation but I am at peace with God because He walks with me through my tribulation and He grows me into the image of Christ.
[time=3251] Now my life is still full of sin and I still fail and I'm still weak and I still see things in my heart and my mind and my actions that I wish would never be there, I'm still a sinner
[time=3262] but I am at peace with God because God has forgiven me for my past, my present and my future and who can separate me from the love of God, nothing and no one.
[time=3271] I am secure in the gospel because I'm at peace with God for all of eternity no matter what I may do.
[time=3278] Wow, what kind of a life do you live after that?
[time=3283] I mean after having that kind of an encounter with the true living God, what kind of a life do you live where you live your life according to those mercies as a living sacrifice?
[time=3292] God, what do you want me to do today?
[time=3295] How do you want me to be at work?
[time=3296] How do you want me to be with my wife?
[time=3301] What do you want me to think about?
[time=3302] What do you want me to have as my motives?
[time=3304] I surrender, I surrender to that great love.
[time=3309] Anybody who would love me that way deserves my total and complete allegiance.
[time=3312] Yeah, that's right, it's called a living sacrifice and as we have noted it encompasses
[time=3318] all of our life, it's an amazing thing, so here's our sentence or probably not a sentence
[time=3324] but our 20 or less, sinners are given the righteousness of God through faith enjoying
[time=3332] peace with God as living sacrifices for His glory.
[time=3338] He did it to Augustine, he did it to Luther, he did it to Wesley, he did it to the young
[time=3346] mother last week.
[time=3349] What about you?
[time=3356] Man, if you have never ever come to know Christ as your personal Lord and Savior, if
[time=3364] it's been from here up for you and you see the whole picture of what the gospel does in people's lives and you go, "No, sorry, not me.
[time=3373] Today's your day, today's your day, I want to give you a chance to accept Jesus Christ
[time=3380] as your personal Lord and Savior, to open your heart and to embrace Him as your own."
[time=3387] So let me invite you to stand for a closing word of prayer.
[time=3395] With your heads bowed this morning and you hearing again the gospel, the gospel that
[time=3402] has the power of God in it for salvation.
[time=3408] If you have never come to receive Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior, I'm going to give you a chance to do that just by leading you in a little prayer.
[time=3417] And if you want that, if you want Christ as your Savior, then you say in your heart what
[time=3424] I'm saying with my lips, I'll pause and you can say it in your heart.
[time=3429] And if you mean it, if it's a real thing that's going on between you and Christ, between you and your Heavenly Father, then you'll be saved today.
[time=3438] You'll be saved today.
[time=3441] It goes like this.
[time=3444] My gracious God and Heavenly Father, I confess to you that I am a sinner, that I am under
[time=3454] your wrath, and that I do not today nor will I ever be able to measure up to the standard
[time=3465] of perfection.
[time=3467] I'm lost.
[time=3472] But I put my faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=3477] I reach out right here right now with the arms of my heart, and I accept Jesus as my Savior.
[time=3489] And I receive the very righteousness of God.
[time=3496] Thank you for saving me.
[time=3499] Thank you for letting me be at peace with you.
[time=3504] Thank you for forgiving me for all my sins, past, present, and future.
[time=3514] And now help me, God, to be a living sacrifice for your glory and for your honor.
