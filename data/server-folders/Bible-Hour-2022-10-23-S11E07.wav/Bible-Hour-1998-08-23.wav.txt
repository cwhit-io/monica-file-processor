[time=62] Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=66] Thank you for joining us. We trust that the music and message from God's word will help you in your Christian walk.
[time=72] Please stay tuned. Now let's join our service.
[time=75] [MUSIC - 170 seconds]
[time=260] [APPLAUSE]
[time=275] [MUSIC]
[time=297] [APPLAUSE]
[time=303] As we come into his presence and we worship him, I don't know what your state is today, whether praise is easy for you or praise is hard for you.
[time=314] Sometimes it is hard. But one thing I know, one thing that I've learned in my life, when praise is hard, let my heart lead me to the throne of grace.
[time=326] And there I find rest in his presence. So if praise is hard for you, just set your cares aside. Let your heart lead you into his presence as we sing together.
[time=340] [MUSIC - 327 seconds]
[time=692] In John 20, verse 30, he said this, "Many other signs therefore Jesus also performed in the presence of the disciples which are not written in this book." Now watch.
[time=709] But these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ or the Messiah, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name. It's a very simple theme.
[time=726] Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and that believing in him you may have eternal life. And so in the book of John, John presents seven miracles in detail. Jesus first of all, turning the water into wine. Then he cures the nobleman's son. Then he cures the paralytic. Then he feeds the 5,000, really the 20,000. Then he walks on water. Then he gives sight to the blind.
[time=753] And then he raises Lazarus from the dead. John says near the end of his book that there were many other signs which Jesus did. The seven that I've given you in this book are but a small sampling of many other things that Jesus did.
[time=770] He goes on to say, you know, if all of them were written in detail, meaning all these signs, all these miracles that Jesus did, I suppose that even the world itself would not contain the books which were written.
[time=787] John has a major theme, and the theme is this, Jesus Christ is the living son of God, and he is known to you that way by his miracles. Seven of them he gives in detail in this book.
[time=802] There is then a minor theme in the book of John, one that sits below that major theme of Christ as God. The minor theme is this, how people choose to react to this great evidence that Jesus Christ is the son of God, the Savior of the world.
[time=821] There is a minor theme, how people react to Christ. And we have been seeing that there are basically three ways that people in the day of Christ have reacted, and those same three ways are the ways that people react to Christ all through the centuries.
[time=837] First, some people choose to believe it. Some people see the evidence, they see Christ then and now, and they say, I believe it. He is God's son, the Savior of the world, and they commit their lives to Christ. They are saved.
[time=851] A second reaction is that of rejection. They see the evidence, but for whatever reason, they choose to reject that evidence, and they say, I do not believe.
[time=860] I do not believe that Jesus Christ is the true and living son of God, the only way to salvation, and so I do not accept him as my Savior.
[time=868] And then there is a third reaction among the people who encounter Christ then and now, and it is those we call the seekers.
[time=876] These are people who have not come to faith in Christ. These are people who have not made that decision to fully reject him. These are people who are asking genuine, honest questions.
[time=886] They can sense that something is going on in the spiritual dimension, and they are asking questions. They are not convinced yet either to accept him or to reject him.
[time=897] Their spiritual antennas are up and they are seeking for more information. They are seeking for more understanding.
[time=904] Now in John chapter 9, the question that is going to be addressed is this, how can people have seen all the things that they saw in Christ, all that he did, all that he said, and all that he was, and not believe in him?
[time=921] How can people reject Christ? This in part is what John 9 is all about. It's about being blind. It's about being spiritually blind.
[time=934] The word of God talks about people who reject Christ, and one of the main reasons that they reject Christ is because they are spiritually blind.
[time=944] These Pharisees, the spiritually blind this morning, were with Christ, and they saw him, and they saw him do these many miracles, but they could not see the significance of those miracles about him and the relevance of him to their lives.
[time=961] They had all the data, but it didn't add up in their minds. It's called spiritual blindness. The Bible talks about it in Isaiah chapter 59, 10, people who do not understand the spiritual truth about God and about Christ say it this way.
[time=976] We grope along the wall like blind men. We grope like those who have no eyes. We stumble at midday as if it were twilight.
[time=987] Here are people in the brilliant light of the miracles of Christ, and it's light everywhere, but for them they're blind, and so they stumble as though it were dark, because they cannot see that light.
[time=1000] They see the miracles, but the spiritual content of the truth of those miracles does not penetrate their hearts.
[time=1007] In the New Testament the Bible addresses spiritual blindness. It says this about people who don't accept Christ.
[time=1014] And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing. In other words, the gospel doesn't make sense to these people. They reject Christ. They reject the gospel because it's veiled to them. They can't really see it with spiritual eyesight.
[time=1031] You say, "Why are they blind? Why can't they see?" The next verse answers that. In whose case the God of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving, that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ who is the image of God.
[time=1049] Satan himself sets up situations in which people do not therefore see clearly the person of Christ and the significance of who he is and what he did on the cross to save them from their sins.
[time=1064] Now that may sound strange to you, but I want you to know it's not strange.
[time=1069] You don't have to be some weird wackos spiritual person to understand that in many cases you can look at something and not recognize what it is you're seeing.
[time=1081] I happen to hunt and I am amazed at this thing called camouflage and I can stand on the very hip of a well-trained pointer out in the field who is looking and seeing and smelling within two feet of his nose a pheasant that's about this big.
[time=1101] I can stand on his very hip and look right off his nose at the very direction and not see what he sees because the bird is perfectly camouflaged in its environment and it isn't until that bird breaks and moves that I even see it.
[time=1115] Interesting, the dog sees in black and white we believe and so camouflage means nothing to him because he doesn't see in color, he sees in black and white.
[time=1123] I have a problem, the bird is in color, I see in color, I cannot see what I'm looking at.
[time=1130] It happens all the time, it happens that way, it happens in another way called paradigms.
[time=1135] You remember the story I told you some years ago, in 1960 in Switzerland they were king of the watch, they were the watch kings, they were the time keepers of the world.
[time=1145] They had 65% of the world market in watches and they had 80% of the profits worldwide, they were king of time, Switzerland.
[time=1157] Back in the early 60s they had a research development team that they themselves paid for to get out on the cutting edge to make sure they never lost their dominance of the time keeping industry.
[time=1167] Some of their scientists in Luzon, Switzerland came back and said you know we've invented a new way to keep time, it's called the quartz movement.
[time=1174] It's called the quartz movement it's a hundred times less expensive to do, it's a thousand times more accurate in terms of the time itself and they presented it to the executives who ran these powerful time keeping corporations in Switzerland, Rolex among them.
[time=1193] And they couldn't see what they were looking at because the executives had a paradigm, you keep time with a mainspring and bearings and watches tick.
[time=1206] And what you are showing us in quartz movement has no mainspring because it doesn't and it has no bearings, nothing's moving in there and nothing ticks.
[time=1217] And so they couldn't see what they were looking at, they didn't even bother to patent it.
[time=1224] This invention that their own money and their own research and development people had developed and so later at an international trade show, they put it out on a table as a novelty quartz movement.
[time=1238] And some guys from a little company then called Texas Instrument and some other guys from a little company then called Seiko.
[time=1248] They looked and they understood what they saw and the rest is history. Within ten years Switzerland only had 10% of the watch market in the world and they had laid off 60,000 employees.
[time=1264] It's very easy isn't it to be blind. It's very easy for you to buy into certain principles, watches have mainspring, bearings and they tick and having bought into those principles you become blind to another way of doing that.
[time=1280] When the text says that in there in 2 Corinthians 4 that Satan has blinded the minds of the unbelieving, you don't have to believe in some wackos supernatural spiritual thing that happens out in another world.
[time=1291] All you have to understand are the principles of camouflage, the principles of buying into a paradigm that says it happens this way and suddenly you're blind and you can't really see or understand what you're looking at.
[time=1307] The Pharisees couldn't see. They had certain presuppositions, they had certain paradigms. When they looked at Jesus they said he has no mainspring, he has no bearings, he doesn't tick, he's certainly not the Messiah.
[time=1326] Now in John chapter 9 you're going to meet a guy, he's blind. Now he's not blind because of a paradigm problem, he's blind. He's actually physically blind. In fact the text tell us he was blind from birth, he had never seen anything, he had never seen anyone, he had never seen a sunset, he had never seen a sunrise, he had never seen a lake, he had never seen wheat or grain or a piece of cloth, he'd never seen anything in his entire life.
[time=1352] And in John chapter 9 you're going to see that Jesus heals this man and restores his sight, his physical sight. And then the man, by being the recipient of this incredible miracle, he not only gets physical sight, but he gets spiritual sight and he recognizes that the man who healed him is also the Christ.
[time=1373] And so the man born blind not only gets physical sight, he gets spiritual sight and you'll see by the end of the morning that he is now saved and he worships Christ as his Savior.
[time=1384] You're going to meet a second group of people this morning in John chapter 9 and they are the spiritually blind.
[time=1390] Their eyes work fine, they're physical eyes, they're great eyesight, 20/20 I guess many of them. And they could see Jesus and they could see his miracles but they never got the point.
[time=1402] Again, no mainspring, no bearings, didn't tick. And the drama, the drama of this particular chapter is to watch a physically blind but spiritually sighted man interact with physically seeing but spiritually blind individuals.
[time=1419] The irony is amazing, the metaphor is convincing and powerful and persuasive. A guy with no eyes but he's got a heart that can see in contrast to guys with perfect eyes but hearts that can't see.
[time=1435] And Jesus throws them in the mix so that you and I can try to get a grip on who Jesus is and how people react to him.
[time=1446] I want to give you this text and two main points this morning. First I want to look at the miracle and then secondly I want to look at people's reactions to the miracle.
[time=1454] The miracle begins up in chapter 8 verse 59, look at it, therefore they picked up stones to throw at Christ but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple.
[time=1461] You remember from last week Jesus was in the temple, he was teaching, they threw a woman caught in the very active adultery in front of them.
[time=1467] He masterably orchestrated the situation, sent her accusers away and gave her forgiveness. And as the dialogue went on those who remained became so angry at him and so upset at him that he would dare say that he was the son of God that they were trying to stone him right there in the temple.
[time=1488] Remember now Jesus is on a divine timetable and he's not going to die before he's supposed to and that's about six months away from now and so he does this vanishing act all over again.
[time=1496] There it is verse 59 chapter 8, they picked up stones to throw at him but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple.
[time=1502] Now as he is fleeing out of the temple verse 1 of chapter 9 he passes by and he sees a blind man, a man blind born from birth, congenital blindness.
[time=1513] Happened all the time, happens today and we're much better at discovering it and preventing it but it was rampant in the ancient world.
[time=1520] Now as disciples are with him verse 2 and they ask kind of a theological question which Jesus doesn't really want to talk about.
[time=1526] He says and his disciples asked him saying Rabbi who sinned this man or his parents that he should have been born blind and this just, I don't have time this morning but they either thought that if you had a bad physical defect it was because you had done something bad and God had punished you for that
[time=1540] or your parents had done something bad and God was punishing you for the sins of your parents and I don't want to go into that, listen to Jesus answer verse 3.
[time=1547] Jesus answered it was neither that this man sinned nor his parents.
[time=1552] I'll tell you why he's blind, he's blind in order that the works of God might be displayed in him.
[time=1559] Verse 4, we must work the works of him who sent me as long as it is day, night is coming when no man can work while I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
[time=1568] In other words this man you say is this fair, this poor man born blind never seen anything in all of his life and you're telling me that God did that to him just so Jesus could work a miracle on him is that fair and my answer is no it's not fair it's an incredible privilege.
[time=1583] Unbelievable privilege this man has the privilege of being the very person through whom Jesus Christ will in this setting put on display that he is in fact the true and living God.
[time=1595] Well look at verses 6 and 7.
[time=1599] When Christ had said this he spat on the ground, saliva I don't know why saliva saliva in this ancient day was sometimes thought to have medicinal purposes.
[time=1608] He spat on the ground and made some clay, had enough saliva going there with some dirt and got some clay going on and he applies it to this man's eyes.
[time=1618] Verse 7 and he says to the man go wash in the pool of Siloam which is translated sent and so he went away and washed and this is an amazing little phrase and he came back seeing.
[time=1631] This is a full-fledged bonafide five-star miracle.
[time=1636] Do you realize when it says that he came back seeing you'll see as you progress in the text it means he came back seeing and that doesn't just mean that if you know anything about congenital blindness it doesn't just mean that he could receive light into his eyes.
[time=1647] It meant as you will see that he could recognize what he was looking at.
[time=1654] Back in the 1800s in France when the eye kind of progress medically with blindness was making some huge strides Dr. Defue I think you call his name 1850 in Paris.
[time=1666] Did some phenomenal work with congenital blind people and he had developed a procedure by which those who had been born blind were able to be given sight.
[time=1675] And because they were scientists and marvelously gifted individuals they not only worked on the procedure but they wanted to probe into the minds of people who had been born blind and how much did they really know and how much did they really understand.
[time=1688] And what shocked them and what so surprised them was among other things that when you give a person who has been born blind their sight they have no idea what they're looking at.
[time=1700] Oh they can see but they don't know what it is even though in their blind state they were completely familiar with it.
[time=1708] He tells of one girl who was showed a cross, a cross.
[time=1714] He says this I showed her a brown cross on a white ground so the contrast was brilliant when she was supposed to see the cross.
[time=1721] She gave the color, length and breadth and also the shape approximately but not the name cross.
[time=1728] I made her trace the shape with her finger but she dissected the cross into a long perpendicular and then a spike over here and a spike over there.
[time=1739] After I had many times guided her hand first down and then a cross from left to right over and over where the lines actually crossed and produced an imitation of the sign of the cross.
[time=1754] He says which interestingly she had made upon herself hundreds of times in her blind state.
[time=1762] It eventually occurred to her that the brown figure was actually a cross and by this discovery she was endlessly delighted and by every other such discovery she made.
[time=1774] This man was so healed by Christ that Christ not only gave him back his eyesight but he went the next step in the healing process and gave him the ability to recognize what he was actually looking at.
[time=1787] Unlike normal healings when people were blind and now they can see but they have no idea.
[time=1794] Another girl named Joan she learned to use her eyes she found that almost nothing was really the way her hands had told her it was when she was blind.
[time=1802] She was confounded by the discovery that each new person who was brought in to see her had an entirely different face.
[time=1810] Wonder of wonders. She had thought that all faces were very much alike except that some were rounder and some were longer.
[time=1822] That's how Jesus always healed. Jesus didn't heal sequentially, Jesus didn't heal partially, Jesus didn't heal in stages, Jesus healed completely and totally and instantly.
[time=1834] As is evidenced by this and other miracles there's a guy in John 5 who had been lame for 38 years.
[time=1842] Never been able to walk for 38 years Jesus said to him in John 5 verses 7 and 9 take up your pallet of walk and the text says and immediately the man became well, how well.
[time=1853] He took up his pallet and began to walk. Now people, friends and neighbors when somebody has been doing nothing and completely immobilized for 38 years.
[time=1863] You can fix whatever it was that wasn't working right but they are in a highly compromised state and it takes all kinds of physical therapy
[time=1873] and coordination efforts and all kinds of time and the best of medical care before the person can stand much almost a little walk away.
[time=1883] When Jesus healed he healed completely and totally and that's exactly how he healed this man the man came back seeing.
[time=1890] And as I say the rest of this text will show you and he not only saw, he saw.
[time=1896] Now let's go to the reactions of the people.
[time=1900] First of all there are the neighbors in verses 8 to 12 follow along.
[time=1903] The neighbors therefore and those who previously saw him as a beggar, he was by the way not only blind but in that culture very little care was given to the blind as was God's intention.
[time=1912] The Old Testament says to care for them but this culture was hard-hearted and so he was a beggar, he was a blind beggar.
[time=1919] Verse 8, they were saying is not this the one who used to sit and beg.
[time=1923] Others were saying this is he, still others were saying no, he just looks like him.
[time=1928] He kept saying no no I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the blind beggar, it's me.
[time=1933] Verse 10 therefore they were saying to him how then were your eyes opened?
[time=1938] And he answered the man who was called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and said to me go to Siloam and wash so I went away and I washed and I received sight.
[time=1946] And they said to him where is he? He said I don't know, get it?
[time=1951] I was blind when he sent me over there and I got eyes and he wasn't there.
[time=1955] How do I know where he is?
[time=1957] What I find amazing in this text is these people show absolutely no excitement and no joy over the fact that this guy can see.
[time=1966] They don't give a rip that this guy is going through the most exciting transition of his life, well so far.
[time=1976] The next one comes at the end of the chapter.
[time=1979] Now I want you to see the second group of people who interact with him and look at verse 13 and following, they meaning the neighbors.
[time=1986] They brought to the Pharisees him who was formerly blind. Now it was a Sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.
[time=1995] Talk more about that in a minute, verse 15.
[time=1997] Again therefore the Pharisees also were asking him how he received his side and he said to them, oh here we go.
[time=2003] Okay he applied clay to my eyes and I washed and I see.
[time=2007] Verse 16.
[time=2008] Therefore some of the Pharisees were saying this man is not from God because he does not keep the Sabbath.
[time=2015] In other words, some of these Pharisees had added so much junk to the Old Testament keeping of the Sabbath which God had intended for man's good.
[time=2023] And they had made it a legalistic ritualistic thing where you couldn't do any work on the Sabbath, you couldn't even light a lamp on the Sabbath.
[time=2029] You couldn't pick up any grain, you couldn't make any food, you couldn't do anything on the Sabbath.
[time=2035] They thought that was godliness.
[time=2037] And so these legalistic Pharisees immediately reject Christ because he had the audacity to heal a man which is work on the Sabbath.
[time=2049] Wish I had more time to develop that but I don't.
[time=2052] Look at the middle of verse 16 but others were saying how can a man who as a sinner perform such shines and they're saying if you think that he's a sinner because he healed somebody on the Sabbath then you've got a bigger problem.
[time=2064] How is it that a sinner can't do these miracles?
[time=2068] Obviously, something's wrong and understanding of the Sabbath is what they mean.
[time=2072] The end of verse 16 and there was a division among them.
[time=2075] So here's this split again of the people.
[time=2077] And Jesus is very divisive.
[time=2079] You either believe him or you reject him.
[time=2082] And obviously what's happening here is some of these Pharisees are saying we reject him, we do not believe in him and others are saying time out.
[time=2089] I think I believe.
[time=2093] Now this next part is heart wrenching, verses 17 and following.
[time=2097] They get his parents involved.
[time=2099] Verse 17, they said therefore to the blind man, again, now what do you say about him since he opened your eyes?
[time=2107] And he said, well, he's a prophet.
[time=2110] The Jews, otherwise known as the Pharisees, therefore did not believe it of him.
[time=2116] That he had been blind and had received sight until they called the parents of the very one who had received his sight.
[time=2123] See, the Pharisees were thinking this is a hoax.
[time=2125] This guy wasn't ever really blind.
[time=2127] And they're just saying that he got his sight from Jesus.
[time=2129] So we're going to confirm that this guy was truly born blind.
[time=2131] How can we do that?
[time=2132] Well, we'll go get his parents.
[time=2133] So they go get his parents.
[time=2134] Verse 19, they questioned his parents.
[time=2136] Is this your son who was born blind?
[time=2138] Then how does he set?
[time=2140] And then how does he now see?
[time=2141] Verse 20, his parents answered and said to him, well, we know that this is our son.
[time=2145] And we know that our son was born blind.
[time=2149] Verse 21, but how he now sees, we do not know.
[time=2154] Or who opened his eyes?
[time=2156] We do not know.
[time=2157] Ask him.
[time=2158] He is of age.
[time=2159] He shall speak for himself.
[time=2161] This is what's tragic.
[time=2162] Look at verse 22.
[time=2163] His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews.
[time=2167] For the Jews had already agreed that if anyone should confess him to be Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
[time=2174] And for this reason, his parents said he is of age.
[time=2178] Ask him.
[time=2179] They won't even stand with their son.
[time=2183] See, to be desynagogued, in this tight culture, when you got desynagogued, when you got thrown
[time=2189] out of the synagogue, it meant you were out of business.
[time=2192] You couldn't do business with Jewish people anymore.
[time=2194] It meant that you were completely out of the social, national celebration scene.
[time=2199] You couldn't do the feast.
[time=2201] You didn't get invited to any more parties anymore.
[time=2203] And worse, when you got desynagogued, not true, but the Pharisees told you that if you died
[time=2210] desynagogued, you would go straight to hell for all of eternity.
[time=2215] And these people, these parents, were not going to get desynagogued, even though, think of it,
[time=2221] even though their son, who had been born blind, was standing in front of them saying, "Hi!
[time=2228] It's me, and Jesus healed me." It's tragic.
[time=2236] It's really tragic.
[time=2238] Verse 24.
[time=2240] So a second time, they called the man who had been blind and said to him, "Now listen, bud,
[time=2246] give glory to God." We know that this man, meaning Jesus, is a sinner, right?
[time=2252] They're revving him up now.
[time=2253] Okay, you lie to us the first time, you lie to us the second time.
[time=2256] I want you to give glory to God.
[time=2257] Tell the truth this time.
[time=2258] We already know what we know.
[time=2260] You just agree with what we know.
[time=2262] Give glory to God.
[time=2263] We know this man is a sinner.
[time=2265] Verse 25.
[time=2266] You like this guy a lot.
[time=2267] He therefore answered, "Well, whether he is a sinner, I don't know.
[time=2272] I mean, I can't speak intelligently of the sin habits of Jesus.
[time=2276] One thing I do know, that whereas I was blind, now I see."
[time=2283] They said, "Therefore to him, well, what did he do to you?
[time=2287] How did he open your eyes?" He answered them and said, "I told you already.
[time=2292] And you did not listen.
[time=2294] Why do you want to have me say it again?
[time=2297] Do you want to become his disciples too?" And this guy's bold.
[time=2302] This guy's been healed and he can see what these guys are about.
[time=2306] Now listen, verse 28, and they reviled him and they said, "You are his disciple."
[time=2312] But we are disciples of Moses.
[time=2315] We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where he is from.
[time=2323] Verse 30.
[time=2324] The blind man that now sees answered and said to him, "Well, here's an amazing thing that you do not know where he is from, and yet he opened my eyes.
[time=2335] We know that God does not hear sinners, but if anyone is God-fearing and does his will, he hears him." Verse 32, "Since the beginning of time, it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a person born blind.
[time=2349] If this man were not from God, he could do nothing." Wow.
[time=2355] I've got to take a minute with that.
[time=2357] You've got to understand some things about that.
[time=2360] Did you hear what he said?
[time=2363] "Since the beginning of time, it has never been heard that anyone ever opened the eyes of a person born blind." Help you understand this.
[time=2370] Look all you want in the Old Testament.
[time=2372] You will never find a miracle which gives a person who was born blind their sight.
[time=2378] This is the first one.
[time=2384] You say, "What's the big deal about that, Russell?" In the Old Testament, there were many predictions for the people who lived in this day and us as to who this Jesus was going to be, what the Messiah was going to look like.
[time=2398] And in the Old Testament, one of the unique ministries of the Messiah is that he would give sight to the blind.
[time=2407] Thousands of years before Jesus ever walked, the Old Testament said, "You will know your Messiah because he will be the one who gives sight to the blind." It says it in Isaiah 28, 18.
[time=2417] And on that day, out of their gloom and darkness, the eyes of the blind shall see.
[time=2423] Isaiah 35.5, "Then the eyes of the blind will be opened and the ears of the death will be unstopped." Isaiah 42, Isaiah 42 verse 7 says, "To opened blind eyes
[time=2435] to bring out prisoners from the dungeon and those who dwell in darkness from the prison." These are all Old Testament predictions which tell unequivocally that the Messiah can be known to you because he will be the one to open blind eyes and to bring out prisoners from the darkness of that dungeon and those who dwell in darkness from that prison.
[time=2455] You will know it's him because he will do all kinds of miracles, but there will be one that he will do that should tip you off more than any other when somebody comes into your town and starts giving the blind sight.
[time=2470] You'll know you've got your Messiah.
[time=2475] Want to know something about the life of Jesus?
[time=2480] There are more recorded healings by Jesus in the Gospels, giving sight to the blind than any other miracle.
[time=2491] You get a pen and a paper and you read through all four Gospels and you put down a little notch for a when he healed the lame guy and when he put the withered hand back and when he did this and when he did that and when he walked to the water and how many times did all that stuff and you'll find there's this big category called Jesus gave sight to the blind.
[time=2506] In Matthew 9, 27, two blind men who were following him crying for mercy on us, so son of David.
[time=2513] It says there that Jesus touched their eyes and they were healed.
[time=2517] In Matthew 12, 22, it says they brought to him a demon-possessed man who was blind and dumb and he healed him so that he spoke and he saw.
[time=2524] In Matthew 15, 30, it says a great multitude came to him, bearing with them those who were lame, crippled, blind, dumb and many others and they laid down before him at his feet and he healed them all.
[time=2534] In Matthew 21, 14, and the blind and the lame came to him in the temple and he healed them.
[time=2539] In Mark 822, there was a man in Bessadia.
[time=2541] Jesus took him by the hand and let him out of the village and spitting in the man's eyes and laying hands on the man he restored his sight.
[time=2548] Mark 1046, Bartimaeus of Jericho, who, hearing that Jesus, the Nazarene, was walking by began to cry out and say, "Jesus, son of David," guess what that is, that's a title of the Messiah.
[time=2558] "Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me and the crowd began to sternly tell him to shut up, but Jesus called for him and restored his sight." Luke 721 at that time, he cured many people of diseases and afflictions and evil spirits and then it says this, and he granted sight to the many who were blind.
[time=2581] That is why when John the Baptist sent two of his disciples to ask "Jesus, are you the expected one or do we look for another?" Jesus responded and said this, "Go and report to John what you have seen and heard, the blind, the blind receive sight."
[time=2601] The lame walk, the leopard or cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised
[time=2607] and the poor have the gospel preached to them.
[time=2612] Now do you understand what this blind beggar was saying to these highly educated in the law, people listened to it again in verse 30 and following, the man answered and said, "Well, here is an amazing thing that you do not know where he is from and yet he opened my eyes." He is saying, "You idiots, read Isaiah a few times.
[time=2632] You've memorized it. Why don't you try reading it?
[time=2635] Don't you know that one of the tale-tale signs of the true Messiah is that he opens people's eyes?" And then he just drives the dagger in and says this, "Since the beginning of time it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a person born blind."
[time=2654] And their reaction was to fall down, repent, worship and come to Christ.
[time=2658] Nope, Traverse 34.
[time=2662] They threw him out.
[time=2665] They answered and said to him, "You were born entirely in your sins and you are teaching us and they put him out." They literally physically threw him out of the synagogue and with that they de-synagogued him which means they in their minds sent him to hell.
[time=2686] An amazing thing.
[time=2689] Look at verses 35 and 38, I love this.
[time=2692] Jesus heard that they had put him out and he found him.
[time=2696] Jesus seeks the seeker.
[time=2700] Jesus hunts down the man and he said to him, "Do you believe in the Son of Man?" Verse 36, well he answered and said, "Well, who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?" And Jesus said to him, "Now remember this guy has never seen Jesus, right?
[time=2713] One time he encountered Jesus he was blind, got some stuff on his eyes, went to the pool of Shalom, got to see, he never seen Jesus." What do you mean, "Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?" In verse 37, Jesus said to him, "You have both seen him and he is the one who was talking with you.
[time=2727] It's me.
[time=2728] I'm here.
[time=2729] I'm your Lord." And the blind man who now saw said this, "Lord, I believe."
[time=2736] And I love this little phrase and he worshiped him.
[time=2740] And he worshiped him.
[time=2746] The seeker comes to Christ.
[time=2751] I want to wrap it up here.
[time=2753] Got a few minutes.
[time=2754] And by way of conclusion I want to say a few words about disbelief.
[time=2758] And then I want to say a few words about hope, of encouragement, to those of you with us today who are seeking.
[time=2765] And then I want to say a few words to you who believe.
[time=2768] First of all, words about disbelief.
[time=2771] Do you realize that people who don't see spiritually don't know that they don't see spiritually?
[time=2779] Did you understand that?
[time=2781] There are a lot of people out there who are spiritually blind to the fact that God is the creator of heaven and earth, that we are sinners, who have violated His holy law and in need of a Savior.
[time=2791] That's spiritual sight.
[time=2792] The beginning of spiritual...
[time=2793] There's a lot of people out there that we mingle with every day who have no idea they don't see that.
[time=2797] They don't know they're blind.
[time=2801] This great Dr. Defue back in Paris, 1850, tells of a girl who only discovers at the age of twelve that she differs from other people in lacking a sense and now seeks to discover
[time=2813] the nature of the unknown sense.
[time=2815] This girl's twelve years old, she's blind from birth, and it isn't until she's twelve that she even figures out that there's a thing called sight.
[time=2824] That'd be easy to do, right?
[time=2825] If you've never experienced it, how would you know what's there?
[time=2826] Here's a little experiment.
[time=2827] She says this in her diary, "I posed myself a host of questions about this new and unknown state which has been described to me and did my best to come to terms with it.
[time=2836] In order to satisfy my doubt, I had the idea of trying a strange experiment.
[time=2840] One morning I again put on a dress which I had not worn for some time because I had been growing so rapidly then from month to month, and thus attired, I suddenly showed
[time=2850] myself at the door of the atrium in which my governess was working.
[time=2856] I stood listening, she says, "Good heavens, Lucy," she said, "Why have you put on that old dress that only reaches to your knees?" The blind girl says, "I merely uttered a few idle words and withdrew."
[time=2870] That was enough to convince me that without laying a hand upon me, Martha had immediately been able to recognize that I had again put on a dress that was too short.
[time=2879] So this was seeing.
[time=2881] I gradually recounted in my memory a multitude of things which must have been daily seen in the same fashion by the people about me and which could not have been known to them in any other way.
[time=2892] I did not and the least understand how this happened, but I was at last persuaded that it was happening, and this led gradually to a complete transformation of my ideas.
[time=2901] I admitted to myself that there was in fact a highly important difference of organization between myself and other people, whereas I could make contact with them by touch and
[time=2912] hearing.
[time=2913] They were bound to me through an unknown sense which entirely surrounded me even from a distance that followed me about it penetrated through me and somehow held me in its power from morning until night.
[time=2925] What a strange power this was, she says, to which I was subjected against my will without for my part being able to exercise it over anyone at all.
[time=2935] It made me shy and uneasy to begin with.
[time=2938] I felt envious about it.
[time=2939] I seemed to rise and raise an impenetrable screen between society and myself.
[time=2945] I felt unwillingly compelled to regard myself as an exceptional being that had as it were
[time=2952] to hide itself in order to live.
[time=2955] That's an amazing statement.
[time=2961] If there's any parallel beyond the truth of this text to the people who are spiritually blind, you and I have to begin to recognize that a lot of them don't even know they're blind, and those who are getting the notion that they are blind are oftentimes highly intimidated by that recognition and want to retreat and hide themselves in order to live.
[time=2982] A second observation about disbelief is that they don't always see the great advantage of seeing.
[time=2989] There are some who in these experiments would come to the recognition that there's a sense called sight that they don't have, and some would long for sight and others would mitigate
[time=2998] it.
[time=2999] One such man says this, before he was couched, he expected, in other words, before he could
[time=3006] actually have seen, before the operation, he expected little advantage from seeing, worth undergoing an operation for, except maybe reading and writing, for he said he thought he could have no more pleasure in walking abroad than he already had in the garden as a blind man, which he could do safely and readily anyway, and even blindness he observed
[time=3026] had this advantage that he could go anywhere in the dark much better than those who could see.
[time=3032] Do you realize that those among us who do not have spiritual sight, the spiritually blind,
[time=3038] some of them don't even know there is a thing called spiritual sight, and some of those who have come to know there is spiritual sight, but don't have it themselves yet, keep themselves retreated from us for fear of this insightful penetration, and then also have a tendency
[time=3053] to poo-poo the notion that life would even be better with it.
[time=3059] Interesting, disbelief.
[time=3062] Now let me say something to those of you who are seekers, you don't believe yet, you're
[time=3070] not convinced, we honor that, we're so thankful that you continue to expose yourself to God's
[time=3077] Word.
[time=3078] Let me give you a word of encouragement, Helen Keller, who we knew grew up blind, deaf, and unable to speak, and her autobiography, Helen Keller, records the endless days of anticipation and despair waiting for someone to draw her out.
[time=3090] Now keep in mind, Helen Keller, not only was blind, but she was deaf, and she was moot.
[time=3096] She's locked up, and in her autobiography she talks about the endless days of anticipation in others where it was just total despair waiting for somebody to come and draw her out.
[time=3107] She described it as though she was a great ship heading for a harbor but lost in a dense fog, quote, "as if a tangible light darkness had shut me in.
[time=3116] I was like that ship before my education began, only I was without compass or sounding line." In other words, I had no way to navigate the darkness, I had no way of knowing how near the harbor was, light she cried out, light give me light was the wordless cry of my soul.
[time=3134] She couldn't cry out.
[time=3137] In this autobiography she described the day she first met the person who would do just that her soon to become lifelong friend and teacher Annie Sullivan.
[time=3147] This tender meeting between teacher and pupil happened on March 3, 1887, it was the turning point of course in Helen's life.
[time=3154] Listen to what she says.
[time=3158] I felt approaching footsteps.
[time=3161] I stretched out my hand as I supposed it to my mother.
[time=3166] Helen took it.
[time=3167] I was caught up and held close in the arms of her who had come to reveal all things to
[time=3173] me and more than all things to love me.
[time=3181] Speaking of that day she says, "I learned a great many new words that day." Her teacher began by running water over her hand and writing water over and over in her
[time=3192] palm and she finally for the first time in her life made a connection between that sense and the notion of language.
[time=3200] Never before had she had any connection or way to think that there was a thing called language.
[time=3205] She said, "I learned a great many new words that day.
[time=3207] I do not remember what they all were but I do know that mother and father and sister and teacher were among them, words that were to make the world blossom for me."
[time=3217] It would have been difficult to find a happier child than I was as I lay in my bed at the close of that eventful day and lived over the joys it had brought me and for the first time, listen to this, and for the first time longed for a new day to come.
[time=3236] You who are seeking, you who sense, you who long, you who wish you could get past the seeking
[time=3243] to the person even as did Helen Keller.
[time=3248] The role that little Annie Sullivan played in your life is the role that Christ ultimately wants to play in your life and the role he's asking some of those he loves to play in your life.
[time=3258] There are people who love you, there are people who are pursuing you, there are people who are taking your hand and sticking it under water and by the testimony of their life they're writing Christ on your hand over and over and over and over and over again in the hopes that you will break out and finally come through the season of blindness.
[time=3276] And ultimately it's Jesus who humped you down.
[time=3280] Remember what he said in Matthew 18, he says, "What do you think?
[time=3283] If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go and search for the one that is straying?
[time=3290] And if it turns out he finds it, truly I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray.
[time=3299] Thus it is not the will of your father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish." I don't know where you are on your pilgrimage, I don't know where you are on this thing we call seeking but I can guarantee you you are not the only one seeking.
[time=3314] Jesus Christ is seeking you.
[time=3320] He is seeking you like he would seek one sheep who is lost from his fold of a hundred and when he finds you and when you find him there will be great rejoicing.
[time=3332] Now a final word to you who believe.
[time=3337] Listen to 1 Thessalonians chapter 5, it says this, "But you brother and you believers, but you brother and are not in darkness, that the day should overtake you like a thief for
[time=3348] you are all sons of light and sons of day.
[time=3353] We are not of night or of darkness.
[time=3356] You and I are the ones who can see my friends.
[time=3358] Do you realize what that means?
[time=3362] You and I have the possibility of being the any-syllivans to the spiritual Helen Kellers of this world.
[time=3368] We are in many ways there only hope.
[time=3371] And for us to witness to them doesn't mean we brashly and boldly talk at them about Jesus.
[time=3381] Somebody said this, "To be a witness does not consist in engaging in propaganda nor even in stirring people up, but in being a living mystery." Think back on the blind girl.
[time=3392] But being a living mystery, being a witness means to live in such a way that no one's life, excuse me, means to live in such a way that one's life would not make sense if God
[time=3403] did not exist.
[time=3406] You and I have our greatest witness in the lives of the spiritually blind around us when the you and I live in a way that if there were no spiritual sight and there were no Christ and there were no God there would be no way to make any sense of our life.
[time=3420] They can conduct their own experiments about this thing called spiritual sight as they test
[time=3428] our reactions to the circumstances of our lives.
[time=3433] Paul said it this way in Acts 26 he said, "Delivering you," he says, "I was sent to
[time=3440] you to open your eyes," talking about his call to evangelism, "to open your eyes so
[time=3446] that you may turn from darkness to light and from the dominion of Satan to God in order
[time=3452] that you may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified
[time=3458] by faith in Christ." There it is.
[time=3463] There it is.
[time=3466] Well, let me invite you to stand as we close our service in prayer.
[time=3475] If you would just bow your head for a minute.
[time=3478] Again, I want to talk to the seeker and all I want to say to you this morning and I have
[time=3487] a different prayer for you this morning.
[time=3489] Sometimes I invite you to pray the prayer of salvation and this morning I want to invite you to pray a slightly different prayer.
[time=3498] I want to invite you to pray a prayer where you ask Jesus to open your eyes so that you
[time=3505] can see.
[time=3507] I want to lead you in the kind of prayer that that man in Bassadia did where he cried out, "Jesus, son of David, give me sight."
