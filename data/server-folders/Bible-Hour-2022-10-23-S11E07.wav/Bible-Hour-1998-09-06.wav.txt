[time=30] And what in the world would it take?
[time=43] I mean, what would Mark Maguire have to do, or so-show, or any other person now hailed in our press as a national hero, the kings of home runs?
[time=52] What would they have to do to within a week's time take all of this publicity and all these
[time=59] applause and all of these accolades and all the love and all the adoration that is going their way, what would they have to do to within seven days' time have the populace of America
[time=70] crying out, not just for them to be banished from baseball forever, not just that they
[time=77] should be put in prison, but that they should be executed?

[time=719] Well let me invite you this morning to open your Bible to John chapter 12, John chapter 12
[time=734] and we have been in what has become this week a six week series entitled Lessons in the Life of
[time=741] Jesus and this is our last installment and with the beginning of next week and our focus on a rise and build the great endeavor we have as a church to raise about two million dollars for
[time=752] a new building we'll change from our study of the book of John and begin to preach along the lines
[time=759] of building a building but this morning we come to John chapter 12 and to help you appreciate what
[time=765] is happening in John 12 and the rest of this book I want to ask you a little question what in the world would it take I mean what would Mark McGuire have to do or so show or any other person
[time=776] now hailed in our press as a national hero the kings of home runs what would they have to do
[time=782] to within a week's time take all of this publicity and all of these applause and all these accolades
[time=790] and all the love and all the adoration that is going their way what would they have to do to within seven days time have the populace of America crying out not just for them to be banished from baseball
[time=803] forever not just that they should be put in prison but that they should be executed think about it
[time=812] I mean what would they have to do what astonishing criminal deed what they have to perform that would
[time=818] turn such incredible excitement and enthusiasm and love and adoration and appreciation into hatred
[time=826] to the level that the people are crying out we want him dead we want him to be executed
[time=833] the same question could be asked of our president after all he's done after all he's
[time=840] been involved in after all he's confessed to his ratings remain remarkably high
[time=846] what would he have to do what would he have to say who would he have to be revealed to be for within
[time=854] one week of time a country that basically gives him relatively high job approval ratings to turn
[time=861] about face and ask not just for his resignation not just for his impeachment but cry out that he
[time=869] should be executed it's kind of a stretch isn't it you know it's your hard pressed I mean maybe
[time=875] murder maybe rape maybe treason maybe some great atrocity might bring about such an absolute
[time=881] reversal of opinion to go from accolades to crying out for the death I asked you to kind of think
[time=888] about that a little bit this morning because that is exactly what happens in the last week of the life of christ within a week's time he goes from being hailed as the king of israel
[time=900] to those same group of people crying out with angry hearts crucify him which would have been
[time=907] that form of execution in that day and you ask yourself what did he do in this last week of his
[time=914] life did he murder somebody did he rape somebody did he commit treason the answer is this
[time=921] when it becomes clear to the people that christ was not going to give them what they wanted
[time=928] and what they wanted as you'll see in a minute was a political revolution when it became clear
[time=934] then that christ was not going to give them that political revolution but insisted on giving them instead what they really needed which was a spiritual revolution they hated him for it and
[time=944] eventually cried out for his crucifixion all within a period of seven days if you want to see what they wanted from him look at john chapter 12 verses 12 and 13 on the
[time=956] next day the great multitude who had come to the feast when they heard heard that jesus was coming to Jerusalem took the branches of the palm trees and went out to meet him and began to cry out
[time=968] hosanna bless it is he who comes in the name of the lord here it is even the king of israel
[time=976] here he is at the peak the zenith of his national popularity for three years christ has been moving
[time=984] in and amongst the land of palestine and he has been preaching and he has been performing miracles
[time=990] and his miracles have been astounding the people he has been giving sight to the blind
[time=996] he has been healing the withered hand he has been saying to the lifelong paralytic take up your pallet and walk and the paralytic instantly is completely and totally healed and not only walks but skips and runs and jumps from the place to which he had previously been bound he comes to
[time=1012] people whose limbs are falling off and emaciated due to leprosy and without even touching them
[time=1018] he heals them and they are utterly and totally and completely restored the death people can hear
[time=1024] the moot people can speak for three years it has been an avalanche of miraculous power
[time=1030] healing everyone and anyone who came within his immediate proximity and those who even
[time=1036] brought their request via another to his immediate proximity it's been a miraculous
[time=1042] amazing three years and the last public miracle that we know he recently has done the culminating one
[time=1048] that was semi-private and semi-public was the raising of his dearly beloved Lazarus from the dead
[time=1054] and that kind of just took everybody over the edge and the time is right the great Passover feast
[time=1063] is in Jerusalem and literally millions of Jews have traveled from the outskirts of Palestine to
[time=1069] come to the holy of holies the city of Jerusalem to observe this national holiday of the Passover
[time=1075] and Jesus has just days prior to it raised Lazarus from the dead and they are saying to themselves
[time=1082] this Jesus may not look like a general he may not be strong and big and burly he may not look
[time=1088] like a conquering king he's rather meek he's rather mild but we've been watching him now for these three years we know he can feed us miraculously we know he can heal us miraculously and we know
[time=1100] now he can even bring us back from the dead we will make him our king and so they hail him as he comes
[time=1109] into the city of Jerusalem as the king of Israel they along with this astounding evidence of Jesus
[time=1115] and his miraculous power have a felt need that is running to a fever pitch and that is this they
[time=1121] are sick of Rome they are sick of being an inhabited conquered people they are sick of Rome's laws
[time=1128] they are sick of Rome's taxes they are sick of Rome's military being based in their home
[time=1134] and living in their homes and requiring them to serve them they want to be rid of this Roman yoke
[time=1140] and so as Jesus comes in what we are familiar with the triumphal entry that we've read here in
[time=1146] verses 12 and 13 you need to picture the scene Jesus has been staying in Bethany the
[time=1152] evening before was when Mary and Martha had the dinner for him and the perfume bottle was broken and this extravagant expression of love was bestowed upon him and Lazarus the one he had raised from the dead was reclining at the table with him and now Bethany is going to move this entire city is now going to move into Jerusalem and all those who have been traveling from the north down to Jerusalem have stopped at Bethany because that's where who is that's where Jesus is and the rumor of this miracle is running hot the raising of Lazarus from the dead and so there are likely several hundred thousand people in Bethany with Christ when he begins to make his move for Jerusalem
[time=1185] Jerusalem itself has swollen his population by people who didn't come by way of Bethany
[time=1191] and so they are they are they are jam-packed in the city of Jerusalem and when word comes that Jesus is going to make his move to come to Jerusalem somehow they hear about it first and another
[time=1202] several hundred thousand people except the city and these two masses collide somewhere outside
[time=1208] of Jerusalem and Jesus is in the middle and Lazarus is there and everybody's pointing at Lazarus everybody's pointing at Jesus and then they do what was prophesied in the Old Testament they cry out
[time=1219] Hosanna blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord even the king of Israel and they have
[time=1225] there their palm branches symbolically hailing him as the great and mighty king he is our conquering hero he is our political revolutionary he is the one who will throw off this
[time=1238] oppressive yoke of Rome David's heir remember David David is the one who re-fought and recaptured
[time=1244] and restructured the land of Israel and pushed its borders out to its proper and necessary places
[time=1250] the great military commander David finally his heir has come and we will like in the days of old
[time=1257] throw off our oppressors and those who now live in our lands and we will be once again sovereign
[time=1263] over ourselves and of course their hope sovereign overall who live that's the beginning of the week
[time=1271] they were ready to crown him as king now after this great entry look at verse 20 interesting little caveat
[time=1282] now there was a there were certain Greeks non-Jews now there were certain Greeks among those who were
[time=1292] going up to worship at the feast these therefore came to Philip who was from Bethsadia and of Galilean
[time=1299] began to ask him sir we wish to see Jesus how can we get to see Jesus verse 22 Philip came and told
[time=1307] Andrew and Andrew and Philip came and they told Jesus now as you know we're studying the book of
[time=1313] John John's whole goal is to present Jesus Christ as God because Jesus is God and all the stuff and all the information all the dialogues and all the stuff that comes the material that comes in the book of John is to say this that Jesus Christ is the true and living God who took the form of human flesh and so there is this marshaling of all this evidence both his miracles and his preaching
[time=1333] that declare him to be God that's the major theme there is a sub theme that we've been noticing in John and that is people's reactions to this evidence and we have found there are three kinds of people
[time=1344] and it was true then and that is true today there are those who categorically reject Jesus Christ they want nothing to do with him then there is the second category and they are called the seekers
[time=1354] they are the ones who have not made up their minds they are the ones who are aware that something is missing in their life they they they have an ever awareness that there may in fact be a God that that God may have entered our world through the person of Jesus Christ and they are interested they are seeking they are asking genuine honest heartfelt questions trying to resolve their
[time=1374] genuine heartfelt confusion about who Jesus is who God is and how they might have eternal life
[time=1380] these are called seekers and then the third category of course are people who just believe him now what you have in verse 20 are Greeks these are seekers these are people who are coming to a feast
[time=1392] that is utterly foreign to their own background they don't belong here other than that they are proselytes they are trying to get converted they they sense that the true God and of course the world at this time is filled with various nations and each nation has its own God and its own false religious system and it doesn't say which false religious system these folks are forsaking but they are doubtlessly forsaking one of them and they are instead looking to the God of Israel and they know that this God of Israel is celebrated and worshiped in Jerusalem at the Passover and so they come and they too have heard about Christ and they too possibly have seen some of his miracles
[time=1428] they may have heard some of his preaching and what they are doing is they are now approaching one of the initiates of Christ one of the close of the twelve of Christ and they are saying is there any way you can get us in immediate proximity to Christ we want to meet him we want to further
[time=1444] our spiritual pilgrimage by getting in the presence of this the one they call Messiah
[time=1450] for we have questions we have hopes we have aspirations our soul is longing for some spiritual answers and so against the backdrop of this throng of people
[time=1461] who want nothing of a spiritual issue with Christ they only want political revolution
[time=1467] they want Rome thrown off they want prosperity they want circumstantial happiness they want power they want peace in a material physical way against this great thronging crowd come just a few
[time=1478] just a few seekers and they only want to get into the presence of Christ and so this message is relayed to Christ
[time=1487] and Christ amazingly and I think if you've studied with us you'll notice that Christ tends to answer
[time=1493] the seekers with with an amazing amount of clarity and compassion and where others who are rejecting
[time=1503] him may ask him questions he deflects he confuses he confounds he confronts in his responses when he
[time=1510] comes to answering questions and he comes to encounters with seekers you'll find he is remarkably soft he is remarkably clear and so without the text doesn't tell us whether the seekers
[time=1522] got to come and hear him say this but here is the answer that he gives to this request can we see Jesus look at verses 23 and 24 he says this and Jesus answered them saying
[time=1534] the hour has come for the son of man to be glorified truly truly I say to you unless a
[time=1542] grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies it remains by itself alone but if it dies
[time=1549] it bears much fruit stop right there Jesus is talking about the cross
[time=1556] these guys have come to find out about spiritual life these guys have come to find the answer to
[time=1564] their aching soul these guys have no doubt come to find out how to resolve the the sense of guilt
[time=1570] that fills their hearts over their misdeeds and Jesus very directly and in concert with the whole
[time=1576] flow the book brings this thing together and says let me tell you something guys it's time for the son of man to be glorified well what does that mean the Jews who would
[time=1585] have heard him say that son of man that's a Old Testament messianic conquering phrase and when
[time=1591] he's when they heard that the son of man to be glorified they would have gone again to this thing that Jesus is going to be our physical political literal king and so he gives definition to this he's he's saying my glorification in my first coming is not about conquering kingdoms
[time=1606] it is about dying verse 24 he says truly truly I say to you unless a grain of wheat falls into
[time=1612] the earth and dies it remains by itself alone but if it dies it bears much fruit he is saying that he has not come to kill people in a political revolt
[time=1626] to overthrow human earthly kingdoms he is saying that he has come to kill not not to kill other
[time=1632] people but to die himself to affect a spiritual revolution in people's hearts that will last for
[time=1639] eternity when he uses this incredible illustration of a seed and the master teacher that he is he
[time=1646] was always trying to help people move from the known to the unknown he would always teach them and remind them and get them thinking about stuff they already understand so that he could tell them
[time=1656] and help them transition in their thinking about things that they did not yet understand and so and agrarian community everybody was a farmer everybody lived with seeds everybody was harvesting I mean that's all they did that's how they lived and so this illustration came to life and their minds and the point is this you take a seed and the seed has a hard outer covering that that is
[time=1678] it's it's flash if you will it is it's it's it's protection and you take it and you put it in the
[time=1684] ground and you you bury it and when it is in the ground it dies the seed dies in other words there
[time=1690] is an erosion process that destroys the outer casing of that seed and that falls away and that
[time=1698] represents its death and then of course as you know what happens is life comes out of that death
[time=1706] and it's a huge life depending upon what kind of a seed it is
[time=1712] so look again verse 24 truly truly I say to you unless the grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies it remains by itself alone but if it dies it bears much fruit and you know the ratio one seed
[time=1723] of wheat one seed of wheat that's gone and is dead and then gives birth to a harvest of wheat and
[time=1730] any given stock there are 30 40 50 100 sometimes a thousand times as many seeds born by the one seed
[time=1738] that died through that stock of wheat it is a great harvest it bears much fruit
[time=1744] see Jesus sees their real need he is confronted with these spiritual laws that cannot be broken and
[time=1755] while the people of Israel are crying out for a king to liberate them from political oppression Jesus sees the spiritual oppression of life and the spiritual oppression that results from sin
[time=1766] now he knows the wages of sin is death he knows that people will never truly be free until they are free from the consequences of their sin which is death for eternity and which is imprisonment or
[time=1778] bondage to the power of that sin even while they live he knows that people are eternally lost
[time=1784] and were he not to die they could never live the fruit that would come from his death would
[time=1791] never be born if he didn't die he's got to go into the earth he's got to die so that the fruit of
[time=1797] their spiritual revolution and revival can be affected with the power of sin that is daily
[time=1805] encompassing these people's lives their selfishness their lust their pride their their divisive relationships their anger their unloving attitudes all that can never be dealt with through a political revolution all that can only be dealt with through a spiritual revolution and that can only be affected as he dies so Jesus is saying as long as i'm alive the life that is in me cannot
[time=1825] escape it is when i go into the grave that the death of my body releases the power of the life
[time=1833] that is within me i have to die to give people a chance to live in effect you want me to be your conquering king riding on a white stallion and brandishing a sword
[time=1844] and liberating you from Rome i am instead the suffering lamb of god who has come not to kill but
[time=1851] to be killed you want me to give you political freedom you want me to give you material prosperity
[time=1858] you want me to give you circumstantial peace i am offering spiritual freedom i am offering forgiveness of sins i'm offering you a love-driven life i am offering you eternity with god forever
[time=1870] in heaven and so in response to these seekers he says now listen you guys you've come you're here
[time=1877] in Jerusalem it's a great feast everybody's out there hailing me as the king everybody's doing the
[time=1883] poem branches everybody's waving the stuff crying hosanna don't don't let them don't let them deter you
[time=1890] or or persuade you to think about me other than what i am i am the son of man it's time for me to
[time=1897] be glorified and i will be killed i will die on your behalf don't miss the point don't let the
[time=1905] triumphal entry mislead you understand clearly who i am now by the way christ has always said this
[time=1913] about himself christ christ this isn't a switch you know a bait and switch deal this isn't jesus
[time=1919] saying i'll be your political leader all of his three years of ministry through his miracles and then suddenly at the end saying not whoops fullja not going to do that i'm going to offer you a spiritual revolution he had always been offering the spiritual um he had always been preaching repentance he had
[time=1933] always been saying that the way you inherit the kingdom of god is um through being poor in spirit
[time=1939] and broken of heart and contrite over your sins his agenda had always been people's hearts that's
[time=1945] why the whole sermon on the mount which talked nothing about externals and political things it was a whole treatise on the condition of true righteousness then what it takes to enter the kingdom of god to be broken over your sin and to mourn your sin and to grieve your sin so this isn't a bait and switch on his part it's just that the people didn't want to deal with their
[time=1964] sin the people did not want to admit that they needed to be saved from their sin they were self
[time=1970] righteous they thought that as long as they lived according to the code of their religious leaders
[time=1976] they were the seed of abraham the children of abraham they were the ones of all the people in the world who had the old testament law they had circumcision they were proud arrogant religious
[time=1986] people who did not hear the message of spiritual repentance because they didn't think they needed it and so even to the last of the days of christ even in this triumphal entry they still because of the
[time=1998] hardness of their heart and their self-righteousness and their lack of sensing their own need to be
[time=2004] saved from their own sins continue to hail him as a political conqueror and i just bring all that up just to help you understand that jesus wasn't deceptive jesus
[time=2014] wasn't at the end trying to to change his story that had always been his story that's why even his forerunner john the baptist had come and said you know behold the lamb of god repent of your sins and it had always been repent of your sins here's jesus he can save you from your sins but because of the power of christ because of the miracles of christ and because of the people's hard-heartedness toward their own sin and they're lusting after political freedom and political prosperity and materialism and all the stuff that a miracle worker like jesus could give they utterly completely missed the point again and again and again so he says let me clarify i am not a conquering earthly king i am the lamb of god
[time=2055] secondly he says let me clarify for you i did not come to kill people i came to die for people
[time=2062] i came to give my life a ransom for their sins so that they might live eternally with god to pay the the penalty for their sins now having said that in the remaining couple of verses here verses 25 and 26 he says that that has some implications to why you would want to follow me
[time=2079] having re clarified for you who i am and what i'm about and what my agenda is let me remind you
[time=2086] of what what should you aspire for in me what should cause you to aspire to love me what should
[time=2093] cause you to aspire to a follow and and and pursue me and he gives three things three things that ought
[time=2099] to be bound up in the heart of a person who would choose christ and they're found in verses 25 and 26 let's read him he says there he who loves his life loses it and he who hates his life in this
[time=2111] world shall keep it too life eternal if anyone serves me let him follow me and where i am
[time=2118] there shall my servant also be if anyone serves me the father will honor him let me give you three
[time=2126] things from these two verses that define what ought to cause you to want christ and if you want christ
[time=2132] for anything other than this you want him for the wrong reasons and you will never have him
[time=2138] if you want christ for anything other than these three reasons you want him for the wrong reasons and you will never have him you may think you have him but you will not have him number one
[time=2149] the first thing he clarifies here is the loss of self or self-denial
[time=2155] look at verse 25 again he says this he who loves his life loses it and he who hates his life in
[time=2164] this world shall keep it too life eternal guess what you've got to want in christ the end of yourself you must in christ want to disown yourself you pursue christ
[time=2178] because you are refusing any association with yourself you say that sounds hard to do it because i am me and i'll always be me that's true there's part of that that that is true this doesn't mean that you change your hair color this doesn't mean that you change try to change your size or your shape or your passions or your interests those that are legitimate this doesn't mean you go through a personality change what he's saying this is this that you deny that you have the capacity to save yourself you deny that you have the capacity to be in and
[time=2207] of yourself what god requires you look at your life you look at yourself and you lose it you reject
[time=2214] it you deny it you walk away from it you lose and you in fact it says you hate your life
[time=2222] see it there in verse 25 he who hates his life in this world shall keep it too life eternal
[time=2229] it's an interesting perspective in it this strikes at the core of all of man-made righteousness and the clearest passage of it
[time=2240] of all is over in Philippians chapter three let me just read it to you remember paul was all wrapped up in this system he would have been those that were self-righteous and feeling they had no need for salvation until he he finally hated himself he finally denied himself he hated his own life
[time=2256] and chose instead to live for Christ he said this he says although I might have confidence in the flesh meaning to save myself listen to this now if anyone else had a mind but confidence in the
[time=2267] flesh I did far more then he lists off all of his religious accomplishments I was circumcised the
[time=2273] eighth day I was of the nation of Israel I was of the tribe of Benjamin I was a Hebrew of Hebrews as to the law I was a Pharisee as to zeal I was a persecutor of the church as to the righteousness
[time=2284] which is in the law I was found blameless he gives you there a litany of religious accomplishments
[time=2291] that was unparalleled in his day and if there was ever anyone who felt in his heart he could have
[time=2297] stood before God and said God I love my life I love my accomplishments I love who I have become
[time=2304] in my achieving to say to you at the end of the age I deserve to come to heaven there would have been
[time=2310] the list he would have given God and it would have danned him to hell forever that's what Jesus is
[time=2317] saying until you understand that no matter who you are no matter how hard you've worked no matter how
[time=2323] long your list of accomplishments are that you are a sinner and that you are unworthy of heaven and
[time=2329] that nothing you can ever do will ever live up to the perfect standard required you will go to hell you have got to learn to hate your life that's what he says then paul contingencies but whatever
[time=2340] things were gained to me those things I have counted as loss for the sake of Christ paul says
[time=2346] all my religious accomplishments all my self-righteousness all my good deeds all my kind thoughts all the things I ever did that were nice and good and right I count them but loss I throw
[time=2356] them away for the sake of Christ he says more than that I count all things to be lost in view of the
[time=2362] surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things I
[time=2368] count them but rubbish in order that I may gain Christ do you understand there's a total exchange
[time=2374] of everything he was and everything he thought he did and all of his sense of being worthy of
[time=2380] approval by God a total exchange of that counting it as rubbish as nothing to gain one thing in
[time=2387] its place the person of Christ he goes on he says that I may be found in Christ now watch this listen
[time=2398] not having a righteousness of my own derived from the law in other words not by how I might do good
[time=2405] things but that which is through faith in Christ the righteousness which comes from God on the
[time=2412] basis of faith wow there it is you want to know what must be driving your heart towards Christ in
[time=2421] order for your salvation to be true you want to know what must fill your heart in terms of an aspiration from Christ in order to be sure that your faith is genuine and real and acceptable in
[time=2432] the sight of God it is first and foremost this a denial of yourself of all your self-worth your
[time=2438] self-righteousness your accomplishments your efforts your relative goodness over somebody else it must do you become rubbish and you must take instead one and one alone the person of Jesus Christ be
[time=2450] found in him having a righteousness not that you produce but the righteousness which comes through
[time=2456] faith in Christ that comes from God on the basis of faith Jesus looks at these seekers maybe they
[time=2462] were there maybe he just relayed the message back through Philip and Andrew and he says listen don't misunderstand me I am not a political conqueror I am not about political kingdoms I am about spiritual
[time=2473] revival and revolution new hearts changed for all of eternity that's who I am which means for you
[time=2480] and me to be together you must want that and that alone from me you must want that and that alone from
[time=2487] me you too must be willing to die die not necessarily on a cross die not necessarily the death of a
[time=2496] martyr though that may come in the cause of Christ but die first and foremost and most importantly to yourself to your self-righteousness and if you do and you take Christ instead then what does it say
[time=2511] verse 25 again of John 12 he who loves his life loses it in other words he who says I am okay on
[time=2519] my own I have my own righteousness I'm not all that bad God will understand God will accept me
[time=2525] I'm not as bad as so-and-so he who loves his life loses it and we reflect back on the passage
[time=2533] last week where Jesus led his own good friend Lazarus die Jesus is capable of letting spiritual
[time=2539] laws have effect on even those he loves and that includes you he who loves his life loses it then he says this but if you hate your life you will keep it to life eternal that's why in Philippians three it says this we worship in the spirit of God and we glory in
[time=2560] Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the flesh that's why Jesus said that blessed are they
[time=2568] who are poor in spirit and the word poor there means a beggar an absolute destitute beggar who has absolutely no resources to feed himself to fend for himself to care for his own needs and the analogy Christ was making is that when you recognize that spiritually you are a spiritual beggar you have no resources you cannot provide the spiritual resources for your own salvation and you cry out for God to save you as a beggar cries out for his next loaf of bread
[time=2594] there there is the heart of salvation there is the heart of faith Psalm 51 17 says that the sacrifices of God are a broken spirit a broken and a contrite heart oh
[time=2605] God thou wilt not despise the aspiration of salvation is first and foremost and utter
[time=2612] total complete brokenness of spirit over personal sin it is a contrite heart over the ways many
[time=2618] and sundry that that heart has violated the true and living God and those that God has put in their lives there is a losing of self in fact there is a hating of self
[time=2629] I hate myself I hate my sin I hate what I do to the people around me I want to lose this life
[time=2637] I want to gain another the one that I can gain only in Christ you know that's the way in to salvation and that's the way it stays isn't it
[time=2649] you and I who are not in the secret group you and I who are already born again you and I know that you and I know that even though we have repudiated self-righteousness and we have
[time=2660] confessed to God that we are sinners and saved by His grace and His grace only we still go on hating our lives don't we I mean that part of us that remains then singing that song that we sang this morning again you know the one I love your grace I love your however goes your truth and it says but what I love most of all I love your presence most of
[time=2680] all I've been singing that song during the week and and the services and I said to myself a couple of weeks ago you know if that's true if the thing I love the most is not God's grace and not his power and not his strength and not his truth if what I love most about God is walking with him being in fellowship with his presence why don't I live like it why do I continue to sin why do I continue to
[time=2702] make choices small sometimes large that violate my relationship with God and put that sense of
[time=2709] distance between me and Christ I mean if I really love his presence and it's true I do I think you
[time=2715] do too there's nothing more exhilarating than walking with God knowing the slate is clean the heart is broken the heart is contrite the life is submitted to God and as you encountered various
[time=2726] temptations to sin you just say no I choose the presence of Christ instead of this expression or
[time=2732] this angry thought or this lustful attitude or whatever it is that is being offered by the things
[time=2738] of this world you know and I remember just saying to myself on a Sunday morning here a couple weeks
[time=2744] ago or last week whenever was I said I'm gonna go for it like I've never gone for it before I'm going I'm gonna go for it I'm just gonna I don't want to over commit for the next month I am going to do the presence of Jesus thing like I've never done it before I'm just gonna say no to anything and everything external and internal that lets me continue to walk in the presence of Christ
[time=2764] you know you can hardly get home before you violated it you can hardly go to the store and be
[time=2775] confronted with the stuff that's at the store before you violate it you can hardly get into a conversation with your wife or your kids before you once again choose self choose selfishness choose the lower road this total surrender thing this never stops in the life of a true believer
[time=2790] he who loves his life loses it in other words what I'm saying to you is that that if if this is not
[time=2796] the constant state of your heart where you are continually hating your life the part of your life
[time=2803] that is selfish and arrogant and proud and submissive and sinful if that does not stay the continual
[time=2809] hating of your life my friend do you have great reason to question whether or not you are truly
[time=2815] born again whether or not your faith is true and genuine there's the one who hates his life
[time=2825] who loses his life who longs to lose his life to be bound up and found only in Christ
[time=2831] Jesus says this is the this is the stuff of saving faith this is what you believe me for
[time=2839] secondly secondly is found there in verse 26 it says if anyone serves me let him follow me
[time=2849] and where I am there shall my servant also be the second aspiration the reason you should come to
[time=2856] Christ is not for political revolution whether it be national or just the little one you want to have in your own life so your life works better it is this I want to give loyal obedience to Christ
[time=2866] I want to be his servant I want to submit my life agenda to his agenda not only do I want to forsake
[time=2874] myself righteousness but I want to forsake my plans and my agenda and my aspirations and submit them
[time=2881] totally and completely to where I am the servant of Christ it is what he wants for my life that I
[time=2887] want I want to love my wife the way that he wants me I want to serve Christ in loving my wife I want
[time=2893] to serve Christ in treating my kids according to the scriptures I want to serve Christ in handling my money according to the scriptures I want to serve Christ in every single area of my life by conforming it to whatever the the word of God says it ought to be you see there is with this denial
[time=2909] of yourself there is with this hating of your life the need then for a new way to live a new
[time=2915] agenda and not just for righteousness it is for the daily practice of life and Christ says to
[time=2921] these seekers let me tell you something guys it begins with a hatred and a rejection of self righteousness and a grasping to me for eternal life and it continues after that with an absolute submission of your will in every category of your life to be my servant day in and day out
[time=2936] to go where I would have you go to do what I would have you do to say what I would have you say to be what I would have you be it's an amazing thing Paul says it unbelievably well he says this and I will do all things for the sake of the gospel
[time=2956] do you hear that he says I will do anything now that I have come to Christ I will do anything
[time=2963] for the sake of the gospel then he gives us some illustrations he says do you not know that those who run in a race all run but only one receives the prize run in such a way that you
[time=2974] may win you see that's total abandonment to Christ isn't it that's becoming a full-fledged bonafide servant of the king that is saying not only do I count on you to save me from my sin but now that you have I will live as your servant and I will live with an attitude of zeal and whole
[time=2990] hearted commitment to you to give you glory to give you honor I will run in such a way that I might
[time=2996] win Paul goes on to verse 25 of 1 Corinthians 9 by saying this everybody who competes in the game
[time=3002] exercises self-control and everything they then do it to receive a perishable wreath but we an
[time=3008] imperishable he says this therefore I'd run in such a way as not without aim I box in such a way as not just beating the air he says I beat my body and I make it my slave less possibly after I
[time=3020] have preached to others I myself should be disqualified. Loyal obedience in every single area of our
[time=3030] lives he says you don't go out to compete in an Olympic game and only bring three or four categories
[time=3036] of your life under control but let a couple of them like maybe you're eating or you're sleeping or your workouts you know to win this thing you got to submit every category of your life to train for that particular event that's how it is in Christianity you submit every single category of your life
[time=3053] to complete loyal servanthood to Christ when you're so sick of your own life and you're so sick of
[time=3061] your own sin and you're so sick of the pointless monotony of life that you want to reject yourself
[time=3068] and take Christ and then with that say you are my master I am your slave and let that slavery be
[time=3076] defined as a 100 percent all encompassing commitment to do whatever whenever he says Christ says now you're starting to understand what ought to fill your heart when you come to me for salvation it's an amazing thing in it and thirdly this is interesting look at number three
[time=3096] look at the end of verse 26 then he says this let's start at the beginning of the verse if
[time=3102] anyone serves me let him follow me and where I am there shall my servant also be then he says this if anybody serves me the father will honor him make no mistake about it friends there is a reward
[time=3114] there is a time of glory there is a time of where we get everything we ever thought we wanted and
[time=3121] more excuse me and that is when the father will honor us do you see that you see that if you will
[time=3130] hate your life and choose Christ instead if you will serve him from your heart the day will come
[time=3136] when God will honor you for that that's called delayed gratification one of the great themes
[time=3145] that Christ preached all of his ministry and one of the themes that is picked up and followed throughout all the New Testament is this Christianity is you you you suffer now you serve now you you
[time=3156] do whatever Christ needs you to do now and and for those of us who are doing that particularly in this culture that doesn't seem all that bad but it is a denial of self it is a submissiveness
[time=3166] in your heart but we find the more we do that somehow the happier we get but that constitutes our suffering that constitutes our hardship and many believers do give up their lives physically in persecution you give that up now just like Christ did and yet there is later coming delayed
[time=3181] gratification the honor that God will bestow on people who do that and that's an amazing thing
[time=3188] you know I don't win a lot of awards and that's fine with me I did win one last year I played in
[time=3196] this little itty bitty golf tournament over there at mommy valley and about six guys you know you're competing against not a big thing and the guys that probably could have beat me were in a slump that year and so I actually snuck through and I won the tournament there's a big day in my life
[time=3211] you know I love golf first golf tournament I ever entered first golf tournament I ever won and they gave me an honor they gave me a cheap trophy about that tall
[time=3221] and I took it and I remember receiving it and I looked at the little inscription that did say first place of the open flight and that meant a little something and I thought wow and I kind of lost track of that trophy until Thursday when Bobby showed up with it and it's a little trophy you
[time=3238] know with a little wooden stand it says this thing and it has a little golf front and the golf club is up there and he shows he says hey dad look here and the whole golf club thing is gone it's busted
[time=3247] it shattered he says is this yours and I said yeah and he says do you mind if I cut the wood off the bottom of this thing and I'm like pop that they honored me I mean that's that's as much as it gets
[time=3260] that's as good as it gets that's this that's my highest achievement so far and you want to cut it off after you've already broken the golf club off you know you come into this text and you say
[time=3272] hey let me tell you something give your life away choose the life of Christ instead of your own
[time=3279] become the absolute servant of Christ and in the end the Father will honor you and it will not be
[time=3287] some little trinket for some little earthly passing insignificant accomplishment
[time=3293] listen to it listen to the description of what God will do he says I saw a new heaven and a new earth
[time=3301] why a new heaven or new earth well the first one passed away I saw the whole holy city the new
[time=3307] Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God made ready as a bride adorned for her husband
[time=3313] that's us and I heard a loud voice from the throne saying behold the tabernacle of God is among men and he shall dwell among them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be among
[time=3323] them and he shall wipe away every tear from their eyes and there shall no longer be any death
[time=3329] there shall no longer be any mourning or crying or pain the first things have passed away it's an
[time=3336] amazing thing do you realize that you and I give up what we hate our sin our self our pride our
[time=3345] arrogance we get in return the forgiveness of God the righteousness of God through faith in Christ we take and serve him the rest of our life which means we have purpose and meaning and we stand for things that are worthwhile and in the end God gives us honor and it is an honor that gives us
[time=3363] place in the new heaven and the new earth and the new Jerusalem which is marked by the very presence of God where he will dwell among us and he will light us up his shekinah glory will fill our hearts
[time=3374] with total satisfaction every minute of every day and there it is he who will wipe away every tear from our eye which means there'll be no more sorrow no more death no more mourning no more crying
[time=3385] no more pain it will be an eternity of everything that those Jews kind of thought he might be able
[time=3392] to give them there on earth it's called delayed gratification you want to come to Christ
[time=3398] you want to come to Christ you deny yourself and you know in that denial of self it leads you to
[time=3406] then be his servant the rest of your life but with that comes the anticipation and the thing the
[time=3412] Bible calls hope that when this age is over you will have a place of honor for all of eternity
[time=3418] to the glory of God well it's the same thing in it what would cause a American populace to reject
[time=3429] Mark Maguire and cry for his crucifixion within seven days I don't know I'll tell you what caused a group of people to reject Christ to take a look at the astounding
[time=3442] wonderful miraculous marvelous God incarnate living Jesus Christ I can tell you what took them from absolute accolades to total rejection the span of seven days and it was this they found out that he was not going to give them what they wanted and what they wanted was kingdom now happiness now peace now circumstantial blessing now and when they found out they could not turn
[time=3464] him into some kind of little genie that would it would jump to every whim and request they said forget it we weren't interested in you then in the first place let's just crucify him
[time=3475] let's throw him out of our lives you know that's what people do today when people find out and you
[time=3482] may be among the seekers today guard your heart against that when you find out that what Christ really wants to give you is spiritual freedom from your sin and a life of purpose and meaning in his servants and eternity forever with the glory of the Father recognize that think about that
[time=3497] and and understand what it's all about let me close with the words of Jesus he said this
[time=3504] if anyone wishes to come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whoever wishes to save his life shall lose it but whoever loses his life for my sake shall
[time=3517] find it for what will a man be profited if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul
[time=3526] or what will a man give in exchange for his soul let me invite you to stand for a closing word of
[time=3533] prayer if you'd like a cassette copy of today's message just ask for the tape number on your screen
