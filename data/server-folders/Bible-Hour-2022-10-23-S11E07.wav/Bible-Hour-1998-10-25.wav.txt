[time=302] We rejoice, you set us free, Jesus.
[time=426] We celebrate with a song like that that's joyful.
[time=433] But what does that really mean?
[time=436] He is holy.
[time=437] How does that apply to our lives, to our time together here of worship?
[time=441] Holy, that word means set apart.
[time=446] Our world doesn't know much about holiness, except for what they see in us.
[time=453] They understand what set apart means, and they set people apart for a variety of reasons.
[time=459] They set them apart for athletic success, because they're wealthy, or even for notoriety.
[time=468] And if somebody who our world set apart was here with us this morning, we'd all be scoping them out, seeing where they were.
[time=474] Michael Jordan were here.
[time=476] You'd be looking for Michael Jordan, Oprah Winfrey, whomever.
[time=480] You might even have your binoculars, and looking for them.
[time=487] Well, God is here.
[time=488] He says, "We're two or three are gathered.
[time=489] I am in the midst of you." And I would hope we would look for our number one celebrity, God, when we come together in this place, that we would seek Him out, just as we would someone else that our world has set aside.
[time=506] So as we continue to worship Him, seek Him out.
[time=511] Not necessarily with your eyes, although God, if He chose to, could be here in a physical presence, but more with your heart, a seek Him out, because He is here.
[time=536] Your holyness, when I gaze into your eyes, when the things of this world will strangely dim, like God, your awesome God.
[time=560] Oh, my God, your awesome God.
[time=568] Praise thy gratefulness, and mighty are your ways.
[time=574] Oh, my God, your awesome God.
[time=582] You will reign forever in my life, your awesome God.
[time=596] When I think about all you've done for me, when I see your wondrous place, I can never see your highest praise, my God, your awesome God.
[time=624] Oh, my God, your awesome God.
[time=632] Praise thy gratefulness, and mighty are your ways.
[time=638] Oh, my God, your awesome God.
[time=646] You will reign forever in my life, your awesome God.
[time=656] Oh, my God, your awesome God.
[time=663] Praise thy gratefulness, and mighty are your ways.
[time=669] Oh, my God, your awesome God.
[time=677] You will reign forever in my life, your awesome God.
[time=691] There is a reader, Jesus got no sound.
[time=705] Precious men of God, Messiah.
[time=712] Oh, holy God.
[time=719] Thank you, oh, my God.
[time=725] For giving us your sound, and leaving your spirit till the world of Earth is done.
[time=746] Jesus, my Redeemer, name of all names.
[time=759] Precious men of God, Messiah.
[time=766] Thank you, oh, my God.
[time=779] For giving us your sound, and leaving your spirit till the world of Earth is done.
[time=795] Let's share together.
[time=797] See you back in the morning.
[time=801] When I stand in glory, I will see His name.
[time=814] There I'll serve my King forever in that holy place.
[time=826] Thank you, oh, my Father.
[time=832] For giving us your sound, and leaving your spirit till the world of Earth.
[time=843] Thank you, the world of Earth is done.
[time=851] Oh, my God, your awesome God.
[time=859] Great is my faithfulness, and mighty are your ways.
[time=865] Oh, my God, your awesome God.
[time=872] You reign forever in my life, your awesome God.
[time=881] Oh, my God, your awesome God.
[time=889] Great is my faithfulness, and mighty are your ways.
[time=895] Oh, my God, your awesome God.
[time=903] You reign forever in my life, your awesome God.
[time=915] Your awesome God.
[time=935] Well, good morning, and we're glad you're here.
[time=937] Let me invite you to open your Bible to the book of 1 Thessalonians.
[time=942] And we started a study in the book of 1 Thessalonians last week.
[time=946] And we want to continue it this week, and this time we actually get to look at the text from this first chapter.
[time=954] I want to begin by asking you a question.
[time=957] Have you ever wondered about your salvation?
[time=961] Have you ever wondered if maybe, though you may have prayed to receive Christ as your personal Lord and Savior,
[time=969] that you might not really be saved?
[time=973] A question akin to that one is, have you ever looked at a friend or a relative or a family member
[time=980] and asked that same question, "Gee, you know, I wonder if that person is really born again?"
[time=988] Well, Paul, as you may remember from last week, was in Thessalonica for only a brief period of time.
[time=995] His faithfulness to the calling of God and his life to enter first the synagogue led to what seemed to be the inevitable result of the Jews there in the synagogue, many of them, feeling jealous of his ministry.
[time=1008] They began a persecution of him.
[time=1010] They got a riot going, and he was having to leave very prematurely.
[time=1015] And so having preached the gospel there, though the text tells us in Acts, that there were some conversions.
[time=1021] There were some conversions among those Jews in the synagogue.
[time=1025] There were some conversions among the God-fearing Greeks and even some of the leading women in the city of Thessalonica.
[time=1033] But because Paul had to go on so fast, he was in his own mind wondering what was the fruit of my ministry?
[time=1039] What really happened as a result of my dialoguing, if you remember, in the synagogue?
[time=1045] Well, about a year later, he sent Timothy back to get a report on the progress of the church at Thessalonica.
[time=1054] And finally, he hears back from Timothy, and Paul is ecstatic.
[time=1060] Because if you look in chapter 1, verse 4, he says, "This knowing brethren be loved by God, his choice of you."
[time=1068] And that's Paul's way of saying that you are obviously truly born again.
[time=1073] And God has in fact chosen you. You are among those people who not only hear the gospel
[time=1079] and give profession of faith in the gospel, but are actually truly born again.
[time=1085] It's an exciting thing that he experiences, and that's why I'm in verse 2.
[time=1089] He says, "You know, I give thanks to God always for all of you, making mention of you in my prayers.
[time=1095] And the reason for that thankful heart, the reason he's so excited, the reason that Thessalonians is remembered
[time=1102] as one of the most positive books in all the New Testament is because these people are truly saved.
[time=1110] Now in this first chapter, he is going to tell them why he thinks they're born again.
[time=1116] He's going to give a list of about eight marks that give evidence to the fact that these people in the city of Thessalonica
[time=1124] not only heard the gospel, but really had saving faith and are this day born again.
[time=1131] And so this morning it gives us a chance to list off these eight marks of true salvation.
[time=1138] And you can ask these questions of yourself.
[time=1142] You know, are these marks true of my life?
[time=1145] Is there real evidence that I not only know about the gospel, but that I am truly saved?
[time=1151] It may give you some help as you evaluate, not judge.
[time=1155] You're not a judge, I'm not a judge, only God can judge, but give you points of evaluation to think through
[time=1162] a friend or a loved one that you're not sure about.
[time=1165] Boy, I wonder, did that person really get saved or was that just lip service?
[time=1170] And for those of you who are here this morning that have made no profession of faith yet.
[time=1175] You're the esteemed group of people that we are so thankful for, the group of seekers that may be with us this morning.
[time=1182] You're asking really genuine questions about God.
[time=1185] You're kind of exploring this thing called Christianity and the Bible.
[time=1190] You know what, this list of eight marks of true salvation that come out of 1 Thessalonians 1,
[time=1197] this may stand for you kind of this way.
[time=1200] You know, what would happen to my life if I were to commit myself to Christ?
[time=1204] You know, where would it take me?
[time=1206] What would I be thinking about?
[time=1208] What would I be doing?
[time=1209] What would my life look like? Maybe not your job, maybe not your health.
[time=1214] This text doesn't pretend to answer those kinds of issues, but internal issues, spiritual issues.
[time=1219] You know, this commitment to Christ, where will it take me?
[time=1222] And so for you who are seeking this morning, you may want to ask yourself, do I want to go there?
[time=1227] You know, does this look like the way I want my life to turn out if I were to commit my life to Christ?
[time=1233] I'm so excited about this list because it does away with some of the faux pas,
[time=1239] with some of the misconceptions that a lot of people hold in their mind and their heart about tests of Christianity or what a true Christian might look like.
[time=1248] You're not going to hear anything in these 10 verses this morning about church attendance or church membership. It's non-existent.
[time=1256] Paul does not lift it up as a litmus of saving faith.
[time=1262] You're not going to hear anything about a profession of faith.
[time=1266] You're not going to hear him say, "Oh, I am so glad to know that you are truly saved because Timothy tells me that you said with your lips that you believe in Jesus Christ,
[time=1277] that you prayed some prayer, that you walked some aisle, that you got some sticker on your forehead, that you can't find it anywhere, that is not a true test of whether or not you're safe.
[time=1288] It is true you have to profess Christ to be saved. You have to pray to receive Christ as your Savior.
[time=1294] But a lot of people do that and they don't really get saved.
[time=1297] And so therefore it's not a good test. Coming to church is a good thing.
[time=1301] Being a part of a localist, great thing. But a lot of people do that who are not truly saved.
[time=1306] Therefore it's not a good test. You understand the difference.
[time=1310] You'll not hear him talk about a possession of the Bible.
[time=1313] It's not that you own a Bible. What you'll see is what the Bible does in your heart.
[time=1317] You're not going to hear anything about knowledge or belief systems.
[time=1323] He's not going to say, man, I'm so glad. I now believe you're saved because Timothy tells me you believe certain things to be true.
[time=1332] You have an intellectual ascent to certain facts which happen to be true as God has taught them.
[time=1337] He's not going to talk about necessarily their opinion about things.
[time=1342] This is a list that is dynamic. This is a list that cuts to the core of people's hearts and people's lives.
[time=1350] And these are unmistakable marks of true salvation.
[time=1354] So let me give you them this morning, the eight of them.
[time=1356] The first one is found in verse three and it's called a work of faith.
[time=1362] A work of faith. Look at verse three. He says constantly bearing in mind your work of faith,
[time=1368] your labor of love, and your steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ and the presence of God and our Father.
[time=1377] You will find, if you are truly born again, that something has changed inside of your heart.
[time=1391] You can call it a new orientation. You can call it a new attitude, a new perspective,
[time=1401] new desires of your heart. But what is unmistakable about true saving faith is that something has changed inside my heart.
[time=1417] Your faith in Christ is more than words. It's more than intellectual reason.
[time=1422] It's more than a belief system. It's more than a new worldview.
[time=1427] Your faith in Christ, if it is real, if it is genuine, has changed you.
[time=1432] And that change that happens inside of you affects the way you live.
[time=1441] But it is not the other way around. It is not I am going to change the way I live so that I can be different inside.
[time=1451] It is not I am going to change the way I live so that I can get saved.
[time=1458] True saving faith changes you. And because you are fundamentally changed internally, you begin to live differently in your life.
[time=1469] The best text for this is over in Ephesians. If you could hold your place in 1 Thessalonians, let me invite you to come to Ephesians 2 verses 8, 9 and 10.
[time=1477] It shows the entire progression of this whole thing. These are really familiar verses to a lot of us, but we don't often see them in their sequence.
[time=1484] Ephesians 2 verse 8 says, "For by grace you have been saved through faith." That's how we get saved.
[time=1491] We get saved through our faith. The verse continues. Not of yourselves, it is the gift of God, not as a result of works that no one should boast.
[time=1501] In other words, you don't get saved by your good works. You don't do enough good things or brownie points or whatever it is that eventually persuades God to save you.
[time=1510] Your works do not save you. You get saved by the grace of God through faith.
[time=1516] That's clear, right? But what happens to people who get saved by faith through the grace of God? Look at verse 10.
[time=1525] "For we are His workmanship created in Christ Jesus for good works which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them." What happened first?
[time=1537] The thing that happens first is we get saved by faith, not by our works. That saving faith, verse 10 says, causes us to be His workmanship, which means we are a new creature.
[time=1550] It means that we are changed. Fundamentally, we become a masterpiece of God. He changes our hearts. We are created in Christ Jesus, as it says in verse 10.
[time=1560] There is the fundamental internal change that happens when somebody comes to Christ. Then what happens next?
[time=1567] Well, look at it, verse 10. After having become His workmanship created in Christ Jesus, we do different things. We begin to do good works.
[time=1575] In fact, those good works are the things which God had intended for us to be doing from the beginning.
[time=1581] And we begin to walk differently. So now back to 1 Thessalonians, chapter 1.
[time=1589] Notice how he says it in verse 3. It is a work of faith. It is a work of faith. He is very, very clear on this issue.
[time=1597] It is the works that come as a result of saving faith that transforms your heart.
[time=1605] So the first question you have to answer this morning, if you were to be thinking about this in your own terms, is do I have a changed heart?
[time=1613] Do I have a change? Something is my orientation, my attitude, my perspective, my desires, my values, has something fundamentally changed in terms of my orientation towards God and towards people and towards my life.
[time=1625] And you are going to see some of these things highlighted as we go, what these works look like.
[time=1631] But the beginning point is this. It is a work of faith. It is the stuff that happens in your life as a result of faith.
[time=1639] The second one is also found in verse 3. There is first the work of faith and then you'll see there is a labor of love.
[time=1648] If you are truly born again, you will find that this has drastically affected the way you feel and the way you think and the way you relate to people.
[time=1665] True saving faith drastically changes the way that you feel and the way you think and the way you relate to people.
[time=1673] The word labor, look at it in verse 3, it's called a labor of love. The word in the Greek means to work yourself to the place of exhaustion.
[time=1680] And love simply means that sense of affection and action for other people.
[time=1686] Salvation changes you so fundamentally that it opens your heart differently to people.
[time=1693] You care differently about people than before you got saved.
[time=1697] They matter to you in ways that they did not previously matter. Salvation teaches us how to care for people and think about people and act on their behalf.
[time=1709] In ways that we have never done before. Romans chapter 5 explains that.
[time=1714] It says that when a person is truly saved that the quote here is, that the love of God has been shed abroad in their hearts.
[time=1721] Salvation, true salvation is not just the forgiveness of sins. As you saw at the first point it is a change of your heart and then it is the addition of the love of God.
[time=1730] And that's not some ethereal nice phrase. That is a reality. That is a substance. That is a commodity.
[time=1736] The love of God is shed abroad in your heart and it radically affects then the way that you see and think and perceive and act towards other people.
[time=1747] It's an amazing thing. I feel most saved.
[time=1753] My subjective sense of my salvation is strongest.
[time=1758] When I see people, not by their ability, not by their functionality, not by their wealth, their position or their appearance.
[time=1771] When I don't see them at those things at all, I see them as individual image bearers.
[time=1778] When I see them as human beings stripped of all of that other stuff and I see their heart. I see a mind.
[time=1785] I see a human being. I see a soul.
[time=1788] And I need more of this in my life. I don't mean to hold myself up as this great example that I walk around and I'm blind to everybody's attributes.
[time=1795] I just see souls and hearts and minds. I wish it were more true of me.
[time=1798] But I must confess there are times and they kind of sneak up on me.
[time=1802] When all of a sudden I don't see those things, I am moved in my heart and I see the heart and the mind and the soul of another individual, save or unsafe.
[time=1810] And I am moved with compassion for that individual.
[time=1815] That is a mark of being born again.
[time=1818] That is the love of God that has been shed abroad in our hearts.
[time=1824] To help you understand this a little bit more sometimes, like in my relationship with my wife, I can see her simply as a mother.
[time=1832] And I relate to her as the mother of our kids.
[time=1835] And I think of her in terms of her performance and her abilities and her strengths and her weaknesses in that arena of life.
[time=1842] I can see her as my wife.
[time=1844] That's my view. That's my take. That's my paradigm.
[time=1848] How is she relating to me as a wife, strengths and weaknesses?
[time=1852] And the others aren't wrong. I mean, we all do that. That's part of being a leader. That's part of seeing somebody.
[time=1857] I'm not trying to throw that out. I'm trying to say, but there is a whole mother level that sneaks up in my heart occasionally.
[time=1862] That is the stuff of regeneration. That is the mark of true salvation. And it is this.
[time=1868] I don't see her as mother. I don't see her as a wife. I see her as a person, a heart, a soul and a life.
[time=1875] And feelings, strong feelings about her past and how she was raised and the pains and the sorrows and the joys of her past are flush in my heart.
[time=1886] And her life right now, the things that are good, the things that are bad, the way I hurt or help and the kids and people.
[time=1895] Suddenly, there's this wonderful, precious human being there and I just feel a sense of wanting to care for and invest in and think more about and help.
[time=1906] Suddenly, how she relates to my kids, irrelevant. How she relates to me, irrelevant.
[time=1912] There's this suspended place where the love of God moves in my heart and there's a deep sense of concern for her as a human being.
[time=1921] I occasionally feel that for other people. It ought to be normative. I need to grow in it, but that is the stuff.
[time=1928] That is what he means when he talks about a labor of love.
[time=1933] It's to be moved. It's to be moved in your heart with compassion, understanding and insight towards a fellow image bearer.
[time=1941] And want to give yourself, want to work, want to see how to enhance and strengthen the existence of that other individual without any regard
[time=1950] of how that will play back in a positive way into your life.
[time=1955] The third characteristic is also found in verse 3. It's called steadfastness of hope.
[time=1961] The word steadfastness, and there are two concepts being described in this one phrase. We'll start with the first and then we'll move to the second.
[time=1966] The first is steadfastness. The second is hope. The word steadfastness means endurance.
[time=1973] You will know that you are truly born again when you have a sense of staying power in your life as it relates to your relationship and your allegiance to Christ.
[time=1991] Even when it gets hard. Even when it gets painful. Even when it gets costly. People that really are saved are very aware that their life is still hard.
[time=2005] In fact, because they are following Christ, it may be harder than it was before. Some of the things that they are now going to be a legion to.
[time=2016] You know, when you come to Christ, you say Christ, you are my Lord. You are my Master. This is the living Word of God.
[time=2022] I purpose in my heart to live according to all the truth in this book because it is the living inspired Word of God.
[time=2029] And people find out sometimes, not everybody, but oftentimes people will find out, you know what, this is making my life harder.
[time=2036] This is taking my life in a direction I wouldn't have wanted to go in and of myself.
[time=2043] But even in those times, there is a very acute awareness of that, but there is a stronger sense in the heart of a born again person that says, I'm going to stick it out.
[time=2054] I'm going to go the distance. I'm going to continue to follow the Word of God, even though it takes me into harder places than I otherwise would have had to go.
[time=2065] Allegiance about, you know, there are some of you who will suffer in the marketplace. You may not get the promotion. You may not be as well liked.
[time=2075] Some of you will advance in the marketplace because of your calling and your submission to Christ because these are honorable and integrable things.
[time=2082] And there are some environments in which it will help you, but others of you will find that to really walk with Christ, to really abide with Christ, is closing some doors, is shutting you out of some opportunities, is diminishing your...
[time=2094] And truly born again people will see that, they'll recognize that, and they'll still choose allegiance. They'll stay steadfast, they'll endure.
[time=2105] Some will find that this allegiance impacts their married life, and they are very aware that they may be mismatched.
[time=2114] Maybe they should never have gotten married, and maybe the continuation of this marriage represents now a lifelong process of being married to the wrong person who continues to hurt me,
[time=2122] who continues to be leaving me unsatisfied, who on and on, and the list can be long, but there is still in their heart a knowledge that God has not allowed them to divorce that person.
[time=2133] You know, and the Bible gives two reasons for that, adultery and desertion, and for those who have those, I mean, that's not only okay, I mean, that's as God, I mean, that's to be affirmed.
[time=2141] They're not second class citizens if those two categories exist. I'm not talking about those now, I'm talking about where there are no grounds, and there is no issue there except these, what was said earlier, allegedly irreconcilable differences.
[time=2152] And you know the fact is a lot of differences are irreconcilable, and a lot of people will never really be as happy as they could have been if they'd married somebody else, but they stay, and they are steadfast, and they are true, and they are obedient, and they walk down that path, and it is an evidence that they are truly saved.
[time=2171] Persecution. Paul, as you know, got physically beat, imprisoned, and put in stocks because of his faith in Christ, and it never turned him away from Christ. He was steadfast.
[time=2183] Now, I said there was a second concept in this point, and look at it again now.
[time=2187] In verse 3 it talks about steadfastness of hope, hope. And what that means is not only does the believer stay the course, but the believer stays the course with a perspective that you know what's coming is awesome.
[time=2205] What's coming makes it worth it.
[time=2208] What's coming in heaven is so wonderful that I not only stay this course, I stay it with a sense of expectation.
[time=2216] It's a little bit like the way you and I act when we are getting ready to go on vacation, and you know how hard it is to get everything done, and to get everything organized, and do all the extra stuff you've got to do, plus to get ready to go, plus you know you're going to be gone for a week, so you've got to cover a million gazillion different things, and you end up staying up like unbelievable amount of hours, and you get an unbelievable amount of work to get done, and you accomplish so much stuff, but you don't feel tired really, you don't feel exhausted, you're not regretting all that because you know that on Monday you're out of here.
[time=2244] And somehow that reality of what the vacation is going to hold makes an enormous amount of work possible without a feeling of resentment.
[time=2255] That's what this is about.
[time=2257] It is steadfastness, it is an ability to stay the course, but it isn't a resentful steadfastness, it isn't an angry steadfastness, it isn't a begrudging steadfastness, it isn't a resentful thing at all.
[time=2267] It is a sense of, you know what, I can do this, I can get this done, I can continue to suffer, I can continue to be persecuted, I can stay in this marriage, I can continue to miss the opportunity in the marketplace, why?
[time=2280] Because I know where I'm going, and I know what it's worth, I know what it's going to look like, and if this is the price I have to pay for that, no problem, I mean problem, but no problem.
[time=2292] That's what it means, that's the mark of a true believer.
[time=2296] That's a mark of, that's what Abraham did when he, you know, was asked to offer up his son, and he didn't want to offer up his son, and he loved his son, but he knew that his faith was real, and that God was powerful, and that however God was going to work that out in the future, that was going to be up to God, and so he lifted that knife.
[time=2312] That's what Daniel did when he said, you know, I'm not going to compromise, I've been praying to God all my life, and I don't care who, which political enemies have now assembled and gotten the powers to be to make prayer illegal, I'm just going to go, and I'm going to pray.
[time=2325] And whenever the consequences are, I'll suffer them, because I know to whom I pray, and I know the future, in the sense that I know there's life after death, I am hopeful, and so he was steadfast with hope.
[time=2334] He was steadfastly praying, and knowing that that's okay, I'm not resentful in this, I don't pray out of a sense of duty or obligation, which I didn't have to do this, which I had another way, no, that's what I do, I pray, and I'm hopeful, because I know the future is in the hands of my God.
[time=2351] It's the difference between Peter and Judas.
[time=2355] Peter, as you know, was unfaithful and so was Judas, but Peter was steadfast, steadfastness doesn't mean you never fall down, steadfastness doesn't mean you never scrape your knee, steadfastness doesn't mean you ever want to quit, or think about quitting, or try to quit, or temporarily quit, it means that you get back up and you continue on and you're on your path.
[time=2373] And that's what Peter did, Judas, he quit, he just flat out quit, he was not a believer, he was not a true believer, and the Bible is very clear about that.
[time=2381] You did not see the steadfastness, if Judas had been a true believer, he might have betrayed the Lord, but he would have then come back and sought forgiveness and had been among the twelve.
[time=2389] They wouldn't have been picking a twelfth guy, because it wouldn't have been an emptiness there, there wouldn't have been a hole in the lineup.
[time=2396] The fourth mark of a true believer, the fourth mark of a true believer is the power of the word, it's the power of the word.
[time=2404] This book right here, the one you have, stops being a book, and it starts being the instrument through which God penetrates your heart.
[time=2414] Truly born again people give testimony to the fact that this book among a different than all the other books of the world has a power to clarify truth and call them to obedience and enlighten their heart and inspire their minds and encourage them in a way that no other book can
[time=2432] look at verse five for just a second here you say and see I'm so excited you guys are truly saved, why how do I know that?
[time=2438] Well look at verse five, for our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power, that's the word Dunamos, dynamite, in power and in the Holy Spirit will full conviction, full conviction.
[time=2451] True believers can give testimony and if you give your life to Christ or if you have given your life to Christ, you will know that this book is not just a book
[time=2461] this book is a wellspring of life, this book is the ever living inspired word of God and it may not throw your heart every single time you come, it's not a magic wand to fix all your problems, it can't instantly change your mood and if you struggle with depression you read the book, you still struggle with depression, it's not a cure all, it is alive and it is active and you can sense that the true and living God speaks to you through His true and living Word and it does bring something in your heart, full conviction.
[time=2490] True believers know that.
[time=2494] That's what happens in the heart of a truly born again person and as a result they begin to long for the pure milk of the Word, they begin to want to study the Bible, they want to know the Bible, they want to understand the Bible because it is to them something entirely and uniquely different.
[time=2508] It is God speaking and laying out the path of life and the way of relationships and how to resolve conflicts and how to handle money and how to treat unsafe people and how to worship.
[time=2519] I mean it holds everything of any real value right here and so they begin to study the Word of God, they become students of the Word of God, that doesn't mean they go to seminary, it doesn't mean they have to join BSF, which is great, either of those, it just means you'll find that there is a thirst and there is an ever-growing appetite to know and understand
[time=2537] and reflect and think upon the Word of God.
[time=2540] It is an undeniable characteristic of people who are truly born again.
[time=2550] And you know what, when it comes in full conviction, true believers, people who are truly born again, they may want to go in a particular direction and they've got it, it's wrong and they've got all the reasons, they've got all the explanations, they've got all the rationale in the world.
[time=2566] But when they return back to the truth of God and if they'll actually look at a passage that relates to that wrong or errant behavior, they will eventually say, "You know what, that's right, I'm wrong, it's true."
[time=2580] Now they may choose to disobey it, but they will in their hearts, in their heart of hearts, they will know, "This is true, I am wrong."
[time=2592] And they do that not out of expectation, they say that not out of obligation, they don't say it because in theory it ought to be right, they don't say it from a felt need, it just springs up within them.
[time=2602] If you're truly born again, when you read this book, you may not obey it perfectly, you may not even like what it says, but you will know that it is true.
[time=2611] It's just, I can't avoid it, I can't escape it. I remember as a college student trying to junk my Christian faith and trying to take a secular book, a course on philosophy, and it was hopeless, I couldn't shift my paradigm.
[time=2627] I tried so very hard to believe that this wasn't true and that another way of thinking was, and it was impossible to do.
[time=2637] Number five, number five is an interesting thing, and it happens instinctively, as found in verse six, it's called becoming an imitator of Christ, imitators of Christ.
[time=2650] He says of them, "I'm so excited that I know you're truly safe." Well, how do I know you're truly safe? Well, look at verse six, you also became imitators of us and of the Lord having received the word in much tribulation with the joy of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2664] Do you know what happens to people who truly come to Christ, they become a child of God?
[time=2669] And have you ever noticed how children want to be like their parents?
[time=2672] It's just the most natural, instinctive thing you've ever seen in all your life. I've seen it all my life. I have five kids, and to wonder, they all kind of want to be like you.
[time=2682] And the first four were girls, and now with the last one being a little boy, I don't know. I mean, I guess girls like to be more like their moms than their dads, and maybe boys like to be more like I would hope, I guess that's the way it's supposed to work.
[time=2694] But it's scary. I mean, it's terrifying, and if you're a dad and you have a child and particularly a son or if you're a mom and you have a daughter, you know what it's like.
[time=2701] And you don't even know it. You're not even cognitively aware of the fact that your child is over there watching what you do.
[time=2707] And if you have your hand behind your back, you suddenly look over there and he has his hand behind his back.
[time=2711] It's like, what is that about? Where does that come from? He checks in with me all the time. What are we wearing today?
[time=2718] What do we wear today? What are we wearing today? We're gonna wear shorts, we're gonna wear long pants. We're gonna wear jeans, tennis shoes. What do you got?
[time=2723] He wants to know. Boom, he disappears, comes back, we got the same thing on. Where does that come from?
[time=2728] What is that about? I don't know, but it's part of how it works in salvation.
[time=2736] When you are born again and you are become a child of God, there's something in your heart that looks at Christ and says, you know something, you are everything.
[time=2746] You are the way that life is supposed to be lived. And I don't mean that you gotta become a carpenter and get crucified, become a religious leader.
[time=2756] That's not at all what it means to become like Christ. It is the way your attitudes and your perspectives and your values and the way you treated people and the way you handled money and the way you prioritized your life, you, I don't know, I want to be like you.
[time=2770] There is nothing repulsive in you. There is nothing about you that I don't want to be like.
[time=2778] Now, I know one of us live up to it. I fall short of it. But if you ask me in the heart of hearts, if there was any one human being, I could be like.
[time=2788] In an instant, the answer comes back, Christ.
[time=2794] He becomes the standard of how we are to live and think and act and choose. And again, it is not because somebody told us we had to think that way.
[time=2802] We don't want to become like Christ because somebody said, you know, you better want to be like Christ.
[time=2808] It's just instinctive. You come to Christ, you get saved, it happens, and suddenly boom.
[time=2814] There you are, looking, wishing, wanting, emulating, imitating.
[time=2820] The word in the Greek is "taminic." Well, mimics, little Christians, Christians, not in name only, but from our hearts.
[time=2829] Number six, number six, this is an amazing one. This is backwards.
[time=2834] It's also found in verse six and it's entitled "Joy." People who have really come to Christ are joyful in, now watch this, this is the twist, tribulation.
[time=2844] People who have truly come to Christ are actually joyful, not happy, and they wouldn't choose it.
[time=2849] And they're not sadomasochistic, but they are joyful in this, they're tribulations.
[time=2854] This is an uncharacteristic thing of people, but it is always characteristic of believers who are walking, you know, with the Lord.
[time=2861] See it in verse six, you also became mimics or imitators of us and of the Lord.
[time=2866] Now watch, it brings in another point here, having received the word of God in much tribulation with what, with the joy of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2873] We don't know the exact tribulation that these people were going through.
[time=2876] We know a lot about the kinds that the Hebrews went through, they were getting the property seized, they were being thrown in jail, they were being socially ostracized, some of them were being killed.
[time=2883] Some of that no doubt could have been going on here, it really doesn't matter, does it?
[time=2887] The thing is this, that even though their life got really, really hard, even though tribulation came, and what they were hoping would happen with their life, and their wife, and their kids, and their house, and their job wasn't happening, they were joyful.
[time=2901] They were purposefully joyful in the midst of that, and you understand James 1 explains that, he says,
[time=2908] "Consider it all, joy my brother, and win, you encounter various trials." And the answer is, the question is why?
[time=2914] Well here it is, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance, endurance will have its perfect result that you may be complete, lacking in nothing.
[time=2923] The Christian walks into a trial and says, you know, this is a clarification of values exercised.
[time=2929] Do I want to be happy circumstantially, or do I want to continue to be looking like Christ?
[time=2933] Do I really want to be an imitator of Christ?
[time=2935] Well this trial holds the pressure, and the pain, and the stripping, and the removal of my sinful selfishness that still lingers in me, this trial has the ability to strip some of that stuff away.
[time=2948] And so I am actually joyful, that God loves me, that God is with me in this trial, and that if I submit, God will use this trial to make me look more like what I really want to look like, which is Christ.
[time=2960] And it isn't that they say that they don't feel the sting of the whip on their back, it isn't to say that they can't experience the pain that stocks put you in, it isn't to say that they don't hurt when they lose a job, it isn't to say that they don't hurt when they lose a child.
[time=2975] All that hurts, that's called being well adjusted, but there is amidst that a joy that I have a sovereign God who is committed to me and who will never let me fall from his hand, and who if I will respond to this rightly will take and change my life.
[time=2989] Even more to be like Christ, I like that, I'm happy about that, I can be joyful in the fact, yeah, wouldn't choose it, would change it if I could, I can't, I'm going to walk through it, and I'm not just going to, again, I'm not going to endure this thing or survive this thing.
[time=3005] I rejoice, I rejoice in this whole thing.
[time=3010] Number seven, two more to go man, we're almost done, thanks for hanging in there.
[time=3014] Verse seven tells us that a seventh mark of people who are truly born again is that they become examples.
[time=3021] So that you, verse seven, so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia.
[time=3028] It doesn't mean perfect, it doesn't mean sinless, it says that your life is beginning to show the signs of walking with Christ.
[time=3038] The Greek word for example is tupto, tupto, and it's what gets left when somebody punches you.
[time=3044] It's the mark that they leave on your body when they're done hitting you.
[time=3048] And what he is saying is that Christ has so left his impact on you.
[time=3054] You have become a mark, you know that, like when you get under the influence of a coach, and if he's a powerful dynamic coach, you're going to pick up something of his style, or maybe his attitude, or his hustle, or his way of getting things done.
[time=3067] And you can go to another place and play ball, and if it's a small enough circle, and your coach is well enough known, they'll say, "Oh, you played for so-and-so."
[time=3074] I can see the lingering mark of coach so-and-so on your play, on your attitude, on your philosophy of this game.
[time=3082] It's a great thing.
[time=3086] Truly save people, respond to life, and make choices in life that let you say be like them.
[time=3096] They have the mark of Christ in their life.
[time=3099] They have gone through this stuff, they have weathered these storms, they have allowed the Word of God to be convicting, they have become the imitators just instinctively.
[time=3107] And now, I want you to know they're an example of how we ought to live.
[time=3110] Look over there, look at that faith, look at what that looks like.
[time=3115] It's not something you strive for, it's not something you take pride in, it's not something you want to hear that people are saying, "Oh man, you're so incredible, you're such a great Christian, you're a great example."
[time=3125] That's the furthest thing from your mind.
[time=3127] That's not what it's about.
[time=3128] It happens incidentally.
[time=3130] You are so in love with Christ, so transformed by this faith that changes your insides.
[time=3135] You begin to love people the way that it does.
[time=3138] You stay steadfast.
[time=3140] The Word of God continues to convict your heart, you try to be like Christ and suddenly without even realizing it, you have become an example.
[time=3149] That's how it works, that's how it works in their life and that's why he's so excited.
[time=3153] I know you're saved, I know you're saved.
[time=3156] I have no question in my mind that you're saved.
[time=3159] Wow, you've even become, you've gone all the way down that path to becoming an example to other believers.
[time=3165] The last one is found in verses 8, 9, and 10, this is exciting.
[time=3169] It cycles back to being a witness, being evangelistic, telling other people about the great thing you've found.
[time=3176] Look at verse 8, "For the Word of the Lord has sounded forth from you, not only in Macedonia and Okah, but also in every place.
[time=3182] Your faith toward God has gone forth, so that we have no need to say anything.
[time=3186] For they themselves report about us what kind of a reception we had with you and how you turn to God from idols and how you serve the living and true God
[time=3194] and how you wait for his son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead.
[time=3197] That is Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come." What is that? That's their testimony.
[time=3203] Born again, people have a witness to the world.
[time=3205] If you are truly born again, you will inevitably be a light in the darkness.
[time=3210] You will inevitably be something that other people look at, unsaved people and say, "Now, what is it about those priorities, that direction of life, that way of doing life that is so appealing, that is so soft, that is so genuine, that is so strong,
[time=3223] that is so authentic, that is so all those things." And they begin to understand, "Oh my goodness, yeah, sure, yeah, you're one of those.
[time=3232] You're a true believer." It's the inevitable result of saving faith.
[time=3237] You see, because saving faith so changes your heart and your life that you end up living so differently, that you end up being a witness to Christ, whether you open your mouth or not.
[time=3246] Now, we're supposed to open our mouths and we're supposed to build relationships with unsaved people.
[time=3250] We're supposed to be proactive in our witnessing to build relationships, but it even happens if you're not, because you changed, you're different.
[time=3260] So, how are we doing this morning?
[time=3263] How can you know that you are saved?
[time=3266] What should your assurance be when you put your head on your pillow at night and you wonder, "Gee whiz, I wonder if this is a hoax.
[time=3274] I wonder if this is real. I wonder if I'm really born again." What kinds of things should you look for in your life?
[time=3282] What kinds of questions should you ask yourself to answer that question?
[time=3286] How can you know or have some subjective sense of peace or concern over a friend or a family member
[time=3294] or somebody who may have led to Christ?
[time=3296] I wonder if it really took. I wonder if it's genuine.
[time=3299] Of course, these are not to be done instantly. This is over a period of time, a pattern, even as Paul had time to reflect as these people were moving down their life.
[time=3307] You are here this morning as seekers.
[time=3310] You say, "Well, what will salvation lead to in my life?
[time=3313] What kind of person might I become?" Well, eight things really, at least, probably more, but there will be a work of faith.
[time=3323] Faith will have worked such a thing in your heart that you will be changed internally and it will result in different things on the outside.
[time=3330] You will have a different feeling and thought process and orientation towards people.
[time=3334] You will have deep abiding, selfless affection and a desire to invest in their lives to enhance their existence.
[time=3342] You will find that you will choose allegiance to the Word of God over your own comfort and not out of a sense of regret, but with real hope because you know that what he holds for you in the future is worth any tribulation in the present.
[time=3356] You will find that the Word of God is really able to convict your heart and to tell you the truth and you won't have to force yourself to think of it as truth.
[time=3366] It will be a priori. It will be the only way to look at it.
[time=3370] It is true. It will become your rock. It will become your anchor.
[time=3375] It will become your point of conviction to stay.
[time=3378] Stay you in times of hardship, to lift your heart in times of hardship.
[time=3382] You will find number five that you will become an imitator of Christ.
[time=3385] It will be provoked from within.
[time=3387] It will not be something you stir up on your own.
[time=3389] You will see him, you will want to study him, you will want to learn about his life, you will want to emulate who he is and how he does.
[time=3396] You will find that you have the ability to find joy, even amidst tribulation.
[time=3400] You will find that you are an example and that will surprise you.
[time=3404] But other people will start looking at how you handle that situation and say, you know that just I think that's it, that's how I ought to do it.
[time=3411] You will find that God uses you as a witness to be one of the many.
[time=3416] That God will use you to help other people come to Christ and find the same transforming reality of Christ.
[time=3425] Well, let me invite you to stand as we close our service and prayer.
[time=3430] Our great God and Heavenly Father, faith is such an invisible thing, isn't it?
[time=3440] I mean, how are we to know what we said to you and whether we meant it?
[time=3444] How are we to know how you responded to it?
[time=3446] And how are we to know if this prayer of faith actually saved us and brought us into the kingdom?
[time=3452] Thank you, Father, that you have passages like this in the scriptures which lay that out for us
[time=3458] and which don't put us in a position to judge anybody or even to be dogmatic about ourselves
[time=3464] but to say, hey, you know, these things are either present or they're not present.
[time=3467] These things are increasing or they're not present.
[time=3471] Thank you for giving us real dynamic criteria by which to take and test ourselves
[time=3477] whether we are in the faith.
[time=3479] For those here this morning who are seeking, I pray that what they see here is appealing.
[time=3483] I pray that you will bolster their faith, that you will help them take a step towards you, that they can find that these dynamics will become true in their life.
[time=3492] For those who are believers but who have been in sin and who have fallen away and who can barely see even the slightest flicker of these things in their life,
[time=3502] help them to repent, help them to stand strong and find them vibrant again.
[time=3508] For those who think they're saved and not, the most perilous positionable, for those who are here today who have thought themselves saved and are not because there is no evidence.
[time=3517] Speak to them clearly, speak to them clearly and draw them to yourself.
[time=3522] You pray these things in Christ's name and all God's people said.
[time=3525] Amen. God bless you.
