[time=30] And you can almost hear them asking the question, "Where is God in all of this?"
[time=48] I thought we gave our lives to a loving, gracious, compassionate God who sent His Son to save
[time=54] us from our sins.
[time=56] Where is this good God in the midst of our persecution?
[time=60] Why doesn't He stop it?
[time=62] Isn't God supposed to be good?
[time=66] Isn't He supposed to love us?
[time=69] Does He want us to suffer like this?
[time=73] You see, these are questions that surface in their heart and minds as they go through their affliction.
[time=78] And we know these are their questions because, frankly, these are the same questions we ask of our situation when we begin to suffer, a death or a diagnosis of cancer or a desertion
[time=90] of a loved one or loneliness that just seems never to go away or families that are broken.
[time=96] What are we supposed to say to each other amidst our affliction?
[time=100] How are we supposed to think about our God?
[time=103] So this morning, we find that Paul addresses this very issue.

[time=820] Our glory and honor are here to receive, to receive, to receive, to receive, to receive.
[time=832] A million separate voices isn't what He longs to hear, but when our voices are united
[time=856] we are present to His ears when our thoughts are not scattered and our spirits are one.
[time=870] We can worship the Father and His glory will come.
[time=882] And the glory of the Lord fills the house.
[time=893] Jesus is the Son, as He belongs in our power.
[time=918] And the glory of the Lord fills the house.
[time=926] By Father's household there is room for everyone.
[time=934] When God's people join together, in Jesus Christ the Son.
[time=944] When we all join together, rising up in one accord,
[time=953] we become a holy temple for the glory of the Lord.
[time=964] And the glory of the Lord fills the house.
[time=975] His presence is felt as He comes in our power.
[time=987] His voice can be learned with the healing.
[time=994] The sound as the glory of the Lord fills the house.
[time=1019] His presence is felt as He comes in our power.
[time=1031] His voice can be learned with the healing.
[time=1038] The sound as the glory has the glory.
[time=1049] The glory has the glory.
[time=1057] The glory has the glory as the glory fills the house.
[time=1077] Has the glory of the Lord fills the house.
[time=1107] The glory has the glory and the Holy Son.
[time=1190] Well, if you have your Bible with you this morning, let me invite you to open it to 1 Thessalonians chapter 3.
[time=1196] We've been studying this wonderful book in the Bible and trying to glean and understand what God would teach us about our lives as we reflect on the way that these believers in Thessalonia encountered life.
[time=1211] If you've been with us, you know that these Thessalonians are under attack.
[time=1216] They're a brand new, young, fledgling little flock of God that has come under attack by some religious leaders in that city who are threatened and jealous and antagonistic against the faith as it has come for the first time in the history of the world to this little city called Thessalonica.
[time=1234] We don't know exactly the nature of the attack.
[time=1236] The Scripture doesn't give us specifics. We do know that Paul was under attack after his departure.
[time=1243] These false religious leaders began to say all kinds of untrue things about him, his motives, his ministry, his message.
[time=1251] All about him was the scope of their attack and then apparently in addition to that, they began to persecute those Christians who had come to Christ under his ministry there in Thessalonica.
[time=1261] They were no doubt becoming outcasts in that city, socially ostracized.
[time=1266] Their businesses and ability to make a living were no doubt threatened.
[time=1270] They may have even had the seizure of their property as so many other Christians in that day had undergone.
[time=1275] Some of them may have been imprisoned and some might even have been put to death.
[time=1280] This is pretty severe stuff. This is real trials and real afflictions that these folks are suffering through.
[time=1287] Paul sends Timothy back, having had to leave Thessalonica in a hurry, to find out about the welfare of their faith.
[time=1294] And he is delighted to know that they are standing strong in their faith.
[time=1297] They are truly converted, that their prayers of faith were not just mere words, but they actually took the Word of God for what it is, the Word of God, the transforming power of God came in, changed their hearts.
[time=1308] They're actually born again believers.
[time=1310] He rejoices over that in chapter 1.
[time=1313] And then in the first half of chapter 2, he begins by giving a defense of himself against these accusations.
[time=1321] And we studied that. It's an amazing testament of his heart, his ministry, his motive, his life.
[time=1327] In the second half of chapter 2, he begins to defend the Thessalonian believers against their accusers.
[time=1334] So he not first just defends himself, but then he later defends them against those same accusations and accusers.
[time=1341] But what remains after those defenses have been made is the persecution. It hasn't gone anywhere.
[time=1347] It's as if they're saying, "Okay, Paul, we trust you. We know who you are. We remember those things.
[time=1353] We put our faith in Christ through you. You're a trustworthy servant of God." Okay, we're all right with that.
[time=1359] And okay, we understand ourselves better now, too, and who we are in the midst of all that stuff.
[time=1365] So what, Paul, nothing you've said so far takes away the afflictions and the pain and the suffering and the hardship of being a Christian in Thessalonica.
[time=1375] That doesn't change things with respect to our daily experience.
[time=1380] We're still outcasts. We're still socially ostracized. Our businesses are still failing.
[time=1386] Our property is still being seized.
[time=1389] The vice of this persecution is still closing in on our lives.
[time=1394] And you can almost hear them asking the question, "Where is God in all of this?"
[time=1401] I thought we gave our lives to a loving, gracious, compassionate God who sent His Son to save us from our sins.
[time=1409] Where is this good God in the midst of our persecution?
[time=1413] Why doesn't He stop it? Isn't God supposed to be good?
[time=1419] Isn't He supposed to love us? Does He want us to suffer like this?
[time=1426] You see, these are questions that surface in their heart and minds as they go through their affliction.
[time=1431] And we know these are their questions because, frankly, these are the same questions we ask of our situation when we begin to suffer.
[time=1439] A death or a diagnosis of cancer or a desertion of a loved one or loneliness that just seems never to go away or families that are broken.
[time=1449] What are we supposed to say to each other amidst our affliction?
[time=1453] How are we supposed to think about our God?
[time=1456] Well, this morning we find that Paul addresses this very issue.
[time=1461] As it begins chapter 3, he makes three important statements about affliction and suffering.
[time=1468] And it is in the context of this book saying this, if you're going to grow up, if you're going to move from your fledgling new status as optimistic, overly optimistic and naive believers,
[time=1481] if you're going to move to the status of a seasoned saint, these are the things you must begin to understand and embrace about life.
[time=1490] Let me read these first four verses and then I'll give you the three statements that Paul makes and hopefully help you understand them and recommit your lives to these great truths.
[time=1500] Chapter 3, verse 1, "Therefore, when we could endure it no longer, we thought it best to be left behind at Athens alone."
[time=1507] And we sent Timothy our brother and God's fellow worker in the Gospel of Christ to strengthen and encourage you as to your faith.
[time=1516] Verse 3, "So that no man may be disturbed by these afflictions, for you yourselves know that we have been destined for this.
[time=1525] For indeed, when we were with you, we kept telling you in advance that we were going to suffer affliction and so it came to pass as you know."
[time=1535] Three important truths that a young believer has to embrace has to begin to live if they are going to transition to the place called "season saint" or a mature believer.
[time=1545] The first is found in verse 3 and I call it this, "season saints manage their afflictions."
[time=1553] A godly believer, a mature believer learns to manage their afflictions. Look at it, verse 3 says this,
[time=1559] "So that no man may be disturbed by these afflictions." What does that mean?
[time=1565] What does it mean not to be disturbed by your suffering, not to be disturbed by your affliction?
[time=1571] Does it mean that we can't cry or weep or hurt or feel disappointment or sadness or even ask God from the bottom of our heart to take away the suffering and the affliction to change our circumstances?
[time=1584] Well, I don't think it means we can't do that, I don't think that means you're disturbed by your affliction, I think that's a normal healthy reaction to affliction.
[time=1593] In fact, Jesus did all of the above. When he was suffering and when he was under affliction, he cried and he wept and he hurt.
[time=1600] He was disappointed, he was saddened and he even cried out that God would take the cup from him.
[time=1606] That's not what it means to not be disturbed. This word disturbed comes in its original language.
[time=1614] It means literally to shake or to wag. It's the action and most often used of what a dog does with his tail.
[time=1625] A dog uses his tail and he wags it and he wags his whole body and he gets his whole body shaking.
[time=1631] And he in that allures you to himself. He fascinates you, he draws you, he flatters you to come and give whatever he wants.
[time=1639] Let him out of his pin, feed him, pet him, throw the ball, whatever it is, he wags, he wiggles.
[time=1648] The picture I have here is of a little boy sent to do his early morning chores.
[time=1654] Doesn't want to go out there and feed the horses, doesn't want to go out there and feed the pigs, doesn't want to go out there and do all that stuff in the early freezing morning hours.
[time=1664] When as he breaks outside of his house, he looks over in the pin and hears his faithful dog.
[time=1671] And the dog is just, you know, doing that thing. Hi, let me out of here. We can do this together.
[time=1678] And the little boy not wanting to do his chores goes over, lets the dog out, they begin to play, he gets caught up in the allurement and the fascination of the dog and time goes by.
[time=1688] The pigs don't get fed, cows don't get fed, the chores don't get done.
[time=1693] The little boy has left his path. The little boy has shirked his responsibilities.
[time=1698] He has failed to do his duty. He has left the path.
[time=1703] That is exactly what Paul says, season saints learn not to let happen to them when they are amidst affliction, look at it again, verse 3.
[time=1710] So that none of you should be disturbed by these afflictions.
[time=1717] Understand that afflictions bring unbelievable hurt and pain and sorrow and disappointment, that's what affliction does.
[time=1725] And thereby it makes you uniquely susceptible to the allurement and the fascination and the flattery of the things of this world such that your heart would be drawn away from the right path to walk with God.
[time=1738] Don't let that happen to you.
[time=1742] Don't be disturbed. Don't be sidetracked off the path of obedience.
[time=1751] This concept is everywhere in Christendom. Paul spoke of it in his own heart here in 1 Thessalonians, he's telling others about it, but he had his own struggles with being disturbed by his afflictions.
[time=1763] In 2 Corinthians chapter 4 he says this, "Therefore since we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we do not lose heart."
[time=1772] Paul in the writing of 2 Corinthians is nearing the end of his life, he is lying on a sick bed, he has had the tar beat out of him, literally.
[time=1782] He is tired, he is wounded, he is hurting, he is discouraged.
[time=1787] He has been physically beaten, he says in the text afflicted in every way but not crushed, perplexed but not despairing, persecuted but not forsaken, struck down but not destroyed.
[time=1799] He says this, "Always carrying about in the body the dying of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body.
[time=1807] For we who live are constantly being delivered over to death for Jesus' sake, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh, so death works in us but life works in you."
[time=1819] This is that great text where he talks about the gospel having been given to him an earthen vessel, you and I are earthen vessels and we have there in this great treasure, the truth of salvation.
[time=1829] And the vessel, the earthen vessel gets absolutely beat up in the process, the afflictions come, and we take hits, we're persecuted, we're struck down, we're crushed, it's an amazing process.
[time=1843] And in that process, every believer who has ever walked that path knows that at that point the hurt and the pain, the sorrow, the discouragement makes the allurement of the world remarkably attractive.
[time=1857] We are susceptible to compromise, but a mature saint says, "No, I see what you're doing. I understand this. I know how this game is played.
[time=1873] I know that at this time in my life is not the time to make a compromising decision, even though I want to more than I ever have because I'm hurting more than I ever have."
[time=1883] Jesus in John chapter 15 is talking to the beloved and he says, "You know if the world hates you, you know that it is hated me.
[time=1894] If you were of the world, the world would love you.
[time=1898] But because you are not of the world, the world hates you.
[time=1903] Remember the word that I said to you, "A slave is not greater than his master. If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you."
[time=1911] And finally, he goes on a little bit more than finally he says this now, "These things I have spoken to you." You see, now why'd I tell you all that? What I tell you about how the world hates me and therefore the world's going to hate you because you love me.
[time=1921] You look like me, they hate you like they hate you. Why'd I say all that?
[time=1924] These things I have spoken to you that you may be kept from stumbling.
[time=1930] They will make you outcasts from the synagogue and then he goes back on to the persecution.
[time=1935] Listen, you've got to know something. You've got to know something that when you are under the persecution, when you are under the affliction, whether it be from unbelievers who are actually persecuting you or just under the general affliction of life.
[time=1948] And life is hard and dreams are broken and things aren't as fulfilling as you wish they would be. You have got to know my friends."
[time=1954] He says, "Do not be disturbed.
[time=1960] Do not let these persecutions, afflictions, hardships and trials fill your heart with so much pain that you look for relief in food or in sleep or in lust or in alcohol or in work or in money or in recreation or in laziness."
[time=1975] In other words, he'll come to you in a thousand different ways.
[time=1979] He knows you're Achilles heel. He knows your susceptibility. He knows your weaknesses.
[time=1986] And when you are under affliction, you are in a prime place to be disturbed.
[time=1991] And let me tell you something, friends, sometimes the whole battle is won or lost in your personal resolve not to let yourself be distracted.
[time=2002] You stay away from the dog. You stay away from the quick, cute little wiggle.
[time=2008] You stay away from the seductive, seemingly harmless stuff that would in fact take you away from the path of obedience.
[time=2027] It happened to the Hebrews. The Hebrews came to Christ. There's a profound conversion. They suffered for it.
[time=2036] It says in Hebrews, chapter 10, you remember the former days when after being enlightened, that means they came to Christ.
[time=2042] Listen, you endured great conflict of suffering. You were made a public spectacle through approaches and tribulations.
[time=2051] You were put in prison. You accepted joyfully the seizure of your property, knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and an abiding one.
[time=2060] That is how they started. And in the midst of the early signs of persecution and suffering and affliction, they were joyful.
[time=2066] They were happy to know that they had given their lives to Christ, but as time wore on.
[time=2071] And that affliction stayed and relief was not forthcoming. They began to waver in their faith. They began to be disturbed.
[time=2080] They began to look at the tempting, flattering thing that would draw them from the path of obedience.
[time=2088] And so the writer says, "For this reason we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away."
[time=2097] Take care, brother, unless there should be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving heart and falling away from the living God.
[time=2103] But encourage one another day after day, as long as it is still called today, lest any one of you should be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
[time=2113] Let us therefore be diligent to enter that rest lest anyone fall through following the same example of disobedience.
[time=2124] On and on he goes through the book of Hebrews, warning and exhorting and encouraging these believers, "Don't be disturbed, don't be disturbed, don't let it happen to you."
[time=2136] It happened to the Colossians. Oh, man, they came out of the idolatry. They flew into the arms of Christ.
[time=2145] They were so excited and so thrilled to be saved and to know the forgiveness of their sins, but then life got hard.
[time=2152] Life had afflictions, and life had its suffering, and life had its persecutions, and what they thought might have been a panacea and heaven on earth,
[time=2161] and one exhilarating second after the other, now that they knew Christ found out, "No, no, you know what? It's not quite that way."
[time=2168] And they got allured. They got fascinated.
[time=2173] If you read the book of Colossians, you'll know it was towards human philosophy, and others fell to legalism, and others fell to mysticism, and others fell to asceticism.
[time=2185] They were saying, "You know, if I can't find this total satisfaction thing, if I can't get my life to work exactly like I wanted to in Christ,
[time=2192] maybe I can find it in human philosophy, maybe I can find it in asceticism, self-denial, self-deprecation, beating myself,
[time=2198] maybe I can find it in legalism, maybe I can find it in mysticism."
[time=2204] It became dangerously susceptible to the flattery.
[time=2213] Probably my favorite and the most classic explanation of this disturbed comes from a psalmist who says,
[time=2220] "This surely God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart." He opens with this, "Surely God is good, isn't he?"
[time=2230] But he says in the next verse, "But as for me, my feet came close to stumbling, my steps had almost slipped."
[time=2239] Why? I had become envious of the arrogant.
[time=2244] I saw the prosperity of the wicked, for there are no pains in their death. Their body is fat.
[time=2252] They are not in trouble as other men, nor are they plague like mankind.
[time=2261] She's talking about the wealthy, and he looks at his own life, and he says, "Man, you know, I've been living my life to honor God."
[time=2272] I thought he was good. The implication is, you know, if I live my life to honor God and God is good, then I ought to be wealthy.
[time=2281] And why wouldn't God treat me the same way he treated me? Why can't I have all that stuff?
[time=2288] He says later, "Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure and washed my hands in innocence for I have been stricken all day long and chastened every morning."
[time=2296] Can I walk with a God? I think it's good? Wait a minute, let me think. He's good. I obey him. I honor him.
[time=2301] I get chastening and the wicked get the money.
[time=2305] How's that going again? I have a good God. I know my God. I love my God. I obey my God. I honor my God. I get chastening and they get the money.
[time=2320] Boy, that's for me. My feet came close to stumbling. You see, that theology, not understanding the way that works causes you to be susceptible, doesn't it?
[time=2331] To walk away from that God. To live for another God that might ease the suffering, that might grant the money.
[time=2341] Hmm.
[time=2345] Got any pain in your life?
[time=2351] Got any suffering? Got any sorrows? Whether they be climactic and all at once or whether they be slow and revealing over time?
[time=2366] You see, suffering exposes in us the sinful condition that we put on God.
[time=2374] If I honor God, if I honor you with my life, you are duty bound to reward me, to alleviate my suffering and make me happy.
[time=2388] Suffering reveals that we believe that feeling better is more important than following God.
[time=2395] It reveals that our true agenda is to have a happy life. And if God isn't so inclined to orchestrate that for us, we will question His goodness and we will fall to the fascination of the things of this world.
[time=2409] It reveals that we are more committed to making our life happy than to God Himself.
[time=2418] It shows that we turn to our God only to use Him to make us happy.
[time=2427] You see, these are the sinful thoughts that must be managed, that must be exposed, that must be repented of if we are to become the seasoned saints.
[time=2443] C.S. Lewis wrote a poem entitled As the Rain Falls. He says there, talking about his famed profession of love for God.
[time=2454] He says, you know, quote, "All this is flashy rhetoric about loving you. I never had a selfless thought since I was born.
[time=2464] I am a mercenary and self-seeking through and through. I want God, you, all friends, merely to serve my turn. Peace, reassurance, pleasure are the goals I seek.
[time=2479] I cannot crawl one inch outside my proper skin." Did you want to know who I am left to myself? I am a thoroughly, totally selfish individual who seeks God, you, friends, everyone to serve me so that I will know peace and reassurance and pleasure.
[time=2497] That's all I seek. That's all I know how to seek. I can't get out of myself. That's what I am.
[time=2503] And he hates it. Then his poem turns until he says this, "Only that now you," he's talking about pain and suffering, "only now you have taught me my lack.
[time=2518] I see the chasm and everything you are was making my heart into a bridge by which I might get back from exile and grow."
[time=2530] And then he says, "For this I bless you as the ruin falls. The pains you give me are more precious than all the other gains."
[time=2543] We must surrender our fascination with ourselves to a more worthy preoccupation with the character and purposes of God.
[time=2554] We must be able to say from our hearts, "I am not the point. You are the point. Oh God, I exist for you. You do not exist for me."
[time=2571] So, this first great truth that moves men and women to maturity is verse three so that no man may be disturbed by these afflictions.
[time=2581] We must learn to manage our trouble.
[time=2584] Number two, it's found in the end of verse three.
[time=2590] It says this, "So that no man may be disturbed by these afflictions for you yourselves know that we have been destined for this."
[time=2598] Destined for what? Destined for affliction.
[time=2602] Not only must we learn to manage them so that they lose their power or have a mitigated power to cause us vulnerability to the allurement of disobedience.
[time=2613] We must go a step further and understand that these sufferings are not an aberration to the Christian experience.
[time=2620] They are not the exception to the rule. They are not the mistake of God. They are not in fact evidence that God does not love us nor that he could not be trusted.
[time=2630] In fact, affliction and suffering and sorrow and pain is normative for Christian experience.
[time=2638] We have been destined for it.
[time=2643] Marked out in advance to experience it.
[time=2650] Listen to Peter. Peter wrote a book about suffering. First Peter chapter four says this beloved, "Do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you which comes upon you for your testing as though some strange thing were happening to you."
[time=2664] Isn't that interesting?
[time=2665] When you and I fall into hard times, when you and I find our lives taking a turn for the worse in terms of our happiness and our joy and our hopes
[time=2672] and our dreams, be loving. Do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you which comes upon you for your testing as though some strange thing were happening to you.
[time=2682] But to the degree that you share the sufferings of Christ keep on rejoicing so that also at the revelation of His glory, you may rejoice with exaltation.
[time=2693] If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.
[time=2701] He says earlier in the book, "For you have been called for this purpose."
[time=2707] What purpose?
[time=2708] Suffering.
[time=2709] "For you have been called for this purpose since Christ also suffered for you leaving you an example for you to follow in His steps."
[time=2717] Jesus said in John 16, "In the world you have tribulation."
[time=2724] It's a fact. It's normative.
[time=2729] Let me give you three reasons why.
[time=2733] And I'll go kind of fast because I'm running out of time.
[time=2737] Three reasons why you and I have suffering.
[time=2739] Three reasons why it's normative.
[time=2741] Three reasons why we have been destined for affliction the first of all is this.
[time=2745] We live in a fallen world.
[time=2747] Remember my friends, we no longer live in the Garden of Eden.
[time=2750] The sin has been introduced to the human race and to the world.
[time=2754] The world is cursed.
[time=2755] We are cursed.
[time=2756] All your friends are cursed.
[time=2758] And sin brings death, physical death, and with it all the diseases and all the sources of death, floods and hurricanes and murders and all the wars and all the stuff that comes with sin.
[time=2770] We live here.
[time=2771] This is our realm.
[time=2773] And more than that, we live in the realm of sin, relational sin.
[time=2779] And so we don't know how to love each other and we're selfish and we hurt each other.
[time=2784] We're prideful to the core.
[time=2785] We want what we want.
[time=2786] And so we continue to clash into each other for a thousand different reasons at a thousand different times all day long.
[time=2793] You and I live in a fallen world.
[time=2794] Number two, we live in a hostile world.
[time=2797] That only is it all cursed.
[time=2799] But there is the God of this age.
[time=2801] And when you and I live in a distinctly Christian way, when you and I live in a way that honors Christ,
[time=2808] we make ourselves the target of additional suffering and affliction because the world hated and persecuted Christ and every time it sees Christ in us it will do the same.
[time=2821] Now we happen to live in one of the happiest of all the countries in terms of Christianity and the absence of persecution.
[time=2829] But remember my friends, we are the exception, not the rule.
[time=2834] We are those who have been especially blessed not to have to live under political persecution where our rights are protected.
[time=2839] But this is not how most Christians have lived.
[time=2842] Most Christians, the more they look like Christ, the more gracious they are, the more they band together, the more they stand for the things and the causes of God, the more the world hates them and the more the world does to them.
[time=2853] To express that hatred.
[time=2854] The third reason is because of the promise that God has made us to make us like Christ.
[time=2861] We are destined for affliction and we should not be surprised at the fiery ordeals that come upon us
[time=2868] because we live in a fallen world and because a sinful world hates us, but beyond all that because God has promised to make us look like Christ and one of the ways He does that is He allows trials to come into our life.
[time=2878] To test and to try, to mature, to strip the facade off of our famed love for Him so that we can see just how selfish we really are.
[time=2890] Just how empty sin really is.
[time=2894] Where would we be? Where would you be today if God did not test and try you?
[time=2898] If God did not allow the trials to come into your life to knock you down, to humble your heart, to open your eyes,
[time=2905] to soften you to the things of God, I know for myself I believe I would be an absolute utter monster.
[time=2911] If not for the faithful, consistent trials that God allows in my life to remind me of the things that really matter.
[time=2919] You see, we need to understand my friends, there is no escaping trials and tribulations, afflictions and suffering.
[time=2929] We are destined for affliction. That's what He says.
[time=2932] We have been destined for it.
[time=2935] And the season saint in the moment of terror and exhaustion in the face of adversity steps back
[time=2941] and says, "My suffering is not an aberration.
[time=2944] This hardship that befalls me, the diagnosis of this cancer, the death of my spouse, the loss of my child, the loss of my job."
[time=2952] This is not an aberration. This is not an exception. This is not a mistake. This is not a lack of love on the part of God.
[time=2959] This is what it's like here.
[time=2963] And the fact is it could be so much worse.
[time=2968] So we even find a sub note of gratitude because we are the ones who get to live in the happiest of places in terms of circumstances.
[time=2978] Quickly now, let me give you the third thing He says, and this is hard to do.
[time=2983] In verse 4, He says, "For indeed we were with you, when we were with you, we kept telling you in advance that we were going to suffer affliction."
[time=2991] This is amazing. Guess what He's doing?
[time=2994] He told them to what? Anticipate it.
[time=2998] To expect it. And He doesn't mean in some general way.
[time=3002] He means, listen, don't construct a vision of your tomorrow.
[time=3009] How you want tomorrow to go. How you want the rest of this day to go.
[time=3013] That is absence of hardship and suffering and trial and affliction because you only set yourself up.
[time=3020] Instead, as you anticipate tomorrow, and it's not a sadomasochistic thing where you wish upon yourself the worst possible life.
[time=3027] It is instead the reasonable, mature understanding that a godly individual will look at tomorrow and say there's probably something in that day,
[time=3034] or the next day, or the next month, or within the next 12 months that is going to leave me profoundly hurt and disappointed and crushed and weeping and asking God to deliver me from it.
[time=3044] There's probably something like that.
[time=3047] And so I will leave room in my heart. I will leave room in my expectations. I will leave room in my attitude.
[time=3056] I will not sit there and pray, oh God, make my life perfect.
[time=3060] I will not live in such a way that I try to bind God to relieve any future suffering by my current obedience.
[time=3066] My current obedience will not be for future favors. It will be out of love for salvation that has already been granted.
[time=3074] And then to prepare me to be strong enough to face the affliction he has promised me will come.
[time=3081] My worship of God will not be to try to somehow convince him that I love him enough so that he should get rid of the affliction in my future,
[time=3091] or wipe out the hardships that are coming. Instead, it should be a worship that says, oh my God, in light of what is probably coming,
[time=3098] the hardships and the trials I say to you now, I love you and I will love you.
[time=3105] The way I think, what I dream about, what I am counting on, the goals I set
[time=3112] need to anticipate the expectation of suffering affliction, hardship, disappointment and discouragement.
[time=3122] That's how mature saints think. That's how the grown in Christ look to tomorrow.
[time=3136] Paul is with the guys at Ephesus. He's barely ready to leave. They love him so much.
[time=3147] And he's talking to him about his departure and heading back to Jerusalem.
[time=3152] He says, "And now behold bound in spirit, I am on my way to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there,
[time=3160] except that the Holy Spirit solemnly testifies to me in every city saying that bonds and afflictions await me."
[time=3171] So there you go. What's he looking for? A mass citywide crusade where thousands fall to the knee and worship Jesus
[time=3180] and extol him as the great avenge. No, no. I know where I'm going. I know what my future looks like, friends.
[time=3187] I know to anticipate my afflictions. He goes on, but I do not consider my life of any account as dear to myself.
[time=3195] In order that I may finish my course and the ministry which I receive from the Lord Jesus to testify solemnly of the gospel of the grace of God.
[time=3203] Now you and I don't have the Holy Spirit telling us, you know, like he did.
[time=3208] You know, in every city there's afflictions and it got even more poignant because a prophet in the next chapter by the name of Agabus
[time=3215] came from Judea and told him, "Coming to us he took Paul's belt." The prophet did.
[time=3221] He took Paul's belt right off his...and bound his own feet and his own hands to a little play, a little drama.
[time=3227] And said, "This is what the Holy Spirit says. In this way that Jews at Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt,"
[time=3234] the name we Paul, "and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles."
[time=3240] Verse 12, "And when we heard this, we as well as the local residents began begging him not to go to Jerusalem."
[time=3249] Paul, look, there's a prophet from God, took your belt, wrapped it up so this how they're going to treat you, Paul, don't go.
[time=3253] Please don't go. Stay here. Go somewhere else. The gospel's needed other places. Go, go, go, go.
[time=3260] Why? Because like you and like me, they don't like the notion of suffering. They don't like the notion of affliction.
[time=3266] They don't like the notion that following and obeying God includes the fact we've been destined to suffer.
[time=3274] Then Paul answered saying this, "What are you doing? Weeping like this. Why are you breaking my heart?"
[time=3281] He says, "For I am ready not only to be bound, but even to die. I am ready to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus."
[time=3296] And the next verse says, "And since He would not be persuaded, we fell silent, remarking, "Well, the will of the Lord be done."
[time=3309] How about you? How about you? How are you working with the Lord these days in your prayer life?
[time=3316] What motivates your obedience? Why do you come here to worship? Why do you give financially? How do you think about your future?
[time=3323] Are you all bound up in trying to obligate a loving and a gracious God to be good in your terms and my terms as good counts,
[time=3330] which means no suffering, no loss of children, no loss of wife, no loss of this, no loss of that?
[time=3336] New doors, exciting doors, open doors.
[time=3340] Well, we need to grow up because that's not how mature believers think.
[time=3348] Paul said, "I am prepared for the worst. I am prepared not only to be bound, I am prepared to die, so that I might be faithful,
[time=3358] so that I might not be disturbed, so that I might not see the wagging, the flattering of the alternative path."
[time=3368] Let me invite you to stand as we close in prayer.
[time=3377] Our gracious God and Heavenly Father, there are those here who know far more of affliction and suffering than I do.
[time=3386] There are those here who we don't even see as suffering because theirs is a private suffering.
[time=3391] They haven't ever openly lost a spouse or a child or a job, but there are things in their past, there are things in their heart.
[time=3399] There are unsatisfied longings, good longings that go unresolved, and their suffering is great.
[time=3407] They know far more of it than I ever have.
[time=3411] Help them, O God, and help the rest of us to manage our afflictions.
[time=3415] Help us to square up on the flattering voices that call us from obedience
[time=3421] and promise us happiness that is but a dream, it is not there, it is a lie.
[time=3428] Help us to understand our afflictions, to know that because we are fallen human beings living in this fallen world
[time=3434] and oftentimes the target of an enemy that would try to discredit us.
[time=3438] But beyond that, the children of a God who has promised to make us look like Christ, help us to understand them,
[time=3445] to welcome them, to greet them, then, as gifts from your hand.
[time=3453] And guard us, God, from trying to wrench your arm in advance through prayer or worship or giving or obedience to in some way.
[time=3468] Help us instead to see a future that understands we've been destined.
[time=3473] Destined for a lot of things, destined for eternal life, destined for eternal happiness, but destined for affliction in this world.
[time=3481] For your glory and for your honor.
[time=3484] We pray these things in Christ's name and all God's people say.
[time=3487] Amen. God bless you.
