[time=92] Welcome to the Sunday Morning Worship Service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=96] Thank you for joining us. We trust that the music and message from God's word will help you in your Christian walk.
[time=102] Please stay tuned. Now let's join our service.
[time=105] [MUSIC - 231 seconds]
[time=348] Father, we come on this first Sunday of Advent and we worship you.
[time=356] And Lord, what a beautiful picture of angels coming from the realms of glory to the town of Bethlehem to sing your praises.
[time=367] And Father, as we've sung this morning, we've sung about the angels.
[time=373] Now they sang Gloria in Excelsius Deo, Glory to God on high.
[time=379] And yet, Father, those angels, they gave their whole being to worship you, and yet you didn't come for them.
[time=389] You didn't walk with them.
[time=392] You came for us.
[time=395] You came to take our place.
[time=401] And we who are the true beneficiaries of you coming to earth and dying and rising again.
[time=409] Lord, we should all the more give you praise.
[time=412] We have so much to be thankful for.
[time=415] And as we walk through this Christmas season, may we truly realize that it is us,
[time=421] it is me individually, that you came for, that that was the whole purpose of you coming to earth as a baby.
[time=428] To walk and experience what I experience, to walk among people.
[time=435] And Lord, you truly are Emmanuel, God with us.
[time=441] And we give you all the praise and glory.
[time=445] What a beautiful name, Jesus Emmanuel.
[time=449] We give you praise.
[time=451] Out of grateful hearts and thankfulness for all that you've done for us.
[time=455] [AMEN] A sign shall be given.
[time=466] A virgin will conceal.
[time=472] A human baby bearing.
[time=477] A hunter-managed deity.
[time=483] The glory of the nations.
[time=488] A life for all to see.
[time=494] And hope for all who will embrace his war reality.
[time=506] Emmanuel, our God is with us.
[time=517] And if God is with us, who could stand against us?
[time=528] How our God is with us, Emmanuel.
[time=539] The robo to live in the shadow of death.
[time=550] The glory as light has drawn.
[time=560] For all those who stumble in the darkness,
[time=570] Behold, your light has come.
[time=578] Emmanuel.
[time=583] Our God is with us.
[time=589] And if God is with us, who could stand against us?
[time=599] How our God is with us, Emmanuel.
[time=610] So where shall be your answer?
[time=615] Oh, will you hear the call of him who did not spare the sun,
[time=625] But gave him for us all.
[time=630] On earth there is no power.
[time=635] There is no depth or height that could ever separate us.
[time=644] From the love of God in Christ.
[time=652] Emmanuel.
[time=657] Our God is with us.
[time=663] And if God is with us, who could stand against us?
[time=673] How our God is with us, Emmanuel.
[time=682] Emmanuel.
[time=687] Our God is with us.
[time=693] And if God is with us, who could stand against us?
[time=702] How our God is with us, Emmanuel.
[time=717] Roman invite you to open your Bible this morning to 1 Thessalonians chapter 4.
[time=724] We come this morning in our study of the book of 1 Thessalonians to probably the most famous
[time=730] of all the chapters from this particular book.
[time=733] It is affectionately known as the Rapture Passage.
[time=738] And in these short six verses, the Apostle Paul is going to answer some of the really important questions
[time=745] that were burning in the hearts of these new young believers in Thessalonika
[time=751] about what happens to a Christian when they die.
[time=756] After we as believers die, you know, do we go to heaven?
[time=759] Do we wait around?
[time=760] What's the sequence of events?
[time=762] They were confident, I think, of their eternal life.
[time=765] Chapter 1 solidifies that in our minds.
[time=768] But as to the details of what happens to the body, what happens to the spirit, what is the timing?
[time=773] What is the situation after one of our beloved die?
[time=777] And without those answers, it can be troubling because you care so deeply about the person who just died.
[time=784] And your mind is left to spin off a thousand different questions and drum up many, many more scenarios as to what might be the case.
[time=794] And so these poor Thessalonian young believers, while as you can see in chapter 1 verse 9,
[time=801] they were aware of the fact that Jesus was going to come again.
[time=804] It says there that they had turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God and to wait for His Son from heaven.
[time=812] So Paul had taught them something of the second coming of Christ.
[time=815] Paul had revealed to them that the end of the age would be marked by the coming of Christ.
[time=820] They knew that.
[time=822] In fact, as you saw in chapter 2 verse 19, he says to them, you know, you are our hope,
[time=829] you are our crown of exaltation, win at the presence of the Lord Jesus at His coming.
[time=837] So they though they were new in the Lord, maybe only a couple of months old yet, they knew that Jesus was coming again.
[time=844] They had some teaching from Paul about that.
[time=846] We don't know how much, but enough to know they knew something of it.
[time=849] But it obviously was not enough.
[time=851] If you look at verse 13, he says, "I don't want you to be uninformed." Their trouble and their struggle emotionally and mentally with the whole thing was for lack of knowledge.
[time=862] They had not been fully instructed in the things that we know enough as the rapture.
[time=868] And as a result, they were grieving.
[time=871] And they were grieving, as it says in verse 13, as the rest who have no hope.
[time=877] When one of their fellow believers would die, they would grieve at a level and at a pace
[time=885] and with an intensity of hopelessness.
[time=888] And he means by those who, the rest there as the unbeliever, the person who has never given their life to Christ.
[time=896] Now these troubles were so deep in their heart.
[time=898] The issues were so confounding that if you look up at verse 11, it was affecting their daily habits.
[time=906] Make it your ambition to lead a quiet life and attend to your own business and work with your hands just as we commend you so that you may behave properly towards outsiders.
[time=917] Their misunderstanding about the second coming of Christ and the rapture and the end of the age was so profound that they had stopped working.
[time=927] A different passage over in 2 Thessalonians says that they were leading undisciplined lives and they were not working and they had become busy bodies.
[time=937] They were living under the strong impression that Jesus could come again tomorrow, which was true then and it's true today.
[time=945] And that awareness that he might come and then their troubled fears over the believers that had already died before he had come left them, some of them, just all confused.
[time=956] And so they lost their energy for life. They lost their stamina.
[time=960] They didn't get up in the morning and live productive, godly, hard-working lives.
[time=964] They were falling into sin.
[time=967] Now there are all kinds of inappropriate reactions to that.
[time=971] I mean to death and to the wondering of what happens to people.
[time=974] Some just move into denial, some work harder.
[time=977] It's not that everybody who has questions about the deceased end up being busy bodies.
[time=981] That is one reaction.
[time=983] And so the instruction we have this morning begins to frame up for us what happens to the believers in our lives that we love and that we lose.
[time=992] What happens to them?
[time=994] Look at verse 13, let's just kind of read this opening verse.
[time=997] He says, "We do not want you to be uninformed, brethren, about those who are asleep that you may not grieve, as do the rest who have no hope." He begins to frame their thinking up by saying using the word "asleep." It's "coimmeo" in the Greek. It means "semitary." And it is the new word for death.
[time=1017] Heretofore it would have been a graveyard.
[time=1020] But the early Christians began to use this word "coimmeo" because it means "sleeping place." It's a derivative from which we get the word "dormatory." It's where you go to sleep for a little while to be in a repose until you take up the course of your life.
[time=1034] Remember what Jesus said about Lazarus there in John 11?
[time=1037] He said, "He's not dead." Everybody was saying, "He was dead." Well, physically and as you would think of it medically, he was.
[time=1043] But Jesus said, "No, he's not dead. He's sleeping. He's just asleep." In Acts chapter 7 at the martyr of Stephen when he died from a medical perspective, the text says that he fell asleep.
[time=1055] Now, the Bible doesn't talk about soul sleep. It's not soul sleep.
[time=1059] It refers particularly to your body has fallen asleep because your spirit, the Bible reveals, goes immediately to be with the Lord.
[time=1066] That's even what Stephen said upon his death. He said, "Lord, receive my spirit." But then what fell asleep was his body.
[time=1075] Because these Thessalonians didn't understand that they were grieving as those who have no hope.
[time=1082] Believers are supposed to grieve. We're supposed to cry.
[time=1086] John 11 again, Jesus wept at the death of Lazarus. Romans 12 says that we are supposed to weep with those who weep.
[time=1094] But there is a difference between the way that we sorrow and the way that we weep as believers and those verse 13 who are the rest with no hope.
[time=1105] Ephesians chapter 2 probably gives the best description of having no hope anywhere found in the Bible.
[time=1111] There are about five descriptive terms. People who die without Christ are these five things.
[time=1117] They are separated from Christ. They are excluded from the commonwealth of Israel.
[time=1122] That's an Old Testament phrase to describe all the blessings of the heavenly kingdom.
[time=1127] The third thing it says is they are strangers of the covenants of promise, meaning God has made no covenantal promises to them.
[time=1136] And then it says they have no hope and they are without God in the world.
[time=1141] I don't know if you've lost any loved ones lately, and especially those who did not know Christ.
[time=1146] I have many years ago, one of my heroes, Uncle Art, as we call him, Arthur Nukem Neff.
[time=1154] He was a fighter pilot, flew in World War II. He was a World War II ace.
[time=1158] And when you met your Uncle Art, it was an experience. He had all the charisma and he was a very, very handsome man
[time=1165] and he was full of dignity and full of honor and he was a military man, a hero of World War II.
[time=1171] And he was gracious and he was controlled and he was bright and he was kind.
[time=1178] But he was an atheist. He didn't believe in Jesus Christ as his personal Lord and Savior.
[time=1184] And I, along with the rest of my family, knew that and it was not a secret.
[time=1187] I mean, we would get into these discussions and over and over and over again. We'd try to open to him the truth of being saved and being forgiven for sin, et cetera, et cetera.
[time=1197] Uncle Art never bought. Uncle Art never felt that need and for whatever reason continue to resist the ministry of the Holy Spirit in his life.
[time=1204] And so he died. He died without Christ. He died separated from Christ according to Ephesians 2.
[time=1210] He died excluded from the commonwealth of Israel. He died a stranger to the covenant of God.
[time=1216] He died without hope. It's a horrible thing. I think about him sometimes.
[time=1222] The Bible says that he is now constantly in conscious torment.
[time=1227] As a conscious and as aware of life as you and I are, he is aware of the torment that is a part of hell.
[time=1233] And I know that eternity doesn't have time, but if you think of it this way, you know, that was maybe ten years ago.
[time=1241] He hasn't even made it to the millennium yet in his suffering.
[time=1246] The Bible reveals a period of the millennium, a thousand years, and then finally at the end of that, the beginning of eternity.
[time=1252] My grandfather is the same way. Russell B. Seymour, babe.
[time=1258] And my power is cutting out.
[time=1261] And I was named after him and we loved him. He was a federal judge. He was a man of honor.
[time=1268] And a reputation of being an honest man full of integrity.
[time=1271] Those who entered his court knew they would be tried and a fair and right and just system of law.
[time=1278] And we shared with him over and over and over and over again the truth about Christ.
[time=1283] And he was an agnostic. He just didn't know.
[time=1287] And his disbelief kept him from accepting Christ as his personal Lord and Savior.
[time=1292] He died. He died separate from Christ. He died excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, meaning no eternal blessings. He died without the promises of God in his life.
[time=1302] He died without hope and he lived without God in his worldly life.
[time=1307] I can't think of a more hopeless condition.
[time=1310] Paul says in chapter 4 verse 13, we do not want you to be an informed brother and about those who are asleep, your Christian brothers and sisters, that you may not grieve as the rest who have no hope.
[time=1323] Paul reveals here a great truth about the rapture.
[time=1327] And our hope is in the rapture that Jesus Christ is going to come again.
[time=1332] And he is going to take out of the grave those who have already died believing in Christ
[time=1338] and he will snatch as it were their bodies from the grave.
[time=1341] And if we are alive when he comes again he will snatch us as well and he will take us into the air
[time=1347] and transport us to heaven for all of eternity. That's called the rapture.
[time=1351] Look at it in verse 17, it says this, "Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up."
[time=1357] That's the rapture word, "shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air
[time=1363] and thus we shall always be with the Lord." That is our hope. And that is what Paul needs to instruct and inform these young believers in
[time=1375] so that they don't grieve as if they had no hope.
[time=1378] So this morning let me give you three things about the rapture, three truths about the rapture that Paul reveals in order to give his struggling young fledgling church hope
[time=1388] in the face of death.
[time=1390] Number one, he reveals the pillars of the rapture, the pillars or the foundation of the rapture.
[time=1397] How can we support such a hope that Jesus will come and call out from the grave those who have already
[time=1403] died and those who are still alive to go up into the air and be with him for all eternity?
[time=1408] And the answer to that is what I call the pillars of the rapture.
[time=1411] Look at verse 14, he says this, "For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again,
[time=1417] even so, God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus.
[time=1423] For thus we say to you, by the word of the Lord." Now in those two and a half, one and a half verses, there are three truths which establish the foundation for the rapture.
[time=1433] The first is found in verse 14, it's called the death of Christ.
[time=1437] The only hope that you and I have, that we will be able to be taken up from this earth
[time=1443] whether we are still alive when he comes or already dead and he calls us from our grave.
[time=1448] The only hope that you and I have to ever be gathered into the presence of God is first
[time=1454] and foremost built on the fact that Jesus died for us.
[time=1458] It is the death of Christ that establishes our hope for the resurrection, for our own resurrection, for the rapture itself.
[time=1466] You see, God is holy and God is righteous and God is perfect.
[time=1472] His eyes are too perfect to even look upon sin.
[time=1476] And to ever even consider being in His presence, the sin that is in our hearts and our lives
[time=1482] and our minds must first be dealt with.
[time=1485] And the only way that gets dealt with is through the death of Jesus Christ.
[time=1489] The Bible says that He bore our sins in His body.
[time=1493] The Bible says that Christ became sin for us.
[time=1498] It is clear the wages of sin is death and that death means separation from God for all of eternity.
[time=1505] And as Christ died for our sins, and look at verse 14 again, if we believe in that,
[time=1511] if we have accepted Christ as our Savior and therefore the benefit of His death, then the consequences of our sin, the defilement of our sin, the stuff of our sin that would preclude us from ever being in the presence of God is forever removed.
[time=1527] We are cleansed and washed through the death of Jesus Christ.
[time=1532] And so Christ made sleep, as it were, the name for death in the dialect of the church.
[time=1538] Where without Christ, the only word for our demise would be death, which means separation both from our body and eternally from God.
[time=1546] That is the only word for those who have no hope.
[time=1549] For those who have never accepted Christ, the only possible word is death.
[time=1553] Separation from God for all of eternity.
[time=1556] But because of the death of Christ and are giving our lives to Christ, the word is changed from death to sleep.
[time=1563] As 1 Corinthians 15 tells us, oh, death, where is your victory?
[time=1568] Oh, death, where is your sting?
[time=1571] The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.
[time=1574] But thanks be to God who gives the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1580] You see, death loses its victory. Death loses its sting. Why?
[time=1585] Because it is in the death of Christ that our sins have been paid for, and so we have victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1592] That's the first pillar of the rapture.
[time=1594] That's the first substantive foundational truth that leads us to put our hope in the fact that one day Jesus will rapture us off this planet.
[time=1604] The second pillar is also found in verse 14, and it's equally as marvelous because it centers in Christ.
[time=1609] Verse 14 says, "If we believe that Jesus died and what came next?" And he rose again.
[time=1615] You see, Jesus Christ didn't just die for our sins.
[time=1618] He died for them, but he also rose again.
[time=1621] And he told us in advance that his resurrection would be the final statement of God
[time=1627] as to the acceptance of his own offering for our sin.
[time=1631] If Jesus just dies for our sin but doesn't rise again, we have no confidence that what he did was sufficient to satisfy the wrath of God.
[time=1638] We have no confidence that he was, in fact, the Son of God, that he was the holy Lamb of God.
[time=1643] It is when he comes out of that grave in his own resurrection that we have undeniable proof and evidence that what he did in his death was sufficient to satisfy the wrath of God, that he was who he said he was, that he rose from the dead even as he said he would.
[time=1657] You see, he told us that he was God.
[time=1660] He told us that in his death he would be the sacrifice for our sin.
[time=1664] But it isn't until he rises from the dead that we have the proof that he was who he said he was that his sacrifice was acceptable and that he had the power over death.
[time=1674] Why would you and I trust in a resurrection when the one who provides the resurrection couldn't resurrect himself?
[time=1682] Why would you and I put our hope in a future resurrection from the dead, our own death?
[time=1687] Why would that ever be our hope if the one we were believing in couldn't conquer death himself?
[time=1693] You see, there is the point. John 1419, he says, "Because I live, you shall live.
[time=1700] I beat death, and because I beat death, you can beat death." 1 Corinthians 6, 14 says, "Now God has not only raised the Lord, but will also raise us up through His power."
[time=1713] The same power that God used to raise Jesus Christ from the dead, the bear of all sin, of all humanity, of all time
[time=1719] is the same power that God will use to raise us from the dead.
[time=1723] 2 Corinthians 4, 14, knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus.
[time=1731] It's an amazing truth. It is the hope of the believer.
[time=1736] Not only that Christ died to pay the penalty for my sin to make me acceptable, to be in the presence of God,
[time=1742] but that the resurrection of Jesus Christ proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that Christ was acceptable in His sacrifice,
[time=1749] that Christ is victorious over death, that God's power is sufficient to resurrect people from the dead,
[time=1755] and therefore I have hope.
[time=1757] Paul, over here in Philippians 3, walking away from his life of works and self-effort and self-righteousness,
[time=1767] casts himself hopelessly into the arms of Christ for salvation.
[time=1771] Remember this passage, Philippians 3?
[time=1773] He says, "I count all things to be lost in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord." He says, "I am done trying to earn the pleasure of God, trying to deserve heaven on my own effort.
[time=1785] It's impossible for me." I want to be found. He goes on, "In the righteousness not of my own," which is ridiculous.
[time=1793] There is no self-made righteousness.
[time=1795] I want to have the righteousness which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith.
[time=1802] Having said that, then he says this, "That I may know Him," meaning Jesus,
[time=1808] "and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings being conformed to His death
[time=1815] in order that I may attain to the resurrection from the dead." What is it that brings people out of the grave?
[time=1821] What is it that resurrects people to the power of life eternal with God?
[time=1826] It is the righteousness of God that they receive through faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=1832] And it is the very resurrection power of Christ that raises them from the dead.
[time=1837] Nothing short of that.
[time=1839] If you have your hope for eternal life of any kind, independently of the death and the resurrection of Christ,
[time=1847] my friend, you are deceived, disillusioned. All you have is death.
[time=1853] All you have is death, for you can neither satisfy the wrath of God for your own sin, nor have you the power to raise yourself from the dead.
[time=1862] Christ conquered sin and His death, and He conquered death and His rising.
[time=1867] If that isn't enough, there's a third pillar, and you see it at the beginning of verse 15.
[time=1871] For this we say to you what?
[time=1873] By the word of the Lord.
[time=1877] That's a promise, friends.
[time=1879] Paul is saying here, you know, I'm not writing this to you out of some theological textbook somewhere.
[time=1883] These aren't my musings.
[time=1884] This isn't philosophical, feel good time.
[time=1886] What I am saying to you, I say to you based upon the word of God, the word of the Lord, the promise of God Himself,
[time=1894] that you realize how powerful that is?
[time=1897] For those of you who have been around the church a little while and studied the book of Genesis, you know that God created everything that you see out of nothing.
[time=1907] God didn't go to some eternal warehouse somewhere and find the stuff out of which to make atoms and molecules and eventually bring in big, huge trucks and offload, you know, Mount Whitney and then put big things to carry in the water.
[time=1919] You know how He did it?
[time=1920] He spoke it into existence.
[time=1922] He said, let there be light, and all that is implied in all of the understanding of what it means to have light
[time=1929] was instantly created out of nothing.
[time=1931] How?
[time=1932] By the power of His word.
[time=1934] When He said, let there be the heavens and the earth and then you think about the massive structure of our earth.
[time=1942] He didn't strain a muscle.
[time=1944] He didn't lift the thing.
[time=1946] He just with the power of His own word, ex-Nahilio, out of nothing.
[time=1951] He spoke it into existence.
[time=1953] When God says that I will raise you from the dead, He has the power to do it just simply by His word.
[time=1962] It is the powerful, undeniable, irresistible, unstoppable power of the word of God for Him to speak, it is done.
[time=1973] It's an amazing thing.
[time=1974] It's so different than for us.
[time=1975] You and I get up in the morning on Saturday and we say, I am going to.
[time=1978] We give our word now.
[time=1979] I am going to clean the garage and hang these shelves.
[time=1983] In about three hours into what we find that we have overspoken our ability, right?
[time=1988] Don't you always do that?
[time=1990] You say, I am going to go to the office and I am going to get this, this, this and this and this done.
[time=1994] And you go to the office and you work your tail off and you get about half of it done.
[time=1997] There are so many times where you and I say what we are going to do and it is a world of difference between what happens and that is never the case with God.
[time=2006] He spoke the entire world and universe and all that is into existence by the power of His word out of nothing.
[time=2018] The believers are going to come out of the grave.
[time=2020] You bet they are.
[time=2021] How come?
[time=2022] Well, He died.
[time=2024] And in His death He removed the obstacle of sin for people otherwise sinful and cast from the presence of God for all eternity not only to be in His presence but to fellowship with Him for all of eternity.
[time=2035] In second to that He rose again and in His rising He proved He said He is, He was who He said He was.
[time=2041] He proved that His sacrifice as the spotless Lamb of God was sufficient for the wrath of God and He proved that He had conquered death.
[time=2047] That He Himself could rise again and so had the power to rise us again.
[time=2051] And then thirdly He said He'd do it.
[time=2053] And if that isn't enough I don't know what it is.
[time=2056] So the pillars of the rapture, the payment of His death, the power of His resurrection and the promise of His word.
[time=2062] The second great truth that He reveals about the rapture is what I call the experience of the rapture.
[time=2068] And now I'm going to try to give you somewhat of the sequence of this event called the rapture.
[time=2074] What is the order of things?
[time=2076] How does it actually unfold?
[time=2078] And for that we'll begin in verse 16.
[time=2081] Look at it, it's amazing.
[time=2083] I don't know if you want to do this from having already been dead because that means your spirit is with the Lord and you come back with Him with your spirit.
[time=2092] I mean you get to anticipate it.
[time=2094] I don't know if that's better or if it's better to just be hustling around and all of a sudden to have this happen to you.
[time=2099] But here it is, verse 16, "For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel with the trumpet of God."
[time=2110] And here's some sequencing now.
[time=2112] "And the dead in Christ shall rise first, then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and thus we shall always be with Him."
[time=2126] Now what's this about? Let's go back to the beginning of verse 16.
[time=2129] It begins by saying the Lord is the catalyst.
[time=2132] The Lord is the event.
[time=2134] The Lord's coming is the happening event itself.
[time=2138] And where does He come from?
[time=2139] It says He'll descend from heaven.
[time=2140] Why?
[time=2141] Because that's where He is right now.
[time=2143] Hebrews 1-3 says that when He made purification of sins through His death and resurrection, He sat down at the right hand of the majesty of God.
[time=2153] You see, it's where Jesus is. Jesus is physically still in that same physical body that everybody saw Him in after the resurrection.
[time=2160] Touched it, felt it, handled it.
[time=2162] That's His glorified body.
[time=2163] That glorified body is in heaven at the right hand of God.
[time=2167] By the way, He makes intercession for us there.
[time=2170] And so for this event to happen, the Lord has to come and you say, "Where does He come from?" Well, He comes out of heaven.
[time=2176] He leaves the presence of God in His physical form.
[time=2179] He leaves that spot at the right hand of God and He descends from heaven.
[time=2184] What happens next?
[time=2185] Well, there's a shout.
[time=2187] There's a shout.
[time=2188] And I love this.
[time=2189] The word in the Greek here is a military term and it means a military command.
[time=2194] Jesus shouts a military command.
[time=2199] It is as if the troops are standing around at ease and then comes the command to fall in.
[time=2204] Who is He speaking to?
[time=2206] He's speaking to the dead bodies of the believers who are at repose.
[time=2212] A believer dies.
[time=2214] Their body goes to be instantly with heaven.
[time=2216] I mean, with God, up in heaven.
[time=2217] To be absent with the body is the presence of the Lord.
[time=2219] What happens to their body?
[time=2220] Their body takes a break.
[time=2221] Their body lays down.
[time=2222] Their body falls out.
[time=2224] It falls apart.
[time=2225] Their body is just everywhere.
[time=2227] All these bodies everywhere.
[time=2228] Luther translated this phrase, "Stand up." The shout comes, "Stand up." You see, the Lord shouts to those bodies to stand up or to fall in or to line up like a military commander.
[time=2240] And those bodies go from being at ease in repose, in death and sleep, to falling into rank and
[time=2247] file at the command of the Lord.
[time=2249] They're just up to from wherever they are.
[time=2254] And the great thing, of course, is that as they do that, they get glorified.
[time=2257] Because your mind's already imagining not a scary psycho movie where dilapidated bones come
[time=2263] out of them.
[time=2264] No, no, no.
[time=2265] These are fully glorified, renewed bodies that burst out of wherever they were.
[time=2270] So he shouts up to and then with it, look at verse 16, there is accompanying at a voice
[time=2276] of the archangel.
[time=2277] Now we don't know who the archangel is.
[time=2279] Michael, Jude 9, is an archangel.
[time=2281] It might be Michael, it might not be.
[time=2283] But I'll tell us.
[time=2284] But one of those super stud angels is right there.
[time=2287] And as Jesus shouts this command, there is echoing behind it the voice of the archangel.
[time=2295] Adding volume, not that the Lord needed that, but for some reason, there is this additional echoing of the archangel.
[time=2302] And then with, behind that, again, verse 16, is the trumpet of God.
[time=2307] The trumpet of God.
[time=2310] See a lot of trumpet, sometimes we go up to Notre Dame to watch them, hopefully lose to
[time=2317] my alma mater, USC, which in the last three years has been good, the 13 years prior to
[time=2323] that, haven't been all that good.
[time=2324] And we'll go up there.
[time=2325] We have some friends in the church here who have tickets and they'll help us get these tickets and go up there and take my family in one of the best, most exciting parts.
[time=2332] You get there a couple hours earlier, of course, and you walk through the campus of Notre Dame and all these cool buildings and the architecture and the academia just dripping off everywhere and you move with this massive crowd away from the stadium and you wind your
[time=2347] way through their campus because that's where the fighting Irish marching band assembles.
[time=2354] And it seems like there's thousands of them, you know, and they're dressed in their uniforms and they all have their instruments and their forms, this processional line that they always the same route, they always take it to the stadium and so there's thousands of people and what you want to do is you want to get up in front, you know, so you can really hear it.
[time=2371] And when they crank that thing up and they start making that monstrous noise with all that energy and all that life, the last time we went I had Bobby on my shoulder so he could see and, you know, his little body just started to tremble as this thing got closer and closer and closer and finally, you know, the drums go through and then the brass comes through and it's just this overpowering sense of adrenaline and rush at that noise.
[time=2394] I don't know what kind of a marching band the Lord has when he comes back but I'll guarantee you it'll put anything you and I have ever heard to shame.
[time=2403] There is going to be a noise my friends and it is going to be full for those of us who know Christ, whether we are already dead or whether we are still alive, it is going to be full of adrenaline and full of excitement and full of joy and there's going to be a sense of man.
[time=2415] He's finally over and here he is, look, he's here.
[time=2420] The trumpet of God is often used in the Bible, he used a trumpet in Exodus 19, I'll just tell you two places because they seem so meaningful to this text.
[time=2427] In Exodus 19 there was a trumpet and God used it to call his people out of the camp to meet with him and with the trumpet of assembly.
[time=2435] It was the trumpet that said, "Come, you be with me.
[time=2438] Leave the camp behind, let you and I meet for a little while." It was the second place in Zephaniah 116, it's the trumpet that was used to signal the coming of the Lord to rescue his people from the wickedness of men.
[time=2452] You bring those two pictures together and you've got the rapture trumpet.
[time=2456] God is here saying, "I now want fellowship with you for all of eternity and I don't want it with those of you who have already passed away with just your spirits.
[time=2464] I want you in your glorified bodies and those of you still remaining on this earth, you believers, you the faithful church, I want you to.
[time=2470] You're going to pull this whole thing together.
[time=2472] It is a call of fellowship, it is a call to assembly, it is a call to being together
[time=2478] for the rest of eternity." And it is a rescue operation and we'll see about that here a little bit.
[time=2486] The word rapture means to come with violence, it can be translated in rape, it is the way one animal attacks another and snatches it out of its safety of its mother's den.
[time=2497] The word rapture is a powerful, forceful word to take something by force.
[time=2504] And here it is this trumpet that declares the signal of the coming of the Lord to take by force those who will rescue from this sinful world.
[time=2514] So how does it happen?
[time=2515] What does it look like?
[time=2517] What is the sequencing of the rapture?
[time=2519] First of all, it's about the Lord.
[time=2520] He is the event.
[time=2522] He comes down from heaven where he has been, interceding for us.
[time=2525] He comes with a great shout, a military command to call all of his own to order.
[time=2532] And there is behind that the echoing of the voice of a great archangel that is accompanied yet further by the trumpet of God.
[time=2539] And what happens?
[time=2541] Well, that undeniable power, the dead in Christ rise first.
[time=2547] I don't understand why.
[time=2549] Some people have said, "Well, that's because they've got six feet further to go.
[time=2552] They've got to get a head start." I don't know.
[time=2555] Trumpet of God blows looking for Universe 16 and the dead in Christ shall rise first.
[time=2560] Now that's the way God wants it to happen.
[time=2563] This is all the bodies of all the dead believers, whether they are locked up in tombs or graves
[time=2570] or whether they were lost at sea, whether they are completely and totally decomposed, whether they got blown up at war or burned up in a fire or shot up or destroyed by cancer
[time=2581] wherever and however dismembered and ruined these bodies may have been with time.
[time=2586] When the Lord shouts, they all reassemble from wherever they have been, all the particles
[time=2593] of all their bodies obey the military command, the shout of the Lord, who created them in the first place and they fall in.
[time=2602] And in this violent, sudden, powerful, forceful moment we call the rapture, their bodies are
[time=2608] resurrected, resurrected into perfection, just like the Lord's body after His resurrection.
[time=2615] Still recognizable, we believe, but perfect, no longer susceptible to death or pain or sorrow
[time=2622] or any kind of calamity.
[time=2624] They are these bodies now ready for eternity.
[time=2628] So what rises out of the grave is a glorified body.
[time=2631] Now watch, the person's spirit, they had already died, the glorified body to meet an already
[time=2637] glorified spirit, to become that eternal person in the image of Christ for all eternity.
[time=2644] That happens first.
[time=2646] Boom, 1 Corinthians talks about a happening in the twinkling of an eye.
[time=2653] Verse 17, then, sequentially now, after that, we who are alive and remain shall be caught
[time=2662] up, rapture, snatch.
[time=2665] We will be snatched together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord of the year.
[time=2672] That's an amazing sight.
[time=2674] I mean, the people who I love, I haven't lost any really close family members yet who are
[time=2682] born again, for whatever reason.
[time=2686] So I kind of get my thrill out of this passage when I think about Steve Longbrink.
[time=2691] And I see this great moment, and up out of the grave comes Renee in her glorified body
[time=2698] to meet her glorified spirit, and now they're kind of with the Lord right there, you can see her now, standing next to the Lord who you can see, and then boom, Steve goes along with Stephanie and Josh and Nancy, and all that works because everybody's glorified.
[time=2714] I think about Audrey Hindall, and first goes Greg, her 16-year-old son at the time of his death.
[time=2721] And then goes Jim, her husband, two years later, died of a heart attack.
[time=2726] And that body, all messed up and boom, comes back.
[time=2730] Not just back comes glorified, meets their already perfect heart, spirit, soul and mind.
[time=2736] They reunite and then boom, they put their arms around Audrey and the whole thing's over.
[time=2741] They run off to heaven forever and ever and ever.
[time=2743] It's an unbelievable picture.
[time=2747] The believers who are alive in verse 17, again I need to repeat, are raptured.
[time=2751] They are snatched, they are violently and suddenly and powerfully and forcefully taken off this earth by the power of the Word of God.
[time=2760] That apparently happens for two reasons.
[time=2762] One, it seems plausible there's a great spiritual battle going on at this moment.
[time=2767] Ephesians tells us that Satan is the prince of the power of the air.
[time=2771] God has given him a limited domain, and that domain is to be sovereign of the earth and of the air and this domain.
[time=2778] He can travel to heaven as we find in Job and he asks questions of God but his domain, he has been cast out, his place, his kingdom is here.
[time=2787] And as Christ comes to take those who are his own, apparently the meaning bound up in rapture with its violent connotations seems to indicate there is a battle of some sort
[time=2799] that Satan tries to wage which he could never win.
[time=2802] It just feels wonderful to know that the Lord will rescue us, he will come in, and he will
[time=2809] do an insertion operation, he will extract us from this place by his power, by his strength
[time=2815] and the military genre sweeps over it and you can see these powerful angels responding
[time=2821] to the authority of the Word of God delivering us forever from the domain of Satan.
[time=2826] It's an awesome truth.
[time=2833] It also happens as we have said in an instant, it is instant glorification, when we see him we shall be like him for we shall see him just as he is, 1 John chapter 3.
[time=2845] So it is a powerful moment, it is powerful because it utterly, totally transforms us, we who remain.
[time=2850] At the same second it transforms our inner man to absolute perfection, the glorified person internally, it also has power to glorify our physical body and it has enough power to
[time=2860] snatch us off this earth against the efforts and the will of the prince of the power of
[time=2868] the year.
[time=2869] And so there we are, united with the Lord for all of eternity, fitted with perfect bodies,
[time=2875] perfect hearts, perfect minds, perfect souls, it's the end of all sin and all of its effects
[time=2881] in our life, and we are there reunited with all the believing loved ones who have died before us only to spend eternity in the presence of God.
[time=2894] And the result, what is the result, number three, what is the result of all this?
[time=2900] What is this information designed to do in our hearts and our lives?
[time=2905] Look at verse 18, what does he say?
[time=2908] He says, "Therefore comfort one another with these words." That's a great thought.
[time=2914] Do you realize that there are three places in the New Testament where the rapture is discussed?
[time=2920] One in John, I think 1 Corinthians and one here, and in every situation the information
[time=2926] is always given in response to the distress of believers wondering about what happens next.
[time=2932] In other words, this is not a theological dissertation.
[time=2935] This is not something that the Lord is trying to do to hand out some theological knowledge so we can get our eschatological charts right.
[time=2945] He never gives this information, now he gives other information, Matthew 25, the whole book of Revelation, and that is more didactic in nature.
[time=2953] You can build some theological eschatological charts, but the rapture isn't mentioned in
[time=2960] that passage over in Matthew 25, and the rapture is not specifically mentioned in the book of Revelation.
[time=2966] It is implied, it is assumed.
[time=2969] The only three places you and I get to know about this glorious moment is in direct response
[time=2975] to the concerns of believers who ask the Lord what's going to happen next.
[time=2980] You see this is a pastoral passage, and this by the way is a pastoral event.
[time=2984] It is the loving, gracious, compassionate heart of God to reveal to us some of the
[time=2990] sequencing and the power and the wonder and the glory of the rapture, independently of other eschatological information in response to the distress of believers who wonder what
[time=3001] happens to my beloved wife, my beloved son, my beloved husband after they die.
[time=3007] So the point of this whole passage is verse 18, "Therefore comfort, be comforted." It is a pastor's heart crying out to comfort those who remain with this information.
[time=3019] Your beloved one, this is what has happened to them, and by the way, this is what will happen to you.
[time=3026] This is how the whole thing winds down.
[time=3030] Svetlana, if I'm saying that right, Svetlana Stalin was quoted in Newsweek giving a description
[time=3039] of her father's death, quote, "My father died a difficult and terrible death.
[time=3048] God grants an easy death only to the just." At what seemed the very last moment, he suddenly opened his eyes and cast a glance over everyone
[time=3058] in the room.
[time=3060] It was a terrible glance, insane, or perhaps angry and full of fear of death.
[time=3066] Then he lifted his left hand as though he were pointing to something above and bringing down a curse on all of us.
[time=3076] The gesture was full of menace.
[time=3079] The next moment, the spirit wrenched itself free of the flesh.
[time=3087] There is no comfort in the death of the wicked.
[time=3092] There is no peace, there is no repose, there is no serenity, there is no hope in the death of those who reject Christ.
[time=3101] Our last words of Charles the Knight, a Christ rejecting ruthless murderer who ordered the
[time=3107] massacre on St. Bartholomew's day were these lying there, dying now, in his last moment.
[time=3114] He cries out, "What blood?
[time=3117] What murderers?
[time=3119] I know not where I am.
[time=3122] How will I end?
[time=3126] What shall I do?
[time=3129] I am lost forever.
[time=3132] I know it." End quote.
[time=3137] You want to die like that?
[time=3140] You want to die like that, sensing the power and the fury and the wrath of a God who has kept perfect account of all your sin past, present, who knows the sin you committed, he knows the sin you thought, he knows your sins of omission as well as commission, he knows it all and he comes to do what is right and just and holy, and that is his wrath
[time=3161] and that is his vengeance.
[time=3164] I want to invite you to close your eyes for just a second and visualize this next scene.
[time=3172] It's a touching and powerful scene of a father, his three sons and his father, and I believe
[time=3178] it gives you an occasion to glorify God.
[time=3181] Just try to see it.
[time=3184] There was late afternoon when the boat's engine sputtered, stalled and refused to restart.
[time=3191] Gallons of water surged into the craft as it pitched on sickening six foot swells.
[time=3198] The five Yeagers had done all they knew to do, but it wasn't enough.
[time=3203] An exciting fishing trip was now a thing of horror.
[time=3208] They were going under.
[time=3211] Grim faced George Yeager, his three sons and his elderly father, methodically tightened
[time=3220] the buckles on their life jackets, tied themselves together with a rope and slipped silently
[time=3228] into a black and boiling Atlantic.
[time=3235] First glance at his watch as the boat finally disappeared, 6.30 p.m.
[time=3242] Very little was said, it drew dark.
[time=3246] First one boy and then another swallowed too much salt water, gagged and strangled on the
[time=3252] brine as they fought to keep their heads above water.
[time=3257] The helpless father heard his sons one by one, then his dad, choked and drowned.
[time=3266] But George couldn't surrender.
[time=3269] After eight nightmarish hours, he staggered onto the shore, still pulling the rope that bound him to the bodies of the other four.
[time=3279] "I realized they were all dead, my three boys and my father.
[time=3289] But I guess I didn't want to accept it, so I kept swimming all night long.
[time=3295] My youngest boy, Clifford, was the first to go.
[time=3300] I had always taught our children not to fear death because it was being with Jesus Christ.
[time=3309] Before Clifford died, his dad heard him say, "I'd rather be with Jesus than go on fighting."
[time=3318] In that vivid Atlantic memory, George Yeager had a chance to witness the impact of his fifteen years as a father.
[time=3326] The boys died quietly with courage and dignity.
[time=3336] We invite you to open your eyes now for a minute.
[time=3341] What about my three sons set a father?
[time=3343] What about my own father?
[time=3345] Well, you see, Jesus is coming again.
[time=3350] He had taught his boys that, he had taught his boys to put their faith in Christ, and so they had.
[time=3356] And there will be a day when out of that very situation, and to that very crisis, Jesus
[time=3363] will come, and he will shout.
[time=3368] He will shout with the power and the authority of the greatest military commander who has ever lived, the one who created all that is.
[time=3376] And the power of that shout is irresistible, it's unavoidable, it's unstoppable, and it will call to order the bodies of those three and that grandfather.
[time=3386] An echoing behind it will be the voice of a great and mighty archangel, and that will be undergirded with the trumpet of God, and then the dead in Christ shall rise first.
[time=3397] And then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds.
[time=3402] To meet the Lord in the air, and thus we shall always be with the Lord.
[time=3409] Here's your future, that's how it's going to unfold, if you know Christ as your personal
[time=3421] Lord and Savior.
[time=3424] Let me invite you to stand for a closing word of prayer.
[time=3433] Our gracious God and Heavenly Father, we are beginning to celebrate your birth, the birth of your son, the incarnation, God becoming flesh, Emmanuel with us, and this church is
[time=3444] beginning again the Herculean effort, preparing a message for thousands who if they were to
[time=3453] die today would die without hope.
[time=3456] And what we see in this sanctuary now, this massive tree and this yet completed set, and
[time=3465] what we don't see, a choir that has been working and working and working and working
[time=3471] and preparing and a lobby that will soon be transformed.
[time=3476] And Father, faithful people in our church who have picked their tickets up, and the reports I hear are glorious and wondrous, they are the offering of life in the form of
[time=3486] a living Christmas tree ticket that have been bound in prayer, and the hopes of eternity hang on this event for many people this year.
[time=3496] Father, thank you for a passage such as this that lets us know the loved ones we have lost are with you, that you have everything under control, that we will be together again.
[time=3504] A great reunion is planned.
[time=3507] And in the interim, help us, God, to add to the number.
[time=3511] Help us to relieve the hearts of those who have no hope.
[time=3515] Help us, God, to be instruments of love and light and encouragement and strength to the
[time=3522] people who have yet to hear and comprehend and commit to Christ.
[time=3525] It's one of the greatest things we'll ever do in all of our lives.
[time=3529] Give us the power and strength to do it.
[time=3531] Bless our efforts, O God.
[time=3532] We pray these things in Christ's name.
[time=3535] And all God's people said, "Amen, God bless you." If you'd like a cassette copy of today's message, just ask for the tape number on your screen.
