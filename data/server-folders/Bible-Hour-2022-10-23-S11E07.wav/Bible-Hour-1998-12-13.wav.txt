[time=520] [MUSIC - 660 seconds]
[time=1184] I invite you this morning to open your Bible to First Thessalonians Chapter 5 and we get to continue this morning our verse by verse passage by passage chapter by chapter study of this wonderful book.
[time=1200] First Thessalonians Chapter 5. Francis Shafer, the brilliant historian and scholar, wrote a book about the rise and decline of western thought and culture.
[time=1214] The title of his book captured the point of his book. It was this.
[time=1218] How should we then live?
[time=1222] Looking back from a bird's eye view upon the rise and decline of western culture and thought, how should we then live?
[time=1230] What can we learn as we look backwards?
[time=1234] What things and principles and paradigms and understandings can we glean from a look backwards over history
[time=1242] that would affect the way we choose to live today?
[time=1246] This morning the passage that we will study asks essentially the same question, how should we then live?
[time=1254] But it does not ask that question having surveyed history.
[time=1258] It asks the question, how should we then live in light of how history will end? It is a forward look.
[time=1266] Paul is going to tell us about how the world is going to end. He's going to tell us about a thing called the day of the Lord.
[time=1275] That is the final cataclysmic end of all that is.
[time=1279] In verses 1 through 3 he lays that out and then in verses 4 through 11 he asks and really answers the question, how should we then live?
[time=1291] There are really three perspectives on the way that history unfolds.
[time=1295] There is first the cynical view or rather the cyclical view.
[time=1299] It is this, that history is nothing but an endless cycle of repetition.
[time=1305] History just continues to cycle back on itself over and over again.
[time=1310] We are caught in this process of reincarnation in which we reappear and then reappear and then reappear
[time=1319] over and over and over and over again.
[time=1323] As such history has no meaning.
[time=1327] It can gain no meaning because it can only repeat what has been.
[time=1332] And if there has been no meaning then it can gain no meaning by simply repeating what has been.
[time=1339] A person may have individual goals but history itself can have no goal.
[time=1345] It is simply the repeating of what has been.
[time=1348] That in fact was the thinking of the day in which the Thessalonians lived.
[time=1352] We know that thought today as Hinduism and it has come west in the form of the New Age movement.
[time=1358] It is this, people come back over and over again to experience the same things over and over again from a different perspective.
[time=1367] It was I think the plot for that popular movie Groundhog Day where the guy got caught living the same day over and over and over and over and over again.
[time=1377] That is the cyclical view of history.
[time=1379] And that movie of course gave a humorous parody of it.
[time=1383] A second perspective on history is what we call the atheistic existential view of history and it says this, history is a line.
[time=1392] There is no repetition but it says that history started by accident and no one knows how it is going to end.
[time=1401] There is no God, we are a result of time plus chance and as such no one knows what will eventually happen to our world.
[time=1411] There is no God, there is no rhyme or reason, there is no purpose, there is no creator, no progenitor and no concluded.
[time=1418] We live an accidental existence and the only way to live it is to try to cram it full of as much stuff as you think may satisfy your heart as you can.
[time=1430] And then of course there is a third view and that is what we call the sovereign creator God view of history.
[time=1437] It says this, that a sovereign God is working out his plan in history.
[time=1444] It is the Christian view of life and it has several components.
[time=1448] First of all that history is the working of God's purposes as explained in the scriptures.
[time=1455] God is sovereign over all of history. He rules it all by providence.
[time=1461] That supernatural pulling together of all things whereby God, the first cause, works his perfect will through the genuinely free will of man, the second cause.
[time=1473] It also states that Christ is the main person of history.
[time=1480] In fact, all of history looks to Christ and that his coming is the most dramatic event in all of human history.
[time=1489] It further states that God is moving all of history to a divinely planned goal.
[time=1497] Every person has an ultimate appointment with God at which time will be determined his eternal destiny.
[time=1504] In other words, God started history, God controls history and God is bringing history to its conclusion.
[time=1512] Now this morning we come to a text that Paul explains how God will bring it all to a conclusion.
[time=1519] It is called the day of the Lord.
[time=1522] Let me read to you verses 1 through 3 of 1 Thessalonians chapter 5.
[time=1526] It says this, "Now as to the times and the epics, brethren, you have no need of anything to be written to you,
[time=1534] for you yourselves know full well that the day of the Lord will come just like a thief in the night.
[time=1541] And while they are saying peace and safety, then destruction will come upon them and suddenly like birth pangs upon a woman with child, and they shall not escape."
[time=1553] Having told his beloved fledgling new church there in Thessalonica about the rapture, which was last week,
[time=1560] and that of course tells how the Christians experience inns on earth.
[time=1564] The believer either dies and waits to be resurrected at the rapture, or the believer happens to live at the second coming, or the rapture of Christ, and he gets snatched away.
[time=1574] Paul having explained this dimension of how things wrap up for the believer.
[time=1580] He now tells them about the day of the Lord.
[time=1583] And he is going to explain to them how the world ends, not for the believer, but for the unbeliever.
[time=1591] How this whole thing shuts down, how the end of history finally comes to its conclusion.
[time=1597] And so this morning I'd like you to look at three aspects about the day of the Lord.
[time=1602] First, its description. Second, its coming, and third, its portrayal.
[time=1608] Its description, its coming, and its portrayal. First, its description. Look at chapter 5, verse 2.
[time=1614] For you yourselves know full well that the day of the Lord will come just like a thief in the night.
[time=1622] And what I have to do at this point is to assume that Paul has already instructed them about the day of the Lord.
[time=1629] Why do I assume that? Well, because he's answering a question that assumes their knowledge of it.
[time=1634] They apparently had said that Timothy visited them after Paul had left.
[time=1638] Hey, you know, Paul told us about the great wrath at the end of the world.
[time=1643] But he didn't tell us how to know when it was coming.
[time=1645] He didn't give us enough information so that we could satisfy our curiosity about how this, you know, what would trigger all this stuff.
[time=1652] How would we know that the day of the Lord was coming?
[time=1655] And so he writes this text and the very writing of it assumes there's, they have some knowledge of it.
[time=1660] If you go back to 1 Thessalonians chapter 1, verse 10 you'll see that he said, that you turn to wait for his son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, that is Jesus.
[time=1671] Now here it is, who delivers us from the wrath to come.
[time=1675] Apparently in the presentation of the gospel to these Thessalonians, Paul had declared to them not only that they were sinners in need of forgiveness,
[time=1684] but that forgiveness was needed or they would not be delivered from the wrath to come.
[time=1689] We don't know the full extent of what he said about the wrath to come.
[time=1692] We don't know the full extent about what he taught them on the day of the Lord or about the day of the Lord.
[time=1697] But it is obvious that he has taught them something.
[time=1700] So let me fill out your understanding of this concept, the day of the Lord.
[time=1704] It is a technical term in the Bible, the day of the Lord, and it appears in the Old Testament a number of times.
[time=1710] It appears in the New Testament four times, one of which is found in the text this morning.
[time=1715] It is used to describe the day when Jesus comes back to bring the flaming fury of God's wrath on a sinning, unrepentant world.
[time=1726] It is a day of devastation. It is a day of destruction and doom and damnation.
[time=1732] It is the day when Jesus comes back to judge those who have rejected him.
[time=1737] Isaiah, Jeremiah, Joel, Amos, Malachi, Zephaniah all speak of this great final day, the day of the Lord.
[time=1747] And their terms are all negative.
[time=1749] It is a time of judgment and wrath and anger and desolation and vengeance and destruction and darkness and distress and trouble.
[time=1758] The day of the Lord is the final climactic judgment of God on those who have rejected Jesus Christ.
[time=1766] Now, it is not just a day. It is not just a 24-hour period.
[time=1772] It is in fact a period of time called the day of the Lord.
[time=1777] And it begins in rather natural ways.
[time=1781] It begins with the wrath of God being poured out upon unrepentant men, wicked men who have rejected Christ through natural means.
[time=1789] It tells us in the book of Revelation that wars, more wars than you and I have ever read about or experienced,
[time=1796] that wars will become the pervasive component in human experience.
[time=1801] Furthermore, another natural expression of the wrath of God will be famines and they will be worldwide
[time=1807] and food will reach exorbitant prices and people will starve to death without proper nourishment.
[time=1813] It will be further more characterized by a day of disease.
[time=1817] Untreatable diseases will overcome humanity in this the beginning period of the period of the day of the Lord.
[time=1825] But it will cross a barrier and it will go from natural stuff like wars and pestilence and disease
[time=1833] and it will become supernatural.
[time=1835] And the expression of God's wrath will actually take on his supernatural intervention against the laws of nature.
[time=1844] That is described in Revelation and I will read you a brief passage that describes this crossing over
[time=1851] into the supernatural expression of the wrath of God in the day of the Lord. It reads this way.
[time=1855] And I looked when he broke the sixth seal and there was a great earthquake and the sun became black
[time=1865] as sackcloth made of hair and the whole moon became like blood.
[time=1872] That is supernatural. That is breaking the laws of normal nature.
[time=1877] It goes on and the stars of the sky fell to the earth as a fig tree casts its unripe figs when shaken by a great wind.
[time=1887] And the sky was split apart like a scroll when it is rolled up and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.
[time=1897] You see this is the unnatural. This is the supernatural intervention of the wrath of God in the day of the Lord.
[time=1904] The reaction to it is found in the following verses. It says that the kings of the earth and the great men and the commanders
[time=1911] and the rich and the strong and every slave and every free man hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains.
[time=1919] And they said of the mountains and of the rocks, "Fall on us and hide us from the presence of him who sits on the throne
[time=1927] and from the wrath of the Lamb." For the great day of the wrath has come and who is able to stand.
[time=1937] It is a most terrifying day. If any of you have seen the previews or had even gone to these movies as of late like
[time=1946] the movie entitled Armageddon, they can now with some of these special effects really bring the portrait or the picture of both the devastation
[time=1956] and the trauma, at least with these things falling from the sky. It is going to be an amazing thing.
[time=1964] If you know anything at all about science, the reason these movies come is not because of what Hollywood would consider the fiction of the Bible.
[time=1971] It is because the scientists of our day know full well that this is probable.
[time=1976] In Matthew 24, another passage that describes this great moment in history reads this way.
[time=1983] Jesus speaking in the Olivet Discord says, "But immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun will be darkened
[time=1991] and the moon will not give its light and the stars will fall from the sky and the power of the heavens will be shaken."
[time=1999] And then the sign of the son of man will appear in the sky. We don't know exactly what that is.
[time=2004] And again, this is not the rapture. This is long after the rapture has occurred. This is the day of the Lord.
[time=2010] This is a different coming of Christ to the earth. And this is His coming in fury and wrath and vengeance.
[time=2016] But there is in this coming the sign of the son of man. It will appear in the sky.
[time=2021] And then all the tribes of the earth will mourn and they will see the son of man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory.
[time=2030] So this coming is not to rapture His church. This is the coming of Christ for vengeance and wrath and judgment and devastation and destruction.
[time=2042] And it will be a terrifying thing.
[time=2046] The terrible destruction, the terrible wrath of God, His fury and His righteous anger will come upon the wicked.
[time=2054] Now, that event, which had some pre-cursing events, these wars and famines and diseases.
[time=2061] And then it finally escalates. It's often described as birth pangs, as a woman would deliver.
[time=2067] And you know, those of you who are either mothers or husbands and such, you know this stuff, that they come on kind of light.
[time=2075] And they gain in their intensity and they gain in their frequency until finally there is great, great pain.
[time=2082] And the wars and the famines and the diseases are the early pangs.
[time=2087] They are light in comparison and they are separated by time.
[time=2091] And that eventually as this whole thing begins to intensify, just like labor, they come faster and faster.
[time=2096] They are more severe until finally they explode in this moment when the son of man will appear.
[time=2101] And that then launches what they are called the bold judgments in the book of Revelation and they are even more intense than the seal judgments we've kind of looked at.
[time=2110] It leads to this destruction eventually of the entire universe.
[time=2115] Everything you know and see will burn, this entire planet poof gone under the judgment of God.
[time=2123] And then there will be a resurrection.
[time=2127] And this time, not the kind we looked at last week, not the resurrection of the believers.
[time=2132] You know, to live forever in eternal bliss with God, there is another resurrection that occurs after all this stuff is devastated.
[time=2139] And it is the resurrection of the wicked.
[time=2141] And that is described in detail in the scriptures.
[time=2144] It goes like this in Revelation chapter 20.
[time=2147] And I saw a great white throne and him who sat upon it from whose presence the earth and heaven fled away.
[time=2154] And no place was found for them.
[time=2156] Now here it is.
[time=2157] And I saw the dead, the great and the small standing before the throne.
[time=2163] See, they've been resurrected.
[time=2165] And the books were opened and another book was opened, which is the book of life.
[time=2170] And the dead were judged from the things which were written in the books.
[time=2175] And the sea gave up the dead which were in it.
[time=2177] And death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them and they were judged.
[time=2182] Every one of them according to their deeds.
[time=2185] And death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire.
[time=2188] This is the second death, the lake of fire.
[time=2191] And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.
[time=2198] And there gives the final chapter in the wrath of God being spewed out on wicked men who reject Jesus Christ.
[time=2206] Their rejection of Christ is confirmed in the fact that their name was not written in the book of life.
[time=2212] And as soon as a person accepts Christ as their Savior, their name is instantly written in the book of life.
[time=2217] So at this great judgment, they are in no peril.
[time=2220] They cannot be thrown into the lake of fire for all of eternity because their name is in the book.
[time=2224] And they got their name in the book because they accepted Christ.
[time=2229] So this great wrath, this great terrible day of judgment called the day of the Lord,
[time=2236] begins slowly with birth pains, light at first.
[time=2239] It intensifies with supernatural intervention into the laws of nature whereby God brings great devastation upon the earth.
[time=2246] He eventually destroys the entire earth, all that we see and know about our earth and universe, is consumed in fire.
[time=2253] And then at the great white throne, judgment, he resurrects all the bodies and the souls and the spirits of all those who died rejecting Christ.
[time=2262] And he brings them before his judgment seat where he judges them based upon their rejection of Jesus Christ,
[time=2268] and then throws them into eternal damnation, the lake of fire, the second death, and there is never chance for release.
[time=2276] It is over.
[time=2278] The Bible says in Hebrews that it is appointed for men to live once and then comes judgment.
[time=2283] It is what you do in the space of your life, your physical life on earth with the person of Jesus Christ that inevitably and eventually determines your destiny for all of eternity.
[time=2295] That, in essence, is the day of the Lord and all that follows after it in the expression of the wrath of God.
[time=2303] How much of that Paul explained, I don't know.
[time=2307] And of course I could go on and on and on and on and on describing all of that.
[time=2311] I mean, that's a very thumbnail sketch of all of these in-time judgments by God upon rejectors of Christ.
[time=2318] But it's obvious that he had given them something. He had explained to them something and their movement towards Christ to accept him as Savior was in some way motivated by their understanding and belief in not a cyclical view of history that which would have been predominant in their culture.
[time=2335] And certainly not in this atheistic evolutionary view of history, but in the fact that there is a God and this God is sovereign and he controls history and it hasn't appointed in.
[time=2344] And that is when men stand before him to be held accountable for what they have done with Christ.
[time=2350] Now, the second thing I want you to notice from this text about the day of the Lord is it's coming.
[time=2356] It's coming. Look at verses one and two.
[time=2360] He says, "Now as to the times and the epics, brethren, you have no need of anything to be written to you, for you yourselves know full well that the day of the Lord will come just like a thief in the night."
[time=2374] Now, here he begins to answer the question, when is this going to happen?
[time=2378] And again, they apparently had this question burning in their heart.
[time=2382] Maybe they were being attacked and accused by those who were persecuting them, and if you were with us you saw they were under heavy persecution in chapters one through three.
[time=2390] And maybe part of that persecution was the onslaught of the mocking, unbelieving culture to say, "You know what? Paul said when he was here that Jesus would come again in wrath and he hasn't come, why are you believing in a man who told you that Jesus would come again in wrath?"
[time=2410] And here we've been now already three to four, five weeks, and Jesus hasn't come back yet.
[time=2416] And if they don't understand that the coming of Christ is not able to be known by anyone, see what he says, you have nothing to be told you.
[time=2427] You don't know when the day comes. It comes like a thief. How does a thief come?
[time=2431] A thief comes unexpectedly. Your relatives, hopefully, tell you they're coming, right?
[time=2439] Your friends, they tell you they're coming. Theats, they don't tell you. That's the point.
[time=2445] They come when you do not expect them. So when will all this stuff happen? Can we put a date on it?
[time=2452] Can we tie it down? Can we get it to a place where we can actually expect it? And the answer is no. It comes unexpectedly.
[time=2461] It comes like the thief in the night. Acts chapter 1 verse 7, Jesus said the same thing when he said, "It is not for you to know the time or the epics which the Father has fixed by his own authority."
[time=2475] The famous one is in Matthew 24 verse 36 where Jesus said, "But of that day and hour, no one knows."
[time=2484] Not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone. Jesus in his humanity had even divested himself of the knowledge of when this great day of the Lord would actually hit upon the earth.
[time=2499] It comes like a thief. Now that is clearly communicated over in Matthew 24. And if you have a Bible this morning, I want to take a zip over to Matthew 24.
[time=2510] I'm going to be there a little while. And it may have better your understanding of some of these events and some of these truths if you read them for yourself right there in the text.
[time=2519] In Matthew 24, there are many passages that expand on the fact that you and I are just not going to be able to know, and no one will, and no one can affix a date or an hour, and anybody who does it does it in direct opposition to the revelation of Scripture.
[time=2535] Anybody who ever tries to tell you, they know the day or the hour, that kind of stuff, they are doing that in direct opposition to the truth in the Word of God.
[time=2545] In Matthew 24, verse 42, he says, "Therefore, be on the alert for you do not know which day your Lord is coming." Right? There it is.
[time=2556] Why does he refuse to tell us when he is coming so that we will be on the alert?
[time=2562] Verse 43, be sure of this, that if the head of the house had known at what time of the night the thief was coming, he would have been on the alert and would not have allowed the house to be broken into.
[time=2574] Right? That's the point. You don't know when a thief is coming. And so you need to stay alert. For this reason, you too be ready for the son of man is coming at an hour when you do not think he will.
[time=2585] There it is. That's very clear. Look at verse 40, "Then there shall be two men in the field, one will be taken, and one will be left."
[time=2595] What that means is neither of them were prepared. Neither of them were ready. One of those apparently is a believer who got saved after the rapture.
[time=2603] And at the beginning of this, the day of the Lord, he will gather his elect. And that taking of the one in the field is the gathering of the one man who apparently had come to Christ since the rapture.
[time=2613] He gets snatched out of there and the other guy is left. The point is they both were going about the daily course of life, neither of them knowing when it was going to happen.
[time=2623] Verse 41, "Two women will be grinding at the mill, one will be taken, and one will be left." Again, apparently the woman who is taken is a woman who has come to saving faith in Christ after the rapture.
[time=2635] She now stands on the edge of this great wrath. The wrath of the Lord, and the Lord is not going to let her go through that.
[time=2641] And so at the beginning of that process, he snatches the remaining believers from the earth and then pours out his wrath.
[time=2647] They're both in the midst of their daily tasks. It's an amazing thing.
[time=2653] So the point is this, we do not know why this is going to happen. And we, excuse me, when this is going to happen.
[time=2661] And he puts every generation on notice. Every single generation that has ever lived is thereby put on notice that the day of the Lord may come in your day.
[time=2672] And so be ready. Don't postpone it. It may, in other words, you don't have till the end of your life to make necessarily the decision about Christ because you may get caught in the middle of the day of the Lord as an unbeliever and the wrath of God will come.
[time=2689] And in this great outpouring of the wars and the famine and the disease and then the supernatural destruction or disruption of natural normal causes, you may die.
[time=2699] And you may die in your sin and you may die without ever having had a chance to accept Christ thinking all the while, well, I'll have a foxhole conversion right near the end of my life.
[time=2708] Don't do that. You can't predict it. Get ready and stay ready and be ready right now is the point.
[time=2716] Look at verse 45, chapter 24.
[time=2719] Who then is faithful in the sensible slave whom his father, excuse me, who then is the faithful and sensible slave whom his master put in charge of his household to give them their food at the proper time?
[time=2732] Blessed is that slave whom his master finds so doing when he comes.
[time=2738] Truly I say to you that he will put him in charge of all his possessions, but if that evil slave says in his heart, my master is not coming for a long time and shall begin to beat his fellow slaves and eat and drink with drunkards, the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour which he does not know.
[time=2760] You get it? It leaves you and I constantly and all of humanity on the alert that you cannot postpone your dealings with Christ because he may come yet before you've dealt.
[time=2773] And look what he does when he comes, verse 51 in the parable and shall cut him in pieces. This is the wicked slave and shall cut him in pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites weeping shall be there and the gnashing of teeth.
[time=2788] Guess where that is? That's hell. Jesus is very, very clear.
[time=2793] He puts every generation on notice, deal with me now, deal with me today, make up your mind about your sin and your preparedness to be in my presence right now because I may come now is the point and you will not know.
[time=2811] No man knows the hour and the day. It is in fact a gift, isn't it? This sense of expectation, this sense of anticipation, this heightened sense of accountability is really a gift of God to put every single human being in the proper place to be honest, sincere and earnest about this appointment that they have with God.
[time=2835] Well let's go back now to 1 Thessalonians for a second and look at the third point that I wanted to establish from this text which is its portrayal, its portrayal, this is an amazing thing friends.
[time=2847] Look at 1 Thessalonians chapter 5, it says, "While they are saying peace and safety, then destruction will come upon them suddenly like birth pangs upon a woman with child and they shall not escape."
[time=2861] Here's the amazing thing that in every generation there has been a group of people who have cried out peace and safety.
[time=2872] In other words, against the backdrop of this great truth that the day of the Lord is coming like a thief in the night, there are those wicked Christ rejectors who will stand up in front of the peoples and they will say cause, cause yourself no concern over these things.
[time=2890] It is not going to end that way. Peace and safety is our lot and they will spend their various tales.
[time=2900] If you happen to have seen the movie Armageddon, which is that pseudo depiction of one of these great rocks falling from the sky, how does it end?
[time=2910] It ends in peace and safety. The closest Hollywood gets to showing the power and the ferocious ability of God to destroy the heavens and the earth is probably found in this movie, but what do they do?
[time=2925] What do they do? They send a little rocket ship up to this falling rock and they drill a hole in the rock and they drop an atom bomb into the middle of the rock that would if it hits this kill us all instantly.
[time=2937] They blow it up and half of it goes around this side of the earth and half of it goes around this side of the earth and what are they saying?
[time=2943] They're saying peace and safety. We will be able to save ourselves even from this great climactic event, our technology, our ingenuity, our ability will be so strong that we will be able to blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[time=2960] They'll spin it any way they can and you can imagine when the Christians finally get raptured out and the tribulation begins and things are starting to get really, really tough and the wars and the famines and all that stuff.
[time=2971] They'll put a spin on that. These people are finally gone and now some of these hard things have to go through but it's going to be the beginning of a new age and a new dawn and even when it gets black and even when the stars fall and the sky goes out and there's no light.
[time=2986] They'll still be people crying out, peace and safety, wait, this is really the beginning of a new day and there will be thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of people who will believe them.
[time=3002] That's an amazing thing. We are a gullible people. No matter how clearly God warns, no matter how much detail He gives, there will always be people who will stick their head in the sand and refuse to believe that a final day of reckoning is already on its way.
[time=3024] The classic illustration of this is back in Matthew 24. If you want to go there, it's about Noah. Remember Noah? What did Noah do?
[time=3035] Well, Noah went around at Matthew 24 and of course his story is back in Genesis. Noah went around for how long? Ten years? No, 120.
[time=3046] Noah went around preaching righteousness for 120 years and while he was doing that, he built the biggest ship to date in history to that date.
[time=3057] And everybody saw it and everybody mocked him and everybody laughed at him and everybody said he was a crazy guy and every day he'd get up and he'd preach the end of the world.
[time=3066] Every day he'd say that God is going to destroy us with a great flood because we are wicked and if you know anything about the people living in that day, they were as wicked as we are.
[time=3075] I mean, they were a gross, detestable, given over people and they refused to hearken unto the words of this man and his testimony. Look at chapter 24 of Matthew, verse 37.
[time=3086] For the coming of the Son of Man will be just like the days of Noah.
[time=3091] For as in the days which were before the flood, they were eating and drinking. They were marrying and giving in marriage until the day that Noah entered the ark.
[time=3104] And they did not understand until the flood came and took them all away. So shall the coming of the Son of Man be.
[time=3113] Isn't that interesting? What does that mean? They were eating and drinking and marrying and giving in marriage. Let me tell you what kind of people do that.
[time=3120] The kinds of people that do that are the kinds of people that think that life is going to go on as normal, right?
[time=3125] If you think that your life is going to continue the same way today and tomorrow and next month and next year for the next decade, basically, what do you do?
[time=3133] You get involved in eating and drinking and marrying and giving in marriage. That's the future.
[time=3138] And even though for 120 years, Noah had walked around and told them explicitly about the great coming wrath of God on the world because of their sin, a worldwide devastation.
[time=3149] They didn't care. They went right on eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, basically saying peace and safety, peace and safety.
[time=3155] Don't worry about the mad man with a big boat. It didn't going to affect us.
[time=3161] They did it all the way. Look, it's so amazing. They did it all the way until he got in the boat.
[time=3169] And you know what happened, right? When he got in the boat, God closed the door.
[time=3176] And when he closed the door, he meant nobody else is coming in. Your time for repentance is over.
[time=3183] See, God has dates. God has points of reckoning. God has points where he says, "I told you and I told you and I told you and I told you and I told you and now I'm going to shut the door of opportunity for your salvation."
[time=3196] And he slammed that door shut and the rain started to come and people beat on that arc and people cried and people did everything they could to get that thing open and it wasn't going to open.
[time=3207] And what does it say? They got all swept away until the flood came and took them all away.
[time=3219] Wow. So there is then this question. How should we then live?
[time=3230] Not based necessarily just. It's a great question. It's a great book. You ought to read it, Francis Shafer. How should we then live? Not based on what we've learned from our past.
[time=3240] But how should we then live in light of what the Bible tells us is true about our future and in fact our end, the end of history?
[time=3251] Well, he answers that question. In 1 Thessalonians chapter 5, you'll see in verses 4-11, he's going to begin to say, "Hey, now you brethren are not in the darkness, that the day should overtake you like a thief.
[time=3266] For you are sons, sons of light and sons of day. We are not in the darkness, so then let us not sleep as others do.
[time=3273] Be alert and be sober." And then he talks about all the stuff that you and I are supposed to do as we respond, not to what has happened in history, but how history is going to end.
[time=3289] Down at a country store somewhere in the deep south, a few ragged young men had draped themselves over the front porch rail to sip cola and razz the passerby's.
[time=3299] When I became an old woman, Ms. Bezi, a fine stout Christian woman, nourished through the years by the good book, fried chicken and sensible living.
[time=3313] She stopped, sized up the smirking boys through her bifocals and climbed the stairs to tend to her shopping.
[time=3322] Preacher says, "Jesus coming soon, Ms. Bezi," called one fella through grinning eyes.
[time=3328] "You believe Jesus coming soon, Ms. Bezi?" taunted another, holding in a snicker like steam in the belly of a stove.
[time=3337] Flashing a glance at the lolling boys, she straightened her shoulders and said, "I'd do indeed sure as you was born."
[time=3348] They pressed her, "Well, ain't you better hurry home and get ready?
[time=3354] Jesus might be on his way from glory right now." Having just stepped inside the store, she turned, stared into their mocking eyes and said, "Y'all listen here."
[time=3366] "I don't have to get ready. I keeps ready."
[time=3373] "Y'all come back next week." I'll tell you how to keeps ready. I'm invite you to stand for a closing word of prayer.
[time=3387] Hark, gracious Scott and Heavenly Father, I deserve that wrath. I deserve the full fury of your wrath
[time=3397] because I have violated your holiness time and time and time and time again.
[time=3404] I've done it as an unbeliever and I've done it as a believer.
[time=3409] And there is no claim that I could ever make, that I deserve anything other than eternal damnation.
[time=3422] I ought to have to live through those great wars and famines and diseases.
[time=3427] I ought to have to live on that terrifying day when people will look up and see the sun has gone black
[time=3435] and they'll wait for the moon, but it'll never shine.
[time=3438] And as huge, destructive and powerful objects begin to fall from the sky
[time=3444] and begin to destroy and plummet this earth, I deserve to have to live through all of that tear
[time=3451] just then waiting for my resurrection to be judged at the great white throne.
[time=3455] And then to have you say to me, "Russell, depart from me, for I never knew you. You practice lawlessness."
[time=3464] Hmm. That should be my end.
[time=3469] And that should be the end of all of us.
[time=3472] But many of us here today have found your love and your grace and your mercy in the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=3480] You have saved us, not by our merit, but on the basis of your love.
[time=3485] And for reasons that escape us, when you look at us, you love us.
[time=3490] Love us enough to send your son to live on this earth, to be despised and rejected by his own.
[time=3499] And worse than that, to die, to die the death that should have been my death and to take the wrath of God upon himself.
[time=3506] Father, we thank you and we worship you this morning.
[time=3509] We praise you for sparing us from the wrath to come.
[time=3514] And we ask that you'll bring us back next week and let us come with hearts that are full of commitment
[time=3521] and willingness and submission to live out our days in a way that is commensurate to these great truths.
[time=3530] We love you and praise you.
[time=3532] We pray these things in Christ's name and all God's people say. Amen. God bless you.
