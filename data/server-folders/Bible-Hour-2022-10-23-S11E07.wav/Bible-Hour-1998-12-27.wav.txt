[time=15] (upbeat music)
[time=45] - Thanks you, guys.
[time=47] - Well, hey, good morning, everybody.
[time=55] Good to see you.
[time=56] Glad that you could make it here.
[time=58] Today, we're looking forward to a great service together.
[time=62] We want this morning to be a lot of fun for you.
[time=65] We're glad the kids are here.
[time=66] We want you to feel absolutely no pressure whatsoever.
[time=71] You know, be keeping them real quiet and in order if they want to get up and walk around, they can.
[time=76] If they want to cry, they can.
[time=78] It's no big deal.
[time=79] We're going to be flexible today.
[time=81] Today only, mind you, but we're going to be flexible today.
[time=84] And we're just really, really glad that you're here and that they're here.
[time=88] We're going to do some special things for the kids as the service progresses.
[time=94] We really are glad to be able to celebrate what we've been celebrating these last couple of days and we're looking forward to the chance to celebrate together.
[time=103] I want to just tell you a quick story.
[time=105] My heart was absolutely encouraged beyond belief this morning just to kind of give you an idea of what happens.
[time=112] I think more often than you realize it around here.
[time=115] We were here this morning early getting ready for our morning and we had a lady come in off the street and she came in looking for a pastor.
[time=126] And since every one of them are on vacation except me, it was me and so I went out there and she had a son who was really hurting a broken ankle that had been tended to but wasn't responding real well.
[time=141] He was having a horrible time walking.
[time=143] She had just broken her arm.
[time=145] They weren't able to sleep in their apartment because it's like 25 steps up and he can't walk up the stairs and she can't help him up the stairs because of her arm and her condition.
[time=156] And so she's asking for some help.
[time=159] And I'm thinking about what's going on in here and I'm thinking about her and times going by and there was a lady in the foyer this morning new to our church in the last couple of months I think who happened to be a social worker.
[time=174] And she was here early looking for, not realizing there was only one service and she was looking for a class to go to and really wanted to fit in more in our church.
[time=183] She overheard the conversation, pulled us aside and said, I'll take care of it.
[time=188] You guys go back and you do it, I'll take care of it.
[time=190] I'll make the phone calls, I'll get them something to eat.
[time=193] I'll take them wherever they need to go.
[time=195] And I'm happy to do it.
[time=196] Merry Christmas and your just great attitude and great heart.
[time=199] And it makes me thankful, I don't know about you, but it makes me thankful to be a part of a family of people like that.
[time=205] And so a great start to the morning and we want to invite you to kind of join into the morning now and we're gonna sing.
[time=211] And we're gonna sing a song that the kids across the street, they know this.
[time=217] It's to the tune of jingle bells rewritten by one of our own ladies here in the church, Lori Catash.
[time=223] She rewrote the words and it's a fun song.
[time=225] Kids, you know it.
[time=226] So you gotta teach your mom and dad and us adults.
[time=229] And why don't you go, I'll stand.
[time=230] Go ahead, get up in your seats there.
[time=232] It's to the tune of jingle bells.
[time=234] It's got a great message to it.
[time=236] And again, have a great time.
[time=238] Have fun, go at it and here we go.
[time=241] [MUSIC - 327 seconds]
[time=573] - Maybe soon.
[time=577] [MUSIC - 190 seconds]
[time=771] - Well, this morning, we want to get you thinking about something specific.
[time=777] Call it our theme, call it the message of the day.
[time=780] We want you to even now begin to consider this idea of giving.
[time=786] There's been a lot of that going on lately, in your home, in our home.
[time=791] We had a great, great day, the day, in our home around the tree, there was some precious moments.
[time=799] There were some great little windows of time there.
[time=804] When you saw in the eyes of a child, or even my mom, who was with us, just the meaning of a gift that is given with real thought and consideration.
[time=815] When we give something special happens, and this morning, we're going to talk about giving.
[time=820] This morning, we're going to talk about not just the giving that you and I have done in the last couple of days, but more importantly, the attitude and mindset of giving that needs to continue long past December.
[time=834] And this morning, these guys, you're going to see kind of reenacted for you, a scene that probably took place in Christmas tree lots all across the country over three, four weeks ago.
[time=847] But we want you to think about this.
[time=849] This would be a bad example, kids.
[time=852] This would be a bad example of this thing called giving.
[time=855] And we're going to get some good examples later, but watch how easy it is, kids and adults.
[time=861] Watch how easy it is to lose that sense of what this season is all about and what God has called us to.
[time=868] Again, long past December, this attitude, this heart of giving.
[time=871] Watch what can happen sometimes when it goes awry.
[time=875] Stop crying now, I heard you.
[time=886] You want this scrawny old thing.
[time=888] It does not remind you of your mother.
[time=890] Do you want me to tell you you said that?
[time=892] Look, I said I'm getting the stupid trick.
[time=895] Oh, hey, hello, Larry.
[time=898] How are you?
[time=900] It's fine, John.
[time=902] Yourself?
[time=903] Great, just great.
[time=905] Merry Christmas to you.
[time=907] Same to you.
[time=908] You got all your shopping done?
[time=913] No, no, not quite yet, you.
[time=915] Just a few things I need to pick up.
[time=917] Yeah.
[time=919] Hey, isn't it funny that you and I both ended up on the admissions committee there at church?
[time=925] That was something, boy.
[time=927] I didn't even know you wanted to be on the committee.
[time=929] Oh, yeah, yeah, but I was kind of surprised to see your name on there, too.
[time=932] Not that you're not mission minded or anything.
[time=934] Oh, sure.
[time=935] I always find it important to reach out to those heathen around the world.
[time=939] Yeah.
[time=940] So, what brings you here?
[time=945] Oh, rushing out to pick up a tree.
[time=947] Gotta late start this year.
[time=949] You know how hectic things can get this time of year at work, especially if you're in sales.
[time=953] Oh, yeah, yeah.
[time=954] You know, Larry.
[time=958] I saw some really gorgeous trees over here on the Gilman Avenue side of the lot.
[time=962] Some real beauties.
[time=963] Thought I'd tell you about them.
[time=965] Well, you know, I saw some wonderful trees over by the register there.
[time=969] They're all perfect, straight as an arrow.
[time=972] Perfect sides.
[time=973] Not one of them has a side you'd have to turn the wall.
[time=975] You know what I mean?
[time=976] Yeah.
[time=979] Hey, that's great.
[time=980] Thanks for the tip.
[time=981] Thank you.
[time=982] I think I'll just mosey over and check out those trees you told me about.
[time=989] Oh, why would you look at those trees?
[time=992] They're setting up over there.
[time=993] They must have got a new shipment.
[time=995] Hey.
[time=996] Look, Appleton.
[time=1000] My little Joni wants this tree and this tree.
[time=1003] Oh, you catch my drift.
[time=1004] There are plenty of other piney wonders on the lot.
[time=1007] No, you look, Miller.
[time=1008] My little Lawrence has his heart set on this tree.
[time=1011] And at Christmas time, he always gets exactly what he wants.
[time=1013] Got it?
[time=1014] He loves this tree.
[time=1016] Your kid loves this tree.
[time=1018] It's a scrawny old thing.
[time=1019] Right.
[time=1020] That the limbs are hanging half off.
[time=1022] Half bald.
[time=1023] Couldn't hang a ball on it.
[time=1025] Ballon would slip off.
[time=1026] It's a sad excuse for a tree.
[time=1028] But it's mine!
[time=1030] It's mine!
[time=1031] Oh, it's okay, honey.
[time=1038] Daddy's only pretending.
[time=1040] Hey.
[time=1041] Don't cry, Lawrence.
[time=1043] Daddy and his friend are just playing pin the price tag on the Christmas tree.
[time=1048] All right, Nora.
[time=1050] How much you want for the tree?
[time=1051] Not one red cent, Appleton.
[time=1053] This tree is mine, got it.
[time=1054] Now, I'm telling you to back off.
[time=1056] I dibbed this tree.
[time=1060] You did what?
[time=1062] When I walked in the place, I did it.
[time=1064] Look, I'm the one who called it.
[time=1067] I called it from the entrance.
[time=1069] I called it from the parking lot.
[time=1071] When?
[time=1074] Ten minutes ago.
[time=1077] Look, I was driving by on Gilman Avenue this morning.
[time=1080] I saw the tree, and that's when I dibbed it.
[time=1086] Oh, you did not.
[time=1089] Did so.
[time=1090] Uh-huh.
[time=1091] Prove it.
[time=1093] It's mine, bonehead.
[time=1099] This tree has my name written all over it.
[time=1101] Let go of it, Appleton.
[time=1102] Let go of it before I flock your face.
[time=1107] No, both kids are crying.
[time=1110] What is their problem anyway?
[time=1113] Look, do you want the tree or not?
[time=1117] No.
[time=1119] What do you mean no?
[time=1121] That's not what you told me earlier, honey.
[time=1123] What do you mean it's not a Christmas tree anymore?
[time=1125] Now, you know Daddy.
[time=1128] Daddy only wants to get you what'll make you happy.
[time=1132] Kids.
[time=1133] Go figure 'em.
[time=1135] Yeah, they sure don't think like us, that's for sure.
[time=1137] Well, I'm glad you finally opened your eyes, Lawrence.
[time=1139] This thing with a little tarble in the front room.
[time=1141] You know, Joni, I think that little tree top angel would have flown away from this one.
[time=1146] Kids.
[time=1147] They sure know how to embarrass their parents sometimes, don't they?
[time=1152] Yeah.
[time=1153] You know, and all we're trying to do is give 'em a happy holiday.
[time=1156] That's right, after all it is for them, isn't it?
[time=1158] Yeah, Christmas, it's for the kids.
[time=1160] They're the ones that get all caught up in it.
[time=1163] They're right, you are.
[time=1165] Hey, uh, where'd you say those trees were, Jon?
[time=1169] Over there on the Gilman Avenue side of the lot.
[time=1171] Great.
[time=1172] Thanks a lot.
[time=1173] Hey, Merry Christmas.
[time=1177] Oh, I mean, Daddy's sorry.
[time=1179] I didn't mean to upset you.
[time=1181] No, son, that was Daddy's friend.
[time=1183] I wasn't really angry.
[time=1185] It's Christmas, remember?
[time=1187] I was only play acting.
[time=1189] Daddy would never get that upset.
[time=1191] Hey, it was only a tree.
[time=1215] Thanks, guys.
[time=1225] Okay, hey, let's do this.
[time=1227] We want to get some time with the kids, and we're going to read a story.
[time=1232] And the story is called Jacob's Gift, and what I want to do is this.
[time=1236] If you are here this morning and you can, let's just say, you can walk.
[time=1242] If you want to send your kid up and he can walk here, she can walk.
[time=1246] I'm going to meet you right back here in this center aisle, and then we're going to come up on stage.
[time=1251] But we're looking for like two-year-olds up throughout, guess fourth grade or so.
[time=1255] If you want to come join me right over here, we'll go on up on the stage and we'll read a story.
[time=1260] But come on over here and join me.
[time=1263] We're going to read ourselves a story about giving.
[time=1265] It's called Jacob's Gift.
[time=1267] Let's say two years old or so all the way up to third, let's say third grade.
[time=1272] Or if you're in fourth grade or fifth grade and you want to come up anyway, that's great.
[time=1276] Stay here with me, guys.
[time=1280] That's all right.
[time=1281] Like I said, we're flexible today.
[time=1283] You can go wherever you want to go.
[time=1286] Come on, crew.
[time=1287] We're going to come on down here, and you guys can sit up here around the chair and around the table on the stage.
[time=1295] Come on, here we go.
[time=1297] Come on, wow.
[time=1299] We're going to need some more stage.
[time=1302] Come on, you guys.
[time=1303] Come on up here and squeeze in.
[time=1306] There you go.
[time=1307] Good job, man.
[time=1308] We're all looking so nice.
[time=1310] Oh, looking so nice.
[time=1312] I guess I should probably get in there, huh?
[time=1318] There we go.
[time=1322] Come on in here, you guys.
[time=1323] Good job.
[time=1324] Come on down here.
[time=1325] I'm going to sit right here.
[time=1328] I feel too old sitting in a chair reading stories to kids.
[time=1332] I'll give it a shot here.
[time=1333] Come on in here, you guys.
[time=1334] Come on.
[time=1336] Come on in here.
[time=1338] Hey, Tegan.
[time=1340] Are you all dressed up in your Christmas dress?
[time=1342] That looks so nice.
[time=1344] Come on in, you guys.
[time=1345] Come in closer, okay?
[time=1346] Make room for all the boys and girls.
[time=1348] Come on in here, close.
[time=1351] Come on, come on.
[time=1353] Yeah?
[time=1354] Where's your sister?
[time=1356] I don't know.
[time=1357] I'm not sure where she is.
[time=1360] You want to sit with me?
[time=1363] You see, Mike, still be on that one.
[time=1369] We're all those kids are, yeah.
[time=1371] Come on up, you guys.
[time=1372] Have a seat.
[time=1373] We'll squeeze on in here.
[time=1374] Hi, sweetie.
[time=1375] How are you?
[time=1376] Come on in here, you guys, Tegan.
[time=1377] Come over here, bud.
[time=1378] Sit right here.
[time=1379] There you go.
[time=1380] Come on in, you guys.
[time=1381] There you go.
[time=1382] Come on in, come on in.
[time=1386] We got lots more room up here, guys.
[time=1388] Scooch on back here.
[time=1396] There you go.
[time=1397] We're going to make it here.
[time=1399] We are going to make it.
[time=1400] Hi there.
[time=1407] There you go.
[time=1408] Come on in here.
[time=1410] There you go.
[time=1412] Good job, you guys.
[time=1414] Thanks for waiting patiently back there.
[time=1417] Come on in here.
[time=1420] There we go.
[time=1427] You got an ouchie?
[time=1429] Oh, did you sit?
[time=1430] Yeah, you got to watch out for those pine needles from the tree.
[time=1434] You might have heard a little bit.
[time=1441] All right, come on in, gang.
[time=1444] Any more room back there?
[time=1445] Come on, Morgan.
[time=1446] Good job, you guys.
[time=1447] You're doing great.
[time=1451] You know, I was practicing this morning and I realized how gifted teachers.
[time=1455] I remember my teacher.
[time=1456] She used to read like this, so I'd dawn on me.
[time=1458] You got to learn to read upside down.
[time=1460] So I'm probably not that good, but we'll give it a shot.
[time=1463] What are my teeth?
[time=1465] Kind of what a book like that.
[time=1467] Yeah?
[time=1468] Yeah, see, I'm probably not that good, so keep the expectation level really low.
[time=1473] And we'll have a good time, all right?
[time=1476] Okay, you guys, this is called Jacob's Gift.
[time=1478] Can you see it?
[time=1479] It's called Jacob's Gift, and you've got to listen really close, okay?
[time=1483] Listen really close, and we're going to learn a little bit more about giving.
[time=1487] And what a great thing it is to give.
[time=1489] So here we go, you ready?
[time=1490] It's called Jacob's Gift.
[time=1492] Here we go.
[time=1494] By Max Lakado.
[time=1496] You ready?
[time=1497] Rabbi Simeon brushed the sawdust off his hands and began untying his apron.
[time=1503] Before you leave today, I have a special announcement.
[time=1505] He said as he hung the apron on a wooden peg and turned to look at the handful of boys in his shop.
[time=1511] All but one apprentice had removed their aprons and put away their tools.
[time=1516] Rabbi Simeon looked across the workshop.
[time=1518] One boy continued sawing on a piece of wood.
[time=1521] Jacob, the rabbi instructed.
[time=1524] Our work is finished for the day.
[time=1526] Put away your tools.
[time=1527] Jacob didn't respond.
[time=1529] The only sound he heard was the swish swish of his saw, and now swish swish was the only sound anyone heard.
[time=1536] But Jacob didn't know that.
[time=1538] The other boys in the shop began to snicker.
[time=1541] Rabbi Simeon, see here?
[time=1545] Rabbi Simeon let out a deep sigh and shook his head, but he wasn't mad.
[time=1550] Down deep he was pleased.
[time=1552] He too knew what it was like to get lost in the world of woodworking.
[time=1556] But it was time to go home.
[time=1558] Jacob, oh thanks buddy, I appreciate that.
[time=1561] Nice.
[time=1562] Thank you very much.
[time=1565] Jacob, the rabbi called again his voice a bit louder this time.
[time=1569] The sighing stopped.
[time=1571] When Jacob heard no other noise, he knew he had done it again.
[time=1574] Slowly he placed his saw on the table.
[time=1577] "I'm sorry Rabbi," he said softly.
[time=1580] Rabbi Simeon smiled, "It's all right.
[time=1582] Put away your tools and hang up your aprons." See, there's Rabbi Simeon and there's Jacob.
[time=1588] And Jacob finally figured out it was time to put up his saw and time to go home.
[time=1593] Now listen to this part.
[time=1595] Jacob quickly cleaned off his work area.
[time=1598] With a sigh, he stood and walked across the room, never looking up.
[time=1602] This was the part he hated most.
[time=1604] Everyone was looking at him.
[time=1606] This was, he hung up his apron as the other boys continued to snicker.
[time=1611] Jacob's cheeks burned.
[time=1612] Finally, the rabbi spoke and all eyes turned back to him.
[time=1616] As I said, and this is what the rabbi told him, okay, he said this, "As I said, my nephew from Nazareth should be here within a few days.
[time=1625] He is a master carpenter who knows quality work and he will help me select one of you for a special task.
[time=1633] The one who builds the best project will work with me on the new synagogue." Wow, I know.
[time=1640] So all the boys were going to get to compete and the rabbi's friend from Nazareth was going to help him pick one boy to help work in the synagogue.
[time=1650] It will be me.
[time=1652] The words were so strong and Jacob's thoughts.
[time=1655] He heard, he feared he had spoken them out loud.
[time=1658] Only days earlier, he'd overheard the rabbi say, "Just leave Jacob alone with wood and he can do almost anything." Jacob had turned red then too, but that time with pride.
[time=1668] I just have to be chosen.
[time=1672] Jacob determined, "I want to use my hands to help build God's house." It doesn't matter that everyone says, "I'm so shy at this time." And then he heard this, "Jacob, Jacob, did you hear what I said?" No, sir.
[time=1687] I'll be away for the next three days, but you may all use the workshop to finish your projects as the others begin to leave the rabbi asked Jacob to stay.
[time=1697] See, there's the rabbi, Simeon, again talking to Jacob.
[time=1700] He asked him to stay.
[time=1702] He has something he wants to talk to him about.
[time=1704] Again, Jacob felt his cheeks warm.
[time=1707] He waited until everyone had left and then approached the carpenter.
[time=1711] "I'm sorry, rabbi," he apologized.
[time=1713] "I'll do better next time." The rabbi motion for Jacob to sit on one of the stools.
[time=1719] "Oh, Jacob, you've done nothing wrong.
[time=1722] I asked you to stay so I could tell you something." The rabbi smiled, the rabbi smiled, pulled up a stool and sat down.
[time=1729] He placed his big hand on Jacob's shoulder and began.
[time=1732] "God has given you the gift of woodworking.
[time=1735] What is difficult for many is easy for you.
[time=1738] Surely you've noticed." Jacob nodded slowly.
[time=1742] He had wondered why other boys struggled with the wood to make things that seemed so simple to him.
[time=1748] "God gives gifts," now listen to this you guys.
[time=1751] "God gives gifts," Jacob.
[time=1753] Some can sing, others teach, and you, you can build.
[time=1758] You have a special gift.
[time=1761] Have you ever wondered why God gave you this gift?
[time=1764] Well, so I can learn to be a good carpenter, he guessed.
[time=1768] Well, the rabbi chuckled, not exactly.
[time=1770] God gave you this gift to share with others.
[time=1773] Let's say you gave a present to one of my daughters.
[time=1776] How do you think that would make me feel?
[time=1779] Well, happy?
[time=1780] Well, of course it would.
[time=1781] Even though you gave the gift to my child, I would feel like you had given the gift to me.
[time=1786] And God is like that too.
[time=1788] When we give a gift to one of his children, it's like giving a gift to God.
[time=1794] If you ever have a chance to help somebody, remember what I've told you.
[time=1798] Now, run home and tell your father that I hope he has an end full of guests for next week.
[time=1805] So Jacob has a special gift and the rabbi wanted him to know how important it is that he uses
[time=1812] his gift and give that gift to others whenever he had a chance.
[time=1816] That evening at supper, see there at supper there, eating dinner, there's Jacob.
[time=1821] He's at home having dinner with mom and dad, and his dad owns the local inn, the hotel there.
[time=1827] That evening at supper, Jacob's father reminded him of the days ahead.
[time=1832] We're expecting a lot of business, son.
[time=1834] I'll get up early, promise, Jacob.
[time=1836] I will work on my project in the mornings and help you in the evenings.
[time=1841] There were lots of people coming to town.
[time=1844] The next three mornings, Jacob crawled out of bed while it was still dark.
[time=1848] You ever get out of bed when it's still dark?
[time=1850] Sometimes.
[time=1851] Yeah, I know.
[time=1852] Sometimes.
[time=1853] Yeah, I know.
[time=1855] Really dark.
[time=1857] And you do too?
[time=1859] Well, that's what Jacob did, you guys.
[time=1861] He got up so early.
[time=1863] It was still dark.
[time=1864] And he got up to work, oh, sorry, sweet.
[time=1866] He got up to work on his project.
[time=1868] With a fire going and a lamp burning, he worked hard to complete his project.
[time=1873] The other boys had laughed when he told them he was going to build, what he was going to build.
[time=1878] But now that it was almost finished, they weren't laughing anymore.
[time=1882] Jacob was building a new kind of animal feeding trough.
[time=1887] See that?
[time=1888] He's building a new kind of animal feeding trough.
[time=1892] Yeah.
[time=1893] You watch now, watch what happens.
[time=1897] He got the idea while watching some men work in the stable next to his father's end.
[time=1902] They loaded a wagon full of hay, rolled it into the shed and dumped it in the trough.
[time=1907] He thought, why not put wheels on the trough?
[time=1911] Why not put wheels on the trough?
[time=1913] And that's what Jacob was planning to do.
[time=1915] Jacob had returned to the workshop after helping his father at the end.
[time=1919] Rabbi Simeon will be here tomorrow.
[time=1921] I must finish tonight, thought the sleepy boy.
[time=1925] Jacob looked at the trough and then at the four wheels piled on his workbench.
[time=1930] So much work still to do.
[time=1932] He was so tired.
[time=1933] Maybe if I close my eyes for just a few minutes.
[time=1937] Look how tired he is.
[time=1939] He's been working hard.
[time=1941] And now he's starting to go to sleep.
[time=1944] It's so late.
[time=1947] He got up in the middle of the night.
[time=1949] That's right.
[time=1950] He's bound to be tired, huh?
[time=1952] Amazing.
[time=1955] I know.
[time=1956] It was time to go night.
[time=1957] Watch what happens.
[time=1959] Watch what happens in what seemed like the very next moment.
[time=1963] A beam of starlight slipped through a crack and fell across Jacob's napping eyes.
[time=1968] Why? He shouted, startled by the sudden light.
[time=1972] He had slept through the night.
[time=1974] Then he looked out and saw the village showered by a gleaming, shimmering light in the night.
[time=1979] Jacob rubbed the sleep from his eyes as he walked outside and toward the star that seemed to dance in the sky near his father's end.
[time=1987] Look, he sees the star.
[time=1989] It woke him up.
[time=1990] It was so bright.
[time=1993] He walks towards the star.
[time=1997] Watch what happens here.
[time=1999] Then he heard a strange sound in the stable behind the end.
[time=2004] Quietly, Jacob crept closer.
[time=2007] He looked through a not hole in the stable wall there in a tiny nest of straw on the ground was a baby.
[time=2015] Beside the baby knelt his mother, a man gently covered her with his cloak.
[time=2020] "The baby must be uncomfortable on the ground," Jacob thought.
[time=2025] Quickly, Jacob turned and raced back to the workshop.
[time=2028] He stood beside his newly built feeding trough.
[time=2031] He had measured each board so carefully.
[time=2034] He had cut each piece with skill.
[time=2036] He had oiled it with care.
[time=2038] It was the best work Jacob had ever done.
[time=2041] Tomorrow, the rabbi would select the best apprentice.
[time=2045] But tonight, there's a new baby without a place to sleep.
[time=2049] Look at Jacob.
[time=2051] He's thinking about it.
[time=2053] He's thinking about this new trough that he built.
[time=2056] And there's this baby.
[time=2058] And who's the baby?
[time=2060] That's right.
[time=2062] It's Jesus.
[time=2063] Good morning, boys.
[time=2065] Good morning, boys, said Rabbi Simeon.
[time=2067] This is the big day.
[time=2069] Jacob approached the rabbi.
[time=2072] Sir, I need to tell you something.
[time=2075] Later, Jacob, we need to get everything ready for my nephew.
[time=2078] Here, help me.
[time=2080] The rabbi's voice drifted off as he began to take the projects outside.
[time=2084] An unfinished chair.
[time=2086] A desk with one leg too short.
[time=2088] And a wobbly stool.
[time=2090] Then, looking at a stack of four wheels, he asked, "Where is your project?" Jacob, "Where is it?" That's what I tried to tell you.
[time=2099] Something happened.
[time=2100] There was this big star.
[time=2102] And, see him, pointing up in the air, showing the rabbi where the big star was.
[time=2107] Uncle Simeon.
[time=2109] Joseph, Simeon shouted, extending his arms.
[time=2113] I'm so glad that you're here.
[time=2115] Jacob's eyes widened.
[time=2117] This was the man he had seen with the baby in the stable the night before.
[time=2122] Well, thanks, bud.
[time=2123] Appreciate that.
[time=2126] Thank you very much.
[time=2128] Jacob was, Jacob, this is my nephew from Nazareth.
[time=2132] So Jacob sees the man who was in the stable, and it's Joseph.
[time=2136] And it's Rabbi Simeon's nephew.
[time=2139] Jacob was too surprised to speak, so Joseph spoke in his place.
[time=2145] "We've already met," said Joseph, putting a hand on the boy's shoulder.
[time=2150] In fact, Jacob gave my newborn son.
[time=2153] Jacob gave my newborn son his very first gift.
[time=2158] Your son?
[time=2159] The rabbi inquire?
[time=2161] What son?
[time=2162] Where is he?
[time=2163] Come with me, and I'll show you.
[time=2165] Then the rabbi and Jacob hurried behind Joseph.
[time=2169] Joseph led them around a curve and down a hill toward the end.
[time=2173] Did you stay at the end, Joseph?
[time=2175] Well, not quite.
[time=2176] It was too full, Joseph smiled.
[time=2178] "Well, then where did you stay?" asked Rabbi Simeon.
[time=2181] "Well, you'll see." Joseph led them past the end to the bottom of the hill.
[time=2185] There he left the path and turned toward his shelter.
[time=2188] The stable, Simeon asked, "You kept your baby in a Joseph smiled and placed a finger to his lips."
[time=2194] Quiet, Uncle.
[time=2196] They're asleep.
[time=2197] Follow me.
[time=2198] He lowered his head and entered the stable.
[time=2201] A cow mooed at the presence of the trio.
[time=2204] Joseph stepped next to the trough and motioned for them to approach.
[time=2208] When the rabbi and his student looked inside, they saw a beautiful newborn baby.
[time=2215] Look at that, you guys.
[time=2217] Look at that.
[time=2218] There's the baby, and there's Mary, and there's Joseph.
[time=2222] And there's the brand-new trough.
[time=2226] His name is Jesus, Whisper Joseph, and he has a cradle fit for a king.
[time=2233] Joseph's kindness made Jacob's cheeks turn red, but he felt so good seeing the baby asleep in the feed trough that he had made.
[time=2244] A trough?
[time=2245] That's something that the animals usually eat out of, but this time they put hay inside it and laid baby Jesus in the trough.
[time=2253] Do you really?
[time=2254] She probably sleeps in a crib, huh?
[time=2256] Yeah.
[time=2257] Now watch what happens.
[time=2259] Now, this is great.
[time=2261] Listen to this.
[time=2262] Now, this is the rabbi talking to Jacob.
[time=2264] He's so proud that he did what he did.
[time=2266] Now, I see why your project was missing, said the rabbi, and it is the finest project I've seen.
[time=2274] You will be the one to help build God's house, but tell me, why did you decide to give your feed trough away?
[time=2281] Jacob smiled with delight.
[time=2283] I remembered what you said, Rabbi.
[time=2286] When you give a gift to one of God's children, you give a gift to God, said the boy.
[time=2292] The rabbi's voice was soft, and so you have my son, so you have.
[time=2297] Good story, huh?
[time=2298] Yes.
[time=2299] That's good?
[time=2300] Oh, yeah, you guys can clap.
[time=2305] Hey, you guys, listen now, okay?
[time=2307] Before you go, we're going to sing a song, all right?
[time=2310] Okay?
[time=2311] And you probably know parts of the song.
[time=2312] We got some folks up here.
[time=2313] They're going to help us sing, so you guys sit down, be real still, and we're going to sing a song.
[time=2319] And the song is about what we just read about.
[time=2321] It's about giving a gift.
[time=2323] And so as we sing, you think about what we read, okay?
[time=2326] And if you know the song, you can sing.
[time=2328] I think the folks are going to join us.
[time=2330] Thanks for sitting down for so long.
[time=2332] Here we go.
[time=2333] You guys, listen up.
[time=2335] Don't you love?
[time=2343] It's not right.
[time=2344] [MUSIC - 35 seconds]
[time=2381] The gift goes on, the song gives us love, the song gives us love, the song gives us love, the song gives us love.
[time=2400] When your heart is full of Christmas, then your life is full of love, you can give away the present that was sent by God above, just like ripples in the water, the circles of our love extend.
[time=2422] What was started with the Father is a gift that has no end, and the gift goes on.
[time=2431] The Father gave the Son, and the gift goes on.
[time=2435] The Son gave the Spirit, and the gift goes on.
[time=2438] The Spirit gives the Son, and the gift goes on.
[time=2449] The Son gave the Spirit, and the Spirit gives the Son.
[time=2454] The Spirit gives the Son, and the gift goes on.
[time=2461] Great job, guys.
[time=2464] Good job.
[time=2465] Okay, let's walk on back down, okay?
[time=2468] Thanks. Go real slow now, okay? Go real slow.
[time=2473] Thanks, man. Thanks.
[time=2475] Good having you up here.
[time=2479] [indistinct chatter]
[time=2497] Thank you very much.
[time=2500] It's not on.
[time=2508] Thanks.
[time=2512] Kevin, you did good.
[time=2515] Well, hey, thanks for letting us have the kids for a while.
[time=2518] I hope that was fun for them, and I hope you enjoyed.
[time=2523] It was a great story, wasn't it?
[time=2525] It was really thankful.
[time=2526] Beth Armstrong found that recently in one of the bookstores, and we enjoyed reading through it and thought it would be nice for the kids.
[time=2534] Hey, we want to just take a couple of minutes, and I hope you'll be willing to help me with this now, okay?
[time=2540] This is going to take some participation on your part, but we thought, you know, we really like being together.
[time=2547] I mean, we hear it every time we get a chance to have one service.
[time=2551] We hear folks say it's great to be together.
[time=2554] It's great to see each other.
[time=2555] We don't normally get to do it, and so we thought maybe this morning, if it would be all right with you, we wanted to just hear from a few of you, and what we wanted to do was just ask you this.
[time=2565] Again, with this idea of giving and the receiving of gifts in mind, maybe in the last couple of days you received a gift, and it was a gift for you that was just very, very special.
[time=2579] It meant a lot to you.
[time=2580] For whatever reason, it was a gift that was near and dear to your heart, and we're not talking the biggest or the most expensive.
[time=2588] We're just talking about a gift that you received that you really, really enjoyed.
[time=2593] It was an encouragement for you.
[time=2595] It was helpful to you. It spoke to your heart, and it just really, really blessed you.
[time=2600] And so we thought we would just take a couple of minutes, and if there's no response,
[time=2606] then I'll just tell you everything I got for Christmas, and then we'll pray.
[time=2610] But really, we wanted to just give you a chance, and let's not be real formal.
[time=2615] Let's just give me a chance to get to you.
[time=2617] But we want to hear from each other, and just see how your Christmas was, what was fun for you, what gift did you receive that meant a lot to you.
[time=2624] Somebody, start us off, and I'll come find you real quick.
[time=2627] Oh, right here. Sandy, go on and stand on up there, right where you are. Thanks.
[time=2631] I think the greatest gift of all is just having all of your children, and your grandchildren, and coming to this church.
[time=2639] The Christ is so representative, and have communion together.
[time=2644] What a precious gift.
[time=2645] That was a good night, the other night, wasn't it?
[time=2648] Now, Sandy, how many grandkids, how many children and grandkids do you have total?
[time=2652] Three children and nine grandkids.
[time=2655] And you guys got to all be together?
[time=2658] Amen. That's great. Awesome. Somebody else, I'll give right here.
[time=2663] Oh, Anna, first Anna, and then we'll go back here. That's okay, go ahead.
[time=2667] Well, this isn't exactly a gift, but it is in the sense.
[time=2671] I have my daughter and grandson here, but ever since they were little, the first thing they did was have the Christmas story before any present, believe it or not, and my daughter had us take turns.
[time=2684] Now, it's not too bad now, but when they were little, now that was a real chore, but it was a blessing because we could all see what everyone got.
[time=2692] Oh, that's special. And you enjoyed it.
[time=2694] Yes, I did. Well, that's great. Thanks for sharing that, Anna.
[time=2697] Yes, ma'am. Hi, I just wanted to say that our greatest gift was our daughter and grandson moved home from Houston, Texas,
[time=2709] and we've been with Otter for 12 years, so it's just a blessing.
[time=2713] Wow, that's great. Thanks for telling us about that.
[time=2716] Somebody else. Yeah, you want to pass this on down?
[time=2720] They're to Jane on the end. Thanks, Jane.
[time=2724] I think one of the most special things I get from my son is his unselfishness, and this year he had made some candles for me at camp in October, and he saved them, and he says, "I hit him behind my bed, so you'd never find a mom." And so he had me open a gift this year that was from him, and I was very touched by that since he's never been able to, you know, get to a store to get me anything, and that's always fine, and I always tell him he can always draw me a picture, write me a verse, or give me a coupon for something, and this year he had a little special gift that he made himself, so I appreciate that in him.
[time=2758] That's great. Those are fun times. Back here in the back, yes, ma'am.
[time=2763] Here we come. Special gifts.
[time=2768] Our daughter, Deneem left for the mission field in July this past year, and when I was hanging her stocking this year, I started crying.
[time=2777] She showed up on our doorstep.
[time=2779] No, did she really? From where?
[time=2781] From Taiwan. From Taiwan, and you didn't know.
[time=2784] Oh, what a surprise. What a great thing that must have been.
[time=2787] Oh, that's good to hear. Anybody else?
[time=2790] Over here on this side. A special gift.
[time=2793] Yeah, back in the back. Roger, come up, come down here so they can see you.
[time=2797] Go ahead.
[time=2801] It's been two Christmases, two different Christmases.
[time=2803] In 1995, I found a real nice girl, and I'm going to get married next year, and then this year I had a beautiful so grandson.
[time=2811] That's right. You've had some additions, haven't you?
[time=2813] Oh, that's great. That makes it special, doesn't it?
[time=2815] Thanks, Roger. Anybody? I don't want to miss this side over here.
[time=2818] Anybody over here? Real special. Oh, right here. I see.
[time=2822] This is great hearing from all of you. There you go.
[time=2826] My oldest son gave me a beautiful porcelain, figurine of the mother and child called nurturing, and that meant so much to me. Oh, that's nice.
[time=2837] From your son? Yes. That's nice.
[time=2840] Okay, let's go over here. Any special gifts over here?
[time=2845] Yes, where are we? Oh, hey, big guy.
[time=2848] Right here, man. Did you get a special gift? What did you get?
[time=2852] I got a fireman truck.
[time=2856] Oh, your own fireman truck. That's about as special as a gets, man.
[time=2861] That's great. Your own fireman truck. Anybody over here?
[time=2865] Oh, yeah, Theresa. Was that a hand, Marilyn?
[time=2868] Marilyn, was he? Come on, man. Just kidding. There you go.
[time=2872] I got probably, to me, one of the most special things.
[time=2875] My parents were divorced when I was 11, and for the first time in 18 years, my mother, my father, my sister and I were together yesterday.
[time=2884] And my parents are both remarried, so everybody looks at me like, "They get along. My parents get along better now than the average that they were married." And the most special gift to me was yesterday when we were all together for the first time in 18 years.
[time=2896] Wow. Hey, man. Thanks for sharing that. Anybody else down here?
[time=2901] Oh, I see you, sweetie. I'm coming right there.
[time=2903] Here I come, and we'll end with this one.
[time=2908] Here we go. Did you get a special gift? Tell us about it.
[time=2912] I got an American girl doll, and my mom showed me the dress.
[time=2916] Wow. How special? That is special.
[time=2919] A special doll and a special dress sewed by mom.
[time=2922] Great. Well, I got a special gift for Christmas.
[time=2928] You guys may not know this, but go ahead and stand up. This is my mom, Gail Bird.
[time=2932] Say hi to Gail. Come on out here.
[time=2940] And many of you know, stay right here. Many of you know how special she is to me and to us,
[time=2946] and we don't get to have her with us all the time, but boy, it was great to have her here, and great to have her be there on Christmas morning.
[time=2953] It was a gift kind of just in and of itself to be able to be together, all that we have been through together, to be able to sit there with Kevin and the kids, and there's a lot of fun. Anything special, pop into your mind?
[time=2965] Yes, the airline ticket got here.
[time=2970] Hey, let's pray. Okay.
[time=2973] Father, thank you so very, very much for the family that we have here at this church.
[time=2979] For the things, God, that you have brought us through for the gifts,
[time=2985] the blessings that you have provided, Father, for the direction that you have given.
[time=2990] God, I pray that we would today just kind of take special note of what a wonderful privilege
[time=2997] it is to be a part of something like this. God, there is nothing like the church, when the church is who the church is supposed to be.
[time=3005] And so to be together, to be reminded, to be reminded this morning of all the faces, all the lives, all the families, all the people, God, that you've assembled here, and to hear how you have been so good to us, and to hear them, to talk about our gratitude is so encouraging. God, we pause now to give gifts to you.
[time=3024] Again, you have so faithfully provided for us in so many ways, and so we, in this offering this morning, please know it is a reflection of how truly appreciative we are,
[time=3037] and God, we do it with hearts that are full of thankfulness. In your son's name, we pray. Amen.
[time=3048] [MUSIC]
[time=3069] I have travelled many moonless nights, cold and weary,
[time=3082] with a baby inside, and under what I've done.
[time=3095] Holy Father, you have come, and chosen we now, to carry your son.
[time=3115] [MUSIC]
[time=3121] I am waiting, in a silent prayer, I am frightened,
[time=3134] by the Lord I bear, in a world as cold as stone.
[time=3148] Must I walk this path alone, be with me now, be with me now.
[time=3166] [MUSIC]
[time=3188] Light in my darkest, for over me are holiness, for you are all.
[time=3201] Breath of hell.
[time=3205] [MUSIC]
[time=3211] Do you wonder, as you watch my face, if a wiser one should have had my place,
[time=3230] but I offer you for the mercy of your play.
[time=3247] Help me be strong, help me be, help me.
[time=3259] [MUSIC]
[time=3263] Breath of heaven, hold me together, be forever new.
[time=3274] Breath of heaven.
[time=3278] Breath of heaven, light in my darkest, for over me are holiness.
[time=3288] For you are all you need.
[time=3296] Breath of heaven, hold me together, be forever new.
[time=3307] Breath of heaven.
[time=3311] Breath of heaven, light in my darkness, pull over me are holiness.
[time=3322] For you are all you need.
[time=3329] Breath of heaven.
[time=3348] [MUSIC]
[time=3362] I'm okay, yeah, you can hold on to it.
[time=3369] Thanks, Stephanie and Corbin.
[time=3372] Beautiful song.
[time=3374] Hey, let me in just the last few minutes this morning.
[time=3377] Let me read this story that I came across this past week and then just share a couple of thoughts with you before we go on our way.
[time=3384] Again with the idea of giving in mind and the power that comes with a gift that is given.
[time=3391] Let me read you this story, it's called a Christmas story.
[time=3395] It's just a small white envelope stuck among the branches of our Christmas tree.
[time=3400] No name, no identification, no inscription.
[time=3403] It has peaked through the branches of our tree for the past 10 years or so.
[time=3408] It all began because my husband Mike hated Christmas.
[time=3412] Oh, not the true meaning of Christmas, mind you.
[time=3416] But instead the overspending, the frantic running around at the last minute to get a tie for Uncle Harry and the dusting powder for grandma.
[time=3424] The gifts given in desperation because you couldn't think of anything else.
[time=3428] Well, knowing he felt this way, I decided one year to bypass the usual shirts, sweaters, ties and so forth and I reached for something special just for Mike.
[time=3438] The inspiration came in an unusual way.
[time=3442] Our son Kevin, who was 12 that year, was wrestling at the junior level at the school he attended.
[time=3448] And shortly before Christmas, there was a non-league match against a team sponsored by an inner city church.
[time=3456] These youngsters dressed in sneakers so ragged that sometimes shoe strings seem to be the only thing holding them together presented a sharp contrast to our boys in their spiffy blue and gold uniforms and sparkling new wrestling shoes.
[time=3472] As the match began, I was alarmed to see that the other team was wrestling without headgear, a kind of light helmet designed to protect a wrestler's ears.
[time=3481] It was a luxury, the ragtag team obviously could not afford.
[time=3485] Well, we ended up walloping them. We took every weight class one, every match, and as each of their boys got up from the matty, swaggered around in his tatters with a false bravado, a kind of street pride that couldn't nor wanted to acknowledge defeat.
[time=3502] Mike, my husband, seated beside me, shook his head sadly.
[time=3505] I wish just one of them would have won.
[time=3509] They have a lot of potential, but losing like this could take the heart right out of them.
[time=3514] You see, Mike loved kids. He loved all kids, and he knew them well having coached Little League, football, baseball, and lacrosse.
[time=3521] And that's when the idea for his present came.
[time=3525] That afternoon, I went to a local sporting goods store and bought an assortment of wrestling headgear and shoes and sent them anonymously to the inner city church.
[time=3535] On Christmas Eve, I placed the envelope on the tree, the note inside telling Mike what I had done, and that that was his gift that year from me.
[time=3546] His smile was the brightest thing about Christmas morning that year, and in the succeeding years.
[time=3553] For each Christmas, I followed the tradition, one year sending a group of mentally handicapped youngsters to a hockey game.
[time=3560] Another year, a check to a pair of elderly brothers whose home had just burned to the ground the week before.
[time=3566] The envelope became the highlight of our Christmas.
[time=3569] It was always the last thing opened on Christmas morning, and our children, ignoring their new toys, would stand with wide-eyed anticipation as their dad lifted the envelope from the tree to reveal its contents for that year.
[time=3582] As the children grew, the toys gave way to more practical presence, but the envelope never lost its allure.
[time=3590] While the story doesn't end there, you see, we lost my husband, Mike, last year, due to dreaded cancer.
[time=3597] And when Christmas rolled around, I was still so wrapped in my own grief that I barely got the tree up.
[time=3603] But Christmas Eve found me placing an envelope on the tree, and in the morning, it was joined by three more.
[time=3611] Each of our children, unbeknownst to the others, had placed an envelope on the tree for their dad.
[time=3617] The tradition had grown, and some day will expand even further with our grandchildren standing around the tree with wide-eyed anticipation, watching as their fathers take down the envelope.
[time=3629] Mike's spirit, like the Christmas spirit, will always be with us.
[time=3633] May we all remember the Christmas spirit this year, and always. And then I just wrote down a couple of thoughts.
[time=3641] And man, I added this, and may we never forget that the true spirit of it all is embodied in this act of what we call giving.
[time=3653] The true meaning of it all is embodied in the act of giving. His most favorite gift, Mike, the dad that died of cancer, his most favorite gift,
[time=3661] every year was the gift that brought happiness and joy to others.
[time=3666] And I was thinking, what if the idea of what shall I get for him, or what will I get for her, that idea that's dominated our minds for the last five weeks?
[time=3675] What if that idea of what should I get, what should I get for him or her stayed with us past December into January, February, March?
[time=3685] What if by May we were still asking ourselves, how can I help? What if by June we were still wondering, what could I get for him?
[time=3692] What could I offer her? What could I bring to them that would encourage and bring happiness and joy?
[time=3699] And maybe it's a gift, maybe it's not, maybe instead it's an act of service, maybe instead it's an encouraging word, maybe instead it's a hug.
[time=3710] But what if that mindset of giving, giving so as to provide happiness, giving so as to provide service, giving so as to bless and encourage?
[time=3721] And that same sense of anticipation that filled many of our living rooms on the morning of the 25th, what if that were something that we held on to?
[time=3729] What if that were something that we gave ourselves to, that mindset year round?
[time=3736] Christmas is over, the trees will come down soon, lights and nativity scenes will be stored for yet another year, diets will resume.
[time=3746] And as some would say, life will slowly get back to what? To what? To normal.
[time=3753] But why does it have to be that way? Why does normal have to be in some way removed?
[time=3760] From the very special things we heard about this morning, maybe in your life, maybe in your heart, maybe in your home, you can do something to kind of maintain and cultivate that spirit.
[time=3772] As an individual, maybe you can make that a commitment, I mean the new years around the corner, and maybe this idea of giving is something you in your own heart and your own life can kind of latch on to.
[time=3781] Maybe as a family, it's something that you might want to creatively try to approach and pursue. How can we keep this idea of giving?
[time=3790] How can we keep this mindset of offering blessings? How can we maintain that spirit as a couple, as a family?
[time=3799] I would encourage you this morning to think about it, to think about how powerful a thing it is, to give gifts, not just one time a year, but year round.
[time=3809] And let me just encourage you with this as well, I was thinking about our church, I was thinking about our people, I was thinking about so many of you who I know, and I just wanted to give you a couple things to take home with you this morning along this idea of giving.
[time=3824] You may be sitting here this morning thinking, okay, how can I give? We've been hearing about giving, we've heard a story about giving, we've seen a bad example of giving.
[time=3834] How can I take this idea of giving and kind of further entrench it in my heart and spirit?
[time=3840] Well, let me invite you to think about three things as you leave this morning, just three things, okay?
[time=3846] How can you give, let's start with number one, try giving up comfort for a greater sense of connection to this body, and here's what I mean by that.
[time=3859] There are so many of you here this morning who I know have been blessed and encouraged and you are so thankful for this place and what it's meant to you, and you've been here for a couple, two, three months, four, five, six months, maybe even a year.
[time=3872] And there are many of you in the room this morning and it's time for you to experience something even far greater than you've already experienced.
[time=3880] It's time for you to get a little bit more involved, time for you to take a couple steps further down that road of integration into this family and this ministry.
[time=3889] But sometimes what's hard is the fact that that requires you and I to give up a sense of personal comfort in some way.
[time=3896] Think about that, would you this morning, if that's you, many of you are way, way, way involved and that's wonderful.
[time=3904] Some of you here this morning need to give up personal comfort for the sake of a deeper sense of connection with this family.
[time=3911] Others of us in the room this morning need to give, we need to give up comfort, we also need to give God every arena of our life.
[time=3919] There are many of us in this room this morning, there are arenas of our lives.
[time=3925] There are many arenas of our lives that have been fully devoted and fully given to him.
[time=3930] There are some in the room this morning, we hold apart from that, we hold separate little tiny arenas full of things.
[time=3938] We're not quite yet ready to give, not quite yet ready to surrender, not quite yet ready to allow him full and absolute reign.
[time=3948] If that's you this morning, it would be our prayer and our hope that at this time of giving you would be willing to give him that.
[time=3956] Give him everything, you give him all of your life and your heart.
[time=3962] And then lastly I wanted to just say this, I would hope that this would be a time where we could give each other, those of us that make up this body.
[time=3970] The grace and the kindness that God has so richly lavished upon us.
[time=3977] It would be my hope for the coming year that we would continue to grow as a family.
[time=3983] Absolutely and completely willing and ready to give a kind word, a helping hand, an encouraging thought, an encouraging note.
[time=3993] Whatever it might mean that there would be a deepened commitment in our hearts to give each other the grace and kindness that God has so richly given us.
[time=4004] We need to be that kind of a people, we need to be a kind and gracious people.
[time=4010] So think about those things, would you? It is the time, it is the time of year when we give.
[time=4015] And I hope that you're willing and ready in your heart to give in those ways and I hope that it is a giving that doesn't stop this week.
[time=4022] That whether it's the giving up of comfort for the sake of deeper connection here at Blackhawk, whether it's the giving up of an arena of your life you know you need to give to him.
[time=4031] Or whether it's simply the commitment to give to each other, the grace and kindness we all deserve and have been called to give to each other.
[time=4039] I hope you'll think about those things, I hope you'll ponder those things.
[time=4043] It's been good being together this morning, thank you for coming and I hope it's been a good time for you and your family.
[time=4050] Let me invite you to stand if you would and let's end the morning in a word of prayer.
[time=4058] As you stand here let me read to you from the book of Philippians.
[time=4068] It says in Philippians chapter two it says this, "Make my joy complete, make my joy complete by being of the same mind maintaining the same love,
[time=4078] united in spirit intent on one purpose.
[time=4081] Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit but with humility of mind let each of you regard one another as more important than himself.
[time=4091] Do not merely look out for your own personal interests but also for the interests of others.
[time=4097] Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ."
[time=4103] Father it is our prayer this morning that as we continue to experience life and ministry together with the family of Black Hawk God that that would be our mindset,
[time=4114] that we would be as a people willing to give, give of ourselves, give of our hearts, give of our times, give of our energy,
[time=4121] to give ourselves completely to you and give ourselves completely and radically to each other.
[time=4127] God help that attitude and that mindset that was in you and your son Christ Jesus, help that to be present in our lives as well.
[time=4135] Give us strength and courage to walk that kind of a road in your son's name we pray. Amen.
[time=4141] Hey have a great great day, it was good seeing you.
