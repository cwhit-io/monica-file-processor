[time=29] [MUSIC - 12 seconds]
[time=49] Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=53] Thank you for joining us.
[time=54] We trust that the music and message from God's word will help you in your Christian walk.
[time=59] Please stay tuned.
[time=60] Now let's join our service.
[time=62] Here's the church, here's the steeple, open the door, and we get all the five people.
[time=71] Good morning, and how are you today?
[time=75] Fine, and you?
[time=76] Oh, I'm fine, and how about you, Gillian?
[time=78] Fine, thank you.
[time=80] Charles, good to see you in church this morning.
[time=83] How are you doing today?
[time=84] Fine, really, fine.
[time=86] That's fine, and how is Anne?
[time=87] I'm fine too.
[time=89] I didn't see you standing there.
[time=91] How are you feeling?
[time=92] Fine, fine.
[time=94] Rebecca, you look nice this morning.
[time=96] How's life treating you?
[time=97] I'm fine, thank you, and really fine.
[time=100] Thanks for asking, though.
[time=102] Alyssa, I haven't seen you in ages.
[time=107] Heard you're having some troubles.
[time=110] How are you?
[time=113] She looks fine.
[time=114] She acts fine.
[time=115] Fine, fine.
[time=116] Oh, isn't this a fine Sunday?
[time=119] I'm not fine, but as you can see, I go to the finest church in America, where everything
[time=126] is fine.
[time=127] Well, actually, everything isn't fine, but the congregation is much happier if they
[time=133] believe that everything is fine.
[time=135] You see, if you believe that everyone around you is fine, then you don't have to go out of your way to help or support them.
[time=142] They don't have to risk themselves by being open and vulnerable to you, and you don't have to risk anything, either.
[time=150] Isn't it much easier just being fine?
[time=153] Fine.
[time=156] To know and to be known, that is the quest.
[time=167] It's interesting to watch psychologists grapple with this idea of how people know each other
[time=176] and how they are known by each other.
[time=181] Not too many years ago, they did a study involving some monkeys.
[time=186] They had two study groups.
[time=189] In one of the groups, they allowed the new infant little monkeys to be naturally and
[time=195] normally cared for by the mothers, and as a result, they were constantly being groomed
[time=202] and touched and rubbed and held and carried by their mother.
[time=209] In the other sample group, they refused that contact.
[time=214] They performed all the functions that the mother monkey would have performed.
[time=218] The little baby monkeys were well fed, they were clean enough, they were warm enough,
[time=224] but they were excluded from any physical socializing contact from that of their mother.
[time=231] As you might expect, those little monkeys in the subject group grew up much differently
[time=237] and acted much differently as adults.
[time=240] They showed signs of extreme depression, they were malnutritioned, even though all the proper
[time=248] food was provided.
[time=249] As they grew up, they showed signs of either absolute isolationists in their behavior patterns
[time=255] or very, very aggressive and very, very angry and very, very dangerous.
[time=263] Later they did a different kind of study involving mice.
[time=266] They were trying to grapple with what had happened to the American population when machinery stole everybody out of farming communities and through thousands and thousands and millions of us packed in like sardines in the cities of Chicago and New York and they were trying to understand what kind of impact was that going to have and did it have and was there any explanation in that compacting of people for the increasing crime rate.
[time=293] With these mice, they had a little town and in the little town, the little box that was
[time=300] all divided up and you could move from one part to the other.
[time=303] They started with what might have been reasonable proportions of mice per square foot.
[time=308] The mice had all they needed to eat and the mice had all they needed to room, they needed for sleeping, et cetera, et cetera and they continually added more mice and more mice and more mice and more mice until there were too many mice.
[time=321] And the social behaviors that followed were very much akin to the social problems that
[time=330] were being found in the major cities of our country.
[time=336] Where's the balance?
[time=340] And where are you on the continuum between isolated monkeys and overcrowded mice?
[time=349] To know and to be known, that is the quest.

involved in that kind of community, to understand what it would mean to you, and do you understand what it would mean to our church as we seek to be a church, committed to and given to that process.
[time=2622] Well, edification at Blackhawk, what are some things that I told you before, some things are taking place, movement is being made and people are experiencing the kinds of things we long for them too.
[time=2634] There's a lot of opportunities for this at our church, and just to remind you this morning, one would be small groups, and we've got several kinds of small groups. We talked about last week the beginning of Seeker Groups. We've got established as of today, I mean we've had them for a couple of years now, a couple of two or three years, care groups, care groups that are a little bit more about believers in the faith, trying their best to sharpen and encourage and challenge each other through the Word of God and through a kind of love that we've talked about this morning. There's Seeker Groups, there's Care Groups.
[time=2667] We've got life skill groups. We offer those on a somewhat regular basis, and there you can begin to find a bit of what we've talked about this morning.
[time=2675] There's also the ABS, and the ABS, as you heard from one of the folks that wrote in, the ABS is a wonderful place where relationships begin to be established, where folks begin to sense that they're cared for, where they can make a connection.
[time=2688] That's a little bit smaller than this big, big room.
[time=2692] Small groups, Seeker Groups, Care Groups, Life Skills Groups, ABS, the opportunities are there for you and I to pursue that kind of living and that kind of life. Well, how about equipping?
[time=2704] How about equipping? That's edification. Let's talk a little bit about equipping, and that would be this, one of my favorite symbols of all the symbols we've got here. This one kind of, I think, does something for me because of what it represents, and I think kind of what it's done for me in my own life. This right here is the idea of equipping, and that puzzle piece with the unique thumbprint on it.
[time=2726] I hope that we'll begin to make more and more sense to you as we talk about this this morning.
[time=2730] A definition for us to kind of work with and understand to equip. To equip means to, it's a great definition.
[time=2738] It means to make right, to make healthy again, to mend that which is torn,
[time=2744] to set straight that which was broken, to equip.
[time=2748] It means to work with something in a way whereby it can then again be useful, whereby again it can pursue its intended function and purpose. And when you and I are willing to be equipped, when we are willing to be taught, when we are willing to be trained, when we are willing to have others make a spiritual investment in our lives, we get fixed in that sense.
[time=2772] Some of the holes get shorn up, and some of the things that might have been broken get mended, and all of a sudden we begin to be more and more healthy in our ability to go then and equip others. This is a commitment, equipping, a commitment on your part in mind to be involved in this process. To make our, and here's where this comes in right here, to make our divinely unique and divinely appointed contribution to this family.
[time=2800] This is you and me playing the role, the unique role.
[time=2804] See, no one else's thumb prints the same as yours in this deal.
[time=2808] No one else's shape is exactly like yours. God has uniquely gifted and uniquely appointed. That you and I would play the role, play the part that he designed us to play in this thing called the family of God.
[time=2824] What would a core value be under equipping? A core value would be this.
[time=2828] We believe the church flourishes, and we've seen it, and maybe you've seen it. We believe the church flourishes. It blossoms.
[time=2836] It blossoms and flourishes when people led by the Holy Spirit are serving in the right places for the right reasons. We believe the church flourishes when that takes place. There's this thing called, this ministry that we've started here called Network, and you've heard us talk about it possibly in the past, but this is such an exciting thing for us because of this very thing. You know, back in the 70s and 80s there was kind of the proliferation of spiritual gift inventories, and maybe you were a part of that and took some of those tests, and maybe they were extremely helpful, or maybe they confused you. I'm not sure, but what is so exciting about Network, as we see it kind of coming on to the evangelical scene in the 90s, is that Network does this really cool thing. It takes the idea of these tests, and it continues to teach that and help folks identify their gifts, but then it doesn't stop there. Now, network talks about the network ministry helps you understand not just your gift package, but your passion in life as well. What are the things that you really enjoy doing? What are the things that naturally, in light of the way God's wired you, you gravitate toward? What is it in your life? What is it in this opportunity that we would call black that you find yourself really feeling a sense of interest in?
[time=2916] It helps you understand what is your passion in life?
[time=2920] What are your gifts? What are your passion? Then what is your temperament?
[time=2924] What is your temperament? Are you highly task-oriented in your makeup, or are you highly people-oriented?
[time=2932] I mean, in other words, are you boring, or are you exciting?
[time=2936] Just kidding. What is your temperament? What is your passion? What is your gift? Then it takes all three of those.
[time=2944] And then we've got folks here at our church who run this network ministry, and they've been having worked with you in the understanding of those things.
[time=2952] You begin to find opportunities for ministry that are uniquely designed for you, and that's the way it happened, because he gave you a unique shape, and he gave you a unique gift, and he's given you a unique passion and temperament.
[time=2968] And it's so very exciting to see you. I think at this point we've seen 60, 70, 80 or so folks that have gone through network and come out the other end, by and large, so very thankful for the opportunity, and then they begin to get connected to places of ministry in our church, and it just lights them up.
[time=2988] It changes their life. It changes their experience here, because they have a place, a niche that fits, and an opportunity to be equipped and then to equip. Debbie from our church. She wrote me this last week.
[time=3004] Debbie says, "My main area of service at Blackhawk is helping in the children's ministry. I used to help when it was convenient, but when Greg came a couple of years ago, he challenged all of us to commit to serving every Sunday for a nine-month period. I accepted that challenge, and I asked God to give me a wholehearted commitment to serve in the children's ministry. God is faithful, and he answered that prayer, and I have helped ever since, and I can honestly say I would rather be there than sitting in my ABF or anywhere else, and I love my ABF. Also, being a part of the children's ministry helps to give me a sense of belonging. We are a group of people. See that community thing coming in again? We are a group of people with a shared purpose of serving God through work with our kids, and Greg has been a faithful shepherd for all of us.
[time=3056] Rick, Rick, one of our ministry leaders in network says that there is nothing more rewarding, nothing more exciting than to see people, than to watch people when the gift, passion, temperament, nickel drops, and the ministry light goes on, and they find that niche. They find that place, and he talks about it. It is just this amazing thing that he wishes every one of you could see and experience, what it's like to see somebody go through that process and come out the other side with a whole new understanding of what life in the family can look like. He says it's a great, great thing.
[time=3100] They have discovered that they fit.
[time=3104] They have seen and realized their God-given shape. Well, again, the experiences are consistent with the picture that we see painted in God's Word. A prevailing church, a church that is truly making a difference is a church where every member's a minister, where every piece plays its part. I want to skip over to first Corinthians.
[time=3128] First Corinthians chapter 12.
[time=3132] Another great passage that gives us some insight into this idea of you and I playing our part, filling our space, functioning in that supernatural way God had designed us to function.
[time=3144] First Corinthians 12, we're going to start at verse 14.
[time=3148] It says, "For the body is not one member." There it is.
[time=3152] "For the body is not one member, but many." If the foot should say, "Because I am not a hand, I am not a part of the body," is it not for this reason any the less, a part of the body?
[time=3164] And if the ears should say, "Because I am not an eye, I am not a part of the body," is it not for this reason any the less, a part of the body?
[time=3172] If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be?
[time=3176] If the whole were hearing, where would the sense of smell be? But now God has placed the members, each one of them in the body, just as he desired. And if they were all one member, where would the body be? Lost.
[time=3192] Confused. And ineffective is where we'd be.
[time=3196] What happens when, what happens when on the basketball court in the final five seconds the three men forgets to go across and set the pick for the four men? You lose.
[time=3208] What happens when the defensive lineman doesn't pick up the blitzing defensive back? When the offensive lineman doesn't pick up the blitzing defensive back, quarterback gets sacked. What happens at the office when the facts get sent at 5 p.m. instead of 8 a.m.
[time=3224] You lose the account. What happens in the church when you and I don't make our block? What happens when you and I don't function in that uniquely divine appointed role and shape that he called us to function in?
[time=3240] You know what happens? The 20% of the people just keep doing the 80% of the work and those 20% get fatigued, tired, and worn out.
[time=3252] And the church and that which it reflects and that which it accomplishes diminishes. Because there's people so many people often who haven't had the joy, haven't had the experience or the chance to go through that process of saying, wow I have a unique shape and I've been given spiritual gifts and God has not suggested but commanded me to offer them to this family.
[time=3278] And when that happens, lives change. When that happens, churches change and it is a great, great thing.
[time=3286] Let's go to a continuum if we can. A continuum for equipping, there's a couple of them and one continuum might look like this.
[time=3300] Where are you? Are you on the bench? Are you on the bench?
[time=3304] Are you warming up or are you in the game? Where would you be in that scenario? You've got a unique gift.
[time=3312] You've got a unique shape. If you're a part of the family of God and you call this place home, he has an opportunity for you to make a difference in this place. Where are you? Where would you be in that? On the bench.
[time=3325] Out of the game, watching. Maybe you're somewhere in the middle warming up.
[time=3329] Maybe you're deep in it. Given it all you've got.
[time=3333] Exercising and giving those things he's given. Or maybe it might just be as simple as to say, with respect to equipping, are you more prone to just be on the getting end? More prone to just be getting or more prone to having gotten than going and giving.
[time=3349] Giving to others, giving to kids, giving to students, giving to adults, giving to physically, mentally challenged, giving to new visitors. I could go on and on and on. The chances that you and I have to give to offer and to extend.
[time=3365] Equipping at Black Hawk. Equipping at Black Hawk.
[time=3369] A lot of opportunities that I'll just finish with this. Network would be one.
[time=3373] Ministry involvement and you see a whole slew of things.
[time=3377] Any of those. You could just call the church office. You could call the church office this week and talk to Greg Deeson or Eric Hall or Jean Cheryl or Kelly Bird and we could talk to you about any of those areas where you could tomorrow begin to offer yourself in a giving sense. In an equipping sense to the life and body of this church. That last thing there, missions.
[time=3401] I want to just say this about missions and then we're going to close.
[time=3405] Imagine, if you will, what it would be like to be a church so committed. So committed to the first three steps of our strategy.
[time=3417] Where the front door of our church becomes wide open. And then imagine people actually going through that process. And they get encouraged and befriended and possibly even saved. And having gotten saved they get built into. They get befriended. They get encouraged.
[time=3437] They get grown in their faith. And as a part of that they find out, you know what?
[time=3441] I have a place that I fit here.
[time=3445] And then having done that, what if they began to realize that there were things on their heart they wanted to do maybe even outside this place? All of a sudden we've got people equipping and doing ministry here but again when I mentioned missions it gets me thinking. You know what? We could become a church. We are in a sense but we could even become more so. A church that sends. A church with a wide open front door and a wide open back door that now is no longer a pond it's a what? It's a river.
[time=3477] And that's the kind of thing that we sit up and dream about and think about and pray about. And we hope that it is on your heart as well to pursue this kind of experience and this kind of existence.
[time=3489] A church with front door and back door wide open.
[time=3493] A church deeply devoted to edifying and equipping. Well let me invite you to stand this morning and we'll close our service with a word of prayer. Father thank you.
[time=3505] So very much for the opportunity that we have to continue this morning to look at this church that you've given us. God this mission that you've set on our hearts and this vision that we're trying to pursue.
[time=3517] Thank you so very much for all that you are doing as you move us in this direction. God where we need to continue to grow help us see that and help us understand that God give us courage to pursue those areas and God where we have grown allow us a sense of excitement and gratitude both personally and corporately.
