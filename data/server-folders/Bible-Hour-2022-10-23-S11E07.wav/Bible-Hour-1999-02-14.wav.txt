[time=30] Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=53] Thank you for joining us.
[time=54] We trust that the music and message from God's word will help you in your Christian walk.
[time=59] Please stay tuned.
[time=60] Now let's join our service.
[time=89] [MUSIC - 302 seconds]
[time=416] [APPLAUSE]
[time=423] [MUSIC - 13 seconds]
[time=456] And you remember what Jesus said to her? He said, "An hour is coming and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth."
[time=469] Now catch this. He then says, "For such people the Father seeks to be His worshipers." Isn't it interesting?
[time=480] We're in a series entitled, you know, Our Vision, Helping Seekers Find and Follow Christ, and from the very lips of Jesus we discover that they're not the only one seeking something.
[time=493] God Himself is seeking to redeem a people who will worship Him in spirit and in truth.
[time=503] Unfortunately, we don't come out of the womb ready to worship. The Bible tells us that we come out of the womb going our own way.
[time=511] There is a sense of inborn animosity that we stick in the face of God, and we say, "I am my own God, and I will worship myself, and I will fashion my own life."
[time=525] But so much does God long to be worshiped by people who will worship Him in spirit and truth.
[time=532] That by His grace and by His power, the next posture that He draws us to is not one of the fiance.
[time=539] But there in the Sermon on the Mount, the beggar, the one who knows He is spiritually bankrupt, who would bear, dare even look to heaven for the bread of life, but instead extends a hand.
[time=550] And says, "Oh God, I am totally unworthy, but please give me." And as God begins to give, the repentant center begins to look up into heaven and begins a posture of worship that is first from His knees from a broken heart.
[time=565] But that's not enough. God wants to grow, and God wants to mature, and God wants a level of worship that affects the way we treat each other.
[time=573] And the next posture is to move from the strife and the anxiety and the malice and the contempt that we hold, the relational meltdown that occurs in our lives.
[time=583] But He grows us according to 1 Peter 3. As we long for the pure milk of the word, we put away malice and guile and contempt, and we find love, we find relational maturity.
[time=598] And so the posture of worship is that of loving one another.
[time=603] But as wonderful as the beginnings are, there is yet another posture.
[time=609] And it is this thing He calls walking with me.
[time=614] He says, "You must grow past the infant stage. You must learn to walk with me." And in Ephesians 4, that means learning to carry the stress and the burden and the hardship and the trials of life.
[time=625] He hasn't promised us heaven here in the now. He has promised us purpose and meaning, but He says, "Extend your hand to me."
[time=632] And as we walk through the vicissitudes and trials of this life, I will hold your hand, and I will guide and lead you.
[time=638] And I will strip from you through these trials and burdens and adversities, the things which would keep you from truly worshiping me with the kind of depth that I long for.
[time=649] And so we learn to walk hand in hand with our Savior.
[time=654] And then there is another posture.
[time=658] It's the one that comes after walking. It is the running. It is the striving.
[time=663] It is having fixed our hope on Jesus. We run for the glory of God.
[time=669] We become these marathon runners who have set aside the things which so easily entangle us and the sin which besets us.
[time=676] We strip off and we begin to run the race to the glory of God.
[time=681] And the posture is total surrender, bringing everything that we are harnessed and honed and shaped for the glory of God.
[time=693] And this is our posture until we die.
[time=696] But that's not the end of worship.
[time=699] Oh my, there is yet another thing that happens on the other side.
[time=704] We go there to heaven, the place which God has prepared.
[time=708] He closes us in the very righteousness of Jesus Christ.
[time=713] And there it says in Revelation 21 that God has built heaven out of translucent material so that his very glory, the light which emanates from his very being cannot be obstructed so that no matter where we are,
[time=727] we are always in the immediate presence of the Shekinah glory of God. And in Revelation 22 it says that we get so much of it that like Moses of old we begin to radiate it from our very being.
[time=741] And worship is no longer something we just do with our life and our lips. It is something that we have become.
[time=747] We have become illumined to give glory to God.
[time=754] I want to begin this morning by acknowledging a couple of things, number one, that worship is one of the most exciting, fulfilling, satisfying experiences in the Christian life.
[time=766] When you get a hold of a life that is consecrated to God and you find your way into the corporate assembly such as this and they fire at you one of your favorite hymns or one of your favorite choruses.
[time=777] And the truth in that music along with the tune in that music, it has a way of flooding the heart and the mind with the sense of who God is and how good he has been to you.
[time=788] And explosive things happen inside of our hearts and our minds, don't they?
[time=793] Goose pumps find their way onto our skin.
[time=796] Tears find their way into our eyes.
[time=799] The quiver finds its way into our voice as we are absolutely overwhelmed with what it means to be born again, to be regenerated by the power of the Spirit of God and have from within our hearts a connection with the true and living God.
[time=814] And then of course to do that with others of like precious faith.
[time=818] Secondly, I want to acknowledge at this point in the message that we are as a church transitioning in our ministry.
[time=825] We have been since 1994 and we are continuing to transition and we're hoping soon to land and we're very close to that.
[time=833] This transition into the next millennium and it is for us much like it was for those who worshiped God in the days of Ezra.
[time=843] I think I have a slide that refers to this experience in the life of the people of God of Ezra.
[time=849] You remember they had been in captivity up there in Babylonian, Babylon for 70 years and they finally came back and the group that came back were some of those who had lived before in Jerusalem and had seen the first temple now having been destroyed.
[time=864] And so there was a group who had memories, there was a group who knew how it used to be.
[time=869] And then there was a group that had been born in the Babylonian captivity and had never seen Jerusalem before in their entire lives much less the temple of Solomon as it was originally constructed.
[time=881] God had called the people back to reconstruct the temple and to re-inhabit the land and to re-establish the process of worship as he had intended it.
[time=891] Look what happened. Having laid the foundation it says and they sang, praising and giving thanks to the Lord saying for he is good for his loving kindness is upon Israel forever.
[time=903] And all the people shouted with a great shout when they praise the Lord because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid.
[time=911] And it says this, "Yet many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers households, the old men who had seen the first temple, they wept with a loud voice when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes while many shouted aloud for joy."
[time=931] I want to acknowledge at the top of the hour that as our church continues to transition into this next millennium, I am aware of the fact and it grieves my heart that there are a number in our midst who at the same time are celebrating that God is doing something great and awesome in the life of Blackhawk, but at the same time find themselves weeping because it isn't like it was.
[time=953] And no component of church life can strike the weeping cord more profoundly than the worship cord because that is the one that tends to grab the emotions.
[time=967] And it is determined to move ahead in the completion of this new temple, if you will, that it will be hard for some, and I can only acknowledge that.
[time=977] And for many of you, it is hard simply because of the style.
[time=981] You're not saying it's worse, you're not making value judgments about the kind of worship, it just doesn't connect.
[time=987] In fact, for some, it's egregious, it's uncomfortable, it's stifling.
[time=991] That doesn't mean you're less spiritual, that doesn't mean that you're less godly, it doesn't mean that we think you're less spiritual or less godly, it just happens to be a preference in style.
[time=1002] However, there are some concerns that I hear raised in the life of our church, concerns that suggest what has happened even in this series has a worldly component to it, that it feels like entertainment.
[time=1015] Some have suggested we may be losing our commitment to the word.
[time=1020] I disagree with all those things, and I hope before the hour is over, you'll know why.
[time=1025] This morning I want to revisit what the Bible teaches about worship.
[time=1029] I want to state again what it is that God is asking us to do in worship, regardless of our style, whether it's contemporary or traditional.
[time=1038] First I want to teach the scriptures what is worship, but along the way, as I teach them, I want to offer explanation, insight and reassurance that we are headed as a church anywhere but towards the world or worldly, I should say, entertainment
[time=1057] or dare I say a loss of commitment to the word of God.
[time=1061] Please, if you have a Bible with you, open it to John chapter 4. John chapter 4, it's where we began the message.
[time=1068] We are asking this morning, and through this series, what in the world is God asking us to do?
[time=1073] What in this world, right here and right now, has God asked Blackhawk to do?
[time=1079] You remember, several weeks ago, that's called our mission statement, it's very clear, Jesus Christ has asked us to make disciples.
[time=1086] He further defined the disciple making process as baptizing people and as teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.
[time=1093] That is the front and the back of the great commission.
[time=1095] The making disciples is two things. It is winning people to Christ that culminates in baptism.
[time=1101] Having baptized them, we invite them into our family, into the community of the believers where we teach them and encourage them and instruct them to observe all that I have commanded.
[time=1111] They become like Christ. We have been doing that and understanding and reviewing.
[time=1116] That is our mission, and that is a universal mission statement that God has given to every church that has ever been in existence.
[time=1123] We have also acknowledged, however, that in each day, in each culture, in each country, God allows and in fact calls and empowers that church to find the unique expression of that mission statement through their vision,
[time=1138] through the particular way they are going to accomplish what God has asked them to do.
[time=1142] We have been reviewing our vision statement under these five figures.
[time=1146] We begin by an acknowledgement that people are open to authentic, trust-filled relationships, and that the gospel message should first begin with that in general, not in every situation, but the way God seems to be working in our culture.
[time=1163] Having built a trust-filled relationship, we have given now the environment in which the seeker can ask the dangerous questions, the questions about God, the questions about sin, the questions about suffering, the questions about salvation and hell.
[time=1179] And we propose that in the basis of that relationship, we allow God's Word, which we really don't need to defend, but rather like a lion, we just need to let it out of its cage.
[time=1190] It is alive, it is active, it is powerful, and it is the very instrument through which God can open the eyes of those who need a clear vision of the Savior.
[time=1198] And so we become proclaimers and facilitators and helpers in that context for people to discover the truth from God's Word.
[time=1206] When those and us, now the seeker shifts from someone on this side of the cross to the other side of the cross, and we are, as you know from Scripture, also called seekers, we find that our strategy includes this whole commitment to edification.
[time=1221] Christianity is not a solo sport.
[time=1224] Nowhere in the Bible do you learn that once you come to Christ, it's you and your Bible and some desert island and everything will go fine.
[time=1231] The Bible is replete with the need, the necessity, the commands for the one and others, and so we endeavor to build strong, loving, genuine, life-changing community relationships inside of our church.
[time=1243] Where iron can sharpen iron, where we confess our faults one to another and be healed, where we can love one another and cherish one another and build up one another.
[time=1251] That would be our ABF ministry and our small group ministry. And then this last little figurine over here, the unique puzzle piece with the thumbprint on it.
[time=1260] And the thumbprint represents the fact that God has created you new in Christ and you are unique, you are His masterpiece, and there is no one else with your combination of spiritual gifts, your temperament and your passion.
[time=1274] And in that uniqueness you have a place that you fit into the puzzle of the body of Christ and you help make us the wonderful tapestry that gives glory and honor to God.
[time=1288] But there is a fifth component to our vision which we take this morning and it is represented in this corporate commitment to worship.
[time=1295] It is the assembling of the saints to give glory and honor to God.
[time=1300] Let me give you four key values that we hold in our church with respect to exaltation.
[time=1306] There is a core value handout in your bulletin if you want to catch them, they are the last four, they are not numbered one, two, three, four, they are numbered whatever they are, nine, ten, eleven, twelve and thirteen I think.
[time=1316] But they come under exaltation. The first one is this, we believe that anointed teaching is the catalyst for transformation in individuals' lives and in the church.
[time=1329] We believe that the number one catalyst for change in the life of the church is none other than the word of God.
[time=1337] That is true in our, as I said, in our establishing relationships with unbelievers, that is true in our edification, that is true in our equipping.
[time=1348] But we hold it for the highest place.
[time=1352] It is true when we meet together to give glory and honor and exaltation to God.
[time=1357] This church was founded and remains to this day completely and totally committed to the inerrancy of Scripture.
[time=1363] And because it is the inspired word of God, it is authoritative to us in every practice of life and godliness for the here and the hereafter.
[time=1374] We believe that anointed teaching is the catalyst.
[time=1377] It is alive for transformation in individuals' lives and the church.
[time=1381] The next core value is this.
[time=1383] I think number nine in your bulletin, we believe that the church should be culturally relevant while remaining doctrinally pure.
[time=1391] We believe that by the example of Jesus Christ himself, who got really relevant when he chose to leave the presence of his heavenly father and take the form of human flesh.
[time=1402] How much more relevant could he be in this cross-cultural missionary endeavor?
[time=1407] The incarnation itself proclaims the commitment of God to be relevant to the people to whom he is seeking to establish a relationship.
[time=1415] Jesus, not only in the incarnation, but in his teaching.
[time=1418] He did not use out-moded, outdated ways of trying to give spiritual truth.
[time=1423] He grabbed a child, he looked at the field, he held up a kernel of grain, all in an agrarian community, all in a patriarchal system that his illustrations couldn't have been any more relevant.
[time=1436] He strove and rather found it very natural to communicate in powerfully relevant terms, and yet always remaining doctrinally pure.
[time=1451] Core value number ten, we believe that excellence honors God and inspires people.
[time=1455] Colossians 3.17 calls us to do everything.
[time=1458] You know, whatever you do, do all in the name of the Lord, and the name of the Lord is that part of God that we give glory and honor to.
[time=1467] It's the representation of all that he is.
[time=1469] And so whether we are at work or whether we are loving our lives or raising our kids or preparing to run a worship service, we believe that excellence, we will give him the best that we can possibly give him.
[time=1481] We will work and strive, we will prune and hone, we will exclude and include, we will do whatever we have to do to give excellence to God.
[time=1495] Number eleven, we believe that the pursuit of full devotion to Christ and his cause is normal for every believer.
[time=1503] We categorically reject the notion that there is an acceptable way of living the Christian life called the carnal, called fleshly, called no growth, called stagnant.
[time=1514] I'm saved and I've been saved for ten years, but you'd never know it.
[time=1518] You'd never know it because I don't grow, I don't study the Word of God, I don't exalt, I don't know my spiritual gifts, I'm not involved in life changing, transforming community.
[time=1526] I don't seek relationship with unsafe people, you know what, I live just like I'd never come to Christ, but I'm saved.
[time=1533] We say not according to the Scriptures.
[time=1537] The Scriptures teach us and therefore we believe that the pursuit of full devotion to Christ and his cause is normative.
[time=1545] It is the average, it is how all of us, it is how Christians typically move.
[time=1551] Okay, that I hope provides some bit of a basis for what we're going to say.
[time=1557] Back to John 4 now, the Samaritan woman.
[time=1561] The Samaritan woman perceives that Jesus is a prophet in verse 19 of chapter 4, the woman said to him, "Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet."
[time=1569] Our fathers, now here she pops the question, our fathers worshiped in this mountain and you people say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.
[time=1577] Jesus said to her, "Woman, believe me, an hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem shall you worship the Father."
[time=1587] He means by that there is coming an end to all this Old Testament ritual, the prescribed way, the prescribed place, the prescribed time with the festivals and the feasts.
[time=1597] Verse 22, "You worship that which you do not know, we worship that which we know for salvation is from the Jews."
[time=1606] But an hour is coming and now is, here it comes, "When the true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth, for such people the Father seeks to be his worshipers, God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship him in spirit and truth."
[time=1627] The mountain to which she refers is Gerism. It is the place where some significant Old Testament events had occurred.
[time=1634] And because the Jews would not allow the Samaritans the half-breeds to worship at Jerusalem, they had to find the next best place and so they chose Mount Gerism.
[time=1643] And they did it from their heart. They did it with intensity. They were in that sense God honoring.
[time=1651] They were fully devoted in their heart to try to get the thing done right.
[time=1655] But it was problematic because they couldn't worship where they were supposed to worship.
[time=1663] Mount Gerism was not an authorized place of worship by God.
[time=1667] And so they tried to do it from their heart, but they couldn't do it in truth because the only right way, or the truthful way, was down in Jerusalem.
[time=1673] And furthermore, these Samaritans had rejected major categories of Old Testament truth, some of the prophecies, some of the prophetic books, et cetera, et cetera.
[time=1681] So, you know, it was like, "Hey, there's part of what you're doing which is great." The Gerism thing refers to the spirit, worship and spirit and truth.
[time=1690] You guys at least are trying and you're trying from your heart.
[time=1694] The problem with the Jewish religious worship down in Jerusalem was that it was dead, orthodoxy.
[time=1699] They had the right place. They had the right seasons. They had the right times. They had all of the Old Testament.
[time=1704] I mean, they were Orthodox in that sense, but they were dead in their hearts. They had no spirit.
[time=1712] And so this woman provides the occasion for Christ to establish the priorities of what constitutes true worship.
[time=1720] And he says, "True worship is not about a place or a time. True worship is when you worship the Father in spirit and in truth."
[time=1727] And so I will take his as my outline. I want to speak for the rest of the moments here this morning about three things.
[time=1735] What is worship? What is worship in spirit and what is worship in truth? Okay? So begin with worship. What is worship?
[time=1742] Worship is when you bow down or prostrate or adore or submit, surrender, serve, obey and sacrificial in all of those categories.
[time=1755] Worship is almost defies being put into a sentence. You almost have to list off its components.
[time=1761] It is bowing down, prostrating, adoring, submitting, surrendering, serving, obeying and all of that done with personal sacrifice.
[time=1768] You do that at your own expense for the glory of God.
[time=1772] It is what Paul said in Romans 12, "I urge you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies."
[time=1778] Now what? A living and holy sacrifice acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship.
[time=1785] Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what the will of God is and what is good and acceptable and perfect.
[time=1795] Worship is giving all that you are to God. It is first of all a way of life.
[time=1802] The Greek terms for worship are "proskanao" and "lutreo." And I don't have time this morning to give you a detailed involvement in these texts.
[time=1810] Let me survey them for you. If you run around the New Testament and find the worship words and what they're connected to, you will find that worship is first and foremost.
[time=1817] Not something we do here as a corporate body. It is the way you live. It is a way of life.
[time=1822] In Romans 14, you worship God when you treat the weaker brother as he ought to be treated.
[time=1827] In Romans 15, you worship God when you evangelize. In Philippians 4, you worship God when you give your financial resources to help those in need.
[time=1836] In Ephesians 5, you worship God when you walk with him in goodness and rightness and truthfulness.
[time=1842] In 1 Timothy 2, you worship God in your response to the governing authorities. In Hebrews 13, you worship God when you give thanks and praise of your lips.
[time=1851] You see, worship is not this place in and of itself. Worship is first and foremost an issue of bowing down, submitting your life, surrendering all that you are and all that you have to serve an obedience, a loving God, and do it from a heart of sacrifice.
[time=1867] It happens on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday. It happens at work. It happens at night. It happens in recreation. It happens with your kids.
[time=1873] You worship God because you submit to him every area of your life.
[time=1879] And in the midst of those things, there are no special paraphernalia that say you're worshiping. You don't need a special cop or a rosary bead or even your Bible.
[time=1889] You don't need anything. It just infuses everything that you do because everything that you do is to worship the true and living God.
[time=1898] That's worship. It's a way of life.
[time=1902] But secondly, the Bible talks about worship as having a corporate expression. That's the kind of stuff being referred to in John chapter 4.
[time=1909] And that corporate expression is when we join. It is the joining of God's people together to collectively sing and give him praise and resubmit to the preaching of his word.
[time=1923] In other words, we worship him as a way of life independently as we are finding our way through the week.
[time=1931] And then when we come together, we corporately give him all that we are and frankly all that we're not.
[time=1937] And it's here that we sing his praises. We reaffirm the truth of who he is.
[time=1942] And we do that as a corporate body to find the blessings of doing it as a group. John Horness says it this way.
[time=1949] For us, to offer genuine response to the wonder we feel about God, our hearts must already be full of the awareness of who he is and what he has done.
[time=1960] For us to come to worship services prepared to participate and contribute to the one we love, our minds must already be filled with something to offer.
[time=1969] The person who comes to worship service on Sunday, who has not been present with God all week, whose heart is out of practice when it comes to worship,
[time=1979] finds it all too easy to continue their same disconnectedness in the service.
[time=1985] On the other hand, the person whose mind is full of fresh images of the Word of God, whose heart is filled with longings each day to live for Christ,
[time=1993] and who has daily found reasons to express to God their worship and thanksgiving, that person will find their step from there into times of corporate worship a very small step indeed.
[time=2007] It is corporate worship is the natural overflow that happens in your heart as a response to living moment by moment with the presence of God throughout your week.
[time=2018] And it comes so naturally because you are so in love with God. You are so amazed at who he is.
[time=2027] C.S. Lewis, as you know, started a skeptic. He started out a Rejector of Christ. He became a seeker and eventually became a devout believer.
[time=2036] One of the reasons that he found himself in the skeptic's camp was this notion of worshiping God.
[time=2043] He said this in his unconverted state, "Scripture seemed to picture God as craving our worship like a vain woman who wants compliments."
[time=2053] He stayed away from God because he couldn't figure out why God would need this continual haranguing of people to tell him how great he is, like an old woman seeking compliments.
[time=2066] Then he came to Christ, and in the early musings of that he said this,
[time=2072] "I thought of praise in terms of compliment, approval, or the giving of honor.
[time=2077] I had never noticed that all enjoyment spontaneously overflows into praise.
[time=2082] The world rings with praise. Lovers praise their mistresses, readers their favorite poets, walkers praise the countryside,
[time=2090] players praise their favorite game, praise of weather, wine, dishes, actors, motors, horses, colleges, countries,
[time=2097] historical personages, children, flowers, mountains, rare stamps, rare beetles, and even sometimes politicians and scholars."
[time=2105] He said, "I had not noticed how the humblest and at the same time most balanced and capacious minds praise most,
[time=2114] while the prank misfits and malcontents praise least.
[time=2119] I had not noticed either that just as men spontaneously praise whatever they value, so they spontaneously urge us to join them in praising it.
[time=2130] Isn't she lovely? Wasn't it glorious? Don't you think that was just magnificent?"
[time=2140] He goes on, "You see the psalmist in telling everyone to praise God are doing what all men do when they speak about what they care about.
[time=2149] My whole difficulty about the praise of God depended on my denying to us what we delight to do about everything else that we value.
[time=2158] I think we delight to praise what we enjoy because praise not only expresses but completes the enjoyment.
[time=2167] It is not out of compliment that lovers keep telling one another how beautiful they are.
[time=2171] The delight is incomplete until it is expressed in praise." Do you hear what he's saying? He's saying that worship happens all over the place all the time.
[time=2184] If worship is a response to whatever you have in focus, great opportunity.
[time=2192] I love you, honey. You're a great kid. I love my job.
[time=2197] These are things that explode inside of you out of what it is you have in focus and how you feel about it.
[time=2203] And he's saying not only is that common and natural for all men everywhere, but it is not complete until you've had a chance to share it with somebody else.
[time=2210] How many times have you had a great experience in your life, totally unrelated to church or something?
[time=2215] It was just everything you'd hoped for. What was the first thing you wanted to do?
[time=2219] You wanted to run and tell your friends. You wanted to relate it to your wife, to your child, to your dad, to your mom.
[time=2227] He says that's how it works.
[time=2230] And if that is the case with lower things such as wine or motors or colleges or careers, how much more should that be?
[time=2239] When the one in focus is none other than God.
[time=2243] I had a major paradigm change in my personal life as it relates to worship a couple of years ago on Super Bowl Sunday.
[time=2253] And really the events leading up to Super Bowl Sunday. I can't remember who was even playing.
[time=2257] I think it was down in San Diego. It was a couple years ago, last year, two years ago. I can't remember.
[time=2261] The point is there was so much hype. There was so much energy.
[time=2265] There was so much time being expended. There was so much money being spent.
[time=2268] There was so much excitement for this event. And it was a Super Bowl for crying out loud.
[time=2273] But what you see there is that people love their team, and they would almost die for their team, and they cheer for their team, and they shout for their team.
[time=2281] They defend their team. They fight for their team. They'll sacrifice. They'll fly to see their team.
[time=2286] They'll spend money for their team. They'll take vacation time to go see their team. They'll dress for their team.
[time=2292] They'll undress for their team. They'll work for their team. In fact, it seems as if they live for their team.
[time=2302] Is that bad or wrong? I guess in a certain sense, I mean, if that's the highest thing you're going to worship, it's awfully sad.
[time=2308] But I don't think it's wrong in the sense. It's just revealing. It tells us, you know what, God made us to worship.
[time=2316] And if you're having trouble worshiping God, it is simply because you don't really know who He is.
[time=2324] And if you can't get to the place where you love Him, would die for Him, cheer for Him, shout for Him, scream for Him, defend Him, fight for Him, sacrifice for Him, fly to see Him.
[time=2335] Spend money on Him. It's simply because you have an impoverished view of who He really is.
[time=2342] I don't view Sunday morning as a service. I don't view this as a church service. I don't view what we're doing here as anything other than an event.
[time=2353] To me, this is an event that goes right past the Super Bowl. This is the time where we come together to celebrate the one who created us and saved us.
[time=2365] And in my opinion, it should have the energy and the enthusiasm and the call to sacrifice and commitment and the pure, uncontrived, spontaneous joy and exaltation
[time=2376] that goes so far past anything else in our life because He is so far past anything else in our life.
[time=2385] CS Lewis went on to say if we consider the unblemishing promises of reward and the staggering nature of the rewards promised in the Gospels.
[time=2394] It would seem that our Lord finds our desires not too strong but too weak.
[time=2400] We are half-hearted creatures fooling about with drink and sex and ambition when infinite joy is offered to us.
[time=2408] Like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in the slum because we cannot possibly imagine what is meant by the author of "The Holiday at the Feast."
[time=2419] We are far too easily pleased.
[time=2424] So worship is the giving of our hearts and our soul and our minds in total surrender and service of loving obedience every moment of every day to bring glory and honor to the King of Kings which crescendos by His design as the people of God gather in His house to give Him praise and adoration.
[time=2453] Wow.
[time=2458] Do you believe that?
[time=2461] I do too.
[time=2465] You know, I'm out of time.
[time=2467] I'm supposed to stop like around 9.55.
[time=2471] And I haven't got to point two yet.
[time=2475] So the question is do I try point two?
[time=2478] I've got six minutes.
[time=2482] I can't do it.
[time=2484] You know what you're going to have to do?
[time=2486] You're going to have to come back next week.
[time=2489] This series just got a week longer because you want to know what you want to do with the rest of our service this morning.
[time=2495] We want to back up and we want to respond and we'll do it this service and we'll do it next service.
[time=2500] We really want to, and the whole point was to get this whole thing out but it's just too big and there are too many important things I want to say to you about our style and about people and our services lifting their hands and about clapping.
[time=2518] And about why the band stands up instead of sits down.
[time=2524] There's just a whole lot of really, really important things that I need to say to you to help you interpret it, to help you understand it, to help you know why it's going that way.
[time=2533] And there's no way I can do it in the time it remains.
[time=2537] So you guys ready?
[time=2540] Come on up and as they're coming we're going to shift gears.
[time=2544] And they have prepared for us kind of a closing worship package this morning.
[time=2550] And everything you've heard so far bring it to bear.
[time=2555] As you know one of the things that I love about worship more than anything else is the way that the Holy Spirit powers down on my heart and my mind to surrender when I'm singing these songs.
[time=2568] I find it almost impossible to really sing these songs and not give back to him everything that I've kind of grabbed onto during the week.
[time=2578] And so as we go for it again this morning, as we lift our voices, I want to invite you to get out of anything other than a clear focus of the purpose of God with the intent of surrendering all that you are to the glory of God.
[time=2608] Well I tried to get a rush from recreation, and I tried to get a buzz from my career, but no matter how I tried, it never left me satisfied, left me wondering where am I going to go from?
[time=2637] Then the Lord showed me a way to make a difference, to invest my life in things that really last.
[time=2653] And the more I make my goal, to trust him and give him control, the more I find my emptiness is a thing of the past for the first time in my life.
[time=2672] I really feel alive, what a ride I'm on, I can't believe the adventure of the life I lead.
[time=2683] It's amazing how my Lord provides the kind of thrills that fulfill me, deep inside.
[time=2697] Well we've all had good times and in disappointment.
[time=2705] There's a rush you feel, then it fades away.
[time=2712] But this thrill hasn't lost its shine, 'cause it's a more substantial kind, and I believe it's gonna stand the test of time.
[time=2726] What a ride I'm on, I can't believe the adventure of the life I lead.
[time=2734] It's amazing how my Lord provides the kind of thrills that fulfill me, deep inside.
[time=2764] Well for the first time in my life, I really feel alive, what a ride I'm on, I can't believe the adventure of the life I lead.
[time=2793] It's amazing how my Lord provides the kind of thrills that fulfill me, what a ride I'm on, I can't believe the adventure of the life I lead.
[time=2823] It's amazing how my Lord provides the kind of thrills that fulfill me, what a ride.
[time=2841] Before we go into our last worship package, we just wanted to share with you as a worship team a little bit more of a personal note.
[time=2848] Each and every week you see us up here on stage leading in worship and don't have the opportunity to get to always know us and share a little of our hearts with you.
[time=2858] Every week we meet, different rehearsals on Tuesday night, Wednesday night, sometimes on Monday night, and then finally on Sunday morning we start getting here at 7 o'clock and putting all the pieces together and present to the worship.
[time=2872] And as we prepare ourselves, we always pray along the process and let me go back a second, say the process starts many, many weeks before.
[time=2882] There are many, many preparations before we study over what Russ is going to be speaking on, we study the scripture that he has, we pray about what the Lord would have us to share with you as a congregation.
[time=2894] We take this very, very seriously, this is my life is poured into this place and many of these people pour their lives into this ministry.
[time=2904] And so that's why we want to share this morning.
[time=2906] But as we prepare all the weeks ahead and even the week ahead, all the rehearsals, first of all we pray that God would work through us first.
[time=2915] As Russ will share, we need to know who God is so that we can convey that and lead you in worship.
[time=2921] And then we ask God to work through us as his servants.
[time=2925] We're not up here to entertain, we're not here to present a show.
[time=2929] This is serious business, we're here to lead you into the holy of holies and we take our business very seriously here.
[time=2935] So what we would like to do is just have a couple members that don't often get to share verbally, come forward and share a little bit of their life testimony as well as what the worship means to them.
[time=2947] So first we're going to have Marilyn Wong and then we're going to have Doug Cox and then Gary Kans.
[time=2955] I am so happy and so thankful that I can stand here and say that I was born and raised in a Christian home.
[time=2962] My parents loved the Lord and they had a relationship with the Lord, it wasn't religion.
[time=2968] And they lived the life and walked the walk and I saw their example all through my life.
[time=2974] And I was blessed and had grandparents who loved the Lord, uncles and aunts that loved the Lord.
[time=2980] A lot of my relatives were missionaries and pastors and then I met my husband Kurt and I could tell the same story with his family.
[time=2989] I feel so blessed, I've been surrounded by people that love the Lord all my life.
[time=2995] But even as a small child I realized that I couldn't go to heaven just because my parents were going to heaven.
[time=3003] I realized that it had to be a commitment I made on my own.
[time=3008] So when I was seven years of age, in our little missionary church in Hicksville, Ohio, I walked down that aisle and I knelt.
[time=3017] And I asked Jesus to forgive me for my sins and to come into my heart and be my Savior.
[time=3022] And I have always throughout my life felt the presence of God in my life, wherever I went.
[time=3028] God was a reality to me. It was like He was standing right next to me.
[time=3032] Whatever I did, wherever I went, I knew He was there.
[time=3036] And I really feel because of that, God kept me from giving in to sin and to temptation.
[time=3043] And as a result, I know I have been spared from a lot of grief and heartache as a result of that.
[time=3050] I've enjoyed down through the years sharing my faith and my love for the Lord through music.
[time=3056] From the first time my sister, Marsha, and I sang a duet together in our little missionary church at the age of five,
[time=3063] I've enjoyed sharing God through music.
[time=3067] I've been in choirs and groups, solos, and even in choir practice.
[time=3072] Here, there have been many times tears well up in my eyes when I think about what God's done for me and what those words say in that music.
[time=3080] And I'm just so blessed to be a part of this ministry.
[time=3085] And even together, as we sing, as a body and as a church, and we sing songs like Jesus, what a beautiful name and precious Lamb of God.
[time=3094] So many times I think how wonderful it's going to be when we can sing those songs to our Father face to face.
[time=3101] That is going to be a wonderful day.
[time=3104] And I just thank the Lord that I can be a part of His ministry.
[time=3113] I'm done.
[time=3116] I came to the Lord.
[time=3118] I started coming here in 1991 to feel things out.
[time=3124] I had gone through a pretty rough divorce and there were a lot of things going on and I was pretty mixed up and I was trying to take care of things but in the wrong way.
[time=3133] So I started a friend suggested I go to the divorce recovery program they had here and that's what I did.
[time=3140] And that's the first time I'd ever felt the Lord truly coming into my heart through this.
[time=3145] So I started to come to church here.
[time=3147] Nervous as heck coming to church here.
[time=3149] I'd sit way in the back and I'd listen.
[time=3151] I wanted to feel things out.
[time=3154] Then one day I decided, Russ turned me on to this because of his vulnerability and his admission of his struggles up here.
[time=3163] And I felt really, really accepting of that and I felt that's what I need to do.
[time=3169] I came forward, talked to some elders, thought about it and about two days later I went to Russ's office and I prayed to receive Christ there.
[time=3179] And definitely my life has never been the same since.
[time=3184] It's a ride that's for sure.
[time=3185] You go on a ride in the Christian life too.
[time=3190] And then I felt a need after I was saved.
[time=3192] I thought well you know I'm a musician.
[time=3194] I felt that I should be maybe contributing something since the Lord blessed me with some abilities.
[time=3200] I thought it would be good to give back to the Lord.
[time=3202] So I joined the orchestra and played in there for a while and I really, really enjoyed it.
[time=3207] And I just really got into this whole thing.
[time=3213] It's hard to put into words for me but I've played a lot of places.
[time=3220] I played a lot of CD places as a musician, bars, whole in the walls, you know.
[time=3225] Different places like that were that's full of sinners and actually I still do that.
[time=3230] But I have a whole different perception on it now.
[time=3235] It's very humbling.
[time=3236] Christ was in those places when he was here on earth.
[time=3241] He didn't hang around with just the Christians.
[time=3243] He was there where the people were in the bottom.
[time=3245] That's where he was.
[time=3247] And I feel like we as a church need to do that.
[time=3250] To be with the unsaved.
[time=3252] To bring them to Christ in any way we can.
[time=3256] My ministering of music here and what I just did up there.
[time=3261] A lot of people may criticize and a lot of people may not like it but the Lord created us differently.
[time=3267] Every person is different.
[time=3269] Every personality out there is different.
[time=3271] And there are many different styles of music to play to praise the Lord.
[time=3275] Whether it's something very reverent as a hymn or an uptempo contemporary jazz thing.
[time=3281] I think as long as your heart is focused on the Lord and you're doing it for him and you keep that in mind.
[time=3287] He's going to receive that and it's going to be music to his ears.
[time=3292] Over the years I've played for some pretty top real good musicians and under some good band leaders and even a few celebrities.
[time=3299] But to come up here today and to play before God, he's the top musician.
[time=3305] He's the greatest conductor and he is the celebrity of celebrities.
[time=3311] Jesus Christ the King. Amen.
[time=3314] [AMEN]
[time=3323] Cool.
[time=3325] I'm choked up Doug.
[time=3328] There's not much more to say after that.
[time=3331] I'm Gary Kance.
[time=3334] Many of you have seen me up here for a lot of years.
[time=3337] I've been playing the trumpet for over 35 years now.
[time=3340] Of course I started taking lessons when I was two.
[time=3344] But all during that time I was saved when I was in junior high school.
[time=3352] But I really didn't pay much attention to what God would have me do with the talent and the skills I was developing.
[time=3360] I got lots of advice about what a trumpet player should do when he's playing in church.
[time=3366] Don't play too loud and don't play those chords. Don't play those rhythms.
[time=3372] But just recently, in my heart kind of went against that, it just didn't seem right.
[time=3378] And recently I decided to study what the scripture has to say about music in the church.
[time=3384] There are 51 references to music and musicians in 17 books of the Bible.
[time=3390] And there are no instructions, at least as I read it, no instructions limiting music in the church to a certain volume level,
[time=3399] to only certain rhythm patterns or chords, or about only playing music that is at least 25 years old or more.
[time=3407] In fact, if you want to follow along, I have some references here in Psalms 33-3.
[time=3414] It says sing to him a new song.
[time=3417] Play skillfully and shout for joy.
[time=3421] 98, 4 through 6 says shout for joy to the Lord, all the earth.
[time=3427] Burst into jubilant song with music.
[time=3431] Make music to the Lord with the harp, with the harp and the sound of singing, with trumpets and the blast, blast of the ram's horn.
[time=3441] Shout for joy before the Lord the king.
[time=3445] Psalms 149-3 through 4 says, "Let them praise his name with dancing."
[time=3451] I looked again, it does say dancing, "And make music to him with tambourine and harp for the Lord delights in his people."
[time=3460] [AMEN] 2 Chronicles 5-12.
[time=3467] All the Levites who were musicians, Asaph, Heman, to Duthan and their sons and relatives, stood on the east side of the altar.
[time=3475] That's where we stand over here.
[time=3480] Dressed in fine linen and plain symbols, harps and liars.
[time=3484] They were accompanied by 120 priests sounding trumpets.
[time=3489] Can you imagine 120 rustles and kelly sounding trumpets?
[time=3494] That would be a big sound.
[time=3497] The trumpeters and singers joined in unison as with one voice to give praise and thanks to the Lord.
[time=3503] Accompanied by trumpets, symbols and other instruments, they raised their voices and praised to the Lord in saying,
[time=3509] "He is good, his love endures forever." And the last verse I'd like to cite, 2 Chronicles 23-13 says, "And all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets and singers with instruments were leading the praises."
[time=3528] I thank God today that he's allowed me the blessing and the honor to stand up here and praise him with the skill and talent he's given me.
[time=3538] Thank you.
