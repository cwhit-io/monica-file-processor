[time=30] You know, when things get a little testy, when things get a little dicey inside the church,
[time=46] you're saying leaders here are the three things you have got to do.
[time=51] In the same text, he is going to say to the congregation, and here are two things I need you to do with respect to your leaders.
[time=58] And so there's this communication of probably one of the most vital and necessary links in any organization, you got how the leaders are going to lead and how the followers are going to follow.
[time=73] Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=77] Thank you for joining us.
[time=78] We trust that the music and message from God's word will help you in your Christian walk.
[time=83] We stay tuned, now let's join our service.
[time=94] Let everything that has the praise of Lord, and let the living proclaim, let everything
[time=108] that has the praise of Lord, let everything that has the praise, let everything that has
[time=121] the praise, let everything that has the praise of Lord, let everything that has the praise
[time=148] of Lord, let the living proclaim, let everything that has the praise, praise the Lord.
[time=162] Let everything that has the praise, let everything that has the praise, let everything that
[time=180] has the praise, let everything that has the praise, let everything that has the praise
[time=221] everything that has the praise, let everything that has the praise, let everything that
[time=241] has the praise, let everything that has the praise, let everything that has the praise
[time=264] of Lord, let everything that has the praise, let everything that has the praise, let everything
[time=288] that has the praise, let everything that has the praise, let everything that has the
[time=377] of Lord, let everything that has the praise, let everything that has the praise, let
[time=398] everything that has the praise, let everything that has the praise, let everything that
[time=414] has the praise, let everything that has the praise, let everything that has the praise
[time=456] everything that has the praise, let everything that has the praise, let everything that
[time=480] has the praise, let everything that has the praise, let everything that has the praise
[time=518] everything that has the praise, let everything that has the praise, let everything that
[time=537] has the praise, let everything that has the praise, let everything that has the praise
[time=579] everything that has the praise, let everything that has the praise, let everything that
[time=598] have the praise, let everything that has the praise, let everything that has the praise
[time=625] of Lord, let everything that has the praise, let everything that has the praise, let everything
[time=652] come here from ritual or routine, we come here because we are forever grateful to a
[time=658] God who would die on the cross to save us from our sins, thank you, we pray these things
[time=667] in Christ's name, amen, you may be seated.
[time=697] Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you
[time=1562] I am always caring about in my body the dying of Jesus, that the life of Jesus also may be
[time=1570] manifested in our body and there is the tension. You know what? I carry in my heart the true and living gospel and as a leader I give it out, he is saying, but the extent to which,
[time=1581] I mean the trials and the sufferings, the physical exhaustion that you go through to be able to give the life message kills you. So you're caring about in the body the dying of Jesus that the life of Jesus may be manifested. In 2 Corinthians 11 he says, he tells of his
[time=1596] lashes, he'd been whipped more times than he could count. The beating with rods, the stonings he'd undergone, the shipwrecks he'd endured. He tells about the dangers, dangers in rivers, dangers in robbers, dangers from countrymen, his own fellow Jews, you know, wanted to kill him, dangers from gentiles, dangers in the city, dangers in the woods.
[time=1614] I mean it reads like a chapter out of the life of Indiana Jones. I mean you just, I mean his experience must have been phenomenal. He says also in 2 Corinthians 11 that he was
[time=1625] full of labor and hardship and sleepless nights and hunger and thirst and exposure to cold. It has been said and rightly so, the world is run by tired men. The world is
[time=1639] run by tired men. And in this case, the Apostle Paul and elders of a local church are driven.
[time=1648] They are driven by what we see Paul describing, Colossians 128 when he says that I may present every man complete in Christ. You see, Paul couldn't stop and he couldn't rest and he couldn't quit and he couldn't take a detour and he couldn't take a break until all who are under his charge were complete in Christ. And you and I both know that was never going to happen until the rapture. He cries out in Romans chapter 1 verse 11, "For I longed
[time=1670] to see you speaking of the Romans and he'd never yet been to Rome and he was dying to get there." Why? Because it was a little group of believers there. He cries out, "I'm longing to see you in order that I may impart some spiritual gift to you that you may be established." And the word "established" means fully grounded, fully rooted, fully grown, fully mature, standing strong in Christ. And he said, "I can hardly wait to get to your town because I've got some spiritual gifts that I want to give to you." Speaking of course of his preaching and his teaching ministry, his discipling ministry, and he said, "Man, I'm longing to get there so that you can get out of spiritual infancy and into spiritual adulthood." And it was destroying his body. It was literally and regularly exhausting
[time=1712] him to the place of exhaustion. And that's the physical side. But staying with this kind
[time=1720] of double nuance of the word, the mental components that you see him struggling with are amazing.
[time=1724] And 2 Corinthians 11, he says, "You know, that's the external stuff." He just described all that stuff. They had me with his body. He says, "But apart from such external things, there is the daily pressure upon me of concern for all the churches." And now he's talking about his heart and his mind and his emotional concern for the well-being of all these churches.
[time=1743] The mental, emotional workload must have been enormous for him. And it's that way always
[time=1749] for spiritual leaders. Remember when James and John were hanging around the Lord saying, "Hey, how about we get a little better place in the kingdom? Can we be leaders? Can we have a place of priority?" And Jesus looks back at him and Mark 10 and says, "Are you able to drink the cup that I drink or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am
[time=1767] going to be baptized?" In other words, are you sure? You want to step into this role?
[time=1775] You read the life of Paul, a couple of the emotional mental stress points just kind of pop up at you. The first one is loneliness. Paul was an incredibly lonely individual.
[time=1786] Human nature craves company. And it is only natural to wish to share with others the heavy burdens and responsibilities of care for the church. But for Paul, it was a continual
[time=1797] heartbreaking exercise to have to make decisions of far-reaching importance that affected the lives of people he loved all by himself. It was one of the heaviest prices he had to pay. It was the same price he saw Moses pay in the Old Testament. And so here you had
[time=1812] the gregarious Paul, vivacious, energetic, alive, but he was a lonely man who experienced
[time=1818] the full, the bitterness of misunderstanding by his contemporaries, misrepresentation by his enemies, and desertion by converts and even his friends. How poignant is his word
[time=1829] to Timothy and 2 Timothy 1 when he cries out, "You are aware, Timothy, of the fact that all who are in Asia have turned away from me." A.W. Tozer wrote this, "Most of
[time=1842] the world's great souls have been lonely." The leader must be a man who, while welcoming
[time=1850] the friendship and support of all who can offer it, has sufficient inner resources to stand alone, even in the face of fierce opposition in the discharge of his responsibilities.
[time=1862] He must be prepared to live, as Paul said, with no one but God. The other thing you see
[time=1870] over and over and over again in his life and ministry was criticism. One person who said
[time=1877] this, "There is nothing else that so kills the efficiency, capability, and initiative of a leader as destructive criticism." Its destructive effect cannot be underestimated.
[time=1888] It tends to hamper and undercut the efficiency of a man's thinking process. It chips away at his self-respect. It undermines his confidence and his ability to cope with his responsibilities.
[time=1899] So Paul sets the valuable pattern for elders in this regard. It was his ambition to secure not the favor of men, but the favor of God. He says in Galatians 1, "Am I now seeking
[time=1910] the favor of men or of God? Or am I striving to please men?" Because Paul had long since
[time=1916] learned that was a futile course, an empty pursuit, the wrong goal, that is to try to
[time=1924] please men. It was for him to please God and God alone. In 1 Corinthians 4 he says this,
[time=1930] "To me it is a very small thing that I should be examined by you, or by any human court.
[time=1937] The one who examines me is the Lord. He knew. He knew who he worked for. He knew who he was taking his cues from, and he knew who he had to please." And it was his God, not the people. But they criticized him. They went after him at every turn. They attacked
[time=1955] his apostleship. They attacked his doctrine. They attacked his methods, and they attacked
[time=1963] his motives. Like wayward sheep, they would naturally drift from the truth. They would
[time=1972] lose their perspective and their God-given priorities. And though they were full of criticism and
[time=1978] he was all by himself most of the time, he would continue to initiate, he would continue to plan, continue to pray and preach because that's what leaders do. They exhaust themselves
[time=1992] and the care and concern, the growth and the development of the flock of God. The second
[time=2000] thing you'll see in his charge as to what elders are supposed to do is also found in verse 12, and it is this, when it gets dicey, when it gets difficult, and in fact as a constant
[time=2010] state of affairs, the elders need to take charge. Look at verse 12, "But we request
[time=2016] of you, brethren, that you appreciate those who diligently labor among you," and here it is, "have charge over you in the Lord and give you instruction." Elders are called
[time=2026] to lead. Elders are called to paint a preferable future, to elevate the hopes and dreams and
[time=2032] potential of the ones they've been called to lead, to do vision casting in ways that invoke others to say, "Yeah, I'll throw my hat in that ring. That's the kind of church I want to be a part of." And then break that vision down for them and bite-sized pieces so that each and every person there can understand the part that they can play in the advancing of the kingdom of God. They say, "Let's do great things together." And they are constantly
[time=2058] assessing what is going on in the hearts and souls of their people. They are constantly asking, "Are they maturing and growing, or are they stuck? Are the hearts of our people hot for the Lord, or are they rather cold and indifferent? Have our people been grounded in the things of the Word of God? Are they engaged in genuine heartfelt worship? Are they experiencing the power and help of soul to soul, life transforming biblical community?
[time=2084] Are they ministering their spiritual gifts? Elders are called to take charge of the flock.
[time=2091] In 1 Timothy 5, he says to give double honor to those who rule well among you, especially
[time=2097] those in the teaching capacity. In Hebrews 13, he calls the elders to lead. That is their
[time=2105] job. That is what they do. Interesting footnote here, you can never find anywhere in either
[time=2112] the Old Testament or the New Testament where God asks his elders to try to execute the
[time=2120] will of the people. He never puts leaders in place and then says to the leaders, "Now,
[time=2127] go out among the people and find out what they want, and then take the church in the direction they want you to take it." He never sent Moses to the people of God and say, "Hey,
[time=2138] Moses," or Moses rather saying to the people of Israel out there in the wilderness, "Hey, guys, where should we go today?" The consistent ongoing call to the leadership has always been
[time=2150] leaders. You look to me for where this church is supposed to go or for where the nation of Israel is supposed to go. And thankfully, in the New Testament, we don't have to wait on a pillar of fire or wait for God to speak on a mountain somewhere. He has put it all right here. And the call upon biblical leadership in the church is to be so absorbed and so knowledgeable and so thoroughly convinced and satisfied in their hearts that they understand what God has said about the church. And with that grin in their mind then, they do the shepherding thing and they groom the sheep and they inspect the sheep and they know exactly the condition of the sheep, but that does not determine the direction of the church. That is only the information now by which they pull from the Word of God more specific ointments and application to heal the herding flock. But they never look to the people of the church for the direction of the church. They always look to God for that. It is not mob rule in
[time=2202] the church. It is not group consensus. It is not, let's take a vote. It is not wet your finger and stick it into the political air and find out which would be the most practical solution to this problem. It is not an opinion poll and like Moses, the New Testament elders are called to follow God and to lead the people where God has said to go. A little difficult
[time=2223] for Americans to get a hold of because we even erroneously think about our Constitution in such a way that we elect these guys and then they are supposed to go do what we tell them to do when in reality we are supposed to elect these guys so that they can submit the country to the law established in the Constitution. But we don't get that. And so
[time=2242] we see example in modeling all the time of leaders doing this and then that gets called good leadership. That is not good leadership. That is politics. It would be a good leader especially in the church. You submit the direction of your heart, your life and the calling of the church to the direction that God has called the church to go not the whim, desire, preference
[time=2262] or anything else of the people. Now there is a dynamic relationship there because the shepherd
[time=2268] is grooming and the shepherd is knowledgeable and the shepherd loves and the shepherd cares but he doesn't take his cues and he doesn't take his direction from the will of the people he takes from the will of God. First Peter 5 further explains all of this. He says there that elders are to exercise oversight and that is that same word, be in charge, be in leadership rule. Exercising oversight, wow, not under compulsion but voluntarily according
[time=2293] to what? According to the will of God, not for sordid gain but with eagerness nor yet as learning it over those allotted to your charge but proving to be examples to the flock.
[time=2302] So yeah, the elders are supposed to lead according to the will of God not the will of the people but they don't do it under compulsion and they don't do it for sordid gain and they don't do it with a learning attitude. They do it as examples to the flock. They live the life that God has called the church to live and say follow me. But they say I'm over here
[time=2321] because that's where God's called us. So elders, one, work hard, two, take charge,
[time=2329] three, give instruction and that also is in this verse, look at verse 12 again, but we request of you brother in that you appreciate those who diligently labor among you and have charge over you in the Lord and here it is. They give you instruction. This Greek word
[time=2345] is the idea of instruction with a view towards correction. It's not neutral. It's not just information. It is in response to error, instruction with a view towards correction. It has the
[time=2356] feeling of if you keep going this way you are going to have problems. It is the difficult task of speaking hard words and it falls to leaders. And Paul did it all the time. Paul
[time=2369] spoke hard truth words to Peter and the Galatians for their legalism. He spoke hard truth words
[time=2376] to the Colossians for their heresy, to Timothy for his timidity, to Philemon to receive back his wayward slave Onesimus, to the church at Corinth for their lack of love and a myriad of other problems. And he will before his life is over speak harsh, hard truth words even to this young precious Thessalonian church for their undisciplined lifestyle. Leadership
[time=2399] is constantly assessing the spiritual condition of the church that then has the boldness and
[time=2405] the love to speak and to bring truth from God's word to confront those heirs and misdirections.
[time=2414] And Paul didn't relish it. And Paul didn't enjoy it, but he did it. Paul knew that when
[time=2421] difficult truth needed to be communicated and if it wasn't communicated it was going to be destructive to the individual and to the group. And so rather than pick his place
[time=2432] of comfort and not say the hard word, he chose to love and say the hard word for the benefit of the individual and for the church. That's what elders are supposed to do. Jesus did
[time=2442] it all the time. Jesus was given to some of the most brutal, direct communication ever
[time=2448] written in print. Remember what he said to the money changers? Remember what he said to the scribes and the Pharisees and do you remember what he said often to his own followers?
[time=2459] Unbelievable. Why? Because the Lord was free from needing to impress them or have them
[time=2465] like him. He loved them more than he loved their approval. And so here it comes, the
[time=2473] truth, over and over and over again. That's why it says in Titus 1-9 to the elders, elders
[time=2479] hold fast the faithful word which is in accordance with the teaching that you may be able both
[time=2485] to exhort in sound doctrine and refute those who contradict. That's what they do. They exhort people to do what they ought to do and they refute people when they do what they shouldn't do. First Timothy 4-16, Paul says to Timothy, "Timothy, you pay close attention
[time=2498] to yourself and to your teaching." Why? Because as you do this, you will ensure salvation both for yourself and for your people. So the calling, the calling upon the life of an
[time=2512] elder, the calling upon the life of one who would lead in the church, work hard, work
[time=2519] to the point of exhaustion, it's not easy, it's difficult. Be in charge, lead, cast
[time=2526] vision, follow God in his direction for your church and be faithful to speak the hard words
[time=2533] of truth even when they may not want to be heard. Okay? Now the last couple of things
[time=2539] here are addressed to the congregation. There are two things and they kind of fall sprinkled both in verses 12 and 13. The first thing he says to them is you need to appreciate and to esteem your leadership. Look at it, verse 12, "We request of you, brother, in that you
[time=2554] appreciate those who diligently labor among you." Verse 13, "That you esteem them very highly in love because of their work." The word appreciate means to have come to know
[time=2565] them. As you have come to know their hard work, as you have come to know their willingness to lead, as you have come to know their commitment to give you instruction even when you didn't want to hear it, choose to appreciate them for that, choose to esteem them for that.
[time=2582] That's a choice you make. In Galatians 4, there's an interesting conversation going
[time=2589] on between Paul and his people and he says this, "And that which was a trial to you in
[time=2596] my bodily condition. You did not despise or loathe, but you received me as an angel
[time=2602] of God or as Jesus Christ himself." We believe that Paul had a very distracting, ugly repulsive
[time=2612] eye disease. What he is saying there is he's rejoicing over the fact that when he first
[time=2620] showed up at Galatia, the people didn't refuse him and push him away and disdain him. Instead, they appreciated him. They fell in love with him and they esteemed him even though they might have pushed him away as loathsome because of his bad eyes. We think it was eyes because
[time=2636] he says in the next verse in that text that, "You know what, you love me so much. You would have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me if you could." Let me think about that. He's saying, "Thank you. You know, thank you for loving me. Thank you for accepting me with all my faults and all my weaknesses, even those which were obvious to you every time you saw me. And instead of feeling disdain for me, thank you for that heartfelt desire.
[time=2657] You know, Paul, if I could fix this problem for you, I'd give you mine." But he says
[time=2664] in the next verse, "Have I therefore become your enemy by telling you the truth?" You
[time=2671] see, he was in the middle of confronting them for their legalism and they didn't want to hear it. And so they had gone from a place of appreciation and esteem from a place where
[time=2681] they looked past and even had sympathy for even the physical calamities of his life to where now they countered him and enemy. Why? Because he told them the truth. It's a choice,
[time=2694] my friends. There are no perfect elders. There are no perfect leaders and there are no perfect pastors. And you get to pick how you're going to respond to their hard work, to their willingness
[time=2705] to take charge and their fearless commitment to give instruction. What kind of person you
[time=2711] want to be? You know, there's two kinds of people in the world. You come across a beautiful little, you know, pasture there and there's one kind of person who looks out across that thing and it sees the little stream running through there and sees the beautiful lilies in the green grass and they say, "Wow, that's a beautiful place." It would be that kind of person or do you want to be the other kind of person who looks at the same situation and all they can see are the cow pies. And they just say, "Oh man, this is a bad place.
[time=2733] Look, it's just messy everywhere." No perfect place, no perfect elders, no perfect leaders.
[time=2741] The choice is yours. And it's the same choice the people of God have been making since the moment they have Moses. And it's basically very simple. You either line up with the negative,
[time=2752] the critical, the uncooperative, the derogatory, the recalcitrant, the stubborn and the stiff
[time=2758] neck, as they were called in the Old Testament, or you line up with the appreciative and those
[time=2764] who esteem. You esteem them, why? Because you like the personality? No. Because they minister
[time=2773] to you the Word of God. Because they feed your needy soul, because they tell you the hard truth, because they lead, they cast vision and they rule, and because they exhaust themselves
[time=2784] trying to see those purposes through to their natural end.
[time=2789] So number one, he says, in the little huddle-up session, "Hey, now listen to the congregation.
[time=2793] You guys, your job, appreciate and esteem." Job number two comes at the end of verse 13.
[time=2801] He says to them, "Secondly what I need you to do as a congregation is I need you to live in peace with one another. I need you to live in peace with one another." And this is the
[time=2810] constant call of God upon the church for unity. And it's all through the New Testament. We
[time=2817] could spend hours this morning just reading the verses where unity is called for in the church. Try Philippians 2 where it says this, "Make my joy complete." How? How would you finish that? How do you think Paul would make my joy complete? How does he finish it?
[time=2831] By being of the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one
[time=2838] purpose. In other words, follow your leaders, he is saying. In Hebrews 13 verse 17, you might
[time=2848] want to write that verse down and look at it later, Hebrews 13 17, listen, says this,
[time=2854] obey your leaders and submit to them. Obey your leaders and submit to them. Why? Because
[time=2863] they keep watch over your souls as those who will give an account. And then it adds this,
[time=2872] and let them, meaning the leader, and let the leaders do this with joy and not with grief
[time=2879] for this would be unprofitable for you. Interesting, isn't it? Why would? Why would a congregation
[time=2889] not want to obey and submit to the group of godly men who have given themselves to work to the place of exhaustion and lead and instruct in this process of keeping watch over their souls. And why would they want to be hard-hearted and stiff-necked and recalcitrant and stubborn
[time=2905] and negative so that it makes it an unjoyful experience for the leadership? Why would they
[time=2912] cause grief? Especially when the word of god says it only will be unprofitable for you if you do that. You know, the Bible uses so many different metaphors for the church. It
[time=2923] calls it a family, it calls it a bride, it calls it a vineyard, it calls it a temple, a building, a kingdom, a flock. But the number one metaphor in the New Testament for the church
[time=2934] is the body. It's the body. And the body marks the natural and truly organic spiritual unity
[time=2944] that exists inside the company of the Redeem. We have one Lord, we have one Word, we have
[time=2950] one gospel, we have one God, we have one destination. That's why Paul in Galatians 3 on the steam
[time=2959] of unity says, listen to me, there is inside the body. Now, once you come to Christ, there is neither June or Greek, there is neither bond nor free, male or female, for you are all
[time=2968] one in Christ. Do you have any idea of how inflammatory those words were to the people he spoke them to? In Paul's day, the whole world was divided by June and Greek and he
[time=2978] is saying that the vision is now forever gone inside the community of the Redeem. In Rome
[time=2984] alone, there were six million slaves. It was a caste system and you were either a slave
[time=2990] owner or you were a slave and those worlds were universes apart and there they should meet. And he says, not in the church, not when you come to Christ, there is neither bond
[time=3001] nor free. And the whole male female thing, man, males were completely gone in their utter
[time=3008] and total disrespect for the dignity and the humanity and the image bearing qualities of females. They were like animals to men. And he says, not in here, not in the church.
[time=3022] Once you come to Christ, there is neither June or Greek, bond nor free, male nor female.
[time=3026] You are all one in Christ. Whatever baggage one might carry from their
[time=3032] secular experience, they drop it at the door when they come into the body of Christ is his point. Unity, my friends, unity. That's why we are called fellow heirs and fellow members
[time=3048] of the body and fellow partakers and fellow citizens. And that's why Jesus prayed in his high priestly prayer of John 17 that they all may be one speaking of us. And he cried
[time=3059] out, listen to this, I will be in them and you God are in me that they may be made perfect
[time=3067] in one. Wow. It's an amazing thing. Think of any dynamic
[time=3079] organization anywhere that doesn't have great leadership and great fellowship. Think of
[time=3087] any great accomplishment of any group of people since the beginning of time that did not have great leadership and great fellowship. And that is where he starts. That is where
[time=3099] he says, listen, if you are going to treat each other with honor and love and dignity along this journey, hold your love for the destination and dynamic tension with the call
[time=3110] to treat each other right along the way. And that begins at the most important relationship in the church, that between the leadership and the people. So elders, we would work hard.
[time=3124] We'll be faithful to take charge. We will continue to give instruction to the best of our ability. And you, the people of Blackhawk, appreciate your elders, esteem your elders
[time=3135] and follow their lead. And when we come back in the following weeks, we'll find out what
[time=3142] else he has to say in this journey called Christianity. You know, one of the things that
[time=3149] makes this stuff so important is that it's not just about us. It's not just about us.
[time=3160] When churches relate rightly to each other, when elders lead and people follow, it creates,
[time=3167] it creates an atmosphere, it creates a place, it creates a home, it creates a house. And
[time=3173] not only do we get the bask in the wonder and the privilege of living in biblical community
[time=3179] with each other, but there are people that have yet to come through these doors, who have yet to see it happen like that, who have yet to see the wonder of that dynamic happening.
[time=3191] And it can be come to them a house of mercy. This place can become the place that people
[time=3197] trust and settle in their hearts and say, "It's right here. It resonates in my spirit."
[time=3205] And they find Christ and they begin to grow to maturity. The praise team is going to come
[time=3213] back up or a group of our folks are coming. And they're going to sing a song about this wonderful house that mercy has built. And as they sing it, I invite you to take spiritual
[time=3223] inventory in your heart, both you as leaders. You know, are you working hard enough? Are you leading strong enough? Are you instructing with honesty as you ought? And I'm asking
[time=3236] you who are in the following category, are you following? Are you following for all your worth? I mean, are you really submitting and obeying the direction that God is giving the leadership of this church? From a whole heart? And are you pursuing peace inside the
[time=3253] body? And you know, if the surface is something in your life in the midst of this song, give it to him. That'll be your offering this morning. That'll be your gift of worship for the glory of God.
[time=3265] A light in the distance welcomes those wayfaring souls come this far. A heart grows tired,
[time=3287] faith grows cold, wandering down the winding road. Just simply knock the door will open.
[time=3297] There is a house and mercy built. There is a place where brokenness is healed. There
[time=3312] is a voice saying, "Peace be still." There is a house and mercy built.
[time=3339] You've given up in the middle of what seems like nowhere. He'll shelter you beneath
[time=3350] his wings. His love will cover every need. Just simply see and you will find there is
[time=3361] a house. There is a house. There is a place where emptyness is filled. There is a voice
[time=3378] saying, "Peace be still." There is a house and mercy built. There is a house that's
[time=3391] filled. There is a house. There is a house. There is a house. There is a house. There
[time=3417] is a house. There is a place where grace has been revealed. There is a voice saying, "Peace
[time=3434] be still." There is a house. There is a house. There is a house. There is a house. There
[time=3452] is a house. Let me understand as we close our service. I hope you want to be a part
[time=3475] of building that kind of a house and do it as a light off into the distance to the folks
[time=3481] who have yet come to know Christ. Our gracious God and Heavenly Father, you are an amazing
[time=3487] and wonderful and awesome, magnanimous God. Every time we open your book, every time we
[time=3493] look into the words of life, we find ourselves getting encouraged and motivated, corrected and reproved. We go away saying, "That is it. That is the truth. God help me to live
[time=3505] it. Help me to live it for your glory." And that is, I trust why and what we feel in our
[time=3511] hearts today. God, give us mercy, give us grace, give us strength and power to be the kinds of people that give you honor and glory in every dimension of our life. We pray these
[time=3521] things in Christ's name, and all God's people say. Amen. God bless you.
