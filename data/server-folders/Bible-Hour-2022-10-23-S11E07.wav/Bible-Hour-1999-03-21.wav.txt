[time=25] But while the Scriptures give us a fair and realistic picture of the hardships, the disappointments,
[time=47] and the trials of life, they also hold out the possibility of real joy and real gratitude
[time=54] amidst this life.

[time=883] thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks,
[time=899] thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks,
[time=941] thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks, let me invite you to open your Bible this morning to first Thessalonians chapter five.
[time=947] We're studying our way through this book and we come this morning to an interesting couple of
[time=953] verses that I think will challenge our hearts and our minds this morning.
[time=960] Bus stop, Jason our youngest has two goals in life, one is to have fun, the other is to rest,
[time=972] he does both quite well, so I shouldn't have been surprised by what happened when I sent him to school one fall day. As Jason headed off for the bus, I immediately busied myself
[time=983] preparing for a full day. The knock on the door was a surprise and disruptive to my morning rhythm,
[time=989] which is not something I have a lot of. I flew to the door, jerked it open only to find myself
[time=995] looking at Jason. "What are you doing here?" I demanded. "I've quit school," he boldly announced.
[time=1003] "Quit school," I repeated in disbelief. "Why have you quit school?"
[time=1010] Without hesitation, he proclaimed, "It's too long, it's too hard, and it's too boring."
[time=1017] "Jason," I instantly retorted, "you have just described life. Go get back on that bus."
[time=1025] Jesus says in John 16, "In this world, you will have trouble."
[time=1034] Paul in Romans 8, "Even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting eagerly for the adoption of our
[time=1041] bodies." In James 1, we're told of the various trials that test our faith and produce a horrible
[time=1049] thing called endurance, which is the ability to stay under the trial longer. First Peter 1 tells us
[time=1056] that we are tested by fire. Life, sometimes it does feel too long, too hard, and too boring.
[time=1065] But while the Scriptures give us a fair and realistic picture of the hardships, the disappointments, and the trials of life, they also hold out the possibility of real joy and
[time=1077] real gratitude amidst this life. Look at chapter 5, verse 16, "Rejoice always," verse 18,
[time=1086] "and everything give thanks, for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus." How is your attitude this morning about work, about your spouse, your physical health,
[time=1099] your financial situation, your house, your friends, your enemies?
[time=1105] Are you full of joyful gratitude these days, or are you a little like our buddy Jason?
[time=1110] Have you, whether consciously or unconsciously, decided to quit? No more joy, no more gratitude.
[time=1117] My life is just too hard, too long, and too boring to find real joy and real gratitude.
[time=1124] Well, this morning, I want to invite you to hold the condition of your heart attitude up to the
[time=1130] penetrating light of the Scripture as it relates to us two of the most outrageous commands in all
[time=1137] of the Scriptures. Rejoice always, and in everything give thanks. If you want to follow along this
[time=1146] morning, I'm going to have three main points. The first will be the call to joyful gratitude, the call to joyful gratitude, then the path to joyful gratitude, and then the basis of joyful
[time=1158] gratitude. First, the call. The astounding two words in these verses are not that we should
[time=1164] rejoice or be thankful. It is the two words always and everything that caused us a moment of pause.
[time=1170] You see, I have no problem with occasional joy or occasional gratitude, but when you tell me
[time=1177] that I have to be joyful always and grateful for everything, these absolutes, they're like
[time=1184] wedding vows. You know what I mean? For richer or for poorer, they anticipate every possible circumstance of life. My heart shrinks away from that. It sounds nice. It seems impossible,
[time=1196] and my personal history tells me I've never rejoiced always and been thankful for everything.
[time=1201] Nevertheless, we need to remind ourselves that this is not an isolated teaching in the word of God.
[time=1207] Philippians 4, 4 says this, "Rejoice in the Lord always." Again, I will say rejoice. I mean,
[time=1214] as if saying it once wasn't enough. Rejoice in the Lord how often? Always. Again, I will say
[time=1220] rejoice. 1 Peter 4, 13, he says this, "But to the degree that you share the sufferings of Christ,
[time=1228] keep on rejoicing so that also at the revelation of His glory, you may rejoice with exaltation."
[time=1234] These people were suffering hardship and persecution, and Peter has the audacity to say
[time=1240] to the measure that you suffer for Christ, so you should rejoice for Christ. How long? Well, until He comes, and then your rejoicing and exaltation will be forever.
[time=1249] Romans 14, 17 says, "For the kingdom of God is not eating, and it's not drinking,
[time=1259] but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit." The very definition of what it means to be a
[time=1265] Christian, the very domain called the kingdom of God. Our joy does not come from eating and drinking primarily. It comes from the Holy Spirit as we have been entered into the kingdom of God.
[time=1275] And the same is true of gratitude. Paul says in 2 Corinthians 4, 15,
[time=1281] "The giving of thanks to abound to the glory of God." It's this rich, extravagant, super overflowing
[time=1288] giving of thanks of bounding to the glory of God. Colossians 2, 17 describes our life as
[time=1295] overflowing with gratitude to God. Colossians 3, 16, and 17 find us singing with thankfulness
[time=1303] in our hearts to God, giving thanks through or to Him through the Father. So listen,
[time=1310] listen very carefully to the kind of Christianity, the kind of life that God holds up for His children.
[time=1317] It is one of unceasing joy and unbroken thanks and gratitude.
[time=1322] The Word makes it clear there is no event or circumstance that can occur in the life of a believer
[time=1331] that should diminish that Christian's joy or gratitude. And the fact is when you and I fail to
[time=1338] rejoice always and to give thanks for everything, it is not something we happen to be remiss at.
[time=1344] God considers it sin. God considers it moral failure. God considers it what it is, a failure to live
[time=1352] the life that He has called us to live. So that then is the call to joyful gratitude. Secondly, what is the path? I mean, if that's the standard, if that's the enticement, if that's the possibility,
[time=1363] if that's the thing that God puts out there as this preferable future for the believer to grow in His ability to have a rejoicing heart always and gratitude in everything. How do we get there?
[time=1374] Well, I have to be honest with you and come back and say this, it is a choice.
[time=1383] This idea of rejoicing always and being thankful for everything is a choice. It is a choice that
[time=1389] God has given to you and to me. And I know that sounds strange because to some degree joy and
[time=1396] gratitude are emotions. And how can we choose what we will feel?
[time=1400] Fundamentally, we don't choose our emotions, but we do choose our values. And we choose our thought
[time=1410] patterns, our mental focus and our perspectives. And in so doing, we actually end up choosing our
[time=1417] emotions indirectly. Did that make sense? You and I may not be able necessarily to choose the impulse
[time=1427] reaction emotion to an event. That is true. But the Bible says that it is our job to choose
[time=1435] our emotions by choosing our values and having chosen what is important to us and then secondarily
[time=1441] choosing how we will think about our lives, the mental focus that we will give, the perspectives,
[time=1447] the lenses through which we will look at the events, the people and the circumstances of our life.
[time=1452] We indirectly end up choosing our responsive emotions because they are responders to our values
[time=1458] and they are responders to our perspectives. The Bible reveals, and so does an observation
[time=1467] of the world. The world is divided up into two basic kinds of people. There are reactive people
[time=1473] and then there are proactive people. And in fact, there are more than people. They are modes and
[time=1480] any one given individual may be in a reactive mode at that given point or we may switch to a
[time=1486] proactive mode. Let me talk about the reactive mode of life. In the reactive mode, we are driven
[time=1493] by our feelings, by our circumstances and by our environment. In the reactive mode, whether by
[time=1499] conscious decision or by default, we actually empower the feelings and circumstances or conditions
[time=1506] of our life to take control of us. For example, in the reactive mode, if the weather is good,
[time=1513] we feel good. If the weather is bad, we feel bad. In the reactive mode, when people treat us well,
[time=1520] then we feel well. When people don't, then we become defensive and protective.
[time=1526] It is as if we build our emotional lives around the behavior of others,
[time=1532] empowering the weaknesses of other people to control our emotional well-being.
[time=1537] In the reactive mode, we say things like, "That's me. That's just the way I am." In other words,
[time=1544] there's nothing I can do about me or he makes me so mad. What's the person saying? My emotional
[time=1554] life is governed by another human being. He makes me so mad. If only my wife were more patient. In
[time=1564] other words, someone else's behavior is limiting, controlling my effectiveness and my feelings.
[time=1574] I had to do it, or I have to do it. In other words, circumstances or other people are forcing
[time=1581] me to do what I would not otherwise do. I'm not really free to choose my course,
[time=1587] my actions, my values, my perspectives, and my consequent emotions.
[time=1592] This is the language of the reactive mood. I am not responsible. I am not able to choose my responses.
[time=1602] While in the reactive mode, we focus on the weaknesses of other people.
[time=1606] We focus on the problems in our environment and our circumstances over which we have no control.
[time=1612] And this focus fosters in us a blaming and accusing attitude, an increased feelings of
[time=1622] victimization and the utter loss of joy and gratitude. We basically hand these things away
[time=1628] on a silver platter. As we claim that we are not responsible, we are not in control of our values,
[time=1636] our perspectives, and their consequent emotions.
[time=1640] In the reactive mode, the two words, if only, become our trademark. I'd be happy if only
[time=1648] my house was paid off. If only I had a boss that wasn't such a dictator.
[time=1655] If only I had a more patient husband. I'd be happy if only my child was more obedient. I
[time=1661] could be happy if only my degree were completed. If only I had more time to myself.
[time=1666] This is a weak way of living. This is nothing to do with the freedom that Christ promises us in
[time=1676] salvation. You say, "What does the proactive mode look like?" In the proactive mode,
[time=1684] we are not driven by our feelings, we are not driven by our circumstances, and we are not driven by our environment. We are driven by values, carefully scrutinized, selected, and then internalized
[time=1697] values, the things that really matter to us. In the proactive mode, we recognize and exercise
[time=1704] our ability to choose our responses. The ability to subordinate an impulse to a value, say it again,
[time=1711] the ability to subordinate an impulsive emotion to a critically chosen value is the
[time=1717] essence of who Christ would have us to be. We proactively say it is not what happens to me,
[time=1724] but my response to what happens to me that defines who I am and how I will feel.
[time=1730] We acknowledge that things can hurt us both physically and circumstantially, even relationally, but our character, our basic identity does not have to be heard at all.
[time=1741] In fact, we recognize that we can choose to allow even the most difficult experiences of our lives
[time=1748] to become the very circumstances that forge our character and strengthen our inner man
[time=1754] to increase and expand our ability to choose our values, to change our perspectives,
[time=1760] and the consequent emotional reaction to them. We are unstoppable.
[time=1769] We are invincible. We are responsible.
[time=1774] In other words, what matters most to us is not what happens to us,
[time=1783] but how we respond to what happens to us. We get to decide within ourselves how the experiences
[time=1795] in our lives are going to affect us. In fact, it is in that space between what happens to us
[time=1804] and how we choose to respond to it that we exercise our most prized freedom. It's sacred
[time=1812] ground for the believer. We cherish it, we nurture it, we cultivate it, and we protect it.
[time=1820] We refuse to give our emotional well-being away for circumstances, experiences, and people to alter.
[time=1828] Let me give you some examples of proactive believers.
[time=1835] If you have a Bible you can turn, otherwise I think we may have some of this for you up on the
[time=1842] screen. Habakkuk, Habakkuk, one of the prophets of God, exemplifies this proactive way of living.
[time=1849] What it means to be free in Christ. What it means to be responsible, moral, image-bearing, self-determining creature made in the image of God.
[time=1858] Remember, he had a problem. Habakkuk had a major problem. He was told by God of the
[time=1865] upcoming and certain destruction of the Chaldeans who would come and run over his culture, his family,
[time=1871] his political state, everything. The socio-economic world as he knew it was going to be utterly and
[time=1878] completely destroyed. He cries out in chapter 3 verse 13, though the fig tree should not blossom
[time=1887] and there be no fruit on the vines, though the yield of the olive should fail and the fields
[time=1893] produce no food, though the flock should be cut off from the fold and there be no cattle install.
[time=1899] Now what is he describing there? He is describing the end of his civilization as he knew it.
[time=1905] He lived in an agrarian community and when the fig tree doesn't blossom and there's no fruit in the vine and the olive should fail and their fields produce no food and the flock are cut off from the fold and there's no cattle in the stalls, you're looking at a waste land having been destroyed by this great Chaldean army. Is he reactive or proactive? Will he choose his
[time=1926] response to his circumstances? Verse 18, he cries out, "Yet I will exalt in the Lord. I will
[time=1934] rejoice in the God of my salvation. The Lord God is my strength. He has made my feet like
[time=1940] Hein's feet and makes me walk on high places." You find there an individual who is choosing,
[time=1946] who is choosing his response to life. In the book of Hebrews, you meet a group of people
[time=1955] who are newly come to Christ and they came to Christ in a time and in a day and in a place where to name the name of Christ would cause them great suffering and great persecution.
[time=1964] It says in Hebrews 1034 that even amidst all this great included social ostracism and imprisonment
[time=1973] and the seizure of their property and for some of them even death. He says in Hebrews 1034,
[time=1979] "For you showed sympathy to the prisoners and accepted what you accepted joyfully the seizure of your property knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and an abiding one."
[time=1990] They chose their response. Having chosen their values, having chosen their perspective on what
[time=2000] happens to the life dependent upon those values, they could see this authority figure in that city
[time=2007] come and not only take some of them as prisoners but take their property and leave them as destitute
[time=2013] without any way to provide for themselves and watch they accept the joyfully the seizure of their property. And then of course it's one thing to have your things taken away from you, right?
[time=2028] But it's an entirely different thing to be beaten, you yourself. And that's exactly the experience of Paul and Silas in Acts chapter 16 and we could go to many, many multiple places in
[time=2039] the life of Paul to give this. But in Acts 16 he's preaching in Philippi and the crowd rose up together against them and the chief magistrates tore their robes off of them. Paul and Silas, right there in public, ripped them naked and then proceeded to see them beaten with rods.
[time=2053] These rods were a bundle of rods loosely held together so that when they would contact your back they would not only bruise but they would eventually begin to tear and shred the flesh on your back. And when they had inflicted many blows upon them they threw them into the prison commanding the jailer to guard them securely. In verse 24 he having received such a command through them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in stocks. Public humiliation, the violation physically of being beaten with rods then into the inner prison fastened in stocks a very painful form of torture stripped of all their rights alone and destitute in the cause of
[time=2092] Christ. Verse 25 but about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns of praise to God.
[time=2099] You see you choose your values then you choose your perspective about the events of your life
[time=2107] as they relate to those values and in so doing you end up indirectly choosing and taking responsibility
[time=2114] for the attitudes of unceasing joy and constant thankfulness in your life. It is an amazing thing.
[time=2122] You say all right so that's the path. I mean the standard, the call, the opportunity,
[time=2134] the kind of life that God would have us to live is one of rejoicing always and one of giving thanks for every circumstance that ever came into our life.
[time=2144] Embracing the hardship of life, not a life of denial, not a life of pretend, not a life of ease.
[time=2150] I mean you've read through these scriptures with me this morning. There's no sense of denial in the hearts of these people. They have clearly in focus the tragedy of their lives but they choose to rejoice and they choose to be grateful. Why? How? Because they have chosen internal values.
[time=2165] They then see these events according to those values and the consequent reactive emotion is online with what God says ought to be there. Let me give you the third point
[time=2177] and it is this the basis of joyful gratitude. You say choose values, which values?
[time=2186] That's what I'll try to answer in the basis for joyful gratitude. If you don't have these core values at the base of your life you will never rejoice always and give thanks for everything.
[time=2196] It's impossible but put these in your life at least these 10 and others that you may choose to add and you will find that slowly but surely you like Paul, you like Habakkuk, you like those in the in
[time=2207] the book of Hebrews are involuntarily rejoicing more often than not involuntarily giving praise
[time=2214] and thanks to God for things that otherwise would have felt like to you the end of your life.
[time=2218] So what are the 10 core values that we need to choose above all the others? Let me give them to you.
[time=2225] Number one, number one the character of God, the character of God in Psalm 28 verse 7 it says this
[time=2232] the Lord is my strength and my shield my heart trusts in him and I am helped therefore my heart
[time=2239] exalts and with my song I shall thank him. In Psalm 89 16 the psalmist cries out in thy name
[time=2251] they rejoice all the day and by thy righteousness they are exalted. What is the name? In thy name
[time=2259] the name is the character of God it is all that he is it is his truth and his mercy his grace his compassion his faithfulness his righteousness his holiness he is a great and awesome God
[time=2270] unchanging the alpha and the omega the great I am that is our God. Wake up every morning with the
[time=2278] realization that the character of our God provides the value system to rejoice always and give thanks
[time=2285] for everything because the most important thing that could ever be about us is our God and he is
[time=2291] everything we could ever hope for unchanging in his perfection. The second one is what we call the
[time=2299] work of Christ and that's why in Luke 2 10 the angel said I've got good news of a great what a
[time=2305] great joy this is the stuff that produces joy and great joy. Romans chapter 5 says it
[time=2314] in explanation to what the joy of those angels meant. Listen to Romans 5 it says this therefore
[time=2320] having been justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ through whom also
[time=2328] we have obtained an introduction by faith into this grace in which we stand and we exalt in hope
[time=2334] of the glory of God the word exalt means to greatly rejoice. Paul is saying that one of the core
[time=2341] values of a joy filled life is the constant reminder that we are right with God we are at peace with
[time=2347] the creator of all the heavens and all the earth through the person and the work of Jesus Christ and that reality causes so much joy and so much thankfulness that we never seem to recover from it.
[time=2364] It's an amazing thing peace with God through Christ the battle is over the war is done our sins are
[time=2370] washed away hell and judgment which should have been ours will never be ours heaven and a real life life abundantly is ours now and forevermore rejoice and be thankful. Number three the ministry
[time=2384] of the Holy Spirit this is an amazing thing as it says in Romans 14 17 the kingdom of God is not
[time=2391] eating and drinking it is not circumstantial stuff ultimately the kingdom of God is righteousness and peace and then this joy in the Holy Spirit. One of the many things the Holy Spirit lives in
[time=2402] your life to do is to cause joy to erupt in your heart he seals us he baptizes us he endows us with
[time=2410] spiritual gifts he comforts and teaches and guides and convicts and prays for us all of this results
[time=2418] in our aligning ourselves to the perfect will of God and the resulting joy of the Holy Spirit
[time=2424] that is talked about as a fruit of the Spirit in Galatians chapter five Christ in you the hope of glory you see God lives in us through the power of the Holy Spirit. Number four spiritual blessings
[time=2437] the core value for joy is the remembrance of all the spiritual blessings Ephesians one says this
[time=2443] that God has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ those are among these he has made us holy and blameless imagine sinful corrupt
[time=2454] deviled people now because of Christ holy and blameless one of the blessings we're adopted as
[time=2460] his sons we are redeemed from the marketplace of sin we have obtained an inheritance which is imperishable and undefiled and will never fade away we've become joint heirs with Christ in other
[time=2471] words everything that Christ has and Colossians one says that all things were created for him and by him and he has all things everything that is is Christ and we in salvation have been blessed
[time=2482] to be joint heirs with Christ. Wow has a little more meaning than the little phrase have and I
[time=2490] stay doesn't it? Number five and this is huge divine providence divine providence one of the fundamental
[time=2499] core values that will produce joy and thankfulness in your life is the realization that God has the
[time=2506] ability and exercises at every second of your life to orchestrate the innumerable contingencies
[time=2512] that exist in the entire universe to make them all work together for your good in time and your
[time=2520] glory in eternity the things which boggle our minds and defy our understanding God's ability
[time=2527] to orchestrate all of the heavenly things all of the forces of wickedness all of the the host of Satan and his demons all of the unregenerate people all of the regenerate people all of the
[time=2540] weather patterns all of the physical phenomenons all of everything in life God in his divine providence
[time=2547] promises to orchestrate them all for our good nothing can enter our lives which has not passed
[time=2556] first through the grid of his divine providential love for us and his intended goal for our lives
[time=2562] you say where's the Bible say that Romans 8 28 and we know that God causes all things to work
[time=2571] together for good to those who love God to those who are called according to his purpose and the only caveat in the whole deal is to not redefine the purposes of God for your life but
[time=2582] let him have his purpose in you which as it says is in verse 29 that you should become conformed to the image of God we get sideways to God when we believe he should use his powers
[time=2593] of divine providence to work our lives and all that happens in the universe to make us as happy as we want to be or to or to bring about the fulfillment of misplaced values in our lives
[time=2604] there comes our lack of joy and our selfishness and our critical negative attitudes
[time=2611] understand God's purpose in your life to conform you to Christ and then understand the unconditional all-inclusive promise of God to work everything that is together for good for your benefit to
[time=2621] bring you into conform you to Christ and you have a core value of joy and gratitude there is then no thing that can ever enter your life that you do not first reassure yourself this is from the hand of God as evil and as wicked as that man might have meant it as horrible and as atrocious
[time=2636] as this government might be this is all nothing but the hand of God doing what he promised to do to conform me to the image of Christ if my value is there and my perspective follows that value
[time=2649] then I will be happy I will rejoice I will be grateful but if I do not want the purposes of God
[time=2655] in my life if I no longer want to be conformed to the image of Christ if instead I want pleasure or popularity or or money or whatever it is then suddenly I'll get sideways to the purposes of God
[time=2666] and I will have no joy God commands all of space matter time force and energy together for your
[time=2674] good to bring you to conformity to Christ is an amazing thing number six the promise of heaven
[time=2680] you want a core value you want to land on something to think about and critically choose
[time=2687] and assimilate into your heart as something that matters more to you than anything else and something that therefore you will look at all the rest of life through the reality of this one thing it's called the promise of heaven the people back in Hebrews Hebrews 11 they were said to be
[time=2702] tortured and then they were imprisoned and then they were mocked and scorned and chained and stoned and sawed in two and tempted and put to death but what does it say about them in verse
[time=2714] well chapter 11 it says this but they desire a better country that is a heavenly one therefore
[time=2720] God is not ashamed to be called their God for he has prepared a city for them the city whose builder and architect is not man but God himself the call of scripture over and over and over and
[time=2733] over again is to have as a fundamental value the phenomenal on ending unbroken on ceasing
[time=2739] on dimensioned or undiminished reality of all of heaven for all of eternity and then as that with
[time=2745] a value to see all of the rest of life in light of eternity with God and say oh this prepares me
[time=2752] for that this enables me to enter more deeply and more fully into what he has prepared I am joyful I will I will accept the seizure of my property with joy I will take these stocks
[time=2765] and these chains and these beatings on my I will accept this with joy I am thankful for this experience
[time=2773] that falls into the providential care of God it works together for my good and enhances my eternal ability to experience the wonders and the glories of heaven number seven number seven is called the privilege of prayer
[time=2789] I mean it's not enough to know that God will work everything together for good for you
[time=2795] but isn't it wonderful to know that you and I according to Hebrews 4 can draw near to that very throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace in time of need
[time=2804] I mean that is the assurance that God has never forgotten you because you never let him forget you and he calls you over and over and over again to get back in his presence and bring up all over again your newest petition request need unburden your heart pour out your soul you know explain the
[time=2820] problems of your life and his very throne room and find there the grace and the mercy in the time
[time=2826] of your need he doesn't cut us off he doesn't make promises and say okay that's it for now I'll see you at the end of your life but remember I'll work it out all okay he says no as we walk down the hardships the trials the vicissitudes the struggles of life you come back over and over and over again to me the very throne of grace and mercy and I will dispense new power and new
[time=2847] energy and new life so that you can live your life as I've called you to live it and as we are
[time=2853] pouring out our souls and making our petitions and our needs be known as he has invited us to do even even analogous to the widow remember the poor widow under the unrighteous judge and she came back over and over and over and over again and finally the judge not because he was righteous like our god but because he wanted to be bothered by her no more said I'll give you what you want he says come back over and over again and if you're praying wrong Romans 8 says the spirit of God
[time=2879] will then reinterpret those prayers so that they are properly understood and appropriately given to the Father the Holy Spirit will intercede and interpret for us huh man with a link what a source
[time=2893] of joy what a source of gratitude number eight scripture scripture he has given us in the pages
[time=2904] of this book the very living Word of God that which is active and sharper than any two-edged sword
[time=2911] as Psalm 19 verse 8 says the precepts of the Lord are right and they are rejoicing of the heart
[time=2917] the commandment of the Lord is pure enlightening the eyes that psalm goes on to say that more
[time=2923] desirable are the scriptures than gold yea than much fine gold sweeter also than honey and the dripping of the honeycomb when your value says that I care more about the Word of God than I do gold
[time=2935] and I do much fine gold that the Word of God is sweeter to me than even honey the drippings of the honeycomb you will begin to find then the perspective to view your life and have the attendant
[time=2946] consequent emotions of joy and thankfulness Psalm 119 14 I have rejoiced in the ways of in the
[time=2955] way of thy testimonies as much as in all riches I am in other words I am happier to have the word
[time=2961] of God than all the money in the world and it's mine I have many copies of the word of God and I can get more copies of the word of God and it never changes and it never alters and it never fails it's always there it never runs out nobody wants to steal it as they might with riches it doesn't
[time=2979] corrupt how are our values today what do we really care about is the question and maybe the best
[time=2989] indicator of what we really care about isn't what we would answer on a test isn't how you might answer
[time=2995] the question as I give it to you this morning maybe the greatest indicator of our of what we really care about is the level of joy and gratitude that fills our lives for they are certainly the
[time=3005] respondent attitudes to our values to what we really care about Psalm 119 11 says I have inherited thy testimonies forever for they are the joy of my heart
[time=3020] I rejoice that thy word as one who finds great spoil Psalm 119 162
[time=3033] so it is the ever-living active penetrating life-giving word of God that we value and with it we see and interpret all the experiences of our lives and so we have joy and we are thankful number nine it's a thing called Christian fellowship and
[time=3051] this is not as faithful and this is not as reliable and this is not as dependable as what has gone before because it involves you and me it's not just a God thing but it is part of what constitutes the Christian's joy and the Christian's gratitude in 1 Thessalonians chapter 3 verse 10 Paul says
[time=3067] for what thanks can we render to God for you in return for all the joy with which we receive before our God on your account he says man how can I say thank you to God for all the joy
[time=3080] that we have gotten from you you make us so happy you fill our hearts so full as we see your repent
[time=3087] as we see you turn from idols to serve a true and living God as we see that your faith has works as we see that your labor is driven by genuine authentic love for the brother and the lost I mean you guys fill my heart so much with joy Paul says that I don't know how to thank God for all the joy in my heart it exceeds my ability to articulate in 2 Timothy 1 verse 4 Paul says I'm longing to see you even as I recall your tears
[time=3114] so that I may be filled with joy for Paul to see Timothy again would have filled his heart with joy
[time=3120] what does that tell you about him he values people more than things he values people more than circumstances he values people more than his own
[time=3130] little place in the sun working out every last little detail of his life trying to solve all of his own little problems trying to get every little duck in order trying to get every little thing to work just the way he wants it for him Paul was lost in his love for people so much so
[time=3145] as a core value that when they grew in the Lord his heart was overwhelmed with joy genuine authentic real vulnerable supportive loving pursuit of precious relationships with
[time=3158] unbelievers will bring you more joy than the world has ever known
[time=3166] number 10 and finally number 10 helping helping seekers find and follow Christ is a source of great joy
[time=3177] I love this little text I mean Paul and the things we were just talking about was the joy
[time=3184] that comes into your heart because you value believers because you value authentic Christian fellowship because you enjoy being in relationship with others of a like precious faith but it doesn't stop there when you fully give your heart over to value the things that God values and when people matter to you as much as they do to God then you will find that even the proclamation of the gospel
[time=3204] and its attendant success and responsiveness in the heart of unbelievers will overflow your heart
[time=3210] with more joy than you can ever get anywhere else in terms of the things of this world
[time=3216] listen to Acts 15 verse 3 therefore being sent on their way speaking of the apostles
[time=3222] by the church they were passing through both Phoenicia and Samaria describing in detail the
[time=3228] conversion of the Gentiles and were bringing great joy to all the brethren I mean they were just
[time=3235] having huge yea God sessions as they were hearing that as the apostles would move to a new area
[time=3242] and say guess what just happened from whence we came these people these people came to Christ and it would cause enormous joy in the hearts of their own and those they loved and the the other
[time=3254] believers so how's your attitude these days that's a hard and searching question isn't it
[time=3264] the mind isn't always any better than yours I mean it is so easy to become critical it is so
[time=3270] easy to become negative it is so easy to become bitter it is so easy to say I'm just gonna quit
[time=3276] I'm just gonna stop I'm gonna keep doing but I'm gonna stop being vulnerable in those inner parts
[time=3283] of my heart and my life where real joy and real gratitude spring but the word of God holds up to us this morning in 1st Thessalonians chapter 5 a very enticing way
[time=3298] to live it is the way of rejoicing always it is the way of giving thanks in everything
[time=3305] and there is no quick fix here there is no simple solution there is no instant joy
[time=3312] it is a long and painful process of pulling up and looking at values that cannot produce joy and
[time=3326] gratitude and repenting and rejecting and throwing those out to speaking them out of your life
[time=3335] and it is instead a careful look at scripture 10 of them this morning of the kinds of things that
[time=3343] the great people of the word of God who had learned to live this way valued and placing those instead
[time=3350] we choose our values and then we use the enormous mental discipline
[time=3356] to allow those values to shape our perspective our opinions about the events the circumstances
[time=3365] and the people of our lives according to those values and by the ministry of the holy spirit
[time=3372] something marvelous happens not happiness not happenstance not happiness joy real life giving
[time=3384] joy erupts and does the constant giving of thanks it is an awesome thing
[time=3397] let me invite you to stand for a closing word of prayer
[time=3403] our gracious god and heavenly father how we thank you for again
[time=3410] shocking us with your word the standard the call of rejoicing always and being grateful for
[time=3417] everything just seems ridiculous lord to be honest it just seems so far out of reach the circumstances of our lives seem to defy it on a daily almost moment by moment basis that seems as though murphy's law is here and here to stay and so we thank you first and foremost god for writing our thinking again this morning that
[time=3437] is not true i mean murphy may be around but we don't have to succumb to it it is not a fatalistic
[time=3444] way of living it is not the robbing and actually the forfeiting and the handing over of that power to choose our responses we take it back this morning to honor you and to give you glory and
[time=3456] through your power we take back the choice all over again and we say no we will choose our values and so we will root out those which defy you and those which lead us to be angry with you
[time=3468] and those which cause us to lose our joy and our gratitude we will root them up we will look at them we will expose them to the light of your scripture and we will throw them out of our lives over and over and over again money will not do pleasure will not do success will not do
[time=3485] popularity will not do power will not do circumstantial joy will not be our pursuit
[time=3493] we will have different values values of a great and awesome creator god whose nature is perfect and
[time=3500] true values of a god who sent his own son and the work of christ to redeem us and put us at peace
[time=3506] with him values of an ever-living ever-present and dwelling holy spirit who guides and leads us
[time=3512] values of eternal consequence and oh god please help us then to use the mental discipline to see
[time=3522] the rest of our lives in light of those great truths so that we can walk with you day in and day out
