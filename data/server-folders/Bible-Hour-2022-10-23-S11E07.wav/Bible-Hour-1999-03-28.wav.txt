[time=18] So the changeling eagle never gave it another thought, and it died, thinking it was a prayer
[time=48] chicken. What a tragedy built to soar into the heavens, but conditioned to stay
[time=56] earthbound. He pecked at stray seeds and chased insects. Sounds a little bit like
[time=65] you. Sounds a little bit like me. Built to soar into the heavens, but conditioned to
[time=72] stay earthbound. We pecked at stray seeds and insects. Though youths grow weary and
[time=80] tired and vigorous young men stumble badly, yet those who wait for the Lord will gain new strength. They will mount up with wings like eagles. They will run and not get tired. They will walk and not become weary. Let's talk about prayer
[time=97] this morning. Let's talk about soaring into the heavens. Let's talk about unshackled, unfettered, experiencing of God on a day in and day out basis as if
[time=108] we were just breathing in His power every moment of every day.

[time=548] [MUSIC]
[time=564] When so many voices surround me, screaming for attention all at once makes me long for some time with my Lord.
[time=589] And that old chair by the window where I go to be with Him alone on my knees is where I want to be.
[time=608] When this life overwhelms me, I can pour my heart out and bear my soul to the one who loves me on my knees.
[time=636] Just me and the Lord in a quiet place.
[time=645] That's the best way I could ever start my day.
[time=653] But when life moves so fast, I can catch my breath that appointment seems to be the first to go.
[time=667] And it's what I need the most on my knees is where I want to be.
[time=680] When this life overwhelms me, I can pour my heart out and bear my soul to the one who loves me on my knees.
[time=705] But I can pour my heart out and bear my soul to the one who loves me on my knees.
[time=729] On my knees.
[time=754] Thank you. Beautiful, beautiful song.
[time=757] Let me invite you as we continue to think about prayer to open your Bible to 1 Thessalonians chapter 5.
[time=765] And as you know, we're kind of making our way through this book and we come this morning to a verse that is very short.
[time=774] Three words, pray without ceasing.
[time=779] Ted Inksram in his little book The Pursuit of Excellence tells the story from American Indian folklore about a brave who found an eagles egg and put it in the nest of a prairie chicken.
[time=793] The eaglet hatched with the brood of chickens and grew up with them.
[time=797] All of his life, the changeling eagle, thinking he was a prairie chicken did what prairie chickens did.
[time=803] He scratched in the dirt for seeds and insects to eat.
[time=807] He clucked and cackled and he flew in a brief thrashing of wings and flurry of feathers no more than a few feet off the ground.
[time=816] After all, that's how prairie chickens were supposed to fly.
[time=820] Years passed and the changeling eagle grew very old.
[time=825] One day he saw a magnificent bird far above him in the cloudless sky hanging with graceful majesty on the powerful wind currents.
[time=833] Its sword was scarcely a beat of its strong golden wings.
[time=838] What a beautiful bird said the changeling eagle to his neighbor.
[time=842] What is it?
[time=843] Oh, that's an eagle.
[time=845] The chief of the birds, the neighbor clucked.
[time=849] But don't give it a second thought.
[time=851] You could never be like him.
[time=855] So the changeling eagle never gave it another thought.
[time=858] And it died thinking it was a prairie chicken.
[time=862] What a tragedy.
[time=864] Built to soar into the heavens but conditioned to stay earthbound.
[time=870] He pecked at stray seeds and chased insects.
[time=876] Sounds a little bit like you.
[time=880] Built to soar into the heavens but conditioned to stay earthbound.
[time=886] We peck at stray seeds and insects.
[time=891] This little verse, pray without ceasing.
[time=894] The word pray there is the most general of all the words in the New Testament.
[time=897] It includes prayers of confession and thanks and intercession and submission.
[time=903] And the word unceasing, it doesn't mean non-stop talking, it means a way of life, like breathing.
[time=910] It's something you take with you everywhere you go.
[time=913] Inhaling and exhaling, the presence and the power of God through unceasing prayer.
[time=919] Almost makes you wonder, doesn't it?
[time=921] What does Paul know that we don't about prayer?
[time=925] What kind of relationship with God had he come to experience that would lead him to write a verse like this?
[time=931] Pray, pray without ceasing.
[time=934] And what exactly was he inviting this young group of Christians at Thessalonica to do?
[time=941] And how did they respond to it?
[time=943] And how did it make sense to them, this pray without ceasing thing?
[time=948] And what about you and what about me?
[time=951] Makes you wonder, are we scratching around in the dirt for seeds and insects, scratching about no more than a few feet off the ground when in reality we've been built to soar into the heavens?
[time=964] As I read that verse and think of the illustration that Ted Inksrum brings, it reminds me of the familiar passage in Isaiah 40, let me just read it to you.
[time=973] When he says this, "Though youths grow weary and tired and vigorous young men stumble badly,
[time=979] yet those who wait for the Lord will gain new strength, they will mount up with wings like eagles, they will run and not get tired, they will walk and not become weary." Let's talk about prayer this morning, let's talk about soaring into the heavens.
[time=996] Let's talk about unshackled, unfettered experiencing of God on a day in and day out basis
[time=1003] as if we were just breathing in His power every moment of every day.
[time=1008] And to do that, let me broaden the discussion of prayer by asking you now to leave 1 Thessalonians 5 and come to a wonderful passage in Luke chapter 11.
[time=1018] Luke chapter 11, as I have come to realize a fresh and anew even this week, may be the best passage on prayer in all of the Bible.
[time=1030] In Luke 11 verse 1, Jesus is found there with His disciples, and it says in this text,
[time=1037] came about that while He, meaning Jesus, was praying in a certain place after He had finished, one of His disciples said to Him, "Lord, teach us to pray just as John also taught His disciples."
[time=1050] It seems to have been the deliberate practice of our Lord to engage in private prayer
[time=1057] in the presence of His disciples.
[time=1060] This wasn't a prayer meaning they were all having together, this was a time of private prayer that Jesus was having in the presence of His disciples, almost as though to provoke from them the very question that was forthcoming in verse 1, "Lord, teach us how to pray." It was almost as if He baited them time and time and time again by having private prayer in their presence.
[time=1082] So they would finally say, "What are you doing? I mean, how do you do that?
[time=1086] Tell us, teach us how to pray." And what follows in these 12 verses, as I have said, is some of the most amazing and comprehensive truth about praying in all of the Bible.
[time=1099] And let me tell you where we're headed.
[time=1101] I'll give you a little outline.
[time=1102] I want to talk about four things from this text.
[time=1104] Jesus gives, first of all, the pattern of prayer.
[time=1107] Excuse me, He tells you what to pray about.
[time=1111] And then secondly, He calls you to the persistence of prayer.
[time=1114] How often should you pray?
[time=1116] And then thirdly, He gives the promise of prayer.
[time=1120] What kind of guarantees do we have that if we pray, God will hear?
[time=1124] And if He will hear, what kind of guarantees do we have about His answers?
[time=1129] And then He'll close this little teaching out in verse 4.
[time=1132] The fourth point I want to give on the perspective of prayer.
[time=1135] How should we view God's answers as we pray?
[time=1140] So let's do that this morning.
[time=1141] Number one, the pattern of prayer.
[time=1143] Look at verses 2 and 4, and this is the familiar Lord's prayer, probably better titled the disciples prayer, because it was the prayer He gave to them in response to their question.
[time=1154] Tell us how to pray.
[time=1156] Look at it.
[time=1157] Verse 2, He said to them, "When you pray, say, Father, how it would be thy name, thy kingdom come.
[time=1164] Give us each day our daily bread, and forgive us our sins.
[time=1169] For we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us, and lead us not into temptation." This is one of the two places that the Lord's prayer is given in the New Testament.
[time=1179] The other is over in Matthew.
[time=1182] You know, God did not give us this prayer so that we could recite it.
[time=1186] It's never intended that we should memorize this prayer.
[time=1189] And then whenever we pray, we just recite these words.
[time=1193] It is instead an offering of the great themes of prayer.
[time=1198] Jesus in this prayer gives them not so much the words of prayer, but the themes of prayer.
[time=1204] When you pray, pray about these kinds of issues.
[time=1208] Let these kinds of themes and concepts and principles be the stuff, the fabric,
[time=1215] the foundation that you then elaborate on and bring your heart and your soul and your mind and the situation of your life, but bring them to these kinds of things.
[time=1223] What are they?
[time=1224] He begins, "Father, hallowed be thy name." And Jesus basically teaches us that when you open your lips and open your time of prayer with God, the beginning place is to give honor and glory to His great name.
[time=1237] Hallowed be thy name.
[time=1240] And that doesn't mean we just recite the names of God, El Shaddai, et cetera, et cetera.
[time=1244] The name of God describes and represents all of the character of God
[time=1250] and all of the plan of God and the will of God.
[time=1253] It is the sum total of all that He is and all that He purposes to do.
[time=1258] That's why in Exodus 34, when Moses called upon "the name of the Lord," God answered Him as He passed by, it says in the text, "Then the Lord passed by in front of Him and proclaimed the Lord." The Lord God, here it is, "compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in loving kindness and truth, who keeps loving kindness for thousands and forgives the iniquity and the transgression and the sin of His people." The name of the Lord represents the character of God.
[time=1287] He is compassionate and gracious and slow to anger, abounding in loving kindness.
[time=1292] And Jesus teaches His followers, when you pray, you open by rehearsing and thinking through and remembering the wonderful, gracious characteristics of God.
[time=1303] David did that in Psalm 7. He said this, "I will give thanks to the Lord according to His righteousness, and will sing praises to the name of the Lord most high."
[time=1315] In Psalm 20, verse 7, it says this, "Some boast in chariots and some in horses,
[time=1321] but we will boast in the name of the Lord our God." And again, it is not that we boast in His name, God or His titles creator.
[time=1331] It is that we boast and take our pride and have our hope, not in our strength of chariot and horses, but we will boast in the character and the disposition and the quality of who our God is.
[time=1344] All that He is, He is holy and righteous and magnificent and awesome and just and merciful and truthful and gracious and patient and loving.
[time=1351] And all that He does, the creator, a sustainer, life-giver and life-taker, covenant-keeper, almighty judge and great redeemer.
[time=1362] We are amazed. We are astounded. We are shocked. We are in love with.
[time=1368] And it is our first point of entry in prayer to celebrate the reality of a God who is like that.
[time=1376] That's where prayer begins. Pray like this. And you do it in your own words.
[time=1381] And you do it out of what you have seen Him be and do in your life.
[time=1385] And you do it out of your study of the Word of God. And as you are learning about God, you begin your prayers with great, hallowed be thy name. You are an awesome God.
[time=1396] But then He moves in His little prayer and says, "After you've hallowed the name of God, then pray thy kingdom come." And this is the prayer of the saint for the advancing of the kingdom of God.
[time=1410] We come to God and the first thing that's on our heart after we've hallowed His name is that His purposes, that His will, that His sovereign direction in this day and age will be advanced, all leading to the Second Coming of Christ. God, what you are going to do on this earth, it is your plan I hope for, it is your will, it is your way, it is the longing of your heart that I ask to happen in my life and in the lives of those around me, in the life of our church.
[time=1435] It's an amazing thing. Start by hallowing His name, boasting in His character,
[time=1441] putting your hope, not in your self, your church or anything other than He Himself, and then pray that whatever it is that it's in His heart to do in our lives, "Oh God, let it come. Let your kingdom come on earth. Let your will be done on earth as it is in heaven."
[time=1455] Is the other rendition of this prayer. And then, you'll see in verse three,
[time=1461] you come to your own needs and it's wonderful to see over and over and over again in the Word of God.
[time=1466] He invites us to bring our needs. Give us each day our daily bread.
[time=1472] And in the day and the age, this word bread symbolized all of the physical needs of life.
[time=1479] Bread was food, it represented health, it was a prayer for weather and for the house
[time=1486] and for your spouse and for your children, for your government, for peace.
[time=1490] It encompassed all that was necessary in a man's life, a woman's life.
[time=1495] Give us each day our daily bread. Oh God, provide for us the stuff of life.
[time=1502] It's wonderful to travel to places like Philippians 4, where the verse there on prayer includes our specific requests about the needs of our lives.
[time=1511] We have a gracious, compassionate, heavenly Father who is already intimately acquainted with all of our ways, but longs and loves and rejoices in the reciting of it back to Him from our own heart, from our perspective.
[time=1524] And Jesus invites us to do that, to go into the throne room of God and say, "Oh God, give us each day our daily bread."
[time=1532] And then of course in verse 4, He invites us to have the theme of confession of our sins
[time=1538] and forgive us our sins for we also forgive everyone who has a debt against us.
[time=1544] And here is the constant, regular admission of our failings, admission of our sin, our selfishness, our pride,
[time=1551] our arrogance, our wayward heart, not because we've lost our salvation, not because some sin has caused us to fall from the grace of God, but because it is on our heart to do.
[time=1561] It is one of the ministries of the Holy Spirit, and we are grieved in our heart whenever we would sin against the God
[time=1567] who had been so gracious to forgive us in the first place.
[time=1572] This little note, you know, even as we are also forgiving everyone who is indebted to us, that's the whole dynamic you read about in Matthew 18, we're having been forgiven, a debt we could never repay,
[time=1584] to God we gladly forgive the debts of others against us which are minuscule in comparison to the debt that we would owe God
[time=1591] if we were ever to stand for all of our sin.
[time=1594] And it is one of the great evidences of true salvation, and it is one of the great evidences that you are truly forgiven by God is that you forgive the people who have sinned against you because you can't conceive of not forgiving them so small at that
[time=1606] when you yourself have forgiven such a great debt.
[time=1611] And so we rehearse this in our prayers with God, and they are as new and as deferent and as diverse as our most recent failings
[time=1618] and as our most recent rebellion and as our most recent sin.
[time=1624] And then he says there is yet another, and it is at the end of verse 4, he says, "And lead us not into temptation."
[time=1631] And this is not to imply that God would tempt one of his children to sin, it says in James that God, you know, can't do that
[time=1637] and doesn't do that, it is rather this prayer for wisdom.
[time=1640] Oh God, help me to and lead me in a way that orchestrates the situations of my life so that I don't unduly put myself
[time=1647] in places of temptation where I would fail and sin against you.
[time=1652] So there is the pattern of prayer, and whether one comes before the other doesn't really matter.
[time=1658] God is, Christ is just saying you guys want to know how to pray, you want to know what I do when I slip next to you
[time=1664] and let you watch me and you don't really know what I'm doing, I'll tell you what I'm doing.
[time=1667] I am first and foremost hallowing and honoring the name and the character of God.
[time=1671] And then I am praying for my total surrender to the advancement of his kingdom that I might be used in whatever possible way
[time=1678] and will and his way and his longings might be true in my life and in the lives of those around me.
[time=1683] And then I constantly pray, even though he has promised to meet my needs, I pray over and over and over again
[time=1689] that he would provide the daily provision of my life.
[time=1691] And I hear unburdened myself for the concerns I have for my family, my friends, my church, my health,
[time=1697] the ones that, you know, all the practical stuff of life.
[time=1700] And he says, guys, I'm constantly before the Lord, and of course he didn't need for this, but he knew we did
[time=1707] to confess our sins and to refresh our relationship with God as we seek his forgiveness
[time=1713] and maintain a sense of intimacy in our life with him.
[time=1717] And then ask for the wisdom of God that he would not lead you into temptation.
[time=1721] Say, God, you know the beginning from the end, you know my tomorrow's, you know my weaknesses, you know how I may be tempted to fall into sin.
[time=1728] Oh, God, help me to be so sensitive to follow your leading in ways that are full of strength and honor
[time=1734] and dignity for all of my days.
[time=1737] The pattern of prayer.
[time=1740] And then he moves to the persistence of prayer.
[time=1744] And look at it in verses five and eight.
[time=1746] And this is amazing.
[time=1747] And he said to them, give them a little story.
[time=1749] You want to know how often you should pray?
[time=1751] This is how often you ought to pray.
[time=1752] Verse five, suppose one of you shall have a friend, and shall go to him at midnight and say to him, "Friend, lend me three loaves, for a friend of mine has come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him." And from inside he shall answer and say, "Do not bother me.
[time=1768] The door has already been shut, and my children and I are in bed.
[time=1771] I cannot get up and give you anything." Without, you know, modern day furnaces, it was not common for the entire family to jump into one big bed
[time=1780] and, you know, allow the body heat of the other to warm the other and get it all tucked in as they say.
[time=1785] And I can't get out of bed, man, I'm smothered in here with my wife and my kids.
[time=1789] We're comfy cozy.
[time=1791] Verse eight, I tell you, even though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend,
[time=1799] yet because of his persistence he will get up and give him as much as he needs.
[time=1805] Isn't that interesting?
[time=1807] God is saying this, you've got to be like the relentless, persistent friend who will not leave the house
[time=1813] and who will not stop knocking on the door and who will not let this man or his family go back to sleep.
[time=1818] He just refused to leave.
[time=1820] He just stand there and bang and bang and bang and bang all day until finally the guy, not because he's your friend,
[time=1827] but because he doesn't want to be bothered by you anymore, gets up and gives you what you want.
[time=1831] God says, "Pray to me that way.
[time=1834] Come after me with that kind of persistence.
[time=1836] Come over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.
[time=1841] Never stop until I give you the answer to your prayer." A similar parable he tells over in Luke 18, I'll just read it to you.
[time=1850] There wasn't a certain city a judge and the judge did not fear God and he did not respect man.
[time=1855] He was a wicked judge and there was a widow in that city.
[time=1858] And she kept coming to him saying, "Give me legal protection from my opponent." And for a while he was unwilling, but after he said to himself, "Even though I do not fear God nor respect man,
[time=1870] yet because this widow bothers me, I will give her legal protection less by continually coming, she wear me out." Here with the righteous judge said, Jesus says, "Now shall not God bring about justice for his elect
[time=1884] who cry to him how often, day and night, and will he delay long over them?"
[time=1890] You want to know what the persistence of prayers to be liked?
[time=1894] You want to know how often and how faithful and how consistent and how much you should bother God as much as this widow did to an unrighteous judge who gave no regard for her by upholding of law but simply granted the request less by continually coming to me she wear me out.
[time=1912] That's amazing in it.
[time=1915] And we know God is not an unloving friend who needs even to be provoked.
[time=1920] And we know that God is not an unrighteous judge who needs only to find justice for his own sake.
[time=1927] But nevertheless God says be persistent.
[time=1931] The invitation is to come back over and over and over again to move God as it were by sheer determination and persistence to wear him out
[time=1941] so that he grants your request.
[time=1943] And that was the obvious pattern of the people of God through the centuries in Acts 1-14.
[time=1949] It says this, "These all with one mind were continually devoting themselves to prayer.
[time=1955] In Acts 6 the apostles were being invited to care for what they considered collateral needs in the church.
[time=1962] They refused to do it saying this, but we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the Word."
[time=1968] They wouldn't let anything keep them from persistent devotion to prayer.
[time=1974] Ephesians 6-18, "With all prayer and petition, how often?
[time=1978] Pray at all times in the Spirit." In 1 Thessalonians 3-10 Paul says about this very experience
[time=1986] as we night and day kept praying most earnestly that we may see your face.
[time=1991] How often? Night and day.
[time=1994] Colossians 4-2, "Do vote yourselves to prayer." Now again this is not a call to vain repetition.
[time=2002] This is not a mindless mantra of some kind, a chant before God where you lose any connection to your heart and your soul and your relationship with God and you just spit out an endless repetition of words.
[time=2015] The Lord Himself cautions us against that.
[time=2018] That's not at all the matter. This is a heartfelt concern of a friend for a friend who needs food, of a widow who cries out for justice and comes back not with a mantra but comes back out of the concern of her own life so that justice might be served.
[time=2033] Pray like that Jesus says. Bring it on.
[time=2038] Come after your God over and over and over again.
[time=2044] And you see what will He do? How will He respond?
[time=2049] Well that brings us to our third point, the promise of prayer.
[time=2053] What kind of guarantees has He made to us? And this is just absolutely stunning.
[time=2058] Look at verses 9 and 10.
[time=2060] "And I say to you, ask, and it shall be given you.
[time=2066] Seek, and you shall find, knock, and it shall be opened to you
[time=2072] for everyone who asks, receives, and he who seeks, finds, and to him who knocks,
[time=2078] it shall be opened." Isn't that amazing?
[time=2084] He is saying here, "I promise I will answer you."
[time=2090] It is very clear from this text and many others, he is saying, "I am not going to not answer you. I will always answer your prayer."
[time=2099] If you ask, it will be given. If you seek, you will find. If you knock, it will be opened.
[time=2105] God promises to answer every single one of our prayers.
[time=2112] He guarantees us that our prayers are not bouncing off some cast iron heaven, but instead that they, in fact, find their way to the heart and mind of God and that He will, having heard them, answer our prayer.
[time=2129] And I know what you're thinking. You're saying, "Not my prayers."
[time=2135] Is there some little sneak preview clause here?
[time=2138] Is there some provision that I'm missing?
[time=2140] Is it only after you ask with enough persistence that, finally, you get to the place that He answers your prayer?
[time=2145] Because I know of countless prayers that God has not answered for me.
[time=2149] In fact, one of the reasons I don't pray without ceasing is because I am so tired of the disappointment of asking and never seeing anything happen in response to my prayers.
[time=2162] You can tell our stories, and I can too.
[time=2165] We have, as a church, prayed for the sick and they have died.
[time=2169] We have prayed for our missionaries, and they have failed.
[time=2173] Many of you have prayed for your business, and it has gone broke.
[time=2177] You prayed for your mate, and now you're divorced.
[time=2180] You prayed for a mate, and you're still single.
[time=2183] You prayed for your child, and their heart with God, and your child is now a million miles away from God, and from you.
[time=2190] What do you mean? What is He saying if you ask, it shall be given, if you seek, you shall find, if you knock, it shall be opened for everyone who asks or sees.
[time=2201] What do you mean God will always answer my prayer?
[time=2206] Well, Jesus must have known you and I would have these questions about His promise, and so He invites us to this fourth main point,
[time=2217] the perspective of prayer. Look at it, verses 11 and 13.
[time=2224] Now, suppose one of you fathers is asked by his son for a fish.
[time=2233] He will not give him a snake instead of a fish, will he?
[time=2238] Or if he is asked for an egg, will he not give him a scorpion?
[time=2245] If you then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask?
[time=2256] You see, we have to have the right perspective about His answer.
[time=2261] The promise found in verses 10 and 11 isn't that He will give us exactly what we ask.
[time=2268] For no Father would ever obligate Himself to give His child whatever His child would ask.
[time=2276] Can I have another cookie? Can I have another cookie?
[time=2281] Can I have the whole bag? How about some candy bars now?
[time=2286] I don't want to go to bed. Do I have to go to bed?
[time=2293] He doesn't promise to give us the longing of our hearts.
[time=2298] He doesn't promise to become some type of thoughtless, uncaring, unloving vending machine, and all we have to do is pop enough prayer coins into the component and then pick all A-17 and out pops whatever we want, a new car, a successful business, et cetera, et cetera.
[time=2319] That would make God into a monster.
[time=2321] That would make God into an irresponsible person to give us everything we thought to ask for.
[time=2329] He says, "I promise to answer your prayer.
[time=2334] I promise to hear and respond." The only issue that remains is whether or not you are willing to rightfully perceive
[time=2344] what I have chosen to give in response to your request.
[time=2354] About ten years ago, we encountered a family by the name of the Romanoskeys.
[time=2359] They were a wonderful family. Two high school age girls just ready to graduate
[time=2365] and a little son in grammar school, and they brought with them to foreign exchange students, and they were coming from Utah, making the long trip in their family station wagon.
[time=2376] It was a great day for the Romanoskeys because the day they had been praying for was finally upon them. Their two daughters were about ready to graduate from high school and enter into college, and they had music in their heart, and they loved the Lord, and they were coming to Los Angeles to check out two different colleges and to seek God's will as to which they should attend.
[time=2398] The master's college, or Biola.
[time=2402] And the Romanoskeys had been praying all their lives, you know, for their girls and for every aspect of their girls' lives, and college for them was that great day of, you know, beginning of autonomy and independence, and they were looking forward for them in that college age to find their life mates and to begin their families.
[time=2419] Before they even left, you know, from Utah, they had prayed God for traveling
[time=2426] mercies and safety. The whole thing had been surrendered under a blanket of prayer
[time=2432] to their great and loving God.
[time=2436] They knew a lot about prayer, you know, trying to start and run an evangelical church right next door to the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. Couldn't have been an easy thing.
[time=2445] And they weren't burning up any growth church records or anything like that, but boy, they'd been at it for a long, long time, and they could tell you stories about one or two people in a three or four year period of time that would actually come to see the truth of the gospel and the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ. They were godly folks.
[time=2462] They arrived at the Masters College first. What a thrill. Mr. Romanoski had been listening to John MacArthur's ministry from tapes and radio all of his life and was just in awe to actually be, you know, on the place where John would walk.
[time=2477] To meet the faculty, to see the buildings, to get there with his wife and his daughters and sit there in the music department with Paul Plou and hear about the music program and the shepherding of their children and how this whole school was designed to cause them to grow in their relationship with Christ.
[time=2494] Well, they were so excited, but they had to go see the other school too.
[time=2497] So they jump back in their car, the mom and dad and the child in the front seat, and the two Ford Exchange students in the middle seat, and then the two daughters sitting in that like rumble seat, remember those in the back of station wagons, and it was a hot day and they didn't have air conditioning, so all the windows were down front and back.
[time=2517] They had it east on Plastivity Canyon all four or five hundred yards and came to a major boulevard called Sierra Highway guarded by signals because the traffic moves so incredibly fast up and down that road, and Mr. Romanoski, he only had one eye.
[time=2531] The other was glass and he was legal to drive. I mean, he had a driver's license and such, but the one eye sometimes, he didn't see everything, and this time he didn't see the stoplight.
[time=2541] And he pulled on out wrongfully onto Sierra Highway, and a van was unable to stop, and at 55 miles an hour it collided into the front of their station wagon, which spun the station wagon in a circle, and his two precious daughters were ejected out the back window.
[time=2556] But a time he came to his senses and looked, all he could see were his two precious
[time=2562] daughters laying dead in the intersection of East Plastivity Canyon and Sierra Highway.
[time=2569] Punctuated by his lovely and gracious wife who'd come to her senses a little quicker than he was cradling in his arms, one of his daughters.
[time=2579] He watched the helicopter come in and whisk everybody off, but it was to no avail, and there were dead on arrival.
[time=2591] Now suppose one of you fathers is asked by his son for a fish.
[time=2601] He will not give him a snake instead of a fish, will he?
[time=2607] Or if he is asked for an egg, he will not give him a scorpion.
[time=2618] Having heard of this calamitous event, Heidi and I were privileged to invite the Romanuskies into our home, and as they spent several days in the area making arrangements,
[time=2628] and we would watch them emerge from the bedroom from time to time for physical sustenance and for comfort, and as they would labor under this enormous weight of grief, and Mr. Romanusky of course understandably himself a sense of guilt and responsibility, you know.
[time=2645] But over that brief period of time we watched them interpret the circumstances of their life
[time=2654] and the answer to their prayer, not according to what they wanted to see happen,
[time=2662] what they had hoped to see happen, but according to the character of God.
[time=2670] And they began to say to themselves, you know what?
[time=2673] It is not like our Heavenly Father to give a snake instead of a fish, or a scorpion instead of an egg.
[time=2683] And with faith and courage that was astonishing to us, full of grief and full of tears and full of pain and full of sorrow,
[time=2694] they were able to say, you know what God has done in this event is not a snake and it is not a scorpion.
[time=2701] The answer to our prayer is hurtful, it is painful, it is a crushing blow, but it is not a snake.
[time=2712] And it is not a scorpion.
[time=2716] I remember the both of them finally near the end of their stay with us saying, you know, it's an interesting thing.
[time=2722] We had come looking for a college where our daughters could sing in a choir.
[time=2729] And apparently our gracious and loving Heavenly Father has chosen to elevate them and graduate them to sing not with the Master's College Choir, not with the Biola Choir, but with the Heavenly Choir.
[time=2744] Who knows what their lives might have been like?
[time=2748] Who knows what pain and grief and sorrow might have been spared?
[time=2751] Who knows the purposes and the plan of God?
[time=2757] But we do know the character of God.
[time=2760] And we know that as amazingly true as it is for even an earthly father.
[time=2765] I mean, except for those perverse and sick situations where an earthly father will actually harm his own child,
[time=2771] there isn't a father in this room who would even begin to conceive of handing his child a scorpion
[time=2779] when that little unassuming, defenseless child that only asked for an egg.
[time=2791] Paul in Romans 9 spoke about great sorrow and unceasing grief in his heart.
[time=2796] In Romans 8 he talked about groaning within himself longing for the release of this world and its fallen condition.
[time=2803] In 2 Corinthians 5 he talked about being burdened and how he longed to get off planet Earth and be in the presence of God.
[time=2810] Paul knew all about the hurt and the pain and the sorrow and the grief.
[time=2814] And God hasn't promised to answer our prayers in ways that are necessarily delightful or immediately fun
[time=2821] or that would make us happy that is entirely superficial and he loves us far beyond that kind of commitment.
[time=2832] No matter how he answers your prayer, the choice is yours to say, you know what, it's not a scorpion and it's not a snake.
[time=2839] And how can I be sure?
[time=2841] Verse 13, "If then being evil you know how to give good gifts to your children how much more sure your heavenly father know."
[time=2849] Grab ahold of the human emotions that fill the hearts of moms and dads across the world and every culture and every language and every tribe
[time=2857] and every trunk. God has shown at some degree a measure of his love and his affection for you through the normal processes of parenting.
[time=2866] And if human fallen sons of Adam with hearts of Genesis 6.5 and Jeremiah 17.9 can know not to give a scorpion when an egg has been requested.
[time=2877] Can't a pure righteous, holy, sinless, godly creator of the heavens and the earth be trusted not to give a scorpion or a snake?
[time=2887] And the answer of course is yes.
[time=2891] Imagine how much greater your heavenly father's capacity is to give you what is good than even the best of human fathers.
[time=2900] And it's hard. When circumstances go wrong, it's hard.
[time=2905] We have within us such a demandingness to see our dreams come true, such an unwillingness to subordinate our plan to the plan of God.
[time=2913] It is so hard to say that kingdom come by will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[time=2917] It's much easier to pray my will be done and make all of heaven move to meet it.
[time=2924] Isaiah 49 tells of the circumstance when the children of God were being exiled in the Babylonian captivity.
[time=2931] And in verse 14 of Isaiah 49 it says, "But Zion said the Lord has forsaken me and the Lord has forgotten me."
[time=2938] That's how we feel, isn't it? When our life doesn't go the way that we think it ought to go, what are you doing?
[time=2946] And Jesus, I mean God answers back and Isaiah 49 to that complaint by saying this, "Can a woman forget her nursing child and have no compassion on the son of her womb?
[time=2959] Even these may forget, but I will not forget you. Behold, I have inscribed you on the palms of my hand."
[time=2969] I have branded myself with your name.
[time=2974] And it is possible as it is for a normal, healthy, functioning mother to forget a child that nurses.
[time=2984] Or have compassion on the son that she herself has born.
[time=2989] That's how possible it is for me to forget you, the one who has branded you, and to my very personage.
[time=2998] God is appealing to us in this passage and in others to trust Him and to so interpret the events of our lives.
[time=3005] And even as earthly fathers won't give, and earthly mothers won't give harm instead of blessing neither,
[time=3011] and by infinitely, neither will a heavenly Father who is pure and righteous and holy and just.
[time=3017] Remember the words of Tozer?
[time=3021] What comes into our minds when we think about God is the most important thing about us.
[time=3032] Any thoughts? Any contemplation? Any meditation about God?
[time=3038] Has anything other than a gracious, compassionate, loving, righteous, holy Father who is committed to answer every one of your prayers?
[time=3047] In a way that causes you to look like Christ is a dangerous, life-threatening, joy-stealing thought.
[time=3058] And it is the point of first repentance.
[time=3062] Hebrews 11-6.
[time=3064] Without faith, it is impossible to please God.
[time=3068] Now why? For He who comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him.
[time=3076] And that, in Hebrews 11, a chapter full of people getting sawn in two, martyred left and right,
[time=3086] wandering like aliens and strangers.
[time=3092] Without faith, is it impossible to please Him?
[time=3095] If you determine your understanding of the character and the nature of God dependent upon how He makes your life work like you look,
[time=3102] you are in trouble forever.
[time=3109] It's hard, isn't it? One last thought and I love it. Look in verse 13.
[time=3114] This is amazing. At the end of verse 13, if you then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children.
[time=3119] How much more? Now watch. How much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him?
[time=3125] What is that about? Who asked for the Holy Spirit?
[time=3129] Do you realize there is no text anywhere in the New Testament that ever calls us to pray for the Holy Spirit?
[time=3135] He is in fact given to us whether we like it or not at the point of salvation.
[time=3139] He seals us in the body of Christ. He baptizes us in the body of Christ.
[time=3143] The only real commands about the Holy Spirit and us are that we be filled with the Holy Spirit, which means we submit to Him,
[time=3150] and not to grieve the Holy Spirit, which just means when He's telling us to do something, we do it.
[time=3154] But we are never told to ask for the Holy Spirit.
[time=3158] So what is He doing here? Much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him?
[time=3167] Hmm.
[time=3170] Well I'll tell you what I think He's saying. He's saying, you know what?
[time=3176] Not only will I not give you a snake, not only will I not give you a scorpion, I will give you me.
[time=3187] I will give you the manifest representation of the power of the Holy Spirit in your heart.
[time=3194] In other words, whether the prayer is to help your child, or to give you wisdom in your business,
[time=3201] or to help you faithfully love your wife, or to find a life made, I mean whatever the request may be,
[time=3208] what God is promising to give not only is not a scorpion and a snake, he is promising to give you himself.
[time=3215] And who can want more?
[time=3218] Whatever the request, the answer is always the same.
[time=3221] The answer is always the provision of God Himself, Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[time=3229] Wow.
[time=3231] What a way to live.
[time=3237] So let me ask you again, are you scratching around in the dirt for seeds and insects thrashing a brow no more
[time=3244] than a few feet off the ground when in reality you and I have been built to soar into the heavens,
[time=3250] to walk in constant communion with God, to pray without ceasing.
[time=3257] To pray, oh hallowed be thy name, you are the great God and I boast in you, and my hope is in you, not in that of horses and chariots.
[time=3264] I know your character.
[time=3267] To pray, oh God, not my will, but your will be done.
[time=3270] Let me prostrate all of my hopes and my dreams at the advancement of your kingdom.
[time=3275] Do anything you want in my life so long as it advances your kingdom.
[time=3279] And God along the way, thanks for the chance to tell you about my needs, my problems, the struggles of my real life existence down here on planet earth.
[time=3289] And thank you, God, for forgiving my sins and oh God, please give me wisdom.
[time=3294] Leave me not in the temptation.
[time=3296] And how often should we pray like that? All the time.
[time=3300] We don't have this time this morning to go through it all, but if you'll look through scripture you'll find the people of God praying in the morning.
[time=3305] They pray at noon, they pray at night, some pray seven times a day, some pray at midnight, some pray all night, before dawn.
[time=3311] They pray for weeks at a time, they pray on their knees, standing up, lying on a bed, lying face down on the ground, hands up, hands down,
[time=3318] hands down, face down, face up, you name it anytime, anyway, always praying.
[time=3327] And what is the promise that comes with your prayer?
[time=3330] Ask and you shall receive.
[time=3333] Seek and you shall find.
[time=3336] Knock and it shall be opened unto you.
[time=3338] I want you to go away this morning with renewed conviction that you have never once in your life prayed a prayer that God has not only heard but has answered.
[time=3349] And it leaves us then with a perspective issue, doesn't it?
[time=3352] Who's in charge?
[time=3354] And how will we interpret his response?
[time=3357] Will it be to us a snake or a scorpion?
[time=3361] Will we allow the evil one to come and so pervert our perspective of the holy nature of God and his sovereign provision in our life that we can take what actually is meant to be efficient in an egg as a loving father would respond to the request of his child and somehow turn it into what it isn't?
[time=3375] A snake and a scorpion and let it defeat us and destroy us and take our hope?
[time=3381] Or is God truly able to cause all things to work together for good to those who love him and are called according to his purpose?
[time=3388] Again, the choice is yours, the choice is mine.
[time=3392] He says, "I will give not only good to the one I love, I will give him myself.
[time=3400] I will be there.
[time=3401] I will live in the midst of you as you live your life.
[time=3404] I will be with you every minute of every day." So, let's pray.
[time=3410] Let's pray without ceasing.
[time=3412] Let me invite you to stand.
[time=3419] Father in heaven, this series is about along the way.
[time=3422] You know how we're going to treat each other as a church on this trip, our existence together.
[time=3430] Father, you have called us to have elders that are in charge and that lead and you've called us to have people that are responsive and follow and make even that a joy to their leadership.
[time=3443] You have called us to encourage one another, to look across the landscape of our church and find the one who is faint and build him up, the one who is discouraged and give him encouragement, the one who is weak and give him strength that we should interact with each other in points of felt need
[time=3459] to minister to one another.
[time=3462] And as we make this great journey together, you have called us to be rejoicing always and to be thankful for everything.
[time=3470] And now this morning, you call us again to bring it all to you in prayer all the time.
[time=3476] Praying the way you have taught us to pray, praying as often as you have taught us to pray.
[time=3480] Knowing you'll always answer our prayers and praying knowing that it is ours to interpret your responses in ways that are consistent with your nature.
[time=3489] A church that does that, a church that has the family meeting from time to time and says let's do it like the Bible says.
[time=3498] Let's see it like the Word of God tells us to see it.
[time=3502] It will be a church that is greatly and mightily used of God and it will be a church where the people therein are full of joy and excitement and hope and optimism for it is a great God we serve.
[time=3515] Help us to take this trip in that manner for your glory and for your honor.
[time=3521] We pray these things in the name of Christ and all God's people say. Amen.
