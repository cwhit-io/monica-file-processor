[time=371] (applause) [AMEN] Hey, good morning, everybody.
[time=377] Good to see you.
[time=378] Why don't you just take a minute and you don't have to stand up, or you can if you'd like, but just reach back behind you, or next to you, and say hello, and welcome the person sitting there by you.
[time=387] Tell them that you're glad they're here.
[time=389] (audience chattering)
[time=400] Hey, some really important things going on in the life of our church, and we don't want you to miss out on any of it, so please make sure you open up your bulletin this morning.
[time=408] There's a couple of inserts here we want to draw your attention to.
[time=411] Very important stuff, and we want you to be a part of it if you can.
[time=416] First of all, you'll see the Kosovo Blackhawk is participating in closed for Kosovo, insert, please.
[time=424] Take a look at this.
[time=425] This is a great opportunity.
[time=426] Blackhawk is kind of functioning as the regional drop point for northeast Fort Wayne in this relief for Kosovo, closed for Kosovo relief effort.
[time=437] It's in conjunction with Slavic Gospel Association and other local churches and clothing items and shoes and toiletries.
[time=446] You see a list there of things that are needed.
[time=448] These are being gathered over in our north campus lobby there, and we really could use your help in a number of different ways, one of which is we'd love for us as a church to participate in the effort, and so we would encourage you this morning.
[time=462] Please take a look at the items that are needed, and if there are some things around your home that you could box up or bag up and bring by, we'd love to have it.
[time=472] It's been a great week so far.
[time=474] We sent 165 boxes, big boxes, full of things that came in just Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and we're looking forward to another big week.
[time=483] Secondly, we could really use your help.
[time=486] We could really use your help at the volunteer level.
[time=488] You can imagine when all these things come in.
[time=491] As it says there at the bottom, we need people who can bring empty boxes.
[time=495] We need folks who can come by for just an hour, maybe two during the week, and help us box up clothes, help us tape them, help us label.
[time=504] There's just a lot of work to be done, and we want to just give you the family of Black Hawk the chance to be a part of that.
[time=510] So there's a table out in the foyer.
[time=512] We'd love for you to just go by the table.
[time=514] Kathy Andrews and Linda Archer are out there this morning, and they'll take your name sometime during the week.
[time=519] Could you come by and spare an hour or two to help box items?
[time=523] We'd love to have the help, and it'll help in the bigger picture of the project as a whole.
[time=528] So thanks.
[time=529] Also, summer children's ministry.
[time=531] Again, Greg Deeson and the summer and the children's ministry leadership team, they're gearing up for a big, big summer.
[time=539] Veggie Tales is the theme for the summer, 13 weeks worth of stuff, and they are rare to go, and again, need your help.
[time=547] Need our help as a family.
[time=548] You know that at Black Hawk, we have children's ministry workers that work for nine months straight every Sunday, and then we give them, excuse me, the summer off.
[time=558] So it's time now to recruit our summer ministry team for those kids, and there's a card there for you.
[time=564] What Greg is asking is for nine weeks, if you could give nine weeks to the children's ministries and take four off, there's a place there for you to fill out those four Sundays you might like off.
[time=576] You can mark what age group you'd like to work with, and then fill this card out, and if you would, please put it in the offering plate this morning, or hold on to it this week, and fill it out and bring it back next Sunday and put it in the plate.
[time=589] We'd love to have your help, it's going to be a great summer, and they need us, so let's do our best to step up and help out with the kids, all right?
[time=597] Also, just an important note at the congregational business meeting last Sunday evening, April 18th, the vote was 90% approval to proceed with phase six in the Horizon Building Project.
[time=609] We're thankful for those of you that came, and thankful for what God did that night, and looking forward to seeing construction beginning soon on that project, and then lastly this morning, before we spend some time worshiping, we want to say welcome to those of you who are here for the first time.
[time=624] You are our guest, we're always glad and thankful for the chance to spend a morning like this with someone who is new, we hope that you feel welcome.
[time=633] You can fill out the visitor card in the Pew Rack, right in front of you, if you'd like to, you don't have to, we'd love to hear from you in that respect.
[time=641] Also, following second hour this morning, second service through these doors and to the left is our visitor center, there's folks there that would love to meet you and give you more information about our church, but just know that we're glad you're here and hope to see you again.
[time=655] Well, let's praise the Lord this morning, let's thank Him from our hearts and spend some time worshiping Him together.
[time=668] [MUSIC] I will celebrate, sing unto the Lord [MUSIC] Sing to the Lord, my new song [MUSIC] I will celebrate, sing unto the Lord [MUSIC] Sing to the Lord, my new song [MUSIC] I will celebrate, sing unto the Lord [MUSIC] Sing to the Lord, my new song [MUSIC] I will celebrate, sing unto the Lord [MUSIC] Sing to the Lord, my new song [MUSIC] With my heart, rejoicing with me [MUSIC] With my mind focused on Him [MUSIC] With my hands raised to the hands of I am [MUSIC] Worship me here [MUSIC] I will celebrate, sing unto the Lord [MUSIC] Sing to the Lord, my new song [MUSIC] I will celebrate, sing unto the Lord [MUSIC] Sing to the Lord, my new song [MUSIC] With my heart rejoicing with me [MUSIC] With my heart focused on Him [MUSIC] With my hands raised to the hands of I am [MUSIC] Worship me here [MUSIC] I will celebrate, sing unto the Lord [MUSIC] Sing to the Lord, my new song [MUSIC] I will celebrate, sing unto the Lord [MUSIC] Sing to the Lord, my new song [MUSIC] I will celebrate, sing unto the Lord [MUSIC] Sing to the Lord, my new song [MUSIC] I will celebrate, sing unto the Lord [MUSIC] Sing to the Lord, my new song [MUSIC] I will celebrate, sing unto the Lord [MUSIC] Sing to the Lord, my new song [MUSIC] I will celebrate, sing unto the Lord [MUSIC] Sing to the Lord, my new song [MUSIC] Sing to the Lord, my new song [MUSIC] Jesus, me celebrate your victory [MUSIC] Jesus, we revel in your love [MUSIC] Jesus [MUSIC] We rejoice, you set us free [MUSIC] Jesus, your death has brought us love [MUSIC] Jesus [MUSIC] We celebrate your victory [MUSIC] Jesus [MUSIC] We revel in your love [MUSIC] Jesus [MUSIC] We rejoice, you set us free [MUSIC] Jesus, your death has brought us love [MUSIC] It was for freedom [MUSIC] Christ has set us free [MUSIC] No longer to be studied [MUSIC] To be of the flame of rain [MUSIC] So we rejoice in God's victory [MUSIC] Our hearts respond into His light [MUSIC] Jesus [MUSIC] We celebrate your victory [MUSIC] Jesus [MUSIC] We revel in your love [MUSIC] Jesus [MUSIC] We rejoice, you set us free [MUSIC] Jesus, your death has brought us love [MUSIC] Jesus [MUSIC] We celebrate your victory [MUSIC] Jesus [MUSIC] We revel in your love [MUSIC] Jesus [MUSIC] We rejoice, you set us free [MUSIC] Jesus, your death has brought us love [MUSIC] Jesus [MUSIC] We celebrate your victory [MUSIC] Jesus [MUSIC] We revel in your love [MUSIC] Jesus [MUSIC] We rejoice, you set us free [MUSIC] Jesus, your death has brought us love [MUSIC] Oh, Jesus, your death has brought us love â™ª
[time=1020] [MUSIC - 133 seconds]
[time=1156] We can do on our own to make us good enough to make us clean enough to take our way our own sin to stand in the presence of a holy God.
[time=1166] [MUSIC]
[time=1168] But you have clothed us with righteousness, covered us with mercy, showered us with your great love.
[time=1176] But for that we give you glory, honor and praise. We love you and we worship you. We stand in your presence this morning to adore you. Amen.
[time=1191] [MUSIC - 505 seconds]
[time=1714] When you agree with something, I think you say amen. Amen? Wow, what a great time. Let me invite you to pray. And the gentlemen are going to come forward. Father, thank you. You are a great God.
[time=1725] And we agree with that this morning. And God, our hearts are full of the realization of that very thing. And in a week, you know, that we've had here in this country full of so much tragedy and heartache. God, it is so nice to come together and be reminded of your providence and your love and your control and you being as great as you are. And though sometimes that's confusing for us, God, to sing about it.
[time=1754] To sing about it this morning. And to be reminded of these truths, it's been good for our hearts. And we are thankful for the chance to give to you monetarily, yes, but God in our hearts as well this morning. And it is our commitment to continue in these next minutes, worshiping you and thanking you for who you are and what you've done. And all God's people said amen. You may be seated.
[time=1779] [ Pause ]
[time=1799] Then I looked and heard the voice of many angels numbering thousands upon thousands and 10,000 times, 10,000.
[time=1807] They circled the throne in the living creatures and the elders and allowed voice. They sang worthy in the land who was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and praise.
[time=1822] Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea and all that is in them singing to him who sits on the throne and to the land be praised and honored and glory and power forever and ever.
[time=1838] [MUSIC]
[time=1868] You are beautiful beyond descriptions, to marvelous for words, to wonderful for comprehension, like nothing ever seen.
[time=1897] Ever seen or heard, who can grasp your infinite wisdom, who can fathom the depth of your love.
[time=1914] You are beautiful beyond description, majesty and throne of love.
[time=1926] I stand, I stand, in all of you, I stand, I stand, in all of you.
[time=1938] All I stand, I stand, in all of you.
[time=2003] You receive glory, glory and honor, glory and honor and power.
[time=2018] All I stand, in all of you, I stand, in all of you.
[time=2034] All I stand, in all of you.
[time=2085] All I stand, in all of you, I stand, in all of you.
[time=2112] All I stand, in all of you.
[time=2244] Let me invite you to take your Bible this morning and open it to 1 Thessalonians 5.
[time=2250] We've been looking now for about 7 weeks at a section of just 11 verses.
[time=2256] That prior I must confess to my own study of this book I hardly knew they were in existence, but having looked at them,
[time=2264] they raised to a whole new level of importance in my mind and in my heart.
[time=2269] We've entitled this section Along the Way, Along the Way, Vital Instruction to the Church,
[time=2276] as to how they should treat each other along the way.
[time=2280] Way back in February, Kelly kicked the series off for us by telling us of the 8 courageous climbers who made it to the top of Mount Everest.
[time=2291] We gained a sense of the exhilaration and interdependence and community.
[time=2296] All 8 of them had as they finally standing on the summit gave each other bear hugs.
[time=2301] They were crying tears that froze on their cheeks, they were giving high fives, indescribable sense of accomplishment.
[time=2310] Having celebrated there on the top of the mountain and now ready to make the descent down, one of them said this, as we got up to crawl back down this beast of a mountain that had humbled us for a month.
[time=2322] I thought to myself one last time, I am so glad that I am not alone.
[time=2330] This young Thessalonian Church is at the bottom of the mountain looking up.
[time=2336] The Great Commission, as it were, stands awesome and magnificent before them.
[time=2342] They are full of optimism and hope and good cheer.
[time=2346] Paul knows, however, having made the climb several times already himself, they have no idea
[time=2352] the struggles, trials and hardships they will encounter as they seek to ascend this great mountain.
[time=2359] Paul knows the going will get tough.
[time=2362] And their only hope, his greatest concern and most repeated call to the New Testament Church is unity.
[time=2371] Do it together.
[time=2374] This brand new little church knows nothing of the legalism that later filled Galatia or the heresy that found its way into the church at Colossae.
[time=2382] They don't know anything yet about the carnality that ran rampant in Corinth.
[time=2386] The apostasy that confronted those folks addressed in the Book of Hebrews.
[time=2391] The suffering the churches in dispersion encountered as Peter wrote to them, the dead faith of the Book of James, the soon to be lost love in the church at Ephesus.
[time=2403] They are too new to know anything about it.
[time=2406] So Paul gives them an advance traveling instructions along the way, be sure to take care of each other.
[time=2413] As you get stuck in root as it were, stranded with your 27 pieces of luggage, don't get so focused on the objective that you hurt, bite and devour each other along the way.
[time=2426] And so Paul calls a huddle up session.
[time=2430] And in these 11 verses he gives them specific instruction that I will briefly review that we've looked at.
[time=2435] It's all about attitude.
[time=2437] Along the way he says, be careful about your attitude toward the leadership.
[time=2441] Remember that verses 12 to 13?
[time=2444] He tells them now along the way make sure you appreciate them and esteem them very highly.
[time=2450] Follow their leadership and live in peace with one another.
[time=2455] In verses 14 to 15 he says, be careful about your attitude toward one another.
[time=2461] Along the way different folks are going to struggle with different things.
[time=2467] Give them insightful loving individualized help.
[time=2471] To the unruly you must admonish them.
[time=2473] The faint-hearted you must encourage them.
[time=2475] The weak you must give them help.
[time=2478] And then he says, be patient to all.
[time=2480] Never repaying evil for evil.
[time=2484] He knows along the way they need to be careful about their attitude toward God.
[time=2489] And we found that in verses 16, 17 and 18.
[time=2492] As you're climbing this great mountain called the Great Commission.
[time=2496] And as the storms break and it becomes windy and cold and discouraging and desolate.
[time=2503] Rejoice always he says.
[time=2506] In everything give thanks to your God.
[time=2509] And keep praying never disconnect your heart and your mind from constant communion with God along the way.
[time=2516] In verse 19 he says, be careful about your attitude toward the Holy Spirit.
[time=2521] Don't quench the Holy Spirit.
[time=2523] If you think for one moment that you can get to the top of this mountain on your own strength having quenched or put out the fire of the passion and the power and the ministry of the Holy Spirit in your life you're gravely mistaken.
[time=2538] This journey will be made by those who fan the flame of the Holy Spirit in their heart.
[time=2543] And then he said in verse 20, along the way be careful about your attitude toward the Word.
[time=2550] Following faithfully the Word of God will take you as a church in some directions you wouldn't otherwise want to go.
[time=2556] It will set a path to climb the Great Commission in ways you might not have chosen but never despise the Word of God.
[time=2564] Even though following it at times will lead you to places of confusion and hardship.
[time=2569] Never treat the Word of God as nothing but instead honor it, obey it, study it and memorize it.
[time=2577] And now this morning we come to the last of his traveling instructions.
[time=2581] The last piece of the puzzle if you will and it is a call to holiness.
[time=2587] Be careful he says in verse 22, abstain from every form of evil.
[time=2595] Abstain from every form of evil.
[time=2599] The word abstain means to hold yourself back from it.
[time=2603] It's the imagery of using yourself to hold yourself back to shun.
[time=2609] And it gives emphasis to the complete separation of the believer from what is evil.
[time=2615] Evil needs little definition.
[time=2618] It is that cancer that works injury and disaster to all who touch it.
[time=2623] Abstain from every form of it.
[time=2627] Form means every kind, every sort, every species, every shape of evil.
[time=2633] If you're going to make it to the top and if you're going to get there together and if you're going to be a prevailing church that has the pleasure of God on you,
[time=2640] you must abstain from every form, every expression, every type of evil.
[time=2648] Just surveying that in my mind this week, covetousness and greed and lust and anger and jealousy and envy.
[time=2655] The love of money and selfishness, pride, self-righteousness and disbelief.
[time=2660] The inner forms of evil.
[time=2663] But there are the outer, the strife, the fights, the dissensions, the gossip, the fashions, the outbursts of anger, drunkenness,
[time=2671] carousing, lying, blasphemy, idolatry, murder, fordication, adultery, stealing, reviling, sorcery.
[time=2681] Every possible form, expression of evil known to man and they are many.
[time=2687] False teachers, false doctrine and heresies.
[time=2691] Hold yourself back.
[time=2694] Hold yourself away. Do not move towards any expression of the cancers of evil that are known to men.
[time=2702] That's his call.
[time=2705] You want to climb this mountain?
[time=2707] You want to reach the peak of the great commission.
[time=2709] You want to become a prevailing church that successfully disciples people, introduces seekers to the gospel and then helps them understand the power and the liberating experience of knowing Jesus Christ.
[time=2722] And you want to do that through the years, through thick and through thin, from an experienced mountain climber like Paul,
[time=2728] he says listen.
[time=2730] There are some things you've got to be careful to do.
[time=2733] And though you're young and though you're fresh and though you're naive and though you haven't gotten them all yet, trouble is on its way.
[time=2739] Hardship will inevitably come and along the way you must be careful to do these many things.
[time=2744] Not the least of which is this abstinence from every form of evil.
[time=2751] Hold yourself back.
[time=2753] So this morning I want to answer the question how?
[time=2757] How? How is it that we learn to hold ourselves back from every form of evil?
[time=2763] And I will give you three basic things that come to my heart and mind as I look at the New Testament in its totality.
[time=2769] Three basic truths that are there about how an individual holds himself back from evil.
[time=2777] First you've got to get help.
[time=2779] Secondly you've got to learn to hate it.
[time=2781] By that I mean evil and then thirdly you must be committed to being drastic.
[time=2788] Get help, hate it, and be drastic.
[time=2791] Let's look at the first point this morning, get help.
[time=2794] When I say that you must get help if you are going to be successful in holding yourself back from evil,
[time=2800] I do not mean by that go get yourself a more insightful counselor.
[time=2804] They are helpful but that is not what I mean.
[time=2807] By getting help I don't mean get yourself into a new or different environment as if the solution can be found in your circumstances.
[time=2816] I do not mean to find a better therapy group, not opposed to that, it's just not enough.
[time=2824] When I say get help, I am talking about the saving, transforming, life-changing grace of God that comes only through Jesus Christ.
[time=2837] The starting point for walking away from the injurious disastrous destructive power of sin is coming to the one who Hebrews 2 14 says has rendered powerless him who had the power of death.
[time=2851] That is the devil.
[time=2854] You want to hold yourself back from every form of evil you must begin by admitting that you are not enough.
[time=2862] You do not have the inner resources and strength to accomplish that in and of yourself.
[time=2871] The Bible gives two amazing pictures of the absolute power of sin in a person's life.
[time=2877] The first is the claustrophobic imagery of being confined and imprisoned,
[time=2883] being behind the walls and the bars of sin themselves. And this I speak now to the person who does not yet know Christ.
[time=2892] You cannot even hope to hold yourself back from sin for you are locked and it's very domain.
[time=2900] That is the first picture of the claustrophobic nature of the all-encompassing power of sin.
[time=2908] It is described as a domain in which we live. Ephesians 2 1 says, "And you were dead in your trespasses and sin."
[time=2917] The word "in" in the Greek it's a locket of sphere. It describes a dimension, a domain or a sphere composed of trespasses and sin.
[time=2928] They are the boundary markers in much the same way that we know the domain of gravity.
[time=2934] Go anywhere you want. Go into the ocean, go to the valley, go to the mountaintop.
[time=2938] You cannot escape the domain of gravity. And so it is the Bible describes the domain of trespasses and sins.
[time=2946] How can you hold yourself back from something that is the divining characteristic of your very environment, your very sphere, your very domain?
[time=2956] It talks about in Ephesians 2 in which you formally walked according to the course of this world.
[time=2962] The unsaved person walks in the sphere of sin and trespass as a way of life.
[time=2967] It is the very essence of life to be dead in trespasses and sins.
[time=2974] It has two expressions. The Bible tells us there are two kinds of ways to live, you know, that people live in the domain.
[time=2982] They're both in the domain of sin, but it looks differently.
[time=2985] One Romans 1 tells us is the outward immoral expression of lust and dishonesty and drunkenness and idolatry.
[time=2993] The obvious commitment to live according to the things of this world bound up and encompassed, living and acting all their life in this sphere of sin.
[time=3003] The other is in Romans 2, and that is the self-righteous domain of sin. It is just as sinful.
[time=3009] It is just as corrupt. It is just as damaging and dangerous as the Romans 1.
[time=3014] But it looks different. It has the pretense of righteousness. It has religion written all over it.
[time=3020] It is the show of goodness and uprightness, but the heart of the Romans 2 expression is full of covetousness and greed.
[time=3027] And it loves money and it is full of jealousy and anger. It is proud and it is hypocritical.
[time=3033] Every human being that has ever lived has been born into the domain, the sphere of sin and lives out.
[time=3039] Either Romans 1, the wanton open expression of sinfulness, or the Romans 2, the hypocritical self-righteous religious expression, which is a whitewash tomb full of a dead man's bones.
[time=3052] The hard, corrupt, deceitful, wicked heart of self-righteousness. There is no escaping the domain of sin, and there is no escaping a life that gives expression to it in either one or the other of these ways.
[time=3069] So get help. Get help.
[time=3074] Ephesians 2 goes on after having described this deplorable state of being locked in the prison of sin, the domain of sin, by saying that God moves us from the domain of trespass and sin and death and allows us to walk in the grace and the life of Christ.
[time=3094] But God, the verse reads, but God gives us grace and life in Christ.
[time=3101] The other horrifying picture of the power of sin that is depicted in the New Testament is that of slavery.
[time=3108] It's not a domain as we just saw. The other picture is that of slavery in Romans 6, but thanks be to God that though you were slaves to sin.
[time=3119] Can I hold yourself back from that which owns you, from that which possesses you, from that which is your heartless, cruel, destructive task master?
[time=3128] Sin is not something that without the power of Christ you can say, I will not do you anymore. I will not obey you anymore. You are the slave of sin.
[time=3136] And it ruins every moment of every day. It pollutes every motive. It colors every thought. It affects every action and would destroy every relationship in your life.
[time=3147] In Genesis 6 verse 5 it says this, "Then the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth."
[time=3153] And here it is, "that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually." How do you walk away from sin when the intent of the thought of your heart is only evil continually?
[time=3164] When you are a slave to sin, when your every thought, every action, every impulse, every motive and every action is tainted, colored and polluted by your master sin itself.
[time=3176] Jeremiah 17-9 says, "The heart is more deceitful than all else and is desperately sick." Who can understand it?
[time=3185] The Bible tells us that all of the thoughts and the intentions, all of the actions, all of the behaviors, all that make us what we are is bound up in our heart.
[time=3194] That Jeremiah 17-9, "The heart is more deceitful than all else and is desperately sick."
[time=3201] Selfishness, pride, taking care of me, infects every aspect of my life. It owns me. It is my task, master. It is my owner. I am its slave.
[time=3217] You see, this is the picture. This is the description of the power of sin in the life of an individual.
[time=3227] So much so that Paul cries out in Romans chapter 7 verse 24 by saying, "Wretched man that I am, who will set me free from the body of this death?"
[time=3236] Paul knew. Paul knew the resource to walk away from sin was not within himself.
[time=3241] And so he cries out at the end of that verse, "Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord." The Bible says that there is hope for freedom from the power of sin only in Jesus Christ.
[time=3253] Psalm 130 reads, "Out of the depths I have cried to thee, O Lord, Lord, hear my voice, let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications, if thou, Lord, shouldst mark iniquities, O Lord."
[time=3267] Who could stand? But there is forgiveness with thee that thou mayst be feared.
[time=3272] I wait for the Lord. My soul does wait, and in his word do I hope.
[time=3278] The Bible is clear. There is but one place to turn for this help. If you are to walk away from all the forms of evil, and there are many expressions.
[time=3292] There is a great group of people who were locked and bound and imprisoned in their sin.
[time=3299] They were slaves to unrighteousness. They lived every moment of every day, slaves to the power of sin.
[time=3309] They were called the Corinthians. They were described as those who were the fornicators, the idolaters, the adulterers, the effeminate, the homosexuals, the thieves.
[time=3321] They were covetous. They were drunkards. They were revilers. They were swindlers.
[time=3327] It was an amazing group of people. They lived in a city that itself, the very name, came to speak of pornography.
[time=3333] Corinth became synonymous. The city was so completely given over.
[time=3338] It was a totally depraved city that had given full sway to the Romans one expression of the power and the domain of sin.
[time=3351] But it says there in their story, their first Corinthians chapter 6 verse 11, and such were some of you.
[time=3361] That's who you used to be. That's who you used to like. That's who you used to act. That's who you used to live.
[time=3369] That used to be the very expression of your heart.
[time=3372] And such were some of you but, and there it is, the great but of Scripture, but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.
[time=3385] And these who had been so fully and totally and completely given over to this list of sins through the power of Jesus Christ found a completely and totally different way to live.
[time=3398] And they were, as the Bible tells us, transferred. Colossians 1, 13 says they were transferred.
[time=3405] That God, that Jesus Christ delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of His beloved Son.
[time=3413] And where they had been born, as all of us are, to live in the sphere of trespasses and sins.
[time=3419] And where they had, because of the wickedness of their hearts, been enslaved to the power of sin, as all of us have been.
[time=3426] And though that had given full expression to the most vile kinds of sins as a regular pattern and walking course of their life, they had found, in Jesus Christ, the power, the help,
[time=3442] to not only curtail certain behaviors, but to be utterly and completely delivered from the domain of darkness and transferred into the kingdom of His beloved Son.
[time=3452] So if you will, ever in your mind, contemplate of staining, holding yourself back.
[time=3460] You must first understand that in and of yourself, you have no resource to do it.
[time=3466] And you are helpless and hopelessly lost to a power and to a domain that is greater than you.
[time=3473] And if you are honest with yourself, you will know that the power of sin is not only present in your life, apart from the power of Christ.
[time=3480] It is not only present, but it is gaining momentum.
[time=3486] It is finding a tighter and more complete and more comprehensive grip, whether it's the Romans 1 expression, and you find yourself increasingly more sinful over time, or whether it is the Romans 2 expression, and you find yourself more smugly content in the self-righteousness and proud arrogance of your heart to say,
[time=3507] "I have no need. I am sufficient. My life is sufficient to be acceptable to God."
[time=3514] It is a wicked, powerful, all-encompassing, destructive, devastating force the power of sin.
[time=3526] So get help if you haven't already.
[time=3530] Give your life to Jesus Christ, and he breaks the power of sin, and he renders as powerless the one who had the power of death, Satan himself.
[time=3540] And then he takes residence in your heart, and then you begin to live.
[time=3547] Secondly, and now this, having laid that as a foundation in the first point now for all of us who have already given our lives to Christ and found the liberating power, the next call is to hate it.
[time=3563] You want to know how to hold yourself back from every form of evil? You must learn to hate it.
[time=3568] Romans 12-9 says, "Abhor what is evil, cling to what is good."
[time=3575] In Hebrews 1-9, it is said of the Son, Jesus Christ, "Thou hast loved righteousness and hated lawlessness.
[time=3583] Therefore, God thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy companions."
[time=3589] The unique characteristic of the heart of Christ was that he loved righteousness, and from his heart he hated lawlessness.
[time=3599] In Psalm 97-10, the call goes out, "Hate evil. You who love the Lord hate evil."
[time=3610] In Proverbs 8-13, the text says, "The fear of the Lord is to hate evil."
[time=3617] Pride and arrogance and the evil way, and the perverted mouth, "I hate."
[time=3624] In Micah 3-2, the people are condemned by the Lord because they have reversed it.
[time=3629] He says to them, "You hate good and you love evil."
[time=3635] The stuff that really stirs your heart, the stuff that really captures your affection is the evil.
[time=3642] And what you've come to hate is the good.
[time=3646] You see, when God calls us to abstain from every form of evil, he is not just saying the outward expression of evil as if we were to become hypocrites.
[time=3655] And he is not saying, "Just learn to hate the consequences of sin," which is what most of us do.
[time=3661] He is saying, "From the heart learn to hate the sin itself." How often do you and I fall into the subtlety of hating only the consequences of sin, the conviction that it brings to our heart?
[time=3676] The exposure that it brings as people see and find out.
[time=3681] The negative consequences of sin are certainly to be hated and to be avoided, and they are certainly a motive not to be involved in sin of the believer.
[time=3689] But God says, "Don't let that be what motivates you. Learn to hate sin from your heart just because it's sin."
[time=3697] I love Romans 6, 17 and 18, bringing these thoughts together, Paul says, "But thanks be to God that though you were slaves to sin, you became obedient where from the heart to that form of teaching which you were committed."
[time=3712] And having been freed from sin, you became slaves of righteousness. It's one or the other, my friends.
[time=3718] We are either in bondage to sin or we are in bondage to righteousness, and the key is the matter of the heart.
[time=3725] And God has never invited people to play Christianity, to live as hypocrites, and to secretly and inwardly love sin, but for the sake of their reputation or by virtue of peer pressure alone abstain from it.
[time=3740] He calls us to a heart transformation of literally hating sin from the inside out.
[time=3747] In 1 Samuel 16, 7, "But the Lord said to Samuel, 'Do not look at his appearance, or the height of his stature, because I have rejected him.'"
[time=3756] Why? For God sees not as man sees, for man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at his heart.
[time=3764] The standard, my friends, at which we would hold ourselves back from sin is not merely the outward expression of it, nor hating it because of the consequences it brings to our life, but being true, genuine, authentic sin haters from the heart.
[time=3779] Then we begin to approximate the standard and the call of Christianity in our lives.
[time=3783] 1 Kings 839 says, "Then here thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive and act, and render to each according to all his ways, whose heart thou knowest, for thou alone does know the hearts of all the sons of men."
[time=3800] 1 Chronicles 28.9, "As for you my son Solomon, know the God of your father, and serve him how, with a whole heart and a willing mind.
[time=3811] For the Lord searches your heart, and understands every intent of the thoughts, if you seek him he will let you find him, but if you forsake him he will reject you forever."
[time=3823] And this is not an external legalistic ritual thing we do inside of Christianity.
[time=3831] And the internal dynamics are not just the proactive love of the grace of God and the forgiveness in Christ and the wonders and the glories of heaven, it is the inverse of that, the natural consequence of that, a genuine hatred of sin.
[time=3846] Not just the sin we see in Kosovo or in Colorado, but the sin we see in our own hearts.
[time=3854] 2 Chronicles 6.9, "For the eyes of the Lord move to and fro throughout the earth that he may strongly support those whose heart is completely his."
[time=3867] You have acted foolishly in this, indeed from now on, you will surely have wars, why?
[time=3875] Because he thought it was enough to give the Lord external obedience, external compliance.
[time=3882] The Lord seeks what the Lord actively looks for.
[time=3888] He moves to and throw throughout the entire earth, he is looking for a heart that is his.
[time=3895] That is the shocking penetrating truth of the Sermon on the Mount.
[time=3899] And Jesus stood before a whole generation which had been built on multiple generations of externalism and legalism and showmanship and hypocrisy.
[time=3910] And He said in the great Sermon on the Mount, to the religious leaders and in the presence of a great throng of their followers, I say to you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and the Pharisees, you shall not enter the kingdom of heaven.
[time=3925] And He goes on to give them examples how in the world could our righteousness surpass that of theirs?
[time=3930] We cannot keep the law the way they do, we cannot memorize the law, study it and observe it in all of its many external outward forms as they have.
[time=3938] They are leaders, they are the ones that seem to do it better than anyone.
[time=3942] And in their minds thinking of the external commitment to the law.
[time=3947] And so Jesus backs up a minute and says this, "You have heard that the ancients were told you shall not commit murder.
[time=3953] Whoever commits murder shall be liable to the court, but I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be guilty before the court and whoever shall say to his brother Raka shall be guilty before the Supreme Court.
[time=3964] And whoever shall say you fool shall be guilty enough to go into the fiery hell."
[time=3970] Jesus again strips away the thin veneer of external commitment to obedience and says look you want to abstain from every form of evil please don't just do it outwardly and don't simply do it because you don't want the consequences of it when you do it.
[time=3982] Do it because you hate it from the inside out.
[time=3988] He gave them another illustration, he said you have heard that it was said you shall not commit adultery.
[time=3992] But I say that every one of you who looks on a woman the lust for her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.
[time=4001] This is the wonderful liberating power of the gospel and the grace of Jesus Christ.
[time=4006] Not only to free us from the domain of sin, not only to free us from the bondage of sin, not only to put us in a place where we can obey, but then to call us to be transformed in every one of our affections.
[time=4021] And to both hold us accountable at the heart level and grant us permission at the obedience external level to seek to seek help for both external obedience and internal obedience.
[time=4036] Which is why David cried out in Psalm 139 search me O God and know my heart.
[time=4041] Try me and know my anxious thoughts and see if there be any hurtful way in me and lead me in the everlasting way.
[time=4048] It was the last time you sat down and cried out Psalm 139 O God.
[time=4053] Know my heart, try me and know my anxious thoughts.
[time=4057] And as you're seeing there any hurtful or wicked way lead me, lead me in the different way, lead me in the way everlasting.
[time=4064] One of you cried out O God I want to be like the beloved son who has from the core of his being loved righteousness and hated evil.
[time=4073] Make me like Christ.
[time=4075] Not the find has come into church or knowing a verse or being involved in a ministry.
[time=4080] Make me like Christ and that from the core of my being like he did from the core of his being learned to love righteousness and hate evil.
[time=4088] Join the chorus of believers all over the world giving thanks to God that though they were slaves to sin by his grace they have become obedient from the heart to the teaching of God.
[time=4100] Thank you God for internal transformation.
[time=4104] Thank you God for eyes to see the emptiness and the ruin and the disastrous nature of evil.
[time=4109] Cried out for new longings and new wants and new desires to be the one who hungers and thirsts for righteousness.
[time=4117] To say I do hate sin, I hate it in others and I hate it in me.
[time=4124] Remind yourself of the standard, remind yourself of the calling, remind yourself of the liberty and the privilege and the power that God gives to believers.
[time=4132] To abstain from every form of evil not just from the outward expression of it but truly and genuinely become a person, a man, a woman of integrity, a whole human being whose outward behavior is matched and propelled by an inward conviction.
[time=4147] It is the propensity of us to allow our love for God to degenerate to the externals and to define our walk with him as to whether or not we are still doing or not doing certain things and that is never the intention.
[time=4162] He did not invite us to that kind of walk and so we put the searchlight of scripture back into our heart and say am I holding myself back from every form of evil.
[time=4179] Lastly we come to this third point and it is to be drastic.
[time=4184] Over and over again the scriptures call us to flee, to turn and run, to do as we are confronted with temptation what Joseph did in the presence of Potiphar's wife to bolt and run as at all possible.
[time=4201] This notion to abstain from every form of evil this morning in the text is not something we should take under advisement.
[time=4206] It is not information we should tuck away as though it were a good thought or to pass it along as a helpful hint to a friend.
[time=4213] It is instead God's intention that we will take drastic immediate life altering irrevocable action on this call to abstain from every form of evil.
[time=4223] In other words anything in your life, anything in your heart, anything that you have established as a way of life or a pattern that approximates your moving towards a form of evil.
[time=4234] Jesus would say to you this morning be drastic in altering your course and turning from that path.
[time=4241] Do not make friends with sin, do not be comfortable with it, do not allow yourself to slowly and suddenly become accustomed to the sin that is in your life instead be utterly drastic in your willingness to cut it out of your life.
[time=4254] Matthew 529 Jesus said if your right eye makes you stumble tear it out and throw it from you for it is better for you that one of the parts of your body should perish than for the whole body to perish by being thrown into hell.
[time=4267] In the next verse he said and if your right hand makes you stumble cut it off and throw it from you for it is better for you that one of the parts of your body should perish than for your whole body to go into hell.
[time=4280] Jesus does not for a moment think that pulling out your right eye will cause you to keep from lusting and Jesus does not think for one minute that cutting off your right hand will solve the problem of your stealing or whatever else it is you do with your right hand.
[time=4293] That is not what he is saying he just clarified that true righteousness is a matter of the heart.
[time=4297] What is he saying Jesus is speaking figuratively of those things physical or otherwise and he is saying this those things which cause us to be tempted or to make us more susceptible to temptation.
[time=4309] The right eye representing the best of our vision the right hand representing even the best of our skill level take a drastic irrevocable life altering action to cut it off out of your life.
[time=4323] Do not let any affection do not let any cherished possession any cherished desire to be perceived as you project your image any destructive habit any demand for relief allow sin in no way to find its comfortable lodging in your heart.
[time=4344] Hate it first and foremost and then drastically take the measures that must be taken.
[time=4355] First Corinthians 9 Paul says you want an illustration do you not know that those who run in the race all run but only one receives the prize and so run but run in such a way that you may win.
[time=4371] He goes on to say everybody who competes in the games exercises self control and all things they then do it to receive a perishable wreath.
[time=4378] A gold medal but we an imperishable therefore he says I run in such a way as not without aim and I box in such a way as not beating the air but I buff at my body and I make it my slave less possibly after I have preached to others I myself should be disqualified.
[time=4393] This is the drastic life consuming sacrificial pains taking long term no holes barred commitment of an Olympic athlete to win.
[time=4406] He says you're looking for a measurement as to how stringently you should deal with sin in your life how drastically you should you should take your measures to pursue God and holiness and righteousness.
[time=4418] Then picture if you will the life of an Olympic athlete who strips everything out of his heart his mind his soul and his life his behavior his patterns his passions and his goals so that he can win.
[time=4431] What win only a perishable wreath I buff at my body and I make it my slave that which used to be enslaved to sin is now the slave of mine so that I can accomplish the righteousness of God in my life.
[time=4450] Drastic life consuming sacrificial pains taking long term commitment to win.
[time=4466] On the other hand Paul says to Timothy on the other hand Timothy discipline yourself for the purpose of Godliness discipline yourself don't wait for consequences.
[time=4479] He says later take pains with these things be absorbed in them so that your progress may be evident to all.
[time=4489] Are you stronger in your stance against sin and your internal hatred of it and your willingness to take drastic measures against it today.
[time=4498] Is your progress obvious to all. Later he says Timothy flee from these things you men of God run away run away from those and do something instead pursue righteousness and godliness and faith and love and perseverance and gentleness.
[time=4517] No one ever turned their back on sin and began to pursue the righteousness and godliness and faith and love and perseverance and gentleness and regret it.
[time=4530] He says again fight the good fight Timothy fight the good fight of faith take a hold of the eternal life to what you were called and you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.
[time=4543] You want to win at sin you want to come this morning and be challenged to abstain from every possible form everything that is truly evil in your life.
[time=4559] Number one you can't bypass the beginning point you gotta you gotta know that Jesus Christ is in your heart that he's alive that he's broken the power of sin that you are his but you've got to go beyond that to hate it.
[time=4573] You can't make friends with it you can't negotiate it with it you can't make compromises with it you can't settle with it you've got to hate it from the inside out and you can't define your growth and your abstinence from sin as merely an external
[time=4587] observation it must be the degree to which you're learning to hate it day in and day out and then thoroughly it must be drastic.
[time=4596] When it is discovered and when it is hated then drastic measured are constantly employed are constantly called for in both the Old and the New Testament.
[time=4606] There's the one place in our lives we are allowed to be out of balance if you will be drastic.
[time=4614] So, Blackhawk making the long arduous breathtaking climb to the summit praying and hoping and longing that God would have us to be a prevailing church a power packed church a thriving dynamic church.
[time=4638] We want to get there together we want to corporately celebrate the summit we want to corporately enjoy the revitalization the retooling and the retasking of the bride of Christ.
[time=4651] Paul says oh man.
[time=4654] There are some things that you need to know that are going to happen to you along the way there are some there are some points that if you are not careful to observe you will not make it together.
[time=4667] Be careful about your attitude towards the leadership give them esteem and appreciate them for the purposes of unity.
[time=4675] Be mindful look around you they will find those who have stumbled along the way some will need a warning some will need help and encouragement others will need great patience.
[time=4684] And as the storms blow into this great climb and you're wondering why is it so cold and desolate why is it so hard why are these great forces beyond our control making it so difficult that in your relationship with God ensure yourself to rejoice
[time=4696] and give thanks and to be constantly in prayer.
[time=4699] And never for a moment think you make the ascent under your own power find always the fanning of the flame of the power of the Holy Spirit.
[time=4707] And as you find yourself at the crossroads wondering should we go this way or that way submit not to human wisdom but honor the word of God in the life of your church.
[time=4717] And ensure above all else that you as an individual a part of this great team do not hold them back by your affections for that which is evil.
[time=4730] Be a team player get in the game strip from your life every form of evil so that you are fully and totally surrendered to the will of God.
[time=4741] And a group of people like that he says they make the climb and they stay in the game and they finish the task they see people come to Christ they invite those people into warm loving God honoring relationships.
[time=4759] And they just stay at it until that great moment that first thessalonians four anticipates that sound the trumpet when Jesus comes again.
[time=4770] Let me invite you to stand for a closing word of prayer.
[time=4780] Our gracious God and Heavenly Father we thank you this really brings us to the end of two series one about our vision one about a church that wants to help seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=4795] And then it brings us to the end of second series that you know that's a hard thing to do that represents trauma that represents revitalizing it represents change it represents finding new ways to minister in a new day.
[time=4809] And so we come back to your word as we have and thank you for the instruction about along the way.
[time=4815] And where all of us find ourselves at points divergent from these traveling instructions help us to turn the spotlight not each other but on our own heart our own mind and look for those ways that we can repent and support and jump in and join the process for your glory and for your honor.
[time=4833] For it is a wonderful and awesome Savior we serve the person of Jesus Christ and whose name we pray and all God's people say amen God bless you.
[time=4863] [MUSIC]
