[time=30] Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=53] Thank you for joining us.
[time=54] We trust that the music and message from God's word will help you in your Christian walk.
[time=59] Please stay tuned.
[time=60] Now let's join our service.
[time=89] [MUSIC - 1066 seconds]
[time=1175] The verse we memorized so many years ago was Philippians 1-6 back there on the campus of SC, which basically says that I am confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ. He who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ. That's Paul speaking to the Philippians, and Paul does not put his confidence in the perseverance
[time=1204] and the personal fortitude and the effort and the integrity of the Philippians for their continued growth until the day of Christ. He does not put his confidence in his own power to disciple them towards maturity. He says this, "I am confident not in you and not in me. I am confident in God who began this work in you to perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ."
[time=1226] The point is this, once you have given your life to Jesus Christ in true saving faith, you have jumped onto a conveyor belt of sorts. It is the conveyor belt of glorification, it is the conveyor belt of salvation, it is the conveyor belt of God. And it inexorably moves you to the point that this verse describes without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, the theme of glorification.
[time=1254] And if you will picture a conveyor belt in your mind and you've jumped on it at salvation and it is moving in this direction and nothing you can do can keep you from going in that direction, because as you'll see this morning, you cannot shut it off.
[time=1269] There is no switch you can find and hit the switch and suddenly the conveyor belt grinds to a stop. There is no reverse switch. You cannot get it to go back towards your unsaved condition in the domain of darkness.
[time=1281] You cannot get out of it. You cannot climb off it. It is claustrophobic in that sense. You are surrounded 360 degrees inside of this conveyor belt tunnel and there is no escape.
[time=1293] And as that belt moves, you've got a few choices and they are not many. You can run or walk with the conveyor belt and get where God is inexorably going to take you faster than you otherwise would.
[time=1307] You can stand still and standing still, you continue to move. You can take a break in your Christian life. You can say, "I'm not going to grow anymore. I'm just going to stop."
[time=1317] And the conveyor belt continues to move you to conform to Christ. Or you can get really rebellious and really uppity and shake your fist in the face of God and choose to run away from Him.
[time=1330] This way, but what you'll soon realize is no matter how fast you run, the conveyor belt moves faster in the other direction.
[time=1339] And so huff and puff as hard as you like. God continues to move you to the place that He has chosen to move you, conformity to Jesus Christ.
[time=1351] There is one of the greatest realities in all of Christendom. There is no getting away from it. And so as we celebrate this great truth this morning, the faithfulness of God in salvation.
[time=1363] And see, that's what it is. Look, again at verse 24. Faithful is He who calls you and He will also bring it to pass.
[time=1370] Now, if you don't understand how to study the Scripture, if you don't understand how God intended you to understand His truth, you could take that verse, lift it out of context and say, "Whatever I want,
[time=1380] or whatever I think God ought to do in my life, He has said that He will do it." And that would be an absolute obliteration of the intent of this text.
[time=1390] This verse follows and has relevance only as it is understood in light of the verse in front of it. And what does that say?
[time=1396] Now, may the God of peace himself, what? Sanctify you entirely. Take you all the way home to glory.
[time=1403] May the verse continues, "May your spirit, soul, and body be preserved complete without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."
[time=1411] Now, verse 24, "And in respect to that," the Bible says, "faithful is He who calls you, and He will bring it to pass."
[time=1419] This is a declaration of the faithfulness of God to complete the salvation in people's lives.
[time=1427] And you can go to the bank with it.
[time=1431] Now, I want to take you behind the scenes of this great truth. And just like Blaine took me behind the scenes so many years ago,
[time=1438] and showed me the side of salvation that you and I would not normally experience or know about unless He told us.
[time=1448] What I want to do this morning is take you behind the scenes. I want to open the curtain, if you will.
[time=1455] And I want to show you the stuff that goes on relative to salvation, that you and I cannot perceive a priori,
[time=1465] that we do not, we neither know it a priori nor can we gain it through our five senses.
[time=1469] We are dependent totally for this information upon the Word of God itself.
[time=1474] And if God did not reveal it to us, we would have no idea that's how it worked.
[time=1479] This is some of the mystery of salvation that He has revealed.
[time=1482] Now, as I go into this, you're going to realize there are some more curtains back there that you wish He'd draw,
[time=1488] but He doesn't now.
[time=1490] This doesn't reveal all the mysteries of salvation, but this will take us behind the part that we know about.
[time=1495] Now, what do we know about in salvation? We know about repentance, right?
[time=1499] We know about confessing our sin and putting our faith in Jesus Christ as our personal Lord and Savior.
[time=1506] We readily see that part. Many of us can find the place and the time where someone shared the gospel with us.
[time=1513] We found profound conviction in our heart to the truth of the gospel that we are sinners in need of a Savior,
[time=1519] the grace of God, forgiveness of our sins, not by our works, but by the grace of God.
[time=1524] We can remember that moment many of us can, some of us can't because it happened as children, but a lot of us can, I can.
[time=1531] We can remember making the decision to come to Christ.
[time=1535] Many of us kind of teetered on that decision for some of us months, years, others of us hours,
[time=1542] and we were wondering, "Am I really going to do this? Am I really going to commit myself to this?" And then we did.
[time=1549] We're all aware of that. We got that in spades, right? We lived that.
[time=1553] We knew all about that. We have experiential remembrance of that encounter with God, and it lives in our hearts today.
[time=1560] But that is not the whole story of salvation.
[time=1567] That is our experience of it.
[time=1569] There is another side behind the curtain that only God can tell us, and He has told us a great deal about it.
[time=1575] There is another side of this deal that you and I know nothing about, but it is there just the same.
[time=1583] And as we study that this morning, I need you to turn in your Bibles to Romans chapter 8.
[time=1590] Romans chapter 8. Look at verse 28.
[time=1596] One of the most beloved scriptures in all the Word of God.
[time=1602] The foundation for it is the faithfulness of God, and it relates, as does the 1 Thessalonians 5 passage,
[time=1608] to the faithfulness of God with respect to bringing our salvation to completion in Christ.
[time=1614] Let's read verse, let me read verse 28.
[time=1617] And we know that God causes all things to work together for good.
[time=1622] To those who love God, to those who are called, watch this, according to His purpose.
[time=1629] We'll get to the His purpose part in a minute.
[time=1631] First of all, realize this.
[time=1633] The words you and I read in the English, to work together are one word in the Greek.
[time=1637] They are senergeto.
[time=1639] The word from which we get our words, synergism.
[time=1642] You know what synergism is?
[time=1644] Synergism is the working together of various elements to provide an effect greater and often completely different
[time=1652] from the sum of each acting separately or independently, right?
[time=1657] Synergism is the bringing together of things, and when you bring them together, they have an effect that is greater and often completely different than they are in and of themselves.
[time=1667] A common example of that typically used would be table salt, right?
[time=1672] Table salt is composed of two poisons, sodium and chlorine.
[time=1678] Now, independently they kill you.
[time=1681] Together they season your food, synergism.
[time=1686] That's the word. Listen to it again. And we know that God causes all things to work together for good.
[time=1693] To those who love God, to those who are called, according to His purpose.
[time=1697] Once you give your life to Christ, this Bible is saying, the word of God says, once you give your life to Christ, God takes every single thing, all these individual elements in your life.
[time=1707] Evil, temptation, even sin itself, that you and I willfully commit against the word of God.
[time=1713] Affliction, persecution, and He synergizes them.
[time=1717] He causes them to work together for something utterly different than what they were in and of themselves.
[time=1724] And He causes them to work for our good.
[time=1728] That is the sovereign power of God.
[time=1731] To orchestrate all the events of our lives as believers now towards His purpose.
[time=1739] Who's purpose? His purpose.
[time=1742] Now, what is His purpose? Look in verse 29, just to finish the thought.
[time=1747] For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to, now here comes the purpose.
[time=1751] To become conformed to the image of His Son.
[time=1755] There it is. And that's all that Paul is saying back in 1st Thessalonians 5, when he prays that we would be held complete in soul, body, and spirit, entirely sanctified.
[time=1766] That is the end process of salvation. We are conformed to the image of His Son.
[time=1772] We become just like Christ.
[time=1775] The conveyor belt of God and salvation.
[time=1779] You cannot stop it.
[time=1782] You cannot get off it.
[time=1785] You can run with it. You can stand idle, or you can run the other way.
[time=1790] But if you are truly born of God, you are on the conveyor belt, and you are on your way to the destination called Christ likeness.
[time=1799] Now that gets you into the context. Now let me take you behind the scenes. Are you ready?
[time=1803] There are five words in this text. There are five words in this text that will reveal to you that God had His part in your salvation.
[time=1815] And it was more than providing His Son the sacrifice for your sins.
[time=1822] God had, I mean you think you made your decision for Him in salvation.
[time=1828] And I think, based upon our experience, the reason we are saved today is because we chose Christ.
[time=1834] Wait till you're done with these five words. You're going to see another side that you don't know about.
[time=1838] And the fact is this, the reason that you and I are saved today is because in eternity past, God chose us.
[time=1847] God sovereignly chose us.
[time=1851] And that's part of that curtain that we wish we could open it back there.
[time=1854] Well how can that work together? How can you and I choose Christ and therefore we're saved?
[time=1858] And how can He have already chosen us? I mean if He already sovereignly chose us, then I get it.
[time=1863] Let me find those other curtains we'll see in heaven. Let me tell you what the text says.
[time=1868] I'm going to give you five words, five words that display, I call it the five, the golden chain of salvation
[time=1875] because each of these represents links in the chain that keep you eternally secure.
[time=1881] That if you will, keep you on the conveyor belt so that you can never get off.
[time=1885] The first word in verse 29 is the word for new. And it may be the most blessed word in all the Bible.
[time=1892] You can see it there in verse 29. For whom He foreknew, He also predestined.
[time=1897] Now really look at the word foreknew. Now some people think that foreknew means to know beforehand.
[time=1903] They think it makes a reference to the omniscience of God that God knows everything.
[time=1907] And since He's been around forever, He knows everything in advance.
[time=1912] In other words, with respect to salvation, He knew before we knew that we would accept Christ.
[time=1918] And so He predestined us. That is a view about this word.
[time=1922] And in my opinion it is wrong. It is utterly inconsistent with the rest of what the word of God teaches about
[time=1928] the process of God. Now God's side in salvation.
[time=1933] I do believe in the omniscience of God. And I do believe that God knows everything before it happens.
[time=1937] And I do believe that God looked and knew before He created the heavens and the earth about Russell.
[time=1941] And He knew that Russell in a cement truck at 20 in the middle of Los Angeles was going to give us.
[time=1945] That nothing catches God by surprise. I don't believe that's what this word is talking about.
[time=1951] You say what does it mean?
[time=1953] The word foreknew, progh, ganesco, compound word, prah, before, ganesco, to know.
[time=1959] A compound word meaning much, much more than just God knew in advance.
[time=1967] The word ganesco, to know.
[time=1969] In the scripture it carries the idea of intimacy and love.
[time=1974] A better translation for this word would be to pro-love, to beforehand love, to love beforehand.
[time=1984] Genesis 4-17, this basic equivalent in the Hebrew is used.
[time=1988] Cain had relations with his wife. The word had relations is translated from the word no.
[time=1993] Now are you telling me that Cain, this verse means Cain knew his wife? No.
[time=1998] This verse is saying that Cain entered into an intimate love covenant with his wife.
[time=2004] That's what that means.
[time=2006] And Amos 3-2, the same Hebrew word for no.
[time=2010] God says to Israel, you only have I chosen among all the families of the earth.
[time=2015] When God says that to the nation of Israel, you only have I chosen and the word underneath it is no.
[time=2020] You only have I known of all the nations of the earth. Are you trying to tell me that God only knew about that one nation?
[time=2028] No. God knows about all the nations. God knows about all the people in all the nations.
[time=2032] God knows about everything about all the people in all. God knows everything.
[time=2035] When God says of all the nations of the world, I knew you.
[time=2039] He means I entered into a love covenant, a special relationship of all the nations of the world, Israel.
[time=2045] You became my special unique nation.
[time=2050] It is a love covenant, my friends.
[time=2053] And he did it beforehand in Matthew 1-25.
[time=2058] It says that Joseph kept her a virgin.
[time=2061] Remember Matthew 1-25, Matthew kept her a virgin.
[time=2065] The literal Greek word there is he did not know her.
[time=2071] Joseph did not enter into the physical, intimate love covenant with Mary prior to, you know, her becoming pregnant with Christ.
[time=2084] You see, this is the side of salvation that you and I know nothing about.
[time=2088] Why? Because we weren't there in eternity past.
[time=2091] When God entered into an intimate love relationship with us.
[time=2096] He began the relationship with us before we even existed or knew that he existed.
[time=2102] And keeping with the day, Mother's Day, what's so hard to understand about that?
[time=2110] What mother hasn't sat there with child and entered into a love covenant faith keeping relationship with a child who does not even know it exists
[time=2125] and does not even know that its mother exists.
[time=2130] Hmm, interesting.
[time=2134] Before you and I were physically born, before you and I were spiritually born, God for loved us.
[time=2142] God for intimacy with us.
[time=2145] God for entered into a love intimate covenant relationship with us.
[time=2150] He for knew us.
[time=2153] What else could Ephesians 1 mean when it says this?
[time=2158] Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ.
[time=2167] Now this verse.
[time=2169] Just as he chose us in him when before the foundation of the world.
[time=2179] Oh man, you mean to tell me that before I popped out, so to speak, in space and time.
[time=2187] Before the foundation of the world it was God who had chosen me.
[time=2193] And then verse 4 says of Ephesians 1, "In love he predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to himself according to the kind intention of his will."
[time=2207] Does it say there that God looked down the annals of time and saw those who would and wouldn't?
[time=2212] And said, "Well, if you're going to choose me, I guess I'll choose you."
[time=2218] Or does it say that consistent with a loving parent, he saw us.
[time=2224] He fell in love with us.
[time=2226] He chose us before the foundation of the world according to the kind intention of his will not ours.
[time=2235] What kind of a mother would it be?
[time=2236] I will love you if.
[time=2242] What else could 1 Thessalonians verses 2 and 5 mean when it says this?
[time=2247] And here he is speaking to the very Thessalonians, he's reassuring of the faithfulness of God.
[time=2251] We give thanks to God always for all of you, making mention of you in our prayers.
[time=2256] Constantly bearing in mind your work of faith, your labor of love, your steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ and the presence of God our Father watch.
[time=2263] Verse 4, "Brethren, be loved of God, his choice of you."
[time=2272] Knowing, brethren, beloved of God, his choice of you for our gospel did not come to you in Word only but also in power in the Holy Spirit with full conviction just as you know what kind of men we prove to be among you for your sake.
[time=2284] Wow.
[time=2286] What else could that mean?
[time=2288] Other than the fact that behind the scenes a part of this thing we could not feel, could not experience, cannot now experience other than to take by faith through the revealed Word of God.
[time=2299] God is saying that was your side of the experience, let me tell you about mine.
[time=2303] I saw you coming baby, I fell in love with you before the foundation of the world and I chose to enter into a love relationship with you and therefore chose you.
[time=2317] Second Thessalonians 2, 13, what else could this verse mean?
[time=2321] We should always give thanks to God for you, brethren, beloved by the Lord. Why? Because God has chosen you from the beginning for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and faith in the truth.
[time=2337] And it was for this, he called you through our gospel that you may gain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2344] Wow. When Blaine was teaching to me, this to me back on the campus at USC, he used, he's saying, you know, this is not uncommon for God to make unilateral covenants with people.
[time=2356] Independent of how you're going to treat me, this is how I am going to treat you.
[time=2359] In the day and age in which Abraham lived, for example, a covenant would have been entered into without legal contracts, so to speak, didn't have lawyers and such.
[time=2367] What they had was a covenant making process and it was a formal affair, two people coming to an agreement on a significant issue.
[time=2375] They would take animals and they would kill the animals and they would lay them half here, half here, half here, half here, half here, half here.
[time=2383] And then the covenant makers would pass both of them between this covenant keeping symbol.
[time=2393] When God made his covenant with Abraham back in Genesis, he put Abraham to sleep.
[time=2399] And then he laid the animals out and then he passed through all by himself and then he woke Abraham up and said, I have made a covenant with you.
[time=2409] I have chosen to do something in your life.
[time=2412] It is utterly independent of you, that's why you were asleep, that's why you didn't do any of this stuff.
[time=2416] I'm going to do this no matter what you do.
[time=2419] It's an amazing thing. 1 John 4 19, we love him because, oh, interesting, we love him because he first loved us.
[time=2436] Second word, in Romans chapter 8 verse 29 is the word predestined.
[time=2441] Based upon this great love, he then predestined us, whom he also predestined.
[time=2448] The word predestined means to mark out the boundaries in advance.
[time=2451] That's all that word means. It means to mark out the boundaries in advance.
[time=2455] And what God does, once he enters into a love covenant with us, he then marks out our boundary in advance.
[time=2464] He determines the boundary of what we're going to be, and what is that? You've already seen it this morning again, read verse 29, for whom he foreknew, he also predestined.
[time=2473] Well, he marked out the boundaries to make us what? Well, to become conformed to the image of his son.
[time=2479] That, my friends, has already been determined and eternity passed based upon the first commitment that God made to us, to love us, and to enter into a love covenant with us, to choose us from before the foundation of the world according to the kind intention of his will.
[time=2493] That's the sovereign act of God, to mark out the boundary in advance.
[time=2501] And so there begins this first word, the love covenant, and then there is the second word predestined, which happens also in eternity passed, the marking out of the boundaries of our hearts, that we should become like Christ.
[time=2513] Now let's go to the third word. The third word is the word called, and you can find that one in verse 30.
[time=2520] Here's the third link, if you will, in this golden chain that keeps us tied to the conveyor belt of the sanctifying process of God, for whom he foreknew, he also predestined to become conformed to the image of his son, that he might be the first born among many brothers.
[time=2536] Now verse 30, and whom he predestined, he also called, he called.
[time=2546] Now in scripture, this is the time and space stuff where you and I start plugging in.
[time=2552] This is the time in God's side when he reveals how he has been working on our salvation, that we begin to have our first experience with, if you will.
[time=2563] This is when we actually get saved, the calling of God in our life, it is the experience of our conversion.
[time=2570] Now there are a number of different verses that we can turn to on this, let's 2 Timothy 1-9.
[time=2577] It says this, "Who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was granted us in Jesus Christ from win, from all of eternity."
[time=2598] This is amazing. Verse 8 says, "Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, or of me his prisoner, but join with me in suffering for the gospel according to the power of God." Why?
[time=2607] Because he has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose, there it is again, that's that side of salvation.
[time=2617] It's his own purpose and his grace, which he granted to us in Christ from all eternity, but now has been revealed by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ.
[time=2629] I already read to you 2 Thessalonians 2, 13 and 14, which says the same thing, but let's look at it again in this light, this is the calling of God in your life.
[time=2637] 2 Thess 2, 13 says, "But we should always give thanks to God for you, brethren. Beloved by our Lord." Why? Because God has chosen you from the beginning for salvation through sanctification by the spirit and faith and truth, right?
[time=2654] That's what he did in his early past. And it was for this, he called you through our gospel that you may gain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2664] There it is. How do you get called? You get called by God through the presentation of his gospel.
[time=2670] And because he has entered into a pre-love relationship with you, and because he has sovereignly marked out the boundaries of your heart and life that you will become like Christ, at one point or another, when you hear the gospel, you give your life to Christ, based on his effectual, irresistible calling on your life. He calls and you come.
[time=2691] It's an amazing thing. What you and I thought was a great deliberation. What you and I thought was entirely up to us. What you and I thought was, at least for me, this counting the cost for the rest of my life and all of eternity as to whether I will live for Christ or whether I will not, whether I will accept Him or whether I won't.
[time=2711] Behind the scenes God already chose to know me and love me and enter into a co-relationship. He already determined sovereignly that I was going to become like Christ, and he had already said in motion his call on my life through the gospel, which I could not say no to. Because the purposes of God cannot be thwarted.
[time=2728] Now figure that one out in your brain. It's impossible. I told you there would be more curtains behind the ones he reveals.
[time=2737] So he loves us. He predestines us. He calls us. The fourth link in the golden chain of salvation is in verse 30, and it is this word justification.
[time=2747] Justification. Oh, and what a wonderful word that is. You know what that word means? That means being made right with God.
[time=2755] Second, you respond to the call of God and give your life to Christ. You become a Christian. You Romans 3, 24 says are justified as a gift by grace through redemption, which is in Christ Jesus.
[time=2768] Justification is the word that describes the fact that once you give your life to Christ, the war is over.
[time=2773] The enmity that you are at with God because of your sin, because of your rebellion, because of your continued commitment to live in disobedience to his word and all the damnation and hell and wrath that would be rightfully ours is finally over.
[time=2784] When you are justified, you are made right with God through the grace of God that is given through Christ. And peace with God is finally made.
[time=2793] Forgiveness is granted. It is at that moment of justification that the soul of the individual is regenerated. That's the point of new birth.
[time=2802] You become a new creature in Christ. The Holy Spirit takes residence in your heart, and you begin to move down this conveyor belt.
[time=2810] Justification is the, if you will, stepping on in our experience.
[time=2815] Let me give you the fifth and final link. Look at verse 30.
[time=2821] "Whom he predestined these he also called, and whom he called he also justified, and whom he justified these he also glorified."
[time=2831] And we talked about that last week, didn't we?
[time=2834] Glorified. That's the point where we finally see Jesus and we finally become like him. That's when the conveyor belt finally stops because, not because we tried to stop it, but because it's finally reached its destination.
[time=2849] That's what 1 John 3 says, right? Verse 2, "Beloved, now are we the children of God, we're born again now, but it doesn't appear as yet what we shall be.
[time=2860] We don't look yet like what we're going to look like. We're children now, but we don't look like what we're going to look like."
[time=2869] The second part of the verse, we know that when he appears, namely Christ, we shall be like him because we shall see him just as he is.
[time=2878] Everyone who has this hope fixed on him purifies himself.
[time=2882] We could go to many, many, many verses about all that stuff. We did last week. Just, I mean, glorification. It's the final culminating event where we are finally given our glorified bodies, given our glorified hearts and minds.
[time=2894] We're perfect. We'll never have to repent again. We'll never have a sinful or evil thought. We'll never have a jealous thought.
[time=2899] We'll only always walk in perfect iteration of God and be at his beck and call to serve him in love perfectly. Everyone who is around us, including him, glorification.
[time=2912] Now, if you'll notice, all these words are written in the past tense.
[time=2917] You can see it a little bit in the English, but if you're reading this in the Greek, it sticks out at you like neon signs.
[time=2923] The Greek is a very powerful language. And when they want to put behavior in the past, it's called the heiress tense. It's a completed act.
[time=2930] And if you're reading these five words in the Greek, they all are in the heiress tense. They are all in the past.
[time=2937] Think about that for a minute. As it relates to the faithfulness of God, verse 34, "He predestined these, he called past tense, and whom he called, he justified past tense, and these whom he justified, he glorified past tense." Why?
[time=2952] It is a literary device by which Paul exudes the certainty of the faithfulness of God to complete what he has started, so he writes as if the whole process from beginning to end is already done.
[time=2965] Because once God says it's done, it's done. Now, it may work out over time, and you and I experience that and question that and wonder that, but when Paul talks about it from the way that God looks at it, it's already done.
[time=2977] And so it's all in past tense. Only a fool would declare his football team as having already won next year's Super Bowl.
[time=2988] Only a fool as an investor would begin to spend the money that he has invested in speculative stocks because he already knows what the stock is going to do.
[time=3000] That is foolishness, that is presumption. With God, it is not foolishness. With God, it is absolute certainty. Why? Because God, in addition to being sovereign, God is faithful.
[time=3015] And when he starts us into the process of salvation, even as it says there in 1 Thessalonians chapter 5, faithful is he who calls you, and faithful is he who calls you, and he also will bring it to pass, because when God says this stuff, he isn't dependent on other forces or other factors.
[time=3038] He doesn't have to wonder how that team is going to play or not play. He doesn't have to wonder how that stock is going to perform or not perform, because he is the author and perfecter of our faith.
[time=3050] And while we have our role and while we have our part, and that is that side of the equation, there is a completely different side of the equation that the scriptures reveal to us which we would never otherwise know or think up on our own, and that is that God is the author and perfecter of our faith.
[time=3066] He is the initiator of it. He is the the fulfiller of it. He is the sustainer of it, and he is the complier of it, and he will do it no matter what we do.
[time=3075] He has made a unilateral commitment to us based upon the kind intention of his will and his love which he has showered upon us before the world began, the faithfulness of God.
[time=3089] Psalm 36 5 describes the faithfulness of God as reaching into the skies, and you know that that's as far and as high as the writers then could think of.
[time=3098] It was their term for infinity. The faithfulness of God is infinite.
[time=3106] Thank God for Numbers 23-19 which says God is not a man, that he should lie, nor a son of man that he should repent.
[time=3114] Has he said, and will he not do it, or has he spoken, and will he not make it good? And the answer is obviously, because God is not a man.
[time=3127] In Genesis 8-22 it says, "While the earth remains, seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer, and winter and day and night shall not cease."
[time=3136] And for over however old you think the earth is now, four, five, six thousand, maybe ten thousand years old, every single year that passes proclaims the faithfulness of God.
[time=3145] For while the earth remains, seed time and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease." He is faithful.
[time=3154] I'll never forget being in my little office studying there in seminary, going through Old Testament history, and feeling as though God himself had crashed into my presence.
[time=3165] Because I read Exodus 1241 and it said, "And it came about at the end of 430 years to the very day that all the hosts of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt."
[time=3178] And that itself didn't make a lot of significance to me, but as soon as I crossed reference back to Genesis 15 and what God had told Abraham that his descendants would be enslaved and oppressed for four hundred years.
[time=3191] I thought, "Oh my goodness, think of all the factors, think of all the complex synergism that had to go into that thing to allow God to predict some hundreds of years before to Abraham.
[time=3206] Finally then, the length of his offspring in captive in Egypt and to bring their release on the very day he had predicted."
[time=3216] And I guess that one pales to insignificance when you think about Isaiah 7, 14, which said, "The Lord said a virgin will be with child and will bear a son, and you shall call his name Immanuel."
[time=3230] Then you read Galatians 4-4, "But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his son, born of a woman."
[time=3240] And don't forget that great truth, we are studying even this morning in 2 Timothy 2, 13, which says this, "If we are faithless, if we are faithless, he remains faithful, for he cannot deny himself."
[time=3258] And so we sing our song, "Great is thy faithfulness, oh God my Father, there is no shadow of turning with thee, thou changeest not thy compassion's they fail not, as thou hast been, now forever it will be."
[time=3274] Rest assured my friends, if you are truly born again, nothing.
[time=3281] Absolutely nothing can keep you from moving down the conveyor belt of God to ultimate glorification.
[time=3291] What shall we say then to these things?
[time=3294] If God is for us, who is against us?
[time=3297] He who did not bear his own son, but delivered him up for us all, how will he not also with him freely give us all things?
[time=3305] Who will bring a charge against God's elect? Remember the word elect? The ones he has chosen from eternity past.
[time=3312] Who will bring a charge against God's elect? God is the one who justifies.
[time=3317] Who then is the one who condemns? And so then Paul just explodes into this.
[time=3323] Who shall separate us for the love of Christ?
[time=3325] Shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword?
[time=3329] But in all these things we are overwhelmingly conquerors through him who loved us.
[time=3334] For I am convinced that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor things present nor things to come nor powers nor height nor depth nor any other created things
[time=3342] shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[time=3346] This passage he writes on the heels of Romans 8, 28, 29 and 30 in which he lays out for you the kind purposeful intention of his heart to conform you to Christ.
[time=3357] A process which began in eternity past as he entered into a unilateral love covenant relationship with you by name and then predestined and marked the boundaries of your life to be like Christ in space and time.
[time=3369] He called you and justified you and in eternity future he will glorify you but it is all referenced as having already happened because of his sovereign faithfulness.
[time=3386] He wrote a short story entitled "Great Lady" about his mom.
[time=3390] He said I remember when I was in fourth grade and you used to do things like stay up half the night just to make a Zorro outfit for Halloween.
[time=3401] I remember you are working two jobs sometimes so as to ensure our family would be able to make ends meet.
[time=3408] I remember the night I came to you late in fact it was near midnight or perhaps beyond and told you that I was supposed to be a king in a play at school the next day.
[time=3419] I remember when I split my head open for the sixth time in a row.
[time=3423] I remember in junior high in high school you helping me muddle through my homework.
[time=3428] I can remember you attending all my football and basketball games.
[time=3431] I remember all the sacrifices you made so that I could go to Stanford.
[time=3436] Time were on I grew older and got married and started a family.
[time=3439] I got swallowed excuse me I got slowed down by an accident.
[time=3443] Things got a little tougher for me.
[time=3445] But you stood alongside as you always had some things I thought never changed.
[time=3452] Again mom, mothers thank you.
[time=3455] Thank you for your ever present representation of the faithfulness of God.
[time=3459] And thank you God, thank you God for being faithful.
[time=3465] Faithful in conforming us to the image of Jesus Christ.
[time=3471] Let me invite you to stand for a closing word of prayer.
[time=3476] Our gracious God and Heavenly Father these are difficult things for finite minds to understand.
[time=3484] There are so many paradoxes here.
[time=3487] There are so many apparent contradictions.
[time=3491] There are so many things which our human limited minds cannot even begin to reconcile.
[time=3498] But this is the clear unquestioned teaching of the Word of God that you are the initiator of our salvation.
[time=3505] And what you have begun you will finish.
[time=3508] And so rather than mitigate against that truth trying to get it to fit with other truth that you taught us.
[time=3514] Let us acknowledge and crown you not only faithful today but as omniscient you know how all this works together.
[time=3520] It makes sense to you, it doesn't to us.
[time=3525] And so we humbly say thank you for your faithfulness and thank you for your sovereignty.
[time=3531] And thank you that you will finish what you have begun in our lives in Jesus Christ.
[time=3536] It's in Christ's name we pray and all God's people say.
