[time=508] [MUSIC - 345 seconds]
[time=869] Wow, what a great morning already. We are going to try to keep going here this morning and continue in our study of this great book of Daniel that we started. Last week we were in chapter one. And this week we were in chapter one.
[time=882] And this week we come to chapter two. And in some ways it is a similar scene as you'll soon find out. But we will see before us this morning in the pages of Scripture. These four points, these four habits of highly effective God honoring crisis managers. Because these boys again find themselves in the midst of an amazing crisis that requires of them. Many of the same things that were required of them last week.
[time=911] And yet here a year later as the text tells us they find themselves in a very, very challenging crisis. Think about it. Think about it in your own life, crisis. Think about when it hits. Think about what happens to you, what happens to your heart, what happens to your mind. How do you respond in your own world when crisis hits? And I think when I think about that.
[time=940] My mind goes immediately to a morning that I will never, ever, ever, ever forget. January 17, 1994, 4.31 a.m. The greater Los Angeles area. And that was the morning.
[time=963] I mean, there have been a few earthquakes in that vicinity. You may be aware of that. But that was the morning that the earth shook harder and longer and faster and more violently than I had ever in all of my life and growing up in those things ever, ever felt.
[time=980] And we were in our condo. My wife and I, Kebra, and our little boy, Russell T, was about 18 months old at that point. And you got to picture our condo, all 950 square feet of it.
[time=994] You have an upstairs condo with three major rooms. You have the master bedroom here. And then you have a big living room area here. And then you've got the other bedroom down here.
[time=1006] And in this bedroom down here is our little boy, 18 months old and amazing how God does this. And a 20-year-old cousin of my wife, young lady, who had just moved in, had moved down from Washington, the state of Washington, had never been away from home, had never been away from her family, was scared to death to come to the big city.
[time=1030] She's asleep. First night, the parents had just left that afternoon. No, it's the honest truth. She's asleep in the trundle bed with Russell T. back in this room. Living room here, Kebra, my wife, she's asleep on the couch.
[time=1042] We won't go into wife, she's on the couch, but she was on the couch. And I'm in here in our bedroom. Master bedroom, she's out in the couch. 431.
[time=1052] Boom. If you can imagine, I mean, it's hard to describe, but if you can imagine standing or sitting on something that instantly begins to move 8 to 10 feet one way and 8 to 10 feet the other.
[time=1065] And if you can imagine the deafening roar of the earth shaking and pictures immediately flying off walls, glasses and dishes and pots and pans and vases in the kitchen,
[time=1078] immediately emptying, emptying and crashing into a pile on the center. I'm on the bed, bookcases on one side, bookcases on the other. They're picked up, thrown onto the bed.
[time=1089] I'm under books now and bookcases like that, buried with a raging headache from one of the cases that hit me on the head. I have two bookcases on my bed.
[time=1100] I'm under a pile of books. My wife is in the living room. And the cousin is going absolutely ballistic, screaming her lungs out back in the far room with my son whose crib was positioned under a shelf that she had chosen without us knowing to put her color TV on.
[time=1123] And so her color TV comes off the shelf and just clips his feet a little bit. He jumps up. I think he would have been fine and were it not for the strange, fanatical woman screaming in his room.
[time=1134] So he starts to scream. He starts to cry. She's screaming her lungs out. The earth is shaking. The dishes are breaking. You can't hear yourself think. You can't even see your vision is impaired because it's all going so fast.
[time=1148] It's pitch dark. Electricity's gone immediately. And my wife is trying to get up off the couch. We're both pretty convinced because of the kinds of screams that they're dead.
[time=1159] We're pretty convinced that we don't even want to run in there or try to get in there because from what it sounds like they're in a hole like a thousand feet down.
[time=1168] But she tries anyway because she's a mom and she gets up and she makes it halfway across the living room and gets thrown back against the couch.
[time=1177] I try to get out from under my pile of books. I finally make it to the end of my bed. Take one step and I'm thrown back onto the pile.
[time=1185] She's now screaming and crying because she can't get to her baby. I don't think she cared much about her cousin at that point.
[time=1193] She couldn't get there. She tried again. She gets thrown back against the sliding glass door leading to the balcony.
[time=1200] And 39 seconds later. Imagine that. 39 seconds of that. The earth stopped shaking.
[time=1213] It's pitch dark. We finally get up with tears running down our faces and carry and rustle tea to our amazement and joy.
[time=1223] Meet us halfway down that hallway. They're okay. And we come walking back out through the living room to the door to go downstairs and get out of this place.
[time=1233] And my wife, I forgot to tell you, as you listen to this story, you're going to see the four habits.
[time=1240] All right. Just be listening. As we get ready to go down the stairs, she says, wait a second. Hold on just a second.
[time=1247] Well, if you've been in an earthquake, you know that within seconds, typically, there are these things called aftershocks.
[time=1254] And so, she's saying, hold on just a second. I'm an absolute case. My son's screaming his head off.
[time=1261] Carrie Sue is like, I mean, you're looking at her going, we're going to take her right to the mental ward.
[time=1267] I mean, she is absolutely gone. And my wife says, hang on one sec. We better get some things.
[time=1273] And she real quick, this appears into the dark and comes back with about five, six, seven blankets.
[time=1279] A whole bunch of shoes, my shoes, her shoes, Carrie's shoes. Put these on real quick, she says, glass, everywhere.
[time=1287] All right, put our shoes on. Boom, if things start shaking again, boom, we're down the door out the stairs and we're out.
[time=1294] And we're met by, in our condo complex, in the next building over, Wiley and Leah, our good friends.
[time=1300] Next building over this way, Joel and Jen, our good friends, and then three buildings down.
[time=1304] Her sister Kayla, my wife's sister Kayla and her husband Chad, all of them newly married, no kids.
[time=1309] And it's an amazing thing how in the midst of crisis, people come together.
[time=1313] And we had never talked about this. We had never suggested it. But before you know it, within about 30 seconds, we're all in front of our condo.
[time=1320] Huddled up together in the pitch dark with the earth still shaking and after shock still coming.
[time=1326] And as we get there, my sister in law Kayla looks at me and says, we should pray.
[time=1334] Like, you're the pastor dummy, pray. She says, we should pray. And she was serious. And everybody agreed, yeah, we should.
[time=1345] And so we prayed. And we basically just asked for help. We just asked for help. And we asked for courage.
[time=1354] And we just asked them to be with us.
[time=1357] Well, we make our way out to the big lawn area in front of the condo complex.
[time=1362] And at that point, the sun's coming up and the damage, you know, begins to be more visible and the entire complex is absolutely shot.
[time=1370] I mean, windows are broken and chimneys are down and people are kind of milling around him.
[time=1375] And my friend Joel, not too long after we're out there, he begins to kind of huddle us back together again
[time=1383] and figure out what we need. Who came out with what? You got blankets. You got shoes. Did you get some water?
[time=1388] And he begins to right there in front of the six or eight of us develop this needs list. Who needs what?
[time=1395] He's going to go figure out, you know, what stores are open, what things didn't we get, what might he be able to go back and get in his place.
[time=1403] It was amazing to me to just watch him right there compile a list of 20 or 30 things that he knew as he assessed the damage.
[time=1411] We weren't going back in for a while and he began to immediately figure out ways to help.
[time=1416] Well, that day turned into a night that afternoon Russell T breaks out with chicken pox. That's good timing.
[time=1425] He breaks out with chicken pox that afternoon. My wife and Carrie and he get in a car and we send them up north on the highway out of town to another city.
[time=1437] I'm not sure why we did that. I mean, it was just I think we had some friends up there.
[time=1442] That's right. We had some friends who maybe could help her, you know, get to a doctor that wasn't under a pile of rubble.
[time=1448] And so the day went on, tents get put up, and I realize about six o'clock at night having gone in a couple of times they get some things.
[time=1457] I have a gash in my hand. I mean, it's a guy. I hadn't noticed it in 10 hours. There's a gash in my hand.
[time=1462] Here it is right here. The scars right there. I had to go to the hospital and get some stitches.
[time=1467] And so everybody set. We got some tents up. We got somewhat calm and I head down to the hospital, walked down to the hospital about three blocks away,
[time=1477] going to the waiting room in the emergency things packed. Absolute bedlam. And I'm sitting there wait three hours and I get in there to have them stitch me up.
[time=1485] Three hours later, I'm sitting in there with a young gal, doctor, and she is absolutely scared to death.
[time=1492] She's going to stitch my hand and she's absolutely shaking. And aftershocks, no kidding. Every 35, you know, 40 minutes, there's a big aftershock.
[time=1502] She lets me know at that point that she's lived here for two weeks. She moved from Kansas.
[time=1507] I said, I'll call you Dorothy. How's that? Maybe you might want to calm down though before you stitch my hand.
[time=1514] And we got to talk. And again, I was so preoccupied with what had been going on.
[time=1520] I can't say that this was me, but it dawned on me in the midst of that, that she was pretty scared. She was away from home.
[time=1526] And we had a chance to talk about her life and she took her time on my hand.
[time=1531] And I had a chance to ask her some questions about eventually her faith or the lack thereof.
[time=1537] And she had some questions about my job and what I did. It was kind of a rich time in the midst of some real confusion.
[time=1547] Never forget that as long as I left that day. Now maybe you haven't lived through an earthquake, maybe you have.
[time=1553] But you know what folks, you have all. Every one of you experienced severe crisis in your life.
[time=1561] You have faced dark days and hard times. And God calls you, and God calls me, and we see again this morning in the lives of these four years.
[time=1571] We are called to respond to crisis in a way that honors him.
[time=1576] And this morning we have to ask ourselves, and I want to ask you, how do you respond to crisis in your own life in the workplace, at home, with family, with friends?
[time=1585] When real pressure settles in, when the unexpected comes crashing through your door, when the best laid plans are shattered by another's carelessness, when your crisis hits and things are just not going the way you had planned or the way you wanted.
[time=1603] How do you respond? Are you too often quick to speak? Are you too often slow to listen? Are you too often easily irritated?
[time=1617] Are you increasingly self-centered? Are you prone to panic?
[time=1623] When crisis hits, what do you do with the Lord? What do you do with your relationship with Christ? What do you do with God when crisis hits your life, big or small?
[time=1636] Where does he go? What do you do? When I think about that, I realize and then remind it again this morning that we need help.
[time=1645] You need help, and I need help. We need to be reminded of God's design for crisis management, which is exactly what we find here in Daniel 2 as we continue.
[time=1656] It is here in the second chapter that we come across many of the same players from chapter 1, and again as in chapter 1, Daniel, and his young friends are living faithful lives under the tyrannical rule of a crazy godless king, who now, Nebuchadnezzar, in chapter 2,
[time=1674] brings redefinition to the phrase egomaniac. I mean, he is even more out of control than he was in chapter 1, and a crisis is about to hit, and we find Daniel and company ready with a four-step approach that reminds each of us that there is a perspective,
[time=1693] that there is a posture, that there is an attitude, that when chosen, and be reminded this morning that it is a choice, there is a perspective, there is a posture, there is an attitude, that when chosen moves us away from flaring tempers and harsh words and panic,
[time=1717] and it moves us closer to the poise and calm of true faith.
[time=1725] Chapter 2, the book at Daniel, turn there, if you will.
[time=1730] Daniel chapter 2, we're going to look at verses 1 to 30. Daniel chapter 2 verses 1 to 30, and watch how this breaks down.
[time=1740] Chapter 2 verses 1 to 30, we're going to see two major sections. Number 1 verses 1 to 13, we'll see the birth of this crisis.
[time=1748] We'll see this crisis developing. We'll see the birth of the crisis in verses 1 to 13, and then in verses 14 to 30, we'll see the four habits, the four responses, the four habits of highly effective crisis managers,
[time=1764] highly effective, highly God-honoring crisis managers in verses 14 to 30, but let's take a look, right there at the beginning, chapter 2, verse 1, the birth of the crisis.
[time=1777] What does it say there? It says, "Now in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams, and his spirit was troubled and his sleep left him."
[time=1789] Nebuchadnezzar, stop there. Nebuchadnezzar is having trouble sleeping. He's experiencing this anxious insomnia. He's having these dreams, and he can't make sense of it.
[time=1798] And he starts to lose sleep. So what's he do? Look there at verse 2. Then the king gave orders, verses 2 and 3. The king gave orders to call in the magicians.
[time=1808] The conjurers, the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to tell the king his dreams, so they came and stood before the king.
[time=1816] Verse 3 and the king said to them, "I had a dream, and my spirit is anxious to understand the dream."
[time=1823] Who does he call in there? Well, that group of folks you see described there in chapter 2, verse 2, these are his, this would be his cabinet.
[time=1832] These would be his trusted advisors. These are his mediums, his fortune tellers, even his scientists. And he says to them, "Do your thing.
[time=1842] Do what I pay you so well to do. Tell me what my dream was, and tell me what it means.
[time=1849] And do it now. He's anxious. There is a sense of urgency and demand in his voice. Help me understand the dream. Look at verse 4.
[time=1859] Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic. "Oh king, live forever." They say, "Oh king, live forever.
[time=1869] Tell the dream to your servants, and we will declare the interpretation." See what they're doing? See how they did that?
[time=1877] These guys aren't dumb. These guys aren't dumb. And they know they're king.
[time=1881] And they sense where he's going and with knees knocking. They give the standard response given when dealing with a sleep deprived, over anxious, sadistic, brutal, megalomaniac.
[time=1892] What does it say there? First part of verse 4, they say, "Oh king, live forever." I mean, can you see him? Can you see one of them going, "King, you the man." Ha ha.
[time=1903] You are it, Nebuchadnezzar. Man, I love you. You are great.
[time=1907] Now, just go ahead and tell us the dream, and then we'll give you an interpretation.
[time=1914] He says no. He says no. Look at verse 5. The king answered, "Instead of the Chaldeans, the command from me is firm.
[time=1923] If you don't make known to me the dream and its interpretation, you will be torn limb from limb, and your houses will be made a rubbish heap."
[time=1936] He shoots back and says, "Hey guys, what part of give me an interpretation didn't you understand? Let me be clear with you. Let me be lucid.
[time=1946] Let me tell you exactly what I'm saying. Give me the dream, give me the interpretation, and if you don't, I will rip your body apart and then destroy your homes."
[time=1959] Which is always kind of confused me. I'm not sure what difference that makes if they don't have bodies. I'm not sure why they would need houses after that, but he chooses to do it in that order.
[time=1969] But he's upset, and he's not going to take their stalling games. He gets extremely clear and tells them what he's going to do.
[time=1978] Now look, now they're scrambling, trying to stall. He knows it and lays it out for them even more clearly.
[time=1985] One more time, verses 7-9. Look what it says.
[time=1988] They answered a second time and said, "Let the king tell the dream to a servant, and we will declare the interpretation, the king answered, and said, "I know for certain that you are bargaining for time.
[time=1999] And as much as you have seen that the command from me is firm. And if you do not make the dream known to me, there is only one decree for you.
[time=2007] For you have agreed together with speak, for you have agreed together to speak lying and corrupt words before me until the situation has changed.
[time=2015] Therefore tell me the dream that I may know that you can declare to me its interpretation."
[time=2026] He hasn't been sleeping. He's extremely bothered. He wants these guys to do what they say they can do, and he's going to kill them if they don't come through.
[time=2036] And now, in desperation, they resort to antagonism and pessimism.
[time=2042] Look at verses 10 and 11. The Chaldeans answered the king and said, "Now there is not a man on earth."
[time=2049] You hear their voices, you hear their tone, there is not a man on earth who could declare this for the king.
[time=2054] And as much as no great king or ruler has ever asked anything like this of any magician, conjurer, or Chaldeans.
[time=2061] Verse 11, moreover, and watch this. Watch God at work.
[time=2068] Remember back in chapter 1 how God was there, orchestrating all of the events? He hasn't gone anywhere.
[time=2076] He's setting them up. Look what it says in verse 11. Moreover, the thing which the king demands is difficult, and there is no one else who could declare it to the king except God's whose dwelling place is not with mortal flesh.
[time=2090] They're convinced now that he's whacked. He's asking way too much. Nobody could do it.
[time=2097] You're crazy to think that anybody could do this. And now look at verse 12. That's it. He pops a gasket.
[time=2105] Because of this, the king became indignant and very furious and gave orders to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.
[time=2114] And so the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain and they looked for Daniel and his friends to kill them.
[time=2123] Back to verse 12, he gave orders to destroy all of the wise men, not just these wise men that he was dealing with here in his court on that day in that time and place.
[time=2134] No, he says, kill them all. Everybody who has been established in my reign in this kingdom and considered a wise man who serves in my court, kill them.
[time=2146] Right now, Daniel and the boys as well.
[time=2153] Now again, more insight into how absolutely deranged this man was. Again, historians and commentators will tell you and they will help you see that this targeted group, all of the wise men of Israel, was probably somewhere in the range of 200 to 250 men.
[time=2173] That he had trained, that he had invested in, that he had fed, that he had brought along.
[time=2182] And a few of them can't tell him his dream or give him the interpretation and he says, kill him, slay them, all of them.
[time=2195] Here's your crisis. There's the crisis that we find these boys in in chapter two of the book of Daniel. It is a matter of life and death.
[time=2206] It is a serious crisis. And the scene is in many ways familiar. Don't forget Daniel is still young, maybe 13, 14 by this time, still very far from home.
[time=2217] Nebuchadnezzar is as self-consumed and as evil as he's ever been. And while a godless, on-looking world observes, a young boy and his friend's faith is tested again.
[time=2235] And here we see the response. Here we see four things that when you look at these boys or when you look at others in Scripture or when you look at those in your life, who you've seen and who you've watched handle crisis well, I bet you've seen these four things again and again and again.
[time=2256] And they show up loud and clear right here in our passage this morning, four habits of a highly effective, god honoring, crisis managers, four things that go into a godly response to crisis. Look at verses 14 and 15, number one, number one, stay poised.
[time=2275] Look at verse 14, then Daniel replied with discretion and discernment to Ariak, the captain of the king's bodyguard who had gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon.
[time=2292] He answered and said to Ariak, the king's commander, for what reason is the decree from the king so urgent? And then Ariak informed Daniel about the matter.
[time=2303] See, Ariak's going to do his deal. He is going to kill these men and Daniel and you get the impression from the dialogue that here's Ariak and here's Daniel and Daniel's going, wait a minute, time out, what's going on here?
[time=2316] And he tells him what's going on. You're going to be killed. Those guys couldn't get it done. They didn't come through. He's gone ballistic your history.
[time=2328] And Daniel, it says, replies with discretion and discernment, those two words, great words, especially in the original language, you find that the word discretion in the ancient Hebrew means this, a cautious knowledge.
[time=2343] Think about you now, time out. Think about you. Again, let's stay practical. Think about you. I'll think about me.
[time=2352] You picture a crisis that you're in. You picture a crisis that you've been in lately. You picture yourself in a crisis you know you'll probably be in soon.
[time=2366] And then you think about these four things. Back to Daniel, staying poised, discretion, a cautious knowledge that is able to decipher right from wrong, good from evil, wise from unwise.
[time=2382] Discernment in the original language is a word that meant the ability to see clearly implied in the midst of confusion, the ability to see clearly to the heart of a matter.
[time=2398] And so with a cautious knowledge and an insightful spirit, he asks some questions and attempts to gain a good and accurate perspective of this crisis that has out of nowhere hit him.
[time=2411] And now he immediately put his life in danger. First response, he exercises discretion and discernment. He stays poised.
[time=2424] How do you do in that whole arena? Let's put up, let's say on the one hand, I mean compare you and your spouse, compare you and a good friend, compare you and one of your kids.
[time=2437] And on one side we'll say there are some of us who in the face of crisis have a real tendency to remain poised.
[time=2445] And there are some of us who in the midst of crisis have a real tendency to panic.
[time=2450] Where are you in that? My mind goes to our home when something, when I lose something, my mind goes to our home when I lose the keys.
[time=2462] What's that look like in your home? You know where I am? I'm panicked.
[time=2468] I'm ripping drawers apart. I'm throwing sheets. I'm instantly in this mode of where are they? And I'm asking my kids and they're like, "Oh, I don't know where your keys are."
[time=2481] And I'm asking my wife and she says, "I'm not sure." And I'm like, "Well, I need more than I'm not sure." I mean, where did you see him? Where did I have him? And I'm prone to, no, not always. I am prone to just under beds and under couches looking in the most ridiculous places.
[time=2495] Because I've just got to be, she loses something or when I ask her to help, you know, I'll find her in the kitchen leaning up against the counter with her arms folded thinking.
[time=2505] And I'll say, "What are you doing?" She'll say, "I'm thinking." You know, try it sometimes.
[time=2512] Calm down, just think and she'll think and she'll think and she'll stand there and she'll ponder and sometimes she'll just walk away.
[time=2518] I'll go, "Where are you going?" She goes, "Well, I don't know where they are, but I'll keep thinking." And I want action. Does that sound familiar at all? I mean, where are you? Are you a poised individual? Are you one prone to panic when crisis hits?
[time=2532] When bad news comes. Again, I tend to, she'll say, "I've got something I need to tell you." Boom! I'm gone.
[time=2542] I'm thinking, you know, what do we get back from the bank that says, "Now we owe." And the thing goes, "Oh, and I start to get, you know, who, you know, I think somebody died or somebody's hurt."
[time=2552] And she'll say, "I have something I need to tell you in my response." And she'll tell me, tell me, tell me, go ahead, tell me.
[time=2557] No, tell me, what is it? Panic.
[time=2563] Poise or panic. And watch this. My experience has been this. My experience has been in my own marriage and in the lives of those that I've lived life with.
[time=2574] That people who are more prone to poise, like my wife, tend to be people of great faith, tend to be people of great trust,
[time=2585] tend to be people much more prone to that kind of thinking and that kind of living. And if you look back on Daniel's experience, is it really any wonder?
[time=2595] I mean, is it really any wonder, is it any surprise at all that there is this lack of panic?
[time=2602] One author said it this way. I love this. He says, "In his youth, Daniel has already developed the ability to spot a miracle a mile away.
[time=2614] He can see it coming. He has now, even at his young age, learned the formula through which God often works.
[time=2621] He has seen firsthand that impossible situations plus urgency so many times equals divine intervention.
[time=2640] He works and acts of a loving, caring God. He has seen, even at a young age, that impossible situations that seem absolutely futile and hopeless.
[time=2655] You know of any? You've been a part of any recently? See this young boy has learned that impossible situations coupled with urgency.
[time=2665] You ever felt that? You ever felt the walls crashing down on you? You ever felt that sense of absolute despair?
[time=2673] And he has learned that the impossible and the urgent oftentimes in time equal, the grace and work and power of God, divine intervention.
[time=2685] And now in his life, the urgency quotient, which so quickly sends you and I running for cover, sends him and his friends to their one.
[time=2699] It sends him to their knees. It sends him to their knees. The urgency quotient, coupled with the impossible situation, sends him to their knees and there you find the second, second habit of highly effective God honoring crisis managers.
[time=2715] They stay prayerful. Look at verse 16. He's just gotten the news. He's just heard what's going down and there it says in verse 16.
[time=2722] Daniel went in and requested of the king that he would give him time in order that he might declare the interpretation to the king.
[time=2730] And then Daniel went to his house and informed his friends and and I and Ms. Shael and Azariah about the matter.
[time=2738] In order that verse 18, they might request compassion from the God of heaven concerning this mystery so that Daniel and his friends might not be destroyed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.
[time=2751] Now realize the first of our four points was stay poised and that's more of an attitude. That's more of a mindset. That's more of a perspective in a sense.
[time=2760] The second point is actually the first thing they actually went and did. The first physical literal response and it is so basic and it is so fundamental and yet so many times this response is so far from where you and I go.
[time=2780] So far from our self help determine your own destiny, write your own ticket mentality.
[time=2789] They had life and death crisis staring them in the eyes and they got on their knees and they pray.
[time=2796] They didn't rush out to find the latest book on crazed kings and their dreams.
[time=2803] They didn't huddle to discuss their own perspectives on the issue. They didn't conjure up or go and consult the experts. They didn't even put together an emergency plan in case things went south.
[time=2814] No, they got on their knees and they asked God for help. Plain and simple.
[time=2822] How about you? How about me this morning? When crisis hits, when things go wrong, what attitude do you typically initially evidence when crisis hits? Think about it.
[time=2838] Think about the last one you faced. Think about what came to your mind. Think about what came out of your mouth.
[time=2844] Think about what typically happens in your world when crisis comes crashing through your door.
[time=2850] Do words like irritated, come to mind, angry, tense, bothered, shut down, withdrawn, selfish, independent?
[time=2864] Words like that come to mind and your life they do in mind. I'm embarrassed to say, but they do in mind.
[time=2874] And isn't it tragic and isn't it sad that those are the kind of words that most often come to mind instead of words like prayerful, trusting and dependent?
[time=2889] Isn't it tragic that words like that seem not to make our top ten list of responses when faced with crisis?
[time=2897] What would it be like for you this week? And again, you just think about you. Think about your own life. Think about the crisis that you're in.
[time=2904] Think about the crisis that may come your way today or tomorrow. What would it be like for you this week if you made a commitment right now this morning to pray first?
[time=2915] Nothing said, nothing done, no phone call made, no book read, no tape listened to.
[time=2922] What would it be like for you and I if more and more so in the day to day of your life in mind we made a commitment to when it came crashing through our door regardless of what it looked like.
[time=2933] Our first commitment was to pray and to ask God right then and there for help, for assistance, for grace, for wisdom, for insight, for courage.
[time=2945] Nothing wrong with books and nothing wrong with tapes. Nothing wrong with the wise counsel of others.
[time=2952] But are you and I willing initially to set these things at the feet of a God who tells you and I that he is lovingly and with thought and with purpose ordering every event in our world and in our life?
[time=2968] And are you and I willing to take the hurt and the confusion and the pain and the not knowing and lay it at his feet first and say there it's yours help me deal with this well?
[time=2981] What would it be like if we were willing to do more of that and less of the other?
[time=2987] Well look at verse 19. God chooses to respond in a timely way. It says there in verse 19 in the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a night vision.
[time=3000] Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a night vision. God answers. God answers to Daniel's prayer.
[time=3010] And again, just like so many times before in these first two chapters, again Daniel does what we too often times don't do.
[time=3022] Think about it. How many times do you pray? Genuinely literally pray and ask and or beg God for help in this situation or that?
[time=3034] And how many times does he faithfully minister to you in that situation through answered prayer? And how many times do you and I not stop to say what?
[time=3046] Thank you. You are so sweet. You are so good to me to have done that, to have done this for me. Thank you so much.
[time=3063] I can't answer for you so many times I move through that but he stops and he says thanks. And I want you to look at this verse 20, 21, 22 and 23.
[time=3076] And you know what I want to do this morning? Because I feel like I wish I had prayed this. I wish I prayed this more often.
[time=3084] And as I look at my life, Daniel so captures my heart when I think about where God has brought me and what he has done with me.
[time=3091] And I bet you know what as you read through this, I bet it would represent in many ways your heart too.
[time=3096] So would you do me a favor this morning and would you out loud either from the screens or your own texts?
[time=3103] Would you read this out loud with me this morning and would you as you read this kind of make this a response from your own heart to God for the things you've seen him do, the stuff he's brought you through.
[time=3115] It is a prayer of adoration. It is a prayer of worship. It is a prayer of thanks. Read with me verses 20, 21, 22 and 23 just out loud.
[time=3126] Here we go. Daniel answered and said, "Let the name of God be blessed forever and ever for wisdom and power belong to him."
[time=3137] And it is he who changes the times and the epochs. He removes kings and establishes kings. He gives wisdom to wise men and knowledge to men of understanding.
[time=3150] It is he who reveals the profound and hidden things. He knows what is in the darkness and the light dwells with him.
[time=3159] "To thee, O God, of my fathers, I give thanks and praise. For thou hast given me wisdom and power, even now thou hast made known to me what we requested of these." Stop there.
[time=3174] For thou hast made known to us the king's manner.
[time=3179] It's a powerful answer to prayer and a powerful response. Now watch. Now watch what he does.
[time=3187] Third thing comes through loud and clear right here. Third thing.
[time=3192] He stays, well you know what, I'll just read the verse first, verse 24.
[time=3197] Verse 24, watch what he does. Therefore now, here he's been facing life and death. The crisis comes and now it's answered.
[time=3206] It's revealed and it says in verse 24, "Therefore he went to Ariak, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon.
[time=3212] He went and spoke to him as follows. Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon."
[time=3219] What's the first thing out of his mouth? First thing is the first thing, Ariak.
[time=3225] Hey, Ariak, time out. I got it. I'm saved. I'm safe. I'm back.
[time=3232] I was on the work, but now I'm here. I got your answer. Take me to the king right now, whereas he ain't Nebuchadnezzar.
[time=3238] I got it. No. In the midst of life and death crisis, having stayed poised and having stayed prayerful.
[time=3249] Now thirdly he stays preoccupied with whom? Others. Others around him. Others in need.
[time=3261] Well, was he in need? I think so, but he stays preoccupied in the midst of crisis with others.
[time=3269] Too many times in my life, maybe in yours when crisis hits, I'm asking questions like this. How will this affect me?
[time=3276] What will this do to my plans? How can I minimize my discomfort?
[time=3281] Those are the questions that too often come to mind. Daniel sees past his own circumstance and expresses concern for others.
[time=3289] Like Jesus. Just like the Lord in Luke 23. While being crucified, what did he say?
[time=3297] Father, wipe these pathetic, evil doers off the face of the earth.
[time=3302] Did he say that? No. Father, send these cowards to hell. Did he say that? No.
[time=3309] Father, they are hurting me and see to it please that they suffer. No. In the midst of crisis, our Lord exemplifies for us as well.
[time=3318] When he says father, forgive them. Father, forgive them. He stays preoccupied with others.
[time=3324] Father, forgive them for they know not what they do.
[time=3329] One more thing and we'll close. Fourth thing in the midst of crisis. In the midst of crisis, verses 25 to 28, this 14 year old boy, 1500 miles away from home with the then known world ruler who had just threatened his life.
[time=3345] Looking him right in the eye, he takes a deep breath. And number four, he is sensitive to truth telling opportunities.
[time=3355] He is sensitive right in the midst of crisis. Like a verse 25, "Then Ariak brought Daniel into the king's presence who spoke to him as follows.
[time=3362] I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who can make the interpretation known to the king."
[time=3368] 26, he asks him, "Are you able to make known to me this dream which I have seen?" And it's interpretation and Daniel says before the king.
[time=3376] As for the mystery about which the king is inquired, neither wise men, conjures, magicians, nor diviners are able to declare it to the king, however, and there he is right in his face.
[time=3389] However, there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries and he has made known to king Nebuchadnezzar what will take place in the latter days.
[time=3397] This was your dream and the visions in your mind while on your bed. How ready, how prepared, how willing are you?
[time=3407] And how willing and how ready am I in the midst of crisis to look for opportunities to speak the truth, to tell the truth, to share with people the truth about God, the truth about His Word, the truth about that Word and that God in your life.
[time=3424] What a great picture. Stay poised, stay prayerful, stay preoccupied with others, and in the midst of your circumstance, however big or small your crisis might be, are you willing to even in the midst of that be looking for truth-telling opportunities to share this or to share that or to say this or to ask that.
[time=3447] This young boy, these young men again, give us a great, great example of how to handle crisis in a way that honors God.
[time=3456] Well, let me invite you to stand, if you would, and let's pray and thank God for the help that He's given us this morning as we think through these kinds of situations.
[time=3466] Father, we pray this morning, and God, we ask you, as a people, to please give us the kind of insight and the kind of courage, God, the kind of grace to respond to crisis in a way that honors you.
[time=3477] These boys did it in a way, God, that was so truly humble and truly obedient.
[time=3485] And God, that's the kind of heart response we want to have with you, a humble, obedient, trusting response.
[time=3491] And so, God, take these words, please, and work in us so that we might be this, God, these kind of responders.
[time=3500] It'll come from every direction, God, we know.
[time=3502] Help us to respond in ways that are true and accurate. In your son's name we pray. Amen.
