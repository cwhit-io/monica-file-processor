[time=55] My dad was a great guy.
[time=57] We did everything for us, even though he was a pretty pitiful cook.
[time=62] But he was the best father a little girl could ever hope for.
[time=66] When dad died, we wanted to serve as special as he was.
[time=70] We found a funeral home that even let us bring in old photos and play his favorite song.
[time=75] They helped us remember his life, and that helped us get on with ours.

[time=84] She walked into column bond high school on Tuesday morning, a promising student.
[time=92] She was carried out more than 24 hours later, a Christian martyr.
[time=99] Do you believe in God?
[time=101] One of the heavily armed gunmen asked the shy blonde girl reading her Bible in the library while her school was under siege.
[time=109] "Yes, I believe in God." She replied in a voice strong enough to be heard by classmates, cowering under nearby tables and desks.
[time=123] The gunman in the long black trench coat laughed, "Why?"
[time=129] Then he raised his gun and shot and killed 17-year-old Casey Barnell.
[time=138] Later that night, Casey's little brother, Chris, found the journal entry on her desk.
[time=144] Apparently, as she had just made it, "Now I have given up on everything else.
[time=154] I have found it to be the only way to really know Christ and to experience the mighty power
[time=160] that brought him back to life again.
[time=165] To find out what it means to suffer and to die with him.
[time=169] So whatever it takes, I will be one who lives in the fresh newness of life,
[time=178] of those who are alive from the dead."

[time=192] Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=196] Thank you for joining us.
[time=197] We trust that the music and message from God's word will help you in your Christian walk.
[time=202] Please stay tuned. Now let's join our service.

[time=705] Let me invite you this morning to open your Bible to Daniel chapter three as we continue in our study of this amazing book Daniel chapter three and I find it wonderfully fitting
[time=716] that we get to come to the story of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, young Hebrew men about the age of 20, even as it is sort of graduation Sunday around here.
[time=727] What a fitting opportunity to speak from God's word.
[time=731] I'd like to begin by reading verses 16, 17, and 18 from chapter three of Daniel.
[time=737] Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to give you an answer concerning this.
[time=749] If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the furnace of blazing fire, and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king.
[time=761] But even if he does not, let it be known to you, O king, that we are not going to serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up.
[time=774] It is an amazing thing to watch a man or a woman with all of their native survival instinct in full force.
[time=785] Discover that they believe in something enough to lay down their lives for it.
[time=795] Martin Luther, in loneliness, on his way to face the inevitable hour of excommunication to appear before King Charles V and the Roman prelate, and all the princes assembled therein said this.
[time=808] "My cause shall be commended to the Lord, for he lives and reigns who preserve the three children in the furnace of the Babylonian king."
[time=822] If he is unwilling to preserve me, my life is a small thing compared with Christ.
[time=829] Expect anything of me except flight or recantation.
[time=835] I will not flee much less recant, so may the Lord Jesus strengthen me.
[time=844] His daughter Kennedy was an Anglican minister in England, and he was also a chaplain.
[time=850] In World War I, his duties as chaplain separated him from his family and took him to the trenches of France.
[time=857] Amidst the raging battles and with death all around him, he wrote this letter to his little son.
[time=864] The letter was through his wife because his son couldn't yet read.
[time=869] The first prayer I want my son to learn to say for me is not "God, keep daddy safe."
[time=878] The first prayer I want my son to learn is "God, make daddy brave."
[time=884] And if he has hard things to do, make him strong to do them.
[time=889] Life and death don't matter, my son, right and wrong do.
[time=895] Daddy dead is daddy still.
[time=900] But daddy dishonored before God is something too awful for words.
[time=906] I suppose you'd like to put in a bit about safety too, and mother would.
[time=911] Well, put it in afterwards, always afterwards, for it doesn't matter nearly as much.
[time=920] Stuttered Kennedy was right.
[time=922] Daddy dead is daddy still, but daddy dishonored.
[time=927] Daddy compromised.
[time=930] It's too awful for words.
[time=935] While we can't be absolutely certain of what happened, the Boston Globe last April 24th.
[time=942] Eileen McNamara wrote this, "Littleton, Colorado."
[time=948] She walked into Columbon High School on Tuesday morning a promising student.
[time=954] She was carried out more than 24 hours later, a Christian murder.
[time=962] Leaving God, one of the heavily armed gunmen asked the shy blonde girl reading her Bible in the library while her school was under siege.
[time=971] Yes, I believe in God.
[time=975] She replied in a voice, "Strong enough to be heard by classmates, cowering under nearby tables and desks."
[time=984] The gunman in the long black trench coat laughed, "Why?"
[time=990] Then he raised his gun and shot and killed 17-year-old Casey Barnell.
[time=999] Later that night, Casey's little brother, Chris, found the journal entry on her desk.
[time=1006] Apparently, as she had just made it, "Now I have given up on everything else.
[time=1015] I have found it to be the only way to really know Christ and to experience the mighty power that brought him back to life again.
[time=1026] And to find out what it means to suffer and to die with him.
[time=1030] So whatever it takes, I will be one who lives in the fresh newness of life of those who are alive from the dead."
[time=1044] End quote.
[time=1047] You see, it is truly an amazing thing to watch a man or a woman with all of their native survival instinct in full force.
[time=1059] Find that they believe in something enough to lay their life down for it.
[time=1067] This morning, I want to invite you to look back again at a very familiar story.
[time=1079] We'll pick the narrative up in verses one and two, the setting is that of the ceremony that the great Nebuchadnezzar had set.
[time=1086] Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, the height of which was sixty cubits, and its width six cubits.
[time=1093] He set it up on the plane of Dura in the province of Babylon.
[time=1099] Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent word to assemble the satraps, the perfects, the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates,
[time=1107] and all the rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
[time=1115] You see, what in the world is going on here?
[time=1118] What is this king Nebuchadnezzar doing?
[time=1121] Well, the fact is this.
[time=1123] King Nebuchadnezzar had conquered all the known world.
[time=1127] He had defeated every military army there was to defeat.
[time=1131] He was monarch of the known world.
[time=1135] But it is one thing to conquer a military strength that is another to have the allegiance, the love,
[time=1143] the dedication of those you have conquered.
[time=1146] And Nebuchadnezzar being this brilliantly successful military strategist, an amazing leader, a gifted and wise man,
[time=1154] was seeking to consolidate all of these conquered lands underneath one great umbrella, an umbrella of worship,
[time=1163] an umbrella of worship really that would transcend even patriotism because Nebuchadnezzar knew
[time=1171] that all of those conquered nations had their own systems of religion and nothing can be more divisive than religion.
[time=1179] And if he was ever going to be the supreme being, if he was ever going to fully consolidate his conquests,
[time=1186] he must not just call them to Babylon, he must call them to worship, something greater and higher than anything they had given themselves to heretofore.
[time=1197] And spinning off the great vision that was given to him, the dream which Daniel interpreted in Daniel chapter 2,
[time=1203] Nebuchadnezzar there being told he was the head of gold.
[time=1207] He makes this great image, 90 feet tall, 6 feet wide, probably sitting on yet some pedestal that was built for the occasion,
[time=1218] overlaid with gold and then placing it in the plane of Dura, which was a natural amphitheater valley just outside
[time=1226] the capital of Babylon.
[time=1229] He called them there to consolidate them under one great religious umbrella to unify them, to call for their allegiance and thereby strengthen his rule.
[time=1238] And you might imagine the enormous pressure that fell upon those in his rule.
[time=1244] There was the massive golden image, there was the flat plane of Dura surrounded by these foothills
[time=1251] which gave him a perch where he placed his fiery furnace whereby he could survey all of the leadership
[time=1259] that he had called for this moment.
[time=1262] The list is rather long in verse 2, let me break it down for you, three basic categories got summoned to the plane of Dura, number one the governors and the satraps and the perfect, so the prefects.
[time=1273] Those were the governors of the day, those were the men with the leadership for their particular province.
[time=1279] The second group are the judges, the lawyers and the sheariffs and they represent the law and order
[time=1285] and the enforcement thereof and the third basic group were the treasurers and they were the ones who held all the money.
[time=1292] And so he very wisely calls everybody who's anybody in terms of his political agenda to consolidate his empire
[time=1299] and he demands their presence on this plane of Dura.
[time=1304] Imagine the pump and the circumstance which must have surrounded this experience.
[time=1310] These were men of power, these were men delegated though it may be, they were men of great wealth, they were men of rule,
[time=1317] they were men of the sword and they would have come in their robes and their gowns wearing their jewels being escorted by their horses and chariots with military escorts and entourage, each of them coming from their various provinces filing their way under ceremony into this great plane of Dura.
[time=1334] And Nebuchadnezzar the most powerful man in the world is sitting to preside over it all.
[time=1340] Imagine what Regalia may have followed or surrounded him in his purge.
[time=1346] And Shadrach and Meshach and Abednego would have been among them.
[time=1350] They had been given responsibilities such that they were among this the privileged ruling class of the great Babylonian empire.
[time=1362] And they must face this one all by themselves.
[time=1365] Daniel is nowhere to be found in Daniel chapter 3.
[time=1369] And though he was front and center their leader in chapter 1 as they refused to eat the king's food,
[time=1376] he is conspicuously absent here, possibly sent by Nebuchadnezzar to some foreign country for some important duty.
[time=1385] And my hunch is Nebuchadnezzar loves by this time Daniel and knows he has a remarkable servant in Daniel
[time=1391] and knows already that Daniel would not bend the knee.
[time=1394] And so Nebuchadnezzar not wanting to lose a trusted valued friend and servant intentionally sends Daniel out of country
[time=1401] so he doesn't have to go. He will be the one exception to all of this.
[time=1407] But it leaves Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego in their early 20s all by themselves facing this great entourage of power and wealth and prestige
[time=1418] under the watchful gaze of the most powerful man in the world.
[time=1423] And their faith is thereby tested.
[time=1427] Notice verse 3. It's almost a direct repeat of verse 2.
[time=1432] Then the satraps, perfects, governors, counselors, treasures, judges, magistrates, and all the rulers of the provinces were assembled for the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
[time=1444] It's almost as if you say you know why two verses to say the same thing, why couldn't have just said they came.
[time=1448] I think the answer is it may be tongue-in-cheek, it may be that all the great ones were summoned in verse 2
[time=1454] and just like the spineless ones they are, they all came in verse 3.
[time=1459] Nobody would deny Nebuchadnezzar his right on this day.
[time=1464] Everybody who was called came and did just as he said and assembled just as he organized them,
[time=1470] standing on that plane in front of that great golden image glistening in the sun.
[time=1476] And then they would have heard the command found in verses 4, 5, and 6.
[time=1481] Then the herald loudly proclaimed, "To you the command is given O people's nations and men of every language,
[time=1488] that at the moment you hear the sound of the horn, the flute, the lyre, the trigon, the sultry, the bagpipe, all the kinds of music you are to fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up."
[time=1501] And here's the threat.
[time=1504] "Whoever does not fall down and worship shall immediately be cast into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire."
[time=1515] Nebuchadnezzar is not going to win the allegiance and consolidate his empire by being a winsome leader.
[time=1523] This is a great object lesson.
[time=1526] Think about it. How do you as king let everybody know that you're really king?
[time=1533] What's the best possible way for you to let them know that not only you are a king, you are a strong-handed king, and you will take the life of anyone who defies you?
[time=1541] You could send a letter which would take forever.
[time=1545] Probably the fastest, clearest means of transportation, but then there would be all the translations, there would be all the various languages, there would be all the room for misinterpretation, there would be the opportunities for certain in these great companies not to fully be alerted to what he has on his mind today.
[time=1562] And so he creates really in this plane of Dura a great object lesson, and he represented by the great statue,
[time=1568] and his furnace represents the very reality of capital punishment for anybody who does not do exactly what he says when he says it.
[time=1579] He is a brilliant man, a picture paints a thousand words.
[time=1584] And first he drags you into his plane, and then he shows you his statue, not truly of himself, but certainly representing himself, and then he says look at what befalls anyone who will not do what I say.
[time=1599] He makes his point.
[time=1603] Look at what happens in verse 7.
[time=1607] Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, the flute, the lyre, the trigon, the salt, and the bagpipe,
[time=1614] all kinds of music, here it is, all the peoples, nations and men of every language fell down
[time=1620] and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up, there it is, on cue everybody just hits the deck.
[time=1629] These are the intimidated, these are the non-thinking, these are the pragmatists, these are they who will gladly bow at anything,
[time=1639] so long as they can maintain their positions of power and prestige and prominence, and with that the double threat of avoiding that fiery furnace.
[time=1648] We will surely in that moment they in effect say to themselves, we will forsake our gods,
[time=1654] we will forsake the religions of our land, we will compromise ourselves here in front of everyone,
[time=1660] do whatever it takes to maintain this place of privilege.
[time=1665] They are spineless leaders of sorts, followers in reality.
[time=1673] So the great music is blown, they all bow and everybody hits the deck except these three 20 year old guys.
[time=1683] I would think they're together and can't you just see it, can't you just see the backs and the rear ends of everybody
[time=1694] and standing above them all are these three Hebrew boys refusing to bow.
[time=1701] I have often thought that if those were my three daughters if you will,
[time=1711] then I could be an invisible presence on that day, and the sound of that royal orchestra began to make its noise.
[time=1722] I began to see everybody else bend the knee and my kids are standing there.
[time=1731] I would want to whisper in their ear, keep standing, you know, stand tall, stand tall, you got it, keep it up.
[time=1745] I mean, doesn't everything in your heart explode with a sense of what is right and what is honorable and what is true
[time=1755] and what is lovely as these three young men just stand tall and say forget it, forget your image and forget you,
[time=1764] Mr. Ego Maniac and bring on the heat because we're not bound to that thing.
[time=1771] We have discovered something that means more to us than life itself.
[time=1781] When you can bring your children to the place, when you can bring your own heart to the place that you can discover
[time=1789] there is something greater to live for than life itself.
[time=1795] You have arrived.
[time=1798] Well, the conspiracy begins in verses eight and following.
[time=1802] Look at it, it says, "For this reason, at that time certain Chaldeans came forward and brought charges against the Jews."
[time=1811] They get into his presence and they do that, "Oh King, live forever, mucky muck," because they're a bunch of spineless guys themselves
[time=1818] and all they care about is the favor of the king.
[time=1820] Verse nine, "They respond that instead to Nebuchadnezzar the king, oh King, live forever." And then they go through the decree again, which I'll spare you.
[time=1828] Verse 12, "There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the administration of the province of Babylon,
[time=1835] namely Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
[time=1837] These men, O King, have disregarded you.
[time=1840] They do not serve your gods or worship the golden image which you have set up." This is laced with jealousy.
[time=1848] There is more envy that fills the heart of those Chaldeans.
[time=1851] Who are the Chaldeans?
[time=1852] The Chaldeans, that's another name for the Babylonians.
[time=1854] They are the host country.
[time=1855] They are native Babylonians.
[time=1857] They are of the seed, if you will, of the nation of Babylon.
[time=1860] And here Nebuchadnezzar has had the audacity to import various leaders from various countries among them,
[time=1867] Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
[time=1869] And he actually appointed these three men along with Daniel.
[time=1872] What does it say?
[time=1873] "Over the administration of the province of Babylon." That means that Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego are in charge of these whimpering Chaldeans
[time=1882] and they can't stand it.
[time=1884] It drives them nuts that they would be ruled by these Hebrews.
[time=1892] And they, as we will see, resurface they and their kind as they put their plot against Daniel and find a way to throw them into the lion's den.
[time=1899] They'll stop at nothing.
[time=1901] They will stop at nothing to have this position of privilege.
[time=1910] It's an amazing thing.
[time=1913] Well, what follows are the consequences.
[time=1916] Look at them there.
[time=1920] Excuse me.
[time=1921] What follows is this coercion, verse 13, watch.
[time=1924] Then Nebuchadnezzar, in a rage and anger, gave orders to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
[time=1929] Then these men were brought before the king.
[time=1933] Nebuchadnezzar responded and said to them, "Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego that you do not serve my gods or worship the golden image that he has set up?" Now, if you are ready, at the moment you hear the sound of the horn, the flute, the lyre, the tiger, and the salt of the bagpipe, all kinds of music to fall down and worship the image that I have made, then very well.
[time=1953] In other words, all can be forgiven.
[time=1956] I will give you grace.
[time=1958] And you get a sense, don't you, of just how valuable these young men are to him.
[time=1965] But he says, he goes on to say, "If you are not," verse 15, "if you will not worship,
[time=1977] you will immediately be cast in the midst of a furnace of blazing fire, and what God is there who can deliver you out of my hands." See, Nebuchadnezzar knew what was at stake here.
[time=1988] He was trying to establish a higher religious system.
[time=1991] And he must have felt very confident at this very moment with all of his royal guards surrounding him, these three unarmed Hebrew young men.
[time=2000] The furnace is right on proximity.
[time=2002] And it's kind of like, "You know what, this is going to happen so fast that nothing's going to stop me from doing this to you." No plague, no pestilence, no volcano, no illness upon myself.
[time=2012] He's just kind of saying to them, "What do you think is going to prevent me from popping you five feet or whatever it was into that furnace?" Man, he's full of rage and anger.
[time=2025] Those young men could see it in his face.
[time=2028] Later in the text, it says his face lost its normal expression.
[time=2031] It was contorted.
[time=2032] He began to make faces at them.
[time=2034] He was so angry.
[time=2037] But what I find in this coercion is what I call the dreaded second chance.
[time=2042] It isn't enough that the young men stood once on the plane.
[time=2046] I mean, couldn't they have just been immediately taken and thrown in?
[time=2049] But no.
[time=2050] As Satan often does, he brings the temptation back around for a second look.
[time=2057] It's one thing in that to stand once and have victory.
[time=2061] And then somehow that second take that Satan brings on temptation is where you oftentimes fall.
[time=2068] And this is a much heightened point.
[time=2071] Now they're not far away.
[time=2072] They're up close.
[time=2073] They can see his rage.
[time=2074] They can feel the intensity of his voice.
[time=2076] They know he is going to do what he says he's going to do.
[time=2078] They're in proximity to the fire itself.
[time=2080] And they do it again.
[time=2081] They resist temptation.
[time=2083] They stand strong.
[time=2086] Verse 16, we already read it.
[time=2087] Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said, "O Nebuchadnezzar." Now you'll notice there's no "O king live forever," gobbledygook.
[time=2094] This is straight out, "O Nebuchadnezzar." We do not need to give you an answer concerning this.
[time=2100] If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the furnace of blazing fire, and he will deliver us out of your hands, O king.
[time=2108] But even if he does not, let it be known to you, O king, that we are not going to serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up.
[time=2118] No flattery.
[time=2120] No false hope.
[time=2122] He is certainly able to deliver us.
[time=2124] And if he doesn't choose to, that's his call.
[time=2126] And it doesn't matter to us.
[time=2127] Because we don't serve him contingent upon whether he does what we want him to do.
[time=2132] Our allegiance to God is not bound to his working our life out in ways that we like.
[time=2137] You could slay us.
[time=2139] We don't care.
[time=2140] God may come through on this particular occasion.
[time=2142] He may not.
[time=2143] We don't care.
[time=2144] We are not going to give worship to that false image.
[time=2151] Courage, conviction, honor, character.
[time=2159] Wow.
[time=2163] Remember John and Peter?
[time=2166] They were running around preaching the gospel all on fire for the things of God.
[time=2171] They had seen their resurrected Lord.
[time=2173] They had hung around for Pentecost and been filled with the Holy Spirit.
[time=2177] And they were doing what God had asked him to do to proclaim the gospel of God.
[time=2180] They proclaimed the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=2183] And it was causing a ruckus.
[time=2185] And so in Acts 4, the authorities pulled them in.
[time=2191] And when they had summoned them, they commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.
[time=2197] They said, "You guys got to stop this." But Peter and John answered and said to them, "Whether it is right in the sight of God to give heed to you rather than to God, you be the judge.
[time=2208] For we cannot stop speaking what we have seen and heard." You know what they're saying there?
[time=2216] I'm sorry.
[time=2217] You figure that out on your own.
[time=2219] I can't stop speaking.
[time=2220] Why?
[time=2221] Because I have seen the risen Jesus Christ.
[time=2224] I have discovered already that there is something in my life more valuable to me than life itself.
[time=2232] You do whatever you're going to do.
[time=2233] And you solve the equation any way you want to, but as for us, we don't have a choice.
[time=2239] We are compelled by inner values that are so powerful in our hearts that nothing you can threaten
[time=2246] will overcome our ability and responsiveness to stay in line with the one we love.
[time=2253] It's even as Jesus had said, remember in Matthew 10 when he was sending out the 12 for the very first time?
[time=2259] And he's given him instructions on how to do what they were supposed to do.
[time=2262] He gives him a lot of great wisdom, a lot of great instruction.
[time=2266] He talks about being wise, you know, as serpents, true to serpents, gentlest doves,
[time=2272] going out in the midst of wolves, all that stuff.
[time=2274] He comes to the near the end of that he says, "Therefore, do not fear them.
[time=2279] For there is nothing covered that will not be revealed and hidden that will not be known.
[time=2284] What I tell you in darkness, speak in the light, and what you hear whispered in your ear,
[time=2290] you proclaim it on the housetops." He is saying, "You go give a bold, unabashed, unashamed, uncovered testimony to who I am
[time=2299] and what I have taught you and what this whole thing is about." And then he says this, "And do not fear those who kill the body, but are unable to kill the soul, but rather fear him who is able to destroy both body and soul in hell."
[time=2316] And then he comes back with this powerful picture.
[time=2319] Jesus says, "Are not two sparrows sold for a cent?
[time=2322] And yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your father.
[time=2326] But the very hairs of your head are numbered, which I think is getting a lot easier for the Lord these days, at least in my case.
[time=2334] Therefore do not fear." He says, "You are of more value than many sparrows."
[time=2341] And then he says these immortal words, "Everyone therefore who shall confess me before men,
[time=2349] I will also confess before my father who is in heaven.
[time=2355] But whoever shall deny me before men, I will also deny him before my father who is in heaven."
[time=2363] Here they are.
[time=2366] Nearly a thousand years before Jesus has even had a chance to teach His disciples that truth, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, face to face with an egomaniac, the most powerful man in the world, getting a second chance, getting a second chance now to escape His wrath, and they'll have nothing of it.
[time=2388] It was their moment of truth.
[time=2391] Adventure, they never forgot that moment, not because of what is about to happen next.
[time=2397] I think that must have been collateral in their thinking.
[time=2400] The reason they will never forget that moment or never did forget that moment in my thinking is because it was the day it was their moment of truth, their true colors show they get to find out if they really love their God more than they love themselves.
[time=2416] The consequences are found in verses 19 and 23, then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with wrath and his facial expression was altered toward Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
[time=2426] He answered by giving orders to heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated.
[time=2430] That's a pretty angry, egomaniac reaction.
[time=2434] You just lose control of yourself.
[time=2436] If you wanted to cause suffering, it has said tone it down a little bit.
[time=2439] The greater the heat, the quicker they die.
[time=2442] He commanded certain valiant warriors who were in his army to tie them up.
[time=2446] In order to cast them into the furnace of blazing fire, verse 21, then these men were tied up in their trousers, their coats, their caps, their other clothes that were cast into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire.
[time=2457] For this reason, because the king's command was urgent and the furnace had been made extremely hot, the flame of the fire slew those men who carried up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
[time=2467] But these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego fell into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire still tied up.
[time=2477] No sign of struggle.
[time=2481] They didn't fight it.
[time=2484] They didn't resist it.
[time=2486] As they were being drawn closer and closer to the fire, they didn't recant.
[time=2490] They didn't ask for a third chance.
[time=2492] They didn't curse the king who was doing it.
[time=2497] They didn't plea bargain.
[time=2499] They just bravely went to their death.
[time=2510] But look at the response of the God who loves them, verses 24 and 25.
[time=2516] Then Nebuchadnezzar, the king was astounded.
[time=2518] He stood up and hased, he responded and said to his high officials, "Was it not three men that we cast bound into the midst of that fire?" and they answered instead of the king, "Surgily, okay." He answered and said, "Look, I see four men loosed and walking about in the midst of the fire without harm,
[time=2536] and the appearance of the fourth is like one of the sons of the gods." Man, he said a lot of things have changed here in the last millisecond.
[time=2547] We put three in, there's four.
[time=2549] We put them in tide, they're loose.
[time=2551] We put them in to burn up, and they are without harm.
[time=2555] And this fourth guy, where did he come from?
[time=2559] He looks like that, by the way, is not a comment on Nebuchadnezzar's part to have recognized the son of God as in Jesus Christ.
[time=2565] There are theophanes in the Old Testament, pre-incarnate revelations of Jesus Christ.
[time=2569] We have no idea if this is one, there are certain proofs you have to have for a theophany.
[time=2573] This could have been Jesus, but it's more likely it was just an angel.
[time=2576] Just.
[time=2578] And his commenting on it as the son of God would have been a very common phrase for a polytheist, if you will,
[time=2585] as Nebuchadnezzar was.
[time=2590] Compassion of God is to meet them there.
[time=2592] He sends probably an angel, you know, in the midst.
[time=2595] And who knows what the angel was doing in there, but probably explaining everything.
[time=2599] You're going to be okay.
[time=2600] The reason you're not burning up is because God is honoring your faith today.
[time=2603] You know, you're not dead, you're not in heaven, you're going to walk out of this fire in just a minute, he'll catch on.
[time=2608] Verse 26, then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the door of the furnace of blazing fire.
[time=2615] He responded and said, "Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego, come out.
[time=2619] You servants of the Most High God, and come here." Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the midst of the fire and the satraps, perfects, governors, kings, high officials gathered around and saw in regard to these men that the fire had no effect on the bodies of these men, nor was the hair of their head singed,
[time=2638] nor were their trousers damaged, nor had they even the smell of fire upon them.
[time=2643] Isn't that amazing?
[time=2645] There had been around a fire and had something burned, you know what that's about.
[time=2648] Nebuchadnezzar responded and said, "Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel and delivered his servants, who put their trust in him, violating the king's command,
[time=2659] and yielded up their bodies so as not to serve or worship any God except their own God."
[time=2667] There's a total pagan, an ego-media, king Nebuchadnezzar giving glory to God
[time=2674] that he is the only true and living God, and giving glory to Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego because of their simple trust in him.
[time=2684] Therefore, verse 29, I make a decree that any people, nation, or tongue that speaks anything offensive
[time=2690] against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego shall be torn, limb from limb, and their houses reduced to rubbish, and as much as there is no other God who is able to deliver in this way,
[time=2704] then the king caused Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to prosper in the province of Babylon.
[time=2711] Isn't that amazing?
[time=2713] Do you remember when we started this series about three weeks ago?
[time=2718] I told you that God had raised up the nation of Israel to be a missionary nation, remember?
[time=2724] That he made a unilateral covenant with Abraham, and then later a conditional covenant
[time=2730] that if they would just obey the law of God, that God would so bless the nation of Israel, that all these other false religious systems would eventually crumble to the knowledge that, you know what, their God is bigger, he's greater, he's better.
[time=2742] They got more crops, they got more kids, they got more money, they got more happiness.
[time=2746] They got everything we're hoping our gods will give us, but their God really does give it to them.
[time=2752] And in that they were to dispense the knowledge which leads to faith to all of these, you know,
[time=2758] lost, hell-bound, thousands, hundreds, millions of people in these nations that were all going to be going to hell, and God wanted to save them all from the nation of Israel.
[time=2768] Do you remember I told you that the Israel's lights didn't give a rip about that commissioning that God had given them, and so they lived as selfish, sinful people, and they violated the conditional covenant year after year after year, and if you obeyed the law of God and the conditional covenant you got blessed, and if you disobeyed you got disciplined.
[time=2785] And you remember that this whole Babylonian captivity was nothing more than a disciplining hand of God upon his own people for their failure to obey his word and tell others about the true living God.
[time=2798] Now don't you find it interesting that first with Daniel in chapter 1 and now Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
[time=2805] Nebuchadnezzar calls a great assembly of everybody who's anybody in leadership and power in the world
[time=2812] to worship him, and the without force, the without an agenda, the simple trusting obedience of these three young men
[time=2826] cause the whole redemptive plan of God through the thousands of years of Israel's history
[time=2833] to reach a climax as the egomaniac himself declares who the true and living God is.
[time=2841] That is an amazing thing to me.
[time=2846] When everybody else in the household of God had given up and bowed down, how many other Hebrews did bow down that day?
[time=2854] We're not told, but there surely may have been some.
[time=2857] When the whole nation is given up on the kingdom program and they're in exile captive in Babylon,
[time=2864] God still gives the word that you can be saved.
[time=2870] And here all these leaders go back to their provinces and tell that story.
[time=2876] And the word of Yahweh goes forth.
[time=2880] It's an amazing thing.
[time=2884] I want to close this morning with one simple point of application.
[time=2891] I want to encourage you not to make the same mistake everybody else is making with respect to Columbine High School
[time=2897] and that whole tragedy.
[time=2902] All the news commentators, all the social analysts, all the psychologists, all the educators, all the governors of states
[time=2915] are asking the wrong question about Columbine High.
[time=2922] They're trying to figure out why those boys did what they did.
[time=2927] And the question they should be probing isn't why did those boys kill their classmates?
[time=2936] The question they should be asking is why did Cassie stand up?
[time=2941] Isn't that the real question of the day?
[time=2945] What is it that happened in her heart and her life that caused her to stand up for something she believed in
[time=2952] in the sheer risk of her own life?
[time=2955] If you can find the answer to that question, you can solve the social problems of our country.
[time=2960] Finding out what went wrong in the hearts of these boys takes you nowhere towards a solution.
[time=2971] And you know what it was with Cassie?
[time=2973] It was more than her parents.
[time=2978] It was a lot more than her peer acceptance.
[time=2981] It was a lot more than certain principles and convictions that she held at the core of her being.
[time=2986] Do you know what it was with Cassie?
[time=2991] Cassie had fallen in love with Jesus Christ.
[time=2998] And long before the moment of her crisis, she had discovered that walking with him was better than life itself.
[time=3011] Again, I'll read you her quote.
[time=3012] I hope they have it for the screen.
[time=3015] There it is.
[time=3016] Look at it again.
[time=3017] Look at this.
[time=3018] Now I have given up on everything else.
[time=3021] I have found it to be the only way to really know Christ and to experience the mighty power that brought him back to life again.
[time=3030] And to find out what it means to suffer and to die with him.
[time=3033] So whatever it takes, I will be one who lives in the fresh newness of life of those who are alive from the dead.
[time=3044] Hold that right there, will you?
[time=3048] It's been an interesting encounter this week.
[time=3051] I had a member of our church come into my office rather unexpectedly.
[time=3056] We actually met each other in the parking lot and the person was about to leave and they saw me pull up and they jumped out their car and they said,
[time=3062] "Man, I'm glad you're here. I was hoping to see you." I said, "Well, come on in." And so we sit down at my office and I shut the door and I say, "So, what do you want to talk about?" The person said, "Oh, nothing really." Now, I've seen this before. You've got something heavy on your heart.
[time=3079] You're looking for help. You're all spiritually screwed up, weren't you?
[time=3082] But you don't want to, and you don't know how, and you don't know if you can just say that.
[time=3087] So without saying all that to her, I was just thinking that in my mind, I said, "So how is everything going in your relationship with Christ?" I looked down, she felt a little bit.
[time=3098] Not so good.
[time=3100] I said, "Well, ask me this question. Are you happy?
[time=3107] Do you like your life? Are you enjoying things these days?"
[time=3114] She said, "No. I hate my life. I hate my life."
[time=3121] And then I asked her this third question. I said, "What? What is it?
[time=3125] What specifically is it that is keeping you from totally surrendering your life to Christ?
[time=3130] Not becoming a Christian. She's already that." Totally. What are the, you know, in my mind, I'm thinking, "What are the two or three things that Satan has his hooks in you with?
[time=3139] What are the couple of things that got you from the world?
[time=3142] What are the carnal things that got a hold of your heart right now that are keeping you from total surrender to Jesus Christ?" I didn't say all that, but that's how I tried to ask myself.
[time=3152] What is it that's keeping you from total surrender to Christ?
[time=3157] And she wouldn't answer me.
[time=3161] The best she could do was say, "Oh, well, just the fear, you know, that if I give those things up, I won't have any fun anymore." And I connected with that, you know, there is this allure of sin, isn't there?
[time=3177] There is this promise that there is more in life than Christ.
[time=3184] There is this promise that there's something that can deliver for your soul in a way that Christ can't do it, and it's a lie.
[time=3192] But she was honest enough to admit that she wasn't ready to do that yet
[time=3199] because she's just too afraid of not having any fun anymore.
[time=3208] You know what you see in Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and this commitment to obedience, not to worship idols?
[time=3215] You know what you see in Martin Luther on his way to the died of worms?
[time=3219] Do you know what you read about in Cassie's little journal there?
[time=3225] What you find are people that are bound not to religion.
[time=3229] They are bound not merely to obedience to some moral code that comes from a book.
[time=3235] They are not just trying to avoid guilt in their life or the disciplining hand of God.
[time=3240] They are proactively recognizing that Jesus Christ is life.
[time=3246] He is all there is.
[time=3248] And when you forfeit complete, intimate community with Christ, you give it away.
[time=3260] Because that's the only terms that you find the sweet wonder of your Christian life.
[time=3269] It's when you're in total surrender to him, not his book, but to him.
[time=3280] So I invite you this morning to proactively recognize that Christ is your life.
[time=3286] And when you walk with him, moment by moment, and you surrender to his perfect ways, you are fully alive.
[time=3299] And you will be free to die.
[time=3306] Oswald Sanders, in his book My Upmost for His Highest, has a little segment on abandonment to Christ.
[time=3314] I invite you to read it to you as we close.
[time=3318] Beware of an abandonment which has the commercial spirit in it.
[time=3323] "I'm going to give myself to God because I want to be delivered from my sin, because I want to be made holy." All of that is the result of being right with God.
[time=3333] But that spirit is not the essential nature of Christianity.
[time=3336] Abandonment is not for anything at all.
[time=3340] You've got so commercialized that we only go to God for something from him and not for himself.
[time=3346] It's like saying, "No, Lord, I don't want you.
[time=3349] I want myself, but I want myself clean and filled with the Holy Ghost.
[time=3353] I want to be put in your showroom and be able to say this is what God has done for me."
[time=3359] If we only give up something to God because we want more back, there is nothing of the Holy Spirit in our abandonment.
[time=3367] It is miserable, commercial self-interest that we gain heaven,
[time=3374] that we are delivered from sin, that we are made useful to God.
[time=3378] These things never enter as considerations into real abandonment, which is, listen to this, which is a personal sovereign preference for Jesus Christ himself.
[time=3390] Oh man, that's big. A personal sovereign preference for Jesus Christ.
[time=3397] What does that mean? That means that God has made you with a will.
[time=3402] You are image bearers and you get to choose what you're going to love.
[time=3410] And Shadrach and Meshach and Abednego stand through history and they say, "Listen, friends, not for what you're going to get out of God, but because of who God is, use your personal sovereign will to set your affections and your values and your love and your life not on a religion and not on a book, but on the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=3433] Walk with Him day in and day out.
[time=3438] Live with Him moment by moment and you will find your life.
[time=3446] So alive that without much preparation, as I think these boys did not have,
[time=3453] you'll be ready to die.
[time=3456] Let me invite you to stand for a closing word prayer.
[time=3466] Our gracious God and Heavenly Father, we look back through the pages of time and find these three young men standing tall and strong.
[time=3474] Oh God, we know they found it. Everything in a screams.
[time=3478] That's who I want to be. That's how I want to live.
[time=3482] Those are the kinds of convictions about you that I want to curse through my veins.
[time=3488] Oh God, give us the grace to get there.
[time=3491] And that getting there begins right now by letting go of anything and everything that keeps us from complete surrender to you.
[time=3502] And so Father, stir in our hearts, show us the emptiness of sin, the thin veneer of the wicked one.
[time=3508] And let us jettison, let us set aside the things which so easily entangle us.
[time=3515] And let us run, run with endurance, the race that is set before us, fixing our eyes on Jesus,
[time=3522] the author and perfecter of our faith.
[time=3528] We pray these things in Christ's name, and all God's people say.
[time=3532] Amen. God bless you.
