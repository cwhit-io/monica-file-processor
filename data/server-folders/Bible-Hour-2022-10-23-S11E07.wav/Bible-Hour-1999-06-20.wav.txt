[time=30] With no aid to devotion, for 70 years Daniel remained utterly true to God under unthinkable
[time=55] circumstances.
[time=60] You and I have a tough week if we missed last Sunday.
[time=65] You and I struggle morally and relationally when we don't meet with God on a regular basis.
[time=71] And here's Daniel.
[time=72] Nothing externally motivating within a thousand miles.
[time=75] Nothing but one arrogant, foolish, ungodly king after another.
[time=80] Nothing but one drunken banquet after another.
[time=84] And his reputation and his testimony were as impeccable this day as they were 65 years
[time=91] before when as a young boy he got elevated to leadership.
[time=97] Don't miss that as you see Daniel standing again before a king, verses 14 through 16.
[time=109] Now I have heard about you, he says, that a spirit of the gods is in you and that illumination
[time=115] inside and extraordinary wisdom have been found in you.
[time=119] Just now the wise men and the conjurers were brought in before me that they might read this inscription and make its interpretation known to me, but they could not declare the interpretation of the message.
[time=128] But I personally have heard about you that you are able to give interpretations and solve difficult problems now if you are able to read the inscription and make its interpretation known to me you will be clothed with purple which was a sign of unending wealth.
[time=145] You will be clothed with purple and wear a necklace of gold around your neck and you will have authority as the third ruler in the kingdom.
[time=161] Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=165] Thank you for joining us, we trust that the music and message from God's word will help you in your Christian walk.
[time=171] Please stay tuned, now let's join our service.
[time=174] This is my father's world.
[time=179] Though battle is not done, Jesus who died shall be satisfied and earth and hand be won.
[time=198] This is my father's world, oh let me never forget that all the wrongsings of so strong
[time=213] God is the ruler yet, this is my father's world, not that all is not done, Jesus who died
[time=231] shall be satisfied and earth and hand be won.
[time=242] I am sorry, I am sorry, I am sorry, I am sorry, I am sorry, I am sorry, I am sorry,
[time=706] [MUSIC - 396 seconds]
[time=1107] - Well, we come this morning to a chapter in our study,
[time=1123] this great book of Daniel.
[time=1124] A chapter that brings with it both high drama and profound warning.
[time=1129] It is high stakes, fast lane living met by a sobering reminder
[time=1135] of who is really in charge.
[time=1138] It is the one chapter story of an arrogant fool named Belsazar and his proud defiant unwillingness to live life in the light of lessons previously learned by others.
[time=1150] It is the story of one who should have known better, but instead tested and mocked the goodness and patience of God.
[time=1158] Now, what do I mean when I say lessons learned by others?
[time=1163] Well, by way of introduction, let's set the stage for chapter five and we'll see how one generation's revival became another generation's rebellion.
[time=1173] And I want you to go back just to where we were last week.
[time=1176] As Russell finished up Daniel four, you'll remember in verses 34 and 35.
[time=1182] Nebuchadnezzar having gone through all that he had been through and having been shown by God who God was and what God can do and the rightful place that God deserved in his life and in his kingdom.
[time=1193] In verses 34 and 35 of chapter four, Nebuchadnezzar sings the praises of God and then in 36, pick it up there, it says at that time.
[time=1202] My reason returned to me and my majesty and splendor were restored to me for the glory of my kingdom and my counselors and my nobles began seeking me out.
[time=1211] So I was reestablished in my sovereignty and surpassing greatness was added to me.
[time=1216] Now, verse 37, I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise, exalt and honor the king of heaven.
[time=1224] For all his works are true in his ways just and he is able to humble those who walk in pride.
[time=1230] And Nebuchadnezzar knew all about the humbling that takes place in the lives of those that walk in pride.
[time=1237] Well, Nebuchadnezzar eventually dies.
[time=1241] He dies in time and after Nebuchadnezzar's death, now pull out your chart, pull out your insert from your bulletin and follow along, if you will.
[time=1250] And as I read through this information, you can kind of follow along on the chart.
[time=1254] I hope it's clear.
[time=1255] After Nebuchadnezzar's death, it didn't take long for the dry rod of greed and ambition to eat away the branches of the royal family tree.
[time=1264] His son, Evil Meridoc, nice name.
[time=1268] Evil Meridoc rained only two years before his power hungry brother-in-law, General Nara Glisser.
[time=1275] General Nara Glisser assassinated him and stole the crown.
[time=1278] After a six-year reign, Nara Glisser died and his young son, Labashi Mardoc.
[time=1285] They had a good time naming people back then, didn't they?
[time=1289] His young son, Labashi Mardoc stepped into power.
[time=1292] His rule though lasted only a few months before he was murdered in a coup by Nabonitis.
[time=1300] Nabonitis.
[time=1301] Now, Nabonitis, as King spent most of his reign away from Babylon, he was a warrior, he was a fighter, he was a military man, he spent most of his time securing foreign lands and strengthening the empire.
[time=1316] And so he appointed his son, his son, Belshazzar, as co-ruler and left him in charge of Babylon.
[time=1325] Now, don't forget Babylon, all right?
[time=1327] Repaint the picture in your mind one more time.
[time=1330] This is an awesome city, an incredible place.
[time=1333] 60 miles around with a wall surrounding the entire city, 350 feet tall.
[time=1341] Think about it, 87 feet wide, guarded constantly
[time=1347] by four golden chariots, all abreast, next to each other, pulled by four black stallions.
[time=1355] There was a mighty city, a 30-foot moat surrounded Babylon.
[time=1360] It had been said for years that no one could get through, there were inside the storehouses, 20 years worth of supplies, 20 years worth of water, 20 years worth of wheat and grain, 20 years worth of food for 1.2 million people.
[time=1380] And so there sits Belshazzar in his heavily fortified city lounging comfortably on his velvet covered throne.
[time=1389] No one had ever invaded the city, no one had ever tried to storm it for over 1,000 years.
[time=1396] For over 1,000 years it stood, strong and impenetrable.
[time=1401] And now all of that was about to change, for you see in 539 BC, in 539 the Medo Persians, the Medes and the Persians had combined to do battle against this nation.
[time=1415] The Medo Persian military is now in 539 marching toward Babylon.
[time=1420] Having defeated Nabonitis, they are committed to and ready to conquer and overthrow Belshazzar and this great city.
[time=1429] And historians tell us that Belshazzar was aware of this, but he knew it.
[time=1434] He had received word of the defeat and he knew the Medo Persians were on their way.
[time=1439] And so what does he do?
[time=1441] And here we come to our text in chapter five.
[time=1443] What does he do?
[time=1445] Well in all of his smug arrogance, he throws a party.
[time=1452] He makes the impending doom and he mocks the impending doom and lavishly proclaims his and Babylon's invincibility.
[time=1461] He throws what we will call and look at first here in our time this morning, number one, a feast to remember.
[time=1469] He throws a feast to remember.
[time=1472] Look at what it says in verse one.
[time=1473] Belshazzar the king held a great feast for a thousand of his nobles and he was drinking wine in the presence of the thousand.
[time=1483] With his head spinning from the wine, Belshazzar feels this euphoric sense of strength, this euphoric sense of boldness and in his drunken bravado.
[time=1494] Watch what he does.
[time=1496] In this drunken state, he performs a brazen act of blasphemy.
[time=1501] An act of blasphemy that had not been attempted, that had not been done by any of the previous Babylonian rulers.
[time=1510] Look at what he dared to do, verse two.
[time=1514] When Belshazzar tasted the wine, he gave orders to bring the gold and silver vessels, which Nebuchadnezzar, his father, now stop there.
[time=1524] It's an unfortunate rendering there, really as you look back on our chart and as you look back on the Hebrew word for father, this word here is really translated for father.
[time=1535] So I don't want it to be confusing for you, but Nebuchadnezzar was his grandfather.
[time=1540] Hebrew word father means for father, so just so you know.
[time=1543] Bring him, he says he wants the vessels which Nebuchadnezzar, his father or grandfather, had taken out of the temple.
[time=1551] Member back in chapter one, which was in Jerusalem.
[time=1554] In order that the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines might drink from them.
[time=1559] Then they brought the gold vessels that had been taken out of the temple, the house of God, which was in Jerusalem, and the king and his nobles and his wives and his concubines drank from them.
[time=1571] They drank the wine and praised the gods of gold and silver, of bronze, iron, wood and stone.
[time=1579] Amazing.
[time=1581] These temple vessels had been used in the temple back in Jerusalem.
[time=1586] They were sacred vessels and they had been used to communicate honor and reverence to Jehovah God.
[time=1594] And by using them to toast his own gods, Belchysar shows his utter contempt for the lessons learned by his grandfather and he shows his utter disrespect for the true and living God.
[time=1609] One author that I read this week painted a vivid picture and he tried to kind of set the scene, see if you can't put yourself in that room.
[time=1618] He says, "Belchysar took the temple goblet "and filled it with his own private wine.
[time=1623] "And smirking with arrogance, slop the crimson liquid "to his lips and as it dribbled down his beard, "he glares in each direction with that, "look what I've done, look on his face.
[time=1635] "It is as if he was possessed by the very devil, "he was honoring.
[time=1640] "He has done it, a thousand gasp, "and suddenly a cheer breaks out, "blasphemously applauding this pathetic act.
[time=1649] "Belchysar sinks down back into his elegant throne, "the music and erotic dancing begin again "and he thinks to himself quietly there on the throne, "look at what I've become.
[time=1659] "Finally, somebody."
[time=1665] Well, you and I know that pride always comes before the what?
[time=1669] The fall.
[time=1671] And man, what a fall this guy's about to take.
[time=1675] Keep coming with me here, verse five.
[time=1678] Suddenly, suddenly the fingers of a man's hand emerged
[time=1686] and began writing opposite the lampstand on the plaster of the wall of the king's palace.
[time=1692] And the king saw the back of the hand that did the writing.
[time=1696] Now picture that.
[time=1699] It's not something that looks like fingers.
[time=1706] It is the back of a hand that all of a sudden shows up in the middle of this palatial orgy.
[time=1714] And immediately, the party comes to a screeching halt.
[time=1721] It says, "Belchysar saw the back of the hand "as it writes on the wall." And now look.
[time=1728] Now look what happens to our defiant legend in his own mind, bold, brazen king.
[time=1736] Look at verse six.
[time=1737] Then the king's face grew pale.
[time=1739] The king's face grew pale and his thoughts alarmed him and his hip joints went slack and his knees began knocking together.
[time=1751] I can't help but laugh when I read that.
[time=1753] I mean think about it.
[time=1755] Instant sobriety.
[time=1757] Talk about a big cup of coffee.
[time=1759] Boom.
[time=1760] He's back.
[time=1763] His attention's been gotten.
[time=1764] And you gotta know down deep inside.
[time=1767] You gotta realize that he knew he was in trouble.
[time=1771] You see, he had heard enough.
[time=1773] He was ignoring it.
[time=1775] But he had heard enough.
[time=1775] He had seen enough.
[time=1777] He knew enough of what God had done.
[time=1778] You gotta know down deep in his heart.
[time=1780] He knows he's in big, big trouble.
[time=1782] He's gotta know it's over.
[time=1783] And so now watch him scramble.
[time=1785] Verse seven, the king called aloud, calls out to bring the conjurers, the Chaldeans and the diviners.
[time=1793] The king spoke and said to the wise men of Babylon, "Any man who can read this inscription and explain its interpretation to me will be clothed with purple and have a necklace of gold around his neck and have authority as the third ruler of the kingdom." Man, he's scrambling, he offers junior king status.
[time=1816] Third ruler in all of the kingdom to anyone who can explain this to him.
[time=1821] He in essence offers these wise men the most prestigious position available short of being king.
[time=1827] Verse eight, then all the king's wise men came in.
[time=1834] But they could not read the inscription or make known its interpretation to the king.
[time=1840] Now you gotta help me out here.
[time=1841] I was thinking about this this week.
[time=1843] These wise men, they've not had a good book so far.
[time=1847] I mean, if you've been tracking with us through the first five chapters, these guys have been called upon again and again and again.
[time=1852] Nebuchadnezzar chapter two, dream interpretation.
[time=1855] Guys, help me out.
[time=1856] Could they do it?
[time=1856] No, they didn't have a clue.
[time=1858] Chapter four, Nebuchadnezzar calls upon the wise men.
[time=1862] "Lend me an interpretation, help me understand." Could they do it?
[time=1865] No.
[time=1866] Chapter five, Belshazzar.
[time=1868] Lessons not learned.
[time=1870] Calls upon the wise men.
[time=1871] Can they do it?
[time=1872] No.
[time=1873] I mean, these guys are batten, zero, zero, zero.
[time=1876] They stink, they're a horrible wise man and nobody seems to be figuring it out.
[time=1880] And it reminded me this week, kind of in a more somber way.
[time=1886] It reminded me of me and it reminded me maybe of you.
[time=1889] Isn't it amazing how we're creatures of habit?
[time=1893] Isn't it amazing how when you think about you and your life and I look back on mine, how time and time and time again?
[time=1902] We run back to things that don't work.
[time=1905] We run back to places that don't fulfill.
[time=1909] Creatures of habit who need to learn lessons and sometimes don't.
[time=1914] Well, they didn't have an answer for them.
[time=1918] They couldn't read the inscription.
[time=1919] They couldn't help them out.
[time=1920] And verse nine says that Belshazzar was greatly bothered.
[time=1924] His face now more pale and the wise men completely dumbfounded.
[time=1929] And once again, just like before, who gets called out of the bullpen to come save the day?
[time=1939] Who comes and is asked to bring clarity?
[time=1942] Well, Daniel, our guy, finds himself in the middle of the king's court once again.
[time=1947] Look what it says in verse 10.
[time=1949] We meet a lady called the queen.
[time=1951] Says there in verse 10, the queen entered the banquet hall.
[time=1954] Now stop there.
[time=1955] Historians would tell us and commentators agree that this lady, the queen, as she's described here in chapter five, verse 10, was more than likely a younger widow, one of the many younger widows of Nebuchadnezzar.
[time=1971] She was still around.
[time=1973] She probably is not Belshazzar's wife.
[time=1977] She is more than likely left over in the king's court from the days of Nebuchadnezzar.
[time=1983] And when you ask the question why, well, it's clear as you see what she says.
[time=1988] She lends perspective.
[time=1990] She lends insight.
[time=1992] Brushing off the dust of the past, the queen mother brings Daniel back to the forefront in this ongoing Babylonian saga of solving royal mysteries.
[time=2003] Look what it says there.
[time=2005] The queen entered the banquet hall because of the words of the king and his nobles.
[time=2010] The queen spoke and said, "Oh, king, live forever.
[time=2013] "Do not let your thoughts alarm you "or your face be pale, for there is a man in your kingdom "in whom is a spirit of the holy gods.
[time=2021] "And in the days of your father, illumination, insight, "and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods were found in him.
[time=2028] "And king Nebuchadnezzar, your father, "your father, the king, appointed him chief "of the magicians, conjures, caldians, and diviners." Verse 12, "This was because an extraordinary spirit, "knowledge and insight, interpretation of dreams, "explanation of enigmas, and solving of difficult problems "were found in this Daniel, whom the king named Beltashazar.
[time=2054] "Let Daniel now be summoned, and he will declare "the interpretation." As we read that, and as you see those words, it's clear that Daniel has developed quite a reputation.
[time=2068] Now in his 80s, gaining in years, having served five kings by the end of his life as Babylonian Prime Minister, here he is, an old wise sage standing before this sapling of a king like an oak tree, firmly planted, firmly rooted,
[time=2091] this personal integrity, unshakable.
[time=2095] And we see here the second point of our passage this morning, a man to remember.
[time=2100] Here we begin to see again the true character of this man, a man to remember.
[time=2106] Look at verse 13, Beltashazar, having listened to the queen now says that then Daniel was brought in before the king, the king spoke and said to Daniel, "Are you that Daniel?" Listen to the condescending tone.
[time=2123] "Are you that Daniel who is one of the exiles from Judah "who my father, the king, brought from Judah?" Stop there just for a minute.
[time=2132] Are you one of the exiles?
[time=2138] Are you one of these people that my grandfather brought over here from Judah?
[time=2144] I want us to again be reminded this morning of the kind of life that this man, 80 years of age now, to be reminded this morning again of the kind of life this man chose to live.
[time=2157] Think about it, Daniel never seemed to be tainted by the times, never seemed to be impacted, one way or the other, by popular thought, general opinion.
[time=2171] In his book, "Robust in Faith", J. Oswald Sanders says this about Daniel, listen close, the most outstanding element of his character was his moral courage.
[time=2183] You see in Babylon, there was no temple.
[time=2187] Think about it.
[time=2189] He's a Jew who loves his God, and in Babylon, there was no temple, and there was no temple worship, no Sabbath observance, and more than likely no Old Testament scriptures for him to read or stay familiar with.
[time=2206] Now stop right there and think about that in your life.
[time=2209] Think about that translated here.
[time=2212] You know what that would mean?
[time=2213] That would mean for you and I, none of this.
[time=2216] No corporate worship, no chance to come together, no opportunity to walk through those doors with the people of God and sing with the Spirit of God about our God, none of that.
[time=2226] No ABF, no small group, no accountability group, no opportunity for you or I early morning or late night to spend time strolling through the scriptures to have our hearts refocused, and our minds redirected, none of that, gone.
[time=2241] With no aid to devotion for 70 years,
[time=2248] Daniel remained utterly true to God
[time=2255] under unthinkable circumstances.
[time=2257] End quote.
[time=2260] You and I have a tough week if we missed last Sunday.
[time=2263] You and I struggle morally and relationally when we don't meet with God on a regular basis.
[time=2271] And here's Daniel, nothing externally motivating within a thousand miles, nothing but one arrogant, foolish, ungodly king after another, nothing but one drunken banquet after another, and his reputation and his testimony were as impeccable this day as they were 65 years before when as a young boy he got elevated to leadership.
[time=2295] Don't miss that as you see Daniel standing again
[time=2302] before a king.
[time=2304] Verses 14 through 16.
[time=2309] Now I have heard about you, he says, "But a Spirit of the gods is in you, "and that illumination inside an extraordinary wisdom "have been found in you." Just now the wise men and the conjurers were brought in before me that they might read this inscription and make its interpretation known to me, but they could not declare the interpretation of the message.
[time=2329] But I personally have heard about you, that you are able to give interpretations and solve difficult problems.
[time=2334] Now if you are able to read the inscription and make its interpretation known to me, you will be clothed with purple, which was a sign of unending wealth.
[time=2346] You will be clothed with purple, and wear a necklace of gold around your neck, and you will have authority as the third ruler in the kingdom.
[time=2353] Now ponder this, it's similar right now to past situations we've seen this guy and his other three friends end, but don't miss the spot he finds himself in.
[time=2364] You're in the presence of a panicked, stricken, maniacal king who has bothered and has promised you on ending riches, he is bargaining with you for his own personal ease and relief.
[time=2376] Imagine the intimidation that could have been there,
[time=2382] but look at the response in verse 17.
[time=2386] Then Daniel answered and said before the king, how many times have we read that so far in this book, keep your gifts.
[time=2394] Can you see him, can you hear him?
[time=2397] Can you sense his attitude and his heart for God?
[time=2400] Keep your gifts for yourself, or give your rewards to someone else.
[time=2406] However, I will read the inscription to the king and make the interpretation known to him.
[time=2411] Here we see the character and personal integrity of Daniel beginning to show itself in crisis yet again.
[time=2420] And there is for you and for myself,
[time=2426] I think a great opportunity at this point in the dialogue for us to just pause and be reminded of some very important truths.
[time=2433] For instance, and let's just talk family to family here, person to person, life to life.
[time=2439] In every office, shop, place of employment
[time=2445] or relational sphere, wherever there are men and women of God, there will come temptations, people.
[time=2452] I believe you know this to be true.
[time=2455] There will come temptations to prostitute you are calling as a believer.
[time=2460] You will oftentimes face the powerful and or the influential that you rub shoulders with and they will want to make you promises.
[time=2472] If you will do as they please or as they wish or as they request.
[time=2476] And the larger the status, the larger the influence, the larger and greater the pressure that you and I will face to comply, to fit into their schemes and plans.
[time=2489] One of the greatest pressures that Christian men and women live with are the subtle bribes offered by the powerful and influential that have acted upon taint your integrity.
[time=2499] Diminish in a heartbeat, character
[time=2505] and a lifetime of hard work.
[time=2507] And these are the things that Daniel faced.
[time=2512] And some of you this morning know exactly.
[time=2515] You know exactly what I mean.
[time=2518] You know exactly of that which we refer to here this morning.
[time=2522] And you have got to be wise and we have got to be discerning in times like these.
[time=2528] Dads, can we just say a word to you this morning as dads?
[time=2533] We've thanked you, we've encouraged you, we've shown our gratitude, can we remind you as well?
[time=2540] Dads, how's your day gonna be today?
[time=2545] What's it gonna be like?
[time=2547] And I don't mean the lunch of your choice or how much of the golf you're gonna get to watch or the gifts or anything like that.
[time=2555] Really, how's it gonna be for you today?
[time=2559] And what I mean by that is what is today, the quality of your relationship with those kids, with that family?
[time=2571] What are those relationships like and what will you enjoy and see in them today?
[time=2577] Are they trust-filled relationships full of warmth, spiritual intimacy, fun, familiarity that comes from time spent together?
[time=2590] Is that what they're like?
[time=2591] Or have you possibly begun to sense and see the beginnings of relational drift?
[time=2601] Maybe today for you won't be a reminder of those things.
[time=2606] Maybe today for you, in all honesty, is disappointing or discouraging because you know in your heart it's not what it should be, it's not what it could be.
[time=2616] And maybe, what's my point?
[time=2619] My point is this, and maybe it's not, maybe it's not because somewhere in your heart in the last two, three years, somewhere in your life in the last two, three months, maybe you as a dad, maybe you as a man have started to compromise in some of these areas.
[time=2639] Maybe certain things have become more important to you, maybe certain pursuits have you become more passionate about.
[time=2645] And maybe on days like this, you begin to sense in your gut the reality of that.
[time=2652] Dad's be willing this morning to ask yourself this question, please.
[time=2658] Please ask yourself, what will you choose?
[time=2663] What will be chosen as the method through which, or the picture through which we define you as a man?
[time=2671] How will you be defined as a man 10, 20, 30 years from now?
[time=2676] What will we look at?
[time=2677] What will we see?
[time=2679] What is it that gives us that picture of you as a father?
[time=2683] Your IRAs, your 401Ks, your stock returns, your travel, your home size, those things?
[time=2690] No.
[time=2691] You and I know those things show us nothing.
[time=2696] In respect to that which really matters.
[time=2699] No, God will look and we will look at the quality of relationship in your home as a dad.
[time=2706] And are those relationships trust-filled?
[time=2709] And are they warm and spiritually intimate?
[time=2711] And are they honest?
[time=2713] And is there a sense of familiarity that those kids have with you because of the time spent together?
[time=2718] You know what Daniel says?
[time=2723] Daniel says keep your stock options.
[time=2725] Daniel says keep your bonuses, keep your extra stuff.
[time=2731] I have all that I need, really.
[time=2734] Now again, nothing inherently wrong or evil about those things that I just mentioned when kept in perspective.
[time=2743] But Daniel says and can you say?
[time=2745] Dance, can you this morning?
[time=2749] If in fact this morning you have the ability to do this literally and physically.
[time=2754] Can you look to your right?
[time=2758] In your seat right now.
[time=2761] Can you look in your mind's eye across that street or down the hall here to those little faces?
[time=2766] And can you say like he said, you know what, keep it.
[time=2768] I have all that I need right here.
[time=2774] I hope you can.
[time=2775] I really do.
[time=2776] Let's keep going.
[time=2779] He says I won't take your stuff but I will tell you what the inscriptions say.
[time=2783] But before he moves on, he gives the self-indulgent King a lesson from history.
[time=2790] It's great, he takes him back briefly.
[time=2792] Look at verse 18, he says oh King.
[time=2794] "The Most High God granted sovereignty, "grind your glory and majesty to Nebuchadnezzar, "your forefather." And because of the grandeur which he bestowed upon him, all the peoples, nations and men of every language feared and trembled before him.
[time=2811] Whomever he wished he killed, whomever he wished he spared alive, and whomever he wished he elevated, and whomever he wished he humbled.
[time=2819] Belshazzar had attempted condensation to treat Daniel
[time=2827] in a condescending way in verse 13.
[time=2830] And Daniel confronts him, head on, reminding him that all the power Nebuchadnezzar ever had, even the power to take Hebrews into captivity, came from God himself.
[time=2841] That too had been a hard lesson for Nebuchadnezzar to learn but at least he had learned.
[time=2847] Verse 20, he goes on, but when his heart was lifted up and his spirit became so proud that he behaved arrogantly, he was deposed from his royal throne and his glory was taken away from him.
[time=2860] Verse 21, he was also driven away from mankind and his heart was made like that of beasts and his dwelling place was with the wild donkeys.
[time=2869] He was given grass to eat like cattle and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven until he recognized that the most high God is ruler over the realm of mankind and that he sets over it whomever he wishes.
[time=2885] And now having built his case from the past, he turns on Belchasar and empties his barrels.
[time=2891] He lets him have it, verse 22.
[time=2895] Yet you, his son Belchasar, have not humbled your heart even though you knew all of this.
[time=2902] Now you gotta ask yourself another question this morning.
[time=2907] Please don't miss this.
[time=2909] What lessons, what lessons have you learned from others failures in the past?
[time=2916] What lessons have you learned from others mistakes?
[time=2920] And have you been willing and are you willing today and will you be willing tomorrow to do whatever it takes to repent from alter chains, adjust things in your heart and life and in mind to make sure we go down different roads.
[time=2935] Don't ever let verse 22 be said of you.
[time=2939] Don't ever let it be said of you that you did not humble your heart even though you knew all that you knew.
[time=2945] What a tragedy, what a mistake.
[time=2949] Verse 23, the final charges are brought.
[time=2953] But you have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven and they have brought the vessels of his house before you and you and your nobles, your wives, your concubines have been drinking wine from them.
[time=2965] And you have praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood and stone, which do not see, hear or understand, but the God in whom, but the God in whose hand are your life breath in your ways you have not glorified.
[time=2980] Belsh's arse pride led him to worship lifeless objects
[time=2987] instead of the one who holds life in his hand.
[time=2989] And now that hand is about to take from him everything in which he boasted.
[time=2994] His throne, his kingdom, his life.
[time=2997] And like a jury foreman, Daniel reads the inscriptions as if delivering a verdict.
[time=3003] And this is when it gets interesting.
[time=3005] Verse 24, then the hand was sent from him and this inscription was written out.
[time=3011] Verse 25, now this is the inscription, Daniel speaking, that was written out.
[time=3018] Many, many tackle Ufarsen.
[time=3026] This is the interpretation of the message.
[time=3028] Many, God has numbered your kingdom and put an end to it.
[time=3033] Numbered, numbered in an attempt to bring exclamation.
[time=3039] God has numbered your days, Belsh's arse, and the end is near, tackle.
[time=3043] You have been weighed on the scales and found deficient.
[time=3046] Paris, your kingdom has been divided
[time=3052] and given over to the Medes and Persians.
[time=3056] Belsh's arlesons, he hears it yet amazingly seems unmoved by the devastating prediction.
[time=3064] He orders that Daniel be given the purple robe and gold and necklace and elevates him to third ruler of the kingdom.
[time=3070] He doesn't seem to realize that the party is absolutely over.
[time=3075] Historians tell us that while the party was going on, one of Cyrus's commanders, Ubaru, Ubaru was his name.
[time=3084] He and his men had approached the city.
[time=3086] They had diverted the waters of the Euphrates so that the rivers flowing into the city had lowered.
[time=3093] The water level had gone down.
[time=3095] They had then been able to sneak under the gates, which were normally underwater.
[time=3100] Attack with surprise and capture the city.
[time=3104] And it says in verse 30, that same night, Belsh's arse, the Chaldean king, was slain.
[time=3109] So Darius the Mede received the kingdom at about the age of 62, period, done, over.
[time=3118] You say, is that a surprise?
[time=3123] That a surprise thing?
[time=3125] Well, maybe that night it was, but if they had been listening, no, it wouldn't have been.
[time=3130] Go back to Jeremiah in your Bibles.
[time=3133] Go back to Jeremiah 27.
[time=3135] This wasn't a surprise.
[time=3138] This had been talked about hundreds of years before.
[time=3140] Look at Jeremiah 27, verse four.
[time=3143] This one won't come up on the screen, so if you want to look on to with someone next to you, that's great.
[time=3149] Jeremiah 27, verse four.
[time=3153] And command them, it says, to go to their masters, saying, thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, thus you shall say to your masters, I have made the earth the men and the beasts, which are on the face of the earth, by my great power and by my outstretched arm.
[time=3170] And I will give it to the one who is pleasing in my sight.
[time=3173] And now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, my servant, and I have given him also the wild animals of the field to serve him.
[time=3183] And all the nations shall serve him and his son and his grandson until the time of his own land comes.
[time=3192] Then many nations and great kings will make him their servant.
[time=3200] Referring to the grandson.
[time=3202] Go back to the previous prophet, Isaiah.
[time=3205] Go back to Isaiah 13.
[time=3207] Just real briefly here, and then we'll wrap this up.
[time=3211] Isaiah 13, are you there?
[time=3217] Isaiah 13, start there in verse one.
[time=3220] Then we're gonna go to 15.
[time=3221] Verse 15, start there in verse one, the oracle concerning Babylon, which Isaac the son of Amos saw, now to verse 15.
[time=3230] Watch this, anyone who has found, describing the overtaking of this place, anyone who has found will be thrust through, and anyone who has captured will fall by the sword.
[time=3243] Their little ones also will be dashed to pieces before their eyes, their houses will be plundered, and their wives ravished.
[time=3252] Behold, I am going to stir up the Meeds, he even told them who would do it.
[time=3257] I am going to stir up the Meeds against them, who will not value silver or take pleasure in gold, and their bows will mow down the young men, they will not even have compassion on the fruit of the womb, those pregnant, nor will their eye pity children.
[time=3276] And Babylon, the beauty of kingdoms, the glory of the Chaldeans pride, will be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.
[time=3284] It will never be inhabited, or lived in, from generation to generations, nor will the Arab pitches tent there.
[time=3292] Nor will shepherds make their flocks lie down there, but desert creatures will lie down there, and their houses will be full of owls.
[time=3299] Ostrages also will live there, and shaggy goats will frolic there, and hyenas will howl in their fortified towers, and jackals in their luxurious palaces.
[time=3311] Her fateful time also will come soon, and her days will not be prolonged.
[time=3317] 175 years before it happened,
[time=3323] Isaiah the prophet said these words, it never regained its splendor, it still hasn't, and it never will.
[time=3329] Let's think of some things that we can pull from this story,
[time=3335] some lessons to remember, just a couple of things.
[time=3339] Briefly, number one, I bet you've been, maybe you've been thinking this, maybe the thought occurred to you.
[time=3345] If you, like I, have gone through difficult times in your life, times of utter confusion, pain, heart-wrenching experiences, sometimes you wonder where God is.
[time=3357] Remember this from this story.
[time=3359] God's judgment, God's deliverance, if you will, to you and I, it might seem slow, but be reminded this morning that it comes.
[time=3369] It comes, and when it comes, it is thorough.
[time=3374] It is thorough.
[time=3377] By 200 A.D., Babylon was gone.
[time=3380] If you go today to the library down the street, and you go and look at the largest, biggest, most comprehensive atlas you can find, and if you look up Babylon, you will find one thing.
[time=3391] You will find Babylon, and next to it, you will see the word ruins.
[time=3397] It's gone.
[time=3398] It doesn't even exist.
[time=3401] The word of God was fulfilled, and that is true.
[time=3405] The place was annihilated.
[time=3407] Secondly, this morning, never underestimate this.
[time=3411] Think about Daniel, you guys.
[time=3412] Think about the way he lived his life.
[time=3413] Think about 80 years, and there's more to come in chapter six.
[time=3417] And be reminded this morning of this point, never underestimate the power of one, solitary, godly life lived faithfully and true to the word of God.
[time=3430] Do you ever feel alone in your attempts to honor God?
[time=3436] Do you ever feel alone in your family, in your workplace, against the backdrop of a godless celebration, wicked defiance, and ultimate judgment, Daniel stood again, there reassuring and constant in his faith.
[time=3453] And he endured, don't forget, he endured because he courageously spoke God's truth, and he refused to compromise his personal integrity.
[time=3466] That would be our hope.
[time=3468] That would be my hope for you.
[time=3469] That would be my hope for me, that in the days to come, we could live with that kind of courage, to say the truth, and to say it well, and to live with a kind of character and personal integrity, but no matter what it faces, no matter how influential, no matter how powerful the forces might be, it stays true to this book and God's word and his call on your life.
[time=3493] Let's pray, why don't you stand with me.
[time=3496] Father, thank you so very much.
[time=3503] We say that again to you this morning, thank you so very much for the chance to look again into your word and to find their God truths and principles.
[time=3513] That remind us of things that took place thousands of years ago, and what happened then is amazing, and we learned from that, but also God, we find truths that apply to our lives the minute we walk out of this building.
[time=3527] And God, I pray that we as men, we as women, we as young adults, we as kids, God, that we would as best we can hold on to these truths.
[time=3537] God, live them in a way that honors you.
