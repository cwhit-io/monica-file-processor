[time=556] - You know there's something about a hasty confession.
[time=561] Think about it.
[time=564] I'll think about one you've heard from a friend.
[time=569] Think about one you've heard from a spouse.
[time=571] Think about one that you've heard from a son or a daughter, a mom or a dad.
[time=579] There's something about a hasty confession.
[time=581] It's lacking something.
[time=584] It's missing something.
[time=585] A hasty confession.
[time=587] It sounds and feels void of something.
[time=592] What is it?
[time=594] What is a hasty confession lack?
[time=597] Well, you know the answer and I know the answer.
[time=600] You've made them and so have I.
[time=603] They lack heart, they lack sincerity.
[time=607] You see when the heart is in the confession and we'll see this later in our look at this great passage we come to this morning in Daniel 9 when the heart is in the confession, it breeds sincerity.
[time=619] And with sincerity comes empathy.
[time=621] And with empathy comes a real sense of the offense.
[time=625] And from there we move towards repentance.
[time=627] You see a hasty confession lacks sincerity.
[time=632] And it lacks the kind of empathy and awareness that moves people, you and I, to repentance, to change.
[time=641] Watch closely.
[time=644] This will probably hit close to home.
[time=646] It does for many of us I think, but it illustrates for us that very sense.
[time=651] And to whatever degree you and I need to be encouraged this morning with regard to the kind of confessions we make, we hope this will help.
[time=658] Oh, well that about takes care of it.
[time=664] Nellie's dropped off over a patents.
[time=667] The car is all packed, all we have to do tomorrow morning is load up the small bags and turn down the water heater and we're out of here.
[time=674] Great.
[time=675] Did the patent seem okay with Nellie?
[time=677] I just get the feeling they don't like dogs.
[time=679] No, they love dogs.
[time=680] Trust me, they were very excited to have Nellie for the week.
[time=684] Well, I know the kids are, but I wonder about Kathy.
[time=686] You know they don't have a dog of their own.
[time=688] Which is exactly why they're excited to have Nellie for the week.
[time=691] Now we calm down and let's go to bed.
[time=693] You gotta get up to six o'clock.
[time=694] All right.
[time=696] You canceled the paper?
[time=697] The paper.
[time=700] You said you were gonna cancel the paper.
[time=702] I know.
[time=704] And I still can't.
[time=705] Bob, it's 10.30.
[time=707] I don't think the paper's still open.
[time=709] Yeah, it's all right, it's all right.
[time=710] They got this brand new system now where you can call up and cancel things 24 hours a day.
[time=714] Would you give me that phone there?
[time=715] You never did this before.
[time=717] It's brand new, it just started here.
[time=719] But I'm sure you can do it this way.
[time=722] I think.
[time=723] Aha, we're in.
[time=726] Okay, enter phone number.
[time=728] That's four or five, okay.
[time=732] Press one, two, yada, yada, yada.
[time=734] Press two to hold the paper.
[time=737] Two, enter stop date.
[time=739] Let's see, that would be 07, that was tomorrow's date.
[time=743] Two, six, press three to enter the startup date again.
[time=748] Okay, that would be 0801.
[time=753] Uh-huh, press pound to confirm.
[time=756] (laughing) Just like that, all taken care of.
[time=760] Good, you stopped the mail too?
[time=763] The mail, yeah, well you see by the time I had finished taking the car to get the oil changed, the post office was already closed.
[time=772] Why didn't you go before?
[time=774] Well, because, I forgot.
[time=777] Bob!
[time=778] Well, I had a lot to do this morning.
[time=780] Let's not make a federal case out of it.
[time=782] I'll just go next door and ask the paper.
[time=784] You said yesterday you would cancel the mail in the paper.
[time=787] Well, I did.
[time=788] The papers canceled and for all practical purposes, the mail is too.
[time=791] Look, I'm putting on my coat, I'm going next door, I'm going to go ask-- That's not the point.
[time=796] Well, of course it's the point, Lisa.
[time=797] I mean, when you-- We didn't tape your word, you blew me off again.
[time=801] I specifically asked you to do those two things and you promised you would.
[time=805] I did.
[time=806] Bob, you didn't remember either one until I just brought it up?
[time=809] You call that taking care of it?
[time=812] Well, is the mail really that all fired important?
[time=814] Yes, it's important because I was counting on you to take care of it.
[time=817] And if it's important to me, it should be important to you.
[time=822] All right.
[time=823] All right, it's important.
[time=824] I'll just run over next door and in five minutes, I'll be back and the whole thing will be taken care of.
[time=828] No, that's not it.
[time=829] There's a reason why I don't want the Jorgensen's to get the mail for us.
[time=833] Why?
[time=835] Doesn't matter.
[time=836] The point is, I had a reason.
[time=838] And you never thought about my reason.
[time=841] It may be a good reason or a bad reason, but I had a reason.
[time=844] And when you blow things off like that, you tell me my reasons don't matter.
[time=848] All right, I'm sorry.
[time=853] I'm sorry you had a reason, OK?
[time=856] Now, would you tell me what the reason was?
[time=858] Look, all right, I see your point.
[time=863] I should have just done it and I didn't.
[time=864] I'm sorry, Elise.
[time=868] All right, look, if you don't want me to go ask the Jorgensen's, I can just-- You still don't get it.
[time=871] You're right.
[time=872] I don't get it, Elise, but I am trying.
[time=874] I am trying to understand here.
[time=876] I mean, what else can I say?
[time=878] I forgot to cancel the mail.
[time=879] I'm sorry.
[time=880] Fine.
[time=881] You're sorry.
[time=882] I still feel bad.
[time=885] What else can I say, Elise?
[time=886] What do you want me to say?
[time=888] Don't say you're sorry.
[time=889] Just be sorry.
[time=891] Oh, and how do I do that?
[time=893] I don't know.
[time=894] It's something that truly sorry people seem to know.
[time=896] So now I'm not truly sorry?
[time=898] Well, what do you become a mind reader or something?
[time=900] You know who's truly sorry and who's not.
[time=903] It just happens so often, Bob.
[time=905] You say you're sorry so easily.
[time=907] I'm sorry, Elise.
[time=910] And then you go and do the same thing again.
[time=912] How do I know that you're sorry?
[time=914] You've got to believe me.
[time=915] I mean, when I tell you that I feel bad, you have got to believe that I feel bad, or else you're just calling me a liar.
[time=920] Oh, I don't doubt you feel bad.
[time=922] I just doubt why you feel bad.
[time=924] Look, I am guilty, OK?
[time=926] I forgot the mail.
[time=927] Now I'm going to have to live with that for the rest of my life.
[time=930] But I mean, come on, let's put this thing in a perspective here.
[time=932] Aren't we blowing a little thing out of proportion?
[time=935] You're not sorry.
[time=936] I am sorry.
[time=937] But he wouldn't be mocking me.
[time=938] I told you I was sorry.
[time=940] I said I made a mistake.
[time=941] Oh, one little mistake.
[time=942] But you're still basically a good guy who's watching over such a ridiculous little thing.
[time=946] I'm sorry, and I can't-- No, you're trying to prove you're OK, and that's not sorry.
[time=949] What are you saying you want that I'm a terrible person and I'm just kidding.
[time=952] Just forget it.
[time=953] [MUSIC]
[time=957] I've been callous to you, and you've been cold to me.
[time=980] It's been bringing us harm instead of harmony.
[time=984] We're up and down from day to day.
[time=992] And that won't change until we pray.
[time=1002] And the prayer we pray will be heard above.
[time=1011] And the prayer we pray will make our love.
[time=1021] All that keeps us apart are things we said in haste.
[time=1030] If we both can forgive the silence soonly grace,
[time=1038] we must be wise and compromise with all the free.
[time=1046] I'll pray for you and you for me.
[time=1052] And the prayer we pray will be heard above.
[time=1060] And the prayer we pray will make our love.
[time=1082] The prayer we pray will be heard above.
[time=1096] The prayer we pray will make our love.
[time=1104] The prayer we pray will be heard above.
[time=1134] Well, let me invite you, if you would,
[time=1141] to open up your Bibles to Daniel chapter 9.
[time=1145] We have been studying this great book of Daniel.
[time=1148] And after several weeks of study and interaction in the arena of prophecy and future events, we switch gears a bit this morning and find ourselves, once again, taking a more personal look at Daniel, the man, the prophet himself.
[time=1164] Russell will be back next Sunday.
[time=1166] And we'll be diving back into some more prophecy and some more discussion regarding the future.
[time=1172] And that'll come in the last half of chapter 9.
[time=1175] But this morning, we come to the first part, the first half of chapter 9, verses 1 through 21.
[time=1182] And we get in this first part of chapter 9 reconnected, reconnected with the heart and the passion and the character of Daniel.
[time=1191] We get to see once again the essence of Daniel, his love, and his deep devotion to God.
[time=1198] And we see it, his love and his devotion.
[time=1200] We see it in a wonderful way.
[time=1203] Here in chapter 9, as we study one of the great and classic prayers of all time.
[time=1209] And I use the word, and others have used the words great and classic because it is great.
[time=1214] And it is classic, not so much with reference to its method or its sequence, but it is great and it is classic.
[time=1224] And it is worth us taking a really close look at this morning because of the heart from which it comes.
[time=1231] The heart from which it emanates is the kind of heart that I believe God wants you to have.
[time=1237] And that God wants me to have, that God would want all of us to have as we approach this thing, this discipline called prayer.
[time=1245] It is a great prayer.
[time=1247] And this morning I want to invite you to look with me at it and to open your own heart and to open your own mind.
[time=1253] And maybe there might be some things for us this morning that we can learn, that we could be reminded of, that we could be challenged by with respect to our own approach to this thing called prayer.
[time=1267] The setting, the setting of the prayer is found right there in the first couple of verses of chapter 9, verses 1 and 2.
[time=1274] Look at what was going on there.
[time=1276] In the first year of Darius, it says there in verse 1.
[time=1279] In the first year of Darius, the son of Azarius of median descent, who was made king over the kingdom of the Chaldeans.
[time=1287] In the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, observed in the books the number of the years which was revealed as the word of the Lord to Jeremiah the prophet for the completion of the desolations of Jerusalem, namely 70 years.
[time=1304] Stop there.
[time=1306] Now, it's more than likely that the passage Daniel was reading and becoming familiar with again was found in Jeremiah chapter 25.
[time=1315] And it is there in chapter 25 of Jeremiah that we see the word of the Lord talking to this issue of his disappointment with his judgment of and his consequent banishing of the nation of Israel out of their homeland and into the Babylonian captivity.
[time=1334] And it says there in Jeremiah 25, turn there if you'd like, Jeremiah 25, 8 to 11.
[time=1338] These are probably the very words that Daniel himself was reading.
[time=1342] Look at what it says.
[time=1344] Jeremiah 25, verses 8 to 11, it says there in verse 8.
[time=1352] Therefore, thus says the Lord of hosts, because you have not obeyed my words.
[time=1356] Behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, declares the Lord.
[time=1361] And I will send to Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land and against its inhabitants and against all these nations round about.
[time=1371] And I will utterly destroy them and make them a horror and a hissing and an everlasting desolation.
[time=1378] Verse 10, moreover, I will take from them the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones and the light of the lamp.
[time=1390] And this whole land shall be a desolation and a horror.
[time=1395] And these nations shall serve the King of Babylon 70 years.
[time=1401] And that is exactly what had transpired.
[time=1404] So that is exactly what had happened.
[time=1406] And so here's David.
[time=1407] And it's been years, Daniel, excuse me.
[time=1411] Here's Daniel.
[time=1411] And it's been years since he's been back in his homeland.
[time=1415] He had been brought into captivity.
[time=1417] You'll recall as a youth, just a boy.
[time=1420] And now was moving towards the age of 80.
[time=1424] Sixty-seven years had transpired.
[time=1427] Sixty-seven years had gone by.
[time=1429] And the 70 years that God had predicted was almost up.
[time=1434] And Daniel knew what was needed.
[time=1436] Daniel knew what was required to see the 70 years come to an end.
[time=1441] And so he prayed.
[time=1443] He knew what God required from his people to close the 70-year period of desolation.
[time=1450] And that which was required was the repentance, the turning of the hearts back towards God on the part of the Israelites.
[time=1458] And so he prays.
[time=1459] And in his prayer, he gives us this rich, insightful look into what true, meaningful, God-honoring prayer really looks like, where it comes from.
[time=1473] And that's what we're going to see this morning.
[time=1474] Six in total.
[time=1476] Six ingredients to God-honoring prayer.
[time=1480] And I want to work our way through these.
[time=1482] Maybe a little quicker than normal.
[time=1484] And the reason is this.
[time=1486] I'm looking forward to, at the end of this, for us to have a time of prayer together.
[time=1491] And I hope that's something that you'd look forward to, something we could enjoy together.
[time=1494] And I want to try my best to work through the prayer and identify for us some really important components of God-honoring prayer and then give us a chance at the end to interact with those and spend some time as a body in prayer.
[time=1507] Number one, first thing we see in this passage, back to Daniel 9.
[time=1512] First thing you see is that God-honoring prayer is a response to the Word of God.
[time=1519] True God-honoring prayer is a response to the Word of God.
[time=1524] Look at verse two.
[time=1525] See it there again?
[time=1526] It says there in verse two, in the first year of his reign, my Daniel observed in the books.
[time=1532] Please note that what few scrolls of the Scriptures had been maintained during the captivity, Daniel is reading and staying familiar with.
[time=1542] He's spending time in them.
[time=1544] And by this time, some 67 years into it, you can imagine how many times he's read them.
[time=1550] But yet he reads them again and again.
[time=1555] He stays familiar with the truth and it is the truth.
[time=1558] Here's the point.
[time=1560] It is the truth of Scripture that helps bring shape and form to his prayer.
[time=1567] God-honoring prayer is a response to the Word of God.
[time=1572] Our communication to God, your communication to God, should be a response to his communication to us.
[time=1580] Some of your greatest, most meaningful times of prayer and mine as well have come when we have first of all faithfully and diligently and honestly interacted with the Scriptures.
[time=1593] God-honoring prayer takes place when we ask the question, what does God's Word say about this?
[time=1601] This that I'm facing, this that I'm experiencing, this that I'm having to work my way, what does God's Word say about this?
[time=1608] What does the Scriptures say about this circumstance I find myself in?
[time=1612] What does God's Word say about my family crisis or a friend's discouraging situation?
[time=1619] What does God's Word say about these questions that I'm having to ask and find answers to?
[time=1625] What does God's Word say?
[time=1627] And this morning, we just need to take a quick pause
[time=1633] and ask that question of, I need to ask it of you and you need to ask it of me and we need to make sure that as a family, we're able to answer that.
[time=1642] The question, what does God's Word say?
[time=1644] Do you know, do you know?
[time=1648] Do you know what God's Word says?
[time=1650] Do you know what it says?
[time=1651] Do you know how it directs you?
[time=1653] Do you know the things it calls you to?
[time=1655] Do you understand?
[time=1656] Do you know?
[time=1657] Do you?
[time=1660] You see, we have to, not just to know it, but in this case with regards to your prayers and minds so that our prayers can be in accordance with what is true and right, you and I must know God's Word.
[time=1675] Jesus himself taught us that we are to pray according
[time=1681] to whose will, answer.
[time=1683] God the Father.
[time=1686] Jesus said that we are to pray according to God's will and where do you and I find God's will expressed and reveal in the Scriptures?
[time=1696] In the Word of God, our prayers need to be expressed in harmony with God's truth.
[time=1701] If God's Word establishes parameters for you to stay in the relationship, stay in the relationship and pray, don't pray to get out, pray for strength and faith and courage.
[time=1716] If God's Word establishes parameters for you or I to pay the bill, as unfair or seemingly impossible as it seems, pay the bill and pray for God's provision and pray for God's assistance.
[time=1730] If the Word of God establishes parameters for you or I to go and lovingly confront a friend over a sinful act or attitude, don't pray for them to forget your lunch date, no, pray for courage, pray for strength, get there early and speak the truth and love.
[time=1750] If the Word of God provides parameters, which you and I know it does, follow them and pray according to them, God honoring prayer is in response to the Word of God.
[time=1764] Number two, number two in our passage this morning, we see that it is focused and fervent.
[time=1769] It is focused and fervent, look at verse three.
[time=1771] So I gave my attention, Daniel said to the Lord God to seek him by prayer and supplication with fasting, sackcloth and ashes.
[time=1782] Daniel's times of prayer were approached with thought, they were approached with heart, they were approached with passion, what are your times with God approached with?
[time=1794] What are your times of prayer with God approached with?
[time=1800] And it's not to say that the quick prayer offered up on the weight of the appointment or the silent prayer given while standing aside prior to moving into a very important conversation aren't valid, they are.
[time=1814] I think the point is though if that's all that consists of your prayer life or mine, we have some things to learn.
[time=1821] There is something to say for a focused and fervent effort.
[time=1825] There is something to say for the setting aside of time.
[time=1828] Concentrated time, time where we give attention in our mind and heart to God.
[time=1835] Back in chapter six, verse 10 of this great book that we've been studying, it said that when Daniel knew the document had been signed, he entered his house and he continued kneeling on his knees three times a day praying and giving thanks before his God as he had been doing previously.
[time=1852] And now why do I read that to you?
[time=1854] Well, it's not so much about how he did it.
[time=1857] It's not the point, it's that he did it.
[time=1860] It's that he did it and he did it often.
[time=1862] His time with God meant that much to him.
[time=1864] He was focused, he was fervent.
[time=1868] We see in Esther, chapter four, verse 16.
[time=1871] I think it'll come on the screen here in just a moment.
[time=1873] Esther chapter four, 16, Esther says, "Go gather together, all the Jews who are in sousa and fast for me.
[time=1880] Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day, and I and my maids will fast as you do.
[time=1886] And when this is done, I will go to the king, even though it is against the law.
[time=1890] And if I perish, I perish." And turn to the New Testament, to Luke chapter 11.
[time=1897] Luke chapter 11 gives us a great picture of this idea of fervency and passion as we pursue God with the desires of our heart.
[time=1906] Luke chapter 11, verse five, it says there, and he said to them, "Suppose one of you shall have a friend, and shall go to him at midnight, and say to him, 'Friend, lend me three loaves, for a friend of mine has come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him, and from inside he shall answer and say, 'Do not bother me, the door has already been shut, and my children and I are in bed.
[time=1931] I cannot get up and give you anything.
[time=1933] I tell you, even though he will not get up and give him anything, because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence, he will get up and give him as much as he needs.
[time=1945] And I say to you, ask, look at verse nine, and I say to you, ask, and it shall be given to you.
[time=1953] Seek, and you shall find, knock, and it shall be opened to you." Do you see it there?
[time=1960] Do you see the fervency?
[time=1961] Ask, seek, knock.
[time=1963] You stay at it.
[time=1964] I stay at it from hearts that are fully committed to God, and willing to follow whatever he might reveal, or however he might answer, still yet in our approach, there is a fervency, there is a passion, there is a focus.
[time=1977] And we pursue him with that kind of focus.
[time=1981] God responds to fervency.
[time=1984] God looks favorably on the focused, passionate prayer of your heart.
[time=1988] An old theologian named Brooks years and years and years ago said this, "As a painted fire is no fire,
[time=1999] "and as a dead man is no man at all, "so cold prayer is no prayer.
[time=2004] "In a painted fire there is no heat, "in a dead man there is no life, "and in a cold prayer there is no power, "no devotion and no blessing.
[time=2014] "Cold prayers are as arrows without heads, "swords without edges, birds without wings, "they pierce not, they cut not, "they fly not up to heaven.
[time=2024] "Cold prayers do always freeze before they get there.
[time=2028] "Oh that Christians would move themselves "out of their cold prayers and into a better "and warmer frame of spirit "when they make their supplications to the Lord." What's your heart like?
[time=2042] What's your mind like?
[time=2043] What's your soul like when you pray?
[time=2047] Is there that sense of devotion, passion, fervency, focus on Him that allows you and I to bring to Him everything that's on our heart?
[time=2058] What's your heart like when you pray?
[time=2062] God-honoring prayer is focused and fervent.
[time=2065] And Daniel was a great example of that.
[time=2067] Thirdly, thirdly this morning we see this, it acknowledges God-honoring prayer does.
[time=2072] It acknowledges the attributes of God.
[time=2078] We believe God cares.
[time=2079] We believe God hears and responds to our prayers.
[time=2082] Why?
[time=2084] Well partly because of who He is, because of who He is and what He's like.
[time=2090] And look at what He gives us here, back to Daniel 9.
[time=2093] In verse four, He begins to describe this God that He prays to.
[time=2099] And when you stop and think about it, it's really pretty amazing.
[time=2102] He says in verse four, "Alaso Lord, the great and awesome God." You see it there?
[time=2109] Who keeps His covenant and loving kindness for those who love Him and keep His commandments.
[time=2114] Just in that verse, look at what He says.
[time=2116] He calls God great.
[time=2117] The Word in the Hebrew went powerful, powerful.
[time=2121] He is the God who parted the sea.
[time=2122] He's the God who dropped food from the sky.
[time=2125] He is the same God who brought brutal and astounding victories to the underman and under-trained armies of Israel.
[time=2132] He is the same God who it says later in this chapter in verse 15 brought the Israelites out of Egypt with His mighty hand.
[time=2141] He is great, He is powerful, Daniel says.
[time=2145] It says there later in the verse that He's awesome.
[time=2148] It's the word Daniel chose there.
[time=2149] And that word in the Hebrew means full of majesty, full of splendor.
[time=2155] This God that I pray to, Daniel says, is magnificent and spectacular.
[time=2160] And He keeps His covenants or His promises.
[time=2164] In the Hebrew that phrase meant that He is dependable and faithful.
[time=2167] He is true and completely reliable.
[time=2170] He is full of loving kindness, the verse goes on.
[time=2175] Loving kindness, again, we've looked at that word many times in the past and you know and I know that it means mercy.
[time=2181] He is a God of mercy.
[time=2182] He is a God who continues day in and day out week after week, month after month to not deal with you and I the way He should.
[time=2190] In verse seven of chapter nine, Daniel calls him righteous.
[time=2198] Daniel calls him righteous.
[time=2200] You know what that word means?
[time=2201] It means holy.
[time=2203] And what does the word holy mean?
[time=2205] Well, you know what?
[time=2206] The use of that word solidifies for us, one thing.
[time=2209] Many things, but one thing with regard to prayer, He is righteous, He is holy.
[time=2213] So guess what?
[time=2214] He will do what is right.
[time=2216] He will always do in your life and mind.
[time=2221] He will always do what is right.
[time=2224] This powerful, majestic, spectacular, dependable, faithful, reliable, merciful Holy God will do with us in His eyes, in His time, in His place.
[time=2236] He will do with you and He will do with me what is right.
[time=2242] I was thinking about that this week, and I thought, you know what?
[time=2246] That's incredibly comforting for me.
[time=2251] I hope it is for you.
[time=2253] I hope that picture of God that Daniel just painted.
[time=2256] I hope that that's comforting for you.
[time=2259] I hope it brings even greater trust in faith in your heart because don't forget this.
[time=2266] I thought about this.
[time=2267] There are millions of people in this world today that are placing their lives, placing their families' lives, placing their trust.
[time=2275] They are placing their entire well-being.
[time=2278] Millions of people, placing all of that in prayers offered up to nothing more than decorated rocks, grazing cows, three-inch-high statues.
[time=2291] And we get this, we get a God who is all of that.
[time=2301] We get to bring the desires of our heart.
[time=2303] We get to bring the calamities of our life.
[time=2305] We get to bring our future and our needs and the things, the petitions that we have for others.
[time=2311] We get to bring all of that to a God who is absolutely and perfectly holy, just, compassionate, reliable, true, loving, majestic, spectacular, while others entrust their lives to rocks.
[time=2331] And I was thinking about this too, and then we'll move on.
[time=2335] Follow me here, moms, dads, just a question for you.
[time=2341] Do the same things that draw you into dialogue with your heavenly Father, those things that we just mentioned.
[time=2351] Do the same things that draw you and I into dialogue with our heavenly Father, draw your kids into dialogue with you.
[time=2359] Now think about that, not that you would be God, but understand the dynamic there, isn't it?
[time=2366] Isn't it so similar?
[time=2367] Our kids, they come to us and they'll talk with us and they'll dialogue with us and they'll make requests of us.
[time=2375] I think, I believe, from my experience so far, to a large degree, dependent upon their view of us, and how do they view me?
[time=2385] Do they view me as being full of compassion?
[time=2389] Have I shown myself to be full of the kinds of things that they can place their trust in and make request of and trust the answers?
[time=2398] I hope so, it just got me thinking about it and I wanted to share that with you.
[time=2402] I hope the kinds of things that draw us to him are the kinds of things we work on in an attempt to deepen the relationship we have with those that come to us and make requests.
[time=2412] God honoring prayer, it is a response to the word of God, it is focused and fervent, it acknowledges the attributes of God at number four.
[time=2421] It humbly, it humbly identifies with others.
[time=2426] Look at the first part of verse four and I prayed to the Lord, my God, and confessed.
[time=2432] First thing he did, once he got into it, first thing, first, first order of business that got taken care of was that he confessed, he dealt with himself.
[time=2444] It humbly identifies, humbly, meaning in other words, it deals quickly with me and moves instead to we.
[time=2452] He quickly deals with the things thoroughly, yet initially deals with those things having to do with him so that he can get him out of the way and move to this prayer for the we.
[time=2464] In verse four, he confesses his own sin, his own unworthiness, and right out of the gate, you and I sense the humility of his heart.
[time=2472] And this humility, watch where it leads him.
[time=2474] It leads him to this complete and total identification with his fellow countrymen and their sin and their weakness and their failure and their shame.
[time=2488] Look at the passage, chapter nine, verse five.
[time=2491] We have sinned.
[time=2493] Verse six, moreover, we have not listened.
[time=2497] Verse eight, open shame belongs to us.
[time=2500] We have sinned, verse nine, we have rebelled.
[time=2504] Verse 11, thy voice, excuse me, so the curse has been poured out on us.
[time=2511] In verse 11, we have sinned against him.
[time=2514] Verse 13, we have not sought favor.
[time=2517] Verse 14, but we have not obeyed.
[time=2520] You know, I read through this whole passage.
[time=2523] It's absolutely full of this kind of language.
[time=2528] And I think to myself as maybe you do for a moment, you know, if there was anybody, anybody on the face of the earth at that point, in this situation, who might have had the right to stand apart from these godless, faithless, inconsistent people that would have been Daniel, who we've seen through the years stand firmly and faithfully.
[time=2546] But he doesn't rest on his laurels.
[time=2550] He doesn't stand apart and consider himself more than he ought.
[time=2552] No, he joins himself with these people.
[time=2555] And again, and again, and again, we see it.
[time=2557] We, we, we, we, us.
[time=2565] You know what the lesson for us here is?
[time=2567] In life and in God-honoring prayer, the lesson is simple.
[time=2573] Don't ever think.
[time=2574] Don't ever think and don't ever speak and don't ever pray with a view of you that is more highly than it ought to be.
[time=2582] Don't spend more time on yourself than you should and concern yourself more with your petitions for others rather than your own.
[time=2593] I'm reminded of Paul, the great apostle in Romans, chapter nine.
[time=2598] He prayed a prayer in Romans nine.
[time=2599] Do you remember it?
[time=2600] He was praying for his fellow countrymen.
[time=2602] And Paul wanted so desperately.
[time=2604] Paul wanted so passionately.
[time=2606] Paul wanted so deeply for those that he knew, those fellow Israelites.
[time=2612] He wanted so badly for them to come to a saving knowledge of Christ.
[time=2616] But in his prayer, he said what?
[time=2618] I would rather lose my salvation.
[time=2622] I would rather lose my security and my salvations that they might come to know Christ.
[time=2629] And in that, we find, I think, the point here.
[time=2634] And we're reminded, be careful.
[time=2638] What is your mindset when you pray?
[time=2640] And yes, there may be some things that you and I might need to do business with God concerning us.
[time=2645] But is there an equal or even greater commitment on your part in mind to pray for and lift up and encourage?
[time=2652] And so listen, God's help and involvement in the lives of others.
[time=2656] It's not about us, it's not about us individually.
[time=2663] It's about us corporately.
[time=2664] God honoring prayer is a response to the word of God.
[time=2668] It is focused and fervent.
[time=2670] It acknowledges the attributes of God.
[time=2673] It is done in a humble, identifying fashion.
[time=2676] And fifthly, it is strengthened by confession.
[time=2681] God honoring prayer, people is strengthened by confession, true and genuine confession.
[time=2688] We have sinned, verse five.
[time=2690] We have sinned, we have committed iniquity, acted wickedly and rebelled, even turning aside from thy commandments and ordinances.
[time=2698] Let me say this, and you can read from five all the way down to about 15.
[time=2703] And you see in that the heart of one who is truly confessing.
[time=2708] Let me say this if I can.
[time=2712] When God is at work in a life, when God has really had work in a life, confession and repentance become the norm.
[time=2722] You've seen it and I've seen it and it's really true.
[time=2727] When God is at work in a life, confession and repentance become the norm.
[time=2731] Spiritual maturity shows itself in a torrents of personal sin.
[time=2738] You can't stand it, you can't live with it.
[time=2741] The burden is too much, you can't bear it.
[time=2744] And when you know that you have erred, when you know you have chosen against God, you do whatever it takes, the spiritually mature, the one whose heart God is at work in.
[time=2756] You do whatever it takes.
[time=2759] You go wherever you have to go.
[time=2760] You talk whoever you have to talk with.
[time=2763] And you get it right.
[time=2766] And you say the truth about you to God.
[time=2770] And you say the truth about you to those you need to say it to.
[time=2775] You confess it and you get it on the table
[time=2781] before a God who knows and longs and longs for you to come and say that to him.
[time=2790] You get it on the table with him and then scripture also calls it to get it on the table to confess our sins one to another.
[time=2797] And I don't think that means to shout it from the rooftop for anybody to hear, but I believe it calls you and I to relationship with those that love you, those that want to support you, those that want to pray for you, those that want to come alongside and walk through life with you.
[time=2812] I got a letter from a guy a couple weeks ago.
[time=2816] We had talked about a situation.
[time=2818] I had encouraged him to go and with wisdom and discretion share it with those that he was walking through life with.
[time=2825] And he says, Kelly, thanks so much for gently pushing me to share my failure with the guys in my group.
[time=2832] You were right.
[time=2833] They not only understood, but their understanding seemed to stem from their own failure and struggle in that very arena.
[time=2840] Two others had even recently gone down the road.
[time=2842] I had gone down and the six of us prayed that night for almost an hour.
[time=2847] We shared some doing battle with the enemy tips and what you said about community is really true.
[time=2854] To know and be known, to love and be loved is the greatest thing ever.
[time=2859] Thanks again.
[time=2860] One more thing about confession, then we'll move on.
[time=2865] Just briefly.
[time=2866] One of the surest signs, remember this.
[time=2870] And I don't say remember it as really as you deal with others.
[time=2873] I'm saying remember it as you deal with yourself.
[time=2876] One of the surest signs in my experience.
[time=2880] And as I look at God's word of true confession is this.
[time=2885] True confession shows itself by willingly accepting the discipline that comes with the choices made.
[time=2893] That is a heart, that is a life, that is a man, that is a woman, that is a boy, that is a girl, that is a friend who has truly confessed.
[time=2906] When there is a willingness and no arms are getting twisted and nothing's going on behind me, there is just an open willingness.
[time=2916] Not like Adam in the garden who when God came and said, "Hey, what's going on?
[time=2921] "How did you know you were naked?
[time=2922] "What, Adam, did you eat the fruit?" And he said, "What?
[time=2926] "God, it's about this woman you gave me.
[time=2930] "We got to rethink the wiring on her.
[time=2931] "I think you kind of, not a good thing.
[time=2933] "No, it doesn't look at him, it doesn't know.
[time=2938] "True confession is you and I dealing with you and I, "and leave your wife and leave your husband "and leave your boss and leave your friend out of it.
[time=2947] "True confession looks at God, looks at God's word "and says, "How have I send?
[time=2953] "And what must I do to make it right?
[time=2956] "And I'll do whatever it is God you call me to do.
[time=2958] "And the consequences that I experience because of it, "they're just, it's fair, I deserve it." When you see that, when you sense that, you know you're with one who has truly confessed.
[time=2971] Lastly, number six, God honoring prayer
[time=2979] has God's glory, it has God's agenda, it has what God wants as its goal.
[time=2990] Look at verse 16.
[time=2992] Oh Lord, in accordance with all of thy righteous acts, let now thine anger and thy wrath turn away from thy city, Jerusalem, thy holy mountain for, because of our sins and the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people have become a reproach to all those around us.
[time=3010] So now, verse 17, our God, listen to the prayer of thy servant and to his supplications and for whose sake, and for thy sake, oh Lord, let thy face shine on thy desolate sanctuary.
[time=3024] Oh my God, incline thine ear to hear, open thine eyes and see our desolations in the city, which is called by thy name.
[time=3033] For we are not presenting our supplications before thee on account of any merits of our own, but on account of thy great compassion, oh Lord hear, oh Lord forgive, oh Lord listen and take action for thine own sake, oh my God, do not delay, because thy city and thy people are called by thy name.
[time=3055] Do you see that?
[time=3057] He says the 70 years has been all you said it would be, our suffering has been great, but God, that's not the issue.
[time=3064] The issue is that your city and your people have gotten a bad name and it shouldn't be that way.
[time=3070] And for your sake and the lifting back up of your name and your kingdom, please God, hear our prayers so that your will can be done.
[time=3080] So that good things can take place with regards to your kingdom.
[time=3084] My pain, Daniel says, our pain is not the issue.
[time=3090] We deserve that.
[time=3093] And if we start talking about what we deserve anyway, how quickly, and Daniel knew this, that's why he didn't go there.
[time=3100] Because if we got what we deserved, our last breath would have been our last, right?
[time=3106] So he doesn't concern himself with that.
[time=3107] He says, God do what's right for you and let us be a part of it.
[time=3113] The great D.L. Moody, the story's been told,
[time=3119] I've heard it hundreds of times.
[time=3120] D.L. Moody is there in his study and there's papers all over his desk and he's working on a message and doing the business of the college and the church and his six year old son sits next to him at his desk with his own little pile of papers.
[time=3136] And after 15, 20 minutes or so, the boy gets up with his pile of papers and he's shuffling the papers next to D.L. Moody as he sits there working at his desk and Moody can no longer take the distraction.
[time=3149] He says, son, what do you want?
[time=3152] And the little boy looks at his dad, the story goes and says to his dad, daddy, I don't want anything, I just want to be with you doing what you're doing as he kept shuffling his papers.
[time=3168] And you see that's prayer, that is prayer, that is the essence of prayer.
[time=3175] God, it's not really so much about what I want.
[time=3178] Yeah, there might be some requests and I'll make them to you gladly trusting in you but this is much more about God what you're doing and where you're going and I want to do it with you and I want to do it with a heart that's right.
[time=3191] So here my adoration and here and since my confession and God let us be a part of what you're doing.
[time=3199] Well, let me give us a chance, can we do this?
[time=3205] Let me give us a chance as the folks come to the stage.
[time=3208] Let me if I can just invite you to, why don't you just get comfortable, close your eyes, bow your heads, put your books away and we're going to spend some time in prayer.
[time=3220] We're going to sing a couple of songs and maybe with your eyes closed and your head's bowed or maybe on your knees there at your pew, maybe on your knees and your heart.
[time=3234] We're first of all going to sing a song about confession and I don't know what's been going on in your heart this week, this month and there may be some things even this morning that as we talk about true confession and the willingness to just say the truth about you, to God and we'll just keep it there for this morning.
[time=3254] You can get to telling others later.
[time=3256] But this morning there might be some things that you need to say to him about you.
[time=3261] Some things may have gone on in your heart recently and you may need to ask for forgiveness, you may need to ask for a new strength.
[time=3269] Do that this morning, spend some time right now.
[time=3272] We'll stay seated for this song and as we sing and as you sing and as you pray, it is my prayer that our confession, whatever confession might need to take place would take place in your heart this morning.
[time=3286] (gentle music)
[time=3298] [MUSIC - 65 seconds]
[time=3367] - I think the next song is great as thy faithfulness.
[time=3381] And let me invite you to stand.
[time=3384] The songs we're standing for.
[time=3386] Because we serve a faithful God and whatever confession you've just made, he's faithful to forgive and to make right.
[time=3395] And so many of us in the room this morning, we know, we have sensed, we have lived the faithful forgiveness of God.
[time=3403] And so as we sing this song and as you're reminded of its great truth, sing it from your heart.
[time=3409] Sing it with a heart full of thanksgiving.
[time=3411] The privilege of prayer is an amazing thing and it reminds us not only of his forgiveness, but of his faithfulness and its ongoing presence in our lives.
[time=3421] Sing from your hearts about our faithful God.
[time=3424] [MUSIC - 66 seconds]
[time=3499] - Well it's been a good morning, thanks for being here.
[time=3503] And I hope that your hearts have been encouraged with regard to your approach, our approach to God.
[time=3510] Father, thanks so very much for this time and thank you that we get to pray.
[time=3516] And God, I would ask that as we leave, that each of us would leave with maybe just a few things, nothing else, to give attention to this week as we try to be God honoring in our prayers.
[time=3529] Thank you, God, for who you are.
[time=3531] Thank you for the chance to be together this morning in your name we pray, amen.
