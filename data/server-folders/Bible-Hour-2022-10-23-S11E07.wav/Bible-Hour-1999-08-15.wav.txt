[time=30] [MUSIC - 12 seconds]
[time=49] Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=53] Thank you for joining us.
[time=54] We trust that the music and message from God's word will help you in your Christian walk.
[time=59] Stay tuned.
[time=60] Now let's join our service.
[time=62] [MUSIC - 207 seconds]
[time=291] Well, let me invite you this morning to open your Bible to Daniel, Daniel chapter 10.
[time=297] And we've been making our way through the book of Daniel the last several weeks, maybe I guess months, and we started in Daniel 10 last Sunday, and we're unable to finish, and so we come back to it again this morning, Daniel chapter 10.
[time=315] The opening question last week was this, do you remember the first time you looked into a microscope?
[time=323] How what appeared to be nothing but a drop of water to the naked eye was in fact teeming with all kinds of life and activity.
[time=332] In fact, the more we were exposed to the microscopic, the more we discovered there's a whole world of activity going on every second of every day that completely escapes our unaided perceptive abilities.
[time=347] We said last time that Daniel probably never had the privilege of that kind of an experience looking through the lens of a microscope.
[time=354] But he was given a different experience, an amazing experience, a gut-wrenching, overwhelming, utterly exhausting experience looking through the lens of a vision into the supernatural, where one minute all he could see or perceive was the natural physical world all around him.
[time=375] And then the next instant, God opened his eyes to see a raging spiritual battle going on between the angels of God and Satan's demonic host.
[time=387] We noted that Daniel chapter 10 is a rather amazing chapter.
[time=391] It may stand alone in all of the Bible, not because of its disclosing of this spiritual battle, but because it really seems to go nowhere.
[time=400] It doesn't really reveal any new truth about the future of Israel.
[time=404] It doesn't advance the storyline of Daniel and his captivity there in Babylon.
[time=409] You get the distinct impression that God just wanted Daniel to know that just outside the reach of his awareness capacities, the awareness capacities of the normal five senses.
[time=422] There was a high drama, high stakes, life and death, spiritual warfare going on, and it related to him.
[time=432] Daniel in chapter 10 is praying. His heart is overwhelmed, and we think it's overwhelmed over the complacency of the people of God for the privilege of returning to Jerusalem and re-establish their nation.
[time=446] And as he mourns and prays and loses his appetite really for almost 21 days, in the midst of this prayer, we read in Daniel chapter 10 verse 12, this.
[time=457] Then he said to me, this is the angel that finally arrived, do not be afraid Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart on understanding this and on humbling yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come in response to your words.
[time=473] But the prince of the kingdom of Persia was withstanding me for 21 days.
[time=479] And then behold Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, for I had been left there with the kings of Persia.
[time=487] Skip down to verse 20, then he said, do you understand why I came to you?
[time=493] I shall now return to fight against the prince of Persia, so I am going forth, and behold, the prince of Greece is about to come.
[time=500] However, I will tell you what is inscribed in the writing of truth, yet there is none who stands firmly with me against these forces except Michael, your prince.
[time=512] We are immediately introduced to the spiritual dimension, this prince of the kingdom of Persia is of course not just a mere human, there is behind the human, a demonic force that is doing battle with this angel that has been sent from God to answer Daniel's prayer.
[time=530] This kingdom, or rather this prince of the kingdom of Persia is more mighty, he is more powerful than the angel originally dispatched, and so God must send the super angel Michael to be in his defense.
[time=543] He frees the angel, the angel arrives, has discourse with Daniel, we don't know much about what is said, it as I have said does not get real clear for us in Daniel 10.
[time=552] And the chapter closes with this angel, alerting Daniel to the fact that he must return to his post in the spiritual warfare, for he alone, along with Michael, must do battle against this great prince of the kingdom of Persia.
[time=569] This is not the only spiritual battle we learn about in the Bible, we can read in Matthew 4, Jesus is in hand to hand combat, spiritual warfare against Satan himself.
[time=580] Paul talks often times about how Satan has thwarted him in his attempt to go to a particular place to share the gospel or to minister to a church.
[time=591] In Jude 9 we read about Michael, again the super angel fighting personally against Satan over the body of Moses.
[time=598] The question comes to us this morning as it did last week, what are we to do about it?
[time=604] The Bible makes it obvious to us in various places there is just beyond the reach of the awareness capacity of our five senses, a spiritual battle going on every minute of every day.
[time=616] But what are we to do about it? And rather than speculate and maybe try to conjure things out of Daniel 10 that might not be there, I invited this last week as I again do this morning to Ephesians chapter 6.
[time=629] And so again if you have your Bible turned to Ephesians chapter 6, you say why Ephesians 6?
[time=635] Well, it is undoubtedly the clearest discussion and instruction to the believer about the existence of the spiritual warfare and what we are to do about it.
[time=647] There is no clear text in all of the Bible.
[time=650] Ephesians chapter 6, let's read verses 10 to 12, finally be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might.
[time=658] Put on the full armor of God that you may be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil.
[time=665] For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.
[time=677] Paul is saying to you and to me that there is a struggle going on.
[time=684] And it's not really the one that we see, it's not really the one about flesh and blood.
[time=688] The spiritual warfare works its way out in the affairs of our lives, but the real battle is not the one we see with flesh and blood.
[time=697] It is instead against these powers, these world forces, these rulers, these forces of wickedness in the heavenly places, the kind of stuff we saw behind the scenes in Daniel 10.
[time=710] And he is saying the way you combat that, the way you keep yourself from being overly vulnerable to that kind of spiritual attack is by putting on verse 11, putting on the full armor of God.
[time=725] And so Paul, writing to a bunch of people living in the Roman Empire, begins to talk about spiritual truth, kind of an unknown thing, by comparing it to something very known.
[time=738] And that would have been a Roman soldier and his armor.
[time=741] And he is going to say fight the spiritual battle with the weapons or with the armament that you recognize the Romans to wear, but he draws spiritual parallels to the spiritual world.
[time=754] And in that way I think he hopes to put some better understanding in the minds of his readers and in our minds today of how to fight the spiritual battle.
[time=765] Now as I said last time I want to say it again, you do not fight Satan by focusing on Satan or by talking to Satan or by becoming preoccupied with this spiritual realm.
[time=777] Or by looking for demonic explanations for your life circumstances, your moods, your emotions, your sin or your happenings.
[time=786] That is never the call of scripture to go around and try to assign some demonic spiritual influence to everything that happened in your life that was other than what you wanted to have happened.
[time=798] That would be an unhealthy preoccupation.
[time=801] The Bible simply alerts us to the fact that the battle is there and then calls us to stand firm in a proactive, forward-looking, God-focused, kingdom-oriented pursuit of personal holiness for the glory of God.
[time=817] You want to know how to fight the battle against Satan in a nutshell?
[time=820] You don't do it by looking at him and his demonic force and trying to explain your life to what they may have been doing behind the scenes.
[time=828] You simply are aware that they are there which provides the motivation to put your focus on God and on his truth and on your relationship with him and on the pursuit of personal holiness.
[time=840] That in general is what this text is about, and then of course in general is what Daniel's life was all about.
[time=847] Daniel was all about honoring God with his life, no compromise, and all around him was happening stuff he didn't even know about.
[time=855] So this morning, seven questions that will reveal your vulnerability to demonic attack.
[time=861] Seven questions that will reveal your vulnerability to demonic attack, and these questions aren't my questions.
[time=867] I mean they are in a sense, but they don't come out of my head.
[time=870] They come out of these pieces of the armor that are described as the proactive way to fight.
[time=876] And so a question has been assigned to each that might help us assess our vulnerability.
[time=883] The first question I gave last time, and I'll just review, is your mind actively engaged in confronting error with truth?
[time=892] We understand that in this text it says verse 14, "Stand firm therefore, having girded your loins with truth."
[time=901] And the whole call there, the imagery of the Roman soldier, the long cloak, the loins, they had to be tucked up into the belt.
[time=909] And what was then almost a blanket for them, for protection from the elements, converted into almost athletic shorts where they can move and run and have mobility in battle.
[time=920] And that was exactly how they did it.
[time=922] They didn't just robe, they just tucked up that big garment and cinched in their belt, and it was as if now they had on the real apparel of war.
[time=931] They were, "Why does it relate to the mind?" Because in 1 Peter 1, 3, the same phraseology is used, gird your mind for action.
[time=941] And we understand then the first place of attack that Satan will bring upon our life is in our thought processes, what we believe to be true, what we think about.
[time=950] And he is a liar. The Bible says that he is a liar from the beginning, he is the father of lies.
[time=955] He is a clever, brilliant, winsome, convincing liar who starts with just small little bits of misinformation mingled with truth.
[time=966] And if you can find his way into your mind, into your values, into your thought processes about God, who is God, what is he about, why does he do the things he does, why doesn't he do certain things.
[time=980] If Satan can get you to think differently about God, then God reveals himself right here in the Word of God, he is winning the battle in your life.
[time=990] But it's not just God, it's your thoughts about you, your values, what you think is important, he wants to get you to believe falsehood about real value in life, priorities, etc.
[time=1005] He wants to, in a sense, bring a constant steady flow of falsehood into your life, not expecting you to believe all of it.
[time=1017] He just wants you to buy into a little piece of something that connects with you.
[time=1022] And once he has that in-road in your life, he wants to expand on it and develop it and eventually have major in-roads into your thinking and thought processes against God himself in his Word.
[time=1034] Number two, and this is where we begin fresh this morning, number two, are you in the pursuit of personal holiness?
[time=1041] Are you in the pursuit of personal holiness? Look again at Ephesians 6, 14, stand firm therefore, having girded your loins with truth, that's the first one.
[time=1051] Now then, having put on the breastplate of righteousness, the breastplate of righteousness.
[time=1059] And as you know, in battle, the breastplate would either have been solid metal or it would have been some kind of mesh.
[time=1067] And it was essential because it protects the heart and the lungs and the intestines and an injury to that part of your body, especially in that day and age, was inevitably fatal.
[time=1081] So that's the piece of armor. And what is its tie to the spiritual battle? Righteousness.
[time=1088] Morality. Morality.
[time=1093] The way to fight off the attacks or to be less vulnerable to Satan is to live a godly, pure, righteous life.
[time=1103] The fact is this, Satan wants to undercut your love and devotion and your commitment and your faithfulness to God.
[time=1109] By first, engaging you in some kind of compromising sinful behavior that will eventually grow to the point that it destroys your marriage, your kids, your job, your reputation, this church.
[time=1125] Bring reproach upon the name of God and eventually, if he could, he would take your life through that very sin.
[time=1133] He wants to kill you. He wants you dead. Make no mistake about it. He doesn't just want a compromise of immorality.
[time=1138] He doesn't just want you to fall in some particular area. He wants that to begin the process of a degrading situation in your life until finally everything you hold dear has been destroyed by your self-destructive sinful patterns.
[time=1153] That is his deal on this one. You say, "What kind of sin?" "Well, I didn't want to make up my own list."
[time=1159] So I just went over to the little sin list. You can find there are several of them in the Bible. You could go to the Ten Commandments or maybe I went to 1 Corinthians 6. Remember that list?
[time=1168] It starts with sensual sin. He wants you to compromise somehow at some level in the arena of the incredibly tempting area of sensual sin, fornication, which describes sexual activity among people who are not married.
[time=1186] He's looking for a chance in your life on that level right now. He's actively looking for a chance.
[time=1193] For those of us who are married, he's looking for adultery. He wants us to become disenchanted with our spouses. He wants our spouses' faults to become very obvious to us and egregious.
[time=1205] He wants us to reach breaking points in our relationship with our spouse where we say, "That's it. That's the last time. That's the straw that breaks the camel's back.
[time=1215] I may stay married to you at least, but I will never really engage in the pursuit of love with you again and become vulnerable then to some outside interest."
[time=1225] He is looking. He is hunting. He is actively pursuing that.
[time=1231] The other little sensual thing that comes up would be the homosexual thing. In 1 Corinthians 6 and men, it comes to us in our culture.
[time=1242] As the sensual movement gains its momentum in our culture like cultures gone by and just read your history books.
[time=1252] The country gives itself more and more to the things of the sensuality. Homosexuality is fast riding the back of that wave.
[time=1263] He wants you to find some sense of sexual excitement, some sense of relief, some sense of draw, some sense of connectivity, sexually with people of the same sex.
[time=1281] He is looking. He is hunting.
[time=1286] This is strange as it works its way out in our culture. The stuff that I am reading, the stuff that seems to be happening in our day and age.
[time=1294] It is not as if this is just relegated to people who may from their very earliest sexual inclinations have felt that.
[time=1302] This is the whole bisexual movement that is gaining speed. Sex is sex who cares who it is with is the idea.
[time=1313] 1 Corinthians 6 also talks about materialism. In that day, thievery and covetousness in our day defining the reality and the quality of our lives based upon the things we possess, the places we can go, the cars we can drive, the clothes we can wear.
[time=1329] He is looking for you to compromise your obedience to get something like that, your integrity, your truthfulness, your honesty with your boss.
[time=1340] He is trying to find a very subtle starting point in your life to seek compromise of obedience for things.
[time=1352] The last thing that comes in this little list is escapism. It talks about drunkenness and reveling and carousing and this whole sense of instant gratification to compromise our holiness, to compromise staying under a trial, James 1, to escape from what may be a very hard path of obedience.
[time=1375] Satan is trying to draw you into a very quick fix of some kind or another and alcohol might symbolize the anesthetizing effect of whatever that temptation is.
[time=1390] This is one of his main strategies. He wants in somewhere and where a believer is fully in submission to God and obedience.
[time=1401] And I'm just talking because this is what this point is about. I'm not talking about your heart and your mind right now. I'm just talking about behavioral obedience.
[time=1409] You are then in that place protected in great ways from all kinds of harm that might come to you.
[time=1417] But if he can get you to just secretly back here where you don't think anybody can see, if he can just get a little chink in your breastplate of disobedience, he can go after your internal organs.
[time=1432] He can go after what he really wants and deal you fatal blows and bring all kinds of havoc and wreck to your life.
[time=1446] Now there may be a connection between the first point and the second point.
[time=1453] And it seems as though whichever you're vulnerable in, he'll start there and then go from point A to B or B to A. What do I mean by that?
[time=1461] Many people will lose a spiritual battle with Satan because they first believe something that isn't true. They're back and not girding their minds.
[time=1469] It may have been trained to obey outwardly so that's really rigid in their life.
[time=1475] And so Satan gets in first through the mind and corrupts the thought processes which eventually it confuses their values, confuses their emotions and they end up doing things they never otherwise would have done.
[time=1486] And you see that in the false prophets like 2 Peter 2, they come it says secretly inducing destructive heresy.
[time=1494] They come into a Christian community where people are thinking properly and they get these what are called destructive truth.
[time=1503] It's a mind thing first and then the text says many follow after their sensuality.
[time=1508] What happens first is they lose the mental battle and then secondly they give away in their behavior.
[time=1513] But we find the scripture the opposite is also true.
[time=1516] There are people with really good orthodox belief systems who have all the theology really tightened up tight in terms of the, and they're very difficult to attack on that level.
[time=1527] And so Satan gets his way into their life through some compromise.
[time=1532] And eventually if he can compromise a particular area, maybe in sensuality, maybe in materialism or maybe in escapism or some other avenue,
[time=1540] then that compromise begins to cause integrity problems in the heart and mind of the individual and they no longer have the moral resolve to believe what they used to believe.
[time=1551] And now that's in question. Now he's got you on both sides.
[time=1554] That's what he wants. He wants to unwind both.
[time=1557] And once he can get that cycle going in your life, he can spin you off into uselessness.
[time=1564] It's very, very connected reality.
[time=1569] So under this point here, Satan wants to snatch truth out of our minds.
[time=1575] He wants to replace it with lies and undermine pure holy living with immorality, greed, envy, hate, lust, etc.
[time=1583] Or he wants to get into our lives first through unconfessed sin, hatred, anger, lust, envy, greed, immorality, anything
[time=1593] so that he can work backwards up the system to affect eventually our minds where we no longer are as sure about the things of God as we once were.
[time=1602] So how vulnerable are you this morning to the unseen spiritual conflict that rages all about you?
[time=1611] And the second question is this, are you in the pursuit of personal holiness?
[time=1616] Or are you secretly in your mind while the whole demonic host watched with baited breath secretly to us openly to them compromising your breastplate?
[time=1630] I guarantee you, you may fool us. You may hide it from us. You will not hide it from them.
[time=1637] News of your compromise morally will rock their world with joy and anticipation.
[time=1645] They will intensify their effort. They will focus and seek to have you for lunch.
[time=1651] Number three, are you anchored in the grace of God?
[time=1655] Are you anchored in the grace of God? Now where is this coming from?
[time=1659] Verse 15, having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace.
[time=1666] Now that's an interesting little phrase, having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace.
[time=1671] Now a lot of commentators, and they may be right and I may be wrong, you can go either way here and not get in a lot of trouble.
[time=1676] But let me at least say what they think. A lot of times they think the gospel shod your feet with the gospel.
[time=1681] They go to Romans 10, how blessed are those, the feet of those who deliver the gospel.
[time=1685] And they want to say that the armament and the deal here is to be aggressively sharing your faith.
[time=1690] For a lot of reasons I don't have time to go into this morning.
[time=1694] We could go there, I just don't think that's it. Let me tell you where I think we are on this thing.
[time=1698] The feet, the shod your feet, how did a Roman soldier do that?
[time=1704] He would get these sandals right and then they would stick in the bottom of it, pieces of metal or sharp rock.
[time=1711] Because in battle they first needed these sandals because they'd march forever and their feet would get worn out.
[time=1717] But when they actually got into battle they needed footing, they needed a sense of stability, they needed to be able to stand strong.
[time=1724] And so it's the predominant notion of being anchored or having your foundation.
[time=1730] Now foundation in what? Or anchored in what? Look again at verse 15.
[time=1734] Having shod your feet or having been anchored in the preparation of the gospel of, now here's the flavor of peace.
[time=1741] Now here's my take on this. And this is why I say are you anchored in the grace of God.
[time=1747] This is all about truly believing that you are really at peace with God through Christ.
[time=1755] Now again, this is not the unbelievers. This is to believers.
[time=1758] This is all about you and I as having already given our lives to Christ, being able to stand firm against this spiritual battle.
[time=1765] And the notion is being anchored in the fact that the battle between you and God is really over.
[time=1773] Now why do I say that? When the battle heats up and you begin to compromise either mentally and let your loins down a little bit and believe some falsehood.
[time=1785] Or when the purity of your life, the breastplate has taken some, you know, hits.
[time=1793] And you now have either mentally or actually engaged in some sin.
[time=1801] The accuser, which is his other name, one of his other names, Satan, the accuser will swoop down in thunderous, biting, piercing, sorties of unworthiness.
[time=1813] He will come over and over and over and over again, not trying now to entice you to new levels of sin, but stopping right with this victory
[time=1823] and hoping to lead you to the place of despair, to bring you to the place of losing hope.
[time=1830] He wants to capitalize on whatever victory he's got in your life with your compromised sin by making you feel unprecedented, unmitigated amounts of personal shame.
[time=1844] Unbiblical shame, unhealthy shame, self contempt and reproach.
[time=1850] He wants to drown you in a sea of hopelessness, not that God isn't who he said he is, not that the Bible isn't what it said it is, but that you simply don't measure up.
[time=1865] He is the ultimate accuser, he is the ultimate shame, or he wants to feel your heart with a sense of blame and shame that is wholly unbiblical and unhealthy.
[time=1876] He wants to steal from you all your sense of value and giftedness and ability to contribute.
[time=1884] He wants you to feel like you are at war with God again.
[time=1890] Only this time it's even worse because the first time you came to Christ there was forgiveness and there was hope and there was joy and there was a fresh clean start and there was a study of the Word of God and there was progressive movement and obedience
[time=1905] and you'd gotten down the road a little ways and you were saying, "Man, wow, things are different now."
[time=1913] And then he finds that in the battle he can gain a victory here or there and he wants either all at once through one cataclysmic moral failure or through a series of slow quiet compromises undermining your behavior and your commitment to the truth.
[time=1928] He eventually wants to come in with the final shot which is to get you to feel unworthy of the God who loves you, to feel no sense of value, no sense of usefulness in the kingdom.
[time=1944] You're immobilized and kind of all balled up in a sniveling mass of uselessness, hopelessness, a feeling of ineptitude.
[time=1959] Paul knows all about it. Paul knows all about it.
[time=1966] Nearing the end of his life, having spent every day of his converted life trying to bring people to Christ and establish and build churches.
[time=1977] By the time he gets to Corinth, he's laying on this sick bed and he's physically ailing and he's been through more physical trauma than anybody can imagine.
[time=1986] And he looks across the horizon of the work that he has done and the churches that he has established and there's problems in every single one of those churches.
[time=1996] He has no idea that he will be known throughout history as the one that God used to launch the New Testament church.
[time=2005] He has no idea that these letters that are going back and forth to all these churches are going to become the stuff that we know as the Word of God.
[time=2012] He doesn't get any of that stuff. And he says, "Therefore, since we have received this ministry, we do not lose heart."
[time=2021] Here he is, up in years as strong a man as you could possibly find in the kingdom of God.
[time=2027] He is mature. He has received visions from God in the Arabian desert out of which he has written the New Testament.
[time=2034] In other words, he has the greatest grasp on New Testament truth probably if anyone has ever lived besides Christ.
[time=2042] And he is huddled up in a port city on a sick bed doing battle for his own heart so that he won't give up.
[time=2063] Satan is, and we don't know for sure, and I'm not trying to say I know for sure, but if you ask me the stuff going on behind that passage, 2 Corinthians 4, and that whole life experience is Satan is, you know, I can't get him on moral things and I can't get him on truth.
[time=2078] I'm just going to get him to look around and realize that everything isn't perfect.
[time=2082] Everything isn't the way it is and everybody hasn't accepted him and everybody hasn't fallen at his feet.
[time=2086] And all these churches have trouble and if I could just get him to lose heart.
[time=2092] And in that, if I could just get him to question the love of God.
[time=2100] Well, here is the truth, my friends. The grace of God is boundless and it's endless.
[time=2106] Listen to me now. No sin, no behavior that a believer can ever do is beyond his forgiveness.
[time=2112] There is no end to his love. There is no end to his commitment. There is no end to the second chance that he will give.
[time=2118] There is no place of sin too far away that he personally can't reach us with his forgiveness and his love.
[time=2125] And so David tries out how blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven and whose sin is covered.
[time=2131] Daniel, excuse me, David knew what it was like to live a full year of time.
[time=2135] No longer experiencing the peace of God. No longer anchored with the subjective sense that all is well with God.
[time=2146] So we shod our feet with the Gospel and remind ourselves that God will always wash me thoroughly from all my iniquity.
[time=2153] That God will always cleanse me from all of my sin.
[time=2156] That God will always created me a clean heart, renew a steadfast spirit.
[time=2161] God will never cast me from his presence. God will never take his Holy Spirit from me.
[time=2165] He will always restore the joy of my salvation. He will always sustain me with a willing spirit.
[time=2175] This is that inner sense, that inner battle for your continued openness to the truth that God loves you unconditionally for all of eternity.
[time=2187] And he has put the matter to bed. You're at peace with God.
[time=2195] So I ask you how how vulnerable are you to the unseen spiritual battle that rages all around you?
[time=2202] The question comes this way, how firmly grounded, how mentally and emotionally committed are you to the grace of God?
[time=2209] To the never-ending, limitless, boundless, eternal, inexhaustible grace of God in your life.
[time=2217] Question number four. Question number four. Are you seeking to advance the kingdom of God?
[time=2226] Are you seeking to advance the kingdom of God? Look at verse 16.
[time=2230] In addition to all, taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming missiles of the evil one.
[time=2238] Now again, go back to the Roman fighting machine and realize there were two kinds of shields.
[time=2243] One was a little small shield that you'd wear on your arm and kind of fight up and close, and that's a different Greek word.
[time=2250] The word that Paul uses here is for the kind of shield that was body length.
[time=2255] It was as tall as the soldier was tall, and what they would do in that day, and you've seen it in the movies and probably looked at it in history books and such, is they would put these thousands of soldiers on the front line, and each guy would have his own shield, and then they'd stand close together, so they became kind of a movable wall.
[time=2274] And there'd be three or four rows of those guys, and then behind those guys, and sometimes historians will tell you sometimes a Roman army would line these guys up for a mile long.
[time=2282] The front would be a mile across, a mile of men standing close with these big, huge shields.
[time=2288] And then behind them would come the archers, and both teams would do this.
[time=2292] The archers would come and they would wrap the tip of their arrow with cloth and then soak it in pitch and then light it on fire and then fire it over, and it was because the arrow might miss, but if nothing else, the impact of the arrow landing either on a shield or on a helmet or on a breastplate or on the ground,
[time=2309] what they were hoping for was the impact would cause the lit pitch to spatter
[time=2315] than it would immobilize these guys.
[time=2317] It would bring all kind, break rank and fall apart and become vulnerable for attack.
[time=2322] That's why I asked this question.
[time=2326] Are you seeking to advance the kingdom of God?
[time=2329] Do you understand that your defense against Satan includes offense?
[time=2333] Do you understand that part of winning the spiritual battle is not just taking care of you, your thought life,
[time=2339] your personal holiness, and your subjective feelings about being at peace with God.
[time=2343] It includes the commitment to advance the kingdom of God and soldiers who are not in line and in rank
[time=2349] and who are fighting and who are taking up their place in the ranks of God to advance the kingdom of God are vulnerable.
[time=2358] So the question is, do you know your place in the kingdom of God? Do you know your spiritual gifts?
[time=2362] Do you understand where those spiritual gifts fit and contribute to the ministry of this particular church as God has placed you here?
[time=2369] Are you advancing the cause?
[time=2373] And there is, with this, with this, a shield of faith that comes.
[time=2380] That as you are together and as you are solidly linked one with another, you begin to move and advance the kingdom of God.
[time=2389] It's this shield of faith, look at it there, which is able, verse 16, to extinguish all the flaming missiles of the evil one.
[time=2397] It's this notion that God has called me to accomplish something for the kingdom.
[time=2402] And I know I'm going to be on the front line as I try to do that, and I know he's going to be firing stuff at me, but I believe,
[time=2409] I believe despite the discouragement, despite the setbacks, despite all the stuff that happens against my advancement,
[time=2417] I believe that God is in this with me.
[time=2420] Probably the classic example of that is Joseph.
[time=2424] Joseph received a dream from God that he was going to be used of God.
[time=2428] Before he know it, his brothers hate him and they sell him to a caravan right down into Egypt.
[time=2435] He's a slave, and in that slave position, he has distinguished himself and has risen to a very high level of society in charge of Potiphar's house.
[time=2445] You remember this story?
[time=2447] And he must have at that time had a sense, well, this is really different than I thought what God was doing, but he may still be keeping his promise in the dream to use me for his purposes.
[time=2455] Because now, look at me, I've risen to power down here as a slave in Egypt.
[time=2462] Just as he was getting comfortable with that, Potiphar's wife began to try to seduce him, and he resisted temptation and in her fury and in her anger because of his resistance,
[time=2473] she accuses him wrongly, and he is thrown in jail.
[time=2476] With absolutely no hope of any defense or parole, there was no trial.
[time=2481] In fact, Potiphar could have just killed him instantly, but he was gracious to him and put him in jail instead.
[time=2486] And so I'm sure that Joseph expected it was reasonable for him to assume he would spend the rest of his life now in jail.
[time=2493] But as the story unfolds, Joseph had faith.
[time=2500] Joseph had a kind of faith that said, "You know what? I believe that God has involved in my life.
[time=2505] I believe in the dream. I believe in the revelation he gave me.
[time=2508] I believe. I don't know how. I can't see it. I don't understand it, but I believe that eventually somehow God is going to use this."
[time=2515] And so he continued to march against the adversity, against the uncertainty, against the obvious contradicting information.
[time=2521] And as you know, the story God was in charge and God was using him to do one of the greatest things in all the history of Israel.
[time=2528] It wasn't too late that he was miraculously delivered from jail through the interpretation of the dream and became vice monarch of the land and made provision for the nation of Israel, and it was in fact the way they found their way to Egypt, all a part of God's plan.
[time=2543] Abraham, the same thing.
[time=2545] "Given a promise, given a promise, I will make you a great nation, and through your nation I will bless the other nations." This is frontline military stuff.
[time=2553] Abraham, I've got a plan for you in battle.
[time=2556] And Abraham was almost, well, a hundred years or older and no son, and without a son, how can the nation come into existence?
[time=2564] But he had the shield of faith. It was always tied to the Word of God.
[time=2567] It says in Romans 4, yet with respect to the promise of God, Abraham did not waver in unbelief.
[time=2573] Even though all the circumstances would have led him to reasonably and rationally conclude that God was not going to use him in the battle, as he said.
[time=2582] The text says he grew strong in faith, giving glory to God, being fully assured that what he had promised he was able also to perform.
[time=2592] The shield of faith, my friends, is the faith in the confidence that God has a plan to use you for his kingdom.
[time=2601] And as you advance, as you get in the line, and as you begin to work your way into the battle, even though the flaming missiles come, as they did to Joseph, as they did to Abraham, you refuse to interpret your circumstances now as if they were the final statement on God's willingness, commitment, and desire to use you.
[time=2623] And you disbelieve the evidence to believe his word is the way to say it.
[time=2628] You disbelieve the obvious conclusions of the circumstances and evidences of your life to believe that if he said he was going to use me, he will.
[time=2636] And he has said that to each and every one of us, not just Abraham, not just Paul, not just Joseph.
[time=2642] Proverbs 30 talks about this. Every word of God is tested. He is a shield to those who take refuge in him.
[time=2650] Proverbs 18, the word of the Lord is tried. He is a shield to all to you.
[time=2655] How do you take refuge in the Lord? How do you shield yourself from the flaming attacks of Satan?
[time=2660] You go back to the promises of God, over and over and over again.
[time=2665] Well, let me just briefly give you the next two questions right of time, and I've got to conclude.
[time=2673] The next question, number five, is are you living for today? Are you living for today?
[time=2678] If you look at verse 17, it says, "Take up the helmet of salvation." You see the guy and he goes into battle with this helmet, so when he gets hit and attacked and punched and all that stuff, of course you've got to protect your head.
[time=2691] 1 Thessalonians 5.8 tells us that this piece of armor is really the helmet which is the hope of salvation.
[time=2698] And that's why I say, are you living for today? Satan, more than anything else, wants you to stop living in light of eternity.
[time=2704] He wants you to disbelieve or mitigate or see vaguely the fact that God has given you everything pertaining to life and godliness,
[time=2712] that he has blessed you richly beyond your wildest dreams, and that those come in full in heaven.
[time=2719] And so therefore be willing to serve him at any level, in any post, on any assignment in the here and now,
[time=2726] because of what he has promised you as so splendorous and fulfilling in the future.
[time=2730] That is what 1 Thessalonians 5.8 calls the helmet, the hope of salvation.
[time=2736] If he can get you to think that you better live for today because today is really all that matters,
[time=2743] or today matters enough that I'm going to compromise all out wholesale commitment to God, because if I really am committed to God, I won't get this, and I won't get that, and I won't get this, then he has successfully taken your eyes off of the glory of heaven and the wonder of all that is ours,
[time=2760] so as to live a less than fully devoted life here on earth.
[time=2767] And so the question comes, are you living for today?
[time=2769] Are there things you know that God would have you do, that you do not do, because they represent too much sacrifice of now,
[time=2778] too much hardship now, too much giving up of what you want now.
[time=2783] Satan is right in the middle of that thought process.
[time=2787] You are in battle without your helmet.
[time=2790] You are running around on a battlefield where the enemy is everywhere, and swords are flailing,
[time=2796] and arrows are flying, and fists are being thrown, and you don't have your helmet on.
[time=2804] It is the helmet of hope, and hope is the assurance, is faith is the assurance of things, hope for the conviction of things not seen,
[time=2811] and it always directs itself to heaven, to heaven, to heaven.
[time=2820] I should go on now, but I can't resist. Let me read this to you.
[time=2825] By faith, listen to this, listen to how much they gave up in their lives.
[time=2829] In their faith, they conquered kingdoms, they performed active righteousness, they obtained promises, and they shut the mouths of lions.
[time=2835] They quenched the power of fire, they escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight.
[time=2842] Women received back their dead by resurrection, and others were tortured, not accepting their release in order that they might obtain a better resurrection.
[time=2849] Others experienced mockings and scorching chains and imprisonment.
[time=2852] They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were tempted, they were put to death by the sword.
[time=2857] What about in sheep skins, goat skins, destitute, afflicted, ill-treated, wandering in deserts and mountains and caves and holes in the ground?
[time=2865] Why? Why would anybody live like that today?
[time=2870] Hebrews 11, that's what I just read out of. The answer comes in the same thing, it says this.
[time=2875] All of these died in faith, having seen and having welcomed from a distance,
[time=2885] and having confessed that they were strangers and exiles on this earth, they already admitted that this was not really home.
[time=2893] This was not the final destination. This was a place of sojourning.
[time=2898] The verse goes on.
[time=2900] For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own.
[time=2905] And indeed, they had been thinking, if they had been thinking of that country from which they went out, they would have had opportunity to go back.
[time=2913] If you keep your mind and your heart and your affections on today, you can return to living like today is all there is, is the point.
[time=2923] But it goes on. But as it is, they desire a better country. That is a heavenly one.
[time=2929] Therefore, God is not ashamed to be called their God, for He has prepared a city for them.
[time=2937] Are you living for today, or is there a wholesale abandonment in your heart to the reality that God has prepared a city?
[time=2950] And it's more splendrous and wonderful than anything could possibly be imagined.
[time=2955] It will be yours for all of eternity.
[time=2959] The clear that is in focus, the more willing you are not to live for today.
[time=2965] Well, the last one, the last two, maybe.
[time=2968] Number six, do you face temptation with Scripture?
[time=2971] And that's that wonderful little phrase in Ephesians 6 about taking up the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.
[time=2980] And when you are in battle, Satan wants you to rely on your own, when you are being tempted.
[time=2985] Satan wants you to rely upon your own wisdom, your own reasons, your own logic, your own thought processes to say no to that.
[time=2991] Because if he can get you saying no based on your reasons, he is smarter, he is quicker, he is a better liar, he is more deceitful,
[time=2998] and the stuff he can put in front of you will be more compelling than your own human reasons not to take, not to bite.
[time=3005] When you are in temptation and in the battle, close hand-to-hand combat with Satan, Jesus through Paul, in this text is saying,
[time=3014] "Get rid of your own thinking and continue to fight with nothing other than the Word of God."
[time=3020] There are two words for the Word of God and the Bible, one is logos, which means the whole Bible, the other is rema, which means the specific utterance, and that's the word here rema.
[time=3028] And it reflects back the little short sort of that they would carry 6 to 18 inches in length.
[time=3033] And it calls the believer, not just to believe in the Bible in general, it calls the believer to know the Bible well enough,
[time=3041] as Jesus did in Matthew 4 that when Satan said, "Turn the stones to bread," Jesus answered with a quote from the Old Testament,
[time=3047] "Man shall not live by bread alone." When Satan tempted him to throw himself down and worship him, Jesus didn't give reasons on his own, he just quoted Scripture.
[time=3055] No, you shall not put the Lord your God to the test.
[time=3058] Every single time Satan tempted, Jesus answered not with his own reasons and his own words, but with the very words of Scripture.
[time=3065] And so I ask you, when you do battle against Satan, do you quote Scripture?
[time=3069] Do you know and have you memorize and are they sharp and clear in your mind's eye?
[time=3073] Those Scriptures which relate most to the struggles you typically have?
[time=3077] If you don't have that fresh, if you don't have that ready, if that was something you did in the 70s, or the 80s, when you just got saved and when the Bible thing was happening, you, my friend, are running around in battle without your sword.
[time=3090] Number 7, how's your prayer life?
[time=3092] How's your prayer life?
[time=3094] Look at verses 18 and 19, with all prayer and petitioned, pray at all times in the Spirit.
[time=3099] And with this in view, be on the alert with all perseverance and petition for all the saints.
[time=3104] Pray on my behalf, pray on everybody's behalf.
[time=3106] What was Daniel doing in Daniel 10 in the midst of the raging battle that he couldn't see?
[time=3109] He was praying.
[time=3110] What was Daniel known to be doing all the days of his life?
[time=3112] Praying.
[time=3113] Listen to me very carefully.
[time=3115] Satan wants to minimize your confidence in the practice and the power of prayer.
[time=3128] And he'll do it through the death of a spouse.
[time=3130] You prayed to get better and didn't.
[time=3132] And he'll do it for the loss of a job.
[time=3133] You prayed it wouldn't lose, but you did.
[time=3135] And he'll do it through the absence of the spouse you wanted to have and hasn't delivered.
[time=3141] He will walk into any disappointment in your life that you have prayed about and say to you, therefore, don't pray.
[time=3147] It doesn't work.
[time=3148] Stop when in reality prayer was never given to us to turn God into a cosmic genie to give us everything we wanted.
[time=3155] Prayer was always given to us that we might pray according to the name of God, his will, his character, his plan.
[time=3162] Prayer was given to express our needs, but not in that expression to demand.
[time=3167] And if such demands are not met, then to write him and this prayer thing off.
[time=3174] How's your prayer life?
[time=3176] What if there was a continuum of prayer and there was a ten over here and a one over here?
[time=3180] And if you were anywhere, you know, ones and twos are, I don't really pray at all.
[time=3185] I mean, I pray at meals.
[time=3186] I sort of pray.
[time=3187] I don't really walk with God in prayer.
[time=3188] I have no journaling.
[time=3189] I have no time of prayer.
[time=3191] I have no consistent things I pray for.
[time=3193] What if if you were down here and the ones and twos, if you knew, I mean, if God could show you just how vulnerable you are and those you love and this church to Satan and his schemes.
[time=3205] I bet we'd all move, you know?
[time=3207] I bet we'd all move closer to a ten.
[time=3209] I bet we'd all find time.
[time=3211] I bet we'd all recommit to prayer lists.
[time=3213] And when we say we'll pray, we'll really pray.
[time=3215] I bet we'll be times and seasons of prayer that we'd find in our daily routines.
[time=3219] But we shut the door and turn the phone, close the lights, and get underneath and pray.
[time=3223] Like Daniel did, three times a day.
[time=3228] Wow.
[time=3232] In conclusion, let me say this to you who are believers here this morning.
[time=3236] The Bible is very clear when it says having done everything stand firm.
[time=3241] Having done everything stand firm against the schemes of the devil.
[time=3246] Have you done everything?
[time=3248] As you look at these six, seven points, are you 100% peddled to the metal, throttled out, making sure that you are doing everything to resist?
[time=3256] Not by thinking about him, but by pursuing these things.
[time=3261] To those of you who are here today who don't know the Lord, your seekers, this is an experiment to you.
[time=3266] You're checking us out. Welcome, as always.
[time=3270] This text has application to you as well. It wasn't written to you. It was written to believers, but it has application to you.
[time=3278] Let me say this to you. Satan is, as the Bible says, a roaring lion seeking someone to devour.
[time=3285] Satan is the author of death. He is the author of falsehood.
[time=3290] And I would just ask you this morning to take your own little inventory as you are finding your way through life without Jesus Christ and His power.
[time=3298] As you are reviewing now, at this point, the last tenure of your life, I am asking you the question, do you see the evidence of demonic power?
[time=3307] Not witches and goblins and spooks.
[time=3311] To see the evidence of Satan, all you have to do is look for a loss of integrity,
[time=3319] is look for your own assumption of his posture to lie, to be deceitful, not to be honest.
[time=3329] Do you see him drawing you into sensuality that promises life but offers emptiness?
[time=3334] Do you see him drawing you into escapism that really looks like that's my solution, but the more you go down there, the worse your life gets?
[time=3341] Do you see him drawing you more and more and more to the things of this world, possessions, as if to say the new TV will really solve this?
[time=3351] There are so many tangible evidences once you understand what he is about.
[time=3356] There are so many evidences of his activity in your life that probably astounds you.
[time=3361] He is real, my friends. He is real, and he wants your life.
[time=3368] The great news is that Jesus has already given his life for you, to free you.
[time=3374] In Hebrews 2 it says this, that Jesus through death might render powerless him who had the power over death, that is the devil.
[time=3381] The big deal that happened in the death and the resurrection of Jesus is Jesus once and for all won the battle over death and Satan.
[time=3389] But his victory means nothing to you as a seeker until you accept him as your Savior.
[time=3395] Until you accept Christ as your Savior, you are still in the domain of darkness.
[time=3400] But the Bible says those who come to Christ are transferred from the domain of darkness into the kingdom of his beloved son, Jesus Christ.
[time=3406] Not because of what we do, not because we are better than other people, but because we understand that the battle is bigger than us.
[time=3413] And only Jesus Christ himself can ultimately win it, and so he invites us to walk in his victory triumph through faith, accepting him as our Savior.
[time=3422] If you've never done that, my friend, you are in grave spiritual danger.
[time=3430] And we'd love to see it be different.
[time=3433] Let me invite you to stay in for a closing word of prayer.
[time=3437] If you're here today and for whatever reason, you want to give your life to Christ.
[time=3444] You're sick and tired of this life of yours, and it's downward spiral.
[time=3452] And you want to say, "Man, I want a fresh start.
[time=3455] I need to be forgiven of my sins and I need the power of God to come into my life because this downward spiral is bigger than me.
[time=3462] It seems too powerful for me to break." I want to invite you to say this little prayer right now.
[time=3469] If you mean it, if you say it in your heart and if you say it to God, you don't have to say it out loud, but if you say it in your heart to God, he will hear you this morning.
[time=3476] He will answer your prayer and he will save you.
[time=3479] It goes like this.
[time=3480] So just say it in your heart to God if you're ready.
[time=3483] My gracious God and Heavenly Father, I confess to you that I am a sinner, that I have violated your holiness.
[time=3496] But God, I want to be saved.
[time=3501] And I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God who died for my sins.
[time=3514] And I accept Him into my heart and life right here, right now.
[time=3520] For the forgiveness of my sins and for the breaking of the power of Satan over my life.
[time=3531] I love you and I thank you for saving me.
