[time=30] But there are some things on my heart that I want to say, and they best fit under this
[time=47] heading what I love about Blackhawk.
[time=49] Three things this morning I want to say, I love your love for the Word.
[time=54] I love your love for people, and I love your love for Christ.
[time=60] Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service of Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=70] Thank you for joining us.
[time=72] We trust that the music and message from God's Word will help you in your Christian walk.

[time=1003] We worship you, you have redeemed us from every nation and we worship you, you have redeemed us from every nation and we worship you, you have redeemed us from every nation.
[time=1025] They took me down the streets of heaven.
[time=1035] All the seas, too many to tell, have saw Abraham, Jacob, and Isaiah.
[time=1064] We'll talk to you tomorrow. And Timothy. Oh, but I said, Timothy, I want to see Jesus, because he's the one down the road.
[time=1094] Oh, I want to see Jesus, because he's the one down the road.
[time=1108] Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy.
[time=1138] Holy, Holy, Holy, I have my hands and say glory.
[time=1153] I have my hands and say glory.
[time=1176] I have my hands and say glory to someone down the road.
[time=1202] Oh, I stand in the midst of a multitude of those from every time and time.
[time=1223] We are your people, deep by your love, rescue from death by your love.
[time=1236] There are no words good enough to thank you.
[time=1242] There are no words to express my praise.
[time=1248] But I will lift up my voice and sing from my heart with all my strength.
[time=1261] Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah to the land.
[time=1390] [MUSIC - 53 seconds]
[time=1450] Let me invite you this morning to open your Bibles
[time=1461] to first Thessalonians chapter one.
[time=1468] This message is obviously the last that I will give, officially as pastor of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1475] And before I do and jump into this message, I want to say thank you for the privilege that has been mine to devote the time and the energy to be given the books and all the study materials we were packing my office up this week and found that I have over 3,000 tapes that I've listened to through the course of my eight years here of Bible teachers around the country as I prepare to preach each week.
[time=1499] And it's been a great privilege and we've had some wonderful times together in the Word of God.
[time=1505] As you can see from your bulletin this morning, we will not be finishing the book of Daniel.
[time=1510] I want to preach instead this message entitled What I Love About Black Hawk.
[time=1516] It's not terribly uncommon for a leader to reflect upon the condition of his flock.
[time=1522] Christ, the shepherd, the great shepherd of his church and Revelation 1 is found wandering through the seven golden lampstands making comments about their spiritual condition.
[time=1533] He says to the church at Ephesus, "I love the way you work hard and have persevered and can't tolerate false teachers." He says to the church at Pergamum, "I love the way you hold fast my name and did not deny my faith." He says to the church at Thyatira, "I love the way your deeds as of late are greater than at the first."
[time=1556] I am certainly not the shepherd of Black Hawk, rather one of the undershepherds, and as such will refrain from final authoritative review of the status of our spiritual condition.
[time=1568] But there are some things on my heart that I want to say, and they best fit under this heading what I love about Black Hawk.
[time=1575] Three things this morning I want to say, I love your love for the word, I love your love for people, and I love your love for Christ.
[time=1586] Interesting, I came upon these three points and this title, kind of all of them on my own.
[time=1591] About a month ago I settled on the title, what I love about Black Hawk, and then just began to reflect about our church, our history, and our time together.
[time=1599] And I settled on these three main points, your love for the word, your love for people, and your love for Christ.
[time=1605] As I was studying and running around in the Bible, I discovered that Paul said almost the same thing to his church there in Thessalonica.
[time=1617] So if you will, first Thessalonica is chapter one, you'll see in a sense the same three points, verse three of chapter one, he says, "constantly bearing in mind your work of faith, your labor of love, and your steadfastness of hope." Those really constitute the same things I am saying.
[time=1634] Look at verse nine where he expands on those three things.
[time=1637] He says, "For they themselves report about us what kind of reception we had with you." Here's the first one, "How you turn to God from idols." That's their work of faith, that they turn to God from idols.
[time=1649] That's what I call your love for the word.
[time=1652] And then he says, "To serve a living and true God." That is their labor of love.
[time=1658] And that is what I call your love for people.
[time=1660] You love God by loving people, as he says over and over and over in the scriptures, "If you truly love me, love one another." And the third thing he says in verse 10 is to wait for his son from heaven, whom was raised from the dead.
[time=1674] That is Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come.
[time=1677] That is what I call your love for Christ.
[time=1680] And so with your permission, I will use this text really as the backdrop or the foundation or the launching pad for the comments that I want to say to you this morning.
[time=1690] First of all, I love your love for the word of God.
[time=1695] I love the fact that every decision, every issue, every discussion, every action, every response, every expenditure, all of it, at least in my eight years, and I am sure the 20 prior to my coming, have at least been done with the goal and the intention that it is in light of the truth of God's Word.
[time=1715] I'll give you two examples of that.
[time=1717] My very first visit to Blackhawk about eight years ago.
[time=1720] I was being ushered through the halls of Blackhawk Christian School by Steve Longbrake, my wife, Heidi and I, bounced into a class being taught to, I think, sophomores in high school.
[time=1730] And nobody was in their desks.
[time=1732] Everybody was huddled in a corner on the floor, and in the middle of them was the tenth-grade Bible teacher, Tom Cashin, who was dressed not in traditional teachers' closing, but dressed as a Jewish rabbi in a little cap, all included, and he was captivating them with the cultural understanding of the Word of God that was written for these Hebrews thousands of years prior, and their eyes were full of electricity as he had captured them and was teaching them the Word of God.
[time=1764] Later, about four years later, when we were rearticulating the vision of our church in Vision 2002, we knew we wanted to head it under these four words, exalting, edifying, equipping, and evangelizing, but the uniform consensus in the room of elders, deacons, staff, was that it must not be phrased any other way than this in response to the Word of God.
[time=1787] We will exalt the Lord, edify and equip each other and evangelize our lost world.
[time=1793] They wanted to say, in effect, these are not our ideas.
[time=1796] This church is not even our idea.
[time=1799] And this isn't the stuff that we want to do because we want to do it.
[time=1803] We exist and respond exclusively to and under the authority of the Word of God.
[time=1809] It has always been that way.
[time=1811] From the founding days of David Jeremiah, this church has always lived and loved the Word of God.
[time=1820] These saints here in Thessalonica, they lived in a thoroughly secular pagan culture.
[time=1826] They lived all around them. They were lost.
[time=1829] And they were lost because they were caught up in a belief system of lies and errors which Satan, the God of that age, had successfully perpetrated on that generation.
[time=1840] It was a system of lies and half-truth that left them like a ship without a rudder with no compass, with no way to navigate true north, no absolutes, and no certainty.
[time=1851] But in verse 5 of 1 Thessalonians 1, it says this, "For our gospel did not come to you in Word only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit with full conviction." That is how the Word of God came to the church at Thessalonica, not the words of men, but the words of the power of the Holy Spirit, bringing with it the full conviction.
[time=1876] When the gospel came, when the true and living Word of God came, they recognized it for what it was.
[time=1883] Under the full conviction of the Holy Spirit and it absolutely transformed their lives. That is why they had a work of faith.
[time=1891] It was not a dead faith. It was a true and living genuine faith in God and His Word that produced absolutely transformed lives.
[time=1901] Their faith was genuine. It was not merely head knowledge.
[time=1904] It was not just intellectual assent. It was real love for the Word of God.
[time=1910] And it was so strong that it turned them from their idols.
[time=1915] They walked away from the entire, what they didn't recognize was then, but this entire satanic way of living.
[time=1923] All they knew is they were walking away from their culture.
[time=1926] They were walking away from their family, their friends, many of them, their businesses and their livelihoods only then to suffer persecution.
[time=1933] But it was the Word of God that had come to them in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction that turned them to this living God from their idolatrous way of living.
[time=1944] And so I say this.
[time=1946] I love the way you have established as the sole basis of what you believe to be the Bible.
[time=1954] I love the way you, Blackhawk Baptist Church, take these 66 books of the Old and New Testament, over 1,600 years by 40 plus authors in three languages living on three different continents, Asia, Africa and Europe.
[time=1973] While each of these separate books reflecting the marvelous richness, depth, color of background styles and vocabularies of their human authors, do at one and the same time speak with the authority of God.
[time=1987] I love your bold affirmation that all of it, the entire Word of God, in part and its entirety, originated with God, given through chosen men who spoke not, 2 Peter 1 says, as an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.
[time=2007] As such, you, the people of Blackhawk, bring a smile to the face of God and priceless treasure to yourself, both now and for all of eternity, recognize the Scriptures as the infallible, inerrant Word of God, the unique, full and final authority on all matters of faith and practice in life and death.
[time=2030] And so that is why you as a church allow the Word of God to judge you, not the other way around. That is why you as a church endeavor to regularly read, study, memorize and meditate upon the Bible, both privately and publicly, to understand its message.
[time=2046] That is why you as a church hold as one of your highest priorities, the faithful teaching and modeling of God's Word to your children.
[time=2056] That is why you as a church, immediately, dogmatically, categorically and historically, reject all doctrines, teachings or writings that do not square with the Word of God.
[time=2071] And that is why you as a church have all aspects of your lives and conduct submitted to what the Bible teaches about that area, what God has commanded you simply must obey.
[time=2084] And so, from the beginning, we have admitted the severe limitations and off self-centered distortions of our human reason.
[time=2092] We cannot, in and of ourselves, figure out the meaning of life.
[time=2095] We cannot, in and of ourselves, comprehend or establish relationship with the true and living God.
[time=2102] Yet we read at the very beginning of our Bibles, quote, "In the beginning God," a wonderful, holy, righteous, omnipotent, all-knowing, self-sustaining Father, who from all eternity past existed in face-to-face and perfect fellowship with His beloved Son, and filled with creative desire to share the wonder of that community made out of nothing, a universe that would reflect His glory and then crowned it, crowned all of creation with His creation of man, man and woman alike, fashioned in His personal image with whom He might have relationship.
[time=2145] Thank you, Black Hawk, for freely accepting the clear teaching of Scripture, that while we were originally created to have fellowship with God, we have each one of us sinned against Him, choosing to go our independent ways and thus alienating ourselves from Him, thereby suffering the corruption of our nature, rendering ourselves unable to please Him.
[time=2167] Knowing and proclaiming that our salvation is wholly the work of God's free grace,
[time=2173] not the result and whole or in part of our works of goodness.
[time=2178] Thank you for openly rejecting the common and damning myth that man is basically good, but instead standing all these years on the biblical record that each of us has been infected with the disease called sin, and we are separated from God, a condition that is without remedy through human effort, and if God were to have left us to ourselves, we would continue in hopeless disobedience and rejection of Him for all of eternity.
[time=2206] Thank you for proclaiming the good news that God has provided the way through the death of Jesus Christ, which if personally appropriated will grant forgiveness of sins the gift of life and relationship with God, living now the rest of our lives as a thank you to God
[time=2224] for the salvation He has fully and freely provided.
[time=2228] That is why you as a church have established knowing God as your highest priority
[time=2234] and plainly calling any activity, passion, pursuit that rivals your love for God nothing less than adultery, idolatry.
[time=2243] Knowing that we are all sinful, we will never naively assume we are immune to the temptation of evil, and though confident of being rescued from the penalty of our sin, we prudently conduct our lives mindful of sins on going potential to fall us.
[time=2261] And that is why as saved, redeemed sinners, we are continually striving to be more like the one who saved us, not just to be forgiven.
[time=2269] We want to exemplify Christ-like behavior in every area of our life, and we will never give up the fight to resist sin and be like Him in word and deed.
[time=2280] I love that about Blackhawk.
[time=2285] Secondly, let me say this, I love you for your love for people.
[time=2290] Back to 1 Thessalonians chapter 1, you will see Paul saying, he says, "I constantly am bearing in mind in the vernacular of this message.
[time=2299] I love the way you labor, your labor of love." Kapas in the Greek, the word labor.
[time=2306] It means straining all your power to the absolute limit of your being.
[time=2310] It describes the arduous, weary toil of sweat and fatigue.
[time=2316] I don't know just exactly what that looked like in the Church of Thessalonica, Thessalonica, but I know what it looks like here.
[time=2324] When I think about the herculean efforts, this church has made of blood, sweat, and tears.
[time=2330] Listen to this, the hundreds of man hours, year after year, and the hundreds of thousands of lives that have been touched by the living Christmas tree.
[time=2340] What would it look like if we could stack up here on this stage all of the people, all of the time, all of the money, the trips, and the prayers through all of the years that have expended for the children of Blackhawk?
[time=2354] From the nursery to the Sunday school to Awana to the Christian school to the youth ministries, straining, exerting to the point of exhaustion all of our power to love them and to teach them in the things of Christ.
[time=2368] Think back through the years of the hundreds and thousands of the elderly who have been touched by Super Sixties, shut in visitations and hospital visits.
[time=2377] Add to that the uncounted, untold, unorchestrated acts of brother to brother, sister to sister, expressions of love and edification, meals that have been delivered, lawns that have been cut, phone calls that have been made, prayers that have been offered, tears that have been shed, the list goes on and on and on.
[time=2397] It's almost as if what Paul says is true here.
[time=2401] He says to them, "Now as to the love of the brother, and you have no need for anyone to write to you.
[time=2406] For you yourselves are taught by God to love one another.
[time=2410] For indeed you do practice it toward all the brethren who are in Macedonia." And then he says this, "But we urge you, brethren, to excel still more."
[time=2420] I want to urge you this morning to excel still more.
[time=2425] Black Hawk's love for people has always led her to be in a constant state of change, flux, and innovation.
[time=2435] Let me say that again.
[time=2436] Black Hawk's love for people has always led her to be in a constant state of change, flux, and innovation.
[time=2446] Long before it was safe in Baptist churches to use handheld mics and pre-recorded music, Black Hawk did it.
[time=2456] Long before this pagan notion of a Christmas tree in the church, and secular Christmas music was accepted
[time=2466] and recognized as a way to share Christ, Black Hawk was doing it.
[time=2471] Why?
[time=2472] Because they were liberal? No. Because they were reckless? No.
[time=2475] Because they loved people and would do anything in their power to reach them with the saving gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=2483] In Matthew 19, Jesus tells the story about the new wine and the new wine skins
[time=2489] and how you must put the new wine in the new wine skin, not the old, for the old will break.
[time=2496] Jesus teaches us about the distinction between the eternal, unchanging aspects of His works
[time=2502] and the outward packaging of that activity.
[time=2506] Paul says to us in 1 Corinthians 9, 22, that part of the love that we will express to the lost
[time=2513] is that continued willingness to adapt the perfect, timeless, unchanging message of the gospel of Jesus Christ
[time=2521] is such a way that it can be accepted in the ears of the lost and the dying.
[time=2526] Paul says there, "We become all things to all men that we may by all means save some."
[time=2536] Black Hawk, we live in a world, in a culture, in a city, and in neighborhoods that are changing
[time=2542] faster than any time before us in the history of world civilization.
[time=2549] The world has never experienced the level and the pace and the degree of change that it is currently experiencing in the day in which we live.
[time=2558] Opinions, vocabularies, traditions, values, priorities, habits, and practices, it's all changing all around us every day at record setting paces.
[time=2569] Nothing is staying the same.
[time=2573] Contrary to popular wisdom, the proper first response to a changing world is not to ask, "How should we change?" But rather to ask, "What about us should never change?"
[time=2588] But then having answered that question, we need to feel free to change anything and everything about us so that those who don't yet know Christ can hear the gospel in their own language.
[time=2604] In another way, Black Hawk will only continue to fully express the heart and the mind and the love of God to this generation by renewing its own capacity to distinguish its timeless core values and eternal purposes as taught in the Word of God.
[time=2621] To distinguish those from the ministry successes and practices of its past.
[time=2628] Grounded in the eternal Word of God, we must continue to adopt ourselves and reinvent ourselves in ways that keep us relevant to those who desperately need to hear about Christ.
[time=2642] Jesus' unchanging gospel must go forward in a language familiar to the people we are trying to reach.
[time=2649] As foolish as it would be to speak English to the French, so foolish it would be for us to use outdated methods to reach the lost moderns who live in our neighborhoods.
[time=2662] The Bible is intentionally unclear about how churches can be structured and express the timeless truths in the Word of God, because no method will ever work in every culture.
[time=2672] And within the same society, a variety of ministry approaches will be necessary for every person to have the chance to hear God's Word in a language that they truly understand.
[time=2685] Market carefully though, this change, this adaptation is not a change of content
[time=2691] to perform only.
[time=2693] True followers of Christ remain true to His message, but they find ways to convey it so their hearers respond to the content rather than the packaging.
[time=2702] As we endeavor, grounded in His eternal Word, get adapting ourselves and our message that it might be heard, we have the assurance that even if they reject the message, they at least made that decision about the genuine article, not a misunderstood caricature which is wrapped in the practices of our past.
[time=2724] And so I plead with you, continue to remind yourselves of the crucial distinction
[time=2730] between what is core and non-core, between what should never change and what should be definitely open to change, between what is truly sacred and what is not.
[time=2741] And so run and plan and dream and risk and strategize and regroup and reinvent and try again with Paul, we urge you brethren to excel still more.
[time=2760] Third, and lastly, I love your love for Christ.
[time=2765] I love your love for Christ.
[time=2768] Let's look at 1 Thessalonians, chapter 1, verse 3 again.
[time=2773] He says, "They're constantly bearing in mind your work of faith, your labor of love." And here he says, "Your steadfastness of hope in what?
[time=2782] Your steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ."
[time=2788] And then the parallel statement in verse 10, he says, "And to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, that is Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath to come." This church has had a 30-plus year love affair with the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=2807] We are not in love with a church, a doctrine, a creed, a tradition, a sacrament, externals, rules, obedience, performance, or self.
[time=2814] It is all about a personal moment-by-moment, vitally enement day-to-day experiencing of the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=2824] The reason that we know the way, the reason that we have the truth, the reason that we are experiencing life is because of a person Jesus Christ.
[time=2833] And Hebrews 1, it says, that He is the radiance of God's glory, the exact representation of God's nature, and that Christ upholds all things by the power of His Word.
[time=2845] Jesus said, "I am the resurrection of the life.
[time=2851] He that believes on Me, though He were dead, yet shall He live, and whosoever lives and believes in Him shall never die." Jesus said, "I am the light of the world.
[time=2861] He who follows Me shall not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life." Jesus said, "I am the door.
[time=2868] I am the shepherd.
[time=2869] I am the Father." Excuse me, "I am the Father are one.
[time=2873] I am the bread of life." He said, "He who has seen Me has seen God, the Father, because we are one." He said, "Come unto Me, all you are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest." He said, "Whoever drinks of the water that I shall give, shall never thirst." He said, "I am the way.
[time=2893] I am the truth.
[time=2894] I am the life, and no man comes to the Father but by Me." You see, it is Christ, and Christ alone, who turned the water into wine, who filled the storm, who fed the 5,000, who walked on the water.
[time=2908] It is Christ, and Christ alone, who healed the lame man by the pool of Bassadia.
[time=2913] Peter's mother-in-law in Matthew 8, who cleansed the leper in Mark 1, who healed the paralytic of Matthew 9, the withered hand of Luke 6, the centurion's servant of Luke 7, the dying woman in Mark 9, the two blind men of Matthew 9, the deaf mute in Decapolis, the blind man in Bassadia, the man born blind in John 9, the crippled man of Luke 13, the man with dropsy in Luke 14, the ten leopards found in Luke 17.
[time=2941] He gave sight to Bartimus in Mark 10, and he gave the new ear to Malchus in John 18.
[time=2947] You see, it is Christ and Christ alone, who delivered the synagogue demoniac of Mark 1, the blind and the dumb demoniac of Luke 11,
[time=2957] the Gatorine demoniac of Mark 5, and the demon-possessed little boy found in Matthew 17, Christ and Christ alone, who raised from the dead, the widow's son of Luke 7, and likewise his good friend Lazarus from the grave in John 11.
[time=2977] And so we with the Thessalonians wait.
[time=2981] We don't wait with fear, we don't wait with tribulation or questions or uncertainty for we wait, as it says in the text, for his son from heaven, the very one whom he raised from the dead, that is Jesus, the one who delivers us from the wrath to come, who will resurrect our dead, reunite us with our loved ones, glorify our bodies, take his seat on David's throne, and their rule in perfect righteousness, defending the weak, giving compassion to the needy and destroying the wicked with his rot of iron, finally transporting us to be with him in perfect fellowship forever in his eternal kingdom.
[time=3025] And so that is why.
[time=3027] That is why we stand to our feet as we have this morning and sing everything I am, everything I have, everything I can, I bring it to you, the person of Jesus Christ with whom I am vitally and intimately connected, for you alone are worthy.
[time=3043] That is why we sing and sometimes shout, "I love your grace, I love your mercy, I love the way you help me when I call, I love your truth, I love the power of your name." But most of all, I love your presence.
[time=3057] I love your presence because we are not just about grace and mercy and help and truth and power, we are about a person, the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=3067] And so over and over spontaneously in the life of this church, we have found our way to our feet, singing hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah to the Lamb.
[time=3077] By the blood of Christ, we stand every tongue, every tribe, every people, every land, giving glory, giving honor, giving praise unto the Lamb of God.
[time=3090] Shout to the Lord all the earth, let us sing.
[time=3093] Power and majesty praise to the King.
[time=3096] Mountains bow down and the seas will roar at the sound of your name.
[time=3101] And sing for joy at the work of your hand Christ.
[time=3105] Forever I'll love you, forever I'll stand, and nothing compares to the promise I have.
[time=3112] Not in a creed, not in a church, not in a sect, not in a doctrine, but in you.
[time=3123] Hallelujah to the Lamb.
[time=3128] Let's say this morning to you that I love you, Blackhawk, and my wife loves you, and my kids love you, for a thousand reasons in general, but for at least three reasons in particular.
[time=3146] You're enduring, unflinching, unequivocal love for the inerrant, inspired, God-breathed Word of God.
[time=3158] For your innovative, risk-taking, trauma of change enduring, heartfelt love for people.
[time=3170] And above all else, your specific, informed, educated, personal, dynamic, vital moment by moment love for the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=3187] Wow.
[time=3191] I couldn't think of a better way to end this message than to ask you to stand, and so will you do that at this time.
[time=3200] I want to read to you one of the most compelling quotes that I think I've ever read to you.
[time=3206] I think I've read it to you several times in my eight years.
[time=3208] It was, of course, penned moments before a missionary would leave his office step out
[time=3214] into the hostile world around and be martyred for his faith.
[time=3220] Thankfully, neither of us have that awaiting us, but we find in our hearts the same compelling call.
[time=3229] I am part of the fellowship of the unashamed.
[time=3233] The die has been cast.
[time=3235] I've stepped over the line, the decision has been made.
[time=3238] I am a disciple of Jesus Christ.
[time=3241] I won't look back, let up, slow down, back away, or be still.
[time=3246] My past is redeemed, my present makes sense, my future is secure.
[time=3250] I am finished and done with low-living sight-walking, small-planning, smooth knees, colorless dreams, tame vision, worldly-talking, cheap-giving, and dwarf goals.
[time=3262] I no longer need preeminence, prosperity, position, promotions, plots, or popularity.
[time=3268] I don't have to be right, first, tops, recognized, praised, regarded, or rewarded.
[time=3274] I now live by presence, lean by faith, love by patience, live by prayer, and labor by power.
[time=3282] My face is set, my gate is fast, my goal is heaven, my road is narrow, my way is rough, my companions are few, my guide is reliable, my mission is clear.
[time=3292] I cannot be bought, compromised, detoured, lured away, turned back, diluted, or delayed.
[time=3297] I will not flinch in the face of sacrifice, hesitate in the presence of adversity, negotiate at the table of the enemy, or ponder at the pool of popularity, meander in the maze of mediocrity.
[time=3307] I simply won't give up, shut up, let go, or slow up, until I have preached up, prayed up, paid up, stored up, and stayed up for the cause of Christ.
[time=3316] I am a disciple of Jesus.
[time=3319] I must go until he comes, give till I drop, preach, tell everyone knows, and work until he stops me.
[time=3327] And when he comes for his own, he will have no problem recognizing me, because my banner will have been clear.
[time=3335] Let's pray together.
[time=3342] Let's pray.
[time=3347] We stand together as a body of believers bound by a like precious faith, the faith that has been once for all delivered to the saints.
[time=3357] And it is this very faith that this church has been standing upon and living and proclaiming for all of its days, that it makes it remarkable, it makes it unique.
[time=3369] In a day when the vast majority of so-called religious organizations around the world haven't got a clue, this church stands pure and true and strong.
[time=3384] And it's willingness to not only proclaim, but to submit to the true and living Word of God.
[time=3390] And that is a gift that comes from you alone.
[time=3395] This church stands ready to take the true and living gospel of the true and living Jesus Christ to yet another generation.
[time=3405] The challenges will be greater in the days ahead than they have been in the past.
[time=3410] For this new generation is more pagan than any we have ever seen.
[time=3415] The minds are more polluted than they have ever been in the history of the world.
[time=3420] Truth is relative if existent at all.
[time=3424] Pleasure is God.
[time=3426] Money is idolatry.
[time=3431] And we are at least temporarily cloaked in peace.
[time=3436] Our army seems strong, our borders seem impenetrable.
[time=3439] So who will find a need for you and for your son?
[time=3446] And but for the dynamic, genuine authentic relationships and the creative, powerful, spirit-led programming of this church,
[time=3456] this generation will be lost.
[time=3459] So kindle of fresh and cause them to excel still more in their love for people and thereby express their love for you.
[time=3469] And God emits this terrible day, it makes this challenging day, it emits the day of remarkable opportunity.
[time=3477] To be the lighthouse, may they never forget the light.
[time=3484] Jesus Christ Himself.
[time=3487] May they fall deeper and deeper in love.
[time=3490] May they sense His presence more completely with the passing of each moment.
[time=3494] May their hope for His coming become brighter and brighter and brighter so that what they become is nothing less than Christ Himself.
[time=3505] Fixing their hope, fixing their eyes on the author and perfecter of their faith.
[time=3514] So we pray your greatest blessings and thank you for our times together.
[time=3518] Pray these things in Christ's name and all God's people said. Amen, God bless you.
