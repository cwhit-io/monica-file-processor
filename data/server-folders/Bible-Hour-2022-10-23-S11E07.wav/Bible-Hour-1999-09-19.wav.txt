[time=18] We're going to talk about something that is difficult to talk about.
[time=46] It's difficult to read about it. It was difficult for me to study about it because it is so
[time=54] very deadly. It is so very tragic. Webster defines it as our sinful longing towards
[time=64] depraved affections. Some might say it is a sinful desire for a sinful pleasure. By
[time=71] sinful desire, we might mean that it moves one outside the realm of God's provision
[time=77] and/or God's wisdom. Sinful desire. Sinful pleasure in that it focuses on a kind of pleasure
[time=84] that when embraced violates God and violates others. Sinful desire for a sinful pleasure.
[time=93] What is it? It has toppled nations, crippled world leaders. It has embarrassed and made
[time=100] a mockery of presidents. It has shattered families, captured the fantasies of our young
[time=106] and held in bondage the hearts of our age.
[time=115] Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church. Thank you for joining us. We trust that the music and message from God's word will help you in your Christian walk. Please stay tuned. Now let's join our service.
[time=130] [MUSIC - 193 seconds]
[time=342] You know it's exciting being a woman. It's even more exciting being a woman at Black Hawk Baptist Church
[time=348] at this time. There are just dozens of opportunities in Christian women's ministries to plug in, to serve, and to be served.
[time=357] We're going to highlight just a couple of those ministries today. The women's Bible studies at Black Hawk Baptist Church
[time=364] exist for the purpose of recognizing, instructing, and encouraging in the study of the Word of God.
[time=370] We believe that this will result in effective communication of the gospel, the discipling toward a growing and maturing Christian lifestyle, and the nurturing and building up of the body through an awareness, development, and ministering of our personal spiritual gifts. We want to encourage a loving atmosphere for discussion of God's word,
[time=391] using discernment, patience, and wisdom, and always holding the scripture as our authority.
[time=398] Hi, I'm Dorothy Craig, and I'm the coordinator of our women's ministry of prayer care.
[time=403] In prayer care, we provide temporary assistance for women in need in our church for such things as transportation, meals, and housekeeping assistance.
[time=414] We have about 20 volunteers who will respond to requests for assistance.
[time=419] We are always in need of more women to volunteer their services, and if we can help you, just call the church and we will respond.
[time=427] [MUSIC]
[time=446] He is exalted, the queen is exalted on high, I praise Him. He is exalted forever,
[time=454] a salt in an eye with praises made. He is the Lord, forever is through shall bring,
[time=468] heaven and earth. Rejoice His holy name. He is exalted, the king is exalted on high.
[time=480] He is exalted, the king is exalted on high, I praise Him. He is exalted forever,
[time=488] a salt in an eye will praise His name. He is the Lord, forever is through shall bring,
[time=501] heaven and earth. Rejoice His holy name. He is exalted, the king is exalted on high.
[time=514] He is exalted, the king is exalted on high. He is exalted, the king is exalted on high.
[time=527] He is high and exalted and worthy of praise. With our hearts we will love and adore.
[time=537] He is high and exalted and worthy of praise. Holy is the Lord.
[time=548] Holy, holy, holy is the Lord.
[time=558] Holy, holy, holy is the Lord. He is high and exalted and worthy of praise.
[time=572] With our hearts we will love and adore. He is high and exalted and worthy of praise.
[time=582] Holy is the Lord. Holy, holy, holy.
[time=594] Lord God of mighty, early in the morning, our song shall rise to thee.
[time=609] Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty, God in preparations, message remedy.
[time=629] Holy, holy, holy, our saints adore me, passing down their fallen crowns around the glassy sea.
[time=648] Share a limb and sail up in, falling down before me, which work and are dead, evermore shall be.
[time=667] Holy, holy, holy. God of darkness I thee. Holy, I am sinful men by holy men that sing.
[time=686] Holy, thou art holy, ever is done beside me, perfect in power and love and glory to me.
[time=708] I'm reading from Revelation 15 verses 3 and 4. And they were singing the song of Moses, the servant of God and the song of the lamb.
[time=723] Great and marvelous are your actions, Lord God Almighty, just and true are your ways, O king of the nations, who will not fear O Lord and glorify your name.
[time=740] For you alone are holy, all nations will come and worship before you, for the righteous deeds have been revealed.
[time=758] Hey, good morning again. We've been in this study, you know, the book of Proverbs, the last couple of weeks, and we've asked you to maybe even join us in the memory of a weekly memory verse from this great book.
[time=772] So it's test times, everybody's standing on just kidding. I want to see how you're doing, and I give you a chance to, and I mean it, this is something that we want to do together, and we want to encourage you to take these verses home.
[time=784] They're printed for you each week, right there on the front of the bulletin, and you can take that home, and I think it's in the NASB, and that's the one we're kind of working from.
[time=792] So if you want to stick with that, that's great. If you want to go back to your own translation, that's okay too, but each Sunday, we want to at least give you a chance to be reminded of what that verse is.
[time=803] And so I don't think we're going to have it on the screen, we're just going to ask you, Proverbs 5, verse what?
[time=811] There you go, somebody's on top of it. Proverbs 5, 23, say it with me. He will die for a lack of instruction. Not all of you are speaking.
[time=824] Proverbs 5, 23, he will die for a lack of instruction, yet in the greatness of his folly, he might go astray? No, he will.
[time=837] That's a great verse. It's a great verse. If you didn't get that one this week, memorize it, I mean double up, and you got a new verse right there on the front of your bulletin.
[time=846] Give it some thought, do it as a family, do it with some friends. Whatever you can do to do it with some others, it's great.
[time=853] And also we've been asking you to, and I hope you haven't forgotten this, and I think many of us on staff are doing it, reading a Proverbs a day.
[time=861] It's great reading, it's challenging, it's convicting, it's not so difficult, you can do it, it takes about 10, 15, 20 minutes.
[time=868] But read a Proverbs a day, familiarize yourself with what this great book has to say, and we'll continue in our study today and in the coming three weeks, three, four weeks actually.
[time=881] So this morning, we're going to talk about something that is difficult to talk about. It's difficult to read about it.
[time=890] It was difficult for me to study about it, because it is so very deadly. It is so very tragic.
[time=900] Webster defines it as our sinful longing towards depraved affections.
[time=908] Some might say it as a sinful desire for a sinful pleasure.
[time=912] By sinful desire, we might mean that it moves one outside the realm of God's provision and/or God's wisdom, sinful desire.
[time=921] Sinful pleasure in that it focuses on a kind of pleasure that when embraced violates God and violates others.
[time=932] Sinful desire for a sinful pleasure. What is it? It has toppled nations, crippled world leaders, it has embarrassed and made a mockery of presidents.
[time=943] It has shattered families, captured the fantasies of our young and held in bondage the hearts of our age.
[time=950] It has destroyed trust, it has diminished respect, it has permanently tarnished reputations and endangered even the lives and well-beings of young and old alike.
[time=961] It has led bright and gifted men capable of amazing things into personal ruin and professional failure.
[time=970] It has led talented and capable women with promising careers or growing families or both into the dark despair of humiliation and loss.
[time=980] It has stripped hope, it has escalated guilt, it has seemingly won more than it's lost.
[time=987] It lies, it deceives, it promises satisfaction yet leaves us empty.
[time=993] It promises fullness yet leaves us hungry.
[time=996] It promises excitement but brings us sadness hard to describe.
[time=1001] It promises relief but delivers instead more pressure.
[time=1005] It promises happiness in the end bringing only a heartache beyond description.
[time=1010] And worst of all, worst of all proverbs and the rest of scripture tell us that it promises life and yet only brings death.
[time=1024] What is it?
[time=1027] King David, a man after God's own heart fell to it as he stood on a balcony and watched Bathsheba bathe in 2 Samuel 11.
[time=1036] Joseph in Genesis 39 ran, he fled from it leaving his coat in the clutching hands of Potiphar's wife.
[time=1046] What is it?
[time=1048] It is lust.
[time=1054] And this morning we attempt to honestly take a look at and consider you and your lust, me and mine.
[time=1065] And though we'll see it in its activity form and in its consequence form, all through the pages of Proverbs,
[time=1072] I want to invite you this morning to start instead in the book of James.
[time=1077] Turn if you would to James chapter 1 and what may be one of the clearest pictures given in all of scriptures of this killer called lust.
[time=1087] James 1, 13 through 16, James chapter 1 verses 13 through 16.
[time=1096] And before we read it, I want you to stop and I want you just to look up here for a second and I want to be clear about one thing.
[time=1103] Much of what we'll see today, especially in the pages of Proverbs as we talk about and consider this killer called lust,
[time=1111] much of it will have to do with the sexual expression of this beast.
[time=1118] But be reminded, I think you know this, I want to just make sure we're on the same page.
[time=1121] Be reminded though this morning folks of lust's multifaceted dimension.
[time=1128] It's not just about the sexual expression.
[time=1131] If it is what we've defined it as already, if it is sinful desire, you and or I,
[time=1137] going outside the provision of God to embrace a pleasure, we weren't intended to embrace in that way or at that time or in that setting.
[time=1148] That can be sexual perversion, that can be immorality, but you know what, that can be, as we've said before, a piece of cake.
[time=1155] That can be too much sleep, that can be too much internet, that can be too much TV, that can be too much of a lot of things.
[time=1164] And lust draws us towards those things and it wrecks havoc in our lives.
[time=1170] And we will see here in James 1, and we'll call this, our kind of our first point this morning, we'll call this the life of lust.
[time=1177] And you will see as I will that this thing called lust actually has a life.
[time=1182] It has a cycle.
[time=1184] And having looked at James 1, then we'll head back to Proverbs and end our time this morning by taking a closer look at just a few of the many lessons learned.
[time=1193] From lust, lessons learned from lust, and we'll see that in Proverbs.
[time=1198] But for now, let's look at James and this life of lust, look with me at verse 13, chapter 1.
[time=1204] Let no one say, when he is tempted, I am being tempted by God, for God cannot be tempted by evil, and he himself does not tempt anyone.
[time=1215] But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust.
[time=1222] Then when lust has conceived, it says there in verse 15, it gives birth to sin.
[time=1227] And when sin is accomplished, it brings forth death. Do not be deceived.
[time=1236] Don't be deceived. My beloved brethren.
[time=1241] Now, back to 13. Back to 13, this idea of God tempting or not tempting, what we're reminded of here in verse 13 at the outset is that God does not tempt.
[time=1252] Do you understand that? Do you know that? Do you understand that to be true? It is.
[time=1257] God does not tempt. Write that down, underline it, make a note of it. He doesn't tempt.
[time=1263] Who tempts? Satan tempts us. Satan tempts you and I to turn trials which God does allow, which God does bring.
[time=1274] God does allow difficult, painful, confusing circumstances to come into and around your life and mind. They're called trials.
[time=1283] God allows trials and in the midst of a trial, Satan will do his best and he will come at you from every angle conceivable to get you to move from the trial towards the temptation and hopefully the subsequent sin.
[time=1299] The temptation to move out of the trial towards the false relief that he might seemingly be providing. That's the temptation. That's from Satan. That's not from God.
[time=1311] God, remember, is too holy to be tempted. God is too loving to tempt, but he does allow trials. And just for a quick reminder, back up the page, just a few verses to verse 2 of chapter 1.
[time=1323] Same book, James 1 verse 2, consider it, all joy. My brethren, when you encounter various trials, knowing that they are this, they are the testing of your faith.
[time=1337] Knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance and let endurance have its perfect result that you might be perfect and complete lacking in nothing.
[time=1347] God allows trials. In the midst of those trials, we have a choice. And you know, one of the most forgotten verses in my opinion, and I sometimes, too many times, forget it.
[time=1360] And it's message and what it really brings you and I. And you sometimes forget it too. I'll sit and talk with folks. And so many times when we find ourselves in the midst of this trial and things are really bad and things are very confusing.
[time=1373] And we don't get it and we're not sure what to do and the pain is almost unbearable.
[time=1378] We sometimes, I'll hear folks say to me sometimes, I have nowhere to go.
[time=1383] I don't know. I have no idea what to do. How can he expect me to survive in this? I've nowhere to go.
[time=1391] And then it's either stated or implied and it's not fair.
[time=1397] And I remember and see sometimes that's me and sometimes that's you. But whether that's you or me, we sometimes forget 1 Corinthians 10, 13.
[time=1406] I think it'll come up on the screen. 1 Corinthians 10, 13. It says right there, no temptation.
[time=1412] Remember this, no temptation has overtaken you but such as is common to man.
[time=1420] And God is faithful who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able but with the temptation will provide each and every time with the temptation will provide a way of escape that you may be able to endure it.
[time=1440] And that's a great reminder because the enemy is over here screaming for you and I to just simply move out from underneath the difficulty.
[time=1452] And yet God says no, no, no, wait. First of all, don't paint the picture that way.
[time=1458] Don't make it out to be like your trial is the greatest of all time and I sometimes do that. Maybe you do too.
[time=1464] He says time out, it's common. Not to diminish or demean you but it's common, it goes on everywhere.
[time=1471] And you like them who are a part of my family have to respond in appropriate ways, it's common.
[time=1477] And I will provide a way for you. I will provide a way for you, a choice that you can make that is obedient and honoring to me.
[time=1486] He promises that. He promises that every time. And in choosing that we can do what James 1-3 called us to and that is endure, staying underneath while moving forward down a healthy road.
[time=1502] So ask yourself this morning, would you? Am I facing any trials in my life?
[time=1507] What difficult painful situation do you find yourself in?
[time=1510] What test of faith has God allowed to come across your path? Any trials as of late?
[time=1517] And then here's the question. What are you doing? What is your posture? What choices are you making in the midst of that?
[time=1525] Have you chosen God, submission to the word of God. Have you chosen to trust Him when all seems lost?
[time=1533] Have you chosen to love Him and others radically even those causing the pain with an unconditional God-given love?
[time=1541] Or are you choosing Satan's backdoor that's offered every single time?
[time=1550] Are you attempting in some way or another to get out from under the difficulty prematurely by choosing inappropriate forms, inappropriate avenues, inappropriate people,
[time=1562] inappropriate situations for your relief?
[time=1567] Which will it be? Which will it be? Pursue God, endure the trial, escape the trial, pursue lust, think of it that way.
[time=1580] I mean, and what's going on in your life today? What is it? Are you being mistreated by someone? Are you unemployed?
[time=1588] Your car needs repairs and you have no money. Your marriage is in trouble. You're being sued. You're single and feeling lonely.
[time=1596] You're married and wishing you were single. I mean, whatever it might be, whatever you might be facing, what choice, what posture will you take?
[time=1606] Pursue God, endure the trial, cling to what is right and true, escape the trial, pursue lust and the satisfaction that it promises.
[time=1617] Let's go to verse 14. Verse 14, "James goes on," but, yeah, God doesn't tempt. No, the enemy tempts.
[time=1626] But each one is tempted when he is carried away, right there in verse 14, carried away and enticed by his own lust.
[time=1636] James reminds us in this verse of lust's deceptive, life-shattering, life-altering power. And there's two phrases I want us to look at.
[time=1644] Two phrases I want you to take note of this morning. Write this down, circle it, make a note, carried away. First phrase there.
[time=1653] It says that we are carried away. That word, that phrase in the Greek, was used to describe wild game being lured into a trap.
[time=1664] That phrase was used when describing a wild beast being brought into a net or a cage. It was the trapping of an animal.
[time=1674] Carried away. Second word there, enticed, that I want us to look at. The word enticed. This word in the original language carried with it, the idea of a fisherman baiting a hook.
[time=1686] A fisherman making a steel mechanism for death, making it look good, making it look nice, making it look attractive.
[time=1699] And 14 says that each one of us is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust.
[time=1708] It reminds me, just came to me first hour. I was thinking about that and remembering back in the last couple of weeks in Proverbs.
[time=1714] And there was a verse. It won't be on your screen, but it's no problem. Turn there if you would. Proverbs 7.
[time=1720] Talking about hunters and fishermen and talking about how the enemy functions in that very way, luring us with bait and ticing us with the hook.
[time=1731] It says in Proverbs 7, 22. Proverbs 7, 22, it says this. And again, now this is in chapter 7 referring to the young man.
[time=1742] This is the young man who has made the decision. He was faced with the trial and this young man has succumbed.
[time=1750] This young man has bought the farm. This young man has chosen to pursue life elsewhere in an inappropriate place through inappropriate means.
[time=1759] And verse 22 says it's like this. Suddenly he follows her.
[time=1763] As an ox goes to slaughter or as one in fetters to the discipline of a fool.
[time=1770] Verse 23, until an arrow pierces through his liver, as a bird hastens to the snare so he does not know that it will cost him his life.
[time=1782] That's the picture. It's the hunter. It's the fisherman.
[time=1787] It's the hunter and the fisherman and they must use attractive bait. They must use and they do use attractive methods as they seek to catch and kill their prey.
[time=1799] Because you know and I know no animal is going to deliberately swallow a bear hook.
[time=1805] So Satan, so the enemy, like the hunter and fisherman hides the trap, hides the hook.
[time=1818] And here's where we have to stop people. Here's where we have to stop this morning and get out of the realm of theory and get into the realm of your life and mind.
[time=1829] And I got to ask and I want to ask and I want to ask you to hold on to this for the next 30 minutes.
[time=1834] I want you to be brave enough, bold enough, courageous enough and honest enough to identify right now a hook, a hook in your life.
[time=1844] You know what it is. You know where it comes from. You know when it shows up.
[time=1848] And it's a thing or it's a person. But you know that there are hooks out there that are baited well.
[time=1855] And they are attractive to you because of who you are and how you're wired and how you work.
[time=1861] There are hooks in your life that the enemy throws at you and dangles in front of you weekly.
[time=1871] He hides the trap. He hides the hook. And what those are in your life and what those are in my life is they're dressed up hooks in an effort to conceal the fact that embracing it will bring shame, sorrow and destruction.
[time=1884] Now you think about your hook. Please have it in your mind. Don't let go of it this morning.
[time=1890] Be willing to hold it and look at it and call it in the end today to call it what it is.
[time=1897] And that is a deadly lie. Full of destruction.
[time=1901] But hold on to it nonetheless. Picture it this morning and think about it. Let's figure this thing out.
[time=1907] Think about the power of the hook. Go back to Genesis 13 in your minds. Go back to Genesis 13.
[time=1915] Lot. Lot. Some say lot would have never moved towards Sodom.
[time=1920] Some say lot would have never gone in that direction were it not for the quote well watered plains of Jordan.
[time=1928] That looked attractive. It looked nice. It looked fruitful. Second Samuel 11.
[time=1933] Would David? I don't know the answer. You don't know the answer but it's worth asking.
[time=1938] Would David have committed adultery? What do you have done what he did with Bathsheba?
[time=1944] Had he seen the pain and destruction of the hook? The death of he and Bathsheba's son.
[time=1951] The murder of a brave soldier named Uriah. The violation of his own daughter Tamar.
[time=1957] Do the credit card companies today? Do they run commercials showing families getting their cars repossessed
[time=1969] or evicted from their homes? Does Playboy run photo shoots or articles about men in prison?
[time=1977] Serving time? Some serving life for sexually deviant crimes and pornography related offenses?
[time=1984] Men who 5, 10, 15 years ago picked up their first magazine or watched their first video one weekend while their wife was gone.
[time=1994] You've seen those things lately? You've seen those articles? You've seen those commercials? No.
[time=2001] As long as the enemy is at work you won't because the enemy, the hunter, longs for your destruction in mind.
[time=2009] And be it financial or be it sexual or be it relational? He wants us destroyed.
[time=2020] Thus the bait will always promise the opposite of what in the end it will bring.
[time=2024] And what does it bring? Look at verse 15. Back to James.
[time=2030] Chapter 1 verse 15. Then having been enticed, right? Having been carried away.
[time=2037] Then when lust has conceived it gives birth to sin. And when sin is accomplished it brings forth death.
[time=2046] Stop there and note if you will the progression that's been made. And you know what folks?
[time=2051] It's the progression that I see 99.9% of the time in my life and yours.
[time=2057] It is a progression that you can almost count on. This is the way it works.
[time=2062] This progression we've seen. Look where we've gone. We started with the emotions.
[time=2066] The lust, the desire. We're over here in the midst of the trial and the enemy says, "Hey, over here, this is much better. This will bring relief that truly relieves."
[time=2078] And we move from the emotions then to the intellect.
[time=2083] And in the intellect we begin to be deceived. Though bright people, we make dumb decisions intellectually.
[time=2089] We say in light of the lust and desire, "Oh, huh."
[time=2097] You know, maybe that's true. Maybe I will go that way. Maybe I will step in.
[time=2103] And from the emotion and the intellect then goes to the will. And guess what?
[time=2109] Choices get made. Real life choices that affect real life people and futures.
[time=2114] And we move from the emotion to the intellect to the will and decisions are made and sin takes place.
[time=2121] Sin that you can't ever get back. Sin that you can't rewind.
[time=2128] And there lust has run its course. Lust has done its deal. Warren Wiersby describes it this way.
[time=2134] He says, "James changes the picture from hunting and fishing to the birth of a baby.
[time=2141] Lust conceives a plan, lust conceives a method for taking the bait.
[time=2147] The will approves and acts and the result of that act is sin.
[time=2153] Whether we feel it or not, we're hooked. We're trapped. The baby is born and just wait until it grows up."
[time=2162] End quote.
[time=2165] Please people, this morning please do your very best. I'll do my best here to be as clear as I can.
[time=2171] Do your very best to understand this. Life lived in relationship with Christ.
[time=2178] Christian living, biblical living, however you want to say it, is a matter of the will, not the emotions, not the feelings.
[time=2189] It is a series, Christian living. It is a series of choices based solely on our willingness to submit to God's Word
[time=2198] and carried out in God's strength, strength given to those willing to choose.
[time=2205] Does that make sense? So many times I find myself and you find yourself over here kind of weighing this thing out.
[time=2213] And so many times I hear people say, "Where's the power?
[time=2217] Where's the spirit of God and this power that's supposed to take me and allow me to begin to reveal their bad theology?"
[time=2225] Because it never says it's going to be that way. He says he will give us strength. He says he will give us power.
[time=2231] But he also says he's not into a bunch of robots. You and I have to make choices.
[time=2238] Now we are prompted, it says, by the Holy Spirit. And we have in mind and in heart maybe a view of what obedience looks like,
[time=2245] but people, we have to get up and go there. We have to make decisions based on the Word of God.
[time=2253] And when making those decisions then, having made that decision, we get empowered. We get strengthened. The Spirit of God comes alongside
[time=2261] and sustains us and holds us. But it's not something that just happens.
[time=2267] No, you and I have to make daily decisions, willful choices based on truth to do the right thing.
[time=2275] Having done that, we are empowered. We are strengthened.
[time=2281] Verse 16, he wraps up this passage and just says plainly, "Hey folks, don't be deceived."
[time=2289] The enemy is a deceiver. He is the greatest deceiver of all. Don't be deceived. Don't take the hook. Don't walk into the trap.
[time=2297] It's what he's saying there. "Don't by the lie. Don't take the bait. Don't be fools. You will lose."
[time=2307] And the greatness of his folly, he will go astray.
[time=2314] Now just to reiterate the loss, the loss and the pain and the destruction tied to lust, look with me at what Proverbs has to say.
[time=2325] Proverbs 5, we're going to look at a few things. We could spend an hour and not get halfway through.
[time=2332] Some of the things that I saw this week that would fall into that category of lessons learned.
[time=2336] I want to show you two. Proverbs 5, Proverbs 5, we're going to start at verse 7.
[time=2347] Proverbs 5, 7, lessons learned from lust. Let's jump in here.
[time=2351] It says there in verse 7, "Now then my son listened to me and do not depart from the words of my mouth.
[time=2357] Keep your way far from her and do not go near the door of her house
[time=2363] lest you give your vigor to others and your years to the cruel one.
[time=2367] Less strangers be filled with your strength and your hard-earned goods go to the house of an alien.
[time=2373] And you groan at your latter end when your flesh and your body are consumed. And you say how?
[time=2379] How I have hated instruction and my heart spurned reproof.
[time=2383] And I have not listened to the voice of my teachers nor inclined my ear to my instructors."
[time=2392] Couple of things to point out from this passage.
[time=2395] Number one, go back to verse 8. On the very practical side, okay? On the very highly practical side, look at verse 8.
[time=2403] Keep your way far from her and do not go near the door of her house.
[time=2409] Now, literally speaking, literally, okay? Again, in Proverbs we're talking to a young man and the seduction and the temptation of the harlot.
[time=2419] Sexual immorality. And he is saying, "We can look at this literally and we should." And it's a good word.
[time=2425] He says to him, "Stay away from her door. Stay away from her house. Stay away from her. Literally stay away from her."
[time=2434] Figuratively. Figuratively speaking.
[time=2439] For you and for myself as we think this through, there are great implications as well.
[time=2445] Not different though. The message figuratively speaking is the same people. Stay away. Stay away.
[time=2455] It's right there in front of you. You know it and I know it.
[time=2459] Stay away. Keep your way far from her. Don't go near the door of her house.
[time=2465] And yes, there is a role that God plays in this as we make choices. He strengthens. He comes alongside.
[time=2471] But there is a role that we play and the role that we play, the choice that we make is to stay away.
[time=2478] What do I mean by stay away in the figurative sense, in the highly practical sense? I'll give you a few.
[time=2484] Number one, tell a friend. Tell a friend, get real brave and bold and courageous and honest and tell a spouse.
[time=2490] But tell somebody that you trust. Someone you know loves you. Someone you know is committed to you.
[time=2497] Tell somebody everything, everything that's going on in your life today in this arena.
[time=2506] Tell them everything. Suffer the humiliation. Be embarrassed.
[time=2512] But cry out for help. Tell someone that you know, trust and love. Tell them everything.
[time=2518] Tell them what your hook looks like. Tell them when it comes. Tell them where it comes from and tell them what you've been doing with it.
[time=2526] Tell them what you've been doing. Tell them what you've been doing with it.
[time=2663] As far as it depends on you, if you need to take action, take it.
[time=2667] There's too much on the line. Too much on the line.
[time=2671] Go to verse 11, 12 and 13, a second thing to draw from this Proverbs 5 passage. It says there in 11, and you've grown at your latter end. When your flesh and your body are consumed and you say how I have hated instruction, and my heart spurned reproof, and I have not listened to the voice of my teachers nor inclined my ear to my instructors. What's he saying?
[time=2695] He's saying listen carefully, listen honestly to those that teach you or attempt to teach you wisdom.
[time=2703] And I'll just say this today for whatever reason in God's point in design, I get to be your teacher.
[time=2711] And so I am trying as best I can, and I will say it one more time to you in an attempt to teach you and remind you of wisdom.
[time=2719] Stay away from her door.
[time=2723] Do not go near her house.
[time=2727] Begging you to stay away.
[time=2731] To ask for help. To tell your good friend everything.
[time=2735] To get aggressive in your fight. To consider the consequences, but watch this.
[time=2739] Almost more than those things.
[time=2743] I want to say those things, and I've said them so there, but I also want to say this to you.
[time=2747] This really forms the foundation of those kinds of efforts.
[time=2750] Deepen, deepen, deepen your love for God.
[time=2753] Do what you can.
[time=2757] Seek the help that you can seek.
[time=2759] Allow us to encourage you to deepen your love for God 'cause watch.
[time=2764] Deepen your love for God, talk to him more.
[time=2767] Listen to him more, read him more, study him more, sing him more, memorize him more, serve him more.
[time=2775] Saturate yourself with him more.
[time=2778] Deepen your love for him and your heart gets what?
[time=2780] Your heart gets bigger and your heart gets stronger and your heart gets softer and your heart, where all this stuff starts, gets set on him.
[time=2791] When you and I give ourselves to those kinds of things and when our hearts are set on him, guess what?
[time=2799] We have a chance then, we've got more than a chance.
[time=2803] We have the spirit of God and the word of God and the person of God and the people of God around us and we can endure when the trial comes, when the temptation comes.
[time=2814] We can endure, we can love God.
[time=2818] God can be the choice.
[time=2819] Faithfulness to loved ones can be the choice.
[time=2823] Perseverance can be the choice.
[time=2825] One more thing from Proverbs.
[time=2830] Another lesson learned, next chapter, chapter six, go to verse 25.
[time=2836] Another lesson learned from Proverbs, chapter six, verses 25 to 29, and then we're gonna jump over to 32 and 33.
[time=2844] Chapter six, verse 25, it says this.
[time=2848] "Do not desire her beauty in your heart, "nor let her catch you with her eyelids.
[time=2855] "For on account of a harlot, "one is reduced to a loaf of bread, "and an adulterous hunts for the precious life.
[time=2863] "Can a man take fire in his bosom "and his clothes not be burned, "or can a man walk on hot coals "and his feet not be scorched?
[time=2871] "So is the one who goes into his neighbor's wife, "who ever touches her will not go unpunished." Verse 32, the one who commits adultery with a woman is lacking sense.
[time=2886] He would destroy himself.
[time=2888] He who would destroy himself does it.
[time=2890] Verse 33, wounds and disgrace, he will find.
[time=2894] Here you go, and his reproach will not be blotted out.
[time=2899] You think, "Hoon, what's that mean?" Well, I'll tell you what it doesn't mean.
[time=2907] What it doesn't mean, that is not a verse that talks about that man or woman losing their salvation.
[time=2914] Or committing a sin that just can't be forgiven.
[time=2918] It's not what that says.
[time=2920] But I'll tell you what it does say, and it's hard for me to say this because I wanna say it with grace, and I wanna say it with hope, but I wanna say it 'cause it's true, 'cause God's Word says it's true.
[time=2933] Two things, number one, those first verses we read, the hot coals and bringing fire to, you know what, there are immediate consequences to lust.
[time=2944] There are immediate consequences.
[time=2947] You will get burned.
[time=2948] You cannot hold it to yourself and not be affected.
[time=2953] Immediate, you will get burned.
[time=2955] Your feet will get scorched.
[time=2957] Sin will find you out.
[time=2959] And it might be a week, it might be a month, but it's immediate in the sense of the bigger picture.
[time=2964] You can't get away from that.
[time=2966] Proverbs 6 shows us there are immediate consequences.
[time=2969] The last few verses I read there though, those are the hard ones because you know what?
[time=2974] Where it says there in verse 33, and his approach will not be blotted out.
[time=2979] You know what that means?
[time=2980] That means that though you would or I would repent from that sin, though we would seek the forgiveness that we would need to seek from God and from our wife or our husband and our family and our friends, and though that forgiveness might even be granted.
[time=2997] And we might again someday walk in kind of a healthy deal, having been forgiven with new hope and new direction.
[time=3003] Guess what?
[time=3005] It's still there.
[time=3007] It happened.
[time=3008] And these things and the implications of these choices
[time=3014] and the things that get dented and the stuff that gets dinged and it doesn't go away.
[time=3020] The shame of the choice is still there.
[time=3025] And again, like I said last week, thank God that his grace and his mercy and his strength are such that it can hold us up in the midst of feeling and living those things, but you know what?
[time=3035] They're there.
[time=3035] And it doesn't get blotted out.
[time=3040] And we do remember.
[time=3042] And there are consequences for our choices.
[time=3045] I wanna close our time with something a little different,
[time=3052] but I just thought maybe it would help communicate.
[time=3056] And maybe deepen even the impact of what we've considered.
[time=3061] You know, ever since I was 17 years old, many of you know that I went through my mom and dad's marriage coming to an end due to things like this.
[time=3074] And at age 17, it was extremely difficult for me and it's been a lot of years since then.
[time=3078] And God's done a wonderful thing in my heart.
[time=3081] And even in my dad's heart as of late, we've got a relationship today that I'm really thankful for.
[time=3087] We're working on it.
[time=3088] But you know what?
[time=3089] Ever since I was 17, I don't know what triggered it then.
[time=3093] And I know how it kind of continued.
[time=3095] But I started, I'd read something in a magazine about this stuff and I cut it out and I'd keep it and I'd start this little file.
[time=3103] Then I got a little bit older and I started getting letters from other kids.
[time=3107] I'd speak at a camp and I'd get a note or I'd speak at a church and a family would write.
[time=3111] And ever since 1980, I've kept letters.
[time=3114] Not to harbor anything and not to dwell on anything, but to remind me of what happens when those choices get made.
[time=3125] And so I got this file and I still have it and here it is, you know, almost 20 years later.
[time=3129] And I just pulled out a few.
[time=3131] And we took some excerpts out of the letters.
[time=3135] And this morning, some of our kids and some of our adults are gonna read it.
[time=3140] It's excerpts, it's not their story.
[time=3142] They're relaying to you excerpts from real life stories, things that really happened.
[time=3148] And again, we do it this morning to remind us, this is enough, I realize that.
[time=3152] And I hope you've listened.
[time=3153] But listen here as well and hear the true stories of what choices like that lead to.
[time=3158] Then Denise is gonna come and sing a song that I hope you'll listen to as well.
[time=3162] I hope you'll consider its message and its truth.
[time=3165] And then I'll come back up and we'll close.
[time=3167] - My dad said he wasn't happy anymore.
[time=3177] He still seems really sad.
[time=3179] My mom and sisters and me haven't been happy since you left.
[time=3183] Now we're all sad.
[time=3185] - I lost my virginity last week.
[time=3192] It was really weird, you know.
[time=3194] I can't believe my mom left for 15 minutes of that.
[time=3197] Even though the resentment and anger are still there,
[time=3205] I do feel sorry at times as I watch his life fall apart.
[time=3209] 10 years later and he's nearly broke, rarely sober and almost friendless.
[time=3214] He really was convinced it was going to be a better life.
[time=3217] - God will forgive him and I will too.
[time=3225] I just wish he'd ask.
[time=3227] - Now I change diapers, walk my little brother to school,
[time=3235] and sometimes make hot dogs for dinner.
[time=3237] I wish my mom would come back.
[time=3239] I'd still do her jobs, just be nice to have her home.
[time=3241] - I'm sorry, but I doubted from the beginning
[time=3248] if everything they tried to teach me was true.
[time=3251] And now I know it isn't.
[time=3253] The Lord can't meet all of your needs.
[time=3255] He doesn't have a good plan for all our lives and he definitely cannot be trusted.
[time=3259] My dad's choices have proven that to me once and for all.
[time=3265] (gentle piano music) [MUSIC - 160 seconds]
[time=3432] Let's pray, Father, maybe it's just best for us to simply say as a family and as individuals, God give us the strength to make good choices.
[time=3441] Help us to see things as they really are.
[time=3445] Help us to understand the lie of the enemy and help us God to hold on to what is right.
[time=3451] Help us to hold on to each other in the midst of that.
[time=3453] God, it's a lonely, lonely place to be.
[time=3456] To fight those battles and God, I pray, we would be the church to each other.
[time=3461] We would listen and that we would encourage.
[time=3463] We would help however we can.
[time=3466] But God, more than anything we know as a family and as individuals that we need you.
[time=3471] And this morning, there are many of us in the room that have you, that live in relationship with you.
[time=3477] And even though we face these ugly battles, God, we have hope.
[time=3481] At the same time, we know that there may be some in the room this morning that don't have that hope that fight these battles and lose.
[time=3487] And they are so tired of losing and they are so tired of the hopelessness of the fight.
[time=3492] And so God, our prayer would be that they would feel welcome,
[time=3498] that they would feel free, that they would feel at ease here with us admitting their condition and maybe even wanting to talk about it.
[time=3506] Maybe even wanting to consider more what it would mean to know you, to live in relationship with you and to end that God, be able to face life in a way that works.
[time=3517] So God, work in our hearts this morning.
[time=3519] Encourage those that leave knowing you and maybe those that don't know you.
[time=3523] Bring them down here to the front, let us talk, let us understand better the world they live in and allow us to form a friendship that might encourage them.
[time=3532] Thank you for the morning and thank you for your work and all the people agreed and said amen.
