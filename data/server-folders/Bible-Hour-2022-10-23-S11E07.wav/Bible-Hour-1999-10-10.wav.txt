[time=93] Welcome to the Sunday Morning Worship Service of Black Hawk Baptist Church. Thank you for joining us.
[time=98] We trust that the music and message from God's Word will help you in your Christian walk.
[time=103] Now let's join our service.
[time=105] [MUSIC - 2353 seconds]
[time=2480] You're angry. And then remember this, number three. I have a choice to make. I'm angry. I know where that can go. And right now, in this moment, I have a choice to make. Be aware. Be aware of our choices. And it's a choice that, and I talk with folks, and I hear myself talk. And there are so many times, people, when you and I, to listen to us talk, you know what's, it's as if we don't have a choice.
[time=2509] It's as if we don't have a choice. It's as if we're just controlled by the stuff. It's as if we have no shot at all. It's just too powerful. It's just too great. It just runs too deep. It's just who I am. But God's Word tells us an experience, I think, shows you and I, that we have choices that we can make. We have the capacity. It is possible. We don't have to sin with our anger.
[time=2538] Back to Proverbs 1632. We can choose. You can choose, and I can choose, to rule with God's help and the Spirit of God working in and through us. We can choose to rule our Spirit with a spilled glass of milk, with a forgotten anniversary, with an interrupting child,
[time=2564] with a spouse that makes us late. Whatever it is, you can choose, and I can choose, choices can be made for the Spirit to be ruled, and anger to be dealt with constructively. We can, in a moment, think about this.
[time=2582] Go ahead and paint your own picture. Go ahead and set the stage in your own mind right now of the most recent time when you experienced anger, the most recent time where maybe you didn't even handle it well,
[time=2593] where you went over the line. You said what shouldn't have been said. You did what shouldn't have been done. Go ahead and reconstruct that right now in your mind's eye.
[time=2604] I just did. So now we're all there together. And realize this together. Let's just realize the facts. We can in a moment's time.
[time=2614] Before any of that stuff gets done, we can scroll through in our minds appropriate scriptures that remind us of what it should look like.
[time=2624] We can in a moment's time pray a brief yet powerful prayer stating our hearts true desire begging for help from the Spirit of God, the person of God.
[time=2636] But maybe most importantly, and I loved it when I found this this week, we can in a moment's time listen.
[time=2643] It's a powerful thing. It's a powerful tool. I'm just starting to understand it in my own life, in my own walk and relationship with God.
[time=2651] We can listen. You can in a moment's time listen to what the Spirit of God would say.
[time=2661] We can be reminded. We can be convicted. We can be prompted. He says things to our souls that can make a difference.
[time=2669] And what does it say in James 1? James 1 19 says, "Let everyone be quick to hear." This you know, my beloved brethren.
[time=2678] Let everyone be quick to hear, slow to speak, and then slow to anger.
[time=2687] How willing are you in the midst of whatever circumstance you may be thinking through right now as we picture this angry moment?
[time=2694] How willing are you to stop and listen?
[time=2699] The next time anger rears its head. Let's say you've caught it early.
[time=2704] No one's been yelled at yet. No one's been embarrassed. No one's been hit.
[time=2711] Listen. Listen to what the Holy Spirit is saying to you. You will be amazed at what will come to mind.
[time=2718] You will be amazed and thankful at the work He really does in your life and mind when we say, wait, time out, stop.
[time=2726] Listen. Happened to me just a few weeks ago.
[time=2734] And you can tell from my other examples this morning that I don't always handle this well.
[time=2742] But this time something decent happened. This time I was thankful for how it kind of played out.
[time=2748] Thankful for the things I'd been learning about my own anger and the things that God's Word have been teaching me.
[time=2753] An individual came. It was down here in front a couple, about a month ago.
[time=2761] And we were just getting ready for a service. And this individual came down and kind of just walked right up to me.
[time=2768] And just lit into me. Just both barrels just pulled the trigger and lit into me about, I think it was the music that was playing at the moment.
[time=2779] And this individual looked me in the eye and said, I know you're responsible for this and I want you to know how ridiculous this is.
[time=2787] I want you to know how offended I am. This reminds me of a nightclub. This reminds me of a bar.
[time=2795] And I know you're the one that's responsible.
[time=2804] So I got two options. I got my quick to speak option, which I was really wanting to go towards.
[time=2810] And then you got your slow to speak option.
[time=2814] And so my quick to speak, I mean I could feel it running through my veins.
[time=2821] You know, my quick to speak is I wanted to just kind of take them by the arm.
[time=2826] Or I guess that's the ear, sorry.
[time=2828] I wanted to just take them and say, who died and made your preference king?
[time=2834] Who died and made your preference the one that we should all bow down in worship?
[time=2839] And I could feel a sarcasm welling up, I'm thinking these things.
[time=2843] Speaking of bars, I wanted to say, I wanted to take this individual and march this individual back about five rows,
[time=2850] where there was a couple seated who about four months earlier had left the bar scene
[time=2856] to come and be a part of our church, because we played certain kinds of music sometimes, not all the time.
[time=2866] All this stuff running through my veins, I was appalled at the lack of perspective hurt by the attack on something
[time=2872] we'd worked so hard to give to our family.
[time=2875] And the first thing that actually did come out of my mouth was this, I said, what did you say?
[time=2881] And I think this individual thought because it was so noisy, I didn't hear him.
[time=2886] But I knew differently, I knew that I had started right there with those words to go down the wrong road.
[time=2892] And I said, what did you say? And so the individual began to repeat it all.
[time=2897] And so as it's getting all repeated back, the Holy Spirit began to remind me of some very important truths.
[time=2904] And while the individual repeated the spiel, I wasn't hearing the spiel, I was listening to the spirit of God say things to me like, Kelly, be careful.
[time=2915] Be careful.
[time=2917] The careless word can damage and wound.
[time=2920] Be careful, Kelly.
[time=2922] This person matters to God.
[time=2925] All of a sudden, the little song from Sunday schools running through my mind, red and yellow, black and white, even angry, they are precious in his sight.
[time=2935] Be careful.
[time=2936] This person is precious.
[time=2938] You never looked in the eyes, Kelly, of one that Christ didn't give his life for, which means this person's a treasure.
[time=2946] They're a treasure.
[time=2948] And then just before the spiel was concluded, one last thing dawns on me.
[time=2953] I look at this individual and it dawns on me, this person must really miss what used to be.
[time=2962] And I've got, I've got, I've got grandparents and I've got aunts and uncles and I've got friends and I know I hear them talk about that.
[time=2969] And when I hear them talk about it in other contexts, you know, my heart kind of breaks.
[time=2973] Somehow in this context, somehow that gets distorted and I forget.
[time=2978] And the spirit of God reminded me in that moment, you know what?
[time=2982] This person must really, really miss what used to be, how hard that must be.
[time=2988] So they finished and all I could say was thanks.
[time=2993] Try my best to just say thanks, thanks for sharing the concern, thanks for hanging in there in the midst of all the change.
[time=2999] And then I invited this person to give me a call and see if we could spend some more time together to talk about it.
[time=3007] You see, whether it's an angry church member, an insensitive spouse or a disobedient child, we don't have to sin.
[time=3015] We don't have to violate others and our God with our anger.
[time=3022] Be aware this morning, people of your wiring.
[time=3025] Be aware of how you work.
[time=3026] Be aware of anger's presence when it's there and call it what it is and call it that early.
[time=3034] Be aware of the choices that you can make.
[time=3037] And I was thinking about it this week.
[time=3039] You know what?
[time=3040] Also, I'll just add this.
[time=3041] Anticipate.
[time=3042] Sometimes if you just hear the way I said that, it's almost as if we kind of have to wait for it to happen.
[time=3047] You know what?
[time=3048] Let's be wise about this.
[time=3050] Anticipate.
[time=3051] It's a rival.
[time=3052] It's going to happen.
[time=3054] You're going to be faced with anger and your choices this week.
[time=3059] So pray.
[time=3061] Pray this week. Pray today. Pray on your way home. Pray tonight. God, I struggle with anger.
[time=3067] And yet I want so desperately to honor you and others.
[time=3072] I know situations will come today and I need your spirit, God, to remind me and convict me.
[time=3077] Please bring the kind and appropriate responses to mind and give me the courage, God, to rule my spirit.
[time=3088] Pray that. Think that. Pray it in your own words.
[time=3091] But anticipate it. It's going to happen.
[time=3094] Be aware of your wiring. Be aware of its presence.
[time=3098] And pray for strength and guidance to make the right choices.
[time=3102] And be reminded of this with regard to our family here at Black Hawk.
[time=3106] The enemy. The enemy would love nothing more.
[time=3109] The enemy would love nothing more than to see this place become more and more so a place full of angry people.
[time=3117] Barriers or spurs. Either way he'd be fine with it.
[time=3122] Because he knows that the one surefire way to deter and detract from what God wants to do in this community through this family.
[time=3132] The one surefire way to diminish that is to get you angry at me.
[time=3137] To get me angry at you. For us to be angry at each other and not willing to stop.
[time=3144] So angry that we violate each other. So angry we say and do things we shouldn't do and say.
[time=3151] So be reminded today that this is one of the hotbeds and he will do amazing things to try and get you and I to ruin what God's doing here through angry hearts that get demanding and isolated and bitter.
[time=3167] Please give it some thought. Please go back through these things we've read this morning.
[time=3173] Remind yourself of what Proverbs says. Remind yourself of what it says in Ephesians 4.
[time=3178] And let me just add this and we'll close.
[time=3182] Most of what we talked about today kind of has to do with you and I dealing with our anger and what we do with it.
[time=3189] How we manage it.
[time=3191] Understand too that you and I find ourselves in situations all the time.
[time=3196] When the choices about the anger are being made by others and they're not choosing well and we find ourselves being the recipient of the anger.
[time=3206] What to do? What's your response to be?
[time=3210] We've talked about our response with regard to our own anger and how we manage it.
[time=3214] What about when someone else isn't managing theirs well?
[time=3218] And you and I are the recipients of that.
[time=3221] I just wanted to give you a couple things to keep in mind. Okay, first Peter. First Peter chapter 2.
[time=3228] Turn to first Peter chapter 2 verses 22, 21, 22, and 23. It says this.
[time=3241] For you have been called. First Peter chapter 2. For you have been called for this purpose.
[time=3247] Since Christ also suffered for you leaving you an example for you to follow in his steps who committed no sin, nor was any deceit found in his mouth.
[time=3258] And while being reviled, while being mistreated, while being the recipient of an anger that you and I have not yet or nor ever will see.
[time=3270] While being reviled, he did not revile in return. While suffering, he uttered no threats, but kept entrusting himself to him who judges righteously.
[time=3284] If there was ever anyone on the face of this earth in all of history who had the right to revile back, to spew back, it was him.
[time=3294] But what did he do? He left us an example, it says. One of the few times it says that in the New Testament, he left us an example.
[time=3301] And what was the example? Keep your mouth shut. Back to the Thumper rule in Bambi. If you can't say something nice, keep it closed.
[time=3312] He didn't revile. And then I love this one. Simple, plain, true, and powerful as it always is in this great book we're studying. Proverbs 15-1.
[time=3323] Proverbs 15-1. Don't ever forget this people. A gentle answer turns away wrath.
[time=3332] You know it. You've seen it. You've experienced it. I know it. I've experienced it. We've been there. And we know a gentle answer.
[time=3340] It has an amazing way of turning away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.
[time=3349] It's my prayer, and I hope your prayer that as individuals and as a family that we would think about, give some thought today to this issue of your anger in mind.
[time=3360] How well are you doing in managing it well with wisdom? And where you find yourself falling short, where you find yourself being prone to the violations.
[time=3370] And again, I want to say this to you. Talk about that with somebody. Talk about that with a friend. Talk about that with someone in your small group.
[time=3379] Talk about that with a good friend or two in your ABF. Talk about that with a pastor. Talk about it with your deacon. Talk about it with somebody.
[time=3386] Ask them to pray for you. Ask them to give you encouragement. Ask them or those that you share your life with to kind of pull their resources of prayer and encouragement and things they've seen or read or heard.
[time=3401] I mean, just do whatever you can do to say I've got a problem in this area. If you need some help that might go beyond a small group, if you want to talk to somebody, a professional biblical counselor, let us know. Let us help.
[time=3413] But don't let anger and the mass of destruction that it brings continue to bruise and damage and destroy hearts and lives around you.
[time=3425] Give it some thought. Let me invite you to stand. Let's close this morning in a word of prayer. Father, again, we come to you thankful that the word of God speaks to the issues that it does, God you.
[time=3442] You know where we live. You know how we live. You know the things that we struggle with. You know what's difficult. You know our weaknesses.
[time=3449] And this morning, God, I'm sure that you've touched on many. I know you have in my own heart and life. And God, we pray this morning that you would help us.
[time=3460] I sense in a room like this, with the things going on in all of our lives, the things that happen, the things that we've lived with, the people that we've lived under, the things that we've experienced.
[time=3475] God, there might be many here this morning that struggle deeply and desperately with anger. And God, I pray that you would give each of them, each of us, that struggle with that God, a spirit of courage and honesty.
[time=3494] God, help us to go and seek out those we need to seek out. Help us to ask the questions that need to be asked. Ask for the assistance that is willing to be given.
[time=3504] God, I pray that we would respond in ways that honor you and honor others. Thank you for the chance to be together. Thank you for the privilege of worship.
[time=3514] And God be with us as we go. We have no idea what lies ahead. And the remainder of this day or in the coming days or the coming week. But our prayer God is that you would prepare us to meet it and face it in a way that would honor you.
