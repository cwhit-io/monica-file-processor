[time=49] Welcome to the Sunday Morning Worship Service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=53] Thank you for joining us. We trust that the music and message from God's word will help you in your Christian walk.
[time=59] Now let's join our service.
[time=61] [MUSIC - 14 seconds]
[time=82] Hi, my name is Renee Loser, and I would love for you to know how thankful I am for my Uncle Jack and Aunt Janet.
[time=91] Well, we tried to share our faith with Renee about salvation before taking contagious Christianity,
[time=97] but she seemed close to what we had to say, so I just continued to pray for her.
[time=102] We even questioned our ability to witness effectively to anyone, so that's why we decided to take the class.
[time=109] I always took a lot of phone calls from Renee, and sometimes they were tearful and tried to be a wonderful listener
[time=117] and give her spiritual advice. She always didn't take it, and I was like in shock.
[time=123] When I got the call and she says, "I am Janet. I really need to start going to church again." And she says, "And I got a letter of Mimi, which was Jack's mom." And she says, "I need to be reborn." From reading Mimi's letter, I called Aunt Janet with this need that I had to become reborn.
[time=143] And the letter says, "My dear, you have been traveling the wrong road, and will need to turn around and get on the right one.
[time=152] I know it may not seem as glamorous as the wrong road, but then Jesus never promised us a rose garden.
[time=159] She wrote on to tell me, "You have to die twice to live an eternal life with God in heaven."
[time=166] She stated the first time would be painful, and the second time would be glorious.
[time=173] And that led me to continually thinking that night that I needed to call Jack and Janet.
[time=180] And so we hung up the phone, and I said, "Jack, grab your Bible. Renee wants to get saved."
[time=187] And as I was sitting with Kelly, I was asking him questions and getting answers.
[time=192] Answers that had never made sense until that night.
[time=196] And I asked Kelly, "Well, how do I get faith?" And he stopped, and he silently prayed, and I could tell that's what he was doing.
[time=205] And he said, "It's just yours for the asking." And I'm like, "Huh? You mean all I have to do is just ask for faith, and I get it?"
[time=214] And he was, "Yes, but you also need to ask to have Jesus come into your heart and follow the teachings of God.
[time=222] Admit that you're a sinner, and ask for his forgiveness, and then all of your sins, past, present, and future are freed."
[time=230] And I was at peace.
[time=233] At peace. I felt loved. I loved myself. I talked and prayed to God about everything.
[time=243] My life with God now is unbelievable.
[time=248] Every day I shake my head.
[time=251] Sometimes I just let out a little giggle from knowing he is there.
[time=255] She's so happy now, and has such a radiant smile. She just glows.
[time=260] God has produced a joy in her heart because she truly desires to honor him and all that she does.
[time=267] And this year she will be singing in the Living Christmas Tree and using it as an outreach to some of her unsafe friends.
[time=276] I just thank the Lord for that.
[time=278] Someday she may even come down and touch the ground again.
[time=290] Hey, I want that car back by 11. Yes, I said 11, and be careful out there.
[time=298] It's really icy on those turns.
[time=301] And remember to pump your brakes. You don't want to skid them to the person in front of you.
[time=307] Again.
[time=309] You know, 16 years ago, I thought changing as diapers was a challenge.
[time=319] Now when I think about that kid behind the wheel of a car, knowing he's got an adult-sized responsibility directed by a teenage-sized brain,
[time=328] I want to trust him. I want to think the best of him.
[time=333] But he's the one who had the accident, $1,200.
[time=338] At least no one was hurt.
[time=341] But it was so stupid. I don't know how many times I've told him, don't follow so closely.
[time=347] But he won't listen to me. Everything I say is a call for debate.
[time=351] What do you mean, Dad? The world is round. Can you prove it?
[time=355] He doesn't trust my advice. I don't trust his actions.
[time=361] Hey, how about that? We do have something in common.
[time=365] My wife, on the other hand, she thinks I'm too hard on him.
[time=372] Well, that might be true some of the time, but not all of the time.
[time=376] Besides, her father wasn't even there for her.
[time=379] I don't know how she can claim to be such an expert.
[time=382] Compared to that, man, I'm a regular Ward Cleaver.
[time=385] We both learned what we're not supposed to do thanks to her, folks.
[time=390] I think we're doing a pretty good job raising our kids.
[time=395] Despite all that my wife and I are going through, don't get me wrong. It's nothing major.
[time=403] Every marriage goes through a stage where one person isn't making the other person as happy as he thought he used to.
[time=411] But I'm trying.
[time=413] Meanwhile, my wife's got her nose buried in another one of those new psychology books which she insists that I read too.
[time=421] I try to stay open, but I'm not exactly excited about all these changes that are going on in our marriage.
[time=428] I got married to settle down, as we used to say.
[time=433] My marriage isn't exactly doing anything to help me settle down.
[time=437] To be honest, it feels like somebody died.
[time=445] Only I haven't been to any funerals.
[time=448] It's like everybody moved away.
[time=451] Only they're all still here. It just doesn't feel like it.
[time=454] My wife says I'm not meeting her needs.
[time=458] What about my needs?
[time=460] What does she call embarrassing me in front of everyone at the office Christmas party by telling them about the time that I...
[time=467] Well, that is the last time I tell her anything in confidence.
[time=473] You know, fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.
[time=478] She wants me to start meeting her needs.
[time=480] Well, she better start meeting mine.
[time=482] I take enough from the kids and from work. I don't need it from her.
[time=489] Look, I'm trying.
[time=492] But I got a son who won't listen to me.
[time=495] A wife who broadcasts my personal life to anyone who will listen.
[time=500] I got friends who seem to like me for what I can do for them.
[time=505] It's like I don't relate to anybody, you know?
[time=508] Well, sure, you know, because you're all playing the same game too.
[time=512] You're being used, yeah, you, and you're using other people.
[time=517] Oh, I know. We use fancy labels to cover it up like business relationships, friendships, marriage.
[time=526] And I know I'm not the only one who sees how dark our hearts are.
[time=531] How can we trust anybody, huh?
[time=533] You know, I can just hear my wife saying, "Don't be so cynical."
[time=539] Yeah, she's probably right.
[time=542] I'm just trying to be honest.
[time=547] I don't trust my son.
[time=549] I'm trying to trust my wife, my friends.
[time=555] I don't know if I can trust anybody.
[time=559] I don't even know if I can trust God, but that's a whole other subject.
[time=566] I think, anyway, that's how I see it.
[time=577] â™ª
[time=603] The new way of looking at life was tired of his job of his kids and his wife
[time=613] says the secret to his success wasn't leaving and finding himself.
[time=621] Now, he's someone to somebody else.
[time=625] You say we've risen to a new age of truth.
[time=630] You're calling it a spiritual godly pursuit.
[time=635] But I say, I say, I say, what if we've fallen to a bottom of the well?
[time=646] Think can we risen to the top of a mountain?
[time=651] And what if we're knocking at the gates of hell?
[time=658] Think can that we're having fun?
[time=663] What if we spend our lives thinking of ourselves?
[time=669] Or we should have been thinking of each other?
[time=674] What if we reach up and touch the ground?
[time=678] To fight, we live in life, outside life.
[time=692] We've got a program for saving the earth.
[time=700] While unborn children are denied the right to birth.
[time=706] One baby's blessed, another cursed.
[time=710] Have we made this world better or worse?
[time=715] We live in life of a tree comes first.
[time=720] You say we've risen to a new age of light.
[time=725] You're telling me what used to be wrong.
[time=730] It's now right.
[time=732] But I say, I say, what if we've fallen to the bottom of a well?
[time=738] Think can we risen to the top of a mountain?
[time=745] What if we're knocking at the gates of hell?
[time=750] Think can that we're having fun?
[time=755] What if we spend our lives thinking of ourselves?
[time=761] We should have been thinking of each other?
[time=766] What if we reach up and touch the ground?
[time=771] To fight, we live in life, outside life.
[time=777] Outside, outside.
[time=783] To fight, we live in life, outside life.
[time=791] What if we reach up and touch the bottom of a well?
[time=799] Think can we risen to the top of a mountain?
[time=804] What if we're knocking at the gates of hell?
[time=809] Think can that we're having fun?
[time=813] What if we spend our lives thinking of ourselves?
[time=820] We should have been thinking of each other?
[time=826] What if we reach up and touch the ground?
[time=829] To fight, we live in life, outside, outside life.
[time=837] Outside, outside, outside life.
[time=843] What if we're living, what if we're living?
[time=852] What if we're living, outside, out?
[time=857] What if we're living, what if we're living?
[time=862] What if we're living, outside, out?
[time=867] What if we're living, what if we're living?
[time=873] What if we're living, outside, out?
[time=883] What a great, great morning so far.
[time=887] And again, it's great to have all of you here.
[time=891] We have over the last seven weeks been doing our very best to raise the flag, if you will, to kind of beat the drum and proclaim clearly in no uncertain terms the value.
[time=904] The life-changing, life-altering value of wisdom.
[time=911] And this morning we get one more opportunity, one more chance to consider our need for wisdom and to be reminded, to be reminded, you and I, to be reminded that in this walk
[time=922] through life, this life that you're walking through, this life that I'm walking through, this life that we walk through together, there is so very much at stake.
[time=933] There's a lot at stake, there's a lot at stake daily.
[time=937] And I was reminded of that as I read through a story that got handed to me last week, and it goes like this, it's called the carpenter.
[time=944] It says an elderly carpenter was ready to retire.
[time=948] He told his employer, contractor of his plans to leave the house building business and live a more leisurely life with his wife enjoying his extended family.
[time=957] He would miss the paycheck, but he needed to retire.
[time=960] They could get by.
[time=961] The contractor was sorry to see his good worker go and asked if he could build just one more house as a personal favor.
[time=969] The carpenter said yes, but in time it was easy to see that his heart was not in his work.
[time=974] He resorted to shoddy workmanship and used inferior materials.
[time=978] It was an unfortunate way to end a dedicated career.
[time=982] When the carpenter finished his work, the employer came to inspect the house.
[time=986] He handed the front door key to the carpenter and said, "This is your house, my gift to you." The carpenter was shocked. What a shame.
[time=999] If he had only known he was building his own house, he would have done it all so differently, and so it is with us.
[time=1007] We build our lives at times foolishly, often putting less than our best into the building.
[time=1013] Then with a shock, we realize we have to live in the house we've built.
[time=1018] If we could do it over, we'd do it much differently, but we can't do it over.
[time=1022] We can't go back.
[time=1025] You're the carpenter. I'm the carpenter.
[time=1027] And each day, we hammer a nail, we place a board, we erect a wall.
[time=1032] Life is a do-it-yourself project, someone has said.
[time=1035] Your attitudes and choices, but you make today build the house you live in tomorrow.
[time=1040] So build wisely.
[time=1043] Work like you don't need the money.
[time=1045] Love like you've never been hurt, dance like nobody's watching.
[time=1051] Well said. Very true.
[time=1054] And we've been pleading with you.
[time=1057] We've been saying to this family here at Blackhawk for the last two months, pursue wisdom.
[time=1062] Stay away from self-serving folly.
[time=1064] Give yourself to wise living.
[time=1067] And at the same time, without really saying it, we've been saying some other things as well.
[time=1073] Without really saying it, what we've really been trying to say today is this, assess your current life direction.
[time=1082] Yeah, assess it. Give it some thought.
[time=1085] As you think back in the last seven weeks, we've really been saying, think about how you live.
[time=1091] Think about the direction and course your life is on.
[time=1095] Surface your values.
[time=1098] As you've listened to God's Word and wisdom being proclaimed, what has it done in your own heart?
[time=1104] What things has it brought to the surface about you and about what you really believe and what you really think?
[time=1110] The things that are really, really most important to you.
[time=1113] Assess your current life condition.
[time=1115] Surface your values.
[time=1117] Observe the pattern and posture of your heart.
[time=1123] Those are some of the questions we've really been asking.
[time=1126] And bottom line, we've seen our seven-week study challenging us and pointing us toward one foundational question.
[time=1132] And that one foundational question that sits at the base of all we've been saying is simply stated this.
[time=1138] What is the condition of your faith?
[time=1145] That's really the issue at stake, your faith.
[time=1147] What kind of shape is it in?
[time=1150] Where have you placed it?
[time=1152] And again, let's all be on the same page.
[time=1154] No matter what your religious spiritual church background, no matter who you are, how old you are, how young you are, no matter where you come from, what your life experience has been, all of us have faith and have placed it in something or someone.
[time=1173] And as we've asked and answered the questions from Proverbs, what have we assessed or learned?
[time=1179] What have you assessed?
[time=1180] What have I assessed and learned about our faith and its current state?
[time=1185] Now you might be asking, how do we get from faith?
[time=1187] How do we get from wisdom to faith?
[time=1189] Well, don't forget this.
[time=1191] Very important things to hang on to this morning especially.
[time=1193] Wise living.
[time=1195] Wise living, the kind of wise living described here in this book of Proverbs.
[time=1200] True biblical wisdom living is born out of true faith.
[time=1206] Don't forget that.
[time=1208] It's born out of true faith.
[time=1210] Someone can be sharp.
[time=1212] Someone can be bright.
[time=1214] Someone can be quick.
[time=1216] Someone can be clear minded.
[time=1219] But wise living, wisdom living, that is only born out of true faith.
[time=1225] The choice towards the wisdom of Proverbs comes out of a heart that has embraced faith.
[time=1231] Look at what it says in James.
[time=1233] Just again by way of introduction, look back at James chapter 1.
[time=1237] It says in James chapter 1, verses 5 and 6, it says this.
[time=1242] But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God who gives to all men generously and without reproach and it will be given to him.
[time=1251] But let him ask in what?
[time=1254] In faith.
[time=1255] Let him ask in faith.
[time=1258] It is true faith.
[time=1260] Hear it and do your best to be reminded of it this morning or maybe even for the first time understand this concept today.
[time=1268] Hear it please, true faith energizes wisdom living.
[time=1274] And so I want to ask us the question this morning, how is your faith these days?
[time=1280] Have you completely and wholeheartedly without doubt and hesitation or reservation responded to Proverbs 3, 5 and 6?
[time=1289] How is your faith this morning?
[time=1291] Have you responded to what this great passage says?
[time=1294] Let me read it to you, Proverbs 3, 5 and you know what, I'm going to go all the way through 8.
[time=1298] I think the screen is going to cut off at 6, but let me read to you 5, 6, 7, 8.
[time=1303] It says this, Proverbs 3 starting at verse 5, trust in the Lord.
[time=1307] Have you done this?
[time=1308] Does this mark the condition in state of your faith today?
[time=1312] Have you trusted in the Lord with all your heart?
[time=1316] And do not lean on your own understanding.
[time=1319] In all your ways are you acknowledging Him so that He can make your path straight.
[time=1325] Goes on in verse 7 to say this, don't be wise in your own estimation.
[time=1331] Don't be wise in your own eyes, fear the Lord and turn away from evil.
[time=1336] It will be healing to your body and refreshment to your bones.
[time=1341] Have you done that?
[time=1342] Have you trusted the Lord with all of your heart?
[time=1345] And if you have at some point in time back here, right?
[time=1348] Whether that's two months ago or 20 years ago, if you've done that, how's it going today?
[time=1356] And what have the last seven weeks of study from Proverbs, the discussions we've had about hard and lust
[time=1362] and anger and friends and are you a fool or aren't?
[time=1365] What has that done to that faith and to your heart?
[time=1369] How would you today, having looked at where you are and who you are and what life looks like for you?
[time=1374] How would you assess what's happening?
[time=1378] Does Proverbs 3, 5 and 6, 7 and 8 describe your faith?
[time=1384] My guess is this, having traveled through the pages of this great book over these last two months,
[time=1390] you've come to see that the pattern of your faith walk is one of three things.
[time=1395] My guess would be as you think back on our seven weeks and you sit here this morning assessing the condition and state of your faith.
[time=1404] Probably one of three things comes to mind.
[time=1408] You would either see your faith in light of our study and in light of our discussion as being growing.
[time=1416] Maybe your faith is growing.
[time=1418] Maybe as you look back on the last seven weeks, your assessment of your faith is that it's active.
[time=1424] It's growing, things are happening.
[time=1426] It's not all perfect, no, but there's good things going on.
[time=1430] And you see your faith as a growing, maturing faith.
[time=1434] You've honestly considered, are you a fool?
[time=1437] You've looked at you and your lust and you and your heart and you and your anger and you and your friends.
[time=1442] And in all honesty before God this morning, possibly you sit here and say, "My faith, though not perfect, though I haven't arrived, is growing." There's a second category of some of us who may be in the room and you may in all honesty having looked at the same things,
[time=1458] having heard the same messages, having interacted with the same truth.
[time=1463] In all honesty you may sit here this morning saying, "You know what? My faith is stalled.
[time=1469] My faith, it seems, it senses, it feels as if it's not what it should be.
[time=1476] Doesn't seem to be as active, doesn't seem to be as deep, doesn't seem to be as all encompassing.
[time=1482] I feel like I'm in a fog.
[time=1484] My faith seems stalled." And then there might even be a third group.
[time=1490] In fact, I know that there's a third group.
[time=1494] Some are growing, some are stalled.
[time=1496] A third group would be those of you that realize your faith has been misplaced.
[time=1503] Your faith, that which you believe in, that which you look to to make life work,
[time=1510] you've realized in the last seven weeks that you know what?
[time=1513] Your faith process has been misdirected.
[time=1518] It's been misplaced and if you'd allow me, I'd like to do my best in the next few minutes to encourage and remind all of those
[time=1526] in all three categories this morning with some important truth, some important reminders from God's Word.
[time=1534] Can I do that? Can I just try to state to all three groups, just a few things, but I want you to hold on to,
[time=1540] that I want you to remember, that I want you to take to heart, and I want you to interact with.
[time=1544] Number one, to those of you who would assess your personal faith as a growing faith, all right, if that's you,
[time=1553] if your assessment of your faith and your heart this morning is that it's growing, I want to say this.
[time=1559] That's awesome. That's fantastic.
[time=1563] That is so good for me to know that that's where God has you in your life and your walk and your relationship with him.
[time=1570] Stay at it. I want to say that to you.
[time=1573] Stay at it. Stay humble. Stay soft-hearted. Stay teachable.
[time=1579] But by all means, stay at it. And know in your heart how encouraging it is to our hearts that you're choosing today to live life in that direction.
[time=1590] Know how encouraging it is for me and for us as a family that you're giving yourself to what it says there in 1 Timothy 6.
[time=1599] Look over there in 1 Timothy 6 back over in the New Testament. Paul, he's writing this letter to his son in the faith, Timothy.
[time=1607] And he's encouraging Timothy to be faithful. And he says to Timothy in 1 Timothy 6 verse 11,
[time=1615] it says, "But flee from these things, you man of God, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance, and gentleness."
[time=1627] And I read these verses to you because this is the picture. This is the look you get when you see a heart, when you see a life, when you see a faith that is growing.
[time=1637] When you see a man or a woman, a boy or a girl, and you see an individual whose life bent is toward growth and maturity.
[time=1644] They are being faithful, not perfect, faithful. These are the kinds of things.
[time=1650] These are the kinds of things you see in them. They're fleeing certain things.
[time=1655] Verse 11, referring back to verse 10 and 9 and 8, where it was talking about materialism.
[time=1660] And Paul says, "Flee those things and pursue these things," righteousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance.
[time=1666] And gentleness, look at verse 12, "Fight the good fight, a growing heart, a growing faith, fights the good fight."
[time=1675] It's the good fight of faith. Take hold of the eternal life to what you were called, and you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.
[time=1685] If you're growing this morning in your heart, then what you're saying is this.
[time=1690] You're fleeing materialism and pursuing righteousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance, and gentleness.
[time=1695] You're fighting, not winning every single time, but most of the time, the good fight of faith.
[time=1702] You're living today with eternity. You're living today right here with eternity in mind.
[time=1708] You're thinking, speaking, choosing with a heavenly perspective.
[time=1712] You're not perfect, but then again, perfection wasn't the category.
[time=1717] You assigned yourself today. It was growing. It was maturing.
[time=1722] That's how you've assessed your faith, and that's an exciting, challenging place to be.
[time=1727] Your life may look like this. Your life very well may look like you're sharing your faith.
[time=1734] You find yourself sharing your faith, living out your faith with people you love, people you want to see come to faith in Christ.
[time=1741] You're studying God's Word, learning new life-changing truth on a weekly basis.
[time=1746] You're exercising your spiritual gifts in the body of Christ. You're serving possibly.
[time=1751] In a ministry for the very first time in seeing lives touched by whatever contribution you can bring.
[time=1758] You're in a small group deepening your love for God and your heart for others.
[time=1762] You're giving financially for the first time in a truly sacrificial way.
[time=1767] Your faith is growing.
[time=1771] And that's a great place to be. One last word to you, be careful.
[time=1776] Be careful. If, in fact, that's the assessment of your heart today. Be careful.
[time=1782] Stay humble.
[time=1784] Stay humble. Proverbs 16, 18 says this, pride goes before destruction.
[time=1789] We read that verse several weeks ago. Let's just be reminded of its truth and import again.
[time=1794] Pride goes before destruction and a haughty spirit before stumbling.
[time=1801] Be careful. If you find your faith growing today, be careful.
[time=1807] Don't throw it away. Let me say it that way.
[time=1811] Don't throw your confidence. Don't throw that growth. Don't throw that growing faith away.
[time=1818] And I want to draw your attention back to Hebrews chapter 10.
[time=1821] Hebrews chapter 10, because it's there we find again an insightful and powerful reminder
[time=1828] that anybody here in this room would, I think, be wise to consider, but especially, especially those of us that would say this morning, in light of what we've seen and studied, we find our hearts and our faith growing.
[time=1840] We see our faith being expanded. Look at what it says in Hebrews chapter 10, start at verse 32. You there? It says this, but remember,
[time=1850] writer of Hebrews says, remember the former days when, after being enlightened, you endured a great conflict of sufferings, partly by being made a public spectacle through reproaches and tribulations, and partly by becoming shares with those who were so treated.
[time=1866] For you showed sympathy to the prisoners and accepted joyfully the seizure of your property, knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and an abiding one.
[time=1876] Stop right there in verse 34. You get the picture?
[time=1881] He's referring to a people, he's writing to a group of folks who endured a certain set of circumstances unique to their day.
[time=1890] You and I, as people who have growing faith, we're called to, and we experience
[time=1897] sets of circumstances unique to our day, but all of it leads to the same place, a tested, grown, expanded faith. He's saying, don't forget what you've been through.
[time=1909] Don't forget what God's seen you through. Don't forget the trials. Don't forget the bad days.
[time=1914] Don't forget all that you've seen, all that you've experienced, all that I've led you through.
[time=1920] It has deepened your faith. It has strengthened your walk.
[time=1924] And what does he say in 35? Therefore, do not throw away your confidence,
[time=1930] which has a great reward for you have need of endurance.
[time=1935] You see, that stay at it so that when you have done the will of God, you may receive what was promised. And then it says in 37 and 38, kind of a quote back to the Old Testament in the book of a backic.
[time=1948] It says, "For yet in a very little while he who is coming will come and will not delay, but my righteous one shall live by what?
[time=1956] Shall live by faith. And if he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him."
[time=1963] And then he ends the passage, verse 39, "But we are not of those." No. We are not of those who shrink back to destruction, but of those who have faith to the preserving of the soul.
[time=1978] Don't throw away your confidence. You've been through so much.
[time=1981] It reminds me, I was thinking about it this week.
[time=1983] It reminds me, and again, it's just my wiring and it's my history and my story and my mind just kind of automatically goes to things like this.
[time=1990] It reminds me of playing basketball in college.
[time=1993] One of the greatest coaches I ever had, my freshman year out at San Francisco, just an amazing coach and an amazing man, highly, highly, highly competitive.
[time=2003] And he taught me things and got me to do things I never thought or knew I could do.
[time=2009] And like it was yesterday, I can remember oftentimes Kevin being there in the huddle.
[time=2016] You know, it was a timeout and it would be typically a situation like this.
[time=2020] We were 27 in three that year.
[time=2022] We had a good team ranked in the top five in NCAA Division II.
[time=2027] And we beat a lot of teams and we beat a lot of teams bad, but you know what?
[time=2031] He found little comfort in that. And I remember, you know, a dozen times during that year, being at a huddle with two minutes left, being up by 20 points, having worked hard, having executed properly, having defended with intensity,
[time=2048] having accomplished the game plan in an almost perfect way,
[time=2055] being up by 20 points with two minutes to go.
[time=2059] And him getting on his knees and literally almost touching our noses with his finger,
[time=2065] pointing it at us.
[time=2067] I mean, you could smell the spaghetti from dinner on his breath.
[time=2071] And he would be almost at the top of his lungs.
[time=2075] I'm sure folks, in whatever arena we were in, thought he was just whacked
[time=2081] because he was yelling at us, bury them.
[time=2086] bury them.
[time=2088] Each guy, he'd look us right in the eye, bury them.
[time=2094] And it was that thing in him that he didn't want there to be an ounce of letdown.
[time=2100] He wasn't going to breathe. He wasn't going to sigh till it said, zero, zero, zero, the clock was done and the thing was over.
[time=2108] And stay with me here in the same way.
[time=2111] I mean, God's Word says to you this morning with growing faiths, be careful.
[time=2118] Don't get proud.
[time=2121] And don't sit back. No, no, stay at it.
[time=2127] And though we can't just in the spiritual realm, I can't just say to you, you know, bury them.
[time=2132] You know, it's not in basketball then.
[time=2134] We would get up off the bench and go out and just dig down deep into our own reserves and bury them.
[time=2140] And you and I know in the spiritual realm it's not that easy all the time.
[time=2144] Yes, there's effort that it requires.
[time=2146] But there's also this reliance on the person of God and the Spirit of God that we have to exercise, a wholehearted reliance on the Lord.
[time=2157] We need to have that intense desire to keep moving forward.
[time=2161] But please do all that you can.
[time=2163] Do everything possible to cultivate that reliance on him, that perspective of life, the life he's called you to live.
[time=2172] And stay at it.
[time=2173] Pray this. You're here this morning and you're saying, you know what my assessment is with all humility?
[time=2179] I'm so excited.
[time=2180] I feel like my faith is growing.
[time=2183] Pray this.
[time=2184] I can pray it right now if you want.
[time=2186] I can pray it later.
[time=2187] But pray it.
[time=2188] Say, God, please grow my faith.
[time=2193] God, please expand my faith.
[time=2196] Further solidify, Father, my heart for you and give me courage to live the life.
[time=2204] You've called me the life of faith.
[time=2206] You've called me to live.
[time=2211] That's you this morning.
[time=2212] I'm fired up for you.
[time=2213] I'm thankful that that's where you're at.
[time=2215] Be careful.
[time=2216] Stay at it.
[time=2217] Stay humble.
[time=2219] Secondly, secondly to those of you who know the Lord, that giving over of your heart and life to him has taken place back here at some point in time.
[time=2229] And yet in all honesty as you assess your faith, the condition of your walk on a daily basis, it senses, it feels, it looks stalled.
[time=2240] It's not happening and you know it.
[time=2242] You know in the honesty and the integrity of your own heart, you know it's not what it should be.
[time=2247] You too, over the last seven weeks, you've considered the presence of wisdom or the lack thereof, lust, anger, heart, tongue, friends, all of it.
[time=2256] And it's left you with this clear realization that life patterns and direction have you in your faith in a fog.
[time=2265] Folly seems to win out more often than wisdom.
[time=2269] Oh, there's activity.
[time=2271] There's Christian spiritual activity here and there.
[time=2277] Prayer gets said every once in a while.
[time=2280] There's periodic service.
[time=2281] The page of the scripture gets read now and then, but it all lacks the passion and spirit of a truly engaged faith.
[time=2290] You're stalled.
[time=2292] It's not happening.
[time=2294] It feels dead.
[time=2298] And now to address this group, it's kind of challenging to respond because I'm not sure how you're, I don't know you.
[time=2305] I'm not hearing you say it.
[time=2307] I'm not sure how you're saying it.
[time=2309] Does that make sense?
[time=2310] Because there might be some here this morning who are saying it like this.
[time=2315] My faith is stalled.
[time=2321] And it breaks my heart.
[time=2324] And I don't like it.
[time=2326] I don't like how it feels.
[time=2327] I don't like what it looks like.
[time=2330] It's not who I want to be.
[time=2332] It's stalled.
[time=2335] But it breaks my heart and I want to change and I want to grow and I want to get back to a place that's vital and real.
[time=2342] But in all honesty, you asked, I'm telling you, it's stalled.
[time=2348] Maybe you're saying it like that.
[time=2351] But then again, there have been times in my life.
[time=2354] I won't even talk about you.
[time=2355] I'll just talk about me.
[time=2356] There have been times in my life when in the hardness of my heart and in my own pride and arrogance, I've said it's stalled.
[time=2363] So it's stalled.
[time=2364] Yeah, it's stalled.
[time=2367] And the big deal is what?
[time=2369] I mean, I'm all right.
[time=2370] Remember what you said?
[time=2371] I prayed that prayer and did that thing back there.
[time=2373] So my faith stalled.
[time=2377] Well, so I'm not quite sure how you're saying it.
[time=2379] So I'll just do my best to briefly address both.
[time=2384] You're either confessing your stalled faith or you're just kind of admitting it.
[time=2389] Let's start with the stalled, so what?
[time=2392] Heart, faith this morning, okay?
[time=2395] And again, I'm going to try to point us back to Scripture.
[time=2397] Revelation, turn with me in a revelation.
[time=2400] And this isn't a slap on the wrist.
[time=2403] This is not some condemning judgmental deal we're about to do.
[time=2407] I'm thankful that you're honest enough either way to say it's stalled.
[time=2411] It's not happening.
[time=2412] I just want to remind you of some things.
[time=2415] And again, based upon your attitude, based upon the condition of your heart and faith.
[time=2419] I mean, there's some things I want you to be reminded of this morning that God's word says to stalled hearts.
[time=2425] Revelation 3, go over to verse 15.
[time=2428] It says this, it says, "I know your deeds."
[time=2434] God says this, "I know your deeds that you are neither cold nor hot.
[time=2440] I would rather, if it were up to me, I'd rather it be one way or the other.
[time=2444] I would that you were cold or hot." Verse 16, "But because you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold, I will spit you."
[time=2454] It says out of my mouth.
[time=2457] I want to keep going.
[time=2458] Listen, verse 17, "Because you say I am rich and have become wealthy and have need of nothing,
[time=2464] and you do not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked,
[time=2470] I advise you to buy from me gold refined by fire, that you may become rich and white
[time=2476] garments that you may clothe yourself and that the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed, and I salve to anoint your eyes that you may see." Those whom, verse 19, "Those whom I love, I reprove and discipline."
[time=2493] Be zealous, therefore, and repent.
[time=2499] So what are we saying?
[time=2503] To those of you that might be in all honesty, saying it stalled, but you know what's the big deal?
[time=2509] Be careful.
[time=2511] Be careful this morning.
[time=2513] Stalled faith, cool hearts get addressed.
[time=2520] They don't go unaddressed.
[time=2522] You know, God's word teaches us in places like 1 Corinthians 11 and Hebrews and Hebrews 12 and here in Revelation 3 that He will reprove you.
[time=2531] He will discipline you, or even it says a couple of places there back in 1 Corinthians.
[time=2538] He'll take you home.
[time=2540] He'll take you out rather than allow a cool heart to continue in compromise.
[time=2548] God desires that you and I would give Him and bring Him in our faith walk, not a compromised portion.
[time=2555] No, everything in us, all that we have to give and the very best that we have to offer.
[time=2564] Be reminded again today that cool, cool hearts break His.
[time=2571] Cool hearts break His.
[time=2573] Malachi 1, God gives us this huge insight.
[time=2576] One of my favorite of all passages, one of my favorite Old Testament passages, Malachi.
[time=2585] Into the Old Testament there.
[time=2587] Turn back if you've got your Bibles to Malachi 1.
[time=2591] Look at this.
[time=2592] Look at this heart that God has for you and I, especially those of us that this morning would,
[time=2598] in any way, shape, or form, have to honestly classify our faith as kind of a cool faith.
[time=2604] Kind of a stalled faith, kind of a faith.
[time=2606] It's not really bringing much to the table.
[time=2609] Look what He says.
[time=2610] Malachi chapter 1 starting verse 6.
[time=2612] It says, "The Son honors His Father." Hold on, time out.
[time=2616] This is again a word from, this is a word from the Lord.
[time=2619] Malachi gives this to the people of Israel.
[time=2621] God is not pleased.
[time=2624] God's heart is broken.
[time=2626] And God's heart is broken for a specific reason and He shares that now with the people.
[time=2631] It says, "The Son honors His Father and a servant as master.
[time=2634] Then if I am a father, where is my honor?
[time=2637] And if I am a master, where's my respect?" Says the Lord of hosts to you.
[time=2642] O priests who despise my name, but you say, "How have we despised thy name?" Verse 7.
[time=2648] You are presenting defiled food upon my altar.
[time=2653] But you say, "How have we defiled thee?" In that you say, "The table of the Lord is to be despised." Verse 8.
[time=2661] But when you present the blind, talking about the goats now and the sheep and that whole sacrificial system where they were to and they knew they were to bring God their what?
[time=2672] Their best.
[time=2675] But when you present the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil?
[time=2679] And when you present the lame and sick, is it not evil?
[time=2684] Why not offer that to your governor?
[time=2686] Would he be pleased with you or would he receive you kindly?
[time=2689] Says the Lord of hosts.
[time=2691] Go down to verse 10.
[time=2692] Oh, that there were one among you who would shut the gates that you might not uselessly
[time=2698] kindle fire on my altar.
[time=2700] I am not pleased with you.
[time=2703] How would you like to hear God say that to you?
[time=2707] I am not pleased with you, says the Lord of hosts, nor will I accept an offering from you.
[time=2715] Again, skip down to 13 when I finish this off.
[time=2718] It says this.
[time=2719] You also say, "My, how tiresome it is." And you disdainfully sniff at it, says the Lord of hosts, and you bring what was taken by robbery and what is lame or sick, so you bring the offering.
[time=2731] Should I receive that from your hand, says the Lord?
[time=2734] But, cursed be the swindler who has a male in his flock and bows it but sacrifices a blemished
[time=2741] animal to the Lord, for I am a great king," says the Lord of hosts.
[time=2747] And my name is feared among the nations.
[time=2753] Well, is his name and is he feared in that reverential, respectful type way in your heart?
[time=2761] And are your actions today and are your attitudes in need of kind of a revisit,
[time=2767] the spirit of God and the perspective of God, our Father in heaven longs for a relationship with us in which we would be willing to bring the same thing he brings, an excellent sacrifice,
[time=2779] a whole heart and impassioned faith, a deep abiding active love.
[time=2786] Be careful.
[time=2789] If you're a heart, if your faith is stalled this morning, be careful.
[time=2795] Think these things through.
[time=2798] And let me add this, it's been my experience that stalled faith is time and time again the result of a skewed perspective.
[time=2805] What do I mean by that?
[time=2806] My faith, my own, and my love for God seems to diminish greatly at those times when my
[time=2816] love for things and thrills is increasing.
[time=2822] The things and the thrills of this place that we call earth have captured my attention,
[time=2829] have captured my affections.
[time=2831] When I sense in my heart this leaning and this bent toward the things and the thrills of this place,
[time=2838] it seems like without a doubt there is a direct correlation to this skewed lack of eternal
[time=2844] perspective, things that matter, things that really matter.
[time=2849] Stalled faith is often the result of an earthly perspective.
[time=2854] And if you're stalled and confessing that this morning with a broken heart or whether you're stalled and maybe just admitting it, either way, look at the words of the writer
[time=2866] of Hebrews as he describes one whose faith was enormous because his perspective, his
[time=2873] mindset was away from the things and the thrills, it was firmly fixed on something that mattered
[time=2880] and that firmly fixed perspective brought a level of faith to his life that was amazing.
[time=2887] Look at Hebrews 11, going back and forth here, Old Testament, New Testament.
[time=2892] Hebrews 11, verse 8, Hebrews 11, 8.
[time=2896] I love this passage, it says in 8, 9, and 10, it says, "By faith, Abraham, when he was
[time=2902] called, obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive foreign inheritance, and he went out not knowing where he was going, he didn't know where he was going.
[time=2911] God said go and he went trusting, believing in his heart, for he was looking for the city
[time=2918] which has foundations, excuse me, by faith he lived as an alien, by faith he lived as an
[time=2925] alien in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, dwelling in tents."
[time=2931] Wait, wait, what did it say?
[time=2933] Dwelling in mansions, dwelling in fixed, for no, dwelling in tents, he's just passing
[time=2939] through.
[time=2940] That was the mindset.
[time=2942] This things and this thrills thing didn't do it for him.
[time=2945] No, there was this mindset that was fixed on this place and whatever I had to do here, I'll do an attempt because I know I'm not here for long.
[time=2955] By faith he lived as an alien in a foreign land dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob.
[time=2961] Fellow heirs of the same promise, for he was looking for the city which has foundations, whose architect and builder is God, and that city, go ahead and say it, its name is what?
[time=2972] Heaven.
[time=2974] He lived with heaven, he lived with eternity, he lived with glory in mind.
[time=2979] And when you and I live, like Colossians 3 says, setting our minds on the things above,
[time=2986] seeking the things above.
[time=2988] Oh, living with purpose here, yes, but when our affections and our heart and our perspective are tied to this thing that really matters, it makes a difference.
[time=2999] It makes a difference in the way we live and walk by faith.
[time=3004] Well, let me say this, your faith may be growing, your faith may be stalled.
[time=3012] And you know what?
[time=3014] Your faith may be misplaced.
[time=3019] There very well may be still another group here this morning.
[time=3022] And you too have journeyed.
[time=3025] You too have journeyed with us these past seven weeks.
[time=3028] We've caught a week here or there, but you've heard enough and you've seen enough from God's word to assess, maybe for the first time, maybe for the very first time in your life,
[time=3041] that your faith, what you believe, what you look to, what you count on, what you kind
[time=3048] of have given yourself to, doesn't work.
[time=3054] It never brings what it promises, never provides what you thought it would.
[time=3059] And this faith, this belief system in your heart and life, you're coming to the realization.
[time=3065] The more and more this book speaks to you through us, you're realizing your faith has been misplaced.
[time=3072] Your faith has been misdirected.
[time=3078] As you've had the opportunity to look carefully at wise living and as you begin to understand better the message of God's word, the specifics of the gospel and what it means to really have faith that has been placed in Christ.
[time=3090] As you see these things, more and more, you have to admit today that your faith has been
[time=3096] wrongly planted.
[time=3097] Your experience in life is teaching you what Solomon himself learned and recorded for us in Ecclesiastes 2, and I want you to turn there.
[time=3105] And I want you to turn there or read with us.
[time=3107] You know, this morning, if you're here saying, you know what, in all honesty, I really never have entered into this relationship that you speak of with Christ.
[time=3114] I'm still trying to figure this out.
[time=3116] I'm trying to understand this faith concept.
[time=3119] If that's you this morning, read along with us.
[time=3121] If you have a Bible, great turn there.
[time=3123] If you don't read the screens.
[time=3124] But you know what, if your faith is growing or your faith is stalled, don't go to sleep.
[time=3130] Be reminded of what it says here in the second chapter, a guy, a man, the wisest, most gifted, most wealthy guy that probably ever walked the earth back in these days has some important
[time=3141] things to say about where faith gets placed.
[time=3145] It says in Ecclesiastes 2, verse 1, "I said to myself, come now, I will test you with pleasure."
[time=3151] So enjoy yourself, Solomon speaking, and behold, it too, he says, was futility.
[time=3158] I said of laughter, it is madness, and of pleasure, what does it accomplish?
[time=3162] I explored with my mind how to stimulate my body with wine while my mind was guiding me wisely and how to take hold of folly until I could see what good there is for the sons of men to do under heaven the few years of their lives.
[time=3175] I enlarged my works, I built houses for myself, I planted vineyards for myself, I made gardens and parks for myself, and I planted them with all kinds of fruit trees.
[time=3185] I made ponds of water for myself from which to irrigate a forest of growing trees.
[time=3191] I bought male and female slaves, and I had home-born slaves.
[time=3195] Also, I possessed flocks and urged larger than all who preceded me in Jerusalem.
[time=3200] Also, verse 8, I collected for myself silver and gold, and the treasure of kings and provinces.
[time=3206] I provided for myself male and female singers and the pleasures of men, many concubines.
[time=3213] Then I became great and increased more than all who preceded me in Jerusalem.
[time=3218] My wisdom also stood by me.
[time=3222] And all that my eyes desired, I did not refuse them.
[time=3227] Think about that.
[time=3229] All that my eyes desired, this guy had the resources to not refuse himself anything.
[time=3239] I did not withhold my heart from any pleasure, for my heart was pleased because of all my labor,
[time=3245] and this was my reward for all of my labor, verse 11, thus I considered all my activities,
[time=3253] which my hands had done in the labor which I had exerted, and behold, all was vanity.
[time=3260] The word means futile, it means empty, it means nothing.
[time=3268] All of it was vanity and striving after wind, and there was no prophet under the sun.
[time=3278] If you're here this morning with a faith that in some way, somehow, somewhere in your life,
[time=3284] it got misplaced, it got misdirected.
[time=3287] And you've been listening to the study of Proverbs, you've been considering as we have.
[time=3293] You're lost in anger and in heart and friends and foolish and all of that.
[time=3298] And if you're here this morning and God seems to be kind of tugging at your heart, I bet to some degree what Solomon recorded for us makes a lot of sense to you.
[time=3308] It made a lot of sense to me when I sat where you sit.
[time=3313] I realized this 15 years ago, we so many times attempt outside of relationship with Christ
[time=3322] to find the life, fulfillment and joy in things and people that are incapable
[time=3328] and unable to bring that level of satisfaction and meaning.
[time=3333] Does that make sense?
[time=3335] We try to find the answer in things and people that were not designed by God to ever give us the answer.
[time=3343] We search in places God never designed the answer to be found.
[time=3350] And we're relentless in that pursuit.
[time=3355] As Solomon said, they bring only futility and an emptiness that's hard to describe.
[time=3365] And it was at that point, you know, in my own life that someone introduced me, finally just sat me down and said, "You know what, let's talk this through." All what Solomon said is true.
[time=3376] That is futile and empty and the satisfaction and the meaning and the purpose and the forgiveness that gets rid of all that guilt is found in the person of Jesus Christ,
[time=3389] found in the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=3393] And I want to ask you this morning, you know, if your faith was growing, I said pray that it would expand.
[time=3402] If your faith is stalled, I don't think I said it, but I meant to.
[time=3406] If your faith is stalled, I would pray for a renewed spirit.
[time=3412] Kind of like the psalmist in Psalm 51.
[time=3414] Cleanse my heart, renewing me a steadfast and faithful spirit.
[time=3420] But you know this morning, if your faith is misplaced, if you sit here today realizing
[time=3426] that it's been disconnected and misdirected.
[time=3429] Understand today, right now this morning, you can pray to embrace true faith.
[time=3437] You can pray and ask God to do a work in you that would allow you the kind of faith
[time=3443] and the kind of satisfaction and the kind of fulfillment and the kind of purpose for life and then the opportunity finally to have true wisdom energized in and through your world,
[time=3455] your life, your home, your relationships.
[time=3458] But that comes when you embrace faith, completely, wholeheartedly and personally.
[time=3465] So wherever you are this morning, growing in your faith, stalled in your faith, or a faith that's been misplaced, it's time to pray.
[time=3474] And let's do that together. Would you stand with me?
[time=3477] And I just want to as you stand and as you close your eyes and as we close here, I want to encourage, you know, each of you in that each of you in those first two categories,
[time=3487] please, whether growing or stalled, my hope and my ask of you this morning is that you would pray those prayers, that you would seriously take some time to ask God to come in and help you rethink
[time=3502] and re-strategize and re-approach, you know, your walk of faith on a daily basis.
[time=3510] But if you hear this morning and your heart just has started to kind of cry out and now hearing what you've heard today, you realize the need you have for true saving faith,
[time=3522] I want to give you the chance to pray right now this morning to enter into the greatest relationship, the life-giving, life-altering relationship
[time=3533] that one has when they enter into relationship with a living God.
