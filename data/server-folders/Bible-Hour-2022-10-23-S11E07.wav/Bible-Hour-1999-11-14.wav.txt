[time=0] I don't know if that's going to be good.
[time=1] But I think that's going to be good.
[time=287] [MUSIC]
[time=300] Coming to His presence.
[time=303] We're thanks living in your heart and giving praise.
[time=310] Give Him praise.
[time=315] Coming to His presence.
[time=318] We're thanks living in your heart.
[time=321] Your voices raise.
[time=325] Give glory.
[time=338] And power unto Him.
[time=345] Jesus the name of the great.
[time=359] Coming to His presence.
[time=363] With His giving in your heart and giving praise.
[time=370] Give Him praise.
[time=375] Coming to His presence.
[time=378] With His giving in your heart and giving praise.
[time=385] Your voices raise.
[time=390] Give glory.
[time=393] And honor and power unto Him.
[time=404] Jesus the name of the great.
[time=417] Give glory and honor and power unto Him.
[time=433] Jesus the name of the great.
[time=444] We are your people.
[time=449] May for your glory and we worship you.
[time=458] Yes we worship you.
[time=464] We are your people.
[time=469] May for your glory and we worship you.
[time=483] Yes we worship you.
[time=503] May for your glory and we worship you.
[time=516] Yes we worship you.
[time=523] May for our glory and we worship you.
[time=537] Yes we worship you.
[time=543] May for our glory and we worship you.
[time=601] May for our glory and honor and power unto Him.
[time=615] Jesus the name of the great.
[time=645] I don't think there's anything wrong with the world today.
[time=656] I think if there's anything that we think is wrong and we don't take enough personal responsibility.
[time=660] I think that close-minded people open their mouth way too much.
[time=665] Well in my opinion most of the governmental policies, I mean the way a government works right now is kind of ineffective in making legislation.
[time=674] I don't know your neighbors enough anymore so a lot of crime due to that I think.
[time=679] I think at a global stance I think a real problem is a population growth.
[time=685] People are a lot more selfish now than we were several years ago and they only care about themselves getting the good life for themselves
[time=695] and they don't care who they step on on the way down or the way up.
[time=698] There's a lot of bigotry a lot of ignorance that if people were to learn more about other people I think a lot of the conflicts that we have today would end or cease.
[time=710] I would have to say that violence and people with like no morals.
[time=716] I'm an international student from China.
[time=719] We believe it's evolution.
[time=721] We need to work hard and do our best.
[time=726] So both people here tell me about God and creation.
[time=734] So I was kind of confusing but I think this world is going to be better and better.
[time=742] Get rid of all the attorneys.
[time=749] No, I think personal responsibility again falls in there.
[time=754] If we just learn to take things on for ourselves and not blame other people when things go wrong.
[time=760] Knowledge is power so if people know what they're doing and know what they're saying then they won't hurt as many people as they do.
[time=768] We probably have to take more direct action with our representatives I guess.
[time=774] I think people can start to work within their community and start to get people to know each other and work out that way.
[time=781] And then maybe they'll help review some of the crime because people will be watching out for each other a lot more than they are now.
[time=786] We will find a solution to it.
[time=788] It's just a matter of developing the right technology and stuff.
[time=792] Things might be great with technology and stuff but we're still human.
[time=797] We still have to depend on each other and if we don't then we're going to fall apart and educate your children.
[time=803] Pay your educators so that they're there to educate your children.
[time=807] People have to go back to a family structure, you know, like back to, you know, going to church that sort of thing.
[time=815] People get a lot of love. People get smarter and smarter.
[time=818] Do you have a more new stuff coming up and that there's more like a beautiful place, way, food to make it up so I think it's better now?
[time=834] I think it basically just starts in yourself. Make sure that you're ready.
[time=837] Make sure that you don't have kids until you're ready and make sure that you help those who might not be and support them and whatever endeavors they have.
[time=844] I think it's finding a nuisance of family and commitment to what life is about and what makes the world a good place.
[time=874] They're still out of desperate prayer. I know they're not alone.
[time=880] They've come to face the fear in a tense stone.
[time=886] I hear the voices, the souls in need of you, God.
[time=893] You are the answer and the meaning of life. Too hard and nervous to the source of the life.
[time=902] As we walk this human road, every question will buy you are the answer.
[time=918] I'll cross the playground yard, another future society, living and learning the way it's supposed to be.
[time=933] You are the answer and the meaning of life. Too hard and nervous to the source of the life.
[time=945] As we walk this human road, every question will buy you are the answer.
[time=952] The meaning of life. Too hard and nervous to the source of the life. As we walk this human road, every question will buy you are the answer.
[time=972] You've shown your light in me when a head's away. Rescue my dying heart that I could not say.
[time=981] And not just for me but for the world today.
[time=994] You are the answer and the meaning of life. Too hard and nervous to the source of the life. As we walk this human road, every question will buy you are the answer.
[time=1058] Hey, would you pray with me? It's always interesting for me as I watch that video.
[time=1063] It's always amazing to hear people articulate the problems that they know are there they can't deny exist and they are so willing and so ready to say what the problems are.
[time=1074] And they're right. And then to hear them talk about the answers and to hear things like knowledge and technology and education.
[time=1082] And then some of them kind of beat around the bush and they're almost there but nobody's quite there.
[time=1087] And then we hear a song that answers the question. And it's a reminder to me as we kind of jump back into our mission in the heartbeat of Blackhawk this morning.
[time=1098] It's not so much that we have the answer. I mean we do. But it's that he's the answer. And he has given, if you know him this morning, he's given you the answer.
[time=1108] And us then the opportunity and privilege of not only living that answer out but sharing that answer.
[time=1116] So let's pray and ask God to kind of be with us this morning as we talk through these things.
[time=1121] Father, we are, as I said, reminded again of what an amazing thing it is that in the midst of so many trials, in the midst of world confusion, in the midst of crisis that we see and face every day.
[time=1132] God, you have given each and every person that walks the face of this earth, the chance to see and understand and receive the answer.
[time=1142] And God, the amazing thing again that we're reminded of today is that for some reason you've chosen us to be the people, to be the instruments that would deliver that answer.
[time=1152] And so God, we pray for strength and we pray for your help. God, this morning, as we open our hearts again to the heartbeat of this church, as we consider where it is that we sense and feel you leading us in the way that we minister.
[time=1166] God, in the way that we do church, God, our prayer this morning is that you would solidify in our hearts that answer.
[time=1172] And God then further solidify our commitment to it, to live it, to know it, to share it.
[time=1178] We pray, God, in that direction, in your son's name. Amen.
[time=1182] Well, I've been doing a lot of thinking about our mission two weeks ago.
[time=1187] You know, we had a great time together and we got a chance to kind of review our four E's, the four, the reason that we exist as a church.
[time=1195] And we not only had a chance to talk back through those E's, we had a chance to see those E's kind of lived out in fruition and living color right here on stage as Kathy came and shared with us throughout the morning.
[time=1206] You know, her story and how Blackhawk and the Lord had really changed her and her family, and it was a wonderful time.
[time=1214] And then last week, Steve came, and Steve gave a great message.
[time=1218] And it was about the attitude. It was about the heart behind the mission.
[time=1223] The kind of heart attitude that you and I have to possess, the kind of attitude we have to exemplify if those four E's, if the mission of our church is going to be realized.
[time=1233] And this morning, you know, I just come really encouraged again.
[time=1238] I come excited. I've been having probably the last couple of weeks a chance to think through, just in my own life experience right here, what being a part of a church like that has meant for me.
[time=1247] And it excites me and it encourages me and it challenges me.
[time=1251] My mind goes several different directions. Over a year ago, a little over a year ago, I think, they'll help me with the date I'm sure later when they hear this.
[time=1259] But a couple from our family, from our family now, over a year and a half ago, they weren't from our family, but they came asking for help.
[time=1267] They had been through a bitter and ugly divorce and had, I think, because God was still kind of that work tugging at their hearts.
[time=1275] They had come back asking, was there a way they could bring that thing back together?
[time=1280] Was there a way that God could help them, that we could help them nurture that relationship, again, a divorced couple?
[time=1287] And so we rolled up our sleeves around here and we jumped in with them and we gave everything we could to them.
[time=1293] And we helped and we talked and we counseled and we prayed and we tried to answer hard questions and we were there when it didn't work.
[time=1300] And a year, probably a year later, and this was about a year ago, we stood.
[time=1306] We stood me and that couple and their family and my family and some other friends, we stood in the harvest room and remarried them.
[time=1316] And we had flowers and we had a little wedding right there.
[time=1322] Count me in.
[time=1324] Count me into a kind of place that gets to be a part of things like that.
[time=1328] Met with a couple, just a few weeks ago, a couple who had the courage because of what God had been doing through this place,
[time=1335] because what God had been kind of teaching them and showing them through His Word on Sunday mornings had a couple make some enormous decisions in their life.
[time=1344] Huge decisions, painful, challenging decisions that meant a complete and utterly different direction in some areas and they made it.
[time=1353] They made that choice and we now get the chance to kind of walk through life with them as they've made new choices.
[time=1359] I think about a grown man, just a grown adult man who came to me a few weeks ago and let me know that because of what we had tried to do and what we gave,
[time=1369] we gave our best, that whole series in Proverbs. He said those eight weeks changed his life.
[time=1376] The series in Proverbs, not done perfectly, but done with the best of intentions and the best of efforts in an attempt to glorify and honor God and hopefully encourage and challenge you.
[time=1387] And a guy comes forward and says, "You know what, it changed my life." Changed it, had a wife write me a note last week told me that her husband and kids are in church for the first time in 15 years.
[time=1399] Kids, getting something finally from church, enjoying meeting new friends, having teachers make enormous investments in their lives.
[time=1408] A husband who kind of felt like, you know, he was okay being here, enjoyed it, felt welcomed.
[time=1413] You know, I hear story after story and I hear all of that and I say to myself, you know what, I'm so thankful.
[time=1420] There are so many guys in my position, people, you know, men, pastors in my shoes who don't ever get to be a part of a church like that.
[time=1427] They dream about it and I used to dream about it and here it is happening and we get to be a part of it and so this morning I want to ask you this.
[time=1436] This morning we come to our five-step strategy, our five-step ministry process.
[time=1442] Then I have a question for us today, how can you and I, how can we on a daily basis live out the mission of Blackhawk?
[time=1451] Having internalized it, having sat here two weeks ago and nodded your heads at me saying, "Yeah, yeah, those four E's, yes, I believe in those."
[time=1461] Yes, I want to give myself to those, how can you and I do and practice those things?
[time=1467] How can we take the amazing truths of Acts 2, Matthew 28, 2 Corinthians 5, 1 Peter 1, Hebrews 10, John 4, Ephesians 4, Romans 12, all those passages we looked at two weeks ago?
[time=1480] And others and live out what God's Word says really matters and in so doing make a difference and I hope you want to do that.
[time=1491] I hope there's something in you that wants to live life in a way whereby you get a chance to make a difference.
[time=1499] I mean to not live life with that kind of thought, to not live life with that kind of attitude, to not make a difference is to do nothing.
[time=1509] And there's something about making a difference, there's something about at least in my heart when I see an organism like this and a mission like ours and I realize the impact it can and does have on people's lives, it excites me.
[time=1522] I want to be a part of that and I hope you do too. I want to make a difference in a world that loses hope daily.
[time=1529] I want to be a part of something that offers hope to a world that loses it daily.
[time=1536] I want to be a part of a church designed by God to reflect His love, grace and glory.
[time=1541] So how can we, you and I, see dreams like this become a reality?
[time=1546] Tell you what, by throwing your heart, by throwing your life, by throwing your days into these five symbols right there, by throwing your heart, by throwing your life and by throwing your days into what these five symbols represent, not these five symbols.
[time=1565] I mean these five symbols are well done.
[time=1568] Ron and Brian did a great job of building them and they look sharp, but it's not about the wood and it's not about the picture, but it's about you and I being willing to really throw our hearts and lives and our hours and our days into the truth of what these symbols represent.
[time=1586] And just know, again, we didn't just throw them up there and there's been thought, there's been prayer, there's real purpose to what those symbols represent.
[time=1596] As a growing maturing believer who calls Black Occom, these five symbols, these five steps are the gauge, they represent the measuring stick by which your life and mind get assessed.
[time=1610] These five symbols, straight from the word of God, like we talked about two weeks ago, not programmatic in nature, truth in nature.
[time=1620] Those five symbols provide for you and I a way of gauging and assessing our life, not the balance in your 401k, not the good intentions that you have, not your engagement or involvement in three of the five, no, all five.
[time=1635] Absolutely, wholeheartedly, fully and completely embraced and practiced.
[time=1642] And this morning, we're going to have a great time, I hope, I'm going to have a great time, I'm looking forward this morning to really looking at talking about interacting with, we're going to have some interaction time later, really the first, first two and a half, and I'll explain the half in just a bit, but the first two and a half.
[time=1661] But remember, there's kind of a front end, back end to our mission here at Black Occom.
[time=1667] There's a front end and back end to the great commission.
[time=1671] The front end, again, dealing mainly with evangelism, first two and a half steps, which is this morning, dealing with your willingness in mind to live life in a way whereby we're willing to build redemptive, authentic, genuine relationships with people who live currently outside the family of God.
[time=1690] In an effort to see them come to faith in Christ.
[time=1694] First part of the deal is really evangelism.
[time=1698] In the last two and a half, again, we'll deal more with establishing believers in their faith, establishing and maturing and growing the church.
[time=1707] But this morning, we get a chance to look at the first couple, two and a half steps, and I want to jump right in with step one, the hands.
[time=1716] The hands that are shaking, authentic relationship is what we say, what we think when we see those hands.
[time=1723] Build, build an authentic, hopefully, redemptive relationship with people in your life.
[time=1731] It might be family, it might be folks on your block, it might be people you work with.
[time=1736] It might be someone that, you know, your kids play ball with, a parent, an ant.
[time=1741] It could be anybody, whoever it is, that God seems to have kind of brought into your sphere of opportunity and relationship.
[time=1748] We're saying, are you willing, are you ready?
[time=1751] We'll train you, we'll encourage you, we'll stand behind you, we'll do all that we can to support you.
[time=1757] Will you be willing to build that kind of relationship?
[time=1761] Take the time to make the time, to pray for the time and opportunity to reach out of hand.
[time=1767] To rearrange your social life, to rearrange your spiritual life, if needed, in an effort to extend your heart, your time, your energy, even your family.
[time=1779] To even see one who lives without Christ come to know him.
[time=1784] This step means you'll go to great lengths to share life-giving truth with a friend you've grown to know and love.
[time=1791] Why?
[time=1793] Because God says they matter that much.
[time=1796] God's Word says they're worth it.
[time=1798] Remember, too, somebody somewhere was willing to be used of God to help bring you to faith.
[time=1805] Who was it?
[time=1806] Somebody somewhere was willing to do what it took to sacrifice, to communicate, to sit down and talk, to pray for, to encourage you and I.
[time=1816] My hope is that in my life I would be as willing, if not more, to extend that same kind of effort.
[time=1821] God the Father sends God the Son, His only Son, to be misunderstood, mistreated, and murdered, so that a lost and dying world could have life everlasting.
[time=1831] And He says to you and I, like we saw two weeks ago in 2 Corinthians 5, He says to you and I, you are my ambassadors.
[time=1839] You have been given this ministry of reconciliation.
[time=1843] Now go and be reconciling people in your world.
[time=1847] Represent me, represent my message.
[time=1850] I want to ask you to do something tonight before you go to bed.
[time=1854] And I mean this, really.
[time=1856] I mean, I'm just going to ask you and I'm going to trust you to do it, okay?
[time=1859] I'm going to ask you as an individual.
[time=1861] I'm going to ask you as a family.
[time=1863] I'm going to ask you and you're a group of friends.
[time=1866] However it works.
[time=1867] Maybe it's tonight, you know, at someone's house.
[time=1869] Maybe it's around the bed before you go to sleep.
[time=1871] Maybe it's at the dinner kitchen table where I'm going to ask everyone here this morning.
[time=1876] To tonight before the head hits the pillow.
[time=1879] I want you and those that you're with to read Luke chapter 15.
[time=1883] Go ahead and write it down.
[time=1885] I want you to read Luke chapter 15.
[time=1887] We've studied it.
[time=1889] We've looked at it many times here in our times together on Sunday morning in the past.
[time=1894] I want you to look at it again.
[time=1896] If you're all by yourself, that's fine.
[time=1898] Read it by yourself.
[time=1899] If you're with some friends, great.
[time=1900] But I want you to read tonight from the first verse to the last.
[time=1905] The entirety of Luke chapter 15.
[time=1908] And you'll see tonight, or this afternoon, whenever you do that, you will see again that in that chapter the Lord gives us a picture of God's heart.
[time=1917] God's love for those with a misplaced faith.
[time=1921] God's deep affection for those who live outside the family of God.
[time=1927] And we see a couple of things in that passage.
[time=1929] And again, look at it tonight.
[time=1930] Read it once.
[time=1931] Read it twice.
[time=1932] Talk about it with your kids.
[time=1933] Ask questions.
[time=1934] Try and surface all that you can with whoever you read that with tonight.
[time=1938] But here's a few things that you'll see.
[time=1940] Number one, we see in the stories.
[time=1942] There's three.
[time=1943] Three stories in that chapter.
[time=1944] We see in these stories that something valuable, something of great value is missing.
[time=1952] The woman's coin can't be found.
[time=1955] The shepherd's sheep has gone astray.
[time=1957] The father's son has left his father's home.
[time=1961] And how do we know it's valuable?
[time=1964] How do we know it means so much?
[time=1966] Well, the text reveals it.
[time=1967] The second thing you'll see as you read that tonight is this.
[time=1970] Whatever's lost.
[time=1972] And in each of the three scenarios you see it lived out.
[time=1975] Whatever's lost, warrants an all-out search.
[time=1979] The woman vigorously sweeps.
[time=1983] Looking for the coin.
[time=1985] The shepherd leaves the herd to go and find the one.
[time=1988] And the father runs to the top of the hill anxiously awaiting any sign or indication of his son down the way.
[time=1996] And if that doesn't seal it for you, if that doesn't answer the do they matter, are they worth it question?
[time=2002] There's one more thing that you got to look at.
[time=2005] You'll see this thirdly when you read through that passage tonight.
[time=2008] When you look at its truth, you'll see all throughout Luke 15 that when what was once lost is found,
[time=2018] when the coin gets found, when the sheet gets brought back, when the son comes home, there is a celebration.
[time=2028] There is an enormous celebration.
[time=2031] There is excitement.
[time=2032] There is joy.
[time=2033] There is laughter. There is celebrating when what was lost.
[time=2038] And when what was so valuable was lost and when it is found, people celebrate.
[time=2044] And that though, the individual's celebration, it pales in comparison to what we see in Luke 15-7.
[time=2051] And I will have you turn there right now.
[time=2053] Look at Luke 15-7.
[time=2055] I'll give you a good chance to open your Bible and get Luke 15 marked for tonight.
[time=2059] Look at Luke 15.
[time=2063] The woman finds her coin as she celebrates.
[time=2071] The sheet gets found and the shepherds celebrate, but watch what it says in 15-7.
[time=2077] Luke 15-7 says this.
[time=2079] I tell you, I tell you that in the same way, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents
[time=2087] than over 99 righteous persons who need no repentance.
[time=2092] And look at verse 10.
[time=2093] And in the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.
[time=2101] They throw a party in heaven for one.
[time=2105] One equals a party in heaven, a celebration over new life.
[time=2110] God and heavenly beings celebrate those who come to faith in Christ, when one who was far from God tastes the joy of salvation, heaven goes nuts.
[time=2120] They're so excited.
[time=2123] Somebody said recently to me, it was a good conversation and we kind of got through it well.
[time=2128] It was just, it was interesting.
[time=2129] Someone said recently to me, maybe we shouldn't clap at baptisms.
[time=2136] Maybe it was a little irreverent.
[time=2139] And I listened and we, again, it was a good conversation.
[time=2141] We talked back and forth and I think we kind of worked through that issue and it was good to do so.
[time=2146] Great attitudes.
[time=2148] The thought, though, was running through my mind.
[time=2151] I didn't say all this, but the thought was running through my, I guess I'm going to say it now.
[time=2155] The thought was running through my mind.
[time=2158] You know what, and I wasn't really at this person.
[time=2160] It was just kind of in general, I think about us as a family, you.
[time=2163] I mean, I'm getting to know a lot of you.
[time=2165] And I think, you know what?
[time=2166] Drew Brees throws a touchdown pass and half this church goes bonkers on Saturdays.
[time=2172] You're in your living room, high-fiving three-year-old kids and spilling popcorn
[time=2178] because the Boilermakers scored.
[time=2180] 1987, Keith Smart hit the shot that beat Syracuse to win the national title
[time=2186] and half this church went ballistic and you're still talking about it.
[time=2191] You know what I mean?
[time=2192] The Ryder Cup team, Justin Leonard.
[time=2195] I mean, and I'm in on this one.
[time=2197] Justin Leonard hits that pot and I'm dancing around my living room.
[time=2200] I'm high-fiving my two-year-old daughter.
[time=2202] I'm screaming at the top of my lungs.
[time=2204] They did it!
[time=2206] Peyton Manning scrambles for a touchdown and half this church goes ape.
[time=2211] Whoo!
[time=2214] Those things matter to us, and so we celebrate.
[time=2218] And some of us celebrate more than others because we're wired differently, but we celebrate.
[time=2223] But somebody wants lost and destined for hell, responds to the call of God,
[time=2229] embraces Christ and now lives with hope and eternal life.
[time=2232] And I'm going to keep quiet while all of heaven celebrates.
[time=2236] I don't think so.
[time=2238] I'm not going to.
[time=2240] I'm going to say, praise God.
[time=2242] I'm going to say, wow!
[time=2244] And I want you to celebrate in your own way.
[time=2247] That's fine, but there's something about that passage, and there's something about what he says there when he says heaven celebrates.
[time=2255] The angels and God, they celebrate one life.
[time=2258] Well, when we see and get the privilege of witnessing one life who has come from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of light, I hope you'll celebrate with me.
[time=2268] Amen?
[time=2269] [AMEN] God's word calls us to throw our lives.
[time=2274] Throw them to throw everything we have into the building of these kinds of relationships,
[time=2280] not for notches on our spiritual belts or out of guilt or obligation, but because our hearts long for them to know God and his grace.
[time=2289] And here's a question for you.
[time=2290] If your heart got to ask yourself, got to be honest today, if your heart doesn't long for them to know God and his grace,
[time=2301] if this morning in these first ten minutes, as we talk about that first step and your willingness in mind to extend a hand, to extend a life, to radically change things in order to be able to offer that kind of involvement.
[time=2315] If something about that doesn't stir something deep in your heart, something's wrong, something's not right.
[time=2325] God says this is what we were made for.
[time=2328] God says they matter, God says be willing to go and extend a hand, extend a life, and in so doing extend hope.
[time=2337] Number two, step number two, the question mark, indicating conversation that counts, asking questions, hearing answers, entering into this spiritual dialogue.
[time=2349] It's within this trust-filled, time-invested friendship that we are committed to having conversation that counts.
[time=2357] And inevitably, you know it's true, I know it's true, we've seen it, we've experienced it.
[time=2362] A value is debated, a question gets asked.
[time=2365] A crisis hits, and ears and hearts are now listening.
[time=2370] Churches get visited, tapes get listened to, books get read, and someone's ready to talk, finally.
[time=2377] So what do you say?
[time=2380] What do you say to them?
[time=2382] How do you respond to those kinds of opportunities?
[time=2385] What comes out of your mouth when you have opportunity to actually engage in conversations that really count?
[time=2393] Conversations that matter.
[time=2395] How ready are we to, as it says in 1 Peter 3.15, make a defense for?
[time=2402] How ready are we to, says it right there in the screen.
[time=2405] Sanctified Christ is Lord in your hearts always being ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you, as a generalist and reverence, 1 Peter 3.15, are you ready?
[time=2419] And prepared to articulate truth and your own personal encounter with it
[time=2426] and the hope of the gospel.
[time=2428] I want to give you a chance this morning to kind of loosen up, have a good time, think this through, and actually, wherever you are in response to that question, how ready are you to delve into and have conversations to count, we're going to give you a chance to work on that, all right?
[time=2445] And I've asked Ty Bello, Ty Bello is a dear friend and just somebody that I really appreciate 'cause Ty is so given to our mission.
[time=2452] He embarred both and their family, and Ty is one of the guys that really gives leadership to our contagious Christianity, evangelism, personal relational evangelism, training.
[time=2462] And if you've been through contagious or if you've been through evangelism stuff years and years and years ago, there's this illustration that gets used in there.
[time=2472] And I've seen it and I've heard it, and it's been around for a long time, but it continues to carry with it some punch, some power, some real clarity.
[time=2480] It's called the bridge.
[time=2482] And I've asked Ty, if he would come this morning, you've got, in your bulletins, kind of a blank piece of paper.
[time=2489] Go ahead and get it out. It says the bridge on it.
[time=2491] And I want you just to hold on to that, okay?
[time=2493] Don't do anything with it yet.
[time=2494] Give Ty your attention.
[time=2496] He's going to come on up now and he is going to have some fun working us through this great illustration.
[time=2502] Thank you.
[time=2503] I want you to think about two things before we get started.
[time=2506] I want you to think of two words, the real easy.
[time=2508] Do, do, and done, D-O-N-E.
[time=2513] And that's really the basis for this whole illustration.
[time=2516] Now, there's God, and there's us, okay?
[time=2521] God, us.
[time=2525] God has a deep desire to be in a relationship with us.
[time=2530] But you see, we're fallen and we have separated ourselves from God.
[time=2540] Therefore breaking that relationship.
[time=2543] And no matter how much we do, for example, we may go to church.
[time=2551] We may give to charity.
[time=2555] We may live a moral life.
[time=2560] No matter what we do, it's very clear and it's evident in the Bible
[time=2566] that we fall short every time.
[time=2569] And I know this is going to be hard to hear.
[time=2572] But the Bible's clear about this too.
[time=2575] Our punishment for this separation is death.
[time=2585] Now, no matter what we do or how we try, we can't cross that gap
[time=2592] to build a relationship with God.
[time=2595] And our punishment is going to be death.
[time=2598] But there is one thing that has been done.
[time=2601] God bridged that gap.
[time=2606] He bridged the gap when Jesus died on the cross for us, done.
[time=2616] He did what we could not do by dying on the cross for us.
[time=2621] Therefore, paying our penalty of death.
[time=2626] Now, it's not just enough to know this as you and I stand over here.
[time=2633] It's not just enough to realize that, you know, I'm trying to live a moral life.
[time=2637] You know, I go to church, I give to charity.
[time=2639] You know, it's not enough.
[time=2641] Or you can plug something else in there.
[time=2643] You know, Mother Teresa, good lady, Billy Graham, great man, Charles Manson.
[time=2652] Not so hot.
[time=2653] Okay? That's a personal illustration.
[time=2656] And it doesn't matter.
[time=2657] Any one of those three, you still fall short.
[time=2661] And it's not enough to just know that.
[time=2664] You have to make a conscious effort to cross over to the other side.
[time=2673] And make a decision.
[time=2676] Now, my question for you is this.
[time=2679] Where are you? Where are you on this side relative to crossing the bridge?
[time=2688] Now, what I've just illustrated for you is as if you were a seeker and I were talking to you.
[time=2694] Maybe not as animated at a dinner table or something like that, but nonetheless, I was talking to you.
[time=2699] And that is the same way that you can talk to your friends that are seekers too.
[time=2705] You know this illustration, I'd love to know all of the places that it's been done at.
[time=2709] I know for one fact, in Marlows in Chicago, it was done on a piece of butcher block paper once upon a time.
[time=2716] And Kelly was there with me as we walked through this.
[time=2718] And it raised the interest of the waitress, as you remember, she just looked down.
[time=2722] Like, what's that? Great opportunity.
[time=2725] Now, Kelly said you had that piece of paper.
[time=2727] Hold that piece of paper up.
[time=2729] Well, everybody, look how high this thing is, my word.
[time=2732] Would everybody admit this that inside of these walls right now, you feel comfortable?
[time=2739] You feel comfortable? Anybody feel threatened? Good.
[time=2744] Get a pen, pencil, whatever you'd like, pew rack in front of you. They're up there.
[time=2748] This is what I'd like you to do.
[time=2750] For those of you that would like to try this, we're going to leave this up here.
[time=2755] I make it. We're going to leave this up here.
[time=2757] Go to your neighbor next to you in the pew and walk through the illustration with them.
[time=2762] You, as the believer, them as the seeker, if you don't feel comfortable, don't do that.
[time=2767] That's fine.
[time=2768] But what I want you to do is I want you to try while this illustration is up there, okay?
[time=2773] Now, remember, you got two ways for the illustration. Do and done.
[time=2777] They could do things. More a life. Go to church.
[time=2781] Love their mom and dad, whatever.
[time=2786] Key thing at the end, don't ever forget this question.
[time=2789] I've never heard it better than this.
[time=2792] And where are you relative to crossing the bridge?
[time=2798] Where are you at?
[time=2800] You personalize it by looking at that individual and saying, "Where do you stand?" Do you find yourself way back here? Do you find yourself here?
[time=2809] Some will say, "I think I'm right about there." Next question, right after that.
[time=2816] Is there any reason why you wouldn't want to cross that bridge right now?
[time=2824] You've closed it.
[time=2826] Now, you may be in a restaurant. It may not be very comfortable for them to do that.
[time=2830] Take the time out. Go someplace where it is, okay?
[time=2834] Where are you in crossing the bridge?
[time=2837] I think I'm right about there.
[time=2840] Well, is there any reason why you wouldn't want to cross the bridge right now?
[time=2845] Two key questions at the very end of the illustration.
[time=2848] You did great. Good job. Thanks, Kelly.
[time=2851] Hey, thanks for doing that.
[time=2852] Is that all right? Hope that was helpful.
[time=2854] Hope it was encouraging and got you thinking about conversations that count.
[time=2858] So hang with me here. We're going to finish this up.
[time=2860] So having built an authentic relationship within which conversations of substance are occurring, you can at any time invite them to join you.
[time=2869] You can at any time invite them to join us for what we call our third step, which is right there in the middle.
[time=2875] Sunday morning worship. Sunday morning worship. Sunday mornings together.
[time=2879] We're commanded to be here, and we will be.
[time=2883] We need to be here. We have to be here in order for an Acts 2 church to really happen.
[time=2889] For the family here at Blackhawk, this is prime time.
[time=2892] It's huge. It's our time to worship God.
[time=2895] It's our time to learn and be challenged from God's Word.
[time=2898] It's our time to be together.
[time=2900] But anybody, anybody out there willing to investigate the truth, anybody you or I know who is seeking, searching, trying to grasp what it means to come to faith in Christ, anyone trying to understand what it looks like to live in the family of God.
[time=2915] They are welcome. They are welcome to join us any time.
[time=2920] Let's be clear here at this point.
[time=2922] Sunday mornings at Blackhawk. Please hear me.
[time=2925] I really want to be as clear as I can be.
[time=2927] I'm going to answer a lot of questions that I continue to hear in saying this.
[time=2932] So, track with me at Blackhawk on Sunday mornings.
[time=2936] We are believer targeted.
[time=2940] We are believer targeted. Everything we do here on Sunday mornings, all the planning and prayer and programming that takes place, everything that gets brought to this family on a Sunday morning, gets brought to those with the intention of building, encouraging, edifying, equipping the family of God.
[time=2959] Blackhawk is on Sunday mornings believer targeted.
[time=2963] Number one, secondly, we are seeker friendly.
[time=2968] We are seeker friendly in that order.
[time=2971] We are believer targeted. We are seeker friendly.
[time=2974] Now, let's be extremely clear with regard to Sunday mornings being seeker friendly.
[time=2980] Being seeker friendly has absolutely nothing to do with what we teach or don't teach.
[time=2986] Has absolutely nothing to do with what we sing or don't sing.
[time=2990] What we say or don't say what we do or don't do.
[time=2994] Being seeker friendly has only to do with how safe,
[time=3000] welcomed and loved.
[time=3002] You and I leave them feeling when they're with us.
[time=3005] And for the record, let me say it again.
[time=3007] I believe they should feel safe.
[time=3013] I sometimes hear people say we shouldn't try to make them feel comfortable.
[time=3018] They should feel convicted.
[time=3020] If anything, we should try and make them feel uncomfortable.
[time=3023] And I hear that and I cringe because I completely disagree.
[time=3029] I want to ask them, who made it our job to bring conviction?
[time=3033] Since when did that get put under our job description in this thing called Christian living?
[time=3039] When did it become up to us to make anyone feel uncomfortable?
[time=3044] Last I checked that was the Holy Spirit's job.
[time=3048] God's Word says again and again, He will judge.
[time=3052] He will bring conviction.
[time=3054] He will in His time and in His place bring whatever spiritual clarity He's going to bring.
[time=3059] We, us, you and I, will live out and teach a culturally relevant, doctrinally pure message.
[time=3068] We will be a safe place to hear a dangerous life-giving message.
[time=3074] Some didn't say this.
[time=3075] Well, okay.
[time=3076] How long?
[time=3078] Some have said this to me.
[time=3080] How long, then?
[time=3081] How long are you as if it were up to me?
[time=3085] How long will you, then, let them sit in these pews feeling comfortable?
[time=3091] Am I answer?
[time=3092] What do you think my answer is?
[time=3095] As long as God takes, as long as He takes, it's not my job.
[time=3101] And you know what?
[time=3102] It's not yours to make them feel anything.
[time=3105] It's our job to proclaim and represent the truth.
[time=3109] And we'll do that.
[time=3111] But in the meantime, we'll let God do what God's going to do with them and His time and place.
[time=3116] We'll do our best to be clear.
[time=3118] We won't shy away from anything.
[time=3120] Believe or targeted, seek or friendly.
[time=3123] We'll welcome unchurched, unsaved, searching people for as long as it takes.
[time=3127] And don't forget why.
[time=3130] Please, hang on to this.
[time=3132] Don't forget why.
[time=3133] We're so ready and so willing and so committed to do that.
[time=3138] As ready, write this down because the stakes are as high as it gets.
[time=3143] The stakes are as high as it gets.
[time=3146] Lives are on the line.
[time=3148] Eternity hangs in the balance.
[time=3151] It's that important.
[time=3153] Do you realize?
[time=3155] I think you did.
[time=3156] Did you comprehend two weeks ago when that sweet gal stood on this stage and said what she said?
[time=3163] Do you realize that first of all, her life got saved?
[time=3168] But did you step back and realize?
[time=3170] Like I did.
[time=3171] And I didn't realize this until that morning when prior to before all of you were even up, she was here praying and thinking through and practicing what she was going to say.
[time=3181] And there next to her set her daughter.
[time=3185] And her husband was taking the other daughter to the nursery.
[time=3191] And it dawns on me.
[time=3192] It's not just a life.
[time=3194] Every life people represents a family.
[time=3197] Every life represents an entirely different sphere of influence.
[time=3201] And little girls now are getting to know about Jesus.
[time=3204] And a marriage now has a chance.
[time=3206] And people got saved because we were willing, you and I, to be a church that gave ourselves to that kind of ministry.
[time=3215] It's life and death.
[time=3217] And don't kid yourself and don't allow yourself to be lulled to sleep by a culture and an enemy that wants to get you thinking otherwise.
[time=3226] Because it's just not true.
[time=3228] If millions of man hours get spent trying to cure cancer, if millions of people get relief in war-torn countries, if millions of dollars get spent saving whales, owls and trees, we can do everything possible to build trust-filled relationships.
[time=3244] Full of conversations that count and we can and we will go out of our way to provide a Sunday morning setting that the believer targeted and church-based
[time=3255] is absolutely wide open for them to come and be a part of.
[time=3261] That's the heartbeat.
[time=3263] That's what makes us tick.
[time=3264] That's what I hope and dream.
[time=3266] Our perspective will be and will remain for years and years.
[time=3271] Now, I want to tell you one last thing and then we're going to close.
[time=3276] I get excited. Sorry.
[time=3279] We learned this.
[time=3281] And then when I sat down when Ty was doing this thing, I'm just going to go ahead and do this.
[time=3285] I put this thing in my mouth and it's been hard talking.
[time=3288] So there.
[time=3290] The last five minutes I've been trying to keep this thing up in my lip.
[time=3293] So, you know, but we're friends.
[time=3295] I can do that, right?
[time=3298] We learned this recently.
[time=3300] Thanks for doing that, Ty.
[time=3302] We learned this and I would be remiss if I didn't pass this along to you because it was a huge, it was just an enormous revelation to me.
[time=3314] I don't know why I didn't see it before, but I'm sure thankful that some people were willing to kind of pass it along to us, you know, here in leadership and it's making a difference even now.
[time=3325] Watch this.
[time=3326] We've kind of always approached this, this mission thing, you know,
[time=3332] these four E's and naturally, I think, not that you thought this, but I know we kind of have thought this for a long time.
[time=3339] Naturally, if you take the four E's and you had them in a circle like this and you just kind of divided the circle up into, you know, you just kind of said, okay, we're going to do an E.
[time=3350] We're going to do an E and we're going to do an E.
[time=3353] And you kind of just divide that thing up and you throw an E there and you throw an E there and you throw an E there and you throw an E there.
[time=3359] So we thought, you know what, there's our church, there's our four E's, and we'll just give all the effort we can to all four E's and evangelism and edification and equipping and exaltation.
[time=3371] And we'll be a really balanced church.
[time=3373] And we'll work really hard and give resources and time and energy to all four E's
[time=3379] and kind of an equal, equal energy, equal resource, equal time.
[time=3384] Oh, God, please help us get it done.
[time=3386] Well, here's what we learned.
[time=3392] Equal input.
[time=3395] And what do you think about this now?
[time=3397] Equal input does not guarantee equal result.
[time=3405] Now, I want to point out just a couple of things.
[time=3410] If you were the enemy and you wanted to in your effort to thwart the church, if you were the enemy and it was everything you could do to try to somehow stifle the kingdom of God from being advanced, let me ask you a question.
[time=3425] Where would you?
[time=3426] Is there anything you could do?
[time=3427] I don't know.
[time=3428] Let me try to somehow stifle the kingdom of God from being advanced.
[time=3433] Let me ask you a question.
[time=3434] Where would you as the enemy draw your battle line?
[time=3438] When you looked at this, where would you try to wreak havoc?
[time=3441] Where would you try to instill discouragement?
[time=3443] Where would you try to plant some procrastination?
[time=3446] Go ahead, say it.
[time=3448] Down here, exaltation, equipping edification?
[time=3453] No.
[time=3454] I don't think so.
[time=3455] I think if I were the enemy and I wanted to make a difference and somehow thwart this thing called the church, I would take all of my arsenal.
[time=3463] I would take everything I had in my bag, and I would throw it right at the church in this area of evangelism.
[time=3470] Because if he can stop you and I there, if he can shut this process down right there, it's over.
[time=3477] I mean, for all intents and purposes, he's done his job.
[time=3480] Are you with me?
[time=3483] That right there.
[time=3484] So here's what we're learning.
[time=3485] We're learning that though we believe all of these are important.
[time=3488] I hope you've sensed and heard that in us.
[time=3490] Though all of these are important, there has got to be a willingness in your heart and mind to understand that probably, probably we're going to need to make this evangelism e a little bit bigger.
[time=3504] Sorry, the pin's not working so good.
[time=3505] We'll work on that.
[time=3506] But I think you get the point.
[time=3508] Keep the other ones there.
[time=3509] Keep giving time and resources and efforts.
[time=3512] But that e, this e that we've discussed this morning, your willingness and mind to absolutely and completely embrace that has got to be huge.
[time=3522] Probably bigger.
[time=3524] Probably more time.
[time=3525] Probably more effort.
[time=3526] Probably more prayer.
[time=3528] Probably more sacrifice in that e right there
[time=3534] for the rest of it to really begin to work.
[time=3536] For the rest of it to really, really happen.
[time=3538] I hope you'll give that some thought.
