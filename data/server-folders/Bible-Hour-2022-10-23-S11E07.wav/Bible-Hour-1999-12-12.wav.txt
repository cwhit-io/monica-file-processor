[time=1130] Born crucified, we started the series last week and I want to continue this week and
[time=1136] you know last week if you were here, you'll remember that we revisited something.
[time=1142] We revisited the greatest decision ever made in all of time.
[time=1147] We revisited last week God's great love for you and for me and this amazing decision that
[time=1153] was born out of His great love.
[time=1156] We talked last week about Mary, this young woman, this young virgin girl and we saw how
[time=1163] that decision of God's, that sacrifice that He made, this miracle, this woman all led
[time=1169] to this thing called the virgin birth.
[time=1171] And it is the virgin birth that kind of stands at the center of this season that we celebrate.
[time=1178] God the Father brings salvation to a lost and dying world.
[time=1183] We said last week through Mary and the Holy Spirit and His only Son comes and is born
[time=1190] in a manger and then dies sacrificially on the cross so that you and I might know the Father.
[time=1196] We talked about the absolute without a doubt, no questions asked, the absolute necessity
[time=1204] of the virgin birth when it comes to the bigger issue of our faith, the truth, the doctrine,
[time=1210] the relationship that we have and share with God.
[time=1214] We talked about how the virgin birth is absolutely vital.
[time=1218] Our faith and what we believe cannot exist without this event that we celebrate this season.
[time=1226] It's all inextricably linked to this birth and this week as the story and reality of
[time=1232] Christmas intensified in my own heart.
[time=1235] This week for me as I continue to look at this story, as I continue to and got to be a part
[time=1241] of this tree and all that is going on here and all that's going on in my life, again
[time=1247] as the season kind of progressive as all that is happening kind of just continue to kind of grow and intensify in my own heart.
[time=1255] For whatever reasons, I couldn't get away.
[time=1259] I couldn't get away from the mind-boggling, life-giving, life-saving transaction that took place in that stable that night 2,000 years ago and I use the word transaction and
[time=1271] I don't use it lightly.
[time=1274] Webster defines transaction like this, Webster says a transaction is a payment rendered for
[time=1280] a desired acquisition, a payment rendered for a desired acquisition and make no mistake
[time=1286] about it.
[time=1287] We remind you again this morning a price was paid on that morning, a price was paid and
[time=1295] I don't want us to forget as we continue to think this whole scenario through, I don't want us this morning to forget the person of Christ and here's what I mean by that.
[time=1307] So many times as we think about and engage ourselves and all that is true and about Christmas
[time=1315] as we tell the story, as we see the plays, as we sing the songs, as we come to the tree even.
[time=1321] So much is said about God the Father.
[time=1325] So much is said about the Holy Spirit and Mary and what happened there.
[time=1329] So much is said about Joseph.
[time=1331] So much is said about the shepherds and the angels and the heavenly hosts.
[time=1335] We hear so much about them and we hear about Jesus but we hear about him and talk about
[time=1342] him and see him mainly cast in this drama as the baby.
[time=1348] He's the baby, he's the small child lying in the hay and that's true he was but I don't
[time=1355] want us this morning to forget the Son of God.
[time=1358] The Son of God our Lord played a huge part in this drama and he paid, he paid huge in
[time=1368] order to play it.
[time=1370] And I think we would be remiss this morning if at Christmastime especially we didn't stop
[time=1376] and take a close look at the one passage in all of Scripture that maybe best communicates this miracle, this price that was paid by the Son of God by the Lord Himself.
[time=1388] And if you know the Lord and I want you to sense this and I want you to know this and be reminded of this this morning, if you know the Lord this morning, this passage that we're
[time=1399] going to look at, this miracle that we're going to consider again should put you on your face with gratitude.
[time=1408] It should lay you low with thankfulness and it's a miracle that if you don't know the
[time=1414] Lord personally this morning has the potential of bringing you to your knees.
[time=1420] So be warned, it really does, it's a powerful, powerful picture.
[time=1425] Philippians chapter two, open your Bibles, please if you've brought them to Philippians.
[time=1430] Chapter two I want to look at chapter two verses five through eight.
[time=1436] Philippians chapter two verses five to eight.
[time=1441] Some of you know that this passage has come to be known as the kenosis, the kenosis passage.
[time=1447] It's a fancy theological term that simply means the emptying of oneself, kenosis.
[time=1455] The emptying of oneself and this passage, Philippians two, five to eight, it is the bottom line.
[time=1461] It is the bottom line on this whole incarnation thing.
[time=1466] Read with me, it says there in verse five, have this attitude in yourselves, which was also in Christ Jesus, who although he existed in the form of God, did not regard equality
[time=1478] with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself taking the form of a bondservant and
[time=1485] being made in the likeness of men and being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself
[time=1493] by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.
[time=1499] This passage reminds us that Christmas people, Christmas came at a cost.
[time=1504] Our Lord, someone once said, cleaned out the account, cleaned it out.
[time=1509] He left nothing in the bank, he brought everything he owned to the table as he embraced a painful
[time=1515] poverty and certain death.
[time=1519] This passage teaches the humiliation and in turn in the end of the passage, we see the exaltation of Christ, but it begins here in two, five through eight, it begins by showing
[time=1530] us and teaching us the humiliation of Christ, and that's what it was, it was humiliating.
[time=1539] Most importantly though, this passage will show us his deity, his deity, his divine nature
[time=1545] and the price that he paid so that you and I might live, and as we look at Philippians two, five to eight, you see three great truths, I mean they just jump out at you, three great
[time=1557] truths from this passage, and I want to tell you the three and then we're going to just jump in and take a look this morning and probably even next week at these three great truths from this passage that remind us of the miracle of what took place and the price
[time=1573] that our Lord paid and the role that he played in this drama, it is truly amazing.
[time=1579] Number one, you're going to see in Philippians two, privileged, present but not seized, and it was, privileged, it was present, privileged was right there, privileged like you and I
[time=1591] have never experienced, divine existence was right at his fingertips, I mean it was right
[time=1598] there, it was his, he didn't even have to reach out and take it, it was right there,
[time=1604] privileged was present, but in this case not seized, not laid hold of, verses five to six.
[time=1611] Secondly we're going to see in verse seven selfless service, not only was privilege not seized, what was seized was this mindset and attitude of selfless giving, selfless
[time=1622] service and then thirdly we're going to see this, the embodiment of sacrifice, the embodiment
[time=1629] of sacrifice, the Lord himself kind of defines, I mean he is, I mean it should be that way,
[time=1636] you should open up a Webster's turn to sacrifice and there should be a picture of the cross.
[time=1642] Our Lord in this passage and obviously in others, but in this one we will see Him truly defining what true sacrifice looks like.
[time=1651] Well let's jump back to the beginning, Philippians two, verses five and six, first point there, privileged, present, privileged, present but not seized.
[time=1661] Remember what it said there, have this attitude in yourselves, which was also in Christ Jesus who although He existed in the form of God did not regard equality with God a thing to
[time=1671] be grasped and we'll stop right there.
[time=1674] Paul affirms here in this passage that for all of eternity Jesus has been God.
[time=1680] It had been that way for all of eternity.
[time=1684] He shows us the deity of Christ and as you become more and more familiar with the scriptures
[time=1690] you learn and see that it's not just with Paul that this vital and foundational truth is recorded and affirmed.
[time=1697] This idea, this truth, this principle, this fundamental truth to our faith of Jesus being
[time=1704] God is seeing several other places in the New Testament.
[time=1707] We don't have time this morning to go to the mall but let's go to a couple, just to refresh our minds and just to be reminded again of this truth and its implication in your life
[time=1718] in mind.
[time=1719] John chapter 1, turn in your Bibles if you will to John chapter 1.
[time=1724] Back there in the gospels just after Luke just before Acts, John chapter 1, and I want
[time=1731] you to look with me at verses 1 to 5, the deity of Christ, Jesus being God, now and for
[time=1741] all eternity past and future.
[time=1744] It says there, very first verse, John 1, 1 to 5, 1 to 5, says in the beginning what's
[time=1752] the word, stop right there, I want you to know the phrase the word is used synonymously
[time=1758] here in this passage, it's an Old Testament expression, the phrase the word is used synonymously
[time=1765] with the person of Jesus Christ, that's of whom John refers to here as he begins this
[time=1772] passage and talks about the word and you'll even see that phrase the word being given
[time=1778] kind of human qualities as the passage goes on but I just want to let you know that, that's Christ.
[time=1784] In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God, he was in
[time=1793] the beginning with God, all things came into being by him and apart from him nothing came
[time=1799] into being that has come into being, verse 4, in him was life and the life was the light
[time=1805] of men and the light shines in the darkness and the darkness did not comprehend it.
[time=1812] There you have it, in the beginning was the word Jesus Christ and he was with God and he was God.
[time=1819] Now it's interesting, John part of the Gospels right, one of the four authors and I want you
[time=1826] to remember back to last week what we said about the four gospel authors, do you remember I told you that each of the four always had a specific purpose in writing, there was something
[time=1838] about Jesus, there was something about Christ that in each of the four Gospels they want you to see and take notice of.
[time=1846] Matthew, remember his whole purpose in writing the book of Matthew, that account of the gospel
[time=1852] Matthew's desire was to see you and I and the readers back here understand that Jesus
[time=1858] was king, that he was Messiah, remember that?
[time=1863] Mark, when you read Mark the theme that comes to the forefront in Mark is that Mark wants you to see that Jesus was a servant, Jesus as servant, servant of man, Luke, Luke wants
[time=1876] you to know more than anything, Luke in his writing depicts for us the humanity of Christ, he wants you to see Jesus as a man, well guess what John's purpose was, John as he writes
[time=1889] wants you and I the reader to see and to know that Jesus was who, God, and this was really
[time=1898] fun for me this week as I studied and looked at this it was so sweet to kind of see this
[time=1904] connection here, Matthew and Luke, again and you'll remember back to last week I referred
[time=1910] to both of these, Matthew and Luke in their attempt to bring their point across at the
[time=1916] beginning of their gospel accounts they give us these things called gene, geney what genealogies
[time=1922] and the genealogies they gave us tie Christ back to some, some human lineage, some line
[time=1930] of parents and grandparents and all of that to show that he was who they said he was, well
[time=1937] guess what in John there's not some big huge genealogy John gives us a genealogy and guess
[time=1943] how many verses it takes, one here's the genealogy that John gives us to prove the deity of Christ
[time=1951] in the beginning was the word, period, done no more, in the beginning was the word and
[time=1959] the word Jesus Christ was with God and the word Jesus Christ was God, end of genealogy
[time=1967] that simple, that powerful, that profound Jesus Christ was and is God from eternity past
[time=1974] Colossians 1, Colossians 1 it won't come up on the screen but let's turn there anyway
[time=1980] Colossians 1, Colossians 1, 15 to 17 Jesus in eternity past was God, he existed in
[time=1996] the form of God, he was deity, says here in verse 15 if Colossians 1 and he is the image
[time=2002] of the invisible God, the first born of all creation for by him all things were created
[time=2008] both in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible whether thrones or dominions
[time=2014] or rulers or authorities, all things have been created by him and for him, verse 17 and
[time=2022] he is before all things and in him all things hold together, are you getting the picture,
[time=2029] are you developing an idea in your mind and are you seeing what his existence was like
[time=2036] prior to this birth that we celebrate, I hope you are, one more Hebrews 1 back at the back
[time=2042] of the New Testament right there just before you get to James, Hebrews, Hebrews 1 turn
[time=2051] your Bibles there, first chapter, first three verses, Hebrews 1 verses 1 to 3 says this
[time=2059] God after he spoke long ago to the fathers and the prophets in many portions and in many
[time=2066] ways, in these last days has spoken to us in his son whom he appointed heir of all things
[time=2073] through whom also he made the world and he is the radiance, the son is the radiance of
[time=2079] his the father's glory and the exact representation of his nature and upholds all things by the
[time=2087] word of his power, the son's power, when he had made purification of sins he sat down
[time=2093] at the right hand of the majesty on high.
[time=2098] The word of God people is consistent, it is clear and it affirms again and again, Jesus
[time=2104] was God, Jesus is God, now back to Philippians, back to our passage in Philippians 2, Philippians
[time=2114] 2 right there in verse 6, there's one more interesting note from the first part of verse 6 that I want us to catch, back in verse 6 it says who although he existed in the form
[time=2126] of God did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, that word form, although
[time=2134] he existed in the form of God, I just want to, let me do this please, I just want to pound
[time=2142] this point home, I just want to again and I couldn't get away from it this week, wasn't even planning on doing this passage but in my heart as I thought about it and this idea of Christ and who he is and who he was and what he gave up and it just kind of overwhelmed
[time=2157] me, so I just really want to help you and I again get really, really clear on what took
[time=2163] place here and how significant it really is, that word form, interesting word and you guys
[time=2169] know me well enough by now to know that I don't like to and we don't, we don't spend a whole lot of time each week getting kind of lost and tangled in a bunch of exegesis and Greek and Hebrew words, that's okay but this morning I want to tell you about a Greek
[time=2185] word, I want to tell you about its meaning and I want to tell you and I want you to see for yourself how in the divine process of Scripture being inspired and recorded certain words
[time=2195] were chosen that just have a flat out powerful message, okay so this word form, he existed
[time=2203] in the form of God, in the Greek there are two words that were used consistently and
[time=2210] only two words for that word form, there is the word morfei and there is the word schema,
[time=2216] morfei schema alright, you're with me a little lesson here in Greek, two words in the language
[time=2222] of that day, morfei, first use okay, meant this, morfei is the most fundamental and essential
[time=2231] form of something that which never changes, that which never does or never can be altered,
[time=2239] morfei, the fundamental basic form of something that is essential and non-changing, it never
[time=2246] changes no matter what, schema on the other hand that word is the outward form which changes
[time=2254] from time to time from one circumstance to the next, example, we are all in this room this morning, we all have human form, we are all humans, we all share in human form, morfei
[time=2267] or schema, what is that, morfei, all of us have human form, now all of us are fundamentally
[time=2274] and unalterably human but our schema is different, we have male/female right, we have young/old,
[time=2284] we have brown eyes, we have blue eyes, we have Hoosiers, we have boiler makers, you with
[time=2290] me, sorry Hoosiers by the way about that whole Indiana state thing, it's a hard hard hard
[time=2296] morning I know, fundamental nature never changes, we are humans right, some things about us
[time=2303] though change, that's schema, now which word, morfei or schema, do you think God used as
[time=2311] he inspires Paul to use, as Paul writes and as he pens Philippians 2, 6, which word do
[time=2317] you think he inspires Paul to use in describing Jesus possessing the form of God, morfei,
[time=2327] mental, essential, non-changing, unalterable, no matter what, morfei is the word that he
[time=2334] used, his unchangeable being is divine and though his outer schema may alter, he remained
[time=2341] and remains today in his very essence divine, so all right, having seen that and having
[time=2349] said all of that about all that he was, about all that he possessed, about all that he embodied,
[time=2356] being taken just you know these last 15, 20 minutes, to just once again establish who
[time=2362] he was and what he possessed and what he had done in eternity past and all that he was responsible for and all that he owned and all that he had at his fingertips, having seen
[time=2373] all of that, what does he do? Well hang on because this is where it starts to get mind
[time=2379] boggling, this is where it starts to really penetrate the heart. Verse 6, he did not regard
[time=2386] equality with God a thing to be grasped, that's what he did. In light of all of that, he looks
[time=2394] at all of the right smack dab in the eye and says no, I do not regard, he did not regard
[time=2401] equality with God a thing to be grasped because of the mission he had, because of what he knew needed to take place, grasped, interesting word, again do you see it there in your text?
[time=2415] Your translation may read differently, but the idea there is that he didn't regard this divinity, this deity, this equality with God a thing to be grasped, in the Greek this
[time=2426] word means to seize, it means to grab hold of, it means to clutch at something and to hold
[time=2433] it close to your chest. What Paul is saying is that the heart and mindset of our Lord
[time=2439] was such that he refused to seize or clutch the equality with God, the privilege that
[time=2446] was his, he did not jealously hold it to his chest but instead willingly laid it down
[time=2453] for the sake of men. I was thinking about that, I was doing more than thinking about
[time=2460] it, I was picturing what that looks like, you do the same, picture what that looks like,
[time=2469] it's hard for us I know to picture what that looks like with him, it's okay to think about it and I want you to picture what it looked like for him but think about what it looks like with others, think about people in your life, think about those you bump into and think
[time=2483] about this idea of grasping and clutching on to things that are of privilege. I was thinking
[time=2492] this week, I bump into people all the time, I just do many of you and so many times and
[time=2498] I think you'll know what I'm talking about, the first thing they, so many times the first thing they seem to want me to know about them is what? It's how much they make, how much
[time=2513] they have, how much they've done, you know what I mean? So many times it seems that people
[time=2522] right out of the gate it's the first thing they want to make sure we get clear on, this
[time=2528] is who I am and this is what I have and this is what I'm going to have and this is where I'm going and this is how I got there and you know my experience is that whenever I
[time=2539] bump into, when I bump into and when you bump into the opposite of that isn't it refreshing?
[time=2548] Isn't it nice? I've got a good friend, a real good friend who I've gotten to know over
[time=2554] the years and I'll never laugh about it to this day. The kind of guy and you've probably bumped into these guys as well, he's the kind of guy when I first met him, the level of
[time=2565] kindness, the level of thoughtfulness, the interest in me, the desire to get to know me, encourage me, was just unending and I tried my best to reciprocate and we started
[time=2576] to become friends and our families began to spend time together and I'm just kind of getting to know him and you know in the first couple, two, three, I don't know weeks, you're
[time=2586] asking questions and I find out you know in some conversation where he works, find out
[time=2592] where he works but you know, boom, we don't stay on that topic too long and I didn't realize it then but I did later and we don't spend too much time on that topic and said
[time=2602] we get back to just life and family and things and stuff and spiritual stuff and sports and
[time=2609] all kinds of stuff and he just over times becomes just a very, very dear friend, thoughtful
[time=2616] acts, considerate stuff, I mean really encouraging me and both my wife and our family, well come
[time=2622] to find out, I think, I think almost six months later, you know on this company that he worked
[time=2630] for, huge, huge, well I come to find out six months later, he runs the thing, he's in charge
[time=2639] of the place, it's his and I never knew it, never knew it, never heard, never heard about
[time=2646] that once ever, had to ask him, is it true, somebody told me you're like yeah and I thought
[time=2656] wow how refreshing, did you get that picture, privilege present but not seized and do you
[time=2662] see what that does, I mean that's just one example and we have the ultimate example right here in Christ and let me try and say it to you this way, here's as I look at that guy who's a good friend and an example to me, it reminds me of this, I wrote it down, humility
[time=2678] breeds servanthood, real simple I know but hold on to that, write that one down, think
[time=2685] about that, humility, when in your heart there is this willingness to not seize what might rightfully be yours, to not talk about, to not promote, to not put forth the accomplishments
[time=2696] and the gains and the possessions when there is this humility that kind of begins to reside
[time=2702] in your heart and life and when it is a true humility, it promotes and it begins to exude
[time=2709] I think from your life a true sense of humility, humility breeds servanthood and that's exactly
[time=2716] what we see exemplified in the ultimate sense right here in this passage, keep going with
[time=2722] me, verse 7, verse 7 our second point selfless service, privilege was present but it wasn't
[time=2729] seized, instead he was humble and in humility it bred a sense of ultimate service, selfless
[time=2738] service, what does it say there in 7, but he emptied himself, he didn't grasp equality with God no, verse 7 he empties himself taking the form of a bond servant and being made
[time=2750] in the likeness of men, second Corinthians 5 again a couple other passages just to continue
[time=2758] to try and reiterate these truths, second Corinthians 5 21 says he made him who knew no sin, remember
[time=2766] this verse, he made him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf that we might become the
[time=2774] righteousness of God in him, yeah you might read through that and just kinda go well that's good but don't just read through it and go yeah that's good, understand, understand again all that we just talked about, understand again in your mind, all that we just described as far as who he was and what he possessed and what he was like and the kind of character
[time=2795] and place and position that he had in the scheme of God's kingdom and that person the
[time=2801] son of God became sin, he became sin on our behalf that we might become the righteousness
[time=2811] of God in him, on later in 2 Corinthians in chapter 8 verse 9 write this one down as
[time=2817] well, 2 Corinthians 8, 9 for you know it says the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ that though
[time=2824] he was rich and I hope again you're getting reminded this morning of the fact that his
[time=2830] rich, I mean his wealth, I mean it was so far passed and we'll talk about this a little bit later but it was so far beyond anything most of us are even able to comprehend and
[time=2841] it says that though he was rich yet for your sake he became poor that you through his poverty
[time=2850] might become rich, might have, might possess everything that he in fact he himself gave
[time=2858] up in order to get you in order to have you, you'll notice in that word there in that
[time=2866] verse there it says that he emptied, he emptied himself, William Barkley, William Barkley in his commentary on Philippians said this the translation of emptied is powerful and that it brings to mind the pouring of something out until there remains absolutely nothing.
[time=2883] The glory of divinity was given up willingly in order to become man he empties himself
[time=2889] of this deity to take upon himself his humanity it is useless to ask how we can only stand
[time=2896] in awe at the sight of him who is Almighty God by nature here on this earth hungry, here
[time=2903] on this earth weary, here on this earth in tears, here in the use of a powerful word
[time=2911] picture is the saving truth that he who possessed so much comes to us who possessed so little
[time=2918] in quote.
[time=2920] Now I want you to think for just a moment and I really want you to try to get your arms around this okay and we're not going to get through the end of this list even much less the three points here in this passage but that's okay we'll just jump back in next week but I want you as we kind of conclude here we'll just go through maybe a couple I really want you to try your best to in your own heart and in your own mind having just thought
[time=2945] about and hopefully you've been tracking with us this morning and as we think about who Christ was where he lived where he existed all that he had been given and all that he
[time=2958] owned and all that was rightfully his all that he all that he had been a part of all
[time=2964] that he had his hands on you get the picture I want you to think with me what was it like
[time=2972] for him to have given up all that he gave up and I want to invite you this morning and
[time=2978] we're going to just go through a list here of some specifics and I want you to think about the specifics that he gave up and I want you to sense as best you can in our own
[time=2989] little finite minds I want us to try our best to understand what it would have been like
[time=2996] to be him and again see all over again this price that he paid to be a part of this drama
[time=3003] think with me about some things that were given up by him the son of God who existed
[time=3009] in the form of God what did he sacrifice so that we could have life number one write these down if you want to we're going to go through five eventually five things five things
[time=3020] that Christ our Lord gave up and his love for us and in his willingness to come and be
[time=3027] emptied of his deity number one he gave up heavenly glory he gave up heavenly glory think
[time=3036] about that don't forget now his address his address was heaven his address was prior
[time=3044] to this glory he was there and while on earth lying in a trough in a manger or while laying
[time=3051] on a tree being murdered he lived on earth knowing in his mind what he had given up and
[time=3059] what he had given up was nothing shy of nothing short of a face to face relationship with
[time=3066] God Almighty minute by minute moment by moment day by day a face to face with God Almighty
[time=3074] he gave up living with God he gave up living in God's presence he gave up living in the
[time=3080] midst of the shekinah glory of God that was around him and in him and on him constantly
[time=3086] daily as he existed in paradise in bliss in absolute glory a place called heaven
[time=3094] look back again at the gospel of John John 17 5
[time=3101] John 17 5
[time=3107] think about all that he gave up especially as it refers to this idea of heavenly glory
[time=3115] John 17 5 it says this and now glorified Jesus speaking here and praying to the father
[time=3124] while he run earth he says in verse 5 and now glorify thou me together with thyself father
[time=3132] with the glory which I had with thee before the world was he was there and all of it and again I
[time=3141] know when we talk about a heaven and glory in shekinah and the present sometimes it's hard for us
[time=3147] to to comprehend but I'm just hoping you'll just stretch your mind a bit this morning he gave up all of that that was his existence that's what it looked like and he gave it up for a pile of hay in a stable in the middle of the night and a life of 33 or so years a brutal death for you and for me
[time=3171] well we'll stop there we've got four more things to look at next week and we'll also jump into the last part of the passage let me let me let me say this to you though as we go let me just
[time=3181] give you some things to take home with you and I mean that I really want you to be able to leave with some things written down I hope you'll write them down I hope that you will not only write them down I hope that you'll talk with your kids about it I hope that you'll talk with your friends about it some truth to take home some truth some Christmas truth to take home even just from
[time=3201] the first couple of verses okay number one is this go back to the beginning of our passage Philippians
[time=3208] to five to eight and I want you to look right now or later today look at verse five verse five starts
[time=3215] with this saying have this attitude have this attitude in you that was in Christ Jesus
[time=3226] have this attitude and I really want you to think about that hold on to that thought
[time=3232] and and and try to get the the arms of your mind around the thought that this attitude is what we've been describing just so far this morning what he did what he privileged for instance
[time=3244] privilege not not seized a life of humility a life of humbleness that leads to a sense and
[time=3253] a life and activity marked by servanthood this attitude of of ultimate giving of being
[time=3260] others centered today tomorrow this week these next three weeks as this whole thing kind of
[time=3266] comes to a head at the end of the month have this attitude have this ad talk about I mean read this
[time=3273] passage again tonight talk about it with your kids talk about it with your friends talk about it with your spouse you put your own descriptive terms answer this question what kind of attitude
[time=3284] did Christ have verse five says we're to have this attitude and we're to have it daily and I'm
[time=3291] asking you to give it some thought and give it some prayer and give it some effort and have in your heart this attitude over these next few weeks especially privilege present but not seized
[time=3303] selfless service the embodiment of sacrifice have this attitude think about it talk about it tonight
[time=3312] will you secondly I want to tell you this real basic but I think again so very appropriate especially in the midst of all that we're seeing and all that we're learning and being reminded of express
[time=3324] your gratitude do not let a day go by I mean don't don't let a couple hours go by
[time=3331] over the next couple two three weeks and not individually as a couple as a family as a group
[time=3339] of friends in a small group whatever that looks like we don't let don't let two hours go by in the next three weeks or so without saying thank you without understanding in your heart and again
[time=3353] we just got into it this morning but without don't let a few hours go by without running through
[time=3359] your mind's eye the amazing truth and the amazing sacrifice and the amazing story
[time=3366] that is involved in you having a savior do not let these weeks go by without expressing gratitude
[time=3375] I mean write write notes journal stuff share your thanks again with your kids and your friends
[time=3382] but do everything you can to be as thankful and to be as appreciative and to be as grateful as you
[time=3388] possibly can be he was born crucified don't forget that born to die you can see it on the screen
[time=3397] right there I think it's going to come up baby Jesus was born to be crucified remember this he came not just for Bethlehem but for Calvary not just to live with us but to die for us
[time=3407] born with love in his eyes and the cross in his heart he was born crucified let's pray
[time=3414] Father as we go this morning we would ask I would ask and I hope many many in this
[time=3421] room this morning would ask for your strength for your reminders and for the the energy needed
[time=3428] to face to face each other to face this world to face the days of even this next week with a real
[time=3436] and true sense of purpose God it's amazing to look back at this fundamental passage that's full of
[time=3443] so much truth and God it's truth reminds us that your son our Lord Jesus paid an enormous price
[time=3450] what he did is inconceivable and yet God he did it because his love for you was that great because
[time=3456] his love for us was that great and we stand here this morning as a family as folks that know you
[time=3464] personally thankful grateful for that kind of sacrifice thank you Lord for giving up as much
[time=3472] as you did then God I pray if there would be anybody anybody here with us this morning anybody
[time=3479] listening that at this point hasn't unwrapped that gift hasn't come face to face with what it
[time=3488] means to have sin forgiven hasn't come face to face with what it means to live in relationship
[time=3494] with a God whose love for them was this great that this kind of a sacrifice was made God we would
[time=3500] pray that they would come to know you that they would trust you that they would come before you confessing their sin asking you and inviting you to to be a part of the central part of the major
[time=3512] part of their heart and life God we would pray that they would be willing to exercise true faith
[time=3518] in you thank you so very much for this message thank you for Paul and what he writes here in
[time=3525] Philippians 2 and God our prayer is that you would help us to keep these truths at the forefront
