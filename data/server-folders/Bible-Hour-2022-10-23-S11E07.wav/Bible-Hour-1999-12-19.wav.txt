[time=22] (gentle music) (upbeat music)
[time=44] - Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service
[time=51] of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=53] Thank you for joining us.
[time=55] We trust that the music and message from God's word will help you in your Christian walk.
[time=60] Now let's join our service.
[time=61] [MUSIC - 759 seconds]
[time=837] (gentle music)
[time=1017] (gentle music) (gentle music) (gentle music) (gentle music) (gentle music) (gentle music) (gentle music) (applause) - We ran across some more great quotes this week, just had to share a couple with you from some kids.
[time=1061] A teacher asked her students to write a note to God.
[time=1064] A bunch of love here in these. I always love when somebody gives me these. Teacher asks her students to write a note to God.
[time=1069] And so these were just a few of the ones that got turned in. Dear God, this comes from Larry.
[time=1075] Dear God, maybe Cain and Abel would not kill each other so much if they had their own rooms. It worked with my brother.
[time=1082] (audience laughs) This one comes from Nan. Nan, N-A-N, Nan. Dear God, I bet it's very hard for you to love all of everybody in the whole world.
[time=1093] There are only four people in our family and I can never do it.
[time=1098] (audience laughs) Dear God, this comes from Anita. Dear God, is it true my dad won't get into heaven if he uses his bowling words in the house?
[time=1106] (audience laughs) Dear God, did you mean for the giraffe to look like that or was it an accident?
[time=1113] (audience laughs) From Norma and one more. Dear God, this one's from Marsha. My brother told me about being born, but it doesn't sound right.
[time=1120] He was just kidding, right? That was from Marsha. Kids. Got to love him.
[time=1127] Hey, let me ask you if you would to open your Bibles to Philippians, chapter two. Philippians, chapter two.
[time=1134] And that's where we're going to jump in here in just a moment.
[time=1137] Having spent some significant time, if you remember, two weeks ago, looking at and discussing the miraculous virgin birth of Christ, I had planned on just kind of going on to the narratives of Matthew and Luke
[time=1151] and look again at the events and individuals that made up this unfolding drama that we call Christmas.
[time=1157] And we will in fact do that next week, but we couldn't leave the miracle of his birth.
[time=1162] Without an even closer look at the miracle of his selfless love, his selfless service, and his selfless sacrifice.
[time=1170] There was no way that we could even begin to celebrate Christmas.
[time=1175] Talk about Mary and Joseph. Thank God the Father. Speak of the shepherds, the angels and the wise men,
[time=1181] and not give some time to a thoughtful study and reminder concerning our Lord, God the Son,
[time=1188] and the role that he played in this drama, the price that he paid, and all that he did.
[time=1194] And as we mentioned last week, his presence in the stable as the newborn babe is an enormous part of the story.
[time=1201] We realize that the picture of him as a small infant laying there in the hay,
[time=1208] one of the most powerful pictures there is of his dependent and helpless humanity.
[time=1214] Yet as you look to God's Word, you see that our Lord, God the Son was active in this Christmas drama
[time=1220] before he ever got laid in the manger, active in that there was a transaction that took place.
[time=1228] He paid an enormous price. Something was relinquished so that we could receive.
[time=1233] Something was given so that you and I could gain.
[time=1237] And we saw all of this last week as we look closely at what is probably the most powerful passage
[time=1244] in the entire New Testament for sure, possibly in all of Scripture when it comes to our Lord and the incarnation.
[time=1251] So I want us to look again if we could this morning at Philippians chapter 2 verses 5 to 8.
[time=1257] If you've got your Bibles, just follow along. Starting there in verse 5, it says this.
[time=1262] Have this attitude in yourselves, which was also in Christ Jesus, who although he existed in the form of God,
[time=1270] did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself,
[time=1276] taking the form of a bondservant and being made in the likeness of men and being found in appearance
[time=1284] as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.
[time=1292] Well that was our passage and we saw, excuse me, last week in verse 6, our first point.
[time=1300] And if you've got your notes from last week, you'll remember our first point was this privilege present, but not seized.
[time=1307] Privilege was present. Privilege was present in his life and in his existence like nothing else we've ever seen or experienced before.
[time=1317] Privilege was present, but not seized. Paul reminds us that for all of eternity Jesus had been God.
[time=1324] We saw John's words in the Gospel of John. Remember John chapter 1.
[time=1329] We saw John in the first chapter of his gospel account and those great words there in 1-1.
[time=1335] In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God.
[time=1340] Again the phrase, the Word they're being used synonymously with the person of Christ, the Son of God.
[time=1347] In the beginning was the Word. We saw back in chapter 2 of Philippians verse 6.
[time=1354] We saw God inspiring Paul to use the Greek word morphe.
[time=1358] Again remember there were two words he could have chosen, morphe or schema.
[time=1362] God inspires Paul as he pins the phrase, that one phrase there in verse 6 although he existed in the form of God.
[time=1373] That word for form there he inspires Paul to use morphe which means that which is fundamental or essential.
[time=1381] That which is unalterable regardless of circumstance or setting, morphe.
[time=1386] Jesus was God. He had all the power, he had all the prominence, he had all the privilege that was rightfully his.
[time=1394] But it wasn't seized. It wasn't taken hold of. It wasn't brought close to his chest.
[time=1401] No in fact the opposite took place. We saw it last week. He let it all go.
[time=1407] He let it all go for your sake. He let it all go for my sake.
[time=1412] Continue on there in verse 6, who although he existed in the form of God did not regard equality with God, a thing to be grasped.
[time=1423] We said that just the picture of our Lord derived from this one verse shows an unthinkable level, an uncommon, uncanny, radical level of humility.
[time=1436] And we see in life and we see in this passage. We see it in our Lord's life.
[time=1442] You've seen it in the lives of others who have evidenced a strong sense of humility.
[time=1447] And we see it right here in this very example that humility always breeds, and we said this last week, humility always breeds servanhood.
[time=1457] And that's what we had as our second point last week, point number two in this passage, selfless service.
[time=1464] Humility leading to number two, selfless service. Read there in verse 7.
[time=1469] Says, but he emptied himself. He emptied himself taking the form of a bond servant and being made in the likeness of men.
[time=1479] I want you to turn back over to your bulletins there, that memory verse that Ty just read through. Let's look at that again.
[time=1485] 2 Corinthians 8, 9. Selfless service here, that's what he did. He empties himself taking the form of a bond servant.
[time=1494] It says in 2 Corinthians 8, 9, "For you know that the grace, for you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, for your sake he became poor, that you through his poverty might become rich."
[time=1509] And I hope you catch the basic essence and truth of that verse. All that he had, all that he possessed, all that he owned, and it was much, was given up, freely sacrificed, selflessly given, and all that was given up, and all that was let go of.
[time=1527] We get in the end. He gives it up. He becomes poor, that we might in the end become rich. And this is where, you know, last week I felt like it was important for us to stop and pause for a bit. And we had just kind of started that.
[time=1541] I wanted us to pause and really consider and really give some thought to the pure selflessness of his sacrifice, the pure selflessness of his service.
[time=1554] I really wanted us to stop and give some thought to what did he really give up? What was it that he really let go of?
[time=1561] I mean, we talk about prominence, we talk about power, we talk about position, and he gave all of that up, but what came with those things?
[time=1570] And I want you in this season, and I want you today this morning, and I want you in your everyday walk with him to have a clearer, better, hopefully more amazing and encouraging understanding of what was actually given up.
[time=1586] He specifically gave up some things for you. He specifically gave up some things for me. What was the actual amount of his sacrifice?
[time=1596] What was the price that he paid? And we are going to see five things, and I want you to write these things down.
[time=1603] I want you to remember these things. I want you to talk about these things later. I want you to thank him today.
[time=1609] When you get done looking at these five things, that he actually gave up for you so that you might have hope, so that you might have the chance to move into relationship with God the Father, so that you might have a Savior that understood completely what life for you and me is like.
[time=1629] And again, the only way he could do that, we'll talk about this later, the only way he could do that was to come and be a man.
[time=1636] And he gave up some things to come and be a man, and I want you to know what they are, and I want you to thank him for that. I want you to talk about it.
[time=1644] I want you to understand it. Five things, five rights relinquished by Christ. Five rights relinquished by Christ.
[time=1653] The first thing we did talk about last week, we'll just touch on it again this morning, heavenly glory.
[time=1659] First thing he gave up of the five heavenly glory, don't forget his address was heaven.
[time=1665] We said that last week, don't forget where he came from.
[time=1670] Don't forget what he forfeited when it came to his home and what he had grown accustomed to, and where he had existed.
[time=1679] He comes to a stable, he lies in a manger, he's crucified on a cross all the while, never forgetting from where he came.
[time=1690] And where did he come from? He came from a face-to-face daily relationship with God the Father.
[time=1697] He gave up living with God, he gives up a minute by minute, hour by hour, day by day existence in the very presence of God in his glory.
[time=1709] That's what he was accustomed to, that's where he lived. In the glory of God, he lived in paradise, he lived in bliss, he lived in a place called heaven.
[time=1719] John 17 5, we looked at that, turn there in your Bibles. John 17 5, it was just a one verse deal that just gives us great insight, just a great reminder as to what his mindset must have been.
[time=1734] How he remembered, how he must have walked around with this picture and this realization ever present of where it was he had come from.
[time=1743] John 17 5, he's praying and he says to the Father now, "Glorify thou me together with thyself, Father, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was."
[time=1758] That's what he had known, that's what he was accustomed to, and he gave up heavenly glory to come and be a man. He gave up heavenly glory that we might be saved.
[time=1769] Second thing he gave up, second right that he relinquished, we'll call it independent authority.
[time=1776] He gave up his independent authority during his incarnation, Christ, who was prior to that completely independent and able to do and move and be and choose and enact.
[time=1792] He was completely in a sense on his own and he gives up that to come under and completely submit himself to the will of the Father, to the leading and guiding of the Holy Spirit, and you see it again and again throughout the New Testament, a willingness to subject himself and submit himself in a way that he never had to, never needed to, was never called upon to in the past.
[time=1817] Prior to Bethlehem, remember he was ruler, he was creator and sustainer of all things, doing as he wished, when he wished, and now he is submissive, now we see him as he serves.
[time=1832] He relinquishes heavenly glory, he gives up independent authority, and now number three, write this down, this would be new for us this morning.
[time=1841] Third thing he relinquishes, he relinquishes his divine prerogatives. Christ gave up for you so that he could come and do what he did, he gives up all of his divine prerogatives.
[time=1854] We see Christ set aside the voluntary display of his divine attributes, and instead submit himself to the spirit's direction and the Father's will.
[time=1865] Look at Matthew, Matthew chapter 24, turn back, beginning in the New Testament there, Matthew chapter 24, they ask him a question, and they asked him lots of questions, but this is an interesting insight as you think about this giving up of divine prerogatives.
[time=1883] Matthew 24 talking about the second coming, and you know these guys are curious, like most of us are, and they ask him there, I think it's, they'd ask him about when it was going to take place, and you could pick it up there in 34, truly I say to you, again, Jesus himself speaking,
[time=1903] this generation will not pass away until all these things take place, heaven and earth will pass away, but my words shall not pass away, and then 36, he gets to the question, he gets to the answer.
[time=1914] Matthew 24, 36, but of that day and hour, no one knows, not even the angels of heaven nor what your Bible say, nor the Son, nor the Son he says, but the Father alone, but of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven nor the Son.
[time=1938] You see, that's interesting to me when I read that, because, and as we think about it from the perspective that we're coming at it this morning, realizing who he was, realizing where he had been, realizing all that he knew, you know, and I know that yes, in that sense, as the Son, he didn't.
[time=1955] No, couldn't give him an answer, but you also know that as God and his deity, he could have answered that, he could have, he could have given them a clear answer, he could have told them the day, the moment, the time, the place, he could have, he could have unloaded all of his knowledge and all of his wisdom and all of his awareness
[time=1978] of what would happen and where it would happen. Well, why didn't he? Well, he didn't because he had given some things up, and I just wrote it down like this, he didn't because displaying what he knew took a backseat to loving those he came to serve.
[time=1995] And I think that's a good thing to remember. I think that's a good thing for you to remember. I think that's a good thing for me to remember.
[time=2003] Displaying, displaying, you see, sometimes we just get that all backwards. Sometimes we're so anxious, I feel like, to display what we know.
[time=2014] And in the anxiousness and in the readiness to display what we know so many times, what gets left behind is loving and serving those.
[time=2024] We're supposed to be putting our arms around, loving and serving and giving ourselves to those who need us.
[time=2030] And they don't need our discourse, they don't need us emptying our knowledge bucket on them, they need us loving them.
[time=2039] Now, they need both. But again, I think his approach was, and again, he was functioning in submission, he was functioning as the son, displaying what he knew took a backseat to loving those he came to serve.
[time=2055] I was thinking about on the cross, again, being in, I think, nine performances, you know, so far of the living Christmas tree, and I've loved every one of them.
[time=2071] And there hasn't been one that, and I don't know if you've seen it or not yet, if you haven't, hopefully maybe you'll get to today.
[time=2078] But there's a scene there where Jesus comes in and it's all about the cross and it's extremely powerful.
[time=2086] And you see the condition that he was in and you realize and you go back to the story of how he got treated and what got done with him prior to that crucifixion and in the midst of that crucifixion.
[time=2098] And when you talk about him giving up divine prerogatives, again, my mind goes back to the fact that he could have, he could have, you know, and I guess it's just good for me to remember sometimes.
[time=2111] He could have, he could have called in the troops, he could have called in the angel, he could have done, because of who he was, there was the capacity, originally at least, to have brought in the whole hosts and just wiped that whole mountain out.
[time=2128] He could have done so much, he could have rescued himself, he could have brought judgment on those Romans right then and there, but he didn't.
[time=2137] He willingly gave himself, he gives up, he sacrifices, he relinquishes divine prerogative for your sake and for mine.
[time=2146] I think about him out in the wilderness, being in Luke there at the beginning of Luke, he's tempted, you may remember the story of him being tempted Christ, he's out in the wilderness and Satan comes and takes him through a series of temptations.
[time=2163] And he doesn't give in, he stays true to God's word, he stays true to God's plan, and there were a couple of times where the enemy says to him, you know, jump off the top of the deal and have the angels go, well he could have done that, but he could have done a hundred times.
[time=2182] He could have done a hundred times more than what Satan tempts him with, he says turn the stone into bread, well he could have made it into a steak, I mean he could have made it into a surf and turf buffet, I mean he could have done whatever he wanted to do to completely annihilate, you know, the small-minded little thing over here, but no, he had given up divine prerogative, chooses instead to function within some parameters.
[time=2211] And it's amazing, it's an amazing thing that he gives up, fourth thing that he relinquishes, fourth thing that he gives up, he gives up eternal riches, think about this one, he gives up eternal riches, while on earth Christ was poor.
[time=2228] While on earth Christ was by and large poor and owned very little, think about that, he went from owning the universe.
[time=2239] He goes from owning the universe and all of its wealth and all of its riches and everything that it contained, it was all his, he goes from owning the universe and all of its riches and wealth to a pair of sandals, a tunic and a walking stick.
[time=2257] And he calls that a life and he goes and he lives.
[time=2262] And I want you just to, I would invite you to just stop for a moment this morning and imagine what that must have been like, do that would you?
[time=2271] Stop and imagine how badly at times he must have wanted to, and I don't mean this so much with regard to the wealth.
[time=2282] I don't mean this so much with regard to what he owned or what he had possessed prior to.
[time=2288] I guess I mean I'm thinking more about home, what he had been used to, what he had grown to love, what he had been connected to.
[time=2297] And there was a lot of wealth that came with that obviously, but can you imagine how badly he must have wanted to go home?
[time=2305] Ever been away from home? Ever been on a long trip? Ever been somewhere across the world or across the country or across the state or, I don't know, maybe you don't travel much, maybe it's across the county?
[time=2317] Wherever though, just have you ever been in a situation where you were just away from home and you were so far away from home you just couldn't wait to get back home?
[time=2327] You've been there? I've been there. And you get the clear picture as you read the Gospels, as you watch him live his life, carry himself with people and minister to others.
[time=2337] You get the clear impression. He was only passing through. You see that in the way he lived his life, only passing through.
[time=2346] He embodies for us. And he gives us this great reminder of that description given in Hebrews 11 of Abraham.
[time=2354] Flip back there to the back of your New Testament. Go back to Abraham and the story or the description given him in Hebrews.
[time=2362] Hebrews chapter 11, it's really a great few verses there, 8 through 10. Hebrews 11, 8 to 10, and it just paints this picture here of Abraham.
[time=2376] But again, I see our Lord just perfectly embodying this whole idea. And it's a picture of somebody who is just absolutely unattached, absolutely disconnected from this idea of wanting and owning and possessing and being tied to this place and its wealth and its riches and its possessions and its gain.
[time=2405] It's just this great picture of somebody who lives here but lives here with eternity in mind, somebody whose perspective is fresh and eternal. Look at Hebrews 11, 8, 9 and 10.
[time=2417] It says in verse 8, "By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance, and he went out not knowing where he was going."
[time=2431] You ever experienced that? You ever feel or sense God leading you in a direction, God moving you into a circumstance and you have absolutely no idea how it's going to turn out?
[time=2443] You can't, for the life of you, figure out or see how he's going to make sense of this. But he's leading you and he's guiding you and so you go and there's Abraham going, not knowing.
[time=2456] Not knowing where he was going, but by faith, verse 9, "By faith he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a foreign land dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs of the same promise."
[time=2471] Verse 10, here it is, "For he was looking for the city which has foundations whose architect and builder is God." And the name of that city is what?
[time=2482] Heaven. It's what he lived for. It's what his whole perspective was about. It's what was in the crosshairs. I mean, that's what it was, that's where it was all leading to.
[time=2493] He lived life here, yes. And we can say this about Abraham. Again, this morning, I use it as an example of how our Lord lived.
[time=2502] He gave up eternal riches to come and live in a place, but the way he lived, boy, what an example. He lives with all of that in view and the things around him, the stuff that's going on here, the opportunities there.
[time=2516] I mean, all of it is kept in perspective. Question for you this morning, what kind of approach to life do people see in you? And I really want you to ask yourself that.
[time=2526] Man, woman, husband, wife, father, mother, young person, whoever you are.
[time=2534] I want you to think this morning, just for a moment, about that approach that you have to life here.
[time=2541] What do people think? What do people see in you when they look at the way you approach life here?
[time=2549] What riches, what possessions, what gain are you pursuing? And let me say it this way most aggressively, because I don't think it's wrong to pursue gain in a sense.
[time=2559] I don't think it's wrong to work hard at a job. I don't think it's wrong to be rewarded for working hard.
[time=2564] I don't think it's wrong that you would acquire or accumulate in a sense. So I'm asking it this way.
[time=2570] What riches, what possessions, what gain are you pursuing most aggressively?
[time=2576] I mean, what do you give your best efforts toward?
[time=2581] The immediate temporal gain or the eternal gain?
[time=2589] Honestly, now where do you find yourself? What's that look like for you?
[time=2594] What are you pursuing most aggressively? Immediate temporal gain or that which is eternal?
[time=2601] A little hint on that is think of the things that are eternal. Think of the things that will live forever. One of them would be people.
[time=2610] What marks your life in terms of what you're giving yourself to and what you're pursuing, what you're attaching yourself to.
[time=2620] Is it temporal or is it eternal? And you know what, let me just say this before we move on from that one.
[time=2626] You better ask somebody. That's a question that when I get asked that question or as I've even asked myself that question this week, that's a hard one to just answer.
[time=2637] I shouldn't say it's hard. It's dangerous I think to just answer that question on your own.
[time=2642] Because sometimes when you think about it honestly you don't like the answer.
[time=2647] So you just answer it differently and you kid yourself.
[time=2651] Why do you ask your wife? Why do you ask your husband? Why do you ask a couple of good friends?
[time=2656] And you tell them this is important to me. What do you guys think?
[time=2661] It marks my life. What do you see in me? Do you see me attached? Do you see me connected to? Do you see me overly in a way that would be unhealthy?
[time=2671] Connected to the things of this earth or do you sense a healthy perspective in my heart and in the way I live and approach life to the point where you see and sense me giving myself and pursuing and trying to experience gain and profit when it comes to things that matter.
[time=2690] Things that are eternal. Ask somebody. Ask somebody close to you in your life about that one.
[time=2696] Hey there's a fifth thing that he gave up. He gave up number five he gives up and this one's pretty powerful.
[time=2702] He gives up a favorable relationship with his father. Christ our Lord gives up and relinquishes for a time a favorable to say the least relationship with his father back to Matthew.
[time=2718] Matthew 27. Matthew 2746.
[time=2731] Matthew 2746. You'll see it right there on the screen.
[time=2738] Matthew 2746. It says but of that day that's the wrong one. That's okay. It says here Matthew 2746 and at about the ninth hour here he is being murdered.
[time=2758] Here he is being crucified. Here he is at the very end. And then at about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice saying L.A. L.A. L.A. L.A. Sabachthani. That is my God. My God. Why has thou forsaken me?
[time=2779] While on the cross he personally felt and experienced the unbridled wrath of God.
[time=2789] Don't let that one get away from you too quick. While on the cross he experiences the unbridled wrath of God against all sin.
[time=2799] God the father turns his back on the son and lets the fury of his judgment fly. One commentator recorded it this way and said the wrath of God was, and here's a word for you, the wrath of God was exhausted on his son on his boy.
[time=2819] Wrath of God just completely and totally exhausted on his son as the price was paid for future.
[time=2830] That's you. That's me. As the price was paid for future redemption.
[time=2837] End quote. What must it have been like to have the unblemished perfect never ending always present love of God poured out on you and in you and around you for all of eternity past because that's what it had been like for him.
[time=2856] Imagine for a moment the security. Imagine the comfort. Imagine the peace. Imagine for a moment what it would have been like to have been loved that way for that long in that fashion.
[time=2870] And then the cross comes and it's not just that he turns from him. He did, but it's not just that he turns from him, but he unloads and unleashes all the fury, judgment, anger and wrath against sin and mankind.
[time=2887] In essence the antithetical opposite. I mean you couldn't get any different with respect to what he had experienced and known to what he now on the cross experiences and nose first hand.
[time=2902] In one crushing blow it's all poured down on his beaten, tortured, broken body and spirit.
[time=2912] It's amazing to me. So many of us race frantically through life trying desperately to reestablish relationship with less than perfect fathers.
[time=2924] So many of us work so hard to try and have something with a father and he had perfection with his and gave it up so that our dads imperfections and our imperfections could be forgiven.
[time=2941] It's an amazing thing that he gave up people. Heavenly glory, independent authority, divine prerogative, eternal riches and a favorable to say the least relationship with his father, all of it relinquished so that you could know him.
[time=2964] So your sin could be forgiven so that we could celebrate Christmas and celebrate it with purpose and celebrate it with meaning.
[time=2971] Well hey I want you to go back just as we close to Philippians chapter two one more time.
[time=2977] Philippians chapter two back to where we started back to verse eight and we're going to see here our third and final point.
[time=2985] We see here in verse eight the embodiment of sacrifice.
[time=2989] The embodiment of sacrifice and it says there in verse eight and being found in appearance as a man he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.
[time=3002] Even death on a cross. You see he knew, he knew there was a price to be paid.
[time=3009] And I want you to remember again what John's purpose back to our discussion on John last week we were talking about how the different gospel authors have different intents as far as trying to get us to see and understand something about Christ.
[time=3024] They all had kind of a different take. There was a different theme that each of them were trying to establish. John's theme was he wants us to see Jesus as who, as God.
[time=3037] The whole point of the book of John was to show us the deity of Christ and we see here in Philippians two as this passage has unfolded for us.
[time=3047] We see as deity we see Jesus in eternity past and eternity future being God.
[time=3053] Question for you again just to show this just to reemphasize it and to kind of just paint the picture one more time for us.
[time=3061] What do humans do? I was looking at back in John this week and I came to this passage John 18 one to eight and I want to ask you this question.
[time=3070] What do humans do? Not deity. What do humans do? When the law, when the authorities are coming to get them? What do humans typically do?
[time=3082] What Ray Caruth do this week? I don't know if you're following that story of Ray Caruth, wide receiver for the Carolina Panthers.
[time=3090] Poggles the mind. I still don't get it. Here's a guy making millions and millions of dollars seemingly having all that he could ever want or need and he decides to allegedly decide to go and kill his pregnant girlfriend.
[time=3104] And then that only decides to do that but goes and gets two or three other guys to help him do it and then drive by deal allegedly shoots the girlfriend what four times in the chest and abdomen.
[time=3115] Finding the story breaks, he gets arrested out on bail. The girlfriend dies this last week so now it becomes a murder charge and they go back after him.
[time=3125] What's he do? Walk into the station, give himself up. No, what do humans do when the law is on the way? They run.
[time=3133] He gets found where was it in Tennessee in the trunk of his car at some hotel. The law came after our Lord. They came to get him.
[time=3147] Remember that? If you don't, just turn to John 18. Create picture. Man, it just fires me up. When I see, it fires me up to see the contrast in him and us.
[time=3158] It fires me up to see how he dealt with things that I guess when I think about me, I know I would handle so much differently.
[time=3165] Here he is, he knows that they're on their way. John 18, pick it up right there in verse 1.
[time=3176] And it says there, when Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the ravine of the Kidron where there was a garden into which he himself entered.
[time=3185] And his disciples, along with him, now verse 2, Judas also, who was betraying him, knew the place for Jesus had often met there with his disciples.
[time=3194] Judas then, verse 3, having received the Roman cohort and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees came there with lanterns and torches and weapons.
[time=3205] Stop there. And again, it differs here depending upon what commentator you might read, but this would have literally been hundreds, literally hundreds of soldiers, hundreds of authorities.
[time=3219] They come, they come plowing in to this garden. Jesus, verse 4, therefore, knowing all the things that were coming upon him went forth and said to them, whom do you seek?
[time=3233] In verse 5, they answered him, Jesus, the Nazarene, he said to them, I am he, and Judas also, who was betraying him, was standing with them.
[time=3243] When, therefore, he said to them, I am he, they drew back and fell to the ground. You remember that?
[time=3251] Remember that picture? Remember that story? How long has it been since you read that? Just be reminded today that in his deity, in him being who he was,
[time=3262] he just simply says, I am he, and the sheer realization on their part of who they were dealing with puts them back on the ground.
[time=3273] They draw back and they fall to the ground, and again now, therefore, he asks them, who do you seek? And they say, Jesus, the Nazarene.
[time=3282] And Jesus answered, I told you that I am he, if therefore you seek me, let these go their way.
[time=3290] See, he realized, he knew, he knew all of it was coming, he knew what it would be like, he knew that this would initiate the beginning of what would be for him,
[time=3301] the most excruciating, painful thing he had ever known or experienced.
[time=3306] But he doesn't run, he doesn't flee, he doesn't even make it difficult, he just stands forth and says, here I am.
[time=3316] In his book, Dedication and Leadership, Douglas Hyde explains how the Communists succeed in their programming.
[time=3325] A member of the Communist Party himself for 20 years, Hyde understands their philosophy, he points out that the Communists never ask a man to do a menial little job.
[time=3336] They always ask him boldly and forthrightly to undertake something that will cost him dearly. They make big demands, and they get a ready response.
[time=3348] Mr. Hyde calls the willingness to sacrifice one of the most important factors in the success of the Communist program.
[time=3356] Even the youths in the movement are expected to study, serve, give and obey, and this is what attracts and holds them to the cause, end quote.
[time=3369] It reminds me that the test, and I want you to hold on to this, the test of the submissive mind is not just how much we are willing to take with respect to suffering,
[time=3383] but how much are we willing to give as well with respect to sacrifice.
[time=3389] A submissive mind, a submissive spirit, a willingness on your part and mind to verse 5, back to our passage, Philippians 2, verse 5, have this attitude in yourselves that was also in Christ,
[time=3403] that submissive spirit, that submissive mind, that submissive lifestyle, it's not just about how much you and I might be willing to suffer,
[time=3413] it's also about how much you and I might be willing and are ready to give.
[time=3420] Don't forget too that our Lord went to the furthest extent in His humiliation and that He died as a criminal.
[time=3428] And even further humiliation was His because His death did not come by ordinary means but was accomplished by crucifixion, the cruelest, most excruciating, most degrading form of death ever devised.
[time=3442] Well I just wanted us to have a chance to remember those things. He gave up an awful lot and He gave it up for you.
[time=3451] And at this time of year I just thought it would be great for us to remember the role that He played, the price that He paid.
[time=3458] It was enormous, it was huge because His love for us is that enormous and that huge.
[time=3465] Would you stand with me and let's close in a word of prayer.
[time=3470] Father it would be our prayer this morning as we leave, that we with your help, God and with your assistance and with the encouragement and conviction of your Holy Spirit, God, it would be our desire.
[time=3484] As it says there in verse 5, have this attitude in ourselves.
[time=3488] We understand God that an attitude that is willing to maybe have certain privileges but not seize them.
[time=3495] An attitude that is marked by selfless service, God an attitude that is willing to embody a sacrifice when it comes to the people.
[time=3505] God in the circumstances you bring us into, God all of that represents an attitude that makes a difference.
[time=3512] We see the difference God had made in your Son.
[time=3515] We see the legacy He leaves behind.
[time=3517] We see the way in which He impacted lives and God would just hope that there would be a willingness in each of us.
[time=3524] And our readiness on your part as well, Father, to assist as we pursue that kind of attitude today in the midst of the season and in the weeks and months to come.
[time=3534] Thank you for the chance to study your word, thank you for the chance to be together.
[time=3538] In your Son's name we pray. Amen.
