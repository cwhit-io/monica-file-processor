[time=120] (upbeat music)
[time=150] (upbeat music) - Well, good morning, everybody.
[time=180] Merry Christmas, it's good to see all of you.
[time=184] Hey, anybody here not get a chance to go to Living Christmas Tree?
[time=189] Anybody here not go to the tree?
[time=192] I wanted to do my whole three wise men, three wise women joke again, but you've all heard it except for Jack, so.
[time=199] (audience laughs) We'll just save it, that's all right.
[time=203] Hey, it's good to see all of you.
[time=205] I hope you had a great, great, great Christmas yesterday.
[time=208] And thanks for coming out this morning, it's good to be together.
[time=212] And we wanna just start out with a couple of announcements, a couple of pretty important things to pass along to you and wanna just make sure you grab your bulletin there and open it up and look down there at the bottom of the front inside page.
[time=224] It says LCT teardown, workers needed, and then what's your bulletin saying?
[time=230] Today, that's right.
[time=232] Today, we could really, really use some help.
[time=235] And I know it's kind of like the day after Christmas and you may have some things going and if that's the case, then that's all right.
[time=241] But we probably eat about 50 folks and Bob Purdy, who's heading this thing up, has about 25 currently.
[time=247] And so this afternoon, after lunch, you wanna get a bite, you wanna come back from this afternoon all the way through late this afternoon, early this evening, there would be plenty, plenty of work to be done.
[time=260] You could come individually, you could come as a family, you could come with some friends, but we could really, really use some help with the teardown process.
[time=268] And so if that's something you could jump in and be a part of, we'd love to have you help.
[time=272] Also, reminder to pick up your giving envelopes today and then wanna just encourage you and invite you to be a part of our next series coming up starting next week, first two Sundays in January.
[time=284] It says down in the back of your bulletin, now that Christmas has come and gone and we're all broke, let's talk about money.
[time=291] More specifically, we're gonna look to God's word and see what it has to say about the way in which we give and contribute and support the local church.
[time=298] What does the New Testament specifically teach us about giving, what's our approach to be, who should give, how much should we give, how often that kind of thing and it's gonna be, hopefully a good time for us as a family, so come and be a part of that if you will.
[time=312] I also wanna just encourage you as a family to continue to pray.
[time=317] Would you, as part of this family, keep praying for our family.
[time=322] Keep praying for what God's doing at Black Talk, again, pray individually, pray as a family, pray with groups of friends, pray for our ministry, pray for our leadership, pray for our mission, pray for what God could do through us in this community as He continues to work in our midst.
[time=339] So would you do that?
[time=340] Keep praying as the New Year approaches, pray for what God could do through Black Talk.
[time=345] And I know I'd appreciate it.
[time=347] I know our leadership would and I think God would be honored by it as well.
[time=350] Hey, let me ask the ushers if they would come forward this time and we're actually gonna pray, take an offering, give you as the family a chance to kind of give back.
[time=364] I hope you had a, and I meant what I said earlier, I hope you had a great day yesterday.
[time=368] Hope it was full of great gifts and good times and time with family and friends, but I hope it was also more than that.
[time=376] Hope it was a chance for you to just kind of bask
[time=382] in the truth and in the reality of what the day brought and what it meant, all that we've been talking about, all that we've experienced these last several weeks, talking about born crucified, coming to the tree.
[time=395] I hope it culminated for you a couple of weeks with great reminders and great truth.
[time=401] And it is good to see you, good to be together this morning.
[time=403] Let's pray, shall we?
[time=405] Father, thank you so very much for the day that we got to have yesterday.
[time=410] Thank you for all that it entailed.
[time=414] Thank you for all that it reminds each of us this morning that know you, thanks for what it reminds us of.
[time=420] We are overwhelmed again with your love, your devotion, your pursuit of us.
[time=426] God, it was so aggressive and it went so far that you did what you did in giving up your son.
[time=432] We come before you this morning and we want to give back to you gifts.
[time=438] We want you to sense and know how grateful we are.
[time=441] And so God, as it commands us to, in your word, with hearts that are full of joy and with sacrifice, we give.
[time=451] We give back to you knowing God that you'll use it, knowing God that lives will be touched because of it.
[time=459] But most of all, God, we give because we want to honor you and we want to thank you.
[time=463] And so take these offerings and know that they come from hearts that are amazed again at your grace and your love.
[time=471] It's in your son's name that we pray.
[time=473] [AMEN] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 129 seconds]
[time=610] - Just need to continue worship, Father.
[time=614] Sing without a name, after God with us.
[time=617] [MUSIC - 124 seconds]
[time=752] (gentle music) - Actually, you know what, I'm gonna have you stand up again,
[time=768] 'cause I wanna give you a chance to just catch up a little bit with each other.
[time=773] So why don't you do this, go and stand up, and I want you to just, seriously, I'm gonna give you a little bit extra time, and I want you to maybe find somebody, maybe they're right next year, maybe they're like three or four rows over, it's fine, but I want you to find somebody you haven't said hey to in a while.
[time=785] Go say hi, find out how Christmas was, and let 'em know you're glad that they're here.
[time=812] (crowd chattering) - Man, it's good to see ya.
[time=822] - Sorry about that, but you know, I really hadn't seen the tree yet.
[time=824] (laughing) - No, I know, and I just wanted to tell the joke again, but it was, got my mom here, and my kids, all two of my kids, but my wife's not feeling so good.
[time=837] - I got a joke for you, you know how you're making a hand or two stamps?
[time=841] - How?
[time=842] - Put a little boogie in it.
[time=843] (laughing) - Merry Christmas, Mary.
[time=855] - Thank you very much, I appreciate it.
[time=857] - No problem.
[time=858] - Thanks for saying hi, I'm all alone up here.
[time=861] Hello, Jen, thank you for saying hi.
[time=864] Thanks for not leaving me hanging.
[time=870] Well, that was nice, hope you got to see some folks, and again, it's good to be together.
[time=875] Thanks for being here this morning.
[time=876] I wanna ask, if you would, we're gonna, this is a little bit abbreviated this morning.
[time=880] I know we've got some kids in here, which we're glad to have them here, but we won't go quite as long, but I did wanna try to finish up and give us just some things to kind of bring some closure to this idea that we've been discussing for the last several weeks of born crucified, because that's what he was, born crucified, born to die, and we've had a great time.
[time=903] It's been encouraging for me, and I've appreciated the feedback over the last several weeks on our look at this.
[time=909] You know, we started out three weeks ago in Matthew 1, then have spent the last couple of weeks having a hard time getting out of Philippians 2, but it's been a good look and a great reminder of the truth and the essence behind what Christ did, all that he gave up, all that he sacrificed, as he emptied himself.
[time=929] And this morning, I wanna just take us back to Luke.
[time=932] Same ideas, same story, different narrative, but it's Luke chapter one, verses 26 to 30, and I like us just to read through this.
[time=939] This morning, I'll read it, and then we'll just invite you to follow along.
[time=942] Luke one, verses 26 to 38.
[time=946] You may have read this yesterday morning around the tree or table.
[time=950] You may have thought about it often over the last several days.
[time=953] Let's just one more time.
[time=956] Be reminded of what took place in this scenario.
[time=959] Right there, verse 26.
[time=960] Luke chapter one, it says, "Now in the sixth month, "the angel Gabriel was sent from God "to a city in Galilee called Nazareth, "to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph, "of the descendants of David, "and the virgin's name was Mary." And coming in, he said to her, "Hail favored one.
[time=980] "The Lord is with you." But she was greatly troubled at this statement and kept pondering what kind of salutation this might be.
[time=989] And the angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary, "for you have found favor with God, "and behold, you will conceive in your womb "and bear a son, and you shall name him Jesus, "and he will be great, "and will be called the son of the Most High, "and the Lord God will give him the throne "of his father, David, "and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, "and his kingdom will have no end." And Mary said to the angel, "How can this be since I am a virgin?" And the angel answered and said to her, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, "and the power of the Most High will overshadow you, "and for that reason the holy offspring "shall be called the Son of God." And behold, even your relative Elizabeth, who is also conceived a son in her old age, and she who was called Baron is now in her sixth month, for nothing, verse 37, for nothing will be impossible with God.
[time=1047] And Mary said, and we looked at this verse several weeks ago, and Mary said, here's her response to all of that, "Behold, the bond slave of the Lord, "be it done to me according to your word, "and the angel departed from her." Pick it up over in chapter two.
[time=1067] Page two over there, chapter two, verse four.
[time=1069] And Joseph also went up from Galilee,
[time=1075] from the city of Nazareth to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David.
[time=1083] In order to register along with Mary, who was engaged to him and was with child, and it came about that while they were there, the days were completed for her to give birth, and she gave birth to her firstborn son, and she wrapped him in cloths and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn.
[time=1102] And in the same region, there were some shepherds staying out in the fields and keeping watch over their flock by night.
[time=1108] And an angel of the Lord suddenly stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terribly frightened.
[time=1116] And the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid for behold, "I bring you good news of a great joy, "which shall be for all the people, "for today in the city of David, "there has been born for you a Savior, "who is Christ the Lord, and this will be a sign for you, "you will find a baby wrapped in cloths "and lying in a manger." And suddenly, there appeared with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying, "Glory to God in the highest and on earth, "peace among men with whom he is pleased." The story, the story of God's unfailing,
[time=1154] unblemished, unending love for you and me, finds its beginning with a scared but faithful girl, a trusting and loyal young man, a donkey, a bumpy road, a crowded city, and a crowded stable, a feeding trough, which again is the translation of that word manger, a feeding trough and shepherds coming to pay homage to the true and ultimate Lamb of God.
[time=1180] And contrary to what so many in our society today are prone to simply label as folklore or seasonal storytelling, we know that it's not.
[time=1191] We know that it is monumentally, absolutely, and unarguably, true fact.
[time=1196] And it carries with it clear and unavoidable ramifications for all to deal with.
[time=1203] It's not a seasonal story, it's historical fact.
[time=1206] It's not folklore or tradition that happened.
[time=1210] And it is as real as you name it, Napoleon at Waterloo, Schwarzkopf and Desert Storm, Washington at Valley Forge.
[time=1222] I mean, you just name it.
[time=1224] And we understand today and know in our hearts that this story that we read, this account that's given to us is as real and as factual and as unarguable as any of all of history.
[time=1238] It's recorded for us and I love Luke.
[time=1241] I love Luke, you know why I love Luke?
[time=1242] I love Luke, I mean, I love all the Bible.
[time=1244] You understand that.
[time=1245] There's a way though that Luke does what he does that I just love.
[time=1248] Go back to Luke one.
[time=1250] This is what I love about.
[time=1252] It's Luke and also we'll look at the same kind of thing in first John and I wanna just take a minute and I want us to just be reminded of this this morning.
[time=1260] This is so encouraging for me.
[time=1263] This brings such stability to my heart and soul.
[time=1266] This brings ongoing and continued assurance in my heart and I want it to be a great reminder to you as well.
[time=1273] Look what it says in Luke chapter one verse one.
[time=1275] Just those first four verses.
[time=1277] And I want you to remember this and as much as many have undertaken to compile an account of the things accomplished among us.
[time=1286] Just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word have handed them down to us, it seemed fitting for me, Luke, as well, having investigated everything carefully from the beginning to write it out for you in consecutive order.
[time=1305] Most excellent Theopolis so that you might know the exact truth about the things you have been taught.
[time=1314] What's that duty?
[time=1317] What's that, what's that duty of your heart?
[time=1319] What's that duty of your soul?
[time=1320] What does that, I know what it does to me.
[time=1323] It makes me read as we read here earlier this morning, this account and it just brings an enormous amount of confidence, it brings an enormous amount of clarity, it brings this enormous sense of assurance.
[time=1336] You can flip back to first John.
[time=1337] Go ahead, go back to the back of your New Testament.
[time=1340] Back to first John, I want to just again with not only this Christmas story in mind, but with all of God's truth in mind.
[time=1348] I want you to be reminded of the confidence that we have, not in some folklore and some tradition that just happened to get passed down some way, somehow, to some people.
[time=1360] I want you to see what we have our faith in.
[time=1362] First John, chapter one, same thing, first four verses.
[time=1367] John says it this way, what was from the beginning?
[time=1370] What we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we beheld and our hands handled, concerning the word of life, which again is a phrase synonymous for whom?
[time=1385] Our Lord.
[time=1385] What was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we beheld and our hands handled, concerning the word of life and the life was manifested and we have seen and bear witness and proclaim to you the eternal life which was with the Father and was manifested to us, and again, speaking of Christ, verse three, what we have seen and heard, we proclaim to you also, that you also may have fellowship with us and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ and these things we write so that our joy may be made complete.
[time=1426] You can go back to Luke.
[time=1429] I think it's important for all of us.
[time=1432] For all of us to remember, God has supernaturally preserved His word, recorded by those who lived it, recorded by those who experienced it, recorded by those who touched it, recorded by those who were eyewitnesses and give us accounts of the exact truth and having seen and having heard of and having investigated the birth.
[time=1458] We then see as the scriptures unfold throughout the gospels, we then see a life.
[time=1464] We see a life and as you study His life, the life of our Lord as you read through Luke, as you read through Matthew, Mark, and John, as you study the life of Messiah.
[time=1475] In the midst of all of the teaching, in the midst of all of the healing, in the midst of all of the loving and listening and leading and training and transforming of lives, in the midst of all of that, you see and sense that there is something else at work.
[time=1491] You see and you sense that there's something bigger and something better and something broader than just the immediate that's driving this thing.
[time=1501] You sense it and you see it.
[time=1503] There is a destination in mind.
[time=1507] There is a goal that has been established deep in his heart and end that he knew and understood must be embraced.
[time=1515] An end that was really just the beginning in the bigger, broader picture of things, but it was there and as you look at his life and as you watch him do what he did, you begin to sense that there was something he was moving towards, there was something that was ultimately most important and he knew it.
[time=1533] And he didn't talk a lot about it at first, but as the days go by and as the months go by and as the years go by, he begins to sense the inevitability of it, his commitment to it, and he even speaks of it.
[time=1545] Go to Luke 18.
[time=1548] Go to Luke 18, born crucified.
[time=1550] It's what we've been talking about.
[time=1552] Here it actually just comes out.
[time=1556] 18th chapter of Luke, pick it up there in verse 31.
[time=1559] Says in Luke 1831 and he took the 12 aside,
[time=1572] takes his guys, pulls him aside.
[time=1575] It's time to begin the process of communicating this great truth and this great end.
[time=1581] And he says, "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem "and all things which are written through the prophets "about the Son of man will be accomplished.
[time=1591] "For he will be delivered to the Gentiles "and will be mocked and mistreated and spit upon.
[time=1598] "And after they have scourged him, they will kill him.
[time=1602] "And the third day he will rise again.
[time=1608] "He understood it.
[time=1610] "It was a little difficult that looks like for them "to understand it at first." It says in 34, "And they understood none of these things.
[time=1617] "And this saying was hidden from them "and they did not comprehend the things that were said, "but he knew and he understood it.
[time=1625] "And the miracle of the manger leads to the sacrifice "of the cross.
[time=1631] "And I want you this morning to one more time, "remember the sacrifice.
[time=1634] "Pull out your notes and underline it again if you need to.
[time=1637] "But remember the sacrifice of this entire deal.
[time=1640] "Remember what was at the essence.
[time=1642] "Remember this morning, right here in these few minutes.
[time=1646] "Remember again what was at the crux.
[time=1650] "What was way back in the beginning of this whole deal?
[time=1653] "Remember what was the sacrifice.
[time=1656] "Philippians two, remember that Christ, "who although he existed in the what?" Say it out loud.
[time=1666] "The form of God, from eternity past, Christ, "who although he existed in the form of God "and had all of the rights and privileges of God "because he was God.
[time=1678] "Remember the sacrifice, people, "who although he existed in that form, "did not regard, would not cling to "what was rightfully and already his.
[time=1691] "He did not regard equality with God a thing "to be grasped, but instead did what?
[time=1698] "Emptied himself.
[time=1699] "Completely, bone dry, everything on the table, "account empty, everything gone.
[time=1706] "Empties himself.
[time=1708] "Rapping as the song says again one of my favorite songs "from the tree and one of my favorite lines.
[time=1713] "Rapping our injured flesh around him, "breathing our air and walking our side.
[time=1720] "He comes and he is born and he lives and he dies.
[time=1725] "One author I read last week, "relays the story of a friend.
[time=1730] "This is a friend of this author.
[time=1733] "And this friend's family had this experience "at Disney World.
[time=1738] "And he writes about it.
[time=1741] "He and his family were inside Cinderella's castle.
[time=1746] "You've been there?
[time=1748] "Picture that in your mind, down at Disney World?
[time=1750] "Cinderella's castle.
[time=1752] "It was packed with kids and parents.
[time=1754] "And suddenly, all the children rushed to one side.
[time=1758] "Had it been a boat, the castle would have tipped over.
[time=1760] "Cinderella had entered.
[time=1763] "Cinderella.
[time=1766] "The pristine princess.
[time=1768] "She was perfectly typecast, a gorgeous young lady "with each hair in place.
[time=1773] "Flawless skin and a beautiful smile.
[time=1775] "She stood waist deep in a garden of kids, "each wanting to touch and be touched.
[time=1781] "For some reason, we turned and looked "toward the other side of the castle.
[time=1785] "It was now vacant except for a boy, "maybe seven or eight years old.
[time=1789] "His age was hard to determine because "of the disfigurement of his body.
[time=1794] "Dwarf'd in height, face deformed.
[time=1800] "He stood watching quietly and wistfully, "holding the hand of an older brother.
[time=1805] "Don't you know what he wanted?
[time=1809] "Don't you know where his heart was set?
[time=1813] "He wanted to be with the children.
[time=1814] "He longed to be in the middle of all the kids, "reaching for Cinderella, calling her name.
[time=1819] "But can't you feel his fear?
[time=1821] "Fear of yet another rejection.
[time=1824] "Fear of being taunted, teased and mocked yet again.
[time=1828] "Don't you wish Cinderella would go to him?
[time=1831] "Guess what?
[time=1832] "She did.
[time=1833] "She noticed the little boy, "and she immediately began walking in his direction, "politely but firmly, "enching through the crowd of children.
[time=1841] "She finally broke free.
[time=1843] "She walks quickly across the floor, "neals at eye level with the stunned little boy "and places a gentle kiss on his cheek.
[time=1851] "The friends, as I thought, you would appreciate the story.
[time=1857] "And I did.
[time=1858] "It reminded me of the one I had been studying.
[time=1861] "The names are different, but isn't the story almost the same?
[time=1865] "Rather than a princess of Disney, "we've been considering the Prince of Peace.
[time=1870] "Rather than a boy and a castle, "we've looked at our lost and sinful state.
[time=1876] "In both cases, a gift was given.
[time=1878] "In both cases, love was shared.
[time=1881] "In both cases, the lovely one performed a gesture beyond words.
[time=1886] "But Jesus did more.
[time=1889] "Way more than Cinderella ever could.
[time=1892] "Cinderella, you see, gave only a kiss.
[time=1895] "When she stood to leave, she took her beauty with her.
[time=1899] "The boy was still deformed.
[time=1903] "What if Cinderella had done what Jesus did?
[time=1906] "What if she'd assumed his state?
[time=1909] "What if she had somehow given him her beauty "and taken on his disfigurement?
[time=1915] "That's what Jesus did.
[time=1918] "He took our suffering, Isaiah 53.
[time=1921] "He took our suffering on him and felt our pain for us.
[time=1925] "He was wounded for the wrong, we did.
[time=1927] "He was crushed for the evil, we did.
[time=1930] "The punishment which made us well was given to him, "and we are healed because of his wounds.
[time=1936] "And it ends like this, make no mistake.
[time=1941] "Jesus gave more than a kiss.
[time=1943] "He gave his beauty.
[time=1944] "He paid more than a visit.
[time=1946] "He paid for our mistakes.
[time=1948] "He took more than a minute.
[time=1951] "He took away our sin." Amen?
[time=1956] [AMEN] Got a note.
[time=1959] Take to my tape stuck into the handle of my car
[time=1965] the other day, doesn't happen often.
[time=1967] But I was glad this one happened, a note.
[time=1971] Simply said this, and I just wanted to read it, so I wanted to read it to us, the family this morning, because it's just such a huge encouragement to me about us, and about this family, and about what God's doing, and about what we've been able to see and remember these last few weeks.
[time=1989] It says this to your Kelly.
[time=1991] I don't normally write, but wanted to let you know that God has called me, moved me, and secured me on the other side of the bridge picture that shorter, dark-haired gentlemen talked us through several weeks ago.
[time=2005] Sorry, Ty, short little guy, you.
[time=2009] I've been hanging around Black Hawk for the last three months, and in the last three weeks I've experienced a new understanding.
[time=2018] Check this out.
[time=2019] Of my sin, God's love, Christ's sacrifice, and now as of last night, complete forgiveness.
[time=2028] The messages from Philippians two, this notion of him being born to die for me, and last Sunday nights, living Christmas tree, brought me to a point of complete surrender.
[time=2041] I have experienced pain, hopelessness, along with gain and accomplishment, but I realized this past week that it's all for not unless I'm forgiven, and truly living for him.
[time=2053] I hope this doesn't sound strange, but I love him so much.
[time=2057] I haven't loved many in my life very well, but I cannot contain the gratitude.
[time=2065] Thanks for pointing me from the manger to the cross.
[time=2069] Isn't that great?
[time=2072] Isn't that fun?
[time=2072] And that's where it all ends, and that's where it all leads so many times.
[time=2079] That's what this story does to people.
[time=2083] It does to people as they come in contact with it, and as they experience it, they can't help, but in the end, call him what?
[time=2091] Lord, yeah, and I want you to go back.
[time=2094] We're gonna end with this.
[time=2095] I want you to go back.
[time=2096] Here we are, we can't get out of Philippians two again.
[time=2098] I want you to go back to Philippians two, and I want us to end our look at this idea of him being born crucified with where it all took him, and our response to that, and a world's response to that.
[time=2111] Philippians chapter two.
[time=2113] If you remember, we talked about privilege present, but not seized, that was our first point, remember?
[time=2120] Privilege present, but not seized.
[time=2123] Secondly, when that privilege isn't seized, it leads to selfless service, and we saw that in verse seven.
[time=2130] And selfless service, when really rendered, when really given, when really offered, we saw Christ do that, and he in verse eight then becomes the embodiment.
[time=2139] The purest definition of sacrifice ever seen, ever experienced.
[time=2144] Privilege present, not seized.
[time=2147] Selfless service leading to this embodiment of sacrifice, but we missed a point.
[time=2152] There's a fourth point in this passage.
[time=2155] And I want you to go to the next verse, verse nine, verse 10, and verse 11.
[time=2160] And the fourth point is this, people.
[time=2161] And others centered, sacrificially serving life.
[time=2166] And others minded, sacrificially giving lifestyle.
[time=2171] And Christ's sake, this ultimately was the case.
[time=2175] In our sake, we taste of this periodically, but it leads to honor.
[time=2181] It leads to being blessed.
[time=2184] And sometimes that blessing or that honor isn't immediate, having not seized it, having selflessly and sacrificially served.
[time=2192] You don't feel honored and you don't get blessed, but you and I know that in time that comes.
[time=2197] Either here or there, it comes.
[time=2200] And in the ultimate sense, we see here in verses nine, 10 and 11 of Philippians two, where it led for him.
[time=2206] And it says in verse nine, therefore.
[time=2208] And again, you know, because we've looked at that word before in our studies, therefore means, in light of all I just said, those first eight verses.
[time=2216] Therefore, also God highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name, which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth.
[time=2233] And that every tongue should confess, that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
[time=2242] Our Lord not only receives honor, not only does he receive his glory back, as he had prayed for in John 17, he now possesses even new privileges, privileges that prior to the incarnation he didn't possess.
[time=2257] He becomes, and I want you to realize that this morning, because he did what he did, because he got laid in the feeding trough, and surrounded by mules and goats, and got born in a stable and lived a life, and dies on a cross, which is where the whole thing ends, because he did all of that.
[time=2278] There were some things that he gets to do.
[time=2281] There were some things, some privileges that he now had, that had he not done all of that wouldn't have existed.
[time=2286] Number one thing that comes to mind is Hebrews four.
[time=2290] And Hebrews four, he's called our, what?
[time=2294] Our sympathetic savior.
[time=2298] Remember that?
[time=2299] And Hebrews four it says that we can be comforted by the fact, and we can know, and we can have confidence that our Lord, he functions for us as this sympathetic high priest, who knows everything we see, everything we face, everything we get tempted by, everything that we come in contact with, everything that the enemy might throw at us.
[time=2324] Every trial, every difficulty, every temptation, all of it.
[time=2327] He understands, he sees, he knows, because he wrapped our injured flesh around us.
[time=2335] He breathed our air, he walked our side.
[time=2337] And had he not done it, he couldn't have experienced, all that he did.
[time=2345] He's our sympathetic high priest, Hebrews four, 14 and 15.
[time=2350] And he also got a new name.
[time=2352] And what a name it is, he got a new name, a name that further describes his essential nature and placed him above and beyond all comparison.
[time=2360] The name, Lord.
[time=2362] He is now called Lord.
[time=2365] He is Lord, it's the New Testament synonym for the Old Testament word for God as sovereign ruler.
[time=2373] And don't miss that this morning.
[time=2375] Is he Lord, is he Lord for you?
[time=2380] Is he Savior and Lord?
[time=2381] Is he sovereign ruler of life?
[time=2384] Is that what you celebrated yesterday?
[time=2387] Did you celebrate the salvation he brings and the lordship, his rule in your life that is rightfully his?
[time=2394] If you didn't, if you didn't, then you missed it.
[time=2400] And you missed it again. And my hope would be, my hope would be for all of you here this morning that did celebrate that yesterday, that celebrated the salvation that he brought and the rule in your life and in my life that is rightfully his.
[time=2415] I hope that if you did celebrate that, I hope it was and would bet that it was a sweet celebration.
[time=2420] And a great reminder.
[time=2422] If you didn't, you know, what are you celebrating?
[time=2429] What are you celebrating?
[time=2431] What are you giving yourself to?
[time=2434] What are you pursuing?
[time=2437] What is it you're trying to gain or achieve?
[time=2440] I mean, again, our hope would be that if in fact, you're thinking these things through, if in fact this truth in some way and some form and some fashion continues to kind of tug and pull at your heart, our hope would be that you would open your heart to this and that you would understand possibly for the first time in your life what it means to celebrate a Christmas with purpose and meaning, to celebrate a Christmas in a season that's all about the life that got given to you, that got offered you because God in the flesh, the Son of God, Jesus came and got born in a manger, makes his way miraculously and graciously to a cross so that we can have life.
[time=2488] He was born to die, born crucified so that we could celebrate, so that we could celebrate the forgiveness of sin and life with him.
[time=2498] Well, you know what, it's nice, it's just so fun
[time=2507] to open this thing up, isn't it?
[time=2509] So good to be able to read it, understand it better, be reminded of its truth and I wanna make sure, we wanna make sure this morning that we do our best to include everybody here in the truth and in the story and so what we're gonna do is we're gonna read a story and we do this often on Christmas, on our Sunday Christmas morning and we just want you to nudge those little ones that have fallen asleep, been bored to tears the last 20 minutes, get them awake and we wanna just give them kind of a treat and they can just kind of sit where they are, we're gonna have a few, there's a few folks that are just gonna kind of come up on stage and join me but the rest of the kids just stay where you're at and kids, we're gonna have some pictures on the screen, we're gonna read through a book called The Tale of Three Trees and we hope that you enjoy it and we hope that you're blessed by it, all right?
[time=2561] Hi, babe.
[time=2562] Yeah, come on over here, guys, there you go.
[time=2573] Hey, bud, where's the rest of our crew?
[time=2575] Are they coming?

[time=2608] Nobody wants to sit on my lap.
[time=2610] Dale, you wanna sit on my lap, babe?
[time=2614] That's good.
[time=2615] Hi, Bob.
[time=2616] All right, here we go.
[time=2618] Can you guys, can you?
[time=2619] I haven't got this whole kindergarten teacher, Mary Martin thing down where I can read and like have the book like this, so sorry.
[time=2628] Tale of Three Trees.
[time=2632] Here we go.
[time=2632] Guys, listen, now this is great.
[time=2634] Once upon a thank you.
[time=2638] Once upon a mountaintop, three little trees stood and dreamed of what they wanted to become when they grew up.
[time=2647] Three trees, dreaming about what they wanted to become.
[time=2650] Here we go.
[time=2651] The first little tree looked up at the stars, twinkling like diamonds above him.
[time=2657] "I want to hold treasure," he said.
[time=2660] "I wanna be covered with gold and filled with precious stones.
[time=2664] "I will be the most beautiful treasure chest in the world." See that tree looking up in the sky, dreaming about being a treasure chest someday.
[time=2676] That's the first tree.
[time=2677] Second little tree looked out at the small stream, trickling by on its way to the ocean.
[time=2682] "I want to be a strong sailing ship," he said.
[time=2686] "I wanna travel mighty waters and carry powerful kings.
[time=2690] "I will be the strongest ship in the world." And the third little tree looked down into the valley below where busy men and busy women worked in a busy town.
[time=2700] "I don't wanna leave this mountaintop at all," she said.
[time=2703] "I wanna grow so tall that when people stop to look at me, "they will raise their eyes to heaven and think of God.
[time=2711] "I will be the tallest tree in the world." See the three trees right there.
[time=2717] All dreaming, all thinking about what they wanna become.
[time=2721] A treasure chest, a sailing ship, and the tallest tree ever.
[time=2727] Years past, the rains came and the sun shone and the little trees grew tall.
[time=2734] One day, three woodcutters climbed the mountain.
[time=2737] The first woodcutter looked at the first tree and said, "This tree is beautiful, it's perfect for me." With a swoop of his shining axe, the first tree fell.
[time=2747] "Now I shall be made into a beautiful chest," thought the first tree.
[time=2751] "I shall hold wonderful treasure." And the second woodcutter looked at the second tree and said, "This tree is strong, it is perfect for me." And with a swoop of his shining axe, the second tree fell.
[time=2763] "Now I shall sail mighty waters," thought the second tree.
[time=2766] "I shall be a strong ship fit for kings." And the third tree felt her heart sink when the last woodcutter looked her way.
[time=2776] She stood straight and tall and pointed bravely to heaven, but the woodcutter never even looked up.
[time=2782] "Any kind of tree will do for me," he muttered.
[time=2786] With a swoop of his shining axe, the third tree fell.
[time=2789] See that tree, there he goes.
[time=2792] Cut it down.
[time=2798] Wow, the first tree rejoiced.
[time=2800] The first tree rejoiced when the woodcutter brought him to a carpenter shop, but the busy carpenter was not thinking about treasure chest.
[time=2808] Instead, his work worn hands fashioned the tree into a feed box for animals.
[time=2813] The once beautiful tree was not covered with gold or filled with treasure.
[time=2818] He was coated with sawdust and filled with hay for hungry farm animals.
[time=2824] The second tree smiled when the woodcutter took him to a shipyard, but no mighty sailing ships were being made that day.
[time=2831] Instead, the one strong tree was hammered and sawed into a simple fishing boat.
[time=2836] Too small and too weak to sail an ocean or even a river.
[time=2842] He was taken to a little lake.
[time=2844] Every day, he brought in loads of dead smelly fish.
[time=2848] See, making them into a boat.
[time=2852] Little boat though, not a big, big boat.
[time=2855] Just a little boat.
[time=2857] The third tree was confused when the woodcutter cut her into strong beams and left her in a lumber yard.
[time=2864] What happened?
[time=2866] The once tall tree wondered, "All I ever wanted to do was stay on the mountaintop and point to God." Well, many, many days and nights passed, and the three trees nearly forgot their dreams.
[time=2879] But one night, one night, golden starlight poured over the first tree as a young woman placed her newborn baby in the feed box.
[time=2888] I wish I could make a cradle for him, her husband whispered.
[time=2892] The mother squeezed his hand and smiled.
[time=2894] As the starlight shone on the smooth and sturdy wood, this manger is beautiful, she said.
[time=2900] And suddenly, the first tree knew he was holding the greatest treasure in the world.
[time=2907] Look at that, he wanted to be a treasure chest.
[time=2910] Now, who was the baby?
[time=2914] Yeah, Jesus is laying in the manger.
[time=2917] One evening, a tired traveler and his friends crowded into the old fishing boat.
[time=2923] The traveler fell asleep as the second tree quietly sailed out into the lake.
[time=2928] Soon a thundering and thrashing storm arose, the little tree shuttered.
[time=2932] He knew he did not have the strength to carry so many passengers safely through the wind and rain.
[time=2938] The tired man awakened.
[time=2939] He stood up, stretched out his hand and said, Peace, the storm stopped as quickly as it had begun.
[time=2946] And suddenly, the second tree knew he was carrying the king of heaven and earth.
[time=2952] One Friday morning, the third tree was startled
[time=2959] when her beans were yanked from the forgotten wood pile.
[time=2962] She flenched as she was carried through an angry, jeering crowd.
[time=2967] She shuttered when soldiers nailed a man's hands to her.
[time=2972] She felt ugly and harsh and cruel.
[time=2975] But on Sunday morning, when the sun rose
[time=2981] and the earth trembled with joy beneath her, the third tree knew that God's love had changed everything.
[time=2988] It had made the first tree beautiful.
[time=2991] It had made the second tree strong.
[time=2993] And every time people thought of the third tree, they would think of God.
[time=3000] That was better than being the tallest tree in the world.
[time=3004] Isn't that great?
[time=3007] Yeah, that's a good story.
[time=3009] That's a real good story.
[time=3011] Why don't we just sit right here and we'll listen.
[time=3015] (gentle music)
[time=3030] [MUSIC - 10 seconds]
[time=3050] [MUSIC] Well, he cried when he was hungry [MUSIC] He did all the things that babies do [MUSIC] Well, he rocked and he napped on his mother's lap [MUSIC] And he wiggled and giggled and uncrewed [MUSIC] There were the cheers when he took his first step [MUSIC] And the cheers when he got his first tea [MUSIC] Almost everything about this little baby [MUSIC] Seemed as natural as a cool beer [MUSIC] But this baby made the angels say [MUSIC] This baby made a new star shine in the sky [MUSIC] This baby had come to change the world [MUSIC] This baby was God's own son [MUSIC] This baby was like no other one [MUSIC] This baby was God with us [MUSIC] This baby was Jesus [MUSIC]
[time=3119] [MUSIC - 136 seconds]
[time=3259] [APPLAUSE]
[time=3266] [MUSIC - 577 seconds]
[time=3863] Hey, man, you sound great, and I don't want us to leave without just singing one more thing, singing one more thing, and that is this. You know, we got a new name, it says, and that new name was Lord, and I want us to shout to the Lord this morning, and I want with all that's going on in your heart this morning, whatever it is you find yourself thankful for, whatever it is you find yourself reminded of today.
[time=3892] As we look back at these passages that we've looked at that just have kind of unfolded for us, this miracle, there is none, there is absolutely none that compares to him.
[time=3905] And so I want us as a family to just as best we can with all you've got in your heart to shout to the Lord, and then we're going to be done, okay? So let's sing that together. All right?
[time=3916] [MUSIC - 127 seconds]
[time=4057] Thanks for singing, and thanks for being here, and again Merry Christmas, have a great rest of the week, and we'll see you again soon. Let me pray for us before we go. God, remind us please as we leave that the opportunities that await us outside those doors are immense.
[time=4077] We have no idea who you'll bring across our path, we have no idea what circumstances we will encounter, but God I pray, we pray as a family that the truth and the miracle that we've just considered again this morning would empower us and strengthen us and give us courage to face it all in a way that would honor you.
[time=4097] And all God's people agreed and said amen. Take care. See you soon. Oh, and don't forget we need help today. Big help. Come back if you can all afternoon and evening. Thanks. Bye-bye.
[time=4110] [MUSIC - 879 seconds]
