[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=10] Welcome to the Sunday Morning Worship Service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=14] Thank you for joining us.
[time=15] We trust that the music and message from God's word will help you in your Christian walk.
[time=20] Now let's join our service.
[time=22] [MUSIC]
[time=52] Father of Creation, the risen Lamb of God.
[time=58] You're the one who walked away from the empty tomb that day.
[time=64] And you set your people free with love and liberty.
[time=71] And I will walk with you every night and every day.
[time=78] Father of Creation, the risen Lamb of God.
[time=84] You're the one who walked away from the empty tomb that day.
[time=90] And you set your people free with love and liberty.
[time=97] And I will walk with you every night and every day.
[time=104] We come into your presence to sing a song to you.
[time=110] A song of praise and honor for all the things you've helped us through.
[time=117] You gave a life worth living, a life in love with you.
[time=124] And now I just love giving all my praises back to you.
[time=130] You're the Father of Creation, the risen Lamb of God.
[time=137] You're the one who walked away from the empty tomb that day.
[time=144] And you set your people free with love and liberty.
[time=151] And I will walk with you every night and every day.
[time=157] You're the Father of Creation, the risen Lamb of God.
[time=164] You're the one who walked away from the empty tomb that day.
[time=170] And you set your people free with love and liberty.
[time=177] And I will walk with you every night and every day.
[time=184] You're the Father of Creation, the risen Lamb of God.
[time=191] You're the one who walked away from the empty tomb that day.
[time=197] And you set your people free with love and liberty.
[time=204] And I will walk with you every night and every day.
[time=214] Oh God, you are my God and I will ever praise you.
[time=236] I will see you in the glory and I will learn to want me to go away.
[time=245] And step by step you'll leave me.
[time=249] And I will follow you all in my days.
[time=254] Oh God, you are my God and I will ever praise you.
[time=271] I will see you in the glory and I will learn to want me to go away.
[time=280] And step by step you'll leave me.
[time=284] And I will follow you all in my days.
[time=289] And step by step you'll leave me.
[time=293] And I will follow you all in my days.
[time=299] What makes a good man in a home is that unbelievable amounts of control and discipline,
[time=312] getting everybody to do what you want, when you want it done, the way you want it done.
[time=318] And as you go about being a dad, as you go about being a man, as you go about even being a husband,
[time=325] are you aware of the fact that whatever way you choose to do that, that there are eyes that watch.
[time=333] There are ears that hear.
[time=335] There is a picture that gets shaped and formed every day that you are the man you are, every night that you're the dad you are.
[time=344] Every week that goes by and you're the husband that you are, little composite pictures just get taken every day.
[time=352] And those little composite pictures get made into a real life individual someday.
[time=360] It was out in the garage yesterday cleaning up.
[time=365] It was just me and my youngest daughter, two, couldn't get on her bike, tried about five, six times,
[time=375] couldn't go out with her sister's bike, couldn't get on it, couldn't get on it, offered to help, didn't want it.
[time=382] Couldn't get on it, finally, with one swift kick, she knocks the thing over and says, "Dawg, got it."
[time=392] And I caught myself there just for a moment realizing, "You know what?
[time=397] I never sat her down one day and said, "Here's how you say that. You go, "Dawg, got it." You know, and on something like that, you say it like this, "Dawg, I never did that." She just learned that from Guess Who?
[time=410] She has seen me enough times in frustrating times handle my frustration in some mildly inappropriate ways.
[time=418] Every day pictures get taken, every day messages get sent.
[time=422] Every day little lies, little ears, little lives watching you, men, be dads, husbands, and men.
[time=431] And so this morning as we talk about that, and this morning as we look to God's Word, and hopefully get encouraged and remind it again as to what that is to be like.
[time=440] I hope God will speak to your heart, men of all ages.
[time=444] I hope He speaks to your heart because little lies and little ears are watching, and so many times they want to be just like you.
[time=461] He climbs in my lap for a good night hug.
[time=472] He calls me dead and I call him Bob with his faded old pillow,
[time=478] and a bear named Pooh.
[time=481] He snuggles up close and says, "I want to be like you."
[time=487] I took him in bed and I kissed him good night, tripping over the toys as I turn out the lights.
[time=502] I whisper a prayer, but someday I'll see.
[time=507] He's got a father in God because he's seen Jesus in me.
[time=514] Lord, I want to be just like you, because he wants to be just like me.
[time=523] I want to be a holy example for his innocent eyes to see.
[time=532] Help me be a living Bible Lord, that my little boy can read.
[time=543] I want to be just like you, because he wants to be like me.
[time=557] I got to admit I got so far to go, made so many mistakes and I'm sure that you know.
[time=565] Sometimes it seems no matter how hard I try, with all the pressures in life
[time=572] I just can't get it all right.
[time=581] But I'm trying so hard to learn from the best.
[time=586] Being patient and kind, filled with your tenderness, 'cause I know that he learns from the things that he sees and that Jesus he finds
[time=597] will be that Jesus in me.
[time=601] Lord, I want to be just like you, because he wants to be just like me.
[time=610] I want to be a holy example for his innocent eyes to see.
[time=619] Help me be a living Bible Lord, that my little boy can read.
[time=629] I want to be just like you, because he wants to be like me.
[time=639] Right now from where he stands, I may seem like it's all.
[time=647] But it's only 'cause I'm learning from the best father of them all.
[time=657] Lord, I want to be just like you, 'cause he wants to be just like me.
[time=665] I want to be a holy example for his innocent eyes to see.
[time=674] Help me be a living Bible Lord, that my little boy can read.
[time=685] I want to be just like you, 'cause he wants to be like me.
[time=715] Thanks, guys. What a great tune. What a great song and great message.
[time=720] Hey, I want to start out this morning, if I could, by just saying thanks again.
[time=725] If you were here last week, we had the privilege and the joy of at the close of our service, having Sandy and Bert Wright up here on stage, married 50 years.
[time=734] And it was such an encouragement, but I got to say, I finally figured out this week somebody sent me this.
[time=740] I appreciate it all that Sandy and Bert said, but I finally did figure out how it is couples get to be married for 50 years.
[time=746] It's right here, a couple.
[time=749] Or celebrating their golden wedding anniversary, their domestic tranquility had long been the talk of the town.
[time=755] A local newspaper reporter was inquiring as to the secret of their long and happy blissful marriage.
[time=761] Well, it takes back to our honeymoon, explain the husband.
[time=765] We visited the Grand Canyon and took a trip down to the bottom of the canyon by packed mule.
[time=770] We hadn't gone too far when my wife's mule stumbled.
[time=773] My wife quietly said in the mule's ear, 'That's once.'
[time=779] We proceeded a little further when the mule stumbled again, once more my wife quietly said to the mule, 'That's twice.'
[time=786] We hadn't gone half a mile when the mule stumbled a third time.
[time=789] My wife promptly removed a revolver from her purse and shot the mule dead.
[time=794] I started to protest over the treatment of the poor mule when she looked at me and quietly said, 'That's once.'
[time=804] So Bert, good job for hanging in there all those years.
[time=809] Well, this morning we jump into the second week of our serious families under construction.
[time=814] Men, men, it all starts with you.
[time=817] Are all the problems of marriage and family to be laid at the feet of men?
[time=823] The answer is absolutely not.
[time=825] The entire family and the marriage relationship ultimately the man's responsibility
[time=831] to lovingly lead and manage God's Word says absolutely.
[time=835] Absolutely, men.
[time=837] You're ultimately your responsibility to lovingly lead and manage.
[time=843] What about situations where there is no man?
[time=846] How can mothers fulfill both roles?
[time=849] We can do our best this morning to wrestle with some of the most challenging of issues that families face.
[time=857] Adults, this all might sound very familiar to you.
[time=860] Kids, listen closely, I'm going to try my best here to paint a picture.
[time=864] It's a pretty cool picture. It's a pretty exciting picture.
[time=867] So kids, listen close.
[time=869] Again, many of the adults in the room, this may sound very familiar to you.
[time=873] It's from a book called "Tender Warrior" by Stu Weber, and he says this.
[time=878] "If you were glued to the tube as I was in the early '60s, you may remember a Western called wagon train.
[time=886] It always opened with stocky, fatherly, ward bond, astride his mustangs, squinting, wind chiseled features into the horizon.
[time=894] With a quick look back over his shoulder, he would raise a rawhide, gloved right hand in a beckoning gesture and call out what, people?
[time=903] Wagon's Ho. Wagon's Ho.
[time=907] When the great caravan of canvas top prairie schooners bearing clear-eyed pioneers would begin rolling inexorably behind while the theme music filled our living room and stirred my young heart with a thirst for adventure.
[time=920] Ward Bond was perfect as Seth Adams, the gruff, bluff, but kind-hearted wagon master.
[time=927] I love the way he commanded the great prairie train, snaking its way across the wide plains.
[time=932] But the guy I really wanted to see, the guy I really wanted to see came galloping up next,
[time=939] clad in fringed buck skins and a wide-brimmed black hat.
[time=943] He rode up alongside the wagon master at the head of the train.
[time=946] As the theme music rolled on, the black and white screen filled with the image of the life-limbed, cleft, chend, raven-haired Robert Horton as flint McCulloch, the scout.
[time=960] Flint McCulloch, the scout, sounds exciting, doesn't it?
[time=964] Kids makes you wish the show was still on.
[time=967] I never saw it.
[time=969] Personally, all those adults around you that said wagon's Ho, and we did that they're a lot older than I am.
[time=975] A lot, lot older than I am.
[time=977] I've never seen the show, so I'm with you kids on this one.
[time=981] Flint McCulloch would come onto the screen.
[time=985] Those were the cowboy boots I wanted to crawl into.
[time=988] That was the job as a young boy that I wanted, for it was flint McCulloch, who always rode miles out in front of that long, ponderous caravan.
[time=997] It was flint McCulloch, the ever-vigilant eyes and ears of the wagon train, flint McCulloch probing out ahead, checking out the trail, looking for Indians, scouting out watering holes, scanning the shimmering skyline with young eyes made old and wise by the miles he had ridden and the things that he had seen.
[time=1016] He was the first to smell danger.
[time=1018] He was the first to dodge the arrows.
[time=1020] He was the first to hear the muted thunder of faraway buffalo herds and taste the bite of distant blizzards riding on the prairie wind.
[time=1028] It was up to him and him alone to spot potential hazards, discern lurking enemies
[time=1034] and pick out the best and safest trail for the train to follow.
[time=1038] It seemed every episode would find Seth Adams growling at the wise and bearded little cook, Charlie Wooster.
[time=1046] Now where, in tarnation, has that McCulloch gone to?
[time=1050] But it wouldn't be long before the scout, McCulloch himself would come galloping back,
[time=1056] joss set, eyes flashing with danger bearing news of the mysterious up ahead.
[time=1062] That whole rolling community of men, women and children, relied on McCulloch's experience, his alert judgment and an unfailing sense of direction.
[time=1074] It was a dangerous thing after all, this business of uprooting from comfortable homes and picket fenced yards, putting your worldly goods and precious family into a wagon and setting off across a vast, trackless continent.
[time=1086] The immigrants and their wagons couldn't see all the dangers ahead.
[time=1090] They couldn't imagine what threatened over the next rise.
[time=1093] They didn't know where to find water for their barrels or grass for their livestock.
[time=1098] They had to rely on the scout.
[time=1102] It's always the image.
[time=1107] Stu Weber says, "It is always the image of Flint McCulloch that swims into my mind as I think about the role of a man as a provider for his family."
[time=1118] Now that wouldn't make much sense if you thought only of the traditional definition of a provider in our culture when we think of provision.
[time=1128] We think of food on the table and a roof over our heads.
[time=1131] Actually, the emphasis in provision is vision.
[time=1136] The pro part of the word indicates before or ahead of time.
[time=1140] Vision obviously speaks of sight or seeing.
[time=1145] What is the formula yield? Looking ahead, men.
[time=1150] You as a man looking ahead, giving direction, anticipating needs, defining the destination, writing ahead of your wagon on scout duty,
[time=1163] all of which requires massive amounts, men, massive amounts of time,
[time=1169] massive amounts of prayer, patience, and gentle instruction.
[time=1175] Men here in this room this morning, those of you who have families and those of you who don't, but someday might.
[time=1182] And those of you who don't for now, but for now live alongside others that do.
[time=1187] Do you have a personal vision for the family?
[time=1192] Do you have in your mind's eye, do you have in your heart a personal vision of what you know down deep in your heart the family should look like?
[time=1200] A clearly defined, clearly drawn mental image, a picture in your heart of what a God honoring family looks and lives like.
[time=1208] Many of us, men in this room this morning, have spent thousands of hours envisioning business plans, laying out professional and vocational strategy,
[time=1220] mulling over reports and planning for the future.
[time=1223] We spend thousands of hours on hobbies, friends, and leisure.
[time=1227] We become experts in the office proficient on the World Wide Web, and yet too many times, not all the time, but too many times.
[time=1236] While all of that is transpiring, wives, hearts go untouched and unloved.
[time=1242] Kids' lives go unshaped and neglected because no one had a passionate plan,
[time=1248] a deeply personal God honoring vision for what that family could have been.
[time=1253] Nobody took the time to look ahead.
[time=1257] Nobody took the time to passionately scout out.
[time=1260] The opportunities that are weighted.
[time=1263] Companies get grown, ministries expand, the social network escalates,
[time=1270] and families die because where there is no vision, families, what?
[time=1276] Parish.
[time=1278] Where there is no vision, families, people, parish.
[time=1284] Somebody once asked the question, "Why is it that in the boardrooms, corporate jets, locker rooms, and fairways, so many men are incessantly comparing stocks, accomplishments, earnings, and acquisitions, and so few are discussing the heart-wrenching needs of their 13-year-old." Or the marriage tip that recently saved he and his wife from despair.
[time=1305] Men, the question this morning is, "Are you willing to develop a picture?" Are you, as a man willing to give thought and effort and energy to the development of a real picture inside your heart and mind?
[time=1316] A vision, a preferable future for the one or the many that God has given you.
[time=1324] And having developed a plan, having drawn up a picture, how aggressively, how diligently will you carry out the plan?
[time=1332] And let me just say this, too.
[time=1334] Again, you may be in this room and you're not married.
[time=1337] You're a man.
[time=1338] You may be 13-years-old.
[time=1342] You may be 25-years-old, 30-45.
[time=1345] But being married this morning isn't the key component to our time together.
[time=1349] No, the key component is you're a man.
[time=1351] And there is a way in which men have been called a function according to God's design.
[time=1356] And though you may not personally have your own family, again, men who are unmarried, boys who aren't quite there yet, please, don't miss these next 30 or so minutes.
[time=1368] Because everything we'll talk about this morning applies to you.
[time=1371] It may not directly apply to you today, but what does tomorrow bring?
[time=1376] What does next week bring?
[time=1379] Five, 10 years from now, guys, where will you be?
[time=1382] Please, give your hearts and minds to the things that God's Word has to say about a man, about a husband, about a father.
[time=1390] Well, let's do that.
[time=1391] Let's give us some things to think about this morning.
[time=1393] A strong, solid, God-honoring vision for a family begins with a man's vision or commitment to his wife.
[time=1410] And one of the clearest pictures I've ever seen of God-honoring wife-honoring living,
[time=1416] one of the clearest pictures I've ever seen of a God-honoring wife-honoring man is the husband described in Ephesians 5.
[time=1423] Open your Bibles back to the New Testament, Ephesians chapter 5.
[time=1427] We're going to look at this.
[time=1431] We're going to make our way through five things here in Ephesians 5, and then we're also going to turn to the man's vision for his children as well.
[time=1439] But we begin here in Ephesians 5, and again, just to set the stage for you.
[time=1443] Maybe you knew this, maybe you didn't.
[time=1445] But here in Ephesians, as Paul begins to describe the kind of love and the kind of life that a man is to have for his bride, please remember something.
[time=1455] Please remember this, so many times, and I hear it again and again and again, and maybe you've heard it as well, so many times, God's designed for the family.
[time=1468] And God's intent for the way that a man is to function, and God's intent for the way
[time=1474] that a woman is to function inside this thing that he designed called a family.
[time=1478] So many times today, it just gets pummeled by our culture and the prevailing mindsets of today.
[time=1485] So many times, God's designed and what God's word says about the family, about a husband's wives, it gets made out to be some archaic, out-and-left-field kind of thinking.
[time=1495] And what gets attached to that so many times is, and you hear it from so many different people, is that it seems to be so demeaning to the woman.
[time=1505] When you look at God's design and this thing called headship and submission, understand something, please this morning, as we jump again into Ephesians 5 and look at this passage,
[time=1516] the day in which this was written, okay?
[time=1519] Life in Ephesus at this time, as Paul writes, as God inspires Paul to write this truth,
[time=1526] Ephesus was a place, and this was a day in time when women were absolutely disregarded,
[time=1532] where women were treated, women were talked to, women were handled like baggage, like mere possessions.
[time=1540] The woman was not lifted up. The woman was not cared for.
[time=1543] The woman had no place of respect or dignity whatsoever in this culture,
[time=1549] and God, out of his great love for women, got it with his heart beating for them,
[time=1555] and his desire to see them treated and cared for and loved and held up and cherished
[time=1561] the way that he intended them to be gives us his truth.
[time=1566] And he gives us this design, and it's not about demeaning women, it's not about keeping them in their place. No, it's about loving them and loving them well in a way that leaves them feeling respected and honored.
[time=1580] And we see it right here, Ephesians 5, verse 25.
[time=1584] And Ephesians 5, man has a vision for the way in which his wife will be cared for,
[time=1590] a man's vision for his wife.
[time=1593] It says, "Husbands, love your wives," verse 25, "just as Christ also loved the church and gave himself up for her."
[time=1604] Stop right there.
[time=1606] A man's vision for his wife, number one, she will be sacrificially loved.
[time=1611] She will be sacrificially loved. Men, please write it down, make a note.
[time=1617] She will be sacrificially loved. What do we mean by that?
[time=1620] You know what? She gets thought of first.
[time=1624] She gets considered first, and it begins to be for this man, and Ephesians 5, man,
[time=1630] it begins to be a joy, it begins to be an honor, not an obligation, but a privilege to meet any and every need meetable first.
[time=1640] And you know what, guys?
[time=1643] It is an unconditional sacrifice that is made for that woman.
[time=1647] It's not a "I'll sacrifice now" in order to get this later, whatever this may be.
[time=1655] It is a servant-minded, soft-hearted man who is willing day in and day out
[time=1662] to relinquish rights, give up his agenda, and sacrifice in order to love and meet the emotional, physical, and spiritual needs of his wife.
[time=1675] Relinquishing rights, giving up his agenda, willing to sacrifice whatever needs to be sacrificed
[time=1682] in order to meet her physical and emotional and spiritual needs.
[time=1687] That is a man who is loving his wife sacrificially.
[time=1691] Men, question, idea for you this morning.
[time=1696] Would you like to know how you're doing?
[time=1699] Would you like to kind of get a grade, an assessment, if you will?
[time=1703] Unseriously, genuinely.
[time=1705] Honestly, how well that endeavor is going in your own home and your own relationship with that woman.
[time=1710] I've got an idea for you. Ask her.
[time=1714] Ask her how it's going.
[time=1718] You go back through the things I just said.
[time=1720] You go back through the things I just said, and you just ask her.
[time=1723] How's it going?
[time=1725] Ladies, as he asks you, if you're feeling and sensing his sacrificial love and involvement in your life these days,
[time=1736] and as he asks you that in the car today, on the way home, or as he asks you after lunch when the kids are gone,
[time=1743] as he asks you this afternoon, as you walk through the, whenever he asks you.
[time=1749] And guys, I suggest strongly that you do.
[time=1753] Ladies, remember this. Godliness doesn't get greedy.
[time=1758] And what I mean by that is this, I've seen some situations like this where I just said the things I said, the things he should be doing, the needs he should be meeting, the way that he should be pursuing you, giving of himself sacrificially, your emotional physical and spiritual needs.
[time=1771] Sometimes the lady sits there and goes, oh, this is sweet.
[time=1776] Oh, I like this. You go, Kelly.
[time=1779] You say it like it is.
[time=1781] And she begins to generate this list of things in her mind.
[time=1784] Well, I'm going to show you sacrificial love.
[time=1788] Honey, am I sacri-- no, you're not even close here.
[time=1791] Read this and get back to me next week.
[time=1796] Listen, ladies. And this is not to remove the heat, this is not to remove the impetus of what I'm saying.
[time=1802] I'm just trying to help you out.
[time=1804] Godliness in a wife makes serving her sacrificially a joy.
[time=1818] Men, how you doing? Number two, his vision for his wife will be that she is washed in the word.
[time=1824] Look at chapter 5, verse 26.
[time=1827] He loves her like Christ did, giving up himself for her.
[time=1831] And then verse 26, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the what?
[time=1841] With the word.
[time=1843] Gentlemen, please take note, a husband's vision for his wife is to include her growing in her faith.
[time=1851] Her growing in her faith, her development as a believer.
[time=1854] His desire should be to see her gaining strength and courage daily in her walk with the Lord.
[time=1860] It's called sanctification, big word, really simple definition, becoming more like Christ.
[time=1868] And as we look at the Scriptures, we see again and again that it is the husband's responsibility.
[time=1873] It is the husband's privilege and opportunity to be involved in his wife's life
[time=1880] and to be engaged in her spiritual life in such a way that he is incorporating, that he is seeing to it that, that he is involved at such a level with the word of God and her and that home
[time=1892] where the word of God is washing her, where the word of God is somehow, some way, bringing its cleansing effect to her life.
[time=1902] And as the word of God brings its cleansing effect to her life and their lives, they get grown
[time=1908] and they begin to become more like Christ.
[time=1911] And that is called sanctifying.
[time=1916] Watch this.
[time=1918] Listen, please, the primary, I didn't say only.
[time=1922] I said primary, the primary tool, God's word says, the primary source of this growth in her life shouldn't be her therapist, shouldn't be her friends or the recent best-selling spiritual self-help book.
[time=1937] Nothing wrong with those things.
[time=1940] But the primary source of growth and sustaining strength in her life is to be the word of God.
[time=1947] Romans 5 says that husbands are to make sure that the scriptures are being woven into somehow, some way, the fabric of her life and the fabric of that home.
[time=1959] Now, guys, this doesn't mean pulp that's in the kitchen.
[time=1964] Gentlemen, this does not mean a dry erase board in the living room.
[time=1969] This does not mean early morning Greek and Hebrew lessons before breakfast.
[time=1974] No easels, no pop quizzes, no lectures.
[time=1977] What it means is this, guys, and I'm going to be purposefully nebulous
[time=1984] because this isn't about a formula and this isn't about a certain book and it's not about a certain technique.
[time=1990] It is about you as a man taking this book and the myriad of helps
[time=1997] that are available to you as you take this book and its content to your family.
[time=2003] It is about you as a man being willing to get up early enough, stay up late enough, take a few extra minutes at lunch to do whatever you have to do to think about your family,
[time=2014] your home, that woman, and invite them to sit down with you in some form or fashion
[time=2020] and talk about, pray about, look into and study about things that matter
[time=2027] in this book that brings cleansing, washing power to an individual's life.
[time=2034] At our home, again, I mentioned, I think several weeks ago about our Bible time, we just try our best a couple, two, three nights a week, sit down as a family with the Bible and the kids and we just try to have fun with that.
[time=2046] And again, it's not in depth, it's not quiet and peaceful the entire time,
[time=2052] but we're just trying our best to make an effort to weave this book into their lives and it can be done.
[time=2059] And it's hard and it takes time and it takes more patience than dinner sometimes,
[time=2065] but it can be done.
[time=2067] How's it going, men?
[time=2070] Does she sense and see you faithfully weaving this book, God's Word,
[time=2076] into some of your times together, times together as a couple, times together as a family.
[time=2081] You know what, ask her, you ask her.
[time=2086] Number three, he envisions that she will be protected.
[time=2089] Thirdly, he envisions that she will be protected from the enemy, look at verse 27, chapter five.
[time=2097] Washes her with the word verse 27 that he might present to himself the church and all her glory having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and blameless.
[time=2111] Holy and blameless.
[time=2113] This isn't done men in controlling or condescending ways.
[time=2117] It's done lovingly and gently, this protecting her from sin.
[time=2122] It is done lovingly and gently and yes, it does on the one hand have to do with what you would guard her from.
[time=2129] Yes, it does on the one hand have to do with what you might keep her out of.
[time=2134] It has to do with what's watched, what's read or listened to or allowed into her life.
[time=2140] My mind goes back to a friend several years ago without asking, without knowing, without really listening to conversations that his wife was having come to find out that over a period of six months she had been having kind of front door conversations with a Mormon neighbor.
[time=2158] Again, nothing wrong with the Mormon neighbor.
[time=2160] It's just the false doctrine that was the problem.
[time=2164] Six months later he realizes his wife is completely down, completely down a road.
[time=2169] She never should have gotten down.
[time=2174] Hadn't been listening, hadn't been paying attention.
[time=2177] Hadn't been listening to the very conversation she was having with him at night, where she would tell him about the conversation she was having with the Mormon.
[time=2185] So it's about what she watches, it's about what she reads and listens to is allowed into her life, but I believe, listen closely, please, I believe more than movies, books or people at the door, there's a far more dangerous avenue through which sin enters into the hearts and lives of wives.
[time=2202] We talked about it last week, guys.
[time=2205] What was the main problem that we identified that so many men today face and struggle with the same struggle that our forefather Adam had in the garden?
[time=2216] We talked about it last week, it's right, the silence.
[time=2220] The silence of men.
[time=2224] Yeah, that's right.
[time=2225] One of the greatest avenues through which sin enters the life of a woman is the silence of the man.
[time=2233] Think about it.
[time=2235] God's design is clear that a man in this thing called the family is to function in this way.
[time=2242] He is to do these things, he is to give himself wholeheartedly to these endeavors as a husband and as a father.
[time=2250] God's design also clearly states that there is a separate list of expectations and opportunities that a wife is to assume and give herself to.
[time=2258] Well, guess what?
[time=2260] And those aren't suggestions, those are what?
[time=2264] Command.
[time=2266] Well, when in his silence you and I as men don't give ourselves to these things that he's called us to do, guess who does?
[time=2278] Say it.
[time=2280] The wife.
[time=2282] When we don't lead, when we don't pray, when we don't offer ourselves sacrificially, when we don't sacrifice our time, when as men we neglect the very thing that God's called us to and in our silence step away from those things, guess who can't live with that?
[time=2298] Guess who in the depth of her bones wants so badly for those things to happen that she's even willing to cross over God-ordained lines and sin.
[time=2310] As she begins to assume roles and responsibilities, she was never intended to bear.
[time=2317] Does that make sense?
[time=2319] Now, is that our fault?
[time=2321] Is it your fault as a man that she sins in that way?
[time=2324] Well, no, she has to make a choice.
[time=2326] That's true.
[time=2327] But we lead her.
[time=2330] We prompt that.
[time=2333] We allow that situation to come to the surface as we continue in life
[time=2339] committed to our silence, where we're called.
[time=2343] And Adam didn't do it.
[time=2345] We talked about it last week.
[time=2346] He stood right there in the garden, heard the whole conversation, and didn't say a word.
[time=2353] And we struggle with that very same thing today, men.
[time=2356] We are called to protect our wives from the enemy.
[time=2360] We are called to protect our wives from sin, and that is to be done lovingly, and that is to be done gently, and that is not to be done in a condescending way, but it is to be done.
[time=2371] And wives, again, that isn't to be received as some kind of stifling, controlling action from a man who, no, it's to be viewed as him doing his very best
[time=2383] to lovingly walk by your side in life, doing his very best to be what God's called and to be, and that is a shepherd to that home and to your relationship.
[time=2392] Lastly, four and five.
[time=2394] Last two things we see there.
[time=2397] Verse 29, "He envisions that his wife will be nourished and cherished."
[time=2403] Nourished and cherished.
[time=2405] For no one ever hated his own flesh, Ephesians 5, 29.
[time=2410] For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it just as Christ
[time=2416] also does his bride the church.
[time=2420] Two great words.
[time=2421] We'll just look at them briefly.
[time=2422] Nourished.
[time=2423] Get your pens ready for this one.
[time=2425] The word nourished means this, man.
[time=2427] It is the gentle oversight of one willing to come alongside.
[time=2432] Men, it is the gentle oversight of one willing to come alongside in any situation.
[time=2440] In any circumstance offering strength, hope, and love to nourish your bride,
[time=2449] to nourish your kids for that matter.
[time=2452] It is the gentle oversight of one willing to come alongside in any situation offering strength, offering hope, and love.
[time=2460] And you know what, guys?
[time=2462] That is a very easy thing to do when it's like for me.
[time=2469] Your four-year-old daughter saying, "Oh, Daddy, oh, Daddy, please help."
[time=2475] Four years old, tears running down the cheeks, "Oh, Daddy, please help."
[time=2483] I'm there.
[time=2484] I'm the nourishing king.
[time=2487] I'm down on one knee.
[time=2489] Whatever you need, whatever question you have, you bring it on, Daddy's here.
[time=2496] How about when it's not my four-year-old?
[time=2498] How about when it's my wife?
[time=2502] And it's not a "Oh, Daddy." Oh, wow, I'm confused.
[time=2508] Oh, I'm hurting.
[time=2510] I'm so disappointed.
[time=2512] I'm so discouraged.
[time=2513] I'm so dejected.
[time=2514] I don't know what to do.
[time=2516] And sometimes that discouragement and disappointment has to do with you.
[time=2520] And sometimes it doesn't, but sometimes it doesn't.
[time=2522] And when it does or even when it doesn't, those problems, the issues of her life, the things that she encounters, different than a four-year-old.
[time=2531] More confusing, more dangerous, more volatile times.
[time=2538] How willing are you then?
[time=2542] The word carries with it the idea of a willingness to get down on one knee to lovingly roll up our nourishing sleeves and do our very best to tackle whatever might be there.
[time=2555] He nourishes her.
[time=2556] He's not scared away by her needs.
[time=2560] He refuses to be frustrated and detached as he watches situations
[time=2566] and circumstances brew in her heart out of control.
[time=2569] No, he's willing to jump in.
[time=2571] He nourishes her.
[time=2572] He also cherishes.
[time=2573] His vision is that his wife would be cherished.
[time=2577] You see it there in verse 29?
[time=2579] Here's your definition, guys.
[time=2581] To cherish something, to cherish someone is to hold them up for all to see.
[time=2586] To hold them up for all to see and to hold them up as dear.
[time=2591] To hold them up as treasured and to hold them up as primary.
[time=2595] Ask his friends.
[time=2598] Ask their kids.
[time=2599] Ask anybody who knows this Ephesians 5 man.
[time=2603] And they just know that there isn't anything or anyone more dear to him than his bride.
[time=2611] They just know it.
[time=2612] How's it going, guys?
[time=2614] Man, how is it?
[time=2616] Husbands.
[time=2617] Ask her.
[time=2620] Come on.
[time=2621] Be brave enough today to ask her.
[time=2622] Do you feel cherished?
[time=2625] I wrote the definition down.
[time=2626] It's right here.
[time=2627] Let me read it to you.
[time=2628] Do you feel nourished?
[time=2632] Ask her.
[time=2634] And ladies again respond in honesty.
[time=2637] Talk through.
[time=2638] Work through these things.
[time=2640] But what about his kids?
[time=2642] A few more minutes here.
[time=2643] What about his children?
[time=2644] What is this man's vision for how they will be cared for?
[time=2648] I want to show you just a powerful short little verse that I came across again this last week.
[time=2655] Look at 1 Thessalonians chapter 2.
[time=2657] What about this man's vision for his children?
[time=2662] The 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[time=2664] However many God's given you, what is his vision for them and the way he will relate to them?
[time=2670] 1 Thessalonians chapter 2.
[time=2672] Look at verse 11.
[time=2676] 1 Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 11.
[time=2680] It says, "Just as you know how we were exhorting and encouraging and imploring each one of you
[time=2688] as a father would his own children." This is Paul talking to the folks, writing to the folks at Thessalonica.
[time=2696] And he is reminding them of how it is that he handled himself as a shepherd in that city,
[time=2702] in that church with those people.
[time=2704] And he just, in this one little verse, he just says so much.
[time=2707] He says, "Remember how I carried myself with you.
[time=2710] I carried myself with you like a good father would.
[time=2714] I encouraged you.
[time=2717] I exhorted you and I implored you." And we're going to look at those three things.
[time=2725] Dads, do you take regular segments of time in your day?
[time=2730] Do you take regular segments of time in your week, in the day-to-day of life, to lovingly
[time=2738] number one, exhort them?
[time=2740] Write that down.
[time=2741] Number one, exhort.
[time=2744] Dad's vision for his children will include his willingness to exhort them.
[time=2749] Okay, guys, listen, this is a really simple three.
[time=2752] It's a three-point deal.
[time=2754] And it was so refreshing for me this week to come across this again.
[time=2757] And I'm going to just try and give it to you, really simple and really clear and really easy, but please pay attention.
[time=2762] Number one, do you take time and are you willing to exhort them?
[time=2765] Definition for you of exhort.
[time=2767] Here you go.
[time=2768] To exhort is to give a timely reminder.
[time=2773] To give a timely reminder.
[time=2775] Having charted the course, all right, it's assuming something about the kind of relationship that you've developed with your kids.
[time=2781] Having charted the course on where life needs to go and what that needs to look like
[time=2788] and how to respond when it doesn't go that way.
[time=2791] Having sat with them, having been in relationship with them, having talked about this road of life that they're on, it is a timely reminder to stay on track.
[time=2804] That's what it means to exhort.
[time=2806] It is a timely, loving reminder to stay on track.
[time=2814] My mom had a saying when I would leave from home in high school.
[time=2820] And she used to just say to me, she wouldn't make a big deal about it, but I'd be heading out on a date or I'd be going to a game or I would be going somewhere for the weekend and she would kind of just catch my eye and look me in the eye and say, "Hey, bud, remember who you are." It's all she'd say, "Remember who you are." And in her heart, she genuinely believed I was the Lord's and I was hers.
[time=2846] And she just tried to remind me of that in timely situations.
[time=2851] He doesn't just exhort.
[time=2852] He also, number two, encourages them.
[time=2854] Now watch this.
[time=2855] He encourages them.
[time=2856] You know what encouragement is?
[time=2858] Encouragement is exhortation with a hug.
[time=2862] Dad, it is a timely reminder.
[time=2865] Having charted a course, it is a timely reminder, comma, with a hug.
[time=2872] It's a, "Hey, remember, remember who you are and come here.
[time=2876] I want to just give you a hug." It's a quiet moment, spent face to face.
[time=2882] It means to courageously come alongside.
[time=2885] It is a soft, it is a soft, yes, I didn't say soft, man.
[time=2890] It is a soft and gentle reminder.
[time=2894] And some dads say, "Well, but I'm not very soft." "I'm not a real soft, gentle kind of guy, Kelly." And you know what I say to those guys?
[time=2903] Learn.
[time=2907] Learn to be soft.
[time=2909] Learn to be gentle.
[time=2911] Ask for help.
[time=2913] Study the scriptures.
[time=2915] Read a good book.
[time=2916] Get some accountability.
[time=2918] Be God for whatever he might need to do in your life to make you soft and gentle.
[time=2924] But if you try and raise them, if you try and father them, if you try and lead them via the clip earlier, without the softness and the gentleness that God requires, you become
[time=2935] to them what the young gal said, "Godzilla, you aren't respected, you're feared.
[time=2942] You're not followed, you're obligatory, followed." You exhort them, guys.
[time=2950] It's a timely reminder.
[time=2951] You encourage them.
[time=2952] A timely reminder with a hug.
[time=2955] And thirdly, it says that he implored them.
[time=2958] Until lovingly implore, watch this.
[time=2961] If exhortation is a timely reminder and encouragement is a timely reminder with a hug, then to implore or urge them is to, in a timely fashion with a hug, say please.
[time=2976] Or something like that.
[time=2979] It's all about timely reminders.
[time=2981] It's all about the words that you speak.
[time=2983] It's all about the direction you're trying to give, but it's how you do it.
[time=2987] And I know there are times.
[time=2989] I have seen it done before in my own life and experience with certain fathers.
[time=2993] I have seen fathers look kids in the eye.
[time=2996] And with all the love and softness and gentleness and with the timely reminder and the hug, then back up and say.
[time=3002] Now, in so many words, please.
[time=3006] Please.
[time=3008] Oh, please.
[time=3010] Hang on to what's right.
[time=3012] Please, sweetie.
[time=3015] Please do what's right.
[time=3017] Please, hang on to the truth.
[time=3019] Please do what we've talked about.
[time=3022] You're going to make the choice.
[time=3024] You're going to do what you're going to do.
[time=3025] Know in my heart how I pray for you and how I ask of you in this moment to please remember what's true.
[time=3036] Single moms.
[time=3038] Let me say something to you this morning if I could.
[time=3040] Single moms.
[time=3041] And you may be a single mom here today by choice or by someone else's choice.
[time=3048] But single moms, guess what, most all of what we've just said rests on your tired,
[time=3057] sometimes extremely lonely shoulders.
[time=3063] And can you alone do it all?
[time=3067] Absolutely not.
[time=3069] No, you can't.
[time=3071] Can you with help from your own family and friends make some valiant efforts?
[time=3076] Absolutely.
[time=3078] Can you with help from your family and friends?
[time=3080] And can you with encouragement from your own church family in many different ways?
[time=3086] Take a stand and do all that you can with the help and assistance and encouragement and prayer of others.
[time=3093] Can you with that stand in the gap and do your very best to make the kind of investment that God gives you the opportunity in your current situation to make?
[time=3101] Yes.
[time=3102] Yes, you can.
[time=3104] Is it easy, no.
[time=3107] And I just so much has been said and you've probably been told so much and I just want to reiterate it again from us.
[time=3116] Single moms, single dads.
[time=3120] There's so much to be done and I know at times it seems so absolutely overwhelming.
[time=3127] But you need to know and again I'm not preaching this at you and I am not beating you over the head with this.
[time=3132] I am just simply trying to gently and lovingly remind you that God's Word says to you as it says to me that there isn't a single situation that he allows to come into our life,
[time=3143] that he isn't able and willing to give us the strength and courage to endure.
[time=3148] And he gives us people and he gives us friends and he gives us hope and he gives us the scriptures.
[time=3154] And you can make it through today.
[time=3157] And then you can deal with tomorrow tomorrow but my hope and our hope for you is if you find yourself in that situation today that you would lay hold of the truth which is what we've just explained.
[time=3170] And with all of your might and with all of your energy and with all of your heart which is all that he requires that you would give yourself to that endeavor and where you need help ask and where you need support requested.
[time=3184] But allow your family and allow your friends and allow this family to be the kind of encouragement that you desperately need at times and know how thankful we are for you and know how proud of you we are as you give yourself to this kind of endeavor.
[time=3203] Men, last question and we're going to close with this.
[time=3209] Men, write this one down, give this one some thought and I'm just going to ask it to you plainly.
[time=3216] What do you want men?
[time=3219] What do you want more than anything else in the world?
[time=3227] I'm serious men, what is it? What do you want more than anything else in the world?
[time=3237] Think about that one, please ponder that one, please give that one some thought.
[time=3244] I'm not going to answer it for you but I will say this this morning in my opinion we've done our very best to at least bring to the surface.
[time=3254] Some things in your life that I believe with all of my heart are the most important things in the world.
[time=3262] Men, what do you want more than anything else in the world?
[time=3266] And are you willing to go before your God and say God, this is what I truly want.
[time=3272] This is the opportunity, these are the chances I would truly love to encounter in my life.
[time=3278] My hope is that again this morning especially if you find yourself with a family I would just hope that somewhere in the answer to that question would come the arena of how you carry yourself with your wife and the arena of how you carry yourself with your kids.
[time=3294] What is it men that you want more than anything else in this world?
[time=3300] And as you give yourself to that and as you think about that again if you need some help, if you need some encouragement,
[time=3306] if you need some timely reminders, there's lots of help to be given.
[time=3310] And we'd love to talk with you, I mentioned a book earlier, I'll say it again, Tender Warrior.
[time=3316] The subtitle is Every Man's Potential, Every Woman's Dream, Every Children's, Every Kid's Hope.
[time=3323] Tender Warrior by Stu Weber, it's a great, great book.
[time=3327] And so again men it all does begin with you and I hope as you give that some thought I hope as you ask your questions of your wife or friends today.
[time=3338] I hope you'll ask with a heart that wants to listen.
[time=3341] I hope you'll ask with a spirit that wants to grow and learn.
[time=3344] And again wise I hope you'll respond kindly, truthfully and honestly as we keep trying to have families that truly honor our Lord and His design.
[time=3356] Let me ask you to stand if you wouldn't, we'll close in a word of prayer.
[time=3366] Father as we stand to close this time together, I can't help but think of the men in this room.
[time=3372] Many of whom maybe even right now continue to ask themselves that very question we just ended with.
[time=3379] What is it that I want? What is it that I desire more than anything else in the world?
[time=3385] And God I know as a man that there is the temptation daily for many things to come into that picture.
[time=3397] The answer to that question so many times can be so many different things.
[time=3402] And God again though today I'm reminded and I've been reminded personally all week as I thought this through that there is an arena of life that I believe as I look at your design for me as a man and as I look at the way you've constructed this thing called the family.
[time=3418] I believe that there is an arena of my life that is truly most important.
[time=3426] And God I pray that in the lives of all of these men here in this room this morning that that arena would in the days and weeks and months to come God that we would give ourselves to that arena in ways that maybe we never have before and God that in so doing that we might begin to see hearts and lives get encouraged.
[time=3445] Conversations begin to take place that didn't used to. Smiles on faces and warm embraces and opportunities to talk and be together that God maybe before were absent.
[time=3459] God I pray for our men that each of us would regardless of where we find ourselves in life give ourselves God to your design and that we would be men who truly like Flint McCullough God that we would have a vision and a picture for what we long for
[time=3474] in our relationship with our wives and kids and God that we would give that vision to you begging you for the strength and courage and accountability and friendship and insight needed to see that vision accomplished.
[time=3489] Thank you for the great great time that you gave us this morning of being together thank you for the privilege of lifting up your name and your word God be with us as we go in your son's name we pray. Amen.
