[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=10] Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=14] Thank you for joining us. We trust that the music and message from God's word will help you in your Christian walk.
[time=20] Now let's join our service.
[time=22] [MUSIC]
[time=52] And I will live my life for you.
[time=58] [MUSIC]
[time=60] You are Lord, our Lord.
[time=62] You are King of Kings.
[time=64] You are my King God.
[time=66] Lord of everything.
[time=68] You're in heaven.
[time=70] You are the great I am.
[time=74] You're my Prince of Peace.
[time=76] You are the peace who is the man. You're the living God.
[time=82] You're my saving grace.
[time=84] You will reign forever in my ancient abyss.
[time=89] You are out of the living heaven.
[time=94] You're my Savior, Messiah, believer and friend.
[time=99] You're my Prince of Peace and I will live my life for you.
[time=105] [MUSIC]
[time=109] You're my Prince of Peace and I will live my life for you.
[time=117] [MUSIC - 8 seconds]
[time=132] You're my Prince of Peace and I will live my life for you.
[time=614] You can know who God is and what He's like because that's the tool He's given us to learn about Him.
[time=622] Are there things, benefits that we have that might not be in this passage?
[time=627] Friends.
[time=630] Friends. That would be important to you, Lucy.
[time=632] Well, we have the benefit of being in a family unit.
[time=635] That's right.
[time=636] You know, some creatures in the animal kingdom, God has designed that they're on their own from the minute they're born.
[time=642] And we are designed to be in a family unit so that when you're born, you're practically helpless.
[time=647] And you're dependent on your parents or other caregivers to raise you, to teach you social skills and life skills and also to teach you from the Word of God.
[time=660] That's a real benefit we have being in a family.
[time=663] The very last verse that I read, it says, "As for me, I too will praise the Lord." What's one way we can do that, Lucy?
[time=670] Praying.
[time=672] We can pray and thank Him. That's right.
[time=674] Why don't we do that right now?
[time=675] And Lucy, why don't you start and we'll thank God for some of the benefits that He's given us.
[time=681] Dear Heavenly Father, thank you for this so many benefits that you've given us.
[time=688] Like friends and thank you for being tender and compassionate and thank you for a family and a home in Jesus' name amen.
[time=697] Heavenly Father, we do thank you for your word, for revealing yourself in the Word to us.
[time=703] And I want to thank you for the benefits that we have.
[time=706] Chief, among which is your love, which caused you to send your son to the earth, to live a life as a human,
[time=714] and to die on the cross, to buy our salvation.
[time=717] We are so grateful for that, and Lord, we love you in return for it.
[time=727] [MUSIC - 317 seconds]
[time=1053] Join us now this time, Father I adore you.
[time=1058] [MUSIC - 72 seconds]
[time=1139] Well, we do want to welcome you this morning to the beginning of our series on the family.
[time=1148] Families under construction, and we've been looking forward to this.
[time=1153] We've been planning and praying that God might use our times together with reference to this topic
[time=1159] and the truth that we find in His Word having to do with this topic.
[time=1164] We've been hoping and praying that He'll use it to remind many of us of things that we've known for a while.
[time=1172] We hope that He would use it to inform maybe some of some things that you never knew.
[time=1178] Most of all, we've been hoping and praying that in the next seven weeks He would use these times together to truly
[time=1184] and literally and actually and practically encourage all of us, all of us with respect to how the family is really supposed to function,
[time=1194] what His design, what His plan was for it. So we hope you'll be here, we hope you'll be encouraged, and we're looking forward to the next several weeks.
[time=1202] Families under construction, the family today, and I wouldn't think I'm the only one in this room who shares this opinion.
[time=1210] The family today is in deep trouble. It's not a good thing in most places today.
[time=1217] Husbands and wives are leaving each other in search of relief and in pursuit of selfish ambition.
[time=1223] Moms are abandoning children, dads are trading in the demands and challenges of parenthood for a new girlfriend, a new life, and more free time.
[time=1234] Some are less overt and blatant, choosing the more subtle approach to their sin and unfaithfulness.
[time=1240] They don't literally leave or physically engage elsewhere. No, they simply choose to mentally and relationally separate,
[time=1250] bringing to that home the ugly, lonely, and empty reality of an occasional physical presence mixed with an emotional divorce.
[time=1260] The family is in serious trouble.
[time=1264] Kids seem more and more inclined these days to consider things like respect, obedience, and gratitude as purely optional,
[time=1272] as they conduct themselves with authority, parents, and each other.
[time=1276] Statistically, cheating in schools is, what do you think, on the rise or on the decline?
[time=1282] It's on the rise, from elementary all the way to the university campuses.
[time=1288] Cheating is on the rise. Juvenile retention facilities are overcrowded.
[time=1293] Teen violence is on the rise. Teen theft is higher than it's ever been.
[time=1297] The number of teens charged with assault has increased, little league.
[time=1302] Youth soccer and youth basketball leagues are experiencing new and absolutely staggering levels of kids out of control,
[time=1313] mainly because their parents are out of control.
[time=1318] The family is in definite trouble.
[time=1321] Couples don't feel intimate. Kids don't feel loved.
[time=1326] They often feel plenty of pressure to perform, but unconditionally loved and accepted, that is becoming a rarity in homes all across our country.
[time=1339] Kids, in many cases, do feel the guilt and the heartache and the confusion of the family crumbling around them.
[time=1348] Not long ago, I set across the room from a ten-year-old girl
[time=1354] who, with tears running down her cheeks, said to me that she was absolutely sure.
[time=1361] Absolutely convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that there must have been something that she could have done
[time=1371] to have prevented what she saw take place in her own home.
[time=1376] Convinced that there was something she had done, something she had said, there must have been something she could have done differently to have somehow avoided the absolute pain and heartache of a family right before her eyes disintegrating.
[time=1390] Single moms feel alone, and tired.
[time=1394] Single dads, many of them trying their best, feel short-handed and outnumbered.
[time=1399] Wives feel misunderstood and lonely.
[time=1403] Husbands feel disrespected and manipulated.
[time=1407] The family in many ways and in many places is failing miserably.
[time=1411] And while millions, millions of dollars, get spent every year researching the dilemma,
[time=1418] and while millions of people continue to suffer from the family and its demise, you hold in your hands this morning, and I hold in my hands at this very moment
[time=1429] the answer to the entire problem, right here.
[time=1435] For you see, I hold in my hands this morning and you have there in your lap, hopefully today, God's Word, the answer for the family.
[time=1443] You see, because God designed the family.
[time=1447] God is the one that put it all together.
[time=1449] God is the one that thought it up.
[time=1451] God is the one that orchestrated the whole thing.
[time=1453] God is the one who drew up the plans.
[time=1457] And He gives for us right here in His recorded Word the framework and design for a God-honoring home and family.
[time=1466] And so in the next seven weeks we will attempt, as Tom said earlier, to look closely and honestly into His recorded Word in an attempt to wrestle with some extremely important issues.
[time=1478] Now why do I say extremely?
[time=1480] I say extremely and I could think of seven, ten other adjectives to describe this.
[time=1485] I say extremely because Dobson said this, there isn't a single setting.
[time=1490] There is not a single setting in and through all of life that is more life-shaping
[time=1496] and heart-forming than that of an individual's family.
[time=1502] The home that he or she grew up in.
[time=1506] It shapes forms and impacts hearts and lives for all of life.
[time=1512] Can you change? Yes.
[time=1515] Can you repent from sinful habits? Yes.
[time=1518] Can you learn and grow as a young married individual couple moving through it? Yes.
[time=1524] But there are things that get embedded.
[time=1527] There are things that get ingrained.
[time=1529] There are things that get picked up in the life of a home that to varying degrees don't ever leave.
[time=1537] We are shaping hearts.
[time=1539] We are forming lives in the midst of our family.
[time=1544] I want to just again briefly go through the brochure.
[time=1547] And I want to do this again very briefly, but I just want to make sure you realize what's coming, okay?
[time=1552] And I want you to know what's coming, not just for your sake.
[time=1555] Again, people understand we look at this as an opportunity to equip and encourage the body of Christ.
[time=1562] We look at this as an opportunity for believers, those who have crossed over that line of faith to be strengthened in their understanding of what God's Word says the family is to look like.
[time=1572] But it is also a great opportunity for you and for me to expose others, people that we know and love, folks that we have friendships in relationship with.
[time=1582] A great opportunity to expose them to things that they struggle with as well as we.
[time=1587] And so I go through this and we make these available as we have this morning out in the foyer, not just to make available to you, but for you to take two or three and give to a friend.
[time=1597] In the weeks to come, God's designed for the family, that's today.
[time=1601] That's today.
[time=1602] We're going to look at how the family is to function, what are the different roles he has designed, what are some of the tensions that we face as families, and can we deal with them effectively.
[time=1611] Next week, as Tom mentioned, men, it all starts with you.
[time=1614] We talked a little bit about this several weeks ago and our message fathers that serve.
[time=1619] There's more to say, more to talk about, more in God's Word, to look closely at and understand men when it comes to the role that you play, when it comes to God's design and the way that he intended you to function as a man, as a husband, as a father, as a single man in support of a husband,
[time=1640] a father that you know, again, this series isn't just for families, it is for our family, and it is for everyone who would come and sit in one of these seats in an attempt to better equip them and remind them of how the family is supposed to function, whether they find themselves smacked dab in the middle of a family, or whether they find themselves coming alongside and encouraging a family.
[time=1661] After that, July 23, mothers and wives, key word influence.
[time=1666] It's a lot of words that come to my mind.
[time=1669] When I think about the role that a woman plays in the sphere of a home and family,
[time=1676] one of them is the word influence.
[time=1679] Ladies, God's word calls you to, and we'll see that in the coming weeks, God's word calls you to influence those in that home, and you do that in a number of ways, and we'll look closely at the role of the mother and the wife, or the key woman in a certain arena with certain kids, influence.
[time=1697] After that, we move on.
[time=1699] We're going to have a break in the series and have an entire morning dedicated to worship.
[time=1704] Worship and prayer, a whole morning of family worship and prayer, kind of a halfway point, taking a little time out, looking back over the last several weeks and saying, "Oh God, please, please help us as families incorporate these things." A chance for you and for me to be together and to praise and worship our God.
[time=1720] The following week, coming up in August, children of all ages, this question gets asked of me and others I know of very often.
[time=1728] People wonder, like, is there an age when I can stop honoring my mom and dad?
[time=1734] What is it to honor?
[time=1736] What does it mean to truly respect?
[time=1739] What is the charge from God's word to all of us with respect to how we conduct ourselves and carry ourselves from the age of five to the age of 50?
[time=1748] With those that raised us, what is our relationship to be like with mom and dad?
[time=1754] Then we move on from August 6th to August 13th.
[time=1757] Your family and the great commission.
[time=1759] Steve's going to be here that morning and talk with you about the opportunity.
[time=1763] The opportunity that stares many of you right in the face every day, the chance that you have, the chance that we have in our home as well, to as a family be engaged in the great commission.
[time=1774] As a family, there are opportunities that God gives all of us to help seekers find and follow Christ as a family.
[time=1782] How is it that we could go about?
[time=1784] I mean, as a corporate family, we're working on it.
[time=1786] How about you as a family?
[time=1788] In those that He's placed around you and the opportunities that He's put before you, we'll look closely.
[time=1794] Steve will take us through a study on our families and the great commission.
[time=1798] And then lastly, we're going to look at the heart, the heart of a family.
[time=1802] That's going to be a great day.
[time=1804] Going to kind of do a little spiritual EKG.
[time=1806] Moms, dads, kids, healthy hearts, right hearts before God.
[time=1812] Hearts that are right before God all across the board.
[time=1816] Moms, dads, kids, give the family a chance to be what it was truly intended to be.
[time=1822] And we'll ask the question that morning.
[time=1824] How's your heart?
[time=1826] And spend some time looking at the scriptures with reference to the heart and our relationship at the heart level with each other.
[time=1833] But today, today we're going to jump off with God's design.
[time=1837] God's design for the family.
[time=1838] What is the big picture?
[time=1839] And today will be kind of big picture.
[time=1841] And in the minutes that are remaining, I want to just kind of touch on kind of the major points in God's wonderful design for the family.
[time=1848] And I want to start with just taking a look at what God's design requires.
[time=1853] God's design requires some things.
[time=1856] And some of this may sound to you extremely obvious.
[time=1860] Some of it may be very interesting and new, but either way, I hope you get your pen out, hope you get a pencil or something, find something to write on, and begin this morning right now as we prepare for the next seven weeks to mentally and literally take notes so that you can again be reminded or educated for the first time as to what this design was intended to be.
[time=1881] God's design requires number one.
[time=1884] You ready? A man and a woman.
[time=1889] And I don't mean to be humorous when I say that.
[time=1894] God's design, kids.
[time=1897] God's design, young adults.
[time=1900] God's design, people, for the family begins with a man and a woman.
[time=1908] This is what constitutes a family.
[time=1911] According to the Word of God in Genesis 2, go ahead, flip back there to the beginning of this great book.
[time=1917] Second chapter of Genesis where this whole thing started.
[time=1921] The world and creation as well as the family says in Genesis chapter 2,
[time=1928] verse 18, having created the man, Adam, and having given him some things to do.
[time=1935] It says there in verse 18, "If Genesis 2, then the Lord God said it is not good for the man to be alone." And all the men in the house said, amen.
[time=1948] I was expecting a little bit louder, guys, but that's all right.
[time=1953] A lot of elbows. I can see a lot of elbows going.
[time=1957] A lot of guys leaving with sore ribs today.
[time=1959] Then the Lord God said it is not good for the man to be alone.
[time=1962] I will make him a helper, suitable for him, and out of the ground, the Lord God formed every beast of the field
[time=1968] and every bird of the sky and brought them to the man to see what he would call them.
[time=1971] And whatever the man called a living creature, that was its name.
[time=1974] And the man gave names to all the cattle and to the birds of the sky and to every beast of the field.
[time=1978] But for Adam there was not found a help or suitable for him.
[time=1981] So the Lord God, verse 21, caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man and he slept.
[time=1987] And then he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh at that place.
[time=1992] And the Lord God fashioned into a woman.
[time=1996] The rib which he had taken from the man and brought her to the man.
[time=2000] And the man said this is more like it.
[time=2004] This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh.
[time=2008] She shall be called woman because she was taken out of man.
[time=2013] And for this cause a man shall leave his father and his mother and shall cleave to his wife.
[time=2020] And they shall become one flesh.
[time=2024] God's designed for a family.
[time=2026] People requires a man and a woman.
[time=2029] He created a male and a female, bringing them both together to form a family.
[time=2034] And he could have done it any other way he wanted to, but he didn't.
[time=2037] He did it this way.
[time=2039] And this is what constitutes, and this is what represents his design.
[time=2043] Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve, not Eve and Eliza.
[time=2048] And I'm not being funny.
[time=2052] Because culture today tells you, students, culture today screams at us.
[time=2057] Oh, isn't it nice that these kids would at least have someone to care for them.
[time=2064] The newspapers published it in big bold letters.
[time=2068] The news media blurts it out all over the known world.
[time=2071] You see it in the magazine. Do you hear it sometimes in the schools?
[time=2075] It's okay.
[time=2077] Well, you know what? It's not.
[time=2080] It's not okay. And it's not okay because I say so.
[time=2083] It's not okay because it's not the way he designed it.
[time=2087] Not at all.
[time=2089] God's design begins with a man and a woman.
[time=2093] To go about it any other way is outside of God's design.
[time=2096] And to live outside of his design or will is called what?
[time=2100] Sin.
[time=2102] No matter what the modern culture says.
[time=2105] No matter what the Supreme Court decides, you guys, it isn't God's design.
[time=2113] God's design for a family requires a man and a woman.
[time=2116] Secondly, God's design requires a man, not just a man, but a courageous man.
[time=2127] You listening, guys?
[time=2129] We'll talk more about this next week.
[time=2132] And then we'll talk more about this in the months and years to come, I'm sure.
[time=2137] But please write this down.
[time=2140] Please see this word. Please try in the next few minutes to do your very best as a man to grasp its meaning.
[time=2147] Men, God's design requires a courageous man.
[time=2153] It requires of you men courage to be and to say and to function in the way that he called you to live.
[time=2161] In 14 years of ministry and counseling and 13 years of marriage, several of which were less than stellar on my part.
[time=2171] From the accounts that I've read, from the tapes that I've listened to, from the conference and seminar speeches that I've heard, if you ask me to summarize the greatest weakness of most men, husbands, fathers,
[time=2184] it would be what I call a silent presence.
[time=2190] Write it down, a silent presence.
[time=2195] Oh, he's there.
[time=2198] But he is in some cases strangely and detrimentally silent.
[time=2206] Greatest weakness.
[time=2208] That's what I tell you.
[time=2210] A silent presence in words and in action.
[time=2213] Silent with respect to what he doesn't say, silent with respect to what he doesn't do.
[time=2219] Now, you get him in the office.
[time=2224] You get that same in the office.
[time=2226] You get him on the job.
[time=2227] You get him out on the course or in the social settings.
[time=2230] And he has got plenty to say.
[time=2233] And he even says it well.
[time=2235] He problem solves.
[time=2236] He compliments.
[time=2237] He encourages.
[time=2238] He deals with anything that comes his way.
[time=2240] You get him in the office.
[time=2242] You get him on the course.
[time=2243] You get him with his friends.
[time=2244] And it just comes flowing out.
[time=2248] You get him in front of a hurting lonely wife who's pouring out her heart.
[time=2254] Or you put him in front of a troubled teen, a son or daughter on the verge of some serious danger.
[time=2262] And he is too often times silent.
[time=2268] Nothing to say.
[time=2270] Nothing to offer.
[time=2273] Vocationally, socially, athletically, all he's gifted.
[time=2278] Interpersonally in the family arena, he's a no-show.
[time=2283] Why?
[time=2285] Why guys?
[time=2286] Why does every man in this room this morning?
[time=2290] I mean, if there's a trace of honesty in you this morning, which I believe there is in all of you,
[time=2296] why is it that we can all identify so with what I've just said?
[time=2301] What is it that goes on?
[time=2303] What is it that has happened?
[time=2305] That in the face of things that really matter?
[time=2308] I mean, we're not talking about the job and the office and the course now.
[time=2312] Now we're talking about in the face of things and people that truly matter, that truly make a difference.
[time=2319] Why in the face of those things are we so oftentimes silent, so quick to retreat.
[time=2326] So willing to have some place to go, something to do, or just be harsh to get out of it quick.
[time=2334] Well, you know what?
[time=2335] Just a chapter later back in Genesis, this whole thing started to come undone.
[time=2339] Go to Genesis 3.
[time=2345] Genesis 3.
[time=2350] This is not an excuse.
[time=2352] Man, I'm just helping you see where it started, alright?
[time=2355] And this was an amazing thing for me when I first saw this.
[time=2358] Many of you may have seen this years ago.
[time=2360] It was news to me several years ago when I came across this truth.
[time=2366] Genesis 3.
[time=2367] We'll pick it up in verse 2 and the woman said to the serpent, "From the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat,
[time=2373] but from the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God has said, You shall not eat from it or touch it lest you die." And what the serpent said, "You won't die." He said to her, "You've got to be kidding." He's tempting.
[time=2390] Remember what the enemy does?
[time=2391] He tempts.
[time=2392] He deceives.
[time=2393] Remember?
[time=2394] There he goes.
[time=2395] And the serpent said to the woman, "You surely shall not die.
[time=2398] For God knows that in the day you eat from it your eyes will be opened and you will be like God knowing good and evil."
[time=2404] And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was a delight to the eyes
[time=2410] and that the tree was desirable to make one wise.
[time=2413] Now she's bought into the lie.
[time=2415] She took from its fruit and ate.
[time=2417] Here you go.
[time=2418] And she gave also to her husband.
[time=2422] What does your Bible say?
[time=2424] Who was where?
[time=2428] Did she have to go and get him?
[time=2433] No.
[time=2436] Did she have to go look for him in some place in the garden and bring him back and catch him up on all that had happened and then say no.
[time=2442] Where did he say he was?
[time=2444] With her.
[time=2448] It never struck me like that before.
[time=2449] Just a few years ago I realized he saw the entire dialogue.
[time=2458] He's her husband.
[time=2460] He's supposed to be there for her to love and cherish and protect.
[time=2464] She was his to guard and to care for.
[time=2468] And she gets reeled in by the master deceiver himself.
[time=2473] She gets fed the entire thing. She bites. She takes it. She enters into sin and he watches the entire thing and doesn't say a word.
[time=2485] Silent.
[time=2488] Absolutely silent.
[time=2493] We often think of the sin of the garden as being the taking of the fruit.
[time=2497] You know what? The more and more I think about it.
[time=2499] I feel like the sin of the garden was the man's silence.
[time=2504] And men we have been silent ever since.
[time=2511] God's design requires courageous men.
[time=2516] And you can write these things down real quick guys. Three things I believe courageous men do.
[time=2520] You ready? Courageous men speak.
[time=2523] Having listened. Okay? Now follow me. Having listened carefully. Courageous men speak.
[time=2532] Now by speak I don't mean eloquently. By speak I don't mean perfectly. By speak I don't mean in a fashion that captivates your family and draws them to know.
[time=2544] Because sometimes you know what guys we don't know what to say.
[time=2548] Sometimes having carefully listened we don't know where to go. Sometimes in the midst of a troubled teen or a discouraged wife we have know what.
[time=2560] But a courageous man tries.
[time=2565] Having carefully listened he opens his mouth and he tries.
[time=2571] And there is not a woman in this room married today. I'll bet my mortgage there's not a woman in this room today who wouldn't just love at those times to at least hear you try.
[time=2584] Hearing you try would be so much better than hearing what ladies?
[time=2595] Courageous men speak. Secondly courageous men prayerfully decide. Write it down they prayerfully decide.
[time=2605] I don't mean that they make every decision I don't mean that they're always the one who has to tell us what we're going to do when we're going to do it how it's.
[time=2613] No I mean life is full of decisions guys in the home with a wife in the home with some kids decisions all the time need to be made regarding your spiritual life in that home regarding the physical life and regarding I mean regarding everything.
[time=2630] Education entertainment church friends family tons of decisions and too many times in the midst of decisions that need to be made men are silent.
[time=2642] Men courageous men prayerfully having thoughtfully listened and having prayerfully considered courageous men are willing having and having asked for some help having heard opinions courageous men are willing to make decisions.
[time=2660] Now guess what they may not always be the right one you might as I have many times been supported by a wife who I think in the back of her head knew you've been there ladies you knew it was a bad decision.
[time=2677] But you were going to do your best to stand by him and help him so he makes the decision and you give it a couple hours or a couple days and boom flat on his face.
[time=2687] And sometimes my bad decisions my flat on my face decisions didn't just cost me pride sometimes they cost us money sometimes they cost us things valuable to us.
[time=2698] But you know what if you ask her today she would have rather been by my side while I was laying on my face then way back here having to make all the way decisions herself.
[time=2709] Men courageous men try they don't live in silence they speak they prayerfully make decisions thirdly they stay involved they stay involved.
[time=2720] Right that down they stay involved men courageous men stay involved when it gets really confusing when it gets really scary when it gets really threatening when it gets really uncomfortable when the topic and the tenor and the attitude
[time=2734] and the volume it all begins to kind of unravel courageous men don't run courageous men don't don't respond to the beeper gotta go courageous men courageous men stay involved.
[time=2749] I think about that passage in first Peter three can turn there if you like it's always just a glaring reminder to good reminder but just a and so few words he says so much in first Peter three it says husbands for seven.
[time=2764] You husbands likewise first Peter three chapter seven you husbands likewise live with your wives in an understanding way and we can crack all the jokes which I won't and we can make all the funny statements which I won't about how it's impossible to understand them.
[time=2784] Well you know what guys quit laughing because it's not and we laugh about it and we make the jokes about it because you know why because we're weak silent men too many times and it's easier to laugh about how hard it is to understand them
[time=2801] it's easier to laugh about it than to roll up our sleeves and what work at it work hard at it work diligently at it.
[time=2813] Husbands likewise live with your wives in an understanding way and I don't have to tell you if you've been married but understanding her understanding them understanding it it's not a 15 minute conversation
[time=2830] there is at least I haven't bumped into any of those.
[time=2835] No it's days it's weeks it's continuing to ask the same questions it's continuing to try and understand the same responses it's called staying involved.
[time=2846] I'm going to put my arms the arms of my heart and mind around my wife and my kids in this home and when confusion sets in I'm going to do my very best to speak and pray to God that it makes sense
[time=2858] if it doesn't he'll help me figure it out later I'm going to decide when decisions need to be made by me and I'll do that thoughtfully and consider it and I will stay involved
[time=2869] no matter how dark it gets no matter how confusing it gets no matter where they go no matter what they do I will be there for them.
[time=2879] God's desire God's design requires thirdly trusting women trusting women now you know what and with me here because to talk about trusting women I'm going to go back and I'm going to say the same thing watch this.
[time=2894] In 14 years of ministry and counseling in 13 years of marriage several which were less than stellar from the accounts I've read from the tapes that I've listened to from the conference and seminar speeches I've heard if you ask me to summarize
[time=2908] the greatest weakness of most wives and mothers it would be that they're not silent enough and again that's not meant to be funny not silent enough a lack of a silent presence
[time=2928] typically too much is said typically too much is done and here's the point listen closely ladies I hope I hope I'm making sense and you can correct me if I'm not giving it my best here as a wife as a mother
[time=2942] guess what it takes to not say too much guess what it takes to not suggest too much guess what it takes to not correct criticize or complain too much guess what it takes for a woman to pray more and manipulate less
[time=2957] the answer trust trust in who him as in small h the one you're like you're married to no no to do all of that takes great trust in him capital h and in his design call it what you will but when a wife mother really begins to believe that true change and genuine growth in the life of a husband son or daughter
[time=2986] is primarily and most importantly an act of God not her when she sees that when she really begins to embrace that truth when she really begins to put the arms of her heart and mind around that that change real growth in the life of a husband son or daughter is primarily
[time=3006] an act an act of God and not her when that connection is made she can trust more say less and live right that's right live right look at Titus chapter two we're almost done
[time=3023] look at Titus chapter two pie in the sky ladies some pipe dream no I don't think so I think it's something that you can accomplish I think it's something he wants to help you with a life of trust in him in his design
[time=3043] a life of character older um Titus chapter two here we are back uh verse three again sorry for the whole older word thing we'll just kind of go right past that real quick older women likewise are to be reverent in their behavior not malicious
[time=3062] gossips not enslaved to much wine teaching what is good that they may encourage the young women to love their husbands to love their children to be sensible pure workers at home kind being subject to their own husbands that the husband may not be dishonored
[time=3082] ladies no that God may not be dishonored God's design requires trusting women full of character willing to live their lives as he's called them to live it willing to diligently give themselves to things that truly make a difference
[time=3102] in a home look at those things we just read through a life given to those things and we could add even more to that but a life given to character a life given to integrity a life as a woman given to God's design willing to trust him even when this doesn't make a whole lot of sense
[time=3120] a willingness to trust him is enormous and lastly and I'm just going to say this and we'll talk more about it in a few weeks God's design requires kids committed to honor it requires a man and a woman and some kids committed
[time=3137] to honor and we'll talk more about it Bert and Sandy could you guys come up just real quick I wanted to just end our time this morning it was so much fun to kind of just think through with Casey we just kind of tried to kind of capture a moment
[time=3155] there you know as if she had come in last night and seen all of that and Casey there you go you can just stand right here next to me you know Casey being engaged in all really has those questions
[time=3166] she really wonders you know can it be done is it possible and I just thought you know it would be great to end our time this morning with one of many in this church these are not the only ones and by ones I mean good examples
[time=3183] and it's not so much about Bert and Sandy this is Bert and Sandy Wright and this isn't so much about Bert and Sandy Wright this is about God's faithfulness because you have here a couple who put on the dress did you wear a tux but they have tux is back then
[time=3200] I can ask him questions like that he put on a suit and tie and Sandy put on a dress in 1950 and 50 years later 50 years later after a road that hasn't not been without its challenges
[time=3226] they stand here before us in essence saying hey everybody it does work it can happen regardless of where you've been regardless of what you've experienced you can experience a love a family a relationship that is God honoring just real quick because
[time=3243] I went a little bit late I'm going to just ask you guys if you would just two things first of all Sandy when you hear these words and you hear them and you go to weddings I hear them when I do them I sandy take the birth to be my wedded husband and I do promise and covenant before God
[time=3260] and these witnesses to be your loving and faithful wife and abundance and need and join and sorrow and sickness and in health till death to us part I mean when you hear that today
[time=3271] where does your mind go what is your heart what do you feel when you hear those words today some 50 years after saying those things to birth?
[time=3280] well of course we came to Christ 25 years after we were into that marriage but even when I write cards today to new couples that are getting married I always put the same thing in to keep your hand in the hand of Christ
[time=3299] and joy will fail your life it won't be easy yeah but the joy will be there and that to me is the most important thing at all
[time=3309] well said and Bert maybe just in a phrase or two how would you describe Sandy mentioned 25 years into that marriage you guys came to know the Lord what kind of a difference did he make in your guys' marriage and in your family
[time=3324] very great difference even though I was a PK for many many years as you know that was a Methodist minister but I never really knew the Lord until I came here to Black Hawk
[time=3337] wow I lived the life as best I could but I had my problems like every every other young male adult but until we came here and really came to know the Lord
[time=3353] and then our life changed completely absolutely completely and we were so grateful that Black Hawk was here we lived right across the street and we really came to know him in a very personal way
[time=3370] and thank God our whole family our three children their spouses and our nine grandchildren have all made decisions for the Lord as well
[time=3379] and you just got back from a week at the lake with our whole crew didn't we sure did yeah could I say too that that you know before that time Kelly there was nothing really to hold on to to make decisions
[time=3391] I mean you had all this societal change and it was really horrendous when you're not a Christian because you go by your good sense and it's not very reliable sometimes it wasn't so good
[time=3404] so when we really when we really accepted Christ and he was the center of our life we really had a map for living
[time=3412] and boy we had a lot of problems and there's many people in this congregation that prayed for us for years in our children and you know the problems were tough
[time=3424] but the joy in the Lord was unspeakable and just having this these Christian people to love you and pray for you and support you I can't even explain what that was like
[time=3437] but it really made our marriage as we were down at the lake this week we had four we have a devotions in the evening
[time=3444] and Jeremiah who was our oldest gave devotions the very last night we were there and some of the other we had we have six grandsons and three of the others led in devotions and you know it just makes you want to weep because it's so precious
[time=3459] yeah that's a sweet picture well thank you guys let me just ask the rest of you if you'd stand and as you stand again just I hope your hearts are full of thankfulness
[time=3468] for the design that God's word does give us and for people like bird and sandy and there are others in our church married 50 years and more who are for us a great example of faithfulness thanks for hanging in I know we're late let me pray and then we'll go father thank you so much for the
[time=3483] the design for family the design for marriage that you've given got each of us needs courage and we need a willingness in our heart to embrace it some some of us in ways
[time=3493] and to levels that we never have before so God in the weeks to come teach us and grow us in that direction and we'll thank you for it in your son's name we pray amen.
