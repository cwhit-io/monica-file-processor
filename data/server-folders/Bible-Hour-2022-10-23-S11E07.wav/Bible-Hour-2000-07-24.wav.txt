[time=0] (upbeat music) - Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service
[time=12] of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=14] Thank you for joining us.
[time=15] We trust that the music and message from God's word will help you in your Christian walk.
[time=20] Now let's join our service.
[time=22] - My early teenage years, my mother was my spiritual mentor.
[time=28] She was the one that I always went to church with on Sunday, usually just her and I.
[time=33] And of course the main hook for me was that I was just fresh with a driver's license and just so I got to drive.
[time=40] And that was the big trait.
[time=41] So I always went to church with her on Sunday.
[time=44] And growing up, I became rebellious as all teenagers do and went into the service and come out of the service and thought I pretty well knew everything there was to know.
[time=56] And was telling her about a weekend that I had planned.
[time=58] And she said to me, you know, she said, you really shouldn't do that.
[time=61] That's not a good thing for you to do.
[time=63] And I said, now mother, you know, I'm 21 now and you really can't tell me what to do anymore.
[time=71] And she said to me, she says, well, she says, I can do something for you that you can't help and you can't stop.
[time=81] And I said, what's that?
[time=84] She says, I'm going to pray for you as I have in past years.
[time=88] And that you can't stop me from.
[time=92] And I never told her after that, but the weekend that I was planning, I didn't go.
[time=100] Simply because that hit home and I kind of hung my head and thought about it for a long while.
[time=106] And I knew it was true because she was always on her knees before God for all of her children.
[time=113] And even in later years, I really got to know and draw close to her probably in the last five years of her life when she used to come over to visit.
[time=123] And we would sit on the couch and speak about God and about different world things till 11, 30, 12 o'clock at night.
[time=132] We would stay up just talking.
[time=133] And I really enjoyed her wisdom and I've tried to pass it on to my children.
[time=140] She also had a lot to do with Renee coming to Christ.
[time=145] Her letters to Renee was a big inspiration for Renee to finally realize that she needed God.
[time=152] And so, mother, if you're still watching and I believe you're aware of everything that's going on and I know that you once again are on your knees to God for us.
[time=166] Thank you.
[time=167] Thank you very much, mother.
[time=170] I love you.
[time=171] [MUSIC - 218 seconds]
[time=392] - Kelly asked me probably about two months ago
[time=409] if I would speak today and he gave the date and he said, "Would you be willing to?" And I said, "Well, okay," then he says, "But I want to pick the topic." Well, I had already said yes to speaking and he says, "Well, I would like you." You could tell he's six foot seven, can't you?
[time=429] I'm six foot four and I feel like it's right there.
[time=432] Anyway, he just a little distraction there.
[time=436] He said, "I want you to speak on wives and mothers' influence."
[time=442] And I thought, "Well, thanks, Kelly." This seems to be a pattern.
[time=448] You did this to Steve Longbrake a couple weeks ago when you asked him to preach on the word or the verse, wives being submission to your husbands.
[time=458] And since Steve did such a good job on that, I'll steer clear of it.
[time=463] And we're gonna be in Deuteronomy chapter six today, but I want to open up with a few things that really reflects a mother's world in a wise world.
[time=474] In the 1960s, there was a man that stole the hearts of mothers and wives across the nation.
[time=482] He wasn't a pro-athlete.
[time=487] He wasn't a movie star, that was a big hunk.
[time=491] He had a talk show and his talk shows weren't celebrities.
[time=496] His talk show were children.
[time=500] In the name of the show, if you remember, those of you over 40, his kids say the darnest things.
[time=507] And if I would ask you, those of you over 40, who was this person, all of you over 40 would say?
[time=513] - Heart and pleasure.
[time=515] - And he made his way in the hearts of mothers and women across the nation.
[time=521] And so in the spirit, in the same spirit as our link letter, you know, of course, all the kids were sitting on stools and he'd go out there with his microphone and he would kneel.
[time=530] And there was something about art, and Bill Cosby's a little bit different.
[time=535] Bill talks too much, but art wouldn't say a whole lot.
[time=538] Bill likes to be the kid.
[time=541] Art was the adult talking with the children, but he could get any kid to say just about anything.
[time=546] So he'd line up what, four or five kids.
[time=549] And the nation would lock in on his TV show and listen to these kids, win some late, unrehearsed, answer the questions before a live audience.
[time=558] And of course, the audience were about to fall off their chair sometimes with laughter.
[time=562] So we want to review just a few of these to kind of get in the spirit of a mother's world and the world of the housewife.
[time=570] Mike H. Tim, the kids were asked to give advice on what they should never do.
[time=575] Mike H. Tim says, when your dad is really mad and asks you, do I look stupid?
[time=582] Don't answer him.
[time=584] (audience laughing) Wyatt, age 11, gives us some advice we'll probably never use as city slickers in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=595] Don't squat with your spurs on.
[time=598] (audience laughing) And then he said another one that I don't care to repeat.
[time=605] Megan, age nine, says, when your mom is mad at your dad, don't let her brush your hair.
[time=612] (audience laughing) Timmy, age seven, when mom wants you to clean up around the house, never, never hold a dust buster in your cat at the same time.
[time=623] (audience laughing) Chris, age nine, never pick on your sister when she's holding the baseball bat.
[time=629] Lisa, age 11, when you get a very bad grade in school, short to your mom when she's on the phone.
[time=635] (audience laughing) When they're asked these questions, they're where their answers.
[time=640] When asked, what do most people do on a date?
[time=643] Michael, age nine said, on the first date, they just tell lies.
[time=647] That usually gets them interested enough to go on a second date.
[time=650] (audience laughing) Question is it better to be single or married?
[time=654] Lynette, age nine, replied, it's better for girls to be single, but not for boys.
[time=659] Boys need somebody to clean up after them.
[time=662] (audience laughing) When does love, question, when does love begin between two grownups?
[time=668] Jason, age seven said, I think you're supposed to get shot with an arrow or something, but the rest of it isn't supposed to be so painful.
[time=677] (audience laughing) Question, what is falling in love like?
[time=682] Roger, age eight says, like an avalanche where you have to run for your life.
[time=686] (audience laughing) Lisa, age seven answered, if falling in love is anything like learning how to do math, I don't want to do it, it takes too long.
[time=697] (audience laughing) Question, what does good looks have to do with love?
[time=701] Gary, age seven said, it isn't always just how you look.
[time=705] Look at me, I'm handsome like anything, and I haven't got anybody to marry me yet.
[time=709] (audience laughing) Question, what are some surefire ways to make a person fall in love with you and want to marry you?
[time=718] Alan, age six says, tell them that you own a whole bunch of candy stores.
[time=723] (audience laughing) Bard, age nine, a little more mature says, one way is to take a girl out to eat, make sure it's something she likes to eat.
[time=732] French fries usually work for me.
[time=734] (audience laughing) How do you make love last forever?
[time=738] Randy, age eight says, be a good kisser, it might make your wife forget you never take out the trash.
[time=744] (audience laughing) And finally, just a few more.
[time=747] Sometimes it's apparent, do you feel like second fiddle?
[time=752] Our daughter's second grade class was asked to write about her personal heroes.
[time=757] My husband was flatter to find out that our daughter had chosen him.
[time=762] Why did you pick me, he asked her later, because I couldn't spell Arnold Schwarzenegger, she replied.
[time=768] (audience laughing) If you want the truth, you got it.
[time=772] Sometimes kids tell the truth whether you like it or not.
[time=775] My wife got a perm in her hair and was proud of how she looked.
[time=780] I couldn't get all that excited about it because us men don't have the surprise gene in our body.
[time=786] Especially since I didn't anticipate it coming this time.
[time=789] When my wife asked our four-year-old son how it looked, he summed it up in these words.
[time=795] You look like, hmm, somebody else's mommy.
[time=799] Or beauty isn't in the eye of the beholder.
[time=803] A mother says this story, I was putting on my Mary Kay facial mask to improve my complexion.
[time=809] As usual, my four-year-old son wanted to touch it.
[time=812] After I washed my face, I asked my son if he wanted to touch my face and see how soft it was.
[time=819] He held my face tenderly beneath his tiny soft hands.
[time=823] How does it feel, I asked expecting him to say, nice.
[time=827] Instead, my little guy replied, it feels like the toilet lid.
[time=831] (audience laughing)
[time=842] In the last one, some kids need more creative form of discipline than other kids.
[time=848] A father recounts his story.
[time=850] I went into my five-year-old son's bedroom to hear his prayers and kiss him good night.
[time=855] Having not shaved for two days, my whiskers were rough against my child's soft cheeks.
[time=859] My son certainly had an opinion about my unshaven face.
[time=863] A daddy, he said, and exasperated tone.
[time=866] The next time I'm naughty, you could use your face to punish me.
[time=870] (audience laughing) You know, a mother's world is a world of interacting with a husband and with children.
[time=880] Sometimes she's out in the work world, but I would have to say these things about a mother and wife's key influence.
[time=887] Being a good wife and a mother is one of the most challenging and rewarding role that anybody can have.
[time=896] Let me say that again.
[time=898] Being a good wife and mother is the most challenging and rewarding role that a human being could have.
[time=905] It requires that she be amazingly tender.
[time=908] It also requires that she be very tough and do some things that is very uncomfortable in terms of nurturing her kids along.
[time=917] I brought a little friend here.
[time=918] I wanna talk to the six to 10-year-olds who are sitting in here.
[time=921] What is this?
[time=922] Oh, I can't hear you.
[time=925] A giraffe.
[time=927] You know, you've probably seen a giraffe at the zoo, but a few years ago, I was in Africa and the giraffes in the zoo are dwarfs compared to giraffes that live in the wild.
[time=938] The first time I saw one up close, I go, oh man, it's the tallest animal on the face of the earth.
[time=946] Now I wanna talk to you kids a little bit about the birth of a calf.
[time=951] The baby giraffe is called the calf.
[time=955] Well, when a giraffe, a mother giraffe is ready to give birth to a calf, the calf drops from the mother head and hooves first, about eight to 10 feet.
[time=966] Now think about that, kids.
[time=968] Some of you six-year-olds can't even hit the basketball rim, which is at 10 feet.
[time=973] So this calf, you think your birth was rough, how would you like to fall 10 feet on the back of your neck?
[time=982] And they land there and it's been told by Gary Richmond who writes a view from the zoo that some of them are not unconscious when they're born.
[time=993] And some of them start whining and howling kind of, but anyway, they're the giraffe lay on the ground after getting beat to death from this 10 foot fall and the mother begins to gently and tenderly lick the face of the giraffe.
[time=1009] And if you'd see this on a video, you'd go, oh, that's cute.
[time=1013] The giraffe's ears are kind of floppy until they learn to stand up.
[time=1017] So this thing here, great distances, the predator's coming, but she starts to lick the giraffe and clean the birthing fluid from the baby giraffe, from the calf.
[time=1027] And then she does the most amazing thing.
[time=1031] She backs away from the calf with her long pendulum legs begins to kick the snot out of the thing.
[time=1039] Just kick it over and over and over.
[time=1041] She kicks this giraffe, sometimes kicks it in the head, sometimes kicks it in the rump.
[time=1046] And you go, stop her, she's gone mad.
[time=1048] She's got postpartum depression or something is wrong with this giraffe.
[time=1054] But finally, her goal is to get this calf to stand up and finally it stands up and you can imagine, you're going, she's gonna quit kicking it now.
[time=1065] And then she spins around with her front leg, knocks the legs out from under the calf and boom, over it goes again.
[time=1073] If it doesn't get right back up, she starts kicking it again.
[time=1077] And she kicks it and kicks it and kicks it till it stands up again.
[time=1081] Well, what is she trying to do?
[time=1083] First, she's been very tender with this newborn calf, but all of a sudden she gets very tough.
[time=1089] You see, if this calf doesn't learn within a few hours to stand up and be able to run with the herd, the lions and the cheetahs will take it.
[time=1101] As a scrumptious meal.
[time=1105] And so the mother knows if this calf doesn't remember how to get up like that when the herd sounds the warning and a lot of mothers have to be this way.
[time=1115] They're very tender with kids, but they sometimes have to sound the alarm and it's sometimes their heart that breaks.
[time=1121] What I wanna say to some of you six to 10 year olds, don't break your mother's heart.
[time=1127] Don't make it rough for her.
[time=1129] Make it so that your mom when you are an adult will say it was a rewarding experience.
[time=1136] More than a challenging experience.
[time=1138] Now, second, a mother, a good wife and a mother is the most sacrificial role that a person can have in life.
[time=1147] Now, think about it.
[time=1148] A mother is a cook, she's a taxi, she's a nurse, she's a counselor, she's an organizer, she's an athletic director and all the things that she does, you know, it starts with getting pregnant and what do you have ladies?
[time=1165] First few weeks.
[time=1167] Morning sickness, yeah, you got the flu.
[time=1170] And then the next thing you know at the end of eight to nine months you have labor pains that don't end for another 20 years.
[time=1180] And you think about it, if you men, if you had three kids and you lost your wife and you wanted to hire a nanny to do everything that your wife did, she would live in the home in her own separate quarters, she would eat off of your table, would drive your car, take your kids around, do all those things.
[time=1198] Let's say if we pay her minimum wage, minimum wage.
[time=1202] Now, keep in mind she's on call 24 hours a day if there's a sick kid, she gets up with them.
[time=1207] We're gonna pay her minimum wage till three kids are grown.
[time=1210] She will have in her bank account $1.2 million.
[time=1215] And that's in no interest bearing account.
[time=1218] If she'd put all this in stock, by the time she raises your three kids, which will take about 24 years, she would have $8,500,000 being paid at minimum wage.
[time=1229] Ladies, do you feel like you're under compensated for the job that you do?
[time=1234] Finally, the third one is being a good wife and a mother is the most influential role that anyone can have.
[time=1242] Now, when you see on national TV and they're standing out on a sidewalk and people are in the background and there's this kid with purple hair and he's got enough staples in his face, you know, to, you wonder how he can even get his head up.
[time=1258] He's got so much stuff in, stuck in his lip and there's tongue and everything.
[time=1262] And what does he say when he gets up into the screen or the camera, he says, "Hi, Mom." And you know, what do people always say on TV when they get a chance, "Hi, Mom." And they have all kinds of signals that says, "Hi, Mom," or, "I love you, Mom." Even if she isn't a good mom, people, it just kind of, it's almost like instinctive to say, "Hi, Mom," when you get on TV.
[time=1288] And there is also untold stories and my mother's love and influence.
[time=1295] And we could go on and on about that, but there's also no pain more devastating than the rejection of a mother.
[time=1302] Now, there's a lot of talk about fatherlessness in our country, but I would dare say as a professional counselor that if you show me a man who has a deep sense of insecurity in his life, I will also find a man who feels a deep sense of rejection from his mother.
[time=1322] If you show me a man who doesn't, even though he's very successful in his career, and he's very effective out there in the marketplace, if he has a deep sense of a lack of confidence, it probably has to do with his wife's critical spirit and lack of confidence in him.
[time=1343] And there are you mothers and wives and aunts
[time=1351] and sisters, there is no one who has more influence than you.
[time=1357] Even when you feel powerless, you cannot not be influential.
[time=1362] You're either bad influence or good influence or somewhere in between, but you cannot get out of being influential with your family and those around you.
[time=1373] Something that really tends to affect a family is a critical spirit of the mother.
[time=1380] The Bible says this and it won't be up on the screen, but it's Proverbs 10, 19 says this, "When words are many, sin is not absent." Now I'll probably get quoted on this from one of two of my kids this next week because I'll probably do this once.
[time=1395] But I will say this and I'll give them permission to call me on this.
[time=1399] Lecturing is sin because what do we do when we lecture?
[time=1404] We've run out of other things to say and what the stupid has set in.
[time=1409] And we should probably be quicker to action and less to lecture.
[time=1413] The second one is reckless words pierce like a sword, but the tongue of the wise brings healing, Proverbs 12, 18.
[time=1421] Your tongue is the barometer of your heart.
[time=1425] A father can be critical and damage his kids, but a mother's critical spirit because of the power of her influence has deep piercing reckless damage
[time=1438] in the lives of young people.
[time=1440] Every mother's been there that she has said something that she's gone to sleep or a late embedded night and cried herself to sleep because of the words that she has said.
[time=1450] Finally, the last verse, better to live on the corner of a roof than share a house with a nagging wife.
[time=1456] I don't know about hanging on the edge of my roof.
[time=1460] It's kind of a dangerous place, but this brother pretty well says you're probably better off there than in the house.
[time=1468] However, some of you men really set a climate where it makes it really easy for her to be an ag and don't give her that opportunity by making the climate ripe for her to want to do so.
[time=1482] However, we are to be godly people, not because our husbands give us the opportunity or don't, but because God expects us to.
[time=1493] It's an honorable position to be and we are to respond with dignity and not to nag.
[time=1501] Now, there's something that I kind of run into quite a bit in the counseling office.
[time=1507] I call it the Billy Graham syndrome, where wives have these incredible expectations of their Christian husbands that the husband knows down deep inside I'll never be able to fulfill this side of heaven.
[time=1521] Why I call it the Billy Graham syndrome is it's for 95% of the men out there, it's unrealistic what you're expecting them to be and do sometimes.
[time=1531] And that's very discouraging to them.
[time=1534] What I call the Billy Graham syndrome is because if you've read Billy Graham's autobiography or read anything by his wife, Ruth Graham, you find out he was no angel himself.
[time=1544] Ruth Graham who is just as articulate as her husband has been, people have tried to pin her down in interviews a number of times about her marriage.
[time=1553] One time on a TV talk show, they said Ruth, have you ever with Billy traveling around be gone for months at a time, that kind of thing and you have all these children to raise, have you ever considered divorce?
[time=1564] She says, divorce never, homicide maybe.
[time=1569] And she says this about conflict with Billy.
[time=1575] Well, yeah, we do have, if we never had conflict, I guess then one of us isn't very necessary, are we?
[time=1581] Now let's look at the objectives here of what I really wanna hit today.
[time=1588] We're gonna be in Deuteronomy chapter six.
[time=1590] You won't have to turn there yet.
[time=1591] But let's look on the screen.
[time=1594] You'll see the objectives.
[time=1595] It's what qualities is a mother wife to pass along to the family?
[time=1601] What life-giving principles are mother's wives to influence her family towards?
[time=1606] These are the two questions that Kelly gave me and said, please would you answer these questions?
[time=1611] In other words, what does God's woman look like?
[time=1616] What does God's woman look like?
[time=1618] I have a mirror here and when you look in the mirror, who do you see?
[time=1622] And I'm not talking about physically what you look like, but what do you see in terms of character?
[time=1628] Now on the back of this, I bought this mirror for my wife one year for anniversary, which is the day after Christmas and I have to admit, I want to buy something that communicated a message, nothing fancy, something simple that communicated a message and I wanted to get engraved on the back of this mirror.
[time=1645] That had a couple weeks, a verse in the Bible.
[time=1651] And I took it to the shop and I finally gave up on the engraving on wood.
[time=1654] Nobody would do it because of the mirror on the other side.
[time=1657] But I went to a trophy shop and said, could I get an engraving put on this plaque on the back?
[time=1663] And they said, yeah, I said, how long would it take?
[time=1667] Could you do it today or tomorrow?
[time=1669] Well, this was like December 23rd and they said, no, it'll probably take, it'll probably be next week.
[time=1674] We are really backed up right now.
[time=1677] And as the lady wrote it down, I gave her this verse, part of this verse to my Debbie, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit with my love, Denny.
[time=1692] And the lady got real quiet standing at the counter and she started to cry and I said, are you okay?
[time=1698] And she kind of nods her head and I said, do you want, I'll listen, do you want to talk?
[time=1702] You know, I guess that accounts with, is there something you want to talk about?
[time=1705] No, no, no, I'm okay.
[time=1707] And she told me this would be a week and they called me the next morning and said, Mr. Howard, you need to come in and pick up your mirror.
[time=1714] It's done.
[time=1714] And when I picked it up, I said, I thought it was going to take a week and the other lady came out another way.
[time=1720] She said, she was so moved by the same and said to me, I wish someone felt that way about me.
[time=1728] The unfade one who possesses that unfading beauty of a quiet and gentle spirit.
[time=1735] What do you see when you look in the mirror?
[time=1739] Let's move on here to some verses here.
[time=1742] What does she look like?
[time=1743] The verses, two of them, one from the Old Testament is about David, man looks up on the outward appearance, but God looks up on the heart.
[time=1753] Verse saying, you know, 16, verse seven.
[time=1755] And then, first Peter three, three, and four, you get the verse that's on the mirror, your beauty should not come from outward appearances.
[time=1762] Instead, it should be that of your inner self possessing the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God's sight.
[time=1771] Now, I know some of you women have strong personalities out there and you're going, yeah, I'll never be this.
[time=1780] Well, let me help you a little bit.
[time=1783] This doesn't mean that you have to be a quiet person.
[time=1788] Although it probably would help some of you to be quiet or a gentle, the word gentle here in the original text, it means like a tamed animal.
[time=1803] So it literally means a woman who is controlled or directed or compelled by God's spirit, tamed by God's spirit.
[time=1813] That means your nature is much more wild, much more angry, much more forth, right?
[time=1818] Much more direct, much more passive aggressive.
[time=1821] Then what's really going on?
[time=1822] Why?
[time=1823] Because you are being led by God's spirit.
[time=1825] What does the quiet mean?
[time=1827] Quiet and gentle are gentle and quiet spirit.
[time=1831] It means that your heart is quieting.
[time=1836] Your heart is not storming.
[time=1838] It doesn't necessarily mean that you have to be quiet verbally.
[time=1842] You feel better already?
[time=1845] Okay, so I didn't want to eliminate some of the gals with strong personalities here.
[time=1852] But God's woman possesses these things.
[time=1854] If you look at these verses and what we're about to look at in Deuteronomy chapter six, she possesses a faith that is life oriented.
[time=1864] It should be on the screen, it's coming up here.
[time=1867] A faith that is life oriented, not just information oriented.
[time=1872] That doesn't mean she just knows the Bible, but she lives the Bible.
[time=1877] The second thing that she possesses, is she possesses, God's woman possesses, a fashion of the heart, not the fashion of the body.
[time=1890] She possesses a fashion of the heart, not the fashion of the body.
[time=1896] Now let me say this.
[time=1898] If a house needs painting, paint it, okay?
[time=1901] If you need a little makeup, you need a little makeup.
[time=1904] I'm not discouraging that you dress well, that you are good steward of your body, that you take care of yourself.
[time=1913] But God's word says very clearly that you are to be involved in a fashion of the heart, that it is the character and the deepest part of you that matters.
[time=1926] Now let's look at Deuteronomy chapter six.
[time=1931] If you turn with me, in the Old Testament, it's the fifth book in the Old Testament.
[time=1938] Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy chapter six.
[time=1945] You don't have your Bible will be up on the screen.
[time=1947] Verse five, love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.
[time=1955] These commandments that I give you today are to be up on your hearts and press them up on your children.
[time=1962] Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up.
[time=1969] Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them to your foreheads.
[time=1974] Write them on the door frames of your house and on your gates.
[time=1978] Now we're going to be weaving this throughout the last four points that I want to make here in terms of God's woman.
[time=1986] You need to know that when this was given that the Jewish people, pious Jewish people would quote these verses twice a day.
[time=1998] They would put them in flactories on their wrists and tie them on their forehead.
[time=2003] But what would this look like in our modern day context?
[time=2007] Let's look at some of these things.
[time=2009] It says it is to be written up on your heart.
[time=2012] Remember a fashion of the heart, not outward appearance.
[time=2017] When I put it in terms of men having a fashion of the heart, I would say fellows, a fashion of the heart, character of the heart, not being an image manager.
[time=2027] In this society, in the culture we live in, too much of our world is bent towards image management.
[time=2034] There are people who lack substance but have incredible images.
[time=2040] But when it comes to anything of any real character, there is nothing there.
[time=2044] It's to be on your heart.
[time=2048] What would that symbolize today?
[time=2050] That by the things you do and the activities that you're involved in, people will know that there is something different about you.
[time=2059] That the activities of the day will reflect a transformed heart, a life that God has gotten a hold of.
[time=2068] It says it will be on your forehead.
[time=2073] In other words, the very thinking, your thinking processes will be so filled with God's word that everything in life will automatically go through the screen of how it lines up with what God has instructed us to do and how we are to live.
[time=2092] So it's to be on your hands.
[time=2094] It's to be on your foreheads.
[time=2096] It's to be on the door frames of your houses.
[time=2099] What would that look like in our modern day context?
[time=2103] That the things you buy and the things you own and your attitude towards material possessions will be that which reflects godliness.
[time=2116] Now, I say this to some clients in counseling, marriage counseling, there's something they have come in, they don't pay their bills, but they come in and they keep coming in and they don't pay their bills.
[time=2127] Eventually, the counselor gets the awkward situation of having to talk about them paying their bills.
[time=2133] And I've actually had things like this said to me, well, Denny, we're building this house and we're really behind financially.
[time=2145] And I say something to them like, when you have to split that house in a divorce, you won't have a whole lot to spend at all unless you get your priorities straight of getting your house, your family in order and your marriage in order before you get your house, physical house built.
[time=2163] But that is someone whose mind is so bent on material things that there is not even any hedges to protect their marriage and to protect their family from the adversary.
[time=2175] Now, God's woman is faithful in these things.
[time=2180] Now we're gonna look at it from the perspective of the four E's.
[time=2183] Remember, exalting evangelism, edifying and you saw them on the screen just by coincidence unless God had it happen that way, but they're up on the screen when you just came in.
[time=2195] And I thought, well, great, I'll preach on that today since they're up there, but God's woman is faithful
[time=2204] in worship and prayer.
[time=2207] In other words, exalting God, she's faithful in worship and prayer.
[time=2211] The verse is Deuteronomy six, five and six says, love the Lord your God with all your heart and all your soul and all your strength.
[time=2218] Jesus adds in all your mind because in the culture that he lived in, mental pursuits were the main thing.
[time=2226] So he adds all your strength and all your mind.
[time=2229] These commandments I give you today are to be up on your heart.
[time=2234] Now, this means that the mother and the wife
[time=2240] is to be a person who is a lover of God, that her private worship and her corporate worship is one that expresses a godliness.
[time=2252] She prays for her family diligently.
[time=2255] Now, I wanna talk about my mother a little bit.
[time=2258] I got her permission to talk to her or talk about her.
[time=2262] It's interesting how we talked on the phone, but she sent me an email last night and said, please would you not talk about these things?
[time=2269] And she said, but will you talk about this?
[time=2272] And I thought, well, okay, I'll do that.
[time=2274] I'll talk about that because when I describe my mother, you will think she walks on water, but that's not true.
[time=2283] She's not necessarily a prolific communicator.
[time=2286] She's not necessarily highly educated.
[time=2289] She had a high school degree.
[time=2292] She was a genius and child rearing, but she had a high school degree and she was an evangelist.
[time=2300] And she is a woman whose life reflects Christ in every situation that I could ever remember.
[time=2307] I never remember a foul word ever coming out of her mouth.
[time=2312] She was absolutely devoted to evangelism, but I want you to know she wasn't necessarily this outgoing outspoken person who could meet anybody in any situation, anywhere and talk about anything.
[time=2323] She's kind of like Winnie the Pooh, would be probably a good way to describe my mom.
[time=2329] And she said, well, if you're only gonna tell the good things about me, she says, I want you to say this.
[time=2336] If you're gonna talk about the good things, she says, I want you to say it's because I had a husband who adored me and was deeply devoted to all my ministry endeavors.
[time=2349] And so I passed that on out of respect for her.
[time=2353] But the thing about my mother, in terms of this area of worship and prayer, she prayed for my wife, Debbie, for two dozen years before she met her.
[time=2364] I remember as a kid, her talking about praying for the woman who would someday be my wife.
[time=2370] And up until the day we got married, she had prayed for Debbie, from the day I was born to the time we got married and continues to pray.
[time=2379] And it's interesting, my wife became a Christian in adulthood.
[time=2384] She came to know the Lord.
[time=2386] It wasn't as a young child.
[time=2387] But I think it had a lot to do with the prayers of a grandmother and the prayers of my mother.
[time=2393] Here's a song I wanted to read here that kind of captures the essence of this, of what is wise of mothers.
[time=2401] You may wanna be committed to, and it fathers as well.
[time=2405] By Wayne Watson sings this song, "Somewhere in the World." Somewhere in the world today, a little girl will go out to play.
[time=2413] All dressed up and mom is close, at least the way I suppose it goes.
[time=2418] Somewhere in the world tonight, before she reaches to turn out the light, she'll be praying from a tender heart, a simple prayer that is a work of art.
[time=2428] And I don't even know her name, but I'm praying for her just the same that the Lord will write His name on her heart.
[time=2438] 'Cause somewhere in the course of this life, a little boy will need a godly wife.
[time=2444] So hold on to Jesus, baby, wherever you are.
[time=2448] Somewhere out there, that little girl is learning how to care, she's picking up her mom's charm, or maybe swinging around in her daddy's arms.
[time=2456] Somewhere in the world to be, though the future's not really clear to me, there could be a tender love grounded in eternal love above.
[time=2465] And I don't even know her name, but I'm praying for her just the same, that the Lord will write His name on her heart.
[time=2475] 'Cause somewhere in the course of this life, my little boy will need a godly wife.
[time=2480] So hold on to Jesus, baby, wherever you are, hold on to Jesus.
[time=2487] God's woman is faithful to encourage, to edify others, to build them up, impress up on your children, talk about it when you sit at home, and when you walk along the road, when you lie down, and when you get up.
[time=2504] Mothers know that the best opportunity to do this kind of thing is when you're riding around in a car, and when you're sitting on the bed, and it's time to go to sleep, and the kid wants to talk.
[time=2516] The kids want to talk, there's something about nighttime when it's time to go to sleep, that we all want to talk about something.
[time=2522] 'Til we become men, then we just want to go to sleep.
[time=2525] But my mother, in the example, and I do want to say this,
[time=2531] if I grew up in a country where the gospel was not spoken, where there was no Bible, where there was no churches, I would know everything I need to know to live a godly life.
[time=2542] By her example, in the example of my father, but she spent a great deal of her life encouraging other people, there was always somebody in our house, somebody always eating a meal with us.
[time=2552] My best friend in high school came from an abusive home.
[time=2556] His father and mother both were abusive, they both were drinkers, and my friend Kelly said, told my mom one time, he said, "You know, I'm a good dad, "but I want to tell you why, because I watched you and Bob "raise your kids, and I watched you discipline your kids, "and I watched you encourage your kids, "and I learned everything that I know about parenting "by watching the two of you.
[time=2584] "So God's woman is faithful and exalting and edifying "to worship and prayer, to encourage, and thirdly, "to share her faith, evangelizing, tie them as symbols
[time=2599] "on your hands, and bind them on your foreheads, "write them on the door frames of your houses, "and on your gates, Deuteronomy six, eight, nine, "that every part of your life should be about "being a salt and a light and a witness in your world." You know what?
[time=2615] Jesus said, "You are the salt of the earth, "you are the light, you shall be my witnesses." He didn't say, "This is an option.
[time=2623] "This is not an option for those of you "or children of God who are believers, "who have accepted Christ into your life.
[time=2630] "This is a mandate to do this.
[time=2634] "My mother was an incredible evangelist.
[time=2637] "I learned how to share the gospel with people "by watching her.
[time=2643] "I literally sat in the same room "when she shared the gospel with little children "in child evangelism.
[time=2651] "I saw her lead six, seven, eight-year-olds to Christ, "who are now Sunday school teachers "helping in children's departments "and are elders and deacons in their church.
[time=2663] "When I go back home, "I shake hands with them, I hug some of them.
[time=2667] "They were led to Christ by my mother "when they're five, six, seven, eight years old.
[time=2673] "When I was a teenager, it kind of grew with me.
[time=2676] "She didn't do as much with little kids.
[time=2678] "Now she was doing things with teenagers.
[time=2681] "She went to Illinois Boy School.
[time=2683] "We have Indiana Boy School.
[time=2684] "That's where you go.
[time=2685] "If you break into too many houses "and hit too many heads and do too many drugs, "at Illinois Boy School was about two miles from our house.
[time=2694] "And she would go in there and have a Bible class.
[time=2696] "I'm going, you've got to be kidding.
[time=2698] "You're having a Bible class in the state Boy School, "the detention facility.
[time=2702] "And there were several times she was allowed "to let me in if there was a security person "that would stay with me.
[time=2709] "So she taught this security person in.
[time=2711] "They called her mom.
[time=2713] "She would do these simple little Bible lessons.
[time=2716] "Someone would give their life to Christ "and they would come back every week when she was there.
[time=2723] "And they would listen to her stories and eat her cookies, "which didn't hurt things at all "for her to bring somewhere homemade cookies with her.
[time=2731] "But then there was a neighbor, "a couple that moved into our neighborhood, Sue, "who was a tiny little gal.
[time=2740] "And she was kind of, she could have been a bike chick, "with a gang riding on the back of a bicycle or a Harley-Davidson.
[time=2751] "And she was a cussing, a drinking, "a smoking, a carrying on, a partier, "a wild young woman that my mom befriended.
[time=2763] "And over the years she led Sue to Christ.
[time=2766] "It's interesting, there was a transformation "in the life of Sue.
[time=2771] "And she started studying her Bible.
[time=2772] "I'm not talking about it a little bit.
[time=2773] "I'm talking about several hours a day.
[time=2776] "And she is adept as any seminary student.
[time=2779] "Had a Bible study with women, "with hundreds of women over the years, "that she led to Christ.
[time=2786] "Why?
[time=2787] "Because this quiet, tender, "kind of when he pooish woman was willing "to share her faith without shame.
[time=2800] "Donne, the cussing truck driver on his deathbed, "my mom says, "The Lord's tell me I need to go "and share my faith with him.
[time=2809] "And she would go time after time.
[time=2812] "Quiet Jan would go see Donne.
[time=2816] "And finally, before he died, led him to Christ.
[time=2820] "She was committed to evangelism.
[time=2822] "Lastly, God's woman is faithful in sacrificial service.
[time=2827] "Service to the believer "should be what salvation is to the lost.
[time=2834] "God lives on a different economy.
[time=2837] "He says, "Take up your cross and follow me.
[time=2841] "Not get your nice car and follow me." He says, "When you have done it to the least of these, "you have done it to me.
[time=2848] "God's woman is faithful in sacrificial service.
[time=2852] "It's things that are great in God's kingdom "like wiping snotty noses at home and in the nursery.
[time=2858] "These are great things in God's eyes.
[time=2863] "These are the things that will be rewarded greatly "in his kingdom.
[time=2869] "When you do things and nobody knows it, "but it furthers God's kingdom.
[time=2875] "I saw this in my parents "when my dad got out of the Navy.
[time=2879] "We didn't have much of anything.
[time=2881] "I never could figure out why us children ate first "and they ate after us.
[time=2886] "It wasn't until I was in college "that I realized there was not enough food.
[time=2891] "And they would let us eat first "and anything that was left they would eat.
[time=2897] "And I watched that pattern throughout their life, "even though in their young years, "they did not have much.
[time=2902] "They were hardly kids themselves.
[time=2904] "They did not have much.
[time=2905] "They would share it with other people." Now some of this sounds like somebody who walks on water.
[time=2913] And I want to close with one illustration and one story.
[time=2916] We'll wrap up in just a few minutes here.
[time=2918] But she does not walk on water.
[time=2922] She is filled with the Holy Spirit.
[time=2926] And God is directing her life and in her own way, in her own world, has been a sphere of influence for the mother who did not work out of the home.
[time=2936] She taught piano in the home so she could stay in the home, but she was not saying anything's wrong with working out of the home.
[time=2942] But women, ladies, mothers, wives, you have an incredible influence.
[time=2948] Young ladies, 10, 12 years old, don't forget now, God is shaping your life that you will have an incredible influence in the world, in your world.
[time=2961] Now maybe, maybe you grew up in a difficult home.
[time=2965] And it's difficult for you to say, "You know, I can never, I can never be this." And I'm not suggesting that you do this in your own power.
[time=2977] And maybe you don't feel very valued.
[time=2981] Maybe you have a husband who doesn't act very much like he values you, maybe he doesn't.
[time=2987] Maybe he hasn't quite figured out that God has declared your value, not him.
[time=2991] He's a little bit confused about that.
[time=2993] Maybe you had a father or a mother who was a little bit confused about your value.
[time=2998] Now let me illustrate it.
[time=2999] What is this?
[time=3000] One of the kids up here.
[time=3001] Has George Clooney on it?
[time=3005] No, no, Ulysses S. Grant, how much is it?
[time=3009] $50, anybody want this?
[time=3014] I'm not talking to you adults, I'm talking to kids.
[time=3017] $50.
[time=3018] Well, you want this.
[time=3021] Okay, it's brand new, but it was.
[time=3023] Do you still want it?
[time=3024] Anybody still want it?
[time=3025] If I dropped it in the sewage runoff in the street
[time=3032] and it got run over six times, who would still want it?
[time=3034] (audience laughs) If I wore it right back here in my sweaty pocket when I'm bicycling and it's soaking wet with sweat, who would still want it?
[time=3045] 'Cause it's all been there, you still want it.
[time=3047] Why do you want it?
[time=3048] 'Cause it's worth $50.
[time=3051] It's not 40, 30, 20 or 10.
[time=3054] But it's just a piece of paper.
[time=3056] So are my notes, who'd rather have my notes?
[time=3058] (audience laughs) Thank you, there's one person out there who'd like to have my notes.
[time=3064] So they forgot to take notes, they'll take my notes.
[time=3067] This is a $50 bill, why is that a $50 bill?
[time=3071] Because you say so?
[time=3073] No?
[time=3074] It's a $50 bill because the U.S. Treasury says, this is worth $50.
[time=3080] You can redeem something with this.
[time=3083] You know what?
[time=3084] We're kind of the same way.
[time=3086] We're kind of like a piece of paper that maybe in the world's eyes, you feel like a worthless piece of paper.
[time=3092] You don't feel very valued because of the way you've been treated.
[time=3095] Let me tell you something.
[time=3097] You do not declare your value.
[time=3101] God declares your value.
[time=3102] When he sent Jesus Christ to die on the cross to redeem you from your sins, see, we're sinful.
[time=3110] We're not, we're just dirty.
[time=3112] We've been in the sewer, we've been in a sweaty pocket maybe.
[time=3115] But he sent his son Jesus to die on the cross to redeem you as his own to say, this is my child.
[time=3123] And he declares your value, not your husband, not your rebellious teenagers, not your parents, not your neighbors, not your boss.
[time=3131] God does, and when you say, I don't feel very worthwhile, that's okay if you don't feel very worthwhile, but I'm telling you something, you got your wires crossed because God says you are of a great value, not in and of yourself, but because he has declared your value.
[time=3145] Sorry, I'm not gonna give you the $50, maybe if it's 10.
[time=3149] Let me close with this story.
[time=3150] It's not about a mother or a wife, but you'll get the point.
[time=3155] There's a guy named Bill who in 1981 turned 40 years old,
[time=3161] you see Bill had his master's degree in business, he's a very successful businessman.
[time=3166] He was a collegiate athlete, he was a looker, he's a handsome man, with a wife and two wonderful children.
[time=3174] But Bill had this nagging sense of I don't feel very worthwhile, you see Bill lost his father when he was only three years old, two, three years old.
[time=3187] And you see, Bill's father, Bill Sr.
[time=3191] was one of the first men to hit the beaches of France in World War II and was killed trying to invade France
[time=3202] to push back the Nazis, and Bill had always had
[time=3208] inside himself, like some of you have a nagging sense of if my father really loved me, or if my mother loved me, or if my husband, or my wife, then I'd feel worthwhile.
[time=3221] Bill had that nagging sense of insecurity in his heart.
[time=3225] In the year he turned 40, this changed, it had nothing to do with turning 40, you see the year he turned 40, he was helping his mother move out of this little house into an apartment that would be less maintenance.
[time=3238] And they were up in the walk-in attic going through keepsakes.
[time=3243] And Bill was sitting on a chair and his mother across from each other, going through things and laughing and having a good time.
[time=3251] And finally, his mother pulled something out of a box and began to cry.
[time=3254] And she's holding a picture.
[time=3258] And it's a picture of Bill's father in a cheap tin frame
[time=3264] in dress uniform that was taken just three weeks before he died on the beaches of France that day, of the invasion.
[time=3273] And his mom said, "Bill, I think this is for you." And she reached out with shaky hands and handed it to Bill.
[time=3280] And Bill's hands started to shake, his whole body started to tremble.
[time=3284] And as he reached out to grab that, it slipped from their hands and hit the floor and crashed and the glass shattered and the cheap tin frame blew apart.
[time=3296] But out of the frame shot an envelope
[time=3302] and Bill's mother picks it up and says, "To my son, Bill, had been in that picture frame for all those years." And Bill was shaking hands started open and said, "This, to my loving son, I love you with all my heart." When I come home from the war, we're gonna play catch.
[time=3326] And I'm gonna teach you how to throw the football.
[time=3329] And we're gonna have a great time.
[time=3331] And I'm gonna watch you grow up to become a man of God.
[time=3334] Your loving father, Bill Sr.
[time=3339] You see, it was that day that Bill understood that his value was imparted to him
[time=3350] from someone who's willing to say, "I love you and you are precious to me." And if God is willing to send his son, Jesus Christ, to die for you, to die for you while you were yet his enemy to die for you, then you were bought with a great price.
[time=3366] Let's close with prayer.
[time=3367] Father, I thank you for every person that's here.
[time=3370] And Father, some have struggled in their marriage and struggle with their family.
[time=3377] And I just pray that somewhere in these verses or illustrations, there will be a fresh challenge and a fresh fire in their heart.
[time=3386] Father, help them to know it is not by our might, but by yours, by the power of your spirit.
[time=3393] Father, there are those who sit here who don't know you that maybe for the first time will say, you know, not a whole lot of things have worked in my life.
[time=3403] And maybe I need to consider Jesus Christ.
[time=3406] Maybe I need to have him be a part of my life.
[time=3410] Father, maybe there's some people here who've sat here for years.
[time=3414] I've heard stories from people who have sat here for years and they knew in their head, your son, but it never hit their heart.
[time=3422] There was never a real transformation in their heart.
[time=3426] Father, I pray for them.
[time=3428] I pray today that they would recognize that we all are sinners, we all fall short, like the piece of paper that the $50 bill is printed on.
[time=3438] We are lost without you, but you have declared a value.
[time=3443] Father, I just hope and believe they will come to the place where they will say, I'm a sinner.
[time=3449] I need somebody to redeem me.
[time=3451] I accept you Jesus Christ into my heart is my Lord and Savior.
[time=3456] And they won't just do that, but that they'll act on that and move forward and tell somebody and connect with a brother or sister in Christ and to grow in their faith.
[time=3467] I pray for every mother here, every wife here and how precious they are that you will give them strength.
[time=3474] They have to be tough and tender and do the difficult things.
