[time=0] (upbeat music) - Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service
[time=12] of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=14] Thank you for joining us.
[time=16] We trust that the music and message from God's word will help you in your Christian walk.
[time=21] Now let's join our service.
[time=22] - Now let's take a look at just a few more announcements here in the bulletin if we could.
[time=31] Can you be quiet a minute, please?
[time=33] Did you hear that?
[time=36] - Hear what?
[time=37] - Shh.
[time=38] Shh.
[time=41] - Did you hear that?
[time=47] God is speaking.
[time=54] Did you hear?
[time=56] And sometimes we let our environments and our brains get so full of other noise and activities that we drown it out.
[time=64] But in Psalm 46, God tells us, be still.
[time=70] And know that I am God.
[time=77] Wouldn't it be nice if God spoke to us like in those epic Bible movies?
[time=84] You know, Charlton Heston trudging up Mount Sinai and he gets to the top in his voice that sounds like Jane's Earl Jones on heavy reverb comes thundering from the rock and it blows his air back.
[time=95] That'd be pretty hard to miss.
[time=99] When the prophet Elijah met with opposition because of his message and he was fleeing from a wicked lady named Jezebel, he went into hiding in a cave and there he was questioning his ministry.
[time=113] He was looking for some sort of encouragement or confirmation of going on.
[time=117] And the scripture says, he looked for God in the wind.
[time=120] But God wasn't in the wind.
[time=124] And he looked for God in the earthquake but God wasn't in the earthquake.
[time=131] He looked for God in the fire, God wasn't in the fire.
[time=134] And then there came a still small voice
[time=140] that told him to go and return to his way.
[time=148] God is speaking.
[time=149] Did you hear it?
[time=151] In the big and small events of our life, in his word scripture through the promptings of the Holy Spirit, God is speaking.
[time=165] Let's be still and listen.
[time=171] [MUSIC - 271 seconds]
[time=447] I adore thee, O Lord. I adore thee. I adore thee. I adore thee. O Lord.
[time=477] O Lord, O Lord, O Lord, our heart, above all the earth. Now I may stop it for a part of our hearts. Now, O Lord, our heart, above all the earth.
[time=507] Now, O Lord, our heart is all dead for our heart. I adore thee. I adore thee. I adore thee. I adore thee.
[time=535] O Lord, I adore thee. I adore thee. I adore thee. O Lord, we have found you.
[time=562] We adore thee. We adore thee. We adore thee. O Lord, we adore thee.
[time=587] We adore thee. We adore thee.
[time=598] O Lord, let's pray. Oh Lord God, we exalt you today. Oh God, Father, I can think of a
[time=616] gillion one reasons why I love you. One reason is that I love you is because your love drives you to persevere with me.
[time=628] And I get up and I go to bed at night and I start thinking about the day and I think about the week and I go, "Oh man, how come I can't get it right?"
[time=638] And then you say, "Come on, Marsha, sit down, get out the book, my book, and get out your notebook, make metal notes, write them in your heart, and look up at me."
[time=655] Because I'm going to stick with you until you get this problem right. We'll go through it together.
[time=661] You are so neat. You are so cool. You are so great. The next song we're going to sing for you, Father, is from the ends of the earth to the depths of the sea, to the heights of the heavens.
[time=674] Your name be praised. God, the Father, who sits on the throne. Jesus, the Son, who came and died for our sins. The grave's empty, and the Holy Spirit, who empowers, enables comforts, soothes, teaches.
[time=697] In your most holy name, I pray that, O Lord Jesus, amen.
[time=710] From the ends of the earth, from the depths of the sea, from the depths of the sea, from the heights of the heavens.
[time=725] Your name be praised. From the hearts of the weak, from the hearts of the weak, from the shots of the scroll, from the lips of all people.
[time=743] You will solve me in praise, Lord. Throughout the end, let's sing. You will be found in praise, as Lord, as Lord, as Lord.
[time=761] Exalted in every nation. Sovereign of all creation, Lord, most God, we thank you for the ends of the earth, from the ends of the earth, from the depths of the sea, from the heights of the heavens.
[time=789] From the heights of the heavens, your name be praised. From the hearts of the weak, from the shots of the scroll, from the shall of the scroll, from the lips of all people.
[time=809] You will solve me in praise, Lord. Throughout the end, let's sing. You will be found in praise, as Lord, most God.
[time=828] Exalted in every nation. Sovereign of all creation, Lord, most God, we thank you for the end.
[time=845] Throughout the end, let's sing. You will be found in praise, as Lord, most God.
[time=858] Exalted in every nation. Sovereign of all creation, Lord, most God, we thank you for the end.
[time=874] We thank you for the end. We thank you for the end.
[time=891] You have been given the name of all names, and we worship you. Yes, we worship you.
[time=928] Yes, we worship you. We are people. We are people.
[time=943] Make for your glory, and we worship you. Yes, we worship you.
[time=956] We are people. Make for your glory, and we worship you.
[time=973] Yes, we worship you. Every day, just sing it out now, celebration.
[time=982] You have redeemed us from every nation, and we worship you.
[time=994] Yes, we worship you. You have redeemed us from every nation, and we worship you.
[time=1016] Yes, we worship you. Yes, we worship you.
[time=1033] Yes, we worship you.
[time=1051] Well let's jump back in here to our series on the family, Families Under Construction.
[time=1058] And this morning we talk about the heart of the family, and over the last several weeks we've done our very best, and I hope you've been encouraged.
[time=1065] We've done our very best to revisit and remind all of us of the fundamental truths and principles that represent God's design for the family.
[time=1073] Your family and mine need to be constantly reminded of how it is he intended our families to function, and whether you're single or married, young or old with kids or without
[time=1084] every one of us should benefit from a study such as this.
[time=1089] Each and every day in countless ways we have the opportunity to make life-shaping eternity
[time=1095] altering investments into the families we live in and around.
[time=1100] Dads, husbands, men, moms, wives, women, children of all ages, we have seen over the last several
[time=1108] weeks that each of us has a vital and strategic role to play in the design that God has given
[time=1114] the family, and as I thought recently about fall approaching, and as we consider what's
[time=1121] ahead in this new year of school and ministry, there are new opportunities for you and your
[time=1127] family looming on the horizon of your home.
[time=1130] Think about it, new jobs will start for many.
[time=1134] Some will now be driving, others will now be praying.
[time=1139] A half day will now be a full day for some, some will go to new schools, others will work
[time=1145] in new ministries, homework will begin to dominate most evenings, football is ready to roll, soon there will be piles of leaves and sweaters, jackets and gloves will find
[time=1156] their way to the hall closet, and so with all of that coming, I wanted to take this morning, we wanted to take this morning and ask you, ask each of us here, a very, very
[time=1167] important question, and I mean that, I hope this morning in these next 30 or 40 minutes
[time=1174] or so, you would be willing to ask yourself some very honest, very personal, very, very
[time=1180] important questions, and here's the reasoning behind the question, you find it in the book
[time=1188] of 1 Samuel, 1 Samuel 16, 1 Samuel 16, it's a very important question we want to ask
[time=1200] this morning, and it has to do with your heart, look what it says, 1 Samuel 16 verse 6 says
[time=1207] then it came about when they entered that he looked at Eliaab and thought surely the
[time=1213] Lord's anointed is before him, but the Lord said to Samuel do not look at his what, at
[time=1222] his what, at his appearance, where he wears his hair, clothes that he has on, look on
[time=1233] his face, the way he carries himself, no, God says don't look at his appearance Samuel,
[time=1243] do not look at his appearance or at the height of his stature because I have rejected him,
[time=1249] for God sees not as man sees, for man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the what, at the heart.
[time=1259] Our Lord has great concern for and interest in the condition this morning of your heart,
[time=1267] so do I especially as it relates to families, especially as it relates to families and God's
[time=1276] design for the family, dads, moms, kids of all ages, there's a great concern that I have
[time=1283] and I carry with me daily for the condition of your heart, especially as it relates to
[time=1289] the family because the fact of the matter is I see on a daily basis and I come in contact
[time=1295] with on a regular occurrence heart-breaking, tragic, life-altering, absolutely discouraging
[time=1306] stuff as it relates to moms and dads and kids and you know what, in all that I've encountered
[time=1314] and in all that I've faced, never once have I sat with a failing father who wasn't getting the job done, not sacrificially loving and leading, not making the investment that God
[time=1325] called him to make, never once have I sat with a failing father whose heart was full
[time=1333] and strong and vibrant, never once, never once have I sat with a struggling mom trying
[time=1340] her best to make an investment in those that God has given her to make an investment in, never once have I sat with a wife, struggling and failing miserably in her effort to follow God's design as she comes alongside the man she's married to, never once have I sat with one in that condition whose heart was large and beating and vibrant and full of life and
[time=1362] right and connected with God, never once have I sat with a disobedient, disrespectful or
[time=1369] dishonoring child regardless of the age and sensed in them a heart that was full of life
[time=1378] and energy, love for God, never once.
[time=1386] You may come into this place each week with a smile on your face, you may be quick to shake a hand, you may be involved in a ministry, you may even serve in leadership, you may be a student, a man or a woman, a son, a daughter, a mom or dad and you may appear, you may
[time=1401] appear to those around you to be normal, healthy and happy but first Samuel 16, 7 says, God's
[time=1410] concern is for the condition of your heart and so this morning we ask the question, how's your heart?
[time=1416] Psalm 2214, Psalm 2214 says, "I am poured out like water, I am poured out like water
[time=1426] and all my bones are out of joint, my heart is like wax, it is melted within me."
[time=1434] That describe your heart this morning, maybe these words are descriptive in some way of how your heart feels today, maybe it feels empty, poured out, dried up.
[time=1444] Mark 7, Mark 7 verse 20, it says and he was saying that which proceeds out of the man,
[time=1452] that is what defiles the man and in 21 he says for from within out of the heart of men
[time=1460] proceed the evil thoughts, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries, deeds of coveting wickedness
[time=1466] as well as deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride and foolishness, all these evil things
[time=1474] proceed from within and defile the man.
[time=1479] Isaiah, Isaiah 1,5, how's your heart this morning?
[time=1488] Isaiah 1,5 says, "Where will you be stricken again as you continue in your rebellion?
[time=1495] The whole head is sick and the whole heart is faint." Psalm 51, Psalm 51 verse 10, read it there, it says this, "created me a clean heart, oh
[time=1508] God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me." And then in verse 12 it says, "Restore to me the joy of thy salvation and sustain me with a willing spirit." Quite possibly this morning that's the condition of your heart, maybe this morning your heart is poured out, maybe your heart is empty, maybe your heart is shrinking, maybe you sense as you consider it this morning that your heart's in trouble, possibly though your heart's on fire.
[time=1535] Maybe this morning your heart is full, either way it's a good thing that you and I would
[time=1541] take time this morning to consider the condition of our hearts.
[time=1546] God's word in the Lord Himself placed a great deal of importance on the condition of our hearts and so with His help, with His help, and that's important, I want to say that to you.
[time=1556] Jeremiah 17 says that our heart is deceitfully, deceitfully wicked.
[time=1567] Who can understand it?
[time=1571] And so I want to ask you this morning, would you be willing to, like the psalmist did, in Psalm 139, 23, and 24, would you be willing, are you?
[time=1583] Even now as I speak, are you willing this morning?
[time=1587] Young people, kids, 8-year-olds, 9-year-olds, 10-year-olds, students, moms, dads, older
[time=1595] adults, every one of you in this room this morning, would you be willing for the next few minutes to say, like the psalmist said, "Oh God, search me.
[time=1603] Search me, O God, and know my heart, try me and know my anxious thoughts, and see if there be any hurtful way in me." And having done that, God, would you leave me in the everlasting way?
[time=1618] Will you do that this morning?
[time=1620] Would you honestly consider the state of your heart?
[time=1623] There's a lot at stake, there's a lot at stake, and so I hope is that you would be willing to honestly and sincerely before him and no one else respond.
[time=1633] As we talk this through, would you be willing to respond humbly and honestly and personally
[time=1639] as he exposes the condition of your heart, as he reminds you, as he convicts you?
[time=1646] Let me pray for us and then we're going to do that.
[time=1650] Father, we come before you this morning as a people, at least I hope we do, a people
[time=1657] willing to allow your searching eye and gaze to come across our hearts.
[time=1664] God, we realize that there is so much at stake, our hearts and the condition of our hearts.
[time=1671] God, the health of our hearts.
[time=1675] Our hearts touch so many things, so many people, so much of us, as it said there in Mark, so
[time=1682] much of what comes out of us in word or deed has to do with the condition of our heart.
[time=1690] And so God, this morning, as a family, as families, as individuals and as a corporate
[time=1696] family here at Blackhawk, we desire to open our hearts to you.
[time=1700] And so God, as we do that, we pray that you would move in and through, reminding us and convicting us and exposing things that need to be exposed in your son's name, we pray.
[time=1710] [AMEN] Well, I'm going to ask you five questions in the next 20 minutes or so, five questions.
[time=1717] We're going to kind of work our way through this, try not to go too fast, I want to get it all in, so stay with me.
[time=1723] Five questions for you this morning, okay?
[time=1725] And I'm going to ask you, go ahead and get your pens out, get a pencil, get something to write with, because I want you to grade yourself.
[time=1731] I want you to think through as we talk about the heart.
[time=1734] And I want you to think about you and your heart, and as I ask these questions, I want to give you a chance to respond, as you and I examine with God's help, the condition of
[time=1745] our heart.
[time=1747] I'm going to grade yourself and I'll ask you to grade yourself on a scale of one to five.
[time=1751] One meaning your heart's barely breathing in regards to this question, five being you're
[time=1758] a coronary wonder.
[time=1759] I mean, your heart's as full and big and healthy as it could possibly be.
[time=1764] Question number one for you, as we consider our hearts this morning.
[time=1769] And it's represented over here on this easel.
[time=1772] Question number one, does your heart feel deeply?
[time=1779] Write it down.
[time=1781] Does your heart feel deeply?
[time=1787] Or is your heart more prone to the whole flat line thing?
[time=1794] Do you feel things?
[time=1796] Is there a sense of life and vitality and emotion in your heart these days?
[time=1802] Do you, does your heart feel deeply?
[time=1806] Or is your heart resigned to a flat line approach to life?
[time=1810] I tell you, you look at Psalm 42 and you can do that if you'd like.
[time=1818] Look at Psalm 40, we can look at a lot of Psalms.
[time=1821] I picked out a couple, Psalm 42, and you can read this along with me or you can just listen as I read.
[time=1827] But with that question in mind, does your heart feel deeply?
[time=1830] Listen to the heart of David, Psalm 42, as the deer pants, as the deer pants or longs
[time=1841] is what that word means in the Hebrew, as the deer longs for the water brooks.
[time=1845] So my soul pants craves for thee, oh God.
[time=1850] My soul thirsts for God, for the living God.
[time=1854] When shall I come and appear before God?
[time=1857] My tears have been my food day and night, verse 4, I pour out my soul to thee.
[time=1865] You go over to 63, oh God thou art my God, I shall seek thee earnestly.
[time=1871] My soul thirsts for thee, my flesh yearns for thee.
[time=1877] Psalm 63 1, Psalm 63 3, because thy loving kindness is better than life, my lips will
[time=1884] praise thee, so I will bless thee as long as I live.
[time=1887] I will lift up my hands and thy name.
[time=1890] My soul is satisfied as with marrow and fatness, and my mouth offers praises with joyful lips.
[time=1897] And not only are we to feel deeply towards him, we're to feel deeply towards each other.
[time=1902] 1 Peter 1 says, "Since you have an obedience to the truth purified your souls for a sincere
[time=1909] love of the brethren fervently, passionately," it says there in 1 Peter Love, one another
[time=1916] from the heart.
[time=1918] Our love for him and our love for each other is to be great, it's to be fervent, passionate.
[time=1923] If you just track David alone through the book of Psalms, he sings, he shouts, he dances,
[time=1929] he weeps, he laughs, he groans, he yells, he claps, he wails.
[time=1936] How about you?
[time=1938] How about you these days, and you know, you know your hearts in trouble when you begin to grind your way through life with little or no emotion?
[time=1947] Some even tragically so pride themselves on their tight-lept, unemotional existence.
[time=1955] You know somebody like that?
[time=1958] It's a sad thing.
[time=1961] You see, for they've forgotten that we have been made in the image of who?
[time=1965] Who?
[time=1966] God.
[time=1968] And God is an emotional among other things.
[time=1972] Our God is an emotional, visceral feeling God.
[time=1977] How's your heart?
[time=1980] How's your heart this morning?
[time=1981] Does it feel deeply?
[time=1986] Grate yourself.
[time=1987] One to five.
[time=1989] Does it feel deeply?
[time=1992] And remember this as a side note, hearts that don't, flat-line hearts, people walking around
[time=2003] with stiff-lept, unemotional appearances, people grinding their way through life, feeling
[time=2010] little.
[time=2011] If your heart doesn't feel deeply, if as I'm talking you're writing down a one or a two.
[time=2016] Just remember, and I have to remember this very same thing.
[time=2019] How does a heart get like that?
[time=2022] How does a heart get unemotional?
[time=2024] How is it that a heart gets to not feeling deeply?
[time=2027] Well, that's a long answer, but I'll tell you, a couple, two, three things that come to mind.
[time=2036] Unresolved bitterness.
[time=2041] A heart that hasn't forgiven and deep-seated resentment.
[time=2049] You hold on to those things.
[time=2051] You chew on that stuff.
[time=2053] You let those things settle in any heart for any period of time, and you'll begin to see
[time=2060] a very flat-lined, unhealthy heart.
[time=2065] Number two, signified by the clock right here.
[time=2070] Number two, does your heart recognize special moments?
[time=2079] We were like I told you this week at a camp, and it was great all day long.
[time=2088] There was one of the people that worked at the camp, had a boy 11 years old and so my son and he hooked up the very first day.
[time=2095] Really nice kid, great family, and they just had a blast.
[time=2098] And I didn't see my son most of the week, I mean I'd see him at meals, he'd let me know what he was doing, but he was just having such a good time.
[time=2105] And two, three, four days go by, and one night, I spoke every night at 10, 30, was when they
[time=2112] had me on to speak.
[time=2113] It's a bunch of college and high school kids, do you remember what it was like?
[time=2118] And he would stay up with me, he'd meet me at that fireside that this huge outdoor arena.
[time=2122] So anyway one night, we're heading back to our cabin from the talk that night.
[time=2129] And I know my son, I know my son, and he had a look in his eye, and we hadn't been together
[time=2135] for about four days, I mean we'd been together but not like together, and we're walking back to the cabin and we're going by the game room, and he looks at me and we're in the light, and he says, "Hey Dad, could we play some ping pong?"
[time=2152] And maybe you've seen this before, I know I have, there's a look in the eye, and there's an expression on the face, there's a countenance that says what he's asking for is a whole
[time=2163] lot more than a game of ping pong, maybe you've seen that.
[time=2170] The problem is, I've seen it so many times, you've seen it, I would guess many times,
[time=2177] and not respond it appropriately.
[time=2180] Luckily for me that night, last week we went and played ping pong, and for the next half hour we hit a ping pong ball, and you know what, he just wanted to tell me about his
[time=2190] week, he wanted to tell me about his new friend, he wanted to tell me about some things he'd seen he wasn't quite sure of, wanted to ask me some questions about some stuff he'd heard me say, "Hey Dad, could we play a little ping pong?"
[time=2207] And the sad and tragic truth is, people, that this thing right here, and what it represents,
[time=2214] it's killing us, it's killing you and it's killing me.
[time=2221] In the midst of a world run by day timers and things to do and palm pilots too many times,
[time=2227] were taxed, overworked, over stressed hearts, fail to seize the moments.
[time=2236] They fail to seize the moments that life brings, the son or daughter seems discouraged or down
[time=2242] and you tuck them in with no questions, with no attempt to investigate and instead hurry out to the couch to unwind.
[time=2253] Your spouse hints at the need for some alone time, just the two of you, and yet you continue to pack the calendar week after week after week.
[time=2264] I was reading in John 3 a little bit ago and I was wondering what was Jesus doing, says in John 3 that Nicodemus came to him at what?
[time=2272] Say it again, at night, Nicodemus says came to Jesus at night and he had a lot of questions,
[time=2282] one very important one.
[time=2284] How is it for you?
[time=2286] A friend asks a question, a family need arises, there's a co-worker reaching out for help and involvement at the office and too many times our hearts are set on skim.
[time=2297] What I mean by skim is this, I heard it explained recently and I thought it was very appropriate and true.
[time=2303] What does it mean to have your heart set on skim?
[time=2305] Well, it's when just slowly and aimlessly you and your heart, me and mind, are skimming
[time=2311] across the top of life, never stopping to take a sacrificial, careful, interested, loving
[time=2320] look beneath the surface of our own lives and others.
[time=2323] How sensitive is your heart these days to the moments that life presents?
[time=2329] Jesus was a great example of a man who walked through life with an enormous agenda, but
[time=2335] sensitive again and again to the moments that were presented.
[time=2340] Grate yourself, one to five, number three, does your heart allow room for spontaneity?
[time=2347] Does your heart allow room for spontaneity?
[time=2351] Just briefly, I think this is important, I really do and if you know me you understand why, I think it's important.
[time=2357] What kind of spirit question for you?
[time=2359] What kind of spirit do you walk around with these days?
[time=2362] What's the posture of your heart?
[time=2364] What's the countenance of your life?
[time=2369] Is there at least some semblance of joy?
[time=2373] Is there at least some glimmer of hope?
[time=2376] Is there at least some maybe even small spark of enthusiasm about your day and your life
[time=2384] and your existence or for you, is it just obligation?
[time=2390] Is it just duty?
[time=2392] Is it just routine, burden, getting it all done?
[time=2399] Is your heart alive or is it just surviving?
[time=2405] How is it for you these days?
[time=2407] Here's the last time you accepted a spontaneous, unscheduled invitation to go to breakfast
[time=2414] coffee or dessert with a friend.
[time=2417] Do you sense any freedom, any at all, to enjoy?
[time=2425] Or are you held captive by plans, pressure, and pessimism?
[time=2432] You know people like that?
[time=2435] I do.
[time=2436] I know folks like that.
[time=2437] I call them E-Ors.
[time=2441] You know any E-Ors?
[time=2442] Yeah, I'm showing my, I'm showing my stage of life here.
[time=2445] I've read way too Winnie the Pooh.
[time=2446] Way too many Winnie the Pooh books watch way too many Winnie the Pooh movies.
[time=2450] But I know people like that.
[time=2452] Hey, how's it going?
[time=2453] Well, fine I guess.
[time=2459] Fine I guess.
[time=2460] Nobody takes life as seriously as I do.
[time=2464] I can't complain but I'd like to.
[time=2469] Too much to do, too little time.
[time=2473] Guess I'll just keep trudging.
[time=2477] You know people like that?
[time=2479] I'm not like that.
[time=2481] I drive E-Ors people crazy because I've always got time to go have fun.
[time=2486] We'll get it all done later.
[time=2493] You know what?
[time=2494] Every once in a while you just, you just got to break loose.
[time=2497] You know you just got to have some fun.
[time=2500] You just got to take your towel and take your beach chair.
[time=2503] You know what I'm saying?
[time=2505] And right now there's people going oh my goodness he's throwing beach balls in the church.
[time=2510] You just got to let her rip.
[time=2512] Thanks very much.
[time=2515] It's so good to hear you laugh.
[time=2518] I'm seeing people laugh.
[time=2519] I haven't seen, whoa.
[time=2524] If you're watching on the Bible Hour that camera just shook.
[time=2528] I've started something horrendous here, Judy I'm sorry.
[time=2534] But every once in a while it's just good to laugh.
[time=2539] It's just good to let go.
[time=2542] Those little hearts and they're closed off to a good laugh and a sense of joy and freedom.
[time=2552] It's not a good thing.
[time=2557] Grade yourself, one to five.
[time=2560] Does your heart allow room for spontaneity?
[time=2564] Number four.
[time=2565] Number four, does your heart feel compassion?
[time=2568] Serious stuff here now.
[time=2570] Does your heart these days feel compassion for the lost and hurting?
[time=2578] How's the compassion gauge read in your life these days?
[time=2584] Is the door in other words?
[time=2586] Is the door of your heart as it relates and pertains to lost and hurting people?
[time=2591] Is the door of your heart open or is it shut?
[time=2599] Second Matthew 23, go ahead I want you to flip back there and take a look.
[time=2603] New Testament first book, Matthew chapter 23.
[time=2623] You know as always we want to look to the, we want to look to our Lord and we want to
[time=2629] look to the example that He leaves us as we ask any question of ourselves and here we get a powerful reminder, Matthew 23 verses 37 and 38.
[time=2641] His time as you just step back for a moment and look at the story of His life and words all heading here.
[time=2647] His time is winding down and He begins to communicate here in chapter 23 some things from
[time=2654] His heart and He gets down to verse 37 and look at what He says.
[time=2658] He says oh Jerusalem, Jerusalem.
[time=2664] And as you read that you might just say well okay oh Jerusalem, oh Jerusalem.
[time=2669] But understand again in the text, in the Greek, in the way that this thing is structured,
[time=2676] in the way that it got written, in the way that it got communicated.
[time=2681] There isn't any more powerful heart wrenching, emotion exposing way of saying something
[time=2689] than to have it phrased this way.
[time=2692] Understand that as He says these words He is showing us a heart that has been broken.
[time=2699] He is, He is communicating as best He can of the deep feelings He has for a nation that has and is about to reject Him.
[time=2707] And He says oh Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent
[time=2714] to her.
[time=2715] How often I wanted to gather your children together the way a hen gathers her chicks under
[time=2721] her wings and you were unwilling.
[time=2725] Verse 38, "Behold your house is being left to you desolate."
[time=2734] He felt deeply.
[time=2737] There was a compassion there like none other, for the hearts and souls of a people that
[time=2743] He had tried His best to throw His arms around.
[time=2746] Does your heart break?
[time=2747] Now I'm going to ask you, does your heart break?
[time=2751] Do you weep for?
[time=2752] Does your soul ache for those far from God?
[time=2755] Is there a passionate desire to see hurting people loved?
[time=2757] The wounded made whole, the broken hearted healed or has your faith and perspective grown
[time=2763] cold and routine, leaving the compassion and evangelistic doors of your life closed?
[time=2781] Just shut.
[time=2784] Just live in your life, just do in your thing.
[time=2787] Good to see you.
[time=2788] Thanks for coming.
[time=2789] Hey, how are you?
[time=2792] What's the condition of your heart this morning as it relates to the hurting and the lost?
[time=2798] Is it open, is it sensitive?
[time=2802] And if it's not, again, please, at least remind yourself this morning of how it is that hearts get that way.
[time=2808] How is it that hearts get shut?
[time=2810] How is it that the answer to my question is, "No, Kelly, I don't weep for the lost.
[time=2814] No, my soul doesn't break for the hurting.
[time=2817] No, no, no." Well, the answer or the thing to remember there is this, your heart breaks for something.
[time=2826] You are connected to, you are excited about, you care deeply for, you are given in your life and in your affections and in your time, you are given to something.
[time=2838] Something has your attention.
[time=2839] Something is the object of your affection.
[time=2843] And when it's not the gospel and when it's not the kingdom and when it's not the person of Christ and that which He's placed you here to do, it's something else.
[time=2852] And that's a dangerous way to live.
[time=2856] And when it's something else, then the door of your heart gets shut and you can walk right by them.
[time=2862] They can stare you right in the eyes and nothing happens in your heart.
[time=2872] Raise yourself, one to five, does your heart feel compassion for the lost and hurting?
[time=2879] And lastly, when the folks are going to come back up and just sing one more song, we're going to go, does your heart hear the prompting of God?
[time=2888] Last question, does your heart hear the prompting of God or does He need with you?
[time=2901] One of these, God whispers and a healthy heart hears.
[time=2914] How is your heart this morning as it relates to the prompting of God when He whispers, when
[time=2922] He nudges, when He prompts, when He goes, do you hear?
[time=2932] Or is your heart in a place today where you need the megaphone in your ear, God picking up the spiritual two by four and whacking you across the head, going, listen.
[time=2942] And see, the tragic thing is that by that time you know and I know because we've been whacked on the head too many times when it gets to that point so many times it's too late, so many times when it gets to that point bad decisions have been made.
[time=2958] How is your heart this morning as it relates to God's promptings?
[time=2968] Psalm 27, and we'll close, Psalm 27, 13 and 14, write it down.
[time=2977] Write it down.
[time=2978] Psalm 7, 13 and 14, and here's what it says, look at me, here's what it says, it says
[time=2984] I would have despaired, I would have despaired, had I not been willing, I'm paraphrasing,
[time=2992] had I not been willing, I would have despaired, I never would have seen the land of the living, he says, had I not been willing to wait on the Lord?
[time=3003] If you've walked with the Lord for any amount of time, if you've lived life in relationship
[time=3009] with God for any amount of time you know that oftentimes listening to God requires what?
[time=3018] Waiting.
[time=3020] And so as you listen and as you wait is your heart in a place today whereby you can hear
[time=3026] and not just hear but respond to the promptings of God, grade yourself, grade yourself one
[time=3034] to five and let me read this to you, praise team come on back up, Ezekiel, Ezekiel 18.
[time=3047] Look at your seat there, how'd you grade out, high teens, 20s, good shape, low teens, single
[time=3057] digits, you may need to hear the words of Ezekiel, says in chapter 18 verse 30, it says
[time=3069] therefore I will judge you O house of Israel each according to his conduct, declares the Lord God repent, low score, heart's not in good shape, there's a good bet there's some
[time=3080] sin involved, there's a good bet there's some things happening in here that need to change.
[time=3085] He says each according to his conduct declares the Lord God repent and turn away from your transgressions so that iniquity may not become a stumbling block to you cast away from you
[time=3096] all your transgressions which you have committed and make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit for why will you die O house of Israel for I have no pleasure in the death of anyone
[time=3109] who dies declares the Lord God therefore repent and live.
[time=3114] That's my hope for you this morning all of us would as we've opened our hearts to him that there would be a willingness to repent from those things that leave our hearts unhealthy
[time=3125] and would hope that in the hours and days to come that you would give yourself to maybe
[time=3132] even a more extended look at your heart and things that need to change things you need to address stuff that needs to get talked about our hope is that you will and we'd love to help you if we can we're going to sing and then we're going to go.
[time=3167] I can never return I've closed the door I will walk the path I run the race and I will
[time=3185] never be the same again I can never return I've closed the door I will walk the path I
[time=3205] run the race and I will never be the same again oh my God so quite great Lord my waters
