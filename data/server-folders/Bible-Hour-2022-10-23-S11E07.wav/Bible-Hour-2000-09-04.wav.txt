[time=0] (upbeat music) - Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service
[time=12] of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=14] Thank you for joining us.
[time=15] We trust that the music and message from God's word will help you in your Christian walk.
[time=20] Now let's join our service.
[time=22] [MUSIC - 29 seconds]
[time=58] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 162 seconds]
[time=226] (audience applauding)
[time=238] - The first time I heard this song "Leave a Light on" by Greg Ferguson, I can't remember, it might have been a CLC, a church leaders conference, it might have been a leadership summit, but it was about two years ago, and it really set me back.
[time=253] I mean, it really took me back.
[time=255] I, on the one hand, I, it made me so sad in a sense, 'cause I had never been a part of a church, or never been around a lot of people who had that kind of sensitivity to the heart of a seeker, never.
[time=272] And so, it made me long for all that I had never experienced, and on the other side of my emotions that day, I was so absolutely elated, because in the way God had been moving in my own life, I was now finally a part of a place, and around a group of people, that so desperately wanted to have that kind of sensitivity.
[time=293] And I was a part of a church, finally, that was trying its best to leave lights on in ways that mattered.
[time=300] And so, it was a great day for me, and that was the first time I heard this song, and now I've heard the song 500 times since.
[time=308] And when we hear the song, and when you see this video that you're about to see, I want you to understand that it's on the heart of the leadership of this church, and the people in this place.
[time=319] We are trying to be a church that leaves a light on, and what I mean by that is this, we realize every day people drive by this place, and every day people are looking in.
[time=330] They bump into the building, they bump into the church when they bump into us at the ball fields, they bump into this place, when they bump into you and I at the grocery store, or in the neighborhood.
[time=341] And we want so badly for the message that they sense, the message that they feel, the message that they hear from us, when they bump into us, or when they look in from the street, we want it to be a message that says, come on in, there's a place for you here, that's a safe place to hear a life-changing and dangerous message, but come on in, bring your baggage, bring your questions, bring your skepticism, bring your confusion, all your pain, all your guilt, bring it all.
[time=369] Because it's a place full of people that haven't forgotten what it's like to wrestle with those very things.
[time=375] A place full of people that hasn't forgotten what it's like to wrestle with that guilt, that pain, and that confusion.
[time=382] And so we want folks to realize a light is on, and we mean to shine the light, as the song says.
[time=389] We mean to shine the light.
[time=391] Our light is not an attempt to keep out the night.
[time=394] No, we want folks to come and feel at home.
[time=397] Jesus said in Matthew 11, he said,
[time=403] come to me, all of you, who are weary and heavy laden, and you will find rest for your souls.
[time=412] And that's the message of this song, and that's the message of this church, and that is the message that we want to communicate as we leave a light on for seeking people.
[time=423] I hope you enjoy this, whether you're seeking yourself, and you haven't quite come to the point where you feel like you've figured this faith thing out, or whether you call Black Hawk home, either way, we want this song to be a reminder of you, of the kind of message and the kind of people that we're trying to be as we help seekers find and follow Christ.

[time=726] - So have you ever set in a car staring out the window
[time=736] wondering how it got so confusing?
[time=738] Have you liked the wife, like the woman in the video?
[time=744] Have you ever felt the ache in your heart?
[time=746] The emptiness deep inside as life and the pain of relationship slowly removed hope for you?
[time=753] Have you sensed in the midst of the emptiness your heart searching for something or someone that will satisfy?
[time=761] One of the main questions, we're gonna ask a lot of them this morning, but one of the main questions about our time that together this morning is this has your soul ever been thirsty?
[time=773] Has your soul ever been thirsty?
[time=777] Kids in the room this morning, what do I mean by that?
[time=781] Kids, what I mean by that is this, have you ever been so sad?
[time=784] Have you ever been so sad that your heart hurt?
[time=788] Have you ever seen something happen?
[time=791] Have you ever heard somebody say something?
[time=793] Kids says, have you ever watched things take place that kind of makes your heart hurt deep down inside?
[time=801] If the answer to any of these questions, kids or adults is yes.
[time=808] Then this morning I want you to meet a woman whose answer to all the above would be yes as well.
[time=813] She would say to you, I felt the ache.
[time=815] She would say to you clearly and powerfully, I sensed the emptiness, my heart was scarred, my heart was searching, my soul was thirsty.
[time=826] Let me ask you another question or two, have you ever determined yourself too tired or too busy to help?
[time=834] Have you ever determined yourself too tired or too busy to come alongside another?
[time=839] Have you ever had the means to easily meet a need but instead chose not to, allowing the identity of the one in need to squelch your giving spirit?
[time=850] What was it for you?
[time=852] What was it about them?
[time=853] What was it about the circumstance that squelched that giving spirit?
[time=858] Maybe they were too young.
[time=864] Maybe they were too difficult to deal with.
[time=867] And so you look the other way.
[time=869] Possibly it was their appearance, their ethnicity or social status that kept you from offering that which you had to give and could have given easily.
[time=877] Had you so chosen.
[time=878] Have you ever just grown weary of pursuing and giving and just decided to stop?
[time=885] Not gonna give anymore.
[time=887] Not gonna come alongside anymore, I'm done, I'm tired.
[time=891] No more from me.
[time=894] If you answered yes to any of those questions, I want you to meet someone this morning whose answer to all the above would be no.
[time=900] No, he would say, I've been tired and stretched, come face to face with the antagonistic, unlovely and diseased, I've been ridiculed and reviled, but have been unable to keep what I have to myself.
[time=912] With so much in my possession, he would say to you and to me this morning and he will.
[time=918] With so much in my possession, with so much at stake, I can't be silent.
[time=925] I've got to give, I've got to offer.
[time=928] This morning we'll find both of these individuals, a man and a woman in our study of God's word.
[time=933] The woman is a Samaritan woman.
[time=937] The woman is a Samaritan woman who is about to come face to face with a life-changing, eternity-altering message.
[time=944] The man is Jesus himself who's love for mankind and his desire to see them find him knew absolutely no boundaries, no exceptions.
[time=958] Wide open to everyone, as love for mankind knew no boundaries.
[time=964] Open your Bibles this morning to John chapter four.
[time=967] Open up to John chapter four, Matthew, Mark, Luke,
[time=973] and John, the first four books there in your New Testament, just before you get to the book of Acts.
[time=980] John chapter four in a passage that has the capacity.
[time=984] All right?
[time=985] And I hope you sense this.
[time=987] I hope you see this as we make our way through it, but I want to tell you before we get going, it has the capacity, this passage, and our time together this morning has the capacity to reach deep into the heart of one's searching.
[time=1000] And maybe that's you this morning.
[time=1002] Maybe you're here for the first time.
[time=1007] Maybe you've been coming for months, but you haven't gotten home yet.
[time=1011] You haven't crossed over that line of faith.
[time=1014] Haven't entered into that personal relationship with a living loving God.
[time=1018] No, you're here this morning and you're still seeking.
[time=1020] You're still searching.
[time=1021] This passage has the capacity to reach deep into your searching heart and encourage you and give you answers and point you in meaningful directions.
[time=1032] At the same time, this passage has the opportunity and the capacity to challenge the mindset of the already convinced.
[time=1042] And many of you I know are already convinced of the gospel, already having given your life to him.
[time=1047] This passage has the chance to get you and I to think through things in a fresh and new way again when it comes to what we're doing with that faith.
[time=1056] John chapter four, you there?
[time=1061] Gonna start reading, let me just read with you through the first four verses.
[time=1064] It says when therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John, although Jesus himself was not baptizing, but his disciples were.
[time=1075] Verse three, he left Judea and departed again into Galilee.
[time=1080] Here you go, verse four.
[time=1082] And he had to pass through Samaria.
[time=1087] Stop right there.
[time=1088] So here we find our Lord and he's on his way with his disciples as the text says.
[time=1095] He's on his way, he's leaving Judea, he's going into Galilee and it says there in verse four, he had to pass through Samaria.
[time=1103] Interesting phrase as you would study that phrase as I did the last several weeks and you look at that phrase and you see what men and authors and commentators have written about that phrase.
[time=1114] There's a very small percentage of them and I would not be one of them this morning.
[time=1119] We're gonna get to what I believe it says to us, but there are some who might indicate that this had to pass through, it had to do with the fact that it might have been a shorter distance, that it might have been more expedient, that it possibly could have saved time, a more direct route, if you will.
[time=1136] Yet most scholars and commentators offer a different take, different take, their take is, oh, he had to.
[time=1143] Oh yes, he definitely had to, but it wasn't about a shorter distance, it wasn't about expedience.
[time=1151] No, they would say that Jesus, being who he was and being like he was, always, and as you've studied him and as you've gotten to know him, you know he was always sensitive to and very willing to follow the leading of the father.
[time=1167] Always submissive to, always yielding himself to, wherever the father might lead.
[time=1175] So Jesus, always sensitive, always following, always going where the father would take him, realizes he has a divine appointment.
[time=1184] He has a divine appointment that he wasn't about to miss
[time=1190] and so he had to pass through Samaria.
[time=1194] He realized where the father was leading, it wasn't about expedience, it was about this appointment that God had for him.
[time=1201] Now I'm gonna ask you a lot of questions this morning, but we're gonna kind of pull several of those out and make them kind of like big questions, main point questions, questions that you could give some thought to, questions that I hope you'll consider, not just in our time together this morning, but as you have lunch today with your family, as you eat with your friends, as you talk with people and fellowship through the week, important questions that you need to ask yourself, that I need to ask myself all over again and here's your first one for the morning, all right?
[time=1229] Write it down.
[time=1230] Question number one today, have you missed any divine appointments lately in your commitment to expedience, in your commitment to your agenda, in your commitment to your day planner, in your commitment to all that you've gotta do and all that you have to accomplish in a given day?
[time=1248] I wonder, have you missed any divine appointments lately?
[time=1253] The real question is this, the real question is are you walking closely enough to him?
[time=1264] In the day to day of your life and all that you face and encounter, are you walking closely enough with him, spending the kind of time you need to spend with him, having the kind of conversations that you need to have with him, sharing the things in confession, in praise and worship, are you spending the kind of time walking closely enough with him these days
[time=1292] that you would hear and sense his direction, leading and guiding you to divine appointments?
[time=1300] I think it happens all the time.
[time=1302] I believe in my heart and I would hope many of you would as well.
[time=1306] I believe that there are those he wants you to bump into.
[time=1309] You ever sense that?
[time=1313] I believe that there are those he wants you to talk to or cross paths with.
[time=1317] Question is, are you listening and are you willing to alter your path for an opportunity to share life giving truth with one in need?
[time=1327] Have you missed any divine appointments lately?
[time=1331] Felt a spiritual nudge saying wait.
[time=1335] Felt a spiritual prompting from God saying go over there, do that or stop.
[time=1342] But ignore it.
[time=1345] 'Cause there were things to do, places to go, people to see, things to cross off the list.
[time=1352] Let's keep going.
[time=1355] Verse five.
[time=1356] So he came to a city.
[time=1357] So he came to a city of Samaria called sickar near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
[time=1365] Verse six and Jacob's well was there.
[time=1368] Jesus therefore being weary from his journey was sitting thus by the well.
[time=1372] It was about the sixth hour, which would have been in Roman time about 6 p.m.
[time=1377] Now a little side note on the Samaritans and the Jews before we jump into this thing, okay.
[time=1382] Briefly, understand, or be reminded this morning many of you may have known this.
[time=1387] For some this morning it may be new news.
[time=1389] The Samaritans and the Jews did not, did not get along.
[time=1394] This is what we would call a bitter rivalry.
[time=1397] I mean, this is big time.
[time=1398] This is, we don't like you, you don't like us.
[time=1401] You keep your distance.
[time=1403] What had happened was that the Samaritans were a group of people, Jewish folks, who had been taken captive in the northern kingdom by the Assyrians.
[time=1412] And in the being taken captive they had made decisions and choices then to intermingle and intermarry and basically had created a whole new race.
[time=1422] And so they were viewed by the pure and refined Jews.
[time=1427] They were viewed as a bunch of half breeds that had certainly dishonored God.
[time=1434] And so there was this hatred between the Jews and the Samaritans, quite a rivalry, a heated deal.
[time=1440] And so it says there in verses five and six that he's weary, that he's weary.
[time=1445] It says he's tired, again pointing to the humanity
[time=1452] of our Lord.
[time=1453] He's weary, he's tired.
[time=1455] They're all hungry, those who had been traveling with him.
[time=1457] It says in verse eight and we'll get to that, that they had gone away into the city to buy food.
[time=1463] And where does he go?
[time=1464] He's weary, he's tired, he's hungry, he's been traveling on difficult roads over difficult terrain.
[time=1471] And where does he go?
[time=1472] He sits by the well.
[time=1474] Says there, he sits by the well.
[time=1475] Why?
[time=1476] Because he's got something to give.
[time=1478] Something she needs.
[time=1479] Well, who's she?
[time=1480] Look at verse seven.
[time=1481] It says there came a woman of Samaria to draw water.
[time=1484] And Jesus said to her, give me a drink.
[time=1486] For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.
[time=1490] Verse nine, the Samaritan woman therefore said to him, how is it that you being a Jew, ask me for a drink since I am a Samaritan and not just a Samaritan, but a Samaritan woman, which would have been unheard of in that day.
[time=1504] How is it that you being a Jew, ask me a Samaritan woman for Jews have no dealings with Samaritans and Jesus answered and said to her, if you knew the gift of God and who it is who says to you, give me a drink, you would have asked him.
[time=1520] And he would have given you living water.
[time=1523] Big question, number two for you this morning.
[time=1528] Got your pen?
[time=1529] Big question, number two.
[time=1532] Do you find it difficult at times to open your mouth?
[time=1537] Do you struggle at times to speak?
[time=1540] In situations where hope and eternity
[time=1547] and forgiveness are on the line, do you sometimes find it difficult to open your mouth and say something?
[time=1554] Now I want you to see what he didn't do, all right?
[time=1559] I want you to notice what he didn't do.
[time=1563] What he didn't do was he didn't encounter this woman at this well and sit there on the well and say to himself, okay, by the way I sit on this well,
[time=1577] I'm gonna sit on this well really well.
[time=1579] And by the way I sit on it, she's gonna notice something different about me.
[time=1583] I'm gonna sit on this well and hold myself up high
[time=1589] and she's gonna come by and she's gonna say, hey, you sit on that well, really well.
[time=1593] Is there a reason why?
[time=1595] I'm Veno, I'm Veno, say, you know, he didn't do that.
[time=1598] And I'm not taking a pot shot at lifestyle evangelism, okay?
[time=1603] I understand you have to be good news before you share it.
[time=1608] I realized that.
[time=1610] But people so many times, you and I both use that as such an excuse.
[time=1617] So many times we're so ready and so willing to just live our lives differently.
[time=1623] We're gonna have character and we're gonna have integrity and we're gonna make decisions in our neighborhood and that work, I'm gonna be a straight up guy or a straight up gal and do a good job.
[time=1631] I'm gonna show 'em that I'm different.
[time=1634] But so many times we use that as such a crutch in our dogged commitment to keep our mouths shut.
[time=1643] And I think it's dangerous and I think it's wrong and I think we need some help with that.
[time=1648] I need some help with that, you need some encouragement.
[time=1651] What did he do?
[time=1653] He opened his mouth.
[time=1656] And at this point, hear me now.
[time=1658] I'm not even referring to the doctrinal clarity of some great, eloquent gospel presentation that he would or you would give.
[time=1667] I just want all of us to see that in the presence of one far from faith, he said in essence, hello.
[time=1673] He opened his mouth and said, hi, how 'bout some water?
[time=1678] In the presence of one far from faith, he initiated conversation.
[time=1683] How many times for you and me might hide?
[time=1695] How are you?
[time=1698] Hi.
[time=1700] My name's Jack.
[time=1703] Hi, my name's Steve.
[time=1706] Hi, my name's Tammy.
[time=1708] Hi, my name's Deborah.
[time=1711] Hi, my name's Kelly.
[time=1713] What's yours?
[time=1714] Hard words to speak?
[time=1718] Well, no, not if you're in the mirror, right?
[time=1721] But sometimes difficult words to speak, I realize that when you're in front of a real life person.
[time=1726] How many times might that have at the right time?
[time=1731] 'Cause this is how God works, right?
[time=1733] How many times might hide?
[time=1734] How are you?
[time=1735] My name's Kelly, what's yours?
[time=1738] How many times might that have been used of God to prompt significant conversation if it were the right person at the right time in the right place?
[time=1746] And do you know and do I know when it's the right person at the right time at the right place?
[time=1750] No, so you better open your mouth and say hi.
[time=1753] Better be willing as he was here to initiate conversation.
[time=1759] Remember, please, that your mouth, and those words, it says in Matthew 12, but your mouth and those things that come out of it are connected to your what?
[time=1767] To your heart.
[time=1770] And in your heart, if you know him this morning, in your heart, if you live in relationship with him today, in your heart, you have life giving truth.
[time=1777] You have water that's living.
[time=1782] Now, before we move on, it's important to note that the hello, give me a drink of water.
[time=1790] But the hello elicited a response.
[time=1794] Watch this now.
[time=1797] The give me a drink did elicit a response and he's prepared.
[time=1802] You start this through, he's prepared to further the conversation with a thought provoking, write this down, with a thought provoking, value surfacing statement or question.
[time=1818] Please write it down.
[time=1820] He was prepared to further the conversation as he offers a thought provoking value surfacing statement.
[time=1829] Verse 10, look at it again.
[time=1830] He answered and said to her, if you knew, oh, if you knew the gift of God and who it is, who says to you, give me a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water.
[time=1842] Okay, now granted, he's Jesus, all right?
[time=1845] He's good at this.
[time=1846] We're not him.
[time=1847] Granted, he's Jesus.
[time=1849] And whether or not you or I could cut to the chase this quickly or this well isn't the point.
[time=1854] People, this morning, here's the point.
[time=1855] Please get this.
[time=1856] The point is, he knew.
[time=1859] He knew and we need to know as well where to go.
[time=1864] He knew where to lead it.
[time=1867] He knew what was important to try and get to.
[time=1870] A statement or perhaps a question that attempts to move the conversation toward that which matters most.
[time=1878] And people, what matters most in those situations?
[time=1882] What's up for grabs?
[time=1884] What's at stake?
[time=1885] What matters most?
[time=1886] What they think of you?
[time=1888] No, what matters most is their what?
[time=1890] Their heart.
[time=1891] That's what matters most.
[time=1893] When you talk to your kids, what matters most?
[time=1896] Their behavior or are you getting to their heart?
[time=1899] Their heart.
[time=1900] When you talk to a friend at work and as you have opportunity for conversation, if given the opportunity, if having the chance to ask questions or make statements that kind of surface their values and doing so you get to look into their heart.
[time=1917] Well, she's fascinated.
[time=1918] Oh, she is absolutely fascinated, but she's still stuck as we'll see here.
[time=1925] She's stuck in the literal.
[time=1928] She thinks he's talking about real water.
[time=1932] She thinks that he's talking about physical thirst and this well where they're at here.
[time=1937] Look at verse 11.
[time=1939] She says to him, "Sir, you have nothing to draw with "and the well is deep, where then do you get that living water?
[time=1948] "You are not greater than our father, Jacob, are you?
[time=1950] "Who gave us the well and drank of it himself "and his sons and his cattle?" She's stuck, so he comes at it again.
[time=1958] I want you to note that, all right?
[time=1961] As we keep going here, I want you to know, he stays at it.
[time=1966] He comes at it again, trying what?
[time=1968] Trying to surface and help her understand the spiritual need that existed in her life, the spiritual thirst that existed in her soul, her need for living water.
[time=1984] And part of why I've been so excited and so looking forward to this time together, us, this family, in this room, this passage, this truth, is because as I look through it again, as I have these last couple of weeks, I'm reminded all over again, and I hope you're being reminded of it now, that you have this woman at the well and this encounter and what he was trying to do and what was holding her back, you bump into this, you live with this, you work with this, you see hearts like this every day, people.
[time=2014] Kids, kids, you guys, you bump into this, you see other kids, you know of other students whose hearts are empty, whose souls are thirsty for something that will quench their thirst.
[time=2030] And so he stays at it, his love for her and his desire to see her find him compels him
[time=2041] to move on, look at verse 13, Jesus answered and said to her, everyone, everyone who drinks of this water, this water, okay, now picture him pointing to the well, Jacob's well, this parcel of land, woman right here, this, everyone who drinks this water shall thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I give him shall never thirst, but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.
[time=2072] She doesn't get it, she still doesn't get it.
[time=2080] As the passage goes on and as we'll read here in just a moment, she's still stuck in the literal.
[time=2088] She doesn't get it, question for you this morning, did it take you think back?
[time=2094] Those of you today living in relationship with our Lord,
[time=2100] did it take you a while to get it?
[time=2105] Can you think back to that time in your life when you were first beginning to realize that there was a thirst in your soul that nothing could quench?
[time=2115] Maybe it was a friend who was sharing the truth with you, maybe it was a church that tried to boldly proclaim it, maybe anything, did it take you a while to get it?
[time=2127] By again, maybe you're here this morning and you're not convinced, you haven't crossed over that line of faith, still searching, still seeking, is it taking you a while to get it?
[time=2142] We understand, he understands, she wasn't getting it.
[time=2146] Look at verse 15, the woman said to him, "Sir," it's like you can sense and almost see in her expression in your mind's eye, she's onto something.
[time=2157] I mean, there's the possibility, all right, that these two to three mile walks, she makes every day sometimes twice, maybe she can get rid of them if there's like this water that she doesn't ever have to thirst again.
[time=2169] So she says, "Sir," but then she kind of goes into this kind of demanding, "Sir, "Sir, give me this water." So I will not be thirsty nor come all the way here to draw.
[time=2183] Let me have it, she says, "If you'll give it to me, "I can stop the coming and going." And so finally, it's time.
[time=2194] And so finally with one question, which is really a statement, he begins to open the eyes of her thirsty soul.
[time=2202] Like the master that he was and is, he moves in.
[time=2209] Gently, pointedly and powerfully.
[time=2215] Look at verse 16, he said to her, "Go call your husband, go call your husband,
[time=2225] "and come here," while the woman answered and said, "Well, I have no husband." And Jesus said to her, "You have well said, "I have no husband," for you have had five husbands, and the one whom you now have is not your husband, this you have said truly.
[time=2247] Value surfacing, heart penetrating,
[time=2253] truth revealing statement.
[time=2256] Go call your husband.
[time=2258] He in essence says, "I'm not talking." He in essence figuratively speaking, grabs her by the face and says, "Hey, we're gonna try this one more time.
[time=2267] "I am not talking about this well, "and I am not talking about this real liquid." No, I am talking about the broken well.
[time=2281] I am talking about the empty well that you continue to go to, that you continue to race toward, that you continue to give yourself to, that doesn't quench.
[time=2292] He sees five previous husbands, and a living boyfriend, and what must have been a tired, hurting heart, and he takes the reality, listen now, he takes the reality of her life, and he introduces it.
[time=2311] He introduces it to his truth.
[time=2313] He says, "My dear woman, "what you are obviously longing for, "the quenching of this thirst in your soul.
[time=2322] "That which you are longing for," he says to her, marriage can't fix.
[time=2328] You're about to figure that out, aren't you?
[time=2331] Probably already have.
[time=2333] What you long for in your soul, a man can't fulfill what you're missing in your heart.
[time=2339] Humans can't take care of.
[time=2341] Question number three for you this morning.
[time=2347] Big question, write it down, talk about it, pray about it, think about it, ask each other about it.
[time=2353] Are you willing?
[time=2354] Are you willing in the opportunities that God gives you?
[time=2359] Are you willing in the relationships that you have and have worked hard at furthering?
[time=2363] Are you willing to introduce his truth to their reality?
[time=2369] Again, for some, that might seem scary.
[time=2376] For others of you, it might even seem judgmental, but understand it's all on how you do it.
[time=2381] I'm not talking about a Bible thumping message from a distance that says shame on you.
[time=2388] Let me introduce you to his truth and get your ugly, sinful, detestable reality straightened up.
[time=2394] No, I'm talking about a loving heart.
[time=2398] He didn't handle her that way.
[time=2399] Oh, he loved her.
[time=2401] He was gentle, he was direct, he was patient, and he lovingly introduced her reality to his truth.
[time=2409] Are you willing to?
[time=2410] Now, realize, to introduce their reality to his truth takes time, respect has to be, garnered, trust has to be built, that takes time, trust, and tact, but more than anything it takes love, people.
[time=2424] More than anything it takes love.
[time=2428] Do you love him?
[time=2430] Is there a love in your heart?
[time=2432] And a hope in your heart for what they could experience and have?
[time=2435] And if there is, that love will compel you to pursue them.
[time=2440] What would that sound like?
[time=2443] I took a chance here, okay?
[time=2447] It's just an experiment.
[time=2448] Maybe it'll work, maybe it won't, but I'm being upfront with you.
[time=2454] 'Cause you know me well enough, I'm trying my best to make this as real as possible.
[time=2461] Just as real and everyday as it could be.
[time=2463] So, what does it look like?
[time=2465] What does it sound like when you or I might be willing to introduce in a loving, compelling way, their reality to his truth?
[time=2472] Well, I just kind of, in my own mind, conjured up some conversations.
[time=2477] Real ones that could happen between you and a friend, between me and a friend, all right?
[time=2481] And I put some names on here, tried to think of, they ever tried to think of names that aren't in existence in a place of about 2,000 people, so I probably failed miserably.
[time=2491] But so if you hear your name, I'm not talking about you, I just made up a name to have a conversation with myself late at night a few nights ago, okay?
[time=2499] What would it sound like?
[time=2500] Kids, listen, kids, listen, maybe you need to have a conversation with a good friend.
[time=2508] Hey, Rob.
[time=2513] We're friends.
[time=2514] I think I can ask this.
[time=2518] Have you ever thought about, Rob?
[time=2520] Have you ever thought about how many of your brokered mergers and acquisitions you'll enjoy in eternity?
[time=2526] Sarah, we're friends, right?
[time=2533] All right.
[time=2535] And I'm thankful for our friendship.
[time=2537] And I'm gonna try and love you by asking you this question.
[time=2543] And if you sense some little bit of sarcasm, I'm just kind of trying to make it easy.
[time=2547] But Sarah, I love you, and I wanna ask this.
[time=2550] And I hope we can talk about it.
[time=2551] When Sarah, you're standing before God, when it's all over, said and done.
[time=2556] When you're standing before God and your kids and husband, at what point, Sarah, do you think God will ask the questions about the clean and orderly rooms, the unspotted carpet and the clothes folded just the right way?
[time=2570] Before or after, the questions about the intimacy and your relationships with those same kids and husband.
[time=2580] Hey, Frank, Frank, I love you.
[time=2586] I want so much more for you.
[time=2588] Frank, how many hangovers, broken relationships, and how much heartache are you going to suffer and dish out before you admit there's a better place to go with your pain, a place better yet a person that can heal your hurting heart?
[time=2603] Hey, Jessica, we're friends,
[time=2610] and have been through a lot together.
[time=2612] I know, you've given me freedom in the past to ask and share my heart with you, so I'm going to try again.
[time=2618] Jessica, I think there's a better way to deal with all that you hate about yourself, a healthier way of wrestling, with those things you don't like about you instead of taking it out on others with your cold and critical treatment of them.
[time=2636] Jessica, I love you.
[time=2639] Wouldn't you like to have a heart and demeanor that was warm and inviting?
[time=2644] I don't know how I did there, but those are just some questions.
[time=2652] Those are just some conversations that come to my mind that probably could come to your mind if you thought about it, if you thought about him, if you thought about her long enough, and what you hoped for for them, and without judgment and without condemnation, we're willing in love and respect to ask questions that allowed conversations to go places that really matter to the issues of the heart.
[time=2678] I'm going to ask you one more question, then we're going to wrap this up.
[time=2684] One more question, fourth question.
[time=2686] And the fourth question is this, are you ready?
[time=2691] Are you ready to have your thirst quenched?
[time=2694] Are you ready, maybe even this morning,
[time=2701] to have your thirst quenched?
[time=2703] Watch this.
[time=2704] The woman, verse 19, just read along with me.
[time=2709] The woman said to him, "Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.
[time=2711] "Our father's worshiped in this mountain, "and you people say that in Jerusalem is the place "where men ought to worship." And Jesus said to her, "Woman, believe me.
[time=2720] "An hour is coming when neither in this mountain, "nor in Jerusalem." In other words, woman, an hour is coming when this controversy will mean nothing.
[time=2727] Verse 22, "You worship that which you do not know,
[time=2734] "we worship that which we know, for salvation is from the Jews.
[time=2737] "But an hour is coming, and now is, "when the true worshipers shall worship the Father "in spirit and truth for such people the Father seeks "to be his worshipers.
[time=2746] "God is spirit in those who worship him, "must worship in spirit and truth." And the woman said to him, "I know that Messiah is coming.
[time=2755] "He who is called Christ, when that one comes, "he will declare all things to us." And Jesus said to her, "I who speak to you, am he." The woman, verse 28, leaves her water pot, goes into the city, and says to the men, "Come see a man who told me all the things that I have done." This is not the Christ, is it?
[time=2776] And they went out of the city and were coming to him.
[time=2778] In the meanwhile, the disciples were requesting him, saying, "Rabbi, eat." And he says to them, "I have food to eat "that you do not know about." And verse 33, disciples, verse 34, "Jesus said to them, "My food is to do the will of him "who sent me and to accomplish his work.
[time=2793] "Do not say there are yet four months, "and then comes to harvest.
[time=2797] "Behold," says to the disciples, lift up your eyes, look, look on the fields, that they are white for harvest.
[time=2805] There are thirsty people everywhere, he says.
[time=2808] Verse 39, and from that city, many of the Samaritans believed in him because of the word of the woman.
[time=2817] Guess who God saved?
[time=2820] Guess who got her thirsty soul filled?
[time=2825] Guess who stopped going to broken wells?
[time=2830] That woman, she comes to know Christ.
[time=2833] Because of the word of the woman who testified, he told me all the things that I have done.
[time=2839] So when the Samaritans came to him, they were asking him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days, and many more believed because of his word.
[time=2848] Where are you today?
[time=2853] How thirsty is your soul?
[time=2858] How far do you feel from God?
[time=2860] As he told you things today, as he said things to your heart that only he knows, as his word penetrated even more and more so into the depths of your heart and life.
[time=2873] And do you sense that there is a well that you can drink from a well full of living water?
[time=2880] He hopes for that, I hope for that.
[time=2889] That you would come and taste in relationship with him, a water that never goes away, a quenching of your thirst that brings hope
[time=2902] and forgiveness and joy and peace.
[time=2904] Says in Jeremiah, I think it's gonna come on the screen, Jeremiah 2, 13.
[time=2909] Let me read this to you this morning.
[time=2911] And then, in fact, as I'm reading, why don't we just ask the folks to come up, we're gonna close with a song.
[time=2918] Jeremiah 2, 13 says this.
[time=2920] For my people have committed two evils, it's two things that happen again and again.
[time=2926] For my people have committed two evils, they have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters to hue or kids, that means dig for themselves, cisterns, broken cisterns that can hold no water.
[time=2949] See, if you're far from God this morning, or you're already convinced, either way, it's kind of the same thing at times, we run from him.
[time=2958] Convinced, we can find wells that will quench when you know and I know in all reality we can't.
[time=2964] And his heart and his love for you compels him, as it did with this woman, to proclaim to you this morning the truth that you can drink of a water that satisfies.
[time=2976] You can stop running to wells that are empty, and live a life full of forgiveness and hope in relationship with him where sins are forgiven and shame's taken away, and life can be lived with purpose.
[time=2989] And that's in relationship with him.
[time=2991] If you wanna talk about that, if you wanna pray about that, if you wanna ask some more questions about that, we would love to talk with you after the service this morning.
[time=3000] I'll be down here, others will be down here, and we'd love to get to know you better, help you think through these things.
[time=3006] If you're already convinced in the family of God, living in relationship with him, but this morning has been a stark reminder to you of how easy it is at times to drift toward wells that don't quench, how easy at times it is to not speak, how easy at times it is to not be willing to introduce hurting people and their reality, the truth of a living God that you know.
[time=3031] If you need some encouragement, if you need some reminders, if you need some accountability, please talk to somebody, talk to us if you'd like, but talk to a friend, somebody in your ABF, somebody in your small group, someone you know and trust, show them those three, four questions this morning and ask them to pray for you.
[time=3051] We're gonna hear a song, listen closely, and allow the words of the song, allow its message to speak to your heart, and I'll come back up and close us in just a minute.
[time=3063] [MUSIC] The twelve of you walked on the earth together [MUSIC] The father was a brother to you all [MUSIC] When he had to go [MUSIC] Had the words to show [MUSIC] Where he went he was with you that day [MUSIC] There were times of awesome inspiration [MUSIC] There were times you didn't understand [MUSIC] When he had to go [MUSIC] And you felt alone [MUSIC] Must have been so hard to see his play [MUSIC] I think about the way you carried on [MUSIC] In the face of persecution used to extraordinary [MUSIC] So I will follow Christ [MUSIC] I will run the race [MUSIC] Fighting the good fight [MUSIC] Standing on my face [MUSIC] I will wear the name of Jesus [MUSIC] I will give him all my life [MUSIC] As for me no matter what the sacrifice [MUSIC] I will follow Christ [MUSIC] Now I don't have to look across the ages [MUSIC] His voice is speaking in my heart today [MUSIC] His word is like a flame [MUSIC] Consuming all my shame [MUSIC] His life a spinning world to show the waves [MUSIC] So I will follow Christ [MUSIC] I will run the race [MUSIC] Fighting the good fight [MUSIC] Standing on my face [MUSIC] I will wear the name of Jesus [MUSIC] I will give him all my life [MUSIC] As for me no matter what the sacrifice [MUSIC] I will follow Christ [MUSIC] To the one who want me to recognize [MUSIC] Living like someone's heart belongs to you [MUSIC] The kingdom that was sealed on cavalry [MUSIC] I will show the world what I believe [MUSIC] I will follow Christ [MUSIC] I will run the race [MUSIC] Fighting the good fight [MUSIC] Standing on my face [MUSIC] I will wear the name of Jesus [MUSIC] I will give him all my life [MUSIC] As for me there is no greater sacrifice [MUSIC] I will follow Christ [MUSIC] I will wear the name of Jesus [MUSIC] I will give him all my life [MUSIC] As for me no he is no greater sacrifice [MUSIC] I will follow Christ [MUSIC] I will follow Christ [MUSIC] I will give him all my life [MUSIC] I will give him all my life ♪
[time=3316] (audience applauding) - Hi, I'm Kelly Bird-Paster here at Blackhawk.
[time=3328] And I wanted to take just a couple of minutes today to catch you up on some exciting things that God's doing here in our church.
[time=3336] And we wanted to just make sure you knew about it and were informed.
[time=3340] This last summer, we spent the entire summer here at Blackhawk in our Sunday morning worship times together in one service.
[time=3347] We used to have two services and we thought it would be great to be together as a family.
[time=3351] And we loved it so much that we've chosen to keep that format into the fall.
[time=3355] And so I wanted to just make sure you all were aware of what our Sunday morning format is like.
[time=3361] Many of you have church homes.
[time=3363] We realized that.
[time=3364] And for that, we're thankful.
[time=3366] And we hope and pray you'll continue to be a part of what God's doing in your church family.
[time=3372] Many of you, though, don't have a church home.
[time=3374] In fact, you consider maybe the Bible hour and your chance to see what we're doing each week as your home.
[time=3381] And so we wanted to just make sure you were aware because we'd love to see you.
[time=3385] We're glad you watch, but we would also be really thankful for the chance to share these times with you.
[time=3390] So Sunday mornings, here's how it stacks up.
[time=3393] 9 o'clock to 10 o'clock Sunday school.
[time=3396] For all ages, we'd love to have you be a part of that.
[time=3399] 10 to 10.30 is our fellowship time.
[time=3401] The juices poured, the donut holes are out, the music's playing, and we're just having a sweet time.
[time=3406] Getting to know people, catching up with folks.
[time=3408] We haven't seen in a while, new people, meeting established Blackhawk people.
[time=3412] It's a good thing.
[time=3413] And then from 10.30 to 11.45 is our worship.
[time=3417] We are just together to praise God, to worship Him.
[time=3421] And those times have been just sweet.
[time=3423] And then we're studying God's Word.
[time=3425] Actually, starting a new series this week on the Book of Acts.
[time=3428] And we're excited about what we feel like God might have for our church as we study that great book.
[time=3434] Now also, we're adding a worship service to our format of worship each week.
[time=3440] We're adding a Wednesday night service.
[time=3442] We're calling it common ground, and it meets each Wednesday night at 6.45 right here at the church.
[time=3448] In fact, we're serving dinner.
[time=3450] Come one, come all.
[time=3451] For $1.50.
[time=3452] Imagine that.
[time=3453] Dinner for $1.50.
[time=3454] From 5.30 to 6.30.
[time=3456] And then our worship service, common ground, 6.45 to about 8 o'clock.
[time=3460] It'll be the same message from our Sunday morning worship times.
[time=3465] We're going to worship.
[time=3466] We're going to study God's Word.
[time=3467] It'll be a great opportunity for you to come and be a part of what's going on here.
[time=3471] What's going on here in this place.
[time=3473] We're thankful for what God allows us to do each week as we bring you the Bible hour.
[time=3478] Thankful for your ongoing prayer and support.
[time=3481] But just want you to know how much you would mean to us if for whatever.
[time=3485] We'll look forward to being a part of what God's doing here at Black Hawk together in the days ahead.
[time=3502] For a cassette copy of today's message, please call and request the tape numbers shown.
[time=3509] The Bible hour is made possible by the support of the Founders Club members.
[time=3513] If you'd like to join the Founders Club, please write to us.
[time=3516] Here's our address.
[time=3517] The Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=3524] Or if you'd like, please call for information.
[time=3527] This is Craig Volker on behalf of the entire Bible hour staff inviting you to join us each week for the Bible hour.
