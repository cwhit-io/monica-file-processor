[time=535] - For the hope that you have.
[time=537] - Always?
[time=539] - Everyone?
[time=540] That seems like an awfully big assignment.
[time=542] - I'm not sure I can do it all by myself.
[time=545] - You can do it.
[time=546] - Choose from a variety of approaches.
[time=548] - Designed to meet the needs of the world's diversified population.
[time=551] - For instance, we have the subtle approach for the clever Christian.
[time=556] - Hello there, my name's Mark.
[time=558] - And I'm Suzy.
[time=558] - We're conducting a survey in your neighborhood.

[time=564] - Divorce.
[time=565] - Are you belonging to any civic organizations?
[time=566] - Church.

[time=570] - Would you like to be?
[time=572] (audience laughing) - Next, the direct approach for the more forceful Christian.
[time=579] - You there, stop where you are and fall to your knees.
[time=582] Repent and turn from your evil ways so you can be seated from the holy one.
[time=586] - The intellectual approach often appeals to the more intelligent Christian.
[time=592] - Have you ever stopped to wonder?
[time=596] - Who am I?
[time=598] - Why am I here?
[time=601] - Where am I going?
[time=603] - Let me show you a little booklet that helped me solve some of these disturbing questions.
[time=608] - And last, but not least, is the ever popular silent witness for the shy Christian.
[time=617] (gentle music)
[time=626] - Yeah, but I've tried all of those ways.
[time=628] - With very little.
[time=630] - If any.
[time=631] - Success.
[time=632] Remember the early days of the church.
[time=635] - In one day, 3,000 souls received the word and were baptized.
[time=638] - With great power, the apostles gave witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus.
[time=643] - And much grace was upon them all.
[time=645] - 3,000 souls in one day?
[time=648] - I've never even had anyone say.
[time=650] I'll think about it.
[time=653] - Maybe.
[time=655] - Someday.
[time=656] - I know my testimony is lacking something.
[time=660] - But what?
[time=661] Power.
[time=663] - The ability to act.
[time=665] - Strength.
[time=666] - Force.
[time=667] - Authority.
[time=668] - But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you.
[time=671] - And you will be my witnesses.
[time=673] - In Jerusalem?
[time=674] - And in all Judea.
[time=675] - In Samaria.
[time=676] - And to the ends of the earth.
[time=678] - And you will be my witnesses.
[time=680] - In Fort Wayne.
[time=681] - In Allen County.
[time=682] - In all of Indiana.
[time=684] - And even around the world.
[time=686] - Hm, power.
[time=688] - The Holy Spirit.
[time=689] - Witnesses.
[time=691] - Lord, are you sure you mean?
[time=695] - Me?
[time=697] - I feel so inadequate.
[time=700] - So fearful.
[time=701] - So small.
[time=702] - You are my witnesses, declares the Lord.
[time=705] - Do not be afraid.
[time=707] - Keep on speaking.
[time=709] - Do not be silenced.
[time=710] - For I am with you.
[time=712] - Then it is true.
[time=713] - I can't do it by myself.
[time=715] - But then no one ever even asked me to do it.
[time=718] - All by myself.
[time=720] - The only true witness.
[time=721] - The only effective witness.
[time=723] - Must come from God.
[time=724] - By the Holy Spirit.
[time=726] - Through me.
[time=728] - Let the redeemed of the Lord say so.
[time=731] - Continually.
[time=732] - With joy.
[time=733] - And with power.
[time=734] - Come, let us tell of His excellent greatness.
[time=736] - That we might by all possible means save some.
[time=739] - But do this with gentleness and respect.
[time=742] fortified with joy equipped with unlimited power never alone let the redeemer the Lord say so
[time=749] oh power is clear in Jesus name in earth and end in Jesus name
[time=769] and in Jesus name I come to you to share his power as he told me to
[time=788] He said free, free, you have received free, free, free, dear
[time=807] oh in my name and we cause you relief, others will know that I'm here
[time=823] On the game I see you in Jesus name, I've been born again in Jesus name
[time=840] and in Jesus name I come to you to share his power as he told me to
[time=858] He said free, free, you have received free, free, free, dear
[time=881] oh in my name and we cause you relief, others will know that I'm here
[time=904] open your Bibles to the book of Acts, Acts chapter 1 verses 1 to 11, Acts chapter 1 verses 1 to 11
[time=916] and I want you to follow along with me if you would Matthew, Mark, Luke, John and then the book of
[time=924] Acts just before you get to the book of Romans. Verse 1 the first account I composed theophilus
[time=934] about all that Jesus began to do and teach until the day when he was taken up after he had by the
[time=941] Holy Spirit given orders to the apostles whom he had chosen. To these he also presented himself
[time=947] alive after his suffering by many convincing proofs appearing to them over a period of 40 days
[time=955] and speaking of the things concerning the kingdom of God and gathering them together he commanded
[time=961] them not to leave Jerusalem but to wait for what the father had promised which he said you heard
[time=968] from me for John baptized with water but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit
[time=974] not many days from now. Verse 6 and so when they had come together they were asking him saying
[time=981] Lord is it at this time you are restoring the kingdom to Israel and he said to them it is not for you to know times or epochs which the father has fixed by his own authority but
[time=992] but you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you and you shall be my witnesses
[time=1002] both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and even to the remotest part of the earth and after he had said these things he was lifted up while they were looking on and a cloud received
[time=1013] him out of their sight and as they were gazing intently into the sky while he was departing
[time=1019] behold two men in white clothing stood beside them and they also said men of Galilee why do you
[time=1026] stand looking into the sky this Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven will come in just
[time=1032] the same way as you have watched him go into heaven. A single runner winds his way toward a packed
[time=1044] stadium his is the last leg of a relay that has taken other runners across open farmland
[time=1051] along vast oceans and through busy streets it's been an inspiring journey full of intense challenge
[time=1057] and ancient tradition the carrying of the Olympic torch. Now as this final torch bearer enters a
[time=1065] dark passageway and then emerges into the brilliant light of the arena the crowd erupts in thunderous
[time=1072] applause holding the flame high the runner ascends a towering flight of stairs as he reaches the top
[time=1079] he turns with torch in hand and with the cameras flashing and the eyes of the nations watching
[time=1086] the enormous flame is lit the symbol of the olympic spirit you know the bible teaches a similar
[time=1094] relay it traces for us the steps of a very similar race only with a different torch
[time=1102] you see in the bible the torch that is passed from runner to runner the torch that is passed from
[time=1109] patriarch to prophet the torch that is passed from the prophet to the people is christ through the generations and genealogies until our lord himself stepped onto the scene that morning
[time=1122] in Bethlehem from there it burned bright during his ministry here on earth and then from burning
[time=1129] bright it escalates to an all-out explosion that torch explodes and its ultimate glory and power
[time=1138] when he conquered death and rose from the grave and it is then at that point in human history at
[time=1146] that point in the unfolding story it is at that point in time that a new amazing group of torch
[time=1154] bearers step forward and with fire with with the fire of christ in their hearts and a deep love
[time=1162] for god they began to spread his flame boldly this book this book that we begin to study
[time=1172] this morning is their story capturing not the olympic spirit but instead the spirit of the church
[time=1180] and its birth and the growth of the gospel now as we jump in i want to just give you some interesting
[time=1188] side notes we've got some four main points this morning i want to make sure you track with me
[time=1194] on and take note of but before we jump into the main body of the passage this morning just some interesting side notes some introductory things you may want to write down and give some thought to and be aware of number one luke luke the physician as paul referred to him in colossians
[time=1210] 414 luke is the author of this book the acts of the apostles luke matthew mark luke author of
[time=1218] the third gospel luke is the author as well of this great book that we begin to study this morning
[time=1225] if you look back at luke go ahead just flip back there real quick a few books back matthew mark luke john look at luke chapter one want you to just see that the similarity here want you to see the
[time=1235] how obvious this is and how important it is as you think about the flow of the gospels and then
[time=1242] into this book of acts luke chapter one see it there in verse one now listen closely
[time=1248] i love how this is said luke chapter one verse one and as much as many have undertaken to compile
[time=1255] an account of the things accomplished among us just as those who from the beginning were i witnesses
[time=1262] and servants of the word have handed that handed them down to us it seemed fitting for me as well
[time=1269] having investigated everything carefully from the beginning to write it out for you in consecutive
[time=1276] order most excellent theophilus so that you might know the exact truth about the things
[time=1287] you have been taught the exact truth go back to acts back to the book of acts chapter one
[time=1296] right there at the beginning there you have it the first account i composed theophilus
[time=1303] about all that jesus began to do in teach until the day when he was taken up after he had by the
[time=1309] holy spirit given orders to the apostles whom he had chosen acts then is luke's sequel acts is the
[time=1318] sequel to that third gospel and it was in that third gospel that we began to see exactly who jesus
[time=1324] was what he did what he accomplished and now here we are in the book of acts and the story continues
[time=1331] and whereas in the gospel we began to see who he was and what he did what he did now in the book of acts we will see what he continued to do not now through his own personal presence because now
[time=1343] he has departed but now we will see the continuation of what he established now through this wonderful
[time=1349] thing called the church acts the sequel to the third gospel of luke acts is also a sequel to the
[time=1358] other gospels as well and you see this as you compare how the other gospels ended and what you see
[time=1364] right here in the beginning of the book of acts note how each gospel ends you don't have to turn
[time=1371] there just listen Matthew 28 we see discussion about christ's resurrection mark 16 we see data
[time=1378] about christ's ascension luke 24 christ promising the holy spirit john 21 we see talk of christ
[time=1386] and his second coming and what you will see is that in these first 11 verses of this first chapter in
[time=1394] the book of acts in these first 11 verses all four of those themes his resurrection his
[time=1401] ascension the promise of the holy spirit his second coming all four of those things begin to be even in the first 11 verses tied in tied into the flow of this book and how they relate
[time=1412] to the church as chuck swindall says acts becomes a bridge taking us from the life of christ and
[time=1418] the gospels to the practical everyday theology of the epistles the book also thirdly has an easy
[time=1425] outline want to make sure you note this make sure that you're aware of this the book has an easy
[time=1431] to follow and very interesting outline look at chapter one verse eight but you shall receive power
[time=1437] when the holy spirit has come upon you and you shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and even to the remotest part of the earth just so you know chapters one through
[time=1449] seven will teach us and show us and we will see in those chapters the birth of the church and the growth of the gospel in Jerusalem chapters one through seven we've been an interesting
[time=1460] sad and yet powerful thing begins to take place you will see after those first seven chapters
[time=1468] starting in chapter eight and then on to verse 12 the introduction of extreme persecution
[time=1475] and it is the persecution that begins to bear down on these early believers in the established
[time=1481] church here in Jerusalem the persecution then begins to scatter these people they begin to flee
[time=1487] they begin to run for their lives they begin to relocate and the scattering caused by the
[time=1493] persecution allows the church to grow and scatter into Judea and into Samaria and then in chapters
[time=1503] 13 through 28 then they're really going to get serious they're going to actually get intentional it's not because of persecution now but in chapters 13 to 28 they actually just flat out begin to
[time=1514] commission missionaries they begin to say you know what there's a whole world out there that we can reach and so in those chapters we get out into the remotest parts of the world one through seven eight through 12 13 to 28 all of it comprised right there in Acts chapter one
[time=1530] verse eight so here we go entering the game of their life a game for all the ages these apostles
[time=1539] would need a game plan an airtight approach to the world changing endeavor they were about to embark
[time=1546] on and before we jump in I want you to please remember one thing as we start very pertinent very important I think for all of you myself included to remember this morning they really
[time=1557] needed a game plan they really needed help I want you to see that and think about that and
[time=1564] understand that so many times we speak of these men and these women so many times they are referred
[time=1572] to and they are talked about in very reverential tones and in a very respectful manner as they
[time=1579] should be but so many times I think they get talked about in such a way as as to almost place
[time=1585] them in this category by themselves oh my goodness the early church fathers oh we are we are speaking
[time=1592] of the the apostles the inner circle the chosen few and though they they are deserving of our
[time=1603] respect we you have to remember this morning a few things number one don't forget how many times
[time=1610] these very same men all throughout the gospels not just at the beginning of the gospels but even
[time=1618] towards the end of each gospel don't forget how many times these very same men were referred to by our lord himself as you you of little what faith they were a struggling crew
[time=1632] they had some bad days don't forget they were men of little faith not to mention their pathetic
[time=1641] disappearing act during the arrest and trial and crucifixion of our lord you see people they had
[time=1648] failed miserably just even recently in their public testimony in their private loyalty
[time=1655] and in their personal faith hear that one more time and ask yourself who does this remind you of
[time=1662] they had failed miserably in their public testimony their private loyalty and personal faith sound
[time=1668] familiar does to me sounds a lot like me these were hear me now these were ordinary normal
[time=1681] frail scared men who because of their faith because of their willingness because of their
[time=1692] teachable hearts changed the world forever changed it forever normal ordinary scared men
[time=1703] just like you and me because their hearts were open their minds were willing normal people who
[time=1709] now had been given a plan a plan to hold on to a plan to follow and i won us this morning in these
[time=1715] first eleven verses to look at that plan because people it is a plan for them and it is a plan for
[time=1721] you it is a plan for anyone who names the name of christ it is a plan that with within its context
[time=1727] gives us perspective and power and opportunity and reminder to be who got called us to be world
[time=1734] changers they had a plan number one first thing we see first thing we see in their plan people is
[time=1743] they had a message they had a message validated by a living lord they had a message validated
[time=1752] by a living lord the first account i composed the awfulness about all that jesus began to do and
[time=1759] teach until verse two the day when he was taken up after he had by the holy spirit given orders
[time=1765] to the apostles whom he had chosen to these he also presented himself alive after his suffering
[time=1773] by many convincing proofs appearing to them over a period of 40 days and speaking of the things concerning the kingdom of god folks understand this morning from the beginning of his earthly
[time=1785] ministry about three years or so prior to this point from the very beginning of his earthly ministry until the day he departed to be with the father these very same men had been taught by him
[time=1797] had been instructed by him had been mentored by him they had traveled with him served with him
[time=1803] prayed with him talked to him spent time with him and had witnessed with their own eyes and with
[time=1811] their own lives his very words and actions the message had been clear and the message they heard
[time=1819] and had seen again and again and again the message of faith in christ saving faith found in christ and
[time=1827] christ alone saving faith found in our lord and only in our lord they had seen that they had heard
[time=1835] that they had watched that very message be accepted and realized thousands of times
[time=1841] no they had a message his miracles strengthened their faith his parables clarified spiritual truth
[time=1850] his teaching helped formulate their theology and worldview transformed lives had bolstered
[time=1857] their resolve he had revealed to them the truth of god the truth of god that saved and brought about
[time=1864] forgiveness and new life and it is this message that would be and was the foundation of their ministry
[time=1870] you see the time had come here in this first chapter of the book of acts the time had come for them
[time=1876] to put what they had been given into action it was time to do it was time to be it was time to
[time=1884] exercise time to to take their gifts and to take their message and proclaim it and speak of it
[time=1892] and live it and do it how about you this morning how about you how active are you these days how
[time=1901] willing are you these days how ready are you these days how involved are you these days in the actual
[time=1907] living out of the actual proclaiming of the actual sharing opening your mouth rolling up your sleeves
[time=1915] giving yourselves to doing all that you can to make an impact to further the kingdom whether it's
[time=1922] with kids whether it's with students whether it's with adults whether it's in a technical field whether it's in a teaching arena whatever it might be is it time for you as it was for them
[time=1932] to jump into the game jump into the opportunity to jump into the privilege
[time=1938] of ministry helping our lord change the world that he has placed around you
[time=1945] well not only did they have a message you guys they didn't just have a message no they had a living
[time=1954] breathing messiah who had days earlier been dead they had a message validated by a living lord
[time=1963] you saw it there in verse three to these he also presented himself alive you see calvary didn't kill
[time=1970] him the grave couldn't hold him murdering hypocrites couldn't silence him and that
[time=1980] that that truth that fundamental foundational truth that really in so many ways is the bedrock
[time=1988] of our faith a resurrected lord that and the proof of that and the reality of that that they
[time=1994] could give their lives to that they could give their hearts to that they they could they were going to jump in now and boy did they jump in he wasn't dead he was alive he had shown himself to
[time=2007] them he had conversed with them and i believe and i think it's implied here in the text i believe they had through his appearances over 40 times uh or excuse me um over a period of 40 days and speaking
[time=2021] of the things concerning the kingdom i believe that completely and thoroughly as possibly it would
[time=2028] you and me as well i believe it completely and thoroughly convinced them of his resurrection and
[time=2035] his message and it was that assurance that gave them and should give you the boldness and love to
[time=2041] speak and to share and to invite and to come alongside and represent the truth they were completely
[time=2049] and absolutely convinced that a message and a living lord interesting to just take note of this
[time=2059] at this point you may have heard this before we mentioned this Wednesday night a few people said
[time=2065] to me they'd never heard this and uh i've always found it to be extremely not only fascinating but
[time=2071] exciting and inspiring and comforting and that is this the um the apostles these these men and what
[time=2081] they did what they what they gave themselves to and where that led for almost all of them which was
[time=2088] a thing called death the apostles and their conviction and and and their boldness and their
[time=2095] love for god and their commitment to their ministry is one of the greatest proofs of the
[time=2101] resurrection think about it and maybe you've already tied this together think about this
[time=2107] these this same band of valiant warriors who went to the grave with that message
[time=2116] were just over here a little while ago a bunch of absolute wimps right did you see them during
[time=2124] the trial were they raising the banner where they fight and i mean peter wax off the guys here in
[time=2130] the garden right but past that we don't even see these guys we don't see them anywhere they are pathetic weak frail running scared of hiding guys who don't make a difference at all and yet
[time=2144] those very same men why that's the question why over here change the then known world
[time=2153] you know the answer most of you do and the answer is what did they change the then
[time=2160] though known world did they exercise all their strength and boldness because they kind of thought
[time=2167] he was alive no people don't do that nobody gives their life for something they think
[time=2174] might be true no no no those guys knew those guys knew he was alive they gave their lives because
[time=2182] of it and in doing so they validate their resurrection itself number two they had spiritual muscle
[time=2189] first of all they had a message validated by a living lord number two they had spiritual muscle
[time=2195] look at verse four it says in gathering them together he commanded them not to leave
[time=2201] Jerusalem but to wait for what the father had promised which he said you heard from me for john baptized with water but you shall be baptized with the holy spirit not many days from now
[time=2211] and so when they had come together they were asking him saying lord is it at this time you are restoring the kingdom of israel they were very aware of what had been talked about back in the Old Testament but he said wait it's not free to know times or epochs or periods which the father has fixed by his own authority but but but first part of verse eight but you shall
[time=2231] receive power when the holy spirit has come upon you you see this was not news to them
[time=2240] you see in luke and you can write these down if you'd like in luke 11 in john chapters 7 14 15 16 and 20 along with luke 24 which i'll ask you to turn to now
[time=2256] jesus himself had already spoken of this very thing this this gift this thing that was coming for them from the father look back in luke 24 verse 45
[time=2268] luke chapter 24 verse 45 here comes the spiritual muscle here comes the help that had been promised
[time=2277] says in luke 24 verse 45 then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures
[time=2284] and he said to them thus it is written that the christ should suffer and rise again from the dead the third day and that repentance for forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his
[time=2295] name to all the nations beginning from Jerusalem you are witnesses of these things and here you go
[time=2302] verse 49 and behold i am sending forth the promise of my father upon you but you are to stay in the
[time=2310] city until you are clothed with power from on high they heard it back there at the end of luke and
[time=2319] now in acts chapter one luke reiterates it yet again important important i think to note something
[time=2325] here and again i think this applies to you i know it applies to me don't forget this having received the message that they had received having taken in and experienced
[time=2338] all that they had taken in and experienced having received the message and having seen the living
[time=2344] lord don't forget how tempting it might have been at that point with that message in that
[time=2350] living lord don't forget how tempting it could have been to just venture out on their own you experience that sometimes i know i do i mean sometimes i'm i'm i'm confronted with or
[time=2363] presented with opportunities to to do something to say something to extend myself and and and being
[time=2369] in possession of the message and and and having served and given myself to a living lord so many times with just those two things i i say to myself let's go let's do this thing let's do whatever needs to be done let's say whatever needs to be said so many times because we have this and this we think boom we're ready to go but this is a great reminder to you and to me a great reminder of
[time=2392] this very thing that all the police here this all the preparation and all the training and all the
[time=2398] knowledge and all the experience one can obtain are absolutely useless without spiritual power
[time=2407] without spiritual power all your diplomas and all your books and all your studies and
[time=2414] all your experiences and all you know absolutely useless and less accompanied by divine strength
[time=2424] and power truth must be accompanied by power the power of the holy spirit now the holy spirit and you a holy spirit and me you know we could talk for weeks and weeks and weeks
[time=2439] we could do a whole series could be ten weeks on us and the holy spirit and the relationship
[time=2445] between the two as presented in god's word i want to read something for you this morning because it talks about it again and again and again through this book and i think it's important that we at least initially find ourselves on the same page fundamentally as to how this plays out
[time=2460] what is the relationship between us and the holy spirit how does that work how did it work here listen closely if you will despite the claims of many the apostles and early disciples experience
[time=2475] is not the norm for believers today they were given unique they were given unique enabling of the holy spirit for their special duties they also received
[time=2487] the general and common baptism with the holy spirit in an uncommon way subsequent to conversion
[time=2495] all believers since the church began are commanded to be filled with the spirit Ephesians 5
[time=2502] and a walk in the spirit Galatians 5 yet these early apostles and believers were told to wait
[time=2508] see it was different our lord told them to wait showing the change that came in the church age
[time=2517] they were in the transitional period associated with the birth of the church in the present age
[time=2524] today baptism by christ through the agency of the holy spirit takes place for all believers
[time=2531] at conversion that's when the spirit of god takes up residence in your heart and mind
[time=2538] at the point of conversion at that moment every believer is placed into the body of christ first
[time=2544] Corinthians 12 at that point the spirit also takes up his permanent residency in the converted person's
[time=2551] soul so there is no such thing as a christian who does not yet have the baptism or filling
[time=2559] of the holy spirit Romans 8 1 Corinthians 6 the baptism with the holy spirit is not a special privilege
[time=2569] for some believers nor are believers challenged and exhorted in scripture anywhere to seek it
[time=2575] it is not even their responsibility to prepare for it by praying or pleading or any other means
[time=2583] no the passive voice of the verb translated be baptized that verb there in the new testament
[time=2589] translated in the passive voice indicates the baptism by Jesus christ with the spirit
[time=2595] is entirely a divine activity it comes from him and him alone it comes like salvation itself
[time=2605] through grace not human effort Titus 3 5 through 6 write that one down Titus 3 5 through 6 says he
[time=2615] saved us not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness but according to his mercy
[time=2621] by the washing of regeneration and renewing by the holy spirit whom he poured out upon us richly
[time=2628] through Jesus Christ our Savior God sovereignly pours out the holy spirit on those he saves
[time=2636] and it is the holy spirit people it is the holy spirit that empowers guides and convicts
[time=2643] these willing simple frail scared men who changed the world and you and me as well
[time=2653] they had a message they had a living lord and they had spiritual muscle wasn't there quite yet
[time=2659] we'll get to that next week but it was coming it was coming and they knew it thirdly they had a mission they had a mission look at the last part of verse 8 having said you shall receive power
[time=2669] when the holy spirit has come upon you and you shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem and in
[time=2675] all jdiah and samaria and even to the remotest part of the earth you shall be my witnesses
[time=2684] this was their mission this was the divine game plan this is how God wanted it done
[time=2691] this is how the then known world would be reached this was their mission the reason for living this is why they existed every breath every day every trial that came their way every individual or
[time=2702] opportunity that presented itself everything that crossed their path was seen through this one lens
[time=2709] they were saying to themselves day after day week after week in the midst of whatever it was they were facing i will be his witness i will be his witness in the morning i will be his witness
[time=2721] at night i will be his witness in the community with my family in my heart i will be his witness
[time=2733] and before we move on don't forget important to remember this this morning if you claim to be a Christian if you're going to nod your head and raise your hand if you're going to say yeah count me and then understand this you are you are a witness kids don't miss this students don't miss
[time=2753] this adults moms and dads businessmen grandma's and grandpa's don't miss this if you raise your hand nod your head and say you're in understand something you are a witness that's not a that's not
[time=2764] what the question is the question is what what kind of witness are you is the question
[time=2773] and you're either a good one you're either an effective one which doesn't mean you're perfect no it means you're honest it means you're authentic it means you're real it means you're following Christ the best you can and when you fail you make it right and you move forward you're either an authentic real genuine kingdom advancing witness or you're a poor one who should probably
[time=2793] keep your mouth shut and put your hand down he says be my witnesses
[time=2800] guess what the greek word i don't expect you to know it but i just couldn't wait to tell you
[time=2806] guess what the greek word for witness is let me let me just say it to you listen to me as i say it
[time=2812] martyr race martyr race which is where we get our word what
[time=2819] martyr martyr tertullian tertullian one of the early church historians said this
[time=2829] their blood he said their blood became the fertilizer of the early church
[time=2839] many he said many were drawn to faith in christ by observing how calmly and joyously christians met their death
[time=2849] that was their mission they were going to be his witness
[time=2855] that was their mission and it wasn't just a catchy phrase all right laminated on some card
[time=2862] hanging on their fridge now it beat deep in their souls it was a part of everything they did it
[time=2868] was with them wherever they went and it should be with you as well and it should be with me as well
[time=2874] deeply embedded not just on the tip of our tongues but in the depths of our souls
[time=2880] and a readiness and a willingness for for all of us of all ages to be his witnesses
[time=2887] to proclaim to speak to live to feel to think to come alongside in ways that have the most
[time=2893] important things the most important priorities the most important endeavors in mind they had a message in a living lord
[time=2904] they had spiritual muscle on the way they had a mission and lastly they had a motive we're going
[time=2910] to end with this oh boy did they have a motive they had an amazing powerful motive look at verses 9
[time=2919] to 11 and after he had said these things he was lifted up while they were looking on and on and
[time=2926] a cloud received him out of their sight and as they were gazing intently into the sky while he was departing behold two men sounds like angels come clothed in clothes and whites stood beside
[time=2937] them and said verse 11 men of Galilee why do you stand looking into the sky in other words in the
[time=2943] vernacular in the vernacular of our day guys you are wasting time the game is on it's time to go
[time=2951] why do you stand there gazing into the sky this Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven
[time=2957] will come in just the same way as you have watched him go into heaven you know how I envision this this dynamic this idea of motive I envision it and again I often
[time=2969] think and speak in athletic terms because they were such a part of my life growing up
[time=2976] but I envision this like I envision a good coach I really do second Corinthians 5 write these down
[time=2986] second Corinthians 5 10 and Revelation 22 12 write them down second Corinthians 5 10
[time=2993] Revelation 22 12 clearly indicate and there were others I could have given you but those two
[time=3000] among others clearly indicate that he is coming back people and he is coming back and he is
[time=3007] extremely interested in how you and I have handled what we've done with what kind of stewards we've
[time=3014] been with that which he's invested in us it says he's coming back and he's coming back and just the
[time=3020] fact that he's coming back as a glorious thing don't get me wrong but he's also coming back and he will be very interested in what you've done and what you've done and what you've done and how you and you and you and me how we have handled what he left us with it gives clear indication
[time=3037] that there will be a sense where he will come and and he will want to know evaluation will take place
[time=3046] and I think about a great coach and when I think about a great coach I'm not saying you have to think this way but when I think of a great coach I think of a guy by the name of John Wooden and as a young boy as a just a little guy who was first beginning to get a glimpse
[time=3064] of sports and I got my first sports illustrated when I was seven and I loved basketball and I
[time=3071] loved football and remember my mom and dad telling my mom went to UCLA for a few years telling me about John Wooden so I started to watch just as a kid John Wooden and I'd watch him I'd watch him on
[time=3082] Saturdays and I'd watch him on weeknights whenever they were on TV I'd watch John Wooden every chance I got and it used to just amaze me and now being older looking back it amazes me more when I see
[time=3092] other coaches and I won't you know name any I won't even do any initials or talk about you know certain schools but I see some coaches in the way they handle themselves and I watch in my mind my memory
[time=3105] of John Wooden and here's the thing that got me John Wooden they'd come out of the
[time=3113] they'd come out of the tunnel right and they do their warmups and he'd be standing over there
[time=3122] yeah that's a little thing like this you remember John Wooden here this
[time=3128] remember that oh program watch him do warmups I wouldn't say a word buzzer goes off starting
[time=3136] lineups I need FC remember John Wooden he'd sit there just like this
[time=3145] 40 minutes you just sit there time out oh okay stand up roll this thing up
[time=3165] talk to his coaches say a few words players go back out you sit back now up by 40 points down
[time=3172] by 30 guess where John was right here and it and then I would read I'd read accounts I'd hear about accounts I'd read about accounts
[time=3189] I'd hear folks talking about the fact that then the then the game would be over and then they'd walk back through the tunnel and they'd go back into the locker room and then he would
[time=3202] close the door and all the little notes what they got talked about and it was interesting nobody
[time=3209] ever heard yelling through the walls nobody ever heard about chairs being thrown or or anything else
[time=3216] but but understand something okay now here's the point the point is that was John Wooden
[time=3223] and they won 10 national championships over a 12 year span in the late 60s and through the 70s
[time=3232] 10 national championships that that demeanor that that thing that was going on there
[time=3240] it evoked in in young men over a decades time the willingness to die for loose balls and fight for
[time=3248] rebounds and show up early and stay late and they would do anything they would climb any
[time=3254] mountain conquer any foe give themselves to the to the point of physical exhaustion for a guy who would they knew at the end of the game sit him down
[time=3265] they weren't being belittled they weren't being berated but he was sitting there watching and that's how I view this and he and and that's what a good coach does because you see coach
[time=3277] Wooden had made such an investment in those players during the week right the practices the meanings it had all been given it had all been said game time comes while you're going to do your thing and the apostles had it the very same way it was game time and it is for you and it is
[time=3296] for me as well and the day is coming when the coach is coming back and not out of fear people
[time=3302] please don't hear me wrong not out of fear not out of this oh my goodness he's coming back
[time=3308] but oh my goodness he's coming back and he's going to want to know how I did with what he's
[time=3315] given me and so I want to do well I want to honor him as best I can I want to die for loose balls fight for rebounds give everything I kept at the point of physical exhaustion because he's coming back and when he comes back I want to hear those words well done good and faithful servant
[time=3335] and I want to give myself to that I want us in this place to give ourselves to that he's coming
[time=3342] back and we have a message people we have a living lord we have spiritual muscle and for us it's not
[time=3348] on the way it came it's here it resides in your heart today if you know him and we have a mission
[time=3355] we're doing our very best to be his witnesses trying to help seekers both saved and searching fine and follow Christ motive I hope that's enough I hope the fact that his love for you
[time=3368] and his willingness to extend you grace you didn't deserve and the fact that he's coming back to hold you accountable and me accountable to that which we've done with all he's given
[time=3379] I want to do that and I want to do it together what do you say let's pray why don't you stand
[time=3385] Father what an amazing book the first 11 chapters it just has our hearts stirred it has our minds
[time=3403] thinking and hopefully even more focused on you and that God what you have for us and want from us
[time=3409] God I pray for this entire family here in this room and those who were here Wednesday night God
[time=3416] I pray we collectively pray God and ask that in the next months as we give our hearts and our lives
[time=3425] and our minds to this truth this book and the story of your church and these people who gave so much
[time=3432] God I pray that there would be a willingness in each of us to grow where we need to grow to think where we need to think God to repent where we need to repent to rethink things to maybe better our
[time=3445] own game plan for the life that we face each day and God we thank you for the truth of your word the
[time=3451] way it penetrates our hearts and minds and I pray this morning as we leave that we would do
[time=3458] everything we can in the coming days to keep this message to keep these 11 verses and that
[time=3464] which we've seen God that we would do all that we can to keep this truth fresh on our minds bring us back to this passage God through the week as families allow us to talk about it and pray about it as friends as small group members as ABF members allow us to hold each other accountable
