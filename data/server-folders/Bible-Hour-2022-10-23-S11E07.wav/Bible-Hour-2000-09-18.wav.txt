[time=244] - I believe the promise about the visions and the dreams that the Holy Spirit will be poured out in His power will be seen.
[time=256] Well, the time is now and the places here and His people have come to faith.
[time=263] There's a mighty sound and a touch of fire when we're gathered in one place.
[time=270] And God, we need the presence of God is here.
[time=277] Someone think they can't be changed but the Spirit of God is here.
[time=283] I believe the presence of God is here.
[time=290] There's two or three together.
[time=293] People rise and say I believe God answers
[time=299] and His presence is in this place.
[time=305] I believe the promise about the visions and the dreams
[time=311] how the Holy Spirit will be poured out in His power will be seen.
[time=317] Well, the time is now and the places here and His people have come to faith.
[time=324] There's a mighty sound and a touch of fire when we're gathered in this place.
[time=331] And God, we need the presence of God is here.
[time=339] Someone think they can't be changed but the Spirit of God is here.
[time=345] God, we need the presence of God is here.
[time=352] There's two or three together.
[time=355] People rise and say I believe God answers.
[time=360] And His presence is in this place.
[time=364] I believe the Spirit of God is here.
[time=539] No ear has heard, no mind has conceived of what God has planned for those He loves.
[time=546] But God has revealed it to us by His Spirit.
[time=550] The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.
[time=554] For who among men knows the thoughts of man except the Spirit within him?
[time=559] In the same way, no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.
[time=565] We have not received the Spirit of the world, but the Spirit who was from God.
[time=570] That we may understand what God has freely given us.
[time=574] The things that God has freely given us.
[time=577] The Spirit doesn't emanate from the pastor, from a deacon, from a musician or anyone.
[time=584] It comes from God.
[time=586] And I notice it most when all of God's people gather together to worship Him.
[time=590] As we all seek God's presence, wisdom, comfort and grace together.
[time=597] You show that you are a letter from Christ, the result of our ministry, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God.
[time=605] Not on tablets of stones, but on tablets of our human hearts.
[time=609] Such confidence as this is ours through Christ before God.
[time=613] Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim anything for ourselves.
[time=617] But our competence comes from God.
[time=620] He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant.
[time=624] Not the letter, but the Spirit.
[time=626] For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.
[time=629] There are times that I can sense the Spirit move deep within my soul as I seek guidance in the sermon.
[time=635] Often I move to a goosebumps state as I'm touched by a song.
[time=640] I don't think it's just the emotion of the moment or the power of the musical language.
[time=645] It's a different kind of experience, one that changes me from the inside out.
[time=650] It swells and becomes electric as I see lives being changed all around me.
[time=656] Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.
[time=662] Do not cast me from your presence or take your Holy Spirit from me.
[time=667] Restore me to the joy of your salvation and grant me a willing spirit to sustain me.
[time=673] The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.
[time=681] It's always comforting to me as we stand and hold hands together unbroken and sing a song in one accord with our brothers and sisters in Christ, giving praise and lifting our hearts together towards the one who loves us.
[time=695] Be filled with the Spirit.
[time=697] Speak to one another with songs, hymns, and spiritual songs.
[time=702] Sing and make music in your heart to the Lord.
[time=706] Always giving thanks to God the Father for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=713] What causes the Spirit to move in this church or in any church?
[time=717] I believe that it must begin with the Spirit that already dwells inside each believer as we pray with a sincere heart.
[time=725] I've heard the Spirit at work in the boldness or tenderness of someone's testimony of how God is at work in their life.
[time=731] I sense the Spirit's presence as I'm comforted of knowing that I'm loved and that someone really cares about me.
[time=739] The Spirit is within us and at times seems to surround us and fill us to overflowing as we truly seek after the One who loves us, the Lord Jesus.
[time=749] I will ask the Father and He will give you another counselor to be with you forever the Spirit of Truth.
[time=755] The world cannot accept Him for it neither sees Him or knows Him, but you know Him.
[time=760] He lives with you and will be in you.
[time=763] The Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in my name will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.
[time=771] This is nearly impossible to explain with words, but once the Holy Spirit resides within you,
[time=778] it seems that you realize what it's like to go home after being gone for a long time and there within is peace.
[time=786] Peace I leave with you, my peace I give to you,
[time=792] do not let your hearts be troubled, do not be afraid.
[time=797] Thanks be to God for sending us His Holy Spirit.
[time=800] May the Spirit move freely and with power as we worship today.
[time=816] Abide in me, I pray.
[time=823] Here I am, call me, for you.
[time=835] I be in your love, bring me to my peace.
[time=847] May I love Jesus more and more.
[time=859] Come, live in me, all my love.
[time=866] Take the fire, come, bring it in me.
[time=874] I will rise, I need the peace.
[time=882] Come, live in me, all my love.
[time=889] Take the fire, come, bring it in me.
[time=897] I will rise, I need the peace.
[time=912] Here I am, wait.
[time=916] Abide in me, I pray.
[time=924] Here I am, call me, for you.
[time=933] I be in your love, bring me to my peace.
[time=947] May I love Jesus more and more.
[time=958] Come, live in me, all my love.
[time=965] Take the fire, come, bring it in me.
[time=973] I will rise, I need the peace.
[time=981] Come, live in me, all my love.
[time=988] Take the fire, come, bring it in me.
[time=996] I will rise, I need the peace.
[time=1034] Well, hey, it is great to be together again.
[time=1038] And I want to just invite you, if I could, to take your Bibles and open them up to Acts chapter 1.
[time=1042] We have just a wonderful privilege again to not only be together, but to be together engaged in a study and a look and a discussion of one of the greatest books given us.
[time=1054] And that is the book of Acts, the birth of the church and the growth of the gospel.
[time=1059] And if you were here last week, when we started out, you'll know that we made our way through the first 11 verses of Acts chapter 1.
[time=1067] And we want to jump in this morning, going to take us kind of quickly here through verses 12 to the end of the first chapter verse 26.
[time=1074] And then this morning we'll jump in with some more detail into a greater level of depth to chapter 2.
[time=1081] Follow along with me, would you?
[time=1083] And I'm going to read starting there in Acts chapter 1 verse 12.
[time=1088] And before we do that, take a look back up, all right?
[time=1091] Take a look back up to verse 4.
[time=1093] Remember, and gathering them together, he commanded them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait.
[time=1104] These that are gathered, the apostles and the followers of Christ.
[time=1109] Remember, he said to them, wait, don't go anywhere.
[time=1113] Don't leave Jerusalem, wait for what the Father had promised, which he said, you heard from me.
[time=1120] Now let's go down to verse 12.
[time=1122] Then they returned to Jerusalem from the Mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away.
[time=1128] And when they had entered, they went up to the upper room where they were staying.
[time=1132] That is Peter, and John, and James, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James, the son of Afeas, and Simon, the zealot, and Judas, the son of James.
[time=1142] These all with, what does your Bible say?
[time=1148] Say it a little bit louder.
[time=1150] One mind, take a note here, just real quick, before we go on.
[time=1155] Please make a note of this, mentally or literally.
[time=1158] These all with one mind.
[time=1164] You see, God is about to do something absolutely miraculous, people.
[time=1168] God is about to do something absolutely amazing.
[time=1171] God is about to use these people to birth something and begin something that will be unlike anything the then known world had ever seen.
[time=1180] And please take note of the fact that he's not about to use a fragmented, bitterness-filled, complaining, disunified group of people.
[time=1191] Is he?
[time=1195] No.
[time=1196] No, he is going to use, if we're talking about something special, if we're talking about something amazing, if we're talking about something world-changing, he's about to use the people who were of one mind.
[time=1209] And they weren't just of one mind, they were also continually devoting themselves to prayer, along with the women in Mary, the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.
[time=1218] And at this time, verse 15, Peter stood up in the midst of the brethren, a gathering of about 120 persons was there together and said, this is Peter, verse 16, brethren.
[time=1229] The Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit foretold by the mouth of David concerning Judas.
[time=1236] Now this is not the Judas mentioned down here in verse 13, Judas the Son of James, this is Judas who?
[time=1244] As scary, that's right, they'd lost one, right?
[time=1248] You remember that, they were twelve, now they were eleven, one had turned traitor, one had led the Roman cohort to the Lord himself there in the garden.
[time=1259] Says there in verse 16, the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus, for he was counted among us and received his portion in this ministry.
[time=1270] Now this man, verse 18, acquired a field with the price of his wickedness, and falling headlong, which translated means he hung himself, he burst open in the middle, and all his bowels gushed out.
[time=1284] And it became known to all who were living in Jerusalem so that in their own language, that field was called Haquelema, that is field of blood.
[time=1294] For it is written there in verse 20 in the book of Psalms, let his homestead be made desolate, and let no man dwell in it, and his office, his position of disciple, soon to be a apostle, and his office let another man take.
[time=1309] It is therefore, Peter now, verse 21, necessary, that of the men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, beginning with the baptism of John until the day that he was taken up from us, one of these should become a witness
[time=1323] with us of his resurrection.
[time=1326] And they put forward two men, Joseph called Bar-Sabbas, who was also called Justice and Matthias.
[time=1333] These two guys were put forward, and they prayed, there they are praying again, and said, "Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, show which one of these two thou hast chosen to occupy this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place."
[time=1351] And they drew lots for them, and the lot fell to Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.
[time=1362] So there you have chapter one, they did what they were told, they stayed, they took care of some business, as it was foretold by David.
[time=1371] Matthias is now added to the twelve, and here we come this morning to the second chapter of the book of Acts, and what is without question, without doubt?
[time=1381] The turning point in the history of God's kingdom.
[time=1384] What you will see here, beginning to unfold, this morning is a new phase of his redemptive plan.
[time=1390] Again, remember the first phase, the first phase of his redemptive plan didn't go so well.
[time=1396] He had given opportunity to, he had laid out the plan for a certain group of people, the nation of who?
[time=1403] Nation of Israel.
[time=1405] He had given them the opportunity to be his distinct, to be his God-honoring group of people who would make a difference in the then-known world.
[time=1414] And as we watched the people of Israel all through the Old Testament, we see that they were anything but faithful, they were anything but distinct, they were anything but God-honoring, in terms of their consistent patterns.
[time=1425] So he comes to the end of the Old Testament, and here at the birth of this new age, here at the birth of this new covenant, he says, you know what, we've got a second phase.
[time=1435] And here it begins to be unfolded.
[time=1437] Here we see the birth people of the church.
[time=1441] Here we see the birth of the instrument, the agent that he chose to use to reach the then-known world, and it's the same agent, it's the same tool that he chooses to use today.
[time=1451] And this is where it all began.
[time=1454] Chapter two, you'll see, stands in contrast in some ways to chapter one.
[time=1458] In chapter one, the apostles were to wait for the coming of the Holy Spirit.
[time=1462] In chapter two, he comes.
[time=1463] In chapter one, the apostles were equipped.
[time=1466] In chapter two, they are empowered.
[time=1468] In chapter one, they were held back.
[time=1470] In chapter two, they are sent out.
[time=1472] In chapter one, the Savior ascended in chapter two, the Spirit descends.
[time=1477] The promises of the Lord given in chapter one come to be realized as these early believers.
[time=1483] Gathered in the upper room, received a long-awaited promise from the Father.
[time=1488] And again, just to remind us of this promise that had been made, turn with me back to John chapter 14.
[time=1495] Turn back in your Bible to John, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, fourth book of the New Testament, John chapter 14, just before you get to the book of Acts.
[time=1507] On the night before, all right, do you remember back?
[time=1510] This would have been just a few months prior.
[time=1513] If that, on the night before he was crucified, Jesus reassures the disciples that another helper is coming.
[time=1521] And we see it there in John chapter 14, pick it up there in verse 16.
[time=1526] It says there, Jesus speaking, and I will ask the Father, and he will give you another helper that he may be with you forever.
[time=1536] That is the spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive because it does not behold him or know him.
[time=1544] But you know him because he abides with you and will be in you.
[time=1550] Key phrase, will be in you.
[time=1553] So far they had only seen the external.
[time=1556] So far they had only seen the external power of the Holy Spirit, but soon they would experience his presence internally.
[time=1562] For he, the very spirit of God, it said there in John 14 would be in them.
[time=1567] So they knew because, and that was only one passage, we could have gone back to six or seven others, where he promises them this helper.
[time=1574] So they knew what was going to happen.
[time=1577] They knew that.
[time=1578] What they didn't know was they didn't know when, and they didn't know how.
[time=1583] And you know what, even if you had told them, in light of what we're about to read and see, even if you had told them, they wouldn't have believed you.
[time=1591] That is amazing.
[time=1593] It catches them by surprise on a significant day at that.
[time=1597] A significant day of the Jewish calendar.
[time=1600] Look with me, chapter two, verse one, back in Acts, chapter two, verse one.
[time=1606] It says, "And when the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place."
[time=1614] Interesting now, again, and I hope you just sense the way God orchestrates this thing.
[time=1620] Pentecost, all right?
[time=1621] If you want to write this down, you can.
[time=1622] The day of Pentecost, Pentecost means 50th.
[time=1625] Pentecost means 50th.
[time=1627] The day of Pentecost was celebrated 50 days after the presentation of the first harvested sheaf of the barley harvest.
[time=1634] It was also known as the day of first fruits.
[time=1638] Interesting.
[time=1640] The day of first fruits, because it was the day when the first fruits of the wheat harvest were presented ceremoniously to God.
[time=1650] And this is, as you see this unfold, this is classic God timing.
[time=1656] This is classic God planning.
[time=1660] Jews from every nation had come to town to celebrate the harvest, and He chooses that day to birth the church and initiate what would be a worldwide spiritual harvest.
[time=1674] All preparations had been made.
[time=1676] The day was at hand.
[time=1677] The small band of apostles and other believers were unified and together, and then it happened.
[time=1683] Then it happened, the helper arrives, the spirit comes and everything, people.
[time=1689] Everything is different from here on out.
[time=1693] Was there proof?
[time=1695] Was there proof of this powerful presence?
[time=1698] Absolutely.
[time=1699] Absolutely there was proof.
[time=1701] We're going to see several things this morning.
[time=1703] The first of all is we see right here at the beginning of chapter two that there was audible evidence.
[time=1708] There was audible evidence.
[time=1711] Let's look at verse two.
[time=1713] And suddenly it says, suddenly there came from heaven a noise like violent rushing wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.
[time=1724] Stop right there.
[time=1725] Luke says suddenly there was a noise.
[time=1729] Unlike the arrival of a hurricane, unlike the arrival of a tornado, which are forecasted and anticipated, this noise came if we're going to stay along the lines of natural disasters.
[time=1740] This thing came like an earthquake.
[time=1743] And again, let me tell you, as one who was experienced and lived through many, not the least of which was the 7.2 back on January 17, 1994 at 4.30 a.m.
[time=1755] Don't think I'll ever forget that.
[time=1757] They come quick because I'm here to tell you, at 4.29 and 58 seconds that morning I was sound asleep on my bed.
[time=1766] My wife was sick. She was out on the couch by her choice, not mine.
[time=1771] She wanted to let me sleep being the godly woman that she is.
[time=1775] So I'm in that bed by myself, and at 4.28 and 50, 4.29 and 58 seconds, I'll tell you I'm sound asleep.
[time=1782] At 4.30, like that, two bookcases, Florida ceiling bookcases that were at 4.29 and 58 seconds, 5 feet away from me on both sides were on top of my head.
[time=1795] Books emptied on top of me, bookcases on top of my bed, on top of me like that, it came.
[time=1804] Luke says it came from heaven.
[time=1807] In other words, it was no earthly man-made sound.
[time=1810] It was a noise, it says like a violent rushing wind.
[time=1814] Now remember, it wasn't, think this through, it wasn't the wind, but it sounded like the wind.
[time=1822] That was their experience. It sounded like the rushing of the wind.
[time=1827] Try to imagine what, I mean the earthquake thing gives me the idea of the suddenness.
[time=1833] Trying to imagine something though that would correlate with the sound in that room.
[time=1838] And I read somewhere this last week, imagine this, just imagine kids, check this out.
[time=1843] Kids, try and just imagine this, moms and dads, older folks as well.
[time=1847] Imagine in your living room, you and several people gathered, and imagine what it would be like.
[time=1854] If in that room, there was the sound of a 747 at takeoff.
[time=1861] Just try to mentally picture that for a moment.
[time=1863] The sound of the violent rushing wind, imagine the turbulence and people's hair standing on it, and imagine window panes shattering.
[time=1870] Imagine the destruction and the unbearable noise in a room with a 747 at takeoff.
[time=1875] That sound filling your living room.
[time=1879] Amazing.
[time=1881] But it wasn't just audible, no.
[time=1884] They saw something as well.
[time=1886] There was audible evidence in number two, there was visible evidence.
[time=1889] Look at verse three.
[time=1892] And there appeared to them tongues as of fire, as of, tongues as of fire,
[time=1898] distributing themselves, and they, the tongues, rested on each one of them.
[time=1904] In the midst of this supernatural experience to their amazement, fire-like objects, resembling tongues, settled on each of them.
[time=1914] They see this clearly.
[time=1916] Now again, it's important to note, they weren't, they weren't literal tongues of fire.
[time=1922] Any more than the noise of the wind was really the wind moving through.
[time=1928] It was a very symbolic picture though, in that, listen now, the Holy Spirit.
[time=1933] The Holy Spirit in places like Ezekiel 37, you can write that down.
[time=1940] The Holy Spirit is often described as wind.
[time=1945] And soon, as far as the flaming tongues go, soon their own tongues would be on fire, if you will.
[time=1952] Soon their own tongues would be heated up as they would begin to proclaim.
[time=1957] In supernatural and amazing ways, the life-giving truth of God.
[time=1962] Soon things would begin to happen.
[time=1965] The evidence of a powerful presence was both audible and visible, and thirdly, there was even now oral evidence.
[time=1972] Oral evidence, look at verse 4.
[time=1975] And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit was giving them utterance.
[time=1985] The Spirit descends now on them.
[time=1989] They are filled with the Spirit, it says, and they begin to speak, as it says there in the text, in other tongues.
[time=1996] In the Greek, this literally means speaking languages previously unknown to the speaker.
[time=2003] Please hear that.
[time=2005] These other tongues, when you look at that literally, it is the speaking of previously unknown languages.
[time=2018] Imagine, imagine the shock.
[time=2023] Imagine the shock.
[time=2025] Imagine yourself in that room and as the Spirit descends, and as the noise comes through and as the Spirit fills you all of a sudden,
[time=2033] people are speaking languages never before known to them.
[time=2037] Clearly, fluently, we'll see in just a moment.
[time=2042] Previously unknown to the speaker, and not just languages, even other dialects.
[time=2047] One commentator said, "In this way, the newborn church makes its first infant cry, joyously proclaiming the Gospel of Christ in words the whole world could understand."
[time=2061] And that's what the gift of tongues was all about.
[time=2065] It was the Spirit of God coming upon normal, everyday people whose hearts were open, who got it appointed to take the Gospel to the then-known world,
[time=2074] and to take the Gospel to the then-known world, they had to speak the then-known world's language.
[time=2080] And so they got it.
[time=2082] I was having fun this last week, just toying around in my mind.
[time=2086] Sometimes I do this.
[time=2088] I get a little off, but I was just kind of laughing in my office thinking, you know, I wonder if they...
[time=2094] I wonder if when they opened their mouth and the language came out, you wonder if they kind of got the idea that that's where they'd be going.
[time=2102] And I was kind of just in my mind's eye having fun with it, thinking about the apostles going home that night with Peter saying, "Hey, what's Barth all of you so excited about?" and somebody saying, "Well, he's speaking Hawaiian."
[time=2113] You know, and why? And why? Why is Philip so bummed out while he starts speaking Siberian?
[time=2119] Well, the miraculous, miraculous happenings. Watch this now.
[time=2125] The miraculous happenings that took place in this room spill out into the streets below.
[time=2133] And our passage will tell us here shortly that multitudes, translated literally thousands,
[time=2141] come to find out what has transpired as the 120 followers of Christ emerge speaking more languages than the United Nations.
[time=2149] Luke records for us the response of the people, the multitudes come.
[time=2155] They got to find out what's the noise, what's the deal, what's the raucous, what's all these languages.
[time=2161] And Luke records for us their response.
[time=2164] And I want to just throw this out to you this morning as we go through and look at their responses and we'll do that shortly here.
[time=2170] I'll note, please note the similarity between the responses then and what were they responding to?
[time=2178] Well, they were responding to the truth. They were responding to the Spirit of God.
[time=2182] They were responding to the Kingdom of God going about its work.
[time=2186] Note the similarity between the response then and the response you and I see today.
[time=2192] Maybe your own response to the gospel today.
[time=2196] Maybe your own response to the truth when you come face to face with it or others that you know have come face to face with it.
[time=2202] You know what? It's not that different.
[time=2204] Take a look for yourself.
[time=2206] Verses 5 and 6, the first response we see is confusion.
[time=2210] Confusion, pick it up there in verse 5.
[time=2212] Now there were Jews living in Jerusalem.
[time=2215] Development from every nation under heaven.
[time=2219] And I can't let that go. I've got to just say that to you again.
[time=2222] Please note the timing of our God.
[time=2225] Because of Pentecost and because of those who had come, realize how many had come.
[time=2230] Realize again the perfect timing of this event.
[time=2233] It says there in verse 5, development from every nation under heaven.
[time=2239] Wherever the Jews had gone, whatever nation they had gone to, every one of them had come back.
[time=2244] Every nation was represented then, then known nation.
[time=2249] Back in Jerusalem.
[time=2251] And when this sound occurred, the multitude came together and were bewildered.
[time=2257] Because they were each one of, because they were each one hearing them speak in his own language.
[time=2269] Never before.
[time=2271] Ever before had their language been spoken so well outside their own border.
[time=2278] They were bewildered as they came face to face with the truth.
[time=2282] And their own dialect and their own tongue.
[time=2285] A complete and utter strangers who by appearance should have no business speaking that to us.
[time=2292] Happens with me all the time.
[time=2294] Maybe it happens with you as well.
[time=2297] Happens to me all the time. It might be in my office.
[time=2299] It might be in a golf cart. It might be in a restaurant.
[time=2302] The first time someone really hears the truth.
[time=2307] The responses are similar.
[time=2311] I get bewildered, confused looks across the table.
[time=2316] But say in essence, you've got to be kidding me.
[time=2324] What?
[time=2326] Really?
[time=2328] I mean you really think that, Kelly.
[time=2330] I mean you're telling me that's true?
[time=2333] Come on.
[time=2335] Confused.
[time=2339] And then here's what happens so many times.
[time=2341] So many times as more and more truth gets discussed as more and more opportunity is given for them to come face to face with who they are and who God is.
[time=2349] So many times the truth turns to amazement.
[time=2353] And that is exactly what happens here in Acts chapter 2.
[time=2357] Their confusion turns to amazement.
[time=2360] Look at verse 7.
[time=2362] And they were amazed.
[time=2365] They were amazed and marveled saying why?
[time=2369] Are not all these who are speaking Galileans?
[time=2373] Stop right there.
[time=2374] The translation in the Greek would read literally like this.
[time=2377] They kept on being amazed, present tense.
[time=2380] In other words, as they listened, their head shook and their mouths dropped.
[time=2385] This was too much.
[time=2387] Backwoods Galileans.
[time=2389] Which I don't know if you realize that.
[time=2391] That's how a Galilean would be viewed.
[time=2395] Galileans, this group of 120 basically, by and large, the makeup of that group, they would be viewed as kind of backwoods.
[time=2403] Hillbilly kind of way out there, usually butchering their own language kind of people.
[time=2410] And so here are the nations of the world amazed that these backwoods Galileans
[time=2416] were mastering the world's dialects.
[time=2419] They were absolutely amazed.
[time=2422] They were confused.
[time=2424] They were amazed.
[time=2426] And then as it is often the case, in my own experiences, and I'm sure many of yours, the confusion and the amazement then turns to curiosity.
[time=2437] That's right.
[time=2439] Questions begin to be asked.
[time=2442] Curiosity.
[time=2443] You look at verses 8 to 12.
[time=2445] And how is it, again, the multitudes?
[time=2447] And how is it that we hear each, that we each hear them in our own language to which we were born?
[time=2454] Parthians and Medes and Elomites and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontius and Asia,
[time=2461] Phrygia and Pamphilia, Egypt and the districts of Libya around Cyrene and visitors from Rome,
[time=2467] both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabs.
[time=2471] All of them.
[time=2473] We hear them in our own tongues speaking, watch this, speaking the mighty deeds of God.
[time=2483] And they continued in amazement and great perplexity, saying to one another, "What does this mean?"
[time=2493] Their curiosity is peaked as they sense a supernatural change in this small band of Christ followers.
[time=2499] A change that extended far past, please get this.
[time=2504] A change that extended far past their newfound ability to converse multilingual.
[time=2510] No, the change they sensed was not just in what they said but how they said it.
[time=2517] I was thinking about this this week and again the history books and the text and further study would bring creams to this.
[time=2524] The multitudes, people, don't miss this.
[time=2527] The multitudes that come down the street to find out what's going on.
[time=2532] These multitudes from Jerusalem, many of them, yes, visitors from other nations, many of them though, Jerusalem is home for them.
[time=2541] And they knew, they knew who this small band of people were.
[time=2545] They were familiar with this group.
[time=2547] They knew what they had been through. They knew where they were residing.
[time=2550] They were very familiar with their plight that they had just lost their lord and master and teacher.
[time=2558] They'd been around, they'd seen them, there was a history in other words.
[time=2562] And a few hours before the multitudes were very aware of the fact that they were frightened mice,
[time=2570] huddling and hiding in some upper room.
[time=2574] And now they weren't frightened mice huddling and hiding in some upper room.
[time=2579] No, now they were lions.
[time=2582] Now there was a boldness.
[time=2584] They were roaring out the mighty deeds of God.
[time=2590] What a transformation. What a switch.
[time=2594] It gets me thinking, what much that have been like to be and is there some kind of application for you and for me today?
[time=2605] Frightened mice hiding in a room, huddled together, fearful, scared, scarred, uncertain, unsure,
[time=2613] intimidated, saying, no, no, no, no, no, not me, not me, there's no way I could.
[time=2619] Frightened mice huddling in an upper room to lie in a hearted, bold, courageous men and women of faith,
[time=2625] broadcasting, living out with the filling of the spirit, the mighty deeds of God.
[time=2630] Yeah, I think there's something there for you and I think there's something there for me.
[time=2635] I don't think it should be any different.
[time=2638] Every one of us in this room this morning has been given the same Holy Spirit, those of us that know Him.
[time=2644] And the confused, do you agree or disagree with this?
[time=2648] The confused, the amazed and the curious are still coming around to see what's going on with the Christ followers.
[time=2656] Agreed, agreed.
[time=2660] And the potential, the potential that resides in every one of you that know Him today as Lord,
[time=2666] that have given your heart and life to Him, those who have crossed over that line of faith and committed themselves to Him, the potential is there to be lion-hearted, people loving,
[time=2677] Christ proclaiming spirit-filled witnesses every day of your life in whatever situations
[time=2685] and whatever circumstance this God has put you in.
[time=2688] And we don't need another Pentecost to pursue that.
[time=2692] No, we need to pray as Paul prayed.
[time=2694] Write this down Ephesians 3, 16.
[time=2697] We need to pray as Paul prayed that He would grant you, here's what it says in that passage, that He would grant you according to the riches of His glory to be strengthened with power
[time=2708] through His Spirit in the inner man.
[time=2711] And when you know Him, you can pray that way to Him.
[time=2716] Ask yourself this morning.
[time=2719] I mean it, all of you.
[time=2722] Kids, kids, students, moms, dads, adults.
[time=2729] If you know Him this morning, when was the last time you prayed, "Oh God today, allow me to be thoroughly removed?"
[time=2736] God today with my friends, God today at my job, God today as I go to school, God today with my family,
[time=2743] God today in whatever situation you might have for me, God, please, I beg of you, allow me to be thoroughly and completely removed, and oh God, please fill me with your Holy Spirit.
[time=2755] Fill me with your Holy Spirit to do and to think and to speak and to live in the power of your Holy Spirit,
[time=2762] sensitive to your Holy Spirit.
[time=2767] That should be your prayer and that should be my prayer more and more often, probably much more frequently than it is.
[time=2776] Well, just as it is today, it was then as well.
[time=2783] So many were confused and so many got amazed and even more got curious, but some,
[time=2790] some chose denial.
[time=2792] And you see it happening in our world and in your life and we see it happening here in this passage as well.
[time=2798] Some chose denial.
[time=2801] Look at verse 13.
[time=2805] But others, others were mocking and saying they are full of sweet wine.
[time=2813] Others were mocking and saying that they were full of sweet wine in light of the Spirit's demonstration,
[time=2819] many that they believed.
[time=2821] We'll see that a little bit later in our study.
[time=2824] In light of the Spirit's demonstration, that day many believed giving their lives to Christ.
[time=2829] Others, though, chose foolishly to make an attempt to explain it all away.
[time=2835] And their drunk was the best they could come up with.
[time=2841] The drunk is the best that they could offer, as if getting wasted would help someone speak
[time=2848] with perfect inflection of previously unlearned language.
[time=2855] Doesn't make any sense, does it?
[time=2858] But as we've said before in this room, hard hearts never do.
[time=2864] They don't make any sense.
[time=2867] They don't think clearly.
[time=2869] Their eyes are blinded and today it's no different.
[time=2872] Someone may say to you, someone probably has said to you.
[time=2877] You'll see this God stuff, this Christianity thing, it's just a phase.
[time=2886] Just a phase.
[time=2888] It's just what are they saying?
[time=2890] They're saying it's just sweet wine.
[time=2892] You're drunk.
[time=2893] You're whacked.
[time=2895] You'll come down to earth sooner or later.
[time=2897] Reality hits, you'll wake up.
[time=2900] But the fact is, and if you know him this morning, if you live in relationship with him this morning,
[time=2906] you know this is true.
[time=2907] The fact is, when a lost sinful heart gets supernaturally transformed, it is the work of the sweet spirit and not of sweet wine.
[time=2916] And it's not a phase, it's a new way of life.
[time=2919] In reality, the challenges of life when they hit doesn't shake it, it strengthens it.
[time=2925] It may stretch it, but true genuine faith is grown and solidified through tough times.
[time=2933] And that is people exactly.
[time=2936] That is exactly what we're going to have the privilege of seeing as we continue to study this great book.
[time=2942] You are going to see people whose faith was stretched, whose circumstances were dismal and scary,
[time=2950] but who remained faithful, and they were grown and they were matured and they were empowered because of their willingness to stay that course.
[time=2958] Normal, frail, scared people going about changing the then-known world as they opened their hearts to the spirit,
[time=2969] as they gave their love radically to each other.
[time=2975] And as they offered hope to a dying world, well, some questions to ask before we get out of here this morning.
[time=2986] And I hope, I hope you'll ask them, please, kids, students, moms, dads, adults, please ask yourself these questions.
[time=2999] First thing I want to run by is this. Follow me here now.
[time=3004] The previously unknown languages that they were now able to speak, this work of the spirit and the unique tongue that they now possess the ability to exercise and communicate.
[time=3019] It gave them, because of the uniqueness of that language, it gave that individual a unique door into that group of people.
[time=3027] Okay? So it's a little different today, I realize we're not talking about languages so much, but the same application can be made, and I want to ask you this this morning.
[time=3039] Who's the unique group, or who's the unique individual in your life, that the Holy Spirit has empowered you to reach?
[time=3053] If you know him this morning, the Holy Spirit has taken residence in your heart, and in that comes power, in that comes the ability for you.
[time=3061] Whoever you are, you see, you have unique windows, you have unique platforms, you have unique opportunities to reach people, talk to people, live your life with people.
[time=3071] I have no shot at, but you do, and I do with my unique window of people.
[time=3080] So who is that? And I'm asking you, who is that? I'm going to ask you this morning, I asked our folks on Wednesday nights.
[time=3087] And by the way, we're having a great time on Wednesday nights, 645, common ground.
[time=3093] It's been a sweet, sweet time, and I ask those folks Wednesday night, and I will ask you again this morning.
[time=3098] To even this morning right now, write those names down, to write down the names of 2 or 3 individuals that you know God has placed in your life,
[time=3105] and they represent what is kind of a unique opportunity for you. You can reach them, you can love them, you can come alongside them.
[time=3113] I can't. Your wife can't, your husband can't, your best friend, it's just you.
[time=3118] You've got to put some people in your scope.
[time=3122] And I would invite you this morning to write those down, maybe somewhere in your Bible, maybe somewhere in a notebook that you'll see again and again.
[time=3130] And would you be willing, as I asked the folks Wednesday night to, would you be willing to pray for them?
[time=3135] Would you be willing to pray for courage and boldness and love in your own heart?
[time=3139] And would you be willing to pray for those names that you write down that they would be receptive?
[time=3143] As we continue to watch these people proclaiming and living out life-giving truth, and as we hopefully, as a family,
[time=3151] are more encouraged and willing to live out life-giving truth.
[time=3155] Might you see in their life?
[time=3158] Might I see in the names that I wrote down Wednesday night?
[time=3162] Might we see people come to know Christ?
[time=3166] Might we see life change, eternity's altered because of the truth of God?
[time=3175] Second thing I want you to see, second question, how prepared or equipped are you to answer the questions,
[time=3183] or engage in dialogue with the confused, amazed, and curious?
[time=3192] How ready are you to answer the questions, or engage in dialogue with the confused, amazed, and curious?
[time=3203] And I want to be careful how I ask that, but I want to ask it, see, because there are no, you can't know it all.
[time=3208] I'm not suggesting that there's a class you can take, or a course you can get into, or some study you can go through.
[time=3213] That gives you all the answers, and now you are the perfect and arrived Bible answer man woman student or child.
[time=3220] No, what I'm saying is this.
[time=3223] 1 Peter 3 says, "Be ready to make a defense.
[time=3226] Be able, from your heart, to articulate that which you have experienced with your God.
[time=3232] Be willing and ready to voice the hope that is within you."
[time=3238] And so at a very practical level, I just want to ask you, have you taken contagious Christianity, for example?
[time=3247] A new class begins next week.
[time=3249] There's information in sign-up brochures available at the information desk.
[time=3252] Contagious Christianity.
[time=3254] It is a wonderful opportunity for all of you, students, adults, moms, dads, grandmas, grandpas, anybody can take contagious.
[time=3261] And in contagious you learn how to better articulate, understand, and express your faith in the context of loving relationships.
[time=3269] How prepared are you?
[time=3271] How far down the road have you gone?
[time=3274] How much effort have you given to being as prepared and ready and as encouraged to articulate and share and offer the hope that is within you?
[time=3288] Sunday mornings, Wednesday nights.
[time=3292] And I realize different people learn and take in different ways.
[time=3297] But I hope, and if I haven't said this before, I'll say it to you now, and then we're going to close.
[time=3303] But I certainly hope that you understand that I in no way desire this time right here to be some kind of lecture format.
[time=3311] I mean, I don't want it to be like a classroom, I want it to be, I mean, in one sense, I don't want it to be like a classroom.
[time=3317] In one sense, I want it to be like a dialogue.
[time=3319] I want it to be us together in this room, looking at dialoguing about considering the truth of God.
[time=3325] And I want there to be, you know, the opportunity for us to kind of do that together at the same time, though, the fact of the matter is, it is the word of God.
[time=3331] It is truth.
[time=3332] It is life-giving, eternity, altering truth, and you've got to know it.
[time=3336] And I've got to know it, and we've got to understand it, so what are you doing on Sunday mornings?
[time=3341] To learn.
[time=3343] You bring a notebook.
[time=3345] I mean, do you bring something to write with?
[time=3347] I mean, do you pick up a tape?
[time=3348] I mean, what are you doing?
[time=3349] To allow this to be more than just, you know, 45 minutes with me?
[time=3355] Because that's not what it is.
[time=3357] It's a chance for us to learn, and it's a chance for us to be grown.
[time=3360] It's a chance for you and your faith, as small or big as it might be, to be established.
[time=3365] So how ready, and how prepared.
[time=3370] And one last thing, I'll save it for next week, and I will get to it next week, I promise.
[time=3375] There is, in this passage we've seen this morning, obviously, the introduction to this whole idea of tongues, speaking in tongues.
[time=3383] And so what we'll do next week is just, I want to share with you some things about tongues, how we view that, you know, here at this church, what our understanding of scripture is.
[time=3394] Most importantly, on that issue, and I'll share a little bit of that with you next week.
[time=3399] Let me just say this before we, before I close.
[time=3404] If you, if you sense, I don't know, my wife told me this morning I seemed a bit keyed up.
[time=3413] And so I just wanted to, I just, and I feel a bit keyed up, so, you know, she was right.
[time=3421] I'm keyed up about this.
[time=3426] I am so fired up in my soul, and I am so wondering what God's going to do with this study, and you and me and this family.
[time=3435] Please understand.
[time=3437] People, what we study here and what we see here is the beginning of the church, it's the growth of the gospel.
[time=3442] And yes, it happened 2,000 years ago, but please see, as the days and as the weeks progress.
[time=3449] I hope that you will begin to see more and more so what this place could be like, what God could do through this family, in this city, in this community, if what he has is a group of people, as devoted, as committed, as given, as open to the power of the Holy Spirit,
[time=3470] and that which it can do through us.
[time=3473] I hope that you begin to sense, as I have in these recent weeks already started the sense in my own life,
[time=3480] the potential and the possibility that this study could bring.
[time=3485] And so...
[time=3487] ...through that together, let me ask you to stand, if you would.
