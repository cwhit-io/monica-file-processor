[time=0] (upbeat music) - Welcome to the Sunday Morning Worship Service
[time=12] of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=14] Thank you for joining us.
[time=15] We trust that the music and message from God's word will help you in your Christian walk.
[time=20] Now let's join our service.
[time=22] [MUSIC - 53 seconds]
[time=84] As we worship you, as we worship you, as we worship you.
[time=105] As we worship you, as we worship you.
[time=115] Hi, I'm Kelly Pastor here at Blackhawk, and we wanted to take just a couple of minutes and share with you some things that are going on here at Blackhawk.
[time=130] We realize that there are literally thousands of you in our viewing area that tune into the Bible hour.
[time=136] And we want to do our best to make sure that you're aware of some opportunities that we feel like might be, hopefully would be of interest to you.
[time=143] One of those is this, we want to make sure you know that every Monday night right here on our campus, actually over on our north campus, in the room that we call the Asylum, it's where students and kids meet, thus the name the Asylum.
[time=157] We want to make sure you know that every first Monday night of the month, we have a thing we call Coffee Q&A.
[time=163] And we do the Coffee Q&A's for one reason and one reason only.
[time=167] It's a time for people who are new to our church, people who are considering our church, people who want to know more about what's going on at Blackhawk.
[time=175] Now, and even folks who have been here for 20 years, we come together on those first Monday nights, and we have some coffee, and there's some food, and we Q&A.
[time=184] People ask questions about our ministry, it gives us a chance to get to know those people, and it's a really nice time, and we want to just make sure that you knew about it, and would love for you to feel free anytime to come and join us for Coffee Q&A, each first Monday night of the month at 7 o'clock on our north campus.
[time=202] Also, on the other Monday nights of the month, every Monday night, except that first Monday night of the month, for those in the age range of 25 to 35, there's a new ministry that has started here at Blackhawk, and it's called the Quest.
[time=217] And the Quest is basically a ministry that's being offered to kind of single adults. Some are still in school, some already have their jobs, but they're looking for a place to connect.
[time=229] A place where they can come and be with those who are kind of in that same stage of life, study God's Word, have some worship together, have a good time together, talk about things that matter in life, and that ministry is just growing, and they're having a great time, and we'd love for you to know about that.
[time=248] The Quest, 25 to 35 Monday nights over on our north campus in the asylum, and the other thing I want to tell you about is this, and we've mentioned this in previous weeks, but we're having such a great time with this thing, I just wanted to mention it to you again.
[time=263] On Wednesday nights, we have started a new worship service called Common Ground. Our Common Ground worship service begins at 645 on Wednesday nights. It's preceded by a dinner.
[time=276] We serve dinner over here now on Wednesdays at 530 on our south campus down in the Commons, and I think it cost a couple of dollars for adults, maybe $1.50 for kids, and we've got a great, great group of folks coming and having dinner at 530, and then worship service
[time=292] at 645. It's the same message that our folks here on Sunday mornings, the worship is by and large the same, and we're just seeing a whole bunch of people come, many nude or church.
[time=304] Some folks who do other things on Sundays, be it a job or another church, but it's a great opportunity midweek to come and get fed the Word of God, have a sweet time in worship, and get to know some new people.
[time=317] So we'd love to have you join us. Tell some friends, tell some people at your work, bring someone from your family, but Wednesday nights, Common Ground, 645, we're thankful for what we see God doing in that service.
[time=329] We're thankful for what He continues to do in our church, and we wanted to just let you know about some of these things. Hopefully, one of them, or all of them, might meet a need in your life. We'd love to see you and meet you soon.
[time=347] [MUSIC]
[time=374] What I like most about the student ministries is I've gained a lot of opportunities to go on mission trips, and I've learned a lot about reaching out to the people in my school and with the people that I live with.
[time=388] It's a time for me halfway through the week to just get away and forget about what's going on in school and what's going on with friends. I just have time as me and God, just singing and praising His name, and I just tell them what I'm thankful for.
[time=405] When a student walks through that door, we want them to know, first of all, that they are loved, and we want to be able to provide an opportunity for kids to be heard. Sometimes students just need someone to listen to them because they have a problem or a concern, and they just need someone to be there to listen to them.
[time=427] Other students may have a particular problem or an issue they need some counseling on, and we can provide that to them, and through our living relationships, we can help them understand what Biblical truth to apply to those particular problems in their life.
[time=441] 1 Kings 858 says, "May He turn our hearts to Him to walk in all His ways, and at turn point in the student ministries we desire for this to be a place where students come and see what Jesus is like, and we try to show them grace, and we try to learn grace ourself. Students teach us a lot as well.
[time=463] As we look to the future and the vision what we have for the student ministry, and it would be a place where students would come and learn to love Jesus, learn to share Jesus with their friends, so that they can grow up to be the leaders in the church and see what God would do through their lives.
[time=482] So wherever they go to school and whatever part of the city they live in, we want this to be a place that students feel like they can come here and get some of those questions answered, and check out God in a safe place.
[time=512] [MUSIC]
[time=525] It's true. It's true. Our Lord has risen and appeared to us. He was just here, but now He's...
[time=532] The Lord is risen indeed. Didn't our hearts burn within us while He talked with us on the road and opened the scriptures to us, and yet we didn't recognize Him until He broke the bread?
[time=547] He had spoken many times about Himself, being the bread of life, and that His body must be broken just as the prophets foretold.
[time=556] Yes, the prophets. Our Lord was right when He called us foolish and slow of heart, not to have believed all that the prophets had written.
[time=563] I feel foolish. As a boy in those temple courts, I memorize the promises of a Messiah, and now, today with our own eyes, we have seen what was prophesied centuries ago.
[time=575] Of course, being a girl, I couldn't study in a temple. I had to learn all the prophecies second and third hand.
[time=580] There are hundreds of prophecies, for instance. The prophet Micah revealed that he would be born in Bethlehem.
[time=587] Isaiah said that he would be from Galilee. Hosea said that he would come out of Egypt. Years ago, the teachers of the law were confused by this apparent contradiction, and yet our Lord was born in Bethlehem.
[time=600] He escaped into Egypt during Herod's slaughter of the infants, which was also foretold, and then returned to settle in Galilee.
[time=608] It all makes perfect sense now. That would have been confusing. Even more confusing was that Jeremiah spoke of a mighty king.
[time=618] The days are coming, declares the Lord. When I will raise up to David, a righteous branch, a king, who will reign wisely and do what is just and right in the land.
[time=630] In his days Judah will be saved, and Israel will live in safety. And this is the name by which he will be called the Lord, our righteousness.
[time=639] The Psalmist also spoke of a high priest. So that's why the temple leaders refused to accept his lordship. He didn't act like a king.
[time=648] Perhaps. But there are so many other prophecies that could only refer to our Lord.
[time=654] The prophet Isaiah spoke of his miracles. Then will the eyes of the blind be open, and the ears of the deaf unstopped, then will the lame leap like a deer.
[time=665] And the weather prophet has done those things. And just this past week, prophecy upon prophecy has been fulfilled.
[time=670] When he entered Jerusalem, the prophecy of Zechariah was fulfilled before our very eyes. Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion.
[time=677] And shout, daughter of Jerusalem, see your king comes to you, righteous in having salvation, gentle, and riding on a donkey on a cult, the full of a donkey.
[time=688] The psalmist prophesied that children and infants would praise him, just as they did when he entered the city.
[time=693] And didn't our Lord say that even his betrayal had been foretold by the prophets?
[time=697] Yes, and to the exact amount given the betrayer. The prophet Zechariah foretold that 30 pieces of silver would be the price.
[time=705] He prophesied also that the betrayer would return the money. He even foretold that the betrayer would throw the money on the temple floor, and that the 30 pieces would buy a potter's field.
[time=716] It's also convincing. So why couldn't the priests and teachers of the law see that he was indeed the promised Messiah?
[time=723] Who are we to judge? Even we didn't fully believe that he was the promised Messiah.
[time=729] True, but at least we didn't crucify him. No. And yet even that was clearly foretold.
[time=736] The prophet Isaiah spoke of Jesus being beaten, scurred, spat upon, and crucified with thieves.
[time=743] The psalmist wrote of his clothing being gambled over and of him being given vinegar to drink.
[time=748] The prophet Amos foretold the darkness that covered the land during the crucifixion.
[time=753] The psalmist even prophesied his exact words from the cross, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
[time=760] It all seems so clear now. Yes, but three days ago, even three hours ago, the events of this past week did not seem clear.
[time=770] When the stranger asked us what we were discussing on our walk to Emmaus, I asked him, "What are you the only one living in Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened these past three days?"
[time=780] And then I blurted out that Jesus of Nazareth was a prophet, powerful in word indeed before God and all the people.
[time=792] We had hoped he would be the one to redeem Israel.
[time=796] When the women told us of a vision of angels who said that Jesus was alive, even then we couldn't believe that he really was alive.
[time=803] But he is alive. He's alive, Cleopus, just as he foretold. Yes, the Lord is risen indeed.
[time=810] But why are we standing here? We must tell the eleven and the others that just as the prophets foretold, the Messiah is alive.
[time=834] Jesus is alive, and there's what it's made of me, and it brings as we deny.
[time=845] Jesus went for heaven, and he's alive. He's alive, and he's beyond the land of me now.
[time=858] The virgin lives with me.
[time=862] The virgin lives with me, and we have perfect liberty.
[time=869] The land of God is risen. He's alive, he's alive.
[time=879] He's alive, he's alive. He's alive, he's alive.
[time=907] He's alive. He's beyond the hand of their God.
[time=914] The virgin lives with me. The virgin is broken, and we have perfect liberty.
[time=925] The land of God is risen, he's alive. He's alive. He's alive. He's alive.
[time=942] He's alive. He's alive. He's alive. He's alive. He's alive.
[time=970] The virgin lives with me. He's alive. He's alive. He's alive. He's alive.
[time=992] He's alive. He's alive. He's alive. He's alive. He's alive.
[time=1012] We'll open your Bibles this morning. If you would, if they're not already open,
[time=1020] go ahead and open them up to Acts chapter 2, because we are going to continue.
[time=1023] In the study of this great book, the book of Acts, the Acts of the Apostles, this morning, the first preacher, the first preacher, and the first message.
[time=1035] Just saying that to myself this past week, sitting there at my desk, it reminded me,
[time=1045] got me thinking back a few years to the whole idea of the first message, got me thinking about my very first message that I ever gave.
[time=1054] It was quite an experience with some aftershocks that were pretty interesting.
[time=1059] I was in college, and I was Bible major, and thinking about a future in ministry,
[time=1065] and one of the classes that you take in that Bible major is what they call sermon prep, and they teach you how to study, and they teach you how to put the message together, and they work with you on even the presentation, the whole thing.
[time=1077] It's an interesting class, and then you actually give sermons, messages right there in the class to the eight or nine or ten guys that were there,
[time=1086] which was sometimes an incredibly boring, dry, painful experience, or sometimes actually enjoyable depending upon how the guy was doing.
[time=1094] Well, at the end of the year, it was interesting, the guy, the professor that led the class, actually picked one of the students in the class to deliver a message to the entire student body
[time=1107] at chapel one day towards the end of the semester.
[time=1112] And so his name was Dewey Bertolini, and Dewey pulls me aside one day, and he says, Kelly, you did a great, great job on that message that you did from Ephesians 4,
[time=1123] and I'm going to ask you to be our representative in giving that message to the student body.
[time=1129] And boy, I bow fell apart.
[time=1132] All of a sudden, my whole body got tight, things were spinning.
[time=1136] I was really scared, and I said, okay, I'll do it.
[time=1139] And that kind of thing, I had about three weeks to get ready.
[time=1142] Well, for the entire three-week period, I just was determined to do my best with that one message I had done in class from Ephesians 4, and then it got to the last night before, and I was just coming, I'm done, I was so nervous, and I was so anxious, and I just kept telling myself, you're going to stink, they're not going to like it, all the kids, they're all going to fall asleep, you're going to get bad notes in the mail, and then we're going to eat with you at lunch anymore, you're just going to be horrible.
[time=1165] What am I going to do?
[time=1167] And so with my insecurity just bubbling over, I said to myself, I know what I'm going to do.
[time=1175] And I did, I went to my car, and I pulled from my cassette deck.
[time=1182] My favorite, Mrs. Beckett, Los Angeles Baptist College, became the Masters College.
[time=1189] Before Dr. MacArthur became the president, but I was still attending his church at the time, so I pulled my favorite John MacArthur tape out of the cassette player.
[time=1199] First Corinthians 9, talking about running the race with endurance and the wreath and the prize
[time=1207] and the whole thing, and I pulled that tape out and marched back to my dorm room, spent four hours transcribing, I just ripped them off completely.
[time=1217] Did the whole message, scrap my message, and wrote out an entire new message that was word for word.
[time=1225] John MacArthur's message on 1 Corinthians 9, I was feeling really good about myself.
[time=1230] I was going to, I was going to wow him, I was going to absolutely knock it out of the park, and now my secure, my whole security thing was squelched and I was fine.
[time=1239] So I've got this whole message, and I go and I deliver that whole message.
[time=1242] Next day in chapel, the whole thing, just boom, boom, boom.
[time=1246] People were walking out patting me on the back, slapping me, saying wow, I didn't know you had it in you.
[time=1254] And I was feeling, mmm, I was feeling good about myself, and I had people eat with me at lunch, and they were still talking about it a week later.
[time=1262] Well, it all came crashing down quick.
[time=1265] About a week and a half later, my buddy Scott and I are walking through the student center, and we see the Dean of Men, and he's got a smile on his face from ear to ear.
[time=1272] This is before the whole transition thing took place, and we said, "Hey, R.W., what are you smiling about?" He goes, "Oh, you guys, it's great." We just got word Dr. MacArthur's coming to speak in chapel next week.
[time=1284] I said, and I didn't put it together yet, I said, "That's great, that's great." And I remember even my friend Scott asking him, "Hey, what's he going to speak on?" And then he said, "First Timothy 2." And then when he said, "First Timothy 2," it clicked in my heart, and my mind, and I went, "Wow, that's good." So anyway, I was fine, so there we are.
[time=1302] That Monday comes, the place is packed, Scott and I are in the front row, because John was our pastor.
[time=1307] We're so, "Go, John, you're doing a good job, man, go get him." That's our pastor, right?
[time=1311] So John gets up there and says, "Hey, students, it's great to be here." As I was driving in this morning, I just felt the Spirit of God.
[time=1322] And as soon as he said, "I felt the Spirit of God," I just said, "Oh, Lord, no, no, no, no."
[time=1328] And off he went, "I just felt the Spirit of God prompting me to share with you this morning," pulls out his little pocket, New Testament, from the book of 1 Corinthians.
[time=1337] Open up the chapter 9, if you will.
[time=1340] And I'd never been in that situation where your heart just goes to the floor and it just gets stepped on and squished.
[time=1346] I was done.
[time=1347] So I sat there in the front row, felt the gaze of 800 students as he went through this
[time=1355] message, which was verbatim.
[time=1359] Verbatim.
[time=1362] They had just heard a week before.
[time=1364] They weren't slapping me on the back or patting me on the shoulder.
[time=1367] They were walking out that day going, "You are horrible." I mean, it was just horrible.
[time=1373] So anyway, first message.
[time=1375] And here in Acts, another teacher, another communicator, gets a chance to give his first
[time=1382] sermon.
[time=1383] This newly-birthed church age, it was literally the first message ever given.
[time=1390] And as you'll see, his went a little bit better than mine.
[time=1393] You see, his ignited a flame that would spread across continents and moved thousands toward the gospel of Christ.
[time=1400] His message, this passage we're about to dive into this morning, was born in power, powerfully delivered, and as you'll see, had a powerful result.
[time=1409] And it was spoken by.
[time=1411] It was delivered by who?
[time=1414] Acts chapter 2, verse 14.
[time=1416] Who is it?
[time=1418] Say his name a little bit louder.
[time=1420] Peter, first message ever given, born in power, delivered powerfully with powerful result,
[time=1427] but results given by, delivered by, none other than Peter.
[time=1432] Please don't miss the spiritual humor in this.
[time=1436] Please don't miss the irony.
[time=1437] Please don't miss the fact.
[time=1439] And again, we've pointed it out in recent weeks.
[time=1441] Don't miss, just in that simple truth, that Peter delivered it.
[time=1447] Don't miss the work of God in that man's life.
[time=1450] Look at what he did.
[time=1451] Go back, let's just be reminded.
[time=1453] Go back to Luke, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John.
[time=1456] Go back to Luke 22.
[time=1458] Peter, Peter of all people is the one who delivers this message.
[time=1464] Peter, who just weeks prior, finds himself, look at Luke 22.
[time=1471] Pick it up in verse, let's pick it up in verse 54.
[time=1476] Luke 22, verse 54.
[time=1478] And having arrested him, right there, says having arrested him, they led him away and
[time=1484] brought him to the house of the high priest.
[time=1486] This is Jesus now.
[time=1487] He's been arrested.
[time=1488] The whole crucifixion thing is about to happen, but Peter, verse 54.
[time=1492] Peter was following at a distance.
[time=1496] And after they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter was sitting among them and a certain servant girl, seeing him as he sat in the fire light and looking intently at him, said this man was with him too.
[time=1512] But he denied it, saying woman, I do not know him.
[time=1518] I don't know him.
[time=1519] I don't know what you're talking about.
[time=1520] I do not know him.
[time=1522] And a little later, verse 58, another saw him and said, you, you are one of them too.
[time=1527] But Peter said, man, in the vernacular of our day, dude, relax, I don't know who you're
[time=1535] talking about.
[time=1536] I do not understand what you are saying.
[time=1541] And later about an hour had passed, another man began to insist saying, certainly this man also was with him, for he is a Galilean too.
[time=1550] But Peter said, verse 60, man, I do not know what you are talking about.
[time=1556] And immediately while he was still speaking, what happened?
[time=1560] The rooster crows.
[time=1564] Peter, same guy.
[time=1567] Several months later, the most powerful message delivered in the then-known world.
[time=1577] And don't miss the application for you.
[time=1581] Don't miss the application.
[time=1583] Do you ever feel inadequate?
[time=1586] Do you ever feel as if you won't have the right words?
[time=1588] Do you ever feel as if someone more polished, more put together, should speak on his behalf?
[time=1595] Do you ever feel that insecurity that maybe you can't get the job done, that maybe you've been through too much, that too many mistakes have been made?
[time=1602] I mean, we're talking about Peter.
[time=1605] We're talking with a friend this week at lunch, Ted and I, we're sitting down talking at lunch and we're both cracking up in the booth talking about this because can you imagine?
[time=1612] I mean, if you know it all, the history here of Peter, can you imagine the disciples back
[time=1619] in Acts chapter 2 verse 14, where we are this morning, when Peter stood up, I mean, they're all going, oh my goodness, what's he gonna say?
[time=1628] This is Peter, the disciple with the foot-shaped mouth.
[time=1632] This is Peter, the guy who could never get it straight.
[time=1634] This is Peter who was always saying the wrong things at the wrong times, then he stands up and he opens his mouth.
[time=1643] God used him.
[time=1646] Don't miss the point.
[time=1647] Same guy, couple months later, most powerful message ever given to the then-known world.
[time=1652] What we'll see is that its power came from two things.
[time=1655] Its power came from two things.
[time=1657] Its composition, the composition of the message itself and its content.
[time=1661] Its composition, in other words, what it was made up of, what it consisted of and we see three very important elements that should mark any gospel message.
[time=1671] We see three very important elements in this message and it was, I believe, these important
[time=1677] elements that gave it its power and gave it its strength.
[time=1680] Number one, briefly, number one, it was simple.
[time=1684] Write that down.
[time=1685] This gospel proclamation, this message that he gave, it was simple.
[time=1691] Peter used words everyone could understand.
[time=1695] I will always remember the words of a good friend and mentor, a man who in essence discipled
[time=1701] me in ministry, his name's Tom Givens and he was and is the senior pastor of the church where we serve before we came here to Indiana and Tom was my sermon prep teacher and seminary
[time=1712] and Tom and I ministered together for the years that, you know, when I was out of seminary and before coming here and Tom would always tell me, Kelly Boy, he always called me Kelly Boy.
[time=1721] He'd say, Kelly Boy, don't ever forget, don't ever forget young man, keep the cookies on
[time=1727] the bottom shelf.
[time=1730] He would always remind me, keep the cookies on the bottom shelf.
[time=1735] And that doesn't mean you can't challenge people with your teaching, it doesn't mean you can't teach them new stuff, but if all you ever do is talk over their heads, guess what?
[time=1743] They won't reach, they can't find, they won't understand.
[time=1747] And sometimes I hear guys, even today, and they speak and they talk and they teach and it's as if someone's trying to be impressive and it's our commitment here and it was Peter's
[time=1758] commitment there, we're going to do our best to try and keep things simple, doctrinally pure, straightforward, biblical.
[time=1765] We're going to try and teach you and grow you and shape you spiritually.
[time=1769] But it's a good thing to keep in mind, my message, your message when you open your mouth, when you attempt to communicate truth, keep it simple, keep it forthright.
[time=1779] Number two, keep it biblical.
[time=1781] Second thing we see here in Peter's message in Acts chapter two is that it was biblical.
[time=1786] He didn't just give them a flowery story, he didn't just give them his own opinion, he gave them the truth.
[time=1794] He gave them the truth, he gave them the truth of Scripture.
[time=1798] He kept their minds focused on, he kept what was before them, biblical and sound and true.
[time=1804] And it's so very important that I would do the same thing and that you would do the same thing as you have opportunity to proclaim and share your message.
[time=1812] Why?
[time=1813] Well, because people can take issue with my stories.
[time=1818] People can debate my opinion, there's room for debate.
[time=1823] When what we make the issue, when we make the issue the truth, when we do our best to proclaim it, they may try or they may choose to try and meander their way around it or underneath it or over it, but truth is truth.
[time=1836] And in time they have to come face to face with it.
[time=1839] Thirdly, you'll see this message was Christ centered.
[time=1845] It was simple, it was biblical, and it was Christ centered.
[time=1851] Remember back in verse 12, what was the question that was asked and they continued the multitude did in amazement and great perplexity, saying to one another, "What does this mean?"
[time=1864] You see the multitudes asking that question gave Peter the opportunity to lovingly and boldly share with them the truth about Christ.
[time=1873] He gives them the truth about salvation.
[time=1875] He gives them the truth about the essence of salvation.
[time=1879] He gives them the truth about Christ.
[time=1880] He makes Christ the issue, and I don't want you to miss this because so many times in conversations that you have and so many times in conversations that I have, again and again, you get into salvation type faith depicting describing conversations and people want to
[time=1896] in that debate or dialogue make everything else under the sun the issue.
[time=1901] They want to talk to you and they want answers about the flood.
[time=1905] They debate and want to get answers about why bad things happen to good people.
[time=1910] They want to talk about creation and evolution.
[time=1913] They want to make what happens to babies when they die the issue.
[time=1917] They want to talk about where the manuscripts transcribed perfectly, what's Jonah really in the belly of a whale, and how about the whole election free will thing.
[time=1926] See so many times so many folks want to make so many different things the issue, and those things are issues, but those things are not the issue.
[time=1935] The issue that we have to proclaim and the issue that you have to keep at the forefront
[time=1941] of those conversations and those relationships, the issue is what have you done with the person
[time=1947] of Christ.
[time=1950] The issue is what have you done?
[time=1952] How have you responded to the substitutionary sacrificial death made by him on your behalf?
[time=1958] That is the question people have to answer.
[time=1963] Christ is the issue and Peter made him the issue.
[time=1968] In the broader scope we see what this message was comprised of.
[time=1971] What about the specifics though?
[time=1974] Let's look at its content.
[time=1976] Let's look at its specifics.
[time=1978] Smack, dab, right in the middle of the excitement and confusion caused by the miracle of the
[time=1984] languages Peter jumps in, and verses 14 to 18 Peter explains the miraculous.
[time=1991] These people had just seen something overwhelming.
[time=1993] They had just witnessed something that was truly supernatural, and so Peter, Peter says
[time=1999] in verse 14, read along with me, "But Peter, taking his stand with the eleven, raised his voice and declared to them men of Judea, and all you who live in Jerusalem, let this be
[time=2011] known to you and give heed to my words.
[time=2015] For these men are not drunk, as you suppose, for it is only the third hour of the day.
[time=2021] It was too early to be smashed.
[time=2025] They weren't drunk.
[time=2026] No, but, verse 16, "But this is what was spoken of through the prophet Joel.
[time=2034] And it shall be, as Joel said, and it shall be in the last days, God said, that I will pour forth of my spirit upon all mankind, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,
[time=2044] and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall see dreams.
[time=2048] Even upon my bond slaves, both men and women, I will in those days pour forth of my spirit, and they shall prophesy." Peter reminds them that what they're witnessing, what they've seen isn't some drunken charade.
[time=2062] It's the specific and exact fulfillment of a prophecy delivered by the prophet Joel over
[time=2068] 200 years earlier.
[time=2072] This Joel's word, these words, found in Scripture people, this prophecy over 200 years old is
[time=2080] what you have witnessed, and it says there in these last days, the last days, a phrase
[time=2087] we'll see often in this study, and a phrase you'll see in other places as well.
[time=2092] This phrase last days began, the last days began when Christ came for the very first time, and it will end when he reappears at his second coming as he comes to initiate
[time=2103] the Millennial Kingdom.
[time=2105] Chuck Swindall said this, Chuck Swindall in his commentary on the book of Acts said, "Sincere's earlier Joel had foreseen a time when God would pour out his spirit in a flood of grace and power.
[time=2118] This," Peter tells the crowd, "is what you are now witnessing.
[time=2122] Like an opening parenthesis, this pouring out of the spirit signified the beginning of the age of grace." And with a closing parenthesis, Joel's prophecy declared and described the end of this era as well, that cataclysmic and final judgment that will take place upon Christ's return.
[time=2141] Look at verse 19 and verse 20, "And I will grant wonders, and I will grant wonders in
[time=2148] the sky above, and signs on the earth beneath blood and fire and vapor of smoke, the sun
[time=2154] shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and glorious day
[time=2160] of the Lord shall come.
[time=2162] And it shall be that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved."
[time=2169] The Lord's return and the judgment that he'll bring will mark the end of the age of grace, what? Peter's point is, and it's important for us to note today, but in the period these
[time=2180] new believers were entering, the age which we now live in, everyone, as it says there in verse 21, "Much to the chagrin of the Jews," the message now is different, everyone, everyone
[time=2192] who calls on the name of the Lord, it says, "shall be saved." Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord, again Peter making him, making Christ, making
[time=2203] the Lord the issue. Peter tells them, "This is an alcohol-induced, it's God-induced and it's been in the works for hundreds of years, and now it has happened, and you have witnessed." Well, as he continues on, it gets interesting, it gets exciting, it gets insightful, and
[time=2222] he does such a great job of communicating truth.
[time=2225] As he goes on, Peter now begins to paint a picture, and it is a picture that will lead these question-asking, seeking Jews to the very Lord himself. He explains the miraculous
[time=2237] now, secondly he exalts the Lord. Peter exalts the Lord, look at it again at verse 22, Acts
[time=2244] chapter 2, very first part of verse 22, "Men of Israel," he says, "listen to these words
[time=2254] with urgency and intensity," like a mother trying to get her children's attention, like
[time=2260] a coach yelling to a team, "with urgency and intensity," he says, "Hey, listen, please
[time=2267] don't miss this," and then with stunning clarity, especially because it was Peter, with stunning
[time=2276] clarity and purpose, he gives them everything. He gives them absolutely everything, they
[time=2283] or anyone else, whatever need to see, whatever need to know, whatever need to understand about
[time=2291] the person of Christ, and I want you to get your pens out. If they're not already out, I want you to write these six things down. In fact, I'm going to give them to you before we actually see them in the text. What he paints here is a classic picture. What he gives them is a mural, if you will, of the person of Christ that explains for them and shows them everything they would ever need to know or understand, and I want you to see those six things before we actually jump in. I want you to write them down, take a few minutes here, but that's okay. Kids, get your stuff out, be ready to write. He shows them these six things. He shows them Christ's incarnation. Write it down. He shows them Christ's incarnation.
[time=2336] He shows them Christ's validation, how he was validated. He gives them Christ's validation.
[time=2347] He shows them Christ's crucifixion. Write it down. His incarnation, his validation,
[time=2355] his crucifixion. Fourthly, he shows them his resurrection. He shows them his resurrection.
[time=2364] Fifthly, his ascension. A hundred extra points for spelling ascension, right? Fifthly, he
[time=2373] shows them Christ's ascension. And then sixth, and lastly, he shows them his glorification.
[time=2382] His glorification. It's a great picture. Watch how this unfolds. We're going to pick it
[time=2389] up there, the last part of verse 22. Men of Israel, listen to these words. Jesus, the
[time=2397] Nazarene, a man. There you have it. There's his incarnation. You can kind of connect
[time=2403] that in your notes. Verse 22, there's the incarnation. Jesus, the Nazarene, a man. Attested
[time=2410] to you, here comes the validation, attested to you by God, how? With miracles and wonders
[time=2416] and signs which God performed through him in your midst, just as you yourselves know.
[time=2422] This man delivered up by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God. You, here comes
[time=2429] the crucifixion, you nailed to a cross by the hands of godless men and put him to death.
[time=2437] And verse 24, God what? God raised him up. There's the resurrection. And God raised him up again, putting an end to the agony of death, not just his agony, but your agony
[time=2450] and my agony and any agony or fear that comes ever with the thought of death or the experience of death. He puts an end to it. And he gets so taken up. It's interesting as you read
[time=2464] through here. He just gets so taken up by the whole concept. And many of you know because we've said it so many times in this place, the resurrection is at the foundation. It is at the core of all biblical truth. It means the most in some ways of any other doctrine
[time=2481] or truth we ever study, hold dearly or talk about. The resurrection is amazing. And it's
[time=2488] kind of like he gets kind of taken up in this whole mentioning of the resurrection and he goes into this prophetic quote from David back in Psalm 16 for David says of him, verse
[time=2500] 25, "I was always beholding the Lord in my presence, for he is at my right hand that I may not be shaken. Therefore my heart was glad and my tongue exalted, moreover my flesh
[time=2511] also will abide in hope, because thou will not abandon my soul to hate. He's nor allow thy holy one to undergo decay. Thou hast made known to me the ways of life that will make
[time=2521] me full of gladness with thy presence." Brethren, back to Peter, I make confidently say to you
[time=2528] regarding the patriarch David that he both died in and was buried and his tomb is with
[time=2534] us to this day. Dig it up and you'll find his bones. And so because he was a prophet
[time=2540] and knew that God had sworn to him with an oath to seat one of his descendants upon
[time=2546] his throne, he looked ahead and spoke now back to the resurrection, spoke of the resurrection of the Christ. That he was neither abandoned to hate his nor did his flesh suffer decay.
[time=2558] This Jesus, God raised up to which we are all witnesses. And now he keeps painting the
[time=2565] picture, verse 33, "Therefore, having been exalted," there's the ascension, "therefore
[time=2572] having been exalted to the right hand of God and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured forth this which you both see and hear. All that you've
[time=2584] witnessed here as the 120 came down the stairs and into the street, here it is right here.
[time=2589] He has poured forth this which you both see and hear, for it was not David who ascended into heaven, but he himself says, "The Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand.'"
[time=2602] And so I make vain enemies of footstool before thy feet. Verse 36, "Therefore, let all the
[time=2610] house of Israel know for certain that God has made him," here's the glorification, both Lord and Christ. He's king. He's ruler. He's overall. He is both Lord and Christ, this
[time=2620] Jesus whom you crucified. Well, I want to just real quick because some may need to be told
[time=2629] for the first time this morning. Others of you may need a reminder, but I want to before we go on, I want to just, I want to look back at those six things. I hope you wrote them down. And I hope you've got some room somewhere nearby to maybe just add a couple of things because we can read through that list, incarnation, validation, crucifixion,
[time=2647] resurrection, ascension, glorification. And some might sit here this morning and say, "Wait a minute, Kelly, 15 minutes ago, you said, 'Keep it simple. What's with all the shuns, you know? What's with all this list?" Well, I want to make sure you understand.
[time=2660] Some might say, "So what? How is this picture of Christ that you've captured in these six words more than just a quick study in Christology?" What about it? What about it speaks to my
[time=2670] life, Kelly? What about it speaks to my heart? What about this? Can I take with me? And what
[time=2676] about it can give me confidence in my life and walk with Christ? Well, just right next to these words, some things that you need to remember about these words. Peter paints the picture, first of all, of his incarnation. His incarnation, please. What's so special about that? Just briefly, just briefly, it offers a way of hope and salvation for man.
[time=2697] He became a man. Write it down. He became a man. We now, because of him becoming a man,
[time=2705] have, as Hebrews says, a sympathetic Savior who's experienced and seen and gone through all that you go through and I go through. He's not sitting in some lofty cloud calling you to walk a path he has no knowledge of. Now, his incarnation is very, very important.
[time=2722] His validation. What's the big deal about that? Well, simple. Guess what? You have a Lord if you know him this morning. You've given your life to a Christ who wasn't a fraud.
[time=2732] He wasn't a fake who just said he'd do certain things. No, he did it. God's power, working through him, allows him to be validated as the miraculous one, as the healing one, as
[time=2744] Lord and Savior. He was crucified. Pretty simple, pretty forthright. He paid your debt. The debt
[time=2753] created by your sin was paid. A debt you could have never paid. There's nothing you could have ever done to pay that bill. He paid your debt because of his great love and amazing
[time=2764] grace. And not only did he pay it through his death, but he was raised from the grave,
[time=2770] the resurrection. What do I take home with me on that? What kind of confidence can that bring? Well, he defeated death, and you no longer have to fear it. You no longer have
[time=2782] to wonder about it. You no longer have to hold that out as some kind of terrifying, awful thing. No death has been defeated. It couldn't hold him. The grave couldn't keep him. Ascension.
[time=2795] I'm going back to be with the Father. That's a great thought. At one point, he said, I'm going to prepare a place. He's going to build a new home. He's going to prepare a place,
[time=2808] he said, for you and for me, those that have entered into and crossed over that line of faith and entered into that relationship with him. Glorification, very important. Glorification.
[time=2818] What's the big deal on that one? What's so important about that to remember? Well, he's being. He has been glorified. He has been set apart. He says in verse 36, he is both Lord
[time=2827] and Christ. He is your Savior, and he is your ruler. He is your authority. It's a great
[time=2839] picture. You guys, it is a fantastic picture that those of you who have known him for years
[time=2847] should just relish and cherish as you see it painted again. Those of you who sit here this morning, maybe even having recently come to faith in him, you can in fresh and exciting
[time=2858] ways realize in the everyday of your life right now the difference those six things make.
[time=2865] And hopefully this morning you're challenged and prompted to learn more and more about them and more and more about him. And some of you here this morning haven't crossed over
[time=2874] that line. You've yet to relinquish control of your life, yet to enter into that relationship and yet you look at those six things and my guess is that somewhere in your heart this morning you go, wow, what would that be like? What would it be like to have the benefit
[time=2889] of all of that in my own personal life? And our hope is that you wouldn't just ask what
[time=2897] would that be like, but that you would come and ask and enter into dialogue with us and
[time=2903] talk about it at lunch today with the one who brought you or come down front afterwards and ask it yourself. Write a letter, shoot an email, but don't let those questions just sit unanswered. It is a great picture. Look back at verse 36 in his conclusion to this
[time=2923] message. "He gets bold and as you noticed more than likely as we read that verse, he
[time=2931] gets personal. Therefore let all the house of Israel know for certain that God has made
[time=2939] him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you, can you see him? Can you see him standing
[time=2946] there with these people? And can you see him looking in their eyes, maybe even raising his hand and pointing a finger and with real clarity and yet with real power saying you
[time=2957] crucified him?" With one gavel slamming statement, the final verdict is delivered. He is Lord,
[time=2969] people. He is Savior and unless you've acknowledged that, unless you've accepted his rule and
[time=2976] his truth, unless you have been acted upon that truth, you stand with those who denied him, oh, house of Israel as guilty and lost. And Peter's conclusion, this one gavel slamming
[time=2998] statement, carries with it, carried with it, great impact as we'll see next week and maybe
[time=3005] even today carries with it, great impact as well. Because please understand, and again,
[time=3012] this has spoken with love and respect for you, whoever you are, whatever your journey has been like. If today you stand on the other side of the line, not having acknowledged
[time=3023] and not having accepted and not having acted upon, then in your disbelief and your indecision
[time=3030] you stand with them as those who crucified him and who stand today guilty and lost. And
[time=3038] the same hope and the same forgiveness and the same relationship that Peter held out, we held out, we hold out to you this morning as well. Well, the tensions too great, the
[time=3051] following verse too exciting. We can't wait for next week so we can at least take a look at verse 37, their response, well, what a response. It's a response that you long to
[time=3062] hear when you give a message. It's a response that you long to hear when you've done your best to simply and biblically and in a Christ-centered way proclaim the truth. It's a response
[time=3072] that you pray for. It is an amazing response. Look at verse 37, now when they heard this,
[time=3079] the multitudes, right? Thousands. Now when they heard this, they were pierced to the heart
[time=3085] and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, brethren, what shall we do? So this morning,
[time=3097] questions to ask, truth to take home. And I want to leave you with one question this
[time=3106] morning and we've already asked it and I'll ask it again. I'll give you the chance to ask it of yourself. For you this morning, whoever you are, whatever your road has been
[time=3115] like, what shall I do? It's the question that I hope you're willing to ask this morning.
[time=3126] There's a choice you can make. There's a road that you can walk down and we would love to help you walk it. We would love to help you find a peace that you never imagined. We'd love to introduce you to forgiveness and grace that you never knew existed. We'd love to take you by the hand and introduce you to the person of Christ and the Word of God and the Spirit of God and a people of God whose love for you is great. But you've got to ask the
[time=3152] question as they ask the question, what shall we do? Well, you've got to ask yourself, what
[time=3158] shall I do? And please know that we are so willing and so ready to help you do that which
[time=3166] God has called you to do. And we're going to see amazing things unfold in this next
[time=3172] passage and in these remaining chapters. We would love. I would absolutely, we would absolutely love to see great things unfold in your own life as well. Let us know how
[time=3183] we can help. Ask the questions. Have the conversation. Secondly, to those of you already
[time=3190] convinced, let me just close with this. Back to this picture that Peter paints of our Christ and I want to ask you to take this home with you. What about Christ do you believe? What
[time=3201] about Christ do you really believe and really understand and please see that in these verses
[time=3207] 22 to 36 you have a great opportunity to be familiarized again with incredible and insightful
[time=3215] truth about the person of Christ and that which he has brought and that which has been offered. And so I'm going to ask you as a family to do something this week. Just jot these things down or please take note. Number one, I'm going to ask you as a family or as an individual or as a small group to spend time this week reading through that passage.
[time=3233] Just that one section, 22 to 36, maybe even memorize it. Maybe even commit it to memory
[time=3240] verses 22 to 36 of Acts chapter 2. Spend some time maybe as a small group or as a family
[time=3249] you might even want to break it up and give somebody so many verses and somebody else these verses and just see if as a group you can familiarize yourself with a wonderful
[time=3258] picture of our Lord. Secondly, it's a great picture. That's true but you know what? All
[time=3265] throughout scripture there are other passages and other places that reinforce this truth.
[time=3271] So do this, please write this down. This week as you sit down in the morning or when you sit down at midday or when you sit down at night with your pen and your pad and your Bible and I hope you're doing that. Take advantage of just a simple exercise here. Take advantage
[time=3286] of the cross references and your Bible is hopefully over in the margin. In connection
[time=3292] with each verse there might be some other verses mentioned that have to do with that verse. And so as you look at 22 to 36 what would it be like for you this week to just take some time and go through that passage and jot down the cross references, look them up for each of those verses. Maybe write down a few key thoughts or questions that come
[time=3313] to mind but just try to kind of saturate yourself and your mind and you're thinking a little bit more with what God's word says. Memorize it. Read it often. Search the scriptures
[time=3326] through the cross references on that passage. Identify those six truths. Write them down on a card and maybe even in your prayer time as a family or as a group thank him for those
[time=3337] six things. If the little ears and little minds get confused with the shuns explain it to
[time=3343] them again but take those six truths about Christ and this week don't let the thanks
[time=3350] giving stop. And come back next week and we are going to jump in to a passage here at
[time=3358] the end of Acts chapter 2 that has the potential, has the capacity to revolutionize and redirect
[time=3369] and refocus your heart and mind with respect to how we do church, how we approach each
[time=3376] other, how we approach those still contemplating that decision. Next week powerful, powerful
[time=3382] passage at the end of Acts chapter 2. Let me invite you to stand. If you would, thank
[time=3388] you so much for being here today. Thank you for your interest in the word of God and again,
[time=3396] come back and join us next week. Bring a friend or two from work or on your block. Don't forget this is a place where they're going to be made to feel welcome, even safe but in the midst of feeling safe, you and I know they're going to hear a message that's true and life-changing and potentially eternity-altering and we want them to hear it so bring them,
[time=3416] invite them and we'll look forward to being together again real soon. Let's pray. Father
[time=3422] for Peter's boldness and willingness to stand up and even for the first time in a long time
[time=3430] say words and share truth and speak in a way God that was clear and that was true and that
[time=3438] was bold and right. Father for his willingness, a simple man like all of us in this room who
[time=3446] was willing to be used of you and exercise faith, God for him, we thank you and for the message that you gave him to speak, we thank you for that as well. God, this morning it has reminded us of what was behind the miraculous that reminded us this morning of what is always
[time=3462] behind, the miraculous. It's when God pours forth his spirit and God also for the picture
[time=3468] he paints, the picture he painted for the thousands of Jews who stood there in awe, listening.
[time=3474] God for us this morning it's a reminder of our Lord and so Father as we go from this place we pray that your spirit would remind us, convict us and grow us, that we would be prompted
[time=3485] this week to study and to read and to look and to memorize and discuss these very truths and ways that would reinforce the truth and the opportunities we have to live them out
[time=3496] in the day to day of life. Thank you for this time. In your son's name we pray, amen.
