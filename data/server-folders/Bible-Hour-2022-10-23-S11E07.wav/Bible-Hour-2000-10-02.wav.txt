[time=0] (upbeat music) - Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service
[time=12] of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=14] Thank you for joining us.
[time=15] We trust that the music and message from God's word will help you in your Christian walk.
[time=20] Now let's join our service.
[time=22] - For better, for worse, for richer, for poor, till death do us part.
[time=30] You never know how significant those words are.
[time=32] - I'm sorry.
[time=35] - Until God bigs the worst in your life,
[time=42] very real in your marriage.
[time=44] - But think of the way.
[time=60] - Sorry, I have to cheat.
[time=62] When God sends the storm that sends your boats crashing into the rocks, into a million pieces, God is faithful and he sends the life preservers of his peace and his patience and his presence
[time=78] and his forgiveness and his never-ending love.
[time=82] And when the storm stops and the wind stops blowing,
[time=88] God is so faithful in opening my eyes to see what he's done in me, in the fact that he's, when I'm lonely, he's there for me, maybe.
[time=106] When I feel hopeless, he brings me to my needs.
[time=109] And God, thank you for all that you've done me.
[time=118] (laughing) - Well, I was a sleeping Christian.
[time=124] And at 32 years old, I began to wake up.
[time=129] I had a daughter and she was born to me that year
[time=135] and she was mentally disabled, retarded.
[time=139] And she had epilepsy.
[time=140] And I felt like somebody had given me a great, big, fat knuckle sandwich.
[time=149] Like right here in my stomach hurt and I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep, but what did God do in me?
[time=158] He began to produce in me strength of heart.
[time=165] Hebrews 6, 18, and 19 says,
[time=173] We who have fled to him for refuge can take new courage.
[time=178] This confidence is like a strong
[time=185] and trustworthy anchor for my soul.
[time=189] Hosanna, this next song says to the Lamb who was slain.
[time=201] [MUSIC - 229 seconds]
[time=435] - Father, it's truly what you have done in us.
[time=442] Lord, there's nothing that we can do to earn your salvation.
[time=446] Lord, it's your power and your grace and your mercy that has set us free.
[time=455] Lord, probably each and every person here could stand and talk about things that you've seen them through, situations, difficulties in life, physical problems, job difficulties, family difficulties, whatever the case may be.
[time=470] But Father, this morning as we come, we come with grateful hearts that you are working in our lives.
[time=481] Lord, that as we've accepted your grace, your mercy through your son, Jesus Christ, truly, we will never be the same again.
[time=491] We can't go back to our old ways, Lord.
[time=495] Oh, we might slip back time and again, but it's through your strength, through your guidance, through your power, that we can truly walk with you, Lord.
[time=509] We can shut the door and move forward in a life of freedom, freedom in Christ, freedom from this world, even though we are in it.
[time=521] And Lord, we celebrate that this morning.
[time=524] Lord, we're so grateful.
[time=527] We love you.
[time=528] We praise you.
[time=530] We want to worship you for it's in your son's name.
[time=534] We pray, amen.
[time=539] [MUSIC - 174 seconds]
[time=720] - On November 9th, 1987, I'll always remember it.
[time=730] I rolled out of bed that Monday morning to go to work and landed flat on my face.
[time=735] My right side was paralyzed.
[time=737] And two days later, I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.
[time=740] I remember as time progressed, I kept hearing this voice in the back of my head and it was the pastor that led me to Christ when I was young, Romans 828.
[time=753] All things happened for the good, for those that loved God.
[time=756] I loved God, so I just waited to see what would happen.
[time=761] God has led people in my lives who are newly diagnosed and seekers, and they've said, "Paddy, how do you do this?
[time=770] "How do you keep being happy?" And I've been able to share my faith.
[time=773] And I wake up every morning and I thank God and I praise Him.
[time=780] He's made my path so bright.
[time=785] And I have the privilege of pointing the way to other people by this disease, I thank Him for that.
[time=795] After the tragic death of my 18-year-old son
[time=803] four years ago, part of me died too.
[time=806] Every morning, I'd get up and I'd put on a plastic face
[time=815] to keep my family from knowing how I was suffering.
[time=821] Three years ago, I was invited to live in Christmas tree.
[time=825] I loved it so much.
[time=827] In January of 1999, I got involved with singing in the music ministry.
[time=832] Through that experience, I learned about Jesus's love for me.
[time=838] Then I gave my life to Christ.
[time=840] By His grace, I learned to live again and now I can truly smile again.
[time=851] Good morning, everybody.
[time=853] Over 20 years ago, right out of high school, I was assistant manager of a large grocery store and everybody said, "Randy, you're going straight to the top." The only thing they didn't know was I was already an alcoholic and an intravenous drug abuser.
[time=866] After several years, I lost my job and I hit rock bottom
[time=873] and I cried out to the Lord Jesus.
[time=876] I said, "Lord, I don't even know if you're real." I don't even know if you're there.
[time=882] But if you're there, please forgive me of all my sins and release me for my addictions of drugs and alcohol.
[time=892] And as I fell at the feet of Jesus, my tears of repentance and sorrow changed.
[time=900] And beloved, that's why we're here this morning to worship Him because He has transformed our lives we have the joy of knowing that He's real, we have the joy of knowing that He's alive, that He's supernaturally conquered death.
[time=917] Can we just set aside the cares of this world and focus our worship to the Lord Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior?
[time=929] [MUSIC - 246 seconds]
[time=1178] (gentle guitar music) As we worship You.
[time=1188] As we worship You.
[time=1227] Here I am waiting For guiding me I pray.
[time=1239] Here I am longing For you.
[time=1244] I will be in Your love.
[time=1256] Bring me to my knees.
[time=1263] May I know Jesus for and for all.
[time=1274] [MUSIC]
[time=1294] Though I can't see Your holy, holy face
[time=1303] Or You're thrown in heaven above.
[time=1308] It seems so far away.
[time=1316] Though I can't touch, I can't touch Your nail scarred hands.
[time=1326] I have a deep unspeakable joy That makes my faith to stand.
[time=1340] Lord I believe in You.
[time=1345] I'll always believe Though I can't see You in my eyes.
[time=1354] I'll believe in My heart, Your presence I'd like.
[time=1360] Lord I believe in You.
[time=1366] I'll believe My trust.
[time=1371] Death the whole world Say what they name.
[time=1377] No one can take This joy away.
[time=1382] Lord I believe.
[time=1390] One from above You are God's only chosen one.
[time=1400] You're the one and only true way.
[time=1405] To my Father's heart.
[time=1413] Die for all sin.
[time=1417] Then You go and now live again.
[time=1423] God will bring death and the ring.
[time=1427] So that I might live.
[time=1433] Lord I believe in You.
[time=1438] I'll always believe in You.
[time=1443] Lord I can't see You in my eyes.
[time=1449] I'll believe in My heart, Your presence I'd like.
[time=1455] Lord I believe in You.
[time=1466] Death the whole world Say what they name.
[time=1472] No one can take This joy away.
[time=1477] Lord I believe.
[time=1486] I believe.
[time=1491] Lord I believe in You.
[time=1496] I'll always believe in You.
[time=1502] No one can take You in my eyes.
[time=1508] I'll believe in My heart, Your presence I'd like.
[time=1513] Lord I believe in You.
[time=1518] Death I believe My trust in You.
[time=1524] Death the whole world Say what they name.
[time=1529] No one can take This joy away.
[time=1535] Lord I believe.
[time=1540] I believe Lord I believe.
[time=1557] I believe.
[time=1567] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1573] Open up your Bibles.
[time=1575] Turn over from Malachi over to the Book of Acts.
[time=1579] Open up this morning if you would to Acts chapter 2.
[time=1583] Acts chapter 2 we're going to pick it up this morning eventually in verse 37.
[time=1586] And in the coming weeks make our way down through the end of this chapter to verse 47.
[time=1592] Acts chapter 2.
[time=1593] Now last week, a little bit of review here for you, okay?
[time=1596] Those of you who were here.
[time=1598] Kids, let me hear you on this.
[time=1599] Anybody speak out.
[time=1600] Last week we saw Peter.
[time=1602] Of all guys, we saw Peter.
[time=1605] Filled with the Holy Spirit, deliver a powerful, powerful message.
[time=1610] And it was a powerful message we learned last week because it was comprised of three things.
[time=1615] Number one, it was, starts with an S, what was it?
[time=1618] Say aloud.
[time=1619] Simple, right.
[time=1621] It was simple, forth right and straight forward.
[time=1624] It was powerful also you guys because it was number two, what?
[time=1628] Biblical.
[time=1629] It wasn't a flowery story and it wasn't his own opinion.
[time=1632] It was the truth.
[time=1634] It was simple.
[time=1635] It was biblical and thirdly it was what?
[time=1638] Christ centered.
[time=1639] It's a powerful message that had all three of those components.
[time=1643] And in that message he explained to these question asking seeking Jews that the miracle of tongues,
[time=1650] the miracle of languages that they had witnessed as the 120 had come down from the upper room and spilled out onto the street was God induced.
[time=1659] He explained this to them.
[time=1660] It was God induced, not wine induced.
[time=1665] And he also let them know that what had transpired and what they had seen was an event that was predicted prophetically by the prophet Joel over 200 years prior.
[time=1673] And he had come to its ultimate and perfect fulfillment.
[time=1676] He also painted a penetrating and revealing picture of the Lord himself.
[time=1680] Detailing for them the six specific truths about him.
[time=1684] Truths that brought clarity.
[time=1686] Those were the six, those big long words we gave you last week.
[time=1690] Those shuns, all those T.I.O. and ending words, those six things.
[time=1694] They paint a beautiful penetrating revealing picture of our Lord.
[time=1699] They set him apart, those words do, those principles, those doctrines, those truths you saw, those six things.
[time=1705] They set him apart as Savior and Lord and as Messiah and confronted with their sin of disbelief
[time=1712] and their part in the crucifixion of the Lord himself.
[time=1715] It says in verse 37, look with me there.
[time=1718] It says now when they heard this, they were pierced to the heart and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, brethren, what shall we do?
[time=1731] Important to note here.
[time=1733] And I want you to see this, I want you to catch this.
[time=1736] For some of you, it's new news.
[time=1738] For others of you, it's a great reminder.
[time=1740] What was it about Peter's words that pierced them to the heart?
[time=1746] What was it about what he said?
[time=1748] Well, the answer to that is found in Hebrews chapter 4.
[time=1750] Hebrews chapter 4, flip back for just a moment to the back of your New Testament.
[time=1757] Philemon, Hebrews, James.
[time=1762] Right there in the middle between Philemon and James, the book of Hebrews, and turn back to the fourth chapter.
[time=1769] What was it about Peter's words?
[time=1770] What was it about what was said that literally pierced them?
[time=1775] To the heart.
[time=1777] Well, the answer is right here for us.
[time=1779] Verses 12 and 13 of Hebrews chapter 4.
[time=1783] Here you go.
[time=1785] For the word of God.
[time=1787] For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two edged sword and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit of both joints and marrow and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
[time=1803] And there is no creature, not one, not you, not me, not your friends, not these questions asking seeking Jews.
[time=1815] No one, it says in verse 13, is hidden from his sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of him with whom we have to do.
[time=1827] Like a razor sharp double edged sword, the word of God, the truth it says, pierces.
[time=1834] It penetrates, it stabs through your defenses in mind, exposing our true nature.
[time=1840] And these unbelievers, this group, the multitudes, the thousands who have now come and have listened and have asked, they could no longer hide.
[time=1849] They were guilty and they knew it before God as the truth had laid them open.
[time=1856] Full of sin and nowhere to turn until now.
[time=1861] And so they cry out, they cry out, what shall we do?
[time=1865] Which again, just briefly, another important thing to take note of.
[time=1869] Their response, their, what shall we do?
[time=1874] That's a great response.
[time=1876] That's the response you want to see.
[time=1880] That's the response that indicates somebody's really serious about change.
[time=1886] That's the response.
[time=1888] You tell me what to do and I'll do it.
[time=1891] Tell me where to go and I'll go.
[time=1893] Tell me how to jump and I'll jump.
[time=1895] What shall I do?
[time=1896] Tell me and I'm there.
[time=1898] It's a great sign in this case and it's a great sign in your case as you deal with friends or with children.
[time=1905] What shall we do in comparison to maybe, you know, what do you have in mind?
[time=1910] A little bit different.
[time=1912] And you do that as adults and you kids do that at times with your parents.
[time=1916] There's a difference between, I'm wrong and I'm guilty and you tell me what to do and I'll do it and I'll make it right.
[time=1924] Versus, I'm wrong and I'm guilty and I don't know, what do you have in mind?
[time=1929] One represents true repentance and one doesn't.
[time=1934] These people, they were cut to the quick.
[time=1936] The Word of God had laid them open and they're saying, "You tell me, Peter.
[time=1939] You tell us what to do." Well, Peter responds.
[time=1943] And in so doing gives them and anyone here in this room this morning, three truths that lead to life.
[time=1949] Three wonderful, miraculous, simple, profound truths.
[time=1953] Let's jump into it back to Acts chapter 2.
[time=1957] They ask and he responds, "What shall we do?"
[time=1963] And he says there in verse 38.
[time=1965] And Peter said to them, "Repent, repent and let each one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[time=1973] for the forgiveness of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit." Back to the top, verse 38, first thing he says, write it down.
[time=1981] He says, "Repent." He says, "Repent." Now, when we hear this Word, when you hear it, when I hear it, we often think, at least I do.
[time=1991] Well, what do you think? Think about it for a second.
[time=1994] Hear me say it to you, okay?
[time=1996] Repent.
[time=1998] Repentance.
[time=2000] Someone who is willing to repent, repent.
[time=2003] When you hear that Word, what do you think?
[time=2006] What comes to your mind?
[time=2007] Oftentimes, when I hear that Word, I tend to go in my mind to feeling sad, feeling remorseful,
[time=2014] feeling sorry about something I've done.
[time=2019] But in reality, and I want you to catch this, the Word itself carries a much deeper and vital meaning.
[time=2026] It literally means this, the Word, repent, and the New Testament means to change one's mind.
[time=2032] To change the way you view something, to change your belief about something, to repent means to change one's mind,
[time=2041] to see an action, to see something that you've done, a choice you've made,
[time=2047] words that have come out of your mouth, a decision that got made that had this impact, a sinful action, to see it the way God sees it, to no longer see it as you saw it,
[time=2058] but now to see it the way God sees it, and now seeing it the way He sees it with all of its ramifications
[time=2065] and all of its impact, we change our mind about the choice.
[time=2071] We change our mind about what we believe about that, and we now with a changed mind move in a completely, what,
[time=2079] different direction.
[time=2081] That is biblical repentance.
[time=2085] I am going to, with the help of the Spirit of God, you are going to.
[time=2091] I am going to, with the help of the Spirit of God and the people of God, and the Word of God, change my mind
[time=2098] about adult entertainment on the internet, giving you some examples here, because it doesn't satisfy,
[time=2107] it's an empty well, it brings shame and hurt and destruction, so I will now see it as God sees it,
[time=2114] change the way I used to think, now think about it the way He sees it and move in a different direction,
[time=2121] away from it, completely. I am going to change my mind about gossip.
[time=2128] It doesn't make me more like, it makes me more untrustworthy.
[time=2133] It damages the hearts of people made in the image of God, people that He loves and that I should love.
[time=2139] I am going to change my mind about overeating or overspending.
[time=2143] Those things don't bring a lasting gratification, they get in the way of really trusting God, and when I look at those things, the way God looks at them, I can change my mind about them and move in a different direction.
[time=2158] That's repentance. Peter says, change your mind about Christ. Change your mind about Him.
[time=2166] You see, they already felt, here's the interesting point, you see, they already felt sorrow.
[time=2170] They already felt regret, they already felt remorse.
[time=2174] They had stood there and said, "In essence, enough, okay, enough, Peter, we heard you, tell us, what shall we do?"
[time=2180] They already felt sorry, but feeling sorry couldn't save them, couldn't.
[time=2186] And feeling sorry can't save you.
[time=2190] No, they needed to change, they needed to adjust at the heart level, they needed to change what they believed.
[time=2198] They needed to believe instead that Jesus is the Son of God, that He paid their bill, and His death and resurrection gives them forgiveness and eternal life.
[time=2206] They needed to repent, change their mind about the way they viewed Christ.
[time=2210] And you see this again and again and again through the entire New Testament and especially in the Book of Acts.
[time=2217] Get your pens going here, write some passages down, look these things up this week.
[time=2222] First Thessalonians 1-9, read there about repentance.
[time=2226] Acts 3-19.
[time=2230] Acts 5-31.
[time=2233] Acts 8-22.
[time=2237] Acts 11-18.
[time=2241] Acts 17-30.
[time=2244] Then Acts 20-21, just to name a few, and if you missed any of those, come up afterwards and I'll give them to you.
[time=2250] Read the five verses before and the five verses after of each of those passages.
[time=2257] And read about it, learn about it, and be reminded about what repentance looks like.
[time=2261] Peter called these people to repent.
[time=2263] Secondly, Peter instructs them back to verse 38, Peter instructs the people to be baptized.
[time=2269] Repent, he says, and let each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sin.
[time=2277] Peter, in saying this to this group, makes it clear that there will be no secret followers of Christ.
[time=2285] None.
[time=2287] No, he knew as we know today that there is ownership and a sense of belonging that comes from the public act of baptism.
[time=2295] And again, be reminded of the context of this passage.
[time=2299] Be reminded of the reality these people lived, these people, these questions asking, seeking Jews who lived in this day
[time=2306] who have now come to Peter and said, "Tell us what to do." For them to respond, for them to repent, and for them to be publicly baptized
[time=2315] would mean total and complete ostracization from their family.
[time=2319] They would be rejected, they would be set apart, they would be cast away.
[time=2323] In a couple of chapters from now, they'll start to be murdered and tortured and killed.
[time=2328] But at this point, at least, public baptism would have certainly removed them from employment.
[time=2335] It would have removed them from family, it would have removed them from friends.
[time=2338] It would cost them their lives as they knew it.
[time=2343] And Peter says, "We will have no underground church."
[time=2349] "Repent," he says, "and be baptized." Two things to note here in just these few words that I want you to make sure you see and take note of.
[time=2358] "Repent and be baptized." It's a process. "Repent and be baptized."
[time=2364] The tour connect baptism is to be a response.
[time=2367] Baptism is a response to repentance.
[time=2370] Now, baptism doesn't seal it, baptism doesn't legitimize it.
[time=2374] No, repentance stands alone, and baptism was to be the initial act in these days, in this setting.
[time=2381] It would often be the initial act of obedience as a new faith began to express itself
[time=2387] in the life of that individual.
[time=2389] "Repent and be baptized." Second thing I want you to see here, and this has often been, this verse has often kind of been the proof text.
[time=2398] For some who would like to teach what's known as baptismal regeneration, some people believe,
[time=2404] and we won't get into all of the arguments about it, but some folks actually think that this verse teaches that when you are baptized, that's when you are saved.
[time=2412] You are saved through baptism because of the wording here.
[time=2416] Let each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins.
[time=2422] Interesting though, as you study this, and as you study the, first of all, when you study the issue of baptism,
[time=2429] in the whole total complete context of God's word, nowhere.
[time=2434] Nowhere does it teach that?
[time=2437] Nowhere.
[time=2439] And when you look at this verse more closely and carefully and you begin to get out your Greek dictionary and all your study helps, it's a very interesting thing.
[time=2447] Because of, and the interesting thing is this, the phrase for, look with me there, just that little word for,
[time=2455] let each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sin.
[time=2461] That phrase in the Greek is literally translated because of 95% of the time.
[time=2470] That phrase is translated because of, be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ because of the forgiveness of your sins.
[time=2481] You can write this down, Matthew 12 verse 41 would just be one example of that very same phrase being used in that very same way.
[time=2489] Baptism doesn't save you, nowhere in Scripture is that taught, nowhere do the inspired apostles teach that.
[time=2496] It is repentance that saves, it is repentance that brings forgiveness.
[time=2500] It is the changing of one's mind about Christ that secures them in his love.
[time=2506] Think about it, Jesus told the rich young ruler in Luke 18.
[time=2510] Some of you will remember that story.
[time=2512] Think about what he said to that rich young ruler who had come to him asking him how he might obtain eternal life.
[time=2518] He's asking how do I obtain eternal life and what did Jesus tell him? Go sell all of your possessions.
[time=2528] Now from that are we to argue that someone is saved by going and selling all their possessions? No.
[time=2534] No, the point of the story, whether we're talking about selling one's possessions or being baptized.
[time=2541] Tell you what, if the rich young ruler were truly saved, if he had repented and changed his mind about Christ, when he had been told to go sell all his possessions, what would he have done?
[time=2550] Sold him. Like that in a heartbeat.
[time=2553] Because when someone's truly repentant and when someone comes to know Christ, their heart is changed and there's a willingness to do the things that God's called them to do.
[time=2561] Whether it's sell possessions or be baptized.
[time=2566] He says repent and be baptized because of the forgiveness of your sin. Thirdly he says be saved.
[time=2573] Thirdly write it down, verse 40 he says be saved. See what it says there and with many other words.
[time=2580] And with many other words back up to thirty, back up to thirty nine for the promise Peter said is for you and your children and for all who are far off.
[time=2588] As many as the Lord our God shall call to himself and verse 40 with many other words he solemnly testified and kept on exhorting them saying be saved from this perverse generation.
[time=2601] Be saved. Better said really in the Greek be delivered.
[time=2606] Be delivered. Write that down. Be delivered. Well be delivered from what?
[time=2610] Well he said it right there this perverse generation. From this twisted, valueless, degenerate, debauched society.
[time=2621] Sound familiar? What do you see in these days?
[time=2626] On the television commercials in between games. See in the same things I'm seeing?
[time=2631] It's not getting better people, isn't it? It's getting worse. It's more prevalent. It's more invasive.
[time=2637] It's everywhere you look. And everywhere you look and everywhere you go and everything you turn on it's going to be there.
[time=2644] And it's yelling. It's screaming loudly to you and to me and to our children and to our friends.
[time=2650] Come on, come on, come on. Get a little bit of this. Dive into that.
[time=2656] It's everywhere. Peter knew just as many of you know that the impact of society whether it's the first century church or you and I here at Blackhawk.
[time=2664] We know the impact of society. The mindset and mentality of a relativistic culture is both destructive and devastating.
[time=2671] And that's why his plea and that's why our plea is so very emphatic.
[time=2679] A valueless, immoral, godless culture produces, has produced and always will produce the same things.
[time=2692] It's been this way from the beginning and it's just getting worse.
[time=2696] It will produce fear. It will produce shame. It will produce loneliness, guilt, depression, addictions, hate, strife, fraud and ruin.
[time=2709] Always has and always will and he didn't want that for them and we don't want that for you.
[time=2715] Whoever you are, wherever you're at this morning on this journey as you seek to better understand the person of Christ and the truth of God.
[time=2723] Our hope is the very same hope that he had in his heart for those people be delivered from a society and a mindset and a culture that brings nothing but ruin and devastation and fear and shame and addictions and hate and all those things.
[time=2740] The message is the same today as it was then and he proclaimed it boldly and we proclaim it lovingly and boldly you can be delivered from this sin and this world by following Christ.
[time=2755] You can be delivered by giving yourself completely to him, by acknowledging same three things we talked about last week, by acknowledging him, by accepting him, by acting upon his perfect life and sacrificial death and the forgiveness and hope that only he offers to those who repent.
[time=2777] Not to those who go to church three times a year, not to those who never commit adultery, not to those who never commit murder, not to those who are good people, no, to those who change their mind about Christ, to those who repent.
[time=2794] So, the people with pierced hearts cry out, "What shall we do Peter? Tell us and we'll do it." Peter responds, "Repent, be baptized and be delivered from this perverse generation."
[time=2808] And you know what? The people did.
[time=2812] They did.
[time=2814] The multitudes that had gathered, the multitudes that had seen, the miracle of languages, the multitudes who had heard the sermon, the multitudes who Peter had said, "Repent, be baptized and be saved." They responded. They did. Look at verse 41.
[time=2828] And so then, those who had received his word were baptized, and there were added that day about 3,000 souls.
[time=2842] How about that?
[time=2844] 3,000 souls added to this new fledgling church. They received the word in the Greek means to take in.
[time=2854] To take in, they had received it. They had taken it in to the very depths of their being. They believed, and they were baptized.
[time=2862] 3,000. Imagine that. Picture that in your mind. Picture 3,000 people being baptized by the 120 that day. Picture it.
[time=2874] These 120 people in Peter and John and the rest of the guys, 3,000 people saying, "Count me in. I'll lose my life. I'll lose my home. I want to be forgiven. I want to have life. I want to be with you. I want to be with the Lord."
[time=2888] What an experience that must have been. One author summed it up this way.
[time=2892] He said, "When that day," now picture this, "I forgot about this until just this week. We've been at this study now for 3 weeks. I've been at this study for about 6. And I forgot this. And this is really cool.
[time=2913] When that day, we're just talking about a day. When that day had dawned, a room full of faithful but powerless followers of Christ set together, scared, praying and waiting.
[time=2927] And by the time the sun had set, there were now thousands who carried the flame of truth and the Spirit of God in their newly cleansed hearts.
[time=2935] For them, new life had begun. The church was born. The gospel was growing. And it still is today. Isn't that a great picture?
[time=2945] It was all one day. One day they woke up scared and lonely, wondering what the world was going to happen, huddled together like scared mice in a room.
[time=2953] And by the end of the day, wow, the church had been born. 3,000 souls come to know Christ in response to a simple biblical Christ-centered message.
[time=2964] Questions to ask. Questions that maybe you need to ask. Some truth to take home. Write this one down. What do you need in light of what we've said here?
[time=2980] What do you need to change your mind about? What do you need to change your mind about and move in a different direction from?
[time=2991] That's repentance. And for some in the room this morning, the repentance that you need to consider today is big repentance.
[time=3004] I mean, repentance as it relates to Christ. Repentance as it relates to your life. Repentance as it relates to eternity.
[time=3014] And maybe this morning for you is that time. Maybe for you, questions have been answered. Truth has been revealed. The Word of God has split you open.
[time=3023] And maybe today with that friend who brought you. Or with one of us down here in the front. Or today on your own.
[time=3032] And we can hear about it later. But maybe today for you is the opportunity for you to change your mind about what you believe about Christ.
[time=3041] And to accept his amazing grace and his radical mercy and the new life that he brings and move in a different new direction.
[time=3050] Others of you have already experienced that repentance. But you know like I know that there's the ongoing need in the day to day of life to repent from those things that have led you and I astray from the truth and the person of Christ and the relationship that we have with him.
[time=3067] What is it for you? You're too critical. You talk too much. Maybe you don't talk enough.
[time=3076] Maybe it's a habit that continues to rear its head that you continue to choose. Maybe you're too busy. Maybe you're too controlling.
[time=3084] I don't know what it is, but you do. And the Spirit of God does. And the Spirit of God's moving in you this morning and the Word of God is saying to you, repent.
[time=3093] Make a choice, draw a line in the sand, say that's it, I'm changing my mind. And with the Spirit of God and the people of God, 'cause yeah, I'll go ask for help now.
[time=3101] I will go ask for assistance. I will let those that I know love me and those that I trust see me for who I am, let them know that this continues to be an issue.
[time=3111] And I will pursue repentance with the Spirit of God and the people of God and the Word of God standing by me.
[time=3121] I don't know what it is, but you do, and he does. And this morning's an opportunity for you to act on that.
[time=3127] Truth to take home, let me read this quote to you if I can.
[time=3132] I was convicting for me personally. It's given me something to think about and pray about as the days have gone by this week.
[time=3138] And you can write the guy's name down, his name is Albert Barnes. And Albert Barnes said this.
[time=3144] Albert Barnes said false repentance, false repentance, dreads the consequences of sin.
[time=3154] False repentance dreads the consequences of sin. True repentance dreads the mere presence of sin.
[time=3164] And how do you find your heart responding to that this morning?
[time=3167] True repentance dreads the mere presence of sin itself.
[time=3173] False repentance dreads really only the consequences.
[time=3178] Well they asked and Peter responded.
[time=3183] And his response is our response to you this morning.
[time=3187] Those of you who are seeking, those of you who are searching, those of you who have already crossed over that line.
[time=3194] God's word says repent. God's word says be baptized and be delivered.
[time=3200] And again if we can help you with that, if we can talk with you about that we'd love to do so.
[time=3205] We really would. And it is our prayer and our hope that the truth of God's word as it says in Hebrews 4 that you would in your spirit this morning allow it to cut and allow it to penetrate.
[time=3217] And allow it to move you to a place that you need to be in relationship with a living God whose love for you is great and who offers you a life like you've never known or seen.
[time=3228] Let me ask you if I can to stand.
[time=3240] Let me ask you to stand and let me just ask if you would please everyone if you just quietly bow your heads and then close your eyes.
[time=3250] And I want to give you an opportunity this morning having heard all that we've heard and having seen so many even here in front of us today who have articulated so powerfully to you, to all of us.
[time=3263] The life changing, grace giving effect that relationship with Christ brings.
[time=3274] And as you've heard the Word of God this morning and as you've seen Peter's response to those who said what shall we do, possibly today.
[time=3282] Again in your heart the Spirit of God has been moving and I want to give you an opportunity and we do this periodically.
[time=3287] I want to give you a chance right here in this setting to simply pray a forthright and straightforward prayer of repentance.
[time=3297] I want to give you a chance right here in the quietness of your own heart to just simply repeat some simple words that carry with them profound life changing eternity altering truth.
[time=3309] I want to give you a chance to confess your sense and move into a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=3317] And if that's something that you've been wanting to do, if that's something that you feel ready to do this morning, we want to give you the opportunity to do that and here's how that works.
[time=3325] I'm just going to pray a prayer and I'm going to pray it slow and all you have to do is just quietly in your own heart repeat these words.
[time=3333] And as you repeat them God's Word gives you comfort and God's Word gives you confidence that if you believe in your heart and confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord you shall be what saved.
[time=3350] So if you want to, if you're ready to, if you feel led to pray quietly and silently along with me just say this.
[time=3360] My loving Father and God in heaven.
[time=3365] I know that I'm a sinner.
[time=3369] I know that I am imperfect.
[time=3374] I know I am in need of forgiveness.
[time=3378] And God I realize that your Son was given as a gift. You sent Jesus Christ to die in my place.
[time=3389] And in dying for me and in forgiving all my sins, Father you've invited me into relationship with you.
[time=3400] And today right here I accept that gift. I know it should have been me, but I accept that gift and I enter today into a relationship with you.
[time=3414] And I commit my life and I commit my heart and I commit my days to live for you with the help of the Spirit of God, the Word of God and the people of God.
[time=3433] Father thank you for this family here at Blackhawk. Thank you for the days ahead where I have a chance to now live for you.
[time=3443] Father thank you for the gift of eternal life. In your Son's name I pray. Amen.
[time=3451] Father we as a family, as a whole body of people here, we revel this morning in the opportunity we've had to be reminded of you,
[time=3461] to see you at work in the lives of everyday people, to see your word again opened up and the truth that is there.
[time=3468] The message that Peter gave and the message that still rings true for us today. God we thank you for that.
[time=3474] And we pray that as we go you'll be with us. God every one of us needs to repent. Some need to be baptized. Some need to be saved.
[time=3482] And God as we move forward we pray that your Spirit would go with us. Bring us back together again soon.
[time=3488] And we'll look forward to seeing how you will continue to grow this family in your Son's name we pray. Amen.
