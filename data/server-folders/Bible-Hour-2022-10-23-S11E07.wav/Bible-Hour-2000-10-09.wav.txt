[time=0] (upbeat music) - Welcome to the Sunday Morning Worship Service
[time=12] of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=14] Thank you for joining us.
[time=15] We trust that the music and message from God's word will help you in your Christian walk.
[time=20] Now let's join our service.
[time=22] [MUSIC - 65 seconds]
[time=92] - Just the last two lines of that song.
[time=101] Ever only all for thee.
[time=110] Now Kelly's gonna touch on complete abandonment this morning.
[time=116] As you think about that word, I think there's a word that has to come first before abandonment can take place.
[time=124] And the word that I thought of was trust.
[time=126] Before I can abandon everything, I have to trust first.
[time=132] And instantly I illustrated it in my mind.
[time=135] I went to a picture of a commercial that some of you may be familiar with.
[time=138] It's on TV today.
[time=140] And it's that picture of that little boy.
[time=142] He's standing on a dock in a lake.
[time=145] And he's little, like two years old, three years old.
[time=147] And he wants to jump into his daddy's arms.
[time=150] And his dad is standing there about waist high in water.
[time=153] And he's got his hands out like this.
[time=156] And he's saying something, but you can't hear it.
[time=158] But it's like, come on, jump, trust me.
[time=161] And if you watch that commercial as it unfolds, what happens is the boy trusts his dad.
[time=168] And he actually jumps.
[time=171] But this little thing happens there.
[time=173] His hands don't catch him in the air.
[time=176] They don't touch him.
[time=178] He jumps and goes into the water.
[time=181] You see, and then the next picture that you get is the hands of the dad gently going under the armpits of the baby boy and lifting him out of the water.
[time=192] You see, that's just like our heavenly father.
[time=196] We have to make a conscious decision of trust.
[time=203] A decision to leap, a decision of faith.
[time=208] But we're oftentimes on that dock.
[time=211] Okay, trust you.
[time=214] And we expect his arms to be right there.
[time=218] But that's not God.
[time=219] God's arms won't be right there.
[time=222] He wants you.
[time=224] He wants me to take the leap.
[time=227] And we won't feel the decision or the leap or the trust until when we go under the water.
[time=235] Then God's hands will grant us and bring us up.
[time=241] That's trust.
[time=245] That's our father.
[time=248] Never forsakes us.
[time=251] So as you think of total abandonment, first question, do I trust?
[time=258] Then can I abandon or will I abandon because we should?
[time=262] And as we think about that in light of giving today, I challenge you with that.
[time=268] I challenge all of us with that.
[time=270] Total abandonment.
[time=273] - Now Jesus sat down opposite the treasury and began observing how the multitude were putting money into the treasury.
[time=281] Many rich people were putting in large sums.
[time=284] And the poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, which amount to one cent.
[time=289] Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said to them, "Truly I say to you, this poor widow put in more than all the contributors, for they all put in out of their surplus, but she out of her poverty put in all she owned, all she had to live on." We've come together again to worship our God in spirit and in truth.
[time=311] In doing so this morning, we will consider what the scriptures teach with respect to the heart of one who gives.
[time=317] We've already seen in our study of Acts, a small band of giving believers, whom God used to change the world.
[time=323] Those faithful few who, like the poor widow, gave recklessly to the point of going without.
[time=329] But does the reckless sacrificing giver really go without?
[time=334] Or does the father hold up and honor the one who exercises obedience and trust in their giving?
[time=340] Let's open our hearts to him and his truth, as we bring our questions and our praise to him.
[time=347] - Hey, you know this morning, we are going to just for a week, take a break.
[time=355] From our study of the book of Acts, it's been a great few weeks so far and I can't wait to get back to it.
[time=361] But we do want to just take a little bit of time this morning and touch on something that we've been talking about as a family for the last couple of weeks.
[time=369] As a leadership, we felt like it was right and good and timing wise appropriate for us to begin to share with you just our hope and our desire that financially as a church, we would begin to consider.
[time=382] Maybe once again, what God's word has to say about our giving and your response has been tremendous and encouraging and we hope God just continues to work in your heart and life.
[time=393] Part of what we thought as we considered this whole issue was that sometimes it's good not just to talk about it but to actually teach about it, to see what it is that our absolute source of truth, our absolute source of guidance and direction in life, what does it have to say?
[time=410] And so this morning, we're just going to take a morning and look at God's word and see what it says about giving.
[time=416] It's also powerful sometimes.
[time=419] Nothing is as powerful as God's word.
[time=421] A close second is sometimes how that very scripture and those things that it says about giving and about sacrifice have impacted a life and to hear it not from me but to hear it from the life itself.
[time=434] And so I've asked a good friend of mine and a good friend of ours, Anna, if she would come this morning.
[time=440] Come on up here, Anna.
[time=441] Many of you know, Anna Juri, and I know it has been a joy for me to get to know her these last years.
[time=448] Can I help you with these stairs?
[time=450] - Good. - There you go.
[time=451] - I need it.
[time=452] - Fantastic.
[time=453] This is my good friend, Anna.
[time=457] And Anna and I talk a little bit this week.
[time=460] And I know she has learned quite a bit over the years that God has given her.
[time=465] She has seen and experienced quite a bit as it relates to giving.
[time=469] And I just kind of asked her on the phone of the data, maybe just share with our family briefly what God has taught her over the years about giving.
[time=479] And so Anna, why don't you just share with the folks what he's put on your heart.
[time=483] - All right, the only reason I'm here is because I thought about it is because God has been so good and he is so good.
[time=493] And I felt that maybe if I share something, it might help someone to learn more about really trust in the Lord.
[time=502] My husband and I were the same denomination.
[time=505] So when we went and moved, we automatically went to a church of that denomination.
[time=511] And as I was trying to think back, I guess we'll probably put a few bucks in power doing the Lord of favor.
[time=517] I don't remember too much about the giving.
[time=520] Never heard about the tithe.
[time=521] So later, we're now in Virginia.
[time=527] And we lived there and Mark was a representative and he left in the morning and came back on Friday.
[time=532] And one night I put the boys to bed.
[time=535] I went and sat in the edge of my bed and I looked up to heaven.
[time=539] And I said, Lord, I've had it.
[time=541] I don't know if you're real or if you're not real, but here I am.
[time=545] Well, he was real.
[time=547] And I don't know I had a piece I had never known.
[time=551] Something happened, but I had no idea what happened.
[time=554] But then I began to read the Bible.
[time=556] And as I read the Bible, the one thing that popped out at me that God would like a tithe.
[time=563] Now I realize later on there are more tithes in the Old Testament than one.
[time=567] But I've got my old Bible out and here I had where the verses were.
[time=573] I had tithe written in the margin.
[time=576] And so when my husband came home, of course, I shared much more.
[time=580] But then I shared to him that I think we ought to tie.
[time=584] And he was agreeable, which was very, very, very good.
[time=588] So now we're back in Indiana.
[time=593] And we bought a home in Lincoln Highway in New Haven.
[time=597] And one evening we had Mark had a good job.
[time=601] And one evening he came home and he said, things just aren't very good.
[time=606] I don't like what's going on.
[time=607] What if I quit?
[time=608] OK, that's fine.
[time=610] So that's what he did.
[time=611] And we assumed he was going to get another job right away.
[time=616] Well, God had other plants.
[time=618] And it was over a year before he really got work.
[time=624] But you know, I had not at that time thought I should go to work.
[time=629] Now, you each one have to make your own decision on that, OK?
[time=634] And even when he picked up other jobs, we still took God's portion out of the top.
[time=641] And that was the only year, the only year that my mother put money in an envelope when she wrote.
[time=648] She didn't know Mark didn't have work.
[time=650] I never told her.
[time=652] And so I just thank the Lord for that.
[time=657] We got really down to the bottom of the barrel.
[time=660] And I sat one night and I wrote out.
[time=663] We had a home payment.
[time=665] We had utilities.
[time=666] We had to eat.
[time=668] And God really put us in this home in New Haven.
[time=671] And I said, Lord, you put us in this home.
[time=674] Now you're going to have to take care of us.
[time=676] And it wasn't very long that the park were asked Mark if he'd be the superintendent.
[time=684] It was just what we needed.
[time=686] And so I was excited.
[time=688] And then it wasn't long that he really did get a good job.
[time=694] And then I continued to read the Bible.
[time=696] And there's many more scriptures.
[time=698] But this is one scripture that I pointed out.
[time=700] It was in 2 Corinthians 9, 7.
[time=703] Every man, according as he purposes in his heart, so let him give, not grudgingly or of necessity, for God loves a cheerful giver.
[time=715] So we didn't stay at the tithe.
[time=717] Now, I meant 65.
[time=724] I was on my own.
[time=726] The Lord decided he was going to take Mark home.
[time=729] And I've been with the Lord for a good minute years.
[time=734] And you know, the thing I have found, and I can't explain it, is the more I give, the more God stretches what's left.
[time=744] And I don't understand it, but he does it.
[time=747] And I know he does it.
[time=748] OK.
[time=751] And then I read-- it's in Psalm 24.
[time=756] I've read this many times, but for some reason, one day I read this.
[time=759] And it really hit me.
[time=762] The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof, the world, and all that dwell in it.
[time=771] And it hit me.
[time=772] The Lord is Anna's landlord.
[time=776] I don't know, maybe you've all thought about that, but I hadn't until that particular time.
[time=781] And I figured that God expects Anna to be a good steward of what he has allowed her to have.
[time=791] And then Jesus says, and I was thinking, well, you today, trust me.
[time=796] He says, trust me.
[time=798] But if we're going to be anxious through something, we're not really trusting, right?
[time=803] And so I like to claim verses.
[time=806] And over the past year and a half, there are two specific verses that I have really, really claimed.
[time=812] And one was Mark 1124 and John 1427.
[time=818] And this is what I'd like to leave, and I'd like to say, to the children, to the junior hires, to the teenagers, to the young couples, to the older folks, and to the singles.
[time=831] If you have never trusted the Lord by giving to him off the top,
[time=839] now 10% is a good place to start if you've never done it.
[time=843] Why don't you try it?
[time=846] I don't give expecting God to bless me.
[time=850] But for some reason, the blessings come, the peace comes.
[time=854] And I don't know, I just enjoy doing it.
[time=858] And I thank the Lord, I can do it.
[time=860] But you've got to remember, the giving must come from the heart.
[time=864] But it's not from the heart.
[time=866] I don't think that would be too pleasing to the Lord.
[time=870] So I've walked with the good Lord for many years, and I can look back, and I can reflect how He answered prayer and worked in my life.
[time=880] So I would say, happy giving.
[time=884] [AMEN - 0 seconds]
[time=885] [APPLAUSE]
[time=887] Can you pray for us, can I pray?
[time=889] Sure.
[time=892] Let's pray.
[time=898] Say, after Ty and Anna, there will be no message today.
[time=902] All right?
[time=902] So we'll just sing and go home.
[time=903] What do you say?
[time=904] Thank you, Anna.
[time=905] I mean that.
[time=906] Thank you so much for sharing your heart.
[time=908] God, just having Anna with us this morning reminds us of so many things, one of which is your faithfulness.
[time=916] Your faithfulness to her, and to Mark, and to that family, and God, these years that you've given her, she has been able to, and is today an example to us, of the thing Ty talked about, a trust, and an abandonment to you.
[time=929] God, when that takes place, amazing things follow.
[time=933] And so thank you for her.
[time=935] Love for you, her love for us, and the joy that we have this morning of remembering your faithfulness and your son's name we pray, amen.
[time=942] [AMEN]
[time=943] [MUSIC]
[time=946] Pray his life, faithfulness.
[time=955] Forling my morning, new mercy, Tyxie.
[time=964] All I have seen, is I can't let go by this.
[time=973] Pray his life, faithfulness.
[time=978] Lord unto me, he's here to take it to you.
[time=985] Pray his life, faithfulness.
[time=989] O God, my Father, there is no shadow, what to read with me.
[time=1001] Thou changest of my compassion, when they're lost.
[time=1009] As thou hast been, thou could ever breathe.
[time=1017] Pray his life, faithfulness.
[time=1026] Forling my morning, new mercy, Tyxie.
[time=1034] All I have seen, is I can't let go by this.
[time=1042] Pray his life, faithfulness.
[time=1046] For unto me, God, in good spirit that needs to hang to her.
[time=1060] Thy holy presence, dear and divine.
[time=1068] Stake for today, and I hope for tomorrow.
[time=1076] Blessings of my within, thou can't let go by this.
[time=1084] Pray his life, faithfulness.
[time=1092] Forling my morning, new mercy, Tyxie.
[time=1100] All I have seen, is I can't let go by this.
[time=1109] Pray his life, faithfulness.
[time=1126] For unto you.
[time=1138] Well as I said, we're going to take a week off here from Acts.
[time=1143] And as I mentioned earlier, the thought is that it's good to talk about it.
[time=1147] It's good to raise the issue.
[time=1148] Great to raise the flag.
[time=1149] Great to communicate to the family about our giving situation.
[time=1153] But more than talking about it, we need to make sure that-- now we understand what the truth is about it.
[time=1159] What does God's word teach?
[time=1160] What does the Scriptures say about this issue of giving?
[time=1163] And some of you, many of you, an increasing number of you, are new to our family.
[time=1168] Many of you, having just recently come to Christ.
[time=1171] Many of you, young in the faith.
[time=1172] And so for some this morning, it may be the first chance you've ever had to actually see what God's word has to say about this issue of giving.
[time=1182] Others of you have been around for a long time.
[time=1183] You've heard this again and again.
[time=1186] But as is always the case, even in my own life, when I hear truth, it doesn't matter if I've heard it once or if I've heard it 25 times, to hear truth.
[time=1194] And to be reminded of what God's word says is so very helpful.
[time=1198] And so I would invite all of you this morning to just open your hearts and open your ears to what God's word has to say about giving.
[time=1205] This is not going to be an exhaustive study.
[time=1207] We're going to do our very best in the next 40 minutes to touch on principles.
[time=1211] Truth that can help you think through this in your own life and your own heart and your own home and your own family.
[time=1218] I want to take a close and honest look at the Scriptures, doing our very best to identify principles and truth that can guide us in our endeavor to give in ways that truly honor God.
[time=1231] So here we go.
[time=1232] I want to see for ourselves what the Scriptures have to say.
[time=1236] Last week, I just mentioned briefly to you.
[time=1238] And I want to take you back there just for a moment to Malachi.
[time=1241] Go with me if you would back to the end of your Old Testament, Malachi.
[time=1246] Last book in the Old Testament, Malachi chapter one.
[time=1251] We spent just a few minutes there last week prior to the message from Acts and wanted to just go back and touch on a few things and remind us of something.
[time=1260] Some great Old Testament principles to catch up on.
[time=1264] Malachi chapter one, pick it up with me if you would in verse six.
[time=1267] It says there, a son.
[time=1269] And again, just some backdrop for you.
[time=1270] Again, the Lord is not pleased.
[time=1272] The Lord is disappointed.
[time=1275] The Lord is saddened.
[time=1276] By the way, his people, the people of Israel were bringing their offerings.
[time=1281] And so he says here in verse six, a son honors his father and a servant, his master.
[time=1285] Then if I am a father, where is my honor?
[time=1288] And if I am a master, where is my respect?
[time=1290] Says the Lord of hosts to you.
[time=1292] Oh priests who despise my name.
[time=1294] But you say, how?
[time=1296] How have we despised thy name?
[time=1298] You are presenting defiled food upon my altar.
[time=1302] But you say, how have we defiled thee?
[time=1304] And that you say, the table of the Lord is to be despised.
[time=1307] But when you, here's the answer.
[time=1309] But when you present the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil?
[time=1313] And when you present the lame and sick, is it not evil?
[time=1317] Why not offer it to your governor?
[time=1320] Would he be pleased with you?
[time=1321] Or would he receive you kindly?
[time=1323] Says the Lord of hosts.
[time=1325] Verse 10, oh, oh, there were one among you who would shut the gates that you might not uselessly kindle fire on my altar.
[time=1334] I am not pleased with you, says the Lord of hosts.
[time=1338] Nor will I accept an offering from you.
[time=1342] What had he asked from them?
[time=1344] He had asked from them as they would bring these offerings that with regard to their lambs, their goats, that they would bring to him their very what?
[time=1352] Their very best.
[time=1354] He was looking for the spotless one.
[time=1355] He was looking for the male that was healthy.
[time=1357] He was looking for the very best they had to offer.
[time=1361] And they bring him their lame, and they brought him their sick.
[time=1366] And he says, key phrase, one of the key phrases for me in those passages, in those verses we just read, why not offer it to your governor?
[time=1375] You know what that means?
[time=1377] You know what that says in essence?
[time=1378] And in the vernacular of our day, in essence, what he's saying there is I'm not interested in your leftovers.
[time=1385] And that's exactly what he was bringing, exactly what they were bringing.
[time=1388] They were bringing their leftovers.
[time=1392] And the other thing that strikes me is it's not as if he didn't know.
[time=1396] It's amazing to me that they would bring the lame and the sick, as if he wouldn't see, as if he wouldn't notice, as if he wouldn't be aware of the less than best offering that they were bringing.
[time=1409] And the same holds true for you, and the same holds true for me.
[time=1412] He's not interested in our leftover casserole.
[time=1416] He's not interested in what's in the Tupperware.
[time=1419] He doesn't care about our leftovers.
[time=1421] No, he wants our best.
[time=1424] And he knows.
[time=1425] He knows when you, and he knows when I hold it back from him.
[time=1429] And as it says here in Malachi, it saddens him.
[time=1432] It breaks his heart.
[time=1433] He is not pleased, he said, with them.
[time=1436] Same truth, powerfully illustrated.
[time=1438] Go back to Second Samuel.
[time=1442] Go back to Second Samuel, chapter 24.
[time=1444] Second Samuel, 24, and a great,
[time=1451] great little dialogue here between King David.
[time=1456] Second Samuel, chapter 24, picking it up in verse 18.
[time=1465] Aruna and David.
[time=1470] Some of you may be familiar with this.
[time=1472] Others, it may be the first time.
[time=1473] Listen in.
[time=1474] Says there in verse 18, so Gad came to David that day and said to him, go up.
[time=1479] David erect an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Arona, the Jebusite.
[time=1485] And David went up, according to the word of God, just as the Lord had commanded.
[time=1491] And Aruna looked down and saw the king and his servants crossing over toward him.
[time=1496] And Aruna went out and bowed his face to the ground before the king, then Aruna said, why has my Lord the king come to his servant?
[time=1503] And David said to buy the threshing floor from you in order to build an altar to the Lord that the plague may be held back from the people.
[time=1512] Now Aruna is just blown away by this.
[time=1517] He can't believe it.
[time=1518] And with a well-intending heart, he says, in verse 22, he said to David, let my Lord king take and offer up what is good in his sight.
[time=1526] Look, the oxen for the burnt offering, the threshing sledges and the yolks of the oxen for the wood, everything, O king, Aruna gives to you, the king.
[time=1537] And Aruna said to the king, may the Lord, your God accept you.
[time=1540] Aruna says here, just take it, it's all yours.
[time=1544] Whatever you need around here to build that altar, you just go ahead, king.
[time=1547] It's all yours.
[time=1548] However, the king said to Aruna, no, no.
[time=1552] Verse 24, but I will surely buy it from you for a price, for I will not offer burnt offerings to the Lord my God, which cost me nothing.
[time=1564] So David bought the threshing floor and oxen for 50 shekels of silver.
[time=1570] And David built there an altar to the Lord and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.
[time=1575] And thus the Lord was moved by in treaty for the land and the plague was held back from Israel.
[time=1582] David says, my offering will hurt me.
[time=1585] My offering will cost me.
[time=1587] My offering will force me toward greater levels of faith.
[time=1591] That's how he approached it.
[time=1594] That's how he thought, that's how he lived.
[time=1595] My gift will put me out on a limb, out on a dock.
[time=1600] My offering, my gift, what I bring will put me out there.
[time=1606] I love that.
[time=1608] I don't know how you are personally myself.
[time=1611] And again, sometimes it takes me just a little bit to get there, but once there I tend to have grown over the years to love.
[time=1617] And get excited about limb experiences because limb experiences grow you.
[time=1623] Lim experiences build you up.
[time=1625] I love it.
[time=1626] I love being stretched.
[time=1627] I love being tested.
[time=1628] I love seeing what God's gonna do in my life.
[time=1631] And I know many of you are the same way.
[time=1633] A limb is scary.
[time=1634] A limb that's getting thinner.
[time=1636] A limb that's starting to sag.
[time=1638] It's sometimes not a fun place to be, but you know if you are there.
[time=1642] And you're walking in confidence and walking in assurance of your love and relationship with him, you know.
[time=1648] And you begin to see again and again his presence with you on that limb.
[time=1652] When trust grows, faith deepens.
[time=1657] And that's what walking on a limb does.
[time=1660] When trust grows, faith deepens.
[time=1664] I read this somewhere and I just copied it down.
[time=1667] When trust grows, faith deepens.
[time=1669] And when faith deepens, obedience to him escalates.
[time=1674] Think about it.
[time=1675] It's really true.
[time=1676] When trust grows, faith deepens.
[time=1679] And when your faith is deepened and strengthened, obedience and your willingness to then do the things you've been asked to do, your willingness to obey escalates.
[time=1690] Trust me, he says.
[time=1692] Trust me.
[time=1693] Malachi three, jump back to Malachi real quick.
[time=1703] Malachi chapter three, go to verse seven.
[time=1708] Some said, okay, okay, we'll give.
[time=1713] Okay, okay, we'll bring our offerings, relax.
[time=1716] But in the bringing of the offering, some still we're holding back.
[time=1720] Look at what it says there in verse seven.
[time=1723] From the days of your fathers, Malachi chapter three, verse seven.
[time=1726] From the days of your fathers, you have turned aside from my statutes and have not kept them.
[time=1730] Return to me and I will return to you, says the Lord of hosts.
[time=1734] But you say, how?
[time=1735] How shall we return?
[time=1737] Well, a man robbed God, yet you are robbing me, he says.
[time=1742] But you say, how have we robbed thee in tithes and offerings?
[time=1746] You are cursed with a curse for you are robbing me the whole nation of you.
[time=1751] Verse 10, here's the explanation.
[time=1753] What God says is bring the whole tithe into the storehouse so that there may be food in my house.
[time=1760] And test me now in this, says the Lord of hosts.
[time=1763] If I will not open for you the windows of heaven and pour out for you a blessing until it overflows.
[time=1771] He says, trust me, really, really trust me.
[time=1778] And whatever it is, as Anna mentioned in 1 Corinthians nine, we're to give what God has put on our hearts.
[time=1783] Whatever it is I've put on your heart as you've considered sacrificially giving.
[time=1788] Giving in ways that it hurts.
[time=1791] Whatever that is that comes to mind.
[time=1792] Whatever it is that's solidified in your heart.
[time=1795] On the way to the storehouse, don't hold back.
[time=1798] No, God says, bring it all to me.
[time=1800] And I will pour out blessing.
[time=1802] That doesn't mean the lottery.
[time=1804] That doesn't mean instant wealth.
[time=1806] That doesn't mean, no, what it means is he'll bless you.
[time=1809] What it means is he will honor you.
[time=1813] What it means is he will take care of you.
[time=1817] I read Malachi three and I'm reminded of conversations I've had that have gone like this.
[time=1822] I'm not making it each month giving 5%.
[time=1826] Some would say, and you want me to give 10.
[time=1828] And I understand that.
[time=1832] I've said that, I've asked that, I've lived in that tension.
[time=1835] I'm very familiar with that mindset.
[time=1837] I've articulated those very words myself in my life.
[time=1840] But when I look at Malachi three, it reminds me that the response you might have to that, the response that he would have for that is that maybe you're not making it on five because you're not giving what?
[time=1851] 10 or whatever.
[time=1853] The sacrificial amount is that he would put in place on your heart.
[time=1857] And again, I'm just using 10% as a guide in the Old Testament.
[time=1861] That's one of the ties that they were given the opportunity to give.
[time=1867] And so we use it as we talk about the Old Testament as we transition to the New Testament.
[time=1872] We see that 10% figure go away.
[time=1874] And instead, as we'll see in a moment, it begins to be sacrificial off the top, as Anna said.
[time=1881] Two principles that guide us in the New Testament.
[time=1883] For some, I realize, even if we just
[time=1889] stay with the 10% figure, please hear me on this.
[time=1892] For some, I realize 10% is a stretch.
[time=1897] That is an enormous stretch, a very thin limb experience.
[time=1903] For many in this family, 10% doesn't come close to being costly or sacrificial.
[time=1911] God says he will honor and bless the giver who's willing to hold nothing back, nothing back that should and can be offered.
[time=1921] Well, let me have you write this down.
[time=1923] Mark 12, Mark 12, 41 to 47.
[time=1929] Mark 12, 41 to 47.
[time=1932] And turn there if you would too.
[time=1935] Talk about not holding anything back.
[time=1939] Talk about not keeping anything from him that could be given.
[time=1946] Mark 12, verse 41, we see here the story of the widow
[time=1952] and her sacrifice.
[time=1954] It's the very passage that Amy recited for us as our service began this morning.
[time=1960] And it says in Mark 12, 41, and he set down opposite the treasury and began observing how the multitudes were putting money into the treasury.
[time=1967] And many rich people were putting in large sums.
[time=1971] And a poor widow, verse 42, came and put in two small copper coins, which amount to a cent.
[time=1977] And calling his disciples to him, he said to them, "Truly I say to you, a phrase often used by our Lord as he taught, which signified and indicated to his followers, this is important.
[time=1991] Don't miss this.
[time=1993] Listen in.
[time=1994] Truly I say to you, verse 43, this poor widow put in more
[time=2000] than all the contributors to the treasury, for they all put in out of their-- what does your translation say?
[time=2008] Sir plus, what else?
[time=2010] Wealth, anything else?
[time=2013] Abundance.
[time=2014] They put in out of their leftovers.
[time=2017] They're cracking open the Tupperware.
[time=2021] They're bringing in last night spaghetti.
[time=2024] They're bringing in out of their extra.
[time=2030] She gave-- what does it say?
[time=2033] All she had, verse 44, for they all put in out of their surplus, but she out of her poverty put in all she owned.
[time=2039] And if they didn't quite get the message on that, all she owned, he got more specific form.
[time=2043] All she had to live on.
[time=2048] She puts in everything she had.
[time=2054] Question for you this morning.
[time=2055] What would it be like?
[time=2057] Just try.
[time=2058] Just try and imagine this one.
[time=2060] Imagine that plate coming by you like it did this morning.
[time=2064] Imagine a chance to give.
[time=2066] What would it be like to give an amount some Sunday morning?
[time=2072] Knowing beyond a shadow of a doubt, knowing that utter poverty would immediately follow.
[time=2080] Let's go ahead and try and wrap your arms around that one.
[time=2088] What would it be like to give, knowing that utter and total poverty would immediately follow this gift that you gave, her trust, her faith,
[time=2099] her abandonment, that evident, that obvious.
[time=2102] We can't leave this passage, and we're going to here soon.
[time=2104] But we can't leave this passage without reminding those who have been blessed.
[time=2109] Those who have been blessed above and beyond.
[time=2111] And there are many.
[time=2114] Look at what it says in verse 41.
[time=2118] Look at what it says there, how the multitude we're putting money into the treasury and many rich people we're putting in, what does it say there?
[time=2126] Large sums.
[time=2129] And these large sums that he draws attention to here in verse 41 are then in the remainder of the passage kind of held up in comparison to the widow's pennies.
[time=2142] Reminding us of this, the danger of wealth,
[time=2148] the danger of wealth as it relates to giving is that sometimes enormous amounts, right?
[time=2155] Sometimes enormous amounts, though enormous, in and of themselves still aren't, what?
[time=2164] Sacrificial.
[time=2167] It's one of the dangers that you who have been blessed, above and beyond.
[time=2171] And that's a good thing.
[time=2173] It's a very good thing.
[time=2176] But the danger therein is, again, sometimes enormous amounts aren't really enormous because they don't really cost.
[time=2183] It still comes back to whether you've been enormously blessed or whether you're barely getting by, the principle still holds true.
[time=2190] What will you give up in order to give in a costly manner?
[time=2195] And she, in this passage, she illustrates that powerfully for us.
[time=2200] Same holds true for both ends.
[time=2202] Well, let's look at the early church.
[time=2204] Great principles in the Old Testament.
[time=2206] Great principles in the Gospels.
[time=2209] But let's look at the early church.
[time=2210] And we'll see next week in Acts 2.
[time=2212] And we'll see in a few more weeks in Acts 4 some amazing giving.
[time=2217] We'll see more than amazing giving.
[time=2218] We'll see some amazing hearts.
[time=2220] We'll see some perspectives that will, again, blow your mind and mind all over again.
[time=2224] As we watch this early church respond, as we watch this early church kind of get a grip on this thing called possessions and giving.
[time=2233] But this morning, I want us to look at 2 Corinthians, chapter 8.
[time=2237] A little later in the New Testament, we see a tremendous example here of a body of believers who were willing to give.
[time=2245] And again, this morning, our intent is to just try and surface as many principles as we can about this topic so that your heart and mind can be challenged all over again with regard to the Scriptures.
[time=2255] Second Corinthians, chapter 8.
[time=2258] And here we get a clear and insightful picture of how this body, this body of believers, approached and lived out this issue of giving.
[time=2268] And there's several points I want to draw your attention to here to take note of as these Macedonians.
[time=2274] Here we'll look at the Macedonian church in 2 Corinthians 8.
[time=2278] We're going to see how they lived, how they approached, how they thought, how they chose with regard to giving.
[time=2283] The early church gave.
[time=2285] The Macedonian church gave.
[time=2288] Number one, in their affliction.
[time=2290] Now, brethren, we wish to make known to you.
[time=2291] This is Paul talking.
[time=2293] It says in 2 Corinthians 8.1, we wish to make known to you the grace of God, which has been given in the churches of Macedonia, that in a great ordeal of affliction,
[time=2306] their abundance of joy and their deep poverty overflowed in the wealth of their liberality.
[time=2311] Back to the top of verse 2, that in a great ordeal of affliction, the Macedonian church, the early church gave.
[time=2319] Number one, write it down in their affliction.
[time=2323] They gave in their affliction.
[time=2325] They chose, it seems, from what the text reveals, they chose to face trial, and they chose to face stress, and they chose to face painful circumstances.
[time=2337] And their response was, hey, let's give.
[time=2342] Let's give.
[time=2344] And too many times in your life, and too many times in my life,
[time=2351] my trial, and my stress, and my painful circumstances, brings about in me, not that attitude, but what is, in essence, really the opposite, an attitude that demands relief.
[time=2364] And you live with that, and you see that, and I live with it, and see it myself, it's everywhere.
[time=2368] It's absolutely rampant.
[time=2370] Trouble, pressure, difficulty, pain, I want relief.
[time=2375] I must have relief, I need to relax, I need to replenish, which at times is true.
[time=2385] I realize that.
[time=2386] I'm aware of that.
[time=2387] At times, that's true, and at times, that would be the healthy choice.
[time=2392] But sometimes, though, it's amazing to see the replenishing power of the sacrificial act.
[time=2401] The relaxation brought about by giving.
[time=2404] There's something, and I don't just mean financially.
[time=2407] I'm including financial giving, but I'm just talking about the mindset of how about if I bring something to the table, how about if I, in my affliction, might be willing to offer myself in some form or fashion.
[time=2419] There is something energizing.
[time=2422] And I've seen it again and again over the years with moms.
[time=2425] I've seen it with wives, I've seen it with husbands and men, with friends and crisis, with kids, with young and old.
[time=2431] There is something energizing about sacrifice,
[time=2437] people on the brink finding hope and strength, not by what they get, but by what they're willing to give.
[time=2445] And not by what they're willing to give out of all the strength they can muster know of people willing to give because they've abandoned themselves to the person of Christ.
[time=2457] And in relationship with him, find again and again and again, new mercies and new strength every morning to get up and do and to be what God's called them to do and be.
[time=2472] These people in their affliction gave and their willingness to sacrifice and their willingness to give brought about what?
[time=2479] We'll keep going there in verse two, that in a great ordeal of affliction, their abundance of what did it bring?
[time=2485] What did your Bible say?
[time=2486] Joy, their affliction and their willingness to maintain
[time=2492] and move forward brought about it says an abundance of joy and their deep poverty overflowed in the wealth of their liberality.
[time=2501] Verse three, for I testify that according to their ability and beyond their ability, stop right there.
[time=2510] Second thing you want to write down is that they gave not only in their affliction, but secondly in their poverty.
[time=2517] This early church gave in their poverty.
[time=2520] These people were in no position.
[time=2523] Humanly speaking, these people were in no position to give.
[time=2528] Humanly speaking, they were in position to go chapter 11.
[time=2532] Humanly speaking, they were in position of having absolutely nothing.
[time=2537] Their poverty was deep.
[time=2539] They were broke.
[time=2541] And the passage tells us out of their brokenness,
[time=2547] which is always a good place to begin.
[time=2551] Out of their brokenness, they're overflowed a liberal, generous gift.
[time=2558] Simply said, they gave more than they had.
[time=2561] Interesting thought, they gave more than they had.
[time=2567] You see the more, the more I read, the more I study, the more you take a close look at this band of believers
[time=2578] back in the book of Acts, the more you study, the mindset and the attitude of those who forged this path that we walk on today.
[time=2586] The more you look at the life and more importantly, the hearts of those in the early church, the more you realize that a picture begins to develop of a people who exercised a bold and reckless faith.
[time=2601] And with what they'd been given, there were no clenched fists or better said clenched hearts.
[time=2611] It was all, it's all right there.
[time=2616] Life and giving was God-centered.
[time=2625] And did they give begrudgingly?
[time=2629] Did they give with an attitude?
[time=2630] Did they give disparagingly?
[time=2632] No, no, no, go back to verse three.
[time=2635] For I testify that according to their ability and beyond their ability, they gave of their own accord.
[time=2644] Verse four, begging, begging us, it says, with much in treaty for the favor of participation in the support of the saints.
[time=2657] It says of their own accord.
[time=2660] It was their own doing.
[time=2661] It overflowed from their own hearts, from their own minds, from their own desire to be a part of what God was doing.
[time=2667] They prayed about it, they thought it through, they considered the sacrifice and in the midst of affliction and in the midst of joy and in the midst of poverty, they verse four, they bend.
[time=2678] Oh, please, please Paul, let us give.
[time=2681] They begged for the privilege of giving their gift.
[time=2687] They begged for the privilege of being a part of what God was doing in their midst and what God was doing elsewhere.
[time=2695] And in this case, it was an elsewhere thing and they said, oh, please, we have nothing.
[time=2700] We are in affliction, but oh, please, let us give.
[time=2704] And that heart and that mindset and that perspective,
[time=2710] there's something there, people, I think, for the spirit of God and the word of God, as it works in your mind and in your life and then you as a couple or you as an individual or you as a family, there's something there, I think worthy of considering, I really do.
[time=2730] Some questions to ask, some truth for you to take home and consider, I want to spend a little bit of time
[time=2741] talking about this if we can, some questions to ask.
[time=2744] Hey, kids, let me talk to you for a moment.
[time=2748] Kids, third graders, fourth graders, fifth graders, junior high students, high school students, how would you grade yourselves this morning?
[time=2759] You're sitting there thinking, wow, you're talking to me, I thought you were talking to my parents.
[time=2763] No, no, no, no, I'm talking to you.
[time=2765] I'm talking to those of you in this family, third grade up through high school, that call this place home, who today have a relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=2776] If in fact that's you, you're part of this family, you're part of this local fellowship.
[time=2781] And the same things that God's word calls me to give attention to, it calls you to give attention to, as a believer, kids, students, how would you grade yourselves with respect to your sacrificial giving?
[time=2794] You know what you guys, there's a lot out there, kids.
[time=2798] Students, I realize this, there's a lot out there.
[time=2802] A lot of places for you to go, a lot of places for you to spend, a lot of things to get, video games, computer games.
[time=2811] A lot of them are really fun too, I know that personally, enjoy them immensely.
[time=2818] Close, close, entertainment, sports equipment.
[time=2824] There's a lot out there, kids, students.
[time=2831] A lot for you to buy, a lot for you to purchase, a lot for you to have, a lot for you to enjoy.
[time=2837] And I don't know how it works in your home, it's not the issue, it may be an allowance that you get.
[time=2844] You may just be, you know, you may be given certain amounts of money, you may have some jobs that you need to do, there may be some things that are expected of you and you may get in a sense paid for that.
[time=2856] Many of you may have part-time jobs.
[time=2858] What are you doing with every penny that you get?
[time=2865] Every penny that you earn, now at this stage in life, are you thinking about it, and are you realizing the opportunity that you have to be a part of what God is doing?
[time=2877] Grate yourself, think that through.
[time=2881] Allowance money, job money.
[time=2882] Adults, let me ask you this, adults, moms, dads,
[time=2889] grandparents, the question for you is what have your kids seen you go without as you model sacrificial living and giving?
[time=2898] What is the next generation of the church learning as they watch you give?
[time=2905] Are you modeling a giving that is sacrificial or are you modeling a giving that is selective?
[time=2912] They watch, they don't miss a thing, they see it all.
[time=2920] They could name for you the last 10 purchases you made.
[time=2925] They don't miss a thing.
[time=2928] And way beyond the purchases and way beyond the investments and way beyond whatever it is you've been buying or acquiring, they see that, that's true, but way beyond that they see this.
[time=2939] They see the heart and they see the attitude and they see and sense the mindset.
[time=2945] And it sinks into their hearts and minds and it becomes theirs.
[time=2949] Adults, what is the next generation of the church learning as they watch and live life with you as it relates to giving?
[time=2957] Another question for you this morning, how often are you as a family or a small group?
[time=2965] You may have a family, you may not.
[time=2966] In some small group of friends or in your own home, your mom and dad or mom and the kids or dad and the kids, however it works for you, how often are you as a family taking the time to brainstorm and share ideas and pray in an effort to find ways to give as much as you can or more?
[time=2984] Would you be willing to take time as a family, to go back to 2 Samuel 24, to go back to Malachi chapter three, to go to the widow in Mark chapter 12, would you be willing dads to take 30 minutes tonight or Tuesday or Thursday and gather the troops and say, hey gang, let's be reminded as a family what it says and having looked at those passages you could even as a family go to flip over to 2 Corinthians chapter nine and I referred to this earlier, I want to read this to you.
[time=3021] 2 Corinthians chapter nine and there's a reason I want to read this verse in the context of asking you as families to sit down and think this through and talk this through.
[time=3029] It says in 2 Corinthians nine, picking it up in verse six.
[time=3032] Now this I say, he who sows sparingly, shall also reap sparingly and he who sows bountifully shall also reap bountifully.
[time=3045] Let each one do just as he has purposed in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion for God loves a cheerful giver and God is able to make all grace abound to you that always having all sufficiency in everything you may have an abundance for every good deed.
[time=3068] Dads, moms, do you realize how rich those three verses are?
[time=3074] I mean, there are some great where you could sit down and you could get the troops together and act out that passage.
[time=3080] I mean, look at the words in there.
[time=3081] He who sows bountifully.
[time=3086] Well, what does that mean?
[time=3087] Mom, dad sowing bountifully.
[time=3090] Is that what grandma does when she nits?
[time=3092] They don't know what sowing bountifully means.
[time=3095] So explain it to him.
[time=3097] Show him the word picture.
[time=3098] Teach him that whole idea of sowing and reaping.
[time=3101] He who sows bountifully shall also reap bountifully.
[time=3105] What does that mean?
[time=3106] Explain it to him.
[time=3107] Teach it to him.
[time=3108] Talk about it with him.
[time=3110] Let each one do as he has purposed in his heart, not grudgingly.
[time=3114] Well, what's grudgingly mean, dad?
[time=3117] Mom, you could give an example, I'm sure, from what you live with during the day.
[time=3121] You could explain to them and illustrate for them from their own lives what it means to do something grudgingly.
[time=3129] God is able to make all grace abound to you that always having all sufficiency in everything you may have an abundance.
[time=3135] When's the last time you told your kids?
[time=3139] When's the last time you looked them in the eye?
[time=3141] Third graders, five-year-olds, 18-year-olds, 14-year-olds.
[time=3145] When's the last time you looked them in the eye and said, hey, let's just be reminded.
[time=3148] We'll just take 10 minutes.
[time=3150] Better remind this family how good God has been to us.
[time=3157] Oh, we've had some hard times, oh, we've had some tough days.
[time=3160] Oh, we've had some difficult roads to travel, but boy, he has been good.
[time=3165] And kids, you can't forget it.
[time=3166] When's the last time they heard you say that?
[time=3168] Talk about that.
[time=3169] Ask these kinds of questions.
[time=3170] Spend this kind of time.
[time=3172] You can do it.
[time=3174] Make the time.
[time=3176] Set the appointment.
[time=3178] Get the kids together.
[time=3180] Get the group of friends together.
[time=3181] Have these kinds of conversations.
[time=3186] In fact, I'll just throw this out to you.
[time=3187] Why don't you as a family?
[time=3188] Why don't you as a family or you as a small group?
[time=3192] Why don't you memorize Second Corinthians 9, 6-8?
[time=3197] Memorize it.
[time=3197] Commit it to memory.
[time=3199] Talk about it during the week.
[time=3200] Read it again and again.
[time=3202] Give some thought to it.
[time=3204] I wanna make sure that as a family, and I wanna make sure that those who are listening, by way of the Bible hour, I wanna make sure that everybody who's in earshot of what we're talking about this morning, because this is about our family.
[time=3220] That's true, but it's not just about our family.
[time=3224] It's about, and this truth is for everyone who would call the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, everyone who would claim to be in relationship and live in relationship with Him, all of us.
[time=3235] God has called us to given ways that are sacrificial, to given ways like David gave, to given ways like the widow gave, to given ways that this early church gave.
[time=3249] And so I hope this morning, and our hope for you as a leadership, as we've sat down and thought this through, as we've talked about this, this morning's not about what we need necessarily.
[time=3260] Us doing a message on giving.
[time=3263] This is not some desperate act.
[time=3264] I think we're gonna be all right.
[time=3267] I think God's gonna provide for us, and I think He's going to provide for us through faithful hearts who are willing to hear the Word of God and see truth and be reminded of how we're to live and give.
[time=3278] We're not desperate, we're not panicked.
[time=3282] We're excited to bring the truth of God's Word to this family and to those who listen and say, "Hey, give it some thought.
[time=3289] "Consider what it says." Because as we've said before, as we look forward to the next six or seven weeks, which are going to be very important for this family, we're gonna give it some time and see what He does and see how we respond.
[time=3305] And we're not going to go to anybody.
[time=3308] We're not going to go to individual or individuals.
[time=3313] We are going to keep ongoing week after week praying that the family of Blackhawk will be the family of Blackhawk and that young and old alike would be willing to prayerfully consider and open their hearts and minds to the truth of God's Word and say, "God, how could you use me?" Even more so, how could I be a part of what you're doing in this place?
[time=3340] And we will trust the Holy Spirit and the Word of God to do its work and we'll leave it at that.
[time=3346] And so I ask you again as a family to consider.
[time=3349] I'm asking you as moms and dads to teach and model.
[time=3352] I'm asking you as men and women, young and old, to give thought.
[time=3357] Gonna get a letter in the next week or so.
[time=3359] We're gonna talk through a little bit more of this.
[time=3361] And then you know what?
[time=3361] You're not gonna hear a whole lot more.
[time=3363] Unless you need to.
[time=3364] We trust in him and we trust in his spirit and we trust in his Word and I trust you as a family to respond in ways that would honor and glorify him.
[time=3375] Let me ask you to stand if you wouldn't.
[time=3376] Let's close in a word of prayer.
[time=3379] Father, we bow before you this morning
[time=3387] and we as a family, as a group of people.
[time=3390] So many of us here having tasted of your forgiveness, knowing in ways that are so very encouraging to even remember and recall God, knowing of your goodness and the way that you have provided and the way that you have been there.
[time=3409] God, you're a, you're amazing grace and the needs that you meet day after, day after day.
[time=3415] God, as a people who are very familiar with that, we come before you this morning and we ask God that your faithfulness and your goodness would be for us a reminder.
[time=3427] And God that these truths would remind us of how very important it is that we would be willing to give and that we would even get past percentages, that we would get past numbers and God simply and only stand before you with our hearts open wide, asking you to lead, asking you to guide, asking you to an individual circumstances and situations, God to help your people know what it is that their gifts should be on a regular basis.
[time=3458] God, that is our prayer.
[time=3460] We want this place to be all that you would want it to be.
[time=3464] We want this ministry to reach all that you would want it to reach.
[time=3467] God, we want to do things, give ourselves to things and be a part of things here.
[time=3472] And we know that it is your desire that so many in this community would come to know you, to see you and to realize relationship with you.
[time=3482] And so God will continue to give ourselves to that and will continue to give ourselves to the process of giving.
[time=3488] And we ask God that you would lead and that you would direct and that we would respond in a way that would bring glory and honor to you.
[time=3498] God, we ask these things in your son's name and all the people agreed and said amen.
