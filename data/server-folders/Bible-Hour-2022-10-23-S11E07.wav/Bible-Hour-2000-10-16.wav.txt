[time=92] [MUSIC - 75 seconds]
[time=172] Today, in our time together, we have the privilege of continuing on our study of the book of Acts. And we're loving the book and loving what it's teaching us and reminding us of.
[time=182] And today, we're going to see some things about a church. We've labeled it four active ingredients in a healthy church, four things that make a church a real, live, vibrant church.
[time=194] And I wanted to just take a couple of minutes and share with those of you viewing on the Bible Hour one thing, and that is this.
[time=200] These four things, just to give you a preview, are the teaching of God's Word, that sweet fellowship, which the New Testament called Koine Nia, and the remembering of Christ's death around the table of communion, and then prayer.
[time=215] And then prayer, the church gathering together to pray all of those things. When those things happen in the church, when the church gathered, participates in and gives themselves to teaching and communion and fellowship and prayer, exciting things happen.
[time=230] I realize many of you have places where you go and those things take place, and for that we're grateful.
[time=237] I also realize that some of you aren't even able to get out and about, and so for you, the opportunity to view this is something that means a great deal to you.
[time=246] And I'm thankful for that, but I also realize, we realize that there are many of you out there, and you don't get the opportunity, and you don't get the privilege.
[time=254] You get this coming into your home through television, but you miss out on the sweet thing we get to take part in, which is the teaching, and the fellowship, and the prayer, and the communion together.
[time=266] And so I just wanted to say to you again, our doors are open. We would love to, and look forward to the chance of having more and more of you come and take part in those four things with us in this place as a family.
[time=280] So don't forget the doors are open. We'd love to see you, and we'll look forward to seeing you hopefully soon.
[time=296] [MUSIC - 175 seconds]
[time=476] [APPLAUSE]
[time=483] Well, here we are, Acts chapter 2, and this unfolding story continues, and it gets even more exciting this morning as we look at the end of chapter 2.
[time=491] You know, in 13 years of ministry, I have seen personally dozens of church startups, dozens of church plants, if you will.
[time=501] Church planting endeavors, small bands of believers joining together to start churches, reach communities for Christ, and hopefully make a difference for all of eternity.
[time=512] The sad and embarrassing truth, though, is that too many times these life-giving endeavors have died, imploding all over themselves before ever leaving the ground, or having just recently left the ground exploding.
[time=530] Failing miserably soon after their departure.
[time=534] Why? Why does it happen?
[time=536] Well, I even actually started to keep a list as the years went by, a list of reasons why I was aware of certain church planting endeavors had failed.
[time=546] I list a few of them before you hear this morning.
[time=549] Reasons why some brand new church endeavors failed.
[time=552] Number one, I can think back to about 10 years ago, a group of 10 that I knew of split because they couldn't decide on a name.
[time=561] I wanted to start a church, but couldn't decide on a name so much so they split over it.
[time=567] Another group of 20 split and scattered because they couldn't agree on a preference of music.
[time=574] One group of 15 or 20 actually turned into 125 people in about two years, and then down the road the thing exploded.
[time=583] As they entered their first new building project, you see carpet colors couldn't be agreed to.
[time=589] Office sizes began to be debated.
[time=593] Debt, no debt began to tear at the fabric of their union, and the sign in this one church, I remember the sign out in front.
[time=602] There was argument, heated debate on what the sign would look like, wood or plastic.
[time=610] These being just a few of the earth shattering issues that divided churches and kept the truth from being proclaimed to a people in need.
[time=621] Well you know in our study of the book of Acts this morning we come to a passage that describes a new church plant.
[time=627] A small band of believers who followed our Lord were willing to proclaim the truth, and in turn were given the privilege of birthing a local fellowship, a brand new church.
[time=638] And this morning I want desperately.
[time=641] This morning I want deeply free to see and sense more than anything else, not just that they birthed a church,
[time=648] but more importantly my hope and my prayer is for you today that you would see and that you would sense how they did church,
[time=656] how they approached church, how they carried themselves and functioned with each other in the midst of this thing they called a church,
[time=664] not just that they birthed one, but how they did it, and how they handled each other in the midst of that,
[time=671] and what got kept most important and the priorities I want you to see and I want you to sense.
[time=677] They're love for God, and they're love for each other, and they're love for those on the outside looking in, allowed them to birth a church.
[time=688] And we'll see here in Acts 2 we're going to pick it up in verse 41, move our way down through verse 47.
[time=693] And what we're going to see here in this passage, very important for you to see.
[time=697] It's very important for us to understand, it's very important for us to wrap the arms of our hearts around these things,
[time=704] because people, this is where it begins, this is absolutely fundamental to a church being a church.
[time=714] And so this morning we're going to look at the active ingredients in a local church, the active ingredients.
[time=724] Now why do I say active ingredients? Well, follow me here.
[time=728] I've got a box, which a product was in, I took the product out, and I've got the box up here, and I've got this box laid down flat.
[time=739] It's a secret, nobody can see, get that camera out of here now.
[time=743] We don't want anybody to see this, it's a box, and there was a product in the box.
[time=748] And I'm going to name for you, I'm going to read off to you, the inactive ingredients of the product that was in this box.
[time=757] All right, pharmacists can't play today, all right, be quiet.
[time=762] Pharmaceutical reps, you can't play today, all right, you've got to be quiet.
[time=766] And the question is for the rest of you, what am I describing?
[time=769] And if you know, there's no way, you have to be really, really smart to know.
[time=774] So if you're really, really smart, you can't play either.
[time=777] Where'd I go here, where'd I go? Oh geez, where'd it go, where'd it go?
[time=782] Oh, here we go, all right, you ready? What am I talking about?
[time=787] Cross-Carmelosodium, FD&C Rhett No. 40, FD&C Yellow No. 6, gelatin, glycerin, hydroxyl melicellulose, iron oxides,
[time=797] lecithin, pharmaceutical glaze.
[time=800] Now I'm looking at your eyes and faces, and I'm not seeing the nickel drop, and the light go on.
[time=805] I see a lot of blank stares.
[time=808] There's a few really, really smart ones going like this.
[time=811] But what am I talking about here? Now, said he didn't even give you a chance to answer.
[time=816] Now if I read to you the active ingredient, watch the eyes light up, watch the nickels drop, and the lights go on.
[time=824] Active ingredient, there's one, ibuprofen.
[time=830] What am I talking about? Right here, Advil, right.
[time=835] See, I say ibuprofen, the whole church goes, "Oh, Advil."
[time=841] Active ingredient, it's the one thing that makes this, this, right?
[time=849] Now what if I were to read to you some inactive ingredients of another something?
[time=858] What if I were to read to you a list of inactive ingredients that went like this, paid staff?
[time=864] Paid staff, buildings, a budget.
[time=870] Think now.
[time=872] Paid staff, buildings, a budget, and let's say some classrooms.
[time=877] Would one immediately deduce from that list of inactive ingredients that we were talking about a church?
[time=885] Careful now. Would one immediately deduce that from a list of those kinds of things we were talking about, a local body, a fellowship?
[time=896] I don't think so. I can think of 10 things that have paid staffs. Can you?
[time=902] I can think of 10 things that have buildings and classrooms and budgets.
[time=906] We would need to identify the what? The active ingredients that make a church a church. Think about it.
[time=915] In fact, go ahead and get your pens out. You got some note pages there.
[time=919] We're providing those for you these days. If you didn't get one, they're offered at the desk out front.
[time=923] Get a piece of paper. Go ahead. I mean it. Get a pen out. Get something to write with.
[time=926] And I want to ask you that before I, and don't look at chapter 2, verse 42 yet. All right, no cheating.
[time=933] I would love to just give you the chance to, in your own heart and mind, just I'm going to get you a few seconds here.
[time=937] But go ahead. Write a few things down. Write a few things that in your mind and in your heart would classify as active ingredients.
[time=944] Way past classrooms, way past budgets. No, no, no. These things that you're about to write down, they make a church a church.
[time=952] What is it? Go ahead. Write it down. Think about it. Kids, you too.
[time=957] You've got a place there on your seekers and sneakers sheets to write it down. What makes a church so special?
[time=964] What makes a church a church? Are you writing? Good. Keep writing. Keep thinking.
[time=972] And let's look at Acts. Chapter 2, we're going to find here in this first, in these first couple verses.
[time=979] We're going to start in verse 41, and then you're going to see in verse 42, four things. Four of the active, the active ingredients in a local church.
[time=987] Let's pick it up, verse 41. So then those who had received his word, now we're back to where we left off two weeks ago.
[time=994] Peter has just delivered this amazing message, this picture of Christ. And it says in verse 41, those who had received his word were baptized.
[time=1002] And there were added that day about 3,000 souls, verse 42, and they were continually devoting themselves to the apostles' teaching
[time=1013] and to fellowship to the breaking of bread and to prayer. And we'll stop right there.
[time=1020] Active ingredient number one, write it down. The teaching of God's Word. Teaching. Teaching. Their first priority was to the teaching of the scriptures.
[time=1032] The people listened. The apostles taught. Most likely they taught from the Old Testament and from the recent and very words of Christ Himself.
[time=1041] And this was the starting point for all spiritual growth and development in their lives and in the life of that church.
[time=1049] The teaching of the Word of God, the taking in of truth.
[time=1054] Active ingredient number one, you see sound, practical, doctrinally solid, biblical teaching was to them what milk is to a baby.
[time=1063] It's like rain to a crop. It's like air to a pair of lungs. You've got to have it. It's got to be there or you're in trouble.
[time=1073] In a regular diet, your regular diet, or my regular diet, a diet that would neglect the taking in of sound, biblical truth, will produce an undernourished, write these things down.
[time=1091] It will produce. You've seen it and I've seen it and we see it again and again and again. Wish we didn't, but it will produce an undernourished, emaciated, weak and endangered Christian.
[time=1105] Endangered. Why do we say that?
[time=1108] What's endangering about neglecting the intake of God's Word? Without it. Without the scriptures, without the truth.
[time=1117] The strength and the wisdom provided only by God's Word would be missed and that person will get their spiritual, emotional, personal clock cleaned.
[time=1129] Every time. Young, middle-aged and old alike. You will fail miserably. The enemy will clean your clock as you try, as you attempt to somehow live life, facing all that you and I have to face.
[time=1144] Without the very thing that sustains and strengthens the human soul. And that is the truth. That's why Peter himself, Peter, our own Peter from right here at the beginning of Acts.
[time=1154] That's why he himself later, in the divinely inspired epistle that he wrote, said in 1 Peter 2, 2, and write this down, please.
[time=1162] 1 Peter 2, 2 Peter himself said like newborn babes long or as some translations might read, crave.
[time=1172] He says like new babies. You and I are to long for. We are to crave the Word of God, the truth.
[time=1181] Your milk, he says, of the Word, that by it you may grow in respect to salvation.
[time=1188] The taking in of God's Word, the taking in of the truth, happened for them as they gathered and the same holds true for you and for me today.
[time=1198] That's why we gather. That's why we come together here.
[time=1202] We come together in this place every Sunday morning. We come together in this place every Wednesday night and our attempt is to really do one thing and one thing only.
[time=1210] Just provide a setting for those of you that know him, for those of you that need him, for those of you that need to come into a room and be encouraged and refreshed and pointed again in a right direction.
[time=1220] We come into this place to worship our God and to have the Word of God taught, explained, set before us.
[time=1230] And when it gets set before us and when it gets taught and when it gets explained by me or anyone else, therein lies life.
[time=1238] Those are the words that we hang on to. Those are the truths that we live by. Those are the reminders that we need.
[time=1244] Teaching, the teaching of God's Word, the listening to the teaching of God's Word, the taking in of the truth, active ingredient number one.
[time=1254] Number two, according to verse 42 here, the second active ingredient in a healthy church would be fellowship.
[time=1261] Fellowship and they were continually devoting themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship.
[time=1268] So we got to ask now, is spiritual health just about your handle on or your intake of Scripture?
[time=1276] No, no, this text, this passage would indicate that there's a balance, a much needed balance. Having exposed, look what they did.
[time=1285] Having exposed themselves continually to it. Having studied it, they then lived it out in sacrificial and loving and intimate relationships with each other.
[time=1297] The second active ingredient was fellowship. The Greek word there is coin ania. Coin ania, a Greek word that more than anything else, carries with it a deep sense of and a deep meaning of commonality.
[time=1310] A sense of having things in common. A sense of mutual sharing with each other. A mutual sharing that covers all kinds of bases.
[time=1319] These believers shared a commonality with each other based on their faith in Christ. And as we read and study the text, we see that they're coin ania.
[time=1329] Their fellowship is great to see. It had a lot of expression there. There's kind of two major ways that their commonality and their mutual sharing showed itself.
[time=1340] You can write them down. The first way was this. Two ways coin ania showed itself. First one is this. They shared in their common experiences of joy and in sorrow.
[time=1352] It's clear from the text. And as you study the early church that they shared in their experiences, their common experiences of joy and sorrow.
[time=1364] And it was that way for them, and you know what? It's the same way for me. And I think probably it's the same way for most of you.
[time=1372] As we live life together in this body, as you live life in the family of God, as you live life in the church, you know what?
[time=1378] And I can speak for myself when something really, really exciting happens.
[time=1382] When something happens in my life that just kind of sends me through the ceiling, when I get absolutely revved up, fired up, so thankful and so excited, what do I want to do?
[time=1391] Say it. I want to tell somebody, and some of you have been on the ends of those phone calls. Me driving around town or me sitting there in my office so excited, I just got to tell somebody.
[time=1401] You, same thing. Something happens to you. Something exciting goes on. You want so badly to be able to share that with.
[time=1407] Same thing on the other end. Same thing on the other side. When something tragic takes place, when something sad comes into your life.
[time=1417] When you experience loss, confusion or pain, so many times the most helpful thing is the willingness on the part of one that you know and love to come alongside and share that with you.
[time=1430] Listen to you. Hold you. Hug you. Write your notes. Leave your messages. It's called coin anemia.
[time=1438] You're there for me. I'm there for you. Good days, bad days. In between days. We are there for each other.
[time=1445] Second thing, the second way that it showed itself is they commonly, from what the text teaches, shared with each other, material provision and words of love and encouragement.
[time=1457] That's right. In the early church, their fellowship was the expression of a vibrant and authentic Christianity.
[time=1467] Their expression of commonality, their expression of mutually shared living and life was a vibrant expression of an authentic and intimate Christianity.
[time=1481] And you know what? We can experience that, people. We can. We do at times. We can, I think, experience that at an even greater level.
[time=1491] I'm convinced. No doubt in my mind. We can experience that kind of coin anemia, that same vibrant and sweet fellowship, if we choose to.
[time=1501] There's no doubt in my mind that the Spirit of God and the Word of God and the Person of God are there, ready to empower, ready to encourage, ready to prompt, ready to move you and I down roads.
[time=1512] Whereby we could experience a greater level of commonality and mutual sharing.
[time=1518] Listen to the words of the author Ann Ortland. Ann Ortland said it this way, thought it was extremely well said.
[time=1525] "Every congregation," she noted, "has a choice to be one of two things. This family, right here. We have a choice," she says.
[time=1537] Black Hawk can be one of two things. You can choose to be a bag of marbles, single units that don't affect each other except in collision.
[time=1550] On Sunday morning, you can choose to go to church or you can choose to sleep in. Who really cares whether there are 192 or 193 marbles in a bag?
[time=1562] Who cares? Or you can say no to the marble thing. She goes on and says, "Or you can choose to be a bag of grapes."
[time=1572] Grapes. Living life so close. Living life so committed to each other that the juices begin to mingle and there is no way to extricate yourself even if you tried.
[time=1586] What happens is that each begins to be part of all.
[time=1592] End quote.
[time=1595] We can be in this together intimately and honestly and personally, sacrificially, coin an ea.
[time=1604] Well, what keeps that from happening?
[time=1607] You know and I know, we've seen it. You've experienced it. I've experienced it. You've done it and I've done it.
[time=1614] What are the things that keep that kind of sweet, vibrant fellowship from happening?
[time=1619] I listed four right here. Again, I'd encourage you to jot them down. Give some thought to them.
[time=1624] Talk about them today at lunch. Confess what might need to be confessed in your own heart.
[time=1628] Talk to your kids about how to avoid these things in their own life and your family in this family.
[time=1634] There's more than four I wrote down these things. What keeps coin an ea from becoming a reality in a church?
[time=1640] Number one, pettiness. Pettiness.
[time=1645] You know, when I read Acts 2 and I get into Acts 3 and I get into Acts 4 and when you study the early church,
[time=1651] of the many things that I don't see, one of the things I'm struck by again and again is a lack of pettiness.
[time=1658] And you oftentimes don't have pettiness when your life is in danger and when your faith causes you to be persecuted
[time=1666] and when you are so completely given in your heart to that which is right and true and so deeply devoted to a sense of coin an ea.
[time=1674] You see, when that's the picture, petty things are petty things
[time=1680] and they're brushed aside as vision and heart and spirit are kept focused on what really matters.
[time=1689] Pettiness can keep coin an ea from happening. A critical spirit.
[time=1695] Number two, a critical spirit can keep coin an ea from finding its expression in your life or your family or this church.
[time=1703] A third thing I jotted down was unconfessed resentment.
[time=1707] Unconfessed resentment, bitterness.
[time=1710] And we've talked about this in the past.
[time=1713] You or I harboring something, anything, the slightest little shred of ill will or ill feelings toward anybody.
[time=1725] Is all that he needs, is all that the enemy needs to begin to brew and grow and develop in the depths of your heart this little seed of anger and bitterness.
[time=1740] We've said it before and we'll say it again, bitterness.
[time=1744] Unconfessed resentment and we use the word the phrase "unconfessed" because it is sin.
[time=1751] Bitterness we've said before is like swallowing poison and waiting for the other person to die.
[time=1760] They don't die, do they?
[time=1763] Who dies? You do.
[time=1768] You let enough time go by in that heart of yours to shrivels up gets hard and calloused and you die.
[time=1776] Unconfessed resentment, bitterness, pettiness, critical spirit, a fourth when I wrote down, was a passionate commitment to me.
[time=1786] A passionate commitment to me, my agenda, my opinion on how this place should be, my opinion, my preference, my turf,
[time=1797] whenever you get a passionate commitment to me, to yourself, whenever I get a passionate commitment to me,
[time=1805] I'm not just saying this to you, I'm saying this to us.
[time=1809] And when I get a passionate commitment to me, in my home with my kids, in my home with my wife, in this church with these people, it all goes south because it's not about me.
[time=1823] It's about us. And that's the essence of Koinania.
[time=1827] You get those things going on in a church and you've seen this, you get those things going on in a church, pettiness and a critical spirit and a passionate commitment to me, you're done.
[time=1837] You're on the verge of being done, put up a sign, sell the place, close the doors, because death's on the way.
[time=1845] Because what follows those things is ugly, it's divisive and factious.
[time=1852] Active ingredient number three.
[time=1855] Verse 42 still, they were continually devoting themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship.
[time=1862] Number three, communion, the breaking of bread and to the breaking of bread.
[time=1868] You see it there in verse 42?
[time=1870] The breaking of bread.
[time=1872] The breaking of bread included more than just the sharing of meals.
[time=1876] This was them remembering and celebrating the Lord's Supper just as Christ had asked them to do in Luke 22.
[time=1884] You can write that down.
[time=1885] Luke 22 verse 19.
[time=1887] This was them remembering his sacrificial death.
[time=1890] This was them gathering around the Lord's table, the regular remembering.
[time=1894] What did that do?
[time=1898] What did it accomplish?
[time=1899] What do you see it accomplishing in their life as the story unfolds?
[time=1904] What does it do in your life when you take the time to regularly remember the death and sacrificial life that he gave?
[time=1913] Well, as I read through here, it becomes clear that it kept their minds and their hearts focused.
[time=1921] It kept their minds and hearts focused on the Lord and his work on their behalf.
[time=1925] Again, at a time in the life of the early church where a profession of faith would mean persecution or torment.
[time=1933] At a time in the life of the early church when a profession of faith would leave you alone and cast out from your family.
[time=1941] The remembering of his death was a chance to refocus a heart and a mind that would oftentimes need refocusing.
[time=1951] When I get my heart in mind, I don't know what it's like for you.
[time=1954] I know what it's like for me.
[time=1956] Each month as we celebrate that and remember that here together and I get a chance to get my heart and mind refocused on his sacrificial work done, offered on my behalf.
[time=1967] Aside from sheer and immeasurable gratitude, you know what it does for me?
[time=1973] It brings to my life a sense of renewed perspective.
[time=1976] Remembering his death, remembering his work, remembering what he did and why he did it, it brings to my own heart and mind a tremendous sense of clarity to perspective.
[time=1987] I sit there or I stand here with you at communion and I think to myself, he endured that for me.
[time=1995] I can love someone then who's hard to love.
[time=1999] He suffered that for me when you know what?
[time=2004] I can.
[time=2005] I can do dinner, dishes, baths, homework, prayer time and listen to my wife talk about her day.
[time=2012] All of it with a great attitude.
[time=2016] All of it with a sweet attitude, an open heart and a willingness to serve.
[time=2021] He suffered his life that willingly, but I can be more faithful to point others toward forgiveness and hope.
[time=2030] It refocuses the heart.
[time=2032] It brings perspective to the mind when we take time as they took time to regularly remember his sacrifice.
[time=2040] The text here and elsewhere in the New Testament says absolutely nothing about crackers, juice, bread, wine.
[time=2051] It doesn't give us a whole lot of help on all that.
[time=2053] No specifics really at all concerning when, concerning where, concerning how, just a few basics.
[time=2062] It's for believers.
[time=2066] It's for those who know him. It's for those who have given their life to him.
[time=2070] It is for those who walk in personal relationship with him and only for those.
[time=2078] And to take communion, to take part in that endeavor lightly or carelessly is a dangerous thing the New Testament teaches.
[time=2090] We do know that. It's for those who know him. It's for those who have entered into relationship with him.
[time=2095] And it is to be a regular remembrance of his broken body and spilled blood.
[time=2103] Active ingredient number four, fourth thing and the last thing you see there in verse 42, what is it?
[time=2112] Say it louder. Prayer. Yeah. People. These people prayed.
[time=2121] Back to the beginning of verse 42, how often? Say it continually.
[time=2128] They prayed. They prayed. You see, the early church hadn't come across the latest releases.
[time=2137] They hadn't read ten ways to grow your church. They hadn't come across yet five steps to perfect parenting.
[time=2143] They hadn't found the book 14 Ways to Will Your Wife.
[time=2147] They hadn't come across evangelism in eleven easy lessons. And they're not poking fun at books.
[time=2154] I'm just making the point. They didn't have all the resources we have.
[time=2159] But you know what they had? They had a personal, vibrant relationship with a living God and they prayed.
[time=2166] And they prayed. And they prayed. And they prayed. They prayed. They confessed sin.
[time=2173] They lifted up the lost and hurting. They begged God for help and wisdom.
[time=2177] They conversed with the Father again and again and again.
[time=2182] And this text gives clear, as do others, gives clear emphasis to the fact that they did it when they were together.
[time=2190] And I'm sure they did it alone, but this gives clear emphasis to the fact that when they came together
[time=2196] and when they gathered, one of the things they continually did was they prayed.
[time=2203] And we don't do that. We don't do that as much, do we?
[time=2211] Have we prayed yet this morning? Once, right? How long was that?
[time=2220] I don't know. Thirty seconds. I don't know. We've got to think about that.
[time=2226] Are you open to that? We've got to think about that.
[time=2230] Every time they came together, they prayed.
[time=2233] I'm reminded of a great opportunity that we had. Boy, it was fun and meaningful.
[time=2238] About a year ago, some of you know this. About a year ago, somebody graciously offered to take our whole staff
[time=2245] and our wives, our entire senior staff and wives, got a chance to go to New York City.
[time=2250] And it was kind of a thank you, but it was also an opportunity to be exposed and introduced to a really exciting ministry,
[time=2257] a place called the Brooklyn Tabernacle.
[time=2260] And so we were there for about three and a half days in New York, and on Tuesday night, our host and all of us
[time=2266] got on the subway and made our way over the bridge and into Brooklyn.
[time=2270] And we got to attend the Brooklyn Tabernacle. The pastor's name is Jim Simba.
[time=2274] I wrote the book Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire. Fantastic place. A wonderful people.
[time=2279] And a great, great guy who God has used in that place enormously.
[time=2284] We had a chance to go to their Tuesday night gathering, their Tuesday night prayer meeting.
[time=2291] And this thing has become a tradition there. And we got there and had a chance to do some Q&A with him.
[time=2295] And some of the folks on their staff. And I think it was to start at seven.
[time=2300] Well, interesting. Couple things stand out in my mind.
[time=2303] Interesting. About a half hour before the actual prayer service, worship time together was to begin. There were probably about close to 500 men,
[time=2314] husbands, dads, single guys.
[time=2319] Men gathered at the front, the place held about probably two, maybe two, three thousand people. It's about 500 or so men on their knees down at the front.
[time=2330] Just all of them praying out loud for their wives and kids, for their jobs, for their faith, for their
[time=2336] everything you could think of. And it was amazing. It was like a rumbling.
[time=2340] It was a noise. You could walk in the back and you saw 500 men on their knees praying out loud.
[time=2346] Well, the service started about seven o'clock or so. And it's quite a place.
[time=2350] It's a very ethnically diverse place. A church made up for the most part of those in the black community and those in the Hispanic community and some in the Oriental community.
[time=2359] But it's all them. And here's the pastoral staff from Fort Wayne, Indiana, sitting back in one of these back rows. And boy, we were having fun.
[time=2368] And they sang some songs and it was time to pray. And they do prayer different ways.
[time=2372] And that night, I'll tell you what, here's how they did it. He stood up and he said, "Hey, everybody up in the music's playing." And he just encouraged them to put your hands on the shoulders of the individual in front of you, just put your hands on their shoulder.
[time=2385] He said, "And pray. Pray for him. Pray for him." Well, as soon as he said that, I'm standing up, right? All of a sudden, I feel his hands about halfway up my back. Not even to my shoulder blades yet.
[time=2399] And I look behind me. And there's about a four foot eleven,
[time=2405] 80 year old black man with his hands about half wet my back.
[time=2411] Saying, "Lordy, I don't know this big man, but I know he needs you, Lord."
[time=2419] And he's just got his hands digging into my back and he starts praying for my, he doesn't know me, but he starts praying for my life.
[time=2427] He's married Lord be with his wife. If he's got, he just starts talking about my kids and my wife and my home and my friends and my family.
[time=2438] And I couldn't believe it. It was so, it so impressed me.
[time=2442] And I don't mean that in a sense of performance. It just, you know, well, before you know it, I realized I got my hands coming up.
[time=2450] You know, it was a very scary thing for me coming from, you know, like Indiana and all.
[time=2454] And I've got my hands all of a sudden on this lady in front of me.
[time=2458] She was a young mother. Cabra was standing right next to me.
[time=2462] And people had their hands on her and Scott was next to Cabra.
[time=2465] And I have, all of a sudden I realized I have my hands on this young black woman with a baby in her hand and it dawned on me as I started to pray for her.
[time=2474] We're in this together. You're in Brooklyn. I'm in Fort Wayne.
[time=2478] We're in this is called Coinenia. And I didn't know how to pray.
[time=2482] I didn't know if that was her kid. I didn't know if it was a boy or a girl.
[time=2485] I didn't know if she was married or left. I didn't know if she got beat at night or loved well. I didn't know anything about her. I didn't know if she was on drugs.
[time=2490] They didn't know if she was okay. But you just pray.
[time=2493] And it was such a sweet thing. And we don't do that.
[time=2498] Here. We don't pray. I don't think enough.
[time=2502] For and with each other. And we're going to.
[time=2506] All right? We're going to. We're going to pray.
[time=2511] And we're going to pray a lot. And we're going to pray with each other.
[time=2514] We're going to pray for each other. And so someday you're going to come in here and I'm going to stay stand up and put your hands on the shoulders of the person in front of you.
[time=2523] And we'll do it. We'll pray. They prayed. People, they prayed all the time.
[time=2530] Well, what happened?
[time=2533] What happened by adding these four active ingredients to the mix?
[time=2541] What happened? What does a building, what does a budget, what does a page staff and programs become people when you add those four things to the mix?
[time=2552] Say it. That's a church.
[time=2556] Now that's a church. You throw those four things in the midst and you've got a church.
[time=2560] And look what happened. When these specific ingredients were added to the early church, verses 43, it's great how Luke did this. Verses 43 to 47.
[time=2569] Now it goes back in order. And from teaching to fellowship and on down the list, it shows you what happened in that church as those active ingredients got lived out.
[time=2581] Verse 43, in other words, you can kind of say it this way or you can write it down this way.
[time=2585] Verse 43 starts out and you would want to just kind of put this in parentheses.
[time=2590] Okay? As they were taught, back to the first active ingredient, as they were taught, then verse 43 kicks in. What's it say?
[time=2599] And everyone kept feeling a sense of awe and many wonders and signs were taking place through the apostles.
[time=2606] Somebody once said, "The truths taught by the apostles rumbled like thunder from heaven,
[time=2612] filling the people with awe." And I think that's so very true.
[time=2618] I think it's true of them and I think it's true of us.
[time=2620] You see, when you come face to face with the Word of God, you come face to face with God.
[time=2625] And what develops, in my experience at least has been, and as I've watched others go through this, what develops is a reverential respect for his power and his wisdom and his majesty
[time=2636] that penetrates your heart and life. It's an amazing thing and it's sometimes hard for me to describe.
[time=2643] And the best way I can kind of come at it is this, is to say, in my own memory, prior to 1983, prior to the age of 20, when I came to know Christ, as I would read this book, as I would flip through its pages and I did it off and growing up in the church, it was a book. It was a book.
[time=2663] Sometimes, rarely holding my interest, most of the time, boring me, confusing me.
[time=2670] Prior to salvation, it's like reading a book, it's like listening to a lecture.
[time=2675] You come to faith in Christ, you genuinely repent, you genuinely and sincerely
[time=2681] enter into that relationship with a living God, and something changes.
[time=2686] Something changes. I can remember days still living in Southern California, driving around in my car with tapes and listening to the Bible being taught.
[time=2695] I can remember nights in my room at college studying or reading books about the Bible, listening to tapes even in my room. I can remember there being days, especially there at the beginning, where I would, I would have tears, streaming down my face, driving or sitting at my desk going, "I can't believe this. I can't believe that it's so right and it's so penetrating and it's so true."
[time=2718] And it was an amazing thing to come face to face and heart to heart with the Word of God.
[time=2724] It brings to your life and to your heart and to your days a sense of awe.
[time=2729] It's great. It's a great thing.
[time=2734] I'm thinking about Psalm 19. Will you flip back there?
[time=2739] Psalm 19 comes to my mind, or is it one that, no, it's 19, 19.
[time=2748] Just a reminder. It is awesome. It is penetrating.
[time=2753] It is so very powerful. It is so right.
[time=2757] And it's great just to see how the Psalmist wrote in Psalm 19, pick it up in verse 7, where it says the law, speaking of the Scriptures, the law of the Lord is perfect, restoring the soul, the testimony, another word for the Scriptures.
[time=2771] The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.
[time=2775] The precepts of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart.
[time=2779] The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.
[time=2784] The fear of the Lord is clean and during forever.
[time=2787] The judgments of the Lord are true. They are righteous altogether.
[time=2792] They are more desirable than gold, yes, than much fine gold.
[time=2796] Sweeter also are they than honey, and the drippings of the honeycomb.
[time=2800] Moreover, by them thy servant is warned. In keeping them there is great reward.
[time=2809] Amen? Amen. You've felt that. You've seen that.
[time=2813] You've sensed that. You've experienced the rightness and the purity of God's Word as it impacts your life.
[time=2821] Let's keep going. As they, again, parenthetically, you could add this to the first part of verses 44 and 45, the second result.
[time=2828] As they experienced fellowship, what took place?
[time=2832] Better get back to Acts, Acts 2, 44, and all those who had believed.
[time=2837] And all those who had believed were together and had all things in common and they began selling their property and possessions and were sharing them with all, as anyone might have need.
[time=2850] The love of Christ, found only in Christ, spills out in these two verses into the hearts and lives of these early believers.
[time=2860] And what's produced is a unity, a selfless spirit and deep concern for each other that led to enormous, unthinkable generosity, spirit of kindness, and of love and devotion
[time=2876] to each other, selling their possessions and their property to give to all, as any might have need.
[time=2885] That kind of love, just remember, okay, we're going to move on.
[time=2889] But before we move on, remember this, that kind of love, that kind of caring, cannot be injected into a church externally.
[time=2901] I can't teach you that.
[time=2904] We can't come up with some curriculum to get you to think and live and choose that way.
[time=2910] It has to come from your what?
[time=2913] From your heart.
[time=2915] It has to come from a heart that's been radically loved and changed by God.
[time=2921] It's been the recipient of the rightness and the purity of God's Word and its strength and power.
[time=2926] It has to happen from within.
[time=2929] It can't be taught.
[time=2930] It can't be forced.
[time=2932] Let's keep going as they receive teaching together, as they fellowship together thirdly, as they took communion together.
[time=2940] What happened?
[time=2941] Look at verse 46.
[time=2943] And day by day, continuing with one mind in the temple and breaking bread from house to house, they were taking their meals together with gladness and sincerity of heart.
[time=2954] I want you to focus on that last phrase.
[time=2957] Communion was for them an experience that was entered into and experienced with a gladness and sincerity of heart.
[time=2966] Interesting to note, sometimes communion is associated with kind of a solemn, quiet, contemplative atmosphere.
[time=2975] But the Greek word for gladness would suggest differently.
[time=2979] The Greek word there for gladness would describe it as a joyful sense of celebration.
[time=2986] A joyful sense of celebration along with the phrase, the sincerity of heart and that word in the Greek.
[time=2993] The word for sincerity meant free from rough edges.
[time=2997] Write that down.
[time=2999] Think about that.
[time=3000] There gathering together was a joyful celebration that was, as they came together, free from rough edges or smooth,
[time=3010] implying that their times together were free from divisiveness and discord.
[time=3017] There's too much at stake back then.
[time=3020] There was too much on the line back then.
[time=3025] Their love was radical, their commitment deep.
[time=3028] And there was a sense of gladness and sincerity of heart.
[time=3033] Well, and with this, as they prayed together, as they prayed together, what happened?
[time=3039] Well, you'll see that there were two bridges built.
[time=3043] Verse 47, praising God, there it is, right there.
[time=3046] Praising God and having favor with all the people.
[time=3049] And the Lord was adding to their number day by day those who were being saved.
[time=3054] Two bridges built, one vertically to the Lord and one horizontally to each other.
[time=3065] And what was the result?
[time=3066] All right, here we go.
[time=3067] Here's the conclusion, right?
[time=3069] This is the end of this passage and here's where it leads us.
[time=3073] What was the result?
[time=3077] What happened in this community of believers, this band of believers
[time=3083] who birthed the church and had a chance to spread the gospel.
[time=3087] And they did it with four active ingredients, always and consistently and continuously at the forefront.
[time=3093] And what was the result?
[time=3097] To this teaching, learning, loving, remembering, praying church.
[time=3102] Well, you look for yourself into verse 47.
[time=3105] And the Lord was adding to their number day by day those who were being saved.
[time=3112] I don't know if you'll agree with this.
[time=3114] I sure do.
[time=3115] And I think it's true.
[time=3116] I think it's right.
[time=3118] And I think it's unarguable.
[time=3120] And again, you may see it different, but my opinion is this.
[time=3123] A church, a group of people, a place like this, if there were to be.
[time=3129] And again, I feel like at times we're moving in that direction.
[time=3132] If there was a sense in this place and we were a teaching, learning,
[time=3138] loving, remembering, praying people, my opinion is that when someone on the outside looking in comes in contact with them and gets up close to someone who hasn't yet crossed over that line of faith.
[time=3152] Someone who's seeking and searching, asking questions, wondering what life's about.
[time=3157] That kind of a people, those kinds of activities done with that kind of spirit,
[time=3163] I believe is a huge invitation.
[time=3167] I believe they gravitate toward that.
[time=3169] I believe they want some of that.
[time=3171] I believe that is something that their heart longs for.
[time=3178] And millions and millions of dollars are spent each year trying to figure out how to grow churches.
[time=3184] And it says right here, four things.
[time=3187] Give yourself to them.
[time=3189] Be committed to them.
[time=3190] Practice them.
[time=3193] And so we will, huh?
[time=3196] Do our best.
[time=3197] We'll grow.
[time=3198] We'll repent where we need to repent.
[time=3199] We'll change where we need to change.
[time=3201] We'll do everything within our power with this help to be a teaching, learning, loving, remembering, praying people.
[time=3208] Truth to take home.
[time=3210] Some questions to ask and we'll be done.
[time=3213] Of the four.
[time=3214] Please don't, don't check out here, all right?
[time=3216] Stay with me.
[time=3217] Just one more minute.
[time=3218] Of the four.
[time=3219] Of the four active ingredients we just spent 40 minutes talking about.
[time=3223] Of the four things you see right here in the Word of God that these folks held so tightly and lifted up so high, where do you feel deficient today?
[time=3234] And you may say, "Oh, it's easy all four." No, I'll be more specific with yourself.
[time=3238] Be more honest.
[time=3239] Think about it a little bit longer.
[time=3240] Which of the four priorities deserves more of your heart and your devotion?
[time=3247] And I'm not asking you to figure that out right now.
[time=3249] I'm not asking you to decide the answer to that question.
[time=3252] I certainly am inviting you to think about that today.
[time=3254] I am certainly inviting you as I have done with myself over this last week to consider where in your life and your life here in this family.
[time=3264] Your heart could use some encouragement and some movement down one of these roads, one of these four roads.
[time=3272] Let's just take it a step further.
[time=3276] Don't just identify it, but you know what I want you to do?
[time=3278] Write down. Write down a goal.
[time=3283] Think about it within the realm of this family and those four things.
[time=3288] What's one thing you could do?
[time=3290] Let's put some action to it.
[time=3292] What's one thing, kids, young kids, students, moms, dads, older adults?
[time=3299] What's one thing you could do this week?
[time=3301] An achievable goal, something that good friends could pray for and hold you accountable to.
[time=3307] That's one thing you could do in this next week or next two weeks.
[time=3311] That might further your heart and further yourself down one of those four roads.
[time=3316] Maybe you can think of two things that would further you down two roads, but those four things.
[time=3321] You've got to think about them.
[time=3322] You've got to look at them.
[time=3323] You've got to consider your life in the midst of those four things and what's a couple things you could do to give your heart more expression and your life a greater chance to be connected to those four things and in turn then be in a much greater way connected to us.
[time=3339] We'll give it some fun.
[time=3341] Why don't you stand?
[time=3342] We'll close with a word of prayer.
[time=3348] Here, come on, we'll get real bold.
[time=3350] Why don't you hold hands?
[time=3355] Wherever you are, reach across the aisles if you have to.
[time=3361] Come on, balcony.
[time=3362] I see you up there.
[time=3364] Come on, hold hands.
[time=3367] And as you hold the hand of the person next to you, again, you may not even know them.
[time=3373] You may have no idea who they are.
[time=3375] You may have no idea the reality of their life this morning.
[time=3378] They may be extremely blessed and happy and encouraged today.
[time=3384] You may be holding the hand of someone who's on the brink of absolute despair.
[time=3390] Either way, we've all heard this morning the truth.
[time=3395] We've all been reminded of a road that we can all walk with His help and with our assistance.
[time=3401] And so as I pray for us, you pray for the one whose hand or the two whose hands you're holding.
[time=3408] Just pray along with me and then we'll be on our way.
[time=3411] Thanks so much for the privilege of Kornania.
[time=3420] Just look out over this room this morning and see a room full of people holding hands.
[time=3426] And to realize that it's so much more than just a room full of people holding hands.
[time=3431] God, it's the body of Christ.
[time=3433] A flawed one, God, one that has not arrived yet.
[time=3437] We've got such a long way to go.
[time=3439] But it's times like this that we're reminded of the hope that we have and the direction that we can pursue.
[time=3444] And God, we beg you this morning, hurting people, happy people, encouraged people, discouraged people,
[time=3452] families that are strong and growing, families that are on the brink of ruin.
[time=3456] God, all of us, in one place, in one room holding hands, lift our hearts and our eyes to you and say,
[time=3462] "Oh, God, please help us." Help us to apply the truth that we've heard this morning.
[time=3466] God, help us to be a church that loves radically and gives sacrificially.
[time=3471] Father, thank you for the sweetness of fellowship.
[time=3475] There's nothing like it.
[time=3476] And God, as we teach and as we love and as we remember and as we pray, we ask God that you would grow us in the way that only you can.
[time=3485] And all the people agreed and said, "Amen."
