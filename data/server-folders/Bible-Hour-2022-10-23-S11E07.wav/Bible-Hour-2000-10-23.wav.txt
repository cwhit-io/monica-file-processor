[time=124] Lord for your love, your love for us.
[time=130] The name of Jesus, what a sweet name.
[time=134] That name above all names, every tongue will confess, and every knee will bow, that Jesus
[time=141] Christ is Lord.
[time=144] Lord, we come to worship you to praise your name, that name above all names.
[time=153] Please accept these gifts, may they be a sweet offering to you.
[time=162] For it's in your son's name we pray.

[time=263] You have been given the name of all names, and we worship you, yes we worship you.
[time=313] we worship you, yes we worship you.
[time=343] Jesus, what a beautiful name, son of God, son of man, lamb that was slain.
[time=366] Jesus, what a beautiful name, son of man, son of man, son of man, son of man, son of
[time=388] man, lamb that was slain, joy and peace, strength and hope, race and blows of hope.
[time=416] Race that blows of fear away, Jesus, what a beautiful name, son of man, son of man,
[time=436] son of man, son of man, son of man, son of man, son of man, son of man, son of man,
[time=561] what a beautiful name, Jesus, what a beautiful name, Jesus, what a beautiful name.
[time=591] On those pages of the scripture that record the acts of the apostles, it is written,
[time=602] one day Peter and John were going up to the temple at the time of prayer at three in the afternoon.
[time=608] Now a man crippled from birth was being carried to the temple gate called beautiful.
[time=613] This is where he was put every day to beg from those going into the temple courts.
[time=619] When the lame man saw Peter and John about to enter, he asked, Sirs, do you have a gift
[time=626] for me?
[time=627] Peter looked straight at him and said, Silver and gold, I do not have, but what I have,
[time=633] I give you.
[time=634] And what is that?
[time=635] In the name of Jesus of Nazareth, walk.
[time=638] Taking him by the right hand, Peter helped him up.
[time=641] Be careful.
[time=642] I have not been able to do this.
[time=644] And instantly the man's feet and ankles became strong.
[time=649] I walk.
[time=652] With great excitement, the man went with Peter and John into the temple court.
[time=658] Walking and jumping and praising God.
[time=662] Because of Peter's testimony and the healing of the lame man, a great group of people became
[time=668] believers and the church in Jerusalem swelled to 5,000.
[time=675] But then, because of the fear caused by the healing, Peter and John were brought before the Sanhedrin.
[time=681] At once the Sanhedrin leaders realized that Peter and John were ordinary men, but it was
[time=687] obvious that they had been with Jesus.
[time=691] In their anger, the Sanhedrin demanded, By what power or name have you done this thing
[time=697] to this lame man?
[time=699] Then Peter filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them.
[time=702] It is by the name of Jesus of Nazareth, whom you crucified, but whom God raised from the
[time=708] dead that this man stands before you today, healed.
[time=712] Jesus is the stone you builders rejected, which has become the capstone.
[time=719] Salvation is found in no one else.
[time=720] For there is no other name under heaven given to us by which we must be saved.
[time=727] Then the Sanhedrin leaders called to Peter and John and shouted.
[time=731] We command you to speak no more in that name.
[time=735] What name?
[time=736] His name.
[time=737] Whose name?
[time=738] The name of Jesus, but we cannot help but speak about what we have heard and seen.
[time=748] Then all of the people who had seen this praise the Lord.
[time=754] Well, hey, this morning, I want to spend some time as a family talking about and looking
[time=761] to the Scriptures and considering some very, very important things.
[time=765] Some things that we have to continue to think about, have to continue to consider as a family
[time=771] as we do our best, hopefully, to be the kind of church that God has called us to be.
[time=775] I just spent about three days away this week and was able to see some things again and be reminded of some things again and be in the presence of some people, some from our own team and then others, hundreds, actually thousands of others from different leadership teams across the country.
[time=790] We were over in Chicago and we just had a fantastic time.
[time=793] I saw some things and personally got reminded of some things and I just felt like coming
[time=799] home.
[time=800] I couldn't wait another week.
[time=802] I could not wait another moment, but to then just do my best to remind you of some of the
[time=808] very same things that I saw and was reminded of and we're going to get to Acts.
[time=812] That's all very related to Acts, but I want you to hang with me, okay?
[time=817] Let's enjoy this, but more than anything, please open your heart.
[time=821] All of you, all ages, open your heart and be willing this morning to be reminded of some
[time=827] very, very important things, okay?
[time=829] I want to ask some questions.
[time=831] These are questions I ask myself all the time.
[time=833] These are questions that I'm going to ask and continue to ask of you as the days and weeks and months and hopefully years go by.
[time=840] Some very important questions are going to come up on the screen.
[time=842] The first question that I want to ask you this morning is this.
[time=848] Are we committed to being a prevailing church?
[time=852] Not me, you.
[time=854] We meaning you.
[time=855] Are we this family committed to being a prevailing church?
[time=861] One word synonyms that come to mind when you hear the word prevailing.
[time=865] What is prevailing?
[time=866] Proveal means to what?
[time=868] Somebody say it out loud, louder, grow, keep going, louder, survive, survive, grow.
[time=880] What else comes to your mind when you hear the word prevail?
[time=884] Love, say it again, lead, keep going.
[time=890] Back there, I just heard something, victorious, absolutely.
[time=896] Everything, anything, but in this case a prevailing church is victorious.
[time=901] It survives, it endures, it loves, it grows, it succeeds.
[time=907] When I think of the word prevail, you know what comes to my mind?
[time=909] In the end, it's standing.
[time=913] In the end, when it's all said and done and it's time to get counted, this church or this
[time=919] organization, whoever it is that prevailed, is there.
[time=923] Everything succeeded in that which they set out to do, by God's grace and with His help.
[time=928] Are we, are you and your heart committed to being a part of and a contributing factor
[time=934] to a prevailing church?
[time=935] Next question that comes to mind, do we want to have a redemptive posture?
[time=941] Do we want to, as a church, have a redemptive posture in the way that we carry ourselves,
[time=947] in the way that we go through life, in the way that we minister, in the way that we serve, in the way that we do, all that we do, what is our posture going to be?
[time=956] We're going to talk a little bit more about that later this morning, that leads to the third question, do we really, are we really, I mean really, really, really, really down
[time=967] deep in your soul?
[time=970] Are we really going to do all that we can?
[time=975] Am I going to get up every day of my life and with my love for God and my love for my
[time=981] family, my wife and my kids in tact, those being the most important things in my life?
[time=989] Is that next thing that I'm going to give my all to, going to be helping seekers, both saved and searching, find and follow Christ in this place?
[time=1000] I hope so.
[time=1002] I want to, I stand before this morning proclaiming that to you again, that I will and am giving
[time=1008] my life to that endeavor and I don't want to do it alone and I don't feel like I am.
[time=1014] I feel like we're doing that but there will be days in the future, there will be times that we will face when we will have to ask that question again and again and again because there is a price that comes with that people.
[time=1028] When you really give all that you have to help seekers, both saved and searching, find
[time=1035] and then follow Him.
[time=1038] Well if we're going to, there are some non-negotiable absolutes, some scriptural truths that we will
[time=1046] have to be reminded of again and again, some scriptural truths that will have to be embedded
[time=1052] in our hearts and minds, some non-negotiable things that you and I will have to live by,
[time=1059] be committed to and be completely consumed with if we're going to be that kind of a people.
[time=1069] And I want to remind us of those this morning, God's Word has some things to say about that but you know what, to do this I'm going to need some help and we're going to have some fun with this, serious stuff but I'm going to need some help, I'm going to need some volume, well actually I'm not going to actually have volunteers, I'm going to actually pick
[time=1092] some people to come up here and help me do this, people's eyes are immediately looking down right now.
[time=1092] People are racing for the doors, Steve Weil, come on up here, we're Steve, Steve I need your help, where'd you go Steve, come on up here Steve Weil, Susie Vance, would you please
[time=1103] come help me?
[time=1105] And I need a younger, I saw Richard, Richard, come up here man, come up here, give Richard
[time=1114] Susie and Steve a big hand for being so willing, alright, good morning Steven, good to see you
[time=1124] why don't you stand right there Susie, I know Richard, you come over here in the middle right there, there we go Susie, in fact look at these little black pieces of tape that gave us, right there's a black piece of tape you stand on that, black piece of tape you stand on that, there we go, good, good, good, Susie knew about this the other two didn't, so I'll hear about this from Steve and Richard later I'm sure, you know there's got to be a commitment to five and you can start writing if you want, there has to be a commitment
[time=1151] to five vital truths in the life of this church, if we are going to prevail and if we are
[time=1157] going to help seekers find and follow, the first of which, the first of which is this,
[time=1165] the first of which is we must be committed to following Christ and having Christ the
[time=1171] Lord Himself, the scriptures talk about Him being formed in our hearts, well how does
[time=1177] that happen, how as the first major thing that we've got to be committed to, Him being
[time=1183] formed in our hearts, oh how does it happen, well here's how it, we're going to show you how it doesn't happen, okay, here's how it doesn't happen in a church, all right and you just stand right here and just put a big old silly grin on your face, all right, just a big, the big and look at them, don't look at me, you can get me later for this, you just look at them with a big bigger, bigger, silly, silly grin, there you go, blanks there
[time=1208] just completely blank, there you go, that's good, now you just keep looking at them with a silly grin, and now a little bit more, a little bit more scowling of it, yeah there
[time=1221] you go, all right that's good, more upset, scowling and upset, yeah good right there,
[time=1227] hold that, all right Susie, put your fists up like this, make a fist, yeah just kind
[time=1233] of like a defiant three year old, you know you and I know nothing about that I know, so just put that fist right there, there you go, all right, okay you see them up there, you're not grinning still, you got a grin, you got a big old smile, this is how it doesn't happen,
[time=1248] and I'm going to just work my way down and we're going to change these postures, for Christ to be fully formed in you, you and I have to possess some things, we have to possess
[time=1260] the word of God, the word of God has got to make its way into our lives, I need a Bible
[time=1266] real quick, I know you can use, yeah you can use mine, that's all right, you guys keep your scow going and you keep those fists going, now take this, get rid of your silly grin and just hold that right there and you just look out there, the word of God, not
[time=1281] a silly grin from some guy who stands up on stage and tries to win people or get them
[time=1287] to do things because of his personality, it's not what we're about, we're not about personalities trying to get people to do things, we're about standing with the word of God and teaching it and proclaiming it and it getting into the hearts and lives of people because when the word of God is in the center of your heart and life, meeting
[time=1308] you at all the critical junctures of life, the emotional, relational, vocational decisions
[time=1315] that you have to make, that's when you and I make good decisions and Christ gets formed
[time=1321] and we grow as a church when we hold the word of God and when that is set out before us.
[time=1331] We also have informed in us when we possess a heart for worship, not a standing with hands
[time=1340] in pocket with bitter looks on our face, but no instead what I want you to do, Richard I want you to put your hands up, we won't go full care, we'll just kind of come down here to kind of moderate like aggressive Baptist right there, yeah, well that's fine, that's
[time=1357] fine, whatever you want to just kind of hands up just like right there and then just a look on your face that's just you, filled with the Holy Spirit, a believer who loves the Lord,
[time=1369] a heart for worship, a heart for worship, it's important that we touch on this just again
[time=1375] and we're going to keep touching on it again and again and again, a heart for worship,
[time=1381] a willingness in your heart and mind to come into this place and bring Him everything,
[time=1391] to bring Him everything that we have and to offer it to Him and to offer it with genuineness,
[time=1398] to offer it with honesty, to offer it with a sense of thanksgiving and praise, it says
[time=1406] in I think back in Psalm 66, I think that's going to come up on the screen, look at these
[time=1413] words, this is what God's word calls us to do, this is the posture God's worth calls
[time=1419] forth from us as we gather to worship Him, Psalm 66 says shout joyfully to the Lord,
[time=1425] joyfully to God, all the earth sing the glory of His name, make His praise glorious, goes
[time=1432] on and says say to God how awesome are thy works because of the greatness of thy power, thine enemies will give feigned obedience to thee, goes on in verse 4 and says all the
[time=1443] earth will worship thee and will sing praises to thee, they will sing praises to thy name,
[time=1449] God's word says be glad people, that word when preached and when delivered says to you
[time=1455] and I, individuals gathered to worship, to be glad, to be glad and to be glad in heart
[time=1463] and to sing and to rejoice and to dance and to lift our heads and hands and hearts, it
[time=1470] says to shout His name and give praise to all that He has done and accomplished.
[time=1479] John 4, Jesus there with the woman at the well, He said He was looking for those who worship Him in what, in spirit and in truth and that's what we give ourselves to here
[time=1491] today, worshiping Him in spirit and in truth, focusing on His character, focusing on His
[time=1497] work, focusing on His Word and allowing those things to encourage and fill our hearts in
[time=1503] such a way that our worship to Him is sweet in spirit and that does mean with emotion,
[time=1512] that does mean with feeling, that does mean with a sense of visceral connection to a God that saved you and you're thankful for that and so it evokes a sense of excitement and you might show that excitement, you might show that sense of wow God thank you in a
[time=1528] certain way and I might show it in a different way but, but it's not dead, it's not hands
[time=1537] in pocket, head down with a scowl, no, there will be a sense on your face and in mind
[time=1544] that He's alive in you and that you're thankful for that.
[time=1549] Now I want to say something about that because what's so important, you see this posture
[time=1556] right here, what's so important about you and me and the way that we would express our
[time=1562] worship is that there is never ever to be a sense where in your excitement and in your
[time=1568] joy and in your wanting to express your thanks to Him and bring your worship, you doing that
[time=1574] is never to be a distraction to the process and so I'm not talking about nor are we advocating
[time=1587] that would be blatantly distractive because we don't want to distract from Him but there is a sense where with a real sense of sincerity you and I can in very appropriate ways show
[time=1601] Him our thanks and let Him see and sense are being submissive and thankful to Him.
[time=1609] So for Christ to be formed in us we've got to have somebody, a group of people who are in many different aspects, in different settings in the church, getting the word of God into our lives.
[time=1619] There also has to be a heart for worship and there also has to be, you and I also have to possess a surrendered life.
[time=1628] There has to be a surrendered spirit and so Susie I just want you to take your hands and open them up and set them right down there in front of you.
[time=1636] That's it right there.
[time=1638] I see Susie's hands when the word of God is taught and when you and I possess a heart
[time=1645] of worship and when there is in your life and mine a sense of humility, a sense of tenderness,
[time=1658] a sense of submission and reverence, when there is a surrendered sense of God you know
[time=1666] what I am not in control, I don't want to be in control, this isn't about me and I am laying myself at your feet and I am surrendered.
[time=1676] When that takes place God does amazing, amazing things.
[time=1684] One more thing about surrender, you see that posture Susie has there?
[time=1688] When I see her hands like that you know what I think of, I think of relinquishing, I think
[time=1694] of relinquishing rights, I think of relinquishing agendas.
[time=1698] I think of your willingness in mind and the examples that we see all through scripture of relinquishing preferences.
[time=1705] There is a relinquishing there and the spiritual life that takes place.
[time=1709] I got a really good friend.
[time=1711] One of my best and dearest friends works with us right here on this staff and his name Steve Longbreak.
[time=1717] Steve Longbreak is, as many of you may know and some of you may not know and now after the day you all know, he is almost 50 years old.
[time=1726] Steve Longbreak is almost 50 years old.
[time=1730] I found out talking to him this week that every senior pastor that he has ever worked for has been younger than him.
[time=1740] Ever.
[time=1741] Some of you have known Steve for over 20 years, I have known him for five.
[time=1745] Have you ever known him once to have a bad attitude towards authority?
[time=1750] No, never once.
[time=1753] I have been with him for five years, one year now almost working in the position that I work with.
[time=1759] I am 37 years old.
[time=1760] I do not know a whole lot yet.
[time=1762] I feel like at times my mind and my heart and my sphere of wisdom is about a, it is a blip on when compared to the screen that he functions with.
[time=1773] And yet every day, every week, every month around here, I ask him, he is asked to do things and always there is that sense of surrender, always there is that sense of humility, always there is that sense of all.
[time=1785] And you know what?
[time=1786] There are two ways you have to be surrendered.
[time=1789] See Susie's hands.
[time=1790] There are two ways you have to do that.
[time=1791] You have to be surrendered like that to who first?
[time=1795] Who to God?
[time=1798] There has to be a sense of surrender to God first.
[time=1802] It says in Psalm 63, let me see that for a second, let me read this, in fact you can turn there if you would like, Psalm 63.
[time=1811] Open up there if you would.
[time=1818] It says in Psalm 63, verses one to eight, I just want to give you the sense, all right?
[time=1824] I want you to see for yourself in the pages of Scripture.
[time=1829] Some of the words and some of the descriptions that I believe come with a surrendered life.
[time=1833] Write this down.
[time=1834] Psalm 63, 1 to 8, oh God thou art my God.
[time=1837] I shall seek the earnestly, my soul thirsts for the, my flesh yearns for thee, in a dry
[time=1844] and weary land where there is no water, thus I have beheld thee in the sanctuary.
[time=1848] To see thy power and thy glory, because thy loving kindness is better than life, my lips will praise thee.
[time=1854] So I will bless thee as long as I live.
[time=1856] I will lift up my hands and thy name.
[time=1859] My soul is satisfied as with marrow and fatness and my mouth offers praises with joyful lips.
[time=1866] When I remember thee on my bed, I meditate on thee in the night watches, for thou has been my help.
[time=1870] And in the shadow of thy wings, I sing for joy.
[time=1873] My soul clings to thee, thy right hand upholds me.
[time=1879] It says a surrendered posture, right there.
[time=1883] Go back to Hebrews 13.
[time=1887] Back to Hebrews 13, we surrender individually before our God and in the life of the fellowship
[time=1893] we surrender to those who lead.
[time=1895] That's right, our posture and our attitude towards those who lead is to be, as it says there in Hebrews 13, verse 17 where it says obey your leaders and submit to them.
[time=1906] That's talking about more than action.
[time=1908] That's talking folks about an attitude.
[time=1910] That's talking about a heart.
[time=1913] Obey your leaders and submit to them why, for they keep watch over your souls as those who will give an account.
[time=1920] Let them do this with joy and not with grief, for this would be unprofitable for you.
[time=1928] So there you have it, Christ gets formed when the word of God is possessed, when there's
[time=1934] a heart of worship and when we have surrendered lives.
[time=1937] The second thing we have to be committed to is community.
[time=1943] Write it down.
[time=1944] There must be a commitment to community.
[time=1946] We talked about this recently, Koine Nia.
[time=1948] You guys can relax for a second.
[time=1950] Koine Nia, fellowship, living life together.
[time=1955] There's a quote I want you to read, just real simple, but please take note of it.
[time=1960] Community is when a shared faith in Christ, which we in this family have, if in fact we know Him.
[time=1966] The shared faith in Christ compels us to honestly live and share life together.
[time=1975] To honestly live and share life together.
[time=1977] Why do I have that word honestly written there?
[time=1981] I'll tell you why, because everywhere you go, people talk about community, everywhere you go in the church these days, folks talk about the value of accountability.
[time=1993] I've had people even ask me in recent, very recent years, here in this family.
[time=2002] I've had people ask me, "Hey, how come hard questions weren't asked of Him?"
[time=2011] Where was the accountability?
[time=2014] How come nobody ever sat down and looked Him in the eye and said, "Hey, how you doing in this or that arena of your life?" And you know what my answer is to them?
[time=2026] There was, often, daily, they just what, lied.
[time=2037] You see people, community and accountability and walking through life together, it's only as effective as you and I are willing to be what, honest.
[time=2048] And if you're not going to be honest or if I'm not going to be honest, then it's a waste of time.
[time=2053] But if there is a sense where in relationship with Christ, you're compelled and I'm compelled
[time=2059] to live life together and you're willing and I'm willing to live it together, honestly.
[time=2065] Some amazing things can happen.
[time=2067] Now here's what community doesn't look like, face that way, all right?
[time=2072] I'll take that, fold your arms, face that way, you turn around, face the choir loft back there, fold your arms, you look that way, face you right there, fold your arms.
[time=2082] All right, that is not community, but you know what?
[time=2088] Sometimes that's the posture of local churches today, and I don't think that's what God
[time=2097] had in mind.
[time=2099] I don't think that's what he had in mind at all when he talked about coin anemia.
[time=2103] I think what he had in mind was this, steep turn around here and just all three of you just kind of come together here, turn around, just put your arm around him, go ahead and put your arm around him, just stand there and kind of face out here and just enjoy that for a second.
[time=2121] That, you see that?
[time=2123] We could switch it back to the other picture for a second if you needed us to.
[time=2126] You remember what that looked like, backs turned to each other?
[time=2130] That right there is what I think our Lord had in mind when in John 17, he prayed what?
[time=2137] And I think the words are going to be there for you, and you want to write that one down.
[time=2140] In John 17, verse 20, Jesus himself prayed these words.
[time=2144] I do not ask, this is his high priestly prayer to the Father, he says, I do not ask in behalf
[time=2150] of these alone, these referring to his disciples, but for those who believe in me through their word, you see, the Lord knew that they would spread his word, the Lord knew the disciples would carry out the great commission and the Lord knew that as they carried that out the church would grow and others would come to faith in Christ and with the others who would come to faith in mind, who are now today eventually you and me, what did he say?
[time=2176] That they may all be, say it, say it louder, one.
[time=2182] And as thou, Father, are in me and I in thee, that they also may be in us, that the world
[time=2192] may what?
[time=2194] So the world believing has a lot to do with the way we're willing to be one, community,
[time=2205] living life together, honestly.
[time=2209] They may be in us, that the world may believe that thou didst send me.
[time=2213] We talk about it often and others talk about it and we've grown and been encouraged by
[time=2219] others who are engaged in and given to this very kind of ministry.
[time=2223] They talk about loving and we've talked about it before here, loving and being loved, serving
[time=2229] and being served.
[time=2230] And I say these things, you look at these guys and you look at this posture right here,
[time=2236] the family of God, the local church, loving and being loved, serving and being served.
[time=2243] Forgiving and being, what, forgiven, knowing and being known, it's a wonderful picture.
[time=2252] And the enemy wants, back to your other positions, backs to each other, arms folded, spread apart.
[time=2258] People, that's what the enemy wants, right there.
[time=2263] The enemy is real and his attacks are vicious and he wants for you and for me to try to approach life in this place like that.
[time=2270] And when you and I try to approach life like that, it doesn't work.
[time=2274] Churches get divided, relationships get broken, God's work doesn't get done.
[time=2280] And they don't believe because we're not what, one.
[time=2285] Okay, you guys can go back to just hanging out, thanks.
[time=2289] Number three, third vital truth, we've got to be committed to.
[time=2293] Absolutely have to be committed to, would be a commitment to write this down.
[time=2297] Spiritual gifts.
[time=2303] Spiritual gifts must be taught.
[time=2306] Spiritual gifts must be understood.
[time=2309] Spiritual gifts must be identified and spiritual gifts in the end.
[time=2313] It's all for not unless they're exercised, right?
[time=2319] Spiritual gifts, the spiritual abilities, the unique and supernatural gifts that God gives to every individual who comes to faith in him.
[time=2328] And he gives them to us in the body.
[time=2330] It says in 1 Corinthians, open up your Bibles to 1 Corinthians 11, excuse me, 12.
[time=2340] First Corinthians 12.
[time=2358] The good verse one.
[time=2359] First Corinthians 12 verse one, now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, Paul writing here to the church at Corinth, I do not want you to be unaware.
[time=2368] Good on to verse seven, but to each one is given the manifestation of the spirit for the common good, verse 11, you there?
[time=2377] But one in the same spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually
[time=2384] just as he wills, for even as the body is one and yet has many members and all the members
[time=2390] of the body, though they are many, are one body, so also is Christ, four by one spirit.
[time=2396] We were all baptized.
[time=2398] You see it there?
[time=2399] Four by one spirit, we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves are free and we were all made to drink of one spirit.
[time=2406] For the body is not one member but many.
[time=2408] If the foot should say, because I am not a hand, I am not part of the body, it is not
[time=2414] for this reason any the less a part of the body.
[time=2417] And if the ear should say, because I am not an eye, I am not a part of the body, it is not for this reason any the less a part of the body.
[time=2425] If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be?
[time=2428] If the whole body were hearing, where would the sense of smell be?
[time=2431] But now God has placed the members, each one of them in the body, just as he desired.
[time=2438] And if they were all one member, where would the body be?
[time=2445] Do you know your spiritual gift or gifts?
[time=2450] Have you identified them?
[time=2452] Are you exercising them in this body?
[time=2456] Let me show you what that doesn't look like.
[time=2459] Let's look at what that doesn't look like in the life of a church.
[time=2466] All three of you, hands up, hands out like this and just face out there to them and then
[time=2472] just start doing this.
[time=2475] Just keep doing it, just keep doing it.
[time=2479] You see that?
[time=2481] Keep doing it.
[time=2485] That's what it doesn't look like.
[time=2487] In fact, watch this.
[time=2490] Every one of you stand up.
[time=2492] Keep doing it, you guys.
[time=2493] Every one of you stand up.
[time=2496] We'll just make sure this visual sinks in.
[time=2500] Every one of you, put your hands out, start doing this.
[time=2503] Go ahead, everybody, do this and look around and I'm not being funny, okay?
[time=2510] Look around.
[time=2512] I don't know about you, but that looks so uninviting.
[time=2517] I'm not being funny, I'm being serious.
[time=2520] That looks bad, doesn't it?
[time=2525] Give me, give me, give me.
[time=2529] That is not what he had in mind for this place, for our hearts and our attitudes, thanks.
[time=2535] You can stop.
[time=2536] You guys keep going.
[time=2537] You guys can sit down.
[time=2542] It would be a good time for the offering, yeah, it's true.
[time=2547] Word my tuck, could you guys hand me those right there?
[time=2549] Let me show you what it's supposed to look like, you guys can stop.
[time=2553] Put your arm up there across you, just like this, there you go, you're just going to kind
[time=2560] of drape this up here on there, there you go, same thing, there you go, put this over
[time=2571] here, there we go, that's a little better I think, servants at his beck and call, ready
[time=2585] to go, what do you need, when do you need it, how can I help, anything, oh sure, yeah,
[time=2594] that too, I'd be happy to, now sure, how about again next week, how about again next
[time=2601] month, whatever you need, wherever I've got to go, whatever I've got to do, let me know,
[time=2608] I am here for you, Lord, I am here for you, ministry leader, I am here for you, in whatever
[time=2616] capacity, in whatever quadrant or arena of this place we might be talking about, it's when you and you and you and you and everybody in this family walks around in a sense, ready,
[time=2629] name it, I'll do it, ready to go, now, here's the great thing about this, this whole idea
[time=2639] of getting and not giving, this whole idea of being willing to offer so very much, we can
[time=2646] even get more specific about it because God says that there are those in the church who are supposed to lead, strike a leadership pose here, Steve, let's take the hill, let's
[time=2659] come out, absolutely, so some in the church are supposed to lead while maintaining what,
[time=2668] servants hearts, some in the church are supposed to teach, go ahead and let's just hold this
[time=2675] in this hand over here, like this, can you put this hand underneath there, there you go, can you hold like that, some are supposed to teach, some are supposed to teach little
[time=2685] kids, the Bible, some are supposed to teach big kids, the Bible, a word of God's to be taught but while being taught, there needs to be a servant's heart. Others are to, the
[time=2697] Bible says extend mercy, put your arm around somebody, here's Susie, come up alongside somebody and extend mercy while still being a what, a servant, absolutely. And it's an
[time=2712] amazing thing when you think about it folks and sometimes we don't say it like this and we need to because it brings the point home, the church people and you can even say this with me, it's really simple and sometimes I shake my head that it's so simple and yet we seem to struggle still at times to pull it off but we're going to keep trying. The church is to be led by those with the leadership gift, taught, the church is to be taught by
[time=2738] those with the teaching gift, the church is to be organized and administered by those
[time=2745] with the gift of administration, radical gifts are to be given in the church by those
[time=2754] with the gift of giving, people are to be loved and cared for, mercy is to be extended by those
[time=2761] with the mercy gift. It's got to be a huge commitment, a huge commitment to following
[time=2769] Christ having Him formed in our hearts, a huge commitment to community, a big commitment
[time=2777] to this whole idea of spiritual gifts and then fourthly stewardship, I'll take these, stewardship.
[time=2790] We must be committed to stewardship and what do we mean by that? We've talked about that
[time=2797] a lot recently and we're not going to talk a whole lot more about it this morning. Stewardship is what you do and what I do with the finances, with the gifts that God's given you. Stewardship
[time=2811] has to do with how we handle that. Do we handle that sacrificially? Do we handle that with a kingdom mindset? Do we handle that with a real sense of humility towards Him? Here's
[time=2823] what good stewardship wouldn't look like. Put your hands in your pocket like nobody's
[time=2832] getting in there, like a garden, all right? There you go. That's good. Fold your hands,
[time=2838] cross your chest, scowl, give me that scowl again. Give me that, you know, fold your arms across your, give me that scowl again, there you go. And you got any change on you, Steve?
[time=2846] Any change? You got some change? You got any change there, Richard? There you go. There's
[time=2853] a penny, Susie, hold that up like you're really proud of it, all right? Put these back in, I'll let you put them back in your pocket, there you go. All right. Get that penny, Susie, like you're proud of it, all right? Way up there in the air, like it, all right? That wouldn't be the picture of biblical stewardship. Picture would be this, you can give Richard
[time=2873] the penny. Seriously, do you have any, you got a wallet? You got a wallet? You don't,
[time=2881] you don't, what do we got here? Open it up, Susie, you know, hey Rick, come up here with you, you know, I'm just kidding, you stay there. Okay, you got a five, what do you got?
[time=2889] You got a twenty? Dude, look at you. Let's, let's, Kevin, we're going to lunch with the
[time=2899] wilds today. Let's do this. You got a twenty? Alright, here, there's a twenty. Now you keep
[time=2906] your five, he's got a twenty. There you go, there's a twenty, there's a twenty. Put that five away. You guys owe him those back when we're done here. Okay, hold it up in your, hold it up in your hands just like this. You got to put that five away first, go ahead Richard. Put the five away, don't put the twenty in your wallet, just put the five away, put your wallet away, there you go, there you go. And then we're going to hold it in our hands up, hold it up, hold it up, there it is. It's right there. Just a picture, but
[time=2939] it's a good picture, you know why it's a good picture? And it's not a good picture because it's twenty and not five. It's a good picture because, because it's yours, God. Here, I don't
[time=2950] have my hands in my pocket. I'm not guarding my checkbook. I'm not living life with this mentality that somehow, some way, it's all mine. Because I know God, it's not mine. I
[time=2962] know none of it is mine. I know all of it is yours. And so whatever you give me, I just, I just hold it right back up to you and you just say, Lord, take it back. And if you want to leave me, some leave me, some. But here, God, it's yours. It is all yours. And that's the posture. That's what takes place when we're committed to that kind of truth, that
[time=2981] very principle of stewardship. Okay. Twenty's back to Steve. Here we go. Thank you. Alright,
[time=2991] alright. Last thing, I don't know what I got my wallet out for. Last thing, fifth thing,
[time=2999] there has got to be a commitment to evangelism. It has to be people. Remember what we asked
[time=3006] earlier? We asked, I think the second question this morning was, were we going to be a church that had a redemptive posture? A church that had a redemptive posture? What's the, what's
[time=3021] the evangelistic posture of a whole lot of churches today? You know what it is? Hold
[time=3028] that again. Face that way. Hold it against your chest like nobody's going to get to it right there. I want you guys to just kind of stand right here together, both of you're just kind of hanging out. And I want you just to be, kind of look up in the balcony, kind of run that in, and just kind of hang out together and just be completely and thoroughly bored.
[time=3051] You could be laughing and bored. It's okay, Susie. Just be thoroughly and completely bored.
[time=3057] But kind of just put your hand up on our shoulder there, Richard. Just be bored. Be bored. Yeah.
[time=3064] In some places, in some places, you guys, this is it. In some places, this is the evangelistic
[time=3079] posture of the church. I got what I got and you're not getting any of it. And I'm keeping
[time=3086] it all for myself. And you can live life, completely bored, lost, confused and wondering
[time=3092] what in the world's going on and never, ever will the two meet. The truth is kept from
[time=3098] those in need of the truth. Hurting confused people are kept at bay, and people die and
[time=3104] go to hell all the time. And the church keeps this kind of evangelistic posture. Now, was
[time=3115] that the approach of our Lord? Is that in any way it all represents the heart of God?
[time=3121] Is it the approach of Jesus? I mean, why did Jesus, someone said this past week and it
[time=3127] just kind of got emblazoned on my brain, why did Jesus stay at the well? Tired and worn
[time=3134] down. Why did he stay at the well in John 4? Because he knew somebody was coming who
[time=3142] was lost and hurting and confused. Why did he call Zacchaeus the little midget swindler
[time=3149] out of the tree down to have dinner with him? Why? Because he loved him. Because he loved
[time=3157] him and his heart broke for him. Why did he, with a resounding sense of righteous indignation,
[time=3165] lamb-blast the Pharisees in Matthew 23, write that down. Write it down. Matthew 23, read through Matthew 23, and as you read through Matthew 23, don't get lost in all the verbiage
[time=3176] because there's a lot of it, because he absolutely slaughters these guys verbally. He cuts them down to size, Jesus, to the Pharisees and Sadducees. And as you read through that, you realize that what was at the bottom of that was that he was so righteously angry over
[time=3192] the fact that the Pharisees and the Sadducees were keeping people away from what? Faith.
[time=3200] They were leading people in the other direction and it broke his heart. That's why he stayed at the well. That's why he brought Zechaeus out of a tree. That's why he said what he said to Pharisees who were leading people away from the gospel. Why in Luke 15 does
[time=3216] he talk about a lost sheep and a lost coin and a lost prodigal son? Because his heart
[time=3225] breaks for things that are lost, things that are far from home. And then at the end of
[time=3231] Luke 15, he gives us this picture and it's a great picture. You should read it again sometime.
[time=3236] The end of Luke 15, he talks about the celebration in heaven. The celebration in heaven and the
[time=3244] heavenly hosts when one comes to faith in Christ. And you know what? The posture should change and the posture can change. Steve, I want you to come over here. Keep that Bible right there, but just come over here to these two. And I want you just to put your hand on their shoulder right there. Kind of come back here a little bit. There you go. And I want you guys to kind of go from board to kind of looking over there at Steve out of the corner of your eyes, kind of. Keep your hand up there, Richard. Okay. Because you're not changed yet. Your hearts, your posture, it's still kind of the same. But now all of
[time=3278] a sudden somebody's hands on your shoulder. And you're looking at Steve with kind of a leery kind of a hopeful look. You know? Yeah. And you know what? No matter how they look
[time=3290] at him, no matter how they look at him, Steve's hand stays where? Right there. Because Steve's
[time=3298] got hope in his heart and Steve's got the book of life. And Steve has the truth. And Steve
[time=3304] has the answer, not in his heart, but in that book, to everything these two board confused wondering seekers are feeling. These heartbreaks for those that are far from home. And you
[time=3321] know what? They come home. They come home. They find hope and forgiveness. And they
[time=3329] finally get to live life without shame. And they finally get to live life with hope for the future when they bump into a church. Led by the Word of God, when they bump into
[time=3340] a church that prevails, when they bump into a church that gets up every day, trying to love their God and their families and doing all they can to help people far from God find
[time=3351] and follow Christ. Now, thanks you guys. You guys can sit down and get these guys a big,
[time=3365] big, big hand. Please. I want you to write this down. Please stay with me here. Write this down. Please write this down. Acts in the book of Acts in the third chapter, which
[time=3376] is where we got to this morning. I'm going to give you some things to look up as you go home. And I mean it. Please. Tonight is a family. Tonight is an individual. Sometime in the next couple of days with your small group or accountability group, some time today or tomorrow, early in the week, please. I want you to look this up. I want you to see,
[time=3397] go to the Acts slide, if you would. In Acts chapter three, there's some things that we see about the message. Steve was holding the Bible, right? And this is what we bring to a lost and hurting Word, the Word of God. There's a message. And I want you to write these four things down. And then I want you to find them on your own, okay? The message that we send, and you see it perfectly laid out by Peter in Acts chapter three. The message
[time=3422] that we teach and the message that this proclaims, look at verses, when you get home, look at
[time=3428] verses 16 all the way through the end of the chapter. And what you're going to see is this. Faith is found in Christ. Faith in Christ and Christ alone saves. Write that down. Faith
[time=3439] in Christ saves. Second thing you're going to see is this. Faith in Christ brings strength.
[time=3445] Faith in Christ brings strength. You saw it over here on the steps this morning. It brought a physical strength, but it brings not only a physical strength, but a strength to the soul. Faith in Christ brings strength. Thirdly, you're going to see this, and please write these down. True faith brings about repentance. When you and I have genuinely embraced Christ,
[time=3466] there is, remember we talked about repentance a few weeks ago, changing our what? Changing our minds about God, changing our minds about sin, moving in a different door. That's what
[time=3479] happens. People begin to repent when true faith is embraced. Fourth thing, don't miss
[time=3486] this towards the end of the chapter. Faith in any one or anything else other than who.
[time=3494] Christ will destroy. For a cassette copy of today's message, please call and request the
