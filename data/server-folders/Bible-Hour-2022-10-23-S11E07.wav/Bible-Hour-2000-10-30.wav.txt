[time=0] (upbeat music) - Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service
[time=12] of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=14] Thank you for joining us.
[time=15] We trust that the music and message from God's word will help you in your Christian walk.
[time=20] Now let's join our service.
[time=22] (upbeat music)
[time=186] - You know in these heartbeat videos, it's been our intent
[time=192] to bring to you the family of Black Hawk, our ministry, to highlight for you and show you different things that God's doing in different ministries.
[time=200] And today we bring to you the living Christmas tree.
[time=204] And many of you understand that for over 20 years, the living Christmas tree has been making an impact for the kingdom here in Fort Wayne.
[time=212] And I want you to know in the five years that I've been here, there's something about the tree that I just love.
[time=218] And the thing I love about it, one of the things I love most about it is that this church, this family, from the end of October to the end of December just comes together.
[time=228] My hope is that every one of us would in some way think about, pray about, and consider how you might participate, how you might could contribute to what God's gonna do again this year through the living Christmas tree.
[time=240] Give it some thought.
[time=242] Talk to Scott, Sharon, talk to me.
[time=244] But be ready for what God might do not only through you but to you as you give yourself to the tree this year.
[time=252] - Early in 1978, I heard the plan of salvation for the very first time.
[time=258] Later that year, someone gave me tickets to attend the living Christmas tree here at Black Hawk.
[time=264] It was at that concert that I again heard the plan of salvation through graphics and music, telling the story of the cradle to the cross.
[time=274] When Pastor prayed the sinner's prayer at that concert, I accepted the Lord as my savior.
[time=280] And for the first time in my life, I felt incredibly whole, loved, and accepted.
[time=286] As each Christmas season approaches, the living Christmas tree becomes a major priority in my life.
[time=294] Jeremiah 2913 states, "You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all of your heart." I believe the God used this ministry to bring this seeker to himself.
[time=306] - Hi, I'm Bob Purdy.
[time=308] I've had the opportunity over the last three years here at Black Hawk to coordinate the living Christmas tree tear down phase.
[time=316] That's where after the program is done, we as a team get to come in and take all of the structure
[time=324] and the decorations down.
[time=326] And one of the things that has been so fun to see, as well as a rewarding ministry, is the number of people that come right on the heels of Christmas, right in the thick of the holidays, and come together as a team with a giving spirit, and lend an hour or lend a few hours or a whole day to do everything, anything, from taking down decorations to helping to disassemble the steel.
[time=352] I want to challenge you, each of us, as a church, as part of this church, to consider the opportunity we have
[time=364] when it comes to volunteering our time.
[time=366] There's no greater reward, whether it's in the living Christmas tree or any other part of our church, but it is a great opportunity because whether we are building, performing,
[time=382] or tearing down, we get to have an opportunity, a hand in seeing people come to Christ and new souls in the Kingdom of Heaven.
[time=390] So think about it, come out and join the team this year and see what kind of things we do. Thanks.
[time=424] [MUSIC - 304 seconds]
[time=752] [APPLAUSE]
[time=756] Let me ask you a question this morning if I can.
[time=764] What comes to mind? What comes to your mind if I were to ask you to generate a list of enemies of the faith?
[time=774] Enemies of the faith. Who or what are the greatest adversaries today?
[time=782] Or even in the past, or possibly even in the future?
[time=786] Who are the greatest adversaries of Christianity throughout history?
[time=788] And even today, what out there is capable, or at least maybe committed to deadly destruction and damage to biblical Christianity?
[time=796] The enemies of the faith, some would name individuals.
[time=802] That's right. Some would list off individuals, specific leaders of movements determined to deliver a fatal blow to the faith.
[time=810] Powerful men or women who manipulate the truth with self-promoting agendas.
[time=816] Some might talk about or think of individuals.
[time=820] Some would speak up or list off some of the twisted and dangerous cults that exist today in our culture.
[time=826] Groups preying on PREY, preying on young minds, lonely hearts and confused souls.
[time=832] All for financial profit or to meet some perverted need for control in the mind and life of a cult leader.
[time=840] Some might even mention in a discussion of the enemies of the faith, a certain political party or social agenda
[time=846] that attempts to in some way move people away from fundamental values and truth.
[time=852] Enemies of the faith. What comes to your mind?
[time=856] Well, you know what the number one? The number one.
[time=862] Above and beyond all of those and others that may come to your mind.
[time=864] The number one adversary to Christianity is religion. Write it down.
[time=874] Religion. That's right.
[time=878] Religion is public enemy number one to the church.
[time=880] And what is religion? How will we this morning in our look at Acts chapter four define religion?
[time=888] Well, let's do it this way. And you might want to get this down.
[time=890] This may come up in conversation. This may be a part of everyday life for you.
[time=894] You may know people, as I do, who think this stuff through and grapple and wrestle with these issues all the time.
[time=902] What is religion?
[time=904] Public enemy number one to the church. What is it? Well, religion is this.
[time=908] Religion is any church, any organization or individual.
[time=914] Religion is encapsuled in any church organization or individual that doesn't believe, teach or adhere to,
[time=922] that doesn't believe, teach or adhere to, and we'll start with John 14-6.
[time=928] Write it down. John chapter 14 verse six. I think it'll come on the screen for you right here.
[time=934] Religion doesn't believe this. Religion doesn't teach this. Religion doesn't adhere to this.
[time=940] Jesus said to the disciples when they asked, He said to them, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father, but through..."
[time=954] What's that last word say? Me. Just me. Nobody comes to the Father.
[time=962] Nobody finds eternal life. Nobody enters into glory. Nobody comes to the Father.
[time=968] Jesus said, "But through me." Religion doesn't believe that. Religion doesn't really teach that.
[time=974] Religion doesn't adhere to that, nor do they teach, believe or adhere to Ephesians chapter two verses eight and nine.
[time=982] Write it down. Turn there if you'd like, or you can read it with me on the screens.
[time=988] Where Paul said to the church at Ephesus, reminding them of the gift of their salvation.
[time=994] Where Paul said, "For by what?" Grace. Say it louder. For by what? Grace. You have been saved.
[time=1000] Through what? Faith. And that not of yourselves. It is the gift of God.
[time=1010] And in verse nine he says, "Not as a result of what?" Not as a result of works, that no one should boast.
[time=1020] People religion doesn't teach. Religion doesn't believe. Religion does not adhere to these truths.
[time=1030] There's no place for it. Religion that is. There's no place for it in the church.
[time=1036] If it doesn't save, it doesn't redeem, it just keeps people confused.
[time=1042] So religion is public. Enemy number one to the church. And again, please don't be confused.
[time=1054] Every religion has one basic characteristic. Its followers are trying to reach God or please God through their own efforts.
[time=1066] It goes on. Religions reach up toward God. Christianity is God reaching down to man.
[time=1074] Christianity claims that men have not on their own accord found God, but that God has drawn them to Himself.
[time=1082] Religion cringes at this thought. It insists that we try to be good enough to win God's favor.
[time=1090] It puts us on a treadmill, laboring to win His approval, but resulting in only frustration and failure.
[time=1098] End quote. Can I see the hands of anybody in this room who has ever struggled faced or had to deal with that right there?
[time=1108] Go ahead. It's everywhere. Religion is everywhere, people. And it is absolutely and categorically opposed to the truth.
[time=1124] Religion can even become hostile when we oppose its system. And maybe you've bumped into religion's hostility.
[time=1132] In Christ's day, it scoffed at Christ's own claims of deity.
[time=1138] It trembled in those days with rage when He said sin blocks our way to God.
[time=1142] It clenched its fists when Christ's followers preached. He was the only bridge to eternal life.
[time=1150] And then when it was faced with the freedom and healing, Jesus Christ provides.
[time=1154] Legalistic religion was ready to fight. And that is exactly what we see in our passage this morning.
[time=1160] The religious elite, the religious heavyweights square off against the under-trained Peter and John,
[time=1168] and their newest follower of Christ, the lame man. The lame beggar healed back in chapter 3.
[time=1174] And these religious heavyweights had no idea what they were in for.
[time=1178] They had no idea they had just picked a fight they could not win.
[time=1182] And so this morning I want to invite you to go with me to our text in Acts chapter 4.
[time=1186] And we're going to see some things here in Acts chapter 4, namely some eye opening, heart opening,
[time=1192] mind opening truths about religion.
[time=1196] The first thing you're going to see here is religious leaders enraged.
[time=1202] Mark that down, religious leaders enraged.
[time=1206] Let's go to chapter 4 verses 1, 2, and 3. And as they were speaking, referring back to the apostles again to the end of chapter 3, and as they were speaking to the people,
[time=1216] the priests and the captain of the temple guard and the Sadducees came upon them,
[time=1222] being greatly disturbed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
[time=1230] And they laid hands on them and put them in jail until the next day, for it was already evening.
[time=1236] Stop right there. You see, Peter was stirring up the religious waters.
[time=1240] A risen Savior by whose name all could find forgiveness and eternal life.
[time=1246] This kind of message threatened the religious establishment of that day.
[time=1252] It threatened the Sadducees. It threatened their faulty and inaccurate theology.
[time=1258] And more importantly, it threatened their self-appointed positions of authority that they possessed in that specific culture.
[time=1266] Now, the text mentions the Sadducees. Who were these men? What was this group about?
[time=1272] Commentators remind us that within the Jewish society, the Sadducees were the ruling class of what was supposed to be the people of God.
[time=1282] They were wealthy aristocrats. Politically, they had ingratiated themselves with the Romans and joined the perks of compromise.
[time=1290] They followed a policy of collaboration so that they now feared the subversive implications of the apostles' teaching.
[time=1298] Theologically, they denied the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead, which the apostles proclaimed in Christ.
[time=1304] They, the Sadducees, thus saw the apostles as both agitators and heretics, both disturbers of the peace and enemies of their truth.
[time=1316] And so agitated and full of insecurity, they initiate the very first persecution of the infant and early church, and they throw these men in jail.
[time=1330] They imprison them, lock them up. It's too late in the day. The trial will take place the next day, but they're going to put these guys in prison.
[time=1338] They're going to flex their muscle. They're going to show them who's in charge.
[time=1344] It's interesting. As the text progresses, does it appear as if the imprisonment was going to stop, successfully pushed back the gospel and stop this young church from succeeding?
[time=1356] What does it say there in verse 4? While this is going on, what's taking place? But many, it says.
[time=1362] But many of those who had heard the message believed, and the number of the men came to be about 5,000.
[time=1370] Just the men. It's just been a few weeks, people. And just the men equal 5,000 people coming to faith.
[time=1380] So they're going to put them on trial. And what we see taking place as we move on in the passage is really almost funny if it wasn't so sad.
[time=1390] They think it's time for a quick knockout blow. They think it's time for a bloody fight. And like fight fans gathering to see the heavyweight champ dismantle the underachieving and undertrained challenger, they settle in for what they believe is going to be a typical show of force.
[time=1406] What transpires, though, isn't a show of force, but instead an insightful and sad look at the second thing that we see in our passage this morning, religion exposed.
[time=1418] You're going to see some insightful things here. You're going to see their true colors. We're going to see six.
[time=1424] And I hope you'll get them all this morning. Six sad tragic truths about religion.
[time=1430] Six very sad and tragic truths about religion in this day. Six very sad and tragic truths about religion today, because folks, it hasn't changed.
[time=1440] The names are different. The approach is still the same. Six sad and tragic truths about religion as religion itself is exposed.
[time=1450] Look with me at those first couple of verses, verses five and six. And it came about on the next day that their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem.
[time=1460] And Anas, the high priest, was there in Caiaphas and John and Alexander, and all who were of high priestly dissent. Stop there.
[time=1470] Sad tragic truth, number one, write it down. When threatened, when threatened, religion tries to intimidate.
[time=1482] Have you ever felt in your own life the intimidation of religion? These guys did.
[time=1488] I tell you, the rulers, you can look back at the text, the rulers, the elders, the scribes, basically what we see here is the entire Sanhedrin.
[time=1504] The governing body of the nation of Israel is gathered together to like go to war against these two fishermen, these two simple guys, and this recently healed beggar.
[time=1520] Robes on, headdresses on, here we go, rally the troops, sound the horn, it's time to flex our muscle. Religion finds, write this down, religion finds security in numbers and force.
[time=1536] Religion finds security in numbers and force and intimidation, just think about it, think back to the Reformation, would you?
[time=1542] Think back to what Rome did to a young man named who, Luther.
[time=1550] When Luther, out of the goodness of his heart and out of his commitment to the truth, came to them and said, wait a minute, I think we've got this wrong.
[time=1560] Salvation comes by grace through faith, and the word of God needs to be in the hands of the who, the people.
[time=1570] Come on Rome, he's saying, and what does Rome do?
[time=1574] They blistered the kid.
[time=1578] Absolutely hung him out to dry, took him to trial, prosecuted him in front of the nation, excommunicated him from the faith.
[time=1588] They're going to show him, right?
[time=1590] That's what religion does when threatened.
[time=1592] Religion tries to intimidate.
[time=1596] Second thing we see from those two verses, and then we'll move on here in just a moment.
[time=1602] Second thing from verses 5 and 6, when unsure, here you go, when unsure, religion falls back on tradition.
[time=1610] When unsure, religion always falls back on tradition.
[time=1616] You see this governing body that gathers here in verses 5 and 6, the Sanhedrin, which had its roots back in numbers 11.
[time=1624] They were entrenched, they were steeped in tradition, and they frowned on and had no patience for this new teaching.
[time=1632] They, they were the guardians, they were the protectors, they were the interpreters of ancient truth.
[time=1640] And when challenged by Peter and John, they dug in deeper, burrowed their heels in the ground, unwilling to budge.
[time=1650] And if you wanted to put a quote, if you wanted to put a line, if you wanted to put a phrase that seems to always be attached to people who think in this fashion,
[time=1660] the first one that comes to my mind is, these are the folks that you hear this from, this is always how we've done it.
[time=1666] And we are going to keep doing it, because this is the way it's done.
[time=1672] Religion when unsure falls back on tradition.
[time=1676] Number three, look at verse seven, and when they had placed them in the center.
[time=1680] So here's the entire Sanhedrin, the elders, the scribes, the rulers, the captain of the guard.
[time=1684] They put these guys in the middle, and they surround them.
[time=1686] And when they had placed them in the center, verse seven, they began to inquire, by what power, or in what name have you done this?
[time=1696] The third sad and tragic truth about religion is that when suspicious religion always interrogates.
[time=1706] Religion always interrogates, threatened and insecure, unable to stand on the solid ground of truth, legalistic ritual, always attempts to make the one functioning under freedom.
[time=1718] The one who's right, the one who's conducting him or herself, the one who's going down roads allowed by God, religion always attempts to make the one functioning under freedom feel like the guilty party.
[time=1732] Have you ever felt that?
[time=1736] Ever bumped into that in your life, ever sensed that?
[time=1744] Firing off questions as if they'd committed a crime.
[time=1748] Religion has to maintain control.
[time=1752] That's what's at the root of all that.
[time=1754] See, religion has to maintain control, and so it demands answers.
[time=1760] Now, many times, if you just look at where we're at so far, many times, and under normal conditions, you get some good old intimidation going.
[time=1770] You get some good old tradition and some interrogation going, and somebody's going to back down.
[time=1774] Somebody, most people, are going to crack, but not Peter and John.
[time=1780] Guess why?
[time=1782] Well, because Peter and John were keenly aware of something.
[time=1786] They were keenly aware of something else about religion.
[time=1792] Look at verse eight, and we see the fourth sad and tragic truth about religion.
[time=1798] Verse eight, first phrase there, then Peter filled with the, what?
[time=1806] Holy Spirit, stop right there.
[time=1808] Then Peter filled with the Holy Spirit.
[time=1814] Sad, tragic truth, number four, religion people is void of the Holy Spirit.
[time=1820] The Spirit of God has no part, no place in religion.
[time=1824] He is nowhere to be found in the midst of religion.
[time=1830] Then Peter filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, rulers and elders of the people.
[time=1836] Here he goes.
[time=1836] If verse nine, if we are on trial today for a benefit done to a sick man as to how this man has been made well, let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom you crucified,
[time=1852] whom God raised from the dead by this name, this man stands here before you in good health.
[time=1860] He is the stone which was rejected by you, the builders, but which became the very corner stone.
[time=1870] Boy, he steps up, doesn't he?
[time=1872] In all of his confidence, no.
[time=1874] In all of his skill, no.
[time=1876] With all of his training, no.
[time=1878] Filled with the who?
[time=1880] Holy Spirit, amen.
[time=1884] Peter stood his ground and spoke the truth courageously, confident, not in himself, but in the Spirit.
[time=1890] Ever happened to you?
[time=1892] Have you ever had to say something, ever had to speak to a group of people, ever had to have a conversation with a friend and genuinely and sincerely sat down on the quietness of your heart and said, "Oh God, help me.
[time=1904] I don't know if I can do this.
[time=1908] Be with me." And then gone and said it, gone and done it, gone and given yourself to it, and then come back and sat down and thought to yourself later, where in the world did that come from?
[time=1920] Ever had that experience?
[time=1922] How did I say that?
[time=1924] How did you do that with what I had just...
[time=1928] It's an amazing thing.
[time=1932] Do you ever struggle?
[time=1934] Do you need to go and say something to somebody?
[time=1938] Ever struggle?
[time=1940] Or are you ever fearful when it comes to saying things that need to be said?
[time=1946] I am.
[time=1948] Ever nervous about saying what needs to be said, let's say to a seeking friend.
[time=1954] Let's start there.
[time=1956] Sometimes you and I find ourselves in wonderful, blessed situations where God's allowed us the privilege of building a friendship with someone who's asking the right questions and trying to figure out faith and God and what it means to be in relationship with him.
[time=1974] Sometimes those situations get the points where things need to be said.
[time=1978] Questions do get asked.
[time=1980] You know what I mean? A few weeks ago, I was in the office with a good friend who would be in that category.
[time=1986] I'll never forget it. He said to me, this was a quote.
[time=1988] So what's this hell thing all about?
[time=1994] Well, you know, everything's going great until then.
[time=1998] I mean, we've been just moving along just fine months of great relationship building and questions being asked and now it's time to tell them about hell.
[time=2008] That it's not a myth that it's real and that God is a God of love, but he's also a God of justice.
[time=2016] I don't know if that would be hard for you.
[time=2018] It was hard for me.
[time=2020] Took one of those deep breaths mixed with a prayer and off we went.
[time=2024] It's hard for you.
[time=2026] It's challenging for you to say things that need to be said to a seeking friend.
[time=2030] How about a spouse?
[time=2034] How about a daughter?
[time=2036] You see things.
[time=2038] You witness stuff.
[time=2040] You're aware of things going on.
[time=2042] You're not blind.
[time=2044] You know him.
[time=2044] You know her and you know something's not right.
[time=2048] You see what's going on.
[time=2050] You watch the choices that are being made and your heart is burdened and your spirit is concerned.
[time=2054] And you need to go and sit down and ask a few difficult questions.
[time=2062] You've got a good friend who's making foolish and unwise choices.
[time=2068] I know for a fact there's somebody in this room, probably many in this room this morning.
[time=2074] And you need to say something.
[time=2078] And you're scared.
[time=2080] And you're nervous.
[time=2080] And you want to be light.
[time=2082] And you want to be well thought of.
[time=2084] Write this down.
[time=2084] Would you?
[time=2086] Somebody gave this to me years ago.
[time=2086] It's a simple prayer.
[time=2088] I pray often.
[time=2090] I would venture to say I pray this prayer three to four times a week.
[time=2096] Because I try my very best to be faithful to say things that need to be said.
[time=2100] And I'm so very thankful that there's people in my life who feel the same way about me and they ask questions that need to be asked.
[time=2106] And they say things that need to be said.
[time=2108] Somebody told me this once and I wrote it down and I've never lost it or I've never forgotten it.
[time=2112] It's just a prayer.
[time=2112] Holy Spirit, fill me.
[time=2114] I need to go have this conversation, right?
[time=2116] Holy Spirit, fill me.
[time=2120] Please strengthen my mind.
[time=2122] In other words, strengthen my mind.
[time=2124] And the mind is where I realize what is right and true and what needs to be done, right?
[time=2128] There's a sense where that just mentally that comes together through the Spirit of God and the Word of God.
[time=2134] Please, Holy Spirit, fill me.
[time=2136] Strengthen my mind.
[time=2136] Give me courage in my heart.
[time=2140] Because in my heart sometimes I get weak and in my heart sometimes I slide back.
[time=2146] Give me strength in my mind.
[time=2148] Give me courage in my heart.
[time=2148] Give me sensitivity in my spirit.
[time=2150] Because I can know it's the right thing to say, have courage to say it, but say it all wrong.
[time=2156] And it can be offensive.
[time=2158] Give me strength in my mind.
[time=2160] Give me courage in my heart.
[time=2162] Give me sensitivity in my spirit.
[time=2164] You know, people, Peter was used by God to strengthen a local church as he opened his mouth.
[time=2170] You can do the very same thing.
[time=2172] Strengthen us.
[time=2172] Build us up.
[time=2174] Encourage us.
[time=2174] Keep us on track.
[time=2176] Open your mouth.
[time=2178] Say what needs to be said.
[time=2180] Well, look at verse 12.
[time=2182] Verse 12 clearly implies something else that is tragic and sad about religion.
[time=2188] It says there in verse 12, Peter continuing on and he says, "And there is salvation in no one else for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must be saved."
[time=2204] Although he is clear and bold in his proclamation of the truth, the fifth sad and tragic truth about religion is this.
[time=2212] Religion is unfazed by the gospel.
[time=2216] Religion at its core.
[time=2218] Religion at its heart is unfazed by the gospel.
[time=2220] Chuck Swindall said it this way.
[time=2222] Religion.
[time=2224] See if this doesn't sound familiar to some of you.
[time=2226] Religion walks the path of love and good deeds but eventually faces a fork in the road.
[time=2232] Follow Christ or follow a religious system.
[time=2236] This truth often offends the religious because they believe salvation comes as a result of their own spiritual performance.
[time=2246] They are unmoved by his death and cold to their own need for salvation.
[time=2252] End quote.
[time=2254] You know why religion is cold?
[time=2258] Do you understand why religion is so unmoved by the truth because the number one sin of religion people is pride.
[time=2268] Write it down, mark it, circle it, think that one through, the number one sin of religion is pride.
[time=2278] What did the rich young ruler, the rule keeping rich young ruler walk away?
[time=2282] He wouldn't humble himself.
[time=2286] He wouldn't give away all that he had and follow Christ.
[time=2288] No, he was into accomplishing, keeping rules, maintaining a spiritual performance.
[time=2294] You see that story in Luke 18.
[time=2298] The number one sin of religion is pride.
[time=2300] You see because the whole thing, the way it works, the way it functions, everything we've already said about religion so far just plays in to this mindset that it's about me.
[time=2308] It's not about him, it's not about what he did, it's not about what he sacrificed or accomplished.
[time=2314] It's about me and it's about what I can do and it's about what I can accomplish and it's about the ducks that I can have set up in a row.
[time=2322] It's all about me.
[time=2326] It's why it's unfazed so many times by the truth.
[time=2330] There's one last truth about religion and you've got to see this.
[time=2334] Look at verses 13 and 14, you there?
[time=2338] It says, "Now as they observed the confidence of Peter and John and understood that they were uneducated men and untrained men, they were marveling."
[time=2350] The Sadducees, the Sanhedrin, marveling.
[time=2354] And they began to recognize them as having been with Jesus.
[time=2358] And seeing verse 14, the man who had been healed standing with them, they had nothing to say in reply.
[time=2368] They were silenced.
[time=2372] Don't forget now, these men in the Sanhedrin, these elders, these rulers, the captain of the guard, these guys knew the beggar.
[time=2380] They knew who he was.
[time=2382] They walked by his mat daily back when he was lame.
[time=2386] And now they, the same men, saw that same individual standing in front of them.
[time=2390] And what did it say?
[time=2392] They had nothing to say.
[time=2400] All the religious, heavyweights, the impressive crowd of robe-wearing, rule-making, spiritual giants that had gathered.
[time=2408] They could debate theory and they could debate law until the sun went down, but they could not refute the facts.
[time=2416] They could not refute what was standing right in front of them and what was standing right in front of them.
[time=2422] People on educated men who lived and spoke with conviction and passion and authority and a once crippled man who now walked.
[time=2432] Sad and tragic truth number six, religion is silenced by transformed life.
[time=2440] I'll please hear this, ritual and tradition people, ceremony and effort never has, never does and never will change a life, ever.
[time=2452] In fact, they just in the end keep people away from that which has been so freely offered and that is called grace and that is called forgiveness and that is called hope.
[time=2466] In these remaining few verses we come to our last point of the morning and what you see here is religions authority found empty.
[time=2476] Religions authority found empty.
[time=2480] These guys are scrambling.
[time=2482] These guys are scared and these guys don't know what to do now.
[time=2486] And so they muster up one last effort, look at verse 15, but when they had ordered them to go aside out of the council they began the Sanhedrin.
[time=2496] They began to confer with one another saying what shall we do with these men?
[time=2502] For the fact that a noteworthy miracle has taken place through them is apparent to all who live in Jerusalem and we cannot deny it.
[time=2510] But in order that it may not spread any further among the people let us warn them to speak no more to any man in this name.
[time=2518] And when they had summoned them they commanded them not to speak or teach at all.
[time=2524] In the name of Jesus Peter and John answered and said whether it is right in the sight of God to give heed to you rather than to God you be the judge.
[time=2532] For we almost sounds like Shadrach, Meshach and Amendigo back in Daniel 3 telling Nebuchadnezzar what they thought of his edict.
[time=2540] It's that same kind of spirit, it's that same kind of bravery, it's that same kind of boldness.
[time=2546] Verse 20, "For we cannot stop speaking what we have seen and heard."
[time=2552] And when they had threatened them further, so that wasn't enough, right?
[time=2556] They come back at them again shaking their fingers and flexing their religious muscle.
[time=2562] When they had threatened them further they let them go finding no basis on which they might punish them on account of the people
[time=2568] because they were all glorifying God for what had happened.
[time=2574] For the man verse 22 was more than 40 years old on whom this miracle of healing had been performed.
[time=2582] In a weak feeble attempt to muster a little more intimidation they tell these impassioned followers of Christ to keep their mouths shut.
[time=2592] Somebody once said, somebody once compared it to standing in front of a runaway freight train and holding a hand up and saying, "Stop, please."
[time=2604] It wasn't going to happen.
[time=2606] The fact is Christianity was gaining steam and nothing or no one could stand in its way.
[time=2612] Peter in essence says, "We will speak the truth. Jesus Christ saves."
[time=2618] You guys are all wet.
[time=2626] And the gospel grows and the church continues to be birthed.
[time=2630] And by the thousands people were coming to know Christ.
[time=2638] Hey, some things just to take home this morning.
[time=2642] Some things to think through just in your own heart and life, all right?
[time=2648] Because we got to do that. This just can't be, what's the text say?
[time=2652] This just can't be a reminder of truth. It has to be a reminder of the truth followed by a willingness in your life and a willingness in mind to live the truth out.
[time=2662] To bring application to what God's Word has said.
[time=2668] So some things to think about this morning. Just a couple.
[time=2672] First of all, let me just ask you this.
[time=2674] The passage here that we've just gone through shows us that what we need.
[time=2680] And this I would just offer to anybody here this morning.
[time=2684] Again, I don't know all of you. I don't know where you're at this morning.
[time=2686] I'm not sure of the status of your spiritual journey.
[time=2690] Don't know where you stand with respect to Christ and salvation and the truth and a relationship with the living God.
[time=2698] I don't know your position. So I just offer this to all who hear.
[time=2702] The passage we just studied. The truths that we've just seen and interacted with.
[time=2708] Tell us and show us that what we need is an authentic personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=2716] It shows us that we need truth people, not tradition.
[time=2720] This passage shows us we need to follow Christ and His Word, not a set of man-made rules.
[time=2728] So this morning we ask you, and I ask you, honestly, and with respect for wherever you may be, do you know Him?
[time=2736] Do you know Him this morning?
[time=2740] Have you experienced what it's like to move away from tradition and rules and intimidation and interrogation?
[time=2746] And have you tasted of what it's like to live in a loving relationship with a heavenly Father who gave His Son that you might live
[time=2754] and experienced the forgiveness of sin and the hope of eternity?
[time=2758] Do you know Him today? And are you willing and are you ready to follow Him today?
[time=2766] Not rules, but Him. Not mandates, but truth.
[time=2770] And what is it this morning that would be keeping you from making that kind of commitment?
[time=2776] What is it or who is it that would be standing in the way of you truly and honestly and sincerely giving your heart to Him?
[time=2782] And Eson's saying, "You know what I give up?
[time=2786] Religion's too tough. The bar's too high. I can't get there." Which is the truth, you can't.
[time=2792] It wants to make you feel that somehow, some way you can, that you can do enough, say enough, be enough, accomplish enough, but you can't.
[time=2804] And so this morning, maybe you're here just flat out tired, weary of the effort with a heart that maybe is open to grace and forgiveness
[time=2814] and strength to live life the way God called you to live life.
[time=2822] You've got to ask the question.
[time=2824] And whenever I'm in conversations with, and I find myself in these conversations, every once in a while, you know, you sit down with a bunch of leaders,
[time=2832] a bunch of guys from different places, and sometimes you know there's this push to be, what's the word, ecumenical?
[time=2840] Sometimes there's this push to all put our arms around each other and all support each other and all kind of stand together, because after all, it's just one faith, it's one church.
[time=2850] And there's a part of me, you who know me know that there's a huge part of me, just me, Kelly, the way God made me, where I want to join hands with people.
[time=2858] The more the better, right, as we move down a common road, but you've got to be careful.
[time=2864] You have to be careful, and I have to be careful, and not in a belligerent way and not in an insensitive way, but the fact is, you know what, it's not all one thing.
[time=2872] And you have to ask the question, and I have to ask the question of whoever it is that we're dealing with, what must a man do to be saved?
[time=2882] And we go back to John 14, 6, "I," he says, "I am the way, the truth and the life." Nobody comes to the Father but through me.
[time=2894] By grace through faith, not as a result of works that no one should what, boast.
[time=2902] So I don't know where you are, but I'd sure like to know, we would sure like to help, we would love to be an encouragement to you.
[time=2908] Again, afterwards, you just make your way on down here, and we can talk about these things.
[time=2914] We can wrestle with these issues. We can try our best to get to know you and answer some of those questions.
[time=2918] A second thing for others of you to take home, and let me just say it to you this way.
[time=2924] Just because I've got the diplomas on the wall of my office doesn't make me your mouthpiece.
[time=2936] Let's say that to you this way. I don't mind being your pastor, and I love the chance that we have to be together.
[time=2944] I love that, and I'm so thankful for that.
[time=2946] And you can bring your friends, bring your family, bring anybody you want to bring, and you know we love being together in this setting.
[time=2952] But I'm not the only one in this place, nor are those who stood with me on this stage this morning,
[time=2958] the only ones who have the freedom and the opportunity to open our mouths as Peter did and articulate the truth.
[time=2964] And more importantly, sometimes than articulating it, live it out.
[time=2970] So please be reminded today how very important it is that like Peter and John,
[time=2978] you're willing to stand in the midst of wherever it is that God has placed you, and to know and understand and be able to articulate and live out the truth of God's Word in genuine, personal,
[time=2992] loving, compassionate ways.
[time=2996] And we'll always do our best. Me or whoever it is that stands here, we will always do our best to represent truth as we open our mouth in this setting, but people.
[time=3004] We got to open our mouths and our lives together, filled with confidence in us know, filled with the Holy Spirit.
[time=3014] And that's what makes it different. That's what makes it unique. That's what brought thousands.
[time=3018] We're up to five so far at chapter four, and this thing's just gaining steam,
[time=3024] simple people with an amazing cause, willing to open their mouths and live their lives
[time=3030] in the power of the Holy Spirit.
[time=3034] I love that verse. Where was it?
[time=3040] Back in, there it is, verse 13, we'll close with this.
[time=3044] Will you go back there with me? Maybe you already put your book away.
[time=3048] Acts 4, verse 13, I just love it.
[time=3052] You know why I love this verse so much? It reminds me of my kids.
[time=3054] It reminds me of the childlike faith of a little one.
[time=3062] And if you've ever bumped into the childlike faith of a little one, you know exactly what I mean.
[time=3066] Now as they observed the confidence of Peter and John and understood that they were what?
[time=3072] Uneducated and untrained men.
[time=3076] They were marveling and began to recognize them as having been with who?
[time=3082] Jesus. Like a child, people.
[time=3088] Not polished or necessarily profound.
[time=3092] Just from the what?
[time=3094] From the what? Just from the heart.
[time=3098] A heart changed by you and all your effort?
[time=3100] No. A heart changed by who? The Lord.
[time=3106] Amen? Amen.
[time=3108] And we've got a song that we're going to close with.
[time=3112] And I'm going to ask you to pray with me as the folks come up and as we sing.
[time=3116] Lord, I just stand before you here this morning.
[time=3122] And I am so very appreciative of the fact that we can as a family come into this setting.
[time=3128] And we can be reminded of the truth.
[time=3132] The truth God that changed a nation.
[time=3136] A truth that when embraced and lived out began to affect life after life after life.
[time=3144] And God even the most elite, even the most educated, even the most highly trained of that day.
[time=3150] When they came face to face with a heart that was impassioned.
[time=3156] And with a soul that had been made new.
[time=3160] God, nothing. Nothing could compare.
[time=3164] They're bold over. They're set back on their heels.
[time=3168] Not by the bravery and not by the words and not by anything else other than simply by the hearts of these early believers who put their faith in you.
[time=3180] And we're willing to walk obediently in the midst of trial and persecution in life.
[time=3184] And so God, we this morning want to stand as a family.
[time=3188] We want to stand as a people.
[time=3190] And we want to thank you for what you have done in us.
[time=3194] Because what you have done allows us to face life, world, religion, everything.
[time=3198] God with a strength and confidence.
[time=3200] And so here are praises this morning in your son's name we pray.
[time=3204] Amen. Would you please stand?
[time=3212] [MUSIC - 214 seconds]
[time=3432] ♪
[time=3438] [AMEN - 2 seconds] Would you pray with me?
[time=3442] Hold hands.
[time=3444] Grab a hand next to you as we pray.
[time=3446] Anybodies will do.
[time=3448] And as we hold hands together, let's offer up this prayer.
[time=3450] As we leave Father, we come before you this morning, having realized once again that the poor
[time=3460] and the weak and the blind are made whole, not because of anything we can do or any rules we can follow
[time=3470] or any program that we might can fit into.
[time=3474] But God, the poor and the weak and the blind are made whole because of you and because of faith, because of the work of your son and because of the work of your spirit.
[time=3484] So please, God, grant us the strength and courage to live in that way with those truths having been embraced.
[time=3494] God, we love you.
[time=3494] We thank you for that which we have because of you.
[time=3498] And all the people agreed and said amen.
