[time=261] He is the Lord and he reigns on high.
[time=267] He is the Lord.
[time=270] Spoken to the darkness created the light.
[time=275] He is the Lord of mine.
[time=278] Through his eyes that you can never end in your days.
[time=283] He is the Lord.
[time=286] And he comes to power when he calls his name.
[time=291] He is the Lord of mine.

[time=298] O Lord of God.

[time=323] You are the Lord.
[time=326] It's the power of God for our salvation.
[time=331] You are the Lord.

[time=609] (applause) You know the next song we're going to sing, Denise is going to lead us here in a few moments, but I just want to read a few of the words. Lord, I believe in you. I'll always believe in you. Though I can't see you with my eyes, deep in my heart, your presence I find. It reminded me this morning when I read that of what Paul says in the first chapter of Romans, verse 20.
[time=640] For since the creation of the world, his invisible attributes, his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made so that they are without excuse. It's us. That's this church that we're learning about in the book of Acts.
[time=661] Remember, he's gone already, and yet thousands are coming to him because of the testimony of those around them, the disciples. They've not seen him. It's a story now. So 2,000 years plus, we're just like them. So this morning, Lord, I believe in you, although I'll always believe in you. Though I can't see you with my eyes, deep in my heart, your presence I find.
[time=689] [MUSIC]
[time=703] Though I can't see you're holy, holy face, or you're thrown in heaven above.
[time=717] It seems so far away.
[time=725] And though I can't touch, I can't touch your nails, guard hands.
[time=734] I have a deep unspeakable joy that makes my faith to stand.
[time=744] Lord, I believe in you, although I can't see you with my eyes, deep in my heart, your presence I find.
[time=766] Lord, I believe in you, and I'll keep my trust in you. Let the whole world say what they make.
[time=782] No one can take this joy away, Lord, I believe.
[time=795] Boy from above, you are God's only chosen one. You're the one and only true way, way to my Father's heart.
[time=817] Die for all sin, when you rose and I'll live again.
[time=826] A great death and a great soul that I might take.
[time=834] Lord, I believe in you, Lord, I believe in you.
[time=840] I'll always believe in you, though I can't see you with my eyes, deep in my heart, your presence I find.
[time=856] Lord, I believe in you, and I'll keep my trust in you.
[time=866] Let the whole world say what they make. No one can take this joy away, Lord, I believe.
[time=882] Lord, I believe, I believe, Lord, I believe in you, I'll always believe in you, though I can't see you with my eyes, deep in my heart, your presence I find.
[time=911] Lord, I believe in you, and I'll be my trust in you.
[time=921] Let the whole world say what they make. No one can take this joy away, Lord, I believe.
[time=936] I believe, Lord, I believe, Lord, I believe, Lord, I believe, Lord, I believe.
[time=966] Lord, I believe, Lord, I believe, Lord, I believe.
[time=994] You are my strength when I am being. You are the treasure that I seek. You are my all in all.
[time=1007] See me as a precious jewel, but with one might be a fool. You are my all in all.
[time=1020] Jesus, when the love of me is your name. Jesus, when the love of me is your name.
[time=1060] When I call down in you, be out. Jesus, when the love of me is your name.
[time=1085] Jesus, when the love of me is your name. Jesus, when the love of me is your name.
[time=1194] Jesus, when the love of me is your name.
[time=1214] Well, hey, open up if you would to Acts, Acts chapter four.
[time=1219] And last week, if you'll think back to the first portion, the first part of Acts chapter four, we saw enraged religious leaders. Remember those guys? The Sanhedrin. We saw these enraged
[time=1232] religious leaders responding to the gospel as it was preached and taught and proclaimed by Peter and John. They throw Peter and John into prison for an overnight stay. And while the Jewish elite gathered to deliver a verbal beating to the two apostles the following
[time=1248] day, what we didn't mention to you last week was that the verbal beating came on the heels of what was most certainly a physical one. That's right, a physical beating. A physical
[time=1260] beating that was commonplace upon entrance to any short or long term imprisonment during
[time=1266] that time. In those days, serving time was sometimes easier than starting your time.
[time=1273] So now for us, the picture gets even clearer. Physical, social, and mental abuse now begin
[time=1281] to permeate everyday church life. The threat is there. The reality is there. At any given
[time=1287] moment, you could lose your husband or wife. At any given moment, a son, a daughter, a friend could disappear. Persecution was now beginning to seep into everyday life of the
[time=1298] church. And so as I thought about that this week, you've got to realize it causes me to step back. And as I think about our times together here and as I think about this book and our attempt to teach it in my hope that it would somehow find a place of application in your life and mind, it's a little confusing. I began to sit there and think this week,
[time=1317] how in the world can we make this kind of reality live in our hearts and lives today?
[time=1322] Where is the application? We have no idea. I have no idea. You have no idea what it's
[time=1330] like to have physical, social, and mental abuse permeating everyday living. So I asked for
[time=1337] some help. And I felt as if he led me down this road. And the way I wrote it down was
[time=1343] this, though we face different circumstances. Though we face different circumstances, today
[time=1350] here in Northeast Fort Wayne, again, I realize there are churches today in this world and I hope you realize it as well. There are believers today gathering in fear, but we don't.
[time=1362] Different circumstances, same principles. With regard to the response to that which was
[time=1371] experienced, with regard to that which was coming in upon them, I realize different circumstances,
[time=1378] same principles, vastly different situations, exact same response required. Nobody is going
[time=1386] to get beaten today because you came to worship here at Black Hawk. No one's going to be in prison this week because of your relationship with Christ. But what are the trials? I started
[time=1398] to ask myself that this week. What are the trials we do face as a church? These people were beginning to encounter trials that would stretch them beyond belief and cause them
[time=1409] to come face to face with things that would grow them in their faith. What are the trials that we face as a church? And what are the individual trials? Those of us who make up
[time=1420] the church are facing. And another question comes to mind. Can we learn? Ty mentioned
[time=1427] this earlier, and I would agree with this conclusion. Can we learn from those here in Acts 4 how to respond? How to respond in ways that honor God and maintain that deep sense of purpose and mission in our local body? I believe there's a great deal to learn. I believe there's a great deal to take in. I believe there's a great deal for you and I to be reminded of this morning as we look at what goes on here in Acts 4 as these people respond to trial. But first, what are the trials? What are the trials? Let's get practical
[time=1458] here. Let's get down right to where we live, right to our own experience, right here at Blackock. What are the trials that this church encounters? Think about it now. What are some
[time=1471] of the difficult, challenging, faith-stretching situations that this local body encounters?
[time=1479] I wrote a few things down. Some that came to my mind. Division is always there, always,
[time=1488] always ready. The enemy is always ready to do all that he can to help division, critical
[time=1494] spirits kind of rear their ugly head in the life of a church. Division, critical spirits
[time=1501] willing to separate and divide in order to see personal agendas fulfilled. Write a few
[time=1507] of these down. Apathy. Apathy comes to mind. Remember a couple of weeks ago we all stood
[time=1514] as the congregation and did this. Remember that? Give me. Give me, give me, give me, give me. This is about me. I want, I need, give me. And when it comes to giving, when
[time=1525] it comes to offering, when it comes to rolling up, serving sleeves and making a contribution
[time=1531] and in making a contribution, making a difference for the kingdom when it comes to toil and hard work and sacrifice too many times, the attitude can be, who cares? Just make sure
[time=1543] I get. Division, apathy, financial struggles, financial shortfalls can represent trial for
[time=1552] a local family. Tension, just thinking about this, tension in the surrounding community
[time=1558] due to teaching or doctrinal posture on certain social issues. Complacency, kind of a cousin
[time=1566] to apathy as well. I wrote that down. Complacency. Selfish, kind of self-serving. I heard someone
[time=1575] say recently with their schedule in hand that they just didn't have time to get involved.
[time=1582] And you maybe hear that at times. It's prevalent. It's sad and it's tragic that it's prevalent,
[time=1590] but it's prevalent. People actually believing in people functioning under the opinion that
[time=1596] somehow that's optional. People in the body of Christ somehow thinking that getting involved
[time=1603] and exercising gifts and with passion doing all that they could do to help a place achieve
[time=1609] its mission, somehow thinking it's optional. That if they can fit it in, so be it. And
[time=1617] if not, no big deal. Complacency, division, financial struggles, tension in the community.
[time=1626] Trials that a church faces. How about personal trials? How about we move from the corporate things that we might face as the family, just to the very real things? Very everyday things that you face and come in contact with. I wrote down a few. Family turmoil, marital infidelity,
[time=1642] who to marry, who to date, grown kids not following Christ, small kids not following us, addictions,
[time=1652] booze, internet pills, pornography, depression, overeating, under eating, business failures,
[time=1658] job dissatisfaction, friends and relationships in crisis. Ministry dissatisfaction, future
[time=1665] vocational uncertainty, gossip, infertility, loss of job, enormous and impossible debt,
[time=1674] where to eat Thanksgiving dinner, where to go for Christmas, when to get divorced, when
[time=1685] to get separated, how long to stay separated, how many times to forgive. And the list goes
[time=1694] on and on and on. Did I miss anybody here in the room today? Probably not. Life's full
[time=1703] of it, isn't it? And what most of us do, what so many of us do, so oftentimes in the
[time=1709] face of all the above is allow personal, spiritual paralysis to set in. Because it's so confusing
[time=1719] and it's so hurtful and we stop then living. And not only do we stop living, sometimes we stop hoping. And sometimes we even stop obeying. Because the personal trial that
[time=1731] we're encountering, the situation that we find ourselves in, we tell ourselves and we tell our friends and we moan from the depths of our souls, it's all too much. It's too overwhelming, it's too painful, it's too hard. And so we bail. We jump ship on the day to
[time=1747] day of life, we stop taking steps of faith and instead retreat in fear. Because truth
[time=1754] be told, I really can't do all things through Christ who strengthens me. Only some. And this
[time=1764] one, whatever it might be for you, or whatever it might be for me, this one's too much. A
[time=1771] mindset that shows up all too often in my own life and maybe even in yours, a mindset that does not match up though with what God's word teaches in 1 Corinthians 10. Open up there, just briefly if you would before we jump into Acts back to 1 Corinthians 10, our forward to 1 Corinthians 10. Because that mindset and that thought pattern, that road
[time=1793] that we sometimes walk down into spare. And again, don't hear me wrong, not that it's
[time=1799] not a difficult road and not that it isn't a painful experience and not that it can't be at times extremely confusing as you and I bump into all the above mentioned trials.
[time=1808] But it says there in 1 Corinthians 10, 13, one of my favorite verses of all. No temptation, that word temptation, really better translated in the Greek trial. No trial it says there
[time=1820] has overtaken you but such as is common to man. So many times people as you face your
[time=1827] trial and as I face mine, we try so often I think in our humanness to somehow make
[time=1833] our trial out to be what? Uncommon. Somehow different than that which everyone else faces
[time=1841] but God's word calls us back to reality. But such as is common to man and God is faithful
[time=1848] who will not allow you to be tempted or tried beyond what you are able but with the temptation
[time=1855] or the trial will provide a few ways? What's your Bible say? The way will provide the way of escape
[time=1865] that you may be able to endure it. And so it's safe to say we all face them, we all encounter them.
[time=1876] And if you or I can identify with any of the above mentioned, we can move into this passage back in Acts 4, ready, wanting, willing to be convicted, ready, wanting, willing to be taught
[time=1887] or reminded of how it is we can face the trials of life and keep getting up day after day. These
[time=1894] are our trials in the face of their trials. The church did three things. You ready for this?
[time=1901] It's a great look. Acts chapter 4, we're going to pick it up in verse 23. The church did three
[time=1908] things as they responded to trial. Make sure you get these down. First of all, number one, write it down. They huddled together. In the face of trial, they huddled together. Look at 23,
[time=1921] and when they had been released, referring to Peter and John, when they had been released, they went to their own companions. There's a lot right there in that phrase. They went to their
[time=1933] own companions and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them. Stop
[time=1939] right there. It's important, I think, to note that the first thing Peter and John did upon being released is take their bruised bodies and spiritually stretched spirits to their own
[time=1951] companions, the text says. They needed to be surrounded by their own small group.
[time=1960] People who cared, people who would listen and provide wise, strong, sensitive, and encouraging
[time=1967] support. Where do you go when it hits? When it gets real confusing, when it gets extremely
[time=1973] painful, when you're not quite sure what to think or what to do, where do you go?
[time=1978] Who listens to you? Who tells you when you're wrong? Who tells you when you're out of line?
[time=1988] Who speaks comfort or confrontation into your heart? Where do you go?
[time=1994] When we come up against it, we need to be able to come together.
[time=1999] I'll tell you a little something about me this morning, which I don't mind doing.
[time=2003] I feel like you share your lives with me constantly as we walk through life together
[time=2009] around this place, and so I don't mind sharing with you about me. You know that list? That list of personal trials, rather lengthy one I just rattled off a couple minutes ago. Guess where I came up with that? That's my own list. By and large, that's my own list with a few bullets of yours
[time=2032] thrown in. And it's the list I compile as I live my life and as I live my life with you and as we
[time=2038] live our lives together every week, every day. You and I come up against the tragic heartbreaking, tempting and confusing realities of life. And when trial hits, when the faith stretching challenges
[time=2050] come down the pipe, guess where I go? My companions. Absolutely. That smaller pocket of believing
[time=2059] friends who listen and don't fix, allow my fears and tears and frustrations to flow freely and treat
[time=2065] me like a friend and not a leader. From my wife to the guys I meet with Tuesdays for lunch to
[time=2072] our own small group that's starting on Monday nights, huddling up is saving my life. And that
[time=2081] is not an overstatement and that is not an exaggeration. Huddling together, living life together,
[time=2087] honestly facing life with those that are willing to love and speak truth, confrontational or comfort
[time=2093] related is changing my life. And it's saving my life because it's growing my heart. Please catch
[time=2100] that this morning. Please understand that dynamic. Living life in community, living life huddled
[time=2106] when necessary with those who you need to be with grows your heart. It grows your heart and that's
[time=2113] the point here. Don't miss this. Trial, trial not handled well has the capacity to destroy your heart.
[time=2124] Trial not handled well has the capacity and it will ruin your heart. It'll shrink it. It'll kill
[time=2131] it. You and I need each other. We need life-giving companionship. Flip back to the Old Testament.
[time=2140] Would you just for a moment to Ecclesiastes? It's a great couple verses there that speak to this very
[time=2146] truth. Ecclesiastes chapter 4. Just before you get to, I think of what is that, Son of Solomon?
[time=2158] Yeah. Just before you get to Son of Solomon. Just after Proverbs. Ecclesiastes chapter 4.
[time=2170] Look at what it says in verse 9. Even back here in the Old Testament, the value and the benefit
[time=2177] of community offered in clear, unmistakable terms. It says in verse 9, 2 are better than what?
[time=2183] 1. 2 are better than 1 because they have a good return for their labor. For if either of them
[time=2190] falls, the one will lift up his companion. There's that word. But woe to the one who falls when there
[time=2196] is not another to lift him up. Furthermore, if two lie down together, they keep warm, but how can one be warm alone? And if one can overpower him who was alone, two can resist him.
[time=2208] A chord of three strands. A chord of three strands is not quickly torn apart.
[time=2220] Do you have that? Come on now, be honest. Do you have that? If you don't, please ask for it.
[time=2228] If you don't, please pursue it. If you don't, please don't even attempt what is a futile and
[time=2235] foolish attempt to somehow think you can live life without it. They huddled together.
[time=2240] In the face of trial, they huddled and then what? Second thing we see back to,
[time=2246] go ahead and flip back to Acts, chapter 4. Second thing we see in verse 24, right at the beginning
[time=2252] of this verse, says there when they heard this, okay? They've huddled together, companions with
[time=2258] each other. They hear all that's been reported. And when they heard this verse 24, they lifted their voices to God with one accord and said, oh Lord, it is thou who didst make that heaven and the earth
[time=2270] and the sea and all that is in them. Stop right there. Second thing we see him doing is exercising hope. In other words, they prayed. Write it down. They prayed. They exercised hope. I believe the
[time=2282] two phrases again, always synonymous. Every time we pray, we exercise hope. Hope that he hears,
[time=2288] hope that he cares, hope that he considers and hope that in his perfect time he'll what?
[time=2293] Answer. They exercised hope. And there's a couple of things about their prayer, I think, worth noting.
[time=2304] Having been with, first one is this, having been with their friends Peter and John and having taken in every detail of their report, they spontaneously, it's right there. And again, as you study the
[time=2317] text, even in the Greek, it becomes even more and more obvious. They spontaneously, in verse 24, began to pray. They spontaneously began to lift their voices and their hearts toward him.
[time=2329] Like applause, one commentator said, it was informal and impulsive. Nobody said, now would be a good
[time=2337] time to go before the Father. They just prayed. Do you ever do that? Sometimes I think that's a
[time=2344] little difficult or challenging or uncomfortable for some. Do you ever do that when driving down the road and a discussion in the car with kids goes to a certain place? And there's a teachable
[time=2355] moment or at least a chance to remind them of our trust and dependence in him. Do you ever just say, hey, let's pray. Here we go. And off you go. With a spouse or a friend in a conversation one night
[time=2367] as truths are being exchanged and issues related to that friendship or that relationship in its future.
[time=2375] When things become clear, when decisions become clear, when roads that need to walk, that we need
[time=2381] to walk down become clear. Are we ready to spontaneously lift our hearts and our questions
[time=2388] and our fears to him? One author said it this way. In our well-oiled machine-like churches, we often can find our spirituality in little boxes of time. There's worship time, sermon time,
[time=2400] prayer time. And in each box is a set of rules to follow. But the early believers had no boxes.
[time=2408] The early believers had no rules. They prayed and worshiped when the Spirit moved, no matter where, no matter when. The second thing you've got to see about this prayer is that the prayer recognized
[time=2421] and claimed God's sovereignty. Write that down. The prayer recognized and claimed God's sovereignty.
[time=2429] They called out to their Lord, acknowledging that he had watched these three things, that he had made
[time=2435] everything. He controls everything and he has a purpose for everything. You see that in verses 24
[time=2443] through 28. Let's read that together. It says right here, verse 24, they heard this. They lifted their voices to God with one accord and said, "Oh Lord, here's where it talks about him making
[time=2454] everything. Oh Lord, it is thou who ditched make the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is
[time=2460] in them." Now it goes on to talk about his control. "Who by the Holy Spirit through the mouth of our
[time=2467] Father David thy servant did say, why did the Gentiles rage? And the people's devised feudal
[time=2474] things. The kings of the earth took their stand and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ. For truly in this city there were gathered together against thy
[time=2486] holy servant Jesus whom thou did anoint both Herod and Pontius Pilate along with the Gentiles
[time=2492] and the peoples of Israel." And then look at verse 28, his purpose for everything, to do, to do what?
[time=2499] To do whatever thy hand and thy purpose predestined to occur. Don't forget that people.
[time=2511] There's no such thing as chance. There's only God's pre-ordained, sovereign, wise, perfect plan
[time=2521] by recognizing that God had created the world and every one in it and everything in it including
[time=2530] their antagonists, these people, these believers here in Acts 4 were turning all their concerns over to him whether their enemies were the Gentiles, the kings of the earth, Herod, Pontius, Pilate, or the Sanhedrin. God was in control and everything would be accomplished according to his purpose.
[time=2547] You know what let's do? Let's just take a minute, maybe a couple.
[time=2554] I just a few minutes ago read through a whole list of trials, both personal and corporate,
[time=2565] things that our church is facing, things that you are having to deal with and wrestle with in your
[time=2571] own life. And this morning right here we have an opportunity, having seen and having viewed and
[time=2580] having watched these dear people, these simple folks filled with the Holy Spirit, willing to be involved in God's mind, having watched them and listened to them pray. Let me invite you to do
[time=2591] the same right where you are. We'll just take a couple of minutes and let me ask you to do this.
[time=2597] I wrote a few things out and I'm going to ask you this morning if you wouldn't mind with me just bowing your head. Would you do that? Just bow your head. I don't know what it is you're encountering.
[time=2609] I don't know what it is you're facing. I don't know the depth of your joy and or your sorrow as we
[time=2615] come to sit together this morning. But my guess is there's something or someone in your life that
[time=2622] would lead you to pray this prayer. And I'll just ask you to kind of just quietly, silently in the
[time=2629] calmness of your own heart, just kind of follow along with me this morning. And would you be willing
[time=2635] to pray this to him? Lord, I do not know what you are doing. At times it makes no sense to me.
[time=2646] I'm confused, uncertain, and scared. But, but you are a good and loving God. I believe that.
[time=2658] A good and loving God who redeemed me and promised to hold me up.
[time=2665] And I restate and I reaffirm to you right now, right here, that I am willing to live
[time=2675] under your wise, good, and perfect plan. I believe you will grow me and bring me through pain and
[time=2686] confusion. And I believe I'll be deepened in my love for and trust in you. I know it.
[time=2701] God, feel no need to explain. Do what needs to be done for your sake in mind.
[time=2708] In your son's name, we pray. Amen.
[time=2714] They pray. They pray spontaneously out of their sensitivity to the Spirit. They acknowledge God's
[time=2726] absolute rule and oversight in their lives, reaffirming their trust, and then thirdly, look what they did. Thirdly, they ask for increased confidence.
[time=2734] Look at verse 29. And now, Lord, take note of their threats and grant that by, this is very
[time=2743] important. Watch this. Grant that thy bond servants may speak thy word with all confidence.
[time=2750] They ask for confidence. They pray and make a request of God to do the very thing they've been
[time=2758] threatened with and told not to do. They got a life-threatening trial,
[time=2765] staring them in the face, and they don't want removal from it. They don't want relief from it.
[time=2770] All they want is confidence to keep going, to keep doing, to keep being the people that
[time=2777] God had called them to be. And the very thing they asked for is the very thing they were told not to do. They were told to be quiet. Then they say, "Oh, God, give us confidence because we've got
[time=2788] to speak." They just wanted to keep going. They huddled. They huddled together. They
[time=2797] hoped. And then it gets really interesting, really convicting. These next several verses are powerful,
[time=2804] deep, huge verses that communicate amazing truth. Do we see them having huddled and having been
[time=2811] encouraged and having lifted up prayers to the Father? Do they sit back now and wait for the rescue
[time=2817] from their plight? Here their leaders, Peter and John, have been roughed up. They've been threatened and told to be quiet. And what do they do? They boldly speak. They boldly speak and then live out
[time=2828] their faith in reckless, incredible ways. Look at verse 31. And when they had prayed the place where
[time=2837] they had gathered together was shaken and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak the Word of God with boldness, the very thing that they had prayed for. And then, and then it gets interesting. They begin to give, not just monetarily but personally,
[time=2855] relationally and financially and spiritually. And in every way imaginable, they begin to give.
[time=2865] They helped. That's right, they helped. They went out of their way to help. They took the phrases
[time=2873] loving one another and living by faith to a completely different level. The third thing we see them
[time=2879] doing is helping. Look at verse 32. And the congregation of those who believed were of one
[time=2885] heart and soul and not one of them claimed that anything belonging to him was his own, but all things were common property to them. And with great power, the apostles were giving witness
[time=2896] to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and abundant grace was upon them all, for there was not a needy
[time=2903] person among them. How large had the church grown to at this point? Tell me.
[time=2913] How many? Five thousand. And there was not a what? Not a needy person among them.
[time=2924] For all who were owners of land or houses would sell them and bring the proceeds of the sales
[time=2930] and lay them at the apostles' feet and they would be distributed to each as any had need.
[time=2936] Wow. Look at this people. Look what persecution brings. Look what trial handled well brings.
[time=2947] Trial has the capacity to draw a family together. You've seen that. Have you experienced that, you've experienced that in a church, you've experienced that on the job. You've experienced that on an athletic team in high school or college. You know the trial and the facing of it with hope
[time=2962] and perseverance has the capacity to bring people together. Threats, difficult times,
[time=2968] limb walking experiences tend to deepen and solidify resolve and relationships.
[time=2974] The sense of us, the sense of us begins to overshadow the sense of me. My wants, my wants,
[time=2987] pale. My wants begin to pale in comparison to your needs. Getting there, getting there isn't
[time=2997] the goal anymore. Getting there together is the goal. These people faced enormous trial and in
[time=3006] the face of that they huddled and they hoped and they helped and it pains for you and I an amazing picture. That's how they responded. That's what their response looked like, okay?
[time=3022] And I just want you to ask yourself one more question this morning and I mean it. I want you
[time=3028] to ask yourself why? Why? What was it that was going on? What was it that existed in the heart and
[time=3037] soul of these people? What was it about them that allowed this to be the picture of their response
[time=3044] to trial? What's inside the heart and soul of one who lives with that kind of power and that kind
[time=3051] of faith? Well I want to show you right from the text here, three things, four things, excuse me.
[time=3057] And it's not just from this text, it's from the text of these first four chapters and every once
[time=3064] in a while in our study as we continue on through this book we're going to do this very thing. We're just going to stop and say wait a minute, time out. What is it about these people? What is it about their faith? What is it about their willingness that we can learn from that we can be reminded from? And there's four things I want to show you this morning that make this kind of response to trial possible. Number one, write it down. They had a mission. They didn't just have it, all right?
[time=3088] They owned. Write it down. They embraced. They lived their mission. And what was their mission?
[time=3097] We hear that phrase often today tossed around in corporate and church settings, mission, mission,
[time=3103] mission. Well sometimes it can just be a bunch of nice words on a plaque or sometimes it can be
[time=3111] life-changing, life-gripping. There's was the latter. What was their mission? Go back to Acts
[time=3118] or just in your minds or if you want to go back to Acts 1 verse 8. Acts 1 verse 8, he said to them,
[time=3124] "You shall be my what? You shall be my witnesses." He gave him back in the first chapter as Luke
[time=3133] looked back on that discussion. He had given them their marching orders. He said, "You shall be my witnesses. You will be. You'll do it." And even before Acts, back at the end of his stay on
[time=3147] earth, Matthew 28 records the Great Commission where he told the same group of apostles, "Go.
[time=3155] Go therefore into all the earth. Go into all the world making disciples, baptizing them and
[time=3162] teaching them all that I have commanded you." These people, these people heard that. These people
[time=3168] listened to that. These people took that in and it was why they lived. It was why they got up.
[time=3173] They gave themselves to it. It's the mission of all missions. I like to say it this way. It's an
[time=3181] alarm setting, physically exhausting, faith stretching, endurance demanding, eternity altering,
[time=3187] high stakes transcendent mission and they owned it. Do we? Do we really? Do we really think about it?
[time=3196] Do we really live it? Do we really give ourselves to it? Do we really sacrifice for it?
[time=3200] Does it really grip and shape and form our hearts and lives? Or is it a nice saying on the front of a
[time=3207] bulletin helping seekers find and follow Christ? They own their mission. You know what else they
[time=3214] had? Secondly, compassion. Write it down. They had compassion. They had compassion for those
[time=3220] living without a mission. Missionless, empty, hurting people, living far from God,
[time=3226] separated by the valley of sin broke their hearts. These people in this early church
[time=3233] again and again were moved by compassion. Their hearts broke for those who were far from God.
[time=3243] They had mission. They had compassion. Thirdly, they possessed sincerity.
[time=3247] Thirdly, they possessed sincerity.
[time=3250] There was a sincereness between them. There was a way in which they conducted themselves. There
[time=3259] was a way in which they communicated. There was a way in which they lived and those last several verses there that we read give us just a glimpse of that. But there was a sincerity with each other.
[time=3272] And I got a call Sunday on my, on my cell phone. There was a voicemail beeping when I got in the
[time=3278] truck. And I was driving home by myself and I popped into the code and up on the voicemail,
[time=3284] came a friend, a real good friend. And I think he was driving home. We were leaving kind of church
[time=3290] together. He'd got a little bit of a head start and he was leaving me a message and the message said something like this. He says, "I just want you to know. I absolutely loved this morning.
[time=3300] I loved the worship. I loved the message. It was okay." He said, "I love the people." And there's kind of this pause. And he says, "You know what? I just
[time=3310] want you to know I love this church." And there's another pause. And he says, "Well, while I'm at it, I want you to know I love you." And he got kind of quiet and he hung up and that was that.
[time=3320] And that meant so much to me. Like it means to you when somebody from this family comes alongside
[time=3327] and says, "Hey, great job. Well done. Boy, I appreciate you. I love you. I pray for you often.
[time=3335] I'm sorry you're going through it. Oh, I'm excited things are so good. When you function with me and
[time=3341] I with you and when we function together with a sense of sincerity in our hearts, amazing things happen to us and to those that we impact. Lastly,
[time=3354] they possessed all three of those things. But you know what? They possessed all three of those things because they had a willingness in their heart to do something. That all three of those
[time=3364] three things, mission, compassion, sincerity, all three of those things, the exercising of those
[time=3371] three things require this one last thing. And simply stated, they possessed love. They possessed
[time=3378] love. I think we got a quote I want to read you this morning. Found it this week from C.S. Lewis
[time=3385] and the quote goes like this. See if you can't relate to this. To love at all is to be vulnerable.
[time=3392] Love anything and your heart will certainly be rung and possibly be broken. If you want to make
[time=3400] sure of keeping it intact, you must give your heart to no one, not even to an animal. Wrap it
[time=3406] carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries. Avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the
[time=3413] casket or coffin of your selfishness. But know that in that casket, safe, dark, motionless,
[time=3421] airless, it will change. It will not be broken. It will become unbreakable. Your heart.
[time=3429] It will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. The only place outside heaven
[time=3436] where you can be perfectly safe from all the dangers and fears of love.
[time=3441] Let that one sink in for a second. The only place where you're safe or I'm safe from the dangers
[time=3453] and fears of love is hell. These people, and you, you know and I know that to love radically,
[time=3463] to give ourselves recklessly to our God and to each other. You've all seen the flip side of love
[time=3472] too many times. We've all seen it not work. We've all seen trust broken. We've all seen unfaithfulness. We've all seen the deceit. And so we've become fearful and we hold back.
[time=3484] God's Word and these people call us this morning to a kind of love that trusts,
[time=3491] that keeps moving forward. They had mission, they had compassion, they had sincerity, and they had
[time=3498] love. For a cassette copy of today's message, please call and request the
