[time=548] And as you are about to pray, literally thought or said to yourself, boy, I hope I sound good.
[time=560] I mean, I hope I really sound good as I do what I'm about to do.
[time=566] I wonder if they'll think I'm profound.
[time=570] I wonder if they'll be impressed by the use of certain words.
[time=575] I wonder how I'll sound.
[time=578] Have you ever been in a conversation with someone or a group of people and felt this intense desire to say something or share some profound truth or ask a penetrating thought-provoking question so as to appear significant, bright or deep?
[time=594] Have you ever felt that urge?
[time=597] Have you ever sensed that temptation?
[time=599] Have you as a couple ever argued all the way to church or some friend's house or a class activity yet gotten out of the car and walked in the door?
[time=609] Smiling.
[time=613] Have you ever volunteered to serve in some ministry position because of who it would please?
[time=619] The thanks that would most certainly come your way are the stepping stone that that specific opportunity was to bigger and better things in ministry.
[time=628] Greater levels of recognition that would most certainly come your way.
[time=632] Have you ever shared personal information about yourself with others, a hard decision that you made?
[time=643] Maybe some personal victory over sin.
[time=646] The meeting of an influential person, a sacrificial gift that might have been given.
[time=653] Information about yourself shared with others that should have remained between you and God but in your desire to be viewed a certain way you let it sort of slip out.
[time=665] Have you fabricated or exaggerated stories in an effort to accentuate your own spiritual effectiveness or worth?
[time=673] Have you ever gone to great lengths?
[time=675] This is the question of the morning.
[time=677] Have you ever gone to great lengths in an effort to appear godly and truly devoted?
[time=686] I have.
[time=689] I have done in my almost twenty years of learning how to walk with the Lord all of the above.
[time=696] All of them, every single one of them just mentioned.
[time=698] How about you?
[time=700] Ever felt those things, ever sensed those things, ever given into those temptations, ever wanted so desperately?
[time=706] To be viewed a certain way, to be seen in a certain light that you fabricated, exaggerated, carried yourself in some way that really wasn't you.
[time=717] And do you think it's serious?
[time=720] It's a question for you this morning.
[time=722] Do you think if you've ever engaged in that, if you've ever been part of that, if you've ever felt that, do you think it's a serious thing?
[time=729] And the eyes and heart of God, how do you think he views this kind of self-promoting hypocrisy, this spiritual pretense, this pretending to do and be things that maybe at that moment you're not?
[time=743] Well, I'll tell you this.
[time=744] In our study this morning of Acts chapter five, two things will become crystal clear to you and I.
[time=750] Number one, you'll see how he feels about it.
[time=753] You will see in clear and in no uncertain terms how God feels about, how God views spiritual pretense.
[time=761] And secondly, you will be very, very thankful, as am I, that he deals with it differently today than he did then.
[time=771] Now, in order to set ourselves up for our look at the text here in Acts five, we have to kind of go back to the end of Acts chapter four, where the actual flow of Acts five begins.
[time=782] This morning, we're going to see three and I want you to write these things down as we go.
[time=787] I think there's even room for you there on your note pages to do so.
[time=790] We're going to see three very clear and very important truths unfolding in the passage before us.
[time=797] The first two things that we'll see this morning, the first two truths, the first two principles stand in absolute contrast to each other.
[time=808] And they represent a choice that you have to make and a choice that I have to make every day of every week.
[time=816] The first two points in our talk this morning will represent two things that stand in absolute contrast that you and I have to choose with regard to every day of every week.
[time=829] The third thing we will see this morning is really showing us the consequence of choosing poorly when holding up the first two.
[time=840] Let's go back to chapter four, verse 32.
[time=843] Go with me back to the end of chapter four, verse 32, and what we'll see here, number one, first point this morning, authentic generosity.
[time=852] Authentic generosity is what we see here. Picture yourself in the midst of this, picture yourself seeing this, picture yourself in a church where these kinds of things are going on daily.
[time=863] Chapter four, verse 32 says this.
[time=867] And the congregation of those who believe were of one heart and soul and not one of them claimed that anything belonging to him was his own, but all things were common property to them.
[time=880] And with great power, the apostles were giving witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and abundant grace was upon them all.
[time=888] For there was not a needy person among them, not a needy person among them.
[time=895] The number at this point in our story had grown to what?
[time=899] Five thousand.
[time=901] And there was not a needy person among them.
[time=907] For all who were owners of land or houses would sell them and bring the proceeds of the sales and lay them the proceeds, all of them, it's implied.
[time=919] Lay them at the apostles' feet and they would be distributed to each as any had need.
[time=925] And Joseph, verse 36, you there?
[time=928] And Joseph, a Levite of Cyprian birth who was also called Barnabas by the apostles which translated means son of encouragement and who owned a tract of land sold it and brought the money.
[time=942] All of it is what's implied and laid it at the apostles' feet.
[time=949] Authentic generosity seemed to be the norm in that place during this time.
[time=955] Do you sense what was happening? It wasn't about gain, it wasn't about status or prestige, it wasn't about me, it was about us.
[time=963] It wasn't who you knew or what circles you ran in.
[time=966] You know why? Because there was only one circle. Wouldn't that be nice?
[time=972] Just one circle.
[time=975] You sold, you gave, you sacrificed, you came alongside and served because you loved God.
[time=984] And you loved others with your whole being, period.
[time=992] They were, it says, of one heart and one soul.
[time=996] They were, don't miss this, they were relationally and spiritually, all of them unified.
[time=1002] No fractures, no cracks, no division, no attitudes, no critical spirits, only harmony in and through the entire thing.
[time=1012] They were together. You get the impression.
[time=1015] As you read through these first four or five chapters of the book of Acts, you get the impression it was high stakes, daily living.
[time=1022] And nobody was out in the lobby of that church saying, "I don't like it when Peter teaches, he's not practical enough."
[time=1033] Or I wish John would lead worship if James keeps it up with that tambourine thing, "I'm leaving."
[time=1042] You didn't hear those things. Or last week, or last week, we were the tenth house visited and our communion bread was stale.
[time=1051] How about yours? Didn't hear it. Didn't sense it. Didn't see it. Didn't stumble upon it.
[time=1061] Because the entire church, all of them, young and old alike, were on a mission.
[time=1065] Every day may be being their last.
[time=1069] So with one heart and soul, they generously gave and loved.
[time=1074] Why? Why? So they could be seen? No. So the kingdom of God could advance.
[time=1080] So the gospel could continue to spread so the church could grow.
[time=1084] This was their mindset. Authentic generosity. Most of them.
[time=1090] This was the mindset of most of them.
[time=1094] As we move on to chapter five this morning, especially in these first four verses, we meet Ananias and Sapphira.
[time=1102] And we transition, as we do, from authentic generosity to a presumptuous hypocrisy.
[time=1109] To a presumptuous hypocrisy, and now things begin to get a little ugly.
[time=1113] For the very first time in this young, new church, look at verses one to four of Acts chapter five.
[time=1119] It says there, "But a certain man named Ananias, with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property
[time=1126] and kept back some of the price for himself, with his wife's full knowledge, and bringing a portion of it, he laid it at the apostles' feet."
[time=1137] But Peter said, "Ananias, why?
[time=1142] Why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back some of the price of the land?
[time=1148] While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own?
[time=1153] And after it was sold, was it not under your control?
[time=1157] Why? Why is it that you have conceived this deed in your heart?
[time=1161] You have not lied to men but to God." Stop right there.
[time=1167] The word "but," first word there, chapter five, verse one.
[time=1171] The word "but" is meant to introduce the sharp contrast between the actions of Joseph, otherwise known as Barnabas.
[time=1179] Don't forget him now. Back at the end of chapter four, you see the whole setup to what we see here in chapter five.
[time=1186] And that word "but" signifies the transition, the difference between the authentic and giving and submitted.
[time=1192] And Yield did Barnabas, who brings his entire sale price and lays it at the apostles' feet
[time=1202] in an effort to serve, in an effort to give, in an effort to come alongside.
[time=1207] And now in contrast, we see the wickedness and the deceit of Ananias and Sephira.
[time=1212] Like Barnabas, they too had sold a piece of property.
[time=1215] Yet unlike Barnabas, they kept back some of the money for themselves.
[time=1221] You see in their minds, this was a chance. This was a chance for them to do a little double dip.
[time=1226] It was for them as they saw it bonus time.
[time=1230] Absolutely bonus time. They would gain two things. They would gain spiritual prestige.
[time=1237] On the one hand, as the apostles and the leaders of the church would see them bringing this amount of money and laying at their feet,
[time=1244] they would be well thought of. They would be highly esteemed. They would be respected.
[time=1250] They would now be able to walk and talk in the elite circles.
[time=1254] And again, pride had so blinded them, they didn't even realize there was only one circle.
[time=1260] So they gained spiritual prestige, they thought, and then secondly, they gained a little cash on the side.
[time=1267] A little monetary profit for their pockets.
[time=1273] Now, question for you this morning. Think this through.
[time=1276] And it helps to think it through. It helps us kind of narrow in.
[time=1279] On what really went wrong here, okay?
[time=1282] Was withholding part of the money? Was withholding part of the money? Was that the sin?
[time=1290] No.
[time=1292] Withholding part of the money was not the sin. Nowhere, okay, and you can look back through here and you can see.
[time=1297] Nowhere.
[time=1299] Have they ever been commanded or told to sell their property?
[time=1302] Nowhere had they been commanded or told to give all the proceeds.
[time=1307] The overt sin, make sure you get this now, the overt sin, and there's an overt sin and there's an internal sin.
[time=1313] We're going to see two of them this morning. The overt sin was public pretense.
[time=1318] The overt sin was that they lied. Pretending to have given all of the proceeds was the sin.
[time=1325] The sin that God hated. The sin that stirred his heart.
[time=1329] Now the deeper, far more devastating sin was the self-promoting hypocrisy-driven desire for spiritual status.
[time=1339] Did you get that? The self-promoting hypocrisy-driven desire for spiritual status.
[time=1348] They wanted the approval and so do you and so do I sometimes.
[time=1354] They wanted the approval of who? Men are God. Men.
[time=1360] They wanted the approval of men. They wanted recognition among the elite.
[time=1366] And I want you to stop here for just a minute.
[time=1369] And I want us just to be reminded of something very important.
[time=1372] I want to allow the Word of God to teach us and remind us of some things.
[time=1375] Very, very, very important with regard to this topic.
[time=1379] Do you remember how righteously angered?
[time=1383] Do you remember how disturbed? Do you remember how bothered?
[time=1387] How deeply bothered our Lord was as he encountered the Pharisees during his time on earth.
[time=1393] Do you remember the Pharisees? The Pharisees, we saw them and we read about them and we've studied them in the Gospels.
[time=1399] You see them in Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. The religious leaders of that day.
[time=1404] Religious leaders in the Jewish system who were supposed to be caring for the hearts and spiritual needs of the people.
[time=1412] And instead, they weren't caring for the hearts and spiritual needs.
[time=1416] Instead, they were a group of individuals, a group of men who were deeply committed to pretense.
[time=1422] A group of men who led in such a way that they were deeply given to externals and to status.
[time=1428] The very sin of Ananias and Saphira that we studied this morning had been not only encountered but addressed by the Lord Himself.
[time=1436] And let's look at that. Turn back to Matthew, if you would.
[time=1440] Back in your New Testament to Matthew, the very first book in the New Testament, Matthew chapter 23.
[time=1446] How did our Lord feel about this as he saw it firsthand, as he encountered it in his own life and stay here on earth?
[time=1454] And don't be mistaken, it is the exact same sin that you and I commit often.
[time=1459] It is the exact same transgression that Ananias and Saphira had given themselves to here in Acts chapter 5.
[time=1466] And the Lord Himself has some things to say.
[time=1470] As you come to the 23rd chapter in Matthew, he has had enough.
[time=1474] He has seen, he has witnessed, he has bumped into these guys, he has seen them at work.
[time=1479] He has gained a clear perspective on how they operate and how they function and he has had enough.
[time=1486] And it says here in Matthew 23, we're going to pick it up at verse 25.
[time=1491] And there's a phrase you're going to see through this which says woe to you.
[time=1494] In the original language that would be translated, you be damned.
[time=1500] He is serious as he encounters these men who were supposed to be shepherds.
[time=1505] They were supposed to be leading lovingly and instead he says to them in verse 25, woe to you.
[time=1511] Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites.
[time=1515] For you clean the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside they are full of robbery and self-indulgent.
[time=1522] You self-indulgence, you blind Pharisee.
[time=1525] First clean the inside of the cup and of the dish so that the outside of it may become clean also.
[time=1534] Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you are like whitewashed tombs,
[time=1540] which on the outside appear beautiful, but inside they are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness.
[time=1548] Even so you too outwardly.
[time=1550] And again that's what they were committed to, that's how they lived their lives.
[time=1553] It was all about what happened outwardly.
[time=1556] And he says in verse 28, even so you too outwardly appear righteous to men, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy.
[time=1563] And lawlessness, woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you build the tombs of the prophets
[time=1571] and adorn the monuments of the righteous and say if we had been living in the days of our fathers,
[time=1577] we would not have been partners with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.
[time=1581] Consequently you bear witness against yourselves that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets.
[time=1588] Fill up then the measure of the guilt of your fathers.
[time=1591] Here you go. Now he's getting after him.
[time=1593] Verse 33, usurpents, you snakes.
[time=1597] Can you see him? Can you sense him? Look in these guys in the eye.
[time=1602] Men who had been keeping people from the very thing our Lord had come to offer.
[time=1607] And he looks him right in the eye and says you snake.
[time=1613] You serpents, you brood of vipers, how shall you escape the sentence of hell?
[time=1619] Now watch this little foretelling of what was to come.
[time=1623] Even with regard to our own book that we're studying here, the book of Acts, and those that we're reading about and studying about, watch what he says.
[time=1629] Therefore behold, I am sending you prophets and wise men and scribes.
[time=1634] Some of them you will kill and crucify and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city. And did they?
[time=1643] Did they? You bet they did.
[time=1646] You bet they did. And we're reading about it.
[time=1649] We're studying about that very thing here in the book of Acts from city to city that upon you may fall the guilt of all the righteous blood shed on earth.
[time=1659] From the blood of righteous able to the blood of Zechariah, the son of Barakiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
[time=1666] Truly, verse 36, truly I say to you, all these things shall come upon this generation.
[time=1673] You think he was serious about those who were committed to pretense?
[time=1678] You think he felt deeply about those who were given to externals? Look at Luke.
[time=1683] Matthew, Mark, Luke, go couple books over to Luke chapter 12.
[time=1688] For some reason, in some ways this brief passage almost hits a little closer to home.
[time=1697] I know for me as I looked at it this week, you see for yourself how it impacts you.
[time=1701] Luke chapter 12, verses 1 to 3.
[time=1704] How does our Lord feel about this? We'll read for yourself.
[time=1707] Under these circumstances, Luke 12, 1, under these circumstances, after so many thousands of the multitude had gathered together, that they were stepping on one another.
[time=1717] He began saying to his disciples, first of all this, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
[time=1728] Now watch, but there is nothing covered up that will not be revealed.
[time=1736] Nothing hidden that will not be known.
[time=1740] Accordingly, whatever you have said in the dark shall be heard in the light, and what you have whispered in the inner rooms shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.
[time=1751] People, the Lord, despises are foolish and self-serving and futile attempts to pretend.
[time=1760] He longs for sincerity of heart.
[time=1764] He longs for your honest, sincere and genuine willingness
[time=1770] to live your life and be who you are before him and each other.
[time=1776] Refusing and choosing not to indulge yourself and live a life of externals.
[time=1785] He longs for sincerity.
[time=1788] Well, word is the hypocrisy.
[time=1793] Word is the deep commitment to pretense, lead this greedy couple.
[time=1797] Go back to Acts chapter 5.
[time=1804] Acts chapter 5, we see in Acts chapter 5 verses 5 to 11,
[time=1810] our third point this morning, God's righteous judgment.
[time=1816] Write that down.
[time=1817] God's righteous judgment.
[time=1819] Yes, he is a God of love.
[time=1823] Yes, he is a God of mercy, but he is also a just God people.
[time=1829] And there are times when judgment is necessary.
[time=1834] And here we see in verses 5 to 11, God's righteous judgment.
[time=1839] Look with me at verse 5.
[time=1841] Peter has just said to him, why?
[time=1843] Why have you conceived this deed in your heart?
[time=1845] You have not lied to men, but to God, verse 5.
[time=1847] And as you heard these words, Ananias fell down.
[time=1851] Boom, right there.
[time=1854] Breathe is last, and great fear came upon all who heard of it.
[time=1861] And the young men arose and covered him up.
[time=1864] And after carrying him out, they buried him.
[time=1868] Verse 7, now there were elapsed an interval of about three hours.
[time=1872] And his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.
[time=1875] I mean, you can see it in your mind's eye.
[time=1877] Sophia is outside in the getaway car, right?
[time=1880] She's out there waiting, wondering what's going on.
[time=1883] One hour goes by, two hours go by, three hours go by, no Ananias.
[time=1888] She gets a little nervous, a little uncomfortable.
[time=1893] Doesn't know what to do, so she goes inside.
[time=1897] There are elapsed an interval of three hours, and his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.
[time=1902] And so she asks, and Peter, it says in verse 8, responded to her and said, tell me, whether you sold the land for such and such a price.
[time=1914] And she said, and there's a part of you, and there's a part of me that wishes we could have been there at that moment, and said, oh, wait a minute.
[time=1923] It's a fire.
[time=1924] Time out.
[time=1928] Think about this one.
[time=1931] Tell the truth.
[time=1933] Let all the pretense go.
[time=1936] It doesn't matter what people think.
[time=1938] It doesn't matter how you're viewed.
[time=1940] It's a fire.
[time=1941] Tell the truth.
[time=1945] Was this the price?
[time=1946] Did you sell it for such and such a price?
[time=1948] And she said, yes.
[time=1951] That was the price.
[time=1954] Verse 9, then Peter said to her, why?
[time=1956] Why is it that you have agreed together to put the Spirit of the Lord to the test?
[time=1960] Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they shall carry you out as well.
[time=1968] And she fell, boom, immediately at his feet, breathed her last, and the young men came in and found her dead.
[time=1976] And they carried her out and buried her beside her husband.
[time=1980] Don't miss verse 11.
[time=1983] And great, what?
[time=1986] Fear.
[time=1988] And great fear.
[time=1990] Inappropriate fear?
[time=1992] Manipulated fear?
[time=1993] No, no.
[time=1995] Great, holy, righteous fear.
[time=2000] Came upon the whole church and upon all who heard of these things.
[time=2006] Now, there are so many points, so many points of application to make here this morning.
[time=2012] We've only got time for a few, so please write these down, would you?
[time=2016] Please write these things down.
[time=2018] And I say that to you, and I'm inviting you as you write them down to please talk about.
[time=2022] I mean, just a few points of application from verses 5-11.
[time=2025] Talk about these things.
[time=2027] Talk about these things at lunch.
[time=2028] Talk about these things at night before bed.
[time=2030] Talk about them with your friends.
[time=2033] Talk about them with your spouse.
[time=2035] But make application.
[time=2037] Take the things that we see here in God's Word today and give some thought to them.
[time=2041] Pray about them.
[time=2042] Cross-reference these things.
[time=2044] Find other passages that talk about the same truth.
[time=2048] But don't let it go by.
[time=2049] First of all, first thing I want you to write down as far as the point of application.
[time=2054] Under this third point of Godly judgment is this, and don't miss it.
[time=2057] Please see how quickly God responded to remove the spiritual cancer from the body.
[time=2066] God's judgment was rapid, people.
[time=2070] Write it down.
[time=2071] God's judgment was rapid.
[time=2076] And you know what God's rapid, righteous judgment tells you?
[time=2081] You know what it reminds us of this morning?
[time=2083] You know what it should say to each of us loud and clear?
[time=2086] Here's what it should say.
[time=2087] It should tell you this.
[time=2089] God wants His bride.
[time=2091] God wants the church pure.
[time=2095] He wants His bride clean.
[time=2097] He wants a right.
[time=2099] Sin.
[time=2101] Sin in your life and sin in mind is to be confronted aggressively.
[time=2107] We are not to let it go.
[time=2111] You and me in our love for Him and in our love for each other, this passage among many other
[time=2118] things reminds us of how deeply He cares about the purity of the church.
[time=2123] And I've got to tell you this, and I'm just being honest.
[time=2125] Sometimes I grow so weary of hearing certain people respond when given the opportunity appropriately.
[time=2134] People responding like this, and maybe you've heard this, or maybe you have said this, and I have said this as well.
[time=2142] Who am I?
[time=2147] Who am I to go say something?
[time=2150] Who am I to stick my nose in?
[time=2152] Who am I to say that?
[time=2154] Who am I, Kelly, they say?
[time=2157] Well, I'll tell you who you are.
[time=2160] And please, this morning, be reminded of who you are with humility and with love and with
[time=2166] a sense of gentleness, who you are, is you're a member of the body of Christ.
[time=2172] And if you know Him and if you call this place home and as we live life together as a family, who you are is you're an integral part of what God's doing here.
[time=2180] And He died for you.
[time=2182] He saved you.
[time=2184] He gave us this church.
[time=2185] And He said, "Guard it." He said, "Keep it clean," and He didn't say it to me.
[time=2190] He said it to us.
[time=2192] And so who are you?
[time=2194] You are a member of the body of Christ, just like me and His hope in mind would be that your love for Him and your love for me might be enough that you might risk a threatening
[time=2205] situation, a difficult conversation, hard words to say in an effort to be the people
[time=2211] that God's called us to be.
[time=2213] Amen?
[time=2215] You've got to step up.
[time=2217] You have to and I have to lovingly and with humility say things that need to be said.
[time=2223] Mark my words and you don't need me standing here telling you this to know this is true.
[time=2227] You know it's true.
[time=2228] You've seen the repercussions of this.
[time=2230] And it's always, always true.
[time=2232] People sin.
[time=2234] Sin in this body.
[time=2236] Sin in your life or mind.
[time=2237] Sin somewhere in this family.
[time=2239] Sin, it starts like this.
[time=2241] You see that?
[time=2243] It starts like this.
[time=2245] And left unaddressed.
[time=2248] Left unconfronted.
[time=2251] It gets like this.
[time=2253] Doesn't it?
[time=2255] It gets huge.
[time=2257] And pardon the comparison.
[time=2259] I mean it's sad but it's true.
[time=2261] But if you think about like physical tumors.
[time=2266] Think about what happens when a physical tumor shows up around this place.
[time=2272] Oh my goodness.
[time=2274] Those things get, they get prayed over.
[time=2276] They get radiated.
[time=2277] They get chemoed.
[time=2278] They get extracted.
[time=2279] They get cut into analyzed, watched, removed and lasered.
[time=2284] Sin, spiritual tumors show up around here and what happens.
[time=2289] Too many times they get ignored.
[time=2291] Downplayed and shoved under rugs.
[time=2294] Ignore it.
[time=2296] It'll go away.
[time=2298] If you did that or I did that with a spirit, with a physical tumor, we die.
[time=2304] It would be considered malpractice.
[time=2306] It would be considered foolish, stupid, dumb, ridiculous, shortsighted.
[time=2310] Well what's the difference?
[time=2315] There's none.
[time=2317] There is no difference.
[time=2319] My passion to guard the church and you.
[time=2321] Your passion to guard the church and me from sin.
[time=2324] Not judgmentally but lovingly and boldly.
[time=2327] You should lead us to the kind of hard expressed by Paul in 2 Corinthians 11, 2 and 3.
[time=2334] Read the words along with me.
[time=2335] 2 Corinthians 11, 2 and 3.
[time=2338] It says it right here.
[time=2340] 2 Corinthians 11, 2 and 3.
[time=2342] For I, and this is Paul talking about the church that he loved so dearly.
[time=2346] He says, "For I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy.
[time=2350] For I betrothed you to one husband, that to Christ, as I might present you
[time=2356] as a pure virgin." Then he goes on in verse 3 and says this, "But I am afraid." He says, "I'm afraid." Well are you?
[time=2366] Am I?
[time=2367] I mean is there a healthy sense of fear, lest as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness,
[time=2374] your minds should be led astray from the simplicity and purity of devotion to Christ.
[time=2381] That's what my heart should say.
[time=2383] That's how your heart should think.
[time=2385] He should be such a love for him and such a devotion to this place, to the body of Christ that he gave his life for and such a devotion to each other that we have a godly sense of and a genuine sense of fear.
[time=2397] Not judgment.
[time=2398] I'm not talking about policing.
[time=2402] I'm talking about living life together in ways whereby when you have a chance to love me enough to say things that need to be communicated so that sin can be confronted, repented of.
[time=2414] If you can move on down healthy roads, that's the kind of heart God longs for.
[time=2418] You want to see this church die?
[time=2420] Do you want to see this church end or worse yet slip into a benign state of mediocrity?
[time=2426] Let sin go unaddressed.
[time=2429] One author said it this way, "Let the ravaging, destructive nature of sin permeate your family."
[time=2436] Find a foothold or two.
[time=2440] Just a foothold or two, somewhere in this place.
[time=2445] And those two or three footholds will become trails.
[time=2449] And those trails will be traveled.
[time=2451] And trails will become roads, and roads will evolve into highways.
[time=2455] And highways will turn into expressways, and expressways will give way to runways.
[time=2461] And before you know it, sinful jumbo jets will be landing and taking off around your church left and right.
[time=2468] He says, "I can show you today churches that used to believe in the truth, churches that used to stand for what is right, churches that used to stand behind the word of God.
[time=2479] And today they've compromised every bit of it.
[time=2484] And things are going on in those churches.
[time=2487] And doctrines have been altered in those churches.
[time=2490] And mission has been lost in those churches.
[time=2494] And the point that he makes later on is this.
[time=2496] You know what? They didn't wake up one morning and decide, boom, to become liberal in their theology.
[time=2503] His point is, they didn't wake up one morning and boom, decide to have sinful jumbo jets with runways of sin through their church.
[time=2511] No, it happened back where?
[time=2514] It happened back with a couple of two or three footholds that just got left alone.
[time=2520] Just shoved under rucks, ignored. It'll go away.
[time=2528] God's judgment was rapid people because he loves his church.
[time=2532] Do you? Do I? And are we willing to love him and each other that much?
[time=2539] Second thing I want you to see here from these few verses.
[time=2544] And she fell immediately at his feet and breathed her last breath.
[time=2551] Second thing I want you to see in the midst of this righteous judgment is that she was buried next to who?
[time=2558] Guys, say it louder.
[time=2564] Guys, who was she buried next to? Say it again.
[time=2567] Absolutely.
[time=2569] And she was buried men next to her husband, but a certain man named Ananias.
[time=2579] With his wife Sephira sold a piece of property and kept back some of the price for himself with his wife's full knowledge
[time=2587] and bringing a portion of it, he laid it at the apostles' feet.
[time=2593] Don't miss the fact this morning, men, that he leads his wife into sin.
[time=2600] This man led his wife, the one he was supposed to cherish and guard and guide and love and die for.
[time=2607] He leads his wife into sin.
[time=2611] And as it says in James 1, when lust has conceived, it gives birth to what?
[time=2616] Sin.
[time=2617] And when sin is accomplished, it brings forth what? Death.
[time=2624] Husbands, what are you actively, aggressively and intentionally leading your wife towards spiritually?
[time=2633] What are you leading her toward? What road do you have her on?
[time=2637] What track are the two of you headed down?
[time=2640] You may say, well, I'm not really, Kelly, actually, I'm not really actively or aggressively or intentionally leading her toward anything
[time=2647] to which I'd say you're wrong. You're kidding yourself. You're deceived.
[time=2653] No, no, no, no. You are leading her. You are intentionally and aggressively leading her somewhere.
[time=2659] That's not the question. Whether you are or aren't leading her somewhere is not the question.
[time=2664] You're leading her somewhere. The question is what?
[time=2667] Where? Where are you leading her? How are you lovingly giving guidance?
[time=2675] Ephesians 5.25, and you can open up there, guys. That guy'd encourage you to.
[time=2681] It's that famous passage we've seen many times.
[time=2684] It's that those few verses you often hear at weddings, maybe it was read at your own, but be reminded of it this morning.
[time=2690] Ladies, you're welcome to turn there as well.
[time=2692] It says in Ephesians 5.25, some powerful verses there. Those next four or five, six verses.
[time=2701] It's a good read. It's a good study. Anytime, guys. You should read through that, but let's look at a few things this morning.
[time=2706] Don't forget this. Ephesians 5.25 says you're to love her like Christ loved the church.
[time=2713] Do you see it there? You're to love her as Christ loved the church.
[time=2717] 5.26 says you're to help grow her spiritually. You see it there?
[time=2723] As with the washing of water with the Word. Washing her with the Word there in 26.
[time=2731] And then in 27, look what it says. That husbands, that husbands might present their brides.
[time=2738] In all glory, guys, don't miss this. That you might present your wife.
[time=2744] Whoever she is, whatever she's like, whatever challenges that represents, whatever joys that might bring.
[time=2751] Whoever she is, whatever your circumstance, that you might present her in all glory.
[time=2757] Having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and blameless.
[time=2764] Not dead laying next to you in some ditch of sin.
[time=2771] Holy and blameless with no spot or wrinkle.
[time=2777] Are you leading her to spiritual and relational health?
[time=2782] Or selfishly neglecting her and in so doing putting her life like cephyrus in danger?
[time=2792] Only three people can answer that question, guys. God, her and you.
[time=2798] Be honest, guys. Be honest, men. Be genuine husbands. Be sincere.
[time=2806] Answer the question. Answer it honestly. Answer it genuinely.
[time=2813] Repent where you need to repent. Offer apologies where apologies need to be made.
[time=2818] Chart a course that needs to be charted. And if you don't know how to chart it, ask for help.
[time=2824] This guy led his wife to the grave. Because of his greed and his sense that he could somehow fool God and lie to the spirit.
[time=2833] Where are you leading your bride? And guys who might even be thinking about marriage.
[time=2839] Where are you going to lead yours? Are you ready? Do you have an idea?
[time=2845] You have a pretty clear picture of what that might look like. You need some help? Ask.
[time=2850] Let somebody know that you want to love a wife well, that you want to chart a course that's God honoring.
[time=2856] Ask for help. Seek out direction.
[time=2862] Well, hey, some truth to take home and then we're going to be done.
[time=2865] Real quick, some things to, some other things to jot down and take home with you.
[time=2871] Just a basic number one, first thing, just a basic fundamental truth, okay?
[time=2876] That many of us in this room sometimes lose sight of. Look at verse three.
[time=2880] But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit?
[time=2887] And to keep back some of the price of the land. Verse four, while it remained unsold, did it not remain your own?
[time=2895] What does he mean by that? While it remained unsold, did it not remain your...
[time=2902] Ananias, you were in control of this thing. Was it not yours?
[time=2908] And after it was sold, was it not under your control? Answer? Yeah, it was.
[time=2915] He was in control of this deal. And after it was sold, was it not under your control?
[time=2921] Here you go. Why is it that you have conceived this deed in your heart?
[time=2928] All the things I bump into you guys, all the things I see, all the things we hear, all the stuff that's happening.
[time=2934] Not just in our world, but in our own lives, in our own families.
[time=2938] Somebody in this room this morning needs to hear this, and so we'll just say it again.
[time=2942] Truth to take home, number one, your sin is your fault.
[time=2950] Write it down. Your sin is your fault.
[time=2958] Now you're saying, Kelly, that's pretty basic. Yeah, it is. It is.
[time=2965] But do you think it's a good reminder? Oh, let me tell you.
[time=2970] So many times today, you and I try and lay our sin at someone else's feet.
[time=2976] Don't blame it on someone else. Don't lay it at anyone else's feet.
[time=2980] Your sin is your fault. Others may have done things. Hear me now.
[time=2984] Others may have done things or said things or not done or said things they should have any needed to.
[time=2990] Friends may cop attitudes with you. Kids may whine or not listen.
[time=2994] A reckless driver may cut you off, and insensitive spouses may embarrass or wound.
[time=3000] And all or some of the above may need to be dealt with, but your sinful choice is yours.
[time=3008] The enemy, back in verse three, said to Ananias, come on, make a little profit.
[time=3014] And Ananias could have said what? No. Not going to do it.
[time=3023] Your sin is your fault. And if you need help with it, and if you need encouragement, and if you need accountability, great, join the crowd. But your sin is your fault.
[time=3033] Number two, and I just want you to sense the unspeakable.
[time=3038] Second thing I want you to take home is the unspeakable value.
[time=3042] This passage places on honest sincerity before God and his people.
[time=3048] You guys have heard us say this. You have heard us say it in the past, and you have heard me say it in recent weeks, and you will hear me say it again and again and again.
[time=3059] We will lift up the Acts 2, Acts 4, book of Acts value of community, community, community.
[time=3070] You and me living life together. You and me loving God and loving each other.
[time=3075] You and me, and this place being about us, this place being bound, this place being woven together
[time=3081] by a deep sense of respect and love for each other that compels us to do things and say things
[time=3087] and give ourselves in ways that are radical and reckless in our love for God and each other.
[time=3092] Community, community. Here's the point. You look back at Ananias.
[time=3098] And I'm just imagining, and this is not in the text, this is just a point of application that I couldn't get away from.
[time=3105] You just wonder, and I imagine what might not have happened in his life.
[time=3112] And I can be very real and honest and talk about with you things this morning that wouldn't have happened in mine had I made certain decisions or had certain things in place.
[time=3122] What might not have happened to this guy and his wife had had he a friend or had he an avenue
[time=3129] whereby he could have gone to someone and said, "Hey, I am so completely embarrassed." What am I about to tell you? What am I about to share with you? I am so humiliated.
[time=3139] But I just got this thing and my God, I just, I want so badly for Peter and John to think highly of me.
[time=3145] I want so badly to be invited to these things. I just, it's sick.
[time=3150] And I'm actually been thinking about selling this property and keeping this stuff back.
[time=3154] And I know it's whacked, but just tell me I'm stupid. Tell me I'm playing with fire. Please.
[time=3162] See, I have, I have those conversations all the time in my life.
[time=3169] And the power of God and the Spirit of God and the people of God keep me.
[time=3174] I told you a few weeks ago, "Community is saving my life." Well, it is because it's growing my heart.
[time=3180] And this guy's heart had got away from him.
[time=3184] And I want you to sense and see in this book and in these passages the unspeakable value of write it down, honest sincerity before God and each other.
[time=3195] Honest sincerity before God and each other.
[time=3199] God will think highly of you.
[time=3202] God will think highly, you will be spiritually esteemed and appreciated in the eyes of God.
[time=3208] Don't miss this. Please.
[time=3210] You will be spiritually esteemed in the eyes of God when you love him deeply
[time=3216] and love others selflessly, not for notoriety, but because you love him deeply.
[time=3225] You get that? It's really basic, but it's so true and so very important for us to understand.
[time=3233] When you love him deeply and love others selflessly, not for notoriety, but because you love him deeply.
[time=3244] Well, let me ask you just to stay seated, and would you just bow with me for a moment?
[time=3252] Father, we can't go on this morning and we're going to, but we've got to stop and just say,
[time=3258] how convicted and how reminded each of us are.
[time=3263] God of the way we so oftentimes play games, games of pretense, games of externals.
[time=3272] And we want to worship you now this morning.
[time=3274] God as a family, we want to lift up our voices, but we've got to do that.
[time=3277] God with hearts that are right, and so we confess to you rampant pretense.
[time=3284] Things that probably have been done even this morning, even maybe now right here in your presence.
[time=3289] Stuff's been thought, things have been said.
[time=3292] Last night, this week, God, we want to be a people who come before you on a daily basis,
[time=3299] loving you honestly and sincerely, giving ourselves to those around us with that same kind of passion.
[time=3306] And we want it to be real, and we know we can't do without your help.
[time=3310] And so God from those who teach and speak to those who play instruments, to those who teach lessons,
[time=3316] to those who work with kids, to those who just live life with spouses and children,
[time=3322] and people on the job and family members, God everywhere we go, there's a call on our life
[time=3329] to be people who are real and honest before you, offering no pretense, only devotion.
[time=3335] And where it's ugly or where it's scary or where it's sad or where it's discouraging, God allow us the strength and courage to admit it as such.
[time=3344] And in so doing, have the chance to truly be Christians, because we live by faith and trust in you.
[time=3351] A God, a Lord who moves in and through our lives, growing us and changing us.
[time=3357] And God, we commit ourselves to that.
[time=3359] We commit ourselves to that in your son's name.
[time=3363] [AMEN - 98 seconds]
