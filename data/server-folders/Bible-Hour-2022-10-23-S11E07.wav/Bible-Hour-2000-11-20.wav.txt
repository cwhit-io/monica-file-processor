[time=0] (upbeat music) - Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service
[time=12] of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=13] Thank you for joining us.
[time=15] We trust that the music and message from God's word will help you in your Christian walk.
[time=20] Now let's join our service.
[time=21] (upbeat music)
[time=162] [MUSIC - 46 seconds]
[time=213] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 79 seconds]
[time=304] (upbeat music)
[time=313] [MUSIC - 175 seconds]
[time=498] [APPLAUSE]
[time=505] Let's continue worshiping the goodness of our God.
[time=509] [MUSIC - 92 seconds]
[time=604] - I sensed God's faithfulness recently.
[time=612] When a choir member told me that a new employee in their office told her that she had known me for many years, that years ago when she and her husband purchased a new home, they did it through me.
[time=625] And then she said, "You gave us tickets "to the living Christmas tree." And yes, they did come to the living Christmas tree and consequently, both husband and wife invited the Lord into their hearts.
[time=639] It's always good to remember that God will do what He said He will do.
[time=644] - I saw God's faithfulness in my mother's life just recently, she has returned to God.
[time=652] She's been going to church on Wednesday nights and the message recently was the difference between Christianity and religion.
[time=661] And she had grown up to believe that God was judgmental and mean.
[time=670] And through the ministries that she's heard here, she realizes that God is truly a loving God.
[time=678] When I think about faith and faithfulness, I think about at least three different things.
[time=684] I think about faith in objects, such as an automobile.
[time=688] And I have faith that it will run when I want it to run.
[time=692] And if it fails, then I may choose and lose my faith in that object and go somewhere else and get something else.
[time=698] I also think about faith in people, whether it be doctors or friends or coworkers.
[time=705] Sometimes they fail me and are not faithful in keeping their words and commitments.
[time=711] But when it comes to God, I accept Him as my personal Savior 40 years ago.
[time=717] I have found Him to be faithful to me in every circumstance, whether it be losing my health, losing a job.
[time=725] In every circumstance, God has been faithful to me.
[time=729] And I'm thankful for that.
[time=732] [MUSIC - 141 seconds]
[time=877] - Well, if you'd open your Bibles to Acts chapter five.
[time=889] As Ty said, we continue this morning in our study of this great book, the birth of the church and the growth of the gospel and it continues this morning.
[time=896] Acts chapter five, verses 12 to 42.
[time=900] What have we seen so far?
[time=902] As you look back in your mind's eye, as you look back in your heart, what have we seen so far in our study of the book of Acts?
[time=909] What comes to my mind and what comes to my heart is this, simple faithful people, men and women bound together by their undying commitment to follow Christ.
[time=919] We see the church, the body of Christ being birth and grown.
[time=923] And what we've seen are faithful followers of Christ who again and again and again are yielded to the Holy Spirit and seemingly, seemingly as we read, seemingly to me at least as I study and maybe even to you as you've listened and as you've read through these passages on your own, a group of followers who seemingly never once drift from their cause.
[time=947] Their love for God and their love for each other and their love for those living without Christ had so gripped their souls that the Lord's words in Matthew 28 go.
[time=959] He said to them and many of these leaders were there that day when he looked them in the eye and said go, go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them and teaching them.
[time=970] Acts 1, 8, the words of the Lord said to them, "You shall be my witnesses." And those words that they had heard, those words that had found a home in the core of their being seemed to ring incessantly as we watched them live.
[time=988] And as you and I watched them choose, those words seem to ring incessantly in their ears and in their hearts.
[time=994] It was their life.
[time=995] It was their very existence always.
[time=998] It would seem as you read and as you study and as we'd become more and more familiar with these people that they didn't show up on a Sunday.
[time=1008] Looking at each other like, well, what are we?
[time=1011] What are we doing?
[time=1012] What is this all about?
[time=1014] What is it that we're trying to accomplish?
[time=1017] No, they knew because their mission was what they lived.
[time=1020] Please hear me.
[time=1021] Their mission was what they thought.
[time=1023] Their mission was what they dreamed.
[time=1026] It consumed them.
[time=1027] It was who they were all the time.
[time=1030] People ask me, they say, Kelly, as you've studied, what would you say the difference is between the church in Acts and us today?
[time=1037] And I tell them one word, mindset.
[time=1039] Mindset.
[time=1041] Their mindset is different.
[time=1044] It's the you shall be my witness.
[time=1047] Mindset.
[time=1048] It seems to have never left the forefront of their hearts and minds.
[time=1052] It was what they lived.
[time=1053] It was how they thought.
[time=1054] It was how they prayed and lived.
[time=1056] Us today?
[time=1057] Well, us today at too many times, helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=1066] Too many times it seems in my own life and maybe even in yours that that's a phrase.
[time=1072] That's a phrase found in a building.
[time=1077] It's a phrase found in a building that we attend on Sundays.
[time=1081] See the difference?
[time=1084] And it's a big one.
[time=1087] You have life-changing truth that brings purpose and grips, hearts and consumes lives all the time on one hand and on the other hand you have a phrase in a building, church attendance.
[time=1101] Well, this morning, we come to a passage that will escalate even further the test and the struggle that came against these faithful followers whose mission consumed every part of their being.
[time=1117] And as we come to this passage, I want you to ask yourself this morning as we look at this, just a couple of questions.
[time=1124] Kind of on the side, but in a sense very much related to the central theme of where we're about to go.
[time=1130] Ask yourself this.
[time=1131] Does the persecution, time mentioned and he was right, the persecution is about to escalate here in chapter five.
[time=1137] It's gonna get even more severe in chapter six.
[time=1139] We're gonna see things in the next few chapters that will bottle the mind.
[time=1143] Does the persecution, here's a question.
[time=1146] Does the persecution escalate?
[time=1149] Because that's just the way it was back then.
[time=1152] Or, or does persecution escalate
[time=1158] when one mission is all-consuming?
[time=1162] Does persecution escalate when there is no drift from that which matters most in the hearts and lives of people?
[time=1169] And what would happen today if mission was truly and literally life-consuming, if devotion was truly deepened?
[time=1179] Would we see an escalation of persecution or was persecution present because that's just the way it was?
[time=1190] Well, okay, as you ask yourself that question and as you think that through, as we look at the passage, let's jump in, let's make our way through these remaining verses here in chapter five and we'll make some observations.
[time=1202] All right, just some observations along the way as we make our way through, pick it up in chapter five, verses 12 to 14.
[time=1210] It says there, and at the hands of the apostles, many signs and wonders were taking place among the people and they were all with one accord in Solomon's portico.
[time=1221] But none of the rest dared to associate with them.
[time=1224] However, the people held them in high esteem and all the more believers in the Lord.
[time=1230] Multitudes of men and women were constantly added to their number.
[time=1236] Stop right there.
[time=1237] At a place that had become a favorite meeting place for these early followers of Christ, Solomon's portico, and on the heels of Ananias and Sephira's sin and subsequent judgment, we see a paradoxical and very interesting dynamic at work.
[time=1256] You see it there in verse 13, go back there if you would.
[time=1259] It says, but none of the rest dared to associate with them.
[time=1262] However, the people held them in high esteem.
[time=1265] What's going on here?
[time=1266] Well, let me read it to you this way.
[time=1269] Follow along if you would.
[time=1270] None of the rest, meaning the unbelievers in the community there.
[time=1275] None of the rest, the unbelievers, dared to associate with them the followers of Christ.
[time=1283] Though the people, the unbelievers, held them the followers of Christ in high esteem.
[time=1292] One commentator explains it this way.
[time=1295] As unbelievers, they had great respect for the followers of Jesus and their devotion to their beliefs.
[time=1302] Surely, they also respected the mighty power of God displayed through them, but to balance the respect that might lead them to join was the fear that sin would be severely judged.
[time=1315] You see, the swift judgment of Ananias and Sephira kept the half-hearted and uncommitted from joining the followers of Christ.
[time=1323] The practice of dealing with sin, as we see here in Acts, helps maintain a pure church, end quote.
[time=1332] And I would say not just maintain it, but as the text would indicate, even grow it.
[time=1338] And that would be observation number one this morning.
[time=1341] Purity promotes growth.
[time=1344] Get it down there, circle.
[time=1346] It purity promotes growth, absolutely.
[time=1349] And all the more, verse 14, believers in the Lord, multitudes, a word used when they couldn't count.
[time=1356] There were that many, multitudes of men and women right on the heels of what had taken place with Ananias and Sephira.
[time=1364] The church explodes.
[time=1366] Multitudes of men and women were constantly added to their number.
[time=1371] Purity, people.
[time=1372] Purity in the local church, not perfection.
[time=1375] No, sinful, fallen people like you and me so committed to our Lord, so committed to each other, that sin is confronted lovingly yet aggressively, not because you're better than me, not because I'm better than you, but because, and we didn't mention this last week, and I wanna make sure that we do mention it this week, but because God's word says we should, because God's word calls us to.
[time=1400] Several places, come to mind, write this one down.
[time=1404] Matthew 18, Matthew 18.
[time=1409] You can turn there if you'd like.
[time=1412] I believe around verse 15, we see this process of discipline, we see this process of loving confrontation beginning to kick in.
[time=1422] In Matthew 18, it says that if a brother sins, that if a brother sins, I am to go to him pleading with him or her to repent.
[time=1433] That's the idea, that is the gist, that is the interpretation there in Matthew chapter 18, when a brother or sister sins, I am to lovingly, because I care for them, I am to lovingly, because I have the body of Christ in my heart, the guarding of and the protection of the body that he died for, I am to lovingly, and with restoration and reconciliation as a hope, I am to go to him or her, and plead for them to repent and walk again in obedience.
[time=1465] Make a note there, please.
[time=1468] It says that if a brother sins, sins, I'm not gonna come and confront you about what movie or music you listen to necessarily.
[time=1479] It's not about what you or I wear, this is not an issue of who I voted for, this is not a matter of what's in my refrigerator.
[time=1486] This is about sin, this is when you or I violate
[time=1492] biblical mandate, and because you love me and because you know me, you become aware of that, and your love for me and the body of Christ is so great, you come and you beg with me to repent, and walk again in obedience.
[time=1505] And it goes on to say that my love for him and the body should be so great that if he or she doesn't repent as that passage progresses, I should humbly take two or three others and plead again.
[time=1516] To take two or three others and plead again.
[time=1521] And then as the passage continues, it talks about going to the church that the church might.
[time=1527] As a church and as a family, be willing to plead again and pray for and call that person to a right heart
[time=1537] and a walk of obedience before God.
[time=1539] Now because we want to shame and not because we want to embarrass and not because we're better than anybody else, but because our love for that individual would be so great and our commitment to Christ, so cemented.
[time=1552] And because the word of God calls us to love and pursue each other that way.
[time=1558] And because it says it, we do it, and we should.
[time=1561] You should and I should.
[time=1563] With what attitude?
[time=1565] Write this one down.
[time=1566] Second Thessalonians 3.15.
[time=1568] Second Thessalonians 3.15 says I am two and you are to admonish him that we are to admonish him not as an enemy, but instead as a brother.
[time=1580] Did you get that?
[time=1581] Second Thessalonians 3.15 says that we are to admonish that brother or sister, not as an enemy, but instead as a brother.
[time=1588] What does that mean?
[time=1589] That means lovingly with hearts of kindness and sincerity.
[time=1594] Purity among the family people was used by God to grow the early church.
[time=1600] And I've got two questions for you this morning.
[time=1605] Pretty obvious and pretty forthright.
[time=1608] Are you pure?
[time=1610] There's there a sense this morning that as you live your life before God and as we live our lives before each other, is there a commitment to that in your heart?
[time=1620] Are you daily and on a regular basis praying for and asking for a greater sensitivity to that which you need to see and understand about yourself?
[time=1629] And some of it is hard to see some of it's more blatant.
[time=1632] You know that and I know that, but is there a sense where you long to live purely before God?
[time=1639] Second Question, are you willing?
[time=1644] Not knowledgeable enough and not bold enough, but are you willing in your heart because of your love for the body of Christ and your love for me and each other?
[time=1652] Are you willing to go to that person who you know today is living in sin?
[time=1658] Making decisions, making choices, harboring attitudes, carrying themselves in certain ways that you know to be because you know them an absolute violation of God's word and are you willing to go to them lovingly?
[time=1674] Does it mean everything to you?
[time=1676] That this place remained pure?
[time=1678] It should, it should mean everything to us.
[time=1682] God, God longs for his bride to be pure.
[time=1686] Let's keep reading verses 15 and 16.
[time=1689] To such an extent, multitudes right coming
[time=1695] and joining the church to such verse 15, to such an extent that they even carried the sick out into the streets and laid them on cots and pallets, so that when Peter came by at least his shadow might fall on any one of them.
[time=1709] And also the people from the cities in the vicinity of Jerusalem.
[time=1715] Did you catch that?
[time=1716] That's a first right there in our study.
[time=1720] Did you note the importance of that phrase?
[time=1722] Cities in the vicinity of Jerusalem, Acts 1-8, you shall be my witnesses in Jerusalem and what?
[time=1729] And out from Jerusalem, into Judea and Samaria, see it's starting.
[time=1734] The concentric circles of ministry are starting.
[time=1737] Now folks from outside Jerusalem are beginning to make their way.
[time=1742] Coming together, bringing people who were sick or afflicted with unclean spirits and they were all being healed.
[time=1748] The gospel not only was spreading, but now watch this interesting phrase found here in verse 15.
[time=1755] The gospel was also cutting across all socio-economic boundaries.
[time=1760] That's right, look at that phrase.
[time=1762] They laid them on cots and pallets.
[time=1769] Now just a brief reading of that might leave you saying, "Well, what's the big deal?" Well, look at this, the word for cots, all right, in the original language in the Greek.
[time=1779] The word for cots is clonaryon.
[time=1781] And what that means is this, small beds or couches, small beds or couches,
[time=1790] whereas the word for pallets described the straw-filled mattresses held together by threads used by the poor and homeless.
[time=1801] Who owned couches?
[time=1805] Say it.
[time=1807] The who?
[time=1808] The rich.
[time=1810] The rich and the wealthy, they had the couch, all right?
[time=1814] It was the poor and homeless.
[time=1815] They had the straw-filled makeshift mattresses and they were both being brought onto the streets, wealthy and poor alike, responding to the power of God that was being displayed through these individuals.
[time=1831] We're sensing the awesome and amazing presence of God as it was displayed through these faithful followers.
[time=1839] And that's what this brief section in this passage is about, the power of God.
[time=1844] Observation number two, make sure you got it down.
[time=1847] People will come.
[time=1849] People will be changed.
[time=1851] People will be ministered to.
[time=1852] Say it however you want to.
[time=1854] People will come when God's power, not man's, is displayed.
[time=1864] Think about it with me just for a moment, though hundreds of volunteers, vocalists, set designers, musicians and builders are about to embark on this year's living Christmas tree.
[time=1875] Who's behind the tree?
[time=1877] Who's bringing the living Christmas tree to this church and community?
[time=1883] Who?
[time=1884] God.
[time=1885] We had a sweet, sweet time of worship this morning.
[time=1889] I did, thoroughly and absolutely enjoyed it.
[time=1894] We had a sweet time of worship last Wednesday night.
[time=1897] I can't believe sometimes the spirit of this place as we give our hearts to Him.
[time=1902] And that time of worship was brought to us this morning by who?
[time=1907] And about who?
[time=1908] Worship that spoke of and showed off the attributes of and brought attention to who?
[time=1912] Scott and the band and the choir, no, who?
[time=1915] God.
[time=1918] When we as elders pray in someone's sickness leaves or someone's trauma goes away, what do we say?
[time=1924] Praise the elders, no, we say praise who?
[time=1927] God.
[time=1928] Flipping your Bibles back to 1 Peter.
[time=1932] Back towards the end of the New Testament.
[time=1934] Back past Hebrews 1 Peter chapter four.
[time=1950] Hebrews James and then 1 Peter.
[time=1952] Power of God being displayed.
[time=1956] The power of God being that which draws.
[time=1961] The power of God being that which makes a difference.
[time=1964] That has got to be lifted up.
[time=1966] That has got to be remembered.
[time=1967] There's a verse here in 1 Peter chapter chapter four, verse 11.
[time=1972] Every time I sit down here in this pew before I come up here to share with you what we see in the word of God.
[time=1980] Every time I speak anywhere, years and years ago I began to say this verse to myself.
[time=1986] You see it there, chapter four verse 11.
[time=1988] And it doesn't just relate to me, it relates to everybody in this body who would ever in any way shape or form give themselves to any kind of ministry.
[time=1997] It says in verse 11, whoever speaks, let him speak as it were the utterances of God.
[time=2003] Whoever serves, let him do so as by the strength which who supplies, say it.
[time=2008] God, so that in all things who may be glorified?
[time=2012] God, through Jesus Christ, to whom belongs the glory and dominion for ever and ever, amen.
[time=2018] People are drawn to the power of God.
[time=2023] People are drawn to the spirit of God, not you, not me.
[time=2028] It is about him.
[time=2031] And the day we stop around this place, the day we stop lifting up and attempting to reflect the power of God and instead get impressed with ourselves, we are completely and thoroughly finished.
[time=2045] Close the doors, go home.
[time=2046] This early church, these faithful followers of Christ,
[time=2053] they exemplify these truths.
[time=2055] Purity, promoted growth.
[time=2057] People came when God's power was displayed.
[time=2060] Let's keep going back to Acts chapter five.
[time=2063] Pick it up in verse 17.
[time=2064] Says there in verse 17, but the high priest, all right?
[time=2068] They've caught wind of all this.
[time=2070] And it says in verse 17, we're gonna read down through verse 28, but the high priest rose up along with all his associates.
[time=2078] That is the sect of the Sadducees.
[time=2080] And they were filled with jealousy.
[time=2083] And they laid hands on the apostles and put them in a public jail.
[time=2087] But an angel of the Lord during the night opened the gates of the prison and taking them out, he said, the angel to the apostles, go your way.
[time=2095] Stand and speak to the people in the temple, the whole message of this life.
[time=2100] And upon hearing this, they entered into the temple about daybreak and began to teach.
[time=2106] Now when the high priest and his associates had come, they called the council together, even all the senate of the sons of Israel and sent orders to the prison house for them to be brought.
[time=2116] But the officers who came did not find them in the prison and they returned and reported back saying, we found the prison house locked quite securely in the guards standing at the doors.
[time=2126] But when we had opened up, we found no one inside.
[time=2131] Now when the captain of the temple guard and the chief priests heard these words, they were greatly perplexed about them as to what would come of this.
[time=2138] But someone came and reported to them, behold, they said, the men who you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people.
[time=2147] Then the captain went along with the officers and proceeded to bring them back without violence.
[time=2154] For they were afraid of the people, lest they should be stoned.
[time=2158] Verse 27, and when they brought them, they stood them before the council and the high priest questioned them, saying, we gave you strict orders, not to continue teaching in this name.
[time=2170] And behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and intend to bring this man's Christ's blood upon us.
[time=2179] Stop there, observation number three.
[time=2182] Please know how true this is.
[time=2185] The enemy who as we know is very, very real.
[time=2190] The enemy will attack a pure and powerful church.
[time=2196] Do you even understand?
[time=2199] I mean, do you feel like you can really grasp the potential for kingdom advancing ministry when you have a church that is pure, when you have a church that is full of people who love God and each other that much, that they would hold up the purity of his bride as being so important that they would lovingly live together in such a way, so as to live by and abide by the truth of Matthew 18.
[time=2227] Do you understand what happens when a church marked by that kind of love for him and each other?
[time=2232] Is then coupled with in that same church a deep inter commitment to in no way, shape, or form, ever in any way, in any setting.
[time=2242] Try and keep for themselves that which is due God, a church that is completely selfless, a church that once only and always to lift him up and have his power be reflected.
[time=2255] Do you understand when those two things come together, the potential that that church has to make a difference for all of eternity?
[time=2262] Well, know this, know this, the enemy understands it.
[time=2268] He is very aware of it and he will stop at nothing to diminish or better yet get you and I to do our best to diminish God's work in this place.
[time=2279] Now in Acts five, he mistakenly thought he could use some of these small-minded, self-seeking Sadducees to intimidate these early believers into dialing it back a bit, backing off, keeping quiet.
[time=2294] We told you to be quiet.
[time=2297] Well, the enemy's attack comes in all shapes and sizes.
[time=2303] And if as a church you are pursuing purity and giving your glory to God, you will take some shots.
[time=2310] They got bullied.
[time=2311] What about us?
[time=2317] What about those of us in this place?
[time=2318] How do we get attacked?
[time=2320] What kind of shots do we take?
[time=2323] How's the enemy attempting to diminish God's work here?
[time=2326] Well, I'll tell you how he's doing it.
[time=2330] He is in his own way, in his own time.
[time=2332] He is going to, he is going to you and he is going to you and he is coming to you and you and you and you and you.
[time=2340] He is coming to all of us and he whispers in our ears what he whispers and he says to you what he says and he tempts the way he tempts.
[time=2349] And if he can get one of you, if he can get three of us back to last week if just a couple of footholds can be dug out.
[time=2363] The diminishing begins and I don't know for certain what he's saying to you in your ear, but I know for certain what he's saying to me in mine.
[time=2372] And here's the key, listen closely.
[time=2377] The enemy wants desperately to convince you and me that giving into the attack is more fulfilling than staying true to the mission.
[time=2385] He wants you to buy that.
[time=2388] He wants you to sense that.
[time=2389] He wants you and me in our hearts to believe that.
[time=2392] Let go of the mission, he says.
[time=2395] It's just a phrase in a building in a place you attend.
[time=2400] Don't kid yourself with this idea of living it incessantly and always.
[time=2405] Don't invest that much hard in time into the life of a seeking friend.
[time=2411] Don't do it.
[time=2412] He whispers in your ear.
[time=2415] Don't sacrifice that much.
[time=2417] Don't sing that loud.
[time=2419] Don't stretch yourself.
[time=2420] Don't give that much.
[time=2424] Don't pray that much.
[time=2425] Don't help those kids.
[time=2427] Don't change your schedule around.
[time=2432] Don't take your family to a new night of worship to go and invest in the hearts of little ones.
[time=2438] Don't do it.
[time=2439] These early believers stood strong and in their standing strong they leave you and I a model.
[time=2448] They leave you and I an example of how to stand strong in the face of the enemy's attack.
[time=2453] True, true to the mission, because it meant that much to them.
[time=2458] And he whispers the same things in their ears as he whispers in your ear and mind today.
[time=2465] It's no different.
[time=2466] And they stood and they lived with that kind of passion.
[time=2472] Let's keep going, look at verse 29.
[time=2476] Here you go.
[time=2478] Verse 29.
[time=2480] But Peter and the apostles answered and said, "We must obey God rather than men." The God of our fathers raised up Jesus whom you had put to death by hanging him on a cross.
[time=2495] He is the one whom God exalted to his right hand as a prince and a savior to grant repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.
[time=2503] And we are witnesses of these things.
[time=2505] And so is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey him.
[time=2510] Stop right there.
[time=2511] When I read that interchange, when I see what these, when I see what this counsel said to these followers of Christ and as I read Peter's response, I don't know about you, but my mind goes back to Daniel chapter three.
[time=2526] My mind goes back to a trio of young men, a trio of boys, teenagers, who stood before a crazed and whacked king named Nebuchadnezzar.
[time=2539] So full of himself that he built a 90 foot tall image of himself and commanded the entire country to bow.
[time=2545] And you look those boys in the eye and Daniel three and said bow, worship me.
[time=2552] And if you don't, I'll kill you.
[time=2555] If you don't, I will burn you alive.
[time=2557] Heat to furnace, he said, seven times, I think.
[time=2561] It's normal temp.
[time=2563] I'm gonna fry these kids when the music plays bow.
[time=2567] Then what did they say?
[time=2570] Same thing, these guys said.
[time=2572] I think the words are gonna be on the screen.
[time=2574] Daniel chapter three, verses 16 to 18, they looked at Nebuchadnezzar and said, and you can kind of sense and feel the attitude with which they said it.
[time=2581] They said, "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abedne go answer "and said to the king, oh, Nebuchadnezzar, "we do not need to give you an answer concerning this matter.
[time=2591] "If it be so, our God whom we serve "is able to deliver us from the furnace of blazing fire.
[time=2597] "And he will, mark our words, Nebuchadnezzar, "he will deliver us out of your hand, O king." I mean, either way, we might burn or we might go free, but you know what, he will deliver us from you.
[time=2609] But even if he does not, let it be known to you, O king, that we are not going to serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up.
[time=2621] With their lives on the line, what gave teenagers?
[time=2625] What gave young boys the courage and guts to look down a crazed king and say, "We'll obey God, not you." Well, it's the same thing, that work in the lives of the apostles.
[time=2637] As they stand before the chief priests and Sadducees, who they knew at any moment, at any time could resort to violence.
[time=2645] And it's the same principle at work, and it's our fourth observation.
[time=2652] Make sure you get it down, obedience people.
[time=2654] Obedience breeds courage.
[time=2660] I can't tell you how many times in my own life, and in the lives of those here in our family at Blackhawk, I can't tell you how many times I've watched an amazement as God has worked this principle out in the midst of enormous confusion and pain in your life and in mine.
[time=2680] I've seen it again and again and again and again.
[time=2686] Scary, difficult, faith-stretching situations that you have found yourself in.
[time=2694] Scary, difficult situations that I've found myself in.
[time=2699] The call to continue to love somebody, so very difficult to love.
[time=2707] Redemptive conversations that need to be had.
[time=2713] I have seen you live, and you have seen me live.
[time=2716] We have watched each other live in circumstances that evoke fear and confusion and the kind of responses that sound like this.
[time=2723] I don't think I can.
[time=2725] I just don't think I can stay at it.
[time=2727] I don't think I can say that.
[time=2731] Don't ask me to go there because that's a place.
[time=2735] It just terrifies me.
[time=2737] You've felt it, you've seen it, you've said it.
[time=2740] And again and again what I think many of you have seen, and again and again what I know I've realized and experienced is this very truth.
[time=2748] That when there is a willingness, not that you've got it figured out or not that somehow the road has been clarified, but when there is a willingness to go where God has called you to go and do what God has called you to do, no matter how scary or frightening it might be, somehow, someway in the midst, even of taking the literal steps, knocking on the door, picking up the phone as the conversation begins, I've felt it.
[time=2773] A courage, I didn't have five minutes before.
[time=2776] A strength of heart and spirit that didn't exist the day before.
[time=2782] Tell me you've nod with me, tell me you've been there, tell me you've sensed that and seen that.
[time=2787] Oh, it's true, obedience breeds courage.
[time=2790] And all along as the pages of Acts have unfolded for us the story of these faithful followers, again and again they have been obedient.
[time=2798] The angel releases them from prison in our very passage this morning and says go back and do the very thing you got put in here for.
[time=2807] And what did they do, vote?
[time=2809] No, they obeyed and they went and boldly did what God had called them to do.
[time=2814] Our obedience, watch this.
[time=2816] Our obedience cultivates a strength of heart.
[time=2825] Our disobedience, don't forget, our disobedience cultivates a hardened one.
[time=2835] A calloused one.
[time=2838] Disobedience moves the heart away from God honoring living.
[time=2848] Helping seekers, find and follow Christ.
[time=2852] Won't mean a hell of beans.
[time=2854] It'll mean squat.
[time=2857] It won't mean a thing to anybody whose heart is hard and whose choices are leading them in a pattern away from the word and truth of God.
[time=2867] Whereas if you're willing and if I'm willing to give ourselves not to perfection, but to purity.
[time=2873] And if there is a willingness in your heart and mind to be consumed, not just with a phrase or a building or a place, but with a way of thinking and living.
[time=2882] Hearts get grown, hearts get softened.
[time=2886] Let's finish up.
[time=2890] Verses 33 to 42.
[time=2892] Verses 33 to 42, but when they heard this, this council, this group of leaders, when they heard this, it says they were cut to the quick and were intending to slay them.
[time=2905] All right, cut to the quick, they were angry.
[time=2908] They were so angry, they were ready now to kill these men,
[time=2914] to do away with them.
[time=2916] But a certain Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law respected by all the people stood up in the council and gave orders to them, gave orders to put the men, the apostles, outside for a short time.
[time=2927] And then he said to them, "Men of Israel, "oh, time out," he says, "take care what you propose "to do with these men.
[time=2934] "For some time ago, the Eucharist rose up, "claiming to be somebody, and a group of about 400 men "joined up with him, and he was slain, "and all who followed him were dispersed "and came to nothing.
[time=2948] "After this man, Judas of Galilee rose up, "and the days of the census and drew away "some people after him, he too perished, "and all those who followed him were scattered.
[time=2958] "And so in the present case, I say to you, "stay away from these men and let them alone." What he had said to them was that there were these two examples of men who had risen up, created kind of a stir, actually attracted a following.
[time=2972] And the Sadducees, the council, they had not killed them, but in the process of their movement, they had been killed, and once that had taken place, the movement had dispersed.
[time=2983] And so he says, "Let them alone," verse 38, "for if this plan or action should be of men, "it will be overthrown, but if it is of God, "you will not be able to overthrow them, "or else you may even be found fighting against God." Verse 40, they took his advice, well, sort of, as you'll see.
[time=3006] And after calling the apostles in, they flogged them and ordered them to speak no more in the name of Jesus and then release them.
[time=3014] So they went their way.
[time=3017] So they went on their way from the presence of the council, rejoicing.
[time=3021] Rejoicing that they had been considered worthy to suffer shame for his name.
[time=3026] And every day in the temple and from a house to house, they kept right on teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ.
[time=3035] So here's how it stacks up, follow along.
[time=3038] So they live lives of faith, exercising obedience again and again, they stand before this insecure, twisted group of religious hypocrites and they don't cave an inch.
[time=3051] They did the right thing, they obeyed, they hung in there.
[time=3058] And verse 40, after calling the apostles in, they flogged them.
[time=3064] They beat them to be flogged in that day, well, it was to be physically beaten, 40 lashes with the whip.
[time=3072] Observation number five.
[time=3076] So important to remember, obedience.
[time=3079] While it does cultivate courage, people obedience doesn't always bring in the human sense relief.
[time=3088] It just doesn't.
[time=3090] Obedience doesn't always bring in the human sense relief.
[time=3095] You see, too many times we want our willingness.
[time=3098] You may disagree with this, you may agree.
[time=3100] My experience has been too many times we want our willingness to obey, to be the trigger that when pulled delivers God's blessing and rescue, bringing relief from pain and clarity out of confusion and yet nowhere, nowhere you guys in all of scripture is this promised.
[time=3121] Relationship with God, nowhere in scripture is painted as some cause and effect situation where if you do this, he'll do this.
[time=3131] You do the right thing, life's happy.
[time=3135] What is stated, what is stated is so very important for you to see and for me to be reminded of again this morning.
[time=3142] What is stated is this, obedience to him, you and I living in right relationship with him, he says brings, write this down, he says it brings peace.
[time=3150] That's what he says.
[time=3153] God's word does say that, that it brings peace.
[time=3157] Now you may say, oh, okay, okay, I'll take that, I'll take peace, I like that.
[time=3160] It's almost like, you know, life working out, I'll take peace, that's good, but wait.
[time=3165] Wait, before we get too excited about peace, make sure you understand what that peace looks like.
[time=3172] Make sure you understand the process by which he promises to bring you and me as he leads us toward the peace that he brings.
[time=3179] Turn just over one book to Romans chapter five.
[time=3182] We're gonna close right here.
[time=3184] Go over to Romans chapter five.
[time=3192] He does promise peace, though our obedience in nowhere in scripture is said to promise or guarantee things as we'd like them.
[time=3202] Immediate relief from pain or confusion, we do know this, God and relationship with God brings this sense of peace.
[time=3210] Romans chapter five, it says this, therefore having been justified, verse one, therefore having been justified by faith.
[time=3220] We have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom also we have obtained our introduction by faith into this grace in which we stand and we exalt in hope of the glory of God and not only this, but we also exalt in our watch this in our tribulations, knowing that tribulation brings about perseverance and perseverance brings about proven character and proven character brings about hope.
[time=3251] And that's peace and that passage reminds you and that passage reminds me that there will be things, there will be situations, there will be people that we've faced and it will be a tribulation and we know that to survive a tribulation, to survive a difficult circumstance, we need perseverance and he grants us the power to persevere and with perseverance comes proven character.
[time=3279] And when we persevere again and again and again, resting not on ourselves, but in the strength that only he provides, character is built, character is built it says, and proven character brings hope.
[time=3292] Not an easy road sometimes, not a happy road sometimes,
[time=3299] but a road that brings with it peace.
[time=3303] And peace is hope.
[time=3305] Peace is the hope that though we face what we face today, a day is coming and there is a place when we will be without pain, when we will be without tears, when we will be without hurt and confusion.
[time=3320] Until then, tribulation, perseverance, proven character and hope.
[time=3325] And that is the peace.
[time=3328] That is the peace that he provides and that is the very peace that we see these faithful followers of Christ all through this book of Acts, experiencing and living out.
[time=3339] They had a mission people, they had a mission.
[time=3341] From this morning, I just wanna remind you and I wanna remind myself, live out our mission, live it.
[time=3349] Pray it, dream it, think about it.
[time=3353] Pursue it, give yourself to it wholeheartedly all the time and don't let it for a moment be a phrase and don't let it for a moment be about a building or a place that you attend, they did.
[time=3366] They gave themselves to it constantly and it changed the world.
[time=3370] Question for you and for me today, what or who do you think he would allow us to impact?
[time=3377] If we were in a growing sense consumed and absolutely given over in our hearts and lives to helping seekers both saved and searching, find and follow him.
[time=3389] God use me, God move in my life, God prepare me, God teach me and grow me, do whatever you've gotta do to help me be a part of that kind of mission.
[time=3397] I hope that would be your prayer, I hope that would be your desire, I hope that represents as it does in my own life, what rests at the core of who you are this morning.
[time=3411] Let me ask you to stand if you would and we'll close in a word of prayer.
[time=3415] Let's pray.
[time=3421] Father, we bow before you this morning, having again been as we have been over these last couple of months, reminded God of a people much like us.
[time=3429] Simple, uneducated people who in the scope of things really were underqualified, but God they so rested in you.
[time=3438] They so were given to you and to your truth and to that which God you had told them and you told them to go.
[time=3445] And so God as we go this morning, it is our prayer that we would go with purpose, it is our prayer and our hope this morning that in the hours ahead, in this day, and then in the days that you give us in this week, God that we would live with a purpose and a mission, God that in our hearts we would be given at work and at home and with family and friends to helping people, seekers, far from you and those close to you, find and follow you.
[time=3470] God allow that more and more and more so to grip and consume our hearts and lives.
[time=3476] God thank you for the privilege that is harsh to be together in a place like this and to worship you as we've tried to this morning, we pray God, as Patti prayed earlier, that it would have been and was in fact pleasing to you.
[time=3489] Give us strength, encourage to face whatever it is you have for us in the days to come and we'll look forward to being together again tonight and your son's name.
