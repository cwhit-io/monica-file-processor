[time=0] (upbeat music) - Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service
[time=12] of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=14] Thank you for joining us.
[time=15] We trust that the music and message from God's word will help you in your Christian walk.
[time=20] Now let's join our service.
[time=22] [MUSIC - 31 seconds]
[time=58] - I just felt it in my heart to read this.
[time=68] Anyway, we've been singing a few songs.
[time=72] It's about the beauty of Christ, the name of Christ, His holiness, His mercy, love, forgiveness, power, might.
[time=82] Now visualize this, and I saw throne in heaven and someone sitting on it, the one sitting on the throne was as brilliant as gemstones, Jasper and chameleon.
[time=95] And the glow of an emerald circled his throne like a rainbow, 24 thrones had surrounded him, 24 elders sat on them, and they were all clothed in white, had gold crowns on their heads, and from the throne came flashes of lightning, rumbles of thunder, and in front of the throne were seven lampstands with burning flames, they are the seven spirits of God, in front of the throne was a shiny sea of glass, sparkling like crystal, in the center and around the throne or four living beings, saying day and night and night and day, holy is the Lord God almighty, the one who always was, who is, who is still to come.
[time=142] Whenever the living beings give glory and honor and thanks to the one sitting on the throne, they lay their crowns, the 24 elders lay their crowns before the throne and say you are worthy, oh Lord, our God, to receive glory and honor and power for your created everything, and it is for your pleasure that they exist and were created.
[time=165] And last night when I was reading this, the movie came to my mind, which is kind of funny, The Wizard of Oz, and Dorothy sings, somewhere over the rainbow, way up high,
[time=179] there's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby.
[time=182] And when I thought of that, I thought it'd be great to go there.
[time=187] But as I read this, I have a somewhere over the rainbow.
[time=194] It's God's land, and I'm going to get to go there someday.
[time=198] (audience applauding)
[time=204] It is for real, it is true.
[time=206] We Christians who serve, I love this book of Acts that the pastor's working on, are telling us about.
[time=211] Those Christians back there felt the Holy Spirit thousands a year ago, and here we are today, feeling the Holy Spirit.
[time=219] He's still here, he's still alive.
[time=222] And I believe in this book with all my heart.
[time=225] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 240 seconds]
[time=474] No one can take this joy away. I believe. I believe. I believe. I believe. I believe.
[time=504] Open up your Bibles, if you would, to the Book of Acts. We are going to jump right back
[time=517] in this morning and continue in this study of this great book. This morning, we come to Acts 8. Acts 8, and we're going to start out this morning looking at verses 1 to 8.
[time=529] And I'm just going to actually ask if you would just follow along here as I read Acts 8, verses 1 to 8. In fact, why don't we do this? Just we don't do this all the time.
[time=540] In fact, we rarely do it. But just in honor of God's word, would you mind standing with me? And let's stand and read this. I'll read it. You follow along. But let's stand and do it before Him. It says in Acts 8, and it might help if I get to Acts instead of
[time=556] 2 Corinthians. Acts 8, verses 1 to 8, and Saul, referring back to what just happened at the
[time=565] end of chapter 7. As Stephen met his martyr's death, it says here in Saul was in a hearty
[time=571] agreement with putting him to death. And on that day, a great persecution arose against
[time=577] the church in Jerusalem, and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles. And some devout men buried Stephen and made loud lamentation
[time=589] over him, and Saul began ravaging the church, entering house after house, and dragging off
[time=595] men and women, he would put them in prison, therefore, verse 4, those who had been scattered
[time=601] went about preaching the Word. And Philip went down to the city of Samaria and began proclaiming Christ to them, and the multitudes with one accord were giving attention to what was said by Philip as they heard and saw the signs which he was performing, for in the case of many who had unclean spirits, they were coming out of them, shouting with a loud voice, and many who had been paralyzed and lame were healed. And there was much rejoicing
[time=628] in that city. Father, as we come to this passage, and as we come to the remaining time in our morning, our prayer is that the Word of God, Your Word, and it's truth. Not me and not
[time=641] my explanation, and nothing that any of us would add to this or bring to it, but God
[time=647] simply and only the power and strength and might of Your Word would penetrate our hearts
[time=653] and lives, reminding us, teaching us, showing some for the very first time Your truth and
[time=659] its implication in our lives. And again, we thank You with one voice for a courageous people who were willing to live through with strength and endurance these days. And God,
[time=670] as we read and as we study again this morning their story, we pray, we would be strengthened.
[time=676] We would be encouraged and that we would see with our own eyes and our own hearts the truth
[time=682] and that it would change us. In Your Son's name we pray, Amen. You can be seated.
[time=688] On Sunday, January 8, 1956. On Sunday, January 8, 1956 on the shore of a lonely river deep
[time=699] in the Ecuadorian jungle, five missionary men led by Jim Elliot and Nate St. were ambushed
[time=705] and murdered by a group of primitive Alka Indians. News of the massacre shocked and
[time=712] saddened an on-looking world. Many felt as if their deaths were nothing more than a senseless tragedy. Leaving a ministry cut short wives without husbands and children now without their dads. And yet it was a voice from among the dead. And yet it was a voice from among
[time=729] the dead that brought deep insight and new perspective. You see, Nate St. himself had
[time=735] written just days before his death these very words and I quote, "As we weigh the future and seek the will of God, does it seem right that we should hazard our lives for just a
[time=746] few savages?" As we ask ourselves this question, we realize that it is not the call, it is
[time=752] not the call of the needy thousands that compels us. Rather, it is the simple intimation of
[time=758] the prophetic word of God that there shall be some from every tribe in His presence in
[time=766] the end on that last day. And in our hearts, we feel that it is pleasing to Him that we
[time=772] should interest ourselves in making an opening into the Alka prison for Christ. End quote.
[time=780] As we continue this morning in our study of the book of Acts, many of us may be feeling the same way about what could seem to some as the untimely, unnecessary and unfortunate
[time=791] death of Stephen, which occurred here at the conclusion of our look at chapter 7. On the
[time=797] surface one might be tempted to say, "What a waste, what a tragedy, a godly young man
[time=804] full of wisdom and character, a powerful gifted servant of God, a kingdom advancing tool lost. But then comes chapter 8. Then comes chapter 8. Then comes in chapter 8 what
[time=824] always comes. What always has and always will come in their experience and in your experience
[time=831] and in mine, what always comes comes. What inevitably comes on the heels of pain and confusion
[time=837] is the goodness of God. And oh, it came. In His time and in His place we know, Romans
[time=846] 8 says, that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who have been called by God according to whose purpose, his purpose. Not yours and
[time=857] not mine, not your timeframe, not your timetable, not my scenarios, not my agenda. All things
[time=865] Romans 8 says, he causes all things to work together for good, to those who love him,
[time=871] to those who have been called according to his purpose. So we ask, what was the good?
[time=878] Where is it? What does it look like? Show it to us. What was the good brought about by Stephen's death and the escalating persecution that ensued? And please take note, it was
[time=888] escalating. It was getting worse. And more and more so the text teaches us, it was getting
[time=894] worse and escalating by the hand and hardened heart of a young man named Saul of Tarsus,
[time=901] a devout, look at Galatians chapter 1. Flip over a few books. Past first and second Corinthians
[time=908] to Galatians chapter 1. This young man Saul of Tarsus, the book of Acts will show us and
[time=916] we'll see in these coming verses how much of what took place, much of the persecution, much of the torture. Taking place at the very hands of this man Saul who was a devout student
[time=928] of Judaism, look at Galatians chapter 1 verse 14. Again Paul himself, a saved, regenerate
[time=935] Paul now writing later down the road, but he writes of himself in Galatians chapter 1.
[time=940] And I was advancing, you see it there verse 14 and I was advancing in Judaism beyond many
[time=946] of my contemporaries among my countrymen being more extremely zealous for my ancestral traditions.
[time=956] Go over to Philippians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians. Learn a little bit more quickly
[time=962] here this morning about this young man Saul, Saul of Tarsus, this persecutor of the church,
[time=968] verse chapter 3. A devout student of Judaism and then Philippians chapter 3 verses 5 and
[time=976] 6 says this, again Paul speaking, the regenerate, saved Paul, now writing back the church at
[time=982] Philippi says this in verse 4. I far more, circumcised verse 5, circumcised the eighth
[time=991] day of the nation of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews, asked to the law of Pharisee, asked to zeal a persecutor of the church, as to the righteousness which
[time=1003] is in the law he considered himself as being found blameless. He was in his own estimation
[time=1010] perfect and he loved his ancestral traditions and he loved his religion and he was going
[time=1017] to do all that he could to persecute and punish anybody or anything or any movement that would
[time=1023] come in his way. Full of self, righteous arrogance, he was the self-appointed persecutor of the
[time=1029] church, given authority by the high priest. He enters home after home, literally dragging
[time=1036] men and women from their families. Pain was being inflicted, torment and death became common and Saul was behind most of it. He hated Christians. Acts, I think it's 26 and
[time=1048] we'll see this later in our study. In Acts 26 it even indicates that he chased Christians
[time=1055] down in foreign countries. He hated them that much. He tracked them down like a dog
[time=1064] and brought these people back to be persecuted and killed. So what was the good? So what
[time=1072] was the good brought about by Stephen's death? Well it's right here, back in our passage in Acts. Back in Acts chapter 8 you find the good. You see what God was up to. His plan
[time=1081] begins to unfold. Acts chapter 8 right there in verse 4. Therefore, you see it? Therefore
[time=1089] those who had been scattered went about preaching the word. Preaching the word. The phrase preaching
[time=1100] the word refers to the proclamation of the gospel, the telling of the good news, the
[time=1107] saying of the truth. All scattered believers, don't miss this, all scattered believers were
[time=1114] involved in evangelism. Though certain individuals were uniquely gifted as evangelists, all believers
[time=1121] are called then, now and in the future, called upon by God to share, to voice and articulate
[time=1129] the truth about Christ. And as they found themselves on the run, as they found themselves scattered,
[time=1137] as they found themselves coming under daily new levels of persecution, they were a people
[time=1144] that wherever they went, they shared, they voiced, they articulated the truth. There was
[time=1150] a boldness and a courage. And so scattered people begin to spread the gospel. The persecution
[time=1157] which appeared unfortunate was in the end of a big boost to redemptive history. The persecution
[time=1165] of Acts 7 and 8 leads to the very first missionaries. Think of it that way. And that's exactly
[time=1171] what it was. The persecution we see in these chapters leads to the first missions movement
[time=1177] in the church. Somebody said it like this, Satan's attempt to stamp out the fire of the
[time=1183] early church merely scattered the embers starting new fires all around the then known world.
[time=1190] In the words of an early church father, Tertullian, he said this, the blood of the martyrs became the seed of the church. Their blood and their sacrifice and their boldness and their courage
[time=1202] and their unrelenting commitment to live out their mission was what grew the church. Back
[time=1210] to chapter 8, verses 4 to 6. Therefore those who had been scattered went about preaching the Word and Philip went down to the city of Samaria. Don't forget Acts 1-8 and you shall
[time=1221] be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in Judea and Samaria. Here it goes. And Philip went down
[time=1228] to the city of Samaria and began proclaiming Christ to them. And the multitudes with one
[time=1234] accord were giving attention to what was said by Philip as they heard and saw the signs which he was performing. This Philip that we see here in this initial part of chapter 8 was
[time=1248] not the apostle Philip as it stated back at the beginning when the folks scattered. Not
[time=1256] everybody scattered. The apostles it says stayed in Jerusalem. And I was talking to
[time=1263] a friend recently. Isn't that a great picture? He was saying and we were agreeing. Isn't
[time=1269] that a great picture when you think about these apostles and when you think about Peter and when you think about John, when you think about some of the things that these men have been through and when you think about some of the choices they had made in the past, some of the times when they had run, some of the times when they had scattered, some of the times when they had shied back from that which God had called them to and now persecution hits, now it's getting ugly. And it says the Christians scattered but the apostles stayed where? Jerusalem. Right in the thick of it. Right in the heat of it.
[time=1301] Can you see them looking at each other in the eye saying we're not going? We're not going anywhere. We're going to stand right here. We're going to be who God's call us to be. We're going to keep shepherding those who we can here in Jerusalem. And so this
[time=1314] Philip is not the Philip of the apostles. This would be the Philip who along with Stephen was chosen as one of the seven if he'll recall back to that passage. And he takes the God gospel to Samaria. Now, now it gets interesting. As the gospel makes its way to Samaria, as
[time=1331] the gospel spreads and the early church now continues to expand, we meet a man in Samaria
[time=1338] named Simon, Simon. And with Simon, we come face to face with what is ultimately I think.
[time=1346] And it's one man's opinion, but I believe it with all my heart. With Simon, we come
[time=1352] face to face with what is ultimately the greatest tragedy of all, the saddest reality anyone
[time=1359] could ever face. What do we encounter? In Simon, we encounter a faith that didn't save. In Simon,
[time=1371] we encounter a false faith, a faith that does not save, a faith that may even externally
[time=1378] on the outside even appear genuine, but in time falls empty and flat, lacking the substance
[time=1384] of truth and sincerity. It reminds me of a quote I copied down years ago as I listened
[time=1392] to my pastor at that point teach through the book of Matthew. And I think this will come
[time=1398] on the screen. It impacted me at that point. It impacts me every time I read it. And I think it's something that we need to take note of. He said it this way. One of the most fearful realities in all of Scripture is that some who think they are saved will be, in
[time=1413] the end, eternally lost. Thinking they are on the narrow way of saving truth that leads
[time=1419] to heaven, they are in reality on the broad way of religion that leads to destruction.
[time=1425] They will one day hear from the Lord Jesus Christ, the most shocking, terrifying words
[time=1431] any human could ever hear. The word spoken in Matthew 7, "I never knew you depart from
[time=1438] me, you who practice lawlessness." To their horror, they will discover too late that there
[time=1446] is an entrance to hell at the edge of the very gates of heaven. Wow. To their horror,
[time=1460] they will discover too late that there is an entrance to hell at the edge of the very
[time=1467] gates of heaven. And at that point, nothing, absolutely nothing can be done. And so I
[time=1482] want each and every one of you to give this some thought. And we're going to slow down
[time=1488] at this point. I mean with respect to our study of the book of Acts, with respect to
[time=1494] this passage and with respect to this chapter at this point, we're going to slow down for
[time=1500] the rest of our time to gather this morning. And we are going to together consider this
[time=1506] truth. I want everybody here today and everyone who calls this place home and everyone watching
[time=1513] by way of the Bible hour and everyone listening to a tape. I want everybody with an ear shot
[time=1519] of my voice as we look at and communicate the truth of God's Word and what this passage
[time=1525] and the scriptures have to say about this issue to listen and to consider and to honestly
[time=1531] open your heart and your eyes and your ears to what God may want to bring assurance with
[time=1538] regard to in your life or what He may want to remind you of or what He may want to show you, what He may want to help you uncover or discover for the very first time. We will
[time=1550] today and then again on the 31st because we'll break here for three weeks in the middle of December for some special Christmas messages. But again on the 31st, we will take a look
[time=1561] at this man's Simon. And in verses 9 to 24, we will see among other things four principles
[time=1569] that lead to hell, four principles, four truths that lead to hell, four faults in a faulty
[time=1577] faith, a faith that doesn't save. And the one thing I'd want to tell you, I just remind
[time=1586] you of, say to you this morning as we begin to look at these four faults in this man's
[time=1592] faith who maybe to some degree thought he was saved, where these four faults end, where
[time=1600] these four faults lead, they lead every single time. And why do I say that? I'd say that
[time=1609] because it's so important that you would understand and so important that I would be reminded of the fact that I am not an exception and nor are you. There is a way that God's
[time=1619] word describes. There is a way that Scripture articulates saving faith. And so many times
[time=1627] in this man's life and in your life in mind we bump into opinions and ways of thinking
[time=1633] that even to some degree sound true and right but in the end fall flat. And so this morning
[time=1639] I would invite all of you to join me at a personal look, an inside glance at this man's
[time=1647] Simon, and four faults of a faulty faith. Number one, a faulty picture of self. You want
[time=1659] to take an initial glance at faulty faith, you will find each and every time that within faulty faith there is a false picture of self. Verses nine to eleven. Now there was a certain
[time=1670] man named Simon who formerly was practicing magic in the city and astonishing the people
[time=1678] of Samaria, claiming to be someone great. And they all, from the smallest to the greatest,
[time=1685] were giving attention to him saying, "This man is what is called the great power of God."
[time=1691] And they were giving him attention because he had for a long time astonished them with his magic arts. Four faults to faulty faith. The first one, a faulty picture of self. Do
[time=1706] you realize? And it's a question this morning to you. Do you realize that pride, that pride
[time=1716] and inflated opinion of oneself, keeps more people than you could ever imagine out of
[time=1722] heaven and eternity with God? I'm well read. I have it all figured out. I don't need God.
[time=1729] I'll invent my own God. We hear it and see it and bump into it day after day. The view,
[time=1737] the view that man left to himself is essentially good is as pervasive as it is damning. It
[time=1745] lulls its victims into a false sense of security. And what happens is this, a message or better
[time=1751] yet a mindset that sets fourth man's inherent goodness deadens people to the reality of their
[time=1757] own sinfulness, to the reality of God's appropriate judgment of that sin and blinds them to their
[time=1764] need for a Savior. They don't see reality. And this idea and this notion that man is left
[time=1774] to himself inherently good and right blinds them to their own need for salvation. And
[time=1781] their pride, they say, I'm fine. You've heard it and I've heard it and I keep hearing it.
[time=1786] I'm fine, they say. I'm not lost. I'm educated. I'm content. I'm going places. I'm at peace
[time=1793] with myself. I'm not floundering. I'm finding my own way. And in a self-made, self-reliant
[time=1800] culture, we too many times miss the truth. Being educated or content, being wealthy, finding
[time=1806] your own way, well read or even religious doesn't get you saved. It doesn't get you home. It doesn't get you to God. Romans 3. Romans 3. Turn in your Bible to Romans 3.
[time=1820] As you think this through in your own heart this morning, as you think it through maybe in relation to those that you're sharing your life with and trying your best to communicate truth with. Romans 3 clarifies it so clearly and so succinctly and so powerfully, left
[time=1836] to himself, left to his own tendencies, man in his natural state. Romans chapter 3, start
[time=1843] there in verse 10. It says, as it is written, there is none righteous, not even one. There
[time=1850] is none who understands. There is none who seeks for God, left to himself, in and of his own nature, left to his own natural tendencies. It says, there is none who seeks for God.
[time=1862] All have turned aside. Together they have become useless. There is none who does good.
[time=1867] There is not even one. And it brings to mind the issue. And every time I read this it brings
[time=1875] to mind the issue. And it's an issue that we have to deal with and you and I have to think through. And I bump into this issue oftentimes as I read things and see things,
[time=1885] especially as it pertains to my kids, especially as it pertains to parenting or even education
[time=1893] in today's culture. There is this debate and there is this train of thought that says
[time=1899] we must instill in our kids and we must instill in each other this tremendous and healthy
[time=1906] sense of self-image. And I want you to know that I think, again, according to what God's
[time=1914] word says, there are some things we have to be careful of there. Some things we have to be cautious of. Now, let me say this, I don't have any problem nor do I think God
[time=1926] has any problem with you and I coming alongside kids and/or each other and saying, great job.
[time=1933] Boy, you've been given. Boy, you've been given talent. Boy, you've been given gifts.
[time=1938] You're all right. I don't have any problem going on to the golf course with my son. We've had a great time in his early little golf career. We've had some great times together. He's experienced some initial success. I have no problem saying to him, you are the man. Great
[time=1954] job. You get that swing going. You get your mind and you know who's going to beat you?
[time=1960] How did boy go? You're awesome. I have no problem saying that to my son. I don't think
[time=1966] you should have any problem saying that to your daughter or grandson or friend. You are too and great. You're awesome. And I hope and I would suspect that we might in this group
[time=1977] at least understand the context within which I might say that to my son or you might say that to a friend or your own child. Because now, once the context comes to his spiritual
[time=1989] standing before God, once we move from recreation to eternity, once we move into the serious
[time=1999] component of life that is so very important. It is so extremely necessary that he understand
[time=2009] at this young age that he is not awesome as a human being before God, that he is a sinner.
[time=2020] And now, are there ways that I can help communicate that to him? Are there ways that I can say that to him? Are there ways that his teachers here in Sunday school, that his mom and me as we spend time reading through the scriptures together with him? Are there ways that we can communicate that to him without saying to him, "You're a sinner. You wretched little
[time=2040] thing." Of course, there are. But the message has got to be there. The message has got to
[time=2049] be there. And please, let me at least try to make my point, I believe, with all of my heart that so many times today, and not only is it a natural consequence and a natural road that the enemy takes people down, I realize that, but so many times today when a 23-year-old looks me in the eye and says, "What are you talking about? I'm a sinner. What are you talking about? I'm in need of salvation. What are you talking about?" It's because
[time=2073] they're entire lives. They have been told the opposite. They're entire lives. They have never in the spiritual dimension ever had that conversation, ever had that notion communicated
[time=2082] to them. Self-image versus sinner, we have to work very hard to strike that balance.
[time=2090] You have to work very hard to communicate that truth, and so do I. But fundamentally,
[time=2098] in the spiritual realm, in the spiritual arena, God's word is clear. There is none left to himself. There is none who are righteous. No, not even one. Paul said in Romans 7, the
[time=2110] passage that was being taught when I, myself, came to know Christ. He said at the end of
[time=2116] Romans 7 there, he says, "Oh wretched man that I am. Who will deliver me from this body
[time=2124] of sin?" He had a healthy spiritual self-image. "I am in need. I am imperfect. And I stand
[time=2135] in need, and I stand imperfect in view of a holy and righteous God." Oh wretched man
[time=2143] that I am. Pride. You see how it works. Pride keeps those far from God in a self-deceived
[time=2150] state of spiritual indifference. "I don't need spiritual truth," they say. "I've got
[time=2156] me. I'll figure it out." Well, don't forget it. It wasn't your grandma or your dad who first said, "Pride goes before the fall." It was the word of God that said it first.
[time=2169] Write it down. Proverbs 16, 8, "Pride goes before destruction." And James, back at the
[time=2176] back of the New Testament, you can write this one down. James chapter 4 verse 6, James reminds us that no one can be saved while holding on to pride because, quote, God, it says in
[time=2187] that verse, "is opposed to the proud." God is opposed to the proud but gives grace to
[time=2194] the humble. And I know it might seem basic and it might seem fundamental to many of you
[time=2201] in the room this morning. If I were to ask you the simple question, again, what might be the you simple? Why is God opposed to the proud? What's the big deal with pride? Why
[time=2212] would God be opposed? In the Greek that phrase means to stand in opposition against. Why
[time=2219] would God be opposed to the proud? And others of you here this morning, again, may be early
[time=2225] on in your spiritual journey, still asking questions just like this and it may seem very intriguing to you. Why would God be against anybody? And so I ask you this morning, why?
[time=2239] In your mind today, why in your heart as you think it through to the degree that you can, why would God be opposed to the proud? Why in Job 35, 12, does it say they cry out but
[time=2251] he does not answer because of the pride of evil men? What is it about pride that is so dangerous and offensive to God? Here you go. Best answer I could come up with. The pride
[time=2264] of self-reliance is so offensive to God because it rejects and it shuns. Because it rejects
[time=2272] and shuns the gift of God's own son, given as a sacrifice to die in the place of a sinful
[time=2279] needy, lost human race. And when man, when you or I stand in the face of God and say,
[time=2287] you know what? No thanks. You can take your Ephesians 2, 8, and 9 and keep it to yourself.
[time=2294] I don't care that it says for by grace through faith you were saved. Not as a result of works
[time=2301] that no one should boast. It is a gift that says, it is a gift of God. Not as a result
[time=2308] of works that no one should boast. The prideful man or woman looks him in the eye and says,
[time=2314] keep it. I'll get by on my own. I'll do my own thing. I'll find my own way. Simon was
[time=2323] in essence claiming to be someone great. It says that in the text. Claiming to be someone great even to the point of claiming deity. Remember this as you turn back to Acts. Remember
[time=2336] this. Only the humble. Only the humble. Aware of their personal and spiritual inadequacies.
[time=2347] Only the humble. Aware of their need and flaws. Have that sense of need that drives
[time=2353] them to God. It is the poor in spirit. It is those with broken and contrite hearts. Not
[time=2359] the proud who experience saving faith and forgiveness.
[time=2367] First fault in a faulty faith and a faith that doesn't save is a faulty picture of self.
[time=2378] We learn more as the text unfolds and as we begin to see this man's Simon and what he was really about and what he was really after. The second thing we learn about his faulty faith was this number two. A faulty picture of salvation. You'll see it every time. Someone
[time=2394] who is in the midst of a false faith. Someone who is in the midst of a faith that doesn't save. As you look at them and as they look at themselves, they will begin to see that they have a faulty picture of salvation and that is exactly what we see here in the life of Simon. Look with me at verses 12 and 13. It says in verse 12, "But when they believed Philip, preaching the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ,
[time=2420] they were being baptized men and women alike. And even Simon himself," it says in verse 13,
[time=2427] "believed. And after being baptized, he continued on with Philip. And as he observed signs and
[time=2435] great miracles taking place, he was constantly amazed." You know what I've seen more times
[time=2443] than I'd wish? And maybe you've seen it, maybe you've experienced it, maybe you've watched it with your own eyes. And I've seen it more times than I care to recall. I've seen people praying prayers of salvation, people coming to Christ, people committing themselves to the Lord in order to get something. As if they could use their prayer as a chip in this game
[time=2469] of salvation, as if they could somehow manipulate God, as if somehow something as precious and
[time=2477] something as dear to him, something as magnificent as salvation could somehow be bargained for
[time=2484] or toyed with. I've watched people pray prayers of salvation in order to get a girl to go out
[time=2501] a marriage. I've watched folks come to Christ, quote unquote, to get assurance with respect
[time=2508] to a career move. I've watched people approach the throne of grace enter into a relationship
[time=2514] with Jesus for better business contacts, better social exposure and a better golf swing as
[time=2523] if God cared. You see, Simon's magic, you've got to go back to the passage. And this isn't
[time=2532] reading between the lines. This is just a careful look at what was transpiring in this guy's life. And you've got to go back to Acts 8 and you've got to go back to these passages, these verses we just read. And you've got to realize that Simon's magic was no
[time=2547] match for Phillips. Not Phillips' magic, but the spirit of God working through Phillips.
[time=2553] No match. People were through Phillips' ministry coming to Christ by the multitudes it said.
[time=2560] They were coming to Christ in droves through what Phillip was doing by virtue of the power of the Holy Spirit. And as more people followed Christ, Simon saw his own following, what?
[time=2573] Indelling, getting smaller. There weren't as many people anymore, so astonished with him.
[time=2580] Not as many folks calling him God as they were earlier. And so, as the text unfolds,
[time=2587] what in essence happens is absolutely pathetic. Simon's declining popularity, his own desire
[time=2596] to stay connected with the hot ticket in town and his hope that in keeping close to the action, he could somehow obtain the secret to Phillips' power. All of this leads Simon
[time=2607] to believe. Leads Simon to supposedly confess. You see like so many in our own culture today.
[time=2621] Simon, please hear this. Like so many in our own world and in our own community and even
[time=2627] some maybe in your own life and maybe even some here this morning. Like so many in our
[time=2633] culture, Simon looked at salvation as an external matter, an external thing, an additional act
[time=2643] to his life rather than a thorough and complete transformation of his whole being from the
[time=2652] inside out. Please hear that. People ask me today, do you think my faith is real? We'll
[time=2662] have conversations about salvation. We'll have conversations often. I have them frequently
[time=2669] with people who are curious about and really genuinely wanting to know if in fact what they prayed back here, if in fact what they said at that meeting, if in fact the commitment
[time=2680] that they voiced over here in this setting we'll have conversations and they'll want to know do you think it's really real? Kelly and I ask them, I say has your heart in life
[time=2691] been thoroughly changed? Has your heart in life been thoroughly changed? And part of
[time=2699] me wants to say I don't want to make something so incredibly complex, that simple but you know what in essence it is at least in its beginning stages of this explanation to you it is that simple because God's word talks about and God's word teaches and God's word says that the one truly saved will be thoroughly and completely changed from the inside out.
[time=2723] I ask them, I say to them, I engage them in conversation and I engage you in conversation this morning if in fact this applies. Is it your life, your heart, your soul, your very being, is it in the process of being transformed? Are the word of God and the spirit of God
[time=2739] and the people of God being used better set allowed to alter and encourage and redirect
[time=2746] your life? Because if in fact that's happening, if in fact your whole being from the inside
[time=2754] out, if in fact you are being transformed and changed by the word of God and the spirit of God and the people of God, chances are you probably are. That's probably a good sign
[time=2767] of genuine salvation. If it's not you may want to think it through some more, you may want to ask some more questions because it may not be and that isn't for me to determine
[time=2778] and that isn't for you to judge about another and you will never hear me and none of you should ever answer that question. No, I know you're not because you don't know and I don't
[time=2790] know what I can say to you and what we can say to each other is God's word gives us a pretty good glimpse of what genuine salvation looks like. Take a look, see where you're
[time=2803] at, see how it's going, see how it's progressing, really some say and I say yeah look at James
[time=2809] two and so I'll say yeah to you, look at James two, let's keep thinking this through, Hebrews,
[time=2815] James, James chapter two, look with me at verse 14 and what we'll see here isn't, what
[time=2833] we'll see here is a great test and that's what the book of James is as you work your way through the book of James you see and you find it to be a book of tests, good tests, tests that help you and I understand the genuineness of our faith and here we find this test as
[time=2849] it relates to faith and works, look at verse 14 of James chapter two, it says what uses it my brethren, if a man says he has faith but he has no works, okay now stop there, as
[time=2863] we read through this passage and as you look through this yourself and as you hear me talk about, I understand this, when we use the word, when we use the phrase works, what do we mean
[time=2872] by works, very important question to ask, very important for you to get clear as we make our way through this passage about faith and works, works, write it down if you need to, works as James talks about works, as I speak about works this morning, works are acts of
[time=2888] obedience, acts of obedience, things that you now do that you didn't used to, if we're
[time=2895] talking about the issue of salvation and what life was like here and what life is like now, these works of faith can be looked at as acts of obedience, new attitudes, new values, loving
[time=2907] decisions, faithfulness and devotion to spiritual truth, that's what he means by works.
[time=2914] And he says what uses it my brethren, verse 14, if a man says he has faith but he has no works, can that faith save him, if a brother or sister is without clothing and in need
[time=2926] of daily food and one of you says to them, go in peace, be warm and be filled and yet you do not give them what is necessary for their body, what use is that?
[time=2938] Even so, verse 17, in other words, just as the illustration just painted the picture there,
[time=2947] and so if it, faith has no works, it is dead, being by itself.
[time=2955] But are you going to, verse 20?
[time=2958] But are you willing to recognize you, foolish fellow, that faith without works is useless?
[time=2963] Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac, his son on the altar?
[time=2971] You see that faith was working with his works and as a result of the works, faith was perfected.
[time=2977] Verse 26, "For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works
[time=2984] is dead." What does this mean?
[time=2986] What it means is this, listen carefully, works don't save you, don't get confused, works,
[time=2993] this passage teaches, works don't save you, what this passage teaches is that they give evidence that you are, what, saved.
[time=3004] They give evidence, they proclaim, they give testimony to the fact that you genuinely are,
[time=3010] because if you genuinely are, you will be giving yourself to, out of a transformed heart and life, good works, acts of obedience that you didn't used to do, that you didn't used to care about.
[time=3024] What does it say in 2 Corinthians 5, "All things have passed away, all things have become what?" New.
[time=3030] New things.
[time=3032] Different, transformed, changed is the heart and soul of one who has come to genuine faith
[time=3038] in Christ.
[time=3040] Simon, people, Simon didn't get it.
[time=3045] Simon didn't get it.
[time=3046] True salvation.
[time=3048] He didn't understand, he didn't grasp that true salvation isn't just a mere profession
[time=3054] or ritual.
[time=3055] It's not just a walk down an aisle or a hand raised at camp, it is the complete reshaping
[time=3061] of the soul, followed by the complete reshaping of one's life, followed by the complete reshaping
[time=3069] of one's activity.
[time=3074] There's got to be a, not a faulty picture of salvation, but a true and accurate picture
[time=3081] of salvation, he had a bad view of self and he had a faulty view of salvation.
[time=3092] And as we get to the end of the passage in a few weeks, it actually is sad.
[time=3099] I mean, it's always sad, but as we read it and study it together, you will see along with me how very, very sad it is for one to be so close, for one to be in the very presence
[time=3111] of it, for one to in a sense have almost tasted of it, for one to have been actually presented
[time=3119] with it, but to not have grasped it, to not have held it dear, and you will see along with
[time=3131] me as we come to the end of our, as we come to the end of this month and we jump back in on the 31st and we look at the remaining parts of this passage, you will see the absolute sadness and the tragedy of one who in the end chooses to walk because his pride and his
[time=3150] view of salvation and his faulty view of the spirit, it's the third thing we'll see, and
[time=3156] then his faulty view of sin, you'll see how all four of those things lead to a faith that
[time=3163] doesn't save.
[time=3165] Now the next three weeks, I can't wait, and I hope you're as excited as I am, I can't wait to be together, I can't wait for the season and the sense and the chance that we have to celebrate what we're about to celebrate, can't wait for it to escalate, and in those three weeks, we're going to come together every Sunday morning, the 10th, the 17th and the 24th, and we are going to look at a series we've entitled Don't Leave a Gift Unopened,
[time=3192] and we are going to look at the gift of Christ, and I want you to hear this briefly before we go.
[time=3198] We're going to see three things, and I want you to be thinking about this, and I want you to be pondering this, and I want you to be praying for this, if you would, please.
[time=3206] And not only for yourself, but even for others who you know, who may need to hear these things, and who may benefit from a chance to interact with the truth as it relates to these things.
[time=3217] We're going to see how when you open the gift of Christ, how when you choose to not leave that gift unopened, and you open that gift, among the myriad of things that you receive,
[time=3229] we're going to see in week one how he is a Christ, how he is a Savior, a Lord that understands,
[time=3236] he is one who understands everything, empathizes with and understands everything you see and
[time=3243] experience in your life, the next week we're going to come back and look at how when you open the gift of Christ, you receive one who forgives, always has, does, and always will,
[time=3254] everything.
[time=3255] He is one who forgives out of his great love and amazing grace for you and for me.
[time=3261] He understands he forgives, and thirdly, when you open the gift of Christ, you realize you receive a gift that saves.
[time=3267] He understands he forgives, he saves.
[time=3270] The next three weeks, the gift of Christ, and I hope you'll be praying for that and getting ready for that and would love to see you join us and be a part of that in the next three weeks.
[time=3279] Then the 31st, we're going to jump back into our study of the book of Acts.
[time=3284] Would you stand with me this morning?
[time=3285] Let's close in a word of prayer.
[time=3291] And with your heads bowed and your eyes closed, if I could, let me just ask you this, or let me just at least present you with this opportunity.
[time=3303] We could think of nothing greater, and there would be nothing that would bring any greater level of joy to my own heart and the hearts of those who call Blackhawk home, than if
[time=3314] there might be even one today or more, and my guess is there's probably many.
[time=3320] And you stand here with us this morning and you've maybe been coming and maybe for the last few weeks or the last few months even.
[time=3329] You have stood here and sat here with us and you have exposed your heart and mind to the truth.
[time=3334] And as you've exposed your heart and mind to the truth and as you've also continued to kind of battle and wrestle with the issues of your life, maybe this morning we come to a point where you're ready to ask some more serious questions.
[time=3347] You need the opportunity to sit with one and maybe discuss with one some things that you
[time=3353] really need some answers to.
[time=3355] Maybe even this morning as we talk about a faith that doesn't save, as God's word speaks
[time=3361] to this faith that leads to death, eternal death.
[time=3367] Maybe there's things that you really want desperately to discuss, questions to ask,
[time=3374] statements you want to make and things you want to hear responded to.
[time=3378] We would love to do that.
[time=3379] We would love for you to come down afterwards and just meet with us and talk with us.
[time=3383] We'd love to hear what's on your heart.
[time=3385] The safe place, Blackhawk, safe place to hear a life-changing, dangerous message that has
[time=3393] the potential to alter your eternity forever.
[time=3396] And we would love for the privilege to talk to you about that.
[time=3399] So come down afterwards and talk with us and join us and we'll spend some time together.
[time=3404] Father, we stand as a people amazed again at the sweetness of worship, the glory of your
[time=3411] word and the way that it speaks to individuals and the issues of life and culture.
[time=3417] And God, we pray that as we leave this place, that these truths would go with us, that these principles, these things that we've seen from the early church and maybe even more specifically from this man named Simon, God, that these things would cause each of us to look intently
[time=3434] and honestly and sincerely into our own faith.
[time=3438] But God, with your help, that we might be able to evaluate and assess the genuineness of
[time=3444] it, the sincerity of it, and God, if we need help.
[time=3449] If they already convinced in this room any one of them feel like they need help thinking some fundamental things through God, it would be our prayer that they would ask either a good friend or one that they know and trust or even one of us in leadership.
[time=3463] Father, we want to be a people whose faith is real, whose love for you is genuine.
[time=3469] And we pray that your spirit and your word and your people would move us in that kind of direction.
[time=3475] Bring us back together again tonight for a time of worship and prayer and we thank you for what you'll do.
[time=3481] In the in-between hours, we thank you for the work that will get done today on the tree.
[time=3485] We look forward to tomorrow and the week leading up to the people that you'll bring.
[time=3490] Thank you.
[time=3491] Loving us, thank you for giving us the privilege of doing your ministry and give us strength and grace to accomplish it in a way that would honor you in all God's people said, amen.
