[time=662] Hey, good morning, everybody.
[time=664] Great to see you.
[time=665] What a great, great time of year and what a great opportunity.
[time=668] We have in the next couple of weeks, as Ty mentioned to you earlier, we start this morning a three-week series called Don't Leave the Gift Unopened.
[time=676] I'm going to take a break in our study of the book of Acts, and we'll jump back in there on the 31st of December.
[time=683] For the next three weeks, we're going to just take a close look.
[time=686] And there's no way in three weeks we can cover it all.
[time=689] But when you think about what you get, when you think about what we are privileged to receive,
[time=695] when you open the gift of Christ, it really is an overwhelming thing.
[time=700] It is an amazing truth when you begin to look into the Scriptures and see the things that come your way,
[time=706] to see the things that you and I are able to benefit from, to see the things that the Lord brings to us in our life.
[time=713] Now, again, it's not all about what we get, obviously, but there are some things that He brings to life,
[time=719] to everyday life that are life-changing, that are unbelievable, that are amazing.
[time=726] And we want to look at three of those things in the next few weeks.
[time=729] And this series is for everybody.
[time=732] And I want to make sure you understand that.
[time=734] Don't leave the gift unopened.
[time=736] Be thoughtful and mindful of what comes your way as you open the gift of Christ.
[time=742] There are many in the room this morning who have opened the gift of Christ.
[time=746] You know Him.
[time=748] This season for you is extra special because of the relationship that you have with Him.
[time=754] The fact that He came and He came the way He did and lived and died to you, it means something extremely special
[time=761] because of what you have experienced in your life and heart with Him.
[time=765] And so you celebrate not only the birth of the Savior, but the fact that you know Him personally.
[time=771] And you may have known Him for two months, you may have known Him for two years, you may have known Him for twenty.
[time=776] But this is a special time for you because it's very personal for you.
[time=781] You've opened the gift.
[time=783] Others of you here with us this morning.
[time=785] You haven't opened the gift.
[time=789] Not yet.
[time=790] You're still in the process of thinking these issues of faith through.
[time=796] Still contemplating what it might mean, what it might look like, what it might do to your life and mean for you to kind of
[time=803] cross over that line of faith and enter into that relationship with Him.
[time=807] And this series is as much for you as it is for me.
[time=811] My hope is that it would be a three week time where you would come and you would consider what really is at stake.
[time=819] And if in fact you were to trust Christ, if in fact you were to give your life to Him.
[time=826] What kinds of things does He bring?
[time=830] What kind of experience would be Yours?
[time=832] What kind of relationship?
[time=834] When we talk often about that, your personal relationship with Christ, well what would be entailed in that relationship?
[time=842] And we would have to go for years and years and years every Sunday to cover it all, but we're going to just go three.
[time=848] And we're going to talk about three things that are entailed in that relationship that you can.
[time=854] And I hope would have and share with Him.
[time=857] This morning, week one, He understands.
[time=863] I've been sharing this story with those at the tree each night and so if you've been, you'll hear it again this morning.
[time=870] If you haven't been, well you'll hear it now.
[time=872] But it all just ties together so well.
[time=874] It was 1989.
[time=878] It was my very first job that I had as a pastor.
[time=883] I was still in school, finishing up seminary, but I was able to, with a good friend of mine, take this small church and we were just having a great, great time.
[time=891] It was my very first, I think, month, maybe on the job.
[time=894] And every day was full of new experiences and new surprises.
[time=898] And on one of those days, I had a new experience and it was my very first hospital call.
[time=905] They called from the hospital and a lady there had requested that a pastor from our church come and visit her and her family there at the hospital.
[time=912] They were there at the hospital in their moment of crises and so I, not really knowing what to do or even what to expect.
[time=918] Jumped in the car, made my way down to the hospital, parked, went inside up to the appropriate floor and down the hall and walked into the room.
[time=926] And when I walked into the room, this is what I saw.
[time=928] This is what I came face to face with.
[time=931] Came face to face with a mom, a mother standing at the foot of her bed, at the foot of a bed.
[time=936] And next to the mom was a father and then behind him a brother.
[time=941] And all three of them had tears just streaming down their cheeks and laying in the bed was their ten-year-old daughter dying, fading quickly, having lost her battle with leukemia.
[time=954] And what was left was just a shell, a broken and diminished little body laying underneath those sheets.
[time=963] And as I introduced myself, before I could even get the last, my last name out, before the words even could come out of my mouth, this little five-foot-three, five-foot-four mother, with fists clenched, almost jumped out at me, right up into my, underneath my face, and she looked up at me.
[time=983] And now she's crying even harder, and she said, and they had called, again, they had called for us to come, and yet she comes, and she gets right in my face and says, "Don't you even start.
[time=994] Don't even try to say to me or to communicate to me that you understand because you don't."
[time=1003] And her fists are waving and pumping, and she says, "Don't start with the identification thing.
[time=1009] Don't even tell me that in any way, shape or form, you can identify with my pain because she said, "Believe me, you can't.
[time=1018] You don't know how I feel." And having said that, my heart broke even more because she just began to sob, chest and stomach kind of began to convulse, and she began to let out those anguish from the gut sobbing wails that maybe you've heard before, or even maybe you yourself have cried.
[time=1040] And her body shook and she just leaned against the wall and slid down to the floor, and her husband and son came and they just cried.
[time=1049] Hours later, the little girl died.
[time=1054] And as I left the hospital that day, I remember as if it was yesterday, walking to my car and saying, "Oh Lord, please, please let me somehow someway, let us introduce her, the mother."
[time=1068] It's where my mind and my thoughts were.
[time=1070] Somehow, someway, Lord, let us introduce her to Jerry Shackleford.
[time=1080] See, I wanted so desperately for her to meet and get to know Jerry Shackleford and her husband George, friends of ours, who just 18 months prior to that day, had lost their own 16-year-old daughter Stacy.
[time=1093] To her battle with leukemia, you see, Jerry had stood next to a bed and held a hand of a daughter who was dying.
[time=1100] Jerry understood the confusion. Jerry understood the pain.
[time=1104] George and Jerry knew what it was like to watch a lively 16-year-old fade away into brokenness and slip away into death.
[time=1113] And I wanted her to meet our Lord.
[time=1116] I wanted so desperately for her to know Christ because of what it says in Philippians chapter 2.
[time=1122] You can open that there.
[time=1124] If you would, I wanted desperately for her to know the Lord because of what it says in Philippians chapter 2 about our Lord.
[time=1134] Because it says there in Philippians 2, have this attitude in yourselves which is also in Christ Jesus, who, verse 6,
[time=1143] through although he existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped.
[time=1150] But what?
[time=1151] But emptied himself, taking the form of a bondservant and being made in the likeness of who?
[time=1160] Men.
[time=1162] Being made in the likeness of men, and don't miss what it says down there in verse 8, and being found in appearance as a man he what?
[time=1170] He humbled himself.
[time=1172] I wanted desperately for this mother, for that entire family to know the Lord because of what it says later in the New Testament back in Hebrews.
[time=1180] Slip back to the back of your New Testament just before you get to the book of James just after Phileme and it says in Hebrews chapter 2 verse 17.
[time=1190] It says therefore he had to be made like his brethren in all things that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God to make propitiation for the sins of the people.
[time=1206] For since he himself was tempted in that which he has suffered, he is able to come to the aid of those who are tempted, of those who are challenged.
[time=1219] I wanted this woman and her family to know the Lord because of what it says just two chapters later in Hebrews 4.
[time=1226] Flip over a few pages.
[time=1230] It says in Hebrews 4 verse 14, "Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens Jesus the Son of God let us hold fast our confession, for we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses.
[time=1248] But one who has been tempted in all things as we are yet without sin.
[time=1254] Let us, verse 16, "Let us therefore draw near." I wanted so desperately in my heart that day as I walked in the car, I wanted them to know the privilege of being able to draw near, to draw near to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and may find grace to help in time of need.
[time=1277] I wanted her to meet Jerry and I wanted her to meet the Lord because I knew they both would understand.
[time=1289] I knew they both would understand, drawing near with confidence the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and may find grace to help in time of need.
[time=1303] In response to this Hebrews 4 passage, one commentator had this to say, and I quote, "As a human, as one who took on the form of man our Lord experienced personally, to the fullest extent, every hurt, every disappointment, every pain, and every temptation known to man."
[time=1324] There is nothing, absolutely nothing in the fundamental makeup of human struggle, nothing that we face, feel or experience, that in his humanness he didn't face, feel and experience completely and perfectly.
[time=1341] He has been where you have been, he has walked where you have walked, he has wept the tears, the same tears you have cried.
[time=1348] And what it all adds up to, this commentator said, what it all adds up to is it offers a hope like none other and practical direction for everyday life, end quote.
[time=1361] Whatever you may be experiencing, and I know in a room this size with this many people there is a wide variety of experiences going on as I speak.
[time=1373] Whatever trials or challenges have come your way, Hebrews 4 has something to say to both searching seekers and those already convinced.
[time=1384] Absolutely. If you know him this morning, if you've crossed over that line of faith and given your heart and life completely and personally and genuinely to him, then Hebrews 4 says to you this morning, hold on tight.
[time=1400] Hold tight, cling tightly to your confession of faith it says, don't let go.
[time=1408] And to those still considering, to those here this morning, to those listening, still seeking, to you it says this, to you it says look what you're living without.
[time=1425] Look what you're living without. No mercy, no understanding, no help in time of need.
[time=1433] And in the end you too run the risk of sliding down a wall wailing from your gut with no one to identify, no mercy and no one to help.
[time=1443] One of the many gifts people, one of the many gifts we receive when we open the gift of Christ is that He completely and thoroughly and always understands.
[time=1458] There is not one single experience in your life, there is not one single feeling in your gut, there is nothing that you encounter in the day to day of life that He doesn't thoroughly and completely.
[time=1472] To an extent that you nor I can even be aware of, there isn't anything that He doesn't thoroughly and totally understand.
[time=1483] Well let's look more closely, what do you say? Let's look more closely at this whole idea, this great truth of His understanding.
[time=1489] In what ways does He understand? How does He exercise His understanding?
[time=1494] We're going to see three things this morning, three things about the understanding of our Lord.
[time=1499] Number one, write it down, He is sympathetic.
[time=1503] Number one, He is sympathetic.
[time=1508] He became our sympathizer because He too, listen now, think about this and this is not exhaustive by any means, it just kind of gives you an idea.
[time=1518] Sometimes we just kind of glaze over this. He understands. Well, don't forget. Don't forget he too was hungry.
[time=1525] He was thirsty. He was overcome with fatigue. He slept. He was taught. He grew. He came home late from friends' houses.
[time=1535] His voice changed. He got sore throats. He had friends let him down. He loved. He was astonished. He was glad. He was angry.
[time=1543] He was indignant. He was grieved. He was troubled. He was overcome by future events. He exercised faith.
[time=1550] He read the Scriptures. He prayed. He sighed in his heart when he saw another man in illness and he cried when his heart ached.
[time=1557] Jesus felt everything we will ever feel and more.
[time=1562] Example. One of the most powerful examples I've ever heard. One of the most insightful examples I've ever read.
[time=1571] And I'll just try and say it to you as succinctly as I can. One example, probably the greatest example of him feeling and experience all we will ever feel and more is in the area of temptation.
[time=1585] Think about it. He felt temptation to a degree that we could never possibly experience.
[time=1594] Most of us never know the full degree of resistible temptation simply because we usually succumb long before that degree is reached.
[time=1605] You follow? Kids. Kids. The cookies just came out of the oven. And the whole house smells like chocolate chip and you know there's a big cold glass of milk in the fridge.
[time=1620] And dad is gone and mom's hopping into the shower and she says, "Hey, whatever you do, don't eat any of those cookies."
[time=1627] I said, "I'm talking to more than kids here, aren't I?" Do not eat any of these cookies. They are for later.
[time=1637] And so there you sit, working your little Nintendo thing just, "Oh my goodness." And she's in the shower and he's gone. There's nobody in the house.
[time=1647] And kids? Adults? And I say adults because you guys understand whether it's chocolate chip or whether it's the Internet.
[time=1661] Whether it's chocolate chip or whether it's a juicy conversation going on and somebody's name gets mentioned and you've got some stuff to add about that individual.
[time=1673] It's all the same. Whether it's chocolate chips or gossip, kids, this voice starts going on. Go get the cookie.
[time=1684] She'll never know. And that temptation, right, that temp-to-meter just starts coming up like this. And you're thinking, "No, no, no, I shouldn't do it."
[time=1693] She said, "No. The voice keeps going. Come on. Get the cookie." She's in the shower. You can eat the cookie, drink the milk, brush your teeth and she'll never know.
[time=1702] And boom, you're off. You jump. You bail. You see? You see my point? I mean, we face temptation and we might even knock it down a time or two.
[time=1714] But you and I typically jump off, give in, succumb, way before it ever reaches its full. We've probably never, well, we've never known the full brunt of what the enemy can bring.
[time=1729] He does because he never what? Never sinned. He feels. He has experienced to a level we will never know what it means to face temptation.
[time=1744] And why did he go through that? He did it so that he could become a high priest who could sympathize with our weaknesses and who could come to the aid of those who are tempted.
[time=1755] Ours is not, as one author said, a cosmic God, powerful and indifferent. He knows where we hurt. He knows where we are weak and where we are tempted.
[time=1765] He is the God we rely on for salvation and for sympathy and understanding as well.
[time=1773] Now, if I can just give you briefly, let me give you a little history. Just a brief little look, okay? Back into history.
[time=1781] I want you to see in sense how huge, how enormous this truth was to those who would read this, to those who would be exposed to this back in the times of the New Testament.
[time=1795] I want you to also sense, obviously, how huge, how enormous it is today. But watch this. This whole idea of him being a sympathetic understanding savior to those who would have first read this.
[time=1808] It was astonishing. William Barkley helps us out here. He notes that this notion of a sympathetic savior was a new idea, a completely new idea.
[time=1820] You see, now, follow me. To the Jew, there were some people involved in the culture at that time. To the Jew, the basic idea of God was that he was holy in the sense of being different and separated.
[time=1833] In no sense that he shared our human experience and was, in fact, incapable, they thought, and they believed, incapable of sharing it just because he was God.
[time=1847] It was even more so with the Greeks. You had the Jews and you had the Greeks, the Stoics, the highest level of thinkers among the Greek intellectuals.
[time=1857] The Stoics said the primary attribute of God was apothea, by which they meant essentially an inability to feel anything at all.
[time=1867] They argued this, that if a person could feel sorrow or joy, it means that some other person was able to influence them.
[time=1875] If so, that other person must at least, then for that moment, have been greater than he.
[time=1881] No one, therefore, must be able in any sense to affect God for that would be to make him greater than God.
[time=1889] And so God had to be completely beyond all feeling.
[time=1895] The other school of Greek thought was the Epicureans. You had the Jews, you had the Stoics, and you had the Epicureans.
[time=1901] And they held that God's lived in perfect happiness and blessedness.
[time=1906] They lived in what they called the inner Mundia, the spaces between the worlds.
[time=1911] They lived out in, they lived out in nowhere. And they were not even aware, not even aware, not even cognizant.
[time=1918] The Epicureans believed they had no clue, nor did they care to have a clue as to what was going on in everyday life.
[time=1928] The Jews had their different God, the Stoics had their feelingless God and the Epicureans, their detached God.
[time=1938] And into that, into that world of thought, and into that philosophy comes our Lord Jesus Christ,
[time=1950] who is a sympathetic, merciful, loving, all-knowing, understanding Lord.
[time=1960] For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who has been tempted in all things as we are yet without sin.
[time=1968] When your heart aches, people, so does his, every time.
[time=1973] When your mind is under siege, so is his. You and I are never once for a moment alone as we face fear, calamity, or uncertainty.
[time=1981] He enters into our struggle, our suffering, and our pain.
[time=1985] The true story told by James Draper of Dr. Orlando P. Scott may help us to see how our Lord enters in to our suffering.
[time=1995] In the year 1919, Draper says Dr. Scott was the doctor on duty in a hospital where his wife was a patient.
[time=2003] She had been involved in a tragic accident while he was the only available physician she needed immediate skin grafting to save her life.
[time=2013] Without anesthesia, he stood and cut flesh from his own body to graft it into the body of his wife.
[time=2020] He did so without noticeable pain because, as some said, he was under anesthesia from above.
[time=2027] He was under the power of love, and he suffered with her as he operated under his loving anesthetic.
[time=2035] That is exactly, and that is exactly what our God does for us.
[time=2042] We are never alone. He is always there, perfectly connected to that which we experience.
[time=2049] Number two, he's merciful. He is a sympathetic Savior. He is also merciful.
[time=2057] Verse 16 calls us to draw near with confidence.
[time=2062] To draw near in times of need, it says to the throne of grace.
[time=2068] Grace, the New Testament word there in that passage meaning unmerited favor.
[time=2074] To draw near to the throne of unmerited favor that we might receive mercy.
[time=2080] Now, does it say that we are to come with confidence before the throne of the law?
[time=2087] No. No, it doesn't. 1 Corinthians 11 tells us that there is a new covenant.
[time=2095] And this is a new dispensation. It is not about the law anymore.
[time=2100] No, Christ has come. It is a new day. Does it say come with confidence before the throne of holiness or righteousness?
[time=2109] No, because we know it says in Romans 3 that left alone, left to himself.
[time=2113] There is none that are righteous. No, not even one.
[time=2117] You and I know that if we attempted in and of ourselves to approach thrones of the law or thrones of holiness and righteousness, we would lose.
[time=2126] But those aren't the thrones we are called to approach.
[time=2129] Praise God. He says, then Hebrews 4, that his is the throne of grace.
[time=2137] He offers you and he offers me as we come and as we live in relationship with him, this throne of grace where mercy is dispensed.
[time=2145] We are to do the drawing near. He is the one that dispenses.
[time=2149] He is the one that gives freely mercy.
[time=2152] Mercy. Mercy. Define mercy for me in your own mind right now.
[time=2157] Mercy. What is mercy? What is mercy?
[time=2160] You exercise mercy when you what?
[time=2163] You show mercy when you are willing to what?
[time=2167] I looked it up this week. The basic word I know, the meaning though, is so enlightening.
[time=2172] It paints such clear pictures for you and for me.
[time=2177] Whatever stage of life I think mercy is a word that we can identify with.
[time=2181] Where I looked it said this, the tenderness of heart.
[time=2185] Let's stop right there.
[time=2189] It tells you and I right there that mercy has to do with the state of one's heart.
[time=2194] It says the tenderness of heart that overlooks an offense and the treating of the offender.
[time=2204] It is the treating of the offender better than he or she deserves.
[time=2208] Mercy is to withhold or lessen one's appropriate punishment.
[time=2213] Punishment that was due. Punishment that should have been delivered is withheld or lessened
[time=2219] because of the tenderness in the heart of the individual.
[time=2225] Now why? Just ask the question. Why? Why does he extend mercy?
[time=2231] Why is he so willing to have with you and me such a tender heart that is so willing time and time again to overlook the offense and grant us mercy?
[time=2241] Grace on merited favor. Why? Because he understands.
[time=2248] Because he understands. He has been there.
[time=2252] Read this week about the Japanese missionary John Foster, an intriguing story of his life and his ministry and his family.
[time=2261] And in that story there is a section there where it talks about the day when back in the states,
[time=2268] back in the states a couple of years removed from their extended stay in Japan.
[time=2273] John Foster walked into the front door of his living room to find his daughter crying in tears as she listened to the radio. She had heard you see on the radio that morning that 50,000 troops and tanks
[time=2284] had entered Canton. And tears flowed.
[time=2289] Tanks, troops entering a city to most. It was no big deal to her.
[time=2294] It was heartbreaking. To her it was devastating news.
[time=2298] You see she was born in Canton, grew up there. Canton meant to her a house, a school,
[time=2304] teachers, friends, even a dog she had left behind.
[time=2308] The difference was that she had been there.
[time=2311] The difference was that she had experienced it. When you have been there, it makes all the difference.
[time=2316] And there is no part of human experience of which the Lord cannot say, "I have been there."
[time=2323] When we have a sad story to tell, tragedy to walk through.
[time=2328] When life has covered us with tears, we do not go to a God who is incapable of understanding what has happened.
[time=2335] We don't go to a statue. We don't go to another human being. We don't go to a mosque.
[time=2340] We don't go to a picture. We don't go to a candle. No, we go to a personal God who has been there.
[time=2348] Experienced it, felt it.
[time=2352] That is why if we may put it so, he says, "God finds it so easy to forgive."
[time=2361] He is sympathetic. He is merciful.
[time=2364] On a third and very important point, we need to make this morning is that in this passage here in Hebrews 4, number 3, he offers direction.
[time=2372] He understands. He is sympathetic. He is merciful. And lastly this morning, he offers direction.
[time=2380] In your time of need, whatever it might be, whatever it might look like,
[time=2386] whatever it might entail, in your time of need and in mind, a God-honoring path has been paved.
[time=2393] Because he came and because he lived and because he chose what he chose,
[time=2399] a path has been paved. Our Lord in essence says, "I've been there.
[time=2406] I've faced that and I chose this." Been there. Faced that chose this.
[time=2417] And in choosing this, I've paved a path, a road for you to walk.
[time=2423] And I love you so much. I've given it to you.
[time=2426] It's right here, the truth of God's Word.
[time=2429] Please remember this.
[time=2432] Searching seeker already convinced whoever you are this morning.
[time=2437] Please remember it doesn't matter what you encounter.
[time=2442] There is always a choice that you can make.
[time=2445] There is always a path through the temptation that he will help you walk.
[time=2451] Sin is never the right option.
[time=2456] Ever. Ever.
[time=2459] Sin is never the right choice.
[time=2462] There is always a path for you to walk.
[time=2465] It might be a challenging one to get to.
[time=2469] It may be a difficult one to endure, but there is always a road because he came
[time=2475] like he came, lived like he lived, and is today who he is and gives us what he gave us. There is a path for you and I to walk.
[time=2485] Years ago, I had a friend sit me down.
[time=2488] A good friend who I loved and loved to this day.
[time=2492] And he sat me down to, in essence, convince me.
[time=2496] I think he wanted my blessing for whatever twisted reason.
[time=2500] He wanted me to sign off on his choice.
[time=2504] You see, he was a believer.
[time=2505] He was one who had, at a point in time, drawn a line in the sand, put a stake in the ground and said, "I will follow Christ." He knew the Lord.
[time=2514] That had been evidenced in his life for many years.
[time=2517] And yet he found himself at this point because of choices that he had made.
[time=2521] He found himself in love with and ready to marry an unbeliever.
[time=2525] Something that God's Word speaks clearly to.
[time=2530] And I remember that day he sat down and began to share with me his bullet point list of reasons why it would really be okay.
[time=2541] Talked about how they had been together for almost five years and their relationship had grown to be a sweet, enjoyable, sacrificing, lovely relationship.
[time=2552] He did talk about how there had been some levels of physical involvement that he could never, you know, dream of now being with someone else and never wanted to, in any way, shape or form, do that.
[time=2564] So because of the involvement, because of the relationship and how far it had gone, he talked about their families being so very close.
[time=2573] Families had over five years begun to love and care for and respect each other.
[time=2580] And then he threw this last one and his uncle had just bought a house for them.
[time=2585] An uncle had just bought a house.
[time=2589] Free gift here, take it.
[time=2593] So he looked at me and said, "You know what, Kelly? It just makes sense." It just makes sense. And I told him, "I don't care how much sense it makes to you.
[time=2602] I mean, I do care. I care how you feel and I care what you're going through.
[time=2605] But I don't care how much sense it makes to you or me." In God's eyes, it's foolish and sinful to marry someone who doesn't share your personal commitment to Christ.
[time=2617] There's another choice.
[time=2620] He didn't want to hear that.
[time=2622] You don't want to hear that. I don't want to hear that.
[time=2625] When we are determined in our sin, when we are given to our rebellion, we don't want to hear what it says in 1 Corinthians turn there, 1 Corinthians 10.
[time=2639] In our pride and in our rebellion, we don't want to hear what it says in 1 Corinthians 10.
[time=2645] And usually we start at verse 13, but you cannot miss what it says in verse 12.
[time=2652] 1 Corinthians chapter 10 verse 12, "Therefore let him who thinks he stands take heed."
[time=2662] Lest he what? Fall.
[time=2667] I said, "Oh buddy, you've got to look. You've got to look at what it says.
[time=2672] Who do you think you are? Why do you think that somehow this doesn't apply?
[time=2679] Let him who thinks he stands take heed. Lest he fall. Why? Well, hang on.
[time=2684] Because no temptation, better translation of that word here in this text is trial.
[time=2689] No temptation. No challenge. No difficulty has overtaken you or you or you or you or you or anybody in this room.
[time=2699] No trial has overtaken you, but such as is, here's the word, common.
[time=2706] Common to man. Common.
[time=2709] This friend of mine was giving me his list of reasons why he had been deceived
[time=2716] to believing his experience, his situation was uncommon.
[time=2721] This was somehow an exception.
[time=2724] And he thought that and you think that and I think that when we get that far into our sin.
[time=2729] No temptation has overtaken you, but such as is common to man.
[time=2732] And what does it say? And God is faithful who will not allow you to be tempted
[time=2738] or faced with that which is beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also that you and me and anyone in this room and my friend so that we might be able to endure it.
[time=2755] He will give you a way of escape problem there.
[time=2758] Problem for you and I is so many times we read it and we think okay, well it's been two weeks.
[time=2765] Where's the way of escape? It just keeps getting harder.
[time=2769] It just keeps getting more and more painful and I keep doing my best to be obedient.
[time=2773] Where's the way of escape?
[time=2778] And all I can say to that and all you can say to that and all we can collectively say to that is you know what sometimes it gets harder and sometimes it gets more painful.
[time=2785] And if we endure, James 1 says that we are building and having character and faith grown in us.
[time=2792] And his way of escape will come and it may come in two weeks or it may come in two years, but sin is never the option.
[time=2801] It's not how it works.
[time=2803] There is no predicament, no trial that can come your way that would be so complicated or messy that your spiritual capacities, your spiritual resources, that which God has given you to endure with.
[time=2816] What are they? The Word of God and the Spirit of God and the people of God.
[time=2821] No situation that those three things can't handle and strengthen you to endure.
[time=2829] No situation.
[time=2831] Now, the obvious is true, honoring God in the midst of trial.
[time=2836] You relying on your sympathetic Lord who is willing to walk you down this road called trust and obey.
[time=2841] It may cost you some things.
[time=2844] Don't miss this, please. It may cost you. It may cost me.
[time=2848] It has in the past. It will in the future. It may cost you something to endure.
[time=2858] There's a chance you may have to endure a heartache, right?
[time=2864] I mean, is there a chance that you may have to endure a heartache?
[time=2867] Yes, guess what? He'll do it with you.
[time=2870] Is there a chance that you may have to break up?
[time=2874] A chance that you may have to end the relationship in order to do what is right.
[time=2879] Yeah, there's a chance you may have to. Guess what? He'll do it with you.
[time=2882] Is there a chance that you may have to move out?
[time=2885] Yes, he'll do it with you. Is there a chance that you may need to keep the baby?
[time=2892] Yes, and he'll do it with you.
[time=2895] Is there a chance that you may have to in your attempt to honor God and pursue repentance, spend less and save more? Yes. And he'll do it with you, eat less and jog more.
[time=2905] Yes, he'll do it with you. Talk less and listen more.
[time=2909] Yes, there's a chance you may have to do that and he will do all the above with you.
[time=2915] Why? Because he understands.
[time=2919] Because he knows what it's like to face what you face. He knows what it's like to live what you live.
[time=2925] He understands. He's sympathetic. He's merciful.
[time=2930] And in his very life, because he was who he was and lived as he lived and gave us what he gave us, he provides direction and hope.
[time=2938] Some truth to take home. A couple of things I want to just run by you.
[time=2942] Got a couple of minutes. Jot these down. Make sure you talk about these things.
[time=2946] Make sure you discuss these things as a family, as a couple.
[time=2950] Bring them up with your small group. Some truth to take home. Number one, please realize this, people.
[time=2957] Just before we go here this morning, realize this. In his sympathetic merciful, I'll go down that road with you approach. Please don't miss the fact that he models for you and I,
[time=2967] how to respond, for you and I, how to respond to those who come to you in time of need.
[time=2976] Everyday people, friends, husbands, wives, kids, children, everyday folks approach each other, hurting and confused and in need of encouragement.
[time=2987] How would you be described by those who have come to you?
[time=2993] Recently, how would you be described by those who have come to you in their moment of need?
[time=2999] Would we hear words like gentle? Would we hear words like sympathetic, tender, merciful, graceful,
[time=3007] ready to empathize? Are you one they approach in time of need?
[time=3013] Or would they describe you as rigid in tone and demeanor, kind of off at a distance,
[time=3019] offering exhorting, challenging words meant to change behavior rather than a patient willingness
[time=3027] to minister to a hurting heart, which is why they came to you in the first place?
[time=3034] How are you doing? And I realize the standard we've set this morning is perfection, so I'm not asking you to gauge yourself in a sense are you, are you just like him, but is there a sense in your heart and life where we're trying to move in that direction?
[time=3048] You and I not being an essence, sympathetic saviors, but sympathetic friends, showing sympathy, having the mercy, offering direction to follow, notice the offering of direction to follow was the third thing, guys. Third thing, so many times I think as men we want to give
[time=3066] the direction to follow first, oftentimes leaving hurting lonely hearts that would have much
[time=3072] rather been sympathized with, extended some mercy to, and then maybe later down the road
[time=3080] having a discussion about what she should do or where she should go or how this should happen.
[time=3086] Number one, truth to take home, don't forget the model that he gives for us here as we interact with hurting people. How are you? How is your heart? How is your approach?
[time=3098] Second thing is, and we've already alluded to it. I think pretty strongly, so I don't think this is new, but I wrote it down just one last time, understand this. His understanding
[time=3109] people, his tender care, his mercy and grace in time of need is for all, is for all people,
[time=3119] and all situations. There is nothing too ugly or awful for him. You with all of your issues,
[time=3127] you with all of your struggles, you with all of your failures, you in this predicament
[time=3133] that you have found yourself in, please remember this morning and as you go from this place,
[time=3139] there are no exceptions. You are not an exception, your situation, no matter what it might be.
[time=3150] His grace and his mercy, his understanding, his sympathy, his direction is there for you
[time=3158] to embrace and to know and to follow. So many times I come across situations where a couple
[time=3166] or an individual are convinced that their situation regardless of what God's word says is unique.
[time=3174] Somehow their situation is outside the scope. It's not. His understanding is there for you.
[time=3187] And let me close if I can by just saying this. I mean, just personally, from me to you, all
[time=3193] of you, any of you. Yeah, I mean, you may have an idea. I mean, if you know me, you may have
[time=3200] a pretty good idea of how much as I've experienced what I've experienced in my own life, as I've
[time=3207] gone through and faced the situations and circumstances that God has led me through from a young boy
[time=3213] to a man today. I mean, if you understand any of that, you know how unbelievably thankful I am
[time=3220] for his ongoing and perfect understanding. You like me, if you know him, you know what it's
[time=3227] like to face dark days and lonely times in confusing situations and a heartache and gut wrenching
[time=3234] stuff that in the moment makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. You know what it's like as do I.
[time=3241] If you know him, what it's like to be held in that fashion, to be loved in that manner.
[time=3250] And so I would just say to anybody here this morning who doesn't. And if you don't know him,
[time=3256] and if you haven't crossed over that line of faith and drawn a line in the sand and put a stake in the ground and saying, you know what, I want to follow Christ. I want him to be my Lord and Savior. I want to offer him everything I have to offer. I want him to forgive me of my sins. If you haven't done that, then this morning you sit here and you don't know what it's like
[time=3277] to be understood that way, to be loved and cared for that way. You haven't tasted of his
[time=3283] sympathy and mercy and life-giving direction. And I would love for you too. We would love for
[time=3290] you too. We want, that is our prayer and our hope, that you would know and experience that.
[time=3295] And so I would just leave it with you this morning to please. If there's someone in your life you can talk to about that. If there's a chance that you might come down this morning afterwards, then just ask a few questions that might give us the chance to dialogue more about that with you.
[time=3309] I wish you would. If you came with someone, ask them about it later. If there's someone here in this family who you know and trust, engage them in a discussion about that which is on your heart this morning, please. I would love, we would love nothing more than you to be able to
[time=3325] enter into the next couple of weeks with all that it means and all that it really represents.
[time=3331] Knowing in your heart, knowing in your own life what it means to be in relationship with the
[time=3338] King of Kings and the Lord of Lords who came in a common way, in common fashion, so that we
[time=3346] might have life and hope and forgiveness. Amen? Amen.
[time=3353] Why don't you stand? Let's close in a word of prayer.
[time=3363] Father, it has been sweet and encouraging. Father, it has been reminding each of us, given the
[time=3373] opportunity this morning to be reminded of what it means and what it looks like to be in
[time=3381] relationship with you. Father, we thank you that you are a sympathetic high priest and you have our
[time=3389] interest and our hearts and our lives and our paths at heart. You care for us and you call
[time=3396] us to come to you, to approach your throne of grace for help and time of need and God this
[time=3403] morning we do that. There are so many things at play here in this room today. It would boggle the mind somehow we could see and see clearly the issues that are racing through the
[time=3415] hearts and lives of people in this very room right now. There are so many of us who need
[time=3422] that grace, so many of us who need that sympathetic understanding, so many of us in this room,
[time=3428] who need clear direction, clear understanding and insight into that path, Lord, that you
[time=3435] have paved. And those of us, Father, that know you this morning, we come to you with humble
[time=3442] hearts and we say, oh God please, move us down that road, embrace us, remind us again of who
[time=3449] you are, lead us toward repentance, do your work, do whatever you might have to do to remind
[time=3455] us and call us to the road, Lord, that you have walked down yourself and we thank you collectively for your willingness to walk it with us. And again, Father, we pray for those
[time=3467] who continue to see, can search, continue to ask questions, questions that really matter.
[time=3474] And our prayer is that you would in the way that only you can, Lord, that you would draw them to yourself and that in whatever way possible we might be of somehow for assistance.
[time=3485] God, all of us, we thank you this morning for your Son and we thank you for the opportunity
[time=3491] that has been ours to be together and we look forward with great anticipation to being together again. In your Son's name we pray. Amen.
