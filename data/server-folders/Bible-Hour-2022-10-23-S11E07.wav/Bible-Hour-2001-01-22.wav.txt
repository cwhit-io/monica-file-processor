[time=10] Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=14] Thank you for joining us. We trust that the music and message from God's word will help you in your Christian walk.
[time=20] Now let's join our service.
[time=22] Come, now is the time to hear your heart.
[time=31] Come, just as you are in worship.
[time=40] Come, just as you are before your God.
[time=49] Come, one day every tug will confess you are come.
[time=57] One day every game will bow.
[time=61] Still the greatest treasure remains for those who gladly choose you now.
[time=72] [MUSIC - 10 seconds]

[time=114] One day every game will bow.
[time=118] Still the greatest treasure remains for those who gladly choose you now.
[time=129] One day every tug will confess you are come.
[time=139] One day every game will bow.
[time=143] Still the greatest treasure remains for those who gladly choose you now.
[time=151] Come, now is the time to hear your heart.
[time=165] Come, just as you are in worship.
[time=173] Come, just as you are before your God.
[time=184] Come, come, come.
[time=197] [MUSIC]
[time=205] Hey let me ask you if you would why don't you stand with me.
[time=208] And at the conclusion of our singing time, which this is kind of it.
[time=217] And a lot of times I think even in my own mind, I won't even speak for you.
[time=221] But sometimes even as we program the morning and think it through, we catch ourselves feeling like that's the end of our worship time.
[time=230] And it's just a great reminder I think I know for me personally, and I hope for the rest of our family here as well, that you know, worship isn't confined to 20 minutes of singing.
[time=241] Worship is something that is to happen in all that we do.
[time=245] Worship is something we get to experience in the whole of these 70 minutes.
[time=251] But it even goes beyond the 70 minutes, it is to be a constant expression.
[time=256] It is to be a constant mindset.
[time=258] It is to be an attitude that you and I carry with us into Monday and through the week.
[time=264] And what is that expression? What is that mindset? What is that attitude?
[time=268] It's an unbelievable sense of who he is as he shows us himself
[time=274] and the things that he does in the way that he loves us and the way that he weaves his hand and in through our lives.
[time=282] It's an unbelievable sense of his grace and mercy.
[time=284] It's an amazing sense of who he is and who we are, your desperate need for him and mine.
[time=292] As we try to raise kids, as we try to work at our job, as we try to exercise self-control in life as we do everything.
[time=301] There is that sense of who he is and who we are.
[time=305] And as we say that to him and as we think that and as we articulate, that's our worship.
[time=313] And even here in these next few minutes, we're going to have the privilege.
[time=317] And it is a privilege, not because it's me, but because it's this.
[time=320] We get every week the privilege of opening up this book.
[time=324] And that is worship. That is worship.
[time=327] The way you do that, the way I do that, the way collectively we give ourselves to those 40 minutes.
[time=333] And so although we've already sung, although some songs have gone by now just as well as 20 minutes ago, now is the time to worship.
[time=343] Now is the time for us to make our hearts right before him and open up our hearts and minds to what his truth has to say.
[time=350] And so sing it again and sing it from your heart because it is time to worship as we open up the Word of God.
[time=359] And sing it with us.
[time=363] Come.
[time=365] Now is the time to worship.
[time=373] Come.
[time=375] Now is the time to give your heart.
[time=383] Come just as you are to worship.
[time=393] Come just as you are before your God.
[time=403] Come.
[time=431] Father, we come before you this morning and we come father with hearts that are open.
[time=439] Hearts that are open and hearts that are troubled.
[time=443] Hearts that have faced good times in encouraging events in the last six days.
[time=451] And other hearts.
[time=453] Father that have faced trial and difficulty, even tragedy.
[time=460] And so God we know that as we come before you this morning and whatever condition our heart is in, we know that your love for us is such.
[time=469] Your desire to be in relationship with us is such.
[time=473] And your hope that we would learn from and be encouraged by you here in this time is such.
[time=479] That you take us and you throw your arms around troubled and encouraged hearts all at once.
[time=487] And you say come.
[time=489] And so we're here.
[time=491] And we're here reminded even already this morning of how grateful we are for you.
[time=495] And Keith read from Psalm 145.
[time=499] We're grateful for your righteousness and we're grateful for your majesty.
[time=504] And we're grateful for all that you do and all that you are.
[time=507] And we hope our attempt to sing that to you and say that to you this morning has been pleasing to your ear.
[time=514] God as we give ourselves to the study of your word and as we open our hearts and lives to that which you would have for us.
[time=520] We pray that you would grow us and teach us, convict us and show us the things we need to see.
[time=525] And give us strength and courage and boldness to respond in ways that would honor you.
[time=531] In your son's name we pray. Amen.
[time=544] [MUSIC]
[time=562] When Miss Waltz and I came together to start the school, what we determined we would do is take the best of what we knew in the public school
[time=572] and incorporate that into what we at that time decided a Christian school should be.
[time=579] [MUSIC]
[time=586] And so our mission was to be able to bring the gospel to the students and to parents and be able to share the word of God every day.
[time=599] Well I think that the faculty is really concerned that the children leave us and go out into the world well prepared for college if that's where they're headed and then later into their different careers.
[time=611] [MUSIC]
[time=615] We're really here to introduce kids to Christ and help them grow in Him and learn to live a life pleasing to God.
[time=624] [MUSIC]
[time=628] I feel prepared to go out into the world.
[time=631] I think I have a good grasp of the values and the subject material like the normal classes of what I need to know.
[time=642] [MUSIC]
[time=648] It helps you see the truths that are in the Word and I think it helps give you a biblical understanding, a solid ground to look back on.
[time=658] [MUSIC]
[time=660] Find out more and more what kids are capable of especially in the spiritual realm and just the impressions you can make on them are incredible.
[time=669] And it's so much fun. I think that's just the most fun part about my job is just being able to just touch them spiritually.
[time=677] [MUSIC]
[time=682] The academics are great but they're not as fun as being able to touch a kid spiritually.
[time=688] [MUSIC]
[time=689] Blackout Christian School just culminated a 10 year plan that we started in 1988 that we didn't really finish until 12 years later in the year 2000.
[time=701] And we double tracked our school.
[time=706] [MUSIC]
[time=708] What are we going to do for the next 10 years? We are going to try to conserve what we've done well in the last 27 years and then improve upon that and do whatever we can to help families hang on to the values that we're trying to teach here every single day.
[time=727] [MUSIC]
[time=747] And open your Bibles if you would to Acts. Acts chapter 9. I want to say thanks again to Steve for doing such a great job last week.
[time=758] Carried up his own pulpit and all what a guy. I think he said I was 6'7" 245" which is a really really nice thing to say on the whole weight side of that.
[time=769] So I want to thank him. You know what too? I also want to say we need to pray. We'll do that when we conclude today.
[time=776] But we need to keep our good friend Scott Schindler in our prayers.
[time=780] As many of you may notice he wasn't here this morning in Scott's right in the midst of dealing with some amazing medical health situations with his parents and especially his dad right now with a mass in his head that seems to be growing and causing some other complications.
[time=799] And so Scott is with his family and dealing with his dad and tomorrow I think or tonight there's going to be some surgery done.
[time=806] So pray for Scott. Pray for his family. Pray for he and his sister as they do their very best to love and care for their folks.
[time=813] And we'll keep them in our prayers and we'll keep you posted as well as to how things are going.
[time=819] Acts chapter 9, Saul's journey. What a journey this is too. Steve last week shared with you and taught us and got us familiar with the fact that an amazing thing happened.
[time=832] Saul, the murdering, torturing persecutor of the church comes to faith in Christ. And his journey begins. Saul's journey today, Saul's journey from honeymoon to hiding.
[time=844] Somebody once wrote when Saul put his lips to the cup of life that Christ offered. His thirsty soul yearned no more.
[time=854] Maybe some of you here this morning can remember what it was like to yearn and what it was like to long for peace and purpose and forgiveness in life.
[time=866] Maybe you can identify with that just that simple phrase when Saul put his lips to the cup of life that Christ offered. His thirsty soul yearned no more.
[time=875] At that moment, peace soothed his tortured mind. He had become a Christian. He had become a follower of Christ.
[time=884] Saul's first few days following his conversion must have been rapturous. Many of us have experienced this phase as new believers. Having left the old self behind, the Holy Spirit's tide washes us out onto a blissful sea, this is beautiful.
[time=901] We say, "Oh my goodness." We say, "This is amazing." As we bob along soaking in the pleasures of God, then the lacy clouds darken and the seas begin to swell.
[time=920] In this second phase, disillusionment crashes like a thunderstorm, trouble strike like lightning and just holding on becomes our top priority. This is difficult.
[time=930] We say, "This is difficult." We sputter, wiping the rain from our eyes. Then we enter the third phase. What was a wind is now a hurricane.
[time=946] It is a hurricane of hardship that blows our way, splintering our little boat tossing us into the spewing sea, flailing against doubt and despair. We wail. This is impossible.
[time=961] I can't do this. God, I can't endure this. This is beautiful. Wow. This is getting kind of difficult. God, what's going on here?
[time=983] I can't handle this. God, this is impossible. You've seen it. You've experienced it. More than likely if you know him this morning, you've been through it.
[time=997] And if you have sailed into this third phase, you are not alone. Saul endured hurricanes as well. In fact, we'll observe Saul's journey through all three phases as we look again this morning at Acts 9.
[time=1010] We'll see what Saul experienced as he began to and continued to follow Christ.
[time=1015] And here's the thing, I want to make sure you don't lose sight of, because as we look at and study the events of this man's life and you realize, as I realize, who this man was at this point and who he was about to come.
[time=1029] I mean, he was about to come the man most used of God in comparison to any other person in all of human history, the man who God used to grow and establish his church.
[time=1040] And what you've got to remind yourself of is that man's experience in these early days is no different than your experience or mine.
[time=1048] It is a similar experience. And as he goes through it and as we learn and watch him go through it, there are things for you to see and there are things for me to notice and there is stuff there for you and I to learn and take note of.
[time=1064] So what kind of progression do we see? What did Saul's journey with God look like? Let's start with how it began.
[time=1073] Number one, we're going to start with how it began and there we see the joy, the joy of salvation.
[time=1079] The joy of salvation started out great. Go to Acts 9, go back to verse 17.
[time=1085] You there? Acts 9, 17. There it says this, "An ananias departed and entered the house and after laying his hands on him, Saul said, "Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road by which you were coming has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit."
[time=1102] And immediately, verse 18, there fell from his eyes something like scales and he regained his sight and he arose and was baptized and he took food and was strengthened.
[time=1114] Now for several days he was with the disciples who were at Damascus and immediately he began to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues saying he is the Son of God.
[time=1128] And all those hearing him continued to be amazed and we're saying is this not he who in Jerusalem destroyed those who called on this name and who had come here for the purpose of bringing them bound before the chief priests.
[time=1142] But Saul kept increasing in strength and confounding the Jews who lived at Damascus by proving that this Jesus is the Christ.
[time=1151] He is out of the gate strong people. He is on a roll. There is a new attitude. There is a new message. He is a new man.
[time=1159] For Saul conversion to Christianity was dramatic as it may have been for some of you here this morning.
[time=1167] His was dramatic. It was unbelievable. A sudden burst of light. A voice from heaven. Blindness and a miraculous healing highlighted the three days that forever changed his life.
[time=1178] Equally exciting. We see where his next few days as a new believer. Saul enjoyed it says there in the text that we just read. Saul enjoyed close fellowship.
[time=1189] He had a new family. He had new friends. There was a new sense of camaraderie in his life. He enjoyed close fellowship with the believers in Damascus.
[time=1198] The ones he had intended to persecute. Fully accepted by them. Saul received affirmation and support. Maybe you experienced affirmation and support.
[time=1209] Maybe you experienced the new circle of friends a community of people that you now could connect with.
[time=1215] As a result of all of that he felt secure enough to openly share his faith. To talk about the Lord and his changed heart.
[time=1223] And as he lived and shared his new faith what response from others did he bump into. Maybe the same response that you bumped into.
[time=1231] As you initially had come to faith in Christ. Look at verse 21 says in all those hearing him continued to be amazed.
[time=1238] And we're saying is this not he who in Jerusalem destroyed those who called on this name. People they were absolutely astonished.
[time=1246] They were so very thankful. The text says they were amazed. That word in the Greek is the same word from which we get our word ecstasy.
[time=1254] They were ecstatic. They were thrilled for him. They were so glad that he had experienced life changing faith.
[time=1265] I don't know what it was like for you. But I can tell you what it was like for me when I came to faith in Christ.
[time=1270] When I drew that line and put a stake in the ground and said I believe and I'm giving him my life.
[time=1276] There was a wonderful sense of all the above. People were excited for me. There was a newfound purpose in life.
[time=1284] Sweet fellowship. New found courage. Enormous support. A new heart. A new attitude. A new mindset.
[time=1291] It was the same thing for Paul. And what had been exciting. And what had been encouraging.
[time=1298] And what had been thrilling to his soul soon became challenging. Even painful.
[time=1305] And you know what it's as if God said to Saul and he says to you and me as well I think.
[time=1311] And I can kind of think back in my mind. I can almost see the day that I envision him having this conversation with me.
[time=1322] And he's had the same conversation with me many times since. And maybe you can think back to those early days because there comes a time in everyone's journey.
[time=1332] We're having come to faith and having experienced all of the joy and excitement that comes with it.
[time=1338] It seems as if there is a time when he kind of does this to you.
[time=1344] And I know he did this to me. He kind of pulls you aside and says hey come here.
[time=1347] I mean he doesn't say this but it's kind of what it feels like. He's saying.
[time=1352] Come here. He says. And he kind of pulls you aside and he says hey you're with me now aren't you.
[time=1359] You're saved. You've placed your faith in me and you and I go absolutely.
[time=1365] That's the greatest thing in the world and I'm so excited.
[time=1368] Thank you for what you did. Thank you for my new life. Thank you for my new perspective.
[time=1372] It's just great. What do you want? He says well I just want to let you know I'm going to need to.
[time=1378] I'm going to need to ask you to do something now in these next few weeks and these next few months.
[time=1384] Maybe even these next few years. What's that you say? You name it. I'm in. It's just great.
[time=1392] And he looks at you with kind of a kind of a real stern loving serious look and says I'm going to have to ask you one thing and that is to hang on.
[time=1403] I'm going to have to ask you to hang on and hang on tight because you're right he says I love you so much.
[time=1412] I care about you so greatly that and because I love you so much I'm going to have to I'm going to have to grow you now.
[time=1419] Your salvation is wonderful. He says and I bask in that with you but now it is time for you. He says to grow.
[time=1425] Now it is time for you to mature. Now it is time for you to begin to better understand what it means to really follow me in every avenue, in every compartment, in every phase of your life.
[time=1438] Time to exercise. He says spiritual muscles you never knew you had. He said it to Paul, to Saul, excuse me.
[time=1449] And he says it to you and he says it to me. And that is exactly where he let him. It is exactly what we now see happening as this story unfolds.
[time=1460] The joy of salvation turns into the pain of growth. And he says to Saul, hang on. And he says to you and I, hold on tight because I'm going to grow you.
[time=1472] Look at verse 23. The pain of growth, verse 23, just the first six words and when many days had elapsed.
[time=1485] Okay stop there. This is really interesting. I mean this is, I mean for me it was and I hope it is for you this morning. This is really interesting stuff.
[time=1496] Because in those six words as you study the scriptures and as you learn and see Saul soon to be Paul's story unfold, you realize something.
[time=1507] You stand back and you go wait a minute Luke. Luke you kind of skimmed over something here and somebody will ask Luke why he did that.
[time=1515] I mean obviously he did it because he was led of God as he wrote but there's a story people. And I don't know if you ever knew that.
[time=1521] But there is a story right there in those six words. And it is elsewhere other than the book of Acts and this is the beauty of God's Word.
[time=1530] As you watch the scriptures kind of tie together and paint pictures you never knew were there.
[time=1535] The beauty is that Luke kind of skims over this but elsewhere we learn and realize that these six words here in Acts 9 23 in fact represent a lengthy period of time.
[time=1546] A lengthy catch this. A lengthy period of training. A lengthy period of preparation experienced in isolation and solitude.
[time=1557] That's right look at Galatians. Flip back two, three, four books. Keep going back in your New Testament to Galatians chapter one.
[time=1565] It is here as Paul writes to the church at Galatia later that he expounds on and we get a better picture of what exactly happened.
[time=1573] In the phrase in the span of time represented by those six words. Look at the first chapter of Galatians.
[time=1581] Galatians chapter one verses 15 down through about 18. Watch this. Paul writing says this.
[time=1589] But when he who had set me apart even from my mother's womb and called me through his grace was pleased to reveal his son and me that I might preach him among the Gentiles.
[time=1601] I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me but here you go.
[time=1610] But I went away to Arabia. It says I went away to Arabia and returned once more to Damascus.
[time=1621] Then what's the first phrase in your Bible say verse 18? Then what? How long? Three years later. Now granted it says three years later I went up to Jerusalem.
[time=1635] And we're not quite sure when he went back to Damascus. It's not really clear but what is clearly indicated is that some time was spent, not with people.
[time=1645] Some time was spent, not preaching the word. Some time was spent, not impacting the Gentile world.
[time=1651] Some time was spent with this man who had come to faith in Christ and experienced enormous excitement and joy at the outset.
[time=1659] And now it says here in Galatians God sends him to the desert. God sends him to the desert.
[time=1670] Paul lets us know that God's plan for him was such that he did with Saul what he does with you and I so many times.
[time=1678] He takes us to the desert. He takes our hand. He looks us in the eyes and says I need to prepare you more.
[time=1687] There's more to learn. There is more to face. There is more to see. There is more to endure.
[time=1694] Hang on. Hang on to me. I am taking you someplace. It will not be. It will not be a lot of fun.
[time=1702] It will not be rapturous and blissful. No, it will be painful. It will be challenging. You will be in isolation.
[time=1708] You will be in the desert. And you will experience and feel the things people who are in the desert, isolated and alone feel.
[time=1717] But I've got my hand on you. And this is a process. And I'm growing you up, he says.
[time=1723] And he takes Paul to the desert. You might want to say it. You might want to think it. You might want to give it some thought this way.
[time=1731] There is no growth without pain. There is no growth without pain. There is no maturity without trial. There is no strength without weakness.
[time=1744] There is no authority without humility. Did you catch that? There is no growth without pain. There is no maturity without trial.
[time=1753] In your life and mind, there will never be any strength without a realization of weakness. And there will certainly never be any authority.
[time=1763] In your message, your mind, in your life or mind, in your ministry or mind, there will never be any authority without humility.
[time=1770] How do we know that? Those words that you see there on the screen are simply the product of passages that God has drilled into my heart in life over the years.
[time=1782] And I didn't always think that. I wrote this down a couple of days ago. I didn't always think this. No, no, no.
[time=1792] He drilled into my life and He drilled into my brain and into my experience, 1 Corinthians 9. 1 Corinthians 9 says we are in a race.
[time=1802] And we all run it. And those who win, run in such a way as not without aim, no, they buff their body and make it their slave.
[time=1812] There is a sense in your life and in mind in our journey with Him where prices have to be paid at times, where choices have to be made.
[time=1821] And sometimes those are painful decisions that even physically feel like they're costing us.
[time=1828] But there is a growth that comes with the self-discipline.
[time=1833] There's a joy that comes with that kind of a price that gets paid.
[time=1838] James 1, no maturity without trial? Absolutely. Brethren, James 1, verse 2, consider it all joy.
[time=1844] He says, "When you encounter various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith, knowing that the testing of your faith,
[time=1853] and be that test, whether that comes in the form of a complication with a birth, whether that test comes in the form of a loss of a job,
[time=1865] whether that test comes in the form of a marriage that's crumbling, whether that test, whatever form that test takes,
[time=1873] he says, "Hang on." And no, that as you endure and as you hang on, as you stay with me in the midst of whatever it is,
[time=1883] I bring your way that comes with that a sense of growth. There is no maturity without trial, no strength without weakness.
[time=1890] Look at 1 Corinthians 12, 2 Corinthians 12, no growth without pain, no maturity without trial, no strength in your life
[time=1902] or mine without a realization of our weakness. Look who is the example of this to us. It's Saul himself,
[time=1912] now named Paul, writing to the church at Corinth in 2 Corinthians 12. It says there in verse, let's pick it up in verse 7.
[time=1921] In verse 7 of 2 Corinthians 12, Paul says, "And because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations,
[time=1928] for this reason, to keep me from exalting myself, there was given me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me,
[time=1938] to keep me from exalting myself." We don't know exactly what that was. The best we can tell it was some kind of physical ailment that wouldn't go away.
[time=1948] Concerning this verse 8, "I entreated the Lord three times," he prayed. "Three times," he asked, "Oh, please, God, take this away." God says, "No, I'm going to leave it there."
[time=1959] Paul's thorn in the flesh, and he has said to me, "My grace could catch that. My grace, not relief from your pain."
[time=1970] No, no, no, no. He says, "My grace is sufficient, completely and totally. Absolutely. My grace is sufficient, not relief from your pain.
[time=1982] My grace is sufficient for you. For power," he says, "is perfected in weakness." Paul then jumps back in, most gladly therefore.
[time=1991] "I will rather boast about my weakness that the power of Christ may dwell in me. Therefore I am well content with weaknesses, with insults, with distress, with persecutions, with difficulties, for Christ's sake, for when I am weak, then and only then. Am I strong?"
[time=2013] There is no growth without pain. And in the desert experiences of life people, we get humbled. We get humbled.
[time=2024] You ever been there? Ever experienced that? Ever gotten taken to the woodshed, so to speak? Ever gotten yanked aside and led out to the desert by God to learn lessons and see things about yourself?
[time=2040] You never knew where there are. You knew where there, but you never just had been willing to deal with?
[time=2046] I did. I did, absolutely. I can think back on my life, I can think back on my journey, and I can remember like it was yesterday, this process unfolding in my own life.
[time=2059] I was 22. I was 22 years old. And let me just real briefly, okay? Let me describe to you a little insight into my own journey this morning.
[time=2072] Maybe some can relate, maybe some can be encouraged as I have been, as I've watched God's faithfulness take me through all this.
[time=2078] I was 22 years of age. You know what I was? I was up and coming. I was beginning to be noticed in the spiritual circles and the life that I lived at the age of 22.
[time=2092] In that arena, I was beginning to be noticed. My gifts were blossoming. My reputation was growing. I was speaking more and more, impacting more and more lives, impressing more and more people, 22 years of age, up and coming.
[time=2106] And beneath all of it, guess what I was? Underneath all of the speaking, underneath all of the impact, underneath all of the stuff that people were starting to see, I was grossly lazy.
[time=2121] I was incredibly irresponsible. I was so immature, you would be embarrassed to know me today. It was absolutely ugly.
[time=2135] I never felt powerless, pawns to get things done that I wanted. I never worked the day in my life. Never had to sweat. Never had to figure. My mom got me out of every jam I ever got myself in.
[time=2149] I never knew what it was like to follow through on something. You see, I didn't have to follow through on anything because I was me and my personality and my charisma and my charm.
[time=2159] At 22, I was the biggest primadonna in the world. You would have been embarrassed.
[time=2167] And there was a friend, one of the first friends I ever had, having come to know Christ at the age of 20. There was a friend, God bless him, who loved me enough over those years, those first two years of my journey.
[time=2180] And he was insightful enough, and he was loving enough. And we had become close enough to where he began to, even back two years prior, to say to me the things that we talk about in here sometime.
[time=2191] We talk about telling people the truth and love. And he began to say to me the truth and love. And I didn't listen. Because I'd never listened. I didn't have to listen.
[time=2202] And so I continued on in the air responsibility and the immaturity and the egotism. And so it just so happened that this friend who loved me didn't realize it then, but I certainly saw it later.
[time=2216] He loved me more than anyone had ever loved me and was willing to do something that no one before had ever done. So here's the story.
[time=2224] I happen to work for the friend. And my job covered all of my living expenses and would cover all of my living expenses on through seminary, which I had just started.
[time=2239] I was two months away from getting married to my wife who's with me today. Two months away from the wedding. The job also covered all of my school.
[time=2251] The job covered all of my education. It covered all of my living expenses, allowed me to get married in two months and pay for practically nothing, which is if you're tracking with me, not the kind of life you want to give a selfish, spoiled, irresponsible, grossly immature person.
[time=2268] Who refuses again and again to respond to Godly and wise counsel. So he fired me.
[time=2277] So he sat me down one night and said I know that your job covers your living and I know that your job covers your education.
[time=2284] And I know you've never worked a day in your life and I know you're going to get married in two months. You're fired.
[time=2291] Go on. And that's kind of what it was like. It felt mean and cruel and harsh at the time. But it was a, it was a tears held back.
[time=2301] Go on. Go be who you're going to be. And so I went. I didn't have anywhere to go, but I went. And I called my fiance and that was a very, very difficult conversation.
[time=2318] And realized I needed a job, which I'd never had. I mean, like a real job.
[time=2324] So a friend of mine says, "Hey, you know what? You ought to work construction. Be good for you. Toughing you up, give you some perspective."
[time=2330] So I said, "Hey, fine. Whatever. I just, I'm going to get married in two months. I don't have a place to live. I can't pay for my education.
[time=2336] I was mad. I was bitter. Give me a job." You know, it was kind of like had an attitude.
[time=2340] So he says, "Well, you go down to this work site. They're going to, they're building condos right down the road from where you live.
[time=2344] Just go get a hammer, get a belt, get your stuff, get your bags. And I'll go down there and ask the guy who's the foreman for a job."
[time=2350] So I said, "Fine." So I didn't have a hammer. I didn't have a belt. They didn't know what bags were.
[time=2355] So I went down to the store. I think it was like Kmart or something. And I got this, I think of this little tiny plastic belt.
[time=2362] Kind of went around me like this. It was about that thick. I had a little plastic clip on it. I thought it was pretty cool.
[time=2368] There's plastic clip. And it had this little little metal hole ring right here. I said to the guy, "What's this for?" He looks at me like, "That's for your hammer." I said, "Oh, okay, well I need a hammer." So I go over to that hammer department and get a hammer. It was about that long.
[time=2381] I'm going to go frame houses, all right? I got this little hammer. It's about that long. I didn't know it then, but it was a little finish hammer.
[time=2387] A little smooth edge on the tip. It was just this little tiny hammer with my little hammer and my little belt with my rubber clip.
[time=2393] And I'm thinking, "You know, I need some boots because don't construction guys wear boots?" Well, I wasn't like asking anybody. It was a rhetorical question to myself because I was all alone.
[time=2401] And I'm thinking, "Well, they wear boots, right?" So I get these boots and these boots strap up to right about here, right down below the kneecaps.
[time=2407] These big old leather boots with a thousand, you know, shoestring holes and laces and boy, I got my boots.
[time=2413] And so I was ready to go. So it was time to go down there, six o'clock, five thirty that next morning.
[time=2419] It's already 90 degrees and so I got, I figured I'd wear some shorts. So I got shorts on with these boots up to here.
[time=2425] And I got this little tiny belt with a plastic clip and a little finish hammer.
[time=2429] And I'm walking on the job side. I'm telling you.
[time=2433] And so I can remember like it was yesterday.
[time=2437] I get up five thirty. I drive down the place pack. There's trucks everywhere.
[time=2441] And I make my way back to where this foreman I'm asking around. They say, "Well, he's back in the back."
[time=2447] Well, I come on the corner and it is a gauntlet. It is a gauntlet of pickup trucks, one after the other, after the other, after the other.
[time=2455] And at the end of the gauntlet is Steve was his name. He was the foreman, Steve.
[time=2462] And he's sitting on the tail guy. I can see him waiting on his tailgate. Well, I'll tell you guys.
[time=2466] And I know there's kids in here, so I got to be careful. But I'm walking down through this gauntlet, all right.
[time=2470] And it begins to dawn on me a few things, all right. All their hammers are a little bit bigger than mine.
[time=2475] All right. They got these big things called bags. I mean, their belts are big. Like, I used to wear these belts when I did weight lift.
[time=2481] I mean, there's big belts, big belts, big bags, big hammers. Nobody's wearing boots. They all got tennis shoes on.
[time=2487] Ankle socks, they're all tan, no shirts on. And they're all sitting in their trucks looking at me walk through with my stuff.
[time=2498] And they started, okay, you got to realize, I'm coming out of the cocoon of Christian living in circles.
[time=2505] And I never worked. They start cursing at me. I'm thinking, nobody's ever cursed at me. Why are you cursing at me?
[time=2511] I'm, you know, I'm Kelly. Well, who cares, right? They start saying things about my boots and my belt and my hammer and me.
[time=2519] And I just, I'm like, I almost got tears in my eyes. 22 years old, grown man almost in tears walking 50 yards through a gauntlet.
[time=2526] They've all had about five beers and 10 cigarettes by six in the morning. They're rare to go.
[time=2531] And I get to the Steve guy saying, I was told I could get a job here.
[time=2537] And he, I said, my name's Kelly. I was told I could get a job here. He says, I don't care who the you are.
[time=2543] Looks me right in the eye. He just, in my face, I don't care who the blank you are.
[time=2548] I'm thinking, wow, that's odd. Most people care about who I am.
[time=2553] And then he cursed at me. And so now everybody's cursing at me.
[time=2557] And he says, well, do you see, he set me up here. He said, do you know, you know how to frame?
[time=2563] I said, yeah. I was desperate. Two months, right? Made for the ring, the whole thing. I said, yeah.
[time=2570] And somehow in the, in the heart of a hardened old guy, I think God just kind of softened him a bit.
[time=2576] And he said fine, well, head on up to building five, they're building ten numbers.
[time=2581] Now you go up and building five. And they're, because I told him I knew what I was doing.
[time=2584] He says, go up on building five and start nailing in blocks on the roof choice.
[time=2590] So I'm walking up to building five and I'm going up the stairs with these guys.
[time=2593] And sure enough, some God sins. Guy. Guy was his name. And, and Mike.
[time=2603] Guy and Mike, I think, well, I know Guy. It was Guy and then this other guy. I think it was Mike.
[time=2608] And all I know is Guy. Guy came up to me and he said, he was, he was the construction guy of all construction guys.
[time=2614] And he walked into me and he says, dude, he says, dude, the hammer's got to go, dude.
[time=2619] He takes my hammer, literally takes my hammer out of my belt and throws it over the building.
[time=2623] Just gone. Pulls out another hammer. And the belt, he's like, dude, the belt has got to go.
[time=2628] And he pulls, he gives me a belt and he gives me some badge. We're walking up the stairs.
[time=2632] It gives me a new hammer. And we get up there. And so we start in and I grab my handful of nails.
[time=2636] And it's time to nail in these blocks. And I'm kind of watching. And I got my, all my nails in my hand and my hammer.
[time=2642] And, and so I don't know what to do with the nails because I got a hand. So I put our nails in my mouth.
[time=2647] I'm like, oh, these nails in my mouth. I'm pulling one out of time.
[time=2651] And the guy, the foreman makes his way to the roof and he looks at me.
[time=2654] And I got the, you know, his nails are covered with that green stuff. I got green slobber coming down my chin.
[time=2659] I got nails dropping everywhere. And that was the last time he let me hold a hammer for about three months.
[time=2667] Here's the point. For three months, you know what I did? For three months, I did things I'd never done in my life.
[time=2672] For three months, I rolled cords. For three months, I carried wood.
[time=2677] For three months, I was an absolute nobody. That was a grunt.
[time=2681] Who got told to do things. And if I didn't do them, I'd be fired. And I wouldn't have money for my wife.
[time=2686] I couldn't live. And I'd never, ever, ever been in that circumstance.
[time=2691] Ever in my life. I went and got a second job because I wasn't making enough money.
[time=2695] And I worked graveyard at a juvenile detention center out in the middle of nowhere where they took kids who were a little mentally deranged and in trouble with the law and housed them.
[time=2703] And I was housed there and worked the graveyard shift with another guy.
[time=2707] There'd be two of us because there would oftentimes have to be restraints and there would oftentimes be serious issues.
[time=2713] And 16 and 17 year old boys were who were in my home that I lived in at night, four nights a week.
[time=2721] And so I would go and roll cords and I would dig bitches and I would carry lumber.
[time=2726] You know, for ten hours and I'd go and get showered and go to work at the juvenile detention center and work all night and get up in the morning.
[time=2733] And I alternated some days and got to do some school in between and would stay up till 2.30 doing homework.
[time=2740] And it was the most amazing thing I'd ever experienced.
[time=2744] I was and I wrote this down. I was lonely. I was tired. I was sore. I was stretched. I was desperate and humiliated.
[time=2751] And I had never been those things in my life. Ever.
[time=2757] I learned for the first time in my life what it meant to be responsible.
[time=2762] And to start work at a certain time and quit work at a certain time and be evaluated based upon what was accomplished in that certain time,
[time=2771] knowing that if I didn't accomplish what I was supposed to, I was gone.
[time=2776] And those guys, those same guys that cursed me and ragged on me and made fun of me for months, the most amazing thing happened.
[time=2786] I actually learned how to frame. I mean, I stayed at it. I'd never done that in my life.
[time=2793] If you had given me something to do in my life that I didn't know how to do, I'd never do it or I'd have my mom do it.
[time=2799] And so finally, you know, ten, twelve months into this thing, it's been a year. I can frame.
[time=2804] I can help these guys build houses and we're friends and they called me preacher boy.
[time=2810] And we'd sit at lunch and tell stories and I learned words I never knew.
[time=2815] And I heard stories I'll never forget which I wish I could, but they got to tell stories too.
[time=2825] And guy, guy, stairway first day, get rid of the hammer dude. Guy comes to know Christ in the midst of all that.
[time=2834] And I have these amazing life changing days spent with these gentlemen.
[time=2839] And a year later, my buddy, who let me go, who fired me because he loved me enough to make me have to deal with my sin and my weaknesses.
[time=2849] calls one day and says, "Hey, I got a great idea. Let's do a church together."
[time=2855] And we had had this opportunity to kind of come up there in Southern California right near where we lived.
[time=2860] And then a church wanted two guys to come and give leadership to this fledgling little church of about 75, 90 people.
[time=2868] And so it was one of the sweetest, saddest days of my life.
[time=2873] Because guess what, for twelve months I had done something I'd never done before and I almost didn't want to leave.
[time=2879] I almost wanted to stay. I almost wanted to just keep getting up at 430 and working 80 hours a week and pounding nails and talking to guys and being outside.
[time=2889] And I almost wanted to just keep doing that for the rest of my life.
[time=2892] And yet the call of God kind of said, "Okay, you've kind of had your, then I didn't know about all this then, but it was my desert experience.
[time=2901] And I got to come back and be involved in this church. And we had so much fun.
[time=2906] We were better friends than we'd ever dreamed we could be.
[time=2909] And he had loved me in ways I never knew I could be loved.
[time=2912] And so we did that together and then after about two and a half years and 75 to 90 people becoming about 400, he decided he wanted to do the church thing.
[time=2922] Maybe in a different setting on a bigger scale and so he had this cockamony idea and he moved to Indiana.
[time=2929] And he became the pastor here in 1992, 1991.
[time=2935] And I said, "You go to Indiana. I'm going to stay here." And about four or five years later he called again and said, "Hey, what do you say? Maybe we could roll up our sleeves again, give ourselves to a church and try our best to help it be what God wants it to be."
[time=2952] And so I came.
[time=2954] And now he's done calling me. So don't worry about that. You're not going to call me anymore.
[time=2959] And I'm not going anywhere because I'm home. But tell you what, I would never listen.
[time=2968] I would never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, I'd never be here.
[time=2974] They're not just here, okay? I would never be who I am.
[time=2977] I wouldn't be married still. I wouldn't be staying at it with my kids.
[time=2983] I would be disrespecting people and manipulating people and I'd be lost and lonely and by myself somewhere broken.
[time=2993] If it hadn't been for the hand of God on my life and him saying, "You know what? It's time to grow."
[time=3001] And to do that I'm going to take you and put you over here and you better listen and you better hang on.
[time=3010] So I'm so thankful and you know what? I don't know where you're at today.
[time=3014] You may be on the tail end of a similar experience and going, "Oh, Kelly, preach it." I know exactly what you're saying. It's a great thing to be coming out of.
[time=3024] You may be here this morning just heading into it.
[time=3028] You may be newly saved and going, "Wow, I don't think I want to do this after all." I don't know, but I'll tell you this. He loves you and he loves me and his amazing grace
[time=3038] and incredible mercy reaches out to us and he takes us through times of growth and maturity
[time=3045] and it doesn't come without pain.
[time=3048] Why does God take us to the desert?
[time=3051] He takes us to the desert to what? To strengthen us and to mold us and to shape us.
[time=3056] Why? Because when we come out of the desert, what do we come back into?
[time=3060] When we come out of the desert, we come back into life.
[time=3063] And how's life, people? Blissful?
[time=3068] Joyous and rapturous and one big bobbing in the sea of gods?
[time=3073] No, life is tough.
[time=3076] Life is hard. Life throws you curves. Life gets at times, space 3, impossible.
[time=3082] And the desert experience and that which got learned comes into play.
[time=3086] Number 3, the despair. The despair that leads to a deeper trust.
[time=3091] The despair that leads to a deeper trust. Verse 23, back to Acts 9.
[time=3099] It says in 9, 23, "And when many days had elapsed, the Jews plotted together to do away with him.
[time=3110] But their plot became known to Saul and they were also watching the gates day and night so that they might put him to death. But his disciples took him by night and let him down for an opening in the wall lowering him in a large basket.
[time=3122] And when he had come to Jerusalem, he was trying to associate with the disciples.
[time=3126] He's gone from Damascus, he escapes, he's in Jerusalem trying to hook up with his brothers in Christ,
[time=3132] the disciples, and they were, verse 26, all afraid of him.
[time=3136] Not believing that he was a disciple, but Barnabas.
[time=3140] Thank God for Barnabas. But Barnabas took hold of him and brought him to the apostles and described to them how he had seen the Lord on the road and that he had talked to him and how at Damascus he had spoken out boldly in the name of Jesus. And he was with them, moving about freely in Jerusalem, speaking out boldly in the name of the Lord. And he was talking and arguing with the Hellenistic Jews. Verse 29, "But they were attempting to put him to death."
[time=3169] Everybody wants to kill this guy. From the desert experience back to reality,
[time=3175] it is not pretty, life is hard, it throws you curves.
[time=3179] And sometimes they're painful and scary and uncertain.
[time=3184] Verse 30, "But when the brethren learned of it, this plot, this newest plot, now to kill him, but when the brethren learned of it, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus.
[time=3196] So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria enjoyed peace, being built up and going on in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it continued to increase." Okay, what does he come back into?
[time=3210] The Damascus Jews wanted him dead. The Jerusalem disciples wanted nothing to do with him,
[time=3217] which if you think about it makes all the sense in the world, they had watched the same guy drag people out of their homes, murder, torture, kill, men, women and children.
[time=3228] And thank goodness for Barnabas, who lovingly and with perspective comes to his side
[time=3234] and offers insight. You know what Barnabas had? And you need more of it and I need more of it.
[time=3239] You need more of it and I need more of it as it relates to those in this room, those in our family. We do not do a very good job.
[time=3249] And I'll speak for you and me on this one.
[time=3253] We do not do a very good job of exercising what I call sensitive sight.
[time=3259] Sensitive sight. You see, Barnabas had the vision to see beyond Saul's past.
[time=3267] Sometimes we don't do a very good job of that.
[time=3270] He saw beyond Saul's past, his past failures and sins.
[time=3276] You and I might could do a better job seeing past the failures of others, because sometimes people's failures tend to, in some ways, I think hinder and affect our view and our perspective of them.
[time=3290] Those who have failed at jobs, those who have failed at marriage, those who have failed at ministry in sports or school or in business,
[time=3300] thank God for people like Barnabas, willing to risk public opinion or personal comfort in an effort to come alongside and encourage those hurting.
[time=3308] Who in your life? Who in your life today could use your encouraging,
[time=3316] loving, insightful, patient touch as you come alongside them in their failure,
[time=3323] whatever it might be. You see, sometimes their failure makes it uncomfortable for you and for me to actually get face to face, to actually get eye to eye, to actually put an arm around someone who's made some bad decisions.
[time=3335] You're pride and mind are so great that sometimes we make that difficult.
[time=3339] Sensitive sight, the ability to see past and the wisdom and the insight to move in
[time=3347] and lovingly do what we saw Barnabas do.
[time=3350] We got to wrap it up. Some things to think about as you go.
[time=3353] Just two things quick. God goes to great lengths to build humility and trust in him.
[time=3357] Okay, people? If you sense him moving you toward the desert, you can do one, two things. You can fight it and die and wallow in your weaknesses
[time=3366] and your unconfessed sin, or you can go with him and hang on.
[time=3369] He will go to great lengths to build humility and trust.
[time=3373] And secondly, in ministry, everyone's replaceable. Everyone except Christ.
[time=3378] He'll get his work done with you or without you. He'd rather do it with us.
[time=3383] So humble yourself. I was a proud cocky, arrogant 22-year-old who thought the kingdom of God needed me.
[time=3391] And he reminded me and he reminds me daily now and he's reminding you again today.
[time=3395] He doesn't need you. His ministry will get accomplished with or without you.
[time=3399] He wants it to be done with you, but he wants it done with humility.
[time=3403] And he wants it done with insight and maturity and strength and character.
[time=3408] And that comes through the desert.
[time=3411] Let's stand and close in a word of prayer.
[time=3418] Father, we're reminded today, I think many in the room are, as I have been just thinking back through these things again.
[time=3424] So reminded of those who have been used of you to do things, to say things,
[time=3431] to be things for us in our lives. And it's made a difference.
[time=3435] And God, I thank you for my friend and I thank you for the hundreds of friends that maybe have made similar kinds of impact, who have influenced and loved well with those who stand with me in this room today.
[time=3450] Father, maybe many here today have experienced that kind of investment, that kind of love and that kind of faithfulness.
[time=3457] And we thank you collectively for those people.
[time=3460] God, we pray as we leave here, but whatever phase we're in this morning, this is beautiful, this is difficult, or this is impossible.
[time=3468] God, our prayer would be that your spirit would visit us in the hours and days to come, that we would sense your presence and having sensed your presence, God, that we would hang on with the strength and courage only you provide to learn lessons and see things about us that need to be seen so that God, we might be the people, the men, the women, the young people that you need us to be.
[time=3490] God, give us strength for that and we'll look forward to being together again soon in your son's name we pray. Amen.
