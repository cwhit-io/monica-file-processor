[time=53] Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church. Thank you for joining us. We trust that the music and message from God's word will help you in your Christian walk. Now let's join our service.
[time=65] I have the privilege of reading from this book to you. My dad passed away. I think it's
[time=73] been about 7 years in April, but his words kept ringing in my ears. Marsha, you gotta
[time=80] get in the book. How are you gonna know how to live? How are you gonna know about God unless you get in the book? Did you know that it took 1,100 or 200 years to write this?
[time=94] 40 different authors, three different continents. They didn't know each other. They weren't
[time=100] able to take notes. And yet God breathed in their mind and in their hearts and souls
[time=107] what to write. And there's unity and thought. And the theme running throughout is God's
[time=114] love for us. I hold my hand treasure right here. I'm gonna read from Revelation chapter
[time=125] 4 verses 8 through 11. Each of these living beings, day after day and night after night,
[time=133] they keep saying, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, the one who always was,
[time=142] who is, and who is still to come." Whenever the living beings give glory and honor and
[time=149] thanks to the one sitting on the throne, the one who lives forever and ever, the 24 elders
[time=157] fall down and worship the one who lives forever and ever. And they lay their crowns before
[time=165] the throne and say, "You are worthy, O Lord our God, to receive glory and honor and power
[time=176] for you created everything and it is for your pleasure that they exist and were created."
[time=195] [MUSIC][MUSIC] Oh, that is within the Lord [MUSIC] We'll bless your holy name [MUSIC] I live my life to worship you alone [MUSIC] You brought me out of darkness and into your glorious
[time=233] life [MUSIC] Forever I will sing of your great love [MUSIC] Forever I will sing of your great love [MUSIC] I'd love to see you glorify, to see you lift it high [MUSIC] I yearn to see all nations bow their knees [MUSIC] It's you the love of Jesus who can cause a coldest heart [MUSIC] To find your love in everlasting peace [MUSIC] To find your love in everlasting peace [MUSIC] Holy, holy is the Lord [MUSIC] Holy, holy is the Lord [MUSIC] Holy, holy [MUSIC] Holy is the Lord [MUSIC] Holy, holy [MUSIC] Holy is the Lord [MUSIC] Join us now. I'd love to see you glorify, to see you lift it high [MUSIC] I yearn to see all nations bow their knees [MUSIC] To the Lord Jesus who can cause a coldest heart [MUSIC] To find your love in everlasting peace [MUSIC] To find your love in everlasting peace [MUSIC] Holy, holy is the Lord [MUSIC] Holy, holy [MUSIC] Holy, holy is the Lord [MUSIC] Holy, holy is the Lord [MUSIC] Holy, holy is the Lord [MUSIC] And your trumpet will sound [MUSIC] And all the heavens will know [MUSIC] That the time has finally come [MUSIC] For the bright to take her place [MUSIC] And we'll hear the angels sing [MUSIC] Holy, holy [MUSIC] Holy, holy is the Lord [MUSIC] Holy, holy is the Lord [MUSIC] Holy, holy is the Lord [MUSIC] Holy, holy is the Lord [MUSIC]
[time=540] Dear Lord, I kneel before you now to recognize you as Lord and Savior of my life.
[time=546] Thank you for dying on the cross for me to save me for my sins.
[time=550] I realize that because of the awful things I've done in my life, I don't deserve your love or mercy, yet you give it to me freely.
[time=559] Amazing grace. How sweet the sound.
[time=566] Oh, here comes someone else. I guess I should scoot over.
[time=572] I wonder what she's been through to end up here.
[time=575] She's probably homeless and she does have a place to live.
[time=578] She probably survives on welfare. I bet she's never even had a real job.
[time=583] It's been my money. My hard-earned money that's kept this person alive.
[time=588] A real nuisance to society. That's what I call these people.
[time=591] And now she thinks she can just waltz on up here, and Jesus will take care of all of her problems and fix her broken down life.
[time=599] Well, I never will be.
[time=616] Is that it? Is he?
[time=619] I guess he is. I have no idea. I mean, who would have thought?
[time=623] I know I never did. Not that I'm prejudiced or anything.
[time=627] I believe everyone has his or her own place with God.
[time=631] It's just that I guess you could say that some people are at a different level than others.
[time=644] Hey, wait a minute. Just wait a cut and pick a minute.
[time=654] This is getting way out of hand. I know that we're all sinners saved by grace, but this is one that's in a whole other category.
[time=661] In fact, I think it was number three on my top 10 sin list right after murder and child molestation. I mean, come on. My lying here in deceit there doesn't even compare. Ever. There was someone.
[time=676] If ever there was a reason for these things, Shirley Shee is it.
[time=689] This was not hard to justify. I mean, I was on the missions committee in my
[time=697] church among other things.
[time=706] You've got to be kidding me. Who let her in here?
[time=717] Doesn't she know she doesn't belong here?
[time=720] Doesn't she realize where we are and that she hasn't done the right things to be here? I'll give you something quick. There's a Bible.
[time=731] This has always been my sword and my fight against such as these.
[time=735] What a perfect thing to use to lift me up just a little bit more.
[time=753] You, therefore, have no excuse.
[time=783] You who pass judgment on someone else, for at whatever point you judge the other, you are condemning yourself. So do not think of yourself more highly than you ought. The ground is truly level at the foot of the cross.
[time=800] In the spring of 1992, violence inflamed the city of Los Angeles.
[time=809] When the smoke finally cleared and estimated 5,200 buildings had been destroyed or damaged and losses ranged close to one billion dollars. A staggering number of people were arrested, almost 17,000. The number of injured soared to 2,383 and
[time=828] the death bell told a tragic 54 times. What could have fueled
[time=835] such a destructive rampage? In speculating about the many possible causes for the riots, we can sift through that city's rubble and uncover a major flashpoint. Prejudice. Prejudice.
[time=850] Differences in color and culture had ignited misunderstanding, which had sparked antagonism, which had inflamed hatred, then anger, then ultimately revenge.
[time=860] The result was 36 hours of a havoc, chaos, and bloodshed.
[time=865] We shake our heads today at such horrible violence, but admit it or not, we all have that same volatile prejudice smoldering within us.
[time=873] According to Webster, prejudice is simply this.
[time=878] Prejudice is, according to Webster, a preconceived judgment. A preconceived judgment. A preconceived
[time=889] judgment that rests in the core of your heart and mind.
[time=893] Take a moment for a quick personal prejudice test.
[time=897] What images come to mind? What images come to mind when you think of blacks or whites or Hispanics or Asians?
[time=910] What do you think about? What do you see? What phrases run across your head?
[time=916] How about those who are poor? How about those who are wealthy, who have a lot more than you have? How do you view them? Do you categorize people by the length of their hair, the cosmetics they wear or don't wear?
[time=929] Politically, what about liberals? What about conservatives?
[time=934] How do you feel about people who have failed? How do you feel about folks who are divorced, who have been in psychiatric hospitals?
[time=943] What about religious prejudice? How do you view those who attend a different church? How about those who worship differently than you do or have a different list of do's and don'ts? It's embarrassing.
[time=958] It's painful to face our own prejudices. It's hard to see through the negative preconceptions we've had all our lives. And you know what? We're not alone.
[time=967] We are not alone. As our journey through this great book of Acts continues this morning, we will see that the Apostle Peter was trapped by prejudice as well. And I want you to see, I want us to watch, I want us to pay attention as we make our through a study of these first 23 verses in chapter 10 of Acts. If you think back with me,
[time=991] in Acts chapter 1, Acts chapters 1 through 7, we watched as the church was born in Jerusalem. It's where it got its start.
[time=1000] In Acts 8 and 9, we watched as persecution escalated. And as the persecution escalated, we saw that the church began to grow, literally expand.
[time=1011] As escalation of persecution came, people began to scatter.
[time=1016] And as they began to scatter, the gospel began to scatter.
[time=1020] And as the concentric circles of the gospel and the church grew, an expanded and inevitable and lingering tension grew restless,
[time=1030] slowly making its way to the top. There was an issue that the
[time=1036] church was bound to bump into. There was a tension underneath the surface of that day that it was bound to have to face.
[time=1044] And as the church grew and expanded, it happened.
[time=1048] It came right to the surface. And the issue was probably best and is best captured in the question that was being asked in the hearts of many people in that day. Was the gospel, was the gospel just for the Jew? Or was the gospel from the hope of salvation
[time=1068] and the kingdom of God, was that for others?
[time=1071] Non-Jews in that day called Gentiles. Was the gospel just for the Jew?
[time=1077] Or was the gospel in fact going to be for all?
[time=1082] Jews and non-Jews, Jews and Gentiles. And so that we're on the same page.
[time=1087] And just to make sure that we're seeing this thing as we should, please understand this morning. Some of you are aware of this. Some of you have studied this. Some of you have heard messages on this before.
[time=1097] Others of you here this morning, it may be all new to you.
[time=1100] And please understand before we jump into this, that the love, that the love between the Jews and the Gentiles
[time=1109] was little. There was none in fact.
[time=1113] There was absolutely no love whatsoever. Zero, zip, zelch,
[time=1119] nothing. There was a deep-seated animosity, an extreme hatred. And there was even a history, there was a history to their hate. This went way, way back.
[time=1131] I mean it was current and there was stuff going on in that day, but it went way, way back even to the Old Testament. First of all, though, let me read you a quote. There was a history to their hate.
[time=1140] Author Alfred Eddershine describes the depth of the inbred prejudice that Jews were taught to hold against Gentiles.
[time=1149] And he says this. He says, and I quote, "As small children, they were taught referring to Jewish children. As small children, they were taught that every Gentile child, so soon as born, was to be regarded as unclean. The Mishnah, kind of a group of rules and regulations put together in a book for Jews in that time. The Mishnah goes so far as to forbid aid to a Gentile mother in the hour of her need or nourishment to her babe who would be in need as well in order not to bring up a child for idolatry.
[time=1184] They were not to help a Gentile mother in need. They were to let Gentile babies in need die, so as not to allow them to grow up for idolatry. It was not safe to leave cattle in their charge to allow their women to nurse infants or their physicians to attend the sick nor to walk in their company. They and theirs were defiled through and through their houses unclean as containing idols or things dedicated to idols, their feasts, their joyous occasions, their very contact was polluted by idolatry.
[time=1217] And there was no security. No security. If a heathen were left alone in a room
[time=1223] that he might not defile the wine or meat on the table or the oil and wheat in the store, milk drawn by a Gentile.
[time=1230] If a Jew had not been present to watch it, bread and oil prepared by them all unlawful. Their wine was completely unacceptable. The mere touch of a Gentile polluted a whole cask even to put one's nose
[time=1245] to Gentile wine was strictly prohibited.
[time=1248] End quote. Even back in the Old Testament, as I mentioned, we see
[time=1254] the hard feelings and the hatred. Turn back in your Bible to Jonah.
[time=1260] Go back to the book of Jonah just before the book of Micah.
[time=1265] Just after Obadiah, you'll find it tucked in there.
[time=1270] And we could spend an hour tracing the history of this hate people. But just look here with me at Jonah. Look at how deep this hatred ran.
[time=1279] Look how hard the feelings were. Go to Jonah chapter 3.
[time=1283] Jonah chapter 3, we see here in this man a prejudice, a preconceived judgment,
[time=1294] a way of thinking. It brings to light this entire issue between the Jews and the Gentiles. It says in chapter 3, Now the word of the Lord came to Jonah the second time, right? First time hadn't gone so well.
[time=1306] Many of you know the story. The first time the word of the Lord came to Jonah saying, "Go to Nineveh." Jonah said, "No thanks." I think I'll go to Tarshis. He ends up on a boat, he ends up in the water, he ends up in a whale, he ends up on the beach saying, "Okay, I'll rethink this thing." So now he's on round two. Second time the word of the Lord came to Jonah saying, "Arise, go to Nineveh, the great city, and proclaim to it the proclamation, which I am going to tell you." So Jonah arose and went to Nineveh according to the word of the Lord. You see it there? Look at verse 5, "Then the people of Nineveh
[time=1337] believed in God, and they called a fast and put on sackcloth from the greatest to the least of them.
[time=1344] And when the word reached the king of Nineveh, he arose from his throne, laid aside his robe from him, covered himself with sackcloth and sat on the ashes, and he issued a proclamation, and it said, "In Nineveh, by the decree of the king and his nobles,
[time=1359] do not let man, beast, herd, or flock taste a thing, do not let them eat or drink water, but both men and beast must be covered with sackcloth and let men call on God earnestly,
[time=1371] that each may turn from his wicked way, and from the violence which is in his hands, who knows," the king says here, "who knows, God may turn and relent, and withdraw his burning anger,
[time=1381] so that we shall not perish." This is amazing stuff, this is great. The word of the Lord
[time=1389] had been proclaimed, and people far from God, living lives of violence and wickedness and
[time=1396] unrighteousness are called back to truth, and they respond, and they fast, and they repent.
[time=1401] God saw their deeds that they had turned from their wicked way, then God relented concerning the
[time=1408] calamity, which he had declared he would bring upon them, and he did not do it.
[time=1412] Chapter 4 verse 1, "But it greatly displeased Jonah." You see that?
[time=1419] It greatly displeased Jonah, and it didn't just displease him, what does it say? And he became
[time=1427] angry. Jonah's ticked, and he prayed to the Lord and said, "Please Lord, was not this what I said
[time=1434] while I was still in my own country, therefore in order to forestall this I fled to Tarshis, for I knew that thou art a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and abundant in loving kindness,
[time=1445] and one who relents concerning calamity, therefore now O Lord, watch this, please take my life from me,
[time=1451] for death is better to me than life if you're going to save Gentiles."
[time=1460] You're going to bring people to faith that aren't you? Kill me. The hatred and the issues ran so deep.
[time=1470] And as that book continues, and you can read along, even on your own later, you can see the
[time=1476] lesson God teaches, Jonah. And it's the same lesson we're seeing here again in Acts 10.
[time=1483] And we come to Acts 10, and you know what? It's a safe bet. It's a safe bet, people, that as we come
[time=1490] to Acts 10, our lead apostle Peter, a Jew, had been entrenched in this thinking, had been taught
[time=1498] this thinking, had been modeled probably his entire life this way of thinking. He had been shown
[time=1506] this mindset and this attitude, this hatred of those outside the family of the Jewish nation
[time=1513] was something that was prevalent. And it was only a fresh breath of God's grace.
[time=1520] And that's how it is, isn't it? It's how it is with me, it's how it is with you, and it's how it was with Peter. Only a fresh breath of God's grace could clear the air and his mind
[time=1533] on the way he thought so that the door of hope could be opened to a Gentile world waiting to follow Christ. And this fresh breath comes unexpectedly as God brings two worlds together, two completely
[time=1546] and absolutely different worlds together in the persons of two men. He brings the two worlds
[time=1552] together as he brings together, Paul, excuse me, Peter and Cornelius. Peter and Cornelius.
[time=1559] So to set the stage, before we jump in, just to set the stage, Peter at this time, the text will
[time=1565] tell us is residing in Japa, Japa, he is staying in the home of Simon the Tanner. Japa was a seaside
[time=1573] town located about 30 miles south of Caesarea where a Gentile man named Cornelius lived. And it was
[time=1581] Cornelius. Don't know why Cornelius got picked, but it was Cornelius who we will see as this passage
[time=1589] unfolds, who was the first to experience the divine nudge of God. Luke introduces him to us in
[time=1597] these first several verses in one corner, Cornelius. Cornelius, Acts chapter 10, those first couple
[time=1605] of verses, it says that, it says there was a certain man at Caesarea named Cornelius, a centurion of
[time=1612] what was called the Italian cohort, a devout man and one who feared God with all his household and
[time=1619] gave many arms to the Jewish people and prayed to God continually. Stop there. Cornelius, a devout
[time=1629] man. Do you see that? A God-fearing man, a man who had certain beliefs, a man who even gave money,
[time=1637] gave offerings to the Jewish people, even prayed and talked to God that it doesn't say that he knew
[time=1645] God. Does it say he knew him? No. No, it says he feared him. It says he feared him. As a centurion,
[time=1653] Cornelius commanded 100 soldiers who were part of a Roman cohort or battalion, bearing his many
[time=1660] battle scars like medals. This tough military officer also wore the honorable badge of a God-fearing
[time=1667] man. Understand now, most Romans in this day would have been what we call polytheistic. Most
[time=1674] Romans in this time would have believed in a great number of different gods, polytheism. Most were
[time=1681] kind of along those lines, but Cornelius chose to believe in one, chose to serve the one God of the
[time=1687] Jews, not only in word, but indeed as well. He was not a Christian at this time, but he was seeking.
[time=1694] He was sincerely desiring to follow God and God honors his devotion, enlisting him as the first
[time=1701] of many Gentiles that would soon enter into faith in Christ and soon enter into the church. What a
[time=1707] distinction. What a privilege. What an honor. He's the first. God kind of tags and puts his hand on
[time=1714] him and has great plans for Cornelius. Look at verse three. About the ninth hour of the day,
[time=1720] Cornelius, he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God who had just come into him and said to him,
[time=1727] Cornelius and fixing his gaze upon him and being much alarmed. He said, "What is it, Lord?"
[time=1734] And he said to him, "Your prayers and arms have ascended as a memorial before God and now dispatch
[time=1741] some men to Japa and sin for a man named Simon who was also called Peter. He is staying with a
[time=1747] certain tenor named Simon whose house is by the sea." Verse seven, "And when the angel who was speaking to him had departed, he summoned two of his servants and a devout soldier of those who were
[time=1758] in constant attendance upon him. And after he had explained everything to them, he sent them to Japa.
[time=1765] Look at that. A well-trained soldier, right? The well-trained soldier. Cornelius doesn't do
[time=1772] what you and I oftentimes do when God tells us to do something. He doesn't ask why. He doesn't
[time=1778] argue. He doesn't run it by 20 people hoping to find one who might agree with his or her hesitation.
[time=1785] No, he obeyed. The text would indicate he obeyed immediately. He sends his messengers to Japa to
[time=1793] bring Peter back to Caesarea. Now, meanwhile in Japa, Peter's about ready to experience his own
[time=1799] vision. There's some visions going on here. Cornelius has a vision. God tells Cornelius, "Go send for Peter." Well, you know, almost concurrently over here, Peter's about ready to have a vision that will forever alter and change his life. Peter's about to witness something.
[time=1815] Peter's about to experience a divine vision that will forever change the way he views ministry,
[time=1821] the way he views life, his worldview. Everything is about to get different.
[time=1825] In the other corner, Peter pick it up, chapter 10, verse 9. And on the next day as they were on
[time=1833] their way and approaching the city, Peter went up on the housetop about the sixth hour, which would
[time=1840] have been around noon to pray. And he became hungry, it says there in verse 10, and was desiring to
[time=1846] eat. But while they were making preparations, he fell into a trance and he beheld the sky opened
[time=1852] up and a certain object like a great sheet coming down lowered by four corners to the ground.
[time=1859] And there were in it all kinds of four-footed animals and crawling creatures of the earth and
[time=1867] birds of the air. And a voice came to him and said, "Arise Peter, kill and eat." But Peter said,
[time=1874] "By no means, Lord, for I have never eaten anything unholy and unclean." And again, a voice came to him a second time. What God has cleansed, no longer consider unholy.
[time=1887] And this happened, it says in verse 16, this happened three times and immediately the object
[time=1894] was taken up into the sky. Now any Jew, especially Peter, any Jew at that time would have had a
[time=1904] strong and devoted commitment to God's Old Testament dietary laws, which forbid them to eat
[time=1911] food which had been deemed unclean, as some on this sheet in the vision were these four-footed
[time=1919] animals. There were some objects on that sheet. There were some food options there in this vision
[time=1925] that were clearly based upon what he had been told and taught and had been living and had been devoted to his entire life. There were clearly some things on that sheet that he was not to touch, that he was not to eat. Now watch the contrast. Peter hears, Peter hears God say to him, "Peter,
[time=1943] kill and eat." And he what? He hesitates. Verse 14, Peter said, "By no means, by no means, Lord,
[time=1952] I've never had anything unholy or unclean. I never have. I'm not going to. I never will. No, no,
[time=1959] I can't do that," he says. So the voice fires back in verse 15, what God, and this is it right
[time=1966] here, folks. This is where God begins to make his move. This is where the new message begins to get communicated. This is where new truth comes on to the scene. In verse 15, the voice fires back.
[time=1977] What God has cleansed, no longer consider unholy. What God has cleansed, Peter, no longer consider
[time=1988] unholy, and that is it right there. Do you understand what an enormous truth that is?
[time=1994] Chuck Swindall in Commoning on that phrase says this. He said, "God's grace had in this one sentence,
[time=2001] flung open the tightly closed doors of their narrow legalism. Christ's atonement, his sacrificial
[time=2007] death, had once and for all cleansed the unholy so that all people, all people could be accepted by
[time=2017] him, no matter how dirty." And this gets right to the crux of what Peter was facing and folks,
[time=2025] it gets right to the crux of what you and I face every day. What God has cleansed, he says to us,
[time=2033] no longer consider unholy. And that's a little bit different than the old school train of thought.
[time=2042] There was a day in Peter's life and there was a day in my life and I can remember being exposed
[time=2048] to it. I can remember hearing messages pertaining to it. I can remember being around people growing
[time=2054] up in my life who thought this way. There was an old school mentality and there was an approach to
[time=2060] life that basically said this, clean up your act, then come to Christ. Clean up your act,
[time=2071] get yourself together and then you'll be welcomed in a place whereby you could receive forgiveness
[time=2078] and hope. Cut your hair, clean up your language, get all those questions in, clean up your act,
[time=2085] then come to faith. And the new covenant says it differently. The new message says it differently.
[time=2093] The new truth that comes onto the scene here says it much differently. The new truth says come to me.
[time=2101] Come to me. Come to me and we'll get you cleaned up together. Come to me first.
[time=2108] All your troubles with all your ailments, with all your hang-ups, with all your issues come to me.
[time=2113] What God has cleansed, no longer consider unholy, come to me. Come to me, you who are gay,
[time=2120] homeless, black, white, divorced, unemployed, violated and on and on and on. He says come to me.
[time=2131] And we'll get your act cleaned up. We'll give you a new heart, give you a new hope. We'll give you forgiveness and an opportunity to live life the way God intended you to live it. The old school,
[time=2143] clean up your act and come find hope, new covenant, come to me. Now we see something very, very telling
[time=2151] about the depth of Peter's prejudice. And you know what, maybe ours as well. I can't speak for you. I know I can speak for me in the last week thinking through these things. The last four or five days considering these truths, these last several days asking myself questions. I haven't asked myself
[time=2169] in a while. It's been very, very telling for me. And we see something extremely telling about the
[time=2175] depth at which this prejudice resided in the heart of Peter. And you see it there in verse 16.
[time=2182] According to verse 16, how many times did the Lord have to explain all this? How many?
[time=2188] Three times. People, this is Peter, all right? This is Peter. Peter's a bright guy. Peter's a gifted
[time=2198] guy. Peter loves God. This is the God coming to Peter in a vision. And he's being very clear and
[time=2206] he's being very specific. And he lowers the thing down. And there's the animals. And he says, arise,
[time=2212] kill and eat. And Peter says, no, no, no, no. I can't do that. And God says, no, no, no, no, no.
[time=2217] Yes, you can. No longer consider unholy. That which has been cleansed. And they do it again,
[time=2225] it says. A second time. She comes down. There's the animals. God says, arise and eat. Peter says,
[time=2233] no, no, no. A third time. He goes through this, this miraculous thing, this object lesson,
[time=2241] this visual to try and help Peter understand. It's a new day and a new truth. And three times
[time=2248] he goes through this with him. And after the third time, look at the end of verse 16, beginning of verse 17. Does he get it? Even after three times, verse 17, now while Peter was greatly what?
[time=2262] What's your Bible say? Wandering, perplexed. Three times. Words from God. Direct revelation.
[time=2272] And he's still stuck. It's like God's looking at him saying, hey, Peter, what about stop
[time=2280] prejudging? Didn't you understand? It's like getting a kid to clean his room. You know, sometimes you just, you say, what about, what don't you get about what I'm saying?
[time=2288] Could I be any clearer with you? And three times. He hears it all. Three times. He still doesn't get it.
[time=2296] Verse 17, he's still perplexed. Hey, question for you this morning.
[time=2301] Question for us this morning. Are we getting it?
[time=2309] Do you get it? Do I get it? I mean, really. Do you really get it?
[time=2319] You know, the question, the question of the morning has got to be this. Do you want this church? I mean, let's cut to the chase. Do you want, do you? Those of you who call this place home,
[time=2329] those of you who are committed in your hearts to black off, those of you who long to see God continue to do great things and are mixed. And in this community, those of you that love this church want to be a part of this family, want to see it grow and become all that God would have it be. Do you want down deep in your heart? Do you want this place absolutely packed with poor people
[time=2351] coming into Christ? Do you want this place full of gay people? Do you want this place, as the song
[time=2357] says, full of red, yellow, black, and white? And I understand, like you understand, we're in
[time=2365] northeast Fort Wayne. Another certain demographics that come with northeast Fort Wayne, sure there are.
[time=2375] But you know what? Do you want this place to be a place that is open? Do you want this place that welcomes people? Do you want this place to be a place full of red, yellow, black, and white?
[time=2384] Do you really want it full of rich and wealthy, unemployed, divorced, successful and unsuccessful?
[time=2390] Those struggling with their sexuality. Do you want this place full of those kinds of people all
[time=2396] coming on their journey to find hope and to find Christ and to learn how better to follow him?
[time=2403] Do you want this place full of people, like that? Or do you want this place full of people just
[time=2410] just like you, whoever you are? Who do you want to be?
[time=2417] Kind of a ministry do we want to have? What kind of stretch do we want to make with our arms?
[time=2427] What do we want to encompass? What do we want to welcome? Who do we want to minister to?
[time=2432] God says to Peter in this vision, "Hey, no longer consider unclean that which I have cleansed."
[time=2439] He says here in the text that God had to take Peter through it three times. And finally,
[time=2447] finally the hate gives way to humility. Finally the hate gives way to humility. Look at verse 17,
[time=2456] now while Peter was greatly perplexed. In mind as to what the vision which he had seen might be,
[time=2463] behold the men who had been sent by Cornelius having asked directions for Simon's house, appeared at the gate. And calling out they were asking whether Simon, who was also called Peter, was staying there. And while Peter was reflecting on the vision, the Spirit said to him, "Behold,
[time=2478] three men are looking for you. But arise, go downstairs and accompany them without misgivings, for I have sent them myself." And Peter went down to the men and said, "Behold, I am the one you are looking for. What is the reason for which you have come?" And they said, Cornelius, a centurion. And right there, just that word. And Peter knows, a centurion, a Gentile,
[time=2501] starting to click. And they said Cornelius, "A centurion, a righteous and God-fearing man,
[time=2509] well spoken of by the entire nation of the Jews, was divinely directed by a holy angel, a sin for you to come to his house and hear a message from you." And so he, here it is.
[time=2520] And so he invited them in. It's a new day. It's a new truth. It's a new message, people. And he
[time=2529] goes against everything he had been taught and everything he had learned and all that had been modeled for him. And in a new day with a new truth in his heart, what does he do? He invites them in
[time=2541] and gave them lodging. Our bigotry, people, our prejudice is so very ugly, isn't it?
[time=2554] Sometimes embarrassing for me these last few days to realize some of what has been prejudged,
[time=2563] preconditioned. Some of what has been built into my own mind and my own heart and my own way of
[time=2570] responding. Some of the things that were said during the drama, which was very well done, some of the things that were said in that woman's mind are things I've heard myself say,
[time=2582] thoughts I've had, feelings I've harbored. And God has a way, as he did here with Peter, of
[time=2591] bringing those, those prejudice, preconceived judgments right out into the open. And he brings
[time=2599] these three guys along and he brings Cornelius along and he does this work in Peter. And Peter begins to realize it is a new day. There is a new truth. No longer consider unholy that which I have
[time=2611] cleansed. I want you to think about three things this morning as you head out of here and as you
[time=2618] think about this over the next several days. And I really want you to think about this and I really want you to give this some time. And I want you to pray about this and I want you to talk about this as a family and I want you to talk about it with your friends and I want you to give some time and thought to the degree to which your heart and your mind, like my heart and mind this
[time=2636] week, maybe to whatever degree need to be reassessed, re-addressed. And I want to give you some things
[time=2646] here just to consider and pray about and look at in your own heart and mind as the days go by this week and I would just ask you and I would ask us as a family to be very, very open to what God would be teaching us and showing us about not only his truth but our lives and this church and the
[time=2661] kind of ministry in the heart of this place and the way we approach the people, whoever they are,
[time=2670] acts cleaned up or acts still struggling. The way we approach the people that God sends across our
[time=2676] path, three things, three truths to take home about prejudice. Number one, the root of prejudice
[time=2683] is pride. Write that down. I didn't need to tell you that I know but it's just a good reminder.
[time=2688] The root of prejudice people is pride. Go back to Proverbs. Flip back to Proverbs chapter 16.
[time=2699] Proverbs chapter 16 verses 18 and 19. The root of prejudice is pride. It says in Proverbs chapter
[time=2709] 16 verse 18, pride goes before destruction. You see it there? Chapter 16 verse 18, pride goes
[time=2721] before destruction and a haughty spirit before stumbling. It is better to be of a humble spirit
[time=2729] with the lowly. Do you see that? Pride goes before destruction and a haughty spirit before stumbling.
[time=2735] It is better to be of a humble spirit with the lowly than to divide the spoil with the proud.
[time=2742] Pride sticks out its chest and struts through life with a heart that shouts,
[time=2749] "My way is the only real way." My preconceived judgment, my opinion, my perspective, my agenda,
[time=2758] my way is the only real way. My choice of clothes, my choice of movies, my choice of friends,
[time=2765] politics, my neighborhood, school and music, all of it, it's the only way because it's my way.
[time=2770] And you better get in line with it or deal with it. Pride says that with chest stuck out.
[time=2779] And if you're not careful and if I'm not careful, and if we don't repent of our pride and our arrogance, Proverbs 18, 12 says it very clearly.
[time=2790] It says it's just a few pages over. Before destruction, the heart of man is haughty, but humility goes before honor. Before destruction, the heart of man is haughty. It's proud.
[time=2803] But humility goes before honor. Don't forget this truth as well. Not only is the root of
[time=2811] prejudice pride, but number two, the stubbornness in prejudice is brought on by and cultivated by
[time=2817] tradition. Not truth. The stubbornness in prejudice is brought on by and cultivated by tradition,
[time=2827] not truth. Think about it. Think about it just for a moment. Somebody once said Peter was weaned
[time=2835] on hatred for Gentiles. Peter was weaned on hatred for Gentiles. Well, what were you weaned on?
[time=2848] What sinful, disrespectful, unloving, unkind to whatever degree thought or were you weaned on?
[time=2857] What'd you get told? What'd you get taught? What'd you get modeled for you? What mindset? What approach?
[time=2864] What perspective toward whomever? God kind of built into the way you think and respond and feel,
[time=2871] face it. Our parents, and this is not a blaming session. It's just true. Our parents, our grandparents,
[time=2877] our peers, our culture teach us from day one to view people differently.
[time=2882] Happens all the time. We are told and we are taught to view different people differently.
[time=2889] And that tradition continues. Parents, I'll just say this to you, moms and dads,
[time=2899] on your own or maybe you're together, whatever. Would you be willing, even just this week,
[time=2907] would you be willing as parents with little impressionable hearts and minds?
[time=2913] You know and I know, always listening, always watching. Would you be willing, moms and dads, to give some thought to this and to begin to not only kind of proactively teach and talk about
[time=2924] the fact that therefore what God has cleansed, let no one consider unholy? Would you not only be
[time=2931] willing to begin to talk about and dialogue about and remind about that but then to even look back in what's already been communicated and what's already been taught, what's already been established
[time=2943] and maybe just maybe you would find as I have found in just some of these recent days,
[time=2951] some messages. I didn't mean to send them. I didn't know I was, I wasn't, I wasn't
[time=2958] willingly and in a premeditated sense sending them. You know, I look back over the last few years, there's messages I've sent to my own kids that I think if I'm not careful and if we're not careful
[time=2970] as a family, they would begin to think and they would begin to view and they would begin to in time respond in ways that I think would make the stomach of God turn.
[time=2980] The stubbornness of prejudice is brought about by tradition, not truth and it is a tradition
[time=2989] that you have an opportunity and I have an opportunity to effect and alter.
[time=2994] Thirdly and in closing let me just say this, facing or moving away from prejudice is painful.
[time=3005] Facing or moving away from prejudice is painful and let me just read this to you.
[time=3012] We were the only family, only family with children in the restaurant. I said Eric my
[time=3019] little one in a high chair and noticed everyone was quietly eating and talking. Suddenly Eric squealed with glee and said hi there. He pounded his fat baby hands on the high chair tray,
[time=3029] his eyes were wide with excitement and his mouth was bared in a toothless grin. He wriggled and
[time=3035] giggled with merriment. I looked around and saw the source of his merriment. It was a man with a tattered rag of a coat, dirty, greasy and worn. His pants were baggy with a zipper at half-mast
[time=3047] and his toes poked out of would-be shoes, his shirt was dirty and his hair was uncommed and unwashed. His whiskers were too short to be called a beard and his nose was too so vericose it looked
[time=3058] like a road map. We were too far from him to smell but I was sure he did. His hands waved and flapped
[time=3066] on loose wrists. Hi there baby. Hi there big boy. I see you buster the man said to Eric.
[time=3073] My husband and I exchanged looks. What do we do? We thought as we looked at each other. Everyone in
[time=3080] the restaurant noticed and looked at us and then at the man the old geyser was creating a nuisance with my beautiful baby. Our meal came and the man began shouting from across the room, "Do you know patty cake? Do you know peek-a-boo? Hey look he knows peek-a-boo." Nobody thought the old man was cute. He was obviously drunk. My husband and I were embarrassed. We ate
[time=3102] in silence all except for Eric who was running through his repertoire for the admiring skid row bum who in turn reciprocated with his cute comments. We finally got through the meal and
[time=3113] headed for the door. My husband went to pay the check and told me to meet him in the parking lot.
[time=3116] The old man sat poised between me and the door. Lord just let me out of here before he speaks to me
[time=3123] or Eric. I prayed and as I drew closer to the man I turned my back trying to sidestep him
[time=3129] and avoid any air he might be breathing. As I did Eric leaned over my arm reaching with both arms
[time=3136] in a baby's pick-me-up position before I could stop him. Eric had propelled himself from my arms
[time=3142] to the man's arms. Suddenly a very old smelly man and a very young baby consummated their love
[time=3150] relationship. Eric in an act of total trust, love and submission latest tiny head upon the man's
[time=3158] ragged shoulder. The man's eyes closed and I saw tears hover beneath his lashes. His aged
[time=3165] hands full of grime pain and hard labor gently so gently cradled my baby's bottom and stroked his back.
[time=3172] No two beings have ever loved so deeply for so short a time. I stood awestruck. The old man
[time=3180] rocked and cradled Eric in his arms for a moment and then his eyes opened and set squarely on mine.
[time=3184] He said in a firm commanding voice you take care of this baby. Somehow I managed I will
[time=3192] from a throat that contained a stone. He pried Eric from his chest unwillingly, longingly as though he were in pain. I received my baby and the man said God bless you man.
[time=3203] You've given me the sweetest gift ever. I said nothing more than a muttered thanks
[time=3210] with Eric in my arms. I ran for the car. My husband was wondering why I was crying and holding Eric so tightly and why I was saying my God my God forgive me. For you see I had just witnessed Christ's
[time=3222] love shown through the innocence of a tiny child who saw no sin who made no judgment.
[time=3226] A child who saw a soul and a mother who saw a suit of clothes. I was a Christian who was blind
[time=3234] holding a child who was not. And you know that would be my prayer and that would be my hope
[time=3246] for my own life and for the life of this place, the life of this church. That would be my hope
[time=3253] in my prayer. That the truth that God brings to the heart of Peter in these first 23 verses,
[time=3260] the realization that it's a new day and that no matter what you got taught or what you got told
[time=3266] or what got modeled for you, there is a people and there is a category of people and there is one
[time=3272] category of people. That we set our sights and our hearts on and those people are folks that need to
[time=3278] know and experience and taste and feel the love of God. And to the degree that they're willing
[time=3287] to listen to the degree that they're open to that help to the degree that we would have opportunity to give and extend towards them hands that say you know what come and experience forgiveness,
[time=3299] come and experience life, come and see hope like you've never seen it. It would be my hope and I
[time=3305] think our prayer that this place would begin to see and sense the opportunity that we have
[time=3312] to be that kind of people, to have that kind of heart. And I hope as you think about it,
[time=3318] and as we go into next week, next week basically chapter 10 is one whole message. There was just too much for one morning. Now we get to see Peter's response. We get to see this new truth lived out
[time=3331] and it is an amazing thing to see him go and do what God intended him to do and the very same thing that God intends you and I to do and that is to let the barriers go, let the preconceived judgments go
[time=3342] and offer hope and forgiveness and life in Christ to all as dirty as they might be, as confused as
[time=3349] they might be, but to go and offer it. And so I hope you come back next week as we get into the last
[time=3355] part of chapter 10 and see this amazing new truth begin to take wings in the heart and life of Peter.
[time=3361] Let me ask if you would just stay seated and let me just ask you if you would just pray with me as we conclude our time here this morning. Father, I would just come before you this morning
[time=3372] and ask on behalf of everybody here in this room and everybody who hears my voice
[time=3379] today that there would be a humble willingness and I know this stuff runs deep. I know there's
[time=3389] questions that come to the surface. I know there's yeah butts and what ifs but God I pray that
[time=3395] everybody in this room and those who hear my voice today would be willing to pause maybe even now
[time=3401] and consider what you might have for us to consider. What it is that your spirit would be
[time=3409] teaching us today as we've seen from this text here in Acts 10 Peter and Cornelius two completely different worlds coming together about to come together as barriers were put aside
[time=3421] and preconceived judgments were abandoned and I pray God that in my own heart that you would
[time=3429] continue the work you've been doing these last several days and that anybody in this room that needs some reassessments some readjustments some help in thinking these issues through God that we
[time=3439] would be humble enough and eager enough to ask for whatever help we might need it may just be a discussion with a good friend it may be a family chat later tonight it might mean an appointment
[time=3450] with a pastor but whatever it is father we want to be a church I want this place and I believe our
[time=3456] leadership longs for this place to be a place that is truly a safe place to hear a life-changing
[time=3463] eternity altering message and God it would be our desire to be a safe place for all
[time=3469] for all whoever that might be at whatever point of the journey they might be on
[time=3476] whatever degree of help they might require however much patience might be required God give us the strength give us the perspective and the vision to see it
[time=3488] to see the opportunity and to see people with your eyes with your heart thank you for what you
[time=3495] taught peter we we pray God that we would learn it as well in the days and weeks and months to come
