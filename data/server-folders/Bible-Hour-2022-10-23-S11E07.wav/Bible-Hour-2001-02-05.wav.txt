[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=10] Welcome to the Sunday Morning Worship Service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=14] Thank you for joining us. We trust that the music and message from God's word will help you in your Christian walk. Now let's join our service.
[time=22] Hey, you know what we were thinking about this just this past week?
[time=25] And it dawned on us that every Sunday around this place, there are so many different people who have the privilege of being involved in so many different areas of ministry. A lot of people give their gifts and their talents
[time=40] and their energies, even to things that directly affect these 70 minutes that we share together.
[time=45] Okay, 75 sometimes. A lot of people help make this time what it is.
[time=52] And I know, and as a programming team, we realize that a lot of them really enjoy what they get to contribute, the part that God allows them to play.
[time=61] And so we thought this morning we would just allow you, we're going to take a few minutes here, and just allow you to hear from some folks who take part in different areas of ministry that help make Sunday mornings happen. And we want you to hear just the excitement and the joy and the thanks that they have as they contribute to our times together.
[time=77] And we are going to start with Beth Weil. Where's Beth? Come on down here, Beth.
[time=80] Beth is a part of, as you can tell, the choir. And the question we're asking people this morning is basically this. What do you enjoy most about the opportunity you get to contribute
[time=91] in whatever area you're involved in? What is it that you enjoy? So Beth, tell us about what you enjoy most.
[time=96] Well, I very much enjoyed being a part of choir.
[time=100] I think singing is the way that we can tell God what we feel in our heart.
[time=106] It's our verbal part of worship where we get to say things.
[time=111] I know we could say things otherwise, but you know, we're not all a Steve Longbreak.
[time=116] Yeah, that's true.
[time=118] Also, I, you know, considered a privilege to be in the choir. I'm not a solo voice.
[time=124] I'm just, I'm there because I enjoy singing.
[time=126] Oh, give me a shot. Give me a shot. Go a shot.
[time=129] That's okay. That's okay.
[time=133] So I just, I enjoy it. And it's just, you know, Wednesday nights, seven to eight thirties are practice.
[time=139] We don't necessarily have things memorized. I'm letting out a secret.
[time=143] We have monitors up here with the words on them.
[time=146] So we don't necessarily have to have everything memorized.
[time=151] But it's, it's a nice time. And like I said, you don't have to be a solo voice.
[time=158] They'd like you to be, but it's just a, and for me to the choir, I wasn't in an ABF till this year.
[time=165] So this was even my, my ABF, my place that I clicked into the church.
[time=171] And now I'm in an ABF though too.
[time=174] Good. Thank you. Thank you very much.
[time=177] Who else we got here? Jen. Where's Jen? Jen, come on, come on up. Can you, can you run around here to the front?
[time=182] This is Jen Wilson and Jen Wilson's part of our praise band.
[time=186] And Jen, tell these folks here take this and tell these folks what you enjoy about being a part of Sunday mornings.
[time=192] Well, the praise band to me is the biggest gift that God's given me or at least one of the biggest gifts because that's how I came to know Christ.
[time=201] So when I come every Sunday and I play, it's just a way for me to give back.
[time=205] And it's a way for me to do something just for God.
[time=209] Just me and him when I'm up there. You guys don't mean, sorry.
[time=214] It's, it's me and God when I'm up there. And also, you know, rehearsals with the guys are fun.
[time=218] They pick on me a lot. Kelly picks on me a lot. So that's always, it's always fun to come here and just hang out with the guys.
[time=223] We hang out every Wednesday night and we talk and every now and again we play our instruments and we just have a lot of fun.
[time=228] That's great. Thank you. It's fun picking on you.
[time=232] Who else we got here? Where's Dean? Dean, where are you? There you are.
[time=236] Let me introduce you to Dean Watson. Dean does a lot of stuff behind the scenes.
[time=240] Things that you have no idea take place. He and others on our stage crew make a huge contribution each week.
[time=247] And Dean tell the folks what you enjoy about the opportunity you get on Sunday mornings.
[time=252] I work as part of the stage crew. I enjoy using my talents and gifts to serve and, and to give.
[time=261] And I get to work with Ed and Scott and Rich Liddakey and Ty and it's really a privilege.
[time=268] Yeah, good guys. Thank you Dean.
[time=270] Thank, thank these three so far for what they're doing.
[time=273] Where's Tom? Oh, here's Tom.
[time=277] Here's Tom right here. Tom Baker is one of the guys that works in our technical arena, especially with the cameras.
[time=284] How are you doing there, Tom?
[time=287] And we're thankful, as I know many of you are, many of you have come to our church because you saw us on the Bible Hour.
[time=294] Many of you know people who have come to faith in our Lord because of what they were able to hear on a Sunday morning or a Thursday at noon.
[time=302] And so guys like Tom help make that happen. Tom, tell the folks what you enjoy about doing what you do on Sundays.
[time=309] The answer is coming to see Eric Hall.
[time=312] Okay.
[time=314] That's my final answer.
[time=317] He's got this thing going on in his room.
[time=319] So I don't have monitors to look at, so they have to tell me in my ear what to say.
[time=323] [laughter]
[time=333] Serious load, it is the people. One of the most exciting things is the people that I work with in the ministries.
[time=341] The friendships that you get there, that I wouldn't get somewhere else, people that I meet that I might not meet otherwise, it's just a lot of fun.
[time=349] And the other thing is rarely a week goes by that I don't meet somebody who watches the Bible Hour.
[time=355] And it's really exciting to know that what you're doing is reaching thousands of people on a weekly basis.
[time=363] People that aren't here today but are getting the message that we're giving out today.
[time=369] And that's a tremendous gratification.
[time=373] Absolutely. Last I heard, I think the Bible Hour has seen, last we got told, it was in 16,000 homes in northeast Indiana on a given weekend.
[time=384] So what a great, great opportunity. Who else we got here? Where'd Claire go?
[time=388] All right, Claire, there's Claire.
[time=391] Claire helps serve on Sunday mornings. Here you go, you can hold that.
[time=395] She helps serve on Sunday mornings with the donuts and the juice and the coffee.
[time=399] One of our students jumping in and wanting to be a part. And tell the folks what you enjoy about being involved here, Claire.
[time=405] I enjoy just meeting people and fellowshiping with my Christian friends.
[time=413] And I don't think this could happen without Mrs. Bellar or Mrs. Denny.
[time=419] And I just wanted to thank you guys for having that festival.
[time=424] That's great. That's great. Thank Claire and Jill and Barb for what they do each week.
[time=432] It's a great, it really is a, it's a great opportunity. I hope more and more of us will take advantage of the chance you get each Sunday at 10.
[time=441] I mean the food's there but there's also a chance to meet some people.
[time=444] I think I got one more person. Where'd Marsha go? Marsha's back. Come on down here Marsha.
[time=448] It's kind of fun walking around with this microphone. You know, people who know me, people who really know me this morning aren't looking at me right now.
[time=453] Because they know what I'm capable of with a microphone in my hand and a whole bunch of people.
[time=460] Marsha, Marsha back here is here. You can hold that. Marsha along with her husband Bill are one of the many that stand out in the front and greet you each and every morning.
[time=469] And I know they enjoy that immensely. I know they take it as we do very seriously.
[time=474] And we're so thankful that they do what they do. Marsha, tell the folks what you enjoy about your chance to greet.
[time=480] Oh, I just enjoy the greeter ministry. It's great. It gives me an opportunity to stand at the store every Sunday and greet the people that come through the store.
[time=491] And for me, I have had the opportunity of making all sorts of friends because they come through the door every Sunday and they are my friend and that's wonderful.
[time=500] I think another part of it is knowing that when we have a visitor come in that as a greeter, I may be one of those first people.
[time=509] They get an opportunity to welcome them to Black Hawk and to our worship and the excitement in this auditorium is just great.
[time=516] When you're standing in the back and everyone stands up to worship and sing and it's just a great feeling and I'm thrilled to be part of the ministry.
[time=525] And I'm so glad. Thank you so much. Give these folks a hand and thank them for what they do.
[time=530] It is, there's many more we could talk to, people who help make these mornings.
[time=539] And again, in their heart, and in my heart, and as we think of these times together, the object is that we could come together and worship.
[time=547] And worship him in a way that would be pleasing to him and so that's what it's time to do this morning.
[time=553] It's time for us to worship and I hope your hearts are ready.
[time=583] The Son of God is King of Christ.
[time=594] Jesus, redemption sacrificed.
[time=605] Now glorify, now magnify, is King of Christ.
[time=618] And this King of God will know the end.
[time=630] For the majesty and power of this King of King has come.
[time=642] And this King of God's reign, and this King of God's reign, and this King of God's reign.
[time=656] Jesus, that's righteousness we need.
[time=669] Jesus, expression of God's love.
[time=680] The grace of God, the word of God, revealed to us.
[time=693] Jesus, that's all he has to say.
[time=703] Now glorify, now magnify, is King of God.
[time=715] And this King of God will know the end.
[time=727] For the majesty and power of this King of King has come.
[time=738] And this King of Christ will know the end.
[time=758] Just stand and join us now in that last chorus, and this King will know the end.
[time=769] And this King of God will know the end, and this glory shall know the end.
[time=775] For the majesty and power of this King of King has come.
[time=786] And this King of God's reign, and this King of God's reign, and this King of God's power, and this glory shall know the end.
[time=799] Jesus, that's righteousness we need.
[time=837] In Acts chapter 10, the second half of the chapter that Kelly is going to be preaching on here in just a few minutes.
[time=843] The Apostle Peter has a change of perspective that happens to him, what we might call today in modern business circles.
[time=850] He has a paradigm shift, has the same information, the same God, but he sees it in a new way.
[time=857] And we wanted to kind of give you a visual representation of what that might be like.
[time=861] So we have an illustration here we're going to show on the screens, and I need to ask you, for some of you, I'm sure you've seen this before, and just kind of ask you to humor me, pretend like it's new, just for my own sake.
[time=872] So here's what's going to happen, I'm going to show a picture up on the screens to just this side of the audience.
[time=877] So I need all of you over here, and on this side of the balcony to close your eyes.
[time=881] Then we'll switch, and I'll show a picture to just this side of the audience here, and of course, I need everybody that's on this side of the audience to close your eyes to that one, and then I'll just kind of lead you from there, and we'll see how this turns out.
[time=893] Any confusion? All right. So I need this side over here, everybody just close your eyes.
[time=899] And this side over here, you can keep your eyes open, and we're going to put a picture up on the screen here.
[time=904] Like I said, I'm sure some of you have seen this before, so just humor me.
[time=907] Okay, get a good look. You see what you're looking at?
[time=910] Got a mouth, an eye, head. Everybody with me? Okay, we're going to go back to black now.
[time=916] You guys can open your eyes. This side over here, play along, you all close your eyes now.
[time=922] And you got your eyes closed? Okay, and we're going to show a picture to you guys up here.
[time=927] Okay, you see we got a picture there, we got an eye, we got a face, head.
[time=932] Get a good look over here. Okay, we can go black there. All right, now everybody can open their eyes.
[time=940] We're going to show a picture to you here in just a second, and I want you just to think about what you see.
[time=944] So let's go ahead and put that other picture up now. There we go.
[time=948] Look at this one, and if we had a chance, I'd interview about what you see.
[time=953] But I'm making a guess that this side over here, that is seeing an old lady in this picture.
[time=961] I'm just making a bet that this side over here is seeing the old lady in the picture.
[time=964] And I'm making that this side over here for the Mars part, is seeing a young lady in the picture, if we were to interview you.
[time=970] Because, when I showed you the picture, I showed you two different pictures.
[time=974] This side over here is seeing the old lady, the little, sees the mouth down at the bottom there, that little black part.
[time=981] And then it's seeing a little chin and a nose kind of coming down.
[time=984] But this side over here, instead of seeing that, it's kind of seeing the young lady here.
[time=990] Instead of being a mouth, you see a necklace and an eyes, and you kind of get the picture.
[time=994] Let's put that combined one back up. And you kind of see a picture based on where you're at.
[time=1000] You kind of get it, you see a young lady, or an old lady, depending on which picture I showed you.
[time=1006] Everybody kind of got both, either the mouth or a necklace down here, nose or eyes in the background.
[time=1013] Everybody kind of get it.
[time=1016] We'll leave it up here for a second for everybody to catch up.
[time=1021] We did this on Wednesday night and we thought it was kind of interesting.
[time=1024] Here's the whole point behind it.
[time=1026] The whole point that I found amazing is this, and we can go ahead and.
[time=1031] Isn't it amazing how what we see right now is based on what we saw in the past?
[time=1045] And you know, it's not just true of this picture, it's true of our picture of God as well.
[time=1050] What we see about God sometimes is based on what we saw of God in the past.
[time=1055] And really limited sometimes to what we saw of God in the past.
[time=1059] Peter in Acts chapter 10 had what we call a paradigm shift.
[time=1063] The same God, but a new way of seeing it.
[time=1070] Let me pray, Kelli will come up and teach us about that passage.
[time=1074] Father God, I just pray today, as Kelli comes up to open the word of God to us this morning,
[time=1083] that you would open our eyes and help us to see a bigger picture of you.
[time=1087] Help us to see everything that you want us to have.
[time=1091] And God, help us not to limit you to just what we've seen of you in the past.
[time=1095] But just as Peter had the same God, but the new way of seeing it, help us to do the same thing this morning.
[time=1103] May the words that Kelli has to say to us bring honor and glory to your name.
[time=1107] I just pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=1111] Thanks, Eric. Great, great job.
[time=1115] What a great illustration. What a great picture. And it takes us right to where we were last week and where we will continue.
[time=1121] This week in our study of Acts chapter 10, if you've got your Bibles, open up to Acts chapter 10 this morning versus 23 to 48.
[time=1130] And if you don't have a Bible, no problem. You can follow along on the screens or maybe someone nearby might want to share a look with you.
[time=1138] What we saw last week was this. What we saw last week was that due to tradition and prejudice, Peter and the Jews had always viewed God's heart and His plan in a very narrow and specific light.
[time=1151] Their paradigm, if you will, their perspective, the grid through which they viewed, lived and worshiped, said one thing and one thing only.
[time=1161] It said this way. It said this way, our way. The way it's always been. This way, our way. The way it's always been is how they viewed, how they lived and worshiped God.
[time=1174] And it is here in our study of Acts 10 that we see God beginning to reshape and refocus and alter and adjust their vision.
[time=1184] He's helping them see and sense his own heart. Hear that now. Understand that. He is helping them and I think he is beginning to help us see and sense his own heart and how it longs to have everyone exposed to his hope, his love and his people.
[time=1204] Red, yellow, black and white, like the song says. Sick and healthy, the rich, the poor, those struggling with their sexuality, those who have succeeded and those who have failed miserably.
[time=1216] Last week he told Peter and he told us here at Blackhawk, no longer prejudge.
[time=1224] He said to Peter, he showed Peter, no longer prejudge. He says to us, no longer consider unholy, that which I have cleansed.
[time=1233] No longer consider unholy, no longer keep your distance from, no longer detach yourself from, no longer keep at arm's length, those who I have given my life for.
[time=1245] No, embrace them. Embrace them. What God led Peter through in last week's passage and what he continues to expose him to as this chapter unfolds and concludes this morning, changes the way Peter sees everything.
[time=1263] Have you ever had that happen to you? Have you ever had an experience? Have you ever had something happen to you? Have you ever seen something, been through something, endured something that completely changed you?
[time=1279] Completely changed the way you viewed life, the way you viewed family, the way you viewed friends, the way you viewed your future?
[time=1289] Some here in this room this morning have lost jobs and gotten new ones and lost them and gotten new ones and lost them.
[time=1299] Some here this morning have an appreciation for a job that they never knew existed.
[time=1306] Some of you in this room this morning have lost your children. Some in this room have lost kids.
[time=1315] Some in this room have lost spouses, people they loved dearly.
[time=1321] And you today are a different person and you will never take for granted again.
[time=1329] The touch and the sight of one you love.
[time=1335] Some of you have witnessed in your lifetime atrocities.
[time=1341] Attrocities that have forever changed the way you view people.
[time=1345] Some have endured enormous trial, painful trials.
[time=1350] And it changes the way you see. It changes your vision.
[time=1357] I didn't lose a child. I didn't lose a good friend, didn't witness an atrocity, but about a year ago I had my eyes lasered.
[time=1366] I had laseic surgery about a year ago. It's a process whereby the dead and tissue at the tip of the cornea is removed, shaved off by a laser.
[time=1374] The eye is then reshaped. And I can't tell you what an absolute and utter difference it made.
[time=1382] I didn't realize. I had been that way for years and I had no idea what I was missing. You have no idea how great it is to wake up in the morning.
[time=1391] And if you wear glasses or contacts you'll identify with this. I could see the alarm clock.
[time=1397] That first morning it was a beautiful moment looking across the bed over to the dresser and seeing the digital clock in just as clear as day.
[time=1406] I can actually watch my ball now, my golf ball. I can actually watch it go out of bounds instead of assume where it went.
[time=1413] It's really hard. I've got to be much more honest now when I golf because I actually saw my ball go out of bounds.
[time=1420] You see features on my kids' faces. Remember the first couple of weeks walking around looking at my kids from a distance and thinking,
[time=1427] "Man, you mean leaves on trees and limbs that didn't know existed?" I mean it's an amazing thing to have your vision reshaped.
[time=1436] To have it adjusted to the point where you see things you didn't used to see.
[time=1440] Peter's heart last week got lasered. It got reshaped.
[time=1447] And the gospel and the church and the ministry which God had called them to now had a new clearer vision.
[time=1454] Did you think about it at all this week? Those of you who are here last week, did you give some thought to it this week?
[time=1462] Did you consider it all in your own life and your own heart maybe even in the life of our own church?
[time=1466] Give any thought to the pre-judging that has been modeled and instilled in you over the years.
[time=1473] Give any thought to the pre-judging that maybe even goes on in this place on a weekly basis?
[time=1480] I did. I gave it some thought. Thought about it a lot.
[time=1484] And I'm of the opinion this morning as I stand here before you.
[time=1487] I believe we could in some ways benefit from a vision adjustment.
[time=1491] A vision alteration. A change maybe in the way we view certain people.
[time=1497] A change maybe in the way we view this place and the scope of its ministry.
[time=1502] A change possibly in the way we view the heart of God as it relates to this world that he's placed us in called us to interact with.
[time=1512] Commissioned us to proclaim a message of hope to.
[time=1517] Maybe there's a change in store and I'd like us to just simply this morning read through this passage together.
[time=1523] And as we do simply make some observations along the way.
[time=1527] As Peter followed the Lord, folks, as Peter followed the Lord and allowed his own heart and vision for ministry to be expanded, there were some things he did.
[time=1539] There were some responses that he had. There was a way that he carried himself in this process that we need to be reminded of this morning.
[time=1548] So let's take a look. What do you say at this last half of chapter 10 in the book of Acts?
[time=1554] We're going to pick it up. Acts 10, we're going to pick it up this morning at verse 23.
[time=1559] Acts 10, 23. Let's read down through verse 27 initially. Okay, you there, here we go.
[time=1565] And so he, Peter, invited them in. Remember these men now have come.
[time=1569] Men have come from the house of Cornelius. Cornelius had the vision last week whereby God called Cornelius to send some of his men to read.
[time=1577] Some of his men to retrieve Peter and bring him back. Cornelius being a Gentile. Peter being a Jew.
[time=1583] This was a new day, a new truth, a new way of doing things. And God was at work.
[time=1587] And so these men come to where Peter is in Japah. And so he invites them in verse 23 and he gave them lodging.
[time=1593] And on the next day he arose and went away with them and some of the brethren from Japah accompanied him.
[time=1600] And on the following day he entered Caesarea. Now Cornelius was waiting for them and had called together his relatives and close friends.
[time=1608] And when it came about that Peter entered Cornelius met him and fell at his feet and worshiped him.
[time=1615] But Peter raised him up saying, "Stand up. Stand up. I too am just a man."
[time=1623] And as he talked with him he entered and found many people assembled.
[time=1629] First of all what we see here folks is this as he followed Christ as he gave himself to ministry as his heart and mind were expanded.
[time=1638] In this new arena of God's work people Peter remained humble. Write it down. Peter remained humble.
[time=1648] He says to Cornelius and says, "What are you bowing to me for? What are you doing? You and I are on equal ground."
[time=1661] He in essence says, "Get up." Now you know as well as I that Peter could easily have basked and reveled in Cornelius's worship.
[time=1671] I mean to have people adore you, to have people say nice things to you, to have people lift you up as it were on a pedestal.
[time=1678] There's part of that that would have been enticing to him I know yet his realization of his own sin, his realization of his own weaknesses kept him humble.
[time=1687] He knew himself too well.
[time=1690] He said, "Get up. You and I? You Gentile? Me, the Jew? No, no, no. It's a new day." He says, "We are on equal ground."
[time=1703] How about you? How about me? How about us as a church? What kind of atmosphere? Think about this now.
[time=1712] In your own world, in your own personal life, and in the life of this place, what kind of atmosphere exists in this room on a regular basis?
[time=1722] What type of climate do those on the outside looking in bump into when they come through those doors every week?
[time=1730] What do they sense? What do they feel? What do they hear? What is the experience of those on the outside looking in?
[time=1737] And they may be on the outside looking in for a number of different reasons. I mean they just might be new.
[time=1745] I mean they just might be guests. Or as we noted last week, they may be of a different socio-economic class.
[time=1754] They may be of a different race. They may be of a different background. There may be a lot that's different about people who come through those doors each week, but as they come through those doors and they do, what do they bump into?
[time=1768] What do they sense and feel and hear as we interact or don't with them?
[time=1778] How many of you here this morning, and I mentioned this earlier, and I'm going to mention it again, I mean how many of you maybe could stand to give a little bit more effort, give a little bit more energy, even with respect to the 10 o'clock time.
[time=1791] 10 o'clock we've got 30 minutes. I mean there's an atmosphere made to order for you and for me.
[time=1796] How many of you are going to great lengths and stopping at nothing to be here at 10 to grab a cup of coffee and juice and look for somebody you don't know who you can say.
[time=1807] Hello to introduce yourself to. Make feel welcome.
[time=1812] And you may not recognize them and you may go up to them and introduce yourself and they may have been here for five years, but it doesn't matter because you get a chance to extend a hand.
[time=1822] You get a chance to help cultivate an atmosphere that says you know what, whoever you are, I'm just glad you're here.
[time=1829] Let's talk for a few minutes. A church full of people. Don't miss this.
[time=1836] A church full of people aware of their own weaknesses willing to embrace others despite theirs has a chance.
[time=1844] A church full of people aware, deeply aware of their own weaknesses and limitations willing to embrace others despite theirs has a chance, a chance to reflect, I believe, the heart of God.
[time=1857] That he continues to expose to us right here in Acts 10. Remember, no one. Remember this, no one. Not me, not you, no one.
[time=1867] No one is more or less important in this place than the next. Nobody.
[time=1876] It's like the children's treehouse that had these words scribbled on its wall. I love this. Nobody act big. Nobody act small. Everybody just act medium.
[time=1891] Isn't that a great truth? Isn't that a great picture? Just act medium. Everybody the same. Peter remained humble. He remained humble. Look at verse 28 on down through verse 33.
[time=1910] And he said to them, here they are. They're gathered in Cornelius' place. Peter walks in. He sees people assembled. And he said to them, verse 28, you yourselves know how unlawful it is for a man who is a Jew, me, to associate with a foreigner or to visit him, you.
[time=1929] And yet God has shown me. He says there. And yet God has shown me that I should not call any man unholy or unclean. That is why I came without even raising any objection when I was sent for.
[time=1942] And so I asked for what reason you have sent for me. And Cornelius, verse 30, said four days ago to this hour, I was praying in my house during the ninth hour and behold, a man stood before me in signing garments. And he said Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God.
[time=1960] Send therefore to Japa and invite Simon, who was also called Peter to come to you. He is staying at the house of Simon the Tanner by the sea. And so I sent to you immediately. And you have been kind enough to come.
[time=1975] Now then we are all here, present before God, to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord. You know what he does here in this passage right here, this section?
[time=1988] First of all, he remained humble. Now he remains honest. Now he remains honest. Peter remained humble. And now we see him exercising honesty. What do we mean by that? Well, think about it.
[time=2005] All right, just think about it for a moment. Think about the situation that this man finds himself in for the first time in his entire life.
[time=2013] Do you realize how insecure and how uncomfortable and how out of his element, Peter must have felt standing in the home of a Gentile?
[time=2022] Remember what we talked about last week. There was absolutely no love between these people. There were hundreds of years, traditions of hate and dislike.
[time=2031] And Peter, the apostle of all apostles, finds himself in the home of a Gentile with a bunch of other Gentiles who have now been invited and gathered.
[time=2042] So you know what? He simply comes out and he says it. And I admire him for that. That's what that verse 28 is all about. Look back there.
[time=2055] You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a man who is a Jew to associate with a foreigner or to visit him.
[time=2060] Yet God has shown me that I should not call any man unholy or unclean. You know what he is saying there?
[time=2064] He, in essence, is saying this. You all know. He stands there in this room and he looks at all these people and says, you all know, I realize, that this is a little new for me.
[time=2074] It's a big step, he says, for me. But I'm trying. It's as if he looks from the eye and says, I'm trying. I'm giving it my best.
[time=2083] So be patient with me, please, and I'll do what I can to tell you what God's put on my heart. No pretense people. No facades.
[time=2091] Just honest interaction with a pure, sweet motive. What was it? Better fellowship.
[time=2098] Richard fellowship. More unified fellowship. A greater sense of we. A lesser, decreasing sense of I.
[time=2108] And so out of a motive for harmony and unity and fellowship, he just honestly says, I'm going to give this my best shot.
[time=2117] You know, I know this is a bit uncomfortable, but you know what? Here I go.
[time=2123] Now, what would that look like for you? What would that look like for you and me today here in this place as we mingle in the foyer or cross paths with others in the parking lot?
[time=2137] I mean, how can we apply this kind of honesty and this commitment to no facades and no pretense, motivation, Richard fellowship?
[time=2146] Well, here's what it doesn't look like. Okay, in my opinion. And I'll say that. And this is just my own little commentary here.
[time=2155] In my opinion, I don't think it necessarily needs to look like or sound like this.
[time=2162] I don't think that you or I need to find someone of a different race and apologize for the way mine has acted or you apologize to me for the way yours has acted because I think in doing that now we've made it about race.
[time=2176] And it isn't about race.
[time=2179] I don't think we need to go looking for opportunities to get into social discussions and debate. No, I don't think that's what this kind of honesty is after.
[time=2188] I don't think I or you need to track someone down in the parking lot who's dressed a lot nicer and say, hey, I noticed how much nicer you look than I do.
[time=2196] Just wanted you to know, no hard feelings.
[time=2201] I don't think that's it. I don't think that's what he's after. I don't think we'd go up to someone and say, hey, I heard you were unemployed.
[time=2209] And since I'm not, let's go to lunch and I'll buy.
[time=2213] No, I don't think that's it either.
[time=2217] I think that this honesty is seen and experienced when whoever you are and whatever you look like and however you're dressed and whatever the color of your skin may be.
[time=2234] When you walk up to and or I walk up to and we walk up to each other and do this.
[time=2241] Hi.
[time=2245] I want you to know how nice it is to meet you. I'm Kelly and we've never talked.
[time=2252] And I just felt like God was laying it on my heart to just tell you how happy I am that we get to be a part of this together.
[time=2261] What's your name? Where are you from? Where do you work? Tell me about your family.
[time=2268] Just the honest extending of a hand with eyes and heart that say, you know what, I'm so glad we're in this together and I'd love to get to know you better.
[time=2277] Skin color, job situation, family, what ever.
[time=2282] Going to cross over some barriers and going to extend a hand for the sweet purpose of richer, deeper fellowship.
[time=2292] He remained humble. He remained honest.
[time=2297] Look at verse 34.
[time=2300] Look at verse 34 down through 43 and opening his mouth. Here he goes.
[time=2304] And opening his mouth. Peter said, I most certainly understand now that God is not one to show partiality.
[time=2312] Let me make a side note there if I can, okay?
[time=2314] If you go back to look how many verses, bless his heart. Peter's a good guy. He's just a little thick sometimes.
[time=2320] We're in 30, where are we? 34. Look back at 16.
[time=2324] And this happened, the sheet coming down, the animals, the whole thing, no longer consider unholy, that which I have cleansed.
[time=2330] We're 16. Back there, God had to take him through it three times.
[time=2334] And then 17 now while Peter was greatly perplexed in mind, he still didn't get it.
[time=2339] And he goes through all that we've read already and finally now in 34, here we go.
[time=2343] I most certainly understand now. Now he gets it.
[time=2348] Now it's like the nickel drops and the light goes on. The vision is clear.
[time=2352] But God is not one to show partiality. But in every nation, the man who fears him and does what is right is welcome to him.
[time=2358] The word which he sent to the sons of Israel, preaching peace through Jesus Christ.
[time=2363] He is Lord of all. You yourselves know the thing which took place throughout all Judea, starting from Galilee after the baptism, which John proclaimed.
[time=2372] You know of Jesus, of Nazareth, how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power, and how he went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil for God was with him, verse 39.
[time=2384] And we are witnesses of all the things he did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem.
[time=2390] And they also put him to death by hanging him on a cross.
[time=2394] And God raised him up on the third day and granted that he should become visible, not to all the people but to the witnesses who were chosen beforehand by God, that is to us, who ate and drank with him after he arose from the dead.
[time=2410] And he ordered us to preach to the people. Watch this. Can you see Peter in this house with these Gentiles saying this?
[time=2417] And he ordered us to preach to proclaim truth to the people and solemnly to testify that this is the one who has been appointed by God as judge of the living and the dead, of him all the prophets bear witness that through his name, everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins.
[time=2439] So in his moment, having humbled himself, having remained honest, in his moment when the time comes, he opens his mouth and what comes out?
[time=2453] Truth. Truth.
[time=2457] Number three, he remained faithful to the truth people. And I hope you see, and if you don't, let me try and help you.
[time=2465] I mean, do you understand how absolutely necessary, how vitally important it is that he would have done that and that you and I would remain faithful to that same endeavor, being faithful to speak when given opportunities such as this, being faithful to speak and live out the truth.
[time=2486] You see, so many people, you guys, so many people and so many ministries today who have this enormous commitment to open their arms and their churches to all have failed to embrace this all important third point.
[time=2504] So many people have missed this. They want to, you see, and we understand why we don't fault them for this.
[time=2509] They want so desperately to provide safe settings for everyone. They want an atmosphere that promotes diversity. They want a place that would be inclusive.
[time=2519] They want a place full of all kinds of people. And when they get them and they do, what happens is they back down.
[time=2527] Back down from what? They back down from the truth.
[time=2532] And so what started out good and what started out healthy, I mean, all I've just said about these people and ministries that want so badly to be inclusive of all.
[time=2542] I mean, that's what we've been saying for the past two weeks now, but we get to a point here where the road divides and what happens tragically so many times is the truth is not held up.
[time=2553] They back down. They allow truth to be what? Relative. They say welcome one and all. And whatever truth is to you, fantastic, let truth be that for you.
[time=2564] And if it's this for you, that's fine. And whatever truth is for you, great.
[time=2569] Because truth is whatever you want it to be. They stand for nothing.
[time=2574] Acceptance and celebrating uniqueness. You've heard those phrases.
[time=2580] Acceptance and celebrating individuals uniquenesses.
[time=2584] Those things are elevated over and above. Loving invitations to repent.
[time=2590] Held up over and above, God's call upon all to trust and obey.
[time=2597] To trust Him and His word to obey His design. Not theirs. His design for life and living.
[time=2606] All of that is sidestepped in an effort to offend no one and allow everyone to feel as if they are being true to themselves as if anyone left to themselves could even muster a clue when it comes to life and living.
[time=2625] Somebody wrote me a note this past week, and it was with reference to the drama that we portrayed here on this stage last Sunday.
[time=2635] And it wasn't signed, and I usually almost always just pitch letters that aren't signed.
[time=2641] Just so you know, you want to write me a letter? I'll read it, sign it.
[time=2644] For some reason I broke my rule. And this, back this one, was left on my car.
[time=2649] And I read the note, and it was asking if, basically, if last week's drama meant that practicing homosexuals and Roman Catholics could now find a home at Blackhawk while feeling no need to change.
[time=2664] If you were here, we'd depicted a drama whereby, and I won't get into it all, but we made the point. We were trying to make the point that at the foot of the cross, as the drama said, the ground is even.
[time=2681] And the point there was that we are certainly hoping and wanting to see people of all kinds come to the cross.
[time=2690] And so this individual asks the question, does it mean now that Roman Catholics, we had the gal who came up on stage and she had the science in Catholic and she was rubbing her beets?
[time=2700] There was another gal who came on stage with a sign that said gay, and there were some others who joined a pious one on stage, and it was a great interaction.
[time=2711] If you missed it, you should get the video. Somebody should tape the Bible hour and get a copy and look at it. It's a great, great illustration.
[time=2718] Well, here's what I told him. I responded back and tracked down, actually happened to find out who it was, and it was a good situation. It's no big deal and we had a nice chat.
[time=2729] And what I told him was this, we are giving ourselves, and you've got to hear this. I mean, this is a great reminder for you and for me.
[time=2737] We are giving our days, people. We are giving our lives around this place on a daily basis, in an effort to help seekers what? Say it.
[time=2750] Say it again. We are giving our lives. We are planning ministries. We are prayerfully considering all that we do with one singular endeavor to help seekers, both saved and searching, find and follow Christ.
[time=2766] Period. That, I reminded this individual, was our sole endeavor. We are trying to help seekers find. We are trying to help people.
[time=2777] Searching for answers, come to a point where they can put a stake in the ground, draw a line in the sand and say, "That's it. I have found home. I have found Jesus Christ.
[time=2786] I hear by commit and surrender my life and my will to Him. We are trying to help people find Christ. We are trying to help people having found Him.
[time=2796] Learn what it means to follow Him in the everyday of life, to learn what it means to obey Him in His Word, to learn what it means and looks like to grow in their full devotion.
[time=2808] They're full devotion to Him as their Lord and Savior. And I told this individual this, and I'll say it again this morning to you. We will go hear me now.
[time=2818] We will go out of our way. I personally, you personally, I hope, we will as a church go out of our way to provide for all of those people.
[time=2829] Everyone listed in this drama last week, the two individual groups of people referred to in this note, we will go out of our way to provide for them a safe setting so that they could hear a dangerous, life-changing, eternity-altering message.
[time=2852] We will go out of our way to do and provide that. You see, Peter got these people in a room and having lovingly and graciously and with humility interacted with them.
[time=2864] He told them the truth. And the last line of that drama last week, I'll say it again, was the ground is even at the foot of the cross.
[time=2876] So I told the individual who wrote the note are gay people and practicing Roman Catholics. Welcome here at Blackhawk. Absolutely if what they're open to or interested in is coming to the cross.
[time=2891] If there's a glimmer of hope for that, if there's any interest indicated, any possibility that our loving arms might in embracing them, bring them closer to Jesus Christ and a line in the sand and a future with Him.
[time=2905] Absolutely. They're welcome. And we will provide for them a safe setting. And if that's what's on your heart today, if that's what's on your heart, if your search is still intense, if your questions are still many, and if there is an inkling of wonderment or question in your life as to what it means to be loved and forgiven, to live in a relationship with a living God,
[time=2933] then we will go out of our way. We will stop at nothing to help you get there. Whoever you are, wherever you've been, whatever you've done.
[time=2945] Amen. And please don't miss those three things. Whoever you are, wherever you've been, whatever you've done, if there is a hope, if there is an interest, if there is a curiosity, if there is a beating desire, wherever you are on that scale,
[time=2962] we want to help you get home. Now, listen, please, if what you want is a safe place to feel good about your sin, your false religion, or your life of disobedience, you simply won't like it here.
[time=2977] It won't work. And not because I won't let it work or we won't let it work, but you know what, if that's your heart, if that's what you're feeling, if that's where you're at, you know what, when you're living a lie, the truth just hurts.
[time=2995] And it will be too uncomfortable. And you'll leave. So the individual I was talking to said, okay, good, that's good, good, he said good for you, so you will make them feel uncomfortable. And I said, wait a minute.
[time=3010] Hold on. See, you're not tracking with me. I didn't say that. Last I read this, I wasn't in charge of making anybody feel uncomfortable. Last I read this, I think that was under job description for the Holy Spirit, who I'm not.
[time=3029] No, no, no, I said what we're going to do is we are going to teach this, and we are going to do it lovingly. We are going to do it at those doors in a way that says, come in, the lights on.
[time=3040] We're going to do it in a way that says, you know what, no matter where you've been, who you are, what you've done, you are welcomed if what you're interested in is understanding more of the truth.
[time=3049] And we will, I said, we will do that. The uncomfortable part, the no, this isn't for me. It's not my job. It's the Holy Spirit's job. And we'll let him do that.
[time=3060] And will you, will you, will all of you give your hearts and your days and your lives to helping us do this? Helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=3074] Well, what happens? Boy, what happens when the truth is proclaimed by humble, honest, faithful to the truth, individuals?
[time=3088] What takes place, time and time again, look at verse 44. What a sweet ending to a great chapter. Here you have it, while Peter was still speaking these words, don't miss that, before he even got done, you guys.
[time=3103] He wasn't even finished. While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who were listening to the message. Holy Spirit falls upon.
[time=3114] Holy Spirit comes and takes up residence, which means according to our New Testament, they got what? They got saved.
[time=3122] And all the circumcised believers who had come with Peter converted Jews were amazed because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out upon the Gentiles also.
[time=3133] It's as if they stood there and with one voice kind of said, you know what? It's really going to happen. I mean, he's doing it. We're doing this.
[time=3142] We're coming together. They couldn't believe it.
[time=3146] Verse 46, "For they were hearing them, for they were hearing them speaking with tongues and exalting God, then Peter answered, surely no one can refuse the water for these to be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit just as we did. Can he?"
[time=3160] And he ordered them to be baptized. What a great sight. He ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, then they asked him to stay on for a few days. Gentiles, without God, without hope, without promise, without relationship, without forgiveness.
[time=3185] A people who had grown up and who had lived apart from God. And God moves in the heart of this apostle Peter, and he lasers his heart, gives him a whole new perspective.
[time=3201] And I hope and I pray that as he has worked in the heart of Peter and as he has changed and altered his vision, I just hope and pray.
[time=3214] And I'll keep, and many of us around here will keep hoping and praying that your vision and our vision and the way we respond and the way we react and the way we think and the hands that we extend.
[time=3228] We hope and we pray that we'll continue to grow and expand, and that this would be a place full of people who are very aware of our own weaknesses, our own sin, our own limitations, who are willing to embrace others despite theirs, knowing that in the embracing, we have a chance.
[time=3249] We have a chance to truly reflect the heart of God. And that is something that I'll raise my hand for and say, "Count me in. I'll give my days. I'll give my years. I'll give my heart and life to a place that's committed to that."
[time=3265] And I hope you would as well. Let's bow in a word of prayer. Stand if you would.
[time=3276] And you know, as you stand in, let me just take a minute. We've got a couple left. And if you would, just bow your heads.
[time=3281] Just bow your heads and please, just quietly there. Just close your eyes.
[time=3286] And you know, we can't leave a morning like this, I don't think.
[time=3291] A time when we've been able to sing and lift up our praises as we did, even in the midst of that time, being reminded as we were of who he is and what he's done and what he longs for.
[time=3304] And you come into a time like this in these last 40 minutes or so and to open up the Scriptures and to see in God's Word the truth.
[time=3314] And I know that many in the room this morning are here and they have crossed over that line of faith.
[time=3321] And your exposure to the truth each week is for you a refreshing, sometimes convicting reminder of what you know to be right.
[time=3329] And perhaps in some way this time together, our time together here has rejuvenated and inspired you all over again to fully trust and place your faith and live by faith and live in a way that's different as you give yourself to God's purposes in your life.
[time=3347] But you know what there are others in the room and I know you're here. You're here every week. More and more of you come each and every week and you are here because you have heard.
[time=3356] And you have witnessed it. You know that Blackhawk today is a safe place for you to hear a message that cuts deep.
[time=3365] And so you come and this morning I just want to give you a chance. I want to give you an opportunity to do what you may be absolutely ready to do.
[time=3374] And that is to enter into the family of God, to enter into a personal relationship with a living God that brings forgiveness and hope and promise like you've never known.
[time=3385] It brings purpose to life. It is what you were made for. Relationship with God. Not a belief in God. Not a mental assent that he's there.
[time=3396] No, a personal knowing of him made possible by the death of God's Son, Jesus Christ, on your behalf.
[time=3405] And so if you're ready this morning, I mean there may be some questions still yet unanswered, but you know in your heart that this morning,
[time=3412] the time is right in the moment is here for you to simply submit and surrender your will to him.
[time=3418] I want to give you, we want to give you a chance to do that. And so if you would, if you want to, if you're ready to,
[time=3424] all it would take is you simply and privately and quietly just in your own heart to yourself, repeating this kind of communique to him.
[time=3434] Just say these words silently to yourself. Dear gracious loving and heavenly Father, I know that I'm a sinner.
[time=3444] In other words, I know that I am imperfect. And I know that my imperfection in my sin leaves me separated from you.
[time=3454] And God, I know because I've learned that you're holy and you're righteous and you're without sin. And I want God so desperately to be in relationship with you,
[time=3466] to have my sins forgiven, to have purpose in my days, to know what it means to have hope for eternal life.
[time=3476] And so this morning right here, Father, I confess my sin to you. And then confessing it, I also thank you for the death of your son on my behalf.
[time=3486] I realize I was unworthy of that kind of sacrificial action. Oh Father, thank you for hearing my prayer.
[time=3495] Thank you for your amazing grace and your tender mercies.
