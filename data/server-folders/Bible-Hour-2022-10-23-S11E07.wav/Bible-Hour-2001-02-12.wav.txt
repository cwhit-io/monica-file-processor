[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=10] Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=14] Thank you for joining us.
[time=16] We trust that the music and message from God's word will help you in your Christian walk.
[time=20] Now let's join our service.
[time=22] [MUSIC - 29 seconds]
[time=80] What a sweet, sweet time already.
[time=83] Thank you so much for being here.
[time=85] It's great to be able to share this kind of time together in this morning.
[time=89] We're going to take just a few minutes and all of what you're about to hear and what we're about to kind of experience here has a lot to do with where we find ourselves this morning in our study of the Book of Acts.
[time=100] And if you've been around at all these last several weeks, you know that our study of the Book of Acts it's brought us to a point in the life of the church and specifically in the life of our favorite apostle so far, Peter.
[time=116] We have come to a point in time where God has been drastically changing him,
[time=122] his heart, his view of the world, his view of ministry, his own view of God.
[time=128] And in doing so we realize that God is at the very same time changing the church.
[time=134] And with God comes change.
[time=137] And many of you, if not most of you in this room this morning, are very aware of the fact that change is something that's very, very difficult.
[time=146] It's difficult in every arena of life.
[time=149] It is extremely challenging sometimes when we have to face change within the body of Christ.
[time=155] And so we thought it might be interesting and helpful and maybe even for some, an encouraging reminder if we just grab some folks from our own family.
[time=163] And we've done that and we've invited them to come this morning.
[time=166] And we're just going to kind of have, we're going to have a dialogue here.
[time=170] And we've kind of basically asked them to respond to one general question and that is this.
[time=177] How is it? What has God taught you?
[time=180] What has He shown you? What truth or principle is there out there that God has used to kind of help you endure change in the church well?
[time=192] And we've pretty much defined well as they're still here.
[time=198] And so that's a good thing.
[time=200] And I wanted to just, Marianne Gibson, I wanted to ask you if you would start us out.
[time=205] Marianne shared something, we met this morning.
[time=207] And she shared some things about what church was like when she started going to church.
[time=212] Not even necessarily here, but back when she was a girl.
[time=217] Marianne, tell the folks, describe for them that picture of what church was like for you as you remember it.
[time=224] Well, church really started changing for me about 35 years ago.
[time=229] And up until then, I was born and raised in a church that definitely preached the gospel.
[time=235] It was doctrinally sound, but it was very formal.
[time=239] And so when I went to church as a child and an adult, church meant I knew just what was going to happen.
[time=245] The choir would come in and they would sing the call to worship and then we would stand and sing the doxology.
[time=251] Following that would probably be an anthem by the choir, which would be then followed by a pastoral prayer,
[time=258] which would be followed by a sevenfold amen.
[time=261] And of course there would be the sermon and then a formal benediction by our pastor and then a formal coral benediction.
[time=269] And we were taught from very tiny up that when we came to God's house, the sanctuary for our morning worship, that was His service.
[time=278] So therefore when we walked in the door, we weren't to talk to anybody except God.
[time=284] And then when we were to leave, we were to fellowship with our Christian brothers and sisters.
[time=289] And then when we walked through the door of the church, that was our mission field and we were to tell others about the Lord.
[time=297] And I grew up that meaning church.
[time=300] Well, about 35 years ago, that all started to change.
[time=303] And different things started coming into our worship and gospel songs and different types of instruments.
[time=310] And through a lot of struggle, I told Kelli, "I don't think I did this well." And he said, "Well, you're here." And so that means you did it well.
[time=318] Well, for many years, there's been tears, there's been struggles, and I've gone to the Word.
[time=325] And he said, "What did I learn?" Well, I guess the lessons that God has taught me is, because I want to be obedient to Him, I need to depend on His Word to tell me what is biblical, and that has to be my criteria, and what is simply a cultural difference.
[time=344] And then God said to me, "One day you need to find out what worship is all about, Marianne, you're struggling."
[time=351] So I went to the Word of God again, and I found three words meaning worship.
[time=356] One of them means what we so often do collectively, to adore Him, to bow down, to respect and honor Him.
[time=364] But another word of worship means that I'm to serve and obey Him.
[time=369] And then another word means I'm to live a righteous and holy life in front of everyone, and I realize that I need to worship God every moment of every day.
[time=379] I need to be obedient, I need to serve Him, I need to live a righteous and holy life, and I need to adore Him.
[time=388] And it's not what is the music, it's not what kind of instrument, it's where is my heart.
[time=394] And I definitely want to be obedient to Him and His Word.
[time=398] And I think I'll probably always struggle a little for a year and some times for those old days of that very quiet, reserved worship.
[time=407] You've got to teach me some day, that sevenfold amen thing.
[time=411] That's all right.
[time=414] Now Nancy, last night you said something about, along the same lines of worship, you said that there was something a while ago
[time=422] that really helped you as you found yourself continuing to experience the transition of change.
[time=428] Share the folks, what that?
[time=431] I think change is hard for everybody.
[time=434] And for me, something that helped me was when Kelly said that it's not about contemporary style of worship, it's not about a traditional style of worship, but we just come here to worship.
[time=444] And as I thought about that, it just really helped put things in perspective because that's what we do.
[time=450] We come here and we get to sing praises and tell God how wonderful He is.
[time=455] And then we hear Kelly faithfully teaching the Word of God and that equips us to go out and to share with others how wonderful God really is.
[time=466] And so for me, that helped me to just remember that it's still all about Him.
[time=471] When we come here, that's what we do.
[time=473] We sing praises and we hear the Word of God and we get to worship and keep our eyes on the Lord.
[time=478] So I really appreciate it then.
[time=481] And I think change is hard, but it's been good.
[time=484] And I love seeing lots of new faces and being able to fellowship with still our old friends.
[time=490] Tony, share with the folks, this is Tony Opliger and Tony kind of represents the younger end of our panel.
[time=498] Oh, wait.
[time=507] Sorry, Kelly.
[time=511] Oh, man.
[time=513] There's a lot of people praying right now for Bob, so just...
[time=517] Tony, share with the folks just some of what your journey has been and some of the things that God's put on your heart with regard to the change that you have seen the church experience.
[time=527] Well, for me, the Black Hawk Church environment was more than just a church environment.
[time=534] It was my environment.
[time=537] You see, as I grew up, I not only came to church here on Sunday morning, but I came on Wednesday night.
[time=542] I went to Sunday school and then youth group as I got older.
[time=545] And on top of that, I went to the Christian School, Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=549] And so I had little contact, really, with any other environment outside of this environment.
[time=555] And so when I graduated from high school, environment and truth were very much the same thing to me.
[time=565] There was not a lot of difference there.
[time=567] And when I went away to college, it was kind of a shocker because it was a completely different environment.
[time=573] And on top of that, God put people into my life and I became friends with people from completely different environments.
[time=579] And my best friends, even today, are people who did not grow up near the church at all.
[time=584] People of different races, people of different social, economic backgrounds, et cetera.
[time=590] And that exposure to different environments really began to work on my heart and kind of point out that my environment was just one environment of many.
[time=604] And then this past year, I went and had the opportunity to study over in Europe for a year.
[time=609] And that lesson of one environment of many really hit home, because talk about a different environment.
[time=617] It was something completely opposite of what I'd ever seen.
[time=621] And so I guess what God has taught me through all of that is that environment and truth are two different things.
[time=629] Well said, well said, let's jump from the younger end of the spectrum back to the older end, Bob Barkis.
[time=636] Thanks.
[time=637] Yeah, you're welcome.
[time=638] Bob, Bob's seen some change in his day and shared some things with us this morning that I thought were really interesting,
[time=645] especially as it relates to a song that we sing. Bob, tell the folks what you were.
[time=649] Right, a song a couple years ago, I think it came out, I became aware of it, I started listening to it, and we sang it, I think, last week.
[time=655] But the song is Touching Heaven and Changing Earth.
[time=658] And there's a phrase in there that talks about, it talks about standing firm on the Word of God, which I think, again,
[time=664] knowing the Word, studying the Word, standing firm on the Word is always where we need to be.
[time=670] But then it says Touching Heaven and Changing Earth.
[time=673] And that illustration for me was that, again, standing firm on the Word, we have a hand in heaven touching our Lord through the power of the Holy Spirit.
[time=684] And yet, we also have a hand that's touching Earth, in that we are his change agent for Earth.
[time=691] And I also viewed this as almost a conduit that he's the generator of power.
[time=697] And again, we need to be heaven focused, but we also need to be focused on this Earth in terms of, again, being his change agent here,
[time=707] and that his power flows through us, then, in terms of reaching other people.
[time=713] And again, I saw that illustration as us, again, kind of two purposes of why we are saved.
[time=719] And one is that worshiping him, which, at a future point, will be worshiping him 100% of the time.
[time=726] And then all of our life will be spent doing that.
[time=729] And then now, though, this changing Earth, where we also have a second focus and that is to take the gospel to other people.
[time=738] That's great.
[time=740] Doug Crane, how about you? You've seen some change in your day, and you've been through change here at Black Hawk.
[time=746] When you think about that question, what has allowed you to endure well, what came to your heart?
[time=753] First of all, I guess I'm one of those people that tend to like change for one thing.
[time=759] As a general rule, I look forward to change, and I get excited about change.
[time=764] But like everybody, there's times where I don't like change.
[time=768] And when I was asked to sit up here and do this, the first thing that came to my mind was a verse that someone shared with me back in college, a good friend of mine.
[time=778] It's in Ezekiel 11, verses 19 through 20, "And I shall give them one heart, and shall put a new spirit within them.
[time=786] And I shall take the heart of stone out of their flesh and give them a heart of flesh, that they may walk in my statutes and keep my ordinances and do them.
[time=795] Then they will be my people, and I shall be their God." And what I like about that verse is I think there's times where we all get hard towards change.
[time=805] I know what I do at times.
[time=808] And so this verse I just really like, even though it doesn't mention change, I like it because it talks about God keeping my heart soft towards him and towards change that he brings in my life.
[time=820] Ezekiel 11, 19 and 20.
[time=825] Good truth.
[time=828] Well Bob, here we are.
[time=831] I feel like I'm on the Oprah Winfrey show.
[time=834] That's not Oprah out there.
[time=837] How about you when you hear, thanks for doing this by the way.
[time=841] When you hear that question, or you hear that idea of what has allowed us to endure change well, where do you find yourself at?
[time=849] With that these days?
[time=851] I told Kelly that when we were driving up here this morning, I looked over at my wife and said, "Just pray that I don't say something stupid, okay?"
[time=859] And instead of her being like real reassuring, like, "Oh, you won't say it." She just looked at me and said, "I will pray."
[time=868] I probably should quit while I'm ahead.
[time=871] Kelly gave me that question last week, and I've been kind of thinking about it, and then I knew that we were going to have this little meeting.
[time=877] I was supposed to have an answer to the question, so one more time in our little meeting room there.
[time=882] "Okay, now what's the principle? What's the idea? What's the truth? What's the thing that you've hung on to that's allowed you to endure the change?"
[time=888] And it has been kind of a struggle-ish processing-ish kind of thing.
[time=893] And I didn't have an answer to this question, and I don't have the answer that's gotten me through those things.
[time=900] It's continued to be kind of a work-in process, a process of seeking and thinking and reading and studying and dialoguing with people.
[time=907] And I just mentioned to him that while that's all been going on, there's still a lot of work to be done to, you know, the living Christmas tree to set up and tear down and kids up there that have runny noses and things like that.
[time=918] And so I'm trying to, we are, Karen and I, trying to do that while we process through all this stuff and sort out the differences between just stylish differences and philosophical differences.
[time=929] And I got to say, and I would, you know, I don't want everybody here to hear this, and not just about these guys, but just about our interactions in general.
[time=939] There have been times in the last, oh, couple of years where I have had discussions with Mary Ann.
[time=944] There have been times where Bob, as he mentioned, you know, where I've gotten notes and those notes I've led to discussions about things that are very, very serious and very heartfelt.
[time=954] And yet the key is, in the midst of the transition of change that we constantly find ourselves in, in the midst of their struggle with certain things, never once.
[time=964] Never once were those, or have they been, heated discussions where it's been about right and wrong.
[time=971] No, it's always been about things that are different. It's always been about change. It's been about attitude. It's been about God's Word.
[time=978] And it's been about the perspective that that brings, and so I can't thank them enough. And the rest of you, because I know there are others in this room this morning who would echo their struggle at times.
[time=989] And yet as we do our best to stay fixed on the truth and then modify where God's Word allows, that is something that as you do that well with us, it makes what goes on here that much sweeter and that much more effective.
[time=1007] [MUSIC]
[time=1012] The Almighty Lord, our God, is our refuge and our strength.
[time=1029] And ever present help in trouble times, He will hear our desperate cry.
[time=1046] Therefore we have hope and we will not feel for our God is near.
[time=1068] The Almighty God, Lord Jacob, is our fortress and our shield.
[time=1085] No, the earth give way and mountains quake. He will hear our desperate cry.
[time=1103] Therefore we have hope and we will not feel for our God is near.
[time=1124] Be still and know that He is God. The Almighty Lord, His wisdom, be still and know that He is our God.
[time=1150] The Almighty Lord is with us. Therefore we have hope and we will not feel for our God is near.
[time=1177] [MUSIC]
[time=1207] Be still and know that He is God. The Almighty Lord is with us.
[time=1260] Therefore we have hope and we will not feel for our God is near.
[time=1306] [MUSIC]
[time=1320] We'll open up your Bibles if you've got them this morning to Acts chapter 11.
[time=1326] Acts chapter 11 with God comes change. With God comes change. One commentator author said this about God and change.
[time=1334] He said and I quote God loves changing things. He moves his hand across the earth and the sky stir.
[time=1340] He casts his shadow over a nation and a government topples. He whispers a word in the dark and a star fills the emptiness.
[time=1349] His favorite changes though occur in the hidden places where the human soul and spirit mingle.
[time=1355] He delights in changing a lonely boy's tears in the laughter he glories in converting a heart of stone into a heart of tenderness.
[time=1365] Yes he loves his changes. The problem is that too often we resist them.
[time=1372] He eagerly presses us to change and grow and move but we resist comfortable and old and familiar surroundings.
[time=1381] End quote. As we look back over these last few weeks in our study of the book of Acts we have seen the Apostle Peter going through enormous life changing change.
[time=1393] Confused at times resistant at first he has finally towards the end of chapter 10 he has finally come to see God's purpose.
[time=1401] God's purposes at work in the midst of changing times and in these last two weeks especially we've watched him become open and willing to change.
[time=1410] As we see Peter as you watch and as we've read and as we've studied and as we've seen Peter willing and ready and open to change it as a reminder to you and it is a reminder to me that we as well must stay open.
[time=1425] We as well must be willing to experience the appropriate changes that God has for you and for me in life, in family and church.
[time=1436] And before we jump into the passage this morning here in Acts 11 I wanted to just remind us briefly of what some of the basic elements of change are.
[time=1446] It's very important if we are to maintain a healthy mindset and attitude about the change that we may very well experience.
[time=1453] You have to be and I have to be reminded periodically that there are some things about change, change in and of itself that we've got to stay aware of and mindful of and connected to.
[time=1464] Just two reminders this morning, okay? This wouldn't be in your note sheet, you can just kind of make room wherever you'd like but two things about change to keep in mind.
[time=1472] Number one, any change requires adjustment.
[time=1476] Any change in your life, family-wise, vocationally, here in the church in ministry, any change requires adjustment and guess what?
[time=1486] Adjustment is scary. Altering things in life is challenging.
[time=1493] When it's time to adjust that often brings periods of discomfort.
[time=1498] It's awkward for parents to ask their kids how to use a computer, raise your hand if you've ever had to ask that question.
[time=1505] It's difficult and awkward, embarrassing, it's an insecure feeling to face certain elements of change.
[time=1511] It's upsetting for Oregon loving church members to get used to new electric synthesizers and guitars and drums.
[time=1520] You see, change tests are flexibility. Change tests are flexibility.
[time=1527] You know what else it tests? It tests our good judgment.
[time=1532] That's right. Change tests are good judgment because not all changes are necessarily positive.
[time=1540] When I say that and I say that loud and I say that clear and you know me, I love change.
[time=1547] I like Doug, I anticipate it. I can't wait for the experience that it brings to my life.
[time=1552] I love change but not all change is good, not all change is necessary.
[time=1558] Thus the second principle this morning, write it down, each change must be, has to be, carefully examined.
[time=1566] All change must be carefully examined. As we filter current trends, listen now, as we filter current trends through the Word of God, we discover which will help and which will hinder the communication of the gospel.
[time=1580] But we must be careful in the midst of running trends through the Word of God.
[time=1585] We have to be careful not to confuse our ministry methods with God's truth, equating then our preferences with Scripture and using our opinions as the grid.
[time=1598] You can't do it. This is not about your opinion and it's not about my opinion
[time=1605] and it's not about our preferences, it's about what God's Word says.
[time=1611] Because if He wanted us to know about it and if He had a plan for us in a certain area, guess what? He communicated to us about it.
[time=1621] The Word of God is the grid through which all change must be carefully examined.
[time=1626] And as Peter, okay, back to Peter, back to Acts, as He comes home to Jerusalem, as He comes back to the good old boys, back at the Jerusalem church, He is coming as you know from Caesarea where He's just had this amazing encounter with Cornelius
[time=1642] and his family and friends, and He has seen through change God do amazing things there.
[time=1648] Now He comes back to Jerusalem a completely different man, seeing ministry and life
[time=1654] through a completely different scope. And He realizes something else definitely
[time=1660] is in need of change and that would be those that He bumps into back in Jerusalem.
[time=1665] Number one, the need for change. It's what Peter sees, it's what Peter hears, it's what Peter comes face to face with, the need, the ongoing need for change.
[time=1674] Pick it up in chapter 11, verses 1 to 3.
[time=1677] It says, "There are now the apostles and the brethren who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the Word of God.
[time=1686] And when Peter came up to Jerusalem, those who were circumcised took issue with Him."
[time=1693] Okay, in light of all that just happened, in Caesarea Cornelius and his family
[time=1699] coming to faith because Peter, a Jew was willing to sit and share time with and truth with a non-Jew because change had occurred, people had come into the kingdom.
[time=1711] And it says here in the first two verses of chapter 11 that they took issue with this.
[time=1717] Namely with Peter, look what it says in verse 3.
[time=1720] They take issue with this saying in verse 3, "You went to uncircumcised men
[time=1726] and ate with them." Peter, what's happened to you?
[time=1733] He comes back home and these guys are wagging their fingers in his face saying, "How could you shame on you, Peter? You've gone liberal.
[time=1743] You shared a meal with a pagan? In the vernacular of our day,
[time=1751] maybe something like this, you let your neighbors bring beer to your barbecue?
[time=1758] What's up with that?
[time=1763] You invited who to church?
[time=1767] Don't you know who she is? Don't you know where she's been?
[time=1771] Don't you know what she's done? What are you doing?
[time=1777] About a year ago, I got a letter after the Living Christmas tree.
[time=1779] You may remember last year, it's not this most recent one, but the year before that.
[time=1784] The Living Christmas tree that year ended with a stirring, what was to me, a stirring rendition of Handel's Hallelujah Chorus.
[time=1792] Do you remember it was a Brooklyn tabernacle kind of redo?
[time=1795] And we had the choreography and the ribbons were twirling and the choir was singing and it was just, man, it just was amazing.
[time=1804] And I got a letter about two weeks later, and an excerpt of that letter read like this.
[time=1811] You call that embarrassing barroom rendition of Handel, a Hallelujah Chorus?
[time=1817] It was a travesty, not worthy of the free ticket.
[time=1825] You see, you see, that's everywhere.
[time=1829] You see, institutional set in stone Judaism had begun to rot this church from the inside out.
[time=1837] And the same thing happens today in churches everywhere when Christians who I call it,
[time=1843] who are white knuckling, white knuckling their past and white knuckling their self-imposed standards
[time=1851] are unwilling, unwilling to let go and adjust and alter appropriately.
[time=1859] There are minds that is the mindset that says good Christians do ministry in life the way it's always been done.
[time=1865] Good Christians do ministry in life the way they want it done.
[time=1869] They sometimes even refer to it as their commitment to a higher standard.
[time=1875] Maybe you've heard that, maybe you've sensed that, maybe you've been the recipient of a confrontation
[time=1883] or an exhortation regarding your lack thereof.
[time=1886] They call it their higher standard, which in the end is just kind of dressed up verbiage for legalism.
[time=1892] Some will with their higher standard commitment say to you, as they've said to me, "There is no reason in the world. There is no place for believers in movies.
[time=1902] No movies. No remarriage ever. No secular music.
[time=1907] No, I've been confronted for having Disney products in my house because Disney's of the devil.
[time=1912] No Disney products. No electric instruments, choruses or power point in church worship services.
[time=1917] No drinking ever. No dancing at weddings and certainly no attending weddings with an open bar.
[time=1923] They announce it. They preach it. They confront on it.
[time=1927] And when you ask why, they say, because we have simply adopted a higher standard, we are ultra committed.
[time=1937] We hold to a higher standard to which the question has to be asked higher than what?
[time=1945] And you ask them, you say, "Hire than this? Higher than this?"
[time=1951] Because last I checked, we were abiding by this.
[time=1956] There's the word of God, prohibit or even speak to all of the above.
[time=1961] You know the list that just got rattled off? No it doesn't.
[time=1966] Which sadly makes those individuals who handle it like that nothing more than,
[time=1973] as far as the New Testament would describe them, nothing more than Pharisees and legalists.
[time=1977] Now is it okay not to go to movies? Sure.
[time=1980] Is it okay not to dance? Absolutely.
[time=1983] Is it okay for you or I to hold a personal private conviction about something we feel strongly about? Absolutely.
[time=1992] So do it. Hold on to it privately and quietly between you and God.
[time=1998] And you and I have to be careful not to become in any way, in any walk, in any arena of this life that we live together.
[time=2006] White-muckling people who are bound and determined to hold on to what we think or what we feel is right or best.
[time=2014] Peter bumps into the exact same attitude and he realizes they need the same
[time=2020] transformation of mind and heart that he had experienced and he shares with them the truth.
[time=2025] He shares with them the truth which God himself had revealed, the basis for his change.
[time=2031] Peter didn't just change. There was a basis for his change. God was at work.
[time=2035] God was moving. Look with me at Acts 11, pick it up in verse 4.
[time=2039] Peter shares with them the basis for his change.
[time=2042] And if you've been with us the last few weeks, this will sound very familiar.
[time=2045] But watch how Peter just takes him through his own experience with God, verse 4.
[time=2049] But Peter began speaking and proceeded to explain to them an orderly sequence saying "I was in the city of Japah praying and in a trance I saw a vision, a certain object coming down like a great sheet lowered by four corners from the sky and it came right down to me. And when I had fixed my gaze upon it and was observing it, I saw the four-footed animals of the earth and the wild beasts and the crawling creatures and the birds of the air.
[time=2074] And I also, verse 7, heard a voice saying to me, "Arise Peter, kill and eat." But I said, "By no means, Lord, for nothing unholy or unclean has ever entered my mouth,
[time=2084] but a voice from heaven answered a second time what God has cleansed.
[time=2089] No longer consider unholy." And this happened three times and everything was drawn back up into the sky and behold, at that moment three men appeared before the house in which we were staying, having been sent to me from Caesarea.
[time=2104] And the Spirit told me to go with them without misgivings.
[time=2107] And these six brethren also went with me and we entered the man's house.
[time=2111] And he reported to us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying, "Send to Japah and have Simon who is also called Peter brought here.
[time=2120] And he shall speak words to you by which you will be saved, you and all your household." And as I begin to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them just as he did upon us at the beginning.
[time=2131] Guys, he's saying, Peter's saying, "Guys, it was just like it happened with us." Back in that upper room, don't you remember?
[time=2140] He did the same thing.
[time=2142] The Holy Spirit fell upon them just as he did upon us at the beginning.
[time=2147] And I remembered, verse 16, "The word of the Lord, how he used to say John baptized with water,
[time=2153] but you, you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit."
[time=2159] You know what he does here?
[time=2161] These poor legalists were trapped on an island of tradition.
[time=2166] And Peter begins to build for them a bridge.
[time=2170] A bridge, a bridge from their island of higher white knuckled standards to God revealed truth.
[time=2177] And look how he does it.
[time=2178] No appeal to emotion.
[time=2180] No blistering rebuke.
[time=2182] He simply states, what does it say there?
[time=2184] In verse 4, "In orderly sequence." He gives them the facts.
[time=2190] And you know what he does?
[time=2191] Throughout all of those verses I just read.
[time=2194] Secondly, he shows and he intertwines in all of that the fingerprints of God.
[time=2202] He shows them.
[time=2203] He explains to them.
[time=2204] He reiterates for them.
[time=2205] The fact that this transition that God had taken him through was of God.
[time=2210] Heard a voice.
[time=2212] Verse 7, "Arise Peter, kill and eat.
[time=2214] No longer consider unholy that which I have cleansed." Verse 12, "And the Spirit told me," verse 13, "the angel standing in the house." Verse 14, "You will be saved." The whole passage there just covered with the fingerprint of God as he moves Peter and the church at that time through a transition without question it was of him.
[time=2235] Which takes us right back to the second point we talked about earlier today about evaluating change.
[time=2241] It's always got to be examined.
[time=2243] Is it of him?
[time=2244] Will it further the gospel?
[time=2245] Will it enhance ministry without diminishing the truth?
[time=2250] He senses their need for change.
[time=2253] He shares with them the basis for change and now having literally walked them over the bridge to the shore of a new, fresh, God-honoring mindset.
[time=2263] He gives them a one-verse opportunity to change.
[time=2268] Gives them a one-verse opportunity to change that comes in the form of a question.
[time=2273] Pick it up in verse 17.
[time=2275] Having said all that he said, he transitions, looks him right in the eye and says if God, guys listen, he says if God therefore gave to them the same gift as he gave to us.
[time=2287] So after believing in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I, that I should stand in God's way?
[time=2297] He says, who am I?
[time=2301] And we ask, who are we?
[time=2304] And hopefully you're asking, who am I as well?
[time=2307] He says, who am I?
[time=2309] And we ask, who are we to stand in God's way as he pursues an ever-changing world
[time=2315] with an unchanging message?
[time=2320] Peter says, who was I to stand in the way of what God was doing?
[time=2325] People, methods will be modified.
[time=2330] Methods of ministry will always be modified.
[time=2334] Ministry will look and sound different.
[time=2337] 80 years ago, there were people who couldn't stand the organ because it came into the church from the bars.
[time=2346] And the organ was a distasteful, blasphemous, awful thing and they fought it.
[time=2354] And 80 years from now, who knows what they'll be saying about what we do and how we did it
[time=2361] and it'll all, some of the things will all be different, but there will be one thing.
[time=2366] There will be one thing that will never ever change, God willing.
[time=2370] And there's going to be one thing in this place that will always, we will always stand firm on and hold tight to and that is the timeless message of Jesus Christ, the timeless message of the gospel, the timeless message of this book.
[time=2385] Ministries will look and sound differently.
[time=2388] Methods will always be changing, but the message will always stay the same.
[time=2394] So back to Jerusalem, what are these guys going to do?
[time=2398] What's their response going to be?
[time=2400] Would they loosen their grip on the comfortable?
[time=2402] Would they let go of the familiar?
[time=2406] Or would they continue to rigidly cling to their past?
[time=2411] What would they do?
[time=2413] What will you do?
[time=2418] Every one of you.
[time=2420] Every one of you that calls this place home, every one of you that's a part of this family has, God continues to move and work in this place you will be faced with as I will be faced with and it will be a constant facing of change.
[time=2432] He will always be modifying and growing and altering us as he continues to want to use us to reach an ever modifying changing world with a message that never ever changes.
[time=2446] And what will you do?
[time=2448] What kind of attitude will you harbor?
[time=2450] What kind of questions will you ask?
[time=2452] What kind of discussions like Marianne and Bob mentioned earlier?
[time=2456] What kind of discussions will you seek out?
[time=2458] How much will you give yourself to this endeavor of trying to somehow in the midst of difficult transition stay true to the fact that we've been called to endure this together?
[time=2470] What were they going to do in Jerusalem?
[time=2472] How would they respond?
[time=2474] How will you and I respond in the future to God led change? Well look at verse 18.
[time=2482] Verse 18 having said that, you know what they did? They let go.
[time=2486] The knuckles got some blood in them again.
[time=2490] They let go. And when they heard this, this is great. And when they heard this, they quieted down.
[time=2496] They quieted down and glorified God saying, well then, all right then. So we get it.
[time=2504] They say to Peter, well then God has granted to the Gentiles also the repentance that leads to life. Wow.
[time=2516] Which translated simply means, well okay.
[time=2520] We'd better broaden our scope.
[time=2524] We'd better look a little bit more to the right and the left.
[time=2528] If he died for him, we'll love him. And if the road to their hearts takes us through new territory and new roads and new sounds, we're in.
[time=2540] That's what they said. We're in. Now, look at what happens.
[time=2548] Look at the result. Look what happens when these men, these women, these people.
[time=2556] So used to this, we're actually willing to do this.
[time=2562] For the sake of the gospel. Look at chapter 11, verse 19.
[time=2566] So then those who were scattered because of the persecution that arose in connection with Stephen made their way to Phoenician, Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except to Jews alone. Some still hadn't gotten it.
[time=2579] But watch. But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, came to Antioch and began speaking to the Greeks also.
[time=2587] They began proclaiming truth. Folks now who have come from Jerusalem, they got it. The nickel dropped. The light went on. Now they start to teach the truth to Gentiles. Here referred to as Greeks.
[time=2599] And the hand of the Lord, verse 21, and the hand of the Lord was with them and a large number who believed turned to the Lord. And the news about them reached the ears of the church at Jerusalem and they sent Barnabas off to Antioch. I mean now they're in full gear.
[time=2615] Now there's no turning back. Now they're sending people to Antioch where Gentiles have been reached.
[time=2623] Then when he had come and witnessed the grace of God, he rejoiced and began to encourage them all with resolute heart to remain true to the Lord for he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith and considerable, there you go, and considerable numbers were brought to the Lord. And he left, it was too much.
[time=2643] There were too many of them. He leaves for Tarsus that says in 25 to look for who? For Saul. And when he had found him, he brought him back to Antioch and it came about that for an entire year they met with the church and taught considerable numbers and the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.
[time=2663] The disciples were first called Christians in Antioch. What happened you guys? What happened due to the fact that those who used to white knuckle it were then willing to let go, willing to allow God to transition them for the sake of the gospel, to some different practices, to some different methods, though the message stayed the same. What happened?
[time=2687] People, people came to Christ. That's what happened.
[time=2691] People found faith. The kingdom didn't stall.
[time=2695] People lost in dying found forgiveness in life. Why? Because people were willing to change. Peter and Barnabas his friend, the apostle Paul here referred to as Saul, said it well, flip over to 1 Corinthians, chapter 9.
[time=2711] He learned this very lesson in these early days of the church and then on later in his ministry, look what it says in 1 Corinthians chapter 9. I think it's verse 20.
[time=2723] There it is. Write this down. 1 Corinthians 9, 20. Paul said it well as it relates to change and transition and the gospel and God when he said this, verse 20, chapter 9, into the Jews Paul says, "I became as a Jew that I might win." Who? Who? Jews.
[time=2747] To the Jews I became a Jew that I might win Jews.
[time=2751] To those who were under the law as under the law though not myself under the law, that I might win those who are under the law. To those who are without the law as without law, though not being without the law of God but under the law of Christ that I might win those who are without the law.
[time=2771] To the weak I became weak that I might win the weak.
[time=2775] I have become all things to all men that I made by all means save some and I do all things for the sake of the what?
[time=2783] The gospel. That I may become a fellow partaker of it. Go over to chapter 10 go over to chapter 10, verse 23. Still Paul writing to the church at Corinth look what he says about change. Look what he says about mindset. Look what he says about the scope and the willingness.
[time=2807] 1 Corinthians 10, 23 all things are lawful but not all things are profitable. All things are lawful but not all things edify.
[time=2815] Let no one, let no one seek his own good but that of his neighbor eat anything that is sold in the meat market without asking questions for conscience sake. For the earth is the Lord's and all it contains. If one of the unbelievers invites you and you wish to go eat anything that is set before you. I kind of like that right there.
[time=2835] Eat anything that is set before you without asking questions for conscience sake. Go to verse 31.
[time=2843] Whether then you eat or drink. Many of you have heard this before.
[time=2847] Whether then you eat or drink or whatever you do do all to the glory of God. Give no offense either to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God. Just as I also please all men and all things not seeking my own profit but the profit of the many that they may be saved.
[time=2867] So how willing really down deep inside. How willing and how ready are we?
[time=2875] How willing are you to continue in your own process of change. Here you go. I mean just look at it this way. I have no idea what's coming but just imagine how willing and ready are we to minister the truth to be a place that offers a safe setting for people to hear a life-changing message. How willing and ready are we to change in whatever way possible to help people save in searching, find and follow Christ. How willing are we to do that in the year 2020 which is what we should be thinking about today.
[time=2911] As we hopefully prepare ourselves for what God may have.
[time=2915] I mean what's it going to be like? I mean you're struggling and I'm struggling with the things that we struggle with in the year 2001. What's it going to be like?
[time=2923] 19 years from now.
[time=2927] And will we be as adults and will we be as young people and will we be as those leaving the church willing to look back 20 years and say man a lot has changed but one thing, one thing hasn't changed at all and that is the truth that penetrates hearts and lies and brings forgiveness and freedom and promise.
[time=2951] How willing are you?
[time=2955] I hope, I hope vary. I want to show you something here. Go back to Acts 11 and as I'm turning back you let me ask Scott and those guys if they'd come back up go back to Acts 11.
[time=2971] You can't miss this. The end of Acts 11 ties into the beginning of Acts 11. Absolutely.
[time=2979] It says there in 25.
[time=2983] Remember Barnabas went to Tarsus looking for Saul and then he found him and he brought him back to Antioch. He brought him back to Antioch and it came about verse 26 that for an entire year they met with the church and taught considerable numbers and the disciples were first called Christians. Do you understand that title?
[time=3003] For the first time they took the name of Christ. They took the name of Jesus because they had stayed, watch this now, because they had stayed open to change, because they had stayed open to transition, because they had allowed their hearts to be moved of God toward a ministry and a kind of ministry they had never before imagined.
[time=3027] People found Christ and a church was opened and because of their openness and their willingness people took on the name of Jesus and there is something about that that is really really important for us just to keep in mind this morning as we leave this place and that is this folks electric guitars will come and go.
[time=3055] Organs and pianos and basketball leagues and singles who knows what it's going to be like.
[time=3063] And many of you in this room this morning have endured change well. You have faithfully stayed committed to that which is most important his word and his church. And as the years roll by here there is one thing that will never ever change. I mean the truth of God's word but it is the name by which all men are saved and that is the name of who.
[time=3087] Jesus that's right.
[time=3091] And it is a sweet name. And so as we leave this place this morning and as you're thinking about change and adjusting and flexibility don't forget that there is something that will never ever change and that is the name of Jesus. And we name his name we claim his name this morning as Christians like those in Antioch back in the first century church. So claim it with a sense of strength and claim it with a sense of hope and know that it will never ever ever change. They're going to sing and we're going to sing and just kind of follow along him.
[time=3145] Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus There's just something about that may Master St.
[time=3231] Lord Jesus Like the fragrance
[time=3241] after the rain Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Let all heaven and earth proclaim
[time=3273] when King comes we'll all pass away
[time=3281] but there's something about
[time=3287] that may
[time=3293] Jesus the mere mention of his name can calm the storm heal the broken the dead the name of Jesus I've seen sin hardened men melted derelict transformed the lights of hope put in the eyes of a hopeless child the name of Jesus hatred and bitterness turned to love and forgiveness arguments cease I've heard a mother softly breathe his name at the bedside of a child delirious from fever I watched just that little body grew quiet the fever gone cold I've sat beside a dying saint her body racked with pain when those final fleeting seconds summoned her last ounce of ebbing strength to whisper her sweetest name Jesus Jesus emperors have tried to destroy it philosophies have tried to stamp it out tyrants have tried to wash it from the face of the earth with the blood of those who claimed it yet it still stands and there shall be that final day when every voice that is ever utter the sound every voice of Adam's race shall raise in one mighty chorus to proclaim the name of Jesus for on that day every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is truly Lord you see it was not merely chance that caused an angel one night long ago to say to a virgin maiden his name shall be called Jesus Jesus there is something something about that name
[time=3439] The steps that will stay gone Jesus like a fragrance after the rain
[time=3457] Jesus Jesus Jesus let our hand in and then from pain The intent becomes will all pass away but there's something about let me
