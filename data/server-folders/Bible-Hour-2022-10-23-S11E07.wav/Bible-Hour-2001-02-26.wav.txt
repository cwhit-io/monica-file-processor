[time=203] [ Applause ] Let me invite you, if I could, to open your Bibles to the Book of Acts.
[time=212] And we are going to continue in our study of this great book.
[time=216] And I want to draw your attention this morning to Acts, Chapter 13.
[time=220] Acts, Chapter 13.
[time=222] Now, from the beginning.
[time=224] Okay?
[time=225] And I'm going to take your mind back a little ways here.
[time=227] From the beginning of this great book that we've been studying now for.
[time=234] Okay, take a guess.
[time=236] Two weeks now.
[time=238] [ Laughter ] Three, my go in weeks.
[time=243] Five, no.
[time=246] Twenty-two, somebody told you.
[time=249] Twenty-two weeks.
[time=252] I don't know if that seems like it seems like 40 to you, or if it seems like 10.
[time=256] But we've been studying this book for 22 weeks.
[time=260] And from the beginning of our look at this book, 22 weeks ago.
[time=265] God's plan for the church, the mission.
[time=268] The mission that he had established for these early followers of Christ.
[time=274] The mission, the purpose, where this thing was going.
[time=278] Had been abundantly, has been abundantly clear.
[time=282] And I want to just remind you, okay, so go back if you would.
[time=285] Would you go back to Acts, Acts 1-8?
[time=289] Go back to Acts 1-8.
[time=292] Twenty-two weeks ago, we looked at this verse.
[time=294] And I told you 22 weeks ago that this verse captures the essence of this book.
[time=299] It is in this verse that the unfolding of the next 28 chapters takes place.
[time=304] We see it all in this one verse, Acts 1-8.
[time=308] Here, Luke, the author of Acts, quotes our Lord.
[time=312] And he says in verse 8, "But you shall receive power." And that they did.
[time=318] He says, "You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you." And here you go, "You shall be my witnesses, both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria,
[time=331] and even to the remotest part of the earth." And we said 22 weeks ago that that verse that right there kind of captures the essence of the book and where it's going.
[time=341] It is about the growth of the gospel.
[time=344] It is about the birth of the church.
[time=346] And that growth, that birth began in the city of Jerusalem.
[time=350] And after that, that verse tells us that it would go beyond Jerusalem to Judea and Samaria and then on to the remotest outermost parts of the earth.
[time=359] Now, it was the stones, if you'll remember, the stones that killed Stephen.
[time=364] It was the stones that killed Stephen that had scattered the church initially.
[time=369] The church had, in fact, grown past Jerusalem.
[time=374] Judea and Samaria had come face to face with the truth.
[time=377] Non-Jews, otherwise known as Gentiles.
[time=381] Good job.
[time=382] Non-Jews, otherwise known as Gentiles, had been embraced.
[time=385] New ground had been taken.
[time=387] And we saw all of this basically back in chapters 7, 8, 9, 10, a little bit of 11.
[time=394] Now, the church, these early followers of Christ, having first established themselves in Jerusalem,
[time=400] then having been scattered by the stoning of Stephen and the persecution of a guy named Saul.
[time=405] If you remember back, this individual Saul was a hater of the Christian movement.
[time=410] He despised the truth and made it his sole endeavor to torture, persecute,
[time=417] and bring into bondage those Christians that he could get his hands on.
[time=420] And it was Saul's tormenting activity in the stoning of Stephen that had scattered the church.
[time=426] And they were now spread about and you wouldn't hold it against them.
[time=431] If there was a sense, having gone through, all they had gone through to this point, if there was a sense in their heart where they said, "Phew, all right, we've made it.
[time=442] We've survived it.
[time=443] We were doing the Jerusalem thing.
[time=444] Now we're doing the Judea and the Samaria thing.
[time=447] Wow, look at this thing.
[time=448] Go, let's just settle in." And God says, "No, no, no.
[time=454] No, not a chance.
[time=455] No, God had a plan.
[time=457] God knew what he was doing and his plan to get these followers back on the road, if you will, again."
[time=465] Spreading again, scattering again, growing the gospel again, planning new churches again.
[time=470] His plan for that begins to unfold right before our eyes here at the beginning of chapter 13.
[time=476] First verse.
[time=477] First verse of Acts chapter 13 kind of provides an insightful backdrop for what is about to take place.
[time=484] Are you there, Acts 13?
[time=486] Just going to read that first verse.
[time=487] You ready?
[time=488] Here we go now.
[time=489] There were at Antioch.
[time=491] Kind of get your minds back in gear.
[time=493] We're back at this place called Antioch.
[time=495] Gentiles have come to know Christ.
[time=497] The church in Jerusalem had sent Barnabas.
[time=500] He had gone and gotten Saul, and now there's great things going on there at Antioch.
[time=504] Now there were at Antioch in the church that was there prophets and teachers.
[time=510] Barnabas and Simeon, who was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene and Manaean, who had been
[time=516] brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
[time=519] Stop right there.
[time=522] Though the phrasing of that verse is simple.
[time=525] Luke conveys here in those few words a wealth of information in his portrait of the situation.
[time=532] First, okay, he mentions Antioch.
[time=535] A little bit about Antioch for you, okay?
[time=538] Antioch was the Roman capital of Syria, and it was the gateway to the east.
[time=544] Like most large cities during this time, Antioch was multicultural, trade rich, and crude.
[time=551] And by crude I mean there was on the outskirts of Antioch, the temple of Daphne.
[time=557] It was a deplorable, enormous center of prostitution and pagan worship, and prostitution,
[time=564] and pagan worship were absolutely rampant.
[time=567] So the temple and through that city as well.
[time=570] Chariot racing and sports activity had lured gamblers into the city where the atmosphere
[time=576] exuded a high rolling style.
[time=578] It was kind of a little first century Vegas.
[time=581] And in distinct and absolute contrast to Antioch here in this very first verse of chapter 13,
[time=589] he sets up against it in total contrast.
[time=594] What?
[time=595] The church.
[time=597] There was a church.
[time=598] In the middle of all of that, there is this little community of faithful followers doing
[time=604] their best to grow the gospel, live out their faith, and they were the believers at Antioch.
[time=610] And they were led by, it says, prophets and teachers, and that group included five men.
[time=615] Now watch this.
[time=617] Barnabas and Simeon, who was called Niagara, and Lucius of Cyrene and Manaean, who had been
[time=623] held up with Herod the Tetrarch and Saul.
[time=625] It says there at the end of verse one.
[time=627] Now it would be easy for you as it would be for me to kind of skip over the last part of that verse as just another few lines in the New Testament filled with very difficult to pronounce names.
[time=638] But if you did that, if I did that, if we did that in our study here of what was going on in Antioch, we would miss, I think, an incredibly insightful truth.
[time=647] Watch this now.
[time=649] Barnabas, Barnabas, was from the island of Cyprus.
[time=654] Simeon, who also had the name Niger, which was a Latin term meaning black skinned.
[time=661] Lucius was from Cyrene, which was west of Egypt on the coast of Africa.
[time=665] His name was Greek, so he was Gentile.
[time=668] Manaean was a member of high society, having grown up with Herod Antipas, the ruler of Galilee and Perea, and then there saw with his impressive education and rabbinical training.
[time=678] So look who's leading this church.
[time=681] Look at their leadership team, if you will.
[time=684] A Cyprian Jew, a black man, a Gentile, an aristocrat, and a rabbi were the ones giving
[time=691] daily leadership to this flock, these faithful followers of Christ.
[time=696] Consequently, the church body had become a model of diversity within unity.
[time=702] A microcosm, watch this, just a simple, small microcosm of what God was about to do.
[time=711] He was about to take the church where?
[time=715] We've gone to Jerusalem.
[time=717] We've done the Judea and Samaria thing, and now he's about to take the church where to the remotest parts of the world, and the world was gathered at Antioch.
[time=729] And he had prepared this church, he had prepared these leaders, he had set in motion a diverse
[time=736] church that was about to spearhead the growth of the gospel to a diverse world.
[time=742] It's incredible.
[time=743] I want you to see something there.
[time=746] I want you just for whatever it's worth to you.
[time=749] It was worth a lot to me this week as I thought this through.
[time=752] You know, a great work oftentimes requires great diversity.
[time=760] Say something to me, please, if ever, and I'm not calling this a great work.
[time=765] We're doing our best you and I around here.
[time=768] But please promise me you'll say something to me.
[time=771] If you ever sense this place filling up with guys, with men, with leadership,
[time=778] that just say what I say, think like I think, come from where I come from, where would I wear, do what I, you know, I've been in places like that.
[time=786] And maybe you've been in places like that, not interested.
[time=789] Not interested.
[time=790] I'm learning every day the value of diversity, appropriate diversity.
[time=795] There is so much to be gleaned.
[time=797] There is so much for me to learn.
[time=799] There is so much for teams, ministry teams, and senior staff and elder.
[time=804] There are so many things for us to gain by the diversity that God brings when you're open.
[time=810] When you're open and receptive to that.
[time=813] Don't ever let this place become.
[time=815] Same guy, same sound, same look, same stuff.
[time=818] No, no, no.
[time=819] A great work oftentimes requires great diversity.
[time=822] A second thing I want you to see here, before we get into the rest of where we're going
[time=828] this morning, and we're going quite a long ways this morning, but I'll tell you more about that in a second.
[time=832] Another little insight, and just in these first few verses I want to point out to you.
[time=836] I want you to see right here in verse two.
[time=838] It says they were at Antioch.
[time=840] There were these prophets and teachers, they're named.
[time=843] And in verse two it says this, "And while they were ministering to the Lord, and while
[time=849] they were ministering to the Lord and fasting the Holy Spirit said to the church there at
[time=856] Antioch, 'Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul, for the work to which I have called them.'"
[time=864] Interesting phrase there.
[time=865] "And while they were ministering to the Lord and fasting the Holy Spirit said," I want
[time=872] you to think about this with me.
[time=873] And I'm not trying to make an enormous, broad, sweeping, incongcrete point here.
[time=879] It's just something I think you need to and I need to keep thinking about.
[time=883] You've never been in need of, you ever wanted in your heart to sense the Spirit's leading?
[time=887] Ever been curious as to what God's will is in your life.
[time=890] Ever been at a point in time where you're kind of wondering what's next?
[time=894] What does he have for you?
[time=897] This says that while they were ministering, the Spirit spoke.
[time=906] Contrary to what many believe, as I read this, I begin to feel like, you know what?
[time=912] We don't need to.
[time=914] So many folks feel as if to find God's will to hear the Spirit speak that that means retrieving
[time=920] back into isolation.
[time=922] I want to know what God's will is.
[time=924] And so I go climb a mountain and sit under a tree and solitude.
[time=928] And I understand the quiet aspect of that.
[time=932] And I understand the desire to listen and not be distracted.
[time=935] But this verse strikes me that the will of God for these people, the Spirit moving in their lives, came to them while they were serving.
[time=944] While they were ministering.
[time=946] You see, so oftentimes the question, "What should I do?" leads you and I to do nothing.
[time=954] Does that make sense?
[time=956] So many times the question, "What's next?
[time=958] Where do I go?" leads you and I to complete non-involvement and retreat.
[time=965] And I just think it's fascinating here that the Spirit of God comes while they were ministering.
[time=971] And the thing about that is this.
[time=974] While they were ministering, they were in essence exercising their, what kind of gifts?
[time=978] Their spiritual gifts.
[time=981] And I was reading Chuck Swindall this week and he said, you know, there's no better time when you think about it.
[time=987] For you to be sensitive to, for us to be kind of up close to the Spirit of God, no better time than when he's already energizing us and supernaturally empowering us through
[time=998] the exercising of these spiritual gifts that he's giving us.
[time=1001] And so while we're serving him, Swindall says the time is ripe for him to lean over and whisper his affirmation.
[time=1010] To lean over and whisper a word of guidance or caution.
[time=1015] I was so encouraged a few weeks ago, we had our panel of folks up here that they were
[time=1021] discussing change.
[time=1023] One of the guys, Bob Freeborn, said something that just stuck with me and came to me again this week as I thought this little insight through.
[time=1029] Bob was talking about how he hadn't yet figured out some things.
[time=1032] Still struggling and wrestling with some issues of change.
[time=1036] Even right here in our own church.
[time=1038] And yet as he wrestled with that and as he shared that wrestling with us, he made a very, very, I think insightful and profound comment.
[time=1046] But the tree still needed to get decorated.
[time=1051] Kids still needed to be watched.
[time=1054] Ministry still needed to be done.
[time=1058] And so many times your questions and my questions leave us out of the game.
[time=1062] And God's word here in Acts 13 says they were right in the midst of rolling up their sleeves and serving God.
[time=1068] And at those points he whispers.
[time=1072] Third insight right here from these first few verses and something I want you to take note of and get some thought to.
[time=1078] I want you to look at the response of the people.
[time=1082] Look for the response.
[time=1085] Look at their wisdom.
[time=1086] Look at their maturity.
[time=1087] This young church already had gained and gone leaps and bounds.
[time=1090] Look what it says.
[time=1091] It says the Spirit had said, "Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them." Verse 3, "Then when they had fasted and prayed, they laid their hands on them, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away." God says, "I want," watch this now.
[time=1109] God says, "I want Paul and Barnabas church at Antioch.
[time=1117] Set apart for me, Paul and Barnabas." Okay, do you all understand what that means?
[time=1126] I mean, are you tracking with this?
[time=1128] Go back to 11.
[time=1129] Go back just a few pages to 11-21.
[time=1132] I think most of you probably are catching the drift here, but let's just get everybody on the same page.
[time=1137] This is enormous people.
[time=1139] But look at Acts 11, 21.
[time=1142] It says there, "And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a large number who believed turned to the Lord." Now this is what's going on in Antioch.
[time=1150] And the news about them reached the ears of the church at Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas off to Antioch.
[time=1156] And then when he had come and witnessed the grace of God, he rejoiced and began to encourage them all with resolute heart to remain true to the Lord.
[time=1164] For he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith, and considerable numbers were brought to the Lord, and he left for Tarsus to look for Saul.
[time=1173] And when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch, and it came about that for an entire year they, Barnabas and Saul, met with the church and taught considerable numbers, and the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.
[time=1189] These two, folks, just be on the same page here.
[time=1194] These two guys were the pastors of the church.
[time=1197] These two guys were the ones that were regularly teaching the truth of God's word.
[time=1202] These two guys were the family shepherds, and when there was truth to be taught around the world, new cultures to be embraced, new churches to be planted.
[time=1211] Who did God call on?
[time=1214] Did he call on some young little green horn out of Bible college with no experience and little maturity?
[time=1221] No.
[time=1223] Did he call on well-intending individuals who think, who thought they may have what
[time=1233] it takes to accomplish that work?
[time=1237] No, don't hear me wrong this morning.
[time=1240] Nothing wrong with young green Bible college graduates with visions of ministry
[time=1246] and hopes of being used by God.
[time=1248] Nothing at all wrong with that.
[time=1250] Anything wrong with individuals in our own church and our own family who feel in their heart is if they might have what it takes to lovingly lead and guide a church.
[time=1260] Absolutely not.
[time=1262] But who did God send?
[time=1263] No, he sent, he called out, proven, established, seasoned individuals who had been doing it.
[time=1274] And I think sometimes that's where we miss the boat and the whole missions thing.
[time=1279] I think sometimes today we keep the seasoned, established, mature ones that have been
[time=1287] doing it and have gone through the trenches and experienced what it means to lovingly lead, teach, guide, shepherd, a family.
[time=1295] We keep them for ourselves.
[time=1298] And we send to the outermost parts of the world people who hope they can get it done, think they might be able to get it done.
[time=1309] He sends established, seasoned individuals to the mission field.
[time=1314] How would you feel?
[time=1315] Hypothetical.
[time=1316] And maybe it shouldn't be hypothetical.
[time=1320] I guess for today it would be hypothetical.
[time=1322] But how would you feel?
[time=1323] You personally, if the elders of this church, through whatever series of events, maybe
[time=1330] something happened through a couple of individuals who had this huge heart and desire and we realized there were hundreds, maybe five to six hundred over in the
[time=1340] Kosovo region.
[time=1341] Believers, somehow some way there's this enormous group of believing individuals and families in dire need of fellowship and teaching and spiritual protection.
[time=1353] And what if somebody gave thousands and thousands of dollars and wanted to build
[time=1359] a church and actually even begin to train and encourage families?
[time=1364] And through Slavic gospel, through Dick Kelly, maybe.
[time=1367] Your elders came to you and said, "You know what?
[time=1370] God is at work and he's moving." And we've prayed about it and we feel him setting apart for Kosovo for the next five years, Kelly and his family and Steve Longbreak and his family and Greg Deeson and his family because there's teaching and ministry and children and families that need love and we're going to send them.
[time=1390] I mean, it's that kind of a, and I'm not trying to put myself, Steve or Greg, on the level of part of us in Paul, I'm just saying people understand this was their church and these guys were their pastors.
[time=1400] And they had had experience at this and they're the ones that got set apart.
[time=1404] Interesting to think through and consider.
[time=1408] Them, this young fledgling community of followers, them sending out their
[time=1414] friends and leaders, this young church obediently letting go is a huge indication, I think, of their expanding faith and their deepening trust.
[time=1423] Now, what Paul and his companions are about to embark on has been come to know
[time=1431] through the ages of the, over the years they've been come to know that they've come to be known as the three missionary journeys of Paul.
[time=1440] And we're about to study them in the weeks to come.
[time=1443] And this will take us from chapter 13 all the way through chapter 21.
[time=1448] And I thought this morning what we could do is just do an overview of these three journeys.
[time=1453] And here's why oftentimes, I mean, the 13 to 21, eight chapters, nine chapters, just absolutely packed with all kinds of stories and information and truth that just we need to look at and consider.
[time=1466] The journeys, the three of them are so intense and there's so much there that sometimes if we were to just kind of chip along a week at a time, sometimes it gets kind of overwhelming, so I thought we would just take this time today.
[time=1480] And over these next few minutes, just kind of do an overview of what it all looks like, kind of step back if you would for a moment and give you the big picture.
[time=1487] And in giving you the big picture then as we come back in the weeks to follow and get more specific, hopefully it begins to make a little bit more sense to you.
[time=1495] These three journeys, these were amazing times in the life of the church.
[time=1502] Taking them advancing, eternity altering, life changing, grueling journeys that Paul
[time=1509] and his companions gave themselves to.
[time=1512] And as we look at them this morning in brief, I just want you to kind of open your eyes, open your heart.
[time=1518] It's going to be a lot of information with some application as well because there are some things that we can take home from even an overview of these trips.
[time=1526] But I really want to invite you this morning.
[time=1528] We're going to overview nine chapters, three journeys, look at a lot of different things, but open your heart and open your eyes to what God may have for you as we look at these men and women in the faithfulness, the faithfulness
[time=1542] and the spirit with which they carried themselves in these endeavors.
[time=1547] Journey number one, journey number one, and we're going again, this will be from
[time=1553] 13 to 21 and I'll draw your attention to certain things, but he had called them, remember, back in 13, two, they had sent them aside and prayed for them and sent
[time=1563] them and now traveling with Barnabas and a young John Mark Saul sets off to the
[time=1569] island of Cyprus, first missionary journey.
[time=1572] You see it there, they leave Antioch and they head to the island of Cyprus, which is actually where Barnabas was from.
[time=1579] Their ship lands at Salamis and from there they trek across to Paphos, preaching the gospel from place to place.
[time=1587] Now, as we talk about these journeys, folks, don't forget, there's no taxis.
[time=1591] All right?
[time=1593] I mean, I'm not trying to be funny.
[time=1595] Think about this, okay?
[time=1596] As you watch and read and see what you're about to track with this morning.
[time=1602] Okay, we're talking about a walk.
[time=1605] We're talking about by foot and by ship at points, but these guys are huffing
[time=1611] and these guys are setting out on quite a journey.
[time=1616] They trek across to Paphos, preaching the gospel from place to place.
[time=1620] During this time, Saul's name changes to Paul.
[time=1623] I know you'll want to see that.
[time=1624] It's incredibly disappointing.
[time=1626] Hang on to your seats here.
[time=1628] I know you like I.
[time=1629] We're looking for some incredible explanation here, but here it is in one verse.
[time=1634] But Saul, you're there, 13, verse 9.
[time=1636] But Saul, who was also known as Paul.
[time=1639] Now I read that and I thought, wait a second.
[time=1641] Since when was he known as Paul?
[time=1643] I've been calling him Saul for 12, you know, five chapters.
[time=1646] Now it just says in one verse, but Saul, who was also known as Paul.
[time=1650] But then from 13 9 on, it's not Paul known as Saul.
[time=1654] It's just Paul, so it gets kind of confusing.
[time=1656] But just now in 13 9, he becomes Paul for whatever reasons.
[time=1660] He becomes Paul and then an important government official believes in Christ down there in verse 12.
[time=1666] They sail to what is now southern Turkey.
[time=1669] They leave the island.
[time=1670] They sail to what is now southern Turkey.
[time=1673] You can follow along on the map there.
[time=1675] And here it is where Paul, most likely from what the Bible teaches us, this is where he contracts his lingering bodily illness, mentioned in Galatians 4 and also in 2 Corinthians 12.
[time=1687] This is where he contracts what he called there in 2 Corinthians 12, his thorn in the what?
[time=1693] His thorn in the flesh.
[time=1694] Which he prayed three times for God to take away.
[time=1697] And did God take it away?
[time=1699] No, never did.
[time=1701] This is where that whole thing begins to set in.
[time=1703] And a frightened and homesick John Mark abandons the mission and goes home in Acts 13 13.
[time=1711] Paul and Barnabas move on without him, going up to Poseidon Antioch.
[time=1715] Now this is a different Antioch.
[time=1717] Now we've got guys with two names and now we've got cities with two names.
[time=1721] It's kind of fun.
[time=1722] You've got Antioch and then you've got up to the north here, Poseidon Antioch.
[time=1725] And that's where they head.
[time=1726] Paul preaches in the synagogue there and it says in verse 44, that the whole city assembled to hear the word of God.
[time=1733] The Gentiles there embrace the gospel message, but the Jews don't embrace it.
[time=1737] They do what these Jews often did when they heard the truth, and that was they instigated a persecution, verse 50.
[time=1743] They instigated a persecution against Paul and Barnabas and drove them out of their district.
[time=1748] In spite of this, the two missionaries are, and I'm quoting here from verse 52, continually filled with the joy and with the Holy Spirit.
[time=1758] And from there they hike onto Iconium where the people try unsuccessfully, but nonetheless the people there in Iconium try to stone them.
[time=1768] The people there try to stone them narrowly escaping the violence in this city.
[time=1772] They flee to Listra where the people do.
[time=1775] Stone them.
[time=1778] They get out of Iconium, they go to Listra and there the people stone them.
[time=1782] Chapter 14 verse 19, then they stone Paul and dragged him out of the city.
[time=1788] Watch this now.
[time=1789] They dragged him, they stone him, and dragged him out of the city, supposing him to be dead.
[time=1797] Okay, now don't miss this.
[time=1799] You've got to just imagine in your mind and okay, it's an angry mob.
[time=1803] In this city they pull him out to the center of the square and they stone him.
[time=1808] And we've talked about stonings before, kind of softball sized rocks, groups of 20 to 30 people just plundering this guy with rocks for upwards to an hour.
[time=1819] And they, the mob who are wanting to kill him, having done that to him, look at him and say, he's what?
[time=1827] He's dead.
[time=1828] Now can you imagine what that looked like?
[time=1830] Can you imagine what that entailed?
[time=1832] They did a lot of stonings in those days.
[time=1834] These folks weren't amateurs.
[time=1836] They knew what a stone dead guy looked like.
[time=1841] And he was dead.
[time=1844] Experienced stoners.
[time=1847] He's dead.
[time=1850] And they drag him out of the city and they plop him on a pile of dirt because he's dead.
[time=1857] Man.
[time=1860] I love this.
[time=1862] I do.
[time=1863] You learn a lot about Paul.
[time=1864] Even in these overviews, like this morning you're going to learn a lot about this guy.
[time=1868] This guy was an animal.
[time=1870] And he was faithful.
[time=1872] And he was so solid.
[time=1873] And he was so driven by what God had called him to.
[time=1875] Watch this.
[time=1876] Tossed out of the city like a dead animal, Paul lies motionless in the dirt as a group of sympathetic disciples gathers around him.
[time=1883] Miraculously, chapter 14, verse 20, he arose and if it's you or me, my bet is if I get up from that, I'm running to the nearest mountain I can find,
[time=1894] hiding in a cave and praying for rescue.
[time=1898] What does it say he did?
[time=1899] He arose and went where?
[time=1901] Back to the city.
[time=1903] It was nighttime.
[time=1904] He needed to go to bed.
[time=1905] So he walks back into the very city that just stoned him.
[time=1909] The next day he leaves.
[time=1911] Which is a good idea.
[time=1912] The next day he leaves with Barnabas for where?
[time=1915] And then the two men retrace their steps encouraging the new believers again in Lestra, Iconium, Poseidon, Antioch and Perga.
[time=1922] They finish off this first journey by sailing back to Antioch and reporting in verse 27 and 28 what?
[time=1930] Let me catch up.
[time=1933] And when they had arrived and gathered the church together, they began to report all.
[time=1937] Now watch this.
[time=1938] Think about what you would be reporting.
[time=1940] Okay, you've been on this trip.
[time=1943] You've been struck with a disease that will never leave you.
[time=1946] John Mark, your supposed buddy bails on you.
[time=1949] You almost get stoned.
[time=1951] Then you get stoned.
[time=1952] Seemingly die.
[time=1953] You get brought back to life.
[time=1954] You walk back through the same cities that just tried to stone you.
[time=1958] Sail all the way home on something less than Princess Cruises.
[time=1963] And they say, "Hey, how was your trip?" And I mean this.
[time=1968] You and I need to do a better job of this sometimes.
[time=1971] We sometimes get lost in the woes, in the oh my's and that you wouldn't believe.
[time=1979] And I don't understand why this is so hard and the complaining.
[time=1982] Now don't hear me wrong.
[time=1984] I think there's value in you and I being able to share with those that we know and love the hurt and the pain and the confusion we feel in life.
[time=1992] But it was time here for a big moment.
[time=1994] Summary.
[time=1995] And what's the big moment?
[time=1997] Summary.
[time=1998] After all that he'd experienced and when they had arrived and gathered the church verse 27, chapter 14, they began to report all things that God had done with them and how he had
[time=2009] opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.
[time=2012] [AMEN] There's some perspective right there.
[time=2015] They said, "Look what God has accomplished.
[time=2018] Look what God did.
[time=2019] Yeah, I've got disease.
[time=2021] Yeah, I've got stoned.
[time=2022] But you know what?
[time=2023] God opened some doors.
[time=2026] Praise God in essence is what they reported.
[time=2030] Journey number two.
[time=2032] Journey number two starts out very interesting.
[time=2035] And I like this and I'll tell you why in just a second.
[time=2038] Paul and Barnabas now they kind of come back to Antioch and they are ready to travel again.
[time=2043] Feeling the spirit of God leading them to a similar endeavor.
[time=2047] They're ready to go but before they leave there's this conflict.
[time=2051] And I like this because I think sometimes people, sometimes we paint these apostles out to be
[time=2057] these incredibly holy guys and they were godly men.
[time=2061] But sometimes I think we make them other than we would be.
[time=2066] And right here at the beginning of the second journey, I mean there is an enormous, I mean it's big.
[time=2071] There's a real conflict between these two guys that love each other and love God and love
[time=2078] each other.
[time=2081] Barnabas being the encouraging, peacemaking, gentle.
[time=2088] Come alongside the guy that he was.
[time=2091] He wants to bring John Mark again.
[time=2093] John Mark, the guy that bails on the first trip.
[time=2095] Now he's back saying, "Hey guys, I like another shot at this." Barnabas's mindset is to say, "Sure, come on, let's do it." Being the kind of guy that Barnabas was.
[time=2105] Paul being the kind of type A driven, get the job done.
[time=2109] You're a whiny little mama's boy.
[time=2111] You left me last time, kind of guy.
[time=2114] Says, "I don't think so.
[time=2115] I got a kingdom to advance.
[time=2117] I got lives to change and I need somebody who's here to play." And they can't come to an agreement.
[time=2124] And I like that.
[time=2125] I mean I don't like that there was conflict.
[time=2126] I just like that Luke shows us the reality of these guys' lives and how it got resolved.
[time=2132] But it got resolved in a way that kept the advancing of the kingdom in view.
[time=2137] Barnabas takes John Mark's, "There's no problem, we'll go here." Paul takes this guy's stylus and off they go, headed for Derby.
[time=2144] I love it.
[time=2146] I absolutely love it.
[time=2149] So Paul with his new partner's stylus journeys over land through the Taurus.
[time=2154] Taurus Mountains, you see that up there?
[time=2156] Kind of small, but you can kind of make it out there just before the left turn there.
[time=2160] They go through the Taurus Mountains.
[time=2162] They encourage the Christians in Derby.
[time=2164] Here we go.
[time=2165] Paul goes back through Derby, Lestra, and Lestra, which is where he'd gotten stoned.
[time=2171] They pick up Timothy.
[time=2173] This is where Timothy comes into the picture.
[time=2175] My dear child of the faith, Paul's Timothy.
[time=2178] This is where he gets brought into the scene.
[time=2180] They go on to Iconium and other cities.
[time=2182] Then from there they move on to kind of the unevangelized areas of Frigia and Galatia.
[time=2188] But God says no, we're not going to evangelize here yet.
[time=2192] We're going to save that.
[time=2194] Forbidden by the Holy Spirit says there to speak the word in Asia.
[time=2198] Finally, they move on and they arrive at Troas, which is at kind of the western end of Asia on the shores of the Aegean Sea.
[time=2205] That's in verse 8, where Luke, the author of Acts, joins the team.
[time=2210] And there they have questions.
[time=2211] We're going to talk about it.
[time=2213] Where Luke, the author of Acts, joins the team.
[time=2217] And there they have questions.
[time=2218] Where, where should they go?
[time=2219] What should they do?
[time=2220] Should they go south?
[time=2222] Should they go back the way they came?
[time=2223] The answer comes to Paul, verse 9.
[time=2225] You see it there, Acts 16.
[time=2227] A certain man of Macedonia.
[time=2230] This is in a vision that Paul has at night.
[time=2233] A certain man of Macedonia was standing and appealing to him saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us." So they take that as from God.
[time=2244] They cross the sea and travel to Philippi.
[time=2247] Here in chapter 16, they meet a devout woman Lydia who opens her heart to Christ and her home to all of them.
[time=2254] And not long after that, you'll remember Paul casts a demon out of a slave girl that was
[time=2260] being exploited by her owners.
[time=2262] He casts the demon out.
[time=2264] The owners don't like the fact that he's just ruined their income source.
[time=2268] And so they have him beaten.
[time=2271] So now he's been beaten.
[time=2272] He and Silas both get beaten and thrown in jail, verses 16 to 23.
[time=2277] Undaunted, Paul and Silas sing praises to God.
[time=2282] Undaunted, undeterred.
[time=2283] Paul and Silas, it says, sing praises to God.
[time=2286] And suddenly, verse 26, there came a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison house were shaken
[time=2293] and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone's chains were unfastened.
[time=2298] Remember this?
[time=2300] The frightened jailer, and he was frightened because he would lose his life if the prisoners had escaped.
[time=2305] He sees all the open doors, draws a sword to kill himself, but Paul calls out, stop, stop, reassuring him all the prisoners have stayed put.
[time=2313] Nobody has escaped and this jailer is so impressed with their Christianity.
[time=2318] He is so impressed by their faith that he comes to know Christ himself, him and his entire
[time=2324] family, join the growing host of Christ followers.
[time=2329] This man and his family come to Christ.
[time=2333] The next day, Paul and Silas are released and leave for Thessalonica.
[time=2336] From there, they travel to Berea and then on to Athens.
[time=2340] On Athens.
[time=2341] In Athens, there is this incredible opportunity that awaits Paul because they're the people give Paul opportunity to speak at the Ariapagos.
[time=2349] It's kind of a prestigious world-renowned, at that time, Greek think tank, if you will.
[time=2356] The Ariapagos was a place where all the great Greek philosophers, all those of higher learning, all those of higher thinking would gather.
[time=2364] I mean, these guys were the brightest of the brightest.
[time=2366] This was the cream of the crop.
[time=2368] These were the deep thinkers in theologians and to the brightest, smartest, deepest minds
[time=2374] in the then-known world, he stands with confidence and says in verse 30, turn over there, 1730.
[time=2384] Look at 1730.
[time=2386] Paul at the Ariapagos says to the brightest, smartest minds, "Therefore, therefore having
[time=2394] overlooked the times of ignorance," he says to these guys.
[time=2399] "Therefore, having overlooked the times of ignorance," God is now declaring to men that all everywhere should repent because he has fixed a day in which he will judge the world
[time=2410] in righteousness through a man whom he has appointed, having furnished proof to all men by raising him from the dead.
[time=2416] Now, when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some began to sneer.
[time=2421] But others said, "We shall hear you," again concerning this.
[time=2425] And so Paul went out of their midst, but some men joined him and believed among whom also was Dionysius, Theoropecite, and a woman named Demerus, and others with them.
[time=2438] To the most daunting, intimidating crowd there could be.
[time=2441] He stands and says, "You know what God's overlooking your ignorance." Because you haven't figured this one out yet.
[time=2448] But he's going to be patient with you.
[time=2450] Repent.
[time=2451] It's the same message.
[time=2452] It's the same truth.
[time=2454] And those of higher learning and those of higher education did what so many still do.
[time=2461] Reject an ocean of salvation by faith because they couldn't figure it out or it didn't make sense in their empirical thinking.
[time=2468] Now, some sneered, but some came to Christ.
[time=2473] He pushes on to Corinth from Athens.
[time=2476] Here he meets Aquila, and Priscilla will learn more about that.
[time=2479] And counter later, tent makers like himself, they welcome him into their home, and become strong believers.
[time=2485] During his stay with Aquila and Priscilla he writes two letters to comfort the persecuted believers in Thessalonica, that would be 1st and 2nd Thessalonians.
[time=2494] And he receives an encouraging word from God.
[time=2496] And the Lord said to Paul, chapter 18 verses 9 to 10.
[time=2500] And it was as if he needed this encouraging word about this time.
[time=2503] The Lord said to Paul, "Do not be afraid any longer, but go on speaking and do not be silent.
[time=2509] For I am with you, and no man will attack you in order to harm you, for I have many people." In this city.
[time=2514] And with this reassurance, Paul stays on in Corinth for about a year and a half.
[time=2519] And afterward with Aquila and Priscilla at his side, he sails across the Aegean Sea.
[time=2524] You can see it there, sails across to Ephesus.
[time=2527] And here for only a short while, he then concludes his second journey by traveling back to Jerusalem and then to Antioch of Syria.
[time=2536] Two journeys, a lot of activity, a lot of truth proclaimed, a lot of people coming to Christ.
[time=2542] The remotest parts of the then known world beginning to be infiltrated by the gospel.
[time=2548] And some faithful, faithful men.
[time=2550] Journey number three.
[time=2551] After a rest in Antioch, Paul launches out again along the same northern route as before.
[time=2557] He strengthens the newly established churches along the way and finally arrives in Ephesus.
[time=2562] He stays here about three years and writes two letters to the church in Corinth.
[time=2567] One, I don't know if you knew this or not, one which was lost.
[time=2571] There is actually a third Corinthian letter that's never been found.
[time=2575] And the other was our first Corinthians.
[time=2578] He leaves Ephesus, follows his previous route through Macedonia.
[time=2582] He writes another letter to the Corinthian believers, then travels down to see them in person.
[time=2587] From Corinth, he pins a letter to the believers whom he longs to, watch this now, whom he longs to visit in Rome and then heads back to Ephesus.
[time=2597] On his way to Ephesus, he once again calls on the churches in Macedonia.
[time=2600] After a tearful farewell, he sails from Ephesus to Tyre and on to Caesarea.
[time=2606] The disciples there warn him not to go to Jerusalem, but with characteristic boldness.
[time=2610] Look what Paul says, verse 21, 13.
[time=2614] These guys are crying.
[time=2615] He's returned back to Caesarea, planning to go into Jerusalem.
[time=2619] The word has gotten out.
[time=2621] All of Jerusalem knows what Paul and Silas and Barnabas have been up to.
[time=2625] They know of these journeys.
[time=2626] They know the gospel is spreading and they say, do not go.
[time=2629] They're crying with him.
[time=2630] They're begging him.
[time=2631] Tears in their eyes, rolling down their cheeks.
[time=2633] Don't go to Jerusalem.
[time=2635] 21, 13, Paul says, what are you doing?
[time=2638] What are you doing weeping and breaking my heart?
[time=2641] I am ready not only to be bound, but even to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.
[time=2648] And his third journey ends with his return to Jerusalem and as warned.
[time=2653] And I rate angry.
[time=2655] Crowd has him arrested.
[time=2658] They place him in chains and he has then shipped off from Jerusalem all the way up to Rome.
[time=2664] And he's on his way to the place that says in chapter 19, verse 21, he longed to go.
[time=2671] Look at that real quick.
[time=2672] Would you?
[time=2673] As you read through all these passages and all these chapters, as I did this last week,
[time=2681] you do get the sense there was something about Rome.
[time=2684] He wanted to get to.
[time=2686] Look at 19, 21.
[time=2688] Now after these things were finished.
[time=2690] Now after these things were finished, Paul purposed in the spirit to go to Jerusalem after he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia saying, after I have been there, I must.
[time=2700] You hear that?
[time=2703] I must also see Rome.
[time=2706] Why do you think he was so intent?
[time=2710] I'm just asking.
[time=2711] I mean, think about it.
[time=2714] I did this last week.
[time=2715] Why do you think he was so intent and so hopeful and so wanting to get to this place called Rome?
[time=2724] As you ask yourself that question, any thoughts come to mind?
[time=2728] Few came to mind.
[time=2729] Now we can look all the way through the scriptures and probably find even more, but there were a few that just popped immediately to my mind.
[time=2737] One of the reasons I think would have been this guy named Nero.
[time=2741] Have you ever heard of Nero?
[time=2744] Do you understand what Nero was doing to followers of Christ while Paul's on his journeys?
[time=2752] Nero is taking followers of Christ and tying them up and dipping them in tar, lighting
[time=2758] them on fire and using them as torches at garden parties.
[time=2763] Nero is feeding children, women and men wrapped in sheep's wool to hungry lions for sport.
[time=2773] And Paul knows it.
[time=2776] I think that was part of it.
[time=2778] I got to believe there was a part in a guy like Paul's heart that even though he knew that was going on there, he longed to be there to encourage those people to stand for what was right.
[time=2790] And you know what else?
[time=2792] Don's on me this week as I'm thinking this through, and I might be off on this.
[time=2795] I might be right, but it dawns on me that his longing to be in Rome may have had something
[time=2801] to do with the fact that he begins to realize what God's doing with him.
[time=2805] He begins to realize now after three grueling journeys, kingdom advancing,
[time=2811] eternity altering journeys, and having seen with his own eyes and felt and experienced in his own heart the work of God and the hearts and lives of thousands of people.
[time=2821] It dawns on me this week as I'm thinking about this, that they said back in those days, "All roads led to where?" Okay, now think about that.
[time=2829] All roads, all the then known roads led to Rome, which means Rome is where you'd start
[time=2837] from to get to everywhere else.
[time=2842] And so it's like he's dying to get to Rome.
[time=2845] And he knows it may endanger his life, he knows he may not survive it, but there's Christians being tortured, he wants to stand by, and there are roads to walk.
[time=2856] There are paths to follow.
[time=2858] There is a whole new world to get to with the gospel as he thinks about this place called Rome.
[time=2866] Some truth to take home.
[time=2868] Thanks for bearing with me.
[time=2870] Big overview I know, but I want you to think about some things.
[time=2874] Will you?
[time=2875] As you leave this morning, maybe you won't write these things down.
[time=2878] Some truth to take home.
[time=2881] Number one, and I took it home with me this week as well.
[time=2885] So consider you and me as kind of wrestling and grappling with these things together.
[time=2889] Number one, please don't ever forget this, folks.
[time=2892] Never, never automatically remove any possibility from your life, okay?
[time=2900] Don't do it.
[time=2902] Don't ever, because you think, because you think you've got it figured out,
[time=2909] because you think you understand the agenda for you and your future and what it looks like as far as ministry, what it looks like as far as where you'll live, what it looks like as far as what you'll do, what it looks like as far as how you envision it.
[time=2923] Please don't ever for a moment automatically nicks something that happens to come across your path.
[time=2929] Maybe small, maybe big.
[time=2932] Don't ever do that, because you and I have absolutely zero.
[time=2936] We have no idea what he has in store for you.
[time=2945] Paul was pastoring a church in Antioch.
[time=2949] He had his hands full.
[time=2951] Barnabas sent from Jerusalem.
[time=2953] They got this thing going in Antioch.
[time=2955] People were coming to Christ.
[time=2957] There was a lot of work to be done.
[time=2959] He could have, as I often do, sit, "Man, give me the next 20 years.
[time=2962] I'll take a crack at this if you'll give me help." And boom, one day the Spirit comes and says, "You know what?
[time=2967] The outer most parts of the world."
[time=2974] Be open.
[time=2977] Write that down.
[time=2978] Be open with your life.
[time=2980] Loose, grip it.
[time=2982] No white knuckles.
[time=2986] Some of you don't like your life right now.
[time=2988] So you're saying, "Hey, where's that nudge?
[time=2990] I'll do anything.
[time=2991] Just get me out of not knowing what I'm doing." Others of you love what you're doing.
[time=2995] And you're going, "I'm just going to hang on to this agenda because this is what I want to do and this is where I want to be and this is what my life's going to look like." Now, loose, loose people, loose grip.
[time=3004] No white knuckles.
[time=3005] See what he has for you.
[time=3009] New ministry, new friendship.
[time=3011] I'm talking all the way across the board here.
[time=3013] All of life.
[time=3014] New ministry, new location, new friendship, new job.
[time=3021] I mean, all kinds of stuff.
[time=3023] Be open.
[time=3026] Secondly, let me say this to you.
[time=3027] Though involved and active, again, we go back to chapter 13.
[time=3032] They were involved in ministry and the spirit spoke.
[time=3036] And I just want to encourage you on a very personal level that I hope you're involved
[time=3042] and I hope you're active.
[time=3044] Many of you are just kind of right on the verge of being more involved and more active.
[time=3050] Jump.
[time=3051] Jump, all right?
[time=3052] Go ahead.
[time=3053] Get your feet wet.
[time=3054] Roll up your sleeves.
[time=3055] There are so many things to be done around this place.
[time=3058] I still need help in so many areas.
[time=3061] I hope that you would all heed to the encouragement we saw here in chapter 13 where they were involved in ministry and there since the leading.
[time=3070] Understand though, this, that while involved in ministry, they still sensed the leading.
[time=3075] They listened.
[time=3077] And I just want to say to you, every one of you, that as you're involved and given to ministry, where are those times of listening?
[time=3085] Where are those times where you do while being active and giving and exercising your spiritual gifts?
[time=3091] Where are those times in your day?
[time=3094] Where are those times in your week where you do allow the spirit of God to move and speak, where you do allow the Word of God to bring conviction and remind, where you do allow friends, the people of God and the spirit of God and the Word of God to bring across your path things you need to see.
[time=3109] Are you listening while serving?
[time=3113] And thirdly, I want to say this, and then we'll go.
[time=3117] When you do here, and this is the scary part, and it's confusing too because this whole idea of the spirit of God moving,
[time=3125] it's a little different today than it was then you get the impression he just back here just said, "Hey, I want you to go." And so today we pray for that and we look for that and we try to remain open to that.
[time=3138] And as you remain open to his leading, and as I remain open to what he may have for me or for us,
[time=3144] please be willing to do what this young fledgling church did.
[time=3150] When God said, "Set apart for me, Barnabas and Saul." When God in essence said, "Here's my direction for you." They obeyed.
[time=3161] They went, they did what he asked them to do, and I know it's basic.
[time=3166] But as we live our lives together, and as we walk down this road called following Christ, people,
[time=3172] there will be times and there will be days when he will say to you.
[time=3176] And the word of God will support it, and the people of God will affirm it.
[time=3180] The spirit of God will make it clear as well.
[time=3184] And it may be something you've been dying to do, and you'll say, "Wow, let me add it." It may be something that scares you to death.
[time=3191] That doesn't make sense.
[time=3193] And so be open, loose grip.
[time=3196] And when he says go, when he says do, when he says initiate, when he says to you, whatever it is, he says do it.
[time=3205] Do it wholeheartedly.
[time=3207] Do it gladly.
[time=3209] Hey, before we get out of here this morning, I just want to, I hope this encourages you.
[time=3213] It sure did me when I saw it.
[time=3215] We're kind of celebrating today these missionary journeys.
[time=3219] This is the third portion of that great command where you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem,
[time=3226] Judea Samaria, and the outermost parts of the world.
[time=3229] And you know, it's one thing to read about the first time it happened.
[time=3234] And it's another thing, and it's extremely exciting for me to realize that today, even from this church, there are people all over the world today,
[time=3246] giving their hearts and lives to helping seekers, both saved and searching, find and follow him.
[time=3253] And these were the first missionary journeys.
[time=3256] And the missionary journeys ever since have not ceased.
[time=3261] And we put together Ed and Beth and some others worked on putting together for you this morning just a glimpse.
[time=3267] And we're going to show it to you right now, just a quick little video montage.
[time=3271] And it's more than just a video, these pictures that you're about to see are our people.
[time=3276] These are people that we support.
[time=3278] They're here in Fort Wayne, they're across the United States, and they're across the world.
[time=3282] And they are giving themselves to the proclamation of truth and the very thing we just watched Paul do over those eight chapters.
[time=3289] So be encouraged and be thankful.
[time=3291] And as you watch and you'll see some that you recognize and some that you don't just know that every one of these people,
[time=3297] we as a family, pray for and support on a regular basis.
[time=3301] And because of that, the gospel is growing even to this day.
[time=3304] Paul began it.
[time=3306] Back there on that first trip from Antioch with Barnabas, and today it continues to take place.
[time=3311] So be thankful and be encouraged as you see just a brief missions overview from Blackhawk Ministries.
