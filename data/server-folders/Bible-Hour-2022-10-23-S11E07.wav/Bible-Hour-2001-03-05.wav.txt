[time=0] The church that makes God sick.
[time=5] We're going to look at a church today that Christ said was lukewarm.
[time=9] And he looks at it and he says, "Guys, I wish you were either cold or hot.
[time=15] I hate this lukewarmness." Basically he says, "You make me sick." And we're going to talk about what that means.

[time=751] When Jim came to Fort Wayne, it was a great thing for Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=759] Jim and Linda served here while he went to seminary.
[time=763] Linda taught kindergarten and now she teaches now sixth grade in our elementary.
[time=768] And they went to Fargo, North Dakota in 1992.
[time=773] And then came back here three and a half years ago.
[time=776] And what I remember most about Jim in the days that I got to work with him,
[time=782] other than the fact that he was the greatest trivial pursuit player I've ever known on the planet, was the fact that he was so called to proclaim the gospel, that he just couldn't do anything else.
[time=797] He and Linda were enjoying success in the marketplace, but God put his hand on Jim to do this,
[time=804] and he's been faithful.
[time=807] It's good to introduce somebody that you know, I can tell you this, he's a good husband.
[time=811] He's a good dad, and he's faithful to proclaim the truth that Brookside Church today, as he did before here and at Fargo.
[time=821] And it's my privilege to introduce Jim and thank him for coming.
[time=828] [APPLAUSE]
[time=835] It is great to be here.
[time=837] What a joy to come back.
[time=838] I stood in this pulpit about nine years ago, almost to this day, and shared with this congregation that I had been called to Bethel Evangelical Free Church in Fargo, North Dakota.
[time=848] And it was shortly after they wanted me in three weeks, and Pastor Russ let me leave with three weeks notice,
[time=855] and I was able to get out there, and we had five wonderful years of ministry on the frozen tundra of North Dakota.
[time=862] Five great years of ministry, people ask me if I missed North Dakota, I say like I would a root canal.
[time=868] It was so cold, but we had five great years of ministry, Bethel Evangelical Free Church is still going well,
[time=874] but we were ready to come back, and now we're at Brookside, and the Lord is blessing at Brookside, and it is just a privilege to be here this morning and to share with you from this pulpit one more time.
[time=885] Probably I'm going to guess maybe only a third of you were here when I left about nine years ago, but we had many, many friends here, some of you don't know it, but many of you friends were great sermon illustrations when I was in Fargo, and I got to share all kinds of stories about you, you know, and you never got a chance to hear them.
[time=903] Anyway, we're here today to preach God's Word, and I'm excited about that.
[time=908] I'm preaching on a message this morning that I've titled The Church That Makes God Sick.
[time=914] If you haven't turned there, turn with me already now to Revelation chapter three.
[time=918] In a little while, we're going to look at verses 14 to 22.
[time=922] The church that makes God sick.
[time=925] We're going to look at a church today that Christ said was lukewarm.
[time=929] And he looks at it, and he says, "Guys, I wish you were either cold or hot.
[time=935] I hate this lukewarmness." Basically he says, "You make me sick." And we're going to talk about what that means.
[time=941] And I believe that's a challenge for Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=944] I believe it's a challenge for Brookside.
[time=947] I believe it's a challenge for churches all over America today to not become lukewarm,
[time=953] but to be the disciple-making ministries that God wants us to be.
[time=958] Let's pray together. We'll get into God's Word.
[time=960] Father, thank you for the time that we have had today to lift our voices and worship you.
[time=966] And now as we turn to your Word, I just pray that you would just bless immensely now.
[time=972] Help us to have ears to hear. Open hearts.
[time=976] May you take the Word and may it be firmly planted in our hearts that it may grow and just germinate and grow into the deepest aspect of our being.
[time=985] Father, change us through the proclamation of your Word in Christ's name.
[time=990] [AMEN] Several years ago, I had the distinct privilege of ministering in the great nation of India for a two-week period.
[time=999] When I went back, the following year administered for two more weeks.
[time=1003] I quickly fell in love with the Indian people and it was a great time of ministry, but what I struggled with the most was the lack of luxuries, the lack of creature comforts that we take for granted here in America.
[time=1016] I had been told not to drink Indian water, to always have bottled water, but it just seemed impossible to always have an ample supply of bottled water around when you needed it.
[time=1026] I took bad with that. I also took bad with the air pollution.
[time=1029] I'm given to a little upper respiratory problem to begin with, and the air pollution was horrible. At times, I was almost nauseated by the fumes just belching from the cars and the vans and the trucks and the motorcycles.
[time=1042] It was just like a cloud that hung over that capital city of Delhi.
[time=1046] But you know what I struggled with the most? It kind of surprised me.
[time=1049] I struggled the most with the lack of refrigeration.
[time=1052] It was really hot and every day we ministered for hours and hours in the heat, and most days we walked a tremendous distance, and if you didn't have your water with you or if you ran out of water, you would have a long time before you could quench your thirst with a nice cold drink.
[time=1068] Well, one day we'd been ministering for much of the day.
[time=1071] We had been ministering and we'd been teaching a group of Indian pastors, and as we left and started to head back toward the village, we were walking, which seemed like miles and miles and miles.
[time=1083] And we all were out of water by that time. Our bottled water was gone.
[time=1087] Our throats were parched. I was getting light-headed, a little dizzy.
[time=1090] I even felt like maybe I was starting to get a little a bit of sickness coming
[time=1096] from the fact that I hadn't had any water for quite some time, where we're going down a hill, coming back into the city where we would go, and as I looked, I saw a very familiar sign, a red sign that said, "Ice-cold Coca-Cola." I couldn't resist it. I broke into a run.
[time=1113] I headed toward the marketplace where that sign was.
[time=1116] I didn't care if it would cost 100,000 Indian rupees.
[time=1119] I was going to get an ice-cold Coca-Cola as I was traveling toward that sign, making a beeline for it. As I was, I had pictured in my mind a plastic cup like you get at McDonald's, filled with ice, filled with frothy Coca-Cola, something that I could take and just, you know, belt down and relieve the thirst that was just killing me at that moment.
[time=1139] I got there. I told them, "Give me the biggest Coke you got." They didn't have glasses like McDonald's.
[time=1143] They just had this 12-ounce can. I popped the top.
[time=1146] I took some, a great big slug of it, about a half of the can, and I learned something real quick. Ice-cold in India is lukewarm.
[time=1157] And on that particular day, lukewarm was 96 degrees.
[time=1162] You know, I don't know about you, but I hate anything that's lukewarm.
[time=1166] I have never once in my life woken up in the morning and said to Linda, "You know, I just can't wait to go into that bathroom and take a long lukewarm shower." I've never walked into a restaurant and said to the waitress, "Hey, would you bring me a glass of ice tea?" But before you do, pop it in the microwave and melt the ice because I really like my ice tea lukewarm.
[time=1184] I never came home from school when I was a kid and came to the door and said to my mother, "Mom, would you pour me please a nice lukewarm glass of curdled milk?" You know, I never did that. I don't suppose you like lukewarm things either.
[time=1198] I don't know if Jesus liked lukewarm milk or not, but I know this.
[time=1202] He hated lukewarm churches. He hated lukewarm churches.
[time=1207] In our text for this morning, we're going to see that Jesus Christ looks at a church, the church at Laodicea, and He's going to tell them, "I want you to know you make me sick. I look at you, and I see what's going on, and you make me want to throw up."
[time=1223] It's basically what He is saying in the text.
[time=1226] Well, there were lukewarm churches in the time that John wrote the book of Revelation, and there are lukewarm churches today.
[time=1233] You know what I believe? I believe America today is full of lukewarm churches,
[time=1239] churches that have lost their mission, lost their vision.
[time=1243] They're no longer making disciples as they once were.
[time=1247] And I believe America needs a tremendous revival in its churches.
[time=1251] To get that mission back that says, "We're going to go out, and we're going to make disciples in America and all around the world." Jesus hated lukewarm churches.
[time=1262] This morning, let's look at a scathing letter that Jesus sent to the church at Laodicea.
[time=1266] I'm not going to take the entire text all at once. I'll take it as I go.
[time=1270] Preaching purposes, I've divided this letter basically into four sections, and they'll come up on the screen.
[time=1275] We're going to examine the setting in the speaker, and then the sin, next the solution, and finally the success and the summons.
[time=1284] This morning, first of all, I want us to look at what I've called the setting and the speaker.
[time=1288] I want to set the table for what Jesus has to say to this church in Laodicea.
[time=1293] I'm going to read the first verse, and I'm going to stop there for now, and then we'll go into the other verses a little bit later this morning.
[time=1300] Jesus writes to the angel of the church in Laodicea, right.
[time=1305] These are the words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the ruler of God's creation.
[time=1313] Now, when he says to the angel of the church in Laodicea, you have to understand the context here.
[time=1319] Basically, Jesus is giving these letters to the seven churches in a vision to John as he is on the island of Patmos.
[time=1327] And John then records what's given to him by Jesus, and he takes it and delivers it to the church.
[time=1333] Now, when it says to the angel, that comes from a Greek word, angolas, which in Scripture, most of the time, is translated angel.
[time=1341] However, it can also mean messenger.
[time=1344] And in this particular context, I believe what he's talking about is the messenger to the church, the one who takes God's word to the church, and Jesus' words to the church, and probably this is the pastor, who would then read the letter to the entire congregation.
[time=1360] And so, basically, what he is saying here is to the pastor of the church in Laodicea, write this, and then he'll read it to his congregation.
[time=1369] Now, I want to talk about the city for a few moments, the city of Laodicea.
[time=1373] The city of Laodicea was truly one of the great cities of the world in that day. It was known for its tremendous prosperity and for the affluence of its people.
[time=1384] It was a great commercial center, a banking center, and inside of its bank walls were tremendous amounts of gold and silver and Roman currency. It was known as a commercial center.
[time=1395] It was also known as a manufacturing center.
[time=1398] And in their plants, they manufactured a black, glossy, shiny wool that was woven into very expensive clothing.
[time=1406] It was a very high, high grade of wool.
[time=1409] It was also a leading medical center in that day.
[time=1411] It had a medical school.
[time=1413] And at that medical school, in the research facility, they had developed an ointment for the eye that would cure many of the ailments of the eye that you could have in those days.
[time=1423] This was a prosperous city.
[time=1425] In the year 60 AD, when an earthquake came and basically leveled the entire city, the city of Laodicea told the Roman Empire, "We don't need your help," and they basically rebuilt the entire city from their own money from the citizens of the city.
[time=1440] It was prosperous, but the city had one problem.
[time=1443] It had outgrown its water supply. It had horrible water.
[time=1448] And as a result of that, it had to have its water piped in and it brought its water in from two cities that came from nearby.
[time=1455] I'll talk about that in a few moments, but that's the city of Laodicea.
[time=1460] God's people in Laodicea were affluent.
[time=1464] They were worldly. They were self-reliant.
[time=1467] They had everything. They were materialistic.
[time=1471] And God's people now were ready to receive.
[time=1474] They weren't ready for what would come, but they were about to receive a stinging rebuke. Now notice the way Jesus describes himself here.
[time=1481] He says, "First of all, these are the words of the Amen." Why did he call himself the Amen?
[time=1488] Basically, "Amen" means "so be it." It means it is true.
[time=1493] A long time ago in many churches, and still in some churches today, it was common for someone to shout, "Amen!" When a pastor would preach something which had great power or truth in it, the person would sit in the back and they'd shout, "Amen!" When I left Fort Wayne and went to Fargo, I went up to minister to a part of the country that is 90% Scandinavian,
[time=1517] Norwegian, and Swedish. And they're wonderful people, but they're very reserved, very, very quiet.
[time=1523] They don't say a whole lot. They're not very demonstrative.
[time=1525] They're not the type of people that are going to talk a lot, or have a lot of small talk, but they're very steady.
[time=1531] But they don't say much. Well, you know, I wasn't used to preaching in that kind of an environment, but along about the third year I was there, God took a southern Baptist guy from Atlanta, Georgia and transferred him to Fargo, North Dakota.
[time=1545] Now, Charlie was his name. Charlie was a southern Baptist, and there's only three words that can describe Charlie.
[time=1551] Loud, bombastic, and hyperactive.
[time=1555] Charlie was really into it.
[time=1557] And I remember the first Sunday Charlie came to my church, and he came in and he met me, and he said, "You must be Brother Jim." And I said, "That's right, I am Brother Jim." He says, "Well, Brother Jim, I want you to know I'm looking forward to worship in here today. I'm with you, Brother Jim." Charlie was the first guy I've ever met who could take Jim and make it a two-syllable word. He would say, "I'm with you, Brother Jim." Well, he went into the worship service, and Charlie got excited, and his head was nodding, and he was bouncing around on his chair, and finally, I don't know what I said, but I said something that tickled his Baptist heart, and he just stood up, and he pumped his fist up in the air like Tiger Woods when he sinks a 40-foot pot, and he goes, "Amen, Brother Jim!"
[time=1602] And 800 Norwegians went.
[time=1609] About that time, a lady came to my church from inner city Minneapolis.
[time=1613] She'd grown up in an inner city church, and she started coming to the church, and old Charlie would amen, and she'd sit in the back, and one time as I was preaching, I'd hit up a special point, and she said, "Help him, Lord! Help him!" You know what? I heard my feelings.
[time=1629] And then I figured out what she was saying. See, what she was saying was, "It's true. He's preaching God's Word. Help him, Lord. Help him to say it." Saying, "You're right, pastor. Keep up the good work." Well, Jesus is saying here, "I am the embodiment of truth." What I say is perfectly accurate. Every word I speak is absolute truth.
[time=1652] I am the embodiment of certainty and veracity. Now, notice he says next, "Faithful and true witness," and this carries it a little bit further.
[time=1660] "A witness is one who speaks truth, especially in regard to what he or she has seen or heard."
[time=1666] Jesus is saying, "I am about to speak the truth in regard to what is going on in my church."
[time=1673] And then notice he finishes the description by saying, "I am the ruler of God's creation."
[time=1679] "The one who is in charge of all things." Now, why did Jesus describe himself in this way to this particular church?
[time=1686] And in the seven letters, he describes himself differently in every one.
[time=1690] He was tailoring his description for this church because he knew that what he was about to say was going to shock them. It was going to surprise them.
[time=1700] They were about to find out that the Lord's evaluation of their church was much different from what they would have expected.
[time=1706] They needed to be reminded that Jesus always speaks truth and that no matter how high and mighty a church might become,
[time=1714] God is still the one who is in charge.
[time=1717] And Jesus is saying, "I am going to let you know that because you are not going to like what I am about to say, but I am in charge and I am the great Amen. What I say is truth." So he'd my word this morning.
[time=1728] The worldly materialistic, self-reliant, lukewarm church was about to receive a scathing rebuke.
[time=1736] So let's move on to that.
[time=1738] We look next at the sin, the sin. It's found in verses 15 to 17.
[time=1743] Jesus says, "I know your deeds." Man, I know all about what's going on in your church.
[time=1748] That you are neither cold nor hot.
[time=1750] I wish you were either one or the other.
[time=1752] So because you are warm, neither hot nor cold, I am about to spit you out of my mouth.
[time=1758] You say I'm rich.
[time=1760] I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing.
[time=1763] But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked.
[time=1769] Can you imagine the scene in this church?
[time=1772] This church is gathered waiting to hear their pastor read this letter.
[time=1777] They were probably dressed in their Sunday best, sitting there saying to themselves, "I wonder what he's going to say to praise us this morning." I wonder what the pastor is going to say.
[time=1786] Maybe Jesus is going to praise us for our beautiful new building.
[time=1789] Isn't it magnificent? And it's debt free too.
[time=1792] Maybe he was saying to themselves, "Maybe he'll praise us for our disaster relief to the poor during the earthquake.
[time=1798] Maybe he'll praise us for our food pantry.
[time=1801] Maybe he'll praise us for starting a rescue mission." That's not what he does.
[time=1806] Maybe he'll praise us for wearing such fine clothes when we come to church in honor of him, but that's not what they heard.
[time=1812] They didn't hear any praise.
[time=1814] His words are straight and they're direct.
[time=1817] First of all, he says, "I know your deeds.
[time=1820] I know your deeds.
[time=1822] I know exactly what's going on.
[time=1824] I see it all.
[time=1826] You're giving maybe up.
[time=1827] Your attendance maybe up.
[time=1828] Your shiny new building is magnificent.
[time=1830] But when I look at the soul of your church, I'm sickened and I'm repulsed.
[time=1834] I see a church that is lukewarm and lukewarm Christianity makes me sick."
[time=1840] Now, first let me explain the historical background of our Lord's statement and then I'll explain what I firmly believe the Lord is saying here.
[time=1846] First of all, Laodicea had a chronic water shortage as I alluded to earlier and so it had outgrown its water supply.
[time=1853] And so it piped its water in from two cities.
[time=1856] One was the city of Heropolis and it piped in hot water.
[time=1860] Heropolis had a hot spring from which its water came.
[time=1863] It was wonderful hot water for bathing, for soaking your aching muscles in.
[time=1868] And they would pipe it in but by the time it got to Laodicea, it was lukewarm.
[time=1874] And then they piped water in from Colossi.
[time=1877] Colossi had ice cold, refreshing cold spring water.
[time=1881] It was delicious.
[time=1882] But again, by the time they pumped it in or piped it in, I should say, to the city of Laodicea, it had grown lukewarm.
[time=1891] It was no longer what they wanted to drink.
[time=1894] And so, as a result, Laodicea was filled with lousy, unrefreshing lukewarm water.
[time=1901] Lukewarm water is not appealing.
[time=1903] Lukewarm water is kind of sickening, I think.
[time=1906] Now, what exactly is the spiritual application here?
[time=1910] Now, keep your eyes fixed on those verses, but basically there are three temperatures that are represented here.
[time=1916] First of all, there is the cold, and most commentators have applied the following interpretation.
[time=1922] I'm going to give you mine in a moment.
[time=1924] But most have applied this interpretation.
[time=1927] They say that there are three temperatures.
[time=1929] And first of all, the cold would represent those who are turned off or unresponsive to spiritual things and the gospel.
[time=1936] Then they say the hot is those who are on fire for Christ, those that are burning with spiritual passion.
[time=1943] The lukewarm then are those in the church who are religious, but not born again.
[time=1948] Some have said it's those who are not true believers.
[time=1950] Others have said the lukewarm are kind of a mixture of unsaved, and those that are saved but backslidden.
[time=1956] And personally, I think that this traditional interpretation tries to read too much into the text.
[time=1962] I think it's actually pretty simple.
[time=1964] This is what I believe Jesus is saying.
[time=1966] Cold water is good.
[time=1968] It's delicious to drink.
[time=1971] And hot water is good.
[time=1973] It's good to bathe in.
[time=1975] And it's enjoyable to soak our muscles in it, our bodies in it.
[time=1979] But lukewarm water isn't good.
[time=1982] And when he says I wish you were either cold or hot, he's saying cold's good, hot's good, but lukewarm isn't good.
[time=1990] And that's the picture that Jesus is showing them.
[time=1993] I know how much you hate your water.
[time=1995] I want you to know that's how I see your church.
[time=1997] Lukewarm and it's repulsive.
[time=2000] Your Christianity is like lukewarm water.
[time=2003] Now notice he says I'm about to spit you out of my mouth.
[time=2007] And that too has raised a lot of speculation as to what he means by that.
[time=2012] As he's saying that they're unbelievers and therefore he's consigning them to eternal destruction.
[time=2017] Couldn't be believers because we believe in eternal security.
[time=2020] And I believe that from the bottom of my heart.
[time=2022] And people have tried to figure all this out.
[time=2024] Again, I think some have tried to make this a statement of eternal punishment or rejection.
[time=2030] I take exception to that too.
[time=2032] I personally believe that this is a figure of speech called an anthropomorphism.
[time=2037] And basically all Jesus is doing is indicating his disgust for the church.
[time=2043] But I think we're just leave it there.
[time=2045] And I try to make it something that I don't think he's trying to say.
[time=2049] So what is in view here? Well, the church at Laodicea was filled with lukewarm Christians.
[time=2054] There had been a time when their faith was strong and passionate.
[time=2058] But they had cooled in their spiritual fervor.
[time=2060] Their faith was tepid. It was room temperature. It was no longer productive.
[time=2065] He says you make me sick. How did it happen?
[time=2068] Well basically they'd fallen into the trap of materialism and worldliness and self-reliance.
[time=2075] They had everything they could possibly want.
[time=2077] They didn't need God anymore was the attitude that they had.
[time=2082] Their eyes were on things of this world. Look at verse 17 again.
[time=2086] He says you say I am rich. I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing.
[time=2092] But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked.
[time=2098] He's saying you think you got everything.
[time=2101] But actually you're spiritually bankrupt.
[time=2104] Your eyes are on earthly treasure.
[time=2107] And they ought to be on heavenly treasure, heavenly treasure.
[time=2112] You know, I've been a pastor for now for since 1989 when I graduated from seminary and came here to black on Baptist as an associate pastor.
[time=2120] I've been in the ministry since then.
[time=2122] And I don't know how many funerals I've done, probably somewhere between 100 and 200.
[time=2126] You know what? In all of the funerals that I've done, I make the same ride out to the cemetery in the hearse with the funeral director.
[time=2133] Sometimes the family is in the car. Usually they're in a different car.
[time=2136] But you know what? The casket is always in the hearse.
[time=2139] And you know what? I've never seen a U-Haul trailer attached to the back of a hearse.
[time=2146] So you can't take it with you.
[time=2149] Jesus is saying you got your eyes fixed on stuff.
[time=2152] And spiritually you're nowhere.
[time=2155] And that stuff is all going to disappear.
[time=2160] John D. Rockefeller, the great founder of the Standard Oil Company, died at his desk in Cleveland, Ohio at the Standard Oil Building.
[time=2168] And it wasn't long before the word got out to all the people that were around that John D. Rockefeller, the multi-millionaire, had died.
[time=2175] And it wasn't long before a crowd from the press gathered on the front steps of the Standard Oil Building.
[time=2180] And one of the spokesman for the company came out and began answering questions finally as the interview was about over. One of the reporters said, "Hey, when he died this morning, how much money did old John D. Rockefeller leave behind?"
[time=2194] The secretary looked at the reporter and he said, "Well, actually sir, that's rather simple." He left all of it. He left all of it.
[time=2203] See, we get so caught up and we get our eyes off the mission.
[time=2209] And Satan gets our attention on so many things.
[time=2214] And they take us away from what we are called to do, to be on fire for Christ, making disciples, building a church, changing lives one at a time,
[time=2226] and supporting missions throughout the world. This church had forgotten all that.
[time=2232] They had their eyes fixed on the things of this world, and interestingly enough, Jesus doesn't just hang them out to dry here. He gives them a solution.
[time=2240] And that's my third point this morning. He gives them a solution.
[time=2246] I believe that a major problem in American churches today is what was affecting the church at Laodicea.
[time=2256] But we have a solution in verse 18 through 20.
[time=2259] Jesus says, "I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire so you can become rich and white clothes to wear so you can cover your shameful nakedness and salve to put on your eyes so you can see." Now, let's just stop there for a moment.
[time=2276] Earlier, I spoke of three things. I spoke of gold in the bank.
[time=2280] I spoke of black wool and I spoke of ointment.
[time=2283] They were famous commodities for that city. And Jesus draws on those three things to make the point that he wants to make, to share with them what they need to do if they're going to be the church that he wants them to be.
[time=2296] Basically, he says, "I counsel you. This is what I want you to do.
[time=2300] I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire." Now, what is he saying? He's saying there, "I counsel you not to buy the things of this world. Don't get caught up in all that stuff, but rather come to me and buy the pure gold.
[time=2316] Humble yourself. Come before me and I will give you the pure gold. I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire so you can become truly rich. Not rich in the way of worldly things but spiritually rich. Gold before it goes in the crucible or the furnace is impure. It is contaminated with impurities which meld off in the fire. Steve spoke about my business career which ended in 1986.
[time=2344] At the time that I left Omni Source Corporation here in Fort Wayne and went into the ministry in '86, we had at the operation here in Fort Wayne something called a sweat furnace. A sweat furnace was something that you threw metal into that was contaminated and then you stoked up the fire and it took away the impurities. And it was something.
[time=2364] For example, in the aluminum sweat furnace you could just throw old chairs, chaise lounges. You could put wood on them, stainless steel screws.
[time=2372] It's got all kinds of fabric. It didn't make a difference. Just threw it in the sweat furnace. Throw it in the furnace and just crank up the temperature and at certain temperatures everything melts away. You see the wood will burn up quick and the the fabric will burn up quick but each metal melts at a different temperature and so the contaminated aluminum, the stainless steel, would melt at a certain point in the copper and all the others would melt at a certain point when it was all over the aluminum would drain into what's called an ingot and you would have almost not quite but almost 100% pure aluminum and then you could sell it to an aluminum smelter.
[time=2408] Sweat furnace is like a crucible and that's the fire that Jesus is talking about here and he says I want you to buy from me a faith that has gone through the fire that's no longer contaminated, a pure and undefiled faith, a faith undefiled by the contamination of worldliness and materialism, a faith undefiled by a love for this world. Basically what he's saying is quit living, quit living with one foot in the kingdom and one foot firmly planted in the world and if you quit doing that I'll make you truly rich. I'll make you truly rich. Then notice what he says next, he says, buy from me also quite close to where so you can cover your shameful nakedness. Basically white clothing, bright clothing means to perform righteous deeds. When you see brighter white clothing in scripture, especially in this type of literature, what we have here is the idea of righteous deeds as opposed to unrighteous deeds which would be dark.
[time=2468] He said, get rid of that dark wool that you care about so much and put on white clothing, perform righteous deeds.
[time=2476] Basically what he's saying is you're spiritually naked, it's shameful put on the white clothing of righteous obedient living.
[time=2484] And then in the third part of verse 18 he says and save to put on your eyes so you can see.
[time=2492] He's saying, let me anoint your eyes. Let me anoint your eyes so you can see yourself as you really are. Let the Holy Spirit open your eyes. And then verse 19 very importantly to those who my love I rebuke and discipline so be earnest and repent. What he's saying there is turn back to me now before I'm forced to discipline you.
[time=2520] Christ disciplines those he loves.
[time=2524] All too often we forget that. In Revelation chapter 2 when he writes his letter to the church at Ephesus, when he writes his letter to the church at Ephesus he says if you don't turn things around, if you don't turn things around you know what I'm going to do, I'm going to come in and I'm going to remove your lamp stand and I'm going to take it away. What he's saying there is I'm going to visit your church in judgment not a final judgment, that comes in the future. But I'm going to visit your church now right here in the church age and I'm going to remove your lamp stand which basically is his way of saying it's going to be turn out the lights because the party's over. I can't stand it if you can't change I'm going to have to discipline you.
[time=2564] Folks that's happened in American churches. I believe Christ has visited them and Christ has removed their lamp stand and there are churches that have closed their doors or have shrunk to very very small congregations of ineffective ministries because Christ has removed his hand of blessing from them. He has visited them in judgment. He has removed their lamp stand. May it never be at Black Hawk Ministries or Brookside Church that we should ever fall into that type of a situation.
[time=2596] Jesus says repent now, turn things around I don't want to do it but I'm going to discipline you if you make me if you don't repent. And then we have that well known verse from scripture verse 20. He says here I am I stand at the door and knock and if anyone hears my voice and opens the door I will come in and eat with him and he with me.
[time=2628] Now that's used as an evangelistic verse most of the time. However it's used as an invitation to the unsaved most of the time but in context it's an appeal to the church. He's saying here you've shut me out let me back in. I want to be a part of your church again. Immune with me and let me empower you and abide in you. I'm here let me in right now. I'm getting sick. These people were not abiding in Christ. Friends you can't abide in Christ on five minutes of prayer a day.
[time=2664] The pastoral staff of this church cannot pastor this church and abide in Christ on 15 minutes of prayer a day.
[time=2672] Jesus says let me back in.
[time=2676] I want to abide in you and I want you to abide in me.
[time=2680] I want you to get back to the spiritual disciplines of life that you once had.
[time=2684] Your church has just gotten so far off base and it makes me sick. Humble yourselves before me get back the way it used to be because right now I got to tell you guys you're making me sick. I came across a letter in preparation for this message. It's an imaginary letter from Jesus to the church an imaginary letter from Jesus to the church goes like this. Dear Christians this is my commission to you. In fact you might even call it a great commission. You are to go to all people everywhere and call them to become my disciples.
[time=2728] You're to baptize them and teach them to obey all that I have commanded you don't forget I will be with you always to help you even to the end of the world. I will never leave you nor forsake you because I love you. Please don't forsake me with all my love Jesus Christ.
[time=2748] This is an imaginary church and it's humorous it says dear Jesus Christ we acknowledge the receipt of your recent communication. Your proposal is both interesting and challenging however due to a shortage of personnel especially in the children's department Greg Deason paid me 20 bucks to say that as well as several other financial and personal considerations we do not feel that we can give proper emphasis to your challenge at this time. A committee has been appointed to study the feasibility of the plan. We should have a report to bring to our congregation sometime in the future you may rest assured that we will give this our careful consideration and our board will be praying for you and your efforts to find additional disciples we do appreciate your offer to serve as a resource person and should we decide to undertake this project at some point in the future we'll get back to you.
[time=2808] The American church needs a revival. One of my friends in life I haven't seen him for a couple of years now I talk to him occasionally is a great man by the name of Dr. Bob Bakke who is the General Director of the National Prayer Advance. He hosts the National Day of Prayer television broadcast every year. He spoke in my church in Fargo several times and he's been to my church at Brookside a couple of years ago to speak about prayer and revival. But Dr. Bakke has told me that revival is coming and revival is happening all around the world but it's not happening in America Revival is not going to occur until God's people are on their knees and a revival begins in my heart and your heart
[time=2860] [AMEN] Just say amen.
[time=2872] Dr. David Youngy Cho pastor of the largest church in the world sent a group of his people to study the American church and they spent time with American churches. They visited the small churches the mega churches they visited American Christianity and they said something which when they left it just struck me like a dagger. Speaking of the American church Dr. Cho's church people which number about 250,000 in Seoul Korea. Dr. Cho's spokesperson said at the airport we find it amazing what American Christians have been able to accomplish without the Holy Spirit wow what an indictment saying you got mega churches and you got all the resources and you got everything America Christians could possibly want but you're doing it in your own strength you're doing it in the flesh why I thought of that this week when I was reading this text again Jesus is there and he's saying let me in let me in I want to empower you I want to fill you I want to help you use the gifts I've given to your church and I want you to turn the world upside down for me that's the challenge but you know what revival begins in your heart and my heart and then it begins to grow in a church and then it grows from a church and spreads to a city and then to a state and then to a nation and we need millions and millions of millions of American Christians praying for revival in America today did you know Dr. Bakke taught me all this that there has never been a revival anywhere worldwide that wasn't first preceded by praying Christians sometimes for years and years before God sent revival according to his sovereign plan we need a revival and it starts with you and me we need to do it may it start at Blackhawk may it started Brookside and may it started other Fort Wayne churches and spread throughout Indiana and America and around the world well there's a fourth point that I want to make this morning I call it the success and the summons versus 21 and 22 let me read them for you he says to him who overcomes I will give the right to sit with me on my throne just as I overcame and sat down with my father on his throne he who has an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches now what a promise we have he says to those who overcome basically Christians true believers are overcomers that's what the Bible refers to as 1 John 5 I believe it's 1 John 5 5 or 15 speaks about all Christians being overcomers and if that be true and we have this promise to overcome I will give the right to sit with me on my throne just as I overcame and sat down with my father on his throne when we have this promise how dare we be lukewarm how dare we be lukewarm in our faith Christ has prepared for us a wonderful future when he says to him who overcomes I'm going to give you a chance to sit with me on my throne just as I overcame and sat down with my father on his throne what he's saying there is as true believers you are overcomers and one day you're going to come and sit on a throne when I reign in my earthly kingdom and you're going to reign with me someday you know what Christ says we're overcomers you know what that tells me we need to live like it we need to live like it as world changers with the power of God working in us and then he closes with this beautiful beautiful close he says he who has an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches he's saying heat my words take my message to heart lukewarm Christianity makes me sick repent now allow me in beloved the American church needs a revival
[time=3156] we look good we have buildings and programs and mega churches and we're doing a lot of stuff but you know what 85% to as many as 90% of American churches are either plateaued or in decline in America today they need to let Jesus back in and I believe that the reason that they're declining is not because they haven't gone to a church growth seminar it's not because they haven't read all the books by Bill Highables and Rick Warren and all the ones that are out there and that's good stuff and I've got it sitting on my desk and I read it regularly
[time=3201] those things are good and they help us but programs and stuff don't build churches only Christ builds churches and he said I will build my church and the gates of hell will not prevail against it what he was saying was my church will overcome and I want to say it again if we're to be overcomers then let's start living like overcomers who can conquer the world for Jesus Christ turn up the heat I want to challenge you this morning are you in need of a revival in your heart have you drifted in your faith
[time=3255] gotten away from that fervor that power that was once there when you were growing in your faith you know we drift and it doesn't happen overnight it takes time I like to call it spiritual dry rod for you see we get out of the car on Sunday morning we close the door we're dressed up in our Sunday best we have a smile on our face we walk into the building we carry our Bible we shake hands on the outside everything looks good but all too many times on the inside this process of dry rod is taking place have you ever broken the branch off of a tree and it was dry rod on the inside it looked great on the outside didn't it but it decayed on the outside and it worked its way out and finally it showed for Christianity for Christians spiritual dry rod begins in the heart and with a drifting in our soul and it works its way out but by the time the outer world sees it often its too late you need a revival in your heart are you regularly abiding in Christ spending time with him allowing him to to work in you and help you to be fruit for one ministry I pray that you are I want to say it one more time I firmly believe it that if churches in Fort Wayne, Indiana that are preaching the gospel the life-changing gospel of Jesus Christ not only preaching it but living it are willing to be world changers then I believe this city can be turned upside down and I believe this state can be turned upside down this nation can be turned upside down and this generation will know that Christ visited in a mighty Holy Spirit filled revival in churches all across America I believe that I believe you believe it as well let's pray toward that end let's never get to be like the church at Laodicea Father thank you for these friends that are here today I thank you for each and every one of them for their faithfulness I thank you for this ministry for what it has meant to this community for so long Father I think of the spiritual gifts that are represented in this room right now I think of the power I think of the resources I think of all that you have given to this church and Father I think of my congregation which right now is in the middle of its third service and I just pray that you would bless them as Scott Wagner preaches the word at Brookside right this minute Father I pray that our churches would be turned upside down I pray that we would be revived thank you Father for the gift of your word May we take it forth and make disciples in Christ's name Amen before you go when I was in India I went with a great man by the name of Dr. Ben Sawatsky Dr. Sawatsky shared something with us as we debriefed one night after a time of ministry he was talking about the importance of passion and he looked at me and as we spoke about passion he said Jim always remember this passionless men ignite no fires and passionate leaders passionless leaders attract no followers it's passion passion makes the difference in the power of the Spirit living in us do you have a passion for Christ a passion to change the world God will bless it and we can do it For Cassette Calvier today's message please call and request the take number shown The Bible hour is made possible by the support of the Founders Club members if you'd like to join the Founders Club please write to us here's our address the Bible hour 7400 East State Fort Wayne, Indiana or if you'd like please call for information this is Craig Volker on behalf of the entire Bible hour staff inviting you to join us each week for the Bible hour
