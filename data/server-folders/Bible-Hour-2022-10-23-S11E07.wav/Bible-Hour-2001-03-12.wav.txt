[time=0] (upbeat music) - Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service
[time=12] of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=14] Thank you for joining us.
[time=15] We trust that the music and message from God's word will help you in your Christian walk.
[time=20] Now let's join our service.
[time=22] - Well, I am excited about this morning.
[time=24] I'm excited about this morning to be together in the House of God, number one, to be together as brothers and sisters.
[time=29] And you know, Kelly's gonna preach in a few minutes about the art of staying at it.
[time=33] The art of staying at it, and I don't know about you, but Monday through Saturday is pretty tough sometimes.
[time=38] And the art of staying at it is often difficult.
[time=42] I think the Psalm is probably says it best.
[time=45] Psalm 18, he says this, I love the O Lord, my strength, the Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, my God, my rock and whom I take refuge, my shield and my horn of salvation, my stronghold.
[time=58] I call upon the Lord who is worthy to be praised, and I am saved from my enemies.
[time=64] Psalm 18, 46 says, the Lord lives and blessed be my rock and exalted be the God of my salvation, God who executes vengeance for me and subdues people under me.
[time=76] He delivers me from my enemies.
[time=79] Surely thou dost lift me above those who rise up against me.
[time=83] Thou dost rescue me from the violent man.
[time=85] Therefore, therefore, why is it therefore?
[time=89] Therefore, I will give thanks to thee among the nations, O Lord, and I will sing praises to thy name.
[time=96] He gives great deliverance to his king and shows loving kindness to his anointed, to David and to his descendants forever.
[time=103] Praise he's getting ready to sing a song, "My Greatest Love." You know, Barbara, we disappointed to find out she's not my greatest love.
[time=112] She's my second greatest love.
[time=114] My greatest love is my God.
[time=117] Like the Psalmist said, my refuge, my strength.
[time=120] Listen as we're led this morning, and let's pray just before they sing with us.
[time=125] Our Heavenly Father, you are our greatest love.
[time=129] You're our refuge, our strength, our stronghold.
[time=132] You're there for us, day in and day out, and we get to come as a people this morning together to praise and worship you.
[time=140] Let us have a great time.
[time=144] Let us really put the weak behind us, and this time together may it be glorious to you in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=153] [MUSIC - 78 seconds]
[time=235] Join us now, every new day.
[time=237] [MUSIC - 125 seconds]
[time=367] - Listen now, it's the praise team continues in worship.
[time=373] [MUSIC - 262 seconds]
[time=641] - I wanted to take just a minute if I could
[time=649] and remind you of something that's coming up here at Blackhawk and even while reminding you of it, invite you to be a part of it.
[time=656] April 15th, normally a date and a time of year, we kind of reserved for taxes and stressful challenging times is going to be this year an absolute celebration around this place because April 15th is Easter.
[time=673] And we are so very excited to celebrate the fact that our Redeemer lives.
[time=678] And what I wanted to ask you was this, many of you I realize, watch the Bible hour and then enjoy and are a part of your own local church.
[time=687] And that's something that we here at Blackhawk are very, very thankful for.
[time=691] And our hope is that April 15th, your celebration of Easter with that family will be for you a sweet, sweet time.
[time=698] Many of you though, watch the Bible hour and you don't go anywhere.
[time=701] You just kind of have church at home, if you will.
[time=704] And I know that because I've met many of you and I hear from many of you and we're so glad that we're able to kind of come into your home and hopefully encourage you each and every week.
[time=714] Our hope is this, would you be willing?
[time=717] Would you be willing April 15th on Easter to come and join us just for a Sunday?
[time=722] We're gonna have services that morning at 830 and 1030.
[time=725] And as we meet as a family, we would love for you to come and be a part of that.
[time=730] I'd love to meet you, we'd love to know your name.
[time=733] We'd love to know that the Bible hour is something that ministers to you and that you enjoy.
[time=737] And so give it some thought, would you?
[time=739] April 15th, 830 or 1030, we'd love for you to be with us as we celebrate our risen Lord and the fact that he lives and because he lives, we have life and hope and a promise for the future.
[time=753] Come and join us, would you Easter?
[time=756] See you then.
[time=757] [MUSIC - 52 seconds]
[time=812] Sing it out now, bring us thy faithfulness.
[time=814] [MUSIC - 23 seconds]
[time=840] Sing it again.
[time=842] [MUSIC - 11 seconds]
[time=858] - You all got to be upset? - Amen.
[time=864] - We did it.
[time=867] I can't believe it, we did it.
[time=869] He said you couldn't put an airstrip on that incline.
[time=873] He said you couldn't clear trees of that size.
[time=876] Said no, a pine could safely land on it.
[time=879] They were wrong.
[time=884] Okay, Lord, I admit it.
[time=888] I was a little worried coming in there at first time.
[time=891] I almost pulled up for a second approach.
[time=894] Something inside told me you want to see an airstrip there, Lord.
[time=899] Something inside me said you wanted to see food and medicine get to those people.
[time=904] Something inside me said you wanted to see Bibles flown in and churches planted.
[time=910] So I had to try it.
[time=912] Well, should I say, we, we did it, Lord.
[time=919] You and I, well, I'd like to pray some more, Lord, but you know I'm me.
[time=928] Well, I'll talk to you later.
[time=931] Oh, and Lord, thanks for using a selfie-stubbin' part like me.
[time=940] Sand Betty.
[time=943] What in the world could that mean?
[time=945] He kept pointing at the trees.
[time=947] Trees aren't sand Betty.
[time=949] Trees are trees.
[time=952] How's Wheelo?
[time=954] That sounds nothing like sand Betty.
[time=957] It was the kind of tree it was pointing to.
[time=960] The kind of tree was the-- Wait a minute.
[time=964] What's that word for open spaces?
[time=966] Open spaces, open spaces.
[time=970] Sand Bodey.
[time=971] Well, that's it.
[time=973] If sand Bodey means open spaces on the ground, then sand Betty means open spaces in the sky.
[time=981] Maybe meant sky or heaven or something.
[time=988] I'm going to get an idea like heaven.
[time=992] Lord, I just don't understand what these people mean.
[time=997] Please, give me the patience to figure out this crazy language.
[time=1001] No.
[time=1006] I said 15, not 50.
[time=1009] I wish there'd been 50 there.
[time=1011] Oh, just the regulars.
[time=1013] Roberto, Raul, Simone, Hernando.
[time=1018] Yeah, he was there.
[time=1022] Well, it was good and bad at the same time.
[time=1025] Well, Hernando's little girl is still very sick, and you can tell he's distracted by it.
[time=1030] He asked me why God won't heal her.
[time=1034] Yeah.
[time=1035] So we talked about God's sovereignty for most of the meeting.
[time=1040] I hope it did some good.
[time=1042] Sometimes I don't think like I'm getting through to these people.
[time=1046] Yeah, but sometimes I think I expect too much.
[time=1052] I think because they're pastors, they've got to be perfect.
[time=1057] Right.
[time=1058] But we've got to remember, they're still just baby Christians.
[time=1061] I mean, a year ago, Raul was dealing cocaine for-- exactly.
[time=1068] We did have a fantastic prayer service, though.
[time=1071] Oh, if there's anything that encourages my heart, it's that.
[time=1076] I don't know, it's just so refreshing.
[time=1079] I think these guys don't know any correct prayer lingo.
[time=1082] They just let it rip.
[time=1085] I wish I prayed with a heart these guys have.
[time=1087] Well, thanks.
[time=1092] I'm glad you're there, too.
[time=1094] Hey, listen, it's 11.48 my time.
[time=1098] And I've got to hit the hay.
[time=1101] Yeah, I've got a 7.30 class in the morning.
[time=1106] Thanks.
[time=1107] Same here.
[time=1110] OK.
[time=1111] You too, good night.
[time=1116] And Lord, please be with Paul right now and keep him safe wherever he is.
[time=1122] Protect him from all of this.
[time=1125] Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
[time=1127] Well, I was getting a little worried.
[time=1128] You're almost a half hour late.
[time=1131] You know, I can't just call the cops here like I could at home.
[time=1134] I know, honey, I'm sorry I worried you.
[time=1137] I don't know anyone in this whole apartment complex, and I can't speak enough German to ask for help.
[time=1143] Honey, let's sit down here a minute.
[time=1145] I know it's scary for you to be here.
[time=1147] I'm scared, too.
[time=1148] Sometimes I wonder what I'm doing here.
[time=1150] I wonder, why did we leave everything we knew and loved to come to this?
[time=1154] Well, it is.
[time=1154] It's a god forsaken place.
[time=1156] Neither of us knows the language.
[time=1158] We're both homesick, and we're flat broke.
[time=1161] But tonight, honey, tonight, I realize what we're doing here.
[time=1164] You remember Eggar, the guy I met at the coffee house last night?
[time=1168] Yeah.
[time=1168] Well, he came back tonight, and he gave his life to Christ.
[time=1172] I mean, it was just like that.
[time=1173] Something like you'd read out of the book of Acts.
[time=1176] You know, it's like I feel like I'm in the book of Acts with Paul and Silas.
[time=1180] The forces of the outside world are so strong, but the power of God is even stronger.
[time=1186] It's not like that at home, though.
[time=1189] I know what you mean.
[time=1190] It's like everything is intensified here.
[time=1193] Exactly, I've never had to depend on God like this before.
[time=1197] But when I do, things happen.
[time=1200] As I talked with Eggar, it's like the Lord was just sitting right next to him.
[time=1204] Eggar didn't even have a chance.
[time=1206] He prayed the most heartfelt prayer I've ever heard.
[time=1209] I didn't even understand a word of it.
[time=1212] I don't know what's going to happen next, but I do know one thing.
[time=1215] This is where we're supposed to be.
[time=1219] I think so, too.
[time=1221] You know, I was praying when you came in.
[time=1224] I don't think it would have occurred to me to pray at home.
[time=1228] I would have worried.
[time=1229] I would have paced.
[time=1230] You would have called Janet.
[time=1232] I would have called Janet and probably never called on the Lord.
[time=1237] You're right.
[time=1238] This is where we're supposed to be.
[time=1240] Five people.
[time=1250] Five people just like you, not heroes of the faith, not without their struggles and doubts, but five people who wanted more out of life than Pew setting and clock punching.
[time=1263] Five people who are open to an invitation from God,
[time=1269] other than that, they're just like you.
[time=1271] And every year, hundreds of these people get too old or too weak or too exhausted to continue.
[time=1281] And they need someone to fill these shoes.
[time=1284] Think about it.
[time=1287] If the shoe fits, open your Bibles to Acts,
[time=1295] Acts chapter 13, verses 4 through 14.
[time=1305] The art of staying at it.
[time=1307] What have some great men said when it comes to the art of staying at it?
[time=1315] Well, William Feather said this.
[time=1317] Success seems to be largely a matter of hanging on.
[time=1321] After others have let go.
[time=1325] Hanging on.
[time=1326] After others have let go.
[time=1327] H.E. Jansen said, the man who wins-- the man who wins may have been counted out several times.
[time=1334] He just didn't hear the referee.
[time=1337] I like that.
[time=1338] He just stayed at it.
[time=1339] He just kept going.
[time=1341] Somebody said this.
[time=1342] It was an ancient philosopher named unknown in the confrontation.
[time=1346] In the confrontation between the stream and the rock, the stream always wins.
[time=1353] Always.
[time=1355] Not through strength, but by what?
[time=1357] Perseverance, it just keeps coming.
[time=1362] Some words from some great men.
[time=1367] But what has the greatest of them all said?
[time=1370] What do we find in the Word of God about staying at it?
[time=1373] Well, my mind and maybe yours initially goes to James.
[time=1377] James chapter 1, where it says, consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials, knowing this, that the testing of your faith produces endurance.
[time=1390] Consider it all joy, knowing this, that the testing of your faith produces endurance.
[time=1397] Endurance is the word in the Greek.
[time=1399] It's the word hupa-mino.
[time=1401] And the word endurance, whenever you see that word in the New Testament, what it does is it paints a picture of an umbrella, if you will.
[time=1409] Picture in your mind an umbrella.
[time=1411] And it's not an umbrella that's keeping you away from difficulty.
[time=1415] It's an umbrella under which difficulty rains down.
[time=1420] And hupa-mino is to stay under the umbrella of difficulty, to remain steadfast, to endure, to persevere.
[time=1430] And James says, consider it all joy because the testing of your faith produces endurance.
[time=1434] And let endurance, your willingness in mind, to sit tight, have its perfect result that you and I might be, it says perfect and complete, lacking in absolutely nothing.
[time=1445] That's where character gets shaped.
[time=1448] That's where integrity gets built.
[time=1449] That's where perspective is gained.
[time=1453] Hupa-mino.
[time=1454] Look at what the Apostle Paul, who we've been tracking in this story of the book of Acts.
[time=1459] Look what he says in 2 Corinthians chapter 4, turn there in your Bibles to 2 Corinthians 4.
[time=1463] What does Paul say?
[time=1466] What do we learn from him about this art of staying at it?
[time=1470] 2 Corinthians 4, we're going to pick it up in verse 7.
[time=1476] 2 Corinthians 4, verses 7 to 11, first of all, it says, but we have this treasure.
[time=1482] Paul is here talking about the power of God.
[time=1485] And he says, we have this treasure in earthen vessels.
[time=1488] But the surpassing greatness of the power may be of God and not from ourselves.
[time=1493] We, he says in verse 8, we are afflicted in every way, but not crushed.
[time=1498] Perplexed, but not despairing.
[time=1500] Persecuted, but not forsaken.
[time=1502] Struck down, but not destroyed.
[time=1505] Always carrying about in the body the dying of Jesus, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body.
[time=1516] Verse 11, for we who live are constantly being delivered over to death, for Jesus' sake, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh.
[time=1529] I love those verses back there.
[time=1531] Verse 8 and 9, it is so-- go back to 8 and 9.
[time=1534] It is so the opposite sometimes of how I live.
[time=1541] We are afflicted in every way, he says, and then we, you and I, so many times, feel like, and we're crushed as well.
[time=1548] And he says, no, no, no.
[time=1550] I love all the buts there.
[time=1551] It says, we are afflicted in every way, but not crushed.
[time=1554] Perplexed, but not despairing.
[time=1556] Persecuted, but not forsaken.
[time=1558] Struck down, but not destroyed.
[time=1559] Staying at it.
[time=1562] Skip down to verses 16 and 17.
[time=1565] In light of all of that, what does he say, therefore, verse 16, we do not lose heart, but though our outer man
[time=1573] is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day for momentary light affliction.
[time=1581] I love that phrase because it gives perspective to you and to me because so many times you think and so many times I think that what we're experiencing is just enormous.
[time=1591] It is just huge.
[time=1592] It is just out of this world.
[time=1593] It is just incomparable.
[time=1595] It is so bad, so hard, and so difficult.
[time=1598] And he says, in essence, in this one phrase, that all of it in comparison to where we're going, all of it in comparison to what we're going to see, all of it in comparison to what will one day experience with our God is but momentary light affliction.
[time=1617] It's easy stuff compared to where we're going.
[time=1620] For momentary light affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory, far beyond all comparison.
[time=1630] Now, in light of what you're going through today, in light of what this past week held for you, in light of how your marriage is today, in light of how your relationship with your mom and dad is today, in light of what's going on at work, in light of what's going on with friends.
[time=1649] How does all that make you feel today?
[time=1652] Right here, right now.
[time=1655] Feeling perplexed, afflicted, persecuted,
[time=1662] struck down.
[time=1665] God's word says again and again to you and to me, stay at it.
[time=1671] I love the phrase, do not lose heart.
[time=1677] It's appropriate, I think, that we look at the words of Paul here in 2 Corinthians because it's his stay at it.
[time=1686] It's his persevering mindset, his enduring spirit that we're going to consider this morning.
[time=1693] And we're not just going to look at it, but we're going to hopefully be encouraged by it.
[time=1698] We're not just going to read about it, but we're going to be reminded of what it looks like in action.
[time=1704] Two weeks ago, as we gathered together, we took a morning to kind of overview the three missionary journeys.
[time=1712] The three trips that Paul and his comrades took to see the gospel grow and the churches be planted.
[time=1720] And this morning, we're going to come back.
[time=1723] Somebody said to me after we got done with that Sunday.
[time=1728] If you were here, you know, we went from chapter 13 to 21 in kind of an overview of the three.
[time=1733] And I think this person, maybe, was one of a few that's kind of wondering when Acts is going to end.
[time=1738] And they came up to me and said, wow, I'm glad.
[time=1740] We're all the way to 21 now.
[time=1741] And I had to say, well, wait a minute, actually, that was just an overview.
[time=1743] We're going to come back.
[time=1745] So I don't know if that guy is still here.
[time=1747] He may not be, but we're back to 13 now, OK?
[time=1751] And there's a reason why, because I tried to give you an overview.
[time=1753] But folks, there is so much to learn.
[time=1755] And there is so much to see.
[time=1757] And there is so much to take note of as these faithful guys made their way across the vent known world in their sandals, preaching the word of God, ministering to people.
[time=1768] And so we're going to do our best to kind of just take each step with them and see what their experience was like, see what God was doing, kind of make our way back.
[time=1776] And we come back this morning to chapter 13.
[time=1779] And as we come to the beginning of this first journey, what we see, in essence, is high hopes, a good beginning.
[time=1788] And we're going to start there this morning, a good beginning.
[time=1792] We see high hopes.
[time=1793] We see smooth sailing out on the horizon.
[time=1797] We see great anticipation, a good beginning.
[time=1800] Look with me at chapter 13, verses 4 and 5.
[time=1804] Acts chapter 13, verses 4 and 5, a good beginning.
[time=1808] It says there in verse 4.
[time=1811] So being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia.
[time=1815] And from there they sailed to Cyprus.
[time=1818] And when they had reached Salamis, they began to proclaim the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews.
[time=1823] And also they had John as their helper.
[time=1827] A good beginning, promising stuff on the horizon.
[time=1831] Like many of us here in this room have experienced, these three were heading into what seemed like an absolute kick.
[time=1840] A sure thing.
[time=1842] I mean, their hopes were high.
[time=1843] The lights were green.
[time=1845] Everything pointed toward this is what they were supposed to be doing.
[time=1849] The gospel was continuing to fall upon ears that wanted to hear people in the churches that had already been established were coming to faith and growing in their relationship with Christ.
[time=1860] New churches, they just knew, were waiting to be planted.
[time=1865] And most importantly, look there in verse 4.
[time=1867] So being sent out by who?
[time=1870] Who?
[time=1871] The Spirit of God.
[time=1873] Most importantly, as they look on their new adventure, God was in it.
[time=1877] The Spirit of God had set them apart.
[time=1879] The Spirit of God had laid out the route.
[time=1881] The Spirit of God had sent them.
[time=1883] What could go wrong?
[time=1885] He had established and he had led them down this path.
[time=1887] And so they jump on the ship and they head for the island of Cyprus.
[time=1892] And there it just gets better, in a sense.
[time=1894] Because as you look at this island of Cyprus, and if you study this thing at all, you realize that what they were heading into is they jumped on their ship and sailed to Cyprus, was this basically Mediterranean paradise.
[time=1906] Cyprus was an island often called Macaria.
[time=1910] Macaria, which translated means the Happy Island, that it was known as, the Happy Island.
[time=1915] They called it the Happy Island because of its perfect.
[time=1919] Absolutely, books will tell you perfect climate and endless resources.
[time=1924] Cyprus was the Hawaii of the first century.
[time=1927] Not a bad place to start a ministry, huh?
[time=1930] So verse five off they go, proclaiming truth, ready to see people come to and follow Christ.
[time=1937] And as is the case, many, many, many times, in your life and mine, good beginnings turn into painful, confusing journeys.
[time=1951] A good beginning turns into trial that rears it's had.
[time=1956] Trial rears it's had verses six through 14.
[time=1960] Says and when they had gone through the whole island, as far as pathos, they found a certain magician, Jewish false prophet whose name was Bar-Jesus, who was with the pro council there, Sergius Paulus, the Roman official, a man of intelligence.
[time=1977] This man summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God, Sergius Paulus, the Roman guy there, the magistrate there.
[time=1985] Once they hear the word of God, and so he calls Barnabas and Saul.
[time=1990] So they can proclaim that to him.
[time=1991] But Elymas, verse eight.
[time=1994] But Elymas, the magician for thus his name is translated, was opposing them, seeking to turn the pro council away from the faith, but Saul, who was known as Paul, and that's where we see the name change.
[time=2005] It's not very dramatic, it's just right there, 13, verse nine.
[time=2008] But Saul, who was also known as Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fixed his gaze, it says, upon him.
[time=2016] And said, you, you who are full of all deceit and fraud,
[time=2023] you son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to make crooked the straight ways of the Lord?
[time=2031] And now behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind and not see the sun for a time.
[time=2038] And immediately, a mist and a darkness fell upon him, and he went about seeking those, who would lead him by the hand.
[time=2045] Then the pro council believed, when he saw what had happened being amazed at the teaching of the Lord.
[time=2053] Now Paul and his companions put out to see from Paphos, and came to Perga in Pamphylia, and John left them and returned to Jerusalem.
[time=2062] But going on from Perga, they arrived at Passidian, Antioch, and on the Sabbath day, they went into the synagogue and sat down.
[time=2069] Okay, watch this.
[time=2072] Good beginning turns into painful, confusing journey, trial rears that said, first observation, and this one's real slight, okay, and I'll admit that.
[time=2083] And I thought so slight, that I wasn't even gonna say anything to you about it.
[time=2087] 'Cause as I was reading through here, I just kind of noticed it.
[time=2091] Just kind of stood out to me, and I thought, ah, it doesn't really say anything about it, so I'll just let this one go.
[time=2096] Well then, as I looked through the commentators, and the things that they've written about this passage, you know, over the last couple hundred years, four, five, six of these guys all mentioned the same thing.
[time=2110] So I just thought I'd mention it to you.
[time=2111] It's not really, I mean, it's in the text, but it's just a kind of an implied thing, that I think you need to, and I need to think about it, consider when we look at what these guys faced.
[time=2121] Okay, now watch this.
[time=2122] Last part of verse five, they had reached Salamis, they began to proclaim the word of God in the synagogue to the Jews, and they also had John as their helper, and when verse six, and when they had gone through the whole island.
[time=2135] Okay, here's the thing I was thinking as I read that.
[time=2139] The thought that came to my mind is this, everywhere through this whole book so far, it seems.
[time=2144] I mean, I know there might be a few exceptions, but every single time, one of these guys proclaimed the word of God.
[time=2151] Every single time, one of these guys preached the good news.
[time=2154] Everywhere they went, when they opened their mouths, the people, what, responded.
[time=2160] And I'm reading through here, and they reached Salamis.
[time=2164] Okay, this is their missionary journey, folks.
[time=2166] Okay, I'm just trying to paint this picture there.
[time=2168] They're in the boat, they get there.
[time=2169] This is Paul, this is part of us.
[time=2172] They get there, they proclaim the good news.
[time=2175] They preach the word of God in the synagogue to the Jews, and then he says, and they also had John as their helper, and when they had gone through the whole island, now they've gone through the whole island, and we've not heard one story of anybody, what?
[time=2188] Sponding.
[time=2191] So I'm thinking, I won't say anything, but then I, again, look through all these commentaries, and they're all saying the same thing, and I think it's worth pointing out.
[time=2201] Now that six other commentators said it is, do you know how hard it is?
[time=2207] And I think you do.
[time=2209] And you may not understand it from my shoes, but you understand it from yours.
[time=2213] Do you know how difficult it is, don't you?
[time=2215] When no one responds to you?
[time=2218] You know what that's like, don't you?
[time=2223] Wives, you know what it's like when you want so desperately to talk about how you're going to deal with this issue with your son or daughter, and he's just not interested in talking, your husband that is.
[time=2239] And you say, will you talk with me about this?
[time=2241] And the answer is either a subtle or not so subtle, no.
[time=2245] At work, when you've worked so diligently on this project
[time=2252] or that project and you've made the presentation and the response is zero, nothing, you hear nothing back.
[time=2258] You know how that makes you feel.
[time=2263] And I can tell you from these shoes how it makes me feel, how it makes anybody feel when we give time and when we give energy and we give our days to planning a meeting or putting a training class together or even preparing a message.
[time=2278] And when there is no response to the effort and time that one has given it begins to just escalate feelings of insecurity, you feel alone?
[time=2289] You think, why am I doing this?
[time=2292] I shouldn't be doing this.
[time=2295] A very difficult thing to wrestle with, no response.
[time=2298] And seemingly as this thing gets going, there is none.
[time=2302] Now that's about to change, but I wanted to point that out to you because it's part of the picture, I think.
[time=2309] So first no response, then look at verses six to eight.
[time=2312] They found a certain magician.
[time=2314] They found a certain magician, a Jewish false prophet whose name was Bargeesus, who it says in verse seven was with the pro council there, a magistrate, Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence.
[time=2327] This man, Sergius Paulus, summons Barnabas and Saul and seeks to hear the word of God.
[time=2332] But Elimash, the magician, was opposing them, seeking to turn the pro council away from the faith.
[time=2340] They finally get someone, seemingly open.
[time=2343] They finally come upon someone who wants to respond and what do they bump into, but opposition from a false teaching demonic magician.
[time=2351] Second observation there for you, demonic attack, demonic opposition.
[time=2356] And here's how this would work in those days.
[time=2359] You see Roman rulers, no matter how intelligent they were and many of them were extremely intelligent, they were always incredibly superstitious.
[time=2370] And so Elimash was profiting from this arrangement he had with Sergius Paulus, which is why he was so threatened by Paul's presence and which is why he was so against Paul and Barnabas speaking the truth.
[time=2382] He had it made.
[time=2384] If Sergius Paulus came to Christ, if Sergius Paulus came to faith, it would mean the end of his fame, it would be the end of his prophet, it would be the end of his nice little relationship there with the lead guy.
[time=2396] So he aggressively opposes the missionaries message.
[time=2401] He aggressively opposes and it attempts to keep the truth at bay.
[time=2406] Let me say this one to you this way.
[time=2410] The enemy.
[time=2411] And maybe you've seen this firsthand, maybe you haven't.
[time=2417] And if you haven't, I don't know that I'd really wish it upon you, but the enemy, the real enemy, the enemy, Satan, the enemy at work, the enemy at work,
[time=2434] keeping the truth, attempting to keep the truth at bay is a very disheartening thing to see.
[time=2442] It is a very disheartening, very scary, can be a very, very discouraging experience.
[time=2450] And sometimes his work, the enemy's work, comes right up against ours, opposing the effort to see the gospel grow, to see truth be told.
[time=2461] I'll never forget as long as I live, ever.
[time=2465] And I can see it right now if I close my eyes as if it were just a few minutes ago.
[time=2470] 1986, there were 175 of us.
[time=2475] College students from the Masters College had volunteered to go on a missions trip to New York City.
[time=2482] And it was there in New York City that the 175 of us would chaperone and kind of oversee 600 or so 700 high school kids from all over the country who were coming to Manhattan Bible Church with its pastor Tom Meheris.
[time=2497] And Tom and his crew and us, well, we had kind of designed a whole week's worth of activity.
[time=2503] Sharing the gospel and doing different things with different churches in that area.
[time=2507] And it was an unbelievable time.
[time=2509] But we were there two weeks early to become familiar with the city.
[time=2513] Our job that week with the high school kids would entail subways and traveling.
[time=2517] And so we were there two weeks early to kind of get a feel for what was going on there in New York City specifically for us there in Manhattan.
[time=2525] And for two weeks, me and three buddies, every single day would sit and talk with a guy named Donald.
[time=2533] And we met Donald our very first day there.
[time=2537] Donald was a late 40s black man who would sit there at Columbus Circle.
[time=2543] And he was as homeless as it got.
[time=2548] He was as destitute as you could ever imagine.
[time=2552] And he sat on the same stool every single day.
[time=2557] And he slept two tears down on the 57th Street subway entrance, Northside.
[time=2563] Slept on that cement slab, huddled up in the corner there every single night.
[time=2568] His hair hadn't been touched probably in 10 years.
[time=2574] It was flattened, it was knotted, it was dirty, it was covered in what he slept in.
[time=2580] Oftentimes his own excrement.
[time=2582] He ate whatever he could get his hands on.
[time=2586] And whenever money he got he spent on wine and booze.
[time=2591] And he spent his life drunk on a stool in Columbus Circle.
[time=2596] And so there we would see him every day.
[time=2600] And every day we stopped and we would talk to Donald.
[time=2603] And you gotta realize who we were.
[time=2604] We were not from New York City.
[time=2606] We were Southern California boys, 20 years of age.
[time=2610] Out from under the cocoon of the Masters College for the first time in some respects.
[time=2615] Seeing things we didn't know existed.
[time=2617] And so there we sat with Donald each day and we'd sit and talk with him and he was somewhat coherent.
[time=2625] Not very.
[time=2626] And at the end of the day when we would come back through 57th Street and down to the subway, there he'd be and we'd sit and talk.
[time=2632] And just a weird kind of unique but very special heartfelt thing just got developed between the four of us, my three, four, five of us.
[time=2643] Well, we had a plan by day seven or eight.
[time=2645] We just thought, you know, we can't do, we gotta do something for this guy.
[time=2649] And so all we really had come up with was just an offer and we had gotten it okayed by the church.
[time=2654] We were just gonna bring him back with us.
[time=2657] No visions of grandeur.
[time=2658] We weren't gonna bring him back to the Masters College and have him room with us.
[time=2661] We were just gonna bring him back to the church and give him a shower and clean him up and give him some food.
[time=2669] Maybe have him spend the night on a bed and take him back.
[time=2673] And so we were so excited.
[time=2676] We were so thrilled.
[time=2677] We couldn't wait and we'd jump off the subway and we'd run up the steps and boom, there he is right there.
[time=2683] Columbus Circle on the stool, just half out of his mind.
[time=2687] And we'd walk up to him and we're hitting him and he's, by that time we had had FedEx the Masters College sweatshirt.
[time=2692] So he's wearing his Masters College sweatshirt now.
[time=2695] He's like the talk of all the guys there at Columbus Circle.
[time=2698] He's got his Masters College sweatshirt on.
[time=2700] And we said, hey Donald, we got a plan, man.
[time=2705] We wanna take you back with us and we're gonna get you all cleaned up and get you some coffee and a good meal and a place to sleep.
[time=2711] And man, he's gotta roll on his eyes and he can't believe what he's hearing.
[time=2716] And he's, you know, he's very lethargic and he's very bent over.
[time=2719] And I'm telling you that for a reason.
[time=2721] He's very lethargic and he's very bent over and he reaches down to grab his bottle.
[time=2725] And I don't know who it was.
[time=2728] It wasn't me, but one of the guys kind of comes along, comes over in front of him and says, yeah, we're gonna take you back to the church.
[time=2734] And the moment that my friend said the church,
[time=2741] Donald set up Iraq.
[time=2744] I mean, he was just, it's just straight up.
[time=2749] And he was no longer lethargic and he was no longer bent over.
[time=2753] And he looked up and his eyes were rolled.
[time=2755] And this is the truth.
[time=2756] His eyes were rolled all the way behind his head.
[time=2759] I was looking at nothing but whites.
[time=2760] And immediately there was the sense that this was not Donald.
[time=2765] And he turned on his stool like he had never turned in eight days.
[time=2772] I mean, he turned.
[time=2774] And it was as if he was addressing us, addressing us.
[time=2777] And he said to us in a different voice.
[time=2779] And I won't use it 'cause I don't wanna scare anybody, but it was a different voice.
[time=2785] And it kind of looked us right in the face and said, no, not there.
[time=2789] And it was as real as this right here.
[time=2795] No, not there.
[time=2797] I turn around and I'm alone.
[time=2800] I got three guys running through Central Park.
[time=2802] (audience laughs) I mean, they're just jetting down the walkway.
[time=2806] And I just, I didn't know what to do.
[time=2809] And then the eyes kind of came back around and he kind of limped over and it was like he was asleep.
[time=2813] So I find my buddies.
[time=2816] And we go running back and we're all shook up.
[time=2820] We tell all the guys that, you know, the leaders of the trip.
[time=2823] And remember talking to Pastor Maharis about it that night.
[time=2827] And he said, yeah, it's all over the place.
[time=2829] Demonic oppression.
[time=2831] It's everywhere.
[time=2833] And here's what I didn't get.
[time=2837] You know, and I might be skewed in my thinking.
[time=2839] And I don't mean this in a negative way toward Donald.
[time=2841] Please hear me.
[time=2842] But in my mind, I'm thinking, you know what?
[time=2845] Enemy, he's just a bum.
[time=2848] Well, it's like don't you have like a billion other people in the world to deal with and go and try and seduce into your life.
[time=2855] This guy alone, he's just a guy that sits on a stool and sleeps in a subway.
[time=2862] But you're not gonna let him come to a church and get a bath.
[time=2866] And it's as if the enemy says, no, it's exactly right.
[time=2871] I will keep whoever I can.
[time=2873] Whatever opportunities I get from the truth.
[time=2877] And it was scary.
[time=2880] It was absolutely scary in mind-boggling and eye-opening.
[time=2884] Now Paul, he steps up a little bit more dramatically than me and my three scared friends did, okay?
[time=2890] Look at verse nine.
[time=2891] But Saul, who was also known as Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fixed his gaze upon him and said, you who are full of all deceit and fraud, you son of the devil, you enemy of all unrighteousness.
[time=2902] Will you not cease to make crooked the straight ways of the Lord?
[time=2907] I love that.
[time=2909] And now behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you and you will be blind and not see the sun for a time.
[time=2916] And immediately a mist and a darkness fell upon him and he went about seeking those who would lead him by the hand and I love verse 12, then the pro counsel believed.
[time=2924] Then he believed.
[time=2926] The miracle, the miracle I think had impressed him but the gospel, the truth amazed him.
[time=2932] We see no response, we see demonic opposition.
[time=2937] Third observation, look at verse 13.
[time=2939] Now Paul, now Paul and his companions put out to see from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia.
[time=2947] Stop right there.
[time=2948] Pamphylia was a treacherous place.
[time=2952] The coastal area around Perga was rife with disease including malaria.
[time=2956] It is here that Paul suffered an ailment he later referred to in his second letter to Corinth as his thorn in the flesh.
[time=2964] The sickness as the story unfolds here seemingly had kind of forced him inland to a cooler climate in a place called Galatia.
[time=2974] You wanna write Galatians 413 down, you can.
[time=2976] Read Galatians 413.
[time=2978] When you get a chance there it talks about how at this time he was forced to come in to see them because of this illness.
[time=2985] Barkley defines Paul's illness as malaria.
[time=2988] Now listen to this.
[time=2989] The oldest tradition is that Paul suffered from prostrating headaches and the most likely explanation is that he was the victim of a virulent recurring malaria fever which haunted the low coastal strip of Asia Minor which is where he was.
[time=3007] Medical experts say that the headache that came with this form of malaria was like a red hot bar thrust through one's forehead.
[time=3017] In the vernacular of our day he was suffering from what?
[time=3022] My grains.
[time=3024] Okay, don't dismiss that too quick, all right?
[time=3029] I've not had one.
[time=3030] Who's had one?
[time=3031] Can you go ask a hand?
[time=3034] You see the hands?
[time=3036] You go ask the hand.
[time=3037] Any hand you see raised in here this morning?
[time=3040] What's a migraine like?
[time=3041] You're gonna go on a missionary journey with a migraine?
[time=3046] You're gonna proclaim the word of God with a migraine?
[time=3048] You're gonna get on your sandals and walk to Perga with a migraine?
[time=3052] You're gonna do three missionary journeys with regular migraines.
[time=3057] Anybody who's had a migraine, this just got a whole lot more real to you.
[time=3064] And Paul and his stay at it, mindset, just became a whole lot more.
[time=3070] Encouraging, convicting, either way.
[time=3073] So now he's got migraines.
[time=3076] Now he's sick.
[time=3077] Thousands of miles still to go and one more painful surprise.
[time=3082] One more painful surprise.
[time=3085] Look at the end of verse 13.
[time=3087] We already read it once.
[time=3088] Says it right there.
[time=3090] And John left them and returned to Jerusalem.
[time=3095] Fourth observation there, John Mark leaves.
[time=3097] Paul doesn't say, excuse me, Luke doesn't say much about it.
[time=3104] Okay, this John Mark leaving.
[time=3107] Not a lot of explanation, but think about it folks.
[time=3109] Just look back where we've been in the last couple of verses.
[time=3111] I might wanna leave too.
[time=3113] Maybe you might be thinking the same thing.
[time=3116] First, there's no response on Salamis, demonic opposition in Paphos.
[time=3121] Now physical danger and disease and all of it sends John Mark scurrying back to the safety of home.
[time=3126] How's Paul feeling?
[time=3128] How's Paul feeling right about now?
[time=3130] I'll tell you how he's feeling.
[time=3131] Look at Acts chapter 15.
[time=3132] Skip over just a couple of pages to Acts 15, verse 36.
[time=3137] Tell you exactly how he's feeling.
[time=3145] Acts 15, 36 to 39.
[time=3149] We touched on this last time.
[time=3152] Here it is again.
[time=3153] And after some days, Paul said to Barnabas, let us return and visit the brethren in every city in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord.
[time=3160] This would be the beginning now of the second missionary journey.
[time=3163] And see how they are.
[time=3164] And Barnabas verse 37 was desirous of taking John called Mark along with them also.
[time=3170] But Paul kept insisting that they should not take him along who had deserted them is the word used.
[time=3178] Who had deserted them in Pamphilia and had not gone, here's Paul's personality coming out, who had not gone with them to the work.
[time=3187] There was work to be done.
[time=3190] There was a message to be proclaimed.
[time=3192] There was an endeavor to give oneself to.
[time=3194] And this kid had scurried home to mama.
[time=3197] And Paul said, no, he word used deserted us.
[time=3204] Have you ever been deserted?
[time=3209] Do you know what it feels?
[time=3212] Do you know what it feels like to be deserted?
[time=3214] Do you know what it's like to be abandoned?
[time=3217] Ever been hung out to dry, ever been cheated on?
[time=3220] Ever had the situation where you said, you know, you told me you were in this.
[time=3224] You said you were in for the long haul and now you're leaving, what's going on?
[time=3228] Many of you in this room know what it's like to feel the very thing Paul felt.
[time=3235] As he felt that sense of desertion, how would you like to feel cheated on, deserted?
[time=3243] Along with no response, demonic opposition, migraines, physical disease.
[time=3248] And that's how this thing, that's how a good beginning kind of turned into a painful, confusing journey.
[time=3255] Now here's the point of the whole morning.
[time=3258] Wish we had another half hour.
[time=3259] We've just got a couple of minutes, so here you go.
[time=3262] Verse 14, back to Acts 13.
[time=3266] There's the whole deal folks, right here, in just a few words, it's the whole point of the message, it's the whole point of the morning.
[time=3274] Here's your truth to take home.
[time=3276] Acts chapter 13, verse 14, in light of all that we've just said, in light of all that this guy faced, in light of all that he was experiencing, spiritually and physically and relationally.
[time=3286] Here you go, verse 14, but going on.
[time=3293] Did you see it?
[time=3294] But going on from Perga.
[time=3297] They arrived at Poseidon Antioch, and we'll get to that later.
[time=3303] But going on.
[time=3306] Underlining, circling, making note of it.
[time=3312] Write those words down.
[time=3314] I wrote them down a couple of weeks ago, and I'm gonna keep writing them down.
[time=3317] But going on, and that's your truth to take home.
[time=3321] Write this one down too.
[time=3323] Oftentimes, just one thing and we're gone.
[time=3326] Oftentimes, people, God calls us to suck it up and persevere.
[time=3330] And so many times in the church, we talk about the other side of that coin.
[time=3335] So many times in the church, we talk about, and now hear me, we talk about it, and legitimately so, because it's a real thing.
[time=3343] I just think sometimes we spend too much time on that side of the coin, because granted, there is a side of the coin where you and I need to be encouraged.
[time=3352] Granted, there is a side of the coin where you and I need counsel, and we need help, and we need sympathy.
[time=3358] We need the empathy of those who love and live life with us.
[time=3360] Granted, that is true, but so many times that side of the coin dominates, and we forget that sometimes his being there for us takes the shape of him being willing to give you and give me the strength and the courage needed to suck it up and endure and persevere.
[time=3380] And verse 14, go on each day facing all that life brings, facing all that it has brought your way, facing all the disappointment and discouragement and frustration and confusion, getting up and going on with his help, with his guidance, just like Paul did, with his help, with his guidance, but he got up, he got up people, and he went on, right down Hebrews 1035 to 39.
[time=3410] Hebrews 1035 to 39, please write it down,
[time=3416] and tonight before your head hits the pillow, tonight before you go to bed, individually, maybe even as a family, read that passage and remind each other what it looks like for you, personally, to not be of those who would shrink back to destruction, and that'll make more sense to you as you read that passage.
[time=3438] Hebrews 1035 to 39, let's stay at it, what do you say?
[time=3443] Let's pray, stand on up.
[time=3446] Father, as we stand, we lift our hearts to you and we lift to you, God, this morning, the reality of our lives.
[time=3453] We face so many things that at times are so very confusing, and God, as we watch this man and those that traveled with him, namely Barnabas, as we watch them stay at it, as we watch them face all kinds of opposition in discouraging circumstances, and yet, God, their eyes and their hearts stayed fixed on that which you had called them to.
[time=3474] And so, God, give us that same kind of courage as we read Hebrews 1035 to 39 tonight with our kids, with our friends, with our spouses, or even just on our own, God, give us that kind of mindset that doesn't shrink back, because we know in shrinking back there is, as the writer of Hebrews said, destruction, destruction.
[time=3496] There's a dangerous place to be.
[time=3498] God, keep our hearts and our spirits strong in your son's name, we pray, amen.
