[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=10] Welcome to the Sunday Morning Worship Service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=14] Thank you for joining us.
[time=15] We trust that the music and message from God's word will help you in your Christian walk.
[time=20] Now let's join our service.
[time=22] Surely God is my salvation.
[time=24] I will trust and not be afraid.
[time=27] The Lord, the Lord is my strength and my song.
[time=31] He has become my salvation.
[time=33] Sing to the Lord, for he has done glorious things.
[time=36] Shout aloud and sing for joy.
[time=38] For great is the Holy One of Israel among you.
[time=42] If you were granted one wish in this life, what would it be?
[time=46] You mean if I could have anything I wanted?
[time=48] Yes, anything.
[time=49] Oh, that's easy. I'd like a million dollars.
[time=52] No, make that a billion dollars.
[time=55] Oh, okay. It's yours.
[time=57] Wow, thanks.
[time=59] No, tell me.
[time=60] Why do you want a billion dollars?
[time=63] Are you kidding?
[time=64] No, I'd really like to know.
[time=66] Well, because it would make me very happy to be rich.
[time=70] For how long?
[time=71] How long?
[time=72] Well, I'd like to be rich forever.
[time=74] No, no, no. How long would you be happy?
[time=77] I don't know.
[time=78] Well, as long as I was rich, I suppose.
[time=80] Are you sure?
[time=82] Well, I think I'd be happy.
[time=84] I certainly hope so anyway.
[time=87] I doubt it.
[time=88] Money isn't everything you know.
[time=90] Personally, I'd ask for something a little more concrete.
[time=94] Concrete?
[time=96] Yes.
[time=97] I want to be famous.
[time=100] When I go out, I want people from all over the world to say, "Look, there goes Linda Layman." [laughter] She's a very important, famous person.
[time=116] [laughter] Why?
[time=121] Why what?
[time=122] Why do you want to be famous?
[time=124] Because I've always admired famous people.
[time=129] And do you think being famous would make you happy?
[time=132] Certainly.
[time=134] Just think of the publicity.
[time=136] Throngs of people waving at me, cheering me, picking pictures, asking for autographs, pushing, screaming, shoving, grabbing, tearing up my clothes.
[time=149] Oh, my.
[time=153] That sounds like a wonderful life.
[time=158] I'll tell you what.
[time=159] You keep the fame.
[time=162] I'll go for the power.
[time=164] Power?
[time=167] Absolutely.
[time=170] Why just think of all the good a person could do with absolute power?
[time=175] Total, unlimited, complete.
[time=178] Why with absolute power, I could be-- Corrupted, absolutely.
[time=184] Oh, I suppose that is possible, isn't it?
[time=190] Absolutely.
[time=195] What about you, Laura? You've been awfully quiet.
[time=198] I've been thinking, don't you feel that deep inside, all of us really want the same thing?
[time=205] Something that will give great pleasure.
[time=207] To be highly pleased.
[time=209] Happiness.
[time=210] Delight.
[time=211] Joy.
[time=212] I don't care all that much about power, wealth, or fame.
[time=215] I just want to be happy.
[time=216] And usually I am.
[time=218] But lately, I've been having trouble hanging on to my joy.
[time=223] No matter what I do, sooner or later, it goes away.
[time=227] Even in laughter, the heart may age.
[time=229] And joy may end in grief.
[time=231] The birth of the wicked is brief.
[time=233] The joy of a godless lasts but a moment.
[time=236] What I want is something that will last.
[time=239] Have I got good news for you?
[time=242] Jesus said I have come that you may have life and have it to the full.
[time=247] I tell you the truth.
[time=248] Whoever hears my words and believes in him who set me has eternal life.
[time=253] Salvation is permanent.
[time=255] Because it comes from the eternal God.
[time=258] Through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[time=261] A free gift wrapped up in joy.
[time=264] I delight greatly in the Lord.
[time=266] My soul rejoices in my God.
[time=269] For he has clothed me with garments of salvation.
[time=272] And a raid me in a robe of righteousness.
[time=275] Now, just go on there, one minute.
[time=278] You're saying that joy comes with salvation?
[time=280] Well, I've been a Christian all my life and I don't feel very joyful.
[time=285] I can sure testify to that.
[time=288] Now, what's that supposed to mean?
[time=290] Oh, nothing.
[time=291] I was just thinking about that little incident that happened yesterday.
[time=296] Oh, you don't need to go into that.
[time=298] No, it was like we was late for Sunday school.
[time=301] And you'd speeden on your way to church and this nice policeman stopped us.
[time=306] And your face was getting all red and splotchy like.
[time=308] And the kids kept asking, "Why, Daddy?" "Just because you couldn't find your driver's license." And then when we got to church, the Sunday school superintendent stopped you and said, "Would you mind leading the children in?
[time=320] I've got the Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey down in my heart." I thought you knew it was going to have a heart attack.
[time=327] Yeah, I remember. I guess I sort of lost my temper in my joy.
[time=332] You don't think that means I lost my salvation, do you?
[time=336] No.
[time=337] Salvation is not a feeling.
[time=339] It's a fact.
[time=340] Do not be afraid or terrified.
[time=342] For the Lord your God goes with you.
[time=345] He will never leave you nor forsake you.
[time=347] Joy is a byproduct of salvation.
[time=351] But it is possible to have one without the other.
[time=355] To have salvation is to have access to the fountain of joy.
[time=359] But it is up to us to keep on drawing from the well.
[time=363] And to keep the dust out of the water.
[time=367] Dust?
[time=368] Yes, those things in life that muddy up the flow.
[time=372] Pain.
[time=373] Poverty.
[time=374] Persecution.
[time=375] Trials.
[time=376] Tribulation.
[time=377] Stress.
[time=378] I know that all these things can take away my joy.
[time=384] And I try.
[time=387] I really try to keep them from getting me down.
[time=394] But sometimes, in spite of everything I do, I end up in a full-scale depression.
[time=404] Then what do you do?
[time=407] I don't know.
[time=408] I wait for it to go away, I guess.
[time=411] Is that all?
[time=413] Usually.
[time=415] There is something else you could do.
[time=417] Immerse yourself in the living water of God's Word.
[time=420] Cling to His promises.
[time=422] Do not grieve for the joy of the Lord as your strength.
[time=425] Weeping may remain for a night, but rejoicing comes in the morning.
[time=430] Spiritual joy is not dependent upon the circumstances of life.
[time=433] It goes beyond this world.
[time=435] Reaching into the very essence of God.
[time=438] When problems arise, don't yield to them.
[time=441] Instead, claim the joy that is freely bestowed.
[time=445] By the Holy Spirit.
[time=447] Through Christ Jesus.
[time=449] How do I do that?
[time=451] By doing the will of God.
[time=454] And how can I find out what that is?
[time=456] Read.
[time=457] Pray.
[time=458] Fast.
[time=459] Fellowship.
[time=460] Worship.
[time=461] When we really want to know God's will, the intensity of our desire results in obedience.
[time=467] Obedience brings us into harmony with God's will.
[time=470] And harmony with God produces the spiritual fruit of joy in our lives.
[time=477] That sounds rather good I must say, but I'm not sure it always works that way.
[time=482] Take yesterday, for instance.
[time=484] There's this fellow I work with that really needs the Lord.
[time=488] His marriage is falling apart, and he's so mixed up.
[time=492] He doesn't know what to do.
[time=494] So I felt led to share my faith with him.
[time=497] Do you know what he said?
[time=499] He thanked me in no uncertain terms, and let me know in no way in certain terms.
[time=505] I might add it.
[time=506] He wasn't in a market for any Christian crutches.
[time=511] Can you believe that?
[time=513] So, are you saying that his rejection made you lose your joy?
[time=517] Yes.
[time=519] I suppose that is correct.
[time=522] Why?
[time=523] Weren't you doing God's will when you talk to him?
[time=525] Of course I was, but my friend certainly wasn't.
[time=529] How can I be joyful when he rejects God?
[time=533] You've got to keep dusting.
[time=537] I'm afraid I don't understand.
[time=539] You know like Paul and Barnabas.
[time=543] Now those apostles knew how to dust.
[time=546] Remember the time when they were rejected and thrown out of the city for preaching the gospel?
[time=551] Instead of bemoaning their faith, Paul and Barnabas simply shook the dust from their feet.
[time=556] And went on.
[time=557] And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.
[time=561] It's easy to be happy when things are going right.
[time=563] But it takes the Holy Spirit to fill us with joy when everything seems to be going wrong.
[time=568] Knowing that God is in control.
[time=571] Of the situation.
[time=572] Of others.
[time=573] Of me.
[time=574] Is simply a matter of faith.
[time=576] We need to continually leave the results of our obedience in God's hands.
[time=580] Believing.
[time=581] Hoping.
[time=582] Enduring.
[time=583] When we allow the Holy Spirit to carry our burdens for us.
[time=587] The result is joy.
[time=589] Jesus said.
[time=590] If you obey my commands, you will remain in my love.
[time=595] I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete.
[time=601] Lord, teach me how to shake off the dust of this world.
[time=607] Fill me with your power.
[time=610] Restore to me the joy of your salvation.
[time=613] And grant me a willing spirit to sustain me.
[time=616] Through love.
[time=617] Through obedience.
[time=619] And with joy.
[time=621] Praise his holy name.
[time=629] I wanted to take just a minute if I could and remind you of something that's coming up here at Blackhawk and even while reminding you of it, invite you to be a part of it.
[time=638] April 15th.
[time=639] Normally a date and a time of year we kind of reserved for taxes and stressful challenging
[time=647] times is going to be this year an absolute celebration around this place.
[time=652] Because April 15th is Easter.
[time=654] And we are so very excited to celebrate the fact that our Redeemer lives.
[time=659] And what I wanted to ask you was this, many of you I realize.
[time=663] Watch the Bible Hour and then enjoy and are a part of your own local church.
[time=668] And that's something that we here at Blackhawk are very, very thankful for.
[time=672] And our hope is that April 15th, your celebration of Easter with that family will be for you a sweet, sweet time.
[time=679] Many of you, though, watch the Bible Hour and you don't go anywhere.
[time=682] You just kind of have church at home, if you will.
[time=685] And I know that because I've met many of you and I hear from many of you.
[time=689] And we're so glad that we're able to kind of come into your home and hopefully encourage you each and every week.
[time=695] Our hope is this, would you be willing?
[time=697] Would you be willing April 15th on Easter to come and join us just for a Sunday?
[time=702] We're going to have services that morning at 830 and 1030.
[time=706] And as we meet as a family, we would love for you to come and be a part of that.
[time=711] I'd love to meet you.
[time=712] We'd love to know your name.
[time=713] We'd love to know that the Bible Hour is something that ministers to you and that you enjoy.
[time=718] And so give it some thought.
[time=720] Would you April 15th, 830 or 1030?
[time=723] We'd love for you to be with us as we celebrate our risen Lord and the fact that He lives.
[time=729] And because He lives, we have life and hope and a promise for the future.
[time=734] Come and join us.
[time=736] Would you Easter?
[time=737] See you then.
[time=738] [MUSIC - 185 seconds]
[time=928] - Mom stands for mothers of preschoolers.
[time=931] That includes any mom from the time she's pregnant with her first child until her last child enters first grade.
[time=939] And Mom's is just created to meet the needs of women in that stage of life.
[time=946] It's just a really fun time for the moms to get together with your friends or build their older friendships up and just to have a time of fellowship and fun.
[time=957] - I came at first because they asked me and I had no idea what it was, but then there's that whole thing about having someone watch your kid for two hours and you get good food to boot.
[time=965] And then first week after I came, I thought, "I don't know about the whole mop thing," 'cause it sort of seems like a bunch of women that are getting together that all can't do their laundry and take care of their kids.
[time=975] But then after the second week, 'cause I kind of got into it, it's nice 'cause you go with other women that are in the exact same position you are, but they appear to be together.
[time=983] You see these women that look like, you know, this is a great gal and she's in the same boat I am.
[time=987] You know, she can't get her laundry done, she can't take care of her kid.
[time=991] And you know, so it helps to know that maybe you're not doing as bad as you think you are most days.
[time=994] - I'm a co-moffits coordinator with Sherry Mrezi and we take care of all the kids that come and get them in their classrooms and make up a curriculum for them to study and make sure that they're well cared for and well staffed.
[time=1005] Right now we have about 60 kids total and they're divided up into five different rooms.
[time=1009] We have about 12 roughly in each classroom and we could use several more ladies.
[time=1015] We have a good group of committed women that come in every time, but there's always room for more.
[time=1021] - You get a chance to meet people that you would, I mean, we've met girls from other churches, which I hadn't had a chance to do before, 'cause I get kind of caught in my little Blackhawk world, helps me branch out of that.
[time=1031] And also it's nice to have a chance to talk to some people from a whole different background, different part of the country, and people handle everything from cooking, how they do their laundry to how they discipline their kids different.
[time=1040] - When I found out that we were doing a mops segment in our heartbeat video series, I want you to know that I asked if it would be okay.
[time=1048] If I just said a few things, and the reason I wanted to say something was really because of my mom and the memories that I have of growing up, even just as a young boy with her.
[time=1063] And my memories of my mom, when I think back to those days, are great, great memories of her and I playing together, her and I reading together, me asking questions, her giving me answers, her teaching me Bible stories, her praying with me.
[time=1081] As I look back on those days, it was full of times where she was making an investment in my life.
[time=1089] My little young life, my impressionable mind and heart was even as a two-year-old, three-year-old, being impacted by her great love for me and her great love for our God.
[time=1103] And so when I think about the difference that made in my life, and I realize that today, right here at Blackhawk, under Becky's leadership and with this new mops ministry, we've got ladies who are gathering to try and learn more and understand better what it means to really love and care for and invest in their kids.
[time=1121] It just thrills my soul.
[time=1123] And I am so thankful for those ladies, and so thankful for all who come, and my hope, and I know our hope here at Blackhawk, is that mothers of preschoolers will continue to know what it means to love their God and love their kids in meaningful, purposeful ways.
[time=1140] We go through different stages of life, and while we're in the preschooler stage of life, a lot of times it involves moms being at home a lot, not being able to get out and visit with other moms or having their specific needs met.
[time=1153] And so mops is designed to meet the needs and nurture moms of preschoolers.
[time=1160] Well, let me ask if you would to open your Bibles to Acts,
[time=1166] chapter 13.
[time=1168] Acts, chapter 13, this morning, verses 14 through 52.
[time=1173] Where are we in our study of the book of Acts?
[time=1175] Let's just catch up briefly if we can.
[time=1178] Chapter 13 so far has shown us some important things and some stuff to take note of this morning.
[time=1185] Before we continue on, Paul has the Apostle Paul here on this first missionary journey has contracted malaria, is what the experts and the historians pretty much deduce.
[time=1196] He's contracted malaria and with that comes the migraine headaches.
[time=1200] It is the thorn in the flesh that he speaks about in his letter to the Corinthians.
[time=1205] John Mark, the third individual in this group of three, Paul Barnabas and John Mark, has decided to go home.
[time=1213] Things got a bit too tough, things got a bit too difficult, maybe a little scary.
[time=1217] And so John Mark's home in Jerusalem, Elimas.
[time=1221] We bumped into Elimas the first part of chapter 13 and empowered magician, demonically empowered, it would seem.
[time=1228] He tried to there in our last time together, tried to kind of put a stop to the gospel,
[time=1234] tried to kind of keep the gospel at bay, and yet in the midst of facing all of that, physical sickness, desertion, Elimas and the demonic influence.
[time=1243] In the midst of all of that, we saw that Paul has not lost heart.
[time=1248] Paul does not lose heart.
[time=1251] And we see that may be best depicted in what it said there in chapter 13, verse 14.
[time=1258] Chapter 13, verse 14, having faced, seen and gone through all of that, what did it say there?
[time=1264] But going on from Perga.
[time=1268] But going on, he hits this buzz saw of challenge and trial, and it says going on from Perga.
[time=1276] And as we said last time in the vernacular of our day, what that in essence means is he got out of bed.
[time=1283] He got out of bed.
[time=1285] And I don't know if getting out of beds is hard for you as it is for me sometimes.
[time=1290] Is there ever hard for you?
[time=1292] It's hard for me sometimes to get out of bed.
[time=1295] A lot of days it's fun, enjoyable.
[time=1298] Some days it's really difficult to get both feet on the carpet.
[time=1302] Because some days life brings with it all kinds of challenges and all kinds of difficulties, and sometimes they're extremely painful and very confusing.
[time=1311] And for Paul it probably wasn't fun to get out of bed that next day.
[time=1316] For Paul it probably didn't feel good.
[time=1318] He was most assuredly lonely and tired, but on he went, and we talked about that last week, the art of staying at it.
[time=1326] And in this chapter, in this passage, he moves on to a place called Passidian Antioch.
[time=1331] And it is here in Passidian Antioch that we are about to witness these two guys.
[time=1336] Paul and Barnabas engaging in the single greatest endeavor of all time.
[time=1341] The single greatest endeavor of all time, past, present and future.
[time=1344] They are about to give themselves to the process of helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=1350] These guys are about to give themselves wholeheartedly to the greatest endeavor of all.
[time=1355] They're about to bring truth to a confused and dying people.
[time=1358] They're about to offer eternal food to hungry and thirsty souls.
[time=1363] To hungry and thirsty souls that are confused and needing answers.
[time=1369] Anybody here this morning, you don't have to raise your hand, you don't have to nod.
[time=1373] Just a question. Anybody here this morning?
[time=1376] Maybe you'd consider the state of your heart and your soul this morning as thirsty.
[time=1381] Maybe this morning you would consider the state of your heart and your soul as hungry.
[time=1386] Desperately, down deep in your heart looking for answers to questions that have maybe even for years confused you.
[time=1395] Maybe you find yourself here this morning and the purpose of life and the meaning of life.
[time=1401] It's something that you have tried to wrestle with and figure out for weeks and months and years.
[time=1407] Maybe you're here this morning needing ultimate peace.
[time=1410] Maybe you're here this morning looking for perfect direction.
[time=1413] My bet is that there are some here, but there are some here who would fit that description.
[time=1418] You may be rich and lonely, you may be poor and lonely.
[time=1422] You may be married with a great job, 2.3 kids, a white picket fence, two cars, a dog, a goldfish
[time=1428] and 15 years of marriage under your belt and even you.
[time=1432] Even you are longing and looking and searching for something to bring meaning to life.
[time=1440] The inside jacket cover of one of my favorite CDs says it well.
[time=1444] It's by a guy named Stephen Curtis Chapman and he penned these words.
[time=1448] It says from the front page, see if you agree, it says from the front page of the newspaper to the deep hidden corners of the human heart a cry is going up.
[time=1457] It's the searching longing cry of a culture and in fact a world in crisis.
[time=1463] Where is the hope they cry?
[time=1466] Where is the peace? Where is the purpose and meaning for life here in the real world?
[time=1472] Well the answer lies beyond the reaches of governmental policies and great humanitarian efforts
[time=1478] as needed and as good as these may be.
[time=1481] Purpose? Peace? Hope?
[time=1486] They're found in a lonely manger, in a lonely manger in a cruel cross and an empty tomb
[time=1492] for it is here that we see the kingdom of heaven bursting onto the scene of what has often been called the real world.
[time=1499] Charles Colson calls it a shining kingdom that reaches into the darkest corners of every mind,
[time=1505] a kingdom of deathless hope, a kingdom of restless virtue, a kingdom of endless peace.
[time=1512] Oh God, he has heard our cry and he has heard our cry and he heard the cry,
[time=1519] the longing cry of those at Antioch and he sends them Paul and Barnabas.
[time=1524] And what Paul and Barnabas do, the way in which they bring the truth to these people, the way in which they carry themselves, the way in which they proclaim truth, the manner in which they say it, the way in which they say it, what they say, all of it is an absolute study for us this morning and a study that deserves I think a close and careful look.
[time=1544] By the spirit of God we see here in verses 14 to 52 that they are number one in the way they bring the gospel, they are strategic.
[time=1553] Strategic, write it down. Number one, they are strategic.
[time=1556] Secondly, we'll see that not only are they strategic with the gospel, they are sensitive in how they deliver it.
[time=1563] They are strategic, they are sensitive and thirdly we'll see that they are straightforward and sound, straightforward and sound in what they communicate.
[time=1573] Strategic, sensitive, straightforward and sound.
[time=1577] Number one, strategic. Look with me at chapter 13 verse 14.
[time=1582] It says there but going on from Perga, they arrived at Poseidon Antioch
[time=1588] and on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down, stop right there.
[time=1593] Now you wouldn't know this about Poseidon Antioch unless you studied it, you'd find out that this was a strategic move.
[time=1601] And again led by God, this wasn't all of them, they're working in conjunction with him, he's leading their following, he's moving their thinking.
[time=1609] Poseidon Antioch is a very strategic move.
[time=1613] And if you studied it, here's what you'd find and I found this in Unger's Bible dictionary.
[time=1617] It says there and I quote, "Paul and Barnabas were planning the gospel and what was the communication hub of all Asia Minor." It was in Poseidon Antioch but the main east, west traffic artery ran through.
[time=1632] To the west it connected with the Greeks and the Aegean Sea.
[time=1636] To the east it brought access to Lystra, Iconium and Derby eventually leading on to Tarsus and Antioch.
[time=1643] I mean this place, Poseidon Antioch was the hub of all communication and traveling.
[time=1649] They had it figured out, they were all over it, they knew and God knew that if those from Poseidon Antioch or even those traveling through Poseidon Antioch came to faith in Christ that because of the nature of that city, because of what took place in that city, because of what came through that city, if that city came to know Christ, if there were folks in that place who embraced the gospel, the gospel then would by virtue of what took place in that city spread to the entire continent.
[time=1679] And so to Poseidon Antioch they went.
[time=1682] Strategic, strategic evangelism, you could call it.
[time=1687] Strategic evangelism, now stop for a moment.
[time=1691] Stop just for a moment and think with me, okay, think about you.
[time=1695] Think about your life. Think about the day to day.
[time=1698] Think about all that you do, the places that you go, the things that we give ourselves to.
[time=1703] Think about how strategic you and I are in so many ways, in so many situations.
[time=1709] Be honest.
[time=1711] In what parts of life do we actually go to great lengths in order to accomplish our goals and exercise strategic strategy in getting them accomplished?
[time=1722] Some head down to Florida here soon.
[time=1725] And because folks don't want to get burned in the son of Florida because they haven't seen son in four months here, we get these tokens and we go to the where?
[time=1735] Where do we go there tokens?
[time=1737] We go to tanning beds.
[time=1739] Some go to tanning beds because they want to be strategic in their tanning.
[time=1744] We want to get through the checkout line at the grocery store or as we say it in the Midwest and I've learned now because I'm now from the Midwest, it's the grocery.
[time=1752] It's not the grocery store, it's just the grocery.
[time=1754] And some of us want to get through the checkout line at the grocery in the most expedient fashion and so don't deny it, okay?
[time=1761] Because I do it too and you do the same thing.
[time=1763] We come to the lines, we've got our cart and we begin to look at people's carts and we begin to actually count items in their carts.
[time=1771] And if we're really desperate, we actually send kids to stand in lines wondering which line might move the quickest because we want to be expedient.
[time=1779] We want to be strategic in the way we manage our time.
[time=1783] We don't want to get caught speeding so we buy fuzzbusters.
[time=1787] Strategic law breaking I think is what that's called.
[time=1790] High school guys, and guys, bear with me here, I just got to speak the truth to you in love.
[time=1794] High school guys, they want a certain girl to notice them.
[time=1797] And I did the same thing when I was in high school guys, so don't sweat it.
[time=1800] High school guys want a certain girl to notice them and so they get strategic in the way they go about that.
[time=1805] They do things like bump into them at their lockers and flick them on the neck and say, "Hey, what's up?" High school girls want poems, Steve Longbrake tells me.
[time=1818] They want poems in conversations.
[time=1820] What do they get, they get a bump in the back, "Hey, what's up?" Strategic flirting, I guess is what that might be called.
[time=1829] Talk about strategy, I have friends who will work all the way through lunch diligently.
[time=1834] They'll work through lunch, they'll return all phone calls from their cell phone in the car.
[time=1839] They'll maintain an entire arsenal of clothes, rain gear, spikes, and sweatshirts in their trunk so that they can play nine holes of what?
[time=1847] Golf, strategic leisure.
[time=1849] You and I both will look for sales, we'll buy at certain times of the year, we'll do garage sales and we'll turn down the heat all in an effort to save what?
[time=1860] Strategic consumerism.
[time=1862] We'll get strategic with our tan, we'll get strategic with our golf, we'll get strategic with our money,
[time=1868] strategic with almost every avenue of life, but how strategic are we with evangelism?
[time=1877] How much time have you spent lately?
[time=1880] Giving strategic thought and effort and energy to the way you and your family will carry out the great commission on your block or in your home or with your extended family.
[time=1890] We spend hours sometimes together, planning for vacations and playing games,
[time=1896] not spend time together as families or friends, planning evangelistic endeavors with our seeking friends.
[time=1903] And the problem there sometimes lies in the fact that we don't have enough seeking friends.
[time=1910] Because to some degree we may be too busy being friends with each other, all opportunities to engage in the greatest endeavor ever known to man continue to just kind of flutter by right beneath our noses.
[time=1925] We'll go to enormous lengths to strategically pursue leisure, but does evangelism bring out of us that same kind of thought and that same kind of horsepower and that same kind of energy?
[time=1935] You know folks it's a mindset, it's a heart attitude.
[time=1939] An attitude that has its sights fixed on living and sharing truth with passion and with creativity
[time=1945] and with strategy and with dependence because we can have all the strategy in the world granted.
[time=1950] You and I can be strategic, spend hours thinking through and yet if we don't allow him to be in it,
[time=1956] if we don't function also in a dependent state, our best strategies down the tubes.
[time=1963] Not only were they strategic, but watch this, they were also sensitive as well.
[time=1967] It's a brief point, but one I think worth pointing out, look back at 14 and 15.
[time=1973] But going on from Perga they arrived at Poseidon Antioch and on the Sabbath day it says they went into the synagogue
[time=1979] and after the reading of the law and the prophets the synagogue officials sent to them saying,
[time=1986] brethren, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say it.
[time=1991] Did you see that?
[time=1993] Did you see how they came on to the scene?
[time=1996] Did you see how they made themselves present?
[time=1998] I mean it says they came in and sat down in the back, the guys read the scriptures, the guys come to them and say, if you have anything to say we'd love to hear it.
[time=2007] What a gracious loving beginning.
[time=2009] They didn't burst onto the scene, they didn't demand or assume or push and I mean after all it was Paul.
[time=2016] It was Barnabas I suppose somewhere in their minds that they could have thought that would have been called for, but no.
[time=2022] Absolute total complete humility.
[time=2026] Was reading on the plane several weeks ago, flying back here to Fort Wayne, picked up a magazine
[time=2033] and was reading in one article about one of our more recent, and I won't say her name, no sense in it,
[time=2039] but just one of our recent right now on the scene pop icons.
[time=2043] One of our pop divas today, making millions and millions of bucks, and I was reading about what takes place when she comes to a city.
[time=2052] If she's going to have a concert in your town, if you're the production company that brings her in,
[time=2058] there's a list of demands that you have to meet in order to have her do her thing
[time=2064] and the part that I read had to do with what has to be in her dressing room, what has to be in her changing area for her to come into a concert in your city.
[time=2074] She demands 16 dozen long stem red roses, one case of perrier, 10 dozen chocolate dip strawberries,
[time=2082] a Bose sound system set up in that space filling the room with music,
[time=2089] eight waterford crystal wine glasses and eight bottles of Dom Perion wine valued at 3,500 each.
[time=2096] Six trays of caviar, fresh salmon, fresh clams, crackers and breeches,
[time=2102] a waiter, a personal attendant, and a photographer.
[time=2107] There's what's needed. As she bursts on to your scene to do her thing and exercise her gift,
[time=2113] and I thought, "You know what absolute contrast." And I'm just thinking about Paul and Barnabas and all they have to offer, and all they have to give, and they come in, it says, and they sit in the back and wait for the invitation to share.
[time=2130] And I guess my point is this, you know, sometimes I watch Christians, and sometimes maybe you do as well. Sometimes I'm with people.
[time=2137] Sometimes I'll find myself in settings with other believers, and I'll see it.
[time=2142] Sometimes I see it on, you know, I see it on TV.
[time=2146] But whether it's on TV or whether it's in person, it just absolutely makes me cringe.
[time=2152] Sometimes I see the things we say.
[time=2155] I hear the things that come out of our mouths sometime.
[time=2158] I witness the timing with which it comes out of our mouths.
[time=2162] And I see the spirit with which sometimes it gets said.
[time=2166] And, you know, and we tell our kids at home never to say this, but sometimes I want to just grab people by the nap of their neck and say, "Shut up.
[time=2174] Who asked you? What are you doing? What are you saying?" Relax. Think about it.
[time=2182] Regroup. Get a clue. Something, you know?
[time=2187] 1 Peter 3. 1 Peter 3, 15 and 16 is a great, great reminder.
[time=2193] Turn there. If you've got your Bibles back for the back of the New Testament, how is this supposed to be done? What is the mindset?
[time=2199] What is the attitude? How sensitive are we to be?
[time=2202] Well, Peter reminds us in chapter 3 of 1 Peter there in verse 15, he says this.
[time=2211] 1 Peter 3, 15, "But sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts." Here you go. Always being ready to make a defense to everyone.
[time=2220] And then what does your Bible say? Who what? Who asks?
[time=2225] Did you read that? Did you see that? Are you hearing that?
[time=2228] A defense. Be ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account
[time=2234] for the hope that is in you yet with what your Bible say.
[time=2239] Gentleness and what? Reverence. With gentleness and with respect.
[time=2245] And keep a good conscience. Live right. Don't be a hypocrite.
[time=2250] Live right. Keep a good conscience so that in the thing which you are slandered, the thing in which you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame. Oh, he says, "Be ready." Absolutely.
[time=2263] Know what you want to say. Have a defense for the hope that is within you that when you are asked, you may respond.
[time=2271] And you may respond with insight and that you might respond with reverence and that you might respond with gentleness and with the truth.
[time=2279] So they are strategic in that Presidion Antioch is this major hub.
[time=2284] They are strategic. They are sensitive in how they say it.
[time=2288] And thirdly, they are sound in what they say.
[time=2292] And here is where Paul shows his absolute mastery of the gospel.
[time=2297] Go back, if you would, to Acts chapter 13.
[time=2304] Acts chapter 13, not only is the movement here strategic and sensitive, they are sound and they are straightforward in what they say.
[time=2313] And I want you to notice, and you can just kind of make notes on the side if you'd care to.
[time=2317] I want you to see three things under this third point.
[time=2320] I want you to write down and just take note of three steps, if you will, to the way the gospel gets laid out in this situation.
[time=2328] And I want you to pick it up in verse 17.
[time=2330] And then number one thing I want you to write down is this.
[time=2332] Paul is relevant. Write it down.
[time=2335] Paul is relevant in the way he communicates the gospel.
[time=2340] Another way you could say it is he speaks to his audience.
[time=2344] He speaks to his audience.
[time=2347] Look at verse 17, chapter 13, verse 17 down to 22.
[time=2351] Five verses, watch what he does.
[time=2353] Men of Israel, end of 16.
[time=2356] Men of Israel, and you who fear God, listen, and here he goes.
[time=2359] The God of this people Israel, shows our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt.
[time=2367] And with an uplifted arm, he led them out from it.
[time=2370] And for a period of about 40 years, he put up with them in the wilderness, and when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he distributed their land as an inheritance, all of which took about 450 years. And after these things, he gave them judges.
[time=2388] Time out here. Do you see what he's doing?
[time=2391] He's taking them through something. He's tracking them through something that they would be extremely familiar with.
[time=2399] Hang on. And after he gave him judges, until Samuel the prophet, and when verse 21 they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul, the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin for 40 years.
[time=2412] Verse 22, and after he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king, concerning whom he also testified and said, "I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man after my heart, who will do all my will."
[time=2426] You know what he just did for them? He just begins his presentation of the gospel by basically in five verses, tracking them from the book of Genesis to the book of 2 Samuel.
[time=2438] And he did it, "I am convinced because he knew his audience, and because there was this deep desire in him to be relevant, to somehow speak to them words of truth that would connect with who they were, and who were they, they were Jews.
[time=2453] And he was in a synagogue, and this was their history, and he gives them Jewish, Old Testament history.
[time=2460] He was relevant in the way he communicated truth to them.
[time=2464] And people will say to me today, what's the deal with relevancy?
[time=2469] Why do you always talk about it? Why do you always push it?
[time=2472] What's this whole thing about being relevant and doctrinally pure?
[time=2476] Well, because Jesus was, I say.
[time=2479] Jesus was the master, and Paul does the same thing here.
[time=2483] You know, and Jesus, if you look back through the gospels, he talked about seeds, and he talked about harvests, and he talked about workers, and he talked about whitewashed tombs, and he talked about sheep, and he talked about shepherds. Why, people?
[time=2498] Because that was the world they lived in. That was what they saw.
[time=2502] That was where they lived. That was their experience of that day, and he took truth and made it relevant. And he spoke to them, and taught them in terminology and in pictures that they could identify with.
[time=2514] Then Paul does the same thing here. He gives these Jews in this synagogue, Old Testament history. Then as he goes on, he does the very same thing that you should be doing.
[time=2524] He does the very same thing that I should be doing.
[time=2526] He does the very same thing that all of us should be committed to in whatever circumstance we have to present the gospel.
[time=2532] He keeps, number two, he keeps Christ the issue.
[time=2536] Write it down. He keeps, he's relevant. He knows his audience, but he keeps Christ the issue.
[time=2543] Verse 23, "From the offspring of this man according to promise, God has brought to Israel a Savior Jesus." You see it right there? Out of their rich tradition in history came Jesus Christ.
[time=2557] Now what about Christ? He keeps Christ the issue. What about Christ?
[time=2561] His death, verses 28 to 29, go over to 28 and 29, and though they found no ground, verse 28, and though they found no ground for putting him to death, they asked Pilate that he be executed, and when they had carried out all that was written concerning him, they took him down from the cross and laid him in a tomb.
[time=2581] He keeps Christ the issue. His death, His resurrection, verse 30, "But God raised him from the dead, and for many days he appeared to those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, the very ones who are now his witnesses to the people.
[time=2596] And we preach to you the good news of the promise made to the fathers that God has fulfilled this promise to our children in that he raised up Jesus.
[time=2606] As it is also written in the second Psalm, "Thou art my son, today I have begotten thee." And as for the fact that he raised him up from the dead, no more to return to decay. He has spoken in this way.
[time=2620] I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.
[time=2624] Therefore he also says, "In another Psalm, thou wilt not allow thy holy one to undergo decay."
[time=2630] And he didn't.
[time=2632] For David, after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation, fell asleep and was laid among his fathers and underwent decay.
[time=2640] But he whom God raised did not undergo decay.
[time=2644] He talks about his death. He talks about his resurrection.
[time=2648] These people were needy, hungry, thirsty people.
[time=2652] He talks to them about the forgiveness found in Christ, like at verse 38.
[time=2656] "Therefore let it be known to you, brethren, that through him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you and through him everyone who believes is freed from all things from which you could not be freed through the law of Moses.
[time=2672] He keeps Christ the issue." Go back to 1 Corinthians chapter 2. Paul not only keeps Christ the issue here in Acts 13 and throughout the book of Acts, he keeps Christ the issue in every ministry that he had the privilege of being a part of. Look at 1 Corinthians chapter 2.
[time=2692] The first letter he writes of the church at Corinth, he says there at the beginning of chapter 2, "And when I came to you, brethren, I did not come with the superiority of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God, for I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified, period.
[time=2712] And I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the spirit and of power, that your faith should not rest on the wisdom of the men, but on the power of God.
[time=2732] I came to you not with superiority of speech, first one, for I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[time=2744] He keeps Christ the issue. He keeps Christ the issue and thirdly write this down, he never forgets and you and I can never forget that it is Christ. It is God that closes the deal.
[time=2756] Not you, not me, not persuasive words. It is God who closes the deal. Look at verses, go back to Acts 13, pick it up in 46.
[time=2772] It says in Paul and Barnabas, verse 46, "And Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly and said it was necessary." Go back to 44, sorry.
[time=2780] And the next Sabbath, nearly the whole city assembled to hear the word of God.
[time=2784] But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and began contradicting the things spoken by Paul and were blaspheming and verse 46, and Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly and said it was necessary that the word of God should be spoken to you first, Jews, in the synagogue here, "Since you repudiated and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life behold, we are turning to the Gentiles. For thus the Lord has commanded us," verse 47, "He's saying I have placed you as a light for the Gentiles that you should bring salvation to the end of the earth and when the Gentiles heard this they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord and as many as had been appointed to eternal life that day right there believed. And the word of the Lord was being spread through the whole region. But the Jews aroused the devote women of prominence and the leading men of the city and gated a persecution against Paul and Barnabas and drove them out of their district, but they shook off the dust, shook off the dust of their feet in protest against them and went to Iconium and the disciples were continually, it says, filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.
[time=2860] Sometimes it's so easy and so tempting for you and I to begin to think that all of our effort, any kind of strategic god-led movement we may have made, relationships that may have been built. Our prayers and our hopes that people we've now begun to love and care for would come to know Christ. So many times in our strategic movement and in our sensitive approach and in our efforts to try and see people find and follow we kind of get towards the end of the process and actually begin to mistakenly think that somehow we have something to do ultimately with them coming to faith and we don't.
[time=2900] God uses us, God allows us to encourage, I think, in the midst of the process.
[time=2906] But as one of our core values here at Blackhawk, we've got several core values and we're going to talk more about these core values in the months to come. There's a couple that come to my mind when I think about our efforts here at Blackhawk.
[time=2918] One of those core values reads like this, "God has called the church you and me. He has commanded not suggested. He has called us to initiate and cultivate life-changing relationships but salvation, salvation, people coming to faith, walking over the bridge, drawing lines in the sand putting a stake in the ground that says, "I believe and I give my life." That, my friends, is an act of God. That is not you and that is not me. He calls us as the church to cultivate and initiate life-changing relationships. And then that last one, number 10, from a list of about 12 or 13, I think, it says, "The church is to be culturally relevant, culturally relevant while remaining doctrinally pure." I want you to see the end of that Stephen Curtis Chapman quote. I think it ended up, we left off with the fact that it said, "God has heard our cry. God has heard our cry and he has." And I think it's going to come up there for you. He has sent his son, Jesus Christ.
[time=2986] He's heard your cry. This is a world. I believe with what Chapman said.
[time=2990] I believe our world is full of people, many of who may be sitting in this room this morning, crying out, lives in crisis, families in turmoil, futures uncertain, and this culture, people in this day are crying out. Where is the hope? Where is the peace? Where is the meaning to life? And as Stephen Curtis Chapman said, "God has heard our cry." He has sent his son, Jesus Christ, and heaven has come to the real world.
[time=3022] And now is the time for those of us who embody this kingdom, those of us who know him, and those of us who have given our lives to him. Now is the time for us to defend the truth, it says.
[time=3034] To defend the truth, to overcome evil with good and live lives that proclaim, to live lives that display and invite those searching to a peace and hope they've never known.
[time=3050] And that is the very thing we give ourselves to. Here as we try our best to help seekers find and follow Christ. My hope, my hope is that we would do it.
[time=3062] And I would do it individually, that we would do it as a family in a way that is with his leading and with his help and for his glory strategic and sensitive and straightforward and sound. And that is what we're attempting.
[time=3078] And you need to. You may need to tonight sit down with your family. You may need to tonight sit down with some good friends.
[time=3086] You may need to just sit quietly in the peace and quiet of your own home, your own room, your own table. It may be an individual thing.
[time=3094] But I tell you, it probably wouldn't be a bad idea for those of us that call this place home to go home tonight and say, wait a minute, time out. Hey gang. How strategic are we being? Really. It's the greatest endeavor ever given to mankind. And we have opportunities go lower right in front of us. How strategic are we being? How sensitive are we being? And are we ready to make a defense? Can we be sound and straightforward?
[time=3122] I hope you'll give it some thought. And as we leave this morning, I want to just leave with you the pictures and the words to a song you've heard before. And several months ago, over a year ago we put the words to this song to a video.
[time=3138] And it is just a reminder. And keep your seats and sit tight. And as the song has played and as you hear these words again that many of you have heard before, remember that we as a church and you as individuals, our attempt is to handle this well and to communicate and live it out in such a way that those we come in contact with understand we are leaving a light on. And there are so many who need to see a light. There are so many who need that hope and who need that promise.
[time=3170] And so as a church, we're doing our very best with moms and with students and with professionals and with the whole gamut of folks that God's given us to live our lives with here in Northeast Fort Wayne, we're doing our best to leave a light on.
[time=3186] This morning you may be one who needs some refining and some retuning on how you leave your light on.
[time=3194] This morning you might be one here this morning and you're just desperate for some answers.
[time=3198] Wondering what it's like to have forgiveness and peace and direction. However this affects you, however this message, however this song impacts you please give what we've talked about this morning some thought.
