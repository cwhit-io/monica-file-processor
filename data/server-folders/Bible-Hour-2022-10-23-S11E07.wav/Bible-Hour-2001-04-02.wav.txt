[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=10] Welcome to the Sunday Morning Worship Service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=14] Thank you for joining us.
[time=15] We trust that the music and message from God's word will help you in your Christian walk.
[time=20] Now let's join our service.
[time=22] [MUSIC - 116 seconds]
[time=151] [APPLAUSE]
[time=156] Listen to what it says in Luke, chapter 19.
[time=160] Verse 29, and it says, "And it came about that when he approached Bethvage and Bethany near the Mount that is called Olivette, he sent two of his disciples saying, "Go into the village opposite you in which, as you enter, you will find a cult tied on which no one yet has ever sat untie it," he said, and bring it here.
[time=179] And if anyone asks you, "Why are you untying it, thus shall you speak the Lord has need of it?"
[time=185] And those who were sent went away and found it just as he had told them, and as they were untying the cult, its owners said to them, "Why are you untying the cult?"
[time=194] And they said, verse 34, "The Lord has need of it." And they brought it to Jesus, and they threw their garments on the cult and put Jesus on it, and as he was going, they were spreading their garments in the road.
[time=207] And as he was now approaching near the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to praise God joyfully with a loud voice for all the miracles which they had seen, saying, "Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord, peace in heaven, and glory in the highest."
[time=225] And some of the Pharisees in the multitude said to him, "Teacher, rebuke your disciples." And I love this. He answered and said, "I tell you if these became silent, the stones would cry out.
[time=241] You can't keep them silent. You can't keep them quiet. Those who have seen me, those who have experienced my ministry, those who have come face to face with a living God cannot be silent.
[time=253] The stones will cry out, and when he approached, he saw the city and wept open."
[time=272] "But as he who comes in the name of the Lord, peace in heaven, and glory in the highest."
[time=286] This will help, welcome to our hearts, near to reigning consciousness.
[time=299] "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, peace in heaven, and glory in the highest."
[time=313] "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord."
[time=343] "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, peace in heaven, and glory in the highest."
[time=411] What a great number about the choir and what a great reminder of what a great day this is, and I hope I was thinking as they were singing,
[time=422] and as I was reading through that Luke 19 passage there, and it doesn't say this anywhere, and I'm not trying to,
[time=429] I'm not adding anything to the text, I'm just imagining in my mind, alright, and maybe you would just want to imagine along with me for just a moment.
[time=438] What it must have been like for him to get up on that cult, you know what I mean?
[time=445] It was time, the week had come, and it was time for him to get up on that cult, and it was time for him to ride into that city,
[time=455] and they weren't all sure as to what it would lead to, but he knew, he knew.
[time=463] He knew that as he got up on that cult and as he began to be led down that road, he knew exactly what was going to happen.
[time=471] And again, I'm struck by the fact that he got on that cult and he got led down that road with you, with you, and with me in mind.
[time=481] And that's a truth, that's a principle that we should never ever, you should never, I should never lose sight of.
[time=489] And as we think about this Sunday, Palm Sunday, as we think about all that it represents, I hope in the midst of the celebrating and the excitement of what it means in terms of history and what it means with respect to eternity.
[time=503] I hope you don't lose sight, I hope I never lose sight of what it means with regard to what he did that day as he got up on that cult and rode down that road to face all that he faced for you and for me.
[time=516] Let me just pray if I could, Father, we look forward.
[time=521] We look forward to a week that brings us and culminates Father next Sunday on the day that we celebrate Easter and your resurrection and the new life which you bring, the defeat of death, you being who you said you were, you conquering the grave.
[time=541] That is something that we look forward to and yet, Father, we pause today because we realize that as our Lord and as our Savior, Jesus Christ, though you were committed to this plan, God, today, today is that day when you began to go down that road on the back of a cult.
[time=559] And we can't help but think that in your humanness, you must have been fearful. In your humanness, there must have been a sense of fear.
[time=571] And yet, Father, we are so glad that in your divinity, Lord, you continued to go forward and you did it for us.
[time=580] And so we look forward to celebrating that together next week. We pray for those now and throughout this week, God, who will come and join us on Sunday, many whom we've invited others who will just show up.
[time=594] And our prayer is that this truth that we hold so dear would come alive through the work of your Spirit, that it would come alive in their hearts and in their minds, and that because of our time together next week and because of your work in their hearts and your work here in our midst, God, that people might come to know in a personal way, you.
[time=617] And then coming to know you that they would understand freedom and peace and forgiveness like they've never known before.
[time=624] And so we celebrate today. The beginning of this week, we celebrate all that it signifies we are so thankful for what it means, and God, we pray as we come together, seven days from now, that our celebration, our excitement, and our thanks would be even sweeter.
[time=641] In your son's name we pray. Amen. Well, hey, open up to Acts, Acts chapter 15.
[time=649] This morning we have the privilege of asking one of the most important questions, probably the most important question of all time, and I mean that.
[time=658] What must one do to be saved?
[time=663] What must one do to be saved? The greatest question of all time, the most important question of our age.
[time=670] What must one do to be saved? Acts chapter 15, this morning verses 1 to 12.
[time=676] Not long after Christopher Columbus discovered the New World, the Reformers discovered, or should we say rediscovered, the Gospel.
[time=686] It had been hidden away for centuries in a damp dungeon called legalism. In those days, according to the religious higher-ups in the Catholic Church, human effort was the requirement for salvation.
[time=697] But when the Reformers heard the trapped cry of truth, they determined to set free the doctrine of salvation by faith alone.
[time=705] It was a valiant rescue, one filled with daring advances and vicious reprisals, and trumpeting the cause, the loudest was the German monk named who, Martin Luther, Martin Luther.
[time=718] He and his followers stood their ground against anyone who opposed the Gospel of Grace, and between their refusal to forsake reform and the church's refusal to abandon tradition, the smoke of church war billowed thick.
[time=734] And the guns of contention blazed red-hot, and Luther dreamed though of the day when the battle fires would dim and the church would once again unite under truth's banner, the banner of Scripture, not tradition.
[time=751] And like Luther, just like Luther, we've seen the apostles here in the book of Acts, both Peter and Paul, having to fight for and stand firm on the doctrine of grace, salvation by grace through faith and faith alone.
[time=768] Luther's battle for the truth came up against what was then the Catholic tradition, and here in Acts we've seen in Acts 6 and Acts 10 and 11 with Peter and the white sheet coming down.
[time=779] That was in Acts 10 and Acts 11 we saw with Peter and Cornelius and his whole household.
[time=784] We've seen grace and God's plan to extend it to all coming up against the Jewish tradition, and those that were stuck in it.
[time=794] Now remember, just for a moment here this morning before we move on, remember what this would have looked like, okay?
[time=800] Understand that this Jewish tradition, that this doctrine of grace was bumping up against, and people in that Jewish tradition were actually responding to the Gospel, and yet there was this conflict inside of them.
[time=815] Understand that these that were struggling had been Jews for life, and it was all they had ever known, it was all they had ever seen, it was all they had ever heard.
[time=826] It was what they had been trained with and for from the beginning of their days, and now they had come to faith in Christ.
[time=832] Imagine if you would, just in your mind's eyes, say a 50, 60-year-old Jew who was now completely committed to Christ, had responded favorably, had embraced the Gospel.
[time=845] Now a Christian Jew, a Christian Jew who now faced an enormous internal conflict, Chuck Swindall described it like this.
[time=853] If Jesus was the Messiah of the Jews, what would this man, this 50 or 60-year-old converted Jew now think about non-Jews, who also became convinced of his Lord's lordship?
[time=865] Now the Christian Jew had a problem, conditioning and cultural pride flowed in his bloodstream.
[time=872] His people had paid a high price to maintain their uniqueness, and he was not about or willing to give away the centuries of tradition that had made Israel a great people for the Lord to,
[time=881] to a people who did not and would not conform.
[time=884] If Jesus was the Hebrew Messiah, anyone wanting his salvation would now have to become a Hebrew first.
[time=891] How else could he know the full meaning and purpose of God?
[time=894] The law of Moses, this man would think, must be maintained as the preliminary preparation for the new life in Christ.
[time=901] This converted Jew and his followers were not bad people.
[time=905] They were not bad people. Their problem was this. Now watch this.
[time=909] They stood with one foot in Moses' law and one foot in Christ's love, and now the ground was beginning to separate beneath them.
[time=919] They should have to leap one way or the other, but not without a frantic effort to hold back the earthquake and the resulting theological fault,
[time=928] having tried to maintain both and they were now ending up with either or, which contradicted the Messiah himself and his unqualified love for all.
[time=938] There was an enormous internal struggle within these people who had lived and had grown up with and had known this tradition and now had embraced Christ.
[time=948] And the conflict brought about some complications.
[time=953] And this is what it looked like in Acts 15. Legalism.
[time=957] Legalism comes to Antioch, Acts chapter 15 verses 1 to 2.
[time=962] Are you there? Here we go, verse 1.
[time=964] And it says there in some men came down from Judea and began teaching the brethren unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses.
[time=974] There's the tradition.
[time=976] Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you, they were saying, you cannot be saved.
[time=982] And when Paul and Barnabas had great dissension and debate with them, the brethren determined that Paul and Barnabas and certain others of them should go up to Jerusalem,
[time=991] to the apostles and elders concerning this issue.
[time=995] Stop right there.
[time=996] These confused, tradition-minded Jewish believers were actually saying that circumcision, according to the law of Moses, was of necessity for salvation.
[time=1009] You could not be saved.
[time=1011] They were teaching without it.
[time=1014] Circumcision of necessity for salvation.
[time=1019] And right there we begin this morning in our time here.
[time=1023] I mean, right there is our first glimpse at this question.
[time=1026] And we're going to answer it as we go through the morning, but I'll just throw it out there again to you.
[time=1030] What must a person do?
[time=1032] Just be thinking about it.
[time=1034] Have your mind and heart open to it again this morning.
[time=1036] What must a person do?
[time=1038] To be saved.
[time=1040] Paul knew.
[time=1042] And Paul knew this teaching.
[time=1044] This legalistic tradition-minded teaching that was now springing up there in this young church, he knew it was wrong.
[time=1050] He knew it was not God's plan.
[time=1052] He understood their confusion because he himself had once been what?
[time=1056] A Pharisee.
[time=1057] He understood exactly.
[time=1059] I mean, he was able to identify personally with their struggle and this internal turmoil.
[time=1064] But he realizes the heresy of their words, and so he dissents, it says, and debates.
[time=1071] Now, what would this be like in the reality of your day, my day?
[time=1077] What would this teaching look like if it were to rear its head today?
[time=1081] And you know what it does?
[time=1082] It rears its head every day, even still.
[time=1085] This would be like someone telling you that you couldn't be right with God.
[time=1089] This would be like someone telling you you couldn't be saved unless you wore your hair a certain length.
[time=1094] Unless you only listened to certain kinds of music, couldn't be saved, couldn't be right with God unless you prayed toward Mecca.
[time=1100] Confessed your sin to another human or served a two-year mission.
[time=1103] Couldn't be saved or right with God unless you stopped celebrating holidays or refused to use birth control.
[time=1109] All the above, in some places, even today, being equated with salvation.
[time=1114] And all of the above, according to the word of God, having absolutely nothing to do with salvation.
[time=1122] Nothing.
[time=1126] Now, what Paul and Barnabas and the church in Antioch did next, the route they took in dealing with the confusion was extremely critical
[time=1134] and incredibly wise.
[time=1136] What we're about to see, what you're about to read through, affected all of Christian history.
[time=1141] Really did.
[time=1142] This is an amazing event that we see unfolding here.
[time=1145] It affected all of Christian history in the way we view salvation today because legalism, number two, legalism got sent back to Jerusalem.
[time=1155] Rears its head in Antioch, confusion erupts in legalism gets sent back to Jerusalem.
[time=1160] Look at chapter 15, verse 3.
[time=1163] "Therefore, being sent on their way by the church, they were passing through both Phoenicia and Samaria,
[time=1169] describing in detail the conversion of the Gentiles, and were bringing great joy," it says, "to all the brethren.
[time=1177] And when they arrived at Jerusalem, they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders,
[time=1183] and reported all that God had done with them.
[time=1186] But certain ones of the sect of the Pharisees who had believed stood up saying it is necessary to circumcise them and to direct them to observe the law of Moses."
[time=1198] And the apostles, verse 6, and the elders came together to look into this matter.
[time=1206] Now, I want to just kind of do a little side note thing here, okay?
[time=1209] It struck me as I read through and looked at that earlier in the week.
[time=1213] And we're going to get to the Jerusalem council.
[time=1215] We're going to get to kind of what took place here.
[time=1217] But I want you just to notice something, okay?
[time=1219] And file this little observation kind of under the heading of the effects of legalism, the effects of traditionalism.
[time=1230] And maybe you caught it as we read through there.
[time=1232] Very interesting.
[time=1233] And you know what?
[time=1234] Very, very sad.
[time=1236] They get sent the text that we just read, says they got sent to Jerusalem.
[time=1241] And so as they make their way to Jerusalem, Paul and Barnabas and those that were with them, it says they traveled through Phoenicia and Samaria.
[time=1251] Phoenicia and Samaria, places that had just recently been penetrated with the fresh new truth and hope of the gospel.
[time=1259] And as they went through these newly reached cities, it says they were able to report all that God had done.
[time=1266] And what does it say it brought to the hearts of those in those cities?
[time=1271] What does it say?
[time=1272] It brought them great what?
[time=1274] Joy.
[time=1275] It brought them great joy to see God at work.
[time=1279] It brought them great joy to hear of new life in Christ.
[time=1284] It brought these people great joy to hear reports of what the gospel had produced and what faith was now working in the heart.
[time=1294] I mean, they brought them joy.
[time=1297] And now keep reading.
[time=1299] In that passage, it says these same guys, Paul and Barnabas come to Jerusalem.
[time=1305] Steeped in tradition already.
[time=1308] Stuck in the way it's always been.
[time=1311] And they come to Jerusalem and the passage says there that they reported all that God had done.
[time=1317] And what was the response from these folks?
[time=1322] Circumcised them.
[time=1324] Gotta get them circumcised.
[time=1326] Gotta get them to follow the law.
[time=1331] Do you see that?
[time=1335] Great joy.
[time=1337] Wow, praise God.
[time=1339] He's at work.
[time=1341] People having no clue as to what traditionalism or legalism looks like.
[time=1346] And you come over here to folks steeped in the way that it's always been.
[time=1350] And they hear about new life in Christ.
[time=1352] And I read that I think, man, where's the wow?
[time=1355] Where's the, oh my goodness, where's the praise God?
[time=1359] None of that.
[time=1362] And that's what happens, people.
[time=1364] Again, remind yourself this morning of who you don't wanna be.
[time=1369] And the kind of place we never wanna become.
[time=1372] Because that's what happens when you get steeped in it.
[time=1376] The heart begins to shrink.
[time=1378] The sense of who God is and what He does begins to fade.
[time=1383] And it's an absolute tragedy.
[time=1385] So consumed people get.
[time=1387] With how it was being done, they missed what was being done.
[time=1393] And it's a sad sight.
[time=1395] It's a sad commentary.
[time=1397] And it is not who I ever wanna be.
[time=1400] It's not who you wanna be.
[time=1402] It's not the kind of place we wanna be.
[time=1404] We always wanna be receptive to open and so very thankful and so very moved and so very
[time=1411] excited by the work of God in the lives of people.
[time=1414] And you gotta ask that.
[time=1416] And you gotta ask yourself this morning.
[time=1424] You know, I can't get inside your heart.
[time=1426] You can't get inside in mind, but I'll tell you what, you can evaluate.
[time=1432] You can evaluate you when you hear stories today.
[time=1436] When you hear stories on a third Sunday night from that tank.
[time=1441] When you hear stories in your small group, when you hear stories in your ABF, you hear stories in the lives of those that you minister with.
[time=1448] When you hear us in here talk about the things that God is doing.
[time=1452] What does it stir in you?
[time=1455] And I guess my hope is that it stirs something.
[time=1462] That we would be like Phoenicia and Samaria.
[time=1465] With great joy of rejoicing in what God has done.
[time=1470] Well, the Jerusalem Council, as they became known, the Jerusalem Council convenes.
[time=1476] And I want you to see two very, very important insights from this historic event.
[time=1481] The first thing I want you to note, and you can just kind of make note of this wherever you might have some room.
[time=1485] The first thing I want you to see about what's about to happen is how they got to the decision.
[time=1491] How they got to the decision.
[time=1494] Because as is always the case, a determination was needed.
[time=1498] We needed to come to a conclusion.
[time=1500] And you know what?
[time=1501] That's part of life, folks.
[time=1503] And in this case, there was a huge conclusion that needed to be gotten to.
[time=1508] I mean, they needed to reach a decision.
[time=1510] And you need to, and I need to reach decisions all the time.
[time=1513] And whether it's what to do with the salvation by a grace thing or whether it has to do with where we're going to eat lunch.
[time=1519] The way we make decisions, how we treat each other in the process of getting to a decision is so very important.
[time=1527] So very vital.
[time=1529] And I want you to see how they went about this.
[time=1531] Understand this, too, that this issue was so very volatile.
[time=1535] Years and years of tradition, years and years of practice coming up against things that were new.
[time=1542] It was very volatile.
[time=1543] Emotions were at a peak.
[time=1544] And if it had been allowed to boil over the church as we know, it could have died.
[time=1549] It was that big.
[time=1551] So much on the line.
[time=1552] But as the text unfolds, there isn't even a hint.
[time=1556] And this is what's so encouraging.
[time=1558] This is what's so exciting.
[time=1559] Not even a hint of anger, factions or disunity.
[time=1563] Debate, yes.
[time=1564] Difficult discussions, yes.
[time=1566] And I think of the words in 2 Timothy.
[time=1571] Go ahead and flip back there.
[time=1573] 2 Timothy.
[time=1574] As I read through this Jerusalem Council, and as you and I will have the chance to look through this today in a couple of weeks,
[time=1581] I want you to sense the attitude with which these people dealt with each other as they worked through this very challenging issue.
[time=1589] And as you read through it, as I read through it last week, I couldn't help but come back to these words in 2 Timothy 2, verse 24 and 25 where it says this.
[time=1599] And folks, this has got to be you.
[time=1601] And this has got to be me.
[time=1602] This is how we must deal with each other on our road to conclusions.
[time=1610] As we make decisions, as we grapple with issues, verse 24, and the Lord's bondservant must not be quarrelsome,
[time=1618] but be kind to all, able to teach, patient when wronged, with gentleness, correcting those who are in opposition, if perhaps God may grant them repentance,
[time=1631] leading to the knowledge of the truth.
[time=1634] How are you doing?
[time=1638] How am I doing?
[time=1639] How are we as a church doing?
[time=1640] How do we do with each other as we face conflict, as we face differing opinions?
[time=1646] How do we in the church today treat each other as we deal with difficult or confusing issues?
[time=1653] You've seen perhaps, and I know I have seen situations within churches, within the family of God,
[time=1661] too many times we've seen those conflicts go south.
[time=1665] Too many times we've seen.
[time=1668] And maybe you've seen it in your own life, I know I've seen it in mine at times.
[time=1673] And when we bump up against it, it's so difficult and so damaging.
[time=1679] We've seen ministries ruin, you've seen churches split because people were unwilling to not be quarrelsome,
[time=1687] unwilling to be kind to all, not wanting to teach, but push things, agendas, and opinions down people's throats,
[time=1696] not being patient when wrong, not exercising gentleness as they attempt to correct,
[time=1704] circle it.
[time=1705] 2 Timothy 2, 24 and 25.
[time=1708] And as we read through Acts 15, you'll see the spirit with which these folks got it done.
[time=1714] Now, 2nd insight quickly, before we move on, how did this local church handle the conflict?
[time=1720] I guess, in some ways, kind of just a minor observation, but I think one that we've got to take a look at.
[time=1728] This church in Antioch, Acts 15, all of a sudden found itself in the midst of turmoil.
[time=1735] I mean, there was an issue at hand that was causing great confusion.
[time=1739] There was a decision that needed to be made.
[time=1741] Direction was being needed.
[time=1743] I mean, there was a sense where this church there in Acts 15 was in quite a spot.
[time=1749] And I just want you, I want all of us to know what they did with that, how they chose to resolve that.
[time=1757] There was a dispute, questions that needed addressing, who did they take it to?
[time=1763] Did they get everybody in a big room and call for a vote?
[time=1768] They put microphones up in the aisles and hammer it out?
[time=1774] No, it says they took it to the elders.
[time=1779] It says they took their question, they took their dilemma, and they allowed God's design for the church to be God's design,
[time=1787] and they allowed men appointed by God to do what they had been appointed to do.
[time=1792] And that was a lead, lovingly, carefully, prayerfully, thoughtfully, lead.
[time=1799] They realized the issue, and they sinned this band of people, Paul and Barnabas to the elders for direction, for insight, and for guidance.
[time=1808] It's good for us to remember that.
[time=1810] Now, as those gathered in Jerusalem, as they gathered and began to hear from those whom God had called to lead,
[time=1818] as they revisited the divine intent, and as they revisited the divine activity of that day, it soon became clear that, number three, legalism would lose.
[time=1829] It soon became very clear in that room, I believe, that tradition and religion would again lose.
[time=1836] Look at chapter 15, verse 7.
[time=1839] Acts 15, verse 7, and after there had been much debate, Peter stood up and said to them, "Brother,
[time=1846] brethren, you know that in the early days, God made a choice among you, that by my mouth, the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe." Underline that word, believe, that the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe.
[time=1863] And God, who knows the heart bore witness to them, giving them the Holy Spirit just as he also did to us.
[time=1870] And he made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith.
[time=1875] Underline that, by faith.
[time=1879] Now therefore, why, Peter says, why do you put God to the test by placing upon the necks of the disciples a yoke,
[time=1888] which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?
[time=1893] But we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus in the same way as they also are,
[time=1901] and all the multitude kept silent.
[time=1904] And they were listening to Barnabas and Paul as they then began to relate what signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles.
[time=1915] Now we'll follow the progression and see the conclusion of this meeting of the minds in two weeks.
[time=1922] But I want us to stop here, and I want us to answer the question.
[time=1926] I want this morning for us to just take a few minutes, and I want us to answer the question.
[time=1934] Many of you in the room this morning have answered it.
[time=1938] Many of you here in the room this morning, as that slide came up onto the screen as I came up here,
[time=1944] you know the answer to the question. You yourselves, by God's grace and with His help, answered the question.
[time=1954] Maybe two months ago, maybe two years ago, maybe 20 years ago.
[time=1958] And you know what, if you're here this morning and you know the answer to the question, it's a good thing because you need to be reminded again and again of what the answer is.
[time=1968] Not just for your own sake, not just for your own assurance, not just for your own stability,
[time=1974] but because you too, like me and those around this place, you've given your life.
[time=1978] You're giving your days to helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=1984] And part of finding Him as He works in the hearts and lives of people, and as He draws them to Himself,
[time=1991] part of that process is you and I having special and unique opportunities to share with them the answer to the question.
[time=2001] Others of you here this morning, you've been searching and you've been looking.
[time=2005] And you've been around here for a while, maybe even, or today may even be your first time.
[time=2010] But when it gets right down to it and the question gets asked, what must a person do to be saved?
[time=2018] For someone to experience and have confidence in eternal life with God.
[time=2024] For someone to experience hope and forgiveness and freedom from shame and meaning for everyday living.
[time=2030] For someone to truly and genuinely be saved, what must they do?
[time=2035] And in your heart of hearts, you know, you know that that's the question.
[time=2042] And we need to answer that question.
[time=2045] And I'm so thankful that the text, that this book, that God's Word, the truth is so very clear.
[time=2055] These confused traditionalists had kind of popped up there in Antioch and said, got to be circumcised to be saved.
[time=2063] They wanted to bring their tradition into God's plan.
[time=2066] It wasn't going to work.
[time=2068] Because God had a plan and God has a plan.
[time=2071] And there's an answer to the question.
[time=2074] Flip over a page or two to Acts 16, would you?
[time=2077] And if you don't have a Bible, just look on with someone next to you.
[time=2081] So what does one have to do in order to be saved?
[time=2084] There's no way in the next few minutes that we're going to give this an exhaustive look.
[time=2088] But let's just do our best to hit some highlights.
[time=2091] Acts 16.
[time=2093] Look with me if you would at verse 23.
[time=2096] We'll get to this passage in a few weeks.
[time=2099] But just to set the stage briefly, Paul and Silas are here in Philippi.
[time=2107] And they have exercised a demon from a gal who was making a lot of money for these guys that were manipulating her and using her to their benefit.
[time=2116] He exercises this demon out of this gal and it ticks these guys off.
[time=2120] They have him beaten.
[time=2121] I mean they have these guys beaten and thrown in jail.
[time=2124] And it says here in verse 23, and when they had inflicted many blows upon them, they threw them into prison, commanding the jailer to guard them securely.
[time=2132] And he having received such a command threw them into the inner prison, which would have been solitary confinement in that day, and fastened their feet in stocks.
[time=2142] But about midnight, Paul and Silas, it says there in verse 25, were praying and singing hymns of praise to God, and the prisoners were listening to them.
[time=2150] And suddenly there came a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison house were shaken, and immediately all the doors were opened.
[time=2158] And everyone's chains were infastened.
[time=2160] And when the jailer had been roused out of sleep and had seen the prison doors open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped, and their escape would have meant his life.
[time=2173] He's about to kill himself, but Paul, verse 28, cried out with a loud voice saying, "Do yourself no harm, for we are all here."
[time=2181] And he called for lights, and rushed in, and trembling with fear, he fell down before Paul and Silas.
[time=2189] And after he brought them out, he said, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
[time=2198] And they said, "Believe, believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2207] Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household."
[time=2213] He asked the question, "What must I do to be saved?" Their response, "Believe in the Lord Jesus." Write this one down, Mark 16, 16. Mark 16, 16 says, "He who has disbelieved," there's that word again.
[time=2230] "He who has disbelieved shall be condemned." That's what it says in Mark 16.
[time=2237] Go back before the book of Acts, flip back to, excuse me, after Acts to Romans.
[time=2243] Go to Romans 4, "What must a man do to be saved?"
[time=2250] Romans 4, here in this chapter, we find the great story of Abraham and his faith.
[time=2257] And in Romans 4, we're going to pick it up in verse 18.
[time=2261] It's kind of in the middle of telling the story about Abraham and his great faith.
[time=2265] And speaking with reference to this issue of salvation, Paul says this in verse 18, "In hope against hope he believed," there's that word.
[time=2274] "In order that he might become a father of many nations," according to that which had been spoken,
[time=2281] "so shall your descendants be." And without verse 19 becoming weak in faith, he contemplated his own body, now as good as dead,
[time=2289] since he was about 100 years old, and the deadness of Sarah's womb, yet with respect to the promise of God,
[time=2296] he did not waver in unbelief but grew strong in faith, giving glory to God and being fully assured
[time=2304] that what he had promised he was able also to perform, therefore also it was reckoned to him as righteousness.
[time=2312] Now, Paul says, moving from Abraham to us, now not for his sake only was it written, that it was reckoned to him,
[time=2319] but for our sake also, to whom it will be reckoned as those who believe in him, who raise Jesus our Lord from the dead.
[time=2333] What must a person do to be saved?
[time=2336] Go to Romans 10.
[time=2348] Paul again, writing here to the church at Rome, in verse 9 he says this,
[time=2356] "And that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead,
[time=2365] you shall be saved, for with the heart man believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation."
[time=2378] Look at verse 11, "For the Scripture says, 'Whoever believes in him will not be disappointed.
[time=2386] For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord is Lord of all, abounding enriches for all who call upon him.'"
[time=2396] How do you get saved?
[time=2398] Look at verse 9, "That if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and what?
[time=2405] Believe, believe in your heart, believe that what? That God raised him from the dead, you shall be saved."
[time=2418] Now, follow me here, okay? True, true genuine belief, and by the way, if you didn't catch it, belief is the answer to the question.
[time=2431] What must a person do to be saved? They must believe.
[time=2435] Believe what? The gospel. The truth about Jesus.
[time=2441] And true, genuine, okay, down deep in one's heart, down deep in one's soul.
[time=2448] Follow me now, true genuine belief leads to true genuine action, true genuine obedience, true genuine submission.
[time=2460] I mean, there is a belief, and many of you knew this at one point in your life.
[time=2464] You kind of grew up in it. There was a belief in your life, and even mine, that kind of just did this.
[time=2471] Many of you have experienced, many of you years ago, prior to coming to Christ, I could have asked you,
[time=2477] do you believe in the Lord Jesus, and you would have nodded your head, yes.
[time=2481] But see, folks, what this is talking about is not the mental nodding of a head.
[time=2487] This is a belief that reaches, it takes the belief from the head to the where?
[time=2492] Heart. And when that belief, when the belief in this gets to the heart, it changes people.
[time=2502] It changes people. There is a mental belief, there is a mental ascent, there is a nodding of the head that says, yes, I believe in God. That is not salvation.
[time=2512] No, there is a true and authentic and genuine belief in the gospel that reaches into and changes actions,
[time=2523] brings obedience and submission. You might want to say it like this, true belief in the gospel,
[time=2529] true belief in the gospel, and you genuinely confessing, as it says there in Romans 10,
[time=2535] a good word for confessing there is proclaiming.
[time=2538] Sometimes on Third Sunday nights, you'll come and sit here and you'll hear people tell their story,
[time=2545] how it is that God brought them to Himself. That is them confessing Him as Lord.
[time=2551] That is them proclaiming to you what He did in their life and how they came to believe in Him.
[time=2560] True belief in the gospel, and you or I genuinely, proclaiming Him as Lord of your life leads to a changed heart, right down 2 Corinthians 5,
[time=2572] 2 Corinthians 5 where it says all things are made, what? New.
[time=2577] Old things have passed away, all things now in Him are made new.
[time=2581] True belief in the gospel and you genuinely confessing, proclaiming Him as Lord leads to a changed heart,
[time=2587] it leads to a changed life. And a change, now watch this, and a changed heart will lead to a changed life
[time=2597] that due to the heart change will want to and will as practiced choose things that didn't use to choose.
[time=2604] Patience over anger, personal purity over sexual sin, spiritual leadership in the home over self-indulgent laziness, marital faith over self-serving escapism, kind words over gossip, self-control over gluttony, and the list goes on and on and on and on. And it all may not happen in one day and it all may not happen in one week,
[time=2630] but genuine faith that goes from the mind to the heart changes the way one lives.
[time=2636] And you begin to, and I begin to see different activity.
[time=2641] Now, careful, because this is where sometimes it gets confusing.
[time=2645] Does the doing of the different activity get anybody saved? Yes or no? No.
[time=2651] The doing of the different activity proves that people are saved.
[time=2656] It is an evidence. It is an evidence of true salvation. It doesn't get you saved.
[time=2662] If you come to me and say, "Hey, I've been patient and not angry, personally pure over sexual sin, a spiritual leading now in my home, not sitting on the couch, I'm saying kind words over gossip,
[time=2672] exercising self." No, you can do all that stuff.
[time=2676] But unless all that stuff is born out of a changed heart that is believed in the gospel
[time=2683] and confessed him as Lord, entering into that personal relationship with him,
[time=2689] it's all for not. It's all for not. No changed life. No changed life, probably no changed heart.
[time=2702] And you've got to think about that, whoever you are. You've got to think about that.
[time=2711] And what I mean is this, I just hope. We, we here in this place, we would just hope
[time=2717] that there wouldn't be a person here that would, when that day comes,
[time=2723] be banking on eternity based upon the fact that back here you nodded your head and said,
[time=2729] "Yeah, I believe." Because the day will come, it says in Matthew 7, when he will look at someone
[time=2735] and say, "Depart from me, for I never what? I never knew you." There is a belief that nods its head and there is a belief that knows him because it has believed the gospel, given his or her life to Christ.
[time=2752] And therein is a huge chasm, there is a huge difference between the two.
[time=2756] And you've got to know that and you've got to just not know it, you've got to act upon it.
[time=2760] Believe people, believe the gospel, that God here it is, here it is again.
[time=2768] And we'll always say this to you again and again and again.
[time=2771] To remind you or to inform you for the first time, whoever you may be, believe the gospel and what is the gospel that God in his great love and out of a desire to spend eternity with you, gave his only son as a sacrifice to cover your sin
[time=2789] so that your imperfections could be covered so he could enjoy relationship with you and so that you could bask in his love and grace and forgiveness and hope.
[time=2799] Believe that, people.
[time=2802] Acknowledge that. Give your life and heart to that.
[time=2807] And when you do, when you live your life for him and not for you,
[time=2813] everything changes.
[time=2818] No circumcision needed. No lists of do's and don'ts.
[time=2823] Now what the Bible teaches and what we'll see unfolding here in the book of Acts is salvation
[time=2829] by grace through faith and faith what alone.
[time=2835] Believe, believe in the gospel.
[time=2839] Let me ask you to bow your heads. If you would, I'm going to ask the folks to come back up.
[time=2843] We're going to end the morning with a great, great proclamation of truth, a great, great opportunity to kind of just express back to him in light of what we've seen this morning.
[time=2856] Just genuine, honest thanks.
[time=2859] And as you sit there this morning with your head, with your head bowed and your eyes closed,
[time=2865] I just want to give you the opportunity to just take a minute and maybe just consider.
[time=2872] We've got some time and I want to give you that.
[time=2875] I want to give you just a couple minutes here before we sing to consider where you stand this morning before him.
[time=2885] What must a person do to be saved?
[time=2888] How have you answered that question?
[time=2891] God's Word gave you the answer this morning.
[time=2893] Believe, believe with all your heart in the gospel and give your life to it.
[time=2902] Maybe that's how you answered that question a few years ago, a few months ago.
[time=2906] And this morning you sit here absolutely basking in what I just said a few minutes ago.
[time=2911] The joy, the hope and the peace, the forgiveness that comes from knowing him.
[time=2918] And if in fact that's you this morning, my prayer is our prayer would be that you would so appreciate that.
[time=2926] That you would hold that, that relationship that you have with him.
[time=2932] That forgiveness that you experienced and continue to experience with him.
[time=2936] That you would hold that so dear and so close to your heart.
[time=2941] That there wouldn't be anything or anybody or any circumstance or situation that could keep you from trying to share that.
[time=2951] Pass that along to others.
[time=2957] Others of you here this morning, you haven't crossed over that bridge.
[time=2963] You haven't drawn that line in the sand to put that stake in the ground that says I believe.
[time=2969] And my belief is not a mental nodding of the head.
[time=2972] You know I believe in my heart, but Jesus is Lord and I commit my life to him.
[time=2981] And you need to, you need to.
[time=2985] And you have the opportunity to do so this morning right here.
[time=2990] And I just want to give you some help. I want to just give you a little nudge.
[time=2993] I'll just give you a little guidance.
[time=2995] Whoever you are, wherever you've been, whatever you've done, whatever your road has looked like, this morning could be for you the chance to simply make it right with him.
[time=3005] And to do so you would just need to do in the quietness of your own heart say this.
[time=3009] And just say, just repeat these words, just quietly in your own heart and soul, just say, "Oh God,
[time=3016] I am so thankful for your love.
[time=3021] And I am so thankful for the sacrifice of your Son that you gave on my behalf.
[time=3030] Oh God, I realize I'm a sinner.
[time=3033] I realize I'm imperfect.
[time=3036] And I want to spend these days and I want to spend eternity, God, with you.
[time=3042] And the only way that's possible I know now is through the forgiveness of my sins made
[time=3050] possible by your Son's death, burial and resurrection.
[time=3059] Oh God, hear my cry this morning.
[time=3062] I love you.
[time=3064] Confess my sin before you.
[time=3067] I ask that your Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, would come into my life giving me the chance
[time=3075] to serve and follow him.
[time=3079] Oh God, teach me.
[time=3081] There is so much to learn.
[time=3083] There is so much to understand and I pray that you would teach me.
[time=3088] Father, thank you for the gift of life and I commit here today to follow and serve you.
[time=3096] And your Son's name I pray.
[time=3100] [AMEN] Well hey, you know of all the songs that we sing around here and I love the songs we sing,
[time=3110] all of them.
[time=3111] One of the ones that just recently I think has just grown to mean more and more to me each time I hear it.
[time=3117] There's the one we're going to sing right now.
[time=3119] I'm going to give you a chance.
[time=3120] Scott will tell you when to jump in, but I hope you'll sing it from your heart.
[time=3125] And I hope that your love for him, whether that's been in existence for years or whether you just prayed that prayer,
[time=3131] would compel you to lift your heart to him today.
[time=3134] Let's worship him together.
[time=3138] I'm forgiven because you were forsaken.
[time=3158] I'm accepted.
[time=3161] You were condemned.
[time=3165] I'm alive and well.
[time=3168] Your spirit is within me because you died and rose again.
[time=3179] Amazing love, how can it be that you, my King, would die for me.
[time=3192] Amazing love, I know it's true.
[time=3199] It's my joy to honor you.
[time=3206] Amazing love, how can it be that you, my King, would die for me.
[time=3219] Amazing love, I know it's true.
[time=3226] It's my joy to honor you in all I do.
[time=3235] I honor you.
[time=3250] I'm forgiven because you were forsaken.
[time=3257] I'm accepted.
[time=3260] You were condemned.
[time=3264] I'm alive and well.
[time=3266] Your spirit is within me because you died and rose again.
[time=3277] Amazing love, how can it be that you, my King, would die for me.
[time=3290] Amazing love, I know it's true.
[time=3297] It's my joy to honor you.
[time=3303] Amazing love, how can it be that you, my King, would die for me.
[time=3316] Amazing love, I know it's true.
[time=3323] It's my joy to honor you in all I do.
[time=3331] I honor you.
[time=3338] You are my King.
[time=3353] Jesus, you are my King.
[time=3362] You are my King.
[time=3369] Amazing love, how can it be that you, my King, would die for me.
[time=3382] Amazing love, I know it's true.
[time=3388] It's my joy to honor you.
[time=3394] Amazing love, how can it be that you, my King, would die for me.
[time=3407] Amazing love, I know it's true.
[time=3414] It's my joy to honor you in all I do.
[time=3422] I honor you.
[time=3434] Why don't we pray, Father, we lift our voices to you and in doing so simply as best we can.
[time=3440] With all of our faults and with all of our weaknesses and with all of our failure and shame, God, we, having heard truth this morning, we lift our voices to you and say, "Oh God, how amazing, how indescribable is your love.
[time=3457] How amazing is your grace that you would go through all that you experienced, all that you went through, all you faced in this week that we now celebrate, that you did it for us and that in doing so made available to us, the life that we now have and share with you, it is amazing.
[time=3476] How could it be?
[time=3478] God, as we go this morning, give us strength and perspective for the week ahead, bring us back together again next week for a mighty celebration of life and promise and hope.
[time=3491] And we'll thank you for all that you'll teach us and show us in these next few days and all the people agreed and said, "Amen."
