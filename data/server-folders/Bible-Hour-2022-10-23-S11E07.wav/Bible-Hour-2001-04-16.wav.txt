[time=0] [THEME MUSIC]
[time=30] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird Pastor here at Blackhawk, and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=38] As the opening just said, "Is there hope?
[time=42] Are there answers?" We realize here at Blackhawk, these are the questions that so many today are asking.
[time=48] The situations that you face, the circumstances that you find yourself in, lead you to ask those very questions, and we're so thankful that we can, on a weekly basis, come into a place like this, open up God's Word, and come to the realization all over again that
[time=64] you know what?
[time=65] There's hope.
[time=66] There really is, and there are answers, and it's real-life stuff.
[time=71] God has not left us to just kind of aimlessly wander through life, no, He has given us direction.
[time=77] He has given us hope, and He has given us answers, and so I'm so thankful.
[time=81] We're so glad that you've joined us in our journey to continue to find out what those answers are, where is the hope, and who is it that He's called us to be.
[time=91] I hope you enjoy your time with us today.
[time=116] And your trumpet will sound, and all the heavens will know, that the time has finally
[time=136] come, for the brighter to take her place, and we'll hear the angels say, Holy, Holy,
[time=156] Holy, Holy is the Lord, Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord, Holy, Holy is the Lord.
[time=183] Holy is the Lord, Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord.
[time=213] Holy is the Lord, Holy is the Lord, Holy is the Lord, Holy is the Lord, Holy, Holy,
[time=213] [REPETITIVE CONTENT - 132 seconds] Holy is the Lord, Holy is the Lord, Holy is the Lord, Holy is the Lord, Holy, Holy,...
[time=364] Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy,
[time=505] Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy,
[time=797] Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy,
[time=810] Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy,
[time=852] Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy,
[time=910] Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy,

[time=1480] Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy,
[time=1627] Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy,
[time=1644] Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy,
[time=1679] Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy,
[time=1703] Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy,
[time=1863] This church had become a mark left by a blow.
[time=1867] It's the picture of a searing, hot, branding iron being placed on the back end of a cow or a horse.
[time=1876] This place had become that very thing.
[time=1878] This church began to have an impact on their world.
[time=1884] Thessalonica, Macedonia, Achaia, their love for God, their commitment to be like him,
[time=1890] to receive the word, even in tribulation led them to be a searing, hot, appropriately so.
[time=1897] Not in a negative sense, but a searing, hot, branding iron on those that they came in contact with.
[time=1903] Paul says, wherever we go, we see your mark.
[time=1907] We see where you've been.
[time=1908] We see what you've done because everywhere you go, you leave an impression.
[time=1913] And I hear that, folks, and I think, man, oh man, that is exactly, that is exactly what I would long for.
[time=1919] I would long for that in your own individual life and in mine as well.
[time=1923] And I would long for that in the life of our church and, you know, to many degrees.
[time=1927] You know, I think it's happening already.
[time=1929] I think about kids last summer, middle school kids, leaving their mark, leaving their impression in Mississippi.
[time=1935] I think about high school kids leaving their impression in Slovakia.
[time=1939] I think about our choir and worship team and others that went with them, leaving their impression, an impression that's being felt still this day in Russia.
[time=1948] I think about many of you on the job and with family and friends leaving your mark on a daily basis.
[time=1956] The question I ask myself, not just of you, but of me too, is what kind of mark are you leaving?
[time=1963] What kind of impression are you making?
[time=1966] What is the message of the brand?
[time=1970] And the thing I love about this point, Tupas, an example, a mark left by a blow.
[time=1976] One of the things I love most about that you guys is the fact that it reminds me and I hope it reminds you this morning that the church, the church doing what the church is supposed to do, being who the church is supposed to be folks, it is not a passive.
[time=1989] It is not a passive existence.
[time=1992] We've been called to action.
[time=1994] We've been called to move. We've been called to do.
[time=1996] We have been called to be a place and a people that leave their mark wherever it is they go.
[time=2002] And so again, you got to ask yourself the question this morning, what kind of mark are you leaving?
[time=2008] Probably should just to make it as personal and I hope to make it as applicable as possible.
[time=2014] You should probably just ask yourself a few more questions as well.
[time=2018] Not just what mark, if any, are you leaving, but what contact?
[time=2022] What contact with an on-looking world are you initiating?
[time=2028] Or are you like some just kind of waiting for the impact that kind of come your way?
[time=2033] I mean, you got your branding iron hot.
[time=2036] You got your truth ready, but you're passive.
[time=2040] And you're just there hoping for a chance maybe to bump in to somebody looking for.
[time=2048] No, no, no. These people went.
[time=2051] These people lived out their faith and as they went, and as you go, and as I go, we have the opportunity.
[time=2057] Having altered our lives, maybe even our schedules.
[time=2061] Having altered our lives and maybe even our schedules, we have opportunity to initiate life-changing
[time=2068] eternity-altering impact.
[time=2071] To leave at Tupas, a mark left by a blow.
[time=2076] Well, the third thing they did, first they were imitators.
[time=2081] Then they were examples, and two kind of plays into three.
[time=2086] Look at verse eight, "For the word of the Lord has sounded forth." It's very similar.
[time=2091] "For the word of the Lord has sounded forth from you, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but watch this.
[time=2097] But also in every place your faith toward God has gone forth, so that we have no need to say anything."
[time=2106] Do you see that?
[time=2108] They were imitators.
[time=2110] He loved that about them.
[time=2111] They were examples.
[time=2112] They left their mark.
[time=2113] And then they just kept going, not just in Macedonia and Achaia, but he says that you sounded forth
[time=2120] is the phrase used there in the NASB.
[time=2123] It may read different in your text.
[time=2126] The phrase "sounded forth" was the blast of a trumpet, the blast of a trumpet, or the clap of thunder.
[time=2135] This is the phrase.
[time=2136] This is the picture used to paint the way these people carried themselves.
[time=2141] The way these people lived their lives, what these people did with the life-changing,
[time=2147] eternity-altering truth that they had embraced.
[time=2150] This is how they handled it.
[time=2152] This is what they did with it.
[time=2153] They became trumpets of hope and peace and forgiveness.
[time=2158] They were like clapping thunder.
[time=2162] It meant so much to them.
[time=2164] Their salvation, their love for, and their commitment to this church of theirs led them to live out
[time=2170] and speak truth into the lives of others.
[time=2175] Is it you?
[time=2177] Is it prompting and prodding and compelling you to do the same?
[time=2182] Are you?
[time=2184] Are you a trumpet?
[time=2185] Are you a clap of thunder in the world that God's placed you in?
[time=2190] Living out and willing to speak truth into the lives of others as you build relationship with and come alongside those that God gives you opportunity to be with.
[time=2199] They couldn't be silenced.
[time=2201] No, they shared the eternity-altering message of Christ, His love and forgiveness everywhere they went, home and abroad, not just in Macedonia and Achaia, but across the then-known world.
[time=2214] And I believe many of you.
[time=2217] I know many of you in this family.
[time=2220] You know, have come to the point where it means so much to you.
[time=2223] And you are so convinced of its merit and its power.
[time=2229] And the fact that God's called you to, you're so convinced of it now, you can't keep your mouth shut.
[time=2234] You live for and look for opportunities to share your faith, build relationships with those still kind of looking in.
[time=2242] You've altered your lives, you've adjusted your schedules.
[time=2244] Many of you in this place, you wake up daily begging and praying God for more opportunities to live life outside the embassy.
[time=2252] In the hopes of having the privilege of bringing one back in.
[time=2258] And that's a good thing.
[time=2261] That is the, that is the sounding forth.
[time=2264] That is the example.
[time=2266] That is the imitation that we see at work in this body, here at Thessalonika.
[time=2273] Some of you this morning aren't quite there yet.
[time=2276] And I would believe in my heart that you'd want to be, that you desire to be, but you're still a little stuck.
[time=2281] Maybe still a little stuck and, and seemingly even trapped in your, kind of in your Christian world.
[time=2288] When right next to you lives a world that's dying for your love and for your affection, for your interest, for your pursuit.
[time=2298] That's what these people did.
[time=2300] They pursued a lost and dying world, not just in Thessalonika, not just in Macedonia, not just in a Kia, but across the world.
[time=2310] And that is an example.
[time=2313] That is a reminder to you.
[time=2315] I hope.
[time=2316] I know it is to me.
[time=2318] Another reason Paul is so proud.
[time=2320] Another reason he lifts them up as examples is found there in verse 9.
[time=2324] They are full fledged, bonafide servants.
[time=2328] They had become servants.
[time=2330] Look at verse 9.
[time=2331] For they themselves, all these people, right?
[time=2333] Paul says we travel everywhere.
[time=2335] And everywhere we go we see your impression.
[time=2339] And everywhere we go we hear from these people who you've impacted.
[time=2344] For they themselves, verse 9, report about us, what kind of a reception we had with you.
[time=2352] And how you turn, here you go, watch this, how you turn to God from idols to serve a living and true God.
[time=2362] Now watch how this works.
[time=2363] What Paul in essence is saying is this.
[time=2365] We hear from others about how you as a church, as individuals and as a body, how you responded to the call of God.
[time=2376] How there was a time when you were walking this way.
[time=2381] And this again is just describing the turning that takes place in the process of salvation.
[time=2386] These people were truly saved.
[time=2388] These people had received the gospel.
[time=2390] Paul says I know it because you were once going this way.
[time=2393] You were living life for you.
[time=2399] You were living life for your portfolio and your stocks and your future possessions.
[time=2404] You were living life for you and for the moment and you were going this way.
[time=2408] And then God did this.
[time=2411] God taps you on the shoulder.
[time=2413] God brings the gospel into your life.
[time=2415] By God's grace and only by His grace you respond.
[time=2419] And it says that you turned to God and now you begin to move and walk in a different direction.
[time=2426] Now you weren't living for you.
[time=2428] Now you have your job and you do what you do and you do it well.
[time=2433] And you have friendships and you have relationships and you have hopes and dreams and aspirations.
[time=2438] And you have a home and a car and all that stuff but now all of it's meaningless.
[time=2442] In comparison to the fact that now what?
[time=2446] They themselves report about us what kind of a reception we had with you and how you turned to God from idols to serve.
[time=2454] See now life for a believer is about one thing and that one thing is serving.
[time=2460] I now don't live my life from my car, house, stock portfolio, future requirements or personal pleasure.
[time=2467] No now I live my life as a believer to serve, to roll up my sleeves, exercise my God-given supernatural gifts that He gave me at the point of salvation.
[time=2479] And this now is my life I serve.
[time=2483] I serve, I give, I offer, I live under subjection to, I am completely and absolutely His.
[time=2489] I once walked this way for these reasons Paul says now we know you walk this way for these reasons.
[time=2497] And that is a great picture of a church that gets it.
[time=2502] These people served.
[time=2505] They gave, they offered, they lived for Him.
[time=2511] True salvation brings true change, not perfection, but a radically different pattern of living and choosing.
[time=2521] They were changed and they're turning to God and the change didn't leave them to sit and soak.
[time=2528] They're turning to God didn't lead to inactivity while they acquired more knowledge.
[time=2533] Well they're turning to God led them to roll up serving sleeves and make a difference in their church, in their town, in their province, in their region, in their world.
[time=2543] And that's what happens when a body gathered gets it.
[time=2549] Truly turns to God away from idols to serve.
[time=2554] It is an amazing thing.
[time=2557] And I hope none of you, I hope none of you, would ever go through life.
[time=2565] Not having the absolute thrill and privilege of experiencing what it's like to give time, talent and treasure and see God use it to help others find and follow.
[time=2575] I hope you would never miss out on the absolute and utter joy of seeing other people realize hope and forgiveness.
[time=2582] Hope you would never go through a day without realizing what it means and what it's like and what it brings.
[time=2587] Not just to you but others when you're willing to forfeit, when you're willing to give, when you're willing to sacrifice, having turned to God for idols to serve Him.
[time=2599] Please, please serve.
[time=2603] Whatever it is you need to, whatever it is that God's uniquely designed you to do, people, please, as a church, serve.
[time=2612] Give up your time appropriately so.
[time=2616] I mean, give up sacrifice wherever you can to serve and make a contribution to this place that is so needed for this place to be what God designed it to be.
[time=2628] These people turn to God for idols and served the Lord.
[time=2633] Last thing I want you to see there, to serve a living and true God, to serve a living and true God.
[time=2640] Don't forget who the object is.
[time=2644] I'm begging you to serve in whatever area you can find.
[time=2648] I mean, we'll help you find a place.
[time=2650] I am begging you to serve.
[time=2651] I'm not begging you to serve because I want you to serve me and I'm not asking you to serve this church.
[time=2655] Don't forget who the object.
[time=2657] Of our servanthood is.
[time=2659] It is Him, a living and true God.
[time=2661] That's what makes it so real.
[time=2666] Fifthly, fifthly they became aliens.
[time=2671] Not space people, no, not monsters from other planets, kids, but aliens, as described here in the New Testament.
[time=2680] Look at verse 10.
[time=2682] He turned to God for idols to serve a living and true God and to wait for His Son from heaven,
[time=2689] whom He raised from the dead.
[time=2691] That is Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come.
[time=2695] They became a people who were willing to wait to live life with heaven, to live life with glory in view.
[time=2707] They were a people, this was a church that was willing to wait.
[time=2712] This was not their home.
[time=2714] And they had become acutely and intensely aware of that.
[time=2719] Their newfound faith had truly transformed them into citizens of heaven.
[time=2726] You know, there's a great example of that.
[time=2729] Some of you may never have seen.
[time=2730] Flip back to, I think it's Hebrews 11.
[time=2737] Yeah, I just want you to read this again.
[time=2739] Or maybe you've never seen it before.
[time=2741] This is a great example of what it means to live life in this world as an alien,
[time=2747] as a citizen of heaven, living in today's world with heaven in mind, with eternity in view,
[time=2753] living life with purpose, living life with direction, true and meaningful direction.
[time=2760] Look what it says in Hebrews 11, I think you want to pick it up in verse 8.
[time=2767] Yeah, verse 8, "By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance,
[time=2775] and he went out not knowing where he was going." If you're feeling certain, not quite sure where your satisfaction will come from,
[time=2786] not quite sure where God's leading you, not quite sure what the future may hold, not knowing where he was going.
[time=2794] Verse 8, "He went out.
[time=2796] By faith he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a foreign land dwelling in key word here, tense.
[time=2804] Not mansions, not homes, not brick and mortar." These folks realized this was not home, and they'd plant their foundation later,
[time=2813] in a place called glory.
[time=2815] They lived in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs of the same promise.
[time=2819] For verse 10, "He was looking for the city which has the foundations whose architect and builder is God."
[time=2827] You see, Abraham here in Hebrews 11, he's waiting for heaven.
[time=2830] He's living with eternity in mind, and he understood what you and I need to understand better and better as the days and weeks go by, folks.
[time=2840] He understood, and these folks back at Thessalonica, that church, they understood that this place really wasn't home.
[time=2850] It really wasn't home anymore, and as a church, they lived with an eternal perspective.
[time=2855] Write down Colossians 1.
[time=2863] Colossians 3, verse 1 says, "If then you have been raised up with Christ, keep seeking the things above where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.
[time=2871] Set your mind, that which you dwell on, that which you plan for, that which you give your mind and soul and body to.
[time=2878] Set your mind on things above, not on the things that are on earth.
[time=2882] For you have died, and your life, it says in verse 3, is hidden with Christ in God.
[time=2888] Colossians 3, 1 through 3.
[time=2893] Here's the point there, folks. Listen carefully.
[time=2896] Colossians 3, 1 to 3, Hebrews 11, verse 8 and following.
[time=2902] 1 Thessalonians 1, verse 10.
[time=2905] All of it, all of it is a call, and all of it reminds you, and it reminds me this morning, that we are, too, in our day-to-day life, value what's really valuable.
[time=2918] Value what's really valuable.
[time=2920] Make room in your life for that which matters most.
[time=2926] Invest in that which is eternal, give your time, give your talent, and all of the treasure possible to him.
[time=2934] These people at Thessalonica, this church, they were so deeply committed
[time=2940] to him and to heaven, because nothing else could satisfy.
[time=2947] Now that you've got to ask yourself about, and I'll be honest with you, okay?
[time=2953] I always am.
[time=2955] That was a hard one for me this week.
[time=2959] Because there's a lot of things out there in your world and mine.
[time=2963] There's a lot of things that to me at times feels like they satisfy.
[time=2972] There's so much stuff out there in this world.
[time=2976] And all of it's distraction.
[time=2978] You know, all of it in the end kind of has the capacity because of where it comes from, the kind of take me away from that which really matters.
[time=2987] Use me away at times from valuing that which is truly valuable.
[time=2993] Because in my mind and in my sinful heart, I sometimes give in when the enemy says,
[time=2999] "Hey, you know what?
[time=3000] Waiting?
[time=3001] Faithfulness?
[time=3004] Endurance?
[time=3005] You know, doing what's right?" And when the enemy's there whispering in my ear like he whispers in yours, "Hey, here's satisfaction right here.
[time=3016] You can touch it.
[time=3017] You can feel it.
[time=3019] I mean, whatever it is, right?
[time=3020] You can eat it.
[time=3022] It's a hard one for me.
[time=3025] And I'll admit to you this morning, I'm still working on that.
[time=3028] I sometimes don't feel like an alien.
[time=3030] I sometimes don't feel like a stranger in a foreign land.
[time=3033] No, sometimes I really like this place.
[time=3037] Anybody identify with that?
[time=3041] So I got a ways to go.
[time=3044] These people were an example of a church that finally got it.
[time=3053] And what I don't want for you and what I don't want for me is what I heard a missionary
[time=3060] tell me one time about where was he?
[time=3065] They were from Kenya, I think.
[time=3068] This was a few years ago.
[time=3069] And I may have even told you this before, but let me tell you it again.
[time=3073] I don't want to be like the monkeys in this one spot in Kenya where they had overrun
[time=3081] a village and the way the natives would in that province or that area, the way they would
[time=3089] hunt and get rid of the monkeys was amazing.
[time=3093] The monkeys were completely and absolutely fanatical about this certain kind of food
[time=3102] that the women in this village oftentimes would bake.
[time=3107] And so what they would do is they would make these specialized pots.
[time=3113] They would literally, the pottery wheel going and they'd make these specialized vases.
[time=3119] And they would put this food, this special food that these monkeys just loved in the
[time=3125] vases.
[time=3126] And they designed the vases a certain way.
[time=3129] They specifically designed and made these vases to have an opening that was big enough for
[time=3135] a monkey's hand to reach into, relaxed.
[time=3139] But as soon as the monkey would make a fist and grab the prize and try to pull it out,
[time=3147] the fist wouldn't come out.
[time=3150] It would be too big and they'd be stuck.
[time=3154] True story.
[time=3155] So all over this province they would hang these vases, these pottery vases in trees with the
[time=3162] food inside and the monkeys came by the hundreds.
[time=3165] And they would climb the tree at night and they would reach their greedy little hands inside these vases, grab ahold of the food and not be able to get it out.
[time=3178] And here's the amazing thing.
[time=3179] In the morning, the warriors, the guys from the different villages would get their clubs,
[time=3186] their sticks, and like clockwork, they'd get up in the morning and there the monkeys would be in the trees.
[time=3194] And they wouldn't run away.
[time=3197] They wouldn't drop the food.
[time=3198] See, they were so committed to having it now.
[time=3201] They were so committed to that satisfaction, so committed to that place.
[time=3206] They were not going to let go of the food.
[time=3210] And the villagers climbed the trees and beat them to death, dead.
[time=3215] No more monkeys.
[time=3219] People this world will club you to death.
[time=3225] Don't listen to the lie.
[time=3226] Don't for a second forget this world so much of what it offers and so much of what draws
[time=3236] me and you into its, you know, into its stuff, so much of that will beat you to death.
[time=3243] You will lose unless you and I are willing with regard to this place and all that it offers
[time=3251] unless you and I are willing to do what?
[time=3256] Let it go.
[time=3260] Because when you let it go and when I let it go, we get our hands out of the jar.
[time=3265] We begin to think clearly again, my goodness, what was I thinking?
[time=3270] I almost got beat.
[time=3273] That's how they lived.
[time=3280] And I hope it's how we could live.
[time=3282] I really do.
[time=3283] I want to just give you a minute here to look with me at our vision statement.
[time=3287] We believe folks that these four Es, all of them, come right out of the pages of God's Word.
[time=3293] All of what you see here on this page that says vision statement would come right out of first Thessalonians.
[time=3299] And I want to draw your attention to those four Es, evangelism, encouragement, equipping,
[time=3305] exaltation, evangelism.
[time=3309] We've got symbols around this place that deal with evangelism.
[time=3312] It would be the hands.
[time=3314] Right here, you see these hands.
[time=3315] We've talked about that before, your willingness in mind to extend a hand in an effort to speak
[time=3321] and live out truth in the life of others.
[time=3324] And oftentimes that handshake, which represents a relationship, gives you the opportunity and gives me the chance to also speak truth, to ask questions, to have conversations that really matter.
[time=3336] And our hope is that you are willing to be, maybe have been or would open to be, being trained, encouraged, and helped in that process as you read those bullets underneath evangelism.
[time=3346] Encouragement.
[time=3347] You see the picture here of the three guys standing in a circle because we believe whole heartedly, and without apology, that there is value, great value to living life together,
[time=3359] intimately and honestly, before God and each other.
[time=3363] And as you see, under encouragement, there are some things that we as a church want to be given to, in our commitment to live life together.
[time=3372] We call it community.
[time=3374] We also feel like there's great value in being trained and being taught, in understanding better what God's word says, and oftentimes that takes place as we gather as a church.
[time=3384] But not only do you get taught, but then, as we've already talked about this morning, you have a chance to then teach others, passing along that which has been invested in you.
[time=3394] And there are so many opportunities within the church for equipping to take place, learning, applying, discovering gifts, and exaltation, excuse me.
[time=3403] The thumbprint.
[time=3404] Don't want to miss that.
[time=3405] Actually, one of my favorite symbols that we have.
[time=3407] That reminds you, and that reminds me, but there's a piece in this puzzle, every single one of you, unique print.
[time=3416] There's a place in this puzzle that every single one of you can fit as you give yourself
[time=3422] to serving, and then the heart representing exaltation.
[time=3427] Because he is God, we seek to worship him in spirit and in truth.
[time=3430] We want to develop deeper, fuller relationships with our God, leading to things like repentance,
[time=3436] gratitude, and intentional ways of living.
[time=3439] These things happen when hearts are truly changed.
[time=3443] Well, let me if I can take you back to the beginning of the Bible hour today.
[time=3449] You saw some questions that came on the screen.
[time=3451] Is there hope?
[time=3453] Are there really answers?
[time=3455] And I just want to remind you again that we believe there is hope, and we know for a fact that there are answers.
[time=3461] And we would love nothing more than to if we could help you, encourage you and come alongside you as you discover, maybe for the first time where that hope is found and where those
[time=3472] answers lie.
[time=3473] So please call us, write us, come by on a Sunday and visit us.
[time=3477] We'd love to meet you and help you understand better the hope and the answers found in our Lord Jesus Christ.
