[time=18] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird Pastor here at Blackhawk, and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=37] As the opening just said, "Is there hope?
[time=41] Are there answers?" We realize here at Blackhawk, these are the questions that so many today are asking.
[time=48] The situations that you face, the circumstances that you find yourself in, lead you to ask those very questions, and we're so thankful that we can, on a weekly basis, come into a place like this, open up God's Word, and come to the realization all over again that
[time=64] you know what?
[time=65] There's hope.
[time=66] There really is, and there are answers, and it's real-life stuff.
[time=70] God has not left us to just kind of aimlessly wander through life, no, He has given us direction.
[time=76] He has given us hope, and He has given us answers, and so I'm so thankful.
[time=81] We're so glad that you've joined us in our journey to continue to find out what those answers are, where is the hope, and who is it that He's called us to be.
[time=90] I hope you enjoy your time with us today.
[time=106] And it's before Him, and it goes way back down the line, they had a vision, a prayer
[time=124] for the future, for what I would believe in time.
[time=134] Now I'm not perfect, life's not easy, but I wouldn't take the world for what they gave
[time=149] to me.
[time=150] I'm living the legacy, walking the path that the faithful have laid down.
[time=158] I'm living the legacy.
[time=159] I'm living the legacy, riding the hope that my father's found.
[time=168] I am standing tall, when I hold my knees, I'm living the legacy.
[time=186] Something common deep inside me, goes before me, who I love, gives me the vision, who fills
[time=205] me with a passion, to make the message carry on.
[time=216] Now I'm not perfect, life's not easy, but for the future's sake, I'm gonna do the best
[time=232] I can.
[time=233] I'm living the legacy, walking the path that the faithful have laid down.
[time=241] I'm living the legacy, riding the thing that my father's found.
[time=249] I am standing tall, when I hold my knees, I'm living the legacy, I'm living the legacy,
[time=268] walking the path that the faithful have laid down.
[time=273] I'm living the legacy, riding the hope that my father's found.
[time=281] I am standing tall, when I hold my knees, I'm living the legacy.
[time=294] It's my pleasure and privilege this morning to introduce our guest speaker, Ron Williams
[time=318] from Fellowship Missionary Church here in the south side of Fort Wayne.
[time=323] Ron and I had the opportunity to serve together in ministry at Fellowship Missionary for four
[time=329] and a half years, and during that time I just came to respect and appreciate the incredible
[time=337] heart that he has for the Lord and for people.
[time=342] Ron and his wife Laura have one little guy, Dawson, he's 19 months old, and they have
[time=350] learned a lot about parenting in that short time, and they're thankful for that little guy, and we're thankful for Ron, and we hope that today your heart will be challenged by
[time=361] some of the things Ron's going to share with us.
[time=365] Before Ron Williams comes, though, I'm going to ask one of our own Ron Parrish to come at this time, Ron serves with us in children's ministry, and he's going to share with you
[time=376] now, just briefly, some things from his heart, how God has been at work in his life.
[time=381] Ron.
[time=382] Good morning.
[time=384] Scott mentioned something about the president here a minute ago, and I always wanted to ask this question, and you can raise your hand.
[time=391] How many of you here know who the president of the United States is, who our president is?
[time=396] Now how many of you keep them up, keep your hands up, and how many of you have met him?
[time=403] Yeah.
[time=404] I drive a concrete truck for a living, so I'm at the beginning of all stages of construction.
[time=410] I see the foundations put under everything that's built, and all new foundation, and there's one kind of construction that we do, where they take the old foundation out from underneath the house, and they put in a new foundation underneath that, and as I tell you a little bit about my life, the second part that I said kind of represents my life.
[time=433] The foundation under my life was this, as I grew up, was went to church, did all the
[time=440] traditional things in church.
[time=442] I got baptized as an infant.
[time=444] I went to communion.
[time=445] I was confirmed.
[time=447] I thought I was right with God through all those events, and as I grew up, our family
[time=454] life, we went to church on Sundays, and Sunday night my father used to work my mother over
[time=461] pretty good physically and emotionally, very abusive, because see, he drank very heavily.
[time=469] And that was pretty much the foundation of my life, and as those elementary school years went by and I watched this violence in my life, my heart began to close and become hard toward
[time=480] my father.
[time=481] And I never heard him tell me, "Love me," and I can count on this hand how many times he said it, and I can put just about every one of those fingers down.
[time=490] And so my heart was getting really hard all those years, and at age 13, my mother took
[time=496] her own life, because she couldn't take the abuse anymore.
[time=500] And when that happened, my heart got real hard, and I made up my mind, I was never going to ask my father for another thing in my life.
[time=507] And at 13, I went to work, I was taking care of two younger sisters, he worked a 4-12 shift,
[time=515] and so I washed clothes and I cooked, and I took care of family members.
[time=518] I became an adult at 13, and I grew up responsible, and I grew up in charge of my life.
[time=527] And as time went on, I made it through those years, and I didn't see any point in going to church, because I was already right with God because of all the stuff I did, and church
[time=537] is a youngster, and I thought, "I'm a good person."
[time=545] I wasn't a Billy Graham or Mother Teresa, but I wasn't a Jack the Ripper either.
[time=551] And so as life went on, I grew up and I built my house based on the only foundation that I was shown as a child, and I got married, and it wasn't long before that marriage fell apart, and I got to watch my two children from that marriage get their hearts ripped
[time=567] out, and their hearts started to harden as a result.
[time=571] And a couple years later, I met my wife that I'm married to now, and it wasn't long before that marriage deteriorated to the point of separation.
[time=582] And about it, six months previous to that, somebody had came over that was in a stated depression, and I was being a sounding board, and they came over one night, all excited, and the only thing they said is, "I gave my life to Christ," and I turned it all over
[time=596] to Him, and I thought, "Well, good," I thought to myself, "That's good, I don't need that."
[time=602] God never loved me enough to help me all those years that I asked Him for help and to get me out of those situations.
[time=610] And now, three weeks into the separation of my wife, I did the hardest thing, I had done
[time=618] a lot of hard things in my life, but the hardest thing I ever did was that night.
[time=622] I started comparing my life to that of Christ, and I finally had had to admit that I wasn't
[time=631] a good person, and that I needed help, and that I had made a mess out of things.
[time=639] And for the first time, the hardest thing I did was open my heart to Him and say, "I
[time=646] need you, and I need you to be leader and guide her and control her over my life."
[time=653] And I opened that harden heart, and I let His love in, because with that fist you couldn't put anything in, and you can't get anything out of a closed heart.
[time=662] And He came into my life, and He started to change my life, and through prayer and circumstances
[time=669] and some situations, my marriage came back together.
[time=673] And I started reading the Bible, and I prayed, and I came to know Blackhawk as my church
[time=679] home.
[time=680] And as I read the Bible, there was something I thought really interesting in there.
[time=685] I read the greatest commandment that Jesus ever told to religious leaders when they asked Him, "What's the greatest commandment?" He said, "To love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and love your neighbor as yourself." And He put them in that order, and that wasn't hard for me to understand, because without loving Him first, you can't love anybody else with the kind of love that He wants you
[time=709] to love them with.
[time=710] And it all becomes, to the point of getting to know Him, how do you love Him, and you love
[time=717] Him by going to His Son that He gave as a bridge to us.
[time=726] He is the doorway, He is the key.
[time=730] And you go to Him, and you ask Jesus for forgiveness, and you relinquish control of your life to
[time=736] Him.
[time=737] And of all the things I want to leave my children with that day that I put this foundation under their life is that I do love the Lord my God with all my heart, my soul, and my mind.
[time=747] And that Jesus is the answer, not only to an eternity in heaven, but to a real relationship
[time=753] that you can have with the God of the universe why you're alive here and live out, your His
[time=759] purpose in your life today and why you're alive, and adds a whole other dimension to
[time=765] living.
[time=778] Good morning.
[time=779] It's so good to be here today to be able to worship with you folks.
[time=783] We live about two blocks from this place, drive by it every day, and it's good for us just to come in and just kind of be a part of the neighborhood today.
[time=790] It's kind of a nice thing.
[time=792] When Ellen Thompson about 40 years ago left the Navy, Bob took $3,500 of cash he had with
[time=799] him.
[time=800] They moved up to Upper Michigan, and they started a family asphalt business.
[time=804] That was 40 years ago, $3,500.
[time=810] Two years ago, Bob sold his family business for $400 million.
[time=815] Ellen said, "I had no idea that we would ever make that much money in all of our life.
[time=820] What were we going to do with $400 million?" They didn't have a close to what they were going to do with $400 million, so they began to think about it, and they decided they would leave a legacy of giving behind is what they would do.
[time=830] Bob and Ellen took $125 million, and they paid the taxes on $125 million.
[time=837] All the employees of the business found out that Bob had sold the business, they were told that on Friday they were going to receive a note in their mailbox, and so they assumed that on that good Friday, that particular Friday, they would walk in and they would open up their mailbox, and they would find a note, just simply a pink slip saying, "Business is sold, you're out of a job." That's not what happened.
[time=856] Folks walked to their mailbox, they opened up that mailbox, and they pulled out a little note, and they were told that they were just made instant millionaires by Bob Thompson.
[time=867] Folks had retired widows and widowers of those that had retired of people that had served Bob faithfully, who had left the business without any form of retirement alone, opened up their mail on that particular day, and found out that some of them were made multi-millionaires.
[time=882] Wouldn't you have loved to have worked for Bob Thompson?
[time=887] I've decided to become friends with Bob.
[time=889] I'm going to write him letters, I'm going to send him pictures of my son, you know?
[time=894] I mean, come on, who could resist a face like that, or maybe a face like that?
[time=900] I mean, no one could resist a face like that.
[time=904] I don't know about Bob and Ellen, but I don't know if they're Christians, I don't know where their faith stands, but there's one thing that's certain this morning.
[time=912] We certainly know where their heart is at.
[time=915] In relationship to their stuff, we know where their heart really is at.
[time=920] A few weeks ago when Jim Pearson was with you, he talked about your stuff, the fact that
[time=926] your stuff is really not your stuff at all, it's all God's stuff, and it really is, it's all God's stuff.
[time=930] I think every so often we need to remind ourselves that it's not our stuff, it's God's stuff.
[time=934] Let's do me a favor, turn to the person that next to you and say it's not my stuff, good.
[time=944] Be confident, it's not my stuff.
[time=946] Now, do me another favor, kind of work with me here for a minute.
[time=949] Take your wallets out, will you?
[time=951] Just take your wallets out, just work with me, I'll take mine out.
[time=955] Come on Steve, get it out, take out your wallets, I want you to hand it to the person sitting next to you.
[time=962] Come on, work with me here, hand it to the person sitting next to you.
[time=967] Now look at them and tell them it's not my stuff.
[time=971] Okay, now let's take an offering and I want you to give like you've always wanted to give.
[time=981] Well this morning I want to talk to you about this idea of leaving a legacy behind.
[time=987] Not the kind that Bob and Allen left, most of us in this room will never be able to leave such a legacy behind, but there's one legacy that we can all leave behind.
[time=995] There's one legacy that we should all work hard at leaving behind because every child of God we all have a legacy and I want to talk to you this morning about building and leaving a legacy of love behind.
[time=1008] Because one of the primary ways of God that reveals the truth about God, especially the people who don't know God, is when the people of God demonstrate in authentic ways the love of God.
[time=1018] And the truth is that we live in a post-Christian world, we really do.
[time=1024] We come in contact with folks every day in the marketplace, within our jobs, within our
[time=1030] schools, who are completely biblically illiterate to Scripture.
[time=1035] They have no clue.
[time=1036] They don't know the stories of God, they don't know really about God, they don't know about
[time=1042] His love, they don't know about His grace that Ron was talking about here a few minutes ago, they're biblically illiterate to the things about God.
[time=1049] Now we live in a very spiritual world, there's no doubt about it.
[time=1052] People are very much tuned in to spirituality, their own spirituality, but just because we live in the spiritual world does not mean that people have a knowledge of our God, of
[time=1063] our Christ, no knowledge whatsoever.
[time=1069] And in many ways this truth, such a truth, is one generation away from becoming lost in the mesh of spirituality and all this God-God-talk.
[time=1077] It happened once before and it can happen again.
[time=1081] Take your Bibles, turn to Judges chapter 2 real quick.
[time=1085] The Israelites had experienced tremendous prosperity, God had led them out of slavery and He had led them into the Promised Land and He had provided faithful leaders in Moses and in Aaron, Caleb and Joshua, we all know the story, those of us that know the story.
[time=1101] And it appeared that the people live daily in the reality of God's power and God's presence and His love for them.
[time=1107] I mean that seemed to be the daily regiment, as a matter of fact, on a daily basis, a good Jew would just simply recite this verse.
[time=1117] Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.
[time=1122] On a daily basis they would recite that verse.
[time=1125] Now say it with me, love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul
[time=1131] and with all your strength.
[time=1132] Every day they would say that verse.
[time=1135] But something happened, something happened because Joshua and the great leaders then began to pass on and leadership soon faded away and the stories of God rescuing the people
[time=1146] simply became kind of family reunion stories.
[time=1149] Some were out of the distance, God did this for our people.
[time=1154] But in intimate knowledge for who God was, it was soon lost and intimate knowledge for who God was.
[time=1161] And in Judges 210, this verse drives home the point.
[time=1166] After the whole generation had been gathered to their fathers, another generation grew up who neither knew the Lord nor knew what He had done for Israel.
[time=1176] Now you need to know what this text is not saying.
[time=1180] It is not saying the people forgot about God.
[time=1183] The people had a head knowledge of God.
[time=1186] They knew about God, they heard the stories of how God had rescued them.
[time=1190] They knew about God, about the God who brought them out of bondage and in the land of freedom and into prosperity.
[time=1196] They had a knowledge of God but they did not know God.
[time=1202] There was no intimate connection with God, none whatsoever.
[time=1205] They had no clue as to what it meant to love God with all their heart and with all their soul and with all their strength.
[time=1210] And the legacy that their fathers left behind, it was all head knowledge, it was there was no heart knowledge involved here.
[time=1217] And in many ways what their fathers did is their fathers failed in giving them the greatest gift that anyone can give another.
[time=1226] And the greatest gift, the greatest legacy that you can leave behind is the legacy of your intimacy with God.
[time=1235] An intimacy which kind of leaks its way out of your life and impacts the life of another.
[time=1244] Because one of the primary ways of God that reveals the truth about God, especially to people who don't know God, is when the people of God demonstrate in authentic ways the love of God.
[time=1256] So how is such love captured?
[time=1259] Well, Paul kind of drives home this truth, flip to Philippians chapter 1.
[time=1267] Philippians Paul is attempting to get the church in Philippi in tune with this idea of
[time=1273] how they can really leave a legacy and what his prayer is for their people.
[time=1278] He kind of writes this little prayer to them and this is where we're going to hang out for the next few minutes.
[time=1282] It's right here in Philippians 1, just verse 9.
[time=1287] It says, "And this is my prayer that your love may abound more and more in knowledge.
[time=1292] If you underline your scriptures, I'd encourage you to underline that word knowledge and depth of insight.
[time=1296] You may want to underline depth of insight so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless until the day of Christ.
[time=1304] Filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of our God." Now, what is Paul trying to tell us here?
[time=1312] And this is my prayer, that your love, that your love may abound more and more in knowledge,
[time=1319] in knowledge.
[time=1320] The first thing that Paul would tell us, the first thing that we need to know about this whole idea of leaving a lasting legacy behind is that we need to love God completely.
[time=1329] It's about loving God completely.
[time=1331] When he talks about this word knowledge, it's true truth.
[time=1335] To know God, in an intimate way, as Adam knew Eve, to know God in that intimate fashion.
[time=1344] Paul would say, "It's my prayer to know Christ, to know of Christ." What Paul writes here is that his prayer is that your relationship with God would somehow move from your head and make its way down right about here to your heart.
[time=1359] That your head knowledge would become intimate heart knowledge and an impassioned understanding for a love of people would just somehow leak from your life.
[time=1367] You know, Dallas Willard said it well, he said, "Our highest calling in opportunity in life is to love him with all your being."
[time=1377] And the greatest gift that you can give another is your intimacy with God.
[time=1384] This passionate relationship that every one of us in this room today should have for God.
[time=1393] That somehow when we engage with God, we realize that in the midst of our worship experiences,
[time=1399] like what you had today, that there's something that takes place inside of your heart and it just has to make its way out of your life and into the life of another.
[time=1410] That God desires that kind of an intimacy.
[time=1414] He longs for that kind of an intimacy with you.
[time=1416] That you would know him completely, that you would know him completely, that he desires
[time=1422] your intimacy.
[time=1423] You know, that song, that was sung a few minutes ago, that Kevin led the choir in, he knows
[time=1429] my name.
[time=1430] I said that I thought, he knows my name.
[time=1436] He knows my name.
[time=1439] Jeremiah, one says that, "Before I formed you in your mother's womb, I knew you."
[time=1450] I don't know what that does to you, but I know what it does to me.
[time=1454] I know there's this sense of sitting back and thinking, God, God of the universe who
[time=1460] put the stars in place, kind of created this incredible earth that as Psalms 8 says, that
[time=1468] you're mindful of me, that God, he is mindful of me.
[time=1472] He knows my name.
[time=1474] He desires an intimate relationship with me, that we would connect with him as sons and
[time=1480] daughters to an incredible loving father.
[time=1484] Last year, in the midst of ministry and kind of missing family and missing the connections and you know, our little guy Dawson was, you know, your dads can resonate with me on this thing, that when your kids are really small and we're just learning about this, that for some reason, all they really know is their mother.
[time=1501] They know her by name, mama, you know, they get that down really quick.
[time=1507] And as dads, we go through an identity crisis, because you come home from work and you walk in and you want the little guy to say, "Dad, Dad," he wasn't saying, "Dad, Dad," you know, he wasn't, we just weren't quite connected yet, you know, father to son.
[time=1522] And so I can remember last November, we decided to get away for a couple of weeks and so we headed down to South Carolina for a couple of weeks and found a condo on a beach.
[time=1531] We realized at the end of Thanksgiving why condos on beaches in South Carolina are so cheap, because it's so cold.
[time=1536] You don't want to spend much time on the beach in South Carolina at the end of November.
[time=1541] But every day, every day, I would spend time with Dawson, get up in the morning and we would play together and we would go off to the beach together and we would go on runs together, a little jogger stroller, you know, so I'd take him on runs together and there came that moment, there came that moment when Dawson realized, "I exist too." And finally came the word that I had been waiting to hear for months, "Dad, Dad."
[time=1564] It was great, "Dad, Dad, Dad." It was great.
[time=1569] After two weeks, we drove all the way back home, you know, and got home just exhausted the evening we got, we finally arrived home and I'm laying in bed and we're sleeping just as sound as we could sleep, you know, and all at once about two o'clock in the morning, I hear this sound coming from Dawson's room going, "Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad." And it wasn't a "Dad, I'm afraid," or "Dad, come on, Dad, let's play it together." "Dad, Dad." I punched Laura, I said, "You might want to go see what he wants, I've just wiped out right now, you know, just too tired." I said there and I thought about that and I thought, you know, this whole idea of loving God completely, intimately, is the fact that sometimes I think God tells us, "Just
[time=1611] call out my name, just spend time with me, loving me completely.
[time=1621] I'm calling you by name, call out to me by name."
[time=1627] You know, my hope is that one of the legacies that I leave behind is that somehow I long
[time=1633] to be in the presence of the Father, that in some vicarious manner, my son and those
[time=1640] around will be touched by the intimate relationship that I have with God.
[time=1643] That's what I hope, that I want others to have known as much of me as possible to know,
[time=1649] but I want them to have my heart and I want them to meet God there at my heart.
[time=1655] So, dads, moms, Blackhawk, you need to know, you need to know this morning, that your kids
[time=1667] will not inherit your faith by just natural succession.
[time=1671] You've got to train them in it.
[time=1674] And you know that.
[time=1675] You need to live it before them, but it's not found in the simple list of do's and don'ts.
[time=1679] Your kids will discover the reality of Christ living through you, that somehow you have got to keep Christ alive before them, as well as before those that you're spending time
[time=1690] with who are just simply in seeking mode, that those who are seeking will somehow be impacted,
[time=1696] by the way in which you love God completely, by your intimacy with God.
[time=1702] By living out your relationship with God before others, that will draw them into the presence and give them a longing inside their hearts for a presence of who God is.
[time=1712] It's found out and kind of discovered and seen by how you forgive your partner, how
[time=1720] you forgive your spouse, how you forgive those in this place, in the midst of your community,
[time=1735] how you forgive others.
[time=1738] It's discovered by how you love your spouse.
[time=1742] Your kids see how you love your spouse and somehow it makes its way into their life.
[time=1748] How you overcome temptation to quit, what your responses to storms and crisis, how you deal with failure and success, how you love God.
[time=1756] It all works its way out of your life and into the life of another.
[time=1759] Gordon McDonald said it well.
[time=1760] He said, "I have this passionate desire that when I have opened my soul and displayed all of its furniture, there will have been something that helps a few people in the next generation find God." So others need to see the truth of the word transform your heart and life and they need to see you loving God, but understand this.
[time=1780] It's not how much you're getting into the word, it's how much of the word is getting into you.
[time=1788] That's where the transformation really takes place because the more you know God, this is what Paul's saying, the more you know God, the greater your love for others will
[time=1798] be because one of the primary ways of God that reveals the truth about God, especially the people who don't know God is when the people of God demonstrate in authentic ways the love of God.
[time=1810] Paul goes on and he says, "And this is my prayer, that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight." Some of you have the word discernment in there.
[time=1818] The second thing Paul tells us here and the second thing I want us to focus in on is this whole idea of loving ourselves appropriately.
[time=1825] The word depth of insight or discernment is a significant phrase, it's the only time this phrase is used throughout all of Scripture and it speaks about moral perception.
[time=1835] What Paul is saying to us today is that nothing is truly known until it's passed over into obedience.
[time=1841] Eugene Peterson, he kind of pins it this way, said, "So this is my prayer, that your love will flourish and that you will not only love much, but well, learn to love appropriately.
[time=1850] You need to use your head and test your feelings so that your love is sincere and intelligent, that sentimental gush, live a lover's life, circumspect an exemplary.
[time=1859] A life Jesus would be proud of, bountiful and fruits from the soul, making Jesus attractive
[time=1866] to all." So how do you love yourself appropriately?
[time=1870] By loving what God loves.
[time=1875] By allowing the knowledge of the word of God to somehow transform your life, to somehow shape your character.
[time=1881] You know, Blackhawk, you have a reputation for having incredible knowledge about Scripture.
[time=1888] You really know your stuff.
[time=1889] Matter of fact, when Kelly called and asked if I would speak here on Sunday morning, I took a just kind of swall, just swall.
[time=1898] Those people are smart over there, you know, I don't know about this.
[time=1904] Kind of felt like there was a time when Einstein was out on this tour and he's on this lecture
[time=1910] tour and he's lecturing from city to city, non-stop tour, lecturing city to city to city, city to city, city to city, and he had this one chauffeur that was with him the entire time.
[time=1918] The chauffeur would come in and he would sit and he would listen to all of Einstein's lectures and the one lecture that he listened to, just one lecture, listen to that lecture all the time, sit in the back of the auditorium, just listen to that lecture the whole time.
[time=1928] Finally, after a period of days, this guy got the entire lecture down pat.
[time=1934] He and Einstein were driving and he told Einstein, he says, "You know, I know your lecture verbatim," and he said, "You do," and he said, "Why don't you give it to me, we've got some time." So he gave the entire lecture, Einstein said, "I got a great idea." The deal is we just go in and I just give my lecture and we leave, no one really knows what I look like.
[time=1950] So the next time we, the next stop, why don't you give the lecture and I'll sit in the back of the auditorium and I'll just be the chauffeur for the night.
[time=1959] The guy said, "Okay." So I was like, "Good idea." So he gets in that night, comes down, they introduce Einstein, up walks the chauffeur, you know, nobody knows, not chauffeur, Einstein, don't really care much.
[time=1969] He gives the entire lecture verbatim, down with the lecture, applause goes on.
[time=1973] All I want is to host to that particular lecture, kind of throw something in, he grabs the chauffeur, pulls him over and he says, "You know what?" He said, "Tonight, I've decided that we would have an open question and answer time for Einstein.
[time=1983] Ask whatever you want." Some guy stood up in the back and he gave this question on quantum physics.
[time=1989] chauffeur stood there and scratched his chin for a minute, looked back, saw Einstein in the back and he says, "You know what?
[time=1993] That's such an easy question.
[time=1994] I think I'll let my chauffeur answer it."
[time=2001] Understand this, in all of your smartness, it is not again how much you're getting into
[time=2008] the word, it's how much the word is getting into you.
[time=2013] You know, we live in a culture that rewards the externals rather than the internals.
[time=2018] Gary Thomas writes, he said, "The life Christ wants to grow in you is not founded on a list of do's and don'ts and it cannot be accurately measured by our current yardsticks of spiritual performance standards.
[time=2029] By how much you do or do not witness or read your Bible or attend church and it is more definitely not a life of striving as you compare yourself to someone else, it is the slow dawning of the life and characteristics of Jesus Christ who lives in you and wants to grow more evident in you.
[time=2044] It is the slow dawning of the life and characteristics of Jesus Christ who lives in you and who
[time=2051] wants to grow more evident in you.
[time=2055] You build a legacy every day, every day you build a legacy by what others see in you.
[time=2068] Every day how you treat and love others, how you handle the ethics in your office, how you live your life both in public as well as in private, how you deal with your kids and the issues of integrity, you build that legacy.
[time=2083] Gordon McDonald in his book When Men Think Private Thoughts retells a true story about a New York architect by the name of James Lofinsky.
[time=2093] When Lofinsky was 11 years old his dad would take him up to the cabin up in New Hampshire and they would head out onto the little pier in front of their cabin and they would fish for perch at night.
[time=2105] On a particular evening it was the day before bass season would open.
[time=2110] Lofinsky was writing that he had his pull out there in the water and all at once that pull went limp and it began to bend over and he knew there was something incredibly big on the other end of that line.
[time=2120] He had no idea what it was.
[time=2121] It was 10 o'clock at night.
[time=2124] Finally got that fish back on that pier and he looked down and it was the biggest large mouth bass he had ever seen in his life.
[time=2132] The biggest bass he was convinced he would ever catch in his life.
[time=2137] He looked at his dad and for some people there would have been a moment to start kind of
[time=2143] fiddling with the truth but this father didn't fiddle whatsoever.
[time=2146] He looked at his watch, it was 10 o'clock in the evening.
[time=2148] Bass season didn't begin until 1201 and he said, "Son, you got to put the fish back."
[time=2157] Lofinsky thought, "But dad, this is the biggest bass I'm probably ever going to catch in my entire life." Put the fish back.
[time=2168] Lofinsky retells how he took that fish off that hook and put it back on the water and walked away thinking, "I am never going to catch a fish that big again for the rest of mine.
[time=2177] I just know it." He goes on and he writes this, "No matter how strongly the boy protested the father insisted that fish be thrown back in the lake, one could not blame the boy if he looked around to see if there was anyone watching them, if there was anyone taking note of this decision and there wasn't.
[time=2191] Still, the father was unmoved.
[time=2193] There was a law and corresponding principle of compliance and operation the fish had to be thrown back and back it went.
[time=2199] With an unhappy boy saying repeatedly that he would never see a fish that big again.
[time=2203] Could you just imagine your kids going, "Dad, I'll never see a fish that big again the rest of my life.
[time=2209] Come on." That was 34 years ago.
[time=2213] Lofinsky writes this, he said, "The cabin is still there and today he takes his own children to the same dock where he and his father once fished.
[time=2220] Through all these years the truth is that he never had caught a fish close to the size of that one that hit his line that night so long ago.
[time=2226] On the other hand, Lofinsky says, "He has seen other kinds of fish, the kind that rise to the bait when there is a question of ethics in one's adult business life." The man who once threw a huge bass back asks, "Do we do right when no one is looking?
[time=2241] Do we refuse to cut corners to get the design in on time or refuse to trade stocks based on information that we know we aren't supposed to have?
[time=2248] We would," he answers.
[time=2250] If we were taught to put the fish back when we were young, for we would have learned the truth.
[time=2256] The decision to do right lives fresh and fragrant in our memory.
[time=2259] It is a story we will proudly tell our friends and grandchildren.
[time=2262] Now, not about how we had a chance to beat the system and took it, but how we did the right thing and were forever strengthened.
[time=2270] Lofinsky's father left a legacy of truth behind.
[time=2275] One that encompassed guidance and integrity and courage and perspective of how to live life along with a perspective of how to live out such convictions in such a manner that they know not only influence, but they invade the hearts of others who are watching your life transform because that's what it's all about.
[time=2292] Is that somehow this idea of knowing God completely will leak its way out of my life
[time=2301] because of how I love myself appropriately, that others will be impacted and changed because of the integrity that they see lived out in me?
[time=2313] We teach others how to appropriately love oneself by loving the things that God loves.
[time=2318] So what is it that God loves?
[time=2323] What is it?
[time=2325] Look around.
[time=2327] Look around this morning, just work with me here, look around.
[time=2331] What is it that God loves?
[time=2332] Look around.
[time=2337] What is it that God loves?
[time=2339] Look around.
[time=2344] Paul drives it home.
[time=2347] He says, and this is my prayer that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight so that you might be able to discern what is best, that you might be able to distinguish the things that really matter most, and the things that really matter most, it's people.
[time=2365] It's people, folks.
[time=2368] That is what God loves the most, not your stuff, it's people.
[time=2373] And so the last thing about this legacy that we really need to hold on to is that we need to somehow love people compassionately.
[time=2379] We need to love people compassionately.
[time=2382] Peter Gard said, "To love another person is to help him to love God." Paul states about 1 Corinthians 13, "If I speak with tongues of men and angels, but I have not love, I am a noisy, gong, and clanging symbol." Peterson translates, or kind of writes it out, "I am the creaking of a rusty gate." So here's the deal.
[time=2399] My oratory, my philanthropy, my faith, that really does produce something that might impress
[time=2405] people, but it will never change people.
[time=2408] It doesn't have the power to reveal the secrets of their heart, to stir them to worship, to cause them to declare God is certainly among you, but love has the power to do that.
[time=2418] Authentic, demonstrated love does.
[time=2422] Last night at our Saturday night worship experience, for our 20-somethings, I didn't teach last
[time=2429] night, and I was sitting in the back of our sanctuary, and there came a moment in our worship
[time=2437] when some of our guys and gals just began to stand up spontaneously.
[time=2444] It's kind of an interesting moment.
[time=2447] Now, I was sitting in the back, and I was listening and singing along, and just began to look, and I looked over to my right, and I saw a young man who stood up, who, through his teen years, was just tremendously rebellious, walked away from his faith, walked away from his parents, and I saw him just standing there.
[time=2467] I saw him standing there, and I saw him singing those words, and his eyes were closed.
[time=2472] No arms were raised.
[time=2474] He was just standing there, worshiping God.
[time=2481] And I just took a few moments, and I just was reflecting on his life, and reflecting on the brokenness that he had come out of, and the hurt, and the pain, and the potential destruction.
[time=2491] And I thought, "What is it that has changed this guy's life?" I'll tell you what it is.
[time=2498] Was the fact that when he walked into our ministry, he walked in hurting, he walked in broken, kind of life in pieces, and there was a group of people who surrounded their
[time=2507] life, surrounded his life with their lives, and said, "We are going to love you compassionly."
[time=2515] It was the love of others who loved him with a sense of integrity and authenticity that
[time=2526] developed a desire, and this guy's heart to say, "I want to love God completely."
[time=2536] John Stackhouse said, "Well, our problem in evangelism is not a lack of training.
[time=2540] The problem is that we don't love." Sheldon Van Ockens said, "The strongest argument I have found yet for Christianity is Christians.
[time=2546] Their love, most of all, their joy as well, their certainty of things to come.
[time=2551] But the strongest argument that I have found yet against Christianity is also Christians.
[time=2556] When they are somber and joyless, when they are self-righteous and smug and complacent, when they are narrow, judgmental and repressive, lacking love, then Christianity dies a thousand deaths in my mind.
[time=2568] You build a great legacy when you build it around this idea of loving people compassionately.
[time=2578] One of my little side jobs that I do outside of fellowship is I work for an organization called Kingdom Building Ministries, and at KBM we travel to universities and campuses,
[time=2589] and we just talk about this idea of what does it mean to love God completely.
[time=2594] There is a university down south that asks us to come on campus and just simply assess
[time=2600] the spiritual climate of that campus.
[time=2602] So just come on in and assess it for us.
[time=2603] Help us to understand what it is.
[time=2605] What can we do to kind of raise the temperature a little bit on this campus, we're dealing with some stuff.
[time=2609] Just come in and help us out.
[time=2610] So we kind of sent out some question and answer forms prior to the profs and the faculty
[time=2616] and staff that were there and had them respond, and on that we asked them to kind of rate the campus according to a one to five based on what they felt, the spiritual temperature
[time=2627] was like on that campus.
[time=2629] And it was coming back threes and fours, and I was on my way down, I read through one particular form and they had put down there what would be a five if the athletes were not on campus.
[time=2642] I thought I hope I get to meet this person.
[time=2644] No name was on it, but I just was kind of hoping.
[time=2648] So the next day we're in some focus groups with some college students and some of their leaders on campus and we're talking about the spiritual climate and they're ranking in a three and a four and I'd been to chapel that morning and I had experienced their chapel and thought ooh, you know, could do some help here and so we're sitting with these students
[time=2666] and they're, I said help me out here, what's the deal on the athletes?
[time=2671] Oh, the athletes, yeah, let's deal on the athletes.
[time=2674] Well, you know, we love to win sports around here, yeah.
[time=2677] Well, really none of the athletes are Christians, oh.
[time=2682] So what you're telling me is that the spiritual climate of your campus probably would really be a four or five if you didn't have all these non-Christians around.
[time=2694] Well, it appears to me that you're about a one or two.
[time=2698] I'm sitting at lunch and we're talking to some athletes.
[time=2705] This young girl comes in and sits down, freshman student sits down beside me and she looks over at me, she says, who are you?
[time=2712] And I pulled my chair over to her and I said, well, I'm Ron, who are you?
[time=2715] So my name's Rupel.
[time=2716] I said, hey Rupel.
[time=2719] And she said, what are you doing here?
[time=2720] And I said, we're here to kind of assess the spiritual climate of your campus.
[time=2723] You know, what do you think it is?
[time=2725] She's all it's a five.
[time=2726] It's a five.
[time=2727] Things are really good around here.
[time=2728] I said, well, tell me about chapel.
[time=2730] Do you like it?
[time=2731] Oh, I love chapel.
[time=2732] I think chapel's the best.
[time=2733] I had been at chapel that morning.
[time=2734] It was not the best.
[time=2735] I knew there was something wrong with this picture.
[time=2738] We're talking a little bit more and I'm chatting with her and she said, well, you need to understand something.
[time=2742] I'm not a Christian.
[time=2744] I said, you're not a Christian.
[time=2746] What are you?
[time=2747] Well, I'm from India.
[time=2748] I'm a Hindu.
[time=2749] I said, I've never talked to a Hindu before.
[time=2753] We sat there for the next 40 minutes and we talked about Hinduism and Christianity comparing the two.
[time=2759] Just spending time talking with each other, Hinduism, Christianity.
[time=2761] And Rupel said, you know, she said, there's something about Christianity that really intrigues me.
[time=2765] She says, reading this book, I found God at Harvard.
[time=2768] And she said, in the book, I found God at Harvard, there's a story about a Hindu student that came to know Christ and accepted Christ as a Savior.
[time=2775] And she said, there's something about Christianity and Hinduism that really is different than anything else.
[time=2781] I said, what is it?
[time=2782] She said, well, in Hinduism, you can never be forgiven, really know you're forgiven.
[time=2786] But in Christianity, you can be forgiven.
[time=2787] I said, yeah, you can.
[time=2789] Of everything.
[time=2791] I said, Rupel.
[time=2792] So let me ask you a question.
[time=2793] I said, if you were God.
[time=2797] And if you could somehow, you wanted everyone to understand your love and your grace and your mercy and that they would come to a complete knowledge of who you are and you wanted to be in a relationship with them, what kind of a way would you devise?
[time=2811] What kind of a plan would you come up with for getting people to yell, what would you do?
[time=2817] Well, that's a hard question.
[time=2818] I'm not so sure that it is, so I'd come up with a simple plan, a pretty simple plan.
[time=2826] I think I would too, so that those who are not very intelligent and those who are incredibly
[time=2832] intelligent could all know about your love.
[time=2836] The simplest of minds to the most profound, right?
[time=2839] You would come up with a simple plan.
[time=2842] I said, what kind of a way would you come up with?
[time=2846] Well, Hinduism, there are many ways to God.
[time=2850] I said, well, I know that, but what kind of a way would you come up with?
[time=2853] She said, I'd come up with one way.
[time=2856] I'm sitting there.
[time=2858] God is setting me up.
[time=2862] I said, Rupaul, Jesus said, I am the way, the truth and the life.
[time=2870] No one comes to the Father except through me.
[time=2873] You understand that through Christ, the way to God, you can be totally forgiven of everything.
[time=2883] Tears welled up in Rupaul's eyes, went out and got her a Bible and said, start reading
[time=2889] John and keep going on your journey.
[time=2893] Now walked away from that lunch and I thought, the students on this campus are missing incredible opportunities to engage with people who are hurting and broken and searching.
[time=2903] And so oftentimes we get so caught up in our Christian world and do not misunderstand
[time=2910] my spirit here, maybe in your Blackhawk world, that you miss sight of those that are walking
[time=2916] into this place who are hurting and who are broken, whose lives have been incredibly fractured and shattered, who are walking into this place hopeless, folks they walk in every Sunday.
[time=2930] They're just looking for someone who will love them in an authentic manner and somehow convey the truth of Christ living in them and through them.
[time=2938] Somehow, if you can just allow the love of Christ to leak out of your life, it will penetrate the heart of those who are searching and looking for hope.
[time=2946] And it can happen.
[time=2947] It can happen right here at Blackhawk every Sunday.
[time=2949] Is that not the kind of church you want?
[time=2954] That's the kind of church I want.
[time=2958] That's the kind of church that Paul is calling us to.
[time=2963] Is a church that loves God completely, that you cannot help but not worship God with all
[time=2970] of your heart and with all of your soul and with all of your strength.
[time=2976] But people that live with integrity transformed lives so much so that you just have to love
[time=2986] people compassionately.
[time=2993] In the end, it's amazing what really matters the most because if you walk into any convalescent center or any hospital of someone who's dying, you find that the things that really matter the most of them all fit into a little hospital drawer, usually they're pictures of people.
[time=3014] So what about you as a church?
[time=3019] What will people in this community say about Blackhawk 10 or 20 years from now?
[time=3024] And as a church, you've experienced incredible prosperity.
[time=3030] Will people say that Blackhawk built great buildings?
[time=3036] Will people say that Blackhawk had great programs and great musicals and great music?
[time=3041] I hope not.
[time=3044] Will people say that they really knew their word and they really understood doctrine and
[time=3050] truth?
[time=3051] I hope that's not all.
[time=3056] I hope they say that this was a church that was filled with people who had a deep impassioned love for God, a deep love for people that when my life was broken and my life was shattered, when I walked into Blackhawk, my life was changed because of the community and the love that existed at Blackhawk.
[time=3073] I hope that's what people say 10 or 20 years from now because then, in fact, you will continue to live out your legacy of love within this community, within this world.
[time=3086] Because one of the primary ways of God that reveals the truth about God, especially to people who don't know God, is when the people of God demonstrate in authentic ways the love of God.
[time=3098] So what really matters most?
[time=3104] One years ago, my dad died.
[time=3108] I had the privilege of being in a hospital room when my mother passed on and when my
[time=3114] father passed on.
[time=3117] My dad, 36 years, put in caterpillar tractors together, didn't make a whole lot of money.
[time=3124] Never forget, got a phone call on that particular Thursday and dad had an aortic aneurysm and
[time=3130] so I flew home, got back to Illinois and walked in that hospital room and dad was laying
[time=3137] in his hospital room.
[time=3138] Had aneurysm about 8 o'clock that morning, I got into the hospital room about 3 o'clock and dad was laying there and I walked in and he just started talking to me about my life.
[time=3148] Asking about, you know, all sorts of little details about things.
[time=3154] His new bride of 14 months was standing beside his bed and my siblings were in the room as well and we met with the doctors and the doctors told us, you know, 5% chance of survival will do surgery anyway.
[time=3166] Wielding down to surgery, as dad was being wheeled down to surgery, my dad is barking off orders.
[time=3170] Don't forget about this.
[time=3173] Okay.
[time=3174] Dad comes back and they brought him back in the room and next day it was over.
[time=3180] We walked through the funeral services through a whole week of walking through stuff with
[time=3186] dad and saying goodbye and it was all said and done.
[time=3192] My dad's young bride brought all of us into her kitchen and she sat us all down and she put us around this table and you need to understand that within my family it's pretty
[time=3203] fractured with siblings.
[time=3208] We sat there together and she brought out this red toolbox.
[time=3213] Put it down on the table and she said I don't know what's in that thing but I've seen your dad every so often kind of fiddling around in that at night and I don't know what's in it but I was given specific instructions that none of you were to open up that box alone.
[time=3227] So here's the combination, 1821, my dad's birth date, my mom's birth date.
[time=3233] Dad was just always thinking ahead.
[time=3235] We popped that lock.
[time=3236] I think some were sitting there thinking there's the money.
[time=3240] I wasn't but you know we'll make that clear.
[time=3249] Pop open that box and inside that box was just a bunch of memories.
[time=3257] There's just memories.
[time=3259] There was no value to that box whatsoever in regards to finances, nothing of any value
[time=3266] in that box but an incredible amount of memories.
[time=3270] Things we'd given dad when we were kids.
[time=3272] Pocket watches, little trinkets at Christmas that somehow my dad had stored and kept in this toolbox all these years.
[time=3279] Pictures of he and his brother and they were just tiny little guys put into an orphanage and just a box full of memories, just a box full of memories.
[time=3288] Close that box up, no one wanted it so I said I'm taking it so I took it home with me.
[time=3295] I look back at that box now and I can tell you that when my dad died he really didn't
[time=3304] leave in a state behind.
[time=3309] There really wasn't much financially to leave behind but I'll tell you what my dad did leave behind, my dad taught me how to love my wife by the way he loved my mother,
[time=3325] my dad taught me how to love my kids by the way he loved us kids, my dad taught me how
[time=3332] to forgive people by the way he forgave people, my dad taught me how to love God by the way
[time=3342] he loved God.
[time=3345] He taught me how to love God completely.
[time=3350] He taught me how to love myself appropriately but folks he taught me how to love people
[time=3357] compassion and that is a legacy that money just can't buy.
[time=3366] So I don't know what you're going to leave behind but the one thing you can leave behind
[time=3373] that will last forever is a legacy of love.
[time=3378] Loving God completely, loving yourself appropriately, loving others compassion.
[time=3386] Will you stand with me, let's pray.
[time=3389] Would you do me a favor, would you join hands with folks around you and just allow the
[time=3398] aisles to be kind of brought in together?
[time=3403] I think this is appropriate today.
[time=3408] Let's pray together.
[time=3414] Father.
[time=3417] This is a place that stands for truth.
[time=3427] This church is a place that is known for its people and it's known for its passion.
[time=3437] It's known for its purpose.
[time=3439] Father, I pray this morning that as these folks are holding hands with folks around this
[time=3447] room, maybe people they don't even know, that somehow in some way you would convey the
[time=3454] importance of just loving each other, setting aside differences.
[time=3459] Well, let me if I can take you back to the beginning of the Bible hour today.
[time=3464] You saw some questions that came on the screen.
[time=3467] Is there hope?
[time=3468] Are there really answers?
[time=3470] And I just want to remind you again that we believe there is hope and we know for a fact that there are answers.
[time=3476] And we would love nothing more than to if we could help you, encourage you and come alongside
[time=3482] you as you discover, maybe for the first time where that hope is found and where those answers lie.
[time=3488] So please call us, write us, come by on a Sunday and visit us.
[time=3492] We'd love to meet you and help you understand better the hope and the answers found in our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3527] [AMEN]
