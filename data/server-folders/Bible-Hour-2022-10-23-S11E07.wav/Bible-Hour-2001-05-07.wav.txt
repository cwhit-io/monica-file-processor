[time=32] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird Pastor here at Blackhawk, and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=36] As the opening just said, is there hope?
[time=40] Are there answers?
[time=42] We realize here at Blackhawk, these are the questions that so many today are asking.
[time=47] The situations that you face, the circumstances that you find yourself in lead you to ask those very questions, and we're so thankful that we can on a weekly basis come into a place like this, open up God's Word, and come to the realization all over again that you
[time=63] know what?
[time=64] There's hope.
[time=65] There really is, and there are answers, and it's real-life stuff.
[time=69] God has not left us to just kind of aimlessly wander through life, no, He has given us direction.
[time=75] He has given us hope, and He has given us answers, and so I'm so thankful.
[time=80] We're so glad that you've joined us in our journey to continue to find out what those answers are, where is the hope, and who is it that He's called us to be.
[time=89] I hope you enjoy your time with us today.
[time=93] We want to spend a little bit of time this morning on a special tribute to you moms, and
[time=99] as we've reviewed how to spend our time together today, and to be able to honor you
[time=106] moms, we found nothing really encapsulates more of what you do for us on a daily basis
[time=113] than a video, and we'd like to watch that together.
[time=129] When darkness falls upon your heart and soul, I'll be the light that shines for you,
[time=150] when you forget how beautiful you are, I'll be there to remind you, when you can't find
[time=166] your way, I'll find my way to you, when troubles come around, I will come to you, I'll be your
[time=180] shoulder, when you need someone to lean on, feel shelter, when you need someone to see
[time=189] you through, I'll be there to carry you, I'll be there, I'll be the rock that will be
[time=197] strong for you, the one that you hold on to you, when you feel that rain falling down,
[time=210] when there's nobody else around, I'll be, and when you're there with no one there to
[time=224] hold, I'll be the arms that reach for you, and when you feel your faith is running low,
[time=243] I'll be there to be to lean in you, when all you find are lies, I'll be the truth you need,
[time=258] when you need someone to run to, you can run to me, I'll be your shoulder, when you need
[time=268] someone to lean on, be your shoulder, when you need someone to see you through, I'll
[time=276] be there to carry you, I'll be there, I'll be the rock that will be strong for you, the
[time=286] one that you hold on to you, when you feel that rain falling down, when there's nobody
[time=298] else around, I'll be, I'll be the sun, when your hearts feel with rain, I'll be the one
[time=315] to chase the rain away, I'll be your shoulder, when you need someone to lean on, be your
[time=327] shoulder, when you need someone to see you through, I'll be there to carry you, I'll be
[time=353] around, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be
[time=399] in places, thirsty, I come after you, Jesus, my joy, my reward,
[time=429] your love's restored, my soul, now I'm frozen, you are mine, and from my heart a song will
[time=452] rise, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love
[time=469] you, and my heart will follow, holy after you, Jesus, there is God beside you,
[time=494] I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you,
[time=494] [REPETITIVE CONTENT - 246 seconds] I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you,...
[time=761] I sure wish we could see him now, hey Barn, you thinking what I'm thinking?
[time=774] I think I'm thinking what you're thinking, you're thinking about going back, the thought
[time=782] crossed my mind, it'd be expensive, but just think of the frequent flyer mileage, hey could
[time=788] you get away from the business, oh sure, cap and season's over, it's a slow time for ten sales anyway, we're on, we're on, great, you call the travel agent and book us on the first flight out say tomorrow, tomorrow's great, I will call John Mark, it's only fair
[time=804] for us to give him a couple hours to pack his bags, we'll need at least that much time to, hey Barn, did you say John Mark, yeah, why, something wrong, yeah something's wrong,
[time=823] don't look at me like you don't know what I'm talking about, he's a good man, Paul, I know he's a good man, that's not the point, the point is he's young and inexperienced,
[time=834] he's not ready for this kind of responsibility, I agree, he wasn't ready for that, he was that last trip, and he did leave us when things got tough, but I think he's ready for this one, it was a month ago for crying out loud, well you got a crash course on maturity, he
[time=849] may have failed us, but he learned a lot on that trip, he learned a lot, I'll tell you
[time=855] who learned a lot, I did, you seem to forget how he left us at the gate, until the last
[time=862] call and know John Mark, I remember, do you remember the message on your machine, hey
[time=869] Barn it's Mark, started leaving the lurch like this, I'm not sure I'm cut out for this kind of business, need some time to think, catch you later, alright, he blew it, we know that,
[time=881] he knows that, but whatever happened to second chances, whatever happened to forgiveness, whatever happened to a clean start, I am all for forgiveness here, don't make me out like
[time=893] the bad guy, I just think you need some time around here, a year or two maybe, prove himself
[time=899] faithful as a smaller ear is that all, anything sitting around here, it's like getting thrown from a horse you got to get right back on, I had no idea you felt this way, yeah I guess
[time=924] we both do, so what are we going to do, I don't know, you won't go with him, I won't
[time=946] go without him, maybe you'll have to go without me, I'd hate that, me too, do you see any
[time=970] other way, no, me either, how do we do this if we don't go together, I'll find somebody
[time=989] else, Silas said he'd like to go with us some time, maybe he could go, don't worry
[time=995] about me, I will though, you've been like a brother to me Paul, same here, well I guess
[time=1015] if I'm going then this is goodbye for a while, wish me luck, it's not luck buddy, you be
[time=1029] careful out there, you know I'll be praying for you, yeah, me too
[time=1049] you know I absolutely love the Bible, I love it, I absolutely love the Word of God, I love
[time=1072] its truth, I love its power, I love its authority, I love its perfection, I love its insight,
[time=1079] I love its clarity, its history, its endurance and I love its veracity and I echo this morning
[time=1086] the words of David in Psalm 19 verses 7 to 11 and those words are going to be on the screen
[time=1093] here and I echo those words to you this morning, it says in Psalm 19 verses 7 through 11 it
[time=1101] says the law of the Lord is perfect, the law meaning the scriptures, the Word of God that book you hold in your hands this morning, David said and we echo those words this morning
[time=1112] the law of the Lord is perfect, restoring the soul, the testimony of the Lord is sure
[time=1118] making wise the simple, he goes on in verse 8 to say the precepts of the Lord are right
[time=1124] rejoicing the heart, the commandment of the Lord is pure enlightening the eyes, the fear
[time=1130] of the Lord is clean enduring forever, the judgments of the Lord are true, they are righteous
[time=1136] all together, all of these words here in this passage referring to precepts, judgments,
[time=1142] all of them referring to the scriptures, they are he says more desirable than gold, are they
[time=1150] to you?
[time=1152] He says they are more desirable than gold, yes than much fine gold, sweeter also than
[time=1158] honey and the drippings of the honeycomb and then in verse 11 he says moreover by them
[time=1165] the Word of God the scriptures, the precepts, the judgments, by them he says thy servant
[time=1171] is warned in keeping them, in keeping them and listening and adhering to them he says
[time=1179] there is great reward and you know one of the things I love most about the scriptures
[time=1185] is how real they are, that's right how every day they are, how applicable the Word of God
[time=1193] is to every day living and this morning we see that very same thing again as Acts 15
[time=1200] and Acts 16 lead us into a look at two issues every single person in this room this morning
[time=1207] faces two, three, four, five, six times a day, this morning Acts 15 and Acts 16 bring us face
[time=1217] to face with a real life look at relational conflict, relational conflict and doors, doors
[time=1227] that you and I were sure were open but instead God closed, relational conflict and closed
[time=1239] doors, what do we mean by what do we mean when we say relational conflict, what do we mean when we say closed doors, well relational conflict, you see it you bump into it we exist
[time=1251] within the midst of it daily, few examples come to mind the curfew, the curfew at your
[time=1260] house begins to as the weeks go by it seems as if the curfew begins to mean absolutely
[time=1266] nothing, disrespectful tones become the norm and the fuse gets shorter and shorter, she
[time=1275] says let's say if you say let's spend, friends, friends of yours handle their kids differently,
[time=1287] friends of yours handle their kids differently and the more and more time you spend together the more the tension mounts nobody quite knows what to do or what to say but it's getting
[time=1298] to be difficult, a free afternoon, a free afternoon comes along and you, you want solitude, peace
[time=1306] and quiet, your spouse wants five families over all their kids, hot dogs on the grill,
[time=1313] music loud and lots of commotion, that was a real life one from our own life, relational
[time=1323] conflict, it's not foreign tea, closed doors, not foreign tea either, closed doors you were
[time=1333] sure were going to be open because you know you were sure that that stock was a good investment,
[time=1342] you were sure that that job was for you, you had no doubt, everything lined up, everything
[time=1349] was coming together, you were absolutely convinced that job was for you, you were sure you've
[time=1357] been sure in your heart from the day you were a young little girl, you were just convinced God wanted you to have children, it's something you've dreamed of, it's something you've long
[time=1369] moved for, it's something you've thought of, you were sure, you were sure that she liked
[time=1379] you and that all you'd have to do was ask her to go out and she'd say yes and it all be good and it wasn't, now you're bummed, you were sure you'd be accepted at that university,
[time=1395] or you'd be accepted at that college, relational conflict and closed doors right here in the
[time=1402] midst of Acts 15 and 16, let's take a look first of all at conflict, you know the Bible
[time=1409] never flatters its heroes, do you ever notice that, God did a great job, I've never really
[time=1417] flattering too much as heroes, one moment we read about David bravely slinging a stone
[time=1423] at, at who kids, at a boy, good job, Goliath, one moment we read about David bravely slinging
[time=1432] a stone at Goliath and the next we see him casting a lustful glance toward Bathsheba,
[time=1439] we admire Peter when he leaves his nets to follow Jesus but we shake our heads when he denies him on the eve of his crucifixion how many times, three, we go absolutely nuts
[time=1453] over Elijah who on top of Mount Carmel absolutely and completely obliterates the prophets of
[time=1460] Bail, challenging them, calling them on the carpet and cleaning house we go nuts for Elijah
[time=1466] as he victoriously stands on top of that mountain and we shake our heads in disbelief when one
[time=1475] page later he's cowering before Jezebel, scripts or paints its characters realistically folks
[time=1484] and that is good news, it's good news for me I know because it allows me to identify
[time=1490] with these people in the Bible they're just like me and if God can use them maybe he can use me too and at the end of Acts 15 Luke displays Paul and Barnabas in realism's unflinching
[time=1501] light these two missionaries weren't plaster saints no not at all they were fallible men
[time=1508] who had headstrong opinions, opinions that sometimes clashed and in the following passage such a clash of wills occurs between them that they end up parting ways never to minister
[time=1520] together again.
[time=1524] Now don't forget this before we jump in don't forget this and part of me feels like I shouldn't
[time=1531] even have to say it but my days and the conversations we have and the things that you see make
[time=1537] me feel like I should just remind us one more time don't forget this people relational
[time=1543] conflict is inevitable right it's going to happen you're not going to and I'm not going
[time=1550] to avoid it we are fallen human beings living in a fallen world and there will be times
[time=1556] and there will be days when conflict happens it is first of all don't forget inevitable
[time=1562] secondly don't forget this about conflict God honoring God honoring good people who
[time=1568] love God with all of their heart God honoring good people who love God and are committed
[time=1576] to him will have conflicts will not see things the same way and them not seeing things the
[time=1583] same way will lead to tension good people my wife is a good good woman.
[time=1590] Deborah loves God with all of her heart I love God with all of my heart but we can't
[time=1597] load a dishwasher together in the same room guys can I hear an amen on that one ladies
[time=1605] can I hear an amen on that one I mean I guess I missed the day they were passing out the book on how to load a dishwasher the right way I mean it's it's frustrating and we just
[time=1618] keep working at it and I'm learning and she's getting more flexible but good people conflicting
[time=1625] over things all the time and don't forget this too this is helpful to remember basic I
[time=1632] know but helpful a conflict a conflict this comprised of two things don't forget a conflict
[time=1639] is comprised of two things an issue an issue and varying opinions about the issue and issues
[time=1649] are a matter our matter of principle issues time and time again are a matter of principle
[time=1656] opinions are a matter of personality personalities and principles coming together and it's two
[time=1664] vastly different personalities that come head to head here in acts 15 look with me at number
[time=1670] one Paul and Barnabas disagree acts 15 verses 36 to 38 acts 15 verses 36 to 38 Paul and Barnabas
[time=1681] disagree and it says there after some days Paul said to Barnabas let us return and visit
[time=1687] the brethren in every city in which we proclaim the word of the Lord and see how they are and
[time=1694] Barnabas was desirous of taking John called Mark along with them also but Paul kept insisting
[time=1701] that they should not take him along who had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the work stop there what a great great job these guys did this morning of portraying
[time=1713] the very heart and essence of this conflict did a fantastic job remember remember now back
[time=1721] to acts 13 what had happened remember young Mark had jumped ship and regardless of why
[time=1727] there was no denying he had let these two down and as they plan for journey number two the issue conflict remember issue personalities varying opinions the issue comes clearly to
[time=1740] the surface and the issue in this case was this simply stated should someone who had failed
[time=1746] should someone who had quit be given a second chance should somebody be given a second chance
[time=1754] when it related to something that was as important and strategic and so very significant to the
[time=1760] birth of the church and the growth of the gospel should somebody who jumped ship be given another
[time=1766] shot one issue two viewpoints one principle two personalities and we'll start with Barnabas
[time=1774] because Barnabas said no if ands or buts about it Barnabas said yes it would be as if Barnabas
[time=1782] was looking at Paul saying hey Paul wait a second time out does the name I don't know take your pick there's the name Jonah mean anything to you there's the name Moses now that rings a bell
[time=1795] there's the name Jonah there's the name Moses how about our friend Peter come on Paul he's saying
[time=1802] use your head use your heart of course he should be given a second chance verse 37 says in my text
[time=1809] it uses the word desirous I don't know what it says in yours mine says he was desirous now that's a
[time=1815] decent translation but in the Greek text the flavor of that phrase is much much more intense it means
[time=1822] in the original language to will in one's heart to want it says with intent and tenacity in other
[time=1829] words Barnabas's feet as rich portrayed this morning were firmly planted and he was going to stand his
[time=1836] ground if it were to be to him John Mark would get the second chance that's it Paul says with the
[time=1843] same tenacity and the same intensity not gonna happen not gonna happen verse 38 Paul insists Paul
[time=1854] kept insisting that Mark was unreliable and an unneeded risk this wasn't after all an overnight
[time=1862] camp out this was kingdom time according to Paul according to Paul and the way Paul is wired and
[time=1869] the way Paul is thinking and the way Paul approaches this according to his personality Paul says you know what this is big stuff there are churches to birth there are believers to encourage and the
[time=1880] road will be not might be but will be treacherous it will be dangerous leave them home leave them
[time=1888] here too much at stake too much at risk what do you think i've been wondering all week kind of
[time=1899] waiting for this moment a room this size and i mean it because there's a lot of people in this
[time=1906] room wired like Barnabas and there are a lot of people in this room wired like Paul and none of
[time=1915] you are wrong just wired differently you've got different personalities and Barnabas was right
[time=1922] i mean in a sense right i mean think about Jonah and think about Moses and think about Peter and
[time=1928] my goodness think about you who got the second chance Barnabas had something going there
[time=1934] and you think about Paul man i love his intensity and i love the fact that his intensity is so tied
[time=1942] to something that is so very important and you know what people it was important this wasn't a camp
[time=1948] out this wasn't something that you were kind of in or you were kind of out no there were stones to duck so what do you think and don't be afraid about being wrong or right again i'm just trying
[time=1960] to get a feel and i want you to see how many in the room honestly probably would you know you don't
[time=1966] have to plant yourself firmly but just you'd probably lean toward Barnabas look around all right and
[time=1975] how many in the room would probably if forced lean toward Paul yes it's just kidding it's just kidding
[time=1990] interesting a lot of different personalities in this room which tells me something you face conflict
[time=1998] as much as i do unfortunately and i mean this unfortunately for all the solutions available to
[time=2008] these guys they chose i believe the saddest what you saw portrayed right here on this stage this
[time=2016] morning i believe was the saddest of all opportunities of all solutions i believe was the saddest one
[time=2024] they could have ever chosen because they chose in the end what separation they chose to separate
[time=2032] Paul and Barnabas disagree now we see Paul and Barnabas separate verses 39 to 41 and there arose
[time=2041] such a sharp disagreement that they separated from one another and Barnabas took mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus but Paul chose Silas and departed being committed to the brethren
[time=2054] being committed by the brethren to the grace of the Lord and he was traveling through Syria and Silesia strengthening the churches stuck in a stalemate the two friends and brothers in
[time=2067] Christ lose something very precious to them both the others presence and you know as the church did you see that in verse uh did you see that in verse 40 as the
[time=2078] church gives Paul their blessing they gave Paul they gave Paul not Barnabas the church gives Paul
[time=2088] their blessing and as they give Paul their blessing he may have sensed them siding with him and the tragic truth is he may have won the argument but you know what people he lost a friend he may have won an argument but he lost a friend and i want you to think back for a minute many of
[time=2104] you may have already thought back even as these guys portrayed that interaction this morning but i want you to think back for a moment at what what got forfeited there i want you to think about
[time=2115] Barnabas for a moment who was Barnabas to Paul he may have won an argument people but he lost a friend
[time=2122] who was it that had defended the young saw before his name was even Paul who was it
[time=2129] that had defended the young convert saw in front of the skeptics and the church there at Jerusalem
[time=2137] these people who were of the faith in Jerusalem young saw who used to murder and torture christians
[time=2145] shows up saying he saved they're skeptical they're very untrusting who defended him who wasn't
[time=2152] Barnabas that's right who searched for him who tracked Paul down when when when God began to do
[time=2162] something in Antioch when when the fire got lit and people were beginning to respond and there was
[time=2168] there was work to be done who went who went and searched for Paul and said hey man it's time
[time=2175] you get to get back in the game come on i've come for you there's work to do who searched him out Barnabas who attended to his wounds in Lestra after the stoning Barnabas
[time=2187] you see he may have won an argument friends but he lost a companion
[time=2193] and i got to say this to you this morning whoever you are wherever you're living whatever
[time=2202] your reality might be today in a room this size i know this is true because i know me and you and i aren't a whole lot different you may be you may be winning the
[time=2216] argument but losing a son you may be winning an argument but losing a husband you may be
[time=2225] winning an argument you may be winning you may have over the years gotten really really good at winning arguments and now today you'll wonder why life is so lonely you may be winning arguments but losing things very very precious to you
[time=2244] along the way lessons learned before we move on to closed doors number one give some thought to
[time=2253] this please lessons learned number one work hard to see the other side please work hard
[time=2260] please work hard please be diligent please give yourself to doing everything possible to see
[time=2268] and understand the other side flip flip back to the book of Philippians just a few books back
[time=2276] Philippians chapter two was reading this this week and realized
[time=2283] realized who wrote it who wrote Philippians who paul a little bit after the going ons there in
[time=2294] in acts and he says in Philippians two it's as if he kind of maybe learned some things as time went by
[time=2301] because paul says to the church at Philippi in chapter two verse three do nothing you see it there do
[time=2307] nothing from selfishness or empty conceit but with humility of mind let each of you regard one another
[time=2315] as more important than himself do not merely look out for your own personal interests but also for
[time=2323] the interests of others question for you this morning moms dads husbands wives friends
[time=2331] do you do you actually work hard do you actually give yourself are you diligent are you persistent
[time=2339] in attempting to gain insight and understanding to better understand their position how hard do
[time=2346] you work to really get inside their shoes how faithful how diligent and how persistent are
[time=2355] you to literally get across the table and sit in their seat see what they see feel what they feel
[time=2363] exercise and experience their perspective do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit
[time=2372] paul says but with humility of mind get inside their shoes or are you too arrogant or are you too proud to say simple words like I see your point
[time=2387] I see your point I could do that I could do that better you're right
[time=2400] secondly and I heard this phrase a couple weekends ago at men's retreat I loved it so you used it here don't get stuck on stupid people be creative in my opinion these guys got stuck
[time=2413] on stupid in my opinion these guys could have come up with something better than separation
[time=2419] author Leslie Flynn adds these insightful suggestions she says could paul have said
[time=2427] we'll tell him he's on probation if he doesn't work out the first month we'll ship him home again could paul have said that yeah he could have or perhaps Barnabas could have conceded we do need
[time=2438] dedicated workers on our team paul that's true let's give mark a minor assignment here at home
[time=2444] to see how he does meanwhile we'll start on our journey and if we hear he's measuring up back home we'll send for him to join us along the way could Barnabas have suggested that sure
[time=2457] or could they have agreed to a contingent plan let's take mark but others also if mark desserts us again we'll have others to fall back on either the inventiveness watch this
[time=2468] she says either the inventiveness of love should have discovered some middle ground or the submission
[time=2475] of love should have yielded the point entirely did you get that either the inventiveness of love
[time=2485] should have discovered some middle ground or the submission of love should have simply yielded the point entirely one way or the other people conflict doesn't have to end
[time=2497] in winning do you hear me conflict doesn't have to shouldn't end in winning conflict can end
[time=2506] if handled properly it can end in harmony it can end in growth it can end and lead toward
[time=2514] greater intimacy when the two personalities and i don't care if we're dealing with deep
[time=2524] marital issues or where the steak knives go in the dishwasher the wooden handles and all you know
[time=2533] when two personalities are deeply committed to seeing the other side conflict doesn't
[time=2542] have to end in winning and losing because you know and i know in relationship there's no
[time=2548] such thing right you do know that don't you there is no winner and loser we both what lose thirdly don't ever give up i wish i could just stand here and say this to you i wouldn't it would be time well spent
[time=2566] people in light of what i see and come across it would be time well spent in my opinion if i could just stand here for the next 20 minutes and just say that to you again and again and again don't ever give up do not ever give up i get so weary and i get so broken hearted i get so
[time=2583] discouraged to see people and i feel it in myself at times coming to points where we
[time=2589] were where we say regardless of what the truth says we say you know what that's it

[time=2674] go back just a book from Philippians to Ephesians if you were still in Philippians look at chapter four and we're going to move on if he's in chapter four look at what it says here again the
[time=2687] apostle paul writing to the church at Ephesus and he says and you know it's very important to note
[time=2695] when he said this okay and we've talked about this before let me just remind you briefly okay Ephesians six chapters divided in half first three chapters of Ephesians he goes to great
[time=2706] links to write and describe for us who we are in christ first three chapters of Ephesians are all
[time=2714] about our position we've come to know him we've committed our lives to him chapters one two and three describe for us who we are in christ chapters four five and six he turns the corner from position
[time=2727] to practice now he says now that you know who you are this is how you are to live
[time=2734] and what is the very first thing he says the very first thing out of the gate on this practice side
[time=2741] verse chapter four verses one to three i therefore the prisoner of the lord entreat you at word means
[time=2748] to beg and plead and he begs and he pleads with them to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with
[time=2757] what you have been called with all humility there's that word again folks there's that word again dads there's that word again wives there's that word again friends with all humility and gentleness
[time=2770] with patience showing forbearance to one another in love being diligent word in the greek means to
[time=2777] exercise to the point of physical exhaustion god's word says to us this morning as it relates to
[time=2787] relational conflict be diligent to the point of physical exhaustion work that hard to preserve the
[time=2796] unity of the spirit in the bond of peace relational conflict these guys work through it i don't like
[time=2809] how it ended i don't like their conclusion and the fact is we get a chance you and i every day
[time=2818] to make similar decisions please give it some thought and allow the truth of god's word to guide you
[time=2825] closed doors let's look at this they faced relational conflict and closed doors
[time=2832] look with me at chapter 16 verses one to five there you will see paul's plan paul's agenda paul's hope
[time=2839] paul's direction gaining momentum he's off and running says in chapter 16 verse one and he came also to derby and to lister and behold a certain
[time=2852] disciple was there named timothy here's where timothy comes into the picture timothy it says the son of a jewish woman who was a believer but his father was a greek and he was well spoken of timothy was by the brethren who were in lister and iconium paul wanted this man to go with him and he took him and circumcised him because of the jews
[time=2873] who were in those parts for they all knew that his father was a greek now while they were passing through the cities they were delivering the decrees which had been decided upon by the apostles and elders who were in jerusalem for them to observe so the churches were being strengthened in the faith and were increasing in number daily man this guy's got it going
[time=2894] he has added an individual now to his team and then individuals name is timothy great things are going to happen they're gaining momentum they're taking the decree we looked at last week the Jerusalem council as it dealt with the issue of circumcision and genuine salvation they're
[time=2910] bringing the words of james and that whole council they're bringing those words to all the people
[time=2916] explaining them allowing the folks to hear them they're preaching the gospel they're proclaiming truth and people it says daily we're coming to faith this kingdom advancing snowball is headed
[time=2929] downhill and it is going quick and it's gaining speed as it goes and paul has his sight
[time=2935] paul has the scope of this thing set squarely on a place called asia and nothing can stop me now he's got to be thinking he's got to be feeling he's got to be
[time=2947] sensing what great things might god have in store we've got a committed team we've got the greatest
[time=2953] message in the world we've got some experience we've learned from our mistakes
[time=2960] and then we come to chapter 16 verse 6 where god closes the door
[time=2966] here it is says in verse 6 and they passed and they passed through the frigid and galation region
[time=2974] having been forbidden by the holy spirit to speak the word in asia you see that just forbidden
[time=2983] forbidden by the holy spirit i don't know how he did it i don't know what it sounded like i'm not
[time=2989] quite sure what it looked like but what we know is that the holy spirit comes and forbids these guys
[time=2995] from speaking from opening their mouths in this region called asia
[time=3004] and when they had come verse 7 and when they had come to missia they were trying to go into
[time=3010] bithynia and the spirit of jesus did not permit them and passing by missia they came down to troas
[time=3018] look at verse 9 and of it maybe you've been here before not in troas all right
[time=3026] but maybe you've been here before maybe you have in one of the situations i expressed earlier
[time=3036] or others maybe i missed maybe you've been in verse 6 verse 7 verse 8 maybe you have felt what it feels like to be so convinced that this was the direction god was
[time=3049] moving you in and maybe you know what it's like to have the spirit of god working through your heart
[time=3057] or god himself working through circumstances maybe you've had him close a few doors not allow you to speak not allow you to go in door shut
[time=3070] look what happens in verse 9 maybe you've been here too and a vision appeared to paul in the night a certain man of massedonia was standing now watch this i should
[time=3083] have had the map my fault if you remember back weeks ago we kind of put maps up here and most of
[time=3089] the activity right was kind of over here on this side into gyroosome and they would kind of go up on these journeys they would go up around the sea and as they would go up into the left paul wanted
[time=3099] to go north into asia and at this point as they make their way to troas he's like over on the far
[time=3105] western side and the the inlet comes up and they're there and this is where that vision comes and on the other side of the sea this way there's a man in massedonia massedonia would have been over and
[time=3117] then even further up to the north wasn't where they were planning on going didn't have any agenda
[time=3124] for massedonia and god closes these doors and in verse 9 there's a vision a man of massedonia
[time=3131] standing and appealing to him saying come over to massedonia and help us and when he had seen the
[time=3139] vision verse 10 immediately we to catch that we and when he had seen the vision immediately we
[time=3149] guess who has joined paul now look now we got luke now we got paul now we got stylist we got
[time=3157] timothy man we got a team and it says when they had seen the vision immediately we sought to go into massedonia concluding that god had called us to preach the gospel to them
[time=3170] lessons learned take some truth home with you today chew on this give this some fun and we'll be done number one before he can change our course and let me see your heads nod if you can identify with this one okay because my heads nodding okay
[time=3186] before he can change our course he sometimes has to stop us you identify yeah because sometimes
[time=3196] we are just so convinced that this is it and we go and he throws the first obstacle out and we go
[time=3203] what was that i'm pat we were jumping over speed bumps divinely placed bumps in the road i'm
[time=3211] convinced him kind of trying to get your attention him trying to slow you down here's another obstacle
[time=3218] he throws that in the way and we kind of duck around that one and go wow what was that i'm off
[time=3227] it's like my daughter westerly going on the driveway we're riding bikes now without training wheels around our house it's a great time a lot of band-aids a lot of that stuff that foams up
[time=3239] what's that stuff called yeah a lot of that and you know what she gets so excited you've been there
[time=3246] she gets so focused top of the driveway and i've told her a thousand times go slow down the driveway
[time=3253] look what look both ways and you say it to her again and again and inevitably a couple days will go by and you'll just catch her in a moment where she's just lying down that thing of the day i literally had to just grab her as she's coming by just grab her by her shoulders
[time=3268] stop and then she's just in another world she's in this zone you know she's just enjoying the speed and the thrill of the moment and i grab her by her shoulders and say stop what are you doing
[time=3279] i'm just going down the driveway tab this is so exciting and that's you and that's me we're just
[time=3285] going down this road because man it's going to be so great you with me and sometimes God just
[time=3291] has to come up behind us take you by the shoulders pick you up off the bike and say you know what i've been trying to get your attention now i'm stopping you the door shut
[time=3306] sometimes you have to change our course inevitably number two inevitably a closed door brings now hear me out here because this one's hard i know for some especially if what we're dealing with is a very sensitive issue and many of them are
[time=3323] but i believe this to be true with all of my heart and i believe it to be true because God's word says it's true inevitably people whoever you are whatever you're facing a closed door brings
[time=3334] in time a new comma add this a new comma good door
[time=3340] you think and i think so many times that any door other than the door we wanted
[time=3347] is a less than best door and it's not true because God causes all things to work together for what
[time=3353] good to those who love him to those who are called according to his purpose he is a good
[time=3360] gracious loving heavenly father who knows so much more about all this than you and i combined ever will and in time inevitably when doors shut new doors good doors open
[time=3373] and it may not look here's the hard thing it may not look anything like the door
[time=3379] you were moving toward i've seen it with career changes i've seen it in family situations i've
[time=3386] seen it in relationships time and time again doors shut new doors in time open that are
[time=3393] good doors but completely different Matthew 7 11 going to end with this when it comes to him being good now stay with me here
[time=3408] when it comes with your struggle in mind to really embrace the new good door please don't forget
[time=3414] what it says please don't forget what he says and Matthew said Jesus himself said it Matthew
[time=3420] chapter 7 are you there go down to verse go down to verse 11 Jesus says i love this
[time=3430] it brings insight it brings clarity and you know what i think it brings real comfort it says in
[time=3436] verse 11 if then if you then being evil Jesus talking to men to us evil meaning human if you then
[time=3445] being human if you then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children come on he says
[time=3453] how much more shall your father who is in heaven give what is really truly purely good
[time=3461] to those who seek to those who ask him how much more did you see that shall your father who is in
[time=3469] heaven give what is good to those who ask him now don't forget in his time in his place in his
[time=3476] circumstance when doors get shut new ones good ones get open ours is the opportunity to faithfully
[time=3486] follow him through the process God truly has our best in mind and is willing to open doors for us
[time=3493] in his time that's the choice you're going to stand and bang on a door that's not going to open or with trust and sensitivity the leading of God move toward new doors that in his time and place
[time=3506] will open.
