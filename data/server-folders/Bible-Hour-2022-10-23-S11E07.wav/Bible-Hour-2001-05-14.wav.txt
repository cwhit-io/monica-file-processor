[time=0] [THEME MUSIC]
[time=31] It wasn't too long ago that my five-year-old daughter and I were out on the street in front of our house.
[time=37] The day had come for her to learn how to ride her bike without her training wheels.
[time=41] And after several incredibly unsuccessful attempts, a couple of bloody knees and a severely bruised sense of confidence, she looked up at me.
[time=51] And with tears in her eyes, she said this, she said, Dad, I'll try one more time as long as you don't let go.
[time=59] And I thought, you know, isn't that how it is, as you and I attempt to face life, that need we have for that sense of his presence, his hand on our lives.
[time=72] And I hope that as you join us today, and as you hear us sing and speak and live out the truth, I hope that there would be a greater sense of confidence in your heart, a greater sense of his presence as he walks through life with his hand on our backs, leading, guiding, taking us to places that he wants us to go.
[time=94] - My dear brother.
[time=99] - Dear Frank.
[time=100] - To Hiram.
[time=101] - Ooh.
[time=103] - Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=108] I thank my God for you, for your perseverance and your steadfast hope.
[time=114] How can I thank you for this past year?
[time=117] For the friend you've been.
[time=119] You've always stood firm, you've never wavered.
[time=122] - I know it's been a long time since we've seen each other.
[time=125] For some reason, I've been thinking about old acquaintances lately.
[time=128] - Yeah, it's me.
[time=130] Surprise.
[time=131] No, I haven't fallen off the face of the earth.
[time=134] Although at times, I've wondered if you have.
[time=137] - I write to you from a prison in Jerusalem where I'm being held for preaching Jesus Christ to the Gentiles.
[time=145] - It's my 37th month at Angola, but time just seems to stand still here.
[time=151] Especially on death row.
[time=154] - I've been assigned to the dungeon prison in the Roman barracks in Jerusalem.
[time=158] It's not much different than the prison in Antioch, except colder and dirtier, if that's possible.
[time=165] - I'm working the graveyard shift beginning at Angola.
[time=168] Yeah, stuck.
[time=171] And what a hole.
[time=172] I might as well be one of the inmates.
[time=175] - I was put in chains by the Romans to keep me from being killed by an angry crowd of Jews.
[time=182] It has been several hours since sunset and I continue to hear the shouting and crying above me in the streets.
[time=189] Sometimes I marvel at the anger still in the world.
[time=195] - There was a riot yesterday.
[time=196] You probably heard about it in the news.
[time=199] Strange.
[time=200] No one was trying to escape.
[time=202] Three guys just went berserk.
[time=205] Nine more ended up dead.
[time=207] With all the pent up hate and anger around here, I guess I should be surprised it doesn't happen more often.
[time=214] - And now is if things weren't black enough, another one of those itinerant holy men came through today.
[time=220] For someone who claims to only preach love, he certainly stirs up hate.
[time=225] The Romans won him exiled.
[time=227] The Jews seem to want him dead.
[time=229] - Strange.
[time=230] What a world has become when being changed in a prison is the safest place for someone.
[time=235] - And now another riot.
[time=237] I managed to keep clear, but I swear.
[time=240] I wish we'd just let the scum all kill each other off.
[time=243] The world would sure be a better place.
[time=246] - If the truth be known, my brother, I almost welcome the silence of his cell.
[time=251] I even welcome the shackles.
[time=254] Sometimes God must force me to be still and examine a storm that always seems to swirl around me.
[time=262] And how fitting it is to lift my hands to him and feel the weight of earthly chains, knowing I have long ago been set free from the sin of my life through Christ Jesus.
[time=280] - In your last letter, you asked if the solitude and endless rows of steel bars ever got to me.
[time=286] In all honesty, I must tell you no, not anymore.
[time=291] I don't mind the separation from the world.
[time=294] The world and what I did with it is how I got here.
[time=297] Funny, but even the bars seem to remind me that I'm free from all that now, ever since you helped me find Jesus last year.
[time=307] - There is this prisoner that both the Romans and Jews seem to hate.
[time=311] Paul is his name, I believe.
[time=314] And not only do I have the scumb to contend with, but also certified fruit cakes, like this one guy named Ray.
[time=322] - There's no one else in the prison tonight, except the jailer.
[time=328] - There's been a new guy to sign to my cell block.
[time=331] - What a strange man he is.
[time=333] - Absolutely crazy.
[time=335] - He seems so sad and so alone.
[time=340] - He's very bitter and full of rage, just like I used to be.
[time=344] - He came to the jail willingly.
[time=347] He even blessed those that put the shackles on.
[time=350] Most prisoners cursed and yelled the entire time about getting out, but this Paul is strangely quiet, almost content.
[time=358] Sometimes I honestly wonder if he knows where he is.
[time=362] - I quit trying to figure Ray out.
[time=364] I mean, here's a guy who's got nobody on the outside.
[time=368] He shoots somebody during a robbery, gets first degree, and now has maybe three months left.
[time=374] But every morning when I check on him, he seems almost happy, like he's looking forward to something crazy.
[time=382] Absolutely great.
[time=383] This place must be getting to both of us.
[time=385] - I've tried to talk to this jailer, but I'm not sure how much he's heard.
[time=393] - Having a conversation with this guy is almost impossible, but I keep trying.
[time=398] - This prisoner keeps telling me about a man who came and took the punishment for my sins.
[time=403] He even died for me.
[time=405] This Paul said there is no condemnation for those who believe this man.
[time=410] I've never even met him.
[time=412] But how can that be?
[time=413] - Now how can this be?
[time=415] This jive Ray keeps handing me about some guy a long time ago for giving all the trash I've heaped onto my life.
[time=422] Some guy I don't even know loving me.
[time=425] In spite of everything, no condemnation Ray said.
[time=429] Yeah, right.
[time=430] That ain't the way justice in this world is doled out.
[time=433] - I wish I could help sometimes I feel so trapped.
[time=439] - Remember him.
[time=446] - Pray for him.
[time=446] - No, it's a little matter to anyone.
[time=448] - Well, who gives a rep?
[time=449] Nobody I know.
[time=450] - So my dear brother, until I am able to write again.
[time=456] - Well, I'd better be going.
[time=457] - I must be turned to my watch.
[time=459] Perhaps this year I will hear from you.
[time=461] - That's it, I guess.
[time=462] Call some time if you remember.
[time=465] - Please greet the brethren in the abundant love of the Lord Jesus.
[time=468] - In the amazing love of our Lord.
[time=471] - Until another time.
[time=472] - Later.
[time=473] - Grace.
[time=474] - Peace be with you.
[time=475] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 255 seconds]
[time=747] [APPLAUSE]
[time=755] I wanted it just before we get going this morning.
[time=757] I just couldn't wait to share with you something that we've been kind of just working on the last -- God's been working on this for the last couple of years.
[time=765] We've been kind of trying to put it together as a visual for you for the last couple of weeks and we get a chance to share it with you today.
[time=773] Now, you hear us say this often, and you probably won't hear us stop saying it for a long, long time, people,
[time=781] and that is that we are giving our lives.
[time=783] We are giving our days and our nights, and with every ounce of energy God will grant this place
[time=789] as trying its best with His help.
[time=792] To help seekers, both saved and searching, find and then follow Christ.
[time=798] And it's a very important thing, I think, to teach that, and we do that, and we will keep doing that.
[time=804] It's one thing to do our best as leaders and as faithful followers of Christ to model that.
[time=810] But you know what?
[time=811] It's also extremely important that for His sake and for our sake, for encouragement's sake,
[time=818] for a perspective's sake, it's also a really good thing to celebrate it when it happens.
[time=823] And I want to just give you a chance to celebrate.
[time=826] I want to give you a chance to say thank you, God, for what you're doing in our midst.
[time=830] And we're going to do that with kind of an illustration here.
[time=833] And I want you to know this isn't about those participating.
[time=836] They represent simply a microcosm of what God is doing in a lot of other places in this family as well.
[time=845] But I want you to be encouraged.
[time=847] I'm going to start it like this.
[time=849] Bill and Linda Archer, going to ask them if they'd come.
[time=852] And Bill and Linda, they're going to stand right here, right up here on this top step on this top edge of the platform.
[time=860] Bill and Linda Archer have been around, been a part of.
[time=865] They have been exercising their gifts, loving this family and being a part of what God was doing here at this church for a lot of years.
[time=876] And we'll just leave it at a lot of years, all right.
[time=878] And we're so thankful, so thankful.
[time=880] Many of you have been encouraged.
[time=882] Many of you have been led to the Lord.
[time=884] Many of you have been taught God's Word in different settings, in different places by these two.
[time=889] And they have from the very beginning believed in their hearts that God wanted to do great things in this family.
[time=896] They were willing a couple of years ago, along with Doug and Tammy Crane, who I'm going to ask if they'd come up.
[time=903] And you guys kind of come up here and hug the edge of the stage, just like I do.
[time=906] And the Doug and Tammy come stand right next to them.
[time=908] A couple of years ago, Doug and Tammy Crane, who have been a part of this family for not as many years, but about 10, 9, somewhere in there.
[time=918] They really believed in their hearts, still due today, that God wants to and is committed to doing really amazing things in this family.
[time=928] So a few years ago, there was a Sunday morning, and you may remember this, where, and we talked about this for a couple, two or three weeks prior to in Russell, in that service announced that there was an insert in the bulletin.
[time=939] And everybody was looking into the bulletin, and in that insert, it actually said, and it was the first time we had ever done this.
[time=946] I mean, since I had been here, we had never kind of been this bold, but we actually said, in the insert, if you're a seeker, you don't know the Lord.
[time=955] You're kind of in that journey somewhere.
[time=958] Would you mark this box?
[time=960] And then there was another box for them to mark that if, as a seeker, they would actually be willing to get involved in a seeker small group, a gathering of some folks that were interested in exploring the claims of God's Word, understanding how truth integrated with life.
[time=976] Would you mark this box?
[time=978] And so that Sunday came and went, the cards got turned in, it was Monday morning, we're in there in the office, and we've actually got a little stack of inserts that got turned in that were marked.
[time=991] I'm a seeker, I want to be in a seeker small group.
[time=995] We couldn't believe it.
[time=997] We sat there, and we looked at each other, and we said, you mean there are actually seekers here?
[time=1002] I mean, they're coming, we couldn't believe it.
[time=1005] Now, this might not be a shock to you, because you know me and kind of how him and how that kind of worked.
[time=1010] We didn't really have a plan for the seekers.
[time=1014] We were just excited that they were there.
[time=1017] And so that stack of cards sat on his desk for about four weeks, and every day we'd walk into that office and see that stack going in that crate.
[time=1027] We got a stack, it seems so cool.
[time=1029] This is great, they're actually here.
[time=1031] Well, then Doug Blusseshart, being the administratively gifted person that he is, very graciously said to us, you know, you guys kind of get with it here.
[time=1040] We got to do this.
[time=1042] And so Doug and Tammy and Bill and Linda were willing to kind of as a team start that kind of first seeker small group.
[time=1050] And those people in that stack, they were still four weeks later wondering when in the world the call was going to come, that they were willing.
[time=1060] Part of that group was Drake Hughes.
[time=1065] And Drake's going to come up.
[time=1067] And as the group started, Drake actually already knew the Lord.
[time=1073] He was married, and his wife at that time didn't.
[time=1078] But Drake already knew the Lord and was really interested in learning more, but wanted to see what God might be doing.
[time=1083] And so Drake was, Drake Hughes was a part of that group.
[time=1086] Some guys, that way, good to see Drake.
[time=1089] And then, and he had come to know the Lord a little while before.
[time=1093] Then right before this, Monica Rabe had come to know the Lord just very recently before the group started.
[time=1100] So Monica, maybe in the four weeks that we had let her, you know, just kind of blown her off.
[time=1104] I'm not quite sure when that was, but Monica came to know the Lord and then the group started.
[time=1111] And these people were just committed to getting together each week and talking about the real issues of life, the real truth of God's Word, and how those things came together.
[time=1122] And lovingly, like good shepherds, Bill and Linda and Doug and Tammy kind of led those discussions.
[time=1127] Well, before you know it, Danielle Connolly.
[time=1132] Kathy, excuse me, wait, sorry, Danielle, sit down.
[time=1137] My fault. Before you know it, Kathy Hughes, Drake's wife, comes to faith in Christ.
[time=1145] She hears it, she sees it, begins to make sense, come on up.
[time=1148] And you've actually met Kathy before.
[time=1150] We did an interview with Kathy about a year and a half ago up here on stage.
[time=1154] And come on up and stand next to, there you go.
[time=1157] And so as this thing got started, Kathy comes to faith in Christ, gives her life to the Lord.
[time=1163] And now you've got Kathy and Drake together.
[time=1166] Then, little ways on down fast forward, we're continuing to meet, we're continuing to discuss, continuing to pray.
[time=1174] Then Danielle Connolly comes to a point where she is convinced in her heart of Christ's love.
[time=1180] Danielle, come on up. Yes, now you can come up.
[time=1183] Keep screwing down that way a little bit.
[time=1185] And Danielle comes to a point, remember when it was, when was it?
[time=1188] February 20th.
[time=1189] February 20th. February 20th. She comes to a point where she says, you know what, I want to give my life to Christ.
[time=1197] I want to draw a line in the sand, put a stake in the ground and say, I believe and I want to give you my life.
[time=1203] And so she did. And they celebrated. And we were kind of hearing about this and we were celebrating as well.
[time=1210] Then kind of fast forward to this kind of this spring.
[time=1215] And a great thing had happened. The group had kind of come to an end. They had taken a break.
[time=1221] And then they had kind of gotten jump-started again.
[time=1223] And in the jump-start, Kebra and I, along with Stephen Beth Wilde, had to have the privilege of kind of joining the group.
[time=1230] And it came to be about maybe a few, two, three, four weeks before Easter.
[time=1235] And to our amazement and our absolute and utter joy, Dan Rabe, shared with us one night in our group,
[time=1243] that having listened, having heard, having been worked with, having been encouraged and prayed for.
[time=1248] He had come to a point where he was really truly ready to give his life to Christ.
[time=1253] And he did, excepted Christ a couple of few months ago. And I want Dan to come on up.
[time=1258] And so now you have the archers and you have the cranes.
[time=1264] You got Drake and Kathy Hughes. You got Dan and Monica Rabe. You got Danielle Connolly.
[time=1269] And now we're waiting on somebody. Now we're praying for Danielle's husband, Jobe.
[time=1275] Jobe's a good man. And it has been an absolute joy to get to know him.
[time=1279] And of all the people I've ever seen wrestle with faith, Jobe's one, I think, who wrestled with it in an intimate, genuine, honest way.
[time=1289] And as he wrestled and as we talked and as the group came alongside, good Friday, is that right?
[time=1295] Good Friday. This past, good Friday, just several weeks ago. Jobe said, "You know what? I'm in.
[time=1302] I'm going to give my life to Jesus. I want to serve him with all my heart." Come on up, Jobe. And Jobe accepted Christ.
[time=1310] And it's, I don't know what that looks like to you.
[time=1323] But I know what it looks, I know what it looks like to me.
[time=1326] To me, I see a bunch of really good people who today, you know, their attorneys have been altered.
[time=1333] Life has been changed. Truth has been embraced.
[time=1338] And God used this place. God used you. God used us to create a setting whereby that could happen.
[time=1346] And that is an amazing thing, folks. But don't forget this.
[time=1350] You got a stage full of adults, but I asked them to bring their kids, because this is the part that really gets me.
[time=1357] The part that really gets me is that mom and dad, mom and dads across the stage now, all have faith.
[time=1366] Mom and dads to a person up here have given their lives to Christ.
[time=1370] And three years ago, you know, they hadn't.
[time=1374] And you don't need me to stand here and tell you where these little ones, we got Olivia down here.
[time=1382] We got Michael right there. We've got Sidney and Henry and Moore's Mark, and we got Seth.
[time=1392] You guys understand, don't you? What this means for them?
[time=1396] You guys understand what this means for their future? No guarantees, I understand.
[time=1400] But you understand, they've got a chance today that they didn't have two years ago.
[time=1406] And that absolutely thrills my soul. And I hope it thrills yours as well.
[time=1412] Amen. Doug, why don't you just grab a mic there and pray and we'll let these good kids and diligent parents get to nurseries and calm this again.
[time=1424] Thanks, you guys, so much. Go ahead, Doug. Let's pray.
[time=1428] Wow, God, you are truly a good and a great God.
[time=1433] And to be part of this little process here, and then as Kelly said, all the other little processes that are going on just like this in this body.
[time=1444] It's truly amazing to sit back and see you work.
[time=1448] And we thank you for that. We thank you for your goodness, your faithfulness to pursue people and to bring them to yourself.
[time=1455] And we thank you for these lives that are represented here today and for the chance to be part of something really cool that this church does that we can just celebrate today.
[time=1468] So if we do that, we give you all the honor and all the glory and all the praise. In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1475] Last week in our study from the Book of Acts, we were reminded that whenever God closes a door, he opens another.
[time=1483] It might be a slight variation of the door you or I thought we were going to go through, or it could be, and oftentimes is a radically different door, not even close to resembling what we thought it would look like.
[time=1497] But in time we saw, in time we learned, in his time, and in his place, he opens new doors.
[time=1509] Question for you this morning. All right? Question for you this morning.
[time=1513] Because I know many of you, almost all of us in the room this morning have gone down these roads where we thought we believed in our hearts we were going here and God opens other doors over here.
[time=1525] Question for you this morning. What if the new door? What if the redirect that God did with you?
[time=1533] What if this is a divinely appointed, better option? What if it brings to your life trial?
[time=1541] What if the new door, what if the better, divinely appointed option that he kind of redirects and leads you through, brings to your life pain, brings to your life confusion, brings to your life heartache?
[time=1553] What if the new job, the new future, the new friend or the new ministry brings all of the above? Then what?
[time=1563] What will your response be? How will you respond? What's your attitude going to be like?
[time=1568] Will trust and faith be escalated? Or will trust and faith be diminished?
[time=1575] Last week in the first several verses of Acts 16 Paul and his team got divinely redirected. Paul and his team we saw in those first few verses in Acts 16 they got turned away from a place they wanted deeply to go into and minister.
[time=1593] They got turned away from Asia and instead God had led them through the vision there in verse 9 to Macedonia. And as we'll see today, this new door, this better, divinely appointed option that God opens.
[time=1608] What you'll see and we'll see together this morning is that it leads them to one of the most painful faith stretching experiences of their young ministry lives.
[time=1618] And I want to invite you this morning to watch and learn as Paul and his team remind us of four very important truths.
[time=1626] Truths to keep in mind when walking through doors, four very important truths when it comes to walking through these doors that God leads us to.
[time=1636] Number one, I want to draw your attention to Acts 16 verse 11, walking through new doors requires wisdom. Walking through new doors requires wisdom and I want to add to that sensitivity to the Holy Spirit.
[time=1651] Acts 16, pick it up in verse 11, it says, "Therefore, you with me therefore putting out to see from Troas, we ran a straight course to Samothrace and on the day following the Neothilus and from there to Philippi which is a leading city of the district of Macedonia, a Roman colony, and we were staying in this city for some days.
[time=1676] And on the Sabbath day, we went outside the gate to a riverside where we were supposing that there would be a place of prayer and we sat down and began speaking to the women who had a symbol.
[time=1687] And a certain woman named Lydia from the city of Thyatira, a cellar of purple fabrics, a worshiper of God was listening and the Lord opened her heart to respond to the things spoken by Paul.
[time=1701] And when she and her husband had been baptized, she urged us saying, "If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and stay," and she prevailed upon us.
[time=1714] Walking through new doors requires wisdom and a sensitivity to the Holy Spirit. Here's the point, go back to verse 9.
[time=1722] They wanted to go to Asia. They wanted to preach the gospel in new places where it had not yet gone and as they come to Asia, God divinely turns them away.
[time=1733] It says there in verse 7 and when they had come to Mysia, they were trying to go into Befinia and the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them.
[time=1742] And passing by Mysia, they came to Troas, verse 9. Here you go. And a vision appeared to Paul in the night. A certain, what's your Bible saying?
[time=1751] A certain what? Say it louder. Man. A certain man of Macedonia was standing and appealing to him and saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us."
[time=1763] And when he had seen the vision immediately, we sought to go into Macedonia concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.
[time=1772] Walking through new doors, people requires wisdom and sensitivity to the Holy Spirit. You and I would have been charging through, I will speak for me, I would have been charging through Macedonia looking for what? A man.
[time=1787] I would have had both barrels loaded, hard on fire, charging through Macedonia looking for a man. Yet Paul wisely alters his methods to match the situations God leads him into.
[time=1801] Question for you today. Are you walking through any new doors these days? Has God done a redirect?
[time=1809] Has God said in some way, some shaped some form, no to this and kind of divinely led you over here and now you sense him leading you through and into new opportunities?
[time=1819] Word of wisdom for you. Stay flexible. Stay flexible and stay closely connected to the Holy Spirit.
[time=1829] Stay flexible, people. As he leads you through new doors and stay closely and intimately connected to the Holy Spirit.
[time=1839] What do I mean by that? You may have thought the new job would be like this.
[time=1843] Maybe you thought you were going to work here. God says, "No, you're going to work over here." And so you say, "Fine." So now I'm coming to this new job and this new opportunity and you thought in your mind based upon interviews, based upon this or that you thought the new job was going to entail going to be like this.
[time=1859] And now as you go through this new door, you realize, you know what it is and anything like that at all. In fact, it's completely different from anything I had ever imagined.
[time=1867] But God seems to be using me. God seems to have a plan.
[time=1871] You may have thought he was moving you towards this decision.
[time=1875] You may have thought and sensed in your heart that he was moving you towards this decision for this reason.
[time=1882] And so as you go towards this decision, you find out that in fact it was the right decision, but it wasn't for that reason at all.
[time=1890] You ever experienced that? Anybody?
[time=1893] You realize as you walk in obedience to this new door he calls you to, the reasoning once you get there is completely different than what you thought.
[time=1904] It was about.
[time=1907] I thought, me, Kelly, I thought, Kevin and I were going to have four kids.
[time=1915] And we thought, God thought we were going to have four kids.
[time=1922] And we prayed about that and talked about that and wrestled with that and you know what, we just felt such an absolute sense of peace.
[time=1928] We were going to have four kids.
[time=1930] And went and, you know, went through the procedure and all that stuff and really felt good about it.
[time=1941] And found out several weeks ago that Kevin was like seven months pregnant.
[time=1947] Yeah, oh, clap, clap in a second. I'm going to get there.
[time=1953] You can clap later, but we'll get at the guy who explains something to you there.
[time=1957] There was a sense, you know, in my heart, same thing we were just saying there.
[time=1962] There's a sense as you go through that where you're thinking in your mind you've really thought it through.
[time=1967] You've really given it prayer and you've really gone and done the right thing.
[time=1971] And so you go down that road and I'll never forget about seven weeks ago.
[time=1975] She came out into the living room and she said, you know, I don't know how to say this to you, but I'm sick.
[time=1980] I'm really, really sick.
[time=1983] And I said, wow, what should we get for you? And she says, well, why don't you go to Walgreens and get a pregnancy test?
[time=1992] And you've got to understand something.
[time=1994] When you have so, maybe you understand how I'm saying this.
[time=1997] When you have so mentally checked out of an arena, you can't even get back there.
[time=2003] And I looked at her like, what are you saying?
[time=2007] And so I'm laughing saying, what are you saying? She's kind of hunched over the back of the recliner like she's going to puke.
[time=2014] And she says, I'm not kidding.
[time=2017] And so I went to Walgreens and we did that whole thing and it's one of those tests where, you know, it's like two lines if it's positive and one line if it's negative.
[time=2025] And you could have put these two lines on a highway. They were that bright and big.
[time=2030] And, you know, I went in the tank. We both of us went in the tank for a couple of days.
[time=2036] Now, hear me. I realize kids are a blessing.
[time=2039] They are precious and we understand that.
[time=2042] And yet we're learning some lessons and we admit that to you.
[time=2046] There were a couple, two, three, four days there where it wasn't a blessing because we had become so convinced that we understood God's plan.
[time=2056] And as you walk through new doors, we thought the new door was the rest of our life with four kids.
[time=2062] All right. God says, no, the new door is five.
[time=2067] And as the days have gone by and as the weeks have gone by, we're learning this. Stay flexible, people.
[time=2073] And stay connected to the Holy Spirit because the Holy Spirit has been ministering to us in a huge way.
[time=2079] And today, you know, I joke with her. I wake up each morning. I have this reoccurring nightmare going on.
[time=2084] I don't know where we are, but there's this voice and it's just calling out Bird Party of Seven, Bird Party of Seven.
[time=2095] And many of you have seven and eight and nine and, you know, even more.
[time=2099] And I realize we realize that it's doable and God's grace is amazing and he's going to get us through all this.
[time=2104] But we're just kind of catching up. But we are thankful, but he's teaching us.
[time=2108] And he wants to teach you the same thing. You do not have it figured out.
[time=2113] Stay flexible. Stay connected to the Holy Spirit. Be wise and look for God at work and where you see him at work.
[time=2124] Join him. And so we're in now. We're joining him. We're going to do this thing.
[time=2129] We thought he was done working in certain areas, but obviously he wasn't. So on we go.
[time=2135] Number two, every step, every step we take forward, every step we take forward through new doors, the enemy will bring resistance.
[time=2146] Pick it up in verse 16. And it happened that as we were going to the place of prayer,
[time=2152] a certain slave girl having a spirit of divination met us. She's possessed.
[time=2157] Who was bringing her masters much profit by fortune telling. Following after Paul and us, she kept crying out saying,
[time=2166] "These men are bond servants of the most. High God, who are proclaiming to you the way of salvation."
[time=2173] And she continued doing this for many days.
[time=2177] But Paul was greatly annoyed and turned and said to the spirit. You see that? Not to the girl.
[time=2185] But to the spirit, I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her and it came out at that very moment.
[time=2197] I don't think you need me to stand here this morning and tell you this. I think you, most of you, understand.
[time=2202] And have since been seen that this is so very true with every positive step, with every good step, with every ministry that begins to get started in game moment.
[time=2214] And with every new strategy that begins to be implemented, as you and I make personal commitments in our lives to go in this direction now instead of that.
[time=2223] It seems as if, at least in my own experience of life and ministry, that every time we want to, and you want to take new steps in good directions,
[time=2234] He is right there with a corresponding counterattack.
[time=2241] Things that we want to see done to help bring love and guidance, care and encouragement to people.
[time=2248] He is there with a corresponding counterattack.
[time=2255] You finally get that one ministry. I can't say too much about this, but it's a true story, and it's happening right here in our own midst.
[time=2266] I have for years in my heart wanted to see a certain ministry offered in this place for a certain people, good people who just are facing an enormous challenge.
[time=2281] Real struggle, battles you wouldn't believe.
[time=2285] And I wanted so desperately, and we prayed, and we thought, and we talked, and finally, finally about a year ago, we had the shock.
[time=2294] We had the opportunity to birth this new ministry. It was very, very low key.
[time=2299] It was very, very back in the background, and it needed to be, but it started.
[time=2304] And you have no idea, maybe you do. You know that sense you get when you want it so desperately and so deeply to see something happen.
[time=2313] They could not just advance the kingdom, but bring hope again to struggling people who are almost hopeless in their fight, in their battle with whatever issue it might be.
[time=2326] And no sooner had this gotten started, but four or five, six months down the road, just hit a huge bump.
[time=2337] Hit a huge bump, and the whole thing kind of got dismantled. And we're still trying today to kind of pick up the pieces, and maybe someday down the road, be able to offer it again.
[time=2349] You could never convince me. You could never convince me that that wasn't the enemy. You could never convince me that he wasn't thoroughly and completely thrilled at the turmoil and the discouragement and the feelings that were caused as that thing kind of came to a screeching halt.
[time=2372] People don't forget walking through new doors, whatever it might be. It will always be. It will many, many times be a battle, and it will be a battle, and there will be counter attacks and counter punches and all kinds of things coming your way in our way, because he's out there.
[time=2390] And don't ever forget it. We don't talk a whole lot about it, but it's true. And the Word of God speaks to it directly. Flip over to Ephesians 2.
[time=2399] Just a quick reminder to everybody. And whether you're here this morning and you're still seeking, you're still searching, trying to figure out this thing called truth and faith, or whether you've crossed over that line, entered into a relationship with the living God, whether you're searching or whether you're already convinced, this is something you need to be reminded of again and again.
[time=2423] He is out there. The stakes are high, and the battle rages. Look at Ephesians 2. It says there in Ephesians 2, verse 1, and you were dead, Paul says. You were dead in your prior to knowing Christ.
[time=2436] He says you were dead in your trespasses and sins, in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the heir, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience.
[time=2450] He is the prince of the power of the heir, the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience. Go back to 1 Peter, back towards the back of your New Testament, past the book of James, to 1 Peter 5. Peter had some things to say. Peter had a reminder for all of us as it related to the enemy.
[time=2470] It says in 1 Peter 5, verse 8, it says there be of sober spirit, be of sober spirit, be on the alert, and otherwise, don't be distracted, don't be diminished in your capacities, be focused, be careful, be cautious, be sober in spirit, be on the alert.
[time=2496] Why? Because your adversary, the devil, prowls about like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour.
[time=2506] It's really true. He is a roaring, roaring lion. Interesting use of that word there. I always wondered. I always thought it would say prowls about quietly. Does he prowl about quietly?
[time=2529] No. I mean, I guess in some ways you could say he does, but think about it. He's out there in clear view, people. And when do lions roar anyway, before the kill or after? After. He's eating folks left and right. And he is roaring.
[time=2551] And he is an adversary. And he is after you. And he is after me. He is after doing everything he can to squelch and diminish our efforts.
[time=2560] This picture up here on this stage this morning, these families and these kids coming to faith in Christ bummed him out. Not a good morning for him in that sense.
[time=2572] Don't forget for every step you take, he brings a counter attack. So number three, as the battle rages, hang on to hope, folks. Hang on to hope.
[time=2582] Hanging on to hope brings his best. Watch how this unfolds. Go back to Acts 16. Hang on to hope. Don't ever let go of hope.
[time=2592] For when you and I are willing as a people to hang on to hope, God's best. God's plan. God's goodness. In time, in his place, through his circumstances, it comes. Watch what happens here, verse 19.
[time=2608] But when her masters saw this gal, he cast the demon out of this gal. And in essence, kind of diminishes her capacity to make money for these guys who were abusing her.
[time=2618] And when her masters, verse 19, saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the authorities.
[time=2626] And when they had brought them to the chief magistrates, they said these men are throwing our city into confusion being Jews and are proclaiming customs which is not lawful for us to accept or to observe being Romans.
[time=2639] And the crowd rose up together against them. Sound familiar? Here we go again.
[time=2644] And the chief magistrates tore their robes off them and proceeded to order them to be beaten with rods.
[time=2652] And when they had inflicted many blows upon them and threw them into prison, commanding the jailer to guard them securely.
[time=2660] And he, having received such a command, threw them into the inner prison which would have been solitary confinement and fastened their feet in the stocks.
[time=2670] But about midnight, Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns of praise to God.
[time=2677] When the prisoners were listening to them and suddenly, verse 26, there came a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison house were shaken.
[time=2686] And immediately all the doors were opened and everyone's chains were unfastened.
[time=2691] And when the jailer had been roused out of sleep and had seen the prison doors opened, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself.
[time=2699] Supposing that the prisoners had escaped because you'll remember back in 23 they said guard these guys, guard them securely.
[time=2707] And he understood his life was on the line.
[time=2711] He sees the open doors, he assumes they're gone.
[time=2716] But Paul, verse 28, cried out with a loud boy saying, "Do yourself no harm, for we are all here."
[time=2724] And he called for lights, the jailer did and rushed in and trembling with fear he fell down before Paul and Silas.
[time=2732] And after he brought them out, he said, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
[time=2740] And they said, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household." And they spoke the word of the Lord to him together with all who were in his house.
[time=2749] And he took them that very hour of the night and washed their wounds.
[time=2754] You see that?
[time=2756] Few verses before he had inflicted those wounds.
[time=2761] Now the power of God transforming nature of salvation.
[time=2766] Now he's washing, now he's tending to their wounds.
[time=2772] And immediately he was baptized, he and all his household.
[time=2776] And he brought them into his house and set food before them and rejoiced greatly.
[time=2780] Having believed in God with his whole household.
[time=2785] Let's get right to it.
[time=2787] Paul and Silas, you guys, Paul and Silas, just like you, just like me.
[time=2796] In so many of the situations that we encounter and find ourselves in are probably not as severe as theirs.
[time=2804] People, Paul and Silas had every reason to give and to doubt and despair.
[time=2809] But hope, hope, hope led them to trust, the unseen hand of God.
[time=2817] Hope led them to trust, don't miss that.
[time=2820] Hope led them to trust, the unseen hand of God.
[time=2827] Hope.
[time=2830] What's hope?
[time=2834] Hope is, hope is what?
[time=2839] Hope is, somebody finished that for me, several of you.
[time=2844] Come on.
[time=2845] What's hope?
[time=2847] Loud.
[time=2848] Somebody.
[time=2852] Believing in things unseen.
[time=2856] Trusting in the unseen hand of God.
[time=2860] How do you know it's there?
[time=2862] How do you know he's going to bring good?
[time=2864] How do you know he will uphold you?
[time=2868] Because I believe in the unseen, good, sovereign, perfect hand of God.
[time=2875] Hope is believing in thing.
[time=2878] What else is hope?
[time=2879] Somebody said something over here.
[time=2881] Real loud.
[time=2888] Adopted by God.
[time=2892] That's great.
[time=2894] Adopted by God.
[time=2896] Taken into, taken into the family.
[time=2899] Cherished.
[time=2900] Loved.
[time=2902] Not just some number.
[time=2903] Not just some thing down on earth.
[time=2905] Adopted, embraced fully by God, to be loved, to be cared for, to be nurtured.
[time=2913] Hope.
[time=2914] You guys, think about it.
[time=2917] What is it?
[time=2918] What does it look like?
[time=2919] How do you exercise it?
[time=2920] Hope led them to trust the unseen hand of God.
[time=2924] And when you hold on to hope, and I've seen it a hundred times if I've seen it once, maybe you have to.
[time=2930] When you hold on to hope, when somebody really holds on to hope, it's an amazing thing.
[time=2936] Hope.
[time=2937] You know what it does?
[time=2938] When you hold on to hope, it penetrates and permeates every part of your being.
[time=2944] Have you seen that?
[time=2946] Have you talked with somebody?
[time=2947] Have you bumped into an individual?
[time=2949] And you hear their circumstance and you hear what they're going through and yet you look in their eyes?
[time=2954] And there's something in their face.
[time=2956] There's something in the way they carry themselves.
[time=2959] Hope does an amazing thing.
[time=2962] Hope penetrates and permeates one's entire spirit.
[time=2968] And it's a great, great thing to see.
[time=2971] And it's as discouraging and as sad to see the eyes of one who has let go.
[time=2978] And maybe you have seen that.
[time=2979] Maybe you have observed.
[time=2980] Maybe that's you this morning.
[time=2981] Maybe you would finally just flat out say, you know what, I've given up hope.
[time=2989] And there is no sparkle.
[time=2991] There is no gleam.
[time=2993] There is no sense of anticipation.
[time=2995] And the eye of one who has let it go.
[time=2998] Remember this.
[time=2999] The Philippian jailer was led to Christ by Paul and Silas' good attitude.
[time=3005] In the midst of where they were, they had a great attitude.
[time=3009] Your spirit was still clinging to hope.
[time=3012] And with hope comes the opportunity for God to do his best.
[time=3017] Question free this morning.
[time=3018] Where would your attitude be honest?
[time=3020] Where would your attitude in that situation have led that jailer?
[time=3026] Forget the jailer and forget that situation.
[time=3028] Where will your attitude this week?
[time=3032] In whatever circumstance you may find yourself in, where will your attitude?
[time=3038] Where will your spirit and the way you carry yourself and the way you posture yourself?
[time=3044] Where will your spirit, your attitude lead those who are far from God who will see, observe,
[time=3053] and experience you this week?
[time=3059] Eric Hall, one of the guys here on staff and part of our programming team said this in a meeting
[time=3065] last week and I don't know where he got it or if it just came from his own heart, but wherever it came from it was just I felt like profound and maybe you've heard it before,
[time=3074] maybe you haven't, but he said this and I thought about Paul and I thought about Silas and I thought about me sitting in that dungeon and those guys and their zeal for ministry.
[time=3085] And I thought about how I would have been so discouraged and so ticked that I wasn't getting
[time=3091] to do what I had been called to do.
[time=3094] I mean go lock me in a room right now and don't let me show up here tomorrow morning and I'd be going nuts.
[time=3103] And Eric said this, Eric said we've got to always remember what God wants to do in us
[time=3110] is always so much more important than what he wants to do through us.
[time=3117] You understand that?
[time=3119] You say amen to that?
[time=3121] It's true you guys, you and I get so caught up sometimes and what we think he wants to
[time=3128] do through us and sometimes he just wants to do a work in us.
[time=3136] And when we allow him, when we hold on to hope in the midst of a difficult new door, when we hold on to hope God's best gets to be accomplished.
[time=3147] And oftentimes that's just because of what he did in us while we held on to hope.
[time=3154] These guys sang hymns, these guys, they were singing praises to God as they allowed God
[time=3161] in them to encourage and remind them and their attitude.
[time=3166] They didn't give a message.
[time=3168] Paul didn't jump up on some, but there was no sermon given.
[time=3172] This guy comes to Christ because of their spirit, because of their attitude in the midst of all that they faced.
[time=3181] Hold on to hope.
[time=3183] Lastly, I want to say this, when God wins, when God wins, when God brings you through new doors,
[time=3193] when you hold on to hope, and when God's best comes, when God wins, it's clear.
[time=3200] Having obediently walked through a very difficult door, God allows the team a chance to hold their heads high.
[time=3207] And at the same time send a very clear message.
[time=3210] Look what it says there.
[time=3212] Now the day came, the chief magistrate sent their policemen saying release those men.
[time=3217] And the jailer reported these words to Paul saying the chief magistrates have sent to release you.
[time=3223] Now therefore come out and go in peace, but Paul said to them, I love this about Paul.
[time=3227] They have beaten us in public without trial, men who are Romans and have thrown us into the prison.
[time=3233] And now, are they sending us away secretly?
[time=3236] I don't think so.
[time=3238] He says, no indeed, but let them come themselves and bring us out.
[time=3244] And the policeman reported these words to the chief magistrates and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans.
[time=3251] And they came and appealed to them, and when they had brought them out, they kept begging them to leave the city.
[time=3257] And I love verse 40, because all of a sudden you realize that we're on Paul's time, not theirs.
[time=3262] We're on God's time.
[time=3264] And when they went out of the prison, they entered the house of Lydia.
[time=3267] Did they leave right away? No, they went to Lydia's house.
[time=3270] And there they saw the brethren, and they encouraged them and departed.
[time=3277] They held their heads high at the same time, sent a very clear message.
[time=3282] And the message was this, we will do His will.
[time=3284] Is this your message?
[time=3287] Their message was, we will do His will in His place and in His time with everything we have, and you cannot deter us.
[time=3295] They learned some lessons, maybe summed up best in an old Irish blessing that goes like this, even if the road crumbles before you, or the wind is at your face, if the sun beats hot upon you,
[time=3307] or the storms destroy your fields, if we never meet again, remember God's love, holds us in the palm of His hand.
[time=3316] And that reminds me of Psalm 91.
[time=3319] Then let me ask if you would just kind of bow your heads, close your eyes and listen.
[time=3325] And I ask the folks to come on back up.
[time=3329] And if I can, let me just read to you, Psalm 91.
[time=3336] It says in Psalm 91, "He who dwells in the shelter of the most high will abide in the shadow of the Almighty."
[time=3353] What are you facing today?
[time=3356] What are you going through?
[time=3357] What new doors is He leading you to?
[time=3360] Anything scary?
[time=3362] Anything uncertain?
[time=3365] Anything confusing?
[time=3369] Imagine how scared, down deep inside, imagine how confused these guys must have been.
[time=3375] In stocks, solitary confinement, having been beaten, and all they had done is said, "Okay, God, we'll go this way."
[time=3387] "He who dwells in the shelter of the most high will abide in the shadow of the Almighty." "I will say to the Lord my refuge in my fortress, my God in whom I trust,
[time=3398] for it is He who delivers you from the snare of the trapper and from the deadly pestilence.
[time=3404] He will cover you with his pinions and under his wings, under his wings."
[time=3410] Can you see that?
[time=3411] Can you feel it?
[time=3412] Can you sense it under his wings?
[time=3414] You may seek refuge.
[time=3416] His faithfulness is a shield and bulwark.
[time=3422] The psalmist ends Psalm 91 with these words, "Because he has loved me, therefore I will deliver him.
[time=3429] I will set him securely on high because he has known my name.
[time=3435] He will call upon me and I will answer him.
[time=3438] I will be with him in trouble.
[time=3439] I will rescue him and honor him.
[time=3442] For the long life I will satisfy him and let him behold my salvation."
[time=3449] Earlier we talked about me and my daughter and her learning to ride her bike and the need she had for me to not let go.
[time=3457] I just wanted to remind you, if there was ever a time in your life where you needed encouragement or help,
[time=3464] kind of needed some assistance getting back up on the bike, so to speak.
[time=3469] We want you to know we'd love to talk with you. Please give us a phone call.
[time=3473] Write us a note or better yet come by on a Sunday morning.
[time=3477] If there was any way at all that we could help bring that sense of confidence and encouragement into your life,
[time=3485] we'd love to help you out.
[time=3487] So let us know and we'll look forward to hearing from you.
[time=3499] (Pause) (Pause) (Pause) (Pause) (Pause) (Pause) (Pause)
[time=3533] (Pause)
