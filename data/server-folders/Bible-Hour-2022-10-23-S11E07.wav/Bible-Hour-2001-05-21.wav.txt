[time=24] It wasn't too long ago that my five-year-old daughter and I were out on the street in front
[time=37] of our house the day had come for her to learn how to ride her bike without her training wheels.
[time=42] And after several incredibly unsuccessful attempts, a couple of bloody knees and a severely bruised
[time=48] sense of confidence, she looked up at me.
[time=51] And with tears in her eyes, she said this, she said, "Dad, I'll try one more time as
[time=57] long as you don't let go." And I thought, you know, isn't that how it is, as you and I attempt to face life, that
[time=65] need we have for that sense of his presence, his hand on our lives?
[time=72] And I hope that as you join us today and as you hear us sing and speak and live out the
[time=78] truth.
[time=79] I hope that there would be a greater sense of confidence in your heart, a greater sense
[time=85] of his presence as he walks through life with his hand on our backs leading, guiding, taking
[time=91] us to places that he wants us to go.
[time=109] Thank you.
[time=124] The year was 1988.
[time=130] And Kevin and I had been given the absolute privilege and it was, boy, it was an exciting
[time=136] time for me.
[time=137] It was the first chance.
[time=139] I had ever had to actually work in a church as a pastor and was working my way through seminary and was almost done and a good friend asked me if I would come and help with this small little church, but a hundred people, maybe 125.
[time=155] And for the next two years, I didn't have any kids at that point.
[time=160] And for the next two years, her and I, along with some other faithful folks, gave everything we had, we gave our hearts and we gave our days and we gave our nights, we gave our lives
[time=171] to that place and those people.
[time=173] And prayed every day and every night that God might use those efforts to somehow affect change in this small little church.
[time=181] And as the two, two and a half years went by, we saw the 125 become really, we saw most
[time=187] of them become really excited about the things of God and neighbors began to be reached
[time=193] and the church began to grow and about 375 folks, two and a half, three years later.
[time=199] And the guy I was working with there decided to leave and go take another church and in
[time=205] our hearts, in Kebronized hearts, there was nothing more we wanted to do than to stay and continue to give ourselves to those people.
[time=212] We loved them and we loved what God had let us do and ministry was for those two years
[time=218] right out of the gate.
[time=219] I mean, it was everything and more I'd ever dreamed of.
[time=223] Well, when that transition came, there was a contingent of people there in the church who kind of saw it as a window, a chance to get their old church back.
[time=232] And so they as sometimes tragically happens in churches, they mounted a campaign, they
[time=240] mounted an attack, really, no other way of saying it, against me.
[time=246] And they didn't want the new stuff, they didn't want to grow, they didn't want to go down any new roads, they just wanted their old church back.
[time=252] And the night of the, the night of the vote came.
[time=256] And it broke my heart.
[time=257] I didn't know what to do with it as I drove in the parking lot, I saw church vans being driven in and in those vans, these people had gone out and picked up folks who no longer even came to the church, but whose names were still on the rolls.
[time=270] They'd gone and gotten them to come and vote no.
[time=274] And they voted no and we got rejected that night.
[time=279] And boy was a hard thing.
[time=282] And I don't know how I even made it through that week, but I showed up the next Sunday, I mean they didn't have a pastor and I was still on the payroll and I figured well I might as well do my thing and so I studied all week long and came and Sunday morning about 20 minutes before the service, I walked into my little small office and as I opened the door the six deacons were standing in my office waiting for me.
[time=302] And they said you're fired, leave.
[time=307] We don't want you here anymore.
[time=309] And all these books and all this stuff you can come back and get it tomorrow and we'll give you a week's pay, leave.
[time=319] And so I left and boy didn't know what to think, didn't know what to feel.
[time=329] But I didn't know this, I wasn't sure, I wasn't sure about this ministry thing anymore.
[time=339] And I spent the next two years waiting tables.
[time=345] Deborah got pregnant the week after I got fired.
[time=349] And for two years I waited tables because I just, what do you do after a thing like that?
[time=356] And today in the book of Acts we'll see this guy we're becoming familiar with.
[time=361] His name's Paul.
[time=363] And he bumped into and came up against all kinds of different responses in ministry.
[time=370] And today we'll see three different responses.
[time=374] And we've seen in him all through this book and you will see today and we will see in the pages still to come, a willingness and a readiness no matter what he came across.
[time=386] And I think there were times where he was probably discouraged and there were times where he was probably sad and didn't know what to do.
[time=392] But in the end we see Paul again and again with a willingness to go where God calls him to go, to do what God calls him to do.
[time=402] And I hope for you this morning, I really do.
[time=405] I hope that whatever ministry it is he's called you to, whatever it is he has you doing in life.
[time=411] And especially today if the road is a bit rocky, the path is a bit difficult, challenging.
[time=418] I hope your heart can be encouraged.
[time=421] As we sing these songs and as you hear this morning from chapter 17, as you watch a man
[time=429] who was resilient and willing with God's help to continue to go forward.
[time=435] And that is my hope, our hope for every one of you here today.
[time=441] It may not be on the mountain high or over the stormy sea.
[time=465] It may not be at the battle's front, my Lord will have need of me.
[time=483] But if I still small voice he calls to paths I do not know, I'll answer dear Lord with
[time=505] my hand in thine, I'll go where you want me to go.
[time=518] Perhaps today there are lovely words which Jesus would have me speak.
[time=537] There may be now in the paths of sin, someone whom I should see, who'll save your if thou
[time=561] will be my guide, though dark and rugged though way.
[time=574] My voice shall echo the message sweet, I'll say would you want me to say, I'll say where
[time=596] you want me to go dear Lord, or mountain or plain or sea, I'll say what you want me
[time=615] to say dear Lord, I'll be what you want me to be.
[time=638] Every month we take a moment, on Sunday mornings and also on Wednesday nights, to just take a look at one of the ministries of our church we call it our heartbeat video.
[time=648] The idea behind that again is to just try and continue to put before your eyes and before your hearts the fact that in the arena of our four E's we're hoping and we're praying
[time=660] and we're giving ourselves to seeing God work in those ways, in evangelism, in encouragement,
[time=666] in exaltation and in equipping, there are so many things going on around this place that
[time=672] have to do with those four things, and many of you help make those things happen, and so this morning as you look at the heartbeat again our hope is that your heart would be encouraged, our hope is that maybe you might see or sense in the midst of this heartbeat
[time=686] an opportunity for you to possibly even be involved to a greater extent, and that thirdly you would pray, that as you see these things come before your eyes and your heart God would lead you to pray for these endeavors, and so this morning sit back and watch and
[time=701] see what God does in your heart as you see this month's heartbeat.
[time=725] My name is Rick Vance and I have the privilege of leading worship at the Common Ground Service on Wednesday nights, and for me it's given me an opportunity to explore some areas that
[time=736] are new to me in the area of worship leading, and more importantly to work with a team who
[time=742] I have just grown to love and respect, and I love the intimacy that it provides.
[time=748] My name is Dave Allen-Dorf and I'm a charter member of Common Ground and I've been coming since just after Labor Day.
[time=753] The best part about Wednesday nights for me is just the people that I get to share the
[time=759] stage with as a band member.
[time=762] There's no attitudes and everybody loves the Lord and we just have a blast.
[time=768] My name is Michelle Resurrection and my husband and I teach Sunday school through the Children's
[time=774] Ministries on Sundays during the worship service.
[time=777] So we heard about Common Ground and we thought that would be a good opportunity for us to
[time=783] be able to go to a worship service on Wednesday and be able to serve through the Children's Ministries and teach our beginner three class on Sundays.
[time=792] My name is Jan Workman.
[time=793] I like the smaller group.
[time=795] We voice attended the smaller church so it makes me feel more like home and just closer to the family.
[time=800] It's more of an intimate and casual time, but I think the praise team, with reculating,
[time=808] he gives a different way of being able to read from the Bible between songs and even
[time=816] us to be able to get to know some of the singers by their opportunity to share in their experience
[time=823] and their songs.
[time=825] I absolutely love Common Ground.
[time=827] I'm so glad we do it and would encourage anybody to come and be a part of it from the
[time=834] worship experience.
[time=835] You know, what God has done with Rick and our worship team on Wednesday nights, it's a great, great opportunity, a sweet time of worship to the teaching format.
[time=844] You know, because of the size of the group, the teaching is able to be a little bit more interactive and at times a little bit more personal.
[time=851] And then you couple with those two things, the fact that folks who come on Wednesday nights then get the opportunity to come back on Sundays and help meet some of the many ministry needs that exist around Blackhawk on the weekend.
[time=864] You take all of that and it is something that I think God is really using and again would encourage anyone to come and be a part of what He's doing with Common Ground.
[time=878] I hope you'll continue to pray for the Common Ground team and remember it as you're talking with folks Wednesday nights, sometimes work better for some people with work schedules and unique family situations.
[time=890] Don't forget, 645 every Wednesday night right here, Common Ground.
[time=894] Turn your Bibles if you would to Acts chapter 17, different responses, same determination.
[time=901] As the second missionary journey continues we find Paul and Silas and Timothy moving
[time=907] on from Philippi in what was a challenging, challenging, difficult experience.
[time=914] And there we see them moving on from Philippi traveling through Amphipolis and Apollonia to a place called Thessalonica.
[time=922] Paul will in time move on from Thessalonica to a place called Berea and then in time by
[time=928] the end of chapter 17 he will have come to Athens.
[time=932] And though each place will be different and though each city and its people will respond in radically different ways, one thing, and I want you to catch this as we start.
[time=943] One thing, different city, different people, different responses, what you will see here and you have seen it before and you will see it again is that though all of that will
[time=954] be different, one thing will remain the same, one thing remains constant with this man.
[time=960] The willingness and the readiness to be used of God, key phrase here, no matter what.
[time=972] The willingness, how's yours today, your willingness and your readiness to be used
[time=979] of God in whatever way he's called you and whatever direction he has pointed you, in whatever situation he has providentially placed you, we see here today in this man a readiness
[time=991] and a willingness to be used of God no matter what.
[time=999] And I shared with you earlier how very, very difficult that was for me as a young man after
[time=1005] two and a half years in ministry I was ready to just wait tables.
[time=1009] I wasn't so sure I wanted to be willing anymore, wasn't so sure I wanted to be ready, wasn't so sure that I wanted to keep walking down that road no matter what and maybe you can to some degree or another identify with those feelings.
[time=1025] Paul gives us a great, great picture, an inspiring look today at a heart that would not be broken a message that would not be silenced.
[time=1034] And right out of the gate he experiences some mom, well it's a little mixed but by and large
[time=1040] it's trouble.
[time=1042] Right out of the gate in chapter 17 we find trouble and Thessalonica.
[time=1047] Trouble and Thessalonica, look with me at chapter 17 we're going to start there in verse one and read down through the first part of verse 10.
[time=1053] Now when they had traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia they came to Thessalonica where there was a synagogue of the Jews and according to Paul's custom he went to them and for three Sabbaths reasoned with them from the Scriptures explaining and giving evidence that the Christ
[time=1069] had to suffer and rise again from the dead and saying this Jesus who I am proclaiming
[time=1075] to you is the Christ and some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas.
[time=1083] Joined Paul and Silas, I love that about the gospel.
[time=1086] I love that about the truth, it evokes that kind of response in people.
[time=1090] Paul and Silas weren't from Thessalonica people.
[time=1093] Paul and Silas were passing through.
[time=1095] Some were so responsive and some's lives and hearts were so changed they joined them.
[time=1100] It's a powerful thing when it takes root.
[time=1104] They joined Paul and Silas along with a great multitude of the God-fearing Greeks and a number of the leading women.
[time=1111] But the Jews, familiar phrase, familiar setting, familiar scene from our study so far of this
[time=1118] book but the Jews becoming jealous and taking along some wicked men from the marketplace
[time=1124] formed a mob and set the city in an uproar and coming upon the house of Jason they were
[time=1130] seeking to bring them out, them meeting Paul and Silas and his faithful band because they
[time=1136] assumed they were with this Jason guy seeking to bring them out to the people and when they did not find them they began dragging Jason and some brethren before the city authorities shouting these men who have upset the world, maybe a little bit of an overstatement don't
[time=1152] you think, these men who have upset the world have come here also and Jason has welcomed them and they all act contrary to the degrees of Caesar saying that there is another king,
[time=1163] Jesus, verse 8 and they stirred up the crowd and the city authorities who heard these things and when they had received a pledge from Jason and the others they released them.
[time=1174] First part of verse 10 and the brethren immediately, the brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas
[time=1180] away by night to Berea, immediately they get sent to Berea, some buy in, some are convinced
[time=1190] but verse 5 reminds us that the Jews had again become jealous, they hire thugs, I mean they
[time=1197] hire gangsters from the marketplace, they go down and grab a bunch of CD characters in
[time=1203] an attempt to kind of do a seek and destroy mission, trying to silence Paul once and for
[time=1209] all, he barely escapes, he gets sent out under the cover of night and you know what if it's
[time=1215] me at this point and I won't speak for you but if it's me at this point and this is happening
[time=1221] again and it's that same kind of scenario and now I'm looking back on the last couple of years and I've got the whole mark thing still lingering in my mind where I got left, I get abandoned by this kid who said he was in but he wasn't, I scroll back a little bit you know in my mind to chapter 14 at Listera where he gets stoned to death or he gets tortured
[time=1242] and laid out on the heap outside the city for dead because he'd been stoned by these
[time=1250] folks, I go back just a chapter to Philippi, I go back to being beaten with rods and imprisoned
[time=1257] in solitary confinement and this seems to be a pattern and now here we are again chapter
[time=1263] 17, evil has shown up yet again an uproar takes place, people are after me again and
[time=1271] if it's me in my heart I get the feeling I would be ready to wait tables, I'd be ready
[time=1278] to say you know I'm not sure about this, I'm not sure if I'm up for this, I'm not sure if I can endure this but look at verse 10 and the brethren immediately sent Paul and
[time=1291] Silas away by night to Berea and when they arrived they went into the synagogue of the
[time=1298] Jews, this guy is the energizer apostle, all right, he just keeps going, he just keeps
[time=1308] responding, he just keeps opening his heart, he just keeps opening his life to the call of God and wherever that call is, wherever it leads he goes and he does all he knows
[time=1319] to do and that is open his mouth, share his heart and proclaim truth because that's what God had called him to do, now I can look out here in this room this morning and I know
[time=1330] many of you and I know your calls and not many in the room this morning have the call
[time=1338] of Paul, not many of us have been called to go and to speak truth and to proclaim the Word of God and to you know but you've been called to something else, for many of you
[time=1348] in this room this morning it has to do with your family, for many of you it has to do with your workplace, for many of you it has to do with exercising faithfulness in a difficult
[time=1357] situation that God has allowed to develop in your life and so don't get lost in the application
[time=1365] here today, yeah we're talking about a missionary whose life was in danger but this same truth
[time=1372] and this same man and these principles apply to your life and mine, a willingness and a
[time=1378] readiness to be used of God no matter what, he just kept going and what he bumps into
[time=1385] in Berea is a refreshing actually, a refreshing encouraging change of climate, he got trouble
[time=1393] in Thessalonica, what he bumps into in the last part of verse 10 verse 11 and on through verse 15 is a teachable spirit, teachable in Berea, teachable in Berea it says there
[time=1404] he goes into the synagogue of the Jews verse 11 now these were more noble minded than those
[time=1411] in Thessalonica, for they received the word with great eagerness examining the scriptures
[time=1417] daily it says to see whether these things were so, many of them therefore believed along with a number of prominent Greek women and men, here you go again, verse 13 but when the
[time=1429] Jews of Thessalonica found out that the word of God had been proclaimed by Paul in Berea
[time=1435] also though 50 some miles away by foot they come there, they came there likewise agitating
[time=1444] and stirring up the crowds and then immediately the brethren sent Paul out to go as far as
[time=1450] the sea and Silas and Timothy remained there, now those who conducted Paul brought him as
[time=1458] far as Athens and receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible they departed, now I had to admit and I told the folks Wednesday night this
[time=1469] and I'll tell you this morning I have to admit in all the years that I have heard them referred to the Bereans and all the years I've heard them referred to in all the studies
[time=1480] I've done of acts of all the and all the messages that I've heard taught I don't think I ever really put it together you may have and that's good but just all these years I never did I mean in the churches I grew up and there wasn't a church I was in they didn't have a Sunday school class called the way, the Bereans and we've got a Bereans group here at Blackhawk and they're a great great bunch of folks and everywhere I've been I've heard about growing up in the church you heard about Bereans because they studied and examined the word daily, I don't think it was ever you know until this time just in these last couple of weeks that I really put it together that their careful study and examination of the scriptures which again they're known for took place prior to their salvation, it says
[time=1524] there in verse see it right there in verse 11 they received the word with great eagerness
[time=1533] examining the scriptures daily to see whether these things were so many of them therefore
[time=1539] in light of that careful study believed along with a number of prominent Greek women and men the word the word in the Greek there where it says to examine it brings with it in the
[time=1553] original text it brings with it the idea of an eager, eager aggressive look it meant
[time=1559] to sift up and down to make careful to make careful and exact research to know to understand
[time=1568] so that one might live out and this eager examination of the scriptures leads some of
[time=1574] these folks to faith and that's a wonderful thing as I was thinking about it this week
[time=1580] it just reminded me of something though and I think we got to just stop here and pause for a moment just to remind again so many of us in this room some of the room this morning
[time=1589] are still trying to understand better this thing called faith some of the room this morning
[time=1595] for the first time in recent weeks or months you're beginning to see insights into this book that you never knew existed and my encouragement to you is to keep at it to stay engaged and
[time=1606] to stay involved in that in that endeavor in your own personal and new fresh examination
[time=1613] of the authoritative word of God others of you in the room this morning I guess I just want to say to you and it's been on my heart for a number of reasons I guess I don't want to just look in the eye and say to all of us that call this place home I hope I hope and I pray with all my heart that that your spirit and your and your sense and your heart for for life as you face it and as you come into contact with all the things that you and I come into contact with I hope there is a sense still and I hope that it's burning
[time=1644] as strong today as it's ever burned that you like the Bereans that this family like those
[time=1652] people here in act 17 that this family would be a family full of people young and old who
[time=1658] would always in every situation in whatever the circumstance whatever decision you might
[time=1667] be facing whether it has to do with parenting or sexual purity sexual purity before and
[time=1673] after marriage whether it has to do with church government divorce and remarriage salvation
[time=1679] giving ministry involvement within the church abortion homosexuality the loving confrontation
[time=1685] of sin and the thousands of other issues that you face and I face every day my hope is that
[time=1696] there is a deep and immovable sense of commitment in your heart to in light of all of that stuff
[time=1702] always and only look to this book look to this truth to know to examine and to know what is
[time=1711] right to examine and to know what is true seems more and more these days the more advanced
[time=1719] and sophisticated the further along we get in our post modern relativistic culture seems
[time=1725] like more and more often the church becomes apologetic in some ways we become meek almost
[time=1734] bashful with our commitment to this book this irrefutable undeniable perfect powerful and
[time=1741] enduring word of God and I have to admit at times I feel that same that same pull interesting
[time=1750] this past week I had a chance I got a great invitation to go over to one of the local high schools and I got to go to one of the local public high schools and they have a class there at the school called good and evil class of about thirty or so kids seniors
[time=1768] and this this teacher with one of the gals in the class who is from our family here at Blackhawk just gave me the opportunity as many others had been given the opportunity from all kinds of professions and areas of involvement I mean the I got just a brief list of the
[time=1787] folks who had been in there prior to me and it was it was interesting and they gave me the chance to come in and tell these kids how it is I became a pastor what it is I kind
[time=1799] of do with my days and then open it up for Q and A and you know me I couldn't wait for the Q and A so I gave him about a two minute ditty on why I was a pastor and then said hey any questions and it was a great 50 by 50 minutes from there on out and they wanted
[time=1816] to know every question that God asked every issue that was burning and turning in these
[time=1825] kids hearts and minds that it was all about what about what do you think is how they would
[time=1832] pose the question what do you think about homosexuality what do you think about same
[time=1838] sex unions what do you think about premarital sex what do you think about abortion and
[time=1845] one gal asked how come you got a wedding ring wedding ring on I thought you guys can't be married I said no I married believe me yeah kids and kids and more kids but here was the
[time=1863] part that got me this is part that broke my heart here it is here's how the dialogue
[time=1870] would go every single time what do you think about they'd state the issue I would say well
[time=1880] according to and you know me what would I say according to God's word and then I would
[time=1886] and I wasn't preaching at him and I wasn't shoving things down their throat and we were we were having this great dialogue and they would ask what about da da da da da da da every single time I would say well according to God's word and I would share with them and relevant I think clear fashion God's response to those things and every single time they
[time=1910] would say back to me here it is two words yeah but what yeah but yeah but what about
[time=1921] this yeah yeah you get that what I'm saying there that's that's that's culture I mean
[time=1930] that's society's view of this and I understand that I wasn't mad at them for that or angry
[time=1939] at them for that I get mad and I get concerned and I get bothered when the yeah but begins
[time=1945] to seep into where here because people it is not yeah but this is the truth and it may
[time=1954] be crystal clear to you in whatever arena or situation you're trying to figure out or
[time=1960] it might be incredibly confusing but incredible confusion and the need on your part or mind
[time=1966] to keep wrestling with those things doesn't need to lead to yeah but because it's the truth
[time=1975] and these Bereans they they they had that spirit about them they wanted to know what was right they wanted to know if they could place their faith in this message that Paul was preaching and so they went to this book they didn't go to popular opinion they didn't go to society's message no they went to the truth and again and again and again and again
[time=1997] never apologizing and never becoming hesitant we need to with love and with a commitment
[time=2003] to try and lovingly reach those that got places in our path and I had a great time that day
[time=2009] in that class made some friends but it reminded me this is the truth and there's got to be
[time=2019] and there needs to be in your heart and mind a continuing commitment to fall back on understand know and apply this truth well Berea could have been I mean it was on its way to being a pretty
[time=2032] sweet gig for Paul I mean it was a great change I mean he'd gone through Philippi he's got people chasing him out of town in Thessalonica now he comes to Berea these folks are like hey we're in
[time=2043] we're going to consider the truth we're going to listen to your message but but the enemy
[time=2049] as he has been so many times in this story of Acts the enemy is restless and relentless
[time=2055] and the Thessalonian thugs show up again which is another reminder to you and we said this last
[time=2061] week so I won't belabor the point but I just want to remind you again don't ever forget how much
[time=2069] evil hates good don't ever forget don't ever be surprised remember last week every time you take
[time=2076] an advance every time you take a step don't be shocked don't be surprised the enemy what is
[time=2083] evil hates and detests what is good and the counter punch the counter attack it'll come
[time=2089] it always does and here these guys show up from Thessalonica and he moves on in verses 14 and 15
[time=2100] to Athens and here comes up against a subtle yet deadly dangerous foe here in Athens he comes up
[time=2109] against the mind thugs in Thessalonica here in Athens he comes up against the mind he comes up
[time=2116] against intellect first there was trouble then there was a teachable spirit in Berea now thinking
[time=2122] thinking minds in Athens this place was an absolute piece of work folks maybe you've studied maybe
[time=2128] you've heard maybe you've listened to others describe what it was like in Athens during this
[time=2134] time in history Athens had been home to Socrates to Plato and Aristotle the great ancient philosophers
[time=2141] the entire city in fact was a showcase of past intellectual achievement but the people of Athens
[time=2147] still hungered for spiritual things and that hunger was most evident in what Paul first noticed
[time=2154] about the city something that disturbed his soul while waiting and you see it there in 16 while
[time=2160] waiting for Luke to join him from Philippi and Silas and Timothy to come from Berea Paul's
[time=2167] spirit was being provoked within him as he was beholding the city you see it there the city full
[time=2173] of idols tens of thousands of idols had been cut into the public buildings stationed along the
[time=2181] streets and memorialized in shrines and temples and determined determined to plant God's flag of
[time=2189] truth in this dark idolatrous city Paul first scopes out a more familiar territory everywhere
[time=2196] Paul went he always tried first to go to the what the synagogues as was his habit he begins
[time=2204] evangelizing the city by reasoning see that in verse 17 by reasoning in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing Gentiles and in his reasoning he was selecting familiar passages from the
[time=2218] Old Testament to prove that Jesus is the Messiah but here's where it gets great his heart breaks people his heart breaks for the idolatrous pagans outside the synagogue walls and so he takes his
[time=2231] message to the street it wouldn't be that obvious to you as you would read it in the English but
[time=2237] the text would indicate a shift there and in the marketplace every day he goes to the synagogue
[time=2244] he reasons with the Jews then it says there last part of verse 17 and in the marketplace a completely
[time=2250] different world a completely different people this is big time let's keep going and also here it
[time=2260] comes and also some of the epicurean and stoic philosophers were conversing with him and some
[time=2267] were saying what would this idol babbler wish to say others would say this he seems to be a
[time=2274] proclaimer of strange deities because he was preaching Jesus in the resurrection and they took
[time=2280] him and brought him to the areaopagus saying may we know what this new teaching is which you are
[time=2287] proclaiming for you are bringing some strange things to our ears we want to know therefore what these
[time=2294] things mean now all the Athenians and the strangers visiting there used to spend their time in nothing
[time=2300] other than telling or hearing something new stop there the areaopagus people this was huge
[time=2309] this was it's hard to even kind of paint a picture for you that would give you a realistic feel for
[time=2315] what just happened this would be in essence you or I doing our best to proclaim the truth doing our
[time=2322] best to live out God's word taking that message wherever it is we were taking it it would be like you or I having done that being tapped on the shoulder by the chairman of the philosophy department
[time=2335] at Harvard it would be as if you or I got invited to Stanford it would be as if you or I got invited
[time=2342] to address the faculty and staff and students in the philosophy department at Yale I mean take
[time=2348] your pick these guys were the brightest these guys were the sharpest minds of that day steeped in
[time=2356] philosophy and thinking spending their days did you see it there in verse 21 spending their days doing nothing other than telling or hearing something new
[time=2367] tell us Christian they say go ahead tell us the brightest greatest minds of this day
[time=2377] tell us what you've got for us and I love Paul no backing down no message prep just the truth
[time=2385] and a love for the lost and a ready willingness to try as God's truth begins to pour out
[time=2392] in a moment's notice watch okay and if you've got your pen or your pencil and you've been taking
[time=2398] notes that's great if you haven't to this point I would encourage you to just jot these things down I want you to see how he does this I want you to watch I want you to listen I want you to think
[time=2410] with me as we unfold just these several verses here and in these verses you will be and I will be
[time=2417] all over again reminded today of how he approached this opportunity and there are some principles I
[time=2426] think for you to keep in mind and there are some truths here for us to see so please please watch and listen how Paul begins to unfold and in a powerful way share the gospel you want to do that
[time=2439] are you willing to do that are you interested in doing that having opportunities where you can
[time=2446] unfold in a relevant an accurate way the truth about God are you interested in doing that
[time=2454] and sharing that truth with those that God has brought into your life well watch and listen and learn number one I want you to see this number one write it down he starts where
[time=2467] they are he starts where they are look at verse 22 and Paul stood in the midst of the
[time=2475] areaopagus and said men of Athens I observe that you are a very religious that you are very religious
[time=2483] in all respects for why I was passing through and examining the objects of your worship I also
[time=2491] found an altar with this inscription to an unknown God stop there okay it's his chance
[time=2501] to begin to proclaim truth and please note that he starts where they are not where he is
[time=2509] and you and I sometimes don't do a very good job of that sometimes in our zeal and excitement and
[time=2517] sometimes in our pride and I've found myself doing it many many a time I can think back on some of the
[time=2523] initial interactions I've had with people and it sounded something like this hey I want to talk
[time=2530] to you about the atoning work of Christ and the redemptive need you have for regeneration and the substitutionary and sacrificial death of our Lord they're looking at me going who who are you and
[time=2544] what planet did you come from so many times we want to start with our theology so many times we
[time=2552] want to start with creation so many times we want to start with Jesus or sin and you know what I think
[time=2559] God brings us to those points and we get to have those conversations Paul starts with something that was very familiar to them his audience and that was religion
[time=2570] and the second point kind of ties in here last part of verse 23 on through the first part of
[time=2577] verse 24 he used the familiar right this down he used the familiar to bring in the unfamiliar
[time=2586] he starts where they are he uses the familiar to bring in the unfamiliar last part of verse 23 what therefore you worship in ignorance this I proclaim to you the God who now there he goes he just shifted
[time=2602] the God who made the world and all things in it since he is Lord of heaven and earth
[time=2611] does not dwell in temples made with hands he goes from religion to the living God
[time=2617] who they didn't even know and he's relevant how relevant are you how ready are you to start where
[time=2627] they are I heard a friend recently in a conversation
[time=2636] and he was in a conversation with a guy who loved NASCAR and I watched and listened to my friend talked for about 20 minutes about the whole Dale Earnhardt situation and there was a relationship
[time=2649] you know that had been building with this guy and I listened to a buddy of mine take the whole Dale Earnhardt thing and this guy's absolute fanaticism for NASCAR and in the first 20 minutes
[time=2660] it was all about that and then I listened as in the next 20 to 30 minutes that whole scenario and
[time=2666] how it played out leads this guy to ask the other guy so what about eternity what about
[time=2674] the fact that one hour he's kissing his wife and climbing into a car in the next hour he's dead
[time=2681] I've watched financial friends involved in the financial world lately I've seen and I've listened
[time=2689] to them take conversations about the current market with guys far from God who are very
[time=2696] interested in the current market and I've watched them develop conversations out of that that lead these other guys to begin to for the first time consider what real success is really about conversations that begin where people are not only does he begin where people are and not only
[time=2712] does he then transition from the familiar to the unfamiliar he is clear people and there is a time
[time=2719] and there is a place in this process for you and I to get really clear and he gets clear
[time=2725] verse 24 on down through verse 28 the God who made the world and all things in it since he is
[time=2732] Lord of heaven and earth and does not dwell in temples made with hands neither is he served by
[time=2738] human hands as though he needed anything since he himself gives to all life and breath and all
[time=2744] things and he made from one every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth
[time=2751] having determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their habitation that they should
[time=2757] seek God if perhaps they might grope for him and find him though he is not far from each one of us
[time=2764] for in him oh great minds of this time for in him we live and move and exist as even some of your
[time=2776] own poets have said for we also are his offspring he is clear he is to the point when it was time
[time=2792] he is ready we mentioned last week again first peter 315 he was ready to make a defense for the
[time=2798] hope that was within him and as he made that articulation that's why I love the bridge illustration
[time=2805] that you've seen us do so many times and you'll see us do so many times in the future I love the bridge not because I like drawing pictures I'm a horrible artist but the bridge when you just get
[time=2815] the general concept of it down people it is so what it is so clear it is so clear and it gives
[time=2824] you an opportunity to state truth in a visible fashion in a clear and direct way and when it was
[time=2830] time Paul got clear he also remained relevant and that's the fourth thing I want you to write down he used relevant illustrations last part of verse 28 there do you see that as your own poets
[time=2842] do you see that as your own poets have said he quotes a current greek poet off the top of his head standing in the middle of the areaopagus he quotes a current greek poet
[time=2855] and attempts to clarify the truth that god was their creator even their own authors believe that
[time=2862] there's the point he's making so i'm going to ask you today and again sometimes this whole
[time=2869] notion of being relevant gets kind of downplayed sometimes I bump into folks who kind of wonder
[time=2875] why the why the emphasis why the encouragement why the admonition from you guys you know you're
[time=2883] always talking about trying to be relevant culturally relevant well that's half of that statement
[time=2890] culturally relevant and doctrinally pure and you know what I say to them I say hey you know
[time=2896] that's an easy one the most relevant person i've ever read seen or watched do ministry
[time=2904] was the person of jesus he didn't speak and hard to understand words he didn't tell stories about
[time=2912] theology you know he took the people that he was with and he painted pictures from whose culture theirs and he used phrases and he used word pictures and Paul does the very same thing and
[time=2923] you see it all throughout the new testament the message never compromised never changed offered and communicated in relevant terms in this guy's quoting a current greek poet who are you
[time=2934] going to quote today how well read are you how familiar are you with the things that that this
[time=2942] culture that we're trying to reach and love and care for how familiar are you with what they see
[time=2948] read and come in contact with and i mean to appropriate levels how much do you read how much
[time=2956] do you know and understand of current mindsets and philosophy how ready are you to take current trends world issues and contemporary thought and articulate a loving competent faith filled response
[time=2968] i'll challenge you i'll give you an opportunity to expand your mind grow your heart and have a
[time=2975] great time doing it please write this down two books write it down would you a challenge
[time=2981] it to just give some time i don't care who you are how old you are how long you've known christ
[time=2987] two months or 20 years if you don't have them already pick them up two books one's called the case for christ the others called the case for faith case for christ and a case for faith
[time=3000] both by a gentleman named lee strobele and those books aren't the only books out there there's
[time=3006] two of the best ones i've read so far but they would they would give you an opportunity to better understand and better see and become more familiar with what the what the thinking is what are the questions that this world is asking and what is from the basis of god's word our response
[time=3025] how is it that you can make a loving competent faith filled case for christ
[time=3031] a loving competent faith filled case for faith well fifth thing i want you to write down he gets personal and you are and i am sometimes so nervous
[time=3045] and so afraid to get personal aren't we he gets personal verse 29 being then the offspring of god
[time=3055] he says to this gathering we ought not to think that the divine nature is like gold or silver or
[time=3061] stone an image formed by the art and thought of man therefore having overlooked the times of
[time=3067] ignorance god is now declaring i love how he says that to the smartest brightest most advanced
[time=3075] mental minds of the day what does he say therefore having overlooked the times of ignorance
[time=3082] god is now declaring to mean that all everywhere should repent all everywhere should repent
[time=3088] because he has fixed a day verse 31 a day in which he will judge the world and righteousness
[time=3095] through a man whom he has appointed having furnished proof to all men by raising him from the dead
[time=3101] it's you and it's me being willing to look people we love in the face and say what do you think
[time=3111] and then more than what do you think what are you going to do what are you going to do what what is your decision going to be as you have to face the person of christ and who he is and what
[time=3123] he's done and why he didn't and i want you to understand and see something okay folks did he
[time=3129] try and out intellect these guys no one of your truths to take home says that well and actually
[time=3137] should have read is my fault it should have read intellectualism because i'm okay with intellect intellects a good thing we just i just challenged you to expand your intellect i challenged you to
[time=3149] expand and go to work on on doing your best to understand what it is this culture is up
[time=3155] again so you can armed with the truth and a love for god and a love for people make a competent
[time=3162] faith filled god honoring investment into their minds and into their hearts i'm okay with us
[time=3171] reading books i'm all right with us gaining insight but please don't forget nobody ever
[time=3177] thought their way into heaven nobody ever got it all figured out nobody ever got every single
[time=3184] question answered and paul doesn't try and out intellect them he doesn't try and out think them
[time=3191] or out debate them no he has in this passage with relevance and with insight come and brought
[time=3197] to their feet the person of jesus christ he has brought to them a living god and he does it with love and he does it with competence then it gets me excited and it challenges me personally to continue to do my very best and i
[time=3216] hope it challenges you personally to do your very best to be ready to have a defense
[time=3222] for the hope that is within you one thing i want to just tell you before we go i already kind of
[time=3230] gave you the second truth to take home the first truth to take home and we're going to close with this
[time=3240] nobody was telling me this back when in 1989 when i was fired by those six deacons
[time=3248] and i've kind of just learned it as i've gone down the road and i want to tell it to you today
[time=3254] and i got reminded of it all over again just a couple of weeks ago at a conference that we were at
[time=3262] you've been called to something you guys every one of you has been called to be used of god
[time=3270] and it's his desire i believe with all my heart that you would and i would be ready and willing to be used of god in whatever situation no matter what and you've got a calling and i just want to remind
[time=3282] you today and you can remind me of this and you can you can say this to me you can write this to me anytime you want to pull me aside and say this to me you can and i'll say the same to you be a Jeremiah
[time=3294] be a Jeremiah you remember the story of Jeremiah if you don't i'd encourage you to read it
[time=3303] and in a nutshell just remember this god called Jeremiah to be a voice for his people god called
[time=3311] Jeremiah to preach repentance god called Jeremiah to go and face a faithless wandering people and
[time=3318] call him back to what is right and just for the record so we're straight and it's all right there in the book of Jeremiah and also in the book of lamentations not one single person that we know of ever one responded he gave his he gave his days and he gave his nights and he gave his life and
[time=3336] not only was there no response he got beaten he got thrown in pits he got put in stocks
[time=3342] eventually got taken into captivity in the exile and never at any point along the way did his
[time=3348] faithfulness and his readiness and willingness to be used of god result in massive conversions
[time=3355] growth of no not none of that god just wanted him and he wants you and he wants me when we bump
[time=3362] into the Thessalonians and when we bump into the Athenians and maybe he'll throw in a few
[time=3368] burrines every once in a while but when we in response to our calling have to face the kind of
[time=3376] days that Paul had to face just remember remember Jeremiah read about him this week maybe spend
[time=3383] some time refreshing your own mind and heart his reward Jeremiah's it's going to be in heaven
[time=3392] and I hope for you and I hope for me a sense of confidence and a willingness to be that determined and that willing to let god use us however he will no matter what let me ask you to stand if you would let's close in a word of prayer Father as we leave this place today our prayer is that you would in only the way that you can
[time=3416] through the power of your Holy Spirit god that you would take this truth and as clear or unclear
[time=3422] as it's been god regardless of the messenger this morning this is the word of god and it's
[time=3428] sharp and it cuts and it penetrates and so I pray god that your spirit would take this truth and in every heart here and every life standing here this morning in this room god I pray
[time=3440] that there would be a willingness to live out this truth to remember these principles to do
[time=3446] whatever we need to do ask for whatever help we may need to ask for make whatever commitments we might need to make to be a people who are willing to stay at it earlier we talked about me and my
[time=3458] daughter and her learning to ride her bike and the need she had for me to not let go I just wanted
[time=3464] to remind you if there was every time in your life where you needed encouragement or help
[time=3470] kind of needed some assistance getting back up on the bike so to speak we want you to know
[time=3476] we'd love to talk with you please give us a phone call write us a note or better yet come by on a
[time=3483] Sunday morning if there was any way at all that we could help bring that sense of confidence
[time=3489] and encouragement into your life we'd love to help you out so let us know and we'll look forward to
[time=3497] hearing from you
[time=3519] you
