[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - It wasn't too long ago that my five-year-old daughter and I were out on the street in front of our house.
[time=36] The day had come for her to learn how to ride her bike without her training wheels.
[time=40] And after several incredibly unsuccessful attempts, a couple of bloody knees and a severely bruised sense of confidence, she looked up at me.
[time=50] And with tears in her eyes, she said this, she said, "Dad, I'll try one more time, "as long as you don't let go." And I thought, you know, isn't that how it is, as you and I attempt to face life?
[time=64] That need we have for that sense of his presence, his hand on our lives.
[time=70] And I hope that as you join us today and as you hear us sing and speak and live out the truth, I hope that there would be a greater sense of confidence.
[time=81] In your heart, a greater sense of his presence as he walks through life with his hand on our backs, leading, guiding, taking us to places that he wants us to go.
[time=93] [MUSIC - 147 seconds]
[time=245] Okay, the Bible says, "We read it, but the Lord is good." [MUSIC - 294 seconds]
[time=566] In his book, In the Grip of Grace, Max Lakata has these words, he says somewhere on life's path.
[time=573] And I would imagine everyone in this room to some degree can identify with this.
[time=578] He says somewhere on life's path, our flesh is pierced by a person or a problem.
[time=584] Our stride becomes a limp, our pace is slowed to a halt.
[time=588] We try to walk again only to a wince at each effort.
[time=591] Finally, we plead with God for help.
[time=595] Many of you here this morning, as is the case with the Apostle Paul, as we've looked through the book of Acts,
[time=601] have been given a tough calling.
[time=606] Many in this room this morning have, like Paul, been asked to go places.
[time=610] You've been asked to do things.
[time=612] You've been asked to persevere in situations that are very challenging and very difficult.
[time=619] Faith stretching, we like to call them.
[time=622] And Paul, he knew all about that.
[time=625] He knew all about facing situations that were difficult and challenging.
[time=629] In fact, we learn about in 2 Corinthians a thorn, and we've talked about this before, the thorn in the flesh.
[time=635] And oftentimes people have speculated, as we did several weeks ago, as to what that thorn might have been.
[time=641] We don't really know for sure.
[time=643] But as people have studied the Bible, and as they have looked at Paul's experience in his life,
[time=649] some suggestions have come to the forefront, possible thorns that he faced.
[time=654] Sexual temptation, Paul being a single man, knew it very well.
[time=659] And as you read, especially words like the ones found in Romans 7 where it says,
[time=665] "I do the things I do not want and the things I do not want I do."
[time=671] He talks about temptation as if he knew her firsthand.
[time=675] And some have speculated that his life as a single man in the midst of ministry, that the thorn that he often faced was temptation.
[time=683] He suggested me on that opposition.
[time=685] And again, I don't think, again, any of you who have read the Bible, and I realize some of you here this morning may be having as much, and that's fine.
[time=692] But let me tell all of you that he faced plenty of opposition.
[time=695] He was beaten, he says, times without number.
[time=698] Beaten with rods, beaten with sticks, stoned in listra, almost to the point of physical death.
[time=704] Shipwreck three times.
[time=705] If there was ever someone who had faced opposition, physical opposition, it would have been Paul.
[time=710] Some say temptation, some say opposition, others say, his abrasive nature.
[time=715] We learned that Paul studied at the feet of a guy named Gamaliel, the great rabbi.
[time=719] It would appear that maybe Paul skipped school on the day they talked about tact.
[time=725] As you read Paul's letters, as you listen to Paul communicate, Paul offended many of people in his day and he continues today to offend some with his bluntness.
[time=738] With his lack of tact, he was so passionate and so zealous for the truth, he said it like it was.
[time=746] And that may have been, some would suggest, his thorn, the response, the feedback, the difficulties that came with that.
[time=753] Others would say it was his poor health.
[time=755] We mentioned this in our study of Acts, migraine headaches, some say.
[time=759] Plague Tim ever sends his episode there on the coast of Pamphilia.
[time=763] Others say it was his eyesight.
[time=765] At the end of Galatians he says, see how large a letter I write with?
[time=770] Whether it was his poor eyesight or migraines, physically there were things.
[time=775] As far as his health that he had to endure and face on a daily basis.
[time=780] And then there was his public speaking.
[time=782] I think it's in 2 Corinthians 10 where he actually overhears some saying, and I forget the exact verbiage,
[time=790] but his speaking is nothing, he hears them saying.
[time=795] And he himself said in 1 Corinthians 2, I came to you not in persuasive words, but in fear and much trembling.
[time=804] Well, Cato goes on to say this.
[time=807] He says, let's back away for a minute and tally this up.
[time=811] It's tally this up.
[time=813] I don't know how you envisioned Paul, but the image may be about to change.
[time=817] Tempted often, beaten regularly, opinionated, dimsided, and thick-tonged.
[time=824] Is this the apostle Paul?
[time=827] Could be he never got married because he couldn't get a date.
[time=831] No wonder some questioned if he were an apostle and no wonder he prayed for help.
[time=836] And you know maybe what you're facing today leaves your weaknesses exposed.
[time=844] And leaves you like me, begging for God's help and his strength.
[time=849] The song you're about to hear speaks to that very issue.
[time=853] And my hope is that as you listen, you would just maybe just take this moment as a chance to just reflect on whatever it is God's called you to.
[time=863] Whatever challenges you may be facing.
[time=865] Or you know what, you may not be facing many challenges today.
[time=868] Today may be a great day.
[time=870] A time of calm, maybe the waters are clear, but you know like I know.
[time=875] But that won't last forever.
[time=878] Challenge, testing, trials will come.
[time=881] And as we face them like Paul faced, so many.
[time=885] Our hope is that his strength, his strength, made available to you and me in personal relationship with him, that his strength made available to us would be that which you fall forward.
[time=899] That which you fall back on, rest in.
[time=902] I'm embraced.
[time=903] I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength.
[time=923] But sometimes I wonder what he can do through me.
[time=929] No great success to show.
[time=938] No glory on my own, yet in my weaknesses he's there to let me know.
[time=952] His strength is perfect when our strength is gone.
[time=962] He'll carry us when we can carry on.
[time=972] Raised in his power though we become strong.
[time=983] His strength is perfect.
[time=1003] We can only know the power that he holds when we truly see how deep our weakness goes.
[time=1023] His strength in us begins, where ours comes to an end.
[time=1033] And he hears our humble cry and droops again.
[time=1042] His strength is perfect when our strength is gone.
[time=1053] He'll carry us when we can carry on.
[time=1063] Raised in his power though we become strong.
[time=1073] His strength is perfect, his strength is perfect.
[time=1083] His strength is perfect when our strength is gone.
[time=1093] He'll carry us when we can carry on.
[time=1103] Raised in his power though we become strong.
[time=1113] His strength is perfect, his strength is perfect.
[time=1123] His strength is perfect when his power though we become strong.
[time=1139] His strength is perfect.
[time=1161] Well if you've got your Bibles this morning open them up if you would to Acts chapter 18.
[time=1167] You know in my opinion one of the great thrills of the Christian life is coming to points along the way.
[time=1177] Coming to points along the climb, rest areas if you will.
[time=1182] In the midst of the journey, seasons where you get the chance to kind of pull over to the side and look back at what God has done.
[time=1189] One of the greatest thrills I think in all of the Christian experience, a chance to just pull off, take a look back.
[time=1196] And in amazement see and witness kind of all over again where God has brought you, what God has led you through, what God has accomplished.
[time=1206] And the realization hits you, like the realization hits me almost every day.
[time=1213] The realization hits you, you can't believe.
[time=1216] Sometimes you just stand in amazement when you look at where God has brought you.
[time=1222] And you stand today and I stand today in a place I never would have imagined he would have brought me.
[time=1230] And you stand today possibly, I don't know where you're at today in this journey, but possibly today for you is one of those rest area vista point experiences.
[time=1240] And you look back and you go wow, I would never have imagined that this is where God would have brought me, that he would have accomplished this.
[time=1248] Happens to me all the time. I can't tell you people how many times on a Wednesday night or a Sunday morning, you know, I sit down here and sometimes I literally laugh.
[time=1258] Sometimes I literally chuckle to myself.
[time=1263] When I look at where I am and what I get to do and what I get to be a part of when I look at this place and these people, when I look at my life here in Fort Wayne, Indiana, sometimes I sit in that pew and I laugh, I can't believe.
[time=1277] And if you knew me 20 years ago, if you saw what I was like, if you had a picture which I'm glad you don't of what I was involved in and what I did and the stuff that I was into, the kind of person that I was.
[time=1290] I mean it was absolutely pathetic and then I looked fast forward 20 years and I go wow, you ever do that?
[time=1298] You ever just kind of catch a glimpse of where you are, realize where you are and go I can't believe this.
[time=1303] I mean you know I played basketball and I played basketball a couple years there before I came to know Christ and many of you may know this was just a little side light to let you know again how comical it is sometimes.
[time=1315] I got a phone call several months ago, may have been close to a year ago, the Bible hour gets broadcast out in California in the Sacramento area.
[time=1324] Those of you watching today from that area, greetings from warm sunny Fort Wayne.
[time=1333] The Bible hour gets broadcast out there in that Sacramento kind of North Bay area.
[time=1338] Well I went to school in San Francisco, alright, I made a reputation out there.
[time=1343] And I never forget about maybe 10 months ago I get a phone call from a guy that I went to school with and played basketball with who still lives in the area, turned on his TV one morning and sees me.
[time=1353] Me, preaching in a church in Indiana, he calls me and I can't tell you what he said, I mean I can't say it in here.
[time=1364] He hadn't changed much, I had and he said what the heck are you doing?
[time=1370] And I just laugh sometimes at where he's brought me.
[time=1375] And the looking back is a really sweet thing and many here today are basking in the joy of what God has done.
[time=1382] You're enjoying a season of sweet reflection, you stand amazed on your spiritual journey.
[time=1387] Others of us today feel the exact opposite.
[time=1393] Others of you here in this room this morning feel the exact opposite.
[time=1396] For some here today you're in climbing mode.
[time=1400] For some here in this room this morning we're spending each day, looking at each day, experiencing each day as simply a matter of survival.
[time=1408] God has us in or is leading us to a faith stretching, challenging part of the Christian climb.
[time=1415] A challenge that sometimes if we're honest leaves us wondering if God really knows what he's doing.
[time=1421] Leaves us wondering sometimes if we're honest if God really is on the throne or if maybe just for a moment he stepped off and let down his guard.
[time=1431] Because sometimes what he's leading us to and we can see it kind of happening right before our eyes.
[time=1437] Sometimes what he's leading us to or sometimes what he has us in the midst of.
[time=1442] Sometimes the climb he's calling us to endure seems too much, too complicated, too painful.
[time=1448] And so with Paul has he heads into chapter 18 here in our study of Acts whether basking in sweet reflection or climbing tenaciously.
[time=1459] This morning we get a chance to realize that with God you just never know.
[time=1464] With God you just never know. We're gonna see five things. With God you just never know where God will lead.
[time=1471] You never know who God will send. You never know how God will work.
[time=1476] With God you just never know when he will speak and fiftly you never know what God will accomplish throughout the process.
[time=1484] And so let's travel along this morning with Paul as he climbs and find out. You never know.
[time=1489] Number one where God will lead. You never know where God will lead Acts chapter 18.
[time=1496] Pick it up there right there in the first verse. Acts chapter 18 verse 1 says this after these things stop right there.
[time=1503] Where has he just left? He has just left where? Athens. Great job.
[time=1509] He has just left Athens. He has just left this incredible opportunity where he had the opportunity to state the gospel.
[time=1516] Had the chance to proclaim the truth in front of the greatest minds and thinkers of that day at the Ariapagos there in Athens.
[time=1523] He has boldly studied and evidenced his faithfulness and willingness to be used of God no matter the situation and now he moves on from Athens.
[time=1531] Things get a little intense and it says in verse one after these things he left Athens and went to Corinth.
[time=1538] Stop right there. Underline that city Corinth. Corinth. What a place you guys.
[time=1547] Read about it again this past week. Had read about it in the past and just got again familiar with what this city was like.
[time=1556] What this community was made up of. What was going on in Corinth during this time and as you look and as you study it just leaves your jaw dropped all over again.
[time=1565] Reminds me of kind of a modern day Amsterdam. I don't know if you've ever been to Amsterdam.
[time=1571] My wife and I had a chance several years ago to go over and only spend a couple of days in Amsterdam on our way to some other places but boy two days was two days too much.
[time=1581] Never in my life have I seen such debauchery. Never in my life have I seen such out in the open full fledged immorality illicit behavior.
[time=1593] Some of the stuff you know we couldn't even mention. Some of the things we saw we never want to see again.
[time=1599] And Corinth was this dark debauched place. It was a port town filled with commerce trade and finance.
[time=1606] The markets bulged with a worldwide array of exotic foods art and rich opportunities.
[time=1611] And as is often the case with wealth opportunities for entertainment culture and sensual pleasures abounded.
[time=1617] William Barkley the commentator gives us some help. He says the Greeks in that day had a verb in their language.
[time=1624] There was a verb and the verb in the Greek language was called to play the Corinthian.
[time=1629] It was actually a verb to play the Corinthian which meant to liberalized a life full of lustful debauchery.
[time=1637] In Greece if ever a Corinthian was shown on the stage he was shown drunk or engaged in acts of immorality.
[time=1645] Dominating Corinth stood the hill of the Acropolis. The hill was not only a fortress it was a temple of Aphrodite, the Greek sex goddess.
[time=1654] And in its great days the temple had one thousand priestesses of Aphrodite who were sacred prostitutes
[time=1661] and who at evening time came down to the city streets to ply their trade with a passion.
[time=1668] With illicit activity, with perversion running wild and a godless culture dominating the scene Paul comes walking into Corinth.
[time=1680] This is where God had led. This was God's call for now.
[time=1688] And I can most certainly in my mind's eye and in my heart hear him asking questions like, wait a second.
[time=1695] Did you get off the throne for just a moment here? What are you thinking?
[time=1700] I can in my mind's eye and in my heart hear him asking questions like how can these people be reached?
[time=1706] God what are you doing? What can I do to reach this place? What can I one man do to make a dent in this kind of society?
[time=1716] God what are you thinking? And why should they even listen to me?
[time=1722] I can hear him asking how in the world will I ever survive this?
[time=1727] Do you ever ask those questions? Ever think those thoughts? Ever have those feelings? God why me? God what are you doing?
[time=1735] How could I ever survive this? How could you ever expect me to have any kind of impact here in this setting or that?
[time=1742] You probably have. I know I have.
[time=1745] I believe those kinds of questions were on his heart because of what he himself said to the Corinthians in his first letter to them.
[time=1751] Flip open to 1 Corinthians chapter 2. Go on past the book of Romans.
[time=1756] Next book on your way back through the New Testament. Go to 1 Corinthians.
[time=1760] This is his first letter he writes to this same church that eventually does get established here in Corinth.
[time=1766] And we see what was on his heart. We see how he was feeling.
[time=1769] We see the kind of stuff that was running through his head and his heart as he comes into this dark and debauched place.
[time=1775] 1 Corinthians chapter 2. Look at verse 1.
[time=1778] It says there in verse 1 and when I came to you brethren, I did not come with superiority of speech or of wisdom proclaiming to you the testimony of God.
[time=1789] I was with you it says in weakness. Verse 3.
[time=1792] I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling.
[time=1798] It says in verse 2, "For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified." That's it. As far as he was concerned, I was with you in fear.
[time=1808] I was with you in weakness and in much trembling, not with persuasive words.
[time=1815] Question for you this morning. Have you ever felt confused?
[time=1818] Even afraid of going where God was clearly sending you.
[time=1823] Whether it's parenting, whether it's a ministry calling, whether it's a new job, whether it's a relationship.
[time=1830] Have you ever felt confused? Even afraid of going where God was clearly calling you.
[time=1836] Not your head if you've ever felt that. Yeah. Me too.
[time=1842] And you know what? Maybe it was to do something. Maybe it's called. Maybe the situation that he placed you in or was calling you to.
[time=1851] Maybe it was to go and actually do something but don't forget people.
[time=1854] Sometimes our call is just simply to endure something.
[time=1860] Paul felt these same feelings and as God often does with me.
[time=1866] And I would venture a guess as he often does with you.
[time=1871] He did with Paul as well. He doesn't leave him alone.
[time=1875] He doesn't send him into this dark debauched place to fend for himself.
[time=1878] No. He doesn't leave him to climb solo. He sends in reinforcements.
[time=1883] You never know who God will send. Go back to Acts 18. You never know.
[time=1888] In the midst of that what she's called you to. You never know who God will send.
[time=1892] Look it back to 18. Pick it up in verse 2.
[time=1896] It says, "And he found a certain Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, having recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to leave Rome.
[time=1908] He came to them. And because he was of the same trade, he stayed with them and they were working.
[time=1914] For by trade they were tent makers. Stop right there.
[time=1919] God does it again.
[time=1921] We could spend all morning going back through the pages of Scripture, seeing time and time and time again where God does this very thing.
[time=1927] And he does it with you and he does it with me and he did it with Paul.
[time=1930] What does he do? At just the right time God gave Paul just the right people to meet just the right need and just the right way.
[time=1939] They were Jews.
[time=1941] Fellow Jews, same profession.
[time=1944] And God brings them into Paul's life and they form a source of great encouragement.
[time=1951] And again I got to ask you this morning how many times in your journey and I want to ask you just to think about this.
[time=1956] I want to give you a minute here just to scroll back through your climb, to scroll back through the experience that God has had you on from the beginning.
[time=1963] And that might be two weeks, that might be twenty years.
[time=1968] But I want you right now just to kind of begin to scroll back through this path, through this journey that God's had you on.
[time=1975] And how many times? Probably too many to count.
[time=1979] But I'm going to ask you to identify one.
[time=1982] How many times in your journey with God has he had just the right time brought just the right person to meet just the right need in just the right way?
[time=1995] I mean and it was done in such a way that there was no doubting it with God.
[time=1999] I want you to think about that.
[time=2001] Think of a time where he did it.
[time=2003] Think of a situation where he moved in that fashion.
[time=2006] I bet a face, I bet a face can come to mind.
[time=2010] I've got about eight.
[time=2014] I mean I've got about eight faces.
[time=2016] I can think of hundreds of experiences.
[time=2018] But I'll tell you what, there was a day about four years ago.
[time=2021] Here in this place, when, and I even know we laugh and kid today about my love for the Midwest, gas city and the water tank and all that stuff.
[time=2030] There was a day I didn't feel that way.
[time=2032] There was a day about four, four and a half years ago where I laid awake in bed at night wondering what in the world I had done.
[time=2039] And in the midst of days that were full of confusion, in the midst of days that were full of even regret, it felt like, in the midst of times where I just absolutely longed for what to me was home.
[time=2052] Again, many of you know me and realize I never had a home growing up.
[time=2056] Eighteen years lived in seventeen different houses.
[time=2059] I never lived one place more than about eighteen months.
[time=2062] And finally at the age of twenty, God got a hold of my life and home was one place for about sixteen years.
[time=2070] Fifteen, sixteen years before we came here.
[time=2072] So I only had one home.
[time=2074] And it was the place we had left.
[time=2076] And there were dark, dark nights and lonely days where I did not want to look at these grey skies and these cold days and these weird people who drove funny and roads that didn't make sense,
[time=2090] changing names on your half way down the street just get me out of here.
[time=2094] It was like, you know, a nightmare.
[time=2096] And here's what God did.
[time=2098] God brought it just the right time and just the right place, just the right way.
[time=2105] He brought Tim and Karen and Ty and Barb and John and Katie and Doug and Tammy and Sarah.
[time=2117] And we had a small group that started.
[time=2120] And I can remember today, many a night.
[time=2123] We met once a week.
[time=2125] And I can remember right now is if it were yesterday, many a night.
[time=2128] I mean it feels like too many.
[time=2130] I mean it got to the point where it felt selfish.
[time=2132] But there were nights when those dear people would come alongside my wife and I and they would pray for us and they would listen to us whine and cry and moan.
[time=2142] And they would identify and they would empathize and we would laugh and we would cry and we would pray.
[time=2148] And God used those people over the span of about 18 months to make such a difference in our lives.
[time=2156] To meet such a need that I'll never forget it.
[time=2160] And it was just the right people at just the right time.
[time=2164] And they did just the right thing.
[time=2167] Well he leads us places we've never dreamed.
[time=2172] He sends the people of God to come alongside so that what?
[time=2176] So that the work of God can be done.
[time=2182] You never know where he'll send you, who he'll send.
[time=2185] You never know thirdly how God will work.
[time=2189] Look what happens in verse four.
[time=2191] And he was reasoning it says here.
[time=2194] He was reasoning in the synagogue every Sabbath and trying to persuade Jews and Greeks.
[time=2199] But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia most likely with a gift with an offering Paul began devoting himself completely to the word solemnly testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.
[time=2211] And when they resisted and blasphemed he shook out his garments.
[time=2216] This has been a long time coming folks.
[time=2220] When they resisted and blasphemed he shook out his garments and said to them your blood be upon your own heads.
[time=2228] Your blood be upon your own heads.
[time=2230] I am clean from now on I shall go to the, what's your Bible saying?
[time=2236] Gentiles.
[time=2238] And he departed from there.
[time=2240] He's going to leave right?
[time=2241] He's fed up.
[time=2242] He's going to a new place to a new people.
[time=2245] Fact is he went next door. Look at verse seven and he departed from there and went to the house of a certain man named Titius Justice, a worshiper of God whose house was next to the synagogue.
[time=2256] And Christmas verse eight.
[time=2258] The leader of the synagogue believed in the Lord with all his household.
[time=2262] And many of the Corinthians when they heard were believing and being baptized.
[time=2268] Maybe you've been at this point before.
[time=2271] Sure many of you, many of you in the room half.
[time=2276] Maybe you've been at this point before with God where you were really sure.
[time=2281] I mean you were really sure or if you weren't really sure at least you were really hoping that this would be his work.
[time=2292] As you looked at what he was doing as you looked at the scenery of your life as you sensed him leading and as you were willing to respond there must have been times even maybe now in your life where you were convinced or at least hoping that what he was up to.
[time=2305] What he was going to do would be, would be this.
[time=2310] He would come to Christ.
[time=2312] She would respond to the gospel.
[time=2315] This family would get turned around, find hope again and cling tightly to faith.
[time=2321] You know there have been times in my life.
[time=2323] Probably times in years where you were convinced or at least hoping that this is what God was up to.
[time=2331] And God in his province and God with his sense of humor and God with his ultimate wisdom.
[time=2338] And again maybe you've been there says no, no I'm going to do this.
[time=2347] You thought and you hoped and we prayed it would be this but God says to you and to me sometimes no, I'm going to do this.
[time=2359] And as for the Jews you guys please again many of you know this some of you may not let's all be reminded this morning as for the Jews and Paul and what he wanted and what he hoped for and what he longed to see as far as a response from them.
[time=2377] He really can't emphasize this enough people he really Paul really really wanted them to know Christ Paul really really wanted them to embrace the Messiah Paul really in his heart down deep inside.
[time=2392] He longed for these people his brethren those that he had come from he longed for them to know the truth and that was what he wanted that was the work he begged God to do.
[time=2406] I don't think so look at Romans nine flip over to Romans nine.
[time=2411] First few verses there just give you a glimpse into his passion and his longing his deep desire for these people to know the Lord Jesus Christ he says in Romans nine one he says I am telling the truth in Christ I am not lying my conscience bearing me witness in the Holy Spirit.
[time=2430] In verse two that I have great sorrow and unceasing grief in my heart.
[time=2436] In verse three he continues great sorrow and unceasing grief in my heart watch this for I could wish that I myself were a cursed.
[time=2447] Paul says I myself wish that I myself were a cursed separated from God damned is what that means that's how badly he wanted this to happen.
[time=2462] I myself wish that I were a cursed from Christ for the sake of my brethren my kinsmen according to the flesh who are Israelites to whom belongs the adoption as sons and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the temple service and the promises.
[time=2480] Who's are the fathers and from whom is the Christ according to the flesh who is overall God blessed forever amen people Paul wanted this.
[time=2490] And we see right here in this passage in Acts 18 God transitioning him to this and I want you to see I want you to sense I want you to take note of how he handles.
[time=2504] No fanfare not a lot of ramblings he shakes off the dust and he goes next door your blood be upon your own heads I am clean.
[time=2519] As God closes Paul's work with the Jews and instead turns his efforts and energy toward the Gentiles I want you to see how Paul stays the course.
[time=2528] God may be doing that with you somebody here in this room this morning God may be doing that very thing. God may have done it a week ago God may have done it a year ago.
[time=2539] God may be about to do it with you may you may be convinced that this is what God's work looks like in your life and you may be about to discover the fact that it's going to be something completely different you never imagined.
[time=2552] We talked about it a few weeks ago closed doors and the opportunities that come with new better doors that he opens in his perfect time and place.
[time=2561] Don't don't do what so many times I do and Paul didn't do it so don't you do it don't stand at closed doors banging your fist on the door wondering yelling God what are you doing why not this God I want this what about them be willing in your heart to look at a closed door and say God
[time=2590] you're well not mine strengthen me prepare me for what you have over here Paul made the adjustment he stayed at it.
[time=2601] So number one we go into scary challenging places secondly he sees fit to help that just the right time by sending just the right people thirdly he does his work not ours
[time=2612] and fourthly with perfect and divine timing every once in a while we get our spirits lifted by a truth from his word and the sense of his presence.
[time=2623] You never know in the midst of your climb in the midst of whatever challenge you might be facing you just never know when God might speak.
[time=2633] You never know when God will speak for Paul it comes right here divinely and perfectly placed following verse eight verse nine it says this and the Lord said to Paul in the night by a vision do not be afraid any longer.
[time=2651] Read that people look at that today the Lord says to Paul do not be afraid any longer but go on speaking and do not be silent for a powerful words right here for I am with you.
[time=2667] And no man will attack you in order to harm you for I have many people in this city my goodness when you look back at the track record Paul had experience to date when you see the beatings when you see the imprisonment when you see the turmoil when you see the crowds when you see
[time=2685] the violent reaction when you see all that he's encountered comes out of Athens he comes here to Corinth he faces this debauched and dark place and with perfect and divine timing the Lord speaks.
[time=2704] And you know what I want to speak that truth into your heart this morning if I can with the help of the Holy Spirit and your openness and your willingness.
[time=2714] I want to just do my best to be a faithful messenger of that simple and profound truth.
[time=2722] And let me just give you a minute or two to receive it can I do that would you mind just maybe just bow in your head right where you're at maybe just closing your eyes.
[time=2738] Now we keep getting to know each other better and better but I still don't know all of you and I don't know what life is like for you today and some who I know really well.
[time=2750] I don't know that well and I'm not sure what's happening down deep in your soul today as we gather.
[time=2758] I don't know if you're sick.
[time=2760] I don't know if you're terminally ill some in the room may be facing persecution others of you have been left by your spouse.
[time=2769] Some are getting ready to leave home for the very first time some are nervous about a new job.
[time=2774] Some in this room this morning are fighting addiction others of your face intense and what feels like at times extreme loneliness.
[time=2787] I don't know.
[time=2789] I know this some in the room this morning are just simply tired and weary from life.
[time=2796] Following Christ may just be at this stage of the game for you an absolute tenacious climb right now.
[time=2806] But I want you to listen whoever you are whatever you're facing.
[time=2811] Don't think for a moment that God in his perfect and divine timing didn't have you in this room this morning to hear these words.
[time=2819] Are you listening? Do not be afraid any longer. He says that to you. He says do not be afraid any longer but go on.
[time=2828] Paul's call was to speak. What's your call? Whatever it is.
[time=2832] He says to you this morning right here in this place and I simply stand here this morning trying to be the best and clearest messenger I can.
[time=2840] He says to you whoever you are go on. Go on speaking. Go on loving. Go on living.
[time=2850] Go on making that effort and do not be silent.
[time=2860] And here's the most comforting. Here's the most amazing. Here's the greatest truth of all.
[time=2864] Sense this you guys. Feel this. Hear these words as you sit here this morning for I am with you.
[time=2873] Wherever you go whatever you're facing he says to you this morning for I am with you and no man will attack you in order to harm you for I have many people in this city.
[time=2887] With your heads bowed and your heads bowed and your eyes closed. Listen to the words of Psalm 62.
[time=2897] My soul waits in silence for God. My soul waits in silence for God only.
[time=2905] For from him is my salvation. He only is my rock and my salvation. My stronghold. I shall not be greatly shaken.
[time=2915] Why? Because he's with you. Because he's with you. Maybe you this morning can echo the words of the Psalmist in Psalm 27 where he said this.
[time=2925] Hear these words this morning people. Hear David said I would have despaired and many of you are on the verge of that or many of you have experienced that even recently.
[time=2936] David said I would have despaired unless I had believed that I would see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living. He says wait for the Lord.
[time=2944] Be strong and let your heart take courage. Yes wait for the Lord. Why? Because he is with you.
[time=2954] And he says to you and he says to me this morning do not be afraid.
[time=2963] And I hope that truth and I hope that word from him that you see right there in your own text.
[time=2969] I hope for you this morning it is a lift. I hope it is a reminder. I hope it is an encouragement.
[time=2974] And again whether you're in the midst of a tenacious climb or whether today you're basking in a season of reflection challenges will come.
[time=2986] Those days will circle around again and we need to be reminded of what he said to Paul. Do not be afraid. Amen? Amen.
[time=2996] Let me show this to you. I'm going to wrap it up here in just a minute.
[time=3000] Great little insight. Set in my office and just kind of laughed and got kind of excited about what it must have felt like for him.
[time=3009] As you put all this together, little side note here before we go to the fifth point. As you put all this together, God says don't be afraid.
[time=3019] My goodness he's had reason to be afraid right? Now God says you know what don't be afraid. I'm with you. No one's going to harm you.
[time=3027] The fact of the matter is in all the cities and all the places that he's been so far they would estimate that the longest he probably had stayed in any place was about six months max.
[time=3038] The norm was more like a month or two. And again it's no mystery why everywhere he went they wanted to kill him.
[time=3046] So he's never been anywhere for more than a couple of months. God delivers this word to him and he stays people get this.
[time=3053] He stays in Corinth for a year and a half. He stays in Corinth for a year and a half and watch.
[time=3062] You never know a fifth point. You never know what God will accomplish. You want to wonder why he stayed in Corinth for a year and a half when he couldn't stay any other place he ever went to for more than a couple months.
[time=3072] Well go back to Acts 18. You never know what God will accomplish. Pick it up in verse 12.
[time=3078] There it is in verse 11. He settled there a year and six months teaching the word of God among them.
[time=3082] But while Gaglio was pro counsel of a K at the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul here we go again and brought him before the judgment seat saying this man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.
[time=3096] But when Paul was about to open his mouth Gaglio said to the Jews you know what if it were a matter of wrong or of vicious crime.
[time=3104] Oh Jews he's getting tired of these guys. Oh Jews it would be reasonable for me to put up with you.
[time=3110] But if there are questions about words and names and your own law look after it yourselves, I am unwilling to be a judge of these matters.
[time=3119] And he drove them away from the judgment seat and they all took hold of Sosthenes the leader of the synagogue and began beating him in front of the judgment seat and Gaglio was not concerned about any of these things.
[time=3133] And Paul having remained many days longer took leave of the brethren and put out for Syria.
[time=3141] With his words Gaglio in essence gives the preaching of the gospel catch this.
[time=3145] With this judgment for the lack thereof really he gives the preaching of the gospel his stamp of legality.
[time=3154] What a huge thing that was again the Jews efforts to push back the ever advancing message were squelched and by this time even the crowds are growing irritated.
[time=3162] By their incessant whining a year and a half ago think back now a year and a half ago he walks into the darkest of all callings thinking I can't do this.
[time=3175] Lord this is too much and in 18 months unexpected friends have come to his side comfort and courage have been offered at just the right time.
[time=3182] A church has been born people have come to faith and in the end the government of this feared wretched city has given legal permission to keep preaching.
[time=3194] And you and I are back here with Paul so many times going wow God what in the world are you doing?
[time=3202] How could you ever work anything good in this situation? And as is the case with Paul so many times is the case with us.
[time=3211] Time faithfully following enjoy willingness in mind to persevere and endure and stay open to what God is doing.
[time=3221] We've said it several times in the weeks that have preceded this our willingness to look and see where God is at work and join him.
[time=3231] It's so very very important.
[time=3235] Well there's some truth to take home I want you to see I think it's there on your bulletins real quick take a look at those okay.
[time=3242] And here they are on the screen truth to take home the darker the scene the greater the opportunity the darker the scene more confusing it might be the greater the opportunity keep going and I'm going to give you a passage here to look at as you go.
[time=3255] The weaker the spokesman that you and I in the midst of the dark scene the stronger the message because inevitably it's not our message but who's his absolutely.
[time=3266] And thirdly the greater the resistance the less the fear might be confusing but think about it the greater the resistance the more overwhelming it begins to get in the midst of whatever it is he's called you to do or simply endure.
[time=3282] Really the fear begins to diminish because we get the points where we realize we can't do this he's going to have to.
[time=3288] Please write this down as you go come on get a pen write this down 2 Corinthians 12 7 to 10 2 Corinthians 12 7 to 10 and Romans 5 verses 3 and following down to about verse 10 or so.
[time=3305] 2 Corinthians 12 7 to 10 Romans 5 verse 3 and following.
[time=3313] I want you to look at that before your head hits the pillow.
[time=3316] I want you to consider that truth today as an individual maybe as a family tonight before you go to bed maybe after dinner but look at that truth and be reminded once again of how as Marty sang earlier how with his strength in his strength
[time=3334] we are made strong our weaknesses our limitations are used by God to accomplish great thanks when in the midst of whatever tough calling he may have given we are truly ready and willing to depend on him.
[time=3350] Let me ask you to stand if you wouldn't let's close in a word of prayer.
[time=3358] Father as we leave today our prayer would simply be this as a group of people here many of whom many of whom know you and have experienced what it's like to walk through life exposed in our weaknesses challenged by the situations that you lead us to God as a people who know you
[time=3377] and have experienced your grace and mercy our prayers that we would continue to walk through life faithfully and and in obedience willing to not do our work our way but to continue to be a people that would be open and receptive to what you're doing
[time=3393] where you're doing it and the way you've chosen to do it God grow us and continue to strengthen us as we walk with you down those paths.
[time=3403] And Father for others here this morning who may not really know you I mean really personally know you there are some who may not have a relationship with you they don't know yet what it's like to experience life God in the way you designed it.
[time=3420] They're here today and they haven't entered into that personal relationship with you that gives life meaning and purpose and God our prayer for them is that they would that they would talk with us about it.
[time=3431] That they would talk with those they came with that somehow someway they might be willing to really possibly for the first time consider what it means to know and love you.
[time=3442] And we pray God that in the midst of it all that you would be lifted up that you would be glorified and God we thank you as a people for the chance to worship you today.
[time=3451] We'll look forward to being together again soon and all the people agreed and said amen.
[time=3458] Earlier we talked about me and my daughter and her learning to ride her bike and the need she had for me to not let go.
[time=3466] I just wanted to remind you if there was every time in your life where you needed encouragement or help kind of needed some assistance getting back up on the bike so to speak.
[time=3478] We want you to know we'd love to talk with you please give us a phone call write us a note or better yet come by on a Sunday morning.
[time=3486] If there was any way at all that we could help bring that sense of confidence and encouragement into your life we'd love to help you out so let us know and we'll look forward to hearing from you.
