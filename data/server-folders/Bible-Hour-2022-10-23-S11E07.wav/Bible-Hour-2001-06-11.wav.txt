[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=30] (gentle guitar music) [MUSIC - 120 seconds]
[time=158] Sing with us now, I'd love to sing your glory.
[time=168] [MUSIC - 173 seconds]
[time=346] Father, we come to bring our worship and our praise to you this morning.
[time=350] Lord, we lay our gifts at your feet. May they be pleasing to your ears.
[time=356] Indeed, you are our Father. There is none like you.
[time=361] We give you all the honor and the glory and the praise for it's in your son's name we pray. Amen.
[time=367] What a great, great day this is Father's Day.
[time=371] And I read somewhere that I forget who said it, but I think the quote was, "Life doesn't come with an instruction manual." That's why God gave us that.
[time=380] And what a great day it is for us to be able to consider what he has done.
[time=386] And he's done a lot of different things and he's done it in different ways.
[time=389] And many of you in the room this morning have benefited in some small ways
[time=395] and in some large ways from the investment of a dad.
[time=399] One who kind of stood by you, came alongside you, loved you well, said what needed to be said at just the right time.
[time=407] And your lives, like mine in some ways, have been forever changed and impacted because of what dads did. And this is a day that we just celebrate.
[time=417] We celebrate what God has done. We celebrate our earthly fathers and I think all of us, regardless of our earthly experience, celebrate his love for us as well.
[time=426] For many, he has stood in the gap in the absence of an earthly one.
[time=431] And we wanted to just kind of find a way to kind of express our thanks and kind of get the feel and the heart of our own family and how they feel about dads and there was no way we could get all of you to talk.
[time=442] And so we tried to just kind of pick and invite a cross section of our family to come this morning. And just simply, in so many words, let us know what they're thankful for. In essence, what you're thankful for when you think about your dad. And so we've got a younger one.
[time=457] We've got kind of a middle-of-the-road one and then we've got a...
[time=460] (Laughter) We've got kind of an older segment represented here today.
[time=465] And we just wanted to allow them, and we're going to start here with the burwells to just kind of have the kids share what they enjoy and appreciate about dad.
[time=475] Okay, my name is Ryan Burwell and this is my dad Dave.
[time=478] And I'm just really thankful for him and what he's taught me in my life.
[time=484] And I think the biggest thing he has taught me is to live my life for God and to pursue him with all my heart.
[time=490] He has proved to me how much he truly cares about my spiritual well-being through how he always encourages me to do the right thing and always seek God in everything I do.
[time=498] My dad has definitely been the biggest positive influence in my life.
[time=501] He has modeled for me how I should live my life for Christ, and even though he's not perfect, I cannot ask for a better dad.
[time=508] (Applause)
[time=517] Hello, my name is Kelsey, and this is my dad Dave.
[time=522] And what I love about my dad is he's nice, and he loves me,
[time=530] and he cares for me and my family, and that he feels good examples of God
[time=539] to people who don't have you in the heart.
[time=542] (Applause)
[time=551] Hi, I'm Tug, as in tug of war, and this is Carl Pearson.
[time=557] They told me that Kelly wanted to preach, but maybe they shouldn't have left us go for a laugh, because those of you who do know us as a couple of decades history goes, we have the gift of conversation.
[time=568] (Laughter) What I appreciate about my father, let's start with a couple of things here, like practicing my pitching, even though it hurt his hand.
[time=580] He sat in the bleachers whistling, and if you've heard his whistle, it's easy to tell.
[time=586] Whistling and hollering, he stayed up late, hiding Easter baskets or putting Christmas gifts together.
[time=594] Or on occasion when I was a teenager, helping me struggle with the decision having to do with, you're supposed to be the one that cries, not me, having to do with living Christ-like in an un-Christ world.
[time=608] What I appreciate is his commitment to God, his Heavenly Father, loyalty to family, immediate and extended compassion for the body of Christ,
[time=620] his passion, his emotion, and energy, to his vision,
[time=626] his pursuit of fun, his love of music, his eye for and courage to try the unusual,
[time=634] and his desire for his family and friends to know God.
[time=638] For those of you who have known us since I was apparently in diapers, I've been told, and that's a few decades ago, those few highlights have a three-dimensional view.
[time=649] For many of you who we've known a shorter while, I go by tug, though I am also Carl III, and so in some respect.
[time=663] We stand here, sit here, as a legacy to Carl Sr., who probably very few handful of you might remember.
[time=672] Perhaps the greatest tribute I can say is borrowed from songwriter Daniel Fogelberg, or Dan Fogelberg. I know a lot of you are too young to remember him, but we'll leave Kelly to fill in all the old stuff.
[time=686] He wrote a song and tribute to his father entitled "Run for the Roses" after his father had died. And the theme is all I'll leave you with.
[time=695] If you want to listen to the whole rest of the thing, you'll have to dust off your old CD.
[time=700] But it goes like this, "I'm just a living legacy." To the leader of the band.
[time=721] Let me do this. Let me ask if all the dads in the room this morning
[time=733] would just stand and hold the applause until we get them all stood, and I want to just do something here. How all the dads stand.
[time=741] And let me ask -- just go with me on this, okay?
[time=746] Many of you understand, most of you realize, that as a father and these who stand before us are that, none of us have got it figured out.
[time=757] All of us face an enormous challenge every day, and whether our kids are young in high school or grown and gone, there still remains for us, according to God's word, an enormous opportunity and enormous calling to be the men that God's called us to be.
[time=774] And so if you wouldn't mind, maybe with just somebody that you see standing next to you or near you, if you want to just kind of stand up or scoot over, would you just kind of put your hands on these guys' backs or on their shoulder or kind of hold on to it? If there's a family member next to you, just come alongside these guys right now.
[time=791] Go ahead and just stand up or scoot over next to them, and if it's a kid or a wife or a friend, just hold their hand or put your hand on their back, and I just want to ask God to continue to help and move in the lives of these guys.
[time=803] Just go up there right next to them and put your arm around them or hold their hand and pray with me if you would as we do that.
[time=810] Father, thank you so very much for a group of people like this who would get up out of their seats and come and stand next to those who have been given such an enormous calling.
[time=822] God, you have called us as men.
[time=824] You have called these who stand this morning as fathers to be men who make an investment in the lives of others, and you know, most specifically there, their children and their home.
[time=836] And that is quite a challenge that is scary, and that brings enormous levels of insecurity and uncertainty.
[time=843] And so every one of us who stands this morning needs an extra sense of your presence, God.
[time=848] We need the people of God, and we need the Word of God, and we need the Spirit of God to be at work in our hearts, reminding us God of who you've called us to be.
[time=857] For the forgiveness that you have granted in those times and during those days when we haven't been that.
[time=864] And God, give us courage.
[time=866] Give these men who stand in this room this morning, courage.
[time=870] And a love for you, and a love for those that you've given them, to be all that you've called us to be.
[time=877] Thank you so very much for the testimony of those who have come this morning and talked about their dads, God, their words, resonate.
[time=886] With so many of us as we think about what you've done through those that have loved us and years gone by.
[time=892] Give us a great rest of our time together this morning.
[time=895] Thank you for the privilege of gathering, and again, God, thank you for Father's.
[time=899] In your son's name we pray, and all the people agreed and said, amen.
[time=903] Thanks, you can be seated.
[time=905] (Applause)
[time=914] Well, what is it?
[time=916] Question three this morning.
[time=918] What is it that allows, let's say, a 13-year-old follower of Christ
[time=924] to wink at her mom and dad as she's wheeled into brain surgery
[time=930] in the attempt to remove a malignant tumor.
[time=933] Doctors say, well, more than likely take her life in the next six months.
[time=938] What is it that allows a young lady to wink at her mom and dad as she's wheeled off?
[time=944] What is it that allows the exhausted parent?
[time=949] What is it that allows the exhausted parent to fold that last load of laundry, make that last sack lunch, put dinner plates in the dishwasher, pay bills, and yet hit the pillow with a tired but thankful grin?
[time=965] How does that happen?
[time=967] What allows a 40-year-old to completely rethink his future and make scary but exciting changes in his professional future?
[time=977] What is it that allows a 65-year-old with declining health, a scattered family, or the deep void left by the death of a spouse to face the uncertainty of the next five to ten years with great confidence and great hope?
[time=991] What is it that allows people to face all of that with a deep sense of confidence and joy?
[time=999] The answer, the answer I believe to all the above is found in Philippians 4-7 where it says this, please listen, and the peace of God.
[time=1009] And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension,
[time=1015] shall guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
[time=1019] What allows for all of that and more to take place, my friends?
[time=1023] It is the peace and only the peace that is found in God.
[time=1029] The peace of God.
[time=1031] What's the opposite of peace?
[time=1038] Let me raise a hand, we can talk here.
[time=1041] Just a word, opposite of peace would be something like what?
[time=1044] Right here in the front row, right?
[time=1046] Confusion.
[time=1047] Confusion, thank you.
[time=1049] Struggle.
[time=1050] Mary Anne.
[time=1052] Anxiety, confusion, struggle.
[time=1055] Back in the back.
[time=1057] What's that?
[time=1059] Strive.
[time=1060] Thanks.
[time=1061] Strive.
[time=1062] Confusion, unrest.
[time=1065] Anxiety.
[time=1067] Struggle.
[time=1068] Sound familiar.
[time=1072] Yeah.
[time=1073] Sometimes all too familiar.
[time=1076] You know what, back in Isaiah, you can flip there if you can, back in the Old Testament.
[time=1081] Isaiah 32.
[time=1083] In Isaiah 32, we see God's peace put in some different terms.
[time=1088] And these terms that we'll see here in Isaiah 32 would be the opposite of those you just
[time=1094] offered.
[time=1095] We talk about the opposite of peace, we think of confusion, we think of strife, we think of stress, anxiety, pain.
[time=1105] Isaiah 32 brings us back to some biblical synonyms, if you will.
[time=1110] We see God's peace put in some different terms.
[time=1112] Pick it up in verse 17.
[time=1115] Isaiah 32, 17 and 18.
[time=1127] It would help if I were in Isaiah instead of Jeremiah.
[time=1131] See, you guys, you don't ever have to experience that.
[time=1135] It's just not a good feeling because you just read it Wednesday night and it was there.
[time=1141] And the Bible didn't get changed between Wednesday night and this morning and so you're sitting there looking in front of fifty-hundred people going wow, what am I going to say?
[time=1148] It has nothing to do with peace.
[time=1154] Sorry about that head on the Bible hour there.
[time=1156] Maybe you can cut that out and we'll just kind of start over here.
[time=1160] It says in Isaiah 32, oh there we go.
[time=1165] It looks so good to see it there.
[time=1168] And the work of righteousness, listen to this.
[time=1171] And the work of righteousness will be peace, it says.
[time=1176] And the service of righteousness, here you go, quietness and confidence forever.
[time=1182] Then my people will live in peaceful habitation and in secure dwellings and in undisturbed
[time=1189] resting places.
[time=1192] Do you catch that?
[time=1194] Quietness, confidence, security and rest.
[time=1201] Now honestly, what do you live with more often than not?
[time=1205] Quietness, security, confidence, rest or strife and confusion and anxiety and pain.
[time=1213] Well, back in Isaiah 26, a few pages back, I think these will come up on the screen for you.
[time=1218] I want you to see God kind of gives us the key to unlocking this kind of peace in our lives.
[time=1223] Isaiah 26.
[time=1225] Isaiah 26 verses 3 and 4.
[time=1229] Look how he describes it here.
[time=1231] He says this in verse 3, "The steadfast of mind," he says, "the steadfast of mind thou
[time=1238] will keep in perfect peace because he trusts in thee." And then he goes on in verse 4 to say, "Trust in the Lord forever.
[time=1247] For in God the Lord we have an everlasting rock," is how he says it.
[time=1254] Back to verse 3, okay?
[time=1255] Top of the verse there, the phrase, "the steadfast of mind." It's two words in the Hebrew, one of which means to lean upon for support.
[time=1264] And the other means a state of mind.
[time=1267] The word keep, if you go on further in the verse, will keep in perfect peace.
[time=1272] The word keep means to watch over and to protect.
[time=1275] And that with which God does the keeping is this thing called peace, repeated in the verse for emphasis, literally shalom, shalom, or unending security.
[time=1285] You put these definitions together and verse 3 reads like this, "The frame of mind that
[time=1291] is leaning on and receiving support from you, O Lord, you will protect with infinite calm."
[time=1301] What a phrase.
[time=1303] What a picture, infinite calm, is what we receive when we have the frame of mind that is leaning
[time=1311] on and receiving support from.
[time=1314] Now the Hebrew were the next line, in to verse 4, the next line tells us the impetus for this
[time=1320] peace.
[time=1321] What is it?
[time=1323] Our trust in God, absolutely.
[time=1325] The Hebrew word for trust provides us a picture as well as a meaning.
[time=1329] It means this, to throw one down upon his face, to throw oneself down upon his face.
[time=1336] So watch how this goes.
[time=1338] So those who throw themselves down upon their face before God, those who remove all other
[time=1344] crutches, those who abandon, make the choice to abandon all their anxieties and fears will
[time=1351] experience God's shalom, God's peace.
[time=1355] There's no question for you as you look at that verse, how long should we keep trusting?
[time=1361] How long should you keep trusting until the clouds disappear?
[time=1366] Yes or no?
[time=1368] No.
[time=1369] But isn't that how it works?
[time=1371] For you and for me, this enormous willingness to just fall down and trust God in the midst
[time=1377] of whatever it is we might be facing, then whatever it is we might be facing goes away and there we go, back to trusting ourselves.
[time=1386] No, it says forever, forever.
[time=1389] As long as we trust him, he will be there like a timeless, immovable rock.
[time=1393] What a promise.
[time=1394] And here it is right there.
[time=1395] And the pages of Scripture reaching up, inviting us to cling to it, to claim it, to hold on to it tightly and faithfully.
[time=1402] And you know, we've been studying.
[time=1404] We have been studying a guy following along the path as this man's life has unfolded before
[time=1411] us.
[time=1412] We have been talking about and learning from one who seems to be embraced by it wherever
[time=1418] he goes, the Apostle Paul.
[time=1421] Turn in your Bibles to Acts 19.
[time=1424] And we see again more insight into the life of this man.
[time=1429] He has been in need of peace at Lister.
[time=1431] He has experienced peace at Philippi deep in the dungeon of solitary confinement.
[time=1436] And he later even wrote about peace and we'll see that later in our time this morning in
[time=1442] a letter to those very people at Philippi.
[time=1445] And today as our study of Acts continues, we will see Paul's posture.
[time=1450] Now watch how this works.
[time=1451] We're going to see his posture.
[time=1453] Again, the way he is willing to respond and the way he is willing to posture himself
[time=1459] before God.
[time=1460] We're going to see his posture and his choices bringing new definition to some here this
[time=1466] morning and timely reminders for others with respect to the peace of God.
[time=1474] Three definitions of peace for us this morning from Acts 19.
[time=1479] We're going to pick it up actually in verse 21 here in Acts 19 as the book continues to unfold.
[time=1485] Paul has, as it says there in verse 1, made his way to Ephesus.
[time=1489] Paul finds himself in Ephesus and is ministering there in Asia and we're going to pick it up in verse 21 and look at three definitions of peace.
[time=1498] It says, "Now after these things were finished, Paul purposed in the spirit to go to Jerusalem
[time=1504] after he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, saying, pay attention here, after
[time=1510] I have been there, I must also see Rome.
[time=1516] And having sent into Macedonia two of those who ministered to him, Timothy, and harassed as he himself, went to Rome?" No, he stayed, it says.
[time=1528] He stayed in Asia for a while.
[time=1530] Now, I want you to understand something that the translation here wouldn't readily make
[time=1536] obvious.
[time=1537] When you look at this in its original language, you learn that the phrasing there, "I must also see Rome," represents what was a deep and passionate, burning desire in this guy
[time=1549] to go to Rome.
[time=1550] I mean, this was something that meant a great deal to him.
[time=1553] This was something that was incredibly important to him.
[time=1556] He wanted to go to Rome.
[time=1558] I must, he says, "Why, again, it's obvious if you know Paul, it's obvious if you understand
[time=1565] how the guy's wired, maximum impact." He could taste it.
[time=1570] Maximum impact, maximum effectiveness.
[time=1573] If somehow the gospel could find a home in that city, if somehow he could make a dent
[time=1579] in what was then the center of the then-known world, I mean, Rome was the place where Caesar was, Rome was the place where decisions got made.
[time=1587] And so it burns in his heart to go to Rome.
[time=1592] But look at verse 22, "Having sent into Macedonia, Timothy, and harassed as it says, he himself stayed in Asia for a while." Verse 22 shows us he is content to wait for God's timing.
[time=1605] Look at that phrase.
[time=1606] He has stayed in Asia for a while.
[time=1608] Well, how long?
[time=1609] Let's just look at this.
[time=1611] How long is a while?
[time=1613] Well, we know some things.
[time=1614] Number one, we know that the total time in Ephesus was three years, and you might want
[time=1620] to jot down, chapter 20, verse 31 is where you see that.
[time=1626] Total time that we're talking about here at this stop along the way, three years.
[time=1631] Many months of those three years were spent teaching in the synagogue, and for another
[time=1638] two years, and you learn this back in verse 10 of chapter 19, verse 10 tells us that he
[time=1644] spoke in the school of Tyrannus, three months in the synagogue, two years teaching at the
[time=1650] school of Tyrannus, that leaves if my math is right nine months.
[time=1657] Three months that he stayed in Asia with Rome, literally tearing at his heart.
[time=1663] Now if that's me, and again, I'll be honest with you, and maybe if it's you, if you were being honest with me, our natural response to unfulfilled dreams, our natural response
[time=1675] to unfulfilled expectations, our natural response left to ourselves to unfulfilled hopes and
[time=1682] desires is frustration.
[time=1685] Like sometimes anxiety, and Paul's response brings us our first definition of peace for
[time=1692] the morning, write it down.
[time=1694] The ability, or the choice, either way, the ability to remain faithful in the light of
[time=1702] unfulfilled dreams.
[time=1705] The ability to remain faithful in the light of unfulfilled dreams, when we truly and utterly
[time=1712] lean on him, entrusting our futures to him, his peace, and only his peace allows us to stay at our posts.
[time=1721] Key idea there, okay, for this point here, I don't want you to miss this, it allows us to stay at our posts, allowing him to unlock the doors of his plans and our dreams at just
[time=1732] the right time.
[time=1733] I want to look at the end of that definition, and then we'll work our way back in light of unfulfilled dreams.
[time=1740] You see that?
[time=1741] Look at that, in light of unfulfilled dreams.
[time=1746] What are yours?
[time=1752] Just give you just a minute to think about that.
[time=1757] We've all got them, and some might be frivolous and fun, and some might be extremely pertinent
[time=1766] and serious.
[time=1767] What are your unfulfilled dreams?
[time=1771] Did you think you'd be married by now?
[time=1779] Did you think by this point in life you would have surely had the right job, professionally
[time=1785] and vocationally?
[time=1786] You thought by now you would have been in the right place doing the right thing.
[time=1790] Maybe if you thought by now you'd have the promotion that you thought five years ago was coming.
[time=1796] You thought by now you'd have a house.
[time=1799] Maybe you thought by now they'd have a cure.
[time=1804] Are you still waiting for your kids to genuinely embrace and follow Christ?
[time=1810] Are their wives here in the room this morning still waiting for husbands to lovingly lead
[time=1816] and show sincere interest?
[time=1817] Are their kids still waiting for their parents to get back together?
[time=1822] My guess is there's all the above and more, and you ask, so what's the point?
[time=1827] Well here's the point.
[time=1830] In the midst of whatever unfulfilled dreams there may be in your life or mine.
[time=1835] There is still the 47 things to do on your to-do list for tomorrow.
[time=1839] The moral and ethical choices you'll make with family and friends and the demands and pressures of life and ministry sure to surface next week and you and I with all of it people
[time=1850] must be faithful.
[time=1855] No matter what has come or what hasn't, no matter what dreams have been fulfilled or which ones are still yet to be realized in the midst of the wondering you and I have today and in today there are things to do, there are people to love, there are choices
[time=1870] to make and we have to be faithful.
[time=1876] And the willingness to remain that, the willingness to stay at your post, whatever your post might
[time=1882] look like, there's an example of the peace of God.
[time=1888] Unfulfilled dreams do not give you or me the right to disobey.
[time=1892] Unfulfilled dreams do not give you or me the right to do life our way instead of gods.
[time=1899] It doesn't work that way.
[time=1902] Look at Isaiah 55, actually just look on the screens, Isaiah 55, just remember this please.
[time=1908] Isaiah 55 verses 6 to 11, seek the Lord while he may be found, call upon him while he is
[time=1916] near.
[time=1918] Let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return to the Lord and he will have compassion on him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon.
[time=1929] For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways, my ways, declares the Lord.
[time=1936] For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.
[time=1945] Goes on in verse 10 to say this, "For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven and they come down," right?
[time=1951] They come down and do not return there without watering the earth and making it bear and sprout and furnishing seed to the sower and bread to the eater.
[time=1960] Verse 11, "So shall my word be which goes forth from my mouth, it shall not return to me empty without accomplishing what I desire and without succeeding in the matter for which
[time=1972] I sent it." Your ways and your thoughts and mine sometimes are not his and they certainly at times don't
[time=1982] fit on his time frame.
[time=1985] And your unfulfilled dreams, I believe he cares about deeply, but he calls you and he
[time=1991] calls me in the midst of today to be faithful.
[time=1995] Now for Paul, a commitment to faithfulness must surely, one would think, a commitment
[time=2003] to remain faithful in the light of unfulfilled dreams.
[time=2008] One must have thought, well that would certainly change his circumstance.
[time=2012] Well, it doesn't, let's keep reading.
[time=2015] Come with me back to Acts 19, we're going to pick it up in verse 23.
[time=2020] Acts 19, verse 23, and it says this, "And about that time there arose no small disturbance
[time=2027] concerning the way.
[time=2030] For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith who made silver shrines of Artemis, was bringing no little business to the craftsmen.
[time=2038] These he gathered together with the workmen of similar trades and said, "Men, you know that our prosperity depends upon this business.
[time=2045] And you see and hear that not only in Ephesus but in almost all of Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away a considerable number of people saying that gods made with hands are no gods at all.
[time=2056] And not only is there danger that this trade of ours fall upon disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis be regarded as worthless and that she whom all of Asia and the world worship should even be dethroned from her magnificence and when they heard this and were filled with rage.
[time=2074] They began crying out saying, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians." And the city was filled with confusion and they rushed with one accord into the theater dragging along Gais and Aristarchus and Paul's traveling companions from Macedonia.
[time=2088] And when Paul wanted to go into the assembly, he was going to go after him.
[time=2094] When he wanted to go into the assembly, the disciples would not let him.
[time=2099] And also some of the Asyarks who were friends of his sent to him and repeatedly urged him not to venture in to the theater.
[time=2109] People why wasn't he afraid?
[time=2112] Rage, city-wide anger, mobs, mass hysteria, why wasn't he afraid?
[time=2122] Just one reason, the peace of God.
[time=2125] The peace of God.
[time=2126] The peace of God chases all fear out of the hearts of man.
[time=2131] Write it down.
[time=2132] The ability to stay calm in light of uncontrollable or unpleasant circumstances.
[time=2139] The ability, the choice to stay calm with God's help in light of uncontrollable or unpleasant
[time=2146] circumstances.
[time=2147] Now come on, you've been there.
[time=2151] I know you have.
[time=2153] And again, sometimes we're there in very serious situations and sometimes we're there in lighter situations and yet the lighter situations sometimes reveal a very serious
[time=2165] flaw in you and me.
[time=2167] Bumped into one of those lighter situations just a couple of weeks ago, we were on our
[time=2174] way as a family.
[time=2175] We had the great privilege of getting to do a wedding down in Cincinnati.
[time=2180] And actually had a chance to take an extra day to get down there and just be together as a family.
[time=2185] There were a couple of hotel rooms that the family provided for us down there and so
[time=2191] boy, we were excited and the kids were fired up and the van was packed and we were ready to go and you've heard me before we joke about this in our family.
[time=2200] I'm relentless with my wife when it comes to getting lost and her inability to follow
[time=2207] directions and we laugh and we joke and it's kind of a thing with the kids and it's all in good fun and we got in the van and the kids wanted to make sure I was driving and I said, "Hey kids, not to worry.
[time=2216] Dad's got it covered." And I did.
[time=2219] I had this whole thing figured out and I've been here for five and a half years and I've asked free born and long break enough times for Ohio directions.
[time=2226] I had it figured out and I knew.
[time=2228] I knew that you went on the 30 to Van Wert and you shot down from Van Wert to the 33,
[time=2234] that little truck stop there and shot the 33 over to the 75 and off we were.
[time=2239] It was easy.
[time=2240] You should probably call and make sure you know me being the guy said, "Nah, I got it, it's okay.
[time=2245] Want to look at the map?
[time=2246] No, I'm fine.
[time=2247] I got it." So we're cruising over on 30 and many of you who have made that drive know what's about to happen to me and you're probably already feeling my pain.
[time=2256] There's two Van Wert exits and one is 224 and one is 127.
[time=2264] The second one is 127, that's the one you want.
[time=2268] All I took the first and I was so confident.
[time=2272] I said, "See, here's what we're going to get off right here." And I take that first Van Wert exit and off we go down the 224, down would be the key word there, not a cross.
[time=2281] So we're driving along and you ever notice kids, I think lost adults put off a certain
[time=2287] aura.
[time=2288] They ever sensed that kids kind of pick up on that and it wasn't too long and I got a couple of words from the back, "Hey, Dad, are you everything all right?" They say, "Hey, no problem," because I'm kind of thinking that house kind of looks familiar and that business kind of like, "Yeah, I think we're okay." I'm thinking to myself, "Well, Kevin is starting to realize I think what's going on and so she kind of says she senses it's time for the kill.
[time=2311] She skits up in her seat and it's all going to come back on me, right?
[time=2315] We're driving along and all of a sudden we see the sign and this sign just closed the deal and sent me over the edge, the sign said, "Welcome to Indiana."
[time=2328] So Russell T from the back says, "Indiana, I mean we've been driving for an hour almost."
[time=2335] And she's laughing so hard she can't even talk to me, tears are streaming down her cheeks.
[time=2341] She's trying to rag on me but she can't, she's laughing so hard.
[time=2344] Now the kids are all discouraged, it's like, "Oh, Dad's got mom's disease now, we're doomed
[time=2351] for life." And when she finally stopped crying and could talk, she literally reclines her seat back, looks at me and says, "Wake me when we get back to Ohio."
[time=2366] And I say, "Lady, stop your clapping, please." I say all that in fun but I got tense in that spot and I admit that and I've admitted that
[time=2381] to you before and I'll admit it to you, I'm sure, a lot in the future but have you been there?
[time=2386] I got tense, I got short, I wasn't laughing, I don't think I took anybody's head off and
[time=2396] I didn't do any relational damage but I maybe scraped a few people.
[time=2404] You've been there?
[time=2406] Uncontrollable, there was no, I was done, I was going to Decatur, alright?
[time=2413] That was all there was to it.
[time=2415] And we were going to be 50 to 60 minutes late.
[time=2421] So what, to a hotel, with two days to burn and I got tense and I shut some kids down and
[time=2430] I told her that's fine, you go ahead and sleep and my knuckles are white and I was ticked.
[time=2437] I'm not so good at this second definition yet, still working at it.
[time=2444] Here's my prayer, it's pretty simple, you can write it down if it strikes a chord.
[time=2448] My prayer, as I thought about this, the last couple weeks has been this, God has my circumstances plummet.
[time=2456] As my circumstances plummet, by choice or by your will, God please, I'm begging you,
[time=2465] please bring your perspective.
[time=2468] So my heart may be calm and still.
[time=2474] God has my circumstances plummet by choice or by your will, God please bring your perspective
[time=2480] so my heart may be calm and still.
[time=2485] Because you know what you guys, five, six hours later, we were swimming in the pool at
[time=2494] the hotel, having an absolute blast.
[time=2498] And who cares?
[time=2500] Did anybody care, did anybody remember, it was over.
[time=2506] Who cares if you're 15 minutes late to a hotel where you got two days to burn?
[time=2512] Who cares if the food got spilled?
[time=2514] I mean really, staying calm in the midst of uncontrollable or unpleasant circumstances.
[time=2520] Who cares if you hit a bad shot?
[time=2522] Who cares if the house isn't perfectly clean?
[time=2526] Who cares, I mean in the bigger picture of life and what really matters and what God's really called us to, uncontrollable, unpleasant circumstances are going to come.
[time=2538] God, give us the perspective that we need to remain at heart calm and still.
[time=2546] He is and his peace is bigger than any mob from Acts 19 or any wrong turn in your life
[time=2555] or mine and no circumstance is out of his control.
[time=2559] Thirdly, Acts 19, pick it up in verse 32.
[time=2564] So then some were shouting one thing and some another for the assembly was in confusion and the majority did not even know for what cause they had come together.
[time=2573] It's getting, actually it's getting worse.
[time=2576] And some of the crowd concluded it was Alexander since the Jews had put him forward and having motioned with his hand, Alexander was intending to make a defense to the assembly but when they recognized that he was a Jew, a single outcry arose from all as they shouted for about two hours great as Artemis of the Ephesians.
[time=2595] And after quieting the multitude, the town clerk said men of Ephesus.
[time=2601] What man is there after all who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of the image which fell down from heaven.
[time=2609] Next then these are undeniable facts you ought to keep calm and to do nothing rash for you
[time=2615] have brought these men here who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess
[time=2621] so then if Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a complaint against any man, the courts are in session and pro councils are available, let them bring charges against
[time=2631] one another.
[time=2632] But if you want anything beyond this, it shall be settled in the lawful assembly for indeed we are in danger of being accused of a riot in connection with today's affairs since there is no real cause for it and in this connection we shall be unable to account for this disorderly
[time=2649] gathering and after saying this he dismissed the assembly.
[time=2654] He dismissed them.
[time=2655] Chuck Swindall says this in a commentary referencing this very passage, he says as if he were
[time=2662] playing chess God moves upon into just the right square at just the right time to block
[time=2669] the opponent's move and with us the same holds true.
[time=2673] He arranges unexpected events doesn't he?
[time=2678] He arranges unexpected events and unlikely people at times to defend us or come alongside
[time=2686] we in the process must keep waiting for him to make that move.
[time=2694] Definition number three, write it down the ability or choice to wait patiently in spite
[time=2701] of uncertainty, in spite of uncertainty.
[time=2708] Three really simple basic words you guys, in all three definitions it comes down to three things this morning to remain faithful, you see it?
[time=2718] To remain faithful, to stay calm and to be willing to wait patiently.
[time=2727] Well you look at all three definitions and if you're like me you look at that and you would identify it as being good you would see these three definitions and go that's right but if you're like me at all you're still kind of left with a question okay but how?
[time=2740] I mean how do I get to actually sense that or how do I get to kind of put my arms around
[time=2747] that because I want that I want to be faithful Kelly in the midst of unfulfilled dreams I
[time=2753] desire like you to learn what it means to stay calm when things get unpleasant and yes
[time=2760] I see the benefit the great benefit of being one who is willing to wait in the midst of
[time=2766] uncertainty but so okay so how do you do that?
[time=2771] And here I want to take you back to the man's very words inspired by God Paul writes in Philippians 4 which is kind of where we got started today and turn with me a few wooden your Bibles to Philippians 4 verses 6 and 7.
[time=2787] Truth to take home this morning you might want to jot a few things down Philippians 4, verse 6 and 7 it says there well actually we got to do the passage justice and kind
[time=2809] of go up a couple of verses these won't be on the screen but start up in verse 4 because
[time=2815] this is where it begins it says there rejoice regardless he says right there rejoice in
[time=2821] the Lord always and again I will say rejoice let your for bearing spirit for bearing for
[time=2832] bearing being satisfied with less than what you were do let your for bearing spirit be
[time=2841] known to all men for the Lord is near I love that phrase you see that in verse 5 for the Lord is near what's that mean for bear people hang in there let your for bearing spirit be
[time=2853] known to all men because you know what the end is coming and it will all get better and
[time=2860] all unfulfilled dreams and all unpleasant circumstances and all uncertainty will be wiped
[time=2866] away for the Lord is near so in the meantime he says for bear be anxious here we go verse
[time=2873] 6 be anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanks giving
[time=2880] let your request be made known to God and the peace of God which surpasses all comprehension
[time=2888] shall guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus let me say this to you the truth
[time=2894] to take home today as it relates to this issue of peace in the midst of anxiety people it
[time=2900] begins with prayer it starts with prayer it always has to do with it the the Word of God
[time=2908] again and again makes that evidence evident and you may say but it wait a minute but if
[time=2914] I take every unfulfilled dream tell me if I take every uncertain situation if I take
[time=2921] all of that to God in prayer I'll be praying all the time absolutely absolutely you will
[time=2929] be praying all the time and what was wrong with that you will be praying and I will be
[time=2937] praying and there will be conversation between us and our God all the time and that prayer
[time=2943] according to this passage now there needs to be some things in the midst of that prayer that you and I would make daily often where to pray thankfully get that down we are to
[time=2954] pray thankfully for the situation whatever situation he has a sin whatever it is that he's allowed to take place be anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication
[time=2965] with thanksgiving we are to be thankful for that which he has in his providence allowed
[time=2971] why don't miss this remind yourself of it write it down hold on to this because he is
[time=2977] good he is not bad he is not mean and he doesn't have it out for you know he is good he loves you and his word says he will perfect you he will he will complete that which he
[time=2988] started with you and he's good and you can thank him as wild as it might seem you can
[time=2998] thank him and you should as you take these situations before him if you back up a word
[time=3004] there in the verse it says by prayer and supplication second thing I want you to note here pray asking and sometimes we think it's it's not for us to ask no it's okay to ask if we
[time=3017] ask according to his will if you in your situation and me and mine are willing to say
[time=3023] god this is what I would desire and this is what I'm hoping for and and I'm going to lay this at your feet and but this is what I would hope the outcome might be so god give
[time=3033] me endurance give me endurance in case it isn't the outcome in case you do this give
[time=3042] me endurance and give me strength to persevere pray thankfully pray asking according to his
[time=3049] will and lastly rest and the peace of god which surpasses all comprehension shall guard
[time=3058] your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus rest rest in the peace that comes when a good
[time=3066] god who has our best in mind is that work on our behalf I don't know how else to describe
[time=3074] it to you other than just I'm thinking of a way to describe it to you and the picture
[time=3083] that comes to my mind is this I can see there's a tree just off to the right of our driveway
[time=3092] kind of borders our neighbors yard and ours the girls they love to climb in it Wesley's
[time=3098] a little bit braver goes a little bit higher Maddie's still a little uncertain she gets up in it she might go up a few branches but that's about it and then not only does she
[time=3109] stop but then she gets scared she can't make it back down it's too far she can't remember
[time=3115] how she did it you know what I mean and the interesting thing is and here's the point Russell can be out there Wesley can already have gotten down friends from the neighborhood
[time=3126] could be there people absolutely capable of just reaching up and extending their hand
[time=3133] she could kind of fall into that and they could get her down but she will not budge until who gets there me I mean if I'm around she's not budging until I come get her down because
[time=3147] she knows that when I'm coming to work on the situation it's going to be what it's going
[time=3155] to be okay might be a little scary I might actually she might scrape a knee coming out
[time=3163] or it might just go really well but you can see it in her eyes when I come out of the door and I'm walking on the driveway I'm gonna be alright and that's it folks I don't
[time=3177] know what your situation is but it doesn't matter he's at work and when he's at work because he loves you as much as he does it's gonna be okay and you can rest you can take a deep
[time=3190] breath having laid all of that at his feet and experience what Philippians 4 says is a piece you can't even understand and I want that for you I want that for every one of
[time=3202] you let me ask if you would to just stand stand where you are and let's just end our
[time=3209] time in a word of prayer and let me just ask you to bow your heads and close your eyes
[time=3218] and let me just let me just say two things real briefly you know just hang in here with me sit tight and let me just encourage I mean I hope you've sensed it I hope it's been clear
[time=3230] and let me just in case there's any confusion say this to you you need to pray that prayer
[time=3236] folks whoever you are this morning if you live in relationship with him and you're facing
[time=3243] uncertainty you're facing unpleasant you're facing that which is confusing or unfulfilled
[time=3250] you need to be the kind of people he's called us to be and he has called us to be a people of peace whose hearts are at rest and so today as you leave tonight before the head hits
[time=3263] the pillow or even right here in this situation as I speak you need to be willing to look
[time=3269] at Philippians four six and seven and God and say God please I'm going to offer it all to you right here and now I'm going to lay it at your feet I will choose to not be anxious
[time=3280] because I have chosen to give it to you and having given it to you I'll even ask according
[time=3286] to your will that you maybe do this or that but God whatever you do I'll trust it and knowing that you're coming down the driveway I will be at rest and I will leave this place
[time=3297] today ready to stand my post as a mom as a dad as a man as a woman as a student I will
[time=3304] follow you and I will be at rest and you know what I want to say this to there's others
[time=3311] of you here this morning and it's really hard for me to even think about this and it always
[time=3317] has been it's hard for me to realize that there are people every day who face the uncertainties and the unpleasantries of life and they don't have anywhere to go with it and some are here
[time=3327] this morning and you're still searching and you're still seeking and you've heard a message today that tells you again that there is a place there is a person there is a relationship that you can have there is a way of life that you can live in relationship with the living
[time=3342] God made possible by the death of his son on your behalf you can know for the first time what it means to have peace and I would love we would love nothing more than to help you
[time=3355] find that experience that and grow in that and so I invite you again whoever you are
[time=3362] wherever you've been however far you are on that journey I would invite you I would plead with you to just come down front afterwards and talk with us to ask a friend who brought
[time=3373] you to write an email when you get home to do whatever you can do to engage even further
[time=3379] in that discussion because there is a piece that surpasses all comprehension and you haven't
[time=3388] known it and you never will until you know him father that is our prayer as we leave
[time=3395] today that those of us who know you and are struggling through and yet enjoying the walk
[time=3401] of life God that we would be reminded today of the desire you have to care for hold and
[time=3408] carry on your shoulders that which would bring anxiousness and God that you would desire us to be a forbearing people willing to live life at rest giving ourselves God to the things
[time=3421] that you've given us to do and to do it faithfully and with a sense of calm and with a sense of patience so God only you can bring it and we would offer those things to you this morning
[time=3431] and ask God for your hand to be at work and for others here this morning who don't know you we pray God that they would and that they would ask whatever questions they want to ask call whoever it is they need to call come down here this morning and strike up conversation that would lead to peace and hope and clarity God that is our prayer and we are so thankful
[time=3451] for the privilege that has been ours today to be in your house to worship you to be reminded of you and God be with us as we go bring us back tonight bring us back tonight for a great
[time=3462] celebration of new life through baptisms and the chance to remember the sacrifice of your
[time=3469] son bring us back tonight healthy looking forward to a chance to be together again in your son's name we pray and all the people agreed and said amen.
