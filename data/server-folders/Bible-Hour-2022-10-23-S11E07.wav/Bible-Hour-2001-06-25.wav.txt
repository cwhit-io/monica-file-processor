[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Those words, those phrases that you just saw, they bring with them each of them their own set of questions and issues, family, anger, confusion, loneliness.
[time=43] And those are things that all of us face.
[time=45] And you know, as we come together every week here at Black Hawk, all of us facing those things in different ways at different times.
[time=54] One thing I find myself so very thankful for again and again is that the Lord Jesus Christ, the one whom we come to honor and look to, is one who understands all of those things.
[time=65] You know, it says in Hebrews chapter four, in verses 15 and 16, "For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who has been tempted in all things as we are yet without sin." Now listen to this, verse 16 says, "Let us therefore draw near with confidence to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and may find grace to help in time of need." And that's what I hope this time is for you.
[time=95] I know it is for me.
[time=96] Every time we gather together, I know I'm in need of mercy and in great need of help.
[time=102] And so my prayer and my hope is that as you hear the word of God again today, that it will be for you that help, that it will be for you that source of mercy and encouragement that it always is and continues to be for each of us.
[time=117] We wanted to give you a chance this morning to just be encouraged as we've talked about it.
[time=122] It's one thing to talk about and it's one thing to teach about it, but then to actually hear from some people right here in our own family who have experienced what that's like to realize that God's ways and His thoughts are leading you a different direction.
[time=136] And that different direction will oftentimes bring you with it all kinds of challenges and opportunities for growth.
[time=144] So I want you to meet Angela who's a part of our family here.
[time=147] She ministers to many of you week after week as she helps lead worship here.
[time=153] And Angela in recent days has gone down a road she wasn't planning on and wanted to just have her share her story with you, her family, so you could be encouraged by what God has been doing in her life.
[time=168] - Like Kelly said, I can't stand up here and not think about what God has done in this first in my life in the last few months.
[time=177] Recently my husband and I lost our third baby and we were so excited like many couples are when they are expecting a baby.
[time=186] We had literally been given the gift to be able to go through fertility treatment again and we're so excited and had gone through treatment for three months, got pregnant.
[time=196] We were so excited our daughter Paige was going to be a big sister and just could hardly wait.
[time=202] And God had a different plan for us, the baby that we were due in September, I miscarried and had to end up having surgery in March.
[time=212] And it has been extremely difficult to read this verse and know that God's way was different than mine because we had it all planned out.
[time=225] Paige was going to be starting school in the fall and we were going to have a baby born in September and I wasn't going to have an empty house when she left for school.
[time=233] And it was difficult and the questions that she came up with, I hadn't had to deal with before and it was hard answering questions from a four year old that it surprised me the questions that were so deep and just got me right here.
[time=252] And I just, I struggle with that for a long time and God gave me words to say, he gave me ways to comfort and he even gave her ways to comfort me back and as well as her dad.
[time=264] And through all of this, I think the biggest thing that I've learned is that God is faithful.
[time=273] I see it in other areas of our life.
[time=276] I've seen it especially in the area of having children.
[time=280] We miscarried our first child.
[time=282] Our second child was born 14 weeks early, weighing 15.1 ounces and that in itself was an incredible miracle that God let us see and he let us witness through three weeks of his life.
[time=298] And after that, I thought there's no way that God could bless us any more than he did in Drake.
[time=304] And a year and a half later, he blessed us with a little girl and her name is Paige and she will be five this month.
[time=311] And she is the greatest gift, the most precious gift that God has given to us other than dying on the cross for us.
[time=320] And she continues to be a blessing to us and I'm sure will be for years to come.
[time=326] And it would be nice sometimes through those hard, dark days when she was sick the last few months and I've been sick and during that time, I don't know how you are but when I'm not feeling well and I'm tired because I'm taking care of a sick child, my mind starts telling me things that my heart doesn't believe and that gives way for doubts and confusion to set in and kind of draws you away from God.
[time=357] And those are the times that you need to turn your eyes on him because even though I would like a sneak preview of the coming interactions of what God has for my life, that's not what he wants.
[time=369] He wants us to trust him and that's hard to do and it's hard to remember during those hard times that God isn't putting us through and allowing us to go through trials to hurt us.
[time=382] He's putting us through that to grow us and I have a verse that I have had to read many times in the last few months and I'd like to share it with you.
[time=391] It's found in James, the first chapter, the second verse and it says, "Consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance.
[time=404] Perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything." And that's been a hard one.
[time=413] That's been hard to deal with that this isn't something that I'm hurting through because God wants me to hurt through.
[time=421] He wants me to grow and he wants me to mature.
[time=425] And no matter what God has in store for us, like Kelly said just a few weeks ago in his sermon, when God closes one door, he opens another.
[time=435] And I know God closed that door for us right now but I know from past experience that when he closes a door that he's got an even more amazing door ready to open for us.
[time=448] And that's why I say God is faithful.
[time=450] It's whatever you're holding on to and whatever trial you're going through this morning, hold on to that because he is faithful and will carry you through just like he has Eric and Paige and I.
[time=462] - Amen, thanks.
[time=465] The question for you this morning as we continue is are you willing at the heart level?
[time=469] Are you willing at the heart level to trust and to trust in a way that allows you to keep walking down roads that sometimes makes sense and sometimes just don't?
[time=479] Are you willing to really trust?
[time=484] (gentle guitar music) [MUSIC - 187 seconds]
[time=683] (gentle music) - I wanna give somebody else another member of our family here.
[time=696] The chance is to share with you folks some of what's been going on in her life.
[time=700] This is Sharon and many of you may know Sharon.
[time=703] She does an awful lot for this place and makes an enormous contribution every week in the area of ministry of worship and works right alongside Scott and others and we love her.
[time=714] And we're so glad she's here.
[time=716] She's experienced Isaiah 55.
[time=719] Recently in her life, God's kind of chosen a path that probably wasn't what you had in mind, I would suspect.
[time=726] And I want you to just let her briefly tell you her story and where God has her these days.
[time=733] - Well, two and a half years ago, I was sitting in the music office and I got a phone call from the doctor's office.
[time=741] I had an MRI, it was a routine MRI for me.
[time=745] Every two years, I have to have one because of my family history.
[time=749] And that phone call pretty much changed my life.
[time=752] They said, "We have good news and bad news for you.
[time=755] "You do not have a brain aneurysm, but you have a mask." The word mask just didn't throw me too much.
[time=765] And they said, "We are immediately setting you up "with a neurosurgeon in Fort Wayne." And so I called Paul and that whole day, I didn't say anything to Scott.
[time=778] I thought, "I'm not gonna upset anybody.
[time=779] "Maybe this is absolutely nothing." But through course of the two and a half years, seeing many doctors here in Fort Wayne and Indianapolis, neurosurgeon, neuro-optimologist, they determined that I needed to have radiation to shrink the tumor if possible, to at least stop it from growing.
[time=800] It's not operable, it is benign, which I'm thankful for.
[time=806] But I had the radiation for five and a half weeks, Monday through Friday, and during those five and a half weeks, Scott was just absolutely incredible.
[time=818] He would speak to me in the neatest ways.
[time=823] God created me to love music and to love to read.
[time=827] And he would speak to me through the Bible.
[time=829] One of the verses that he gave me was Isaiah 41, 13, which talks about, "I will hold you with my right hand.
[time=838] "Do not fear." And so I held onto that every day.
[time=843] And also he spoke to me through Christian books and through Christian music.
[time=850] And so God is a very personal God.
[time=853] He is my best friend.
[time=856] One of the things that I've struggled with in my life
[time=863] over the years is significance.
[time=866] And I asked God, "God, why did you create Sharon Borer?
[time=869] "What is my purpose in this life?" And God spoke to me several years ago through a book called Wisdom Hunter.
[time=879] I consider myself a wisdom hunter.
[time=882] And through the message of that book and through a Christian conference, God told me, "Sharon, I created you "to minister to people and to praise me." And he said, in that book it says,
[time=899] "Let God have your life, let wisdom guide your life,
[time=907] "and let people be your life." And that's what God was telling me.
[time=911] And so I consider that an awesome purpose in life.
[time=916] That's why we, all of us, all of us as Christians are created for that.
[time=923] And our significance cannot be put in where we are on the totem pole of life in our jobs,
[time=931] who we hang around with with people.
[time=933] It has to be, our focus has to be in Jesus Christ.
[time=937] He thought so much of us that He died for us as Christians.
[time=942] And one of the songs I would like to read the words to you of one of the songs that has meant a lot to me during the time that I was going through radiation.
[time=954] The words are from the song, "I can't live a day without you." It's by the group Avalon.
[time=961] It says, "I couldn't face my life tomorrow "without your hope in my heart.
[time=965] "I know I can't live a day without you." Lord, there's no night and there's no morning without your loving arms to hold me.
[time=974] You're the heartbeat of all I do.
[time=976] I can't live a day without you.
[time=979] Oh, Jesus, I live because you live.
[time=982] You're like the air I breathe.
[time=985] Oh, Jesus, I have because you give your everything to me.
[time=989] You're the heartbeat of all I do.
[time=992] I can't live a day without you.
[time=995] And we're about to sing a song "Greatest by Faith Funnest," and it's my most favorite, you know?
[time=1001] And so I just thank you for the opportunity to share.
[time=1004] (gentle guitar music) [MUSIC - 111 seconds]
[time=1133] (gentle guitar music) [MUSIC - 114 seconds]
[time=1280] (lively music) [MUSIC - 156 seconds]
[time=1446] (audience applauding) - Well, why don't you open your Bibles this morning
[time=1458] to Acts chapter 21.
[time=1462] And I wanna ask you the question as we start this morning, who do you listen to in your life?
[time=1469] Who is it that you listen to?
[time=1473] A lot of questions get asked in your life in mind every single day.
[time=1478] A lot of questions being asked.
[time=1481] In your life and in our culture, who is it that you listen to?
[time=1485] Should you go out with him?
[time=1487] I mean, you've kind of been wondering if you would or not, and now he's asked.
[time=1491] Should you go out with him?
[time=1494] Is she the one you should ask to marry you?
[time=1497] Should you move?
[time=1499] Different city, different state, take that new job or should you stay?
[time=1505] Should you claim every single source of income?
[time=1510] When it's time for taxes, should you divorce and start over or give him another or her another chance?
[time=1518] Should you confront a dear, close friend on a potentially volatile issue?
[time=1523] And you know down deep in your heart the moment the words come out, the moment the confrontation takes place regardless of how loving and kind and sensitive you are as you do it, you just know what will follow.
[time=1535] Confusion, pain, anger, volatility.
[time=1538] Should you cheat on that test?
[time=1544] Knowing that instructor would never, ever, ever know.
[time=1548] Should you cheat in any way, shape, or form on your job?
[time=1551] Should you take the promotion and travel more or stay where you are, sit tight, be at home more?
[time=1560] As a leader, should you make the hard decision now or give it more time to possibly sort itself out?
[time=1565] As a parent, should you get involved or stay quiet?
[time=1570] As a parent, should you say yes or should you say no?
[time=1575] See, life is packed with choices and every day you and I have to make them and like me, you've probably learned this very sobering reality.
[time=1584] Once you make one, it's done.
[time=1590] Now there's what'll come and sometimes you get the chance to make another one or two or three that helps somewhat straighten out the first one, maybe, but bottom line, every single choice has its own set of what I call irreversible ripples.
[time=1604] You make the choice and it's done.
[time=1609] You might be able to offset this or alter that, but most of the time decisions made are decisions lived with so, with so much on the line, who do you listen to?
[time=1620] Where do you go?
[time=1623] Let's remind ourselves this morning still in the context of this introduction.
[time=1627] Let's remind ourselves this morning of three commonly pursued sources.
[time=1631] You do it all the time, I do it all the time.
[time=1634] Three commonly pursued sources of advice that can, that may, they don't always, but they have the high potential at times to lead you and I astray.
[time=1645] Three sources of advice that can lead us astray, and we're gonna see all of these later played out in our passage here in Acts 21.
[time=1655] First of all, write this down number one, our own conscience.
[time=1659] Oftentimes that's where you go, oftentimes that's where I've gone.
[time=1663] There are days when we just simply go to our conscience, right now next to conscience, our hearts.
[time=1671] I cannot begin to tell you how many, hundreds of times, I've sat with people over the last 15 years, personal lives imploding, families, marriages, careers, spiraling out of control, pain, destruction, and carnage everywhere, all because of a choice that got made, or two or three.
[time=1692] And then you hear before deadly words of decision making.
[time=1697] That's when I hear it.
[time=1701] And you've sat with folks and you've heard it and there have been times when people have heard me say it, times when these four words have probably slipped out of your mouth as well, it really felt right.
[time=1715] It really felt right, they say.
[time=1720] I thought, I, me, I thought it was a good move.
[time=1725] In my heart, I really believed it would work out.
[time=1729] I had a good feeling about it, they say.
[time=1734] In my heart, and I sit there as you sit there and say in your heart, huh?
[time=1740] Our hearts are good gauge by which to make decisions is the heart a good place to begin when it's time to make tough life-affecting choices.
[time=1752] God didn't seem to think so when, through the prophet Jeremiah, he said this, and I believe it'll come on the screen.
[time=1759] Jeremiah, speaking on behalf of God said in Jeremiah 17, the heart is more deceitful than all else and is desperately sick.
[time=1769] Who?
[time=1770] Who can understand it?
[time=1773] God says the heart is desperately sick.
[time=1777] It is more deceitful than all else.
[time=1780] And you need to be, and I need to be reminded every once in a while that the human heart left to itself when it's natural leanings is a very, very dangerous place to begin, when it's time for us to seek advice on how we're going to decide what we're going to choose.
[time=1796] Go back to Genesis eight.
[time=1798] Go back to Genesis 8, 21, if you will.
[time=1802] First book of the Bible, just reiterate this point briefly,
[time=1808] can we?
[time=1809] Genesis 8, 21 gives us some insight as to the condition of our heart.
[time=1813] Genesis 8, 21 gives us a look into its depravity and the trouble and the danger that exists there as you are, I would go to our hearts as a place of beginning for decision making.
[time=1824] It says here, in Genesis eight, the flood has taken place and God has brought Noah and his family through.
[time=1831] And it says in 8, 21, in verse 20, the altar to the Lord is built.
[time=1838] They make this burnt offering and it says in 21 the Lord smelled the soothing aroma.
[time=1843] And the Lord said to himself, "I will never again curse the ground on account of man for the intent of man's heart is evil from his youth." And then I.V. it would say even though every inclination of his heart is evil, from his youth it says, and I will never again destroy every living thing as I have done, from birth, right?
[time=1870] I mean, from the get-go.
[time=1872] Nobody taught your kids to say no.
[time=1874] Nobody taught your kids not to share.
[time=1876] Nobody taught your kids or mine to have bad attitudes.
[time=1880] No, it's who they are, it's who we are.
[time=1882] From the very beginning we're born with hearts that are inclined, God's word says toward evil.
[time=1887] And left unchecked you and I both know where that leads.
[time=1892] We see examples of that daily in this world, in this culture that we live in.
[time=1897] So sometimes we go to our conscience, our hearts, not a good idea most of the time.
[time=1903] Secondly, we go to other people.
[time=1906] Other people, and let me explain this, while it does say in Proverbs 11, 14, and in other places in the scripture.
[time=1914] In Proverbs 11, 14 it kind of lifts up the idea of others.
[time=1917] It says in verse 14 of chapter 11 in Proverbs, "Where there is no guidance the people fall, but in abundance of counselors there is victory." It says that there and it lifts up the idea of counselors in other places.
[time=1934] But while that's true we've got to be careful because for instance when Nehemiah was rebuilding the wall back in the Old Testament book of Nehemiah you read the story during the captivity, the wall around Jerusalem had been destroyed, God calls Nehemiah, God calls Nehemiah to rebuild the wall.
[time=1950] And while he's rebuilding the wall, it says in Nehemiah 2, 19, it says this.
[time=1957] It says, and you're gonna have to bear with me on these names, all right.
[time=1961] I've been practicing all week but it's still a little rough.
[time=1963] But when Sanbolat, that's a nice name, huh?
[time=1966] Sanbolat, would you like to be called San?
[time=1968] Maybe they just call them Sandy for short, right?
[time=1970] But when Sanbolat, the Horonite and Tobias, the Ammonite official and Geshim, the Arab, heard it, they mocked us and despised us and said, what is this thing you are doing?
[time=1984] Are you rebelling against the king?
[time=1986] These three where if you read the story and you understand the context, there are these three guys who are counselors.
[time=1992] These three guys were supposed to be the wise ones and here this trio of wise counselors comes along and says to Nehemiah, what are you doing?
[time=2002] Knock it off, you're gonna disrespect the king.
[time=2005] Yet Nehemiah had received his marching orders from God.
[time=2009] These guys question his motives later in chapter six and later on in the story wronging advised him to flee for his life.
[time=2016] What's the point?
[time=2018] The point is this, sometimes the advice of others is sincere people and sometimes it is sincerely what?
[time=2025] Wrong, sincerity, passion, feeling, isn't the gauge.
[time=2032] Sometimes they can be sincere, sometimes they are sincerely wrong.
[time=2038] Sometimes I think where we go astray on this one is right here, it's in Proverbs.
[time=2043] Look back at Proverbs, go forward to Proverbs 22.
[time=2047] You gotta point this out and we gotta make note of this.
[time=2051] Sometimes I think where we go astray on this whole going to others thing is right here in Proverbs 22, 17.
[time=2059] I want you to turn there and if you don't have a Bible, just look on with someone next to you.
[time=2065] I want you to see this, it says here, in verse 17 of chapter 22 in Proverbs, it says, incline your ear and hear the words of the, what?
[time=2074] Say it again, the who?
[time=2078] The wise, incline your ear, go to hear the words of the wise and now watch what the wise are connected to in this next line and apply your mind to my knowledge.
[time=2096] Did you catch that?
[time=2098] You got a question?
[time=2099] You need some advice?
[time=2100] Yeah, there is wisdom in the counsel of others.
[time=2103] Apply, incline your ear and hear the words of the wise because when you go to the wise as defined here, the wise are those who will apply who know and understand my knowledge.
[time=2116] His knowledge is found where?
[time=2118] Right here.
[time=2119] Now the point of application for you and me is this and how many times have you heard it?
[time=2126] Or better yet, how many times have you yourself even done this?
[time=2131] Your attitude toward God at the present moment, whatever the situation might be, this may have been a week ago, this may have been two years ago, it may have been 10.
[time=2138] But you've been there, I'm sure you have.
[time=2140] There's this point in time when your attitude toward God just stinks.
[time=2144] You're not walking with him on a regular basis.
[time=2148] You're contemplating and very close to making a sinful foolish decision.
[time=2152] And so you go to get counsel from those who will tell you what you want.
[time=2158] Want to hear.
[time=2159] You do it and I do it way too often.
[time=2163] We're not walking where we should be, we're not thinking as we should be, we're dangerously close to an edge.
[time=2170] And our spirits and our hardened hearts, we sometimes, we go to a while, we go to counsel, we go to people who we believe.
[time=2181] And our troubled hearts at that time will tell us what we want to hear.
[time=2184] Please be reminded this morning, you guys, please, please be reminded of this great truth, others may have good insight, but only when their perspective begins with God, is it wise.
[time=2196] And you and I desperately need counsel.
[time=2200] Too many times I hear, well, my boss at work said, my therapist said, my friend who knows me really well said, my family said, and all that might be okay if you're boss and you're therapist and your friend who knows you well and your family all base what they're telling you on the truth, on that which really matters.
[time=2224] But unless they do, unless it begins with, and unless that advice and that counsel stays true to the only absolute source of life guiding truth, then you and I can be in a lot of trouble sometimes.
[time=2237] Some go to their conscience, some go to others, another source of advice that can lead to trouble is, number three, write it down, tradition and human logic.
[time=2246] Tradition and human logic.
[time=2249] What did tradition tell Jonah?
[time=2253] God said in Jonah, chapter one verse two, remember?
[time=2259] Pretty simple, he said, arise and go to where?
[time=2264] Nineveh, God told Jonah, arise, get up and go to Nineveh.
[time=2269] Well, what did tradition tell Jonah the Jew about Nineveh and Ninevites?
[time=2277] See, tradition had taught Jonah his whole life to stay as far away from Nineveh as he could because Ninevites were no good.
[time=2284] Tradition told him stay away.
[time=2288] What did tradition tell Peter in this book of Acts that we've been studying?
[time=2292] What did tradition tell Peter about Gentiles?
[time=2295] Stay what?
[time=2296] Stay away, don't mix.
[time=2298] What did logic, what did logic tell Jonah
[time=2304] when Jo and God said arise, go to Nineveh and cry against it?
[time=2309] Logic said it's impossible for this many people to repent before God destroys them.
[time=2315] Tradition and logic screened this, God said this.
[time=2321] What did logic say to Moses when God spoke to him through a fiery bush and said, go be by spokesman in the hub of the world?
[time=2330] Go talk to Pharaoh, go speak on my behalf to the Pharaoh.
[time=2334] What did logic say to Moses?
[time=2336] What did logic say to Joshua when God says march around a wall seven times?
[time=2341] But God said go.
[time=2344] How many times, how many times if we missed God's best because we've been stuck on the way it's always been?
[time=2353] Now hear me, there are times when tradition and logic lead to wisdom and blessing.
[time=2358] I believe that's true and I believe that with all of my heart tradition and logic aren't always bad, but you have to and I have to be careful.
[time=2367] We have to be open in our spirit to what God's doing because there are times, too many times when tradition and logic can lead to missed opportunities.
[time=2377] Now you take all of that, you take all of what we just said and you look at Paul's situation in Acts 21 and we're gonna do that right now in the next few minutes.
[time=2386] Acts 21, what was happening, number one in Paul's conscience?
[time=2391] What was happening in Paul's conscience?
[time=2395] Which will Paul?
[time=2396] Paul's got some decisions to make.
[time=2401] And number one, I want you to look and see what was going on in his conscience because many times conscience left to itself can be a very dangerous thing.
[time=2407] We've established that fact.
[time=2409] Other times though, conscience can be guided properly.
[time=2412] Conscience can be affected, influenced by the word of God
[time=2418] and the people who've got in this case the person of God himself.
[time=2421] And for this, you're gonna actually go back to Acts 20.
[time=2424] Again, it was back in Acts 20, I believe, verse 16.
[time=2427] It's the first place to see it in Acts 20, 16.
[time=2433] It says, "For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus in order that he might not have to spend time in Asia, for he was hurrying to be in Jerusalem if possible on the day of Pentecost." And then down in verse 22, it says, "And now behold, bound in spirit, I am on my way to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there." And now he says, "Behold, bound in spirit." Paul sensed the clear leading of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2462] Paul's conscience, Paul's heart was being told by God himself to move toward this place of Jerusalem.
[time=2469] Now God spoke in those days literally.
[time=2471] And it was actually a little easier back then following conscience.
[time=2476] And in this case, it was good because it was a conscience guided by the very words of God.
[time=2481] Does God speak today?
[time=2482] Not in that way.
[time=2484] But answer the question, does God speak today?
[time=2486] Absolutely, where?
[time=2488] Right here in this book, that very book you hold, the very book we have open this morning is the place that God has spoken to give you guidance and to give me direction.
[time=2498] And he guides and leads your conscience and mind as we subject it to the words of truth.
[time=2504] It's not audible, but the very words of God can guide our conscience just like it did Paul's.
[time=2511] And those words are right here.
[time=2513] His words right here in this book for you to look at, read, study and take in on a daily basis.
[time=2518] In this case, as x21 begins to unfold, his conscience is being directed by the very spirit and word of God.
[time=2526] So his conscience is motivated by truth.
[time=2529] And it comes up against, you see here in chapter 21, other people.
[time=2533] We go to that second source of advice.
[time=2536] Other people go over to 21, pick it up in verse four.
[time=2540] 21, four, after looking up the disciples, we stayed there seven days.
[time=2546] And they kept telling Paul through the spirit not to set foot in Jerusalem.
[time=2551] And when it came about that our days there were ended, we departed and started on our journey while they all, with wives and children, escorted us until we were out of the city.
[time=2561] And after kneeling down on the beach and praying, we said farewell to one another.
[time=2565] Verse six, then we went on board the ship and they returned home again.
[time=2569] See that in verse four, they kept, we stayed there seven days and they kept telling Paul through the spirit not to set foot in Jerusalem.
[time=2579] You ever been there?
[time=2581] People, people believing, people thinking they know exactly what God's will for your life is.
[time=2587] Ever since that, you ever felt that, you've ever been in those situations where they just tell you and they tell you and they tell you in different ways, but they tell you again and again and again.
[time=2596] They're sure of what God's will is for your life.
[time=2601] Paul faces it says there in verse four, they kept telling him that kind of paints the picture in the original language of a constant barrage of opinions.
[time=2613] And you do notice there in the text, you see it there, it says through the spirit, kind of confusing for some as they read that, through the spirit, they kept telling Paul through the spirit not to set foot in Jerusalem.
[time=2626] Some wonder if maybe Paul should have listened, some read that text and wonder if Paul shouldn't have kind of backed up.
[time=2633] Maybe this was them giving him godly direction and he shouldn't have gone to Jerusalem, but more than likely, as you read through that again and as you study that, and as you kind of break that down, more than likely the people were misinterpreting the spirit's predictions.
[time=2648] The spirit had made no qualms of what would happen.
[time=2651] And oftentimes, as the spirit predicts, oftentimes, as he did with Paul, he was clear, you're gonna face danger in every city.
[time=2659] And more than likely what happened here is they misconstrued the predictions of danger as prohibitions from going.
[time=2665] And look at what happens next.
[time=2668] The advice just keeps coming.
[time=2670] Now from those citing common sense or logic.
[time=2674] Pick it up in verse seven, chapter 21.
[time=2678] It says, "And when we had finished the voyage from Tyre, "we arrived at Paul Amias and after greeting the brethren, "we stayed with them for a day.
[time=2686] "And on the next day, we departed and came to Caesarea "and entering the house of Philip, the evangelist, "who was one of the seven, we stayed with him." Now this man, it says in verse nine, had four virgin daughters who were prophetesses.
[time=2699] And as we were staying there for some days, a certain prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.
[time=2704] And coming to us, he took Paul's belt and bound his own feet and hands and said, "This is what the Holy Spirit says.
[time=2712] "In this way, the Jews at Jerusalem "will bind the man who owns this belt "and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.
[time=2721] "And when we had heard this, we as well, "as the local residents began begging him "not to go up to Jerusalem." Verse 13, then Paul answered, "What are you doing?
[time=2733] "What are you doing weeping and breaking my heart?
[time=2736] "He says, "You're killing me.
[time=2738] "For I am ready not only to be bound, "but even to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.
[time=2744] "And since he would not be persuaded, "we fell silent, remarking the will of the Lord be done.
[time=2750] "And after these days, we got ready "and started on our way up to Jerusalem.
[time=2754] "And some of the disciples from Caesarea also came with us, "taking us to Manassen of Cyprus, "a disciple of longstanding with whom we were to lodge.
[time=2764] "And when we had come to Jerusalem, "the brethren received us gladly." So Agabus comes down and he makes his prediction again
[time=2774] and it wasn't a new prediction.
[time=2777] The Spirit had been saying this, this had been made known back even a few chapters.
[time=2782] And what do they all say?
[time=2785] You know what struck me as I read this isn't so much what they said, it's what they didn't say.
[time=2789] And it struck me because I think too many times in your life and in mine, it's kind of the same way.
[time=2794] Nobody said to him, I mean, that we can see, at least in what's recorded for us.
[time=2800] Nobody said to him, hang in there, Paul.
[time=2803] We know you're being led of God.
[time=2807] We realize the Spirit's been at work.
[time=2809] Nobody says to him, hang in there, Paul, be faithful.
[time=2812] You take your shots and I'll just kind of stand here by you and we'll walk this road together.
[time=2818] We don't do that today.
[time=2821] Someone comes to you, someone comes to me in crisis, hurting and headed towards more.
[time=2826] And too many times I think we run to rescue.
[time=2830] And when's the last time we said to them lovingly, not with a cold heart or spirit, wow, you know what, this must just be, it must be your turn for this.
[time=2841] Boy, it must be difficult.
[time=2842] And I imagine it's confusing, but you know what, it must be your turn.
[time=2845] This is obviously what he's allowing.
[time=2847] This is obviously what he wants.
[time=2849] And so you know what, I'll just walk along this road with you.
[time=2852] I will do my best to hold you up.
[time=2854] I don't believe those conversations happen enough.
[time=2859] And too often times what happens with friends and with family and you know what, we do it especially with kids.
[time=2864] Too often times what happens is we fix the pain, we alleviate the pain, we keep the pain, the discomfort, the learning, growing opportunity at bay.
[time=2875] Some things to think about from this passage.
[time=2884] Some things to take home with you.
[time=2888] Some truth to just kind of chew on and consider.
[time=2890] Paul found himself in the midst of a situation where God was leading, is conscious.
[time=2895] In this case we believe was right.
[time=2897] He comes up against other people and a stand on logic that would have tried to lead him in a different direction and yet Paul stays true to that which God had led him towards.
[time=2907] You've got some things to think through this week.
[time=2909] I've got some decisions to make today.
[time=2911] And you may think you have no decisions to make today, but you know how God is sometimes.
[time=2918] Within the next two or three hours you may be faced.
[time=2921] With the opportunity or the need to go get some advice or even possibly to give some.
[time=2928] So think about this, okay folks?
[time=2929] As you go home today I want you to think about three things.
[time=2932] Number one I want you to think about this.
[time=2935] Truth to take, number one if you seek advice, be discerning and honest.
[time=2941] If you seek advice, write it down, please be discerning and honest in your seeking of the advice.
[time=2949] What do I mean by that?
[time=2950] What I mean by that is this, please don't kid yourself.
[time=2953] Please have enough integrity and please have enough smarts to realize that with so much at stake it's very important that you would be honest as you go to seek the advice.
[time=2965] One author said it this way, be careful.
[time=2969] Go to the right sidelines.
[time=2973] He kind of was relating life to a game and he said go to the right sidelines, get your counsel and advice from those on your team and when you go to your sidelines go to the coach, not the water boy.
[time=2986] As for time outs they are unlimited.
[time=2988] Call one whenever you need one and one other thing.
[time=2990] He says this, go while the game is still in progress.
[time=2993] For example a man who knows things are not going well with his wife but is convinced he can handle it by himself and may sadly and tragically discover that when he finally goes to the sidelines for help the game is actually what?
[time=3008] Over.
[time=3009] Time has run out, the clock has been turned off.
[time=3014] If you seek advice be discerning and be honest.
[time=3018] Secondly, write this one down, if you give advice, if you give advice, have that advice be God or truth oriented.
[time=3031] Have that advice that you give be God or truth based.
[time=3036] And I hope it goes without say as I say that to you
[time=3042] I hope the obvious which is implied is true to you as you hear it this morning.
[time=3046] If you're gonna give advice that's truth based you've gotta know the truth.
[time=3052] You've gotta know what the truth says and you've gotta be able to communicate that truth in loving practical ways.
[time=3060] Lastly let me say this to you.
[time=3064] If you decide and this is an important one and I say this to you kids here this morning I say it to you students, I say it to all ages young and old middle aged, gotta realize this.
[time=3078] Some of you need to realize this for the very first time.
[time=3080] Some of you know this but like me you need to be reminded of this principle.
[time=3086] Often if, number three, if you decide against truth oriented counsel, you're honest, you go to the right sideline,
[time=3102] you go and there's enough time left and the sideline gives you truth oriented counsel.
[time=3109] If you decide to go against it, write this down, be ready.
[time=3117] Be ready for what?
[time=3120] Well, I'll let you fill that in.
[time=3122] Go back to Proverbs 28.
[time=3123] Go back to Proverbs 28 verse 14 'cause as is always the case in Proverbs
[time=3134] it is said straight and it is said clear and it is said very powerfully.
[time=3140] Proverbs 28 verse 14.
[time=3147] Proverbs 28.14 says this, "How blessed is the man?
[time=3157] "Who fears always," stop right there.
[time=3161] You understand this phrase fears.
[time=3163] This fear is the fear of God.
[time=3165] This fear is a healthy, good fear that you and I should possess on a daily, moment by moment basis.
[time=3173] This fear is the kind of fear that lives life and stands in absolute awe of the truth and God in his ways.
[time=3180] Blessed is the man.
[time=3182] God's word tells you this morning and tells me blessed.
[time=3187] This man, this woman will be cared for, lifted up, provided for, blessed is the man who fears always, but here you go.
[time=3197] He who hardens his heart will fall into calamity.
[time=3204] Calamity, write it down, be ready for calamity.
[time=3209] If you're gonna choose to harden your heart against truth oriented counsel, God's word here and in other places reminds us time and time again.
[time=3219] It will not go well and it may go well tomorrow, it may go well next week and by human standards your choice may even be a success but you know and I know today 'cause God's word reminds us again today that if you choose against truth oriented counsel calamity will come and it will come like a whirlwind and it will strike and somehow, some way, God's truth will prevail, you'll have to, as I've had to, learn yet another hard lesson and it doesn't have to be that way.
[time=3255] When you seek advice, be honest, to give advice, be careful and you know what?
[time=3263] If you decide against it, that which is truth oriented, be ready, be ready.
[time=3270] Let me invite you to just stand right where you're at if you would and just close your eyes and we'll end this morning with a word of prayer and as we do that, let me just invite you to consider this as we go.
[time=3283] Your head's bowed and your eyes closed.
[time=3288] I'm very aware of the fact that there would be possibly many, many here this morning and some of you call this place home and others of you may even just be here for the first or second or third time.
[time=3300] You know, either way, there's many I bet who are here having to contemplate even today a decision that you need to make and it has to do with job or it has to do with family or it has to do with your pursuit of God, your search for him, I would guess that there are many in the room this morning who have questions, who have decisions and choices that you need to make, you must make and I know what it's like and many others in this room this morning know what it's like to face decisions and choices, not having a clue.
[time=3334] I mean, if all things were said and if we were completely honest there are times when we've had to make decisions and we feel like we're making them alone and I just want to invite you, anybody this morning, if you've got some things you need to talk through, if you've got some decisions that you need to make and you want to do your best to at least seek out some counsel that would be at least if nothing else, truth based and we would love the chance to talk with you, myself and maybe even others from our elder board or our staff could be down here in the front and if there was any questions at all that you had about anything in life we would do our best to guide you and give direction and give you some things to think about based upon the only thing we know that really matters and can give direction to life and that is his truth, his absolute truth and so come this morning if we can be of help.
[time=3388] Father, thanks for the chance today to lift up your name, thank you for the opportunity of hearing from Angela and from Sharon and I'm sure there's many others this morning who could give testimony to the fact that you are so very faithful and it was so sweet to sing it, great is your faithfulness and God we would pray as we leave that that faithfulness would stay active, guiding us and leading us to just the right people, bringing to pass in our lives God just the right events.
[time=3420] - Hey, before we leave today, I wanted to ask a favor of you if I can, we don't often ask things of you but in this case, I felt like it was appropriate.
[time=3432] Many times I bump into folks during the week who tell me they watch the Bible hour and oftentimes you share with me how encouraging it is, what a help it's been to you in times of need, how it's been used of God to kind of come along and make a difference in your life and that means a great deal to me when I hear that but you need to know there are so many others in this organization here in this church that help make the Bible hour possible.
[time=3458] Many hours are spent each week and people faithfully give of themselves to help make this broadcast possible.
[time=3465] I would love for them to hear what's on your heart.
[time=3469] I would love for them to hear the stories of how God has used the Bible hour to effect change and bring hope and encouragement to people.
[time=3476] So if you wouldn't mind, if you'd just take a minute or two this week and write us a note, the address of the church is gonna come up on the screen as the broadcast closes.
[time=3486] Our email website address will be there as well.
[time=3489] We would love to hear, make the note attention to me and I'll make sure those get passed along.
[time=3495] Let us hear how God has used this broadcast and this ministry to encourage you in your hearts and lives.
[time=3501] Thanks.
[time=3502] (gentle music)
