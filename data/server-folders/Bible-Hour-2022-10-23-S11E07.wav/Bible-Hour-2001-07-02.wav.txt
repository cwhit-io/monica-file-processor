[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] - Those words, those phrases that you just saw, they bring with them each of them their own set of questions and issues, family, anger, confusion, loneliness.
[time=42] And those are things that all of us face.
[time=45] And you know, as we come together every week here at Black Hawk, all of us facing those things in different ways at different times, one thing I find myself so very thankful for again and again is that the Lord Jesus Christ, the one whom we come to honor and look to, is one who understands all of those things.
[time=65] You know, it says in Hebrews chapter 4, in verses 15 and 16, "For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses but one who has been tempted in all things as we are yet without sin." Now listen to this.
[time=80] Verse 16 says, "Let us therefore draw near with confidence to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and may find grace to help in time of need." And that's what I hope this time is for you.
[time=95] I know it is for me. Every time we gather together, I know I'm in need of mercy and in great need of help.
[time=102] And so my prayer and my hope is that as you hear the Word of God again today, that it will be for you that help, that it will be for you that source of mercy and encouragement that it always is and continues to be for each of us.
[time=117] You are holy, holy.
[time=129] Lord, there is nothing like you.
[time=135] You are holy, holy, glory to you alone.
[time=149] You are holy, holy.
[time=156] Lord, there is not like you.
[time=162] You are holy, holy, glory to you alone.
[time=176] I'll sing your praises forever, deeper in love with you.
[time=189] Here in your cards, wear and close to your clothes.
[time=196] I've found where I belong.
[time=202] I'll sing your praises forever, deeper in love with you.
[time=215] Here in your cards, wear and close to your clothes.
[time=221] I've found where I belong.
[time=227] You are holy, holy.
[time=234] Lord, there is not like you.
[time=240] You are holy, holy, glory to you alone.
[time=251] I'll sing your praises forever, deeper in love with you.
[time=265] Here in your cards, wear and close to your clothes.
[time=272] I've found where I belong.
[time=278] I'll sing your praises forever, deeper in love with you.
[time=291] Here in your cards, wear and close to your clothes.
[time=297] I've found where I belong.
[time=309] I'll sing your praises forever, deeper in love with you.
[time=315] Here in your cards, wear and close to your clothes.
[time=321] I've found where I belong.
[time=327] You are holy, holy.
[time=334] Lord, there is not like you.
[time=340] You are holy, holy, glory to you alone.
[time=353] You are holy, holy.
[time=360] Lord, there is not like you.
[time=366] You are holy, holy, glory to you alone.
[time=389] You are the one, the only one worthy of our praise.
[time=393] Please accept these gifts of worship and praise.
[time=400] May they be pleasing to your ear.
[time=403] In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[time=405] Would you please stand with us.
[time=407] You are worthy of our praise.
[time=413] Guys, start us out now.
[time=415] I will worship, I will worship, all of my heart.
[time=422] All of my heart.
[time=424] I will praise you, all of my strength.
[time=430] All of my faith.
[time=432] I will see you, all of my faith.
[time=438] All of my faith.
[time=440] I will follow my heart.
[time=444] All of my faith.
[time=448] I will give you all my worship.
[time=456] You are Lord, I love to worship.
[time=460] You are Lord, I worthy of my praise.
[time=472] I will bow down.
[time=477] You ask me.
[time=479] I will serve you.
[time=484] Give you everything.
[time=490] I will bow down.
[time=493] I ask you, you are Lord.
[time=497] I will trust you.
[time=501] You are Lord, I will give you all my worship.
[time=509] I will give you all my praise.
[time=513] You are Lord, I love to worship.
[time=517] You are Lord, I worthy of my praise.
[time=529] I will bow down.
[time=533] You ask me.
[time=535] Give you everything.
[time=537] I will serve you.
[time=541] Give you everything.
[time=553] I will trust you.
[time=559] You are Lord.
[time=561] I will give you all my worship.
[time=569] You are Lord, I love to worship.
[time=573] You are Lord, I worthy of my praise.
[time=581] I will give you all my praise.
[time=585] You are Lord, I love to worship.
[time=589] You are Lord, I worthy of my praise.
[time=593] But this morning, if you would,
[time=607] open up your Bibles to the Book of Acts.
[time=609] And we are actually, if you kind of followed the few announcements I just gave you there.
[time=615] Oh, and I should say this.
[time=617] Following the 22nd, we begin a five-week series.
[time=621] And I really want you to write this down.
[time=623] I want you to kind of make a note of this in your mind.
[time=625] I want you to pray for this, please.
[time=627] Beginning the 29th of July and on through each Sunday in August.
[time=633] We're going to be doing a series entitled Worship.
[time=637] Fully surrendered.
[time=639] Completely in awe.
[time=641] Worship.
[time=643] A five-week look at what it really means.
[time=645] What the Scriptures teach about this thing called worship.
[time=651] And by worship we don't necessarily just mean our corporate times of worship.
[time=656] This isn't going to be just about music or singing or praise.
[time=661] We will touch on that.
[time=663] But no, the much bigger, the much broader, the much more important issue of lives, lives lived in worship.
[time=671] What does it mean for you?
[time=673] And what does it mean for me to live a life of worship and obedience before God today in this culture, today in this church.
[time=681] Five weeks, worship.
[time=683] Completely, fully surrendered, completely in awe.
[time=686] You don't want to miss it.
[time=687] And it's going to be a great, great opportunity for all of us.
[time=690] And so that'll go through the end of August, which means that this morning is kind of our last time in Acts for a while.
[time=696] And we'll be back to Acts, come September.
[time=699] But with that in mind, I wanted to take this morning, if I could, and kind of give all of us who have been along on this journey, the opportunity to just kind of stop and pause and think back, to actually look back on some of what we've seen, some of what we've learned, some of what we've considered.
[time=718] This has been an exciting for me personally.
[time=722] I don't know about you.
[time=723] Many of you I've heard from, and it seems as if for a lot of us, it's been the same.
[time=726] It has been for me an exciting, convicting, faith-stretching step as we have watched these faithful Christ followers live life,
[time=737] face life, endure life, do all that they did in an effort to be followers of Jesus Christ.
[time=746] Though 2000 years removed, we've seen week after week after week, that our mission and opportunity that we have today are still the same, and that when you do away with all the external trappings and cultural differences, what you're left with are some vitally important, non-negotiable church guiding principles that we must continue, that we must, in this place, in this family, continue to embrace.
[time=773] Week after week, as I've set across the street there in my office, and as I've poured over this book and as I've read and tried my best with God's help to just gain insight into what it's saying and what it means.
[time=786] Week after week, I've been reminded of a lot of things.
[time=790] One of the things that I see week after week is that this small band of believers that started, if you'll remember back in that upper room,
[time=800] huddled together, lonely, scared, kind of uncertain, unsure.
[time=805] What I've seen week after week after week and what God has reminded me of is that this small band of believers changed the then-known world.
[time=817] They changed it, you guys.
[time=820] They changed their world.
[time=825] Their devotion and their faith and their willingness to live life, the way God called them to, they changed the world.
[time=834] They, with the gospel and the power of the Holy Spirit in hand, made a difference and impacted their culture with truth, love, and devotion.
[time=843] And just thinking about that again this week leads me to want to again this morning ask you, do you, do you want to?
[time=852] Do you really, do you really want to?
[time=857] Do you really want to change the world?
[time=860] What do you really want for this place?
[time=862] What do you, those of you that call this place home, what do you want for Black Hawk?
[time=868] I mean, when we get right down to it down deep in your heart, do you really want to change the world dramatically impact for Wayne and see lives touched and changed eternally?
[time=880] Does that represent the driving passion of your heart and life?
[time=886] And that's a question for every one of you this morning.
[time=889] Does that represent the driving passion of your heart and life?
[time=893] Just under, as we've said before, just under God and family.
[time=898] I mean, just under God and family is being a part of a world changing eternity altering band of Christ followers, the most important endeavor in your life.
[time=909] And I'm really asking, I'm really asking, every one of you,
[time=917] does it mean that much to you?
[time=922] Isn't that important?
[time=924] Are you thoroughly given over to this place and its people, and most importantly, our mission?
[time=930] And why do I make a big deal out of our mission?
[time=933] I make a big deal out of our mission, and I talk about it, and I pray about it, and I hope for it in your life in mind, because you know what, he gave them a mission.
[time=941] And we looked at that some 30-plus weeks ago, and he started this study, in Acts 1-8, he says, and I'm paraphrasing, you shall be my, what?
[time=952] Witnesses.
[time=954] He said to them, he said it to him earlier, and it's recorded for us in Acts 1-8.
[time=958] He said, you, the Holy Spirit, will come in power.
[time=960] And he looked at them, this small band of Christ followers, and he said to them, and he gave them their mission in saying, and he said, you shall be my witnesses.
[time=971] And you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in Judea, and in Samaria, and to the remotest parts of the world.
[time=982] And he gave him, he gave him something to get up for.
[time=985] He gave him something to give their days to, and they took it, and they grabbed hold of it, and they lived it.
[time=992] And we've been told, we've been told, it's not quite the same, we didn't huddle in an upper room with him somewhere, but no, we've been told led by the Holy Spirit as we have thoughtfully and prayerfully considered what our purpose would be in this culture, in this city, in this community.
[time=1011] We've been told, we've been led, we believe, to be a family doing all that we can to help seeking people, both saved and searching, find and follow Christ.
[time=1024] He has given us something to live for.
[time=1026] He has given me something to get up early every day for.
[time=1029] He's given me something to go about at night dreaming about.
[time=1033] He's given you, and he's given me something to give our days and nights to.
[time=1038] Now, what we've seen so far in the first 21 chapters of this book, in my opinion, is mission accomplished.
[time=1045] I mean, there's still more to go, there's still more to see, there's still more lives to touch, still new churches to be birthed.
[time=1051] But what you and I have seen in these first 21 chapters is this small band of Christ followers who gave every ounce of their lives and their hearts and their spirits to the mission that he gave them, and people everywhere, people in Jerusalem, people in Judea, people in Samaria, and now it's spreading to the remotest parts of the then-known world, and they're coming to know of faith in Christ, because there were some people, not especially gifted, not enormously talented, just a group of people,
[time=1087] with faith that reached deep into their hearts who were willing to be used of God, and it was the most important thing they had gone, and they made tents and they grew crops, and they did all that they did, but it was all just a means to an end, because there wasn't anything more important
[time=1107] than being his witness.
[time=1111] So what about you, and I am asking, every one of you that calls this place home, what about you, middle school student, high school student, young adult, moms and dads, middle aged, older folks, every one of you, what about you? Do you want to be a part of something like acts?
[time=1133] And let me ask it to you this way. What about your life today?
[time=1138] Some of you I see nodding your heads, and it encourages my heart.
[time=1143] Some of you I see pondering the question, and I know you're thinking about it.
[time=1147] Well, let me just ask you this. What about your life today?
[time=1153] What about your life today? About the way you do work, the way you do family, the way you do ministry, the way you do finances? What about you today?
[time=1162] What would give evidence to the fact that you are completely and thoroughly in?
[time=1167] Completely and thoroughly given in your heart. Not to a building, but to a mission.
[time=1172] Not to a phrase, but to the truth behind the phrase.
[time=1177] When you look at your life today and all components of it, what about that picture would scream out to an on-looking culture?
[time=1188] There's nothing more important to me. The greatest endeavor in all of life below God and family is I'm a part of a band of believers doing their very best with God's help to help seeking people find and follow Christ.
[time=1204] What would that look like in your life? What would it look like in mind?
[time=1208] Let me just remind you of the four, let me remind you of the four E's that are a part of what we're giving ourselves to around this place.
[time=1218] We're trying our very best to help seeking people find and follow Christ, and we have said to you, and we've taught on it in the past, and we will teach on it in the future, that there seems to be four things that if you're really, and I'm really completely at heart levels given over to,
[time=1235] these four things in the day-to-day of life, not just when we gather, but as we go and live, if there is a commitment that runs deep in your heart to evangelism, then how's that going with you these days?
[time=1251] How's it going with you in your own heart, in your own life, as you give yourself to the possibility of God leading you to the privilege of building redemptive relationships, genuine, meaningful friendships with those asking questions, those wanting to know more, those trying to understand this thing called faith.
[time=1272] How are you doing in your own personal pursuit of those opportunities that God might bring, encouragement, evangelism, encouragement, the readiness on your part, the willingness on your part, to come alongside me as I might have opportunity to come alongside you, our chance to kind of live life together in a way that says, "You know what? I love you. I care for you.
[time=1295] You're a part of the greatest thing going in all of mankind, the body of Christ, and I will do anything and everything I can to meet needs and encourage your spirit.
[time=1305] Speak truth into your life." How are you doing in that arena these days?
[time=1312] The opportunity to encourage evangelism, encourage many quipping.
[time=1316] We've said it before and we'll say it again.
[time=1318] Equipping is kind of a two-sided thing.
[time=1320] You have an opportunity every week on Wednesday nights and Sunday mornings.
[time=1325] And many of you in the ABFs, some of you in small groups, you have ample opportunity in this place to hear the Word of God taught and communicated.
[time=1334] And in the process, you get equipped through the Spirit of God by the Word of God.
[time=1340] You get built up in your faith and understanding of truth so that the flip side of the coin, you can go and equip others.
[time=1350] What's your ministry today here at Blackhawk?
[time=1354] What are you on a regular basis rolling up, serving sleeves, and with that which God has equipped and invested into you, sharing that with others?
[time=1365] What's your ministry?
[time=1366] I'm asking.
[time=1367] Where are you serving on a regular basis?
[time=1372] In an effort to do what you can with His help to equip others.
[time=1377] Evangelism, encouragement, equipping and exaltation, we believe, because Jesus said it, John 4, He said He looks.
[time=1386] Actually, He says He's seeking out those who would worship Him in what?
[time=1390] In spirit and in truth.
[time=1393] And so we've said that we want to be a body of people given not just in 70 minutes on Sunday or 60 minutes on Wednesday nights.
[time=1399] No, but seven days a week, 24 hours a day, a people given to exalting our Lord.
[time=1408] Spending time with Him, worshiping Him.
[time=1411] Living lives of obedience.
[time=1414] Romans 12-1.
[time=1419] So you've got to ask yourself again.
[time=1421] And you have to because I keep having to.
[time=1424] And every week I ask myself, am I really in?
[time=1427] I mean, as I read about these men and women, I have to ask myself again and again, does it mean that much to me?
[time=1435] And am I willing to go that far, willing to give that much?
[time=1441] And so as the Spirit of God kind of prodded me again to ask those questions of myself,
[time=1448] this week as I look back, I just felt the need and the opportunity to ask you again as well.
[time=1454] And so I've asked you, and I'm really asking, and I want you to answer.
[time=1459] And you can answer to me or you can answer to, you know, most importantly, you've got to answer to Him.
[time=1465] But we'd love to know.
[time=1467] And I'd love to hear how God's working and moving in your heart as He makes this place.
[time=1472] And His ministry here, even more and more so, important.
[time=1478] Worth while to you.
[time=1481] So keep giving it some thought.
[time=1483] What have we seen?
[time=1484] Twenty-one chapters, thirty-plus weeks.
[time=1487] What have we been exposed to?
[time=1488] Hopefully. Hopefully what truths embodied by these faithful followers of Christ.
[time=1497] Hopefully we've seen these truths and are in the process of living out and applying some very important truths.
[time=1503] I thought of about ten, but I whittled it down to four as I look back over the last several weeks.
[time=1508] Four vital truths that come to mind as we look back in attempt to follow suit.
[time=1518] This church, the church in the book of Acts, was number one.
[time=1524] And this may stand out in your mind.
[time=1526] It kind of doesn't mind, in my own mind.
[time=1529] It kind of stands out as the overarching kind of above everything else.
[time=1533] When I look back on twenty-one chapters and I think about this faithful church that has now grown and these people that were a part of it, they were united.
[time=1541] Write it down.
[time=1543] This church, the church in the book of Acts, was united.
[time=1548] They were united.
[time=1549] These people lived and faced all of life together.
[time=1554] Go with me back to Acts chapter two.
[time=1558] Flip back in your Bibles to Acts chapter two.
[time=1564] Many of you will remember this passage from our study of this chapter.
[time=1568] It says there in Acts chapter two and some exciting things were going on.
[time=1573] Luke the author of the book picks it up there in forty-two and says this as he describes these early believers.
[time=1578] He says in verse forty-two and they were continually devoting themselves to the apostles' teaching.
[time=1585] And a fellowship to the breaking of bread and a prayer and everyone kept feeling a sense of awe and many wonders and signs were taking place through the apostles.
[time=1595] Those who had believed were together and had all things in common and they began verse forty-five selling their property and possessions and were sharing them with all as anyone might have need.
[time=1607] And day by day continuing with one mind in the temple and breaking bread from house to house,
[time=1614] they were taking their meals together with gladness and sincerity of heart.
[time=1620] He's a kicker, verse forty-seven, praising God and having favor with all the people and the Lord was adding to their number day by day those who were being saved.
[time=1630] How many times in those five verses did you see the word together?
[time=1636] How many times in those five verses do you get the sense that they were together?
[time=1642] As you read through that passage and I wanted to ask you to go back to Acts four.
[time=1647] Flip over a few pages to Acts four thirty-two.
[time=1651] And again as we read listen for and pick up that sense of how they lived their lives,
[time=1657] their lives of faith, they lived them together.
[time=1660] And there was a deep commitment to each other.
[time=1663] There was a unity there people that was simply amazing.
[time=1667] Verse thirty-two of chapter four and the congregation of those who believed were of one heart and soul
[time=1674] and not one of them claimed that anything belonging to him was his own.
[time=1678] But all things were common property to them and with great power verse thirty-three.
[time=1684] The apostles were giving witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and abundant grace was upon them all.
[time=1691] For there was not a needy person among them.
[time=1694] For all who were owners of land or houses would sell them and bring the proceeds of the sales
[time=1701] and lay them at the apostles' feet and they would be distributed to each as any had need.
[time=1710] Wow.
[time=1713] What a picture.
[time=1716] And you know what makes me think about you and it makes me think a lot about me.
[time=1724] And I think to myself you know what if?
[time=1729] What if around here?
[time=1731] What if in our little world here?
[time=1734] What if in this family?
[time=1738] What if income levels could not divide us?
[time=1745] What if net worth, house size or type of car could not separate us?
[time=1751] What if personal backgrounds, past failures, current struggles had absolutely no bearing
[time=1762] on who we were together?
[time=1765] And what if married, single, divorced kids, no kids, Democrat, Republican, red, yellow, black or white?
[time=1772] What if it made absolutely no difference at all?
[time=1776] What if we were just the body of Christ?
[time=1781] What would that be like?
[time=1785] And you know what all those things I just mentioned there?
[time=1789] Income level.
[time=1791] We don't do so good around here.
[time=1795] In my opinion.
[time=1797] At times we don't do so good around here with that.
[time=1800] At times my experience has been that folks on either end of that.
[time=1805] Attitudinally in the way they view and the way they interact or don't.
[time=1811] I think there's some work to be done there.
[time=1817] Past failures, current struggles.
[time=1823] I don't know you guys.
[time=1824] Sometimes I think we do really really well with that.
[time=1829] Once in a while some things come down the pipe and you'd almost think that maybe we were
[time=1836] uncomfortable having struggles in our midst.
[time=1841] And again there's good days and bad days.
[time=1846] And I think we're growing and I think we're getting there.
[time=1849] But what would it be like to have all of it?
[time=1851] Income, house, car, past struggles, current failures.
[time=1854] What would it mean to have all of it make absolutely no difference?
[time=1858] And the way we cared for came alongside, looked at, talked about each other.
[time=1868] What would happen if none of it made a hill of beans difference?
[time=1872] Write these two things down.
[time=1875] Write them down because this is the truth.
[time=1877] You can take this to the bank.
[time=1879] If none of it mattered and we really viewed each other and really lived with each other
[time=1885] with that kind of heart, two things would happen.
[time=1888] Number one, there would be an absolute overabundance.
[time=1891] Write it down.
[time=1892] An overabundance of met needs.
[time=1897] Physically, emotionally, financially, there would not be a single need in this place.
[time=1906] I mean really, if we really lived life, Acts 2, Acts 4, and that was your spirit and that was mine,
[time=1913] physical needs would be being met constantly daily.
[time=1917] And we wouldn't even hear about half of them because you would hear about them and it would get met.
[time=1922] Physically, physical needs, emotional, relational needs, financial needs.
[time=1927] There would be an overabundance of met needs in every category.
[time=1933] If Acts 2 and Acts 4 were really the way we lived and approached life together in this place.
[time=1940] Here's the second thing that would happen, very, very exciting.
[time=1943] And I've seen it take place.
[time=1945] I've watched it right before my eyes.
[time=1947] I've sat with people, you guys, across the street in that office.
[time=1951] I've sat on this stage on a Sunday at 12.15.
[time=1954] I've heard these words come out of people's mouths.
[time=1959] And what I've heard is this.
[time=1961] I have heard seeking, searching people who have yet to figure it all out, who have come into this place and they have watched you and they have sensed your love for each other.
[time=1972] They have seen a spirit in your eyes and a way of dealing with things they've never seen before.
[time=1977] And I have watched seeking, searching people sit right there and say, "You know what? It is really attractive to be in a place where people love and care for each other the way.
[time=1988] I see people loving and caring for each other here."
[time=1994] A searching, on-looking world that watches unity and selfless love in action
[time=2000] is captivated and attracted to the truth that is behind that kind of love.
[time=2008] And they ask, "Why?
[time=2012] How can people treat each other so well?" When it's working right, when the church is who the church is supposed to be,
[time=2023] they just don't know what to make of it.
[time=2025] And that's exciting. Look at verse 47, you guys.
[time=2028] Don't think for a moment that it's coincidental that having describes, excuse me, back to chapter 2,
[time=2035] don't think for a moment that it's not connected because it is.
[time=2041] Having just listed, having just kind of communicated for us the essence of their unity
[time=2047] and their radical, reckless love for each other.
[time=2051] And what's the last phrase there in 47?
[time=2054] And the Lord was adding to their number day by day those who were being saved.
[time=2059] Make no mistake, salvation is of the Lord. That's true.
[time=2063] But when there is a body of believers living life like this, all they come, and they ask.
[time=2071] They're captivated by the love we have for each other.
[time=2076] People, this church, in these first 21 chapters, they have been and they still are united.
[time=2082] Second thing, they were unashamed.
[time=2085] They were unashamed. Go back to 2 again. Go back earlier in chapter 2 to verse 14.
[time=2091] Give you a couple of examples of this. They were unashamed early on in the story,
[time=2098] as it's still just kind of unfolding. It says in chapter 2, 14.
[time=2104] "But Peter," you there? "But Peter, taking his stand with the eleven,
[time=2110] raised his voice and declared to them." Stop right there.
[time=2115] Okay, stop right there. Eyes up here.
[time=2118] Don't forget. Don't forget what preceded this.
[time=2123] Okay, this is early on.
[time=2126] Okay, the crucifixion.
[time=2129] What those people had done to Jesus, the way he had been treated, his death, his brutal, gory, ugly death, was not that far removed from this day.
[time=2141] There was still an attitude. There was still a tension.
[time=2144] There was still some. You could feel it in the air back then.
[time=2148] This was not a, this was not a confident, secure time to be a believer in that city.
[time=2156] And yet they huddled together in that upper room, and the Spirit of God came in a miraculous way, and we studied that, the tongues of fire and the dwelling of the Spirit, and the preparing for ministry, and all the people came and rushed around, and back in 13 or 12, they wanted to know what's this mean, and others were mocking verse 13, saying they're full of sweet wine.
[time=2178] People thought they were drunk, as the languages of the other nations began to be spoken
[time=2184] by these followers of Christ who had been indwelt in a special way by the Spirit.
[time=2189] And it was time for the ministry to begin.
[time=2192] It was time for the church to be birthed. It was time for the gospel to grow, and in a culture, and in a setting, and in a climate that was absolutely against them.
[time=2203] This fisherman raised his voice and declared to them just a faithful guy
[time=2217] in the midst of a world that must have been so confusing and so scary, and he raised his voice, and he declares to them, "Men of Judea, and all you who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you and give heed to my words."
[time=2233] And off he went, proclaiming and teaching and saying the truth.
[time=2240] Man, it took guts. Man, it took courage, and he was not ashamed.
[time=2249] Later on, if you go back to verse 17, we were just there recently.
[time=2254] Acts 17, pick it up in 22.
[time=2261] Acts 17, 22.
[time=2265] Oh my, remember this? This is where Paul had come to Athens.
[time=2269] And he has this incredible opportunity. He's actually invited to go and speak at the areaopagus.
[time=2275] It was the think tank of the modern world. It was all the great thinkers.
[time=2279] It was all the great and current philosophers. It was everybody who knew anything.
[time=2284] And they were the most respected and revered minds in that day.
[time=2287] And they say, "Come tell us about your Jesus." And Paul, on his own, in this great city in front of all of these people in this center, in this hub of philosophy and thought, stands.
[time=2303] He stands, it says there in 22, and Paul stood.
[time=2307] In the midst of the areaopagus and said, "Men of Athens, I observe that you are very religious,
[time=2313] that you are very religious in all respects for why I was passing through and examining the objects of your worship.
[time=2321] I also found an altar with this inscription to an unknown God.
[time=2326] What, therefore, you worship in ignorance." I love that he said that word to those guys. Did you get it?
[time=2335] He stands there and says, "What you have worshiped in ignorance this I proclaim to you."
[time=2342] Write it down, folks. Make a note. Please don't forget it.
[time=2345] A fully devoted follower, having spoken or chosen what is true,
[time=2352] a fully devoted follower is willing to have him think whatever they will think.
[time=2360] Having spoken what is true, having chosen what is true, a fully devoted follower of Christ
[time=2366] is willing to have him think whatever they will think.
[time=2370] Now, I want to make sure you don't write this down.
[time=2373] A fully devoted follower doesn't care.
[time=2377] I think there's an edge in that that I don't like.
[time=2381] And I think sometimes it's unwise and even detrimental.
[time=2386] Because you know what? As I live my life, and I hope as you live your life and as we make decisions, because I love, because I'm trying my best to love
[time=2396] the people that God puts in my world, I care what they think.
[time=2401] I care what their response is.
[time=2405] Now, I can't be controlled by that.
[time=2408] I can't be oblivious to you. I care.
[time=2411] I don't want to say to you and I don't want you to run around thinking, "You know what? A fully devoted follower just doesn't care." And he or she just says what's right and does what's right and throws all caution to the wind and bugs him and bugs him, "I don't care." No, I want you to care.
[time=2425] I want you to care what they think.
[time=2427] I don't want you caring about them to stop you from choosing or saying the truth.
[time=2433] In fact, I think it's impossible.
[time=2437] Sometimes not to.
[time=2439] But you've got to state the case.
[time=2441] You've got to say what's right. You've got to live out your faith knowing that acceptance and popularity made dwindle.
[time=2449] I think it's okay to care.
[time=2452] Don't be governed by it.
[time=2454] Don't be quiet when you should speak.
[time=2456] Don't back away when you should act.
[time=2459] Let me say that to you one more time and I want you to think about your world.
[time=2462] I want you to think about those you live with on your block.
[time=2464] I want you to think right now this morning about those you work with.
[time=2466] I want you to think about family members.
[time=2468] You know because you've been in conversation with.
[time=2470] And I want to say it to you one more time.
[time=2473] And whoever you are, whatever situations brewing, whatever circumstance may be kind of happening
[time=2481] in recent days or weeks, the Lord's saying it to you this morning.
[time=2486] Don't be quiet when you should speak.
[time=2492] Don't back away when you should act.
[time=2497] They were unashamed.
[time=2500] Thirdly, they were unafraid.
[time=2503] They were unafraid.
[time=2505] Act seven.
[time=2507] Go back a few pages.
[time=2509] Acts chapter seven.
[time=2512] They were united.
[time=2515] They were unashamed and number three, they were unafraid.
[time=2519] Go to Acts 754.
[time=2525] If you remember back, this is where we studied the story of Stephen.
[time=2529] Stephen's defense of the truth.
[time=2531] Stephen's amazing message that he preached and his death that immediately followed.
[time=2543] And this guy again, he stood up with all the boldness and with all the guts and with all the courage you could ever imagine in a hostile environment.
[time=2550] And he said to these folks what needed to be said.
[time=2553] And he said it straight forward.
[time=2556] And he said it with love, but he said it straight forward.
[time=2559] Didn't back down an inch, gave him the gospel.
[time=2562] Told him what they needed to hear about them and their hearts and what they had done.
[time=2569] And they didn't like it.
[time=2571] You remember?
[time=2572] They didn't like it at all.
[time=2574] Which is what so many times happens when we hear the truth about us.
[time=2578] We don't like it and so we respond.
[time=2581] And boy did they respond.
[time=2583] Look at what it says in 754 and now when they heard this, they were cut to the quick.
[time=2588] And they began gnashing their teeth at him.
[time=2593] Did you read that?
[time=2595] Did that jump out at you the last time we studied this?
[time=2597] It didn't quite jump out at me the way it did this week.
[time=2601] How are you doing?
[time=2603] If you're standing there and you say something to somebody and they don't like it so much so they begin to gnash their teeth at you.
[time=2613] And this is a crowd of people, a large growing crowd and they are gnashing their teeth at
[time=2619] him.
[time=2620] But being full of 55 but being full of the Holy Spirit he gazed intently into heaven.
[time=2627] When he saw the glory of God in Jesus standing at the right hand of God and he said behold.
[time=2633] I got to get out of here.
[time=2636] No.
[time=2637] He said behold I see the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God but they cried out with a loud voice and covered their ears and they rushed upon
[time=2647] him with one impulse and when they had driven him out of the city they began stoning him
[time=2653] and the witnesses laid aside their robes at the feet of a young man named Saul who would
[time=2659] later come to Christ and change His name to what Paul 59 and they went on stoning again
[time=2669] history history books would tell us that a stoning of this nature would last upwards to an hour and they went on stoning Stephen as he called upon the Lord and said Lord Jesus
[time=2680] received my spirit and falling on his knees he cried out with a loud voice Lord do not hold this sin against them and having said this he fell asleep not mastered by fear.
[time=2695] I should have entitled number three deeply trusting but it didn't start with a you so
[time=2702] you got unafraid deeply trusting these people you guys they trusted God and with Stephen
[time=2715] I'm sure there was some fear but I don't think the question is can you live the Christian life without fear is the answer is no you're going to be afraid sometimes it's not was there
[time=2724] an absence of fear it's for Stephen and for you and for me it's what you do with it and
[time=2731] he kept going with his deeply trusting God don't be paralyzed by it don't dump it out all over
[time=2742] others no hand it off to God and keep taking steps move on deeply trusting sometimes people
[time=2752] ask me how long am I supposed to deeply trust okay I get it I'm supposed to deeply trust but how long they say am I supposed to deeply trust and my answer is always the same to the day you die
[time=2765] because when will there ever be a day you guys on in this world in this time in your life in my
[time=2772] when will there ever be a day when we won't need to deeply trust for some thing in some
[time=2779] situation in some circumstance no it'll always be there the need for you and me to deeply personally
[time=2785] trust and we'll do that till the day we die fourthly they were unhindered they were unhindered and
[time=2793] we'll end with this and then we're going to sing one more time this morning and here's how I'd say it and we've said this before and this again is just kind of revisiting this very important truth
[time=2805] they were unhindered when you make listen now when you make choices when every one of you in
[time=2812] this room this morning when you make choices and choose to live your life according to the truth
[time=2820] when in your walk in your daily relationship with him you live your life according to his wisdom when you obey god and you live with a clear conscience before god then you know you're in god's will and knowing you're in god's will brings a confidence to endure
[time=2838] whatever may come because you know you're in the right place it may be a confusing place
[time=2844] it may be a painful place it may be a difficult place but when you live your life according to
[time=2851] what is right and absolutely true when it's his wisdom you seek and when it's his will that you seek
[time=2859] to surround your life with then at least you know that whatever may come you're in the right place
[time=2868] for the right reasons because he's at work inside of you and me when that's the case it's just like
[time=2875] what we saw in act 16 turn there and we'll close with this when you make the right choices when
[time=2881] you live in his will when you submit to his wisdom when you walk down the path today and tomorrow
[time=2890] and the next day and next week when the path that you walk is the path that he's called you to walk
[time=2896] in this book then you can respond and you can feel inside what i'm sure paul felt in 1623 from 1623 it says this and when they had inflicted many blows upon them they threw them into prison
[time=2917] commanding the jailer to guard them securely and he having received such a command through
[time=2924] them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks but about midnight paul and
[time=2930] silos were praying down in the deepest part of this Philippian jail about midnight paul and silos
[time=2938] were praying and singing hymns of praise to god and the prisoners there you go again others
[time=2948] you with me those on the outside looking in as they watch people in dire straights
[time=2954] in difficult circumstances when they see the family of god living life with a certain attitude
[time=2961] and perspective says in 25 and the prisoners were listening to them and so we'll remind
[time=2971] it again to sing hymns sing songs to lift praise because at least we know when we're walking
[time=2978] with him that we're in the right place i'm gonna ask the folks to come on up we're gonna end with one last song and as they come let me ask you if you were to just stand where you are and as you stand would you bow your heads just stand right where you're at and i just want to i want to invite you to do what you already did this morning
[time=2999] and with your heads bowed and you can you can open up your eyes and lift your heads in just a moment but for now just in a moment of just quiet reflection i want you to think back on these people
[time=3011] that we've been studying these faithful followers of christ who we've watched kind of go before us
[time=3019] and i just want you to thank god right now for what they did i want you to thank god in your own words in your own heart for the kind of attitude that they had and that the and that we can today
[time=3032] thank him that we can today week after week learn from them be challenged by them be encouraged and reminded and father that is our prayer our prayer is today one of thanks because we know that
[time=3050] because of what these people did with your help and for your glory um we know that there is uh
[time=3057] there's absolutely nothing that we can accomplish with your help
[time=3064] there is absolutely nothing that we face that we can't overcome
[time=3070] because of your presence in our life and god as you saw fit to walk through those days
[time=3078] with these people we pray you would continue to walk through life with us and as we look to you and as we look to your word and as a as a people as a family here at

[time=3413] we'll see you soon hey before we leave today i wanted to ask a favor of you if i can we don't often ask things of you

[time=3441] difference in your life and that means a great deal to me when i hear that but you need to know there are so many others in this organization here in this church that help make the bible hour possible many hours are spent each week and people faithfully give of themselves to help make this
[time=3458] broadcast possible i would love for them to hear what's on your heart i would love for them to hear
[time=3464] the stories of how god has used the bible hour to affect change and bring hope and encouragement to
