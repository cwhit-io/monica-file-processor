[time=26] Hi, I'm Kelly, pastor here at Blackhawk, and I wanted to take just a minute if I could
[time=37] to tell you about something that's upcoming here at Blackhawk in the next few weeks, beginning the last week of July and extending all the way through the month of August.
[time=46] We are entering into a six-week series about the topic of worship.
[time=51] We've entitled it fully surrendered, completely in awe, and we can't wait to look and see
[time=57] what God's Word says about living lives of worship.
[time=62] Worship too many times, I think, is kind of just allocated to the 60 minutes or so we spend
[time=69] on Sunday mornings or Wednesday nights.
[time=71] That's kind of what we think worship is, and you know God's Word says it's so much more.
[time=76] And we're going to look at what it means to live fully surrendered lives, to have a fully surrendered home, going to talk to moms and dads and kids, going to talk about fully surrendered
[time=86] churches and the way they carry themselves and the way they serve and the way they give.
[time=90] It's going to be a great six-week look at this whole idea of living lives fully surrendered
[time=96] and completely in awe of God, lives of worship.
[time=100] We'd love for you to join us.
[time=101] Come visit us and study and learn and look into that with us, and if you can't at least
[time=107] tune in, it should be a great six weeks.
[time=137] We're going to look at what we're doing to live in. We're going to look at what we're doing.
[time=159] We're going to look at what we're doing to live.
[time=354] He's the person that you answer to when you leave this realm.
[time=359] God could look like what you want the being to be.
[time=363] Sunshine.
[time=364] An all-knowing omniscient being.
[time=369] He's the one that everybody worships, I guess.
[time=373] I have no thought of God, so.
[time=376] I've never been at church before except for when I got married, so I don't think about him.
[time=384] [MUSIC - 6 seconds]
[time=397] God is strong, very unique.
[time=401] Powerful, kind, forgiving, judgmental.
[time=406] [MUSIC]
[time=407] Did you have to tell your cross on me?
[time=409] Stern, far off distant.
[time=413] Cruel sense of humor.
[time=415] He's probably like a father to a lot of people.
[time=417] I really know nothing of, you know, like a bottom.
[time=420] Other than what I've learned in class and stuff like that, but I don't know whether to believe it or not.
[time=426] [MUSIC]
[time=435] Who's God to me?
[time=437] God is something that I don't know.
[time=441] I've grown to believe it's just everywhere.
[time=444] Sometimes I think he's good, sometimes I think she's bad.
[time=447] Find a God, find yourself to me.
[time=449] Someone that you can always talk to, just everything to me.
[time=455] [MUSIC]
[time=458] He's a navigator, basically, you know what I mean?
[time=460] He helps people go through life.
[time=463] He helps people keep saying, if we need help, he's there to help us, and when we're looking for an answer, he has the answer, as long as we know where to look.
[time=473] For me, God's a name and a lot of books and people say it a lot, and that's about it.
[time=479] I think he has a plan for all of us, and he's there to help us find it.
[time=484] To me, God has guided me through everything, and God has always been there, and that's the one constant.
[time=492] He's a big question mark for me, and I would like to believe, but I haven't had the sign yet, and no one is, I haven't had the feeling to step over and give up my life to God just yet.
[time=504] Waiting for a sign, I guess.
[time=508] The sign, I guess.
[time=510] [MUSIC - 322 seconds]
[time=841] Well, how do you hear that and not just take a moment and pray? Would you join me? Bow your heads.
[time=849] Father, we come before you this morning so very thankful and so anticipating what is one of the greatest privileges of all and that has got to be in your presence here in your house with your people and with those who have come convinced of who you are and your existence and your care and those still searching those asking questions that need to be asked and God, we are just for all who have come so very grateful.
[time=875] Most importantly, God, we are as joy and Marty and the choir and the band as they just proclaimed so powerfully.
[time=883] God, we are amazed that a God of your stature and a God of your character also has a heart like you do and you are near.
[time=893] You want desperately to live with us and to walk with us and to be ever present and we thank you for the fact that you are.
[time=903] And we hope today as we look to your word and as we think through some of these truths, God, that for those of us who understand that we might even understand it in a more clear and powerful fashion.
[time=914] And as we look to your word and as we ask some questions and seek out some answers, God, I pray that those searching would be able to today not because of me and not because of my words, but because of the truth that we lift up here today, that they might sense possibly
[time=931] for the first time, what it means to really know you, to really understand truth, to understand what it is that you gave your son that we might live.
[time=941] God, we thank you for being near and we look forward to our time together this morning in your son's name, we pray. Amen.
[time=949] Well, we do want to welcome you. It is so good to be together and it is great for the morning that we've got a little bit of a different morning than usual.
[time=957] We're going to take a little bit of time here and think through this issue of God and his nearness and then we're going to finish up the morning with some worship.
[time=964] If you look at the world today, if you were just to kind of ask society or culture what they think about God, you would hear a lot of different answers, a lot of different opinions.
[time=976] We've kind of this morning for the sake of our discussion. I want to just kind of start us off by showing you three of those.
[time=983] There are some today who, when you ask them about God, they would look you in the eye and say, "There is no God."
[time=992] Those who would answer that way, we would call atheists. Atheists believe, as the screen's going to show you, that there is no God.
[time=1000] Some would say that they're not sure.
[time=1005] You know, he's maybe kind of out there, maybe kind of not, an agnostic might have the response. You know, not quite sure about the existence of a God, not quite sure what's out there.
[time=1015] There's another group of folks that we would call deists. And you may have heard different definitions of these three words in the past. That's fine.
[time=1023] But for this morning's discussion, a deist. A deist would say this to you. I think there's a God out there.
[time=1031] But I don't think for a moment that he cares. I think he's out there. I think he's detached. I think he's distant.
[time=1042] Several years ago, there was a song put out by one of the pop icons of the last 20 years. She sang it like this.
[time=1051] Remember, she said, "From a distance, God is watching." Remember that song? That's a deist. Believes there's a God out there, but would tell you, you know, I have nothing to leave me to believe that he really cares or is involved.
[time=1068] And that's an interesting thought. And you know what the fact is? Our views of God from the very beginning of life so many times shape the way we continue to think and view this issue of God and his existence.
[time=1081] Our view of our dads, our view of our parents. In so many situations, so many times have gone a long, long way to help form and shape our view of God.
[time=1092] We would say this morning, and God's word will support it, that he is near, that he cares, and that one day we're going to end up getting to meet him.
[time=1104] But let's start with the first one. He's near. And let me do this if I can. I asked Rick and his boy to come on up.
[time=1111] Rick, why don't you guys come up and we're just going to do it this way. Sometimes the view that we have, sometimes the view that we get of God, it's Caleb, right?
[time=1125] Hey, Caleb, how are you, buddy? Good to see you. Put it there. Wrong hand, I know. I'm weird.
[time=1131] Sometimes the way we do this is this. Caleb, would you stand right here, buddy? Would you kind of stand right over here, right there? Good job, partner.
[time=1140] Just kind of stand there, and just kind of look, just kind of look lost. Just kind of like, yeah, that's good. Good job, dude. You're doing great.
[time=1149] Now, where's Steve? Steve, come take, they're going to take you, man. They're going to take you to a spot that I've got for you.
[time=1155] And I want you to see how this works. A lot of times, Caleb, and even when I was Caleb's age, sometimes, even though you know I had good parents and all, sometimes my view of God, even as a, what are you, partner, seven, six?
[time=1169] Yeah, sometimes a six-year-old like Caleb begins to kind of wonder about God and where he is and what his involvement is.
[time=1179] Does he care and is he watching and all that kind of stuff? And sometimes what happens is this, we begin to have a view of God, come on over here, Rick, to the middle, right there in front of those lit plants.
[time=1194] Sometimes what happens is this, and you know what gang, this is meant to be an analogy, the father something, it's meant to be an analogy, an illustration.
[time=1204] But you know, and I know, that too many times, and I don't believe it's the case with Rick and Caleb, but too many times this is real life.
[time=1216] Too many times you get a child here with a picture of God or father, Rick, just kind of fold your arms, just kind of look out that way.
[time=1230] There you go, you see him up there, he looks kind of silly in those plants, doesn't he?
[time=1234] Just kind of stay right there, Caleb. Just kind of look out there, Rick, and hold your spot there, and Caleb, you can sit down there and just make yourself comfortable, just sit right there, buddy.
[time=1243] You know what it says in Psalm 1? There you go.
[time=1249] You know it says in Psalm 145, that this right here, this picture, isn't true of the way God views and interacts with us.
[time=1260] Look what it says in Psalm 145, "The Lord is righteous in all his ways and kind in all his deeds, the Lord is near to all who call upon him, to all who call upon him in truth."
[time=1272] It goes on in Psalm 139, Psalm 139 verses 3 to 10, it says this about our God, it says, "Thou does scrutinize my path, and my laying down, and art intimately acquainted with all my ways."
[time=1287] Even before there is a word on my tongue, behold, oh Lord, thou does not know at all.
[time=1292] That passage goes on in verse 5 and says, "Thou hast enclosed me." Watch this. "Thou hast enclosed me behind and before, and laid thy hand upon me."
[time=1304] Such knowledge is too wonderful for me. It is too high. I cannot attain to it.
[time=1308] Where can I go from thy spirit, or where can I flee from thy presence?
[time=1315] And then verses 8 and 9, it says, "If I ascend to heaven, thou art there. If I make my bed and she hold, thou art there. If I take the wings of the dawn, if I dwell on the remotest part of the sea, even there thy hand will lead me, and thy right hand will lay hold of me."
[time=1332] Psalm 62 verses 6 to 8 says this, "He only is my rock and my salvation. My stronghold I shall not be shaken."
[time=1347] That passage goes on to say in verses 7 and 8, "On God my salvation and my glory rest, the rock of my strength, my refuge is in God."
[time=1356] Trust in him at all times, O people. Pour out your heart before him. God is a refuge for us.
[time=1363] Over 50 times, 50, over 50 times the psalmist states that he turns to take refuge in his God.
[time=1374] And in the Hebrew, which is what the Old Testament comes from, in the Hebrew, that word refuge means literally to hide within, to be wrapped around and hidden within.
[time=1385] In the Greek, the words means to laid hold of hope. And to those of us that know him, to those of us that know him, James reminds us in James chapter 4 verses 7 and 8.
[time=1399] Submit therefore to God, resist the devil, and he will flee from you, draw near to God, and he will draw near to you.
[time=1408] He will cleanse your hands, use sinners, and purify your hearts. You double-minded.
[time=1415] Back to Psalm 139. And Rick, I want you to start making your way back from where you are back down here to Caleb.
[time=1421] I want to take you back to Psalm 139, just in your minds, okay? Think about this.
[time=1426] I mean, literally envision this. Give this some thought, chew on this. Psalm 139, 7.
[time=1434] It says back there, and we just looked at it. It says in Psalm 139, 7, it says this, "Where can I go from thy spirit?
[time=1444] Where can you go from his spirit? Where can I flee from thy presence?"
[time=1454] People this morning, please be reminded of this. And be reminded of this pictorially and internally and literally.
[time=1463] Wherever you go, his interest in you is that great. He isn't too busy. He isn't too spread thin.
[time=1471] You just sit right there next to him. His interest in you, his love for you, his commitment to you is that great.
[time=1478] Wherever you go, wherever you walk, wherever you live, wherever your path takes you.
[time=1485] God's Word reminds us this morning that he is near, not too busy and not spread too thin.
[time=1492] One of the words, one of the first things I can remember as a boy in Sunday school is learning these really big omni words.
[time=1500] Remember those? He is omni-potent. He is om-nip-es-nop-nip-es-nop-niscient.
[time=1509] And he is, with regard to this that we're talking about here, he is omni-what? He is omni-present.
[time=1516] They taught us that. And I remember that. Omnipresent.
[time=1519] And as a kid, you know, it's hard to fathom that he was omni-present to the boy in China and omni-present to the boy in the states.
[time=1525] But he is because he's God and he's near. He is all the above.
[time=1529] You know what he is? He's not that.
[time=1532] He's not Caleb sitting down here in a step and rick up in a distant loft looking elsewhere. Stand up, Rick.
[time=1540] Stand up behind Caleb. Stand up there next to your dad. There you go, buddy. Put him right between your legs, Rick.
[time=1545] Stand him up there and just put your arms around him. There you go. That's our God.
[time=1550] He is near. He is present. And no matter where you go, Caleb, right, no matter where you go, you know your dad's there with you, right?
[time=1558] When you hide and seek, he always finds you, right? Absolutely.
[time=1562] Thanks, you guys. Very much. Give Caleb a big hand.
[time=1565] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1571] This morning, we would suggest that not only is he near. You guys, buddy, he cares. He cares a great deal.
[time=1580] Not only is he near, but he cares. First Peter. First Peter 5'7.
[time=1585] First Peter 5'7 says this, casting all your anxiety upon him because he cares for you.
[time=1594] God's word calls us to cast, to give over every anxiety, every question, every concern, every difficulty,
[time=1603] every circumstance that you have not yet, nor will you ever figure out all the stuff of life that you and I face.
[time=1609] God says in his word there, through Peter's pen, cast it on me because you know what? Not only am I near, but I care.
[time=1617] I care deeply. I care about you. You're valuable to me. You mean a lot to me.
[time=1624] He cares sometimes again in the parent-child, parent-child relationship.
[time=1633] And again, we use it this morning as an analogy, as an illustration, but sometimes, even from a young age,
[time=1641] this view of God caring for me can get skewed.
[time=1646] And I am as guilty of this as any father in this room, and I continue to this day to try and repent from the sin
[time=1655] that you're about to see and move back toward healthy relationship with kids.
[time=1659] It's a constant struggle and battle in my life.
[time=1662] Eric, where are you? Eric, I think Eric and Abby are going to help me out here.
[time=1667] And I want to paint a picture that sadly sometimes happens.
[time=1671] Hi, Abby. Why don't you just sit right there, just right there, plop it right there, babe. Good job.
[time=1676] And Eric, why don't you go stand over there at that end?
[time=1680] Sometimes we just get going, right? And boy, these feel good.
[time=1688] You know the British opens on right now? I mean, not that I care or anything.
[time=1695] Who needs porta pit? Right. Okay, throw those on there, Eric.
[time=1699] Now, again, this is not in any way to be a real-life picture of Eric Hall, because Eric Hall would never be ever, ever, ever this kind of death.
[time=1706] Oh, throw that strap over there, buddy. This is just a picture.
[time=1710] All right, you got your cell phone? I'm ready.
[time=1713] You got your briefcase, you got your sticks, and you got your daughter.
[time=1718] Okay, and I want you to face that way.
[time=1722] And you just kind of have this little sad, dejected looking.
[time=1725] There you go. Good job. There you go.
[time=1730] Sometimes our view, sometimes our view growing up, in one way, shape or form, is this.
[time=1741] And it's not to say there's not room for golf, because there is.
[time=1748] It's not to say that there's no room for business, and making a living, and working really hard, because there is.
[time=1756] And it's not to say that sometimes you got to, in working hard, and trying to provide, communicate with people, you know, between the hours.
[time=1763] I mean, I understand that. I really do.
[time=1765] We're talking about a heart here. We're talking about an overall picture.
[time=1769] We're talking about a pattern of living. We're talking about choices that get made.
[time=1773] And sometimes, in the midst of life, is we go about with kids and families.
[time=1777] Sometimes this is the picture.
[time=1781] As parents, we have at times offered a conflicting picture.
[time=1784] Go back to Psalm chapter, Psalm 8.
[time=1788] Back in your Old Testament there, back before you get to Proverbs, just after Job.
[time=1796] I'm going to read this to you.
[time=1799] Keep looking the other way, Eric. You're caring too much.
[time=1804] There you go. And if those get heavy, feel free to just hang on to them.
[time=1810] Look at Psalm 8. Are you there?
[time=1813] It says in Psalm 8 verses 3 to 5.
[time=1817] And I'm going to read this to you as it reads.
[time=1819] And then I'm going to kind of give you the modern Kelly translation that just kind of came to me this week as I was looking at this.
[time=1826] The word says, and it's clear. We don't need my translation, but I'm just going to kind of draw some things out.
[time=1831] The word says here in verse 3, "When I consider thy heavens," you see it?
[time=1835] "When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained, what is man that thou dost take thought of him, and the son of man that thou dost care for him?
[time=1847] Yet thou hast made him a little lower than God and dost crown him with glory and majesty." And you know what I saw in my mind's eye this week as I looked at this.
[time=1857] I kind of just reset it to myself, trying to think about kids.
[time=1861] I was trying to think about my sons and trying to think about my daughters and trying to think about your sons and your daughters, trying to think about your nieces and your nephews, trying to think about any kid that we might come in contact with, who begins to formulate a view of God based on our approach to life.
[time=1880] And I thought, you know what? It kind of goes like this.
[time=1882] Back to verse 3, "Dad, when I consider the job and the schedule
[time=1891] and all that you're responsible for in your life, I am your son.
[time=1899] I am your son, and that amazes me that you make time for me.
[time=1906] Your son that you care for me deeply into verse 4, I am your son, I am your daughter, and thou dost care for me deeply."
[time=1918] Verse 5, "Thou hast made him, Dad, you have made me a little lower than God and Mom, and you have crowned me with encouragement and affection."
[time=1931] I would love for that to be the case in the hearts and minds of your kids in mind, and the kids in this family, that they would look to parents and say, "Oh God, oh Dad, look what you've made me to feel like with all that you do
[time=1945] and all that you're responsible for, you've made me feel like a son who's just a little lower than God and Mom.
[time=1953] You have crowned me with glory and majesty." Anyone here today need to be reminded of how much he cares?
[time=1962] Eric, why don't you come over here to the middle.
[time=1964] Just drop your bag and drop your sticks and your phone right there and why don't you just sit with Abby?
[time=1970] Why don't you scoot over here next to your daddy?
[time=1972] Keep those things around, but just sit there next to him.
[time=1975] Come on, Abby, scoot over there, let him put his arm around you.
[time=1979] Want to be reminded today?
[time=1981] I do. I need to be often.
[time=1985] Look at Isaiah 43, if you do.
[time=1987] Be reminded this morning, people, of how much he cares.
[time=1992] Be reminded of his commitment to you, since his heart and his affection
[time=1998] and his deep commitment to you in your life, Isaiah 43.
[time=2002] We'll pick it up in verse one, it says this, "But now, thus says the Lord, your creator, O Jacob, and he who formed you, O Israel, do not fear, for I have redeemed you," he says.
[time=2014] "I have redeemed you. I have called you by name." Kevin's saying that for us this morning as we opened up.
[time=2020] He knows your name.
[time=2023] He says, "I have called you by name. You are mine, the God of the universe says to you this morning, you are mine." It goes on and says, "When you pass, watch this.
[time=2032] When you pass through the waters, I will be with you." And through the rivers, they will not overflow you.
[time=2038] When you walk through the fire, you will not be scorched, nor will the flame burn you.
[time=2043] In verse three, it goes on to say, "For I am the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior.
[time=2050] I have given Egypt as your ransom.
[time=2053] Cush and Siva in your place." Since you are, what's that say?
[time=2059] Say it again.
[time=2061] Since you, whoever you are, wherever you've been,
[time=2067] wherever your road has led, he says to you like a father should.
[time=2072] He says to you, "You are precious.
[time=2078] You are precious in my sight.
[time=2080] Since you are honored and I love you, I will give other men in your place and other peoples in exchange for your life." And then it says in verse five, "Do not fear for I am with you.
[time=2090] I will bring your offspring from the east and gather you from the west.
[time=2094] Do not fear," he says, "for I am with you." He cares.
[time=2098] How much does he care?
[time=2100] We could go on and on and on and on through the pages of this book, folks, reminding us in many different ways today how much he cares.
[time=2108] But I think a lot of you in the room know.
[time=2111] And some of you in the room this morning are still trying to figure this out, and we're so glad you are here trying to figure this out.
[time=2117] There's a lot in the room this morning who understand that there is one thing
[time=2123] that God did to show ultimately that not only is he near, but he cares.
[time=2131] It says in Romans chapter five, if you've got your Bibles, you can turn there quickly.
[time=2135] If not, just listen.
[time=2137] It says in Romans chapter five, verse eight.
[time=2141] Actually, I'll go back up to verse six for a while.
[time=2145] We were still helpless.
[time=2147] At the right time Christ died for the ungodly.
[time=2150] For one will hardly die for a righteous man, though perhaps for the good man someone would dare even to die.
[time=2156] But God, here you go, demonstrates his own love toward us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
[time=2166] And there you got Eric and Abby sitting down there.
[time=2169] Eric's got a lot going on in his life.
[time=2172] Eric's got golf games to get to.
[time=2174] Eric's got ministry to give himself to.
[time=2176] Eric's got a job that he needs to give 40, 50, sometimes 60 hours to a week.
[time=2180] Eric has all kinds of people that need his involvement.
[time=2185] And you know what, so does God.
[time=2187] God has a lot going on.
[time=2188] God has a lot of things to take care of, a lot of places to go, a lot of people to see, but not once in relationship with him.
[time=2196] Do we ever sense or ever realize or ever come even close to the realization that he doesn't care because he does?
[time=2204] And Eric, as he sits there with his daughter as a picture, with all of life here on his side, he makes efforts to indicate and show and communicate his care.
[time=2216] Thanks you guys.
[time=2220] You know what, not only is he near, and this is where it gets exciting.
[time=2225] Not only is he near, not only does he care, but the Word of God says, and it's, I think, just for all of us to be reminded of this morning, that someday, and you don't know, and I don't know when that day will be, it could be for some in this room today.
[time=2246] It could be tomorrow, it could be next week, it could be next month, it could be 20 years from now, but the Bible says that there will come a day when you will meet him, when you and I will come face to face with him.
[time=2261] He is near, that is true.
[time=2264] He cares, that is true, and one day, every one of us in this room, kids, all you kids in here this morning, it's so good to see you.
[time=2274] We love having you with us.
[time=2276] You've got to know, and you've got to begin to understand and wrestle with the fact that there will be a day when you will come face to face with Jesus.
[time=2287] Students and adults, moms and dads, grandmas and grandpas, there will be a day.
[time=2294] And in that day, it says in Hebrews 9, Hebrews 9, 27, and as much as it is appointed for men to die, how many times?
[time=2307] How many times?
[time=2310] No reincarnation, no cows, no trees, no plants, no nothing.
[time=2316] And as much as it is appointed for man, you and me to die once.
[time=2324] Then comes after this, what?
[time=2328] Judgment.
[time=2329] That's a big, kind of heavy, kind of scary, kind of threatening word.
[time=2335] And you know what?
[time=2337] It is.
[time=2338] It's a big word.
[time=2340] It's a big word, and there comes with that word so much for you and me to consider.
[time=2347] It is appointed for man to die once, God's word said, and then comes your answering and my answering for what we did with Jesus.
[time=2357] What was the choice that we made?
[time=2359] How did we respond to the truth?
[time=2361] And that will be the question.
[time=2364] The question will be, and I don't know exactly how it will get said, and I don't know how it'll sound, and I don't know if trumpets will accompany it, or if it'll be just a personal sit-down with you and God, but the question will be asked.
[time=2378] What did you do with the sacrificial death of my son
[time=2384] made on your behalf that you could have life and relationship with me?
[time=2390] And he's God, and he's omniscient.
[time=2392] He'll know the answer, but I believe he'll ask it.
[time=2396] One day you'll meet him.
[time=2399] Go with me back to Matthew.
[time=2402] Go with me back to the book of Matthew.
[time=2404] First book in the New Testament, we're going to wrap it up with this.
[time=2411] Matthew, chapter 7.
[time=2414] You kids just look on.
[time=2416] Either on the screens or on with your mom and dad or a friend.
[time=2420] You've got to remember what this says.
[time=2422] You've got to take this to heart, you guys.
[time=2424] Matthew, chapter 7.
[time=2427] One day we're going to meet him face to face, and there's going to be some questions asked, and there's going to be some judgments made.
[time=2436] And there is a lot.
[time=2438] Hear me now. There is a lot at stake.
[time=2441] Look what it says.
[time=2443] Matthew 7, verse 21 is I think where we'll pick it up.
[time=2448] It says not everyone, not everyone who says to me, "Lord, Lord, we'll enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven." Many will say, it says in verse 22.
[time=2463] Many will say to me on that day, "Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name?" And in your name cast out demons, and in your name perform many miracles.
[time=2474] Stop right there and look up here.
[time=2477] I envision, I envision a, it's a, it's a sad scene.
[time=2485] You know what?
[time=2486] It's a terrifying scene.
[time=2488] It is an absolutely tragic scene.
[time=2492] I mean, it's God and His justice, and He has to be just or He wouldn't be God.
[time=2498] It's God and His justice at this point, because the truth got proclaimed, and people like you and me had a chance to respond.
[time=2507] And God was really specific with what He wanted our response to be, and the sad tragic scene is this.
[time=2513] I think there will be students.
[time=2517] I think there will be students who will stand there and say, "Wait a second. Time out." I got up every stinking Sunday morning and went to church.
[time=2526] I didn't lay in bed. I got up. I came.
[time=2529] I went. I did my thing, man. What's going on?
[time=2535] I think there's going to be businessmen and business women who are going to say, "Whoa, big guy.
[time=2541] Wait a second.
[time=2543] Do you realize?" I mean, let me help you out.
[time=2546] Do you realize how much I gave to that place?
[time=2552] And I think there will be everyday normal folks like you and me who will end up in that day at that seat.
[time=2563] And they will be saying, "You know what?
[time=2565] I was so involved.
[time=2568] I did so many things.
[time=2570] I served on so many ministry teams.
[time=2573] I was a part of so many trips.
[time=2576] I was involved in this ministry and I did that ministry and I was the first to sign up every time.
[time=2582] What are you talking about when you say verse 23?
[time=2592] And then I will declare to them, "I never knew you."
[time=2599] And here's the big three words, "Depart from me.
[time=2604] You who practice rawlessness."
[time=2610] Two words you've got to connect.
[time=2611] Verse 21, "He who does," that's a present participle there.
[time=2615] That's talking about activity that is ongoing.
[time=2618] Not perfect, but the activity, the ongoing activity of the one who knows him.
[time=2624] The ongoing activity is that he does the will of my father.
[time=2627] Verse 23, "You who practice," same idea, the ongoing activity, the pattern of living, lawlessness.
[time=2638] So you've got to ask yourself the question.
[time=2640] I hope you're willing this morning to ask yourself the question.
[time=2645] Not how many times you've gotten up and come to this place.
[time=2648] Not how much you've given to this place.
[time=2650] Not how many things you've been involved in, but it seems as if this God who is near and this God who cares deeply, so much so that he gave his son, wants to know one thing from you this morning.
[time=2663] Do you know him?
[time=2667] And have you taken the step, the act of faith, to enter into, to draw that line in the sand and put that stake in the ground and say, "You know what I believe, I believe the gospel.
[time=2678] I believe in what Christ did, and I want to give my life, my eight-year-old life, my 12-year-old life, my 30-year-old life, my 60-year-old life.
[time=2688] I want to give it to Jesus and live for him."
[time=2694] Let me close with Hosea 6.6.
[time=2698] What a great reminder.
[time=2700] Do you see that?
[time=2704] I want you to read it with me, okay?
[time=2706] I want you just to read it out loud, and as you read it out loud this morning, I want it to be a reminder to you.
[time=2712] I want it to remind you of how he really feels.
[time=2715] I want it to remind you of what's really important.
[time=2718] I want it to remind you of what is at the basis, what is at the foundation of this issue, of salvation.
[time=2727] Read it with me.
[time=2728] Would you, here we go, for I delight in loyalty rather than sacrifice and in the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.
[time=2739] That's his heart.
[time=2742] That's how he feels.
[time=2743] He wants to delight.
[time=2746] Not in all that you do and not in all that you perform.
[time=2750] He wants to delight in the fact that you know him.
[time=2755] And so this morning, let me just ask if you would to just, maybe bow your head just for a moment.
[time=2761] We're going to worship here in just a few minutes.
[time=2763] But I just want to say this to you, with your heads bowed and your eyes closed, I just want you to know that there is a family full of people here at this place.
[time=2772] Many of us will be down here in the front this morning.
[time=2775] We're here all week long.
[time=2777] You can contact us by phone.
[time=2779] You can come by and stick your head in.
[time=2781] You can get on the website.
[time=2783] I mean, you can ask whatever questions you might want to ask.
[time=2786] And there are people in this place who want to talk to you.
[time=2789] Who want to be of help.
[time=2791] Who want to encourage you as you keep moving down this path that God has you on.
[time=2796] And so this morning, I just want to tell you that if there's anything we can do, if there's any questions, we can help answer.
[time=2804] We would love to do that.
[time=2805] Some of you may have come with some friends.
[time=2807] They would love to answer, talk about and discuss anything that might be on your heart this morning.
[time=2812] But please know this as you go.
[time=2815] Know this today as you walk out this door that God has been really, really clear with you.
[time=2824] He has gone to great lengths even this morning to make sure that you have heard the truth.
[time=2832] And so our hope is that you would be willing, that you would be humble, that you would be maybe even ready in your heart to respond.
[time=2839] Give us the chance to talk through these things.
[time=2841] Give us a chance to answer any questions that you might have.
[time=2844] This morning or even as the wheat progresses, we'd love to be involved.
[time=2849] Father, we thank you this morning.
[time=2852] We thank you this morning for the chance to consider the fact that your word teaches that you are near, you do care, and yes, we will come face to face.
[time=2862] And we pray, God, that those of all ages this morning have been willing to hear that simple and basic truth
[time=2872] and to understand what it means to really know you.
[time=2876] And then having come to know you, God, to benefit then, to be able to receive the blessing of what it means
[time=2884] to walk through life, this life, this sometimes hard and confusing and painful life,
[time=2891] knowing that you're near and now knowing personally firsthand that you care.
[time=2898] God, we thank you.
[time=2899] We thank you for your truth and we thank you for your word.
[time=2903] And now, God, we turn our hearts and we turn our minds and we turn our entire beings to you.
[time=2909] And in these next few minutes, we pray, God, that you would remind us and show us what you told that woman at the well,
[time=2918] that there is a water that truly quenches.
[time=2923] There is a water that comes that truly meets needs.
[time=2927] God, we pray that you would send your reign and lavish it upon us in your son's name we pray.
[time=2933] [AMEN]
[time=2957] For the majesty and power of this kingdom's being has come.
[time=2967] And this kingdom's reign and this kingdom through.
[time=2972] And this kingdom's power and authority.
[time=2978] Jesus, that's righteousness we need.
[time=2990] Jesus, the expression of God's love.
[time=3000] The grace of God, the word of God we build to us.
[time=3011] Jesus, that's all it is to explain.
[time=3021] God, the word of God, the way we find is we come from.
[time=3031] And this kingdom will come from here.
[time=3036] And this glory shall go to God for the majesty and power of this kingdom's being has come.
[time=3050] And this kingdom's reign and this kingdom through.
[time=3056] And this kingdom's power and authority.
[time=3062] Jesus, that's right to stand.
[time=3070] And this kingdom will come from here.
[time=3078] And this glory shall go to God for the majesty and power of this kingdom's being has come.
[time=3093] And this kingdom's reign and this kingdom through.
[time=3099] And this kingdom's power and authority.
[time=3105] Jesus, that's righteousness we need.
[time=3136] Wow, that is just awesome.
[time=3139] Got it, good.
[time=3141] Alright, we're going to teach you a new song.
[time=3144] Some of you may know it if you know it sing with us.
[time=3148] To celebrate this song.
[time=3150] That was right out of the body of Revelation 19.
[time=3153] We want to get through us for you.
[time=3155] Then you can join it when you're ready.
[time=3159] For the Lord of God is all I need.
[time=3209] The Lord raises me to the king of kings.
[time=3214] And the Lord of God is all I need.
