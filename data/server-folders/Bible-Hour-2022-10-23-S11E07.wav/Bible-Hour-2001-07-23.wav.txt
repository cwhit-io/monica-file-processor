[time=25] Hi, I'm Kelly, pastor here at Blackhawk, and I wanted to take just a minute if I could
[time=36] to tell you about something that's upcoming here at Blackhawk in the next few weeks, beginning the last week of July and extending all the way through the month of August.
[time=46] We are entering into a six-week series about the topic of worship.
[time=51] We've entitled it fully surrendered, completely in awe, and we can't wait to look and see what God's Word says about living lives of worship.
[time=61] Worship too many times, I think, is kind of just allocated to the 60 minutes or so we spend
[time=68] on Sunday mornings or Wednesday nights.
[time=70] That's kind of what we think worship is.
[time=72] And you know, God's Word says it's so much more.
[time=75] And we're going to look at what it means to live fully surrendered lives, to have a fully surrendered home, going to talk to moms and dads and kids, going to talk about fully surrendered
[time=85] churches and the way they carry themselves and the way they serve and the way they give.
[time=89] It's going to be a great six-week look at this whole idea of living lives fully surrendered
[time=95] and completely in awe of God, lives of worship.
[time=99] We'd love for you to join us.
[time=101] Come visit us and study and learn and look into that with us.
[time=105] And if you can't at least tune in, it should be a great six weeks.
[time=116] [MUSIC - 240 seconds]
[time=366] The heart of worship is and always has been blessing Him, coming to intimacy with Him, giving to Him.
[time=376] He is the center of worship.
[time=379] And how dare we ever make us the center of worship.
[time=383] Worship isn't to please me, it's to please Jesus.
[time=388] Worship is for Jesus, it's to Jesus, and it's about Jesus.
[time=395] [MUSIC]
[time=403] Raise them in the morning, for tall and lofty trees.
[time=411] Raise them in the evening, for children on their knees.
[time=418] Oh, and praise them in the new day.
[time=423] For gentle birds that sing, oh, oh, praise Him all ye people.
[time=430] Praise the King.
[time=435] And praise them for the peace for which we rock and tear this way.
[time=443] And praise them for the rolling hill, for children that we pray.
[time=450] Oh, and praise them for the one who sings.
[time=455] They never lost their will.
[time=458] Oh, oh, praise them all ye people.
[time=462] Praise the King.
[time=474] Let it ring.
[time=478] Raise the King.
[time=490] Let it ring.
[time=494] Raise the King.
[time=499] And praise them for the blood that it back.
[time=503] And build a road that day.
[time=507] And praise them that He suffered.
[time=510] The guilt, the grief, the shame.
[time=514] Oh, and praise Him that is tender love.
[time=519] Don't forgive today.
[time=522] Oh, oh, praise Him all ye people.
[time=526] Raise the King.
[time=537] Let it ring.
[time=541] Raise the King.
[time=553] Let it ring.
[time=557] Raise the King.
[time=569] Let it ring.
[time=573] Raise the King.
[time=585] Let it ring.
[time=589] Raise the King.
[time=601] Let it ring.
[time=607] Raise the King.
[time=610] Well, good morning.
[time=616] So good to see you.
[time=617] So great to be together.
[time=618] And thank you so much for being a part of a great, great time like that.
[time=622] And we've been looking forward to these next five weeks.
[time=626] We have been praying and we have been planning and we have been thinking and doing our very best with God's help too.
[time=632] Try and come to you over these next five weeks with a series that might bring some insight.
[time=637] With a time of study that might bring a new look with some times together that might really encourage your hearts and renew and restore your souls and give you some insight.
[time=648] And to what it means to really be a people that understand and are committed to this thing called worship.
[time=654] There's some quotes that you've seen flying around on the brochure that got sent home earlier this morning you saw them.
[time=660] Let's take a look at those again.
[time=663] Worship.
[time=665] E.W. Tozer said this about worship.
[time=667] He said worship is the continuous and unembarrassed interchange of love and thought between God and the souls of redeeming men and women.
[time=677] After Tozer you see another quote there by Robert Weber.
[time=681] Robert Weber said worship is doctrine and truth in humble and reverent motion.
[time=687] And then in the vernacular of our own day Micah age 10 says this.
[time=692] He says worship is when you live on Thursday.
[time=695] The songs you sing on Sunday.
[time=698] And Micah hit it right on the head.
[time=702] Micah said it well.
[time=704] This morning we begin what will be a five-week look at this very, very close to the heart of God issue known as worship.
[time=713] Why do we say it's a close to the heart of God issue?
[time=716] Well look with me if you would at John chapter four.
[time=720] Why do we say that worship is close to the heart of God?
[time=723] Turn to the Gospel of John.
[time=725] Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, third book in there in the New Testament.
[time=729] Look at John chapter four.
[time=731] We're going to pick it up in verse 23.
[time=734] What's going on here in this passage is a great conversation between our Lord Himself and the woman at the well and they're discussing this topic of worship.
[time=742] And she's asking him about the age-old debate between Mount Gerasim and Jerusalem and her folks.
[time=748] The Samaritans say that you worship here and Jesus, you know, his folks said they worshiped over here and he begins to bring some clarity for this lady.
[time=757] He says in verse 23, listen closely, "But an hour is coming, and now is," he says to her, "when the true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth."
[time=770] Here it is.
[time=771] For such people, for such people the Father seeks to be as worshipers.
[time=782] Do you see that?
[time=784] You sense what he's saying there?
[time=786] Does that kind of come clear to you a little bit?
[time=788] When you begin to ask about what's close to the heart of God, when you begin to read and look through that very verse, it says there that God the Father seeks out people.
[time=798] It means there that he's looking for.
[time=800] He wants to find.
[time=802] He longs to find those who would worship him and worship him well.
[time=808] I want to be, for one, I'll raise my hand and I'll just say to you this morning, I want to be found.
[time=814] I want to be found by him given over in my heart and in my life to that which is close to the heart of God.
[time=821] It reminds me of hide and go seek in our house these days.
[time=827] We played a lot.
[time=828] Maybe you still played in your house as well.
[time=830] We play hide and go seek a lot and in our house it's great because my three-year-old, and still before pretty soon, but when we play hide and go seek, it's just hilarious.
[time=837] It's really kind of sweet too because the older two, off they go and they understand hide and go seek.
[time=844] They understand the gist of it and they know what it's about.
[time=847] The older two run off and they are finding the best hiding places they can find because they do not want to be what?
[time=854] Found.
[time=856] There's her.
[time=858] And she'll go and I'll count to, when I could count to 60, it wouldn't matter. It doesn't matter if I count to five or ninety.
[time=865] When I say ready or not, here I come. She'll be at the most five feet from me standing next to a wall going like this.
[time=872] Because she wants to be what?
[time=880] Found.
[time=881] Because she knows what will happen when she gets found. And that's the other thing that's cool about it is when they get found, the older two, when they get found, they're what?
[time=891] They're bugged, they're bothered. They want to run further away and say no, no, no, no, count again when she gets found.
[time=898] You know what she does, right? She knows that when she gets found, she's going to get picked up, she's going to get tickled, she's going to get loved on.
[time=906] She's going to get picked up, she's going to get tickled, she's going to get loved on.
[time=913] And so she wants to be found.
[time=917] And I want that for you.
[time=923] I want that for this place.
[time=925] I want us to be a people who are found by him.
[time=928] To be a family in a church deeply given. To rich, genuine, sincere, in spirit and in truth, worship.
[time=940] So what's it look like?
[time=942] Let's jump in.
[time=943] What do you say?
[time=944] What is it?
[time=945] What is worship?
[time=946] What does worship really look like?
[time=949] People, what's the big picture?
[time=951] How should we define it?
[time=952] Well, a lot has been written and much has been said about worship and its true meaning.
[time=957] And if it's okay, let me just share with you several kind of general ideas and thoughts that might bring some perspective and clarity for us.
[time=963] And then we're going to wrap up this first part of our talk this morning with a very simple definition that will then take with us through the next five weeks, okay?
[time=971] Number one, what is worship?
[time=973] What is it?
[time=975] What is worship?
[time=977] Some have said it like this and I agree, worship is a way of life.
[time=983] Worship is a way of life that reflects and gives back to God the glory only he deserves.
[time=991] I hope you got that down.
[time=993] Worship is a way of life that reflects and gives back to God the glory only he deserves.
[time=1000] Now I want to say a few things about that.
[time=1002] Number one, go back to the beginning of that.
[time=1004] Worship is a way of life.
[time=1005] Are you with me?
[time=1006] I'll understand this right now.
[time=1007] Please, if there's any misconceptions about this, let's clear it up.
[time=1011] Worship people is a way of life.
[time=1013] Worship is not singing a song.
[time=1015] Worship is not a 70 minute service on Wednesday nights or Sunday mornings.
[time=1020] No, worship is a way of life.
[time=1023] Look with me at Romans 12 just quickly.
[time=1026] Go back in your New Testament to Romans 12.
[time=1029] First couple of verses there.
[time=1032] Just after Acts, just before you get to 1 Corinthians, if you don't have a Bible, no problem.
[time=1036] Just look on with someone, maybe next to you.
[time=1038] They'd be willing to share.
[time=1040] Romans 12, understand today.
[time=1043] For some of you, maybe this understanding comes for the very first time.
[time=1047] Worship is not just a service on Sunday morning.
[time=1051] It is a way of life.
[time=1053] It says in Romans 12 1, Paul writing here to the church at Rome, he says, "I urge you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies, and everything your bodies do, and everywhere your bodies go, and all that they're engaged in, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship."
[time=1081] You and I presenting our bodies.
[time=1083] You and I living our lives everywhere we go, everything we do.
[time=1089] Worship is a way of life.
[time=1092] Second part of what we just said earlier.
[time=1095] That reflects and gives back to God the glory only he deserves.
[time=1102] Write this down.
[time=1103] Worship is like walking through life with a mirror.
[time=1106] Let me show you what I mean here.
[time=1108] Worship is like walking through life with a mirror.
[time=1112] See this?
[time=1115] It's a mirror.
[time=1117] And if I could just kind of illustrate it for you, it'd be like this.
[time=1122] A lot of times, I mean all of you, and I can speak for myself and I know that you identify with this because we've all been called to pretty much, you know, some of the same stuff.
[time=1131] I've been called, many of you have been called, to lovingly lead and care for a family.
[time=1137] I've also been called to pursue and give time and attention and energy to my relationship with my God, to study his Word and to know his truth and to try my best to help others live that out.
[time=1149] I've also in my life in the arena that God's given me.
[time=1153] And for many of you, it's the same thing.
[time=1155] I've been called to exercise my gifts, to make a contribution to the body of Christ in a way that only I can because of the unique gifts He's given me.
[time=1164] And He's called all of you by and large the same things He's called me to.
[time=1168] And we go really south and this whole thing goes haywire.
[time=1173] Me and you, and worship, isn't accomplished when we walk through life going to love my family, going to do what I do, and the mirrors like this.
[time=1184] And as I go and make my sacrifice and as I go and have my Bible study with my kids and my wife, when I go and say no to this and so I can say yes to that and when in my heart though it's about me, I'm doing this.
[time=1197] Aren't I a good dad? Aren't I a good father?
[time=1200] Look at what I'm doing.
[time=1202] And I come over here and I want to get into conversations sometimes and maybe you've been here where you want to have somebody ask you something because you have the answer because you've been studying truth.
[time=1215] You've been reading the books and this relationship, this pursuit of God begins to be about me.
[time=1221] It's about what I can know, it's about what I can answer, it's about what I can offer.
[time=1226] And we come over here even in the church and it's as ugly over here as it is over there and my service and my ministry.
[time=1234] It's about me, it's about how I look, it's about how I sound, it's about how effective I am and it completely misses the boat because whether it's family or him or ministry
[time=1245] our entire activity people is to be like this.
[time=1249] God here I come, I'm going to do my best with my kids and my wife and my home but please Lord realize this is just about you and anything good that goes on here or anything I get to learn or see, it's just right back at you God
[time=1264] and all of my efforts and all of my involvements, my teaching and my leadership
[time=1270] and my involvement in this ministry, no it's not about you, it's all about you.
[time=1278] Worship is walking through life with a mirror.
[time=1282] Worship is a way of life that reflects back to God, thanks Dean.
[time=1287] The glory only he deserves, another thought for you.
[time=1291] Worship is a lifestyle that lifts him up out of a heart that is deeply aware
[time=1297] of its own need and his amazing grace.
[time=1301] In other words it is a life that is in touch with reality.
[time=1307] A life of worship is in touch with reality, what do we mean?
[time=1311] By that we mean this.
[time=1314] A life of worship is in touch with what is really real about me, what is really true about me
[time=1322] and a life of worship is in touch with what is really, really true and really, really real about him.
[time=1332] Another way of saying that might be this, I like this.
[time=1335] Worship recognizes the absolute enormity of God.
[time=1340] A life of worship walks through that life recognizing in many situations and circumstances
[time=1347] the absolute enormity of God and the insignificance when it gets right down to it,
[time=1355] the insignificance of man.
[time=1358] And I'll speak for myself on this one, okay?
[time=1360] The more of life that I see, the more of life that I face, the more things that I get to and have to go through.
[time=1369] The more experiences he steers me through, the more and more I see and sense how small and how tiny I am
[time=1385] and how absolutely enormous, how big he is.
[time=1392] John Orberg said it this way, then I quote, he says, "One of the Greek words for worship
[time=1399] begins with the prefix mega, meaning large, which gets attached in our day to everything from malls to churches."
[time=1408] In worship, again, I remember that we worship a great God, the mega God, the Lord of Lords and the King of Kings.
[time=1416] In one of the classic songs of worship in the New Testament, Mary herself cries out, "My soul magnifies the Lord.
[time=1425] Worship enlarges my capacity to experience and understand a very large God."
[time=1432] In C.S. Lewis' Prince Caspian, one of the children comes along and bumps into Aslan,
[time=1439] the Christ figure of the Narnia stories after a prologue to absence from his presence.
[time=1445] "Aslan, you're bigger," she says.
[time=1450] He answers, "That's because you're older, little one.
[time=1454] It's not because you're bigger?" She asks, "No, I'm not. But every year you grow, you will find me bigger."
[time=1464] And I bet there are some, well, I bet there are some 20 and 30 and 40 and 50 and 60 and 70 and 80 year olds.
[time=1473] I mean, I bet that would be representative of this room right here this morning.
[time=1478] I bet we could find a 70 year old to raise his or her hand and say to those 30 and 40.
[time=1485] You haven't seen anything yet.
[time=1489] He just keeps getting bigger.
[time=1491] He just keeps getting more powerful.
[time=1493] He just keeps getting more and more enormous.
[time=1496] And the more enormous he gets, the smaller and insignificant we truly are.
[time=1500] And that's how it is with us and God.
[time=1502] Our realistic worship of God reminds us that we serve a very big God.
[time=1507] Somebody once said it this way, and I think this will be on the screen for you.
[time=1511] I loved it the moment I read it. It is so very true.
[time=1515] They said, "I need to worship because without it I can forget that I have a big God beside me and live instead in fear.
[time=1524] I need to worship because without it I can forget his calling and begin to live in a spirit of self-preoccupation.
[time=1530] I need to worship because without it I lose sense of wonder and gratitude and plot through life with blinders on.
[time=1537] I need to worship because my natural tendency is towards self-reliance and stubborn independence.
[time=1543] We worship God not so much because he needs it, but because we do.
[time=1549] I need to worship.
[time=1553] Right down here, sitting on that front bench just 15 minutes ago, I needed to worship.
[time=1563] I don't know about you, but the week I had some of the things that we've been facing
[time=1569] and wrestling with some of the issues that have been present in my life this morning.
[time=1574] At that bench, while Amanda and Alyssa sang that song and those pictures came up that reminded me of who he is
[time=1583] and what he's done and the kind of God he is and the kind of change and hope that he brings.
[time=1588] I needed to see those pictures and I needed to hear those words.
[time=1592] As the choir sang their song and those pictures of those little babies came up in his hand.
[time=1598] The week that I've had the things I've been going through, the stuff I've been wrestling with, I needed to be reminded of what a big God he is and how loving he is and how gentle he is.
[time=1613] And I don't know about you, but when I read that quote, it just resonated in my heart.
[time=1617] I need it to be reminded of who he is and what he's like.
[time=1625] Worship is, and here's our definition, write it down, we'll use it all five weeks.
[time=1630] We'll come back to it again and again.
[time=1632] People worship is honor and adoration directed to God.
[time=1640] It is you and I willing to honor him, to pursue him, to obey him might be a great synonym there.
[time=1647] Worship is honor, you and I willing to come underneath.
[time=1651] As Ty said earlier, it means to bow down literally to kiss in the Hebrew.
[time=1657] It is to honor, it is to come under, but it's not just that.
[time=1660] It's that while we're coming under, while we're honoring, we're adoring.
[time=1666] And we're saying yes, God, I do come under, I honor you and I will go here and I will do what you've called me to do.
[time=1673] And while I'm at it, I will adore you and I will say to you and I will think about you the things that are so very true about you.
[time=1683] And that's the heart of worship.
[time=1685] To worship is to honor and adore and to direct that honor and to direct that adoration to him, Psalm 95.
[time=1693] Psalm 95 says, "Come, let us worship and what? Bow down.
[time=1698] Come, let us worship and bow down. Let us kneel before the Lord our Maker, for He is our God, and He alone."
[time=1707] Number two.
[time=1708] Number two, who's it about?
[time=1710] We've got to make sure on this one.
[time=1712] Having said all we just said, I hope that it is clearly and plainly obvious to you all.
[time=1718] Who is worship about?
[time=1721] I hope it's clear.
[time=1724] We need to make sure though, because watch what can happen.
[time=1728] A selfless life lived out in honor and adoration to him can begin to be as we talked about with the mirror about us and it isn't.
[time=1737] People, it isn't.
[time=1739] It's not about you.
[time=1740] It's not about you or I looking spiritual or gaining approval or looking spiritually competent.
[time=1746] It's not about ministry results, it's not about growth or reputation.
[time=1750] It's not about spiritual ritual either.
[time=1756] God isn't into that.
[time=1758] It isn't close to His heart.
[time=1760] None of the above, especially ritual, go back to Isaiah in your Old Testament.
[time=1766] Just flip back there just for a moment.
[time=1769] Go to Isaiah chapter one.
[time=1776] Be reminded this morning that it is not about these things.
[time=1780] It's not about spiritual reputation.
[time=1783] It's not about spiritual competency.
[time=1785] It's not about how you sound or how you look in ministry.
[time=1788] No, it is about something very simple yet very profound.
[time=1792] And here in Isaiah one, we see clearly what it isn't about.
[time=1796] It's not about spiritual ritual.
[time=1797] It says here in verse 10, we'll pick it up there.
[time=1799] Hear the word of the Lord.
[time=1801] You rulers of Sodom, give ear to the instruction of our God, you people of Gomorrah.
[time=1807] In verse 11 he goes on and says, what are your multiplied sacrifices to me?
[time=1813] Says the Lord, I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed cattle.
[time=1819] And I take no pleasure in the blood of bulls, lambs or goats.
[time=1823] When you come to appear before me, who requires of you this trampling of my courts, bring your worthless offerings no longer.
[time=1831] Incense is an abomination to me.
[time=1834] New moon and Sabbath, the calling of assemblies.
[time=1836] I cannot endure iniquity and the solemn assembly.
[time=1841] I hate your new moon festivals and your appointed feast.
[time=1845] They have become a burden to me.
[time=1847] I am weary, he says, of bearing them.
[time=1852] Go over just a few books to Hosea.
[time=1855] Go past Jeremiah and on past Daniel and go over to Hosea.
[time=1867] What's this worship thing about people?
[time=1870] Who is it really about?
[time=1872] Look at Hosea.
[time=1874] Hosea is six.
[time=1877] Says there in Hosea.
[time=1881] Chapter six verse six and we even I think saw this last week.
[time=1885] We'll come back to it and look at it again here this morning.
[time=1887] It says therefore I delight in loyalty rather than sacrifice.
[time=1893] And in the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.
[time=1898] You see it there?
[time=1899] He wants it to be personal people.
[time=1904] He wants our hearts.
[time=1906] He wants us deeply engaged with him because it is about him.
[time=1913] That's who it's about.
[time=1914] It's about him.
[time=1916] In his book Worship the ultimate priority, John MacArthur said it this way.
[time=1920] Tragically and I quote the element of worship is largely missing.
[time=1925] Amid all the activity that goes on in the church today.
[time=1928] A number of years ago I read a newspaper account of a christening party in a wealthy Boston suburb.
[time=1933] The parents had opened their palatial home to friends and relatives who had come to celebrate the wonderful birth of this baby.
[time=1940] As the party was moving along and the people were having a wonderful time eating and drinking and celebrating and enjoying each other.
[time=1947] Somebody said by the way where's the baby?
[time=1950] The heart of that mother sank and she instantly ran from the room and rushed into the master bedroom
[time=1956] where she had left the baby asleep in the middle of the massive bed.
[time=1960] The baby was dead smothered by the coats of the guests.
[time=1967] We have many, many activities and little worship.
[time=1975] We are big on ministry and small on adoration.
[time=1979] We are disastrously pragmatic.
[time=1981] All we want to know about is what works.
[time=1983] We want formulas and gimmicks and somehow in the process we leave out that to which God has called us.
[time=1989] We often thought about it, he says, in reference to how the Lord Jesus Christ is treated in his own church.
[time=1998] It's much like that couple, their baby in that bed.
[time=2001] We are busy supposedly celebrating him while he is smothered by the coats of his people.
[time=2007] We are too many martha's and too few marries.
[time=2010] We are so deeply entrenched in the doing that we miss the being.
[time=2014] Did you get that?
[time=2016] We are so busy, we are so entrenched in the doing we miss the being.
[time=2020] We are programmed and informed and planned and busy and we slight worship.
[time=2025] We have our functions, our promotions, our objectives, our success, driven numbers, conscious, traditional and/or fattish efforts, but too often acceptable, true, spiritual worship eludes us.
[time=2039] End quote. You know there are over 400,000 churches in America.
[time=2049] Do you know that?
[time=2051] There are over 400,000 churches in America that own 120 billion dollars worth of facilities
[time=2059] dedicated to worshiping God.
[time=2061] And you got to ask yourself the question this morning and you better start with this building and these people first.
[time=2067] How much worship really goes on.
[time=2072] A distinguished explorer was making a trek in the Amazon jungle.
[time=2079] Native tribesmen were bearing his great burdens and he was driving them with great force to cover a lot of ground rapidly.
[time=2086] At the end of the third day they rested and when morning came and it was time to embark again the natives set on the ground by their bags next to their burdens.
[time=2095] The explorer did everything he could to get them up and moving but they wouldn't budge.
[time=2101] Finally the chief said to him this, my friend, they are resting until their souls catch up to their bodies.
[time=2114] They are resting, he said, until their souls catch up to their bodies.
[time=2123] I wish that were happening more and more so in the church today.
[time=2127] I wish that were happening more and more in ours.
[time=2134] Souls that were consistently, listen, souls that were consistently nourished on the truth led by the spirit and mindful of his grace.
[time=2147] Souls focused, refreshed and renewed working in unison with not having to always play catch up with busy spiritual bodies.
[time=2162] It's my opinion and I believe it firmly that our worship, that my worship, my personal worship and I would guess probably to some degree your personal worship
[time=2174] and probably to an even greater degree our corporate worship probably suffers more than it's enhanced.
[time=2184] Many, many times I would guess it suffers because our bodies are out here actively and aggressively going through the motions while our souls are back here.
[time=2195] Tired and in need of renewal and a connection again with the person of God.
[time=2203] Let me ask you this, when is your daily time?
[time=2207] I'm asking you, every one of you that knows him, every one of you that is walking through life, attempting to grow in your faith, honor God, serve him as a part of this family.
[time=2220] I'm asking every one of you, when is your personal time of worship?
[time=2227] When is it? When do you get focused? When do you get renewed? When do you get confessed and all cleaned out?
[time=2235] When are you providing opportunities for your soul to keep up with your body?
[time=2242] Is it in the morning when you get up? Before everyone else does? Is it at night when everyone's asleep? Is it at lunch?
[time=2250] In a quiet corner is it in your, when is it? When is your regular time of personal worship?
[time=2259] Let's ask one more question, where does it begin?
[time=2263] Number three, where does it begin? What's the starting point?
[time=2269] What's the starting point of worship? What has to be in place for true worship to really happen?
[time=2276] And we'll just simplify this as much as we can. Look with me back in the New Testament, first book there, Matthew, Matthew chapter 15.
[time=2286] Where does it begin? Matthew chapter 15, we'll pick it up in verse seven.
[time=2295] A very telling couple of verses here.
[time=2302] Says in Matthew chapter 15, verse seven, Jesus himself speaking here in a conversation with the Pharisees and the scribes who had come to him from Jerusalem.
[time=2315] He says here in verse seven, and he's not mensing any words, he's cutting right to the chase. He says, you hypocrites.
[time=2322] Rightly did Isaiah prophesy of you saying, verse eight, this people honors me with their lips, but they're, what's your Bible saying?
[time=2333] Their hearts, you see it there? This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far away from me, but in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines, the precepts of men.
[time=2348] There it is, people right there. I'll say it to you again. Worship begins in the heart. Worship begins in the heart. He wants to have, he longs to be in fellowship with.
[time=2360] And it's got to be there for real worship to happen. It begins in a fully, and it flows out of a fully surrendered heart.
[time=2371] Now just write that phrase down, okay, and listen to that phrase as I say it to you. And I want you to think about just you.
[time=2383] And I know some of you. I know some of what you've faced in the last two weeks. I know many of you and the things that you on a regular basis come up against and wrestle with.
[time=2396] And many of us in the room this morning are wrestling well, making good choices and trying our best to hang in there as God grows us and takes us down the road that He has us on.
[time=2406] Others of us, I know, because I know you. It's been a tough few weeks, it's been a tough couple of months, and you come face to face daily with issues, and it hasn't been going so well.
[time=2417] And God's growing you, and He's teaching you, and He's taking you through things. Some of the room this morning, you're still trying to figure out this thing called faith and how it works and what it looks like.
[time=2427] I'll tell you what, this is a part of how it goes. Right here.
[time=2432] Fully surrendered hearts.
[time=2438] Whatever your circumstance might be, I want you to hear that this morning, it begins with a fully, fully, completely, totally surrendered.
[time=2453] What comes to mind? Go ahead and just think of a few pictures. Think of a few synonyms. People, it begins with a fully and completely surrendered, given over.
[time=2470] White flag up the pole, not me but you, fully surrendered heart. That's where it begins.
[time=2480] Listen, you don't give yourself completely. You just don't. You don't give yourself completely to loving your wife or your husband or your kids coming alongside your family.
[time=2492] You don't give yourself completely to sharing your faith, serving zealously or giving recklessly. You don't completely give yourself to a life of honor and adoration with half a heart.
[time=2507] It doesn't work.
[time=2511] It just doesn't work. It doesn't happen. And just to be clear, any activity in the above stated it arenas done or attempted with half a heart won't succeed and certainly can't be called an act of worship.
[time=2523] People worship begins and flows out of a fully surrendered heart.
[time=2528] Now let's just take a few minutes and then we're going to close with a song.
[time=2532] I'm going to give you a chance to respond this morning and worship all over again, but three things that come to my mind.
[time=2538] Okay, there could be six or seven or eight, I'm sure, but we'll look at three this morning. Three things that come to my mind.
[time=2544] Okay, if you're interested in this endeavor, if you're interested in really giving some thought to a life of worship and we've come to the point this morning where at least I think I hope or an agreement that it begins with a heart that is fully surrendered to him.
[time=2559] Well, what is a fully surrendered heart? Let's just ask that question. Let's try and answer it with three things this morning that I think would give some insight to that.
[time=2569] And then we're going to come back next week and move on in our series. Three things I think that mark a fully surrendered heart.
[time=2577] The first one may just sound very basic and very obvious to many of you, but you know what? It's important that we say it and that we explain it.
[time=2585] Number one, a fully surrendered heart is a heart that is saved. Can't be fully surrendered without it, can you?
[time=2596] A fully surrendered heart given to a life of worship. Number one, first and foremost, is a heart that is saved.
[time=2603] What does it say in Romans 10? Some of you know this, some of you kids know this. Many have memorized this.
[time=2610] Over the years, Romans 10, 9 and 10, it says this, that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your what?
[time=2619] In your heart that God raised him from the dead, you shall be what? Saved.
[time=2626] That if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you shall be saved.
[time=2633] Here you go, for with the heart man believes, resulting in righteousness, right living.
[time=2641] And with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation.
[time=2646] A fully surrendered heart people is a heart that has been saved, a heart that has been changed, a heart that has been made new.
[time=2654] A fully surrendered heart is one that has come face to face, with the person and work of Jesus Christ, has embraced it, has given its life to it.
[time=2665] It's saved. You know what else it is? It's submitted.
[time=2670] Second thing, write it down, a fully surrendered heart is a heart that is submitted.
[time=2676] It is submissive in its nature. It is submissive in the way it carries itself.
[time=2683] Don't miss this. Okay, let's look to the ultimate example of all examples, the one we always go to.
[time=2691] When we want to see truth really lived out in action, turn with me to Luke 22.
[time=2697] A fully surrendered heart is saved, number two it is submitted or submissive.
[time=2704] It says in Luke 22, we're going to pick it up in verse 41.
[time=2709] This is Jesus, he's in the garden, this is the end of the road for him and he knows it.
[time=2715] He's come to the garden, he's brought his friends, he's asked them to pray and he knows it's time, he knows what's coming.
[time=2723] He realizes that the time is now and so it says there in 41 and he withdrew from them about a stone's throw and he knelt down and began to pray, saying,
[time=2733] "Father, if thou art willing, remove this cup from me."
[time=2739] There you see Jesus in all of his humanity, he was 100% man and 100% God and in his humanity.
[time=2747] Listen now, he is saying what you say and what I say, I'll admit it to you.
[time=2752] Because there are days I say it, there are days I say in a lot of different arenas and I'll just admit it, I want out.
[time=2763] There's days it gets that confusing, there's days it gets that hard, there's days it doesn't make sense.
[time=2770] And in his humanness he kneels down before God and says, "I want out, please if there's a way.
[time=2778] Don't make me go through what I know I'm going to have to go through." I want out and I don't know how long this prayer took but somewhere thereafter he comes back into his deity.
[time=2792] And with perfect perspective and with perfect trust he says yet, but no, no, no, not my will, but vine be done.
[time=2808] And I wish for me and I wish for you sometimes it were kind of just that easy, you know, you raise the flag and you go, no, no, no.
[time=2815] No, I'll come over here and I'll come under and I'll submit.
[time=2819] And that's what he did and that's what we're called to do and that's the model.
[time=2824] It's the example that he gives us, a fully surrendered heart was at work right there in Jesus in his own experience
[time=2833] as he was willing to come under the will of the Father.
[time=2837] Many times you and I know as we sit there and say, "I want out." We know what the will of the Father is, that's why we're saying we want out because sometimes the will of the Father is painful.
[time=2849] Sometimes it's confusing, sometimes it doesn't make sense.
[time=2855] But God's word calls us to submit, a fully surrendered heart is submitted to God and it is also submitted to those God has placed over us.
[time=2868] One more thing, there's something about the way that submission gets carried out that you got to write down this morning.
[time=2877] That heart is saved, that heart is submitted, and in the submissiveness that heart is soft.
[time=2884] Write it down, that heart is soft.
[time=2887] Boy, this is great. Look at Luke 23.
[time=2891] Just a little bit later in the story.
[time=2894] Look at the softness being expressed.
[time=2897] Look at the attitude that came with the submission.
[time=2901] Luke 23, pick it up and we'll go verses 33 and 34.
[time=2907] It says there, read it.
[time=2909] And when they came to the place called the skull, this is Calvary, this is Golgotha, this is where it all ends in a sense.
[time=2917] It really just begins, but this is the crucifixion.
[time=2921] There they crucified him and the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left.
[time=2928] Okay, they're crucifying him, they're torturing him up on this tree.
[time=2933] He's going through, all that he's going through up there, he's dying in physical, mental anguish and torment,
[time=2940] but Jesus was saying, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing."
[time=2948] And they cast lots dividing up his garments among themselves.
[time=2951] "Father, forgive them." They don't have a clue what they're doing, Lord forgive them.
[time=2960] In the midst of his submission, which brought great pain, his heart is soft.
[time=2966] And I don't know about you, but again, I think sometimes if that's me up there, and I've thought about it many a time,
[time=2972] and if that's me up there, me and my humanness, granted, right, and if it's you up there, I don't think those words are coming out of my mouth.
[time=2980] And I don't have to even be hanging on a cross, I could just talk to you about the events of my life in the last week.
[time=2988] And the times where submission called me to come under here and keep moving down the road, and in my heart I'm thinking,
[time=2995] God, what are you doing?
[time=2999] Where's his judgment? Where's her? What about her? What about this, you know?
[time=3004] What are you working on me so much for? Ease up.
[time=3010] No, no, no, a saved, submitted heart is in its submission soft.
[time=3018] Listen to this. In the family, at work, in the church, in the church especially, you see this all the time.
[time=3031] Listen, your soft-hearted submission, your soft-hearted submission will bring joy.
[time=3043] Your soft-hearted submission, you may not understand it, it may not always make sense.
[time=3050] God's Word teaches us that your soft-hearted submission will bring joy.
[time=3055] Kids, as you're dealing with mom and dad, people, as we deal with employer, employee stuff in the church, as you deal with leadership.
[time=3065] Flipside, you're hard-hearted. Your hard-hearted lack of submission will bring grief. Look at Hebrews 13.
[time=3077] It says in Hebrews 13, 17. Look at what we just said plays out right here. Hebrews 13, 17, it says obey your leaders, and submit to them, for they keep watch over your souls as those who will give an account.
[time=3104] Let them do this with joy. In the way that you submit to them, let them do this, let it bring joy.
[time=3112] Let them do this with joy, and not with grief, for this would be unprofitable for who. For them? No, for you.
[time=3123] Carry yourself in your heart with a sense of softness, trusting in God, not in your circumstances or the people connected to them.
[time=3134] No, no, trust in God and carry yourself with a soft heart that's submitted.
[time=3141] And don't forget where that begins. The fully surrendered thing begins with salvation. As the folks come up to close us in one last opportunity for corporate worship and praise this morning, let me just ask if you would just bow your heads.
[time=3157] Let me just get a moment here while they take their places. Let me just give you a chance to just respond to a couple of things. And one would be this.
[time=3168] Just a question for you. Where's your heart today? Where is your heart today? And what would you say the condition of it is?
[time=3177] We've been talking about the privilege of worship and how it begins with a heart that is fully surrendered, saved, submissive, and soft, and there may be, and I know there are, many in the room this morning.
[time=3193] And we're kind of, for you, we're back at that first S. We're back at saved. Still thinking through and still wrestling with the truth as you've been hearing it and trying to understand it in our invitation, our hope, our prayer, our ask of you again is what it always is, each and every week.
[time=3214] Come and let us talk with you. Keep the dialogue going with a good friend. But understand and hear again this morning the truth that life, as it was intended to be lived.
[time=3229] Life, as it was intended to be embraced, is made possible. Life free from shame and guilt because of the love of God and the sacrifice of His Son.
[time=3242] It's found in Jesus Christ and your willingness to embrace Him and what He did. Commit your life to Him. Learn what it means to follow Him.
[time=3254] And then, for the first time in your life, know what it means to worship Him, to honor and adore. So please let us help. However we can, keep that dialogue going.
[time=3268] And others of you here in the room this morning, my guess is that there are some whose worship maybe would be hindered today because of those last two S's.
[time=3279] Is your heart today submitted fully surrendered to Him and to those that He has placed in your life? And is there a softness in your spirit as you interact with and live with and bump up against Him and those that He has in your life?
[time=3301] And so that's for you to think about and to consider and to pray about and to maybe even sing to Him right now.
[time=3309] Father, we come before you as a people. So very thankful for you and all that you've done and thankful that we get the chance to live lives of worship. Teach us, God.
[time=3320] And as we leave this morning, remind us that it begins with our hearts.
[time=3325] And oh Lord, we give them to you this morning. In your son's name we pray. Amen.
[time=3355] Give me my heart. Give me my soul.
[time=3375] Lord, I give you my heart. Give me my soul. I live for you alone. Every breath that I take, every moment I'm away.
[time=3442] Lord, have your way and be.
[time=3455] Before we leave today, I just wanted to again reiterate something to you that we've said to you before.
[time=3460] Number one, you'll see on the screen in just a minute here our new website address.
[time=3465] And there are so many things going on here at Blackhawk these days that we'd love for you to be aware of.
[time=3471] Maybe even learn more about. And so if you have a few minutes this week, just take some time and go sit down and look us up.
[time=3479] We're excited about the things that are going on.
[time=3481] Also, just to tell you this again, we'd love to hear from you. If anything you heard today or if something you've been considering in the last few weeks, if you've got questions, if you've got needs, if there's any way at all we can come alongside.
[time=3495] Don't hesitate to joss a note. Give us a phone call. We'd love to help.
[time=3525] [MUSIC]
