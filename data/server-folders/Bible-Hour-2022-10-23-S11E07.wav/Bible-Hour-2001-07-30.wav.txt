[time=0] [APPLAUSE]
[time=2] [MUSIC - 118 seconds]
[time=147] We're continuing today as a church in our series on worship.
[time=154] And if you remember last week, Kelly talked about what it means to worship with a surrendered heart.
[time=161] He talked about being saved.
[time=166] And he talked about having a soft heart.
[time=170] Today, we're talking about surrendered families.
[time=176] Now, as you think about that, what does a surrendered family look like?
[time=182] What shape does that take?
[time=184] As your day unfolds, dads, what does it mean to have a surrendered heart as a dad when the day begins?
[time=193] As a brother or a sister, what does that mean as you sit down around the table to have a surrendered heart in a family?
[time=202] We're going to look at that closely this morning from some very unique angles, as I said.
[time=208] And I think we're in for a great time.
[time=212] What you've seen about us now is we join in worship time, singing about the faithfulness of our Father, our Heavenly Father.
[time=219] [MUSIC - 166 seconds]
[time=386] Well, in the Book of Luke, the ninth chapter, 23rd verses, says, "Then he said to them all, if anyone would come to me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me." I don't know what that means to you, but when I read that, it makes me really nervous, because I think about myself and my life and the things in my life that I need to be giving to him on a daily basis.
[time=408] And I think about the things that I'm not giving to him.
[time=411] The next few songs that we're going to be singing are talking about surrender, and that's really a theme of our worship today, is the issue of surrender.
[time=418] Where are you with that?
[time=420] Have you surrendered your life?
[time=421] Have you surrendered everything?
[time=423] It's a daily thing, and it's not easy to do, and it's a lot easier for me to think of the areas that I have not surrendered than it is to think of the things that I have.
[time=431] So as we sing these next few songs, I'd like you to do something.
[time=434] Instead of thinking about what you're going to do afterwards, like go out to eat, or say hi to your friends, or what I'm going to do, go home and watch tennis on TV, I want you to think about the words of these songs.
[time=446] Close your eyes as we're singing, and concentrate on the words.
[time=449] Think about what they're saying, and think about how you need to turn your life over to Christ.
[time=454] Have you even done that today?
[time=455] Have you reached a point where you've given your life fully and wholly to Jesus Christ?
[time=460] Pray that you would.
[time=461] Let's sing.
[time=490] Let's pray.
[time=492] Let them go with Jesus Christ.
[time=499] Oh, then I am.
[time=510] I need to tell me for you alone.
[time=516] Oh, are we friends?
[time=519] Oh, are you playing?
[time=522] The joy and the pain.
[time=525] Making them your own.
[time=530] Oh, light up with my life to me.
[time=535] Everything I've done through.
[time=539] Please sit for your glory.
[time=542] Oh, light up with my faith to you.
[time=547] Keep my praise to you.
[time=551] As we've been standing by heart.
[time=557] Oh, light up with your heart.
[time=566] Please in the words we can see.
[time=572] Nations and dreams that I add to the truth.
[time=578] All of my hope, all of my hands.
[time=584] My heart and my hands are connected to you.
[time=591] Oh, light up with my life to me.
[time=595] Everything I've done through.
[time=600] Please sit for your glory.
[time=603] Oh, light up with my faith to you.
[time=607] Keep my praise to you.
[time=612] As we've been standing by heart.
[time=617] Oh, light up with your heart.
[time=626] Oh, light up with my love.
[time=789] Father, we come this morning.
[time=794] We admit we don't fully surrender all the time.
[time=796] We want to keep little pieces here and there for ourselves.
[time=800] Lord, even though we know that it's best for us, and there's extreme joy and satisfaction, and we know it's pleasing in honor to you.
[time=812] So Lord, continue to work in our hearts today, even as we leave this place.
[time=818] May we live fully surrendered lives to you, not only here in this time, but as we interact as families, as brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and fathers.
[time=830] Indeed, we're grateful.
[time=833] We stand in awe at who you are.
[time=838] Help us not to lose that picture as we go about our daily lives.
[time=842] For it's in your son's name, we pray.
[time=844] [AMEN] â™ª
[time=854] Well, good morning.
[time=857] For those of you who don't know, my name's Eric Hall, and I'm not Kelly.
[time=861] Kelly's son wanted a golf tournament a couple of weeks ago, and so he's playing in another one the follow-up yesterday and today down in Georgia.
[time=872] Kelly thought since we're talking about family and having a surrendered family, and having him here to talk about it with all of you, he'd actually live that out and take this weekend to be with his family and take his son to the golf tournament.
[time=883] So he's there, and so you get to, you get me to fill in.
[time=886] And I got to tell you, I was just telling Bob, I said, "I'm a little nervous coming up here." I said, "It'd be a lot easier to talk to you and share with you from God's Word and do the panel discussion we're going to do if Kelly wasn't so good." And I feel so much pressure filling in for Kelly because he does such a great job.
[time=902] I jokingly say I have such big shoes to fill, both literally and figuratively, with Kelly doing a great job.
[time=909] If you have your Bibles with you, if you want to open them to Romans, chapter 12 briefly before we go into the panel discussion.
[time=916] Last week, Kelly started our series on worship, a surrendered heart, and started talking about what it looks like to be completely surrendered.
[time=926] And we talked about that, and this week we want to kind of take a different tact on that, and we'll get into that in just a second.
[time=932] But I wanted to start out with a little word association.
[time=935] When you think of the word worship, when I say that word, what do you think of?
[time=939] And I just wrote down in my notes a few things that come to my mind when I think of the word worship.
[time=944] When I think of worship, I think of church, I think of songs, I think of singing, I think of the band, I think of things like that.
[time=952] And those are usually the things that come into my mind when I think of worship, singing songs, church services, those kind of things.
[time=958] And last week, Kelly gave us a little bit different.
[time=961] A description of worship.
[time=964] And I want to read that to you.
[time=965] It's out of Romans chapter 12 verses 1 and 2.
[time=969] If you have your Bible as you can turn there.
[time=971] Romans 12 verses 1 and 2 says this, "Therefore I urge you, brothers, in view of God's mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God.
[time=986] This is your spiritual act of worship.
[time=988] Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.
[time=994] Then you'll be able to test and approve what God's will is.
[time=998] His good pleasing and perfect will." According to Romans chapter 12 verse 1, worship isn't just here in church, isn't just singing, isn't just the songs that we do.
[time=1009] Worship is really the life we live.
[time=1011] And Kelly teased that out for us last week and talked about worship being a lifestyle.
[time=1015] Worship being having is something that we do and we have a heart that's totally surrendered to God.
[time=1020] A heart that is doing exactly what we're just saying.
[time=1023] A heart that's completely surrendered.
[time=1025] And as I thought about that, we realized how easy that is to do here in church.
[time=1029] I mean, it's easy to come here to church and sing all these songs and worship God because everybody else is doing it.
[time=1035] And it's kind of expected on Sunday morning that we're going to come to church and worship.
[time=1039] It's a lot harder to do that everywhere else.
[time=1042] It's a lot harder to worship God and have that surrendered heart at work among people who see us every day all the time with the stresses at work.
[time=1051] But I think the hardest place and what we're talking about this morning is living that out at home.
[time=1057] I mean, if I was to pick the hardest place to live out a totally surrendered heart and to worship God by how I live, I'd say the hardest part, the hardest place to do that is at home.
[time=1067] And so this morning we thought maybe a little creative way to talk about what it means to be totally surrendered at home would be to bring some people up in different stages of life and let them talk about it and we'll ask them some questions and share and let them give you some of their responses.
[time=1082] So we had five of them that we asked to come up.
[time=1084] So if you guys want to go ahead and come up, they're kind of just sitting here.
[time=1088] And we asked them to come up and grab some seats here and I'm going to talk to them and they're going to grab the mics.
[time=1095] Hopefully.
[time=1098] Hey, Sarah.
[time=1100] I'll introduce them here in case you don't know all of them.
[time=1102] Okay, it's got a different chord.
[time=1107] Just in case you don't know everybody, I'll just introduce them.
[time=1111] On the far end down here is Brian Denny and anyone from Brian is Karen Beck and Chris Wright, Scott Schindler, who you probably see every once in a while, and Sarah Siegeland.
[time=1123] And they're going to be sharing and we wrote up some questions and I'm just going to kind of ask them a few questions and we'll let them share and then when we're all done we'll wrap it up.
[time=1132] We're going to start with Brian on the end and just talk with him.
[time=1135] And Brian, in your efforts as a dad, as a husband, tell us about the challenges you face to lead at home, to lead and all those things.
[time=1145] Tell us about the challenges you face and maybe some things that keep you encouraged in your efforts to lovingly lead in your home.
[time=1153] I'd like to just start out as to what my aim is and what I'm shooting for and what I believe God calls me to do to be as a father and a husband.
[time=1165] He calls us to be, that's meant to be leaders, to be the head of the house.
[time=1170] And so this question says how do we lovingly lead?
[time=1173] Well, you know what, you can't make anybody follow you.
[time=1177] So what I try to do is I try to be to give them someone to follow.
[time=1182] And by that I mean if I read this book and if I talk this book every day, but if I don't live that book, they have nothing to follow.
[time=1192] So you really have to do your best and I fall short every day.
[time=1197] But that's my goal to give them someone to follow, because if they don't have anybody to follow, they are not going to follow.
[time=1205] And if I'm not following this book, I'm not going to be able to lead them.
[time=1209] The second thing that I try to really hard to do is we had our old pastor used to challenge us to pursue our wives.
[time=1218] And to pursue our wives and our children means to know them.
[time=1222] You need to know their every want, their every need.
[time=1225] And I had a really cool thought this in between Wednesday and now that you know what, our Heavenly Father, he knows us perfectly.
[time=1232] He knows exactly what we need.
[time=1234] So the pursuing thing has come even more important to me this week.
[time=1238] But I'll never be able to know my wife or my kids perfectly, but that's what I need to strive to do.
[time=1244] Because then I'll really lead them even better.
[time=1246] I'll be able to lead them to know where they need to go, you know, their strengths, their weaknesses.
[time=1252] And so that's what I shoot for.
[time=1254] I have a little verse here that Ephesians 5, 25,
[time=1260] it tells me as a husband of how I'm supposed to love my wife.
[time=1263] So this is how I'm supposed to apply this to my life.
[time=1266] It says, "Husbands love your wife just as Christ of the Church and gave himself up for her, for them." You know what, he doesn't want me to die on the cross for them, I can't do that.
[time=1277] But he wants me to give my life every day to them.
[time=1281] And so I try to do it the best I can every day.
[time=1285] That's a pretty good struggle, pretty hard thing to do.
[time=1289] Because some of the things that distract me and get hard are,
[time=1295] like I was saying earlier, you know, God is not number one in my life, I don't even want them to follow me.
[time=1301] Because I'll be leading them astray and that's not what we want, that's not what I want and that's not what God wants.
[time=1308] And the other thing is, you know what, there's a lot of things in this world that want me to pursue them, a lot of distractions.
[time=1316] You know, I have, my list is a priority is God, wife, family.
[time=1321] And you can shuffle around there a little bit after that.
[time=1324] But if I shuffle and get them out of the way, then they know that, they can feel that.
[time=1329] It's, you know, I had a two-for-one golf coupon, burrino homemade pocket.
[time=1334] It was just for the driving range for two buckets of balls.
[time=1337] Well, if any of you guys go off, or any of you ladies do, two large bucket of balls takes a long time to hit.
[time=1342] You know, I took a half a day off, I called home and said, "Oh, Jill wasn't there." I said, "Well, I'll tell your mom I'm doing this." And you know what, I knew I should have been at home pursuing.
[time=1353] I knew she needed me, but it was all about me that day.
[time=1357] And so, you know, when I got my eyes off of where they should have been, I really, really kind of heard her that day.
[time=1362] And that was not a good thing.
[time=1364] So, you know, the encouraging thing is, is when you see your kids make a right choice.
[time=1369] When you know you've tried to lead them that way and you see them make a right choice.
[time=1373] Or when you hear your wife say something, you think, "Wow, that's, that's just where I wanted her to go." So, that's, that's about it and that show.
[time=1381] Brian, just in response, when you, because I know this is me, when you have those days where you've been at the office and doing your job and you come home tired, how do you, you know, how do you stay at it then?
[time=1393] What keeps you going when you feel like coming home and having another two for one all about me day?
[time=1398] How do you get over that?
[time=1400] Because I'm sure that's the majority of the dads and guys here.
[time=1403] How do you keep going and stay at it?
[time=1406] I don't know, that's a really hard one.
[time=1409] You know what, I may not be very good at that, but I do have a friend who's very good at that.
[time=1414] And I'll tell you what he does.
[time=1417] He, he told me that one time when he gets home from his day of work and he is just stressed out and, and it was really great advice and sometimes I do this and sometimes I forget.
[time=1427] But when he pulls in the driveway and he's having those days, he just takes a minute in terms of carp and just prays about it and says, "Now my day's done at work and my, and now I'm here." And so this is for them.
[time=1439] And it's been about a year or so he told me that.
[time=1441] You know, I do that sometimes, I need to do that more often.
[time=1444] And that was just a really huge piece of advice, so.
[time=1447] That's good, we all need to do that.
[time=1449] Terry, talking to you, tell us about the challenges that you think women would face today as they seek to do all that God has called them to be as a wife and a mom and what kind of challenges do you think they've come and what have you learned as you've tried to be what God has called you to be as a woman, what kind of challenges and what kind of things have you learned when it comes to your home?
[time=1471] Well, I think when Brian read that scripture from Ephesians, I think there's not a woman that doesn't want to be loved like Christ loved the church.
[time=1481] And that's where the tension starts for women because God created us, He created us for paradise to live with Him forever.
[time=1489] And we live in a very imperfect world.
[time=1492] We're imperfect, we live with imperfect husbands.
[time=1495] And yet there's just this longing to be loved like that.
[time=1500] And women are, they're wired so differently than men, and they have different relational needs, different security needs.
[time=1507] And so there's a tension from the get-go.
[time=1510] Women come into marriages with expectations and longings that are very different than their husbands.
[time=1515] And early on, we realized that that life partner that God has given us,
[time=1521] is not going to give us what we want.
[time=1524] And it's not going to happen the way we want to do it.
[time=1527] And yet God has asked us to submit to that man that God has given us
[time=1533] and follow Him and come alongside of Him.
[time=1536] And it's very difficult to do.
[time=1538] For myself, I'm just a stubborn, strong-willed person came from a large family of six kids.
[time=1544] I was the oldest and I was just used to being the boss and doing what I wanted to do and calling the shots.
[time=1550] And then God gives me this wonderful man.
[time=1554] And I don't really always want to follow.
[time=1556] And I've got it easy compared to women because He's given me a man that loves me dearly.
[time=1563] But I disciple women and work with them weekly.
[time=1567] And women are living with harsh husbands.
[time=1570] They're living with men that are unbelievers.
[time=1573] And they're in very painful marriages.
[time=1577] And the hope is that as we know God and we walk in relationship with Him, that He is always working things out for our good and for His glory.
[time=1589] So the goal for us as women is to come alongside of our husbands in a place of obedience as unto the Lord.
[time=1597] I was reading a book called Sacred Marriage this week.
[time=1600] And he posed the question, "What if God called us to holiness in our marriage and not happiness?"
[time=1608] And so as I challenge women and I think of the discipline in my own life
[time=1614] to come alongside and underneath my husband, this verse from 1 Peter has really encouraged me and prompted me over and over again.
[time=1622] God gives a wonderful hope for women that He does not give to men.
[time=1629] He tells us as women that if we would be willing to come underneath our husband and follow Him, that we have the potential of winning a husband, a disobedient husband without a word.
[time=1641] And as women we think our words, you know, one more word and we're going to get our way, one more word and we're going to get our point across.
[time=1647] But God says without a word by our chaste and reverent behavior,
[time=1653] by our gentle and our quiet spirits, we have the potential of winning a disobedient husband to the Lord.
[time=1660] And this verse in the amplified version, I love it because it gives all the Greek nuances of what it really means to come underneath our husband, but it says when they observe the pure and modest way in which you conduct yourselves, together with your reverence for your husband, that is you are to feel for Him all that reverence includes, to respect, defer to, revere Him.
[time=1687] Revere means to honor, esteem, prize and adore.
[time=1695] And in the human sense it means to admire, praise, be devoted to and deeply love and enjoy your husband.
[time=1703] And I don't know a man that wouldn't want to be treated like that.
[time=1707] So God calls us to places of obedience as unto Him.
[time=1712] And there is great joy in doing that.
[time=1717] Great, thanks Gary.
[time=1719] Chris, let's talk about you.
[time=1722] And Chris, you're kind of up here as a grown son, and we know that God's word calls us as children to honor and obey our parents.
[time=1733] And you're here kind of reflecting back on a life where maybe you've struggled at that to say the least for some of your time.
[time=1741] Tell us about that struggle as you've grown up to honor and obey your parents, and maybe there's one or two lessons you've learned in that struggle and in the process of coming around almost 180 degrees.
[time=1754] What's one or two lessons you've learned as you've kind of turned around there?
[time=1758] Well, there's not probably not a lot of you around here anymore that can remember what it was like when I was a teen.
[time=1765] And honor and obey was certainly not a couple of words that I had in my vocabulary.
[time=1771] My goal when I was that age, 15, 16, 17, was to get out from underneath authority.
[time=1780] At that point, authority was mom and dad.
[time=1783] But when you're in that stage in life, any authority is bad for you.
[time=1789] You really don't want to be under any authority.
[time=1791] You want to be your own boss.
[time=1793] You want to do your own thing.
[time=1795] And when I looked through scripture, and I was thinking of this when Kelly asked me to do this,
[time=1802] that when I find in the Bible where it tells us to honor and obey our parents, and also on the flip side, lumps people that disobey their parents into a group of people
[time=1813] that aren't real desirable.
[time=1814] Let me read for you, 2 Timothy 3, 2.
[time=1818] Says there will be terrible times in the last days.
[time=1820] People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, without love, have nothing to do with them.
[time=1830] So to be disobedient and to be dishonoring your parents, I can tell you from experience has a huge downside.
[time=1838] There's nothing good to come out of it.
[time=1840] All it gives you is strife, anger, deceit.
[time=1844] It builds and builds and builds, and there's really no way out of it without the help of God.
[time=1850] And if you look at the good side of those honor and obey things, I love Ephesians 6-1.
[time=1859] And my kids tend to live this out, and I'm very, very thankful for that.
[time=1863] Children, obey your parents and the Lord for this is right.
[time=1866] Honor your father and mother.
[time=1868] This is the first commandment with a promise that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on earth.
[time=1877] I guess my advice for young people is that as you struggle to be independent and grow up,
[time=1883] we want you to grow up as parents.
[time=1885] We want you to become independent and to live life as you would see fit to live life within God's Word.
[time=1892] But when you're underneath the authority of your mom and dad, you need to honor and obey them.
[time=1899] If you do that, it does say here that life, things will go well.
[time=1903] And it's very, very true.
[time=1905] Your parents are not perfect.
[time=1907] You are certainly not perfect.
[time=1909] And as Karen said earlier, when we have imperfect people living in an imperfect world, we have strife.
[time=1916] But if you take the word of God and do what it says to honor and obey your parents,
[time=1922] life just works out a whole lot better.
[time=1924] Chris, I was just thinking, I know we didn't ask you this and we told you you're prepared, but I was thinking of maybe some of the parents out here who are in the midst of what you were talking about
[time=1936] as you were growing up and the struggle of trying to lead God-honoring lives
[time=1942] but have children who seem to be going a different direction.
[time=1945] What would you say, not as an expert.
[time=1947] Nobody's necessarily up here as the expert and all the answers.
[time=1950] But what would you say to them as they're dealing with their difficult time right now?
[time=1956] What encouragement, what hope would you want to throw out there that you've learned?
[time=1961] Right.
[time=1963] As I watched my mom and dad go through that, one thing I can say that they did right is that they had standards, they had requirements, and they stuck to them.
[time=1973] They did not bend.
[time=1975] There were a lot of places where they did bend, and those were the places that it was appropriate to bend.
[time=1979] But when it came to how I reacted with mom and dad, how I dealt with church
[time=1985] and how I reacted to people, they had standards.
[time=1988] And basically, if I did not follow those standards, I could find someplace else to live.
[time=1993] It's a really tough thing, and I think as a dad now I would have a very, very hard time to get to that point.
[time=2001] But we were at that point many, many times within our relationship as I was growing up.
[time=2005] And my mom and dad, they told me what the rules were.
[time=2009] They stuck to those rules.
[time=2011] If I chose not to follow those rules, that meant I chose to live somewhere else.
[time=2015] And they were perfectly willing to do that, although I mean, I remember my dad several times
[time=2021] giving me that ultimatum, and I could tell it was just tearing them up.
[time=2025] Yeah.
[time=2027] I'm sure it was.
[time=2028] I can identify. I think about that. I mean, that's the same story that I was going through when I was 16, 17, 18, and my parents, and I know how hard it was.
[time=2036] Scott, talking with you.
[time=2038] Now, you're up here again as a grown son, and you find yourself in this last months or so, kind of in a different situation now.
[time=2046] You know, the God's Word still calls you as a son to honor and to a certain degree obey your parents,
[time=2052] and yet you're finding yourself moving into a different situation as your parents are getting a little older.
[time=2056] Tell us about the role you're finding yourself in and maybe what you're learning about yourself and God and your parents through all of this.
[time=2065] Well, to bring you up to speed, it's all kind of started almost a year ago, and it won't be that long, so don't be scared.
[time=2072] But last September, my mom went in for a total knee replacement, and they knew when she went in that they were not going to give her a general, but more of a local anesthetic
[time=2083] because of some possible confusion.
[time=2086] And so the surgery went well, she completed the surgery, and lo and behold afterwards, in recovery,
[time=2093] they started giving her the morphine and the dermal, all those things to dead in the pain, and she became totally confused.
[time=2099] I ended up spending several nights with her there, and my sister as well spent some time there.
[time=2106] Meanwhile, trying to work with our dad as far as interaction of the two, mom and dad,
[time=2112] we noticed something was going on everywhere, we weren't sure.
[time=2115] Well, I fast-forwarded to last Christmas, this past December.
[time=2119] Still, mom had recovered, she had come out of the confusion, and dad was doing all right, but there was still something wrong.
[time=2128] And in January, then it started to escalate.
[time=2132] And we called his doctor at Ohio State University because five years ago, when he was having some cancer surgery,
[time=2139] they found a small meningioma behind his left eye.
[time=2143] It was benign tumor, but they said to keep an eye on it, they would do an MRI every six months.
[time=2149] We found out at that time that he had not been back for three years.
[time=2153] So, did the test, found out that it had grown.
[time=2157] Make a long story short, he had surgery on January 31st of this year.
[time=2162] Well, meantime, my mom is trying to cope with this.
[time=2165] I brought her back to Fort Wayne to live at my house.
[time=2168] We're going back and forth.
[time=2169] Dad was in the hospital until March 2nd, when we brought him back here to Fort Wayne to a rehab center.
[time=2177] Mom was still living with me, we were going back and forth.
[time=2179] My sister, Brenda, is here in Fort Wayne, too, and it tends to black-rock.
[time=2182] We were back and forth together, getting mom down there, as well as taking care of dad in the rehab center here.
[time=2190] That all finally ended in May when we got them back to their home in Salino, Ohio, just about an hour away
[time=2197] from here.
[time=2199] It wasn't our ideal choice.
[time=2201] It wasn't the doctor's ideal choice.
[time=2203] But in working in situations, you're trying to help them preserve their independence, yet make sure that they are safe.
[time=2211] And so, it's a continuing process.
[time=2214] Well, we could go Friday.
[time=2217] My mom was in for an exam.
[time=2219] And finally, the doctor was able to definitely diagnose that she is in the first stages of Alzheimer's.
[time=2228] And she's doing real well at this point.
[time=2231] Because of her age, she's getting it 10 years later than most people do that it could be a slower progressing thing.
[time=2238] But we need to make some decisions in the upcoming six to 12 months.
[time=2243] And dad is progressing, but still it's going to take some time.
[time=2247] And I think the first thing I'd like to share, when this all began back in January,
[time=2253] we were called to go home and see our parents.
[time=2257] Actually, my mom had called and we weren't sure.
[time=2261] She kind of had made some innuendos about even taking her life.
[time=2265] And so we had sent one of their pastors over.
[time=2267] They're both believers.
[time=2268] And we sent one of the pastors over from the church.
[time=2272] And he was there when we got there.
[time=2274] And we sat down and he shared a scripture with us.
[time=2278] And it's been so meaningful through all this because a little did we know at that point what we would be going through.
[time=2285] I mean, we had some inkling, but we didn't know that it was going to be this intense.
[time=2289] And we knew it was going to be an ongoing thing.
[time=2292] But it was out of 1 Timothy, 1 Timothy chapter 5, if you have your Bibles, you can follow along.
[time=2298] It's verse 4, and it says that, "But if a widow has children or grandchildren, we should learn first of all to put their religion into practice by caring for their own family and so repaying their parents and grandparents.
[time=2311] For this is pleasing to God." It's a struggle when you've been the parent and you're taking care of the kids all of your life.
[time=2320] And all of a sudden now the roles are starting to reverse.
[time=2324] And that has been a big challenge for us as a family.
[time=2328] And for my parents specifically to allow them to allow us to take care of them.
[time=2334] And, you know, there are some pride issues there.
[time=2337] And like I say, the role reversal has been very difficult.
[time=2340] So it's been very challenging.
[time=2343] I've learned a lot of patience in dealing with the situation.
[time=2348] You sit down with the doctor and the doctor says this needs to be done, this needs to happen.
[time=2352] And then you go back and you try to talk with them after they've already talked with the doctor and say, "Well, this is the direction we need to go." And they don't want to do it.
[time=2362] And so our goal is to honor them and to give them dignity in whatever years the Lord will give them on this earth,
[time=2372] but to help them along the process.
[time=2375] And let me tell you, some days I just would throw up my hands and say, "Lord, I don't know what else to do."
[time=2381] I've tried everything, I've tried different avenues of talking with them and making the situation come about that needed to come about.
[time=2388] But the Lord has been faithful in those situations.
[time=2392] It may not have immediately corrected, but something broke through that at least we were able to move a step closer.
[time=2400] And so we have challenging days ahead in making the transition from their house to wherever they'll be next.
[time=2408] But the Lord has taught us patience.
[time=2411] He's taught us a lot of perseverance.
[time=2414] He's taught me leadership when we've had to take over family leadership and help make decisions
[time=2420] when my dad was totally not able to do anything as far as making decisions.
[time=2425] And my mom really counted on him for that, so it's been a lot in there.
[time=2430] And most of all, I think it's really increased my prayer life. And truly looking, as I mentioned before,
[time=2438] about who God is and who I am and saying, "Lord, I'm trying to be faithful.
[time=2443] I'm trying to do what you want me to do." And it seems like there's a wall there.
[time=2448] So Lord, you're going to have to do something, you're helping me.
[time=2451] And He's always been faithful, not maybe the way I wanted it to be, but He's always been faithful.
[time=2457] Scott, do you feel like this is the verse you were reading out of First Timothy?
[time=2460] Do you feel like this is your chance to, in some way, repay the prayers?
[time=2465] Yeah, it really is because we had a great Christian home and we always had everything we needed,
[time=2475] maybe not everything we wanted, but everything we needed.
[time=2478] And so it comes naturally to us to want to do it.
[time=2482] We love our parents and want to honor them and ultimately honor God.
[time=2486] And that's the frustrating part when you get into situations where they don't want to let you do that, but we still persevere.
[time=2494] That's hard. It is. Sarah.
[time=2498] Again, as you're kind of up here, the last three of you, kind of as the grown child routine,
[time=2504] and most of us here are familiar with some of your story of the last few years and some of the struggles that you've been here.
[time=2511] And we ask you, the question to you was kind of, tell us about some of the benefits that you've experienced
[time=2518] as you've been through some really difficult times here in the last couple of years in your life.
[time=2522] Tell us about some of the benefits you've experienced as you've had parents who've come alongside you,
[time=2528] as you've had a father who's been able to lovingly lead, even as a grown child, and a mom who's been able to come alongside and encourage and support you through some difficult times.
[time=2538] Tell us about what that's been like and what some of the benefits are that you've experienced through that.
[time=2547] It's really an honor to be here. I moved into Indianapolis about three years ago.
[time=2551] And so just to look out and realize how many of my brothers and sisters are sitting out there
[time=2558] and at some point have prayed for me or encouraged me, I just want to say thank you before I get to talk about my parents.
[time=2565] My parents, I would always say, anyone, I have some of my friends from Indianapolis actually out here,
[time=2572] and if anyone knows me, when I talk about my family, I will always say that my parents gave me one of the greatest gifts
[time=2578] that I could ever have because they loved each other, and that made for a very secure home.
[time=2584] And things that I have walked through with my friends through my whole life of realizing the levels of struggle
[time=2591] and insecurity and questioning that come from that core.
[time=2595] And so I would have always said that. I still would say that. I consider it one of the greatest gifts that I've been given.
[time=2602] But when I look back, what I realize is that they really have loved God and loved each other and loved us,
[time=2611] which is pretty fun because that's what a Christian body should be about, a Christian family should be about.
[time=2618] If I could tell you a little bit about the last few years, I would say as an encouragement to every parent
[time=2626] to say that my parents had the courage to walk as Christians.
[time=2632] And for those of you who probably don't know me, I had the opportunity to live in Fort Wayne for about three years in my adult life.
[time=2641] I had been married and moved here with my husband at that point. We moved to Indianapolis and it was found that he was involved in another relationship,
[time=2651] and our marriage is no longer.
[time=2654] And that was devastating to say the least for all of the reasons, emotionally that you would expect,
[time=2661] and for the fact that I grieve for what's happened.
[time=2666] And it would have been really easy for my parents to want to defend me and take all of those human approaches,
[time=2675] and they didn't. They were so wise and so loving.
[time=2679] And so I think about, I watch my brothers and their wives with their little kids and I watch my friends and their parents.
[time=2686] And if I could say a word of encouragement, it's to have the courage to take those blind steps and walk obediently.
[time=2694] I was going to just give a couple examples so that you can know, and heavens, my parents are not perfect.
[time=2702] And they know it and we laugh a lot about all of our different faults and quirks.
[time=2708] But my dad is a quiet man and a wise man.
[time=2714] He's walked with God. I can remember being a little kid and getting my cereal and cereal bowl out.
[time=2719] And my dad probably got up two hours before me and was out the door before I ever woke for work, and always was his bible and a devotional book sitting there.
[time=2728] And always was he ready to share what he might be learning or what might be challenging him in that time.
[time=2734] So when I say he's wise, it's not like, oh, you know, now he has some silver hair and he's wise.
[time=2738] He has walked this his whole life.
[time=2741] And he has an unconditional love. If I call, he will drop anything and I appreciate that and value it.
[time=2748] But what I love is I obviously have the gift of gab.
[time=2752] I can talk and talk and talk and talk and need to get through something and he'll let me.
[time=2756] He just listens. But when the time comes and I'm really struggling over an issue, there's a point in which he instructs.
[time=2763] And he gives me wise counsel. And I look to him for that. And I cherish that.
[time=2768] And I look to my mom too, but it's just I continue to marvel at how my dad, I can sometimes really not be right-hearted.
[time=2775] And he still will come in with the quiet words that draw me back to the Scripture.
[time=2779] And so, you know, I don't know where anyone's at and I hope that that can be a word of encouragement.
[time=2785] Mother or father to have the courage to still call on Scripture for guidance and to have the courage to say the words when the moment may not feel right.
[time=2794] And to speak about my mom, she is by far one of the most selfless people I've ever met.
[time=2801] And what's really fun is that not many people realize it because not many people, she doesn't do it for show.
[time=2809] And she has supported me at levels that I feel like I don't deserve to be willing to pray for me and to just weep with me in the moments that were hard, you know.
[time=2823] And she serves and serves her children and prays for us and it is wonderful.
[time=2833] There is a piece where I know that she would do anything.
[time=2837] And what I marvel at is that I look at how full life is and how much demand there is and my parents have both worked.
[time=2848] And so, we talk about love God, love each other and love your children and then love the body.
[time=2856] And that's the amazing piece of God because we can't do it.
[time=2861] And so, it's been really fun to walk as a family through all of our own hardships in the last few years and throw it out and say we can't do it.
[time=2871] And so, instead, we're going to call on you, God, to work in our lives and to use us in our roles and watch you work in ways that are amazing.
[time=2880] So, I guess the piece of what I could say is just to have the courage to really surrender and to be willing to walk obediently.
[time=2894] I think it was Jill Denny that called you and was talking to Sarah about sharing.
[time=2901] And she told me what you said and I know you wouldn't repeat it.
[time=2904] And we don't want to put your parents up as perfect examples, although they've certainly done some things right here and none of the panelists.
[time=2910] But we called and asked Sarah if she'd be willing to come up.
[time=2914] And when we asked people to do stuff, we asked them to come on Wednesday too now that we have the Wednesday service.
[time=2919] And so, we thought it'd be great to ask Sarah to come up and share with us, but we knew what a stretch it would be to get her here on Wednesday.
[time=2926] It's one thing for her to come up, you know, for the weekend from Indianapolis.
[time=2929] It's a whole new thing to come up on Wednesday night, go home and then come back to the weekend.
[time=2933] Sarah's remarks were something to this effect was, "Any chance that I can get to get on stage and talk about my parents?"
[time=2940] And what a great job they do.
[time=2941] She said, "The honor piece." She said she was all over.
[time=2944] Any chance that she got up to honor her parents?
[time=2946] She wanted to do, and it kind of falls back to what Scott was saying in a small, small way to repay your parents for what they've done right.
[time=2955] Hey, let's thank these people, and we've got a few thoughts to wrap up.
[time=2958] Thank you.
[time=2959] Our hope, as we wrap this up, our hope is that you could find yourself in there somewhere.
[time=2975] You know, maybe as the dad, struggling to figure out what it means to lead your family and come along and lovingly lead in your family.
[time=2985] Maybe something Brian said would challenge you and make you think about, "Am I doing that?" Maybe you'll find yourself like me sometimes.
[time=2992] Sort of coming home from work, ready to check out.
[time=2995] Feeling like you've done your job.
[time=2996] I go to work, I earn the money, and I'm coming home checked out, and I'm done.
[time=3001] Maybe you need to learn something Brian said or something he read from the word would challenge you to say, "I need to step up to the plate and learn what it means to lovingly lead at home with my wife, with my kids."
[time=3013] Or maybe as a mom, as a wife, you could learn from Karen and what it means to submit and come alongside.
[time=3021] And maybe you've struggled with that.
[time=3022] Maybe you have a real strong personality, and that's been hard.
[time=3025] Some of the kids here.
[time=3027] Chris's story, he didn't share any of the stories, they told me all the stories of Chris when he was growing up,
[time=3033] and it was interesting to say the least about Chris's growing up years.
[time=3038] It made me chuckle because it's so similar to my own struggle as I was growing up, and maybe some of the kids or even his parents with kids that aren't doing so well right now, you can learn something around down the line with Scott and his whole new role, or Sarah, who's been through some really difficult times and has parents who have done that.
[time=3055] Our prayers that you'd find something in there that would challenge you.
[time=3058] I wanted to read just a couple verses to finish this up.
[time=3061] If you have your Bibles, you can open them up to the book of Ephesians.
[time=3066] Chapter 5, and just a wrap up, just a few thoughts, the last five minutes or so we have.
[time=3074] Ephesus chapter 5, starting with verse 21.
[time=3079] And if you read the Bible often, if you're here for church very often, you hear us talk about families.
[time=3085] This is a series of verses that we read somewhat regularly.
[time=3089] You're probably familiar with it.
[time=3091] Verse 22 of that chapter kind of takes us with the wives, what wives are supposed to be doing,
[time=3097] and what husbands are supposed to be doing.
[time=3099] And then in chapter 6, it tells us what children are supposed to be doing.
[time=3102] Verses that you're probably somewhat familiar with.
[time=3104] I wanted to back up and just highlight a one phrase that goes on there.
[time=3107] Verse 21 kind of gets us into this segment about families.
[time=3117] And I was reading this passage this week as I thought about what we were going to say.
[time=3121] And I caught that phrase out of reverence for Christ.
[time=3124] And it made me think about my own role as a husband, as a dad.
[time=3129] And why do I do what I do at home?
[time=3131] You know, I believe with all my heart, God's called me to lovingly lead at home.
[time=3135] And I thought about why do I do that?
[time=3137] Because I'm smarter, because I'm better, because I know more.
[time=3141] You know, no, none of that's true.
[time=3144] I do it out of reverence for Christ.
[time=3147] And I try my best to try to figure out what this means, like Brian was sharing, to lovingly lead, not because I'm better, not because I'm really even good at it.
[time=3155] I'm not.
[time=3156] But I do it out of reverence for Christ.
[time=3158] Because of Christ, I want to respond this way at home.
[time=3162] And that's why it's worship.
[time=3164] Not because I'm good, not because I've got it figured out, but because of Jesus.
[time=3169] And then I thought of the wives and their struggle to be great moms and come alongside and live out what the Bible says in just a few verses about submitting.
[time=3177] And why do we do that?
[time=3179] Because the husband knows more, because he's a better leader?
[time=3184] No.
[time=3185] There's probably some cases where he's really not.
[time=3188] Why do we do that?
[time=3189] Well, the reason is because of Jesus.
[time=3192] Because of my relationship with Jesus, I want to respond this way at home.
[time=3196] I thought of the kids, you know, obeying their parents, you know, and honoring and obeying.
[time=3202] And why do I honor?
[time=3203] Why do I obey my parents because they're always right?
[time=3206] Well, they probably are most of the time, but no, they're not always right because they have it all.
[time=3211] No.
[time=3212] I do it because of Jesus.
[time=3215] I do it because of my relationship with Christ.
[time=3218] Out of reverence for Christ, I want to jump into this role and do this.
[time=3223] Not because my parents are perfect, not because of any of that.
[time=3227] I do it out of my relationship for Christ.
[time=3229] And that's what really makes it worship when it comes right down to it.
[time=3232] Not the fact that I'm a better leader, therefore that's the role I'm supposed to be in.
[time=3237] I do it because of Jesus.
[time=3239] And we just wanted to kind of close with a challenge to make you think what role is God put you in in your home right now?
[time=3247] What is God calling you?
[time=3248] Is He calling you to honor and obey as a child?
[time=3250] Or like Scott here to step in a whole new realm of what it means to honor and struggling with parents who maybe are aging and the relationships changing?
[time=3259] Are you still at home and a child and need to learn honor and obey your husband, wife?
[time=3264] What's the situation that God has placed you in right now?
[time=3269] And the second is what does it mean to be totally surrendered?
[time=3273] To step into that role out of reverence for Christ.
[time=3276] Not because of anything else, but because of Jesus.
[time=3280] What does it mean for you to be totally surrendered at home?
[time=3283] As a child, as a grown child, husband, wife, what would that look like for you?
[time=3288] And our prayer as we put the whole service together is that you would walk out of here just challenged
[time=3294] a little more to step up the plate and to be totally surrendered at home.
[time=3300] Let's close in prayer and we'll be done.
[time=3305] Heavenly Father, God as I listen to the stories that we heard here.
[time=3311] Stories from Brian and Karen, Sarah and Scott and Chris.
[time=3318] God, I'm challenged.
[time=3320] I'm challenged by how far shore I fall of your standard, God.
[time=3324] You've called me as a dad, as a husband, a lovingly lead.
[time=3329] And God is so easy to check out when I come home sometimes.
[time=3335] God, I pray you'd help me not to do that.
[time=3339] God, I pray for the people here. I pray for the men, the husbands, the dads.
[time=3345] God, that you would help them to do just that, to stay involved when they come home, to step up the plate
[time=3351] and to really lovingly lead their home.
[time=3355] God challenged them with what it means to stay involved, to lead with their kids, to lead with their wife.
[time=3361] God, help the men here to step up to that challenge that Brian was talking about.
[time=3366] God, I pray for the wives here, the moms, God, that you would help them figure out what it means like Karen was saying,
[time=3373] to come alongside, to submit, to play that rollout as you've called them to do out of reverence for you.
[time=3382] God, I want to lift up the kids that are here.
[time=3386] God, my own example of honor and obedience, just like Chris's, is so bad.
[time=3392] And God, I pray that they would be challenged from something Chris said to honor and obey their parents.
[time=3398] Not just because they're right, but because they want to out of reverence for you.
[time=3405] They want to honor. They want to obey.
[time=3409] God, I pray for those adults who are in the situation that Scott's found himself into and where the roles are starting to reverse a little bit.
[time=3418] And suddenly it's not as clear and it's a little bit of a struggle, and God, give them strength.
[time=3426] Give them strength. They have the patience. They have the faith to stay at it.
[time=3430] To learn what it means to honor, even when it's a whole new situation, Father.
[time=3435] Thank you for all that.
[time=3437] And Father, I just pray as we close the service, God, that you would leave.
[time=3440] Let us leave here with just one new idea of what it means for us to be fully surrendered at home.
[time=3448] We just pray these things in your name. Amen.
[time=3452] Before we leave today, I just wanted to again reiterate something to you that we've said to you before.
[time=3457] Number one, you'll see on the screen in just a minute here our new website address.
[time=3462] And there are so many things going on here at Blackhawk these days that we'd love for you to be aware of,
[time=3468] and maybe even learn more about.
[time=3470] And so if you have a few minutes this week, just take some time and go sit down and look us up.
[time=3476] We're excited about the things that are going on.
[time=3479] Also, just to tell you this again, we'd love to hear from you.
[time=3482] If anything you heard today, or if something you've been considering in the last few weeks,
[time=3488] if you've got questions, if you've got needs, if there's any way at all we can come alongside.
[time=3493] Don't hesitate to adjust a note.
[time=3495] Give us a phone call. We'd love to help.
[time=3518] [SILENCE]
