[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=31] Well, as you know, we've begun a series a number of weeks ago on worship.
[time=37] And today we're going to continue that, Kelly Will, this morning for us.
[time=41] And we're going to do something a little different.
[time=43] Now, those of you that are visiting, okay?
[time=45] Don't feel too uncomfortable about this.
[time=47] I may stretch you a little bit.
[time=49] Those of you that only been here one or two times again.
[time=51] Don't worry about this. It's no big deal.
[time=54] I want to pose a question to all of you.
[time=56] And I'd like you to take some time this morning and just turn around in your pew where you're at and just talk about this question with other people that are right there with you.
[time=65] The question is this.
[time=67] What are some reasons that people go to church?
[time=76] Why don't you just take a few moments, talk around each other there.
[time=80] We'll give you a little bit of time.
[time=82] Alright, let's talk about our answers.
[time=93] What are some answers? Just raise your hand, yell it out, whatever.
[time=96] Let me try to say it again.
[time=100] Parents make you go to church.
[time=105] Okay, I can fess.
[time=107] Go ahead.
[time=108] What else?
[time=109] Say it again.
[time=112] Donuts and coffee.
[time=113] Donuts and coffee was another answer.
[time=115] Wow, right there.
[time=117] Say it again.
[time=118] Tradition.
[time=119] Wow, that's a big one.
[time=121] Yes, sir.
[time=122] To worship the Lord with other people.
[time=127] And I think he said other believers.
[time=129] Is that right?
[time=130] Okay.
[time=131] Another?
[time=132] Yes, sir.
[time=133] Fellow ship.
[time=134] This side.
[time=135] We haven't gotten any answers yet.
[time=136] I'll come back over there.
[time=137] It's a habit to go to church.
[time=141] All the way in the back and you better yell loud.
[time=145] To learn God's Word.
[time=147] Great answer.
[time=148] Is there a right or wrong answer here?
[time=152] It's a habit to go to church.
[time=155] All the way in the back and you better yell loud.
[time=158] Learn God's Word.
[time=162] Great answer.
[time=164] Is there a right or wrong answer here?
[time=168] Probably.
[time=172] I don't know that Donuts and Coffee is the right one.
[time=177] Highly doubt Donuts and Coffee being the right one.
[time=180] But have we all at one time or another been there in that answer?
[time=188] Not coming here for the right reason but all the wrong reasons.
[time=195] Well today we're going to look at worship again.
[time=200] And why we come together and worship and how we come together and worship.
[time=207] Enjoy our time this morning of worship and fellowship.
[time=210] Would you do that this morning?
[time=211] Why don't you stand as we begin our worship service with the praise team leading us?
[time=219] Wow.
[time=220] This is the praise team leading us.
[time=225] Oh that is within me Lord.
[time=228] Bless your holy name.
[time=231] I've lived my life to worship you in love.
[time=237] You brought me out of darkness into your glorious light.
[time=243] Forever I will sing of your great Lord.
[time=258] I'd love to see you glorified, to see you lifted high.
[time=264] I yearn to see our nations bowling me.
[time=270] You alone are Jesus who impaws the coldest heart.
[time=276] To find your love and everlasting peace.
[time=289] Now holy, holy, holy.
[time=302] Holy, holy, holy, holy is the Lord.
[time=341] I'd love to see you glorified, to see you lifted high.
[time=353] I yearn to see our nations bowling me.
[time=359] You alone are Jesus who impaws the coldest heart.
[time=365] To find your love and everlasting peace.
[time=380] Holy, holy, holy is the Lord.
[time=429] And your trumpet will sound, and all the heavens will know that the time has finally come.
[time=443] The bride to take her place, and we'll hear the angels see.
[time=456] Holy, holy, holy is the Lord.
[time=508] Thanks, Scott.
[time=513] Good morning, everybody.
[time=516] Great to see all of you.
[time=518] I want to say thanks to Eric Hall and Bob Purdy and others who helped in the last week fill in,
[time=525] and heard nothing but great, great things about your time together last Sunday morning.
[time=529] I want to thank the panel as well.
[time=532] I got a chance to catch a little bit of it on tape and got to actually be a part of that, the prior Wednesday, and just, again, want to thank those people for sharing their hearts and their lives with us as a family.
[time=543] Hope you were encouraged and challenged by it as much as I was.
[time=548] Well, we're going to jump back in here to the series on worship, fully surrendered, completely in awe.
[time=555] And this morning we come to a fully surrendered church.
[time=558] What we've seen so far in our look at worship is that worship isn't.
[time=563] Worship is not a 70-minute service or the singing of a song.
[time=568] No worship we've seen is a way of life.
[time=571] It is an intentional approach to all facets of daily living.
[time=576] It's living out on Thursday, the songs you sing on Sunday.
[time=580] Worship, as we've defined it, is honor and adoration directed to God.
[time=586] Honor, honor directed to God. It's you and I being willing to live lives of honor, coming under his rule, living lives of obedience.
[time=597] Because he's who he is and because we're who we are, we willingly lay ourselves down under his rule.
[time=604] We honor and submit to him.
[time=607] Adoration, honor and adoration directed to God.
[time=611] What is adoration? Adoration is when you and I think, say, sing, pray and shout all that's true about him.
[time=619] It's when you think it, it's when you sing it, it's when you pray it, it's when you say it.
[time=623] And as David said in the Psalms, it's when we shout the truth, all that we know to be true and right about God.
[time=630] Worship is a life lived in response to his irrational love, his amazing grace and his mercies that are new every single morning.
[time=640] And where have we said does real worship begin?
[time=644] What does real worship flow out of?
[time=647] We kind of capsulized it in a sentence, in a phrase that first Sunday, a couple of Sundays ago, real worship flows out of.
[time=655] Real worship begins in a fully, not partially, in a fully surrendered heart.
[time=664] That's where worship begins, a fully surrendered heart, a heart completely given to the Lord.
[time=671] Because you can say, you can sing, you can speak, you can pray, you can shout all you want.
[time=677] If your heart isn't completely his, it isn't worship.
[time=681] Remember Matthew 15, we looked at that just a couple of Sundays ago.
[time=685] In Matthew 15, Jesus himself said, with their lips, remember?
[time=690] He said, with their lips, they honor me.
[time=693] But, but he said their hearts are far from me.
[time=698] And so he says there in that passage, they worship me in what?
[time=702] In vain.
[time=704] Real worship begins with hearts that are thoroughly and deeply and absolutely and completely surrendered to him.
[time=714] Worship requires her heart given totally to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=719] Last week we looked at a fully surrendered family.
[time=722] And what did we see last week?
[time=724] A fully surrendered family isn't perfect.
[time=727] No.
[time=728] A fully surrendered family hasn't arrived by no means.
[time=731] No, a fully surrendered family is when dads, husbands, moms, wives and kids, kids of all ages are doing their best,
[time=739] giving everything they have in the effort to honor God by living their lives as husbands, as wives, as kids,
[time=746] in accordance with God's design.
[time=749] God knows about family.
[time=751] God designed family.
[time=752] God gives us in His Word the way family can work.
[time=756] And dads and husbands and moms and wives and kids when we are completely given in our hearts.
[time=763] Doing everything that we can with His help to follow and abide by and come under that design.
[time=770] That's a fully surrendered situation.
[time=773] And God's Word promises that He will bless.
[time=776] God's Word promises that He will honor those efforts.
[time=779] Challenges will be faced, absolutely.
[time=782] But He's promised to come alongside.
[time=785] So, how about the church?
[time=790] How about a local body of believers?
[time=793] What does a worshiping, fully surrendered church look like?
[time=798] Let's ask ourselves that question this morning and again next week.
[time=802] If that's okay with you, what does a fully surrendered church look like?
[time=807] Does God's Word give us insight?
[time=809] As to the makeup and mindset of a fully surrendered body of believers.
[time=812] You know what?
[time=813] The answer to that is yes, absolutely.
[time=815] God's Word speaks clearly to the issue and gives us great insight and great clarity
[time=821] as to what a fully surrendered body of believers in a local church will look like.
[time=826] And I want you to take a look this morning and I want you to open your eyes and your hearts.
[time=829] But I got to warn you, it is a clear, it is a clear and specific picture that God's Word paints.
[time=838] It holds nothing back and it looks at you, the bride of Christ.
[time=843] It looks at His body and it tells you exactly.
[time=846] In no uncertain terms, what a worshiping, fully surrendered body of believers will look like.
[time=852] What they will do, what they will practice, how they will carry themselves, how they will function.
[time=858] And we won't look at all of it but we'll do our best to take a good stab at it.
[time=864] Fully surrendered hearts bring three things to the church.
[time=871] This morning we'll look at that fully surrendered hearts bring three things to the church.
[time=876] They bring three things to the body.
[time=879] Number one, a fully surrendered heart as it gives itself and brings itself to the church.
[time=886] Fully surrendered churches gather.
[time=889] Write that down.
[time=890] Number one, they gather.
[time=892] That's right.
[time=893] Look with me at Hebrews.
[time=895] Chapter 10, if you would, back towards the back of your New Testament.
[time=902] Fully surrendered hearts as they posture themselves in the context of a local church, there's some things that they do.
[time=909] One thing they do for sure is they gather.
[time=912] Hebrews chapter 10, we're going to pick it up in verse 23.
[time=916] It says in Hebrews 10, 23, let us hold fast.
[time=921] The confession of our hope without wavering.
[time=924] You see it there?
[time=925] Let us hold fast.
[time=927] It says the confession of our hope without wavering for he who promised is faithful.
[time=933] And let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds, not forsaking our own assembling together
[time=941] as is the habit of some, but instead encouraging one another.
[time=947] And all the more as you see the day drawing near.
[time=951] Do you see that?
[time=953] Fully surrendered hearts that are part of a fully surrendered church consistently and faithfully come together.
[time=961] They will not forsake, it says.
[time=964] Being together, the consistent pattern will be that when the body gathers, they will gather.
[time=972] And the command there in Hebrews 10 is do not even think about.
[time=976] It is said with great force and with great strength in the text, don't forsake being together.
[time=986] Well, how easy it is.
[time=988] Okay, and I don't say this at you.
[time=992] Okay, I say this with you because I understand, I think, to a large degree.
[time=998] But how easy it is not to.
[time=1003] How easy it is sometimes.
[time=1005] How easy it's become, maybe I should say, to not gather.
[time=1010] How easy it is to find so many reasons to forsake the assembling of the body.
[time=1018] You're tired, you're tired, you wake up tired and you just want to sleep.
[time=1025] You're sad, you're hurting.
[time=1027] The last thing you want to do is listen to me or sing songs.
[time=1032] Maybe your house project list needs attention, it's growing, there's more to do and you're further behind.
[time=1039] Your kid has a game or a tournament.
[time=1043] You're in relational conflict with someone and you don't want to see him.
[time=1047] You want to catch a game on TV, watch a movie do back at six or just not have to hassle with baths and Sunday clothes and the chaos of a minivan late for Sunday school yet again.
[time=1061] And so oftentimes it becomes easy to forsake it.
[time=1066] I've been there, all the above.
[time=1069] But God's word says to me and God's word says to you, be there.
[time=1074] Don't forsake it.
[time=1077] Well why?
[time=1079] I mean let's just try and get on the reasoning side of this thing.
[time=1083] What is it that goes on?
[time=1084] Many of you said some things earlier that were so very true and I think really right as far as answers go.
[time=1089] Why?
[time=1090] He's emphatic, he's clear, don't forsake it.
[time=1093] No, no, be there, the pattern of life should be for those in the body, those fully surrendered.
[time=1099] Those who are here, he says be together, why?
[time=1102] Why be faithful together?
[time=1104] This won't be in your outline.
[time=1105] You might want to just make some room over on the side and write these things down.
[time=1109] Why be faithful together?
[time=1111] We're going to go back to our Hebrews passage.
[time=1113] Look at verse 23 with me again.
[time=1115] A couple of things I want you to see.
[time=1117] We'll answer that question.
[time=1118] Why?
[time=1119] Be faithful together.
[time=1120] Number 1 verse 23 says this, "Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering."
[time=1127] We are to hold fast, it says there, without wavering to our confession.
[time=1132] Who's our confession?
[time=1134] Who is it?
[time=1136] Jesus.
[time=1137] That's right.
[time=1138] Our confession is Christ.
[time=1140] We are to hold fast without wavering to our confession.
[time=1144] That is, we are to hold fast to the person of Christ and that whom we have committed to.
[time=1151] When I come each week into this place, I am reminded, I don't know about you, when I come here each week, when I gather in this room with you, I am reminded in a hundred different ways of him.
[time=1162] I'm reminded of who he is.
[time=1164] I'm reminded of what he's done.
[time=1165] I'm reminded of his great love.
[time=1167] I'm reminded of him.
[time=1169] It says in Hebrews 3, go back several chapters to the beginning of that book.
[time=1173] That we were just in Hebrews 3.
[time=1178] It says in Hebrews 3, we'll pick it up there in verse 1.
[time=1182] Then we're going to skip down to verse 6.
[time=1186] One reason we are to gather is to hold fast without wavering to our confession.
[time=1192] To our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1194] It says in Hebrews 3 verse 1, "Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling,
[time=1200] consider Jesus the apostle and high priest of our confession."
[time=1206] In verse 6 it says, "But Christ was faithful, as a son over his house, whose house we are,
[time=1213] if we hold fast our confidence, and the boast of our hope firm until the end.
[time=1220] But Christ was faithful, as a son over his house, whose house we are, if we hold fast our confidence,
[time=1227] and the boast of our hope firm until the end." I'll tell you what, when I'm here each week, with you week after week, I am reminded in the songs that we sing, I am reminded in the truth that we read and study, that he was faithful.
[time=1244] I'm reminded he was faithful, that a price was paid, that a life was sacrificed, and that thousands of lives since have been given so that the church could gather.
[time=1256] And it's his faithfulness, and it's his love for me, and it's my confession of him, and it's all of those who have gone before you, and all of those who have gone before me, who held fast to their confession that makes this possible, and so we gather.
[time=1271] And we do it thankfully, and we should do it gratefully, and we should sense every day the price that was paid
[time=1278] so that we could have the privilege of holding on to him.
[time=1282] Why gather? Write it down, first of all, to hold on to, to hold on to, and meet with him.
[time=1289] It is to hold on to our confession.
[time=1293] Second thing I want you to see there in Hebrews 10, why be faithful to gather number two to encourage and be encouraged?
[time=1300] Write that down. To encourage, and be encouraged.
[time=1305] Look at verses 24 and 25, Hebrews 10.
[time=1310] It says, "And let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds,
[time=1316] not forsaking our own assembling together as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another,
[time=1323] and all the more as you see the day drawing near."
[time=1330] I was just thinking this last night, and I say it to you freely and from my heart sometimes, you guys.
[time=1338] Sometimes, as I look at my life, and sometimes as I look at what I give myself to here,
[time=1345] what we give ourselves to together here, sometimes I think I'm nuts.
[time=1352] I don't know if you ever feel that way, but there's days when I feel like I'm crazy.
[time=1359] Let me explain.
[time=1361] Some weeks having faced broken hearts, some weeks having faced broken promises, some weeks having faced broken homes, having faced disgruntled and angry voices
[time=1372] and ministry results that aren't all consistent with what I'd hoped for or dreamed of some days, I start to think that leading a church, helping seekers and guiding the already convinced is just too hard, too draining, too confusing, and too much.
[time=1388] And I think, "You know what? I'm nuts." And then, and it happens often, then I walk through those doors, and I see you.
[time=1406] I walk through those doors, I come into this place on a Wednesday night or a Sunday morning, I shake your hands, I see your faces, I hear your voices, and I'm reminded in powerful ways of your stories.
[time=1417] That your husband left you two months ago.
[time=1422] You lost your job six weeks ago.
[time=1426] Your kids are going the other way fast.
[time=1431] You, you're dying, you're terminally ill.
[time=1435] Your newfound faith in Christ is being challenged by your family.
[time=1440] You over there, you're doing everything possible to share truth with a seeking friend.
[time=1445] You in the balcony, you're trying to honor God in the way you parent.
[time=1449] And it's hard, and you feel defeated more than victorious.
[time=1454] You in the back, you're new in town, lonely, and trying to fit in.
[time=1460] And you, you over here, you're happy. Life's good.
[time=1464] And you serve as a lighthouse to a lot of people who at this stage of the game need your encouragement.
[time=1471] Sometimes I feel like I'm nuts, and you know what I conclude?
[time=1474] I conclude every week I walk in this place, we desperately need each other.
[time=1480] I need you, and I don't mind saying that. You encourage me.
[time=1485] You encourage me, and maybe I encourage you, and together as we faithfully gather on Sunday mornings
[time=1491] and common ground on Wednesday nights, we stimulate each other to love and good deeds.
[time=1496] And you do that with me, I want you to know that.
[time=1499] And you do that with others, I'm sure.
[time=1502] Sometimes people ask me, "Hey, why do you take Fridays off?" Why don't you take, why don't you take Mondays, most pastors take Mondays off?
[time=1510] What's with the Friday thing? Well, I'll tell you what it is.
[time=1513] I suppose part of it's the way I'm wired, but I'll tell you this.
[time=1516] A lot of it is what goes on here Sunday.
[time=1519] What goes on here Sunday, as we meet together, when I see you, and when I shake your hand, and when I hear your voice, and when I hear your stories, when I see what God's doing in this place, and sometimes I see all that directly, and sometimes I get it from you indirectly.
[time=1533] But being with this family on Sunday, you couldn't pay me to stay away on Monday.
[time=1541] You ask my wife, you ask anybody that works with me Monday morning, my head, my heart, my mind, you just absolutely fall.
[time=1548] The fall that we've shared together, all that we've experienced, and I cannot wait.
[time=1553] You stimulate me and my heart and my mind to love and good deeds, because of your faithfulness to be here,
[time=1562] to join arms and to join hearts and to be together.
[time=1567] And when you're not here, when you don't come, when it's the house project list,
[time=1573] or the game, or the movie, or whatever else, not that there's not room for those things, please hear me, we're talking about patterns here.
[time=1582] When you don't come, I miss you, my life misses you, and others miss out,
[time=1589] and the body isn't what it could be.
[time=1593] Be here, be here, we cannot encourage each other.
[time=1598] No one gets stimulated to love and good deeds if we're not together.
[time=1603] And God's word says don't forsake it, and some of you need to be here more often.
[time=1610] And others of you need to be faithful to stay at it, because the temptations and the opportunities are many.
[time=1617] God's word says be here.
[time=1621] So number one, they gather.
[time=1623] Number two, they exercise spiritual gifts, write it down.
[time=1626] A fully surrendered heart, as it postures itself, in the midst of a local body of believers,
[time=1633] that body of fully surrendered will exercise spiritual gifts.
[time=1638] Fully surrendered hearts not only understand serving.
[time=1642] Okay, get this.
[time=1644] They not only understand serving, but are fanatically given over to, and devoted to serving.
[time=1650] With serving hearts engaged, and serving sleeves rolled up, they live out what it says in Ephesians chapter four.
[time=1657] Turn, if you would back a few books to the book of Ephesians.
[time=1661] This great letter that Paul wrote to the church at Ephesus.
[time=1666] And he says there, and Ephesians four, doing his best here to help Timothy understand how church was to work,
[time=1674] how this whole thing was to play itself out.
[time=1678] He gets very specific, and he gets very clear. Ephesians four, we're going to start in verse 11.
[time=1685] He reminds the folks there at Ephesus, and Timothy, their pastor, he says in verse 11, and he gave some as pastors, excuse me, and he gave some as apostles, and some as prophets,
[time=1696] and some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers.
[time=1700] Why?
[time=1701] Why did he give the body, pastors and teachers?
[time=1705] Why did he give the church evangelists, and prophets and apostles?
[time=1711] Why were these men, why were these individuals given to the body of Christ?
[time=1716] For verse 12, for the equipping of the saints, for the work of service to the building up of the body of Christ.
[time=1725] That's why.
[time=1727] He gives the church leadership.
[time=1729] He gives the church those who will stand in proclaimed truth so that in the proclaiming of truth the people,
[time=1735] those coming fully surrendered can be built up and equipped because in God's design, the entire work of ministry is for the unpaid in essence.
[time=1748] He gives the unpaid the paid so that the paid can faithfully and strategically,
[time=1754] and before God do their very best to equip and nurture and build up so that the family of God
[time=1762] can, by the spirit of God, do the work of God in his church.
[time=1771] Angie, Angie pulls into the parking lot as she does every Monday night,
[time=1777] but on this night, she drives past her usual spot and parks her car by the maintenance building at the rear of the church property.
[time=1784] Walking back toward the church building, she silently thanks God again for the mechanics who volunteer their time on Monday nights.
[time=1793] You see, while Angie attends the ministry for single mothers and her daughter attends a class for Children of Divorce,
[time=1799] a greased smeared hero with his back on a concrete floor replaces the U joints on her car.
[time=1806] This is church.
[time=1811] He's gone, man.
[time=1815] The paramedic speaks slowly and softly as if to ease the truth into Karen's mind,
[time=1821] but the truth strikes like a missile and explodes in shock and loneliness.
[time=1825] She feels jerked from reality, thrust into a twilight zone of pain.
[time=1829] Then the gentle touch of Ang's hand draws her back.
[time=1834] Jeff's firm embrace surrounds her with strength.
[time=1837] Strength, Jenny's whispered word, reminds her she is not alone.
[time=1841] The tears that fall from David's eyes help her find her own.
[time=1845] For over two years, Tom and Karen had poured time, energy and love, and to each member of the small group they led, now the love circles back and soothes the raw edges of grief.
[time=1856] This is church.
[time=1859] For 30 years, they've played a role in the life of this church they helped start.
[time=1864] Now this year will be no different.
[time=1866] He sees young families in need of truth and so at age 60.
[time=1871] He's changing diapers and standing a post by a crib.
[time=1875] She's convinced that her grandchildren's generation needs love, wisdom and fun so she joins the junior high staff, 31 years of service and counting.
[time=1887] This is church.
[time=1891] You see people from gifts of service, teaching, mercy, helps and shepherding.
[time=1897] As seen in the above stated examples, God's word calls you the family of God to do the work of God,
[time=1903] gifted by the Spirit of God which each of you are who know him this morning, so that the church of God can grow.
[time=1912] It is up to you.
[time=1914] It is absolutely up to you, the people of God, exercising gifts given by the Spirit of God,
[time=1922] ministering to and giving themselves all the time fanatically to the church of God so that it can grow.
[time=1929] What do we mean by grow in numbers? No, not necessarily.
[time=1932] That sometimes comes, but more than that, much more important than that.
[time=1936] Look how that passage continues.
[time=1938] Go back to Ephesians 4.
[time=1940] Because it says in verse 13, having said what he said in 11 and 12, it says in 13 until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God
[time=1952] to a mature man to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ.
[time=1958] And it says in verse 14, as a result, we are no longer to be children tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine
[time=1967] by the trickery of men, by craftiness and deceitful scheming, but speaking the truth and love, we are to grow up in all aspects into him who was the head, even Christ.
[time=1979] Here you go, from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by that which every joint supplies,
[time=1987] according to the proper working of each individual part, causing the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love.
[time=1998] See what happens?
[time=2000] When everybody plays, when there's nobody left on the bench,
[time=2008] when everybody's thrown off the warm-up coat, rolled up their sleeves, engaged their hearts, the body of Christ gets grown,
[time=2017] it gets matured, it becomes more like the person of Christ.
[time=2023] And interesting, don't miss this.
[time=2025] At the beginning of that passage, we see a benefit, and at the end of that passage, we see a benefit.
[time=2031] Go back to Ephesians 4, it says in verse 13, "Until we all attain to the unity of the faith," he gave some of his pastors and teachers,
[time=2042] "for the equipping of the saints, for the work of service to the building up of the body," and then it says in verse 13, "until we all attain to the unity of the faith," then it describes what that looks like, and then it ends with causing the growth,
[time=2058] the last line of verse 16, causing the growth of the body for the building up of itself in what your Bible say.
[time=2066] Love.
[time=2067] Do you see that?
[time=2068] When everybody plays, when no one's on the bench, when hearts are engaged and serving sleeves rolled up,
[time=2075] the local body gets unified, and it gets to be a loving organism,
[time=2082] a loving, unified church, write it down, a loving, unified church is the result of people,
[time=2089] all people of all ages serving all the time.
[time=2093] Now watch this, when some serve and some don't, I mean, I think it's pretty obvious.
[time=2100] If a loving, unified church is the result of a fully surrendered body saying,
[time=2107] "Hey, I'm in," well, then when the opposite is true, when some serve and some don't,
[time=2116] you get a burned out, you get a burned out and fractured body.
[time=2122] Write it down, you get a burned out and fractured body.
[time=2129] How about us?
[time=2131] Where are we today?
[time=2133] I can't tell you how thankful I am to hear the numbers that Ty mentioned this morning.
[time=2136] I had heard a few things during the week to realize that last year at this time we were looking for and hoping for and praying for over 40, 45 people with our children's ministry,
[time=2146] which is an enormous ministry.
[time=2148] God continues to bring families and kids to this church.
[time=2151] There continues to be this incredible need to help guide and direct and give love and best truth and year by year by year.
[time=2160] You are willingness to serve, you're willingness to cross over lines, you're willingness to go and do things that you may not even be comfortable with continues to be an encouragement.
[time=2169] There's needs with our kids.
[time=2171] You've got those yellow cards, some of you still.
[time=2173] You didn't turn one in today in the plate.
[time=2175] And you know what you need to?
[time=2177] Because there's a great opportunity waiting for you to roll up your sleeves and engage your heart and meet some people in love on some little lives that need your love desperately.
[time=2186] There's room in the choir.
[time=2188] There's room in our worship ministry.
[time=2191] You could if you plan instrument, if you just even like to sing.
[time=2194] You don't even have to sing well.
[time=2196] If you like to sing, if you love the thought of helping lead this family into the presence
[time=2202] of God, there's room in the choir.
[time=2204] There's room in the band.
[time=2205] You come talk to Scott and Denny.
[time=2207] Student ministries needs always is open to.
[time=2210] You talk to Rick Vance.
[time=2212] If there would be a desire in your heart to help give guidance and leadership and friendship to a student here in our church, middle school or high school, needs always there.
[time=2221] The living Christmas tree is coming up.
[time=2223] That's right.
[time=2224] It's almost that time where this church begins to just absolutely focus its effort, give
[time=2230] days and nights and hours and time to one of the greatest things we get to do each year, and that is proclaim the truth in a special and exciting way each December.
[time=2239] Living Christmas tree opportunities are coming.
[time=2242] Nursery needs are there.
[time=2244] Sound text.
[time=2246] You name it.
[time=2248] Whatever's on your heart, whatever God's gifting you to do, whatever talents you have, my
[time=2255] hope, God's Word says that he would be fully surrendered in your posture as you live life
[time=2264] and are a part of this family.
[time=2266] And one of the things that he requires and one of the things that he asks is that you exercise your spiritual gifts.
[time=2275] Well, they gather.
[time=2276] They're faithful together.
[time=2278] They exercise their gifts because that's what the body of Christ does.
[time=2283] And thirdly, surrendered hearts give sacrificially.
[time=2288] Twenty-nine years old and worth a million dollars.
[time=2302] Twenty-nine years old and worth a million dollars headed straight toward the top, actually
[time=2308] almost there, then the rich young ruler meets Jesus.
[time=2314] Late on the line, the Lord says, lay it on the line.
[time=2320] Put your money where your mouth is.
[time=2322] Put your earnings where your heart is.
[time=2325] It's December.
[time=2326] It's building fun time.
[time=2328] The rich young ruler stares at the stage in the overcrowded, run-down theater that the young congregation calls home.
[time=2335] He shifts in the dirty seat and smashes another kernel of popcorn under his hill.
[time=2340] He'll lay it on the line, the Savior says.
[time=2344] The rich young ruler tucks his hand into the pocket of his corduroy coat and gently fingers
[time=2351] the tiny paper that defines his success.
[time=2356] When the offering plate is passed, he carefully slides a check that shatters his net worth
[time=2363] beneath the mound of crumpled bills.
[time=2371] Two examples for you today of sacrificial giving.
[time=2375] Two examples of fully surrendered giving for every one of us to prayerfully consider.
[time=2381] Examples that I want you to see again that would cause you, I hope, to be willing to
[time=2387] carefully consider, contemplate, and act upon.
[time=2392] All of you, all ages, those that call Black Hawk Home, understand fully surrendered hearts
[time=2401] give sacrificially.
[time=2403] First, I want to draw your attention to 2 Corinthians 8.
[time=2407] 2 Corinthians 8, 1 to 5, back there before Ephesians, just after 1 Corinthians.
[time=2413] 2 Corinthians 8, verses 1 to 5, which is where Paul holds up a group of people called the
[time=2421] Macedonians.
[time=2422] And he holds them up for all to see because they were models of sacrificial giving.
[time=2428] This church, this Macedonian group of believers, decided to and purposed in their hearts to
[time=2434] give a gift.
[time=2435] And it's not so much the gift, but it's how they gave it.
[time=2438] It's what they went through.
[time=2439] It's the mindset, it's the heart set.
[time=2442] It's the way they approached this that we want you to see and contemplate and give thought to this morning.
[time=2447] Why does Paul hold up the Macedonians?
[time=2449] Well, because look how they gave.
[time=2452] 2 Corinthians 8, verse 1, "Now brethren, we wish to make known to you the grace of God, which has been given in the churches of Macedonia, that in a great ordeal of affliction,
[time=2462] their abundance of joy and their deep poverty overflowed in the wealth of their liberality.
[time=2468] For I testify that according to their ability and beyond their ability, they gave of their
[time=2475] own accord, begging us, begging us with much entreaty for the favor of participation in
[time=2483] the support of the saints, and this, not as we had expected, but first they gave themselves
[time=2489] to the Lord and to us then by the will of God." I want you to see four things there, and again, find some room, write these things down, important
[time=2499] stuff.
[time=2500] Number one, look at verse two, "That in a great ordeal of affliction, their abundance
[time=2506] of joy and their deep poverty overflowed in the wealth of their liberality." Here's how I wrote that down, "Though in poverty and in great affliction, they gave joyfully and liberally." Let's write a few of those words down, "In poverty and in great affliction." You got that?
[time=2525] These people were in poverty and great affliction.
[time=2531] As you study that verse, and as you look at that phrase right there, you realize that what that really means is that financially they were troubled financially and personally.
[time=2543] They were troubled financially and personally, though in poverty and great affliction they gave next part.
[time=2549] They gave joyfully and liberally.
[time=2554] They were happy and they were excited.
[time=2558] They wanted to give.
[time=2561] There was a joy in their spirit and they gave liberally.
[time=2565] In the vernacular of our day, they gave a lot.
[time=2569] They gave a lot.
[time=2572] How many times—and I'm just asking myself this question, if you want to ask yourself
[time=2578] you can—how many times is my own church giving?
[time=2585] How many times is my own regular gift to the body of Christ, the first thing to go when
[time=2594] things get tight?
[time=2596] I've learned a little bit and we keep working at that, but I'll raise my hand and say,
[time=2603] "I've been there." When the unexpected happens, when things all of a sudden go south, when things get really, really sticky, how many times have you and how many times have I in our hearts and minds
[time=2615] almost instantaneously thought, "Well, we can do that with that."
[time=2626] In poverty and in great affliction, they gave joyfully and liberally.
[time=2631] I'm looking for—number two, I want you to see this.
[time=2635] Second thing, write this down.
[time=2636] They gave more than they had.
[time=2639] Write it down.
[time=2640] They gave more than they had.
[time=2641] In verse 3, "For I testify that according to their ability and beyond their ability."
[time=2648] You see that?
[time=2649] They gave of their own accord.
[time=2652] Beyond—what does that mean?
[time=2654] It means simply this—beyond their immediate ability, beyond what in the current context
[time=2661] of their life and what they could see and what they could get their hands on, beyond what was their intangible, beyond their immediate ability, they chose to exercise faith.
[time=2675] This is where you see faith coming into this arena of sacrificial giving.
[time=2682] I've had conversations with people and genuine people, honestly wrestling with this issue,
[time=2688] honestly trying to make sense of something that doesn't make sense.
[time=2692] They're trying, and they want to get there, and I've been there, and I've asked the same questions, and there were countless times when I would say to those, "Trying to help me with this same issue." I would say, "Yeah, okay, okay, but if I gave that much, how in the world?" They'd stop.
[time=2708] Right there.
[time=2709] They'd say, "Stop." If you gave that much, and then we start asking those questions, "How would I?
[time=2715] How would we?" I understand God also gives us brains.
[time=2720] He wants us to be discerning.
[time=2721] He doesn't want us to be over the edge and completely gone, but there is a sin, there
[time=2727] is a balance in there.
[time=2729] And God's word seems to strike it as it calls you and I to through these people in Macedonia,
[time=2736] as God's word calls us to consider a kind of giving and a level of sacrifice that doesn't
[time=2742] always make sense, that sometimes stretches our faith and sometimes pushes us to a point
[time=2750] where we don't have an answer, but we know in our hearts God's leading us.
[time=2755] We know in our hearts God's moving us.
[time=2757] We know in our hearts we want desperately to have our faith stretched and our investment
[time=2765] in what he's doing grown.
[time=2768] They gave more than they had.
[time=2772] And they thirdly write this down, they begged to give, they begged to give.
[time=2781] These individuals had an attitude, they had to give, they wanted desperately to be given
[time=2788] the opportunity.
[time=2789] And it's not a pride thing, no, it's a heart thing that sees value in and understands what's
[time=2795] most important in life and it wants to deep down to the core of his being.
[time=2802] This individual wants to and beg to Paul on the apostles to let them be a part of a gift
[time=2808] of this nature.
[time=2811] Fourth thing I want you to see there is what kind of people give like this.
[time=2817] What kind of people give like this?
[time=2818] Look at verse 5.
[time=2820] And this, not as we had expected, but they first gave themselves to the Lord.
[time=2827] And then to us by the will of God.
[time=2829] What kind of people give like this?
[time=2831] Those completely surrendered to him.
[time=2834] Those thoroughly and absolutely given to the Lord.
[time=2842] You get those things down, poverty and affliction.
[time=2845] They gave joyfully and they gave a lot.
[time=2848] They gave more than they had, they allowed faith and the balance and the tension of faith to come into their giving.
[time=2854] They begged to give and they were a people who gave in that fashion because they were thoroughly and completely and absolutely given to him.
[time=2862] If every individual or family that calls Black Hawk home gave like this, what do I mean like this?
[time=2868] I mean sacrificially on a regular basis and by sacrificially I mean this.
[time=2873] In ways that stretch faith, in ways that clarify priorities and in ways that don't forget this, alter life.
[time=2882] Because that's when it gets sacrificial.
[time=2885] It gets sacrificial and priorities get clarified and faith gets stretched when on a regular
[time=2891] basis the people, people of God give in ways that are sacrificial.
[time=2899] And that is for you to consider.
[time=2901] That is for you to think through.
[time=2904] And one thing you've got to remind yourself of and I've got to remind myself of it constantly and that is this.
[time=2910] And we miss this.
[time=2912] It would be something that I think most of us would at the drop of a hat admit to be true and realize to be true.
[time=2920] Sometimes when it comes to this arena and how far we'll go and how much we'll be stretched,
[time=2927] sometimes we forget it and the truth that you've got to remember is this, none of it's yours.
[time=2933] None of it is mine.
[time=2936] You can look at my checkbook, you can look at my savings book, I mean you can look at my 403b, you know, I can look at yours, you can look at mine.
[time=2944] We can think, wow, look what we've got, none of it.
[time=2948] None of it is yours.
[time=2951] Every penny that he's given, no matter how little or no matter how much, every penny is his.
[time=2959] And he has simply said to you and he has said to me here, I'm entrusting this to you, use it wisely, use it for what matters, handle it in a way that honors me.
[time=2970] It isn't yours, don't get attached to it, you can't leave with it.
[time=2977] And so don't forget it, if in this place, every one of us that called this place home
[time=2983] gave on a regular basis, in that fashion, there would be more than we would know what
[time=2989] to do with that I'm convinced of.
[time=2994] And that is an issue between you and him.
[time=2996] I love the words, I love the words of Jamelian, Jamelian, the martyr who gave himself along
[time=3003] with others in Ecuador, Jamelian said this, he is no fool, he is no fool who gives what
[time=3011] he cannot keep in order to gain what he cannot lose.
[time=3017] He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep in order to gain that which he cannot lose.
[time=3025] And my hope and my prayer for you, for me, for this family is that we would be a people
[time=3031] deeply committed to gathering, fanatically given over, to serving, to exercising gifts,
[time=3040] and the people who would before God come to points of faith, come to points of willingness
[time=3048] to given ways that really, that really make a difference because that's what a fully surrendered
[time=3055] church does.
[time=3058] Well I want to ask the folks to come back up, we're going to close in the song and I want to ask you to sing it from your hearts and I believe that what we're talking about today
[time=3068] and what we'll talk about next week is we come back together as we come back to be together and worship.
[time=3075] Believe it's a song that gives us great hope, it says come now is the time to worship.
[time=3082] And I hope that as you think through worship and as you consider the fact again that it's not just a 70 minute service, it's a way of life, it's where you're going to go after we break from here, it's what tonight's going to entail, it's the way you handle yourself at work, it's everything about you, it's you and how you respond and what you think and
[time=3101] what you say in every walk and facet of life.
[time=3104] And I hope as you think that through and I hope as we continue to spend these times together you'll be encouraged and reminded, it is the time.
[time=3112] Now is the time, today right here and two hours from now and three days from now, now
[time=3119] is the time to worship, let's pray real quick, God thanks for the morning and we pray that as we lift our voices to you now that you would be honored.
[time=3127] And we also pray God that as we leave, as it relates to gathering and as it relates to gifts and as it relates to giving, God that you would be at work and that our hearts and our minds would be open and sensitive to that which you would want and that we would have the courage and that we would have enough trust and belief in your design to give ourselves
[time=3148] to it in ways, God that might be scary but that are right.
[time=3153] We look forward to what you'll do, we thank you for what you've been doing, God thanks for allowing us to be a part of your church and please accept our worship, your son's name we pray, amen.
[time=3169] Stand with us now, sing, come now is the time to worship, come now is the time to worship,
[time=3195] come now is the time to give your heart, come just as you are to worship, come just as you
[time=3217] are to worship, come just as you are to worship, come just as you are to worship, come just
[time=3217] [REPETITIVE CONTENT - 148 seconds] are to worship, come just as you are to worship, come just as you are to worship, come just...
[time=3386] now is the time to give your heart, come just as you are to worship, come just as you are
[time=3408] to worship, come just as you are to worship, come just as you are to worship, come just
[time=3448] might be, we believe is the time to worship you, to live lives that are willing to honor
[time=3456] and extend to you and you alone the adoration that you deserve and so God as we leave that
[time=3462] will be our hope, that will be our desire, that will be our intent and God help us envision
[time=3470] us, impassion us, give us courage and boldness to do that very thing to live lives of worship.
[time=3478] Thank you for all that you have done, thank you for who you are and God bring us back
[time=3508] to you.
[time=3538] You
