[time=1085] (applause) - Wow, what a great start.
[time=1089] Hey, I had a guy walk up to me this morning.
[time=1091] Good friend of mine.
[time=1093] Little on the older side, you know what I mean?
[time=1095] Little on the old side.
[time=1097] He comes up to me and he says, "Hey, I got something for you." And he hands me this little baggy and he's got this white thing in it.
[time=1103] And I said, "Well, what in the world is that?" And he says, "It's a handkerchief. I know you've never heard a one." (laughter) He says, "I watched you on the Bible hour this morning and I'm tired of watching you wipe your sweat on your pants." So here.
[time=1115] (laughter) (applause) Man.
[time=1123] So then I walked away and he just wanted to make sure and he says, "Hey, you got to take it out of the bag to use it." (laughter) Don't forget.
[time=1130] But I don't know, I just never used one.
[time=1132] I kind of feels like, I don't know, it just feels kind of weird.
[time=1134] So, well, I'll just get used to it.
[time=1136] We'll work on that, okay?
[time=1139] We'll work on the whole, what's it called it?
[time=1142] Whatever, hanker, hank whatever, hankerchief.
[time=1146] (laughter) You know, I've always, I have always viewed myself just personally as being really, really progressive.
[time=1158] It's just kind of how I've always looked at myself.
[time=1160] I've always opened a change, always finding myself in a situation where I was leading change, kind of a champion of change.
[time=1167] I love change, I've always, always have.
[time=1170] Ever since I can remember, in high school, in college, in any position of influence I've ever been in, to breathe new life and new hope and new direction into the organization was always one of the greatest thrills and joys of leadership.
[time=1185] I've always just kind of been that way.
[time=1187] It seems to be the way God wired me.
[time=1189] I've never been afraid of new things.
[time=1191] Always loved the opportunity to explore new things.
[time=1194] And it's just kind of who I am.
[time=1196] I saw a cartoon this week that kind of, I guess, maybe just reminded me a little bit of me, and it also reminded me a little bit of you and your patience with me at times.
[time=1206] I think it's going to come up on the screen here.
[time=1208] It says, "Pastor, we've put up with praise courses, "worship bands, interpretive dance in you preaching "in blue jeans, but we draw the line at bungee baptisms." (laughter) Now, look at that picture.
[time=1220] That's kind of cool, isn't it?
[time=1222] I mean, it does get the mind going.
[time=1224] I mean, it starts getting you thinking about maybe how we could do baptisms.
[time=1228] Someday, someday, not now.
[time=1231] Not now.
[time=1233] I've always been quick, sometimes too quick, and I'll admit that to you.
[time=1239] I've always been quick to seize new opportunities and tackle new projects.
[time=1245] There's always been kind of that energy in me.
[time=1247] I'll never forget the very first church I've ever got to serve in, and I've told you all stories about this place.
[time=1253] Some good, some bad, some sad, some difficult, and some very encouraging, but it was the first church I ever got to serve at.
[time=1260] I was serving at this church with a really, really good friend of mine named Russ, and Russ and I kind of joined our arms and joined our hearts, and we jumped into this thing about 110 people.
[time=1270] Church had been there about 50 years, and they said, "Come on, and lead us." And we said, "Wow, we'd love to." And so the very first thing we ever did was, we planned a work day at the church, and we were so fired up, he and I, for this work day.
[time=1286] We got there like an hour early, and we had invited the whole church to come and bring your shovels, and bring your hose, and bring your bags, and we'll pick up garbage, and we'll help the flower gardens, and we'll clean the inside, and we'll do windows, and boy, we were excited, and so we get there early.
[time=1301] Very first time we've actually ever really been in the deal there, and we walk into the sanctuary, and I'll never forget we came walking down, the place was empty, and at the foot of the aisle was this twisted, dilapidated, dirty, old, crickety, half-broken table, sitting right down here at the front.
[time=1322] And I looked at this table, I said, "Hey Russ, what's up with this table, man, this is not fit.
[time=1326] This is dirty, it's old, it's broken down." He says, "Yeah, that's gotta go." And so we went out without even thinking.
[time=1332] I pick up this old table, I just pick it up.
[time=1335] I pick it up, I throw it on my shoulder, and we make a few more observations, you know, very young, very impetuous, very immature.
[time=1343] I got this table on my back, and we walk out the aisle into the parking lot to the dumpster.
[time=1350] 'Cause there's things that piece of trash, and we're in the house of God, we have something sharp down here in front, right?
[time=1355] So we're making our move.
[time=1357] So we get out of the dumpster, it's pretty full.
[time=1359] We throw this table up in the dumpster, and it won't go all the way down.
[time=1363] And we're trying to reach up and squish it, but it won't work, so then we kind of start having fun.
[time=1367] We climb up on the edge of the dumpster, and we get up on the edge of that dumpster, and he's on that end, and I'm on this, and they were laughing, and we're going, boom, and we're crunching this table down into the dumpster, and the legs of the table are flying off, and it's splintering into a thousand pieces, and we're laughing, and we're choking, and we're having such a good time, we're starting the workday.
[time=1388] And as we're doing this, all of a sudden a truck pulls in to the parking lot, and there's these three deacons in the front cab of the truck, and as they get closer, it's a little, you can tell something's not right, because you can see the whites of their eyeballs at about 50 yards, and they get out of the truck, and this is where it kind of went from funny to like really sad, and the guy looks at the bin, and we say, hey, guys, we just started early, good to see you here, and the guy's looking at the table.
[time=1420] He says, what happened to the table, and I said, well, we just told him what we did, come to find out that guy's grandfather made the table.
[time=1430] Almost a great grandfather made the table almost 100 years prior, it had been at the foot of that aisle for 40 years.
[time=1438] [laughter] Man, that table, he says, yeah, that table.
[time=1445] And I've always seen myself as progressive, and I've always seen myself as quick to seize the opportunity, sometimes, and maybe I'm speaking for some of you, sometimes it's gotten me to trouble.
[time=1457] Sometimes I've had to, gods had to, through situations where people were hurt.
[time=1462] That guy was, that guy and his wife and his whole family, they were hurt by my impetuousness and my immaturity and my quickness, but I've always seen myself as ready to roll, especially, especially in the area of music, as it relates to praise and worship.
[time=1481] Push the envelope, innovate, try new stuff, has always been my cry, then, then last summer.
[time=1488] Not this past one, but a year, a year ago.
[time=1492] Then, I went to camp.
[time=1496] And I went to a camp that I've often gone to over the years, I speak there every couple of years, a good friend of mine from school runs the camp, and he had asked me to speak to over 400 high school and college students.
[time=1506] For a week, it was a great opportunity, it's a great camp, but my visit this past year, in comparison to previous years, as I got there, and as we got into the week, and as we came to the first meeting time, that first night, they'd have you speak, the meeting started at 1030 at night, every night, it was a lot of fun, and you'd get there, huge amphitheater, and when I got to that first night, I realized something had changed, and what it changed was the style of worship.
[time=1533] And I'm telling you, I saw some things, and I listened to some things, and I experienced some things, they're sitting in the back row of this deal, 400 kids going absolutely out of their minds in worship.
[time=1544] The music was so loud.
[time=1547] Okay, this is me talking. The music.
[time=1550] I'm the guy who, I miss five calls on my cell phone in the truck, 'cause the music's so loud, I don't even hear the phone ring.
[time=1556] I mean, I like loud music, and it was so loud, it was offensive to me.
[time=1561] That was the word I used, did you hear that word?
[time=1563] It was offensive to me.
[time=1565] I watched them, you know, a hundred at a time, would get down in the, around the fire circle, and as the worship band led these songs, and as the kids sang, some would begin to dance, and they would bump up against each other, and they would laugh, and they would raise their hands, and they were singing, and they were shouting, and in my mind, as I watched that, it was just too much.
[time=1587] A line had been crossed.
[time=1590] As I said in my back row, with my Bible ready to teach, this was inappropriate.
[time=1598] I determined.
[time=1600] Pushed me too far, couldn't hear the words, couldn't follow the music, didn't know what they were singing, screaming, and laughing, and dancing, and hands up, and it's ridiculous.
[time=1615] And I went through that whole week, with pretty much, by and large, a bad attitude.
[time=1621] As it would relate, a couple of nights I went late.
[time=1626] Sound familiar?
[time=1627] A couple of nights I went late to avoid the...
[time=1632] Yeah, it just bugged me.
[time=1634] So there I was Saturday, whole week's gone by.
[time=1636] I've done my best to just do what he asked me to do, and God and his mercy used it, and some great things happened that last night, and Saturday morning we're getting ready to leave, and I'm sitting up with a cafeteria, and there's this kid sitting on a stump, waiting for his ride, and I walk up to him.
[time=1651] He says, "Hey, thanks so much for the week." I said, "You're bad, man. What's going on with you?
[time=1655] How was your week?" Oh, he says, "I don't have enough time to tell you." And he began to chronicle for me, in a conversation there next to the cafeteria, how God had changed his life that week.
[time=1668] And he talked about the recreation, and he talked about a little bit of the teaching, and he talked about the counselors and the investment they had made, and then he said this, and I quote, "You know, the worship, the worship changed my life."
[time=1684] I said, "What do you mean?" Because in my mind I'm thinking, "You've got to be kidding me.
[time=1688] I'm happy you survived this week." He says this, he said, "The words to the songs." Kelly painted a picture of Jesus in forgiveness, I've never understood, and then he looked at me with tears walling up in his eyes, and he says, "I gave my life to him last night." And he paused, and then he said, "In a way that kind of signified I was supposed to get it." He said, "All of it." And I said, "All of it." He goes, "Yeah, all of it." "Do you get it?" And I said, "Well, yeah, that's good you gave him all your life, right?" And he said, "No, no, no, no, all of it.
[time=1727] The song." I said, "I'm sorry you lost me." He goes, "Where were you?" He said, "Every night this week, the band would close their session with a worship song called All of It." And in the song it invited students to give their hearts to Jesus, all of them.
[time=1745] And that song had tugged at his heart the whole week, and through the Word of God and the people of God and the Spirit of God, that last night he gave all of his life to Jesus Christ.
[time=1757] I realized at that moment as we talked that I had come full circle.
[time=1761] For years I had been asking, begging those older than me and those that simply had a different preference to be not just flexible with change, but excited about the new sounds and styles because, as I would say, with the new sounds and the higher volume and the progressive style come new faces, a new generation desperately in need, many of them of the one thing that will never change, and that's the truth.
[time=1787] And now sitting there at camp with a 16-year-old, 12 hours old in his new faith, my own words had come back to bring conviction and correction to an attitude.
[time=1798] Watch this, to an attitude that almost missed what God was doing.
[time=1806] To an attitude in a heart and a perspective that was so stuck, it almost missed what God was doing.
[time=1815] And my hope is, and my prayer is, that never again will we, you or I, any of us in this room, any of us in this family, hear at Black Hawk, that never again will we due to preference or age, ever come close to missing God at work.
[time=1832] And people to sad and tragic truth is that all over our country today, all over evangelical America, the church is missing what God's doing.
[time=1843] They are missing God at work because of their staunch and stern commitment to lines that they've drawn and parameters that they've set, and not lines that He has set, and not parameters that He has established.
[time=1860] So needless to say, I have found it helpful and very, very encouraging to look again and again to the Word of God for guidance as it relates to the component of worship we call praise.
[time=1874] The 30 minutes, the 30 or 40 minutes of music, singing, drama, and the arts, Wednesday night here at Common Ground or Sunday mornings as we gather, that leads into the component of worship we call teaching.
[time=1890] And here are some questions that you've got to write down this morning.
[time=1893] Here are some challenges that you've got to be, I hope, are willing to face with me as we go down this road.
[time=1899] What must we be mindful of as we look at this?
[time=1902] What truths have to be wrestled with?
[time=1905] How are we as a fully surrendered family here at Black Hawk?
[time=1909] How are we supposed to approach this issue of music and worship and praise and the 5,000 adjacent issues that come with it?
[time=1920] What's going to be our guide?
[time=1922] How are we going to proceed?
[time=1924] Well, let's look at three things today.
[time=1926] And you know what?
[time=1927] We're not going to get through all three things today.
[time=1929] We're going to go ahead and just do our best to get as far as we can, and then next week we'll finish it up.
[time=1934] Fully surrendered church as it relates to praise.
[time=1937] This morning we jump in with three things.
[time=1940] Three things to consider as we go down this road trying to navigate and understand as best we can.
[time=1946] God's heart and God's design and God's intention for this thing called praise.
[time=1950] Number one, let's start with this.
[time=1953] The why behind praise.
[time=1956] You got that down?
[time=1957] The why behind praise.
[time=1961] Ask yourself this question or write it down quickly.
[time=1963] Why?
[time=1964] Why offer praise?
[time=1969] Why is it that we come in through these doors?
[time=1971] Why is it that we're encouraged to as the week progresses?
[time=1975] Why offer praise?
[time=1977] Why offer to him in song or through the arts in some form or fashion?
[time=1982] Why offer him thanks and adoration?
[time=1986] Why do it?
[time=1988] Well, number one, write this down because he's God, people.
[time=1992] Because he's God.
[time=1996] And you're not.
[time=1998] You and I, we aren't.
[time=2000] We're so far from it.
[time=2001] It's not even funny.
[time=2002] We offer praise.
[time=2003] We offer thanks and adoration.
[time=2005] You guys, because he's God.
[time=2006] And write this down too, please.
[time=2008] Because he's God and we're coming into his, what?
[time=2011] Presence.
[time=2013] We offer praise because he's God.
[time=2015] Number one, he's God and we're coming into his presence.
[time=2019] Look at how Isaiah said it back in Isaiah chapter six.
[time=2023] Isaiah, the prophet, finds himself coming into the very presence of God.
[time=2028] And it says there, it's a classic text that paints a wonderful picture.
[time=2034] It says there in Isaiah chapter six.
[time=2036] Starting there in verse one, it says, In the year of King Uzziah's death, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne lofty and exalted and the train of his robe filling the temple.
[time=2047] Seraphim.
[time=2049] You guy kids, if you're listening to this morning, Seraphim are angels, a special kind of angel that God the Father created to serve a certain purpose.
[time=2059] And here we see what their purpose was.
[time=2061] It says, Seraphim stood above him, each having six wings, with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.
[time=2071] And one called out to another and said, Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord of hosts.
[time=2078] The whole earth is full of his glory.
[time=2081] And at that time it says there in verse four, and the foundations of the thresholds trembled at the voice of him who called out, while the temple was filling with smoke, and then Isaiah said, whoa, whoa, whoa, is me.
[time=2097] Isaiah right there in that moment had a very clear picture of who God is and who he is.
[time=2104] And his response was classic, he says, whoa is me, for I am ruined.
[time=2111] I am ruined because I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among the people of unclean lips.
[time=2117] For my eyes have seen the king, he says, the Lord of hosts.
[time=2125] Wow, without such a vision, listen, without such a vision of God's holiness, true praise is impossible.
[time=2135] True genuine praise doesn't happen.
[time=2137] Praise is not giddy.
[time=2139] It does not rush into God's presence unprepared and insensitive to His majesty.
[time=2144] It's not shallow, superficial, or flipping.
[time=2147] Praise is offered in the presence of an infinitely righteous and on the present God by one utterly aware of His holiness, God's, and consequently overwhelmed with His own lack of.
[time=2163] You and I may not have a vision of God like Isaiah's, but nonetheless the lesson is true.
[time=2169] That when we enter, that when we enter into the presence of God, which is what we try to do each and every week, we come into this place.
[time=2178] This is a great chance in some respects.
[time=2181] You know it's a great chance to be together.
[time=2183] It's a great chance to say hi.
[time=2185] It's a great opportunity to extend the hand.
[time=2187] We get to catch up, find out how you're doing, figure out what's going on with you.
[time=2191] And it's a wonderful time of fellowship and community, but you know what?
[time=2195] It's also a very serious endeavor because we come into this place hoping, praying that we might be able to enjoy, learn from, and bask in the presence of God.
[time=2209] And that's a serious thing.
[time=2213] And our sense, your sense in mind, of sinfulness and appropriate fear
[time=2219] is proportionate to our experience of His presence.
[time=2223] And if you have never praised God with a truly and sincere, broken and contrite heart, you have never praised God.
[time=2233] Because that really is the only appropriate response to entering the presence of one like Him.
[time=2241] Why? Behind praise?
[time=2243] First of all, get it down because He's God.
[time=2247] And we come into His presence.
[time=2251] And He calls us to come into His presence with an appropriate perspective.
[time=2256] Second thing I want you to write down here underneath the "why" behind praise.
[time=2261] And one of the kids said it, bless her heart.
[time=2263] She was right on target.
[time=2264] She said because He created us to praise.
[time=2267] Would you write that down?
[time=2268] He created us to praise.
[time=2270] And we're going to fly through some passages here.
[time=2273] I want to just give you a sense for this, okay?
[time=2275] I want you to read.
[time=2276] They're going to come onto the screen.
[time=2278] I want you to read every word.
[time=2279] I want you to take in every nugget and kernel of truth.
[time=2282] I want you to see in just these three or four or five passages, some of what God's word has to say when He talks about the fact that He created us to praise Him.
[time=2294] Psalm 100.
[time=2296] It says in Psalm 100, in verse two, on through verse three, it says, "Come before Him with joyful singing." Right?
[time=2306] Doesn't have to be perfect singing.
[time=2308] Doesn't have to be on pitch singing.
[time=2310] Doesn't have to be classically trained or contemporary singing.
[time=2315] No.
[time=2316] He just says, "Come before Him with joyful singing.
[time=2321] Know that the Lord Himself is God.
[time=2323] It is He who has made us, and not we ourselves.
[time=2326] We are His people and the sheep of His pasture." After Psalm 100, you'll see Romans 11.
[time=2334] And there in Paul's letter to the church at Rome, he says, "For from Him, and through Him, and to Him, are all thanks to Him be the glory forever."
[time=2347] [AMEN] "For from Him, and through Him, and to Him are all thanks to Him be the glory forever." Revelation chapter four may sound familiar to you.
[time=2360] Look what it says there.
[time=2361] Revelation chapter four, verse 11, "Worthy are thou O Lord, and our God, to receive glory, and honor, and power, for thou didst create all things.
[time=2374] And because of thy will, they existed, and were created." There you see, he creates Him.
[time=2381] Psalm 100 said the same thing.
[time=2383] He creates all things to bring glory to Him.
[time=2387] 1 Peter 2.
[time=2388] Write this one down as well.
[time=2390] 1 Peter 2, verses 9 and 10.
[time=2393] Peter here writes this.
[time=2394] He says, "But you," and he speaks as he says, "You," he speaks to anybody here who knows him.
[time=2400] He speaks to the body of Christ.
[time=2402] He speaks to the church, and he says, "But you, you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light." Then it goes on in verse 10 to say, "For you, you once were not a people, but now you are the people of God.
[time=2429] You had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy." Do you see that?
[time=2435] He called us.
[time=2436] You guys, he called us.
[time=2439] He chose us.
[time=2440] He brought us out of darkness to praise everything good and right and true about Him.
[time=2449] So don't miss what we just said there.
[time=2451] And again, I just, I keep going back because I just want you to, I want you to write it down.
[time=2454] I want you to think about it.
[time=2455] I want you to dwell on it.
[time=2456] I want you to consider it in the coming days.
[time=2458] The why behind praise?
[time=2460] Number one, his attributes demand it.
[time=2464] He's God.
[time=2465] And because He is all that He is as God, His attributes, just Him being demands our response.
[time=2472] And so He says, "Praise Me." His attributes demand it.
[time=2477] And the second thing we saw there in all those verses we just looked at.
[time=2480] The second thing is His purpose in creating and His purpose in saving us.
[time=2489] His purpose in both calls for a response of praise.
[time=2497] And we could go on, but that's good for now.
[time=2499] The why, the why behind praise.
[time=2502] Let's look at the way.
[time=2504] Here we go.
[time=2505] Let's look at the way we praise.
[time=2507] The way we praise.
[time=2510] Now, according to, and I'm just going to rattle off some passages here.
[time=2513] I'm going to rattle off some chapters.
[time=2515] If you want to get these afterwards, I'd be happy to give them to you.
[time=2517] But I just want to rattle them off because I want you to get a sense.
[time=2520] I'm not wanting you to get every chapter down, but just listen.
[time=2524] And this is not all conclusive.
[time=2526] I could have gone on for pages, all right?
[time=2529] According to Psalm 35, Psalm 66, Psalm 33.
[time=2534] According to 2 Samuel 6, Psalm 68, 84, 71, 57, 62, and 95,
[time=2541] along with 1 Timothy 2.
[time=2543] According to, and I want you to read this with me.
[time=2546] I want you to see it as I read it.
[time=2548] According to these scriptures, according to those I just told you there, I praise him when I shout and sing with joy, dance, clap, play instruments,
[time=2561] pray, lift my hands, give testimony, proclaim His goodness, stand in silence, weep with gratitude, and kneel in reverence.
[time=2570] All of it in response to the truth and only the truth.
[time=2575] One more time.
[time=2576] As you look at those passages in God's Word, read it again.
[time=2580] As you look at those passages in God's Word, as you see His design laid out for us.
[time=2585] According to the scriptures, I praise Him when I shout and sing with joy, dance, clap, play instruments, pray, lift my hands, give testimony, proclaim His goodness, stand in silence, weep with gratitude, and kneel in reverence.
[time=2600] All of it in response to the truth.
[time=2607] Probably the best way to say it from a biblical perspective is that He calls us to worship Him people.
[time=2614] He calls us to offer praise, and Marty prayed this earlier, in spirit and in truth.
[time=2622] It's a big theme.
[time=2624] It's a key principle.
[time=2627] That phrase right there is a major truth for us to consider this morning and again next week.
[time=2634] You guys, He has called us to offer praise to Him.
[time=2638] Kids, He has called you students, parents, adults.
[time=2643] He has called us as His children to offer Him praise, and it is to be in spirit and in truth.
[time=2653] Now, where does that come from?
[time=2655] Some of you know the answer to that.
[time=2656] It comes from John 4, and you can write that down too.
[time=2659] Because you see in John 4, Jesus said to the physically and spiritually thirsty woman at the well that true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth.
[time=2671] Look real quick, this won't come up on the screen, I don't think, but just look with me at John 4.
[time=2676] Go to John 4 verse 19.
[time=2683] John 4, it's a great interchange.
[time=2686] You're going on between the Samaritan woman and Jesus, this Jew, an interchange that wouldn't typically have happened because of the relationship between the Samaritans and the Jews, but Jesus and His redemptive heart reaches out to this woman who's in desperate need of water.
[time=2703] She comes to a well for physical water, but he knows she's in need of a spiritual water that will quench her thirst forever.
[time=2710] And he enters into this dialogue with her and then she begins to ask questions and it says there in John 4, 19, are you there?
[time=2717] It says the woman said to him, "Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet."
[time=2724] And so she continues, "You know, our fathers worshiped in this mountain." And she was referring to a place called Gerism, Mount Gerism.
[time=2733] "Our fathers, Samaritans, worshiped in this mountain, and you people, the Jews, say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship." See what's going on there? She's hung up on location.
[time=2748] She's completely missed the boat on the whole worship concept.
[time=2752] And Jesus is about to help her in an amazing way.
[time=2756] She's hung up on location. She was kind of old school and had temple issues.
[time=2760] She wanted to know as many in this room this morning have wanted to know in the past.
[time=2765] I've wanted to know, you've asked the questions, I've asked the questions, we see it all through modern Christian literature.
[time=2773] It's everywhere you look, churches are being divided over it.
[time=2776] She asks the question in essence, what is right?
[time=2780] Who is right? Are they right or are they right?
[time=2785] The Jews at the temple in Jerusalem, or the Samaritans, worshiping in a better way at their temple in Mount Gerism.
[time=2792] And look at John 4, 21.
[time=2795] Jesus cuts right to it and he says they're woman.
[time=2799] "Woman, believe me," he says, "an hour is coming, when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem shall you worship the Father."
[time=2809] Well, where then? Where then?
[time=2814] They'd been talking about water that truly satisfies.
[time=2818] And he in essence says to this thirsty seeker, "The water I'm about to give you, the new life you'll find in me, it will cleanse and make new, you're once dirty and hardened," what?
[time=2831] Say it, heart, heart.
[time=2834] Jesus says you want a temple?
[time=2838] You want a place to worship, I'll give you one.
[time=2840] You want a place to go, I'll give it to you.
[time=2842] It's not Jerusalem and it's not Gerism.
[time=2845] It says in 1 Corinthians 6, 19, or did you not know that your body was a, what? Temple of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2853] You see folks in God's new plan worked out through the person of Christ.
[time=2858] He says to this woman and he says to you what we've been saying for three weeks and that is you want to really worship God, you want to get it right, then you worship Him from a fully surrendered, completely in all heart.
[time=2873] Does everything it can to understand and see Him for what He is and for who He is?
[time=2878] Never losing sight of that, giving praise and service and worship as an act of honor and adoration.
[time=2887] That which flows out of a surrendered heart will be according to Jesus and will look at this in spirit and in truth, emotional and cognitive, subjective and objective, expressive and sound in its doctrine.
[time=2903] According to God's word, it will be in spirit and in truth.
[time=2908] Now look closely or I should say just try and understand better what was going on with this woman at the well because you know what?
[time=2916] We're going to end with this.
[time=2918] What was going on with this woman people at the well?
[time=2921] The questions that she is asking are the very questions we have to wrestle with today.
[time=2927] These are the issues that we have got to roll up our sleeves on and understand as best we can so as to stay together and to stay harmonized and unified in our effort to put aside things that don't matter and stay focused on that which truly makes a difference.
[time=2943] Genuine, sincere, God-honoring praise.
[time=2948] Now the woman at the well was looking for the proper method of worship, but she saw only two extremes, the Samaritans and the Jews.
[time=2956] Jesus begins to set her straight by informing her that both ways of worship needed the balance of the other.
[time=2963] Little history for you, okay?
[time=2964] Listen, the Samaritan, let's talk about the Samaritans for a second.
[time=2967] The Samaritan style of worship was done in ignorance, if you will.
[time=2973] You see, the Samaritan's spiritual knowledge was limited because they had rejected almost the entire Old Testament except for the Pentateuch, those first five books.
[time=2982] Their religion, their faith, the Samaritan faith was characterized by enthusiastic worship.
[time=2989] But they lacked the proper information.
[time=2993] They lacked the proper foundation in spiritual data and truth.
[time=2998] They worshiped in spirit, but not in truth.
[time=3001] Now the Jews, theirs was the opposite situation, okay?
[time=3006] They accepted all the books of the Old Testament.
[time=3008] They had the truth, but they lacked the spirit.
[time=3012] When the Pharisees prayed or gave alms or fasted, their hearts weren't in it.
[time=3017] Jesus called them many times.
[time=3019] Hippocrates, phonies, whitewash tombs full of dead men's bones.
[time=3023] In Mark 7, he said, "Told the Pharisees and the scribes rightly did Isaiah prophesy against you when he said, 'You honor me with your lips, but your hearts are far, far from me.'"
[time=3038] The worship that occurred, watch this.
[time=3040] The worship that occurred on Mount Gerasim was enthusiastic heresy.
[time=3047] The worship offered at Jerusalem was barren, arms folded, lifeless orthodoxy.
[time=3055] Jerusalem had the truth, but not the spirit.
[time=3059] Gerasim had the spirit, but not the truth.
[time=3063] And as you look at that, I want you to realize this morning as we close.
[time=3068] I want you to take this with you this week and give some thought to it.
[time=3071] People, real, genuine, praise, has two enemies.
[time=3078] And they're awful.
[time=3080] They're detrimental.
[time=3082] They're posed to God's truth.
[time=3084] And they were with that woman and our Lord in that day.
[time=3088] And the two enemies of praise remain with us today.
[time=3091] Two enemies of praise.
[time=3093] Their names, Gerasim and Jerusalem.
[time=3100] Sincerity, enthusiasm, and aggressive expression are important,
[time=3106] but they must be based on truth.
[time=3109] And truth is foundational, but if it doesn't result in an eager, excited, enthusiastic heart, it is deficient.
[time=3118] The president of the seminary, where I studied and where I eventually graduated from, would always say it like this, enthusiastic heresy is heat without light.
[time=3131] Enthusiastic heresy is heat without light, barren orthodoxy is light without what?
[time=3137] Heat.
[time=3139] And the two extremes exist even today, at times, at times rearing their ugly heads right here in our own family.
[time=3147] Some one expression, passion, and zeal, guided by feelings only, while on the other hand, there are those of us who hold firmly to sound doctrine.
[time=3156] We want sound doctrine, but have lost our spirit of sincere enthusiasm.
[time=3163] We know the truth, but won't get excited about it.
[time=3169] It boggles my mind sometimes.
[time=3171] When I even consider my own approach to worship.
[time=3176] Thanks, by the way, for this, my friend.
[time=3178] It turned out pretty good.
[time=3181] I'll just close with this and we're going to sing a song and leave.
[time=3184] It really boggles my, in fact, you folks come on up and we'll get ready to sing.
[time=3188] It boggles my mind when I think about this.
[time=3191] And I'm not slapping you on the wrist, okay?
[time=3194] I mean, if I'm slapping anybody, it's me.
[time=3196] But it's just, I think it's worth thinking about.
[time=3199] I see you, I watch you, and you watch me.
[time=3206] We live life together here.
[time=3208] And many of you, I see you at baseball games.
[time=3213] I see you at basketball games.
[time=3216] I see you on the golf course.
[time=3218] I see you at gymnastics.
[time=3220] I mean, I see us in the everyday of life, in situations where there are things that we've got kids involved in
[time=3228] or that we're involved in.
[time=3229] And you know what?
[time=3230] Things happen and something really cool takes place.
[time=3233] And we get excited.
[time=3236] We get excited about a ball going in the net.
[time=3240] We get thrilled over a shot that gets made.
[time=3243] We lift our hands and we raise our voices and we, hoo hoo hoo.
[time=3250] Over a worthless piece of nothing.
[time=3253] A game.
[time=3256] And yet we come into this place sometimes and I wonder where did it go?
[time=3262] And I'm not, please hear me, I'm not trying to draw attention to necessarily the externals.
[time=3268] I'm talking about a passion.
[time=3271] A passion in your hearts and you can see it in somebody's eyes when their soul is ignited for God.
[time=3279] And if I can get excited about a 290 yard drive, you know what?
[time=3284] I should be off the chart in my heart because he loved me and he saved me and he pursued
[time=3292] me and he stays faithful to me.
[time=3295] And so to whatever degree you and I need to think those things through.
[time=3299] I believe he wants us to come into this place and share with him based on truth and excited,
[time=3307] genuine, passionate sense of our love for him.
[time=3310] Let's sing this last song and Willie, thank you so much for being here.
[time=3315] Let's sing and then we'll go home.
[time=3324] You are awesome in this place, I do love.
[time=3333] You are awesome in this place, I'm a father.
[time=3341] You are worthy of our praise to you, our lives be raised.
[time=3349] You are awesome in this place, I do love.
[time=3365] You are awesome in this place, I'm a father.
[time=3374] You are worthy of our praise to you, our lives be raised.
[time=3382] You are awesome in this place, I do love.
[time=3390] You are worthy of our praise to you, our lives be raised.
[time=3398] You are awesome in this place, I do love.
[time=3425] Hey, do everything you can to be with us next week.
[time=3428] As we jump back into this discussion and take a real close look at what it means to worship him, to praise him in spirit and in truth, we'll look at both very carefully.
[time=3438] Come back tonight, please, every one of you, they call this place home, it's something we need to do and do together that is remember the sacrifice of our Lord and to celebrate with those here at our church and even those from the love church.
[time=3455] Our dear friends down there, Phil and Fran Mortensen are coming with their family and they're going to join us, so please come back tonight at 6 and we'll look forward to being together then.
[time=3464] As we leave, please, our prayer is that you're spirit and you're word in ways that only your spirit and word can.
[time=3473] Would stay with us as the week progresses, God, that we would keep our hearts open to the truth that we have looked at and considered this morning and that it would teach us and grow us into a people who better understand and better know what it means to truly and sincerely from our hearts,
[time=3491] give ourselves to you in worship and praise.
[time=3495] God, we want to be pleasing. Help us learn what that means.
[time=3499] All the people agreed and said, amen.
[time=3521] [MUSIC]
