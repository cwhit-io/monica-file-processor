[time=40] [MUSIC] When so many voices surround me [MUSIC]
[time=53] [MUSIC - 372 seconds]
[time=438] Father, the song reminds us of how much you desire and how much you long to spend those times and these times with us.
[time=448] You long for us to come to you on our knees and humble reverence ready and willing to share with you the desires of our heart ready and willing to open our hearts in life to that which you would have and that is our prayer this morning, God.
[time=464] That as we look at a fully surrendered walk, as we take one more look at this idea of worship and how it is to impact all that we are and all that we do.
[time=475] God, we pray that your spirit would reveal in us the things that need to be revealed.
[time=479] God, answer questions that need to be answered.
[time=482] God, raise issues that need to be raised and allow this time to be a time where your word does what only it can do.
[time=490] From the hearts of the lives of those who would listen and we ask your son's name, amen.
[time=498] A fully surrendered walk, it has been said that possibly the single greatest asset, the single greatest tool in the scope of God working out his plan among mankind as when he has at his disposal a fully surrendered life.
[time=518] A heart, a heart completely and totally devoted to him.
[time=523] An individual like you or me so completely surrendered, they're ready to live as we said four weeks ago, ready to live on Thursday.
[time=533] The songs they sang on Sunday, and one of the often used phrases in the New Testament used in reference to the living out of the Christian life is the word of the phrase called walk.
[time=548] We see it in many places in the New Testament, our walk Romans 6 chapter 4, Romans 6 chapter 4 says this, therefore we have been buried with him through baptism into death in order that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father so we too might walk.
[time=569] There's that word walk in newness of life, Ephesians 5, Ephesians 5 1 and 2 says this, it says in Ephesians 5 chapter 5 verse 1, therefore be imitators.
[time=585] Therefore be imitators of God as beloved children and walk it says, there it is walk in love just as Christ also loved you and gave himself up for us an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma and look with me back just one chapter before that.
[time=604] Look at what Paul said to that same church there at Ephesus, one chapter earlier in Ephesians 4 verse 1, you see it there it says I therefore, I therefore the prisoner of the Lord entreat you that word in the Greek means to beg.
[time=619] Paul says to the Ephesians I beg you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called.
[time=630] Write it down this morning please, write it down, a fully surrendered walk is equal to a worthy walk.
[time=638] Well look at that briefly here, a fully surrendered walk is equal to a worthy walk, Ephesians 4 1 says we are to walk worthy.
[time=647] Well what does that mean, the word worthy, the word worthy in the original language means that what's on the one side, it's a term that was used with reference to a scale, it was about weights and measures.
[time=660] And the word worthy in the original language means that what is on the one side is equal to or consistent with that which is on the other, it means they balance each other out, what's on this side is equal to what's on this side, worthy.
[time=678] The word walk, the word walk in the New Testament you guys it's simple and you can write it down if you need to but it's real basic wherever you see the word walk in the New Testament it's referring to your daily life.
[time=694] Day by day living, day by day choices, day by day speech, day by day activity.
[time=704] Our walk is to be worthy, our walk is to be worthy, it's when my daily living corresponds or is equal to my spiritual position.
[time=718] To get that, it's when my, it's when my saying it, it's when my saying it is equal to my living it.
[time=728] It's when my profession of faith is lived out in the everyday of my life, it's when my private life matches my public one.
[time=737] Think about that, it's when your private life, that part of your life that you live and I live when no one's watching, when no one's observing, when it's just you and who.
[time=756] It's when your private life matches or is equal to your public life, that's a worthy walk.
[time=767] It's when I'm as surrendered to him on Friday and Saturday nights as I am on Sunday mornings or Wednesday nights.
[time=776] It's when my commitment to Christ is authentic and real, honest and straightforward.
[time=786] And this morning I would submit to every one of you here today that our walks, our daily lives can be and should be full of worship, full of worship.
[time=797] We defined worship four weeks ago as this, it's when you and I give honor and adoration to God and I would submit to you this morning again that our walks, our daily living, daily choices, daily endeavors should be full of adoration and honor directed to God.
[time=816] We should be in constant pursuit of a fully surrendered walk, seven days a week at home, at work, with family, with friends and when we are alone.
[time=829] Now, what will that walk, your walk in mind, what will that look like?
[time=834] I mean, if we were to really be engaged in that kind of pursuit, what would that look like in the everyday of our lives?
[time=841] Well, let's say it this way and we'll use this as kind of our jumping off point for the rest of our morning.
[time=847] We'll just kind of say this again and again, worshipful living, daily life, worshipful living can only take place when our walk is fully surrendered to.
[time=860] And I want us this morning to be willing to look at these five things, could have picked 10, could have picked 20.
[time=866] These five seem to just as I look through the scriptures, jump out at me as things that I know I need some help with respect to.
[time=875] These five things were five things I would have chosen as I graded myself out on these things.
[time=881] I realized there was a whole bunch of stuff about these five that my own personal life needs some help with.
[time=888] I need some strength, I need some reminders, I need some direction.
[time=892] And so I chose them for you, five things.
[time=896] Worshipful living can only take place when our walk is surrendered to unity, confession, unwavering faith, contentment, and redemptive living.
[time=911] Those five things this morning as we look at a fully surrendered walk, the everyday of your life and mine.
[time=919] Let's jump in number one, worshipful living can only take place when our walk is fully surrendered to this thing the New Testament calls unity.
[time=929] Unity within the body of Christ, unity, something that you and I contribute to or take away from in the way we conduct ourselves and carry ourselves within this family.
[time=941] Unity, look back in Ephesians 4, we were in verse 1, that passage continues, we'll go back and read 1 again.
[time=949] Look at what it says, Paul says, "I beg you, I therefore the prisoner of the Lord entreat you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called."
[time=958] Well, what does that look like, Paul? He goes on, verse 2, "With all humility," watch this, "with all humility and gentleness with patience showing forbearance to one another in love being diligent."
[time=972] Word in the Greek means to the point of physical exhaustion, being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
[time=984] This passage right there tells you and it tells me that humility, gentleness, patience and forbearance, the ultimate outcome of the above mentioned traits lived out individually in the church.
[time=998] Those things lived out individually by you and me brings corporate or family unity.
[time=1005] When you're willing day in and day out, as you deal with me and as I deal with you and as our paths cross,
[time=1012] either in person or on the phone or in ministry, however it might cross, and whether our paths cross directly or indirectly, whether you bump into me or you hear about me.
[time=1026] Unity is when with humility and gentleness and patience and forbearance you give yourself to those things and as you give yourself to those things and I give myself to those things as a family, what's produced is this diligent effort toward unity, harmony.
[time=1045] You and I stopping at nothing. Did you hear that? You and I stopping at absolutely nothing to maintain a healthy and genuine love for each other is a God honoring act of worship.
[time=1059] We worship Him when with diligence we pursue harmony in our relationships.
[time=1065] We worship Him when we extend kindness, when we extend compassion to each other.
[time=1072] Let me just say this, just a reminder to you, many of you don't need to be reminded of this.
[time=1079] I think most of you watch and see, most of you are in touch with what goes on in our world today.
[time=1086] I'll just say it just to make the point, we live in a world.
[time=1090] We live in a world today and from the Palestinians and the Jews to broken families and lost friendships, you see it, I see it all the time.
[time=1100] We live in a world today people that will not get along.
[time=1105] It's not going to happen.
[time=1109] There is no harmony and evil.
[time=1112] We live in a world today that will not get along.
[time=1117] Disputes, factions, divisions and turmoil are everywhere and the one hope, the one hope they have,
[time=1128] the one and only hope there is to push back the darkness and bring life-giving truth as a harmonized, unified church period.
[time=1139] The one hope that a lost and dying world has, a world that will not get along,
[time=1145] the one hope they have is to bump into a thing called the church, who with all of its unity and with all of its harmony and with all of its love and kindness and compassion,
[time=1156] that they extend to each other, kind of rises up on a hill for those searching to look at and say,
[time=1162] wow, finally a place that gets along.
[time=1167] A place that really cares.
[time=1169] A place full of people bending over backwards to do everything they can to love, support and encourage each other.
[time=1178] That is the task God's word calls you to and me to, young and old, new believer, veteran believer,
[time=1185] radically and deeply committed to each other, a church that Philippians 2, 3 and 4 is each other to death.
[time=1192] Go ahead and turn there. I don't think it will be on the screen for you.
[time=1195] A church, a church full of people, just like you, that Philippians 2, 3 and 4 is each other to death.
[time=1206] Hey kids, make sure you turn to this one.
[time=1209] Those of you on the younger side that are with us today, you've got to look at this, along with us older folks.
[time=1216] We have got to be a church full of kids, full of students, as well as adults that Philippians 2, 3 and 4 is each other to death.
[time=1225] When we're here and even when we're home.
[time=1231] Philippians 2, verse 3 says this, "Do nothing, do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind.
[time=1245] Let each of you regard one another as more important than himself.
[time=1250] Do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others."
[time=1258] Do you see that? Do absolutely nothing.
[time=1263] Don't speak, don't act, don't do, don't go, do absolutely nothing, he says.
[time=1271] From selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind, seeing yourself as God sees you, seeing yourself as you should see yourself.
[time=1282] Regard each other as more important than himself, kids.
[time=1287] Hey kids, young people, let me ask you this, and I'm asking my kids this too, okay? Parents, all you kids.
[time=1298] You listening? Kids, let me ask you this, 4th graders, 5th graders, middle schoolers.
[time=1309] Does this describe your parents?
[time=1321] Does this describe the way you see us living our lives with each other, with our friends at church, with people on the block?
[time=1332] Don't answer out loud, but I'm asking you kids to think about that.
[time=1335] And I'm asking you parents to understand why I'm asking, because I've got to ask my kids and you've got to ask your kids.
[time=1343] Because if they're ever going to learn what it really means to do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, a faulty picture of ourselves, if they're ever going to learn it, you know what?
[time=1354] It's not going to be from watching television today.
[time=1360] It's not going to be because of what they read today, it's not going to be because of what they hear today, it's not going to happen.
[time=1367] Selflessness and service and bending over backwards to extend compassion and kindness in our world, in this culture, will be learned from adults who take the time and are willing to model and live out and communicate and back that communication up with a life
[time=1388] that evidence is that kind of living.
[time=1393] So the kids are going to keep watching, and the kids are going to keep seeing.
[time=1398] And so my question for you, moms and dads, aunts and uncles, adult friends of, you know, kids, all of us, what's being modeled, Philippians 2, 3 and 4.
[time=1411] It's got to be the picture.
[time=1413] Second thing today, worshipful living takes place when our walk is surrendered to confession, write it down, confession.
[time=1422] It says in 1 John 1, 9, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness, if and when we confess our sins."
[time=1438] Someone asked me a few weeks ago, "Did not our sins get taken care of on the cross?" Yes.
[time=1444] All of them, past, present and future, got covered on the cross, and yet God's word calls you and me to each and every time.
[time=1452] Bring the sins and the choices and the violations of our life to Him.
[time=1457] And to articulate that and to confess that, watch this, the word confess there in 1 John 1, 9, and the Greek means this, I love this definition.
[time=1465] The word confess means to express in full agreement.
[time=1471] And if you've dealt with a 7-year-old or an 8-year-old lately, you know how important that is?
[time=1479] To confess with full agreement, if you've dealt with a 28-year-old or a 30 or 40-year-old lately, you know how important that is.
[time=1492] It means this, it means to, as you articulate the confession, it means to agree fully with God, and I want you to get these three things down.
[time=1499] It means to agree fully with God about my sin, about your sin, that it is, in fact, sin.
[time=1509] It means to agree with God fully about my sin, my responsibility for the sin.
[time=1518] Meaning it wasn't His fault, and it wasn't Her fault, and it wasn't Circumstances fault, no, it was Whose fault.
[time=1525] My, to agree with God fully, number one, about the sin, you got that?
[time=1530] Number two, my responsibility for the sin.
[time=1534] And thirdly, here you go, this is where it gets really personal, this is where it gets really challenging sometimes, but you know what?
[time=1539] This is where it can get really healthy, too.
[time=1543] About my sin, my responsibility for my sin, and thirdly, the ugliness, agreeing with God about the ugliness, the destruction, the pain that my sin has caused.
[time=1559] Did you get those down? I did it, I did it, agreeing with God fully about my sin, I did it, and I chose it.
[time=1572] It wasn't His fault or Her fault, I chose it, and look at what it did.
[time=1581] You know in my own life, where I most often sense and face the challenge of that, that last one especially, coming face to face with, agreeing with God about the ugliness and the pain and the destruction it's caused?
[time=1598] I sometimes wish my wife, when we're going through things like this, I sometimes wish my wife would talk about my sins against her the way my buddies do, but she doesn't, she doesn't like a woman who does.
[time=1619] If I violate a friend or a buddy they usually say, "Hey, what's up?" I say, "Ah, sorry." He says, "No problem."
[time=1627] My wife has this way of describing to me.
[time=1633] She has this way of very lovingly and very pointedly putting word pictures to my sin.
[time=1642] She tells me how my sin makes her feel. She tells me and describes to me how my choice or my words leave her feeling, and so oftentimes as you know, words and choices can leave people feeling devastated, lonely, not valued, overlooked.
[time=1669] And I hear those words like some of you guys hear those words, and you don't want to hear those words, and so many times that's when the whole defensive thing pops up.
[time=1677] And you start hearing words that are connected to what you didn't said, and you don't want to accept the fact that that's how ugly your choice was.
[time=1688] And so the walls go up and the bombs start getting lobbed and all of a sudden were at battle.
[time=1695] Because I wasn't willing or you weren't willing, whoever you are, to agree with God fully and to agree with your wife or your husband or your son or daughter fully about what you've done.
[time=1710] The fact that you did it, the fact that it's your responsibility and the ugliness and the impact of it all.
[time=1718] Confession, write this down. Confession is worship. Confession is worship and confession at the same time allows for worship.
[time=1727] Confession, his worship and confession allows for worship because here's what happens. You see sin, a bitter heart or a bad attitude, hinders and slorts our worship.
[time=1739] And then in confession we humble ourselves before God or a spouse acknowledging his holiness and our humanness experiencing his faithful forgiveness, accepting whatever consequences he may deliver, and through it all he is glorified.
[time=1756] He is worshiped. He is honored. And a life of worship, a walk of worship cannot be experienced without regular times of honest confession with God and others.
[time=1771] I'm beginning to believe that more and more and more so in my own life and in the lives of others who I see practicing the discipline of confession.
[time=1783] How often are you literally taking time aside in the morning, in the noon at night with friends with family on your own to confess your sins, your sinful thoughts, your sinful actions, your sinful choices?
[time=1801] Real worship doesn't happen without it.
[time=1807] Let me say this to you before we move on. Don't forget this, boy. Put a big, big circle around this one. Highlight it. Exclamation point. Don't miss this one. Don't forget what happens, people.
[time=1819] When sin, bitter hearts or bad attitudes aren't confessed.
[time=1825] Please don't forget this morning what happens in your life and mind when you or I aren't willing to confess.
[time=1832] When we allow that sin, that choice, that violation of him or her or them to go unaddressed.
[time=1839] Look at Psalm 32. Back to your Old Testament, it's kind of right there in the middle of your Bible. The great book of Psalms says in chapter 32 some things that you need to be and I need to be reminded of this morning.
[time=1854] As it relates to those times we might think it okay to just keep moving and leave the whole confession thing behind. Psalm 32 verses 3 and 4. Look at what it says there.
[time=1875] David says this. He says in verse 3 when I kept silent about my sin, my body wasted away. Do you see that? When I kept silent about my sin, my body wasted away through my groaning all day long for day and night verse 4, thy hand was heavy upon me.
[time=1899] Look at me for a second. I mean not at me or look at me or somehow I mean have you ever felt the heavy hand of God on your life?
[time=1914] When you know down deep inside something isn't right, something's been done, something's been chosen, something's been said and you have ignored the call upon your life to confess that before him.
[time=1927] Have you felt that I have? I have felt the heavy hand of God. I would take you back to verse 3 and tell you this. I have physically felt.
[time=1936] I mean I haven't just sensed. I have physically in my body. David talks about how his body begins to waste away. I have felt sick. You? I have felt sick.
[time=1950] And then he breaks you in with humility before him and whoever you go and you say what needs to be said as painful as it is to agree with it, own it and see the ugliness of it.
[time=1962] And yet in the midst of that pain there's something physically and spiritually healthy. You can't deny it. You cannot walk away from it.
[time=1972] I have seen churches. I have seen friendships. I have seen families divided, lost, split. I have seen physical pain and heartache escalate because somebody wasn't willing to say I was wrong.
[time=1988] And I sinned against you and I confess that. God before you. Don't forget what happens when confession is ignored. Number 3, worshipful living.
[time=2001] Worshipful living can only take place when our walk is fully surrendered to this thing called unwavering faith. Write it down, unwavering faith.
[time=2012] Look with me back to the New Testament Romans chapter 4. Go to Romans chapter 4, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, then comes Romans just before 1 Corinthians.
[time=2023] And in Romans chapter 4 we see the great story kind of unfolding of a guy named Abraham. He was the forefather, the nation of Israel.
[time=2036] And in chapter 4 of Romans Paul goes to great length to describe this thing that Abraham had, this thing that he exercised, this truth that he banked on, this thing called faith.
[time=2049] And in Romans chapter 4 verse 3 it says this, "For what does the Scriptures say?" Romans 4, 3. "For what does the Scriptures say?" And Abraham believed God.
[time=2062] He believed God and it was reckoned to him as righteousness. His faith saved him. And look down at verse 18. Romans 4, 18 in hope against hope.
[time=2074] He believed in order that he might become a father of many nations according to that which had been spoken, so shall your descendants be.
[time=2082] And without becoming weak in faith, he contemplated his own body, now as good as dead since he was about a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarah, his wife's womb.
[time=2094] Remember now at this point Paul is referring back to this point in life where they found out they were going to, God told them through his messengers they were going to conceive.
[time=2103] He had been promised descendants years and years and years before, now he's a hundred years old, they find out they're going to conceive and give birth.
[time=2113] He looks at his own body, almost a hundred years old, his wife Sarah, whose womb has been dead and shut.
[time=2119] Verse 20, yet with respect, here you go, yet with respect to the promise of God, he did not waver in unbelief, but grew strong in faith, giving glory to God and being fully assured that what he had promised, he was able also to perform.
[time=2146] And you cannot, and I cannot forget, people that God has made some promises to you.
[time=2153] He's not promised you that he will give you what you want. He has never promised you that you will get it all that you hope for and all that you long for know, but he has promised you his great love.
[time=2164] He has promised you perfect, sovereign involvement. He has promised to take care of you. He has promised to allow into your life only that which you can handle and need to further grow.
[time=2175] And understand him, he has promised to walk through life with you and me.
[time=2181] And every week I see this, every week I sit with people, I talk to people on the phone, I email people, you see it as well, people living in the pain and wreckage of shattered faith.
[time=2196] It's everywhere. He did this, she did that, this happened, that happened, pain and disappointment intensified, patience and hope grow thin, so they jump ship.
[time=2210] Because they've had enough, they jump ship, faith, wavers, tough times, really tough times, hit and survival and eventual satisfaction become king, not enduring faith.
[time=2225] Enduring, enduring faith goes like this, survival, satisfaction goes like this, and faith wavers.
[time=2234] And we listen, you and me both, because it happens to me just like it happens to you.
[time=2240] Enduring faith does this, survival and satisfaction does this, and in that process it's you and it's me listening to the enemy who's whispering, sometimes yelling in your ear, you've been abandoned.
[time=2254] He doesn't love you like he said he did, it's only going to get worse, grab hold, take control, start punching your buttons.
[time=2271] Wise, lies straight from the pit when like Abraham, we should you should and I should, when really tough times hit, you should and I should keep listening to the promises of God.
[time=2293] We should keep listening to the God who said this in Jeremiah 2911, I love this.
[time=2300] Jeremiah 2911 says this, "For I know the plans I have for you says the Lord, they are plans for good."
[time=2308] Do you see that?
[time=2310] Don't forget this morning that the God of the universe has a plan for you and his plan for you, no matter what your circumstantial experience may be today, God's Word reminds us,
[time=2322] hear this morning in this place that his plans for you are good, good plans.
[time=2330] See what it says?
[time=2331] They are plans for good and not for evil to give you a future, the one you're white knuckling and demanding he bring you, maybe not.
[time=2342] But you can count on this whatever future it is, it's a good one that will grow you, shape your faith and extend even further and further your opportunity for love and ministry.
[time=2357] Listen to this, my guess is thinking about this week and I was thinking about you and again I was thinking about me.
[time=2364] My guess is this, there are places if your life and mine is a journey, all right?
[time=2372] I believe there are more than likely places of obedience and trust, places of unwavering faith that you and I have never experienced.
[time=2386] Some of you have seen a lot more life than I have and I know from conversations with you, I know from watching you, I know from hearing you talk about this and about that, I believe that that's true.
[time=2399] And in my youth, I want so desperately to keep giving myself to him so that maybe I could taste some day what it's like to experience God in a place of obedience and trust that I've never been before because for so many years in my youth, as times got tough and as trial got rained down, you and I, we get to this point about right here and we say, whoa, that's about it.
[time=2424] That's about all I can take. It's hopeless, it's painful, it's destructive and as best as I can tell, that's about it and so we, we jump.
[time=2438] And I bet there are places of obedience and trust I've never been because at times like this, you and I's faith was too small, too flexible.
[time=2453] Abrahams didn't waver. God said you're going to be a dad at 100 years old with a wife whose womb was dead and he said, absolutely.
[time=2466] You betcha.
[time=2473] Lives of worship are lived by faith. Write it down.
[time=2476] Lives of worship are lived by unwavering faith. Worship for living number four, worship for living can only take place when our walk, when our daily living is surrendered to contentment.
[time=2491] I don't know how you do in this arena. I think lately God's just been trying to teach me some things. I'm not grading too high in this category.
[time=2500] Got to keep working on it. The way I said it is this, I just wrote this down this week. Worship and whining. Worship and whining are not synonymous.
[time=2511] Worship-filled living doesn't ask the question why.
[time=2518] Or maybe better said I'm just, as I said that, the thought just came to me. I think, correct me if I'm wrong, and again I might be on this one.
[time=2532] This is just kind of from the hip here. It just came to me. It's always dangerous to talk about what just came to you, but I'm going to do it.
[time=2537] I don't necessarily know that he doesn't want us to ask or feel the why. I think it's how you say it. Does that make sense?
[time=2549] I think what I'm trying to say is worshipful living doesn't go. Why? You know what I mean? Why? Gosh. Why? You know, like a three-year-old that just got told no on the whole candy thing.
[time=2568] And that's what you look like. And that's what I look like sometimes in our heart when what we want doesn't transpire when what we're after doesn't come to fruition.
[time=2578] There's sometimes this why? God, why?
[time=2583] I think it's the way we say it. I think if in the depths of your heart there's confusion. Like there is sometimes in mine.
[time=2590] I think he's all right with me saying, wow, I don't get this. I'm confused by this. I mean, I want to keep going here.
[time=2600] Maybe that's the key, it's the, I'm gonna keep going here.
[time=2604] Spirit.
[time=2604] Worshipful living doesn't ask like a whiner.
[time=2609] The question, why, why can't I have that house?
[time=2612] Why can't I have that car?
[time=2614] Why can't I have that wife, that husband, that life?
[time=2617] I want his career, I want their success, I want her looks.
[time=2620] Why, why, why, why can't I have more?
[time=2623] Why can't I make more?
[time=2629] And you know what, sometimes we don't say it.
[time=2631] Sometimes we live like that, does that make sense?
[time=2637] Sometimes we don't say it, sometimes we just live like a whiner.
[time=2642] And nothing's ever good enough, and nothing's ever right.
[time=2646] And there's something always wrong with somebody or something.
[time=2650] Why, why, never really content, always demanding more.
[time=2656] When what we see in scripture is the absolute opposite.
[time=2660] God calls us to a mindset, and a way of caring ourselves.
[time=2664] Look at Philippians, back past Galatians and Ephesians.
[time=2667] Go to Philippians, chapter four.
[time=2670] Paul seemed to have a different take.
[time=2673] He often did, didn't he?
[time=2675] Paul has a different take on this contentment thing.
[time=2677] He says in Philippians chapter four, verse 11, not that I speak from what, for I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I am.
[time=2689] I know how to get along with humble means, and I also know how to live in prosperity.
[time=2693] In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of being filled and going hungry, both of having abundance and suffering need.
[time=2703] And what is that secret?
[time=2704] I can do all things through him, not my wealth, not my skill, not my talent, not my ability, not my poverty, no, I can do all things through him when he is involved, when he is allowed in, when he is what matters.
[time=2724] I can do all things that says through him who strengthens me.
[time=2727] Go to 1 Timothy, this one won't be on the screen, but just turn back there anyway, 1 Timothy, chapter six.
[time=2734] Go to 1 Timothy six, and look with me at what Paul says to the unpassed her, Timothy, as he's encouraging him on how to address and challenge these people at the church at Ephesus.
[time=2745] He says in 1 Timothy six, verse six, great statement here.
[time=2750] It says there, but godliness, but godliness, Timothy, actually is a means of great gain when accompanied by what your Bible say.
[time=2760] Contentment is what mine reads.
[time=2764] For we have brought nothing into the world so we cannot and will not take anything out of it either.
[time=2772] And if we have food, here you go, and if we have food, verse eight, and covering with these, we shall be content.
[time=2780] People, did you see that?
[time=2782] Did you see that? Answer me.
[time=2787] Did you see that? Did you read that?
[time=2790] I wanna make sure you all read that and saw that.
[time=2793] And if we have food and covering,
[time=2800] and he stops right there, I didn't write it.
[time=2803] I'm just telling you what it says.
[time=2805] With these, we shall be content.
[time=2811] But those who want more, those who wanna get rich fall into temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful desires which plunge men into ruin and destruction for the love of money is a.
[time=2827] Oftentimes it gets quoted as the for the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil.
[time=2834] And some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many a pain.
[time=2842] In the vernacular of our day, gotten into a heap of trouble.
[time=2846] One who is willing to worship says,
[time=2854] God your plans for me are plans for good.
[time=2858] And if you will allow me to have food and shelter, I will be thoroughly and completely content.
[time=2866] And I will give myself to whatever it is you have for me.
[time=2871] Thank you.
[time=2872] I came with your strength and only your strength.
[time=2875] Move forward, I can move forward, grateful.
[time=2877] I can move forward, satisfied with whatever it is you give me.
[time=2883] And I'll just say this and we'll move on.
[time=2885] Folks, this begins early.
[time=2887] All right, this is not parenting lessons from Kelly 'cause you know I'm still learning and I got some more learning to go yet.
[time=2895] But I'm telling you, my experience in nine years of it would lead me to say to you, this attitude of contentment begins early.
[time=2904] And when you choose because you're a parent or when I choose because I'm a parent to say, no.
[time=2913] When we might choose to say, not now.
[time=2917] When you might, for whatever reason you may have or I might, for whatever reason I may have, choose to say not today, therein and every time therein lies an opportunity for a little hard in life
[time=2933] to get acquainted with the principle of contentment.
[time=2938] And you can help them and I can help them look us back in the eye and say, okay.
[time=2944] Okay.
[time=2947] And we work so very hard at that in our own home, trying to help them and trying to remind us.
[time=2957] And whether it's a five year old looking back at me saying, okay, with a really good attitude or whether it's me that night in bed going.
[time=2968] Okay.
[time=2969] I don't get it.
[time=2971] I'm not sure I understand it, but my posture toward you will be.
[time=2975] Okay.
[time=2976] I'm still in.
[time=2977] It starts early and you gotta work at it.
[time=2981] Redemptive living will end with this.
[time=2984] Worshipful living can only take place when our walk is surrendered to redemptive living.
[time=2989] When you live daily with a hardened mindset that longs to see those without Christ find them.
[time=2994] When you live daily hoping for it and looking for opportunities to connect with one far from God.
[time=3001] It's when you live with eternity.
[time=3003] It's when you and I live with eternity in view and not our next appointment or our next paycheck or our next class.
[time=3010] Because when you live with a redemptive heart that is open and ready to build trust filled relationships, ready to live out and share your faith, what happens often is that he draws people to himself.
[time=3023] He draws people to himself through your efforts not because of your efforts, but through your efforts.
[time=3028] He chooses to use your redemptive attitude, your heart and mind that are open to whoever God might have in your life.
[time=3037] He chooses to bring them to himself through your efforts and people get saved.
[time=3041] People come to know faith.
[time=3043] People cross over the line and give their hearts and lives to Jesus Christ.
[time=3048] And that brings glory to God.
[time=3050] God receives the worship.
[time=3052] God receives the glory of a new believer's new faith when we walk in a way that points them toward new life.
[time=3059] Question for you this morning.
[time=3060] We'll close with this.
[time=3061] Who are you pointing?
[time=3063] Who?
[time=3064] I'm asking you again, who are you pointing with your love and your investment and your time and your energy and your talents and your treasure?
[time=3074] Who are you pointing toward new life?
[time=3078] Who are you making sacrifices for in your personal or family schedule?
[time=3083] Not because they're a project, because your love for them is great and your hope for their eternity is even greater.
[time=3090] Who?
[time=3091] Worshipful living requires a fully surrendered walk.
[time=3097] Worship must be personal people before it's public.
[time=3109] I wanna give you a chance to just sit back.
[time=3111] And I want you to think about that and I want you to think about the things that we've talked about over the last few weeks.
[time=3115] We're gonna run a video that just kind of, in a sense, through the words in the song, captures the essence of what we've been saying and I want you to stick around and see this.
[time=3125] The words to the song capture the essence.
[time=3128] The pictures themselves may just draw you back to a time we've had together that really ministered to you, spoke to you, helped you understand better this thing called worship.
[time=3137] Take a look.
[time=3138] Be ministered to and I'll come back up and we'll close.
[time=3143] The heart of worship is and always has been blessing him.
[time=3148] Coming to intimacy with him, giving to him.
[time=3153] He is the center of worship and how dare we ever make us the center of worship.
[time=3160] Worship isn't to please me, it's to please Jesus.
[time=3165] Worship is for Jesus, it's to Jesus and it's about Jesus.
[time=3173] [MUSIC - 225 seconds]
[time=3403] - Worship isn't to please me, it's to please Jesus.
[time=3414] Worship is for Jesus.
[time=3417] It's to Jesus and it's about Jesus.
[time=3422] - Before you go, if there's anybody here this morning
[time=3428] who really wants to understand what it means personally to be surrendered, we'd love to talk to you about it.
[time=3434] You may have been coming for weeks or this may be your first, but to really be personally surrendered to Jesus Christ and to then have the privilege and the joy and the excitement of living a life that you've maybe been hearing us talk about.
[time=3448] We'd love to talk with you this morning.
[time=3450] We've got folks down here who would do that with you.
[time=3452] Father, we leave this place today.
[time=3454] So very thankful for the privilege that has been ours to be in your presence and to be with each other.
[time=3460] God, as we leave our prayer and our hope is that our walk, the way we live and choose would be consistent with who we say we are and that our walk would be full of worship.
[time=3472] We love you, Father.
[time=3473] We pray all this in your name, amen.
