[time=0] [MUSIC - 150 seconds]
[time=160] >> Let me just invite you to pray with me if you would, right where you're at.
[time=179] Melt us, mold us, fill us and use us.
[time=184] Father, that's our prayer this morning.
[time=188] And our hope is that as we've come together, once again to enjoy the fellowship of others and
[time=195] most importantly, God too, experience the privilege again of entering into your presence.
[time=201] God, our prayer and our hope is that the praises that we've lifted to you from our hearts, hearts that are thankful, realizing all over again who you are and what you've done.
[time=213] The utter privilege that is ours of not only relationship with you, but the chance to be here.
[time=218] And to say these things and to see and to sing these things, to worship you in spirit and in truth.
[time=223] God, our hope is that it's been pleasing.
[time=227] And our hope too is that as we would continue on this morning and as we open God's word.
[time=233] And as it does what only it can do, as it penetrates our hearts and minds as the words are
[time=240] spoken and so many in the room today will again feel as if you're talking directly to them.
[time=247] And that's because the word of God is what it is and you see us and you know us and you know exactly what we need.
[time=254] And so as we say these words and as we look to your truth, God, I pray hearts would be open because you are speaking directly to us and we pray that the Spirit of God, your Holy
[time=264] Spirit would fall on us, open our hearts and our minds and our lives to the truth that you
[time=271] would have for us.
[time=272] In your son's name we pray, amen.
[time=277] Well, hey, it's good to be together again.
[time=281] And thank you so much for such a sweet, sweet time of worship.
[time=286] And before we move into the message part of the service, we want to give you a chance to hear about something that is very, very, very important in the life and ministry of
[time=297] this church.
[time=298] And you've heard us talking about it for the last several months, last year or so in fact
[time=304] really, if you go back to its kind of inception in beginning stages.
[time=308] But there's a new ministry here in this family, it's called Following Christ.
[time=313] And as many of you know, we're given our hearts and our lives and our days and our nights around here to one thing.
[time=320] And that is doing our very best with God's help in every arena of ministry, doing our
[time=326] very best with His help to help seeking people both saved and searching, find and follow
[time=332] Christ.
[time=333] And if you let me go on, I'd go on for an hour about all that's going on on the finding front, efforts we're making, ministries that have been established, things that are going
[time=343] on, again, with all the way from the young to the old, on the front end of the Great Commission, helping people understand what it really means to find Him.
[time=352] But then, you know, once God does that, and again, He uses us in that process, but once God draws someone to Himself, there's an equally important task, an equally important
[time=364] opportunity that we have and that is to help people understand what it really means to follow Him, to be a true follower of Christ.
[time=372] And so, with some help from a whole lot of folks, we have at the staff level and leadership level come up with this following Christ ministry.
[time=381] And we've got some guys here this morning who are going to sing about it, no, just kidding.
[time=386] We've got some guys here this morning who, along with others, give leadership and involvement
[time=392] and oversight to the four sections of following Christ, following Christ 101, 201, 301 and 401.
[time=400] This ministry consists of four classes, and these four classes, and I even hate to use
[time=406] the word class, because you know what?
[time=408] These times are designed to be interactive, these times are designed to be informative, these times are designed to be inspiring to you, and it's for all of you.
[time=418] It's for those new to the faith, it's for those new to the church, it's for those who have been around for 25 years.
[time=424] Him Christ is a great opportunity for you to be and for myself, even to be reminded again
[time=431] of what this church is really about, what we're trying with God's help to accomplish and how every one of you can help us in that endeavor.
[time=439] And so, I asked Bob Purdy, who is the pastor on staff here who gives direct oversight to following Christ, to ask some of these folks to come and share briefly with you what you will encounter as you go through this process.
[time=451] And so Jim McCrady, one of the guys who helps give leadership to the 101 endeavor.
[time=455] Jim, tell the folks what they can expect to see in following Christ 101.
[time=460] Okay.
[time=461] I would not be doing my vocation if I didn't drive people to the following Christ booth in the lobby.
[time=468] You can pick up some more information.
[time=470] If your interest is peaked from this brief time here, or things you've heard, go there,
[time=477] sign up.
[time=478] So that's it.
[time=480] Jim Christ 101 is membership.
[time=483] And what it -- as Kelly said, it's interactive, it's curriculum-based, it's not necessarily
[time=489] a top-down thing.
[time=491] There's time for us to engage.
[time=492] But what it's about real in a short period of time is an effort to clearly present who
[time=499] we are here at Black Hawk, our statements of faith, the things that we all agree on,
[time=508] that we anchor to, it is a look at the big church, the big sea, as we call it, the membership
[time=518] that you can belong to the people that you saw at East Asia, in the body of Christ, and
[time=524] then the little sea, the church here, what that looks like, how we come together as a community.
[time=529] We take a look at, as I said, the statement of faith.
[time=533] We take a look at some doctrine, and we look at some -- and what God's word has to say about all of that.
[time=540] And we look at God, man, sin, and Christ as our Redeemer through that whole process.
[time=553] And it's just a look of how we function, and it's all good.
[time=557] We take a look at God's word, a little section of it.
[time=560] So it's really kind of who we are, how we function, and what God's word has to say about all of that.
[time=566] Fantastic.
[time=567] Thanks, Jim.
[time=568] Following 101, and 101 is a prerequisite for 201, following 101, and a look at our church
[time=574] and some of the fundamental basics of our faith and our ministry, then folks go on to 201, and Bob, tell folks what they'll encounter in 201.
[time=581] Yeah, we're going to get people involved right now, since the following crisis is interactive.
[time=586] If you would, if you've had the privilege in your lifetime of having children, would
[time=592] you raise your hand around -- let me just see hands.
[time=596] Wow.
[time=597] Okay, hands down.
[time=599] You then have experienced, in some way, shape or form, a new life, seeing a new life.
[time=607] And in Corinthians, it talks about when the old has gone, the new has come.
[time=615] And you've seen, in the flesh, a baby born.
[time=618] Well, what we're going to do in 201 is we're going to address steps to maturity.
[time=623] What does that mean?
[time=624] What does that look like for us as believers?
[time=627] Those who have said, "Yes," to Jesus Christ, "Yes, I believe in you," now what?
[time=634] Now what do I do?
[time=635] And how do we become mature in that process?
[time=638] In 1 Peter, chapter 1, it talks about those that God has chosen, and set apart by His
[time=648] Holy Spirit, so that we would -- and it's very clear, so that we would obey Christ.
[time=656] Okay, obey Him.
[time=659] Now what do we do?
[time=660] How do we obey?
[time=661] And those things are what we're going to look at in following Christ 201, steps to maturity.
[time=667] For some of you along that journey, you have been in that pilgrimage for a long time.
[time=674] If I asked anyone to raise a hand here who felt like they were done, I don't think we'd
[time=681] see it very many hands.
[time=683] We are also in following Christ going to look at some very specific things that pardon the
[time=694] marketing ploy, but we'll tell the secret of what it is to be mature.
[time=700] You know, there is a secret.
[time=702] There is.
[time=703] Come to following Christ 201 to find out what it is.
[time=707] From 101, you've moved to 201, from membership.
[time=710] We kind of then begin to help people understand for the first time, or again, be reminded of what it means to grow in one's faith, maturity.
[time=717] And then from maturity, in 201, we moved to 301, and Doug Crane's here to tell you about
[time=723] what you're going to see and experience in 301.
[time=726] 301 is a steps to mission.
[time=730] And it seems to me like that's a very natural progression to go from 201 steps to maturity
[time=736] to steps to mission, because it's really natural for us as we grow in our relationship with God to want to go tell other people about that.
[time=744] And that's really what steps to mission is about.
[time=747] It's about the mission, the one that Jesus Christ gave to all of us before He left the earth to go and tell other people about Him and make disciples of all nations.
[time=757] And we start off in 301 by really looking at Black Hawk's role in mission, what is Black Hawk Church doing to help fulfill that mission, the Great Commission.
[time=768] And we look at the global ministries team, what they do, how we go about selecting missionaries,
[time=774] who becomes a missionary, how are they supported, a lot of those kinds of things that are very informational that maybe some of you have never had a chance to look into.
[time=783] And then it also gives you a challenge though, it's not just informational, it gives you a challenge of how should you be involved in global missions, whether that's in our backyard or whether that's to the ends of the earth.
[time=795] And then the other thing that's really exciting about 301 is that we really take a good look at personal missions and how can each of us be involved in fulfilling that Great Commission.
[time=807] And we're really challenged to look at culture, John Bars has written a lot of really good material in there that really causes us to think about what's different about our culture
[time=817] today and how do we go about taking the message to people, how are we going to be good news
[time=823] to people, how are we going to be salt and light.
[time=826] And there's some practical tools in there, there's some practical tools that we talk about that you'll get outside of 301, but I think you'll really be challenged and learn a lot from taking part in it.
[time=836] Fantastic.
[time=837] From 301, then we move to the last of the 401, we've gone from membership to maturity
[time=844] to mission and now we come to ministry and Greg, tell the folks what will happen and what they'll see in 401.
[time=851] Well in 401, we're going to have an absolutely great time.
[time=855] Much of what the guys have shared with you deals with our head, but in 401, what we're going to share with you deals with your heart.
[time=863] And for those of you that are already involved in an area of ministry, you know what I'm about to say is true.
[time=869] There is nothing, there is absolutely nothing more rewarding or fulfilling than finding
[time=876] your place in the body of Christ and serving and watching what God does in and through
[time=883] you.
[time=884] It's an awesome thing.
[time=886] And that's what we're going to be talking about in 401, steps to ministry.
[time=891] In 401, we have a purpose statement that says this, "By God's design, every believer
[time=899] is uniquely equipped to serve and make a significant contribution in his or her world by modeling
[time=908] the heart and mind of Jesus Christ." And so in 401, as you come and join with us, we'll help you discover how God has gifted
[time=918] you and wired you to make a meaningful and important contribution for the kingdom.
[time=924] And in 401, one of my hopes and prayers, and I hope it's yours as well, is that your heart
[time=930] will grow.
[time=931] I really believe our heart, you see, never stays the same.
[time=935] It either gets smaller or it gets larger for God's Word and his people and his kingdom.
[time=941] And it's our hope and prayer that your heart will be challenged in 401 in a great way to serve like you never have before.
[time=949] [AMEN] Hey, this is a great, great opportunity.
[time=952] It starts tonight at 4 o'clock with 101.
[time=956] 101 begins at 4 o'clock.
[time=958] You can sign up for it still today after the service.
[time=961] In the next month, 201 will be offered along with a new 101.
[time=965] And then as the months progress, the other ones kick in.
[time=968] But just want to get encourage it.
[time=970] Tonight, it begins at 4 every month.
[time=973] On the second Sunday night of each month will be kind of when following Christ takes place.
[time=978] So you don't want to miss it.
[time=980] Every one of you please give some thought to being a part of this and you'll hear more about it as the months progress.
[time=989] Webster, our friend, you know, who wrote the dictionary, Webster defines it as our sinful
[time=996] longing towards depraved affections, a sinful desire for a sinful pleasure, sinful desire
[time=1006] in that it moves one outside the realm of God's provision, sinful desire in that it moves
[time=1012] one outside the realm of God's provision and/or God's wisdom, sinful pleasure in that it
[time=1018] focuses on a kind of pleasure that when embraced violates God and others.
[time=1024] What is it?
[time=1025] It has toppled nations, it has crippled world leaders, it has shattered families, it has captured the fantasies of our young and held in bondage the hearts of our aged.
[time=1036] It has destroyed trust, it has diminished respect, it has permanently tarnished reputations and endangered the lives and well-being of young and old alike.
[time=1046] It has led bright and gifted men capable of amazing things and to personal ruin.
[time=1051] It has led talented and capable women with promising careers or growing families into the dark despair of humiliation and loss.
[time=1060] It has stripped hope, it has escalated guilt, it has seemingly won more than it's lost.
[time=1070] It lies, it deceives, it promises satisfaction yet leaves us empty, it promises fullness yet
[time=1079] leaves every one of us hungry, it promises excitement but brings a sadness hard to even
[time=1085] describe, it promises peace and relief but delivers only instead more pressure, it promises
[time=1096] happiness in the end bringing only heartache, worst of all, worst of all, if all that wasn't
[time=1105] bad enough, the Scriptures tell us it promises life and brings instead only death.
[time=1115] What is it?
[time=1117] King David fell to it as he stood on a balcony and watched Bathsheba bathe in 2 Samuel 11.
[time=1124] Joseph ran from it in Genesis 39 leaving his coat in the clutching hands of Potiphar's wife.
[time=1131] What is it?
[time=1133] It's called lust and as we prepare to take what I hope will be an honest and probing and
[time=1140] genuine look at the topic this morning I want to invite you first of all to James chapter
[time=1146] 1.
[time=1147] If you've got your Bibles open up there if you would, James back toward the back of the New Testament chapter 1 and what may be one of the clearest pictures given in the Scriptures
[time=1157] of this killer called lust.
[time=1163] Chapter 1 and I want to draw your attention first of all to verse 13.
[time=1169] James chapter 1, 13 it says this, "Let no one say when he is tempted, I am being tempted
[time=1178] by God, for God cannot be tempted by evil and he himself does not tempt anyone."
[time=1185] Stop right there for a moment.
[time=1186] Let's say this, much of what we'll see this morning, especially later as we end our time today with a look at the book of Proverbs, much of what we'll look at there we'll have to do with sexual lust, the folly and the futility of adultery and sexual immorality.
[time=1203] And yet most of us know that lust is multi-faceted, it's not just pertaining to those things.
[time=1210] No, when allowed to take root, when allowed to be pursued, when embraced, whether we're
[time=1218] talking about too much internet time, too much sleep, too much food, too much TV, too
[time=1224] much fun, too much money, whatever it is we're dealing with there.
[time=1229] And there's a lot that you have to deal with and that I have to deal with, a lot that comes across our path that offers us opportunity to go outside of God's provision, to go outside
[time=1241] of God's wisdom, to seek a pleasure that when embraced violates God and others.
[time=1248] Lot of opportunities, lust is multi-faceted and whether it's any of those, when allowed
[time=1255] at Rex Havoc brings ruin to personal lives.
[time=1259] And so look with me if you would at what we'll call initially hear the life of lust.
[time=1265] The life of lust, James chapter 1 verse 13 on down through 16.
[time=1271] No one say when he is tempted, "I am being tempted by God, for God cannot be tempted by evil and he himself does not tempt anyone, but each one of you and myself."
[time=1283] We are verse 14, "Each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust.
[time=1290] Then when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin and when sin is accomplished, it brings forth death." Verse 16, "Don't be deceived, my beloved brethren.
[time=1302] Do not be deceived, my beloved brethren." First thing I want you to see there in James chapter 1 as we look at this life of lust
[time=1313] is trials turned into temptation.
[time=1317] Let it down, trials turned into temptation.
[time=1320] Look at what happens as the life of lust begins to kick into gear.
[time=1324] It says, "Don't let anyone say I am being tempted by God, for God cannot be tempted by evil and he himself does not tempt anyone, but each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust." We are reminded at the outset of this passage that God does not tempt.
[time=1341] You understand that, right?
[time=1344] God does not tempt.
[time=1347] That is true and you have to understand how this works.
[time=1349] He doesn't do that.
[time=1351] No, God doesn't tempt, Satan tempts us.
[time=1355] It is Satan who tempts us to turn the trials, okay?
[time=1359] It is Satan who tempts you and it is Satan who tempts me to turn the trials which God
[time=1365] does allow, right?
[time=1368] James chapter 1, "Consider it all joy when you encounter various trials knowing this that the testing of your faith produces endurance." Yes, God allows the trial.
[time=1380] Satan comes along and tries to get you and tries to get me to turn that trial into a temptation and hopefully sin.
[time=1389] God is too holy to be tempted, too loving to tempt.
[time=1393] He allows trials and we, you and I, we have to be willing and ready to respond.
[time=1398] And it's so encouraging to remember what it says in places like 1 Corinthians.
[time=1404] You can turn there if you want 1 Corinthians 10, 13.
[time=1407] I think the verse will be on the screen when you're facing whatever it is you're facing.
[time=1411] When I'm facing the things that I've faced even this week, it has been an encouragement to be reminded of the fact that no temptation has overtaken you.
[time=1421] But such as is common to man, you begin to sometimes think like I do that what I'm facing
[time=1427] is so above and beyond what everybody else is facing.
[time=1430] My situation is extra tough.
[time=1434] My situation is extra tempting, but such as is common to man, he says.
[time=1443] And God is faithful who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able and watch other sins, but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also that you may
[time=1454] be able to endure it.
[time=1457] And that is a promise.
[time=1459] That is truth.
[time=1460] And that is God's word to you and God's word to me.
[time=1465] Ask yourself this morning, am I facing any trials?
[time=1470] Just do a quick look at your life.
[time=1472] Do a quick scan back in the last seven days.
[time=1474] Are you facing any trials today in your life?
[time=1476] What difficult or painful situation do you find yourself in?
[time=1480] What test of faith, according to James 1, meant to bring trust and a deeper joy has
[time=1486] God allowed to come across your path?
[time=1489] Go ahead, think about it.
[time=1490] I mean envision it.
[time=1491] Put it right there in the forefront of your mind.
[time=1494] What has he allowed to take place that is testing and stretching your faith?
[time=1500] Any trials now?
[time=1502] What have you done?
[time=1504] What have you said?
[time=1507] How have you responded?
[time=1508] Where have you gone?
[time=1510] Literally or emotionally in the midst of it.
[time=1514] How have you responded?
[time=1516] And are you responding in a way that allows God to grow and strengthen your faith?
[time=1522] Have you chosen God?
[time=1523] Are you choosing submission to the Word of God?
[time=1525] Have you chosen to trust Him when all seems lost?
[time=1528] Have you chosen to radically love Him and others, even those causing the pain, with an unconditional God-given love?
[time=1536] Has that been your choice?
[time=1537] Has that been your response or have you chosen Satan's back door?
[time=1542] Are you attempting with his prodding and with his guidance to get out from under the difficulty prematurely by choosing inappropriate, outside the provision of God, inappropriate forms of
[time=1556] relief?
[time=1558] And every day of my life, and every day of yours, I would guess.
[time=1565] If you're anything like me, you've got that choice to make.
[time=1569] Kids, students, adults, every one of us.
[time=1573] Because every day of our lives, the enemy brings across your path things outside the parameters of God's will and says to you, screams to you, whispers to you, go get it.
[time=1585] Because whatever it is you're feeling, whatever it is you're facing today, that will make you feel better.
[time=1592] And every day of my life, I have a choice to make.
[time=1596] And you do too.
[time=1597] Write them down.
[time=1598] I'll just say it to you briefly.
[time=1599] I'll say it to you succinctly.
[time=1600] Pursue God and endure the trial.
[time=1603] Write it down.
[time=1604] Pursue God and endure the trial.
[time=1608] You may even want to put in parentheses there obediently.
[time=1612] Pursue God and endure the trial.
[time=1614] That's one choice, and it's painful, and it's hard at times, and it seems even in some situations
[time=1620] to be insurmountable or impossible.
[time=1623] But that's a choice.
[time=1624] You can and I can pursue God and endure the trial or escape the trial and pursue lust.
[time=1632] Escape the trial and pursue lust with all of its deception.
[time=1638] What do I mean by that?
[time=1640] Pursue lust and all of its deception.
[time=1644] Let me draw your attention back to verse 14.
[time=1648] That's what it said there.
[time=1650] It said, "But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust."
[time=1656] James reminds us in this verse of lust's deceptive power, lust's life-shattering, life-altering
[time=1664] power.
[time=1665] Two phrases there I want you to see.
[time=1667] Take note on these, okay, underline these or mark these down.
[time=1670] Two phrases in verse 14 worth noting.
[time=1672] Number one, carried away.
[time=1675] Word your translation may say drawn away, you see it there?
[time=1678] Verse 14, "But each one is tempted when he is carried away."
[time=1684] The Greek word, the New Testament again was written in the Greek language and in the original language there, that Greek word was used in that day to describe wild game being lured
[time=1696] into a cage.
[time=1698] Wild game being lured into a net, some kind of trap, and that's the picture that you've
[time=1706] got to keep in mind.
[time=1707] That's the picture that God wants you and I to have in our hearts as we consider the deceptive power of lust.
[time=1714] It is as if a side of beef is hanging in a cage and like a tiger or a lion hungry for
[time=1722] that which will satisfy.
[time=1724] We walk into a trap, a trap designed not just a cage but to kill.
[time=1734] Verse 14, "But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed," there's the
[time=1740] second phrase I want you to take note of, "and enticed," watch this, this word in the original language carried with it the idea of a fisherman baiting a hook.
[time=1752] Many of you fish, I don't but I've heard you tell your stories and I hear about it and I learn as I listen about the art of baiting a hook and there's a real art to it because
[time=1764] any good fisherman wants to make sure that that hook looks just right, that it offers
[time=1770] that fish just the right look.
[time=1776] Proverbs 7.
[time=1777] We're going to go back to Proverbs later but let's just skip there just for a second.
[time=1782] Look at Proverbs 7, it says it so well, Proverbs 7 verse 22, it kind of captures the essence
[time=1790] of these two phrases we've just looked at.
[time=1793] Proverbs 7, 22 says, "Back there in your Old Testament after the book of Psalms, just
[time=1801] before you get to Ecclesiastes," listen to what God's word says, "Proverbs," again
[time=1810] a book mainly written to a young man as a father tries to impart wisdom and in chapter
[time=1816] 7 verse 22 he says, "This suddenly he follows her."
[time=1822] Go back to 21 in fact, with her many persuasions she entices him, with her flattering lips she
[time=1828] seduces him.
[time=1830] Suddenly he follows her as an ox goes to the slaughter or as one infetters to the discipline
[time=1836] of a fool, verse 23 until an arrow pierces through his liver as a bird hastens to the
[time=1843] snare so he does not know that it will cost him his life.
[time=1851] That's what that's about, that's where that ends, that's where that leads and it has been
[time=1858] happening for years and it continues to happen and we continue to see it happen.
[time=1863] You watch it, I watch it, we hear about it and in the end it's always the same, death,
[time=1871] destruction, turmoil, strife, fractured families, homes, lives and yet to this day so many of
[time=1879] us still continue to not take heed.
[time=1883] So the bigger picture is a clear one, the hunter and the fisherman must use attractive
[time=1889] bait as they seek to catch, kill and entangle their prey, no animal is going to deliberately swallow the hook, no animal is deliberately going to walk in the cage and so Satan like
[time=1900] the hunter or fisherman hides the trap, he hides the hook, he dresses it up in an effort
[time=1906] to conceal the fact that embracing it will bring, always does, never will it not, bring
[time=1912] shame, sorrow and destruction.
[time=1915] Think about it and I want you to, could be a painful thought process, could be a scary
[time=1921] thought process for some here in the room this morning, maybe just a great reminder for others but I want you this morning to think about the hooks and the cages that the
[time=1934] enemy dangles in front of you daily.
[time=1940] Think about all the opportunities you encounter and we can even look to God's word and we
[time=1948] can find situation after situation that began just like this, Genesis 13, Lot would have
[time=1954] never moved towards Sodom, Sodom and Gomorrah a place where eventually as you look at the
[time=1962] Old Testament and as you study that story and as you see Lot's life unfold and that of his family, horrific things took place in that city.
[time=1973] Many would say and I would agree Lot would have never chosen to move towards Sodom had he not seen the well watered plains of the Jordan, sometimes it just looks so inviting.
[time=1988] Second Samuel 11, let me ask you this, would David have committed adultery, would David
[time=1994] have, would he have stood on that balcony and gone from that balcony down to that woman's
[time=2001] room, would he have done that, would he have committed that act, had he seen the pain and destruction of the hook, had he seen then the pain and destruction, the death of he and
[time=2011] Bathsheba's son, the murder of a brave soldier named Uriah, the violation of his own daughter named Tamar, I don't know.
[time=2023] You know the credit card companies, unless I miss something, I mean unless I've just been out of it for too long and I missed this commercial, I mean you tell me the credit card companies don't run commercials showing families getting their cars repossessed or
[time=2038] families being evicted from their homes, I mean did I miss that commercial somewhere?
[time=2043] I don't think so, I mean tell me if I did, did I miss the visa commercial that has the kids and the mom and the dad on the street with nowhere to go and nothing to drive because it's all gotten out of control.
[time=2055] Playboy doesn't run photo shoots or articles about men in prison serving time for sexually
[time=2061] deviant crimes and pornography related offenses do they, no, men who five, ten, fifteen years
[time=2067] ago picked up their first magazine or rented their first video while their wife was away
[time=2073] for the weekend.
[time=2074] Do you ever see it, no, will you ever, no, not in this life because in this world, in
[time=2081] this fallen world that we live in, the prince of the power of the air is at work and he will do everything possible with the limited power God's allowed to tell you to whisper
[time=2092] in your ear to make attractive to you that which will kill and he'll keep whispering
[time=2098] it and he'll keep pointing you toward it and it will again and again and again say to you
[time=2110] and offer you happiness relief gratification and it will in the end time and time again
[time=2121] bring you nothing even remotely close to any of what was promised.
[time=2128] Let's go on in this life of lust verse 15, lust leading to death back to James chapter
[time=2134] 1 trials turned into temptation then we see in verse 15 lust leading to death look where
[time=2140] this ends people verse 15 says then when lust has conceived it gives birth to sin and when
[time=2146] sin is accomplished it brings forth death.
[time=2151] Just stop and look for a second at the progression that we've followed even just so far in this brief look we've moved from the emotions we've moved from temptation lust and desire things
[time=2162] of that nature we've moved from the emotions to the intellect and from the intellect where
[time=2169] deception takes place we now move to the will to the will write it down we now move lust
[time=2176] when allowed now moves to the will and I just want to say this to you this morning please don't miss this life you guys young and old please don't miss this this gets so misconstrued
[time=2188] and this gets so misunderstood so many times life in relationship with Christ Christian
[time=2195] living is a matter of the will not the feelings not emotions it is a series Christian living
[time=2203] life in relationship with Jesus Christ is a series of obedient choices based solely on
[time=2210] submission to God's word and carried out in God's strength God's strength given to those
[time=2216] willing and you know what not just willing given to those who want who desire in their heart to who understand the benefit of God's strength given to those willing given to those
[time=2227] who want to choose him over some cheap substitute that is the Christian life strength given
[time=2237] to those willing to see that right is always right wrong is always what wrong and you think
[time=2249] and I think sometimes our situation is different and you know what it's not right is always
[time=2256] right and it may bring pain and it may bring question and it may bring uncertainty and
[time=2263] it may even bring yes unfulfilled desires but right is always right and wrong is always
[time=2271] wrong and then I wrote this down and when wrong seems right trusting him trusting him
[time=2279] will clear it up in time trusting him not your own perception not your own ability to figure
[time=2285] it out when wrong seems right trusting him will clear it up look at verse 16 do not
[time=2293] be deceived my beloved brethren what's James saying there what's he saying what he's saying
[time=2300] simply is this don't buy the lie don't do it don't take the bait stay away from the trap
[time=2307] don't be fools because you will lose you won't win no one ever has no one is today and no
[time=2319] one ever will stay away from the bait stay away from the trap he says don't be deceived
[time=2328] my beloved brethren he says these people who he who he loved and cared for deeply all
[time=2334] please he says don't go there don't do it now this morning just to reiterate the loss
[time=2344] tied to lust lust of all kinds just to reiterate and just to be reminded yet again of the
[time=2353] loss that is tied to lust look with me at proverbs and some truth that I hope we can
[time=2359] take home today we're going to start with proverbs chapter five verses seven to ten
[time=2373] proverbs chapter five verses seven to ten some truth to take home there's some lessons
[time=2382] that you and I need to learn again and again as it relates to this issue Proverbs chapter
[time=2389] five we'll pick it up in verse seven now then my sons listen to me and do not depart from
[time=2397] the words of my mouth keep your way far from her and do not go near the door of her house
[time=2405] lest you give your vigor to others and your years to the cruel one less strangers be filled
[time=2411] with your strength and your hard earned goods go to the house of an alien stop right there
[time=2421] first thing I want you to see there write it down on the very practical side of this battle stay away stay away don't get in the car don't get on the net don't pick up the
[time=2437] phone don't go down that hall stay away he says it to you right there keep your way
[time=2446] far from her keep your way far from it whatever it her she he whatever it is he says stay away
[time=2455] do not go near the door of her house here we see the part you and I play in this endeavor
[time=2463] to flee lust God can and will empower he will strengthen he will do what he can do to help
[time=2469] us down that road but what can we do what part do we play stay away throw the television
[time=2476] set in the garbage can if you need to chuck it put it in the garage under a blanket throw
[time=2485] it away turn the computer off many in this room would tell you we survived unbelievably
[time=2495] well 30 years ago without him and how many more how many more men how many more husbands
[time=2503] how many more dads have to go down the tank how many more women have to leave families for some internet buddy for us to come to the realization that you know what you may need to at some point in time stay away you know who she is you know who he is you know who
[time=2524] represents for you potential and possibility for struggle keep it appropriate stay miles
[time=2532] stay thousands of miles away from the hint of compromise whatever it is you've got to
[time=2540] do I want to say this and this is what I want you to hear me say more than anything you know in just these last couple of minutes as we've talked about staying away more than anything please hear me say this whatever you have to do do it and however hard listen now however
[time=2556] hard you have to fight fight it however high you have to reach up whoever you have to ask
[time=2563] bring the fight don't let it go keep moving forward whatever you do don't stop and cave
[time=2572] keep fighting keep fighting keep asking why do I say that so intently well I read Matthew
[time=2582] 5 this week again and in Matthew 5 I got just kind of shell shocked all over again every
[time=2588] time I read it it just hits me like a ton of bricks look what it says in Matthew 5 20 28 and 29 Jesus himself said it in this way everyone who looks on a woman to lust for
[time=2599] her has committed adultery with her already in his heart and if your right eye makes you
[time=2605] stumble what does it say now say it louder pluck it out tear it out if your right eye
[time=2613] Jesus said makes you stumble tear it out and throw it from you for here you go for it
[time=2619] is better for you that one of the parts of your body perish than for your whole body to be thrown into hell it's what it says and I know that even as I say it to you it
[time=2636] may all of a sudden raise questions in your mind who what is he really saying there you know what I'm saying I'm saying what this says I am simply telling you and reminding
[time=2645] you again of what this says and sometimes see you lose sight and I do too of how important this issue is because it says there better to go to heaven with one eye than to go to
[time=2656] hell with two and that's not a paraphrase and that's not me kind of no that's what it
[time=2665] says now why does it say that well when you look into it you begin to understand it better
[time=2672] first Peter to write these down first Peter to verse 11 says that lust wages war against
[time=2679] the soul the very core of our spiritual being lust it says wages war against the soul Paul
[time=2689] listed immorality and impurity and evil passion and then said in Colossians 1 3 that on account
[time=2696] of these things the wrath of God will come write this one down in Galatians 5 19 to 21
[time=2703] Paul mentions immorality impurity and sensuality defined as lustful living and says of those
[time=2710] things that those who practice these things those who live a pattern of life described
[time=2717] by these things will not inherit the Kingdom of God and the writer of Hebrews says in chapter
[time=2727] 12 verse 14 that those who do not pursue holiness will not see the Lord Jesus wasn't saying that
[time=2736] lust would entirely vanish as we do that he wasn't saying lust would entirely vanish he
[time=2743] said that the evidence listen to this now please don't miss this he says in essence that the evidence of being saved the evidence of true saving faith the evidence that that your life
[time=2755] and mine is heaven bound is that we gouge out our eye rather than settle rather than settle
[time=2764] for a pattern of lust you see that I believe he's talking about the fight I believe he's
[time=2773] describing true saving faith as a faith that fights and it fights until the very end it
[time=2779] doesn't give up it keeps moving forward and it may be a confusing and difficult fight but
[time=2785] you got to keep fighting and as one fellow fighter to the other I am pleading with you
[time=2791] again this morning to keep fighting and as one who has seen the ugliness and the destruction
[time=2800] and the absolute turmoil that this battle brings when people give up the fight as one
[time=2806] personally who's experienced that and as one who sees it week after week after week I am
[time=2814] begging you to keep fighting to not ever ever give up and to ask as many people for help
[time=2822] as you may need to ask but true saving faith keeps up the fight secondly back to Proverbs
[time=2834] 5 one stay away to listen to and take in the word of God listen to the word of God give
[time=2845] yourself to those that teach it look at what it says in Proverbs 5 excuse me or is it
[time=2852] 5 yeah 5 back to verse 11 says in verse 11 and you groan describing the ugly end of this
[time=2864] endeavor in verse 11 it says and you groan at your latter end when your flesh and your
[time=2871] body are consumed and you say how I have hated instruction and my heart spurned reproof
[time=2879] instruction and reproof again words commonly used to describe for you and me that which comes from this book oh it says how I have hated instruction my heart has spurned reproof
[time=2894] and I have not listened to the voice of my teachers nor inclined my ear to my instructors
[time=2905] and I'm one of your teachers I'm not your only teacher I'm one of your teachers and I am begging you this morning to deepen your love for God to deepen your love for God to
[time=2916] talk to him more to listen to him more to read him more study him more sing him more memorize
[time=2922] him serve him saturate yourself with him deepen your love for him and your heart gets bigger
[time=2932] sing him memorize him study him take him in and your heart gets bigger and stronger and softer and set on him and then and only then when the trial comes and the voice of the
[time=2943] enemy says do this go there endurance can be the choice when the heart is in that position
[time=2950] love for God can be the choice faithfulness to your family can be the choice listen to
[time=2958] the words of John Piper as he describes the powerful effect God's word has in the fight
[time=2964] against lust you ever wondered how this book you know that we hold in our hands and that
[time=2970] sits on our shells and that positions itself there on our desk I mean wherever yours is
[time=2976] wherever mine is we sometimes think about it as a book but understand again this morning through the words of this author what a powerful tool this can be used of God to help fight
[time=2987] a very very important battle Piper says this the role of God's word listen the role of God's word is to feed faiths appetite for God and in doing this it weans my heart away
[time=3000] from the deceptive taste of lust at first lust begins to trick me into feeling that I would
[time=3006] really miss out on some great satisfaction if I follow the path of purity but then I take
[time=3014] up the sword of the spirit the word of God and begin to fight I read in this that it is better to gouge out my eye than to lust I read in this that if I think about things that
[time=3025] are pure and lovely and excellent the peace of God will be with me Philippians 4 I read
[time=3031] that setting the mind on the flesh brings death but setting the mind on the spirit brings life and peace Romans 8 I read that lust wages war against my soul first Peter 2 and that
[time=3042] the pleasures of this life choke out the life of the spirit Luke 8 but best of all I read
[time=3048] in this book that God withholds no good thing from those who walk uprightly Psalm 84 and
[time=3054] that the pure in heart that the pure in heart will seek God Matthew 5 as I pray for my faith
[time=3064] to be satisfied with God's life and peace the sort of the spirit the word of God God carves the sugar coating off the poison of lust I see it for what it is and by the grace
[time=3075] of God it's alluring power is broken I wield the word of God against the sin of lust by
[time=3082] believing the promise of God more than I believe the promise of lust with all eternity hanging
[time=3092] in the balance we fight the fight of faith our chief enemy listen our chief enemy is the
[time=3099] lie that says sin will make our future happier our chief weapon is the truth of God's word
[time=3105] that says God will make our future happier and faith is the victory that overcomes the lie because faith is satisfied with God this is not just a book that you're to grab on
[time=3122] the way out Sunday morning no we see again and again and again people week after week
[time=3129] as we dig and plow and study through this great gift we see I see and you see that it is something that brings life it is something that brings reminders it is something that brings insight and conviction and you have got to understand it know it feel it live
[time=3146] it embrace it you got to stay away you have got to with this help make radical choices
[time=3155] even to stay away you have got to listen and take in this that brings life and thirdly
[time=3161] and I'll leave you with this thirdly you will lose with lust I've said it twice already
[time=3168] I want to just say it to you as we close and I guess I just want to say it to you again because it seems as if sometimes people aren't listening you ever feel that way and not that
[time=3181] I see more of it than you do and part of it made me my own struggle that I share in with
[time=3187] you but I just feel at times as if there's an awful lot of us not listening you will lose
[time=3199] and not because I say so but because this says so you will lose with lust go back to Proverbs just flip over a page to Proverbs 6 Proverbs 6 I'm going to pick it up in verse
[time=3212] 20 and we'll go to verse 29 listen here as we go my son my son observed the commandment
[time=3223] of your father and do not forsake the teaching of your mother bind them continually on your heart tie them around your neck when you walk about they will guide you when you sleep they will watch over you and when you awake they will talk to you for the commandment is a lamp and the teaching is light and reproves for discipline of the way of life what for keep
[time=3246] this bind this tie this continually around your life why junior high student high school
[time=3254] student young married adult young the old why to keep you from the evil woman or to keep
[time=3264] you from the evil man or to keep you from the evil thing you can say it anyway to keep
[time=3272] you from the evil woman from the smooth tongue of the adulterous do not desire her beauty in your heart nor let her catch you with her eyelids for on account of a harlot one is reduced to a loaf of bread for an adulterous hunts for the precious life can a man take fire in his bosom and his clothes not be burned or can a man walk on hot coals and his feet

[time=3304] touches her will not go unpunished whoever touches him will not go unpunished whoever
[time=3310] touches it you will lose and I don't want to lose and I don't want you to lose.
[time=3323] I want you to experience life as God intended it and whatever you have to do wherever you
[time=3332] have to go whatever you have to say do it say it go there ask for it and keep up the
[time=3340] fight amen amen why don't you stand with me let's close in a word of prayer
[time=3353] Father we stand together this morning as a people I hope in my heart at least I hope
[time=3364] we stand as a people who have again been because of what your word says and because
[time=3371] of its clarity I hope that we stand as a people who have been humbled I hope that we
[time=3377] stand this morning as a people who have been exposed for what we are and in many cases
[time=3384] what we are is a people dangerously close to an edge dangerously close to a cliff dangerously
[time=3392] close to a fall that will hurt so many people will confuse so many young minds wrecks so
[time=3400] much have it bring so much destruction and God we need your help we need the spirit of
[time=3407] God and the word of God and the people of God to come alongside we need to be receptive
[time=3413] and open even maybe some in the room this morning pursuant of those things aggressively
[time=3419] pursuant to say to them help I need someone I need somebody and maybe even more than one
[time=3429] I need a few to hang on to me and be a constant reminder of what is right I need someone
[time=3435] to remind me of what God's word said I need an ability an understanding a better realization
[time=3441] of what it means to really give myself to the word of God I need help and encouragement
[time=3448] and reminders and accountability and whether that's a student a housewife a husband or
[time=3455] a grandfather God I pray that this morning there would be a humility of heart and mind that would run through this place that would understand and see how very important it is that we fight this battle to the very end with as much strength as we can muster and
[time=3472] all the help God that you can bring and my prayer is God that we would do it together
[time=3478] and that we would do it honestly and with our eyes fixed on you the perfecter and the
[time=3488] grower and the the one who continues to stretch and strengthen our faith God continue your
[time=3494] work and our hearts in this area in your son's name we pray amen.
[time=3524] the world.
