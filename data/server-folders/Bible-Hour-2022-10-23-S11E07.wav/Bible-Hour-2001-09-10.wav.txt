[time=30] Well, what a week for all of us.
[time=38] As we move towards our worship this morning, would you allow me, please, to read a small
[time=45] portion of what Dr. Billy Graham said this past week.
[time=52] We all watched in horror as planes crashed into the steel and the glass of the World Trade Center.
[time=58] Those majestic towers built on a solid foundation were examples of the prosperity and creativity
[time=64] of America.
[time=67] When damaged, those buildings eventually plummeted to the ground, imploding upon themselves.
[time=73] Yet underneath the debris is a foundation that was not destroyed.
[time=78] Therein lies the truth of that old hymn, how firm a foundation.
[time=83] Yes, our nation has been attacked.
[time=88] Things destroyed and lies lost.
[time=91] But now we have a choice, whether to implode and disintegrate emotionally and spiritually
[time=98] as a people and as a nation, or whether we choose to become stronger through all of this
[time=104] struggle, to rebuild on a solid foundation.
[time=111] That foundation is our trust in God.
[time=117] That's what this service is all about.
[time=120] And in that faith, we have the strength to endure something as difficult and horrendous
[time=126] as what we have experienced this week.
[time=131] Father God, that's what this service is about.
[time=136] Father, we pray now and plead with you now for the strength and the grace to walk through
[time=143] this together, for it's in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[time=173] Come just as you are, hear the spirit call, come just as you are, come and see, come
[time=199] and receive, come and live forever, like heaven has seen, strength for today.
[time=220] Come just as you are, hear the spirit call, come just as you are, come just as you are,
[time=244] come and receive, come and live forever, like heaven has seen, strength for today.
[time=274] It's so good to see your faces, so good to be together, great to be alive, nice to have
[time=287] family, kids to come home to, a church body together with.
[time=295] You don't need me to stand here this morning and convince any of you how grateful we should be for all that we've been given and all that we get to experience day after day.
[time=305] So this morning, before we continue, we want to give you a chance just in your own heart.
[time=309] It's been a long week and maybe your times just with him and the privacy and the quietness
[time=315] of your own soul have been scarce and so right now I'm going to ask if you would just right where you are, just bow your heads, just close your eyes and just take a minute and there may be some things that you just might want to, might need to say to him this morning.
[time=332] We learned a few weeks ago how very important confession is as we move into times of worship,
[time=339] worshiping him in spirit and in truth and you may this morning just, may need to just spend
[time=345] some time getting some things straight, getting some things right with him.
[time=351] You may also want to just take a moment and pray for those across this land and specifically
[time=357] back on the East Coast, you know, and I know there are many today who face this day with
[time=364] lives that have been shattered facing great grief and loss and we need to pray for them,
[time=373] for comfort and for peace and with your heads bowed and your eyes closed you may also want
[time=379] to just take a minute and pray for them.
[time=381] The one thing that God sometimes does, you know, people ask why all the suffering, why all the sorrow, why does God allow certain things to transpire?
[time=392] Then you know, we'll get a lot of questions answered someday but we do know this, I mean
[time=398] you've seen it and I've seen it, God sometimes uses crises, trial and tribulation to draw
[time=405] people to himself and so pray that as well, just take a minute, lift those words and
[time=412] those thoughts to him.
[time=415] Father, this morning we thank you from the bottom of our hearts for the privilege of
[time=422] praying, even, communicating, those things that are on our hearts, God those things that we face and have to interact with God, we can bring it all to you, lay it at your feet and know that it rests there at the feet of one who is so very wise, so very loving,
[time=437] perfect in all that he does and allows.
[time=441] And Father, this morning we pray that as we continue in our worship that our hearts would be right and that as you've invited us to come, just as we are, offering strength for
[time=453] today, life everlasting.
[time=456] But in the midst of all that we have faced this week, in the midst of all that life brings,
[time=462] our prayer is that your truth, this morning, would compel us to worship you from the bottom of our hearts in spirit, with passion and in truth, God we love you and we look forward
[time=475] to what you have for us today, in your son's name we pray, amen.
[time=488] Here in the spirit hall, come just as you are, come and sing, come receive, come and
[time=510] sing forever, life everlasting, safe for today, safe for today, safe for living
[time=531] for today, safe for today, safe for today, safe for today, safe for today, safe for
[time=950] in a corner in fear. And to all the above I would suggest to you today no. No, no, no.
[time=957] Let's not go there. Let's not as a pattern and let's not be marked as a people that would do or give ourselves to any of the above. No, today I would say to each of you that we need to go instead to the one thing, to the one thing, and
[time=972] the only thing that Psalm 19 says restores the soul, rejoices the heart,
[time=978] and enlightens the eyes. Psalm 19 says that we should go, and this morning we
[time=985] will, to the word of God. It says in Psalm 19, let me just read this for you, you can turn there if you'd like. God's word calls us to go to the word of God in the
[time=996] midst of all that we face, because the word of God, it says, it uses many different phrases to describe God's word, but it says in Psalm 19 verse 7, the law of the Lord is perfect. Law of the Lord, meaning the word of God. It's perfect. It says restoring the soul. Anybody's soul need restoring this week. The
[time=1016] testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple, the precepts of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart, the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes, the fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever. The judgments, the word of God itself, are true, they are righteous all together, they are more desirable than gold, yes than much fine gold, sweeter also than honey, and the
[time=1040] drippings of the honeycomb, moreover by them, by the words of God, thy servant is warned, and in keeping them, in keeping them, in obeying them, in following them.
[time=1054] These words of God, Scriptures tell us there is great reward. And to those
[time=1062] mourning today, the loss of family, loved ones and friends, to those from Manhattan, to Washington, to Fort Wayne, Indiana, to those all across this scared and confused
[time=1073] land, and to every one of you this morning. As we turn to God's word, in the
[time=1079] midst of all that we've seen, we find God's word in Psalm 46 saying this. We find
[time=1086] God's word in Psalm 46 verse 1 saying God is our refuge and strength. God is our
[time=1096] refuge and strength. I want to invite you this morning to look with me at this
[time=1102] amazing Psalm, 11 verses that I hope will, and as it has with me this week, I
[time=1109] hope it will for you this morning bring a timely reminder. And so you all over
[time=1115] again, or maybe this morning for the first time, the kind of God, the kind of
[time=1122] Father, the kind of King, the kind of ruler, the kind of Lord that we serve.
[time=1126] This morning we're going to see some things in Psalm 46 that God is. And I hope
[time=1132] as you look at these things, your heart and your spirit and your soul will be refreshed. If you sense this morning, growing levels of fear or insecurity or
[time=1142] unsettledness or uncertainty, and if you're eight years old or if you are eighty years old, my hope is that a look at this chapter, a look at the words of the
[time=1152] Psalmist here will remind all of us. The God is our refuge and our strength.
[time=1158] Several things I want you to write down today. The first one found right here in the first verse. Number one, write this down. God, people, God is close. Write it
[time=1171] down and don't forget it, God is close. Verse one says, God is our refuge and strength of very present help in trouble. Look at that verse. He is our refuge and
[time=1182] strength of very present help in trouble. He is a refuge. He is a refuge. Write this
[time=1191] down. That word refuge in the Hebrew language, which is what the Old Testament was written in. That word refuge means a protection, a shelter in danger and
[time=1201] distress, a protection, a shelter for you and for me, for those that know him, a
[time=1208] protection and shelter in danger and distress. And please note the obvious, but note it, okay? God is our refuge. And in times like this, it's so good to be
[time=1220] reminded of that. So good to think through that yet again. He and He alone is your
[time=1227] protection and shelter in danger and distress. Not reinforce skyscrapers, not armies, not modern-day security or metal detectors. No, God and God alone is our
[time=1240] refuge and our strength. I love that short little phrase that kind of concludes
[time=1246] that first verse. Some things I want to make sure that we see again here.
[time=1250] It says he is a very, a very present help in trouble. Again, you'd have to
[time=1258] see it in the Hebrew to catch the emphasis, but then you kind of see it as you read there. People, he's not just, he's not just a help. He's not just a
[time=1268] help. He's a very, he's not just a present help. No, he is a very, very
[time=1274] present help. There is no if, ands, or buts about it. He is a very, very present
[time=1283] help. Look how that verse ends in trouble. It may seem obvious to some, but it says
[time=1289] in, a very present help in trouble. This verse assumes that we will face what?
[time=1298] What? Trouble. Any way around it? You guys? Any way around it? Any way we can avoid it?
[time=1309] Any way under it? Any way at all in this life? Any way at all in this life, you and
[time=1316] I are going to in some way, shape, or form of void tribulation, trial, trouble, pain,
[time=1322] heartache, distress, confusion. Any way? Yes or no? No. Look at John 1633. Some may
[time=1330] know the verse, some may not, but turn there if you would back to the New Testament just to reinforce that, okay? Write this one down. Put it in your Bible, write it in your notebook, put it on your note page. Be reminded today of what you just all answered to, and you were right. There is no way around it. John 1633, Jesus himself said these very words. He says in John 16 verse 33, he says that
[time=1357] painful and confusing times are a given. These things I have spoken to you, verse 33,
[time=1363] that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. He says
[time=1372] to his friends here at the end of the 16th chapter, in me and me alone you will have and can't have experience a peace like you've never known. In the world, no, no, no, understand, you will have tribulation. It isn't going to go well.
[time=1389] It's not going to be pretty. You will face pain, confusion, strife. In the world
[time=1397] you will have tribulation and look how that verse ends, but take courage. Take
[time=1404] courage. He says to you, every one of you, and he says to me, and he says to those
[time=1411] that were gathered here, do you know me? Take courage, because you're in me and I'm
[time=1418] in you and I have what? Over come the world. It's going to be an ugly world. It's
[time=1425] going to be a painful world. It's going to be a world at times that makes absolutely no sense, but take courage, because I have overcome the world. People,
[time=1435] He is close. Did you write it down? Remember that. Don't let go of that. Call
[time=1441] it back to your mind again and again and again. Tell your kids again and again and again. Praise Him. Thank Him again and again and again because He is a close God, a very present help. Jesus says our Father who art in heaven in the Lord's
[time=1456] prayer there. Heard it again, heard it before, heard it again this week. Our Father who art in heaven. It's great that Greek word there for heaven, as it is normally, and I think correctly translated, that refers to a place which He has prepared. In the Greek language there was a secondary meaning for that Greek word used for heaven. Guess what that word means in the English. Air. Air.
[time=1483] Our Father who art in heaven. He is so close. He has never left you. He will
[time=1493] never forsake you and see what happens is humanly speaking. We would think, I would think, even in there were moments this Tuesday when I thought He had left some. You can't help but in your humanness look at that and begin to feel like somehow some way. Yeah, they were in your hand, but somehow you know they got out of your hand and that's our finite minds kind of kicking into gear because we
[time=1516] view being in His hand from such a finite perspective. We view it temporally. He views it what? Eternally. Oh, He is close and He is a present help.
[time=1528] Number two, He is constant. Back to Psalm 46, write it down. He is close. Number
[time=1534] two, He is constant. He is constant, verses two and three. You see it there?
[time=1539] Therefore we will not fear though the earth should change and though the
[time=1545] mountains slip into the heart of the sea, though its waters roar and foam, though the mountains quake at its swelling pride, though everything, right? And it's true.
[time=1559] Weeks like this remind you and I that everything is up for grabs and though everything may change, though everything may fall apart, explode, quake, crumble,
[time=1570] come undone and or be destroyed, He stays the same. He stays the same. He stays
[time=1578] close, a very present help and His constant, never-changing presence, allows
[time=1587] me not to fear. Hebrews 13-8 comes to mind. Jesus, the same what? Yesterday, today
[time=1595] and what? Constant. Constant. He stays close and His constant presence allows me
[time=1607] first part of verse two. I hope it allows you, I hope it moves you to this place, this place where I we will not fear. Something about His presence, something
[time=1620] about the constancy of His presence. A few weeks ago, before school got back
[time=1629] into the, we got back into the the whole school mode, we thought, hey, one last chance, we've got some friends, the backs up at the lake and they said, hey, come on up, bring the kids and so we all piled in, headed up to the lake up there at Lake James and as we've often done in the past, it was time to break out the tubes. We got the boat revved up and we got the tube out there and it was, you know, time to jump in and it was me, I think, and it was Tim and I think my oldest, Russell T. And he got his vest on and he jumped out there and I don't know, Deborah may have been in there or it may have just been one of the girls, but interesting thing with my with my son. A lot of people think that my oldest son, Russell T, is just like me and in some ways he is, but he's really not like
[time=1673] me. Fundamentally, when you get right down to the bottom of who he is, he's his mother. He is, he is cautious. He's not like me. He's careful. Did I say he's not
[time=1684] like me? He's not anything like me. He thinks things through. He calculates the risk. He really sits back and takes stock. He's very much like her in that respect and so out he goes into the tube and you know the slack comes out and we're off and going and I'm sitting there kind of in the boat looking back at him and it becomes pretty clear, pretty quick, that he's not really enjoying himself. And I am enjoying myself because I've got great memories, you know, recent
[time=1713] and long ago of times in the tube where the waves and the weight came and the tube gets airborne and you're laughing and screaming. All caution has been thrown in the wind and you're out there doing it. So I'm over there kind of tapping Tim on the arm going, give him a little bit more and he's out there going, no, no, down, down, down, down. I said, Tim, give it a little turn and he turns it and boom he goes outside the wake and his eyes get big as saucers and he's for, he's convinced he's going to go over but he doesn't. And then he really gets uncomfortable and though I may have been a bit pushy there at first, okay, so I
[time=1748] said it there. You're all sitting there quietly going, he is so pushy. I was
[time=1754] pushy but then I, you know, I always, I reached my limit there and I could see in his eyes. So I just said, hey Tim, why don't you kill it real quick. And as Tim killed the motor and the boat came to a stop, I just jumped up one step onto the top of the engine cover, next step I was in the water. Got a hold of the rope, pulled myself out there and before he could shake his head, I was up on the tube just
[time=1777] right there in his face and he's looking me right in the eye. I said, hey buddy, he said hi dad. I said, I want you to know something. What? I'm right here. He said,
[time=1790] you got here pretty quick dad. I said, I know. See, I'm just right there. Boy, you
[time=1799] got here really quick. He kept saying that. I said, I know it's okay and I'm just slapping him on the back of the head and I said, if you're getting trouble, let me know. But it's okay. I'm right here. It's all countenance changed.
[time=1812] He shook his head and tightened up his vest and I slid back on the rope to the boat, hopped in my seat, said, Tim let her rep and off we went. And he's back there just going, you know, just a little bit. And the little bit became more and the
[time=1830] little bit, you know, went away and then it was just more and then all of a sudden there was a smile and there was laughter. And there was excitement and there was this, you know, this reminder in the midst of that to me of what it means to
[time=1844] know in times of trouble that he is near and he is constant. And in our time of
[time=1852] need, boom. So yeah, it was a great picture. Now, Maddie, who I think was
[time=1858] about with us, it was her turn next. Now, she's like me. She gets out there, whips
[time=1864] her head back. She kind of learned the whole thumbs thing and she just was, you know, constant thumbs up. She's on Russell T's back just with her hand the whole time up in the air like this. Russell's knocking it down going, no, no, no, like this and she's like that. He is close, write it down. He is constant.
[time=1883] Number three, he brings and only he brings confidence. He brings confidence.
[time=1890] What does verse four say? Verse four says, "There is a river whose streams make
[time=1897] glad the city of God. The holy dwelling places of the most high. There is a river
[time=1903] whose streams make glad the city of God." This verse says that divine confidence
[time=1910] and courage, like a smooth flowing, never failing river, brings refreshment, consolation and a renewed hope to those who know him and to those who trust in
[time=1921] him. "The city of God," it says, "is made glad. Cities during Old Testament times
[time=1928] were made panicked. Cities in Old Testament times were made desolate. Cities in Old Testament times were made needy. When enemies would block the flow of water into those cities, oftentimes in those days, cities would be built. Cities and communities would be established near rivers. That was the way they survived. And so in war, what would oftentimes happen is the enemy would come and literally barricade, dam up and block the water supply, thus in essence killing
[time=1957] a city. And with the city of God, reference here to Jerusalem, reference here an
[time=1966] application to us as people. It is not this way. With you and with me, the city of
[time=1973] God is made glad, because there is a river that flows and people understand today that no matter what took place on Tuesday and no matter what may take place next Tuesday, the river of life continues to flow. There are no rocks that can dam it up. There are no changes in the earth that can stop it. And the
[time=1993] city of God, the people of God, are made glad. They are brought confidence and consolation and renewed hope. And I got to ask you this this morning. There's a
[time=2004] lot of you here who I recognize. And as is always the case in times like this, there are those who come into this place looking for that sense of peace, looking for that sense of renewed confidence. And I have for all of you this morning who
[time=2019] are here, one very important question. What is your confidence? What are you
[time=2030] confident in today? What is it that you're banking on? I mean what is it that you've
[time=2038] truly and really and literally when it all gets right down to it, what have you placed your trust in? What is your confidence? Safety? It's all well built
[time=2055] buildings, modern technology, a roof over your head, airline safety, I hope not.
[time=2064] What's your confidence? Is your confidence, listen closely, is your
[time=2070] confidence placed in a misguided notion that he won't allow harm or tragedy to
[time=2076] visit your world? I hope not. I hope not. Understand this morning again, evil, evil
[time=2085] impacts good God honoring people every day. What is your confidence in? And I
[time=2096] would ask you this morning to write down one word. I would ask you this morning and I don't care who you are, where you're at on your spiritual journey, whether you've known them for 30 years or you're here today still seeking, trying to make sense of this thing called face. I've got an answer for you this morning to the question. Our confidence, I'll say it to you this way, my confidence, that which in
[time=2121] the end when it's all said and done I'm banking on is a one-word answer and it's
[time=2127] called heaven. It's called heaven, write it down. That is our confidence, those that
[time=2135] know him. Heaven, eternal life, knowing him, being in relationship with him, that is
[time=2144] our confidence, heaven. Eternal life, look with me, I think it'll be on the screen. Look at Hebrews back towards the end of your New Testament. Hebrews, last part of the verse, last part of the book chapter 10 says it so very well. The
[time=2161] writer of Hebrews and here's what's so great about this text is the writer of Hebrews is actually speaking to writing to people who have been through great suffering and they are in the midst of great torment and strife and he says to them in Hebrews 10. Pick it up in verse 35 it says therefore in light of all that
[time=2179] you've been through and all that you faced and all that you have endured he says in verse 35 and I say to you this morning therefore do not throw away your confidence which has a great reward for you have need of endurance so that when
[time=2195] you have done the will of God you may receive what was promised. Verse 37 here
[time=2201] a quote from Habakkuk for yet in a very little while he who is coming will come and will not delay but my righteous one shall live by faith and if he shrinks
[time=2212] back my soul has no pleasure in him but verse 39 we're not going to do that are we he says no we are not of those who shrink back the destruction but of those who have faith those who have confidence not because of us and all
[time=2228] that we can muster but simply and only because of him those who have faith to
[time=2234] the preserving of the soul. It's weeks like this and the pictures that we see
[time=2242] on the television screen the stories the stories that we continue to hear.
[time=2249] It's days like this that I'm reminded personally of those first century Christians we've studied them in our look at the book of Acts we've talked about them many times before. My mind goes back to what the history books not even the Bible what the history books record for us about those people that special brave courageous band of Christ followers who in the first century were
[time=2273] tortured and killed torn limb from limb by by lions in the Colosseum in Rome
[time=2279] dipped in tar and lit used as tiki torches in the gardens of Nero and history
[time=2286] books record that these first century believers walked willingly into the Colosseum were bound and tied and dipped in tar with looks of courage and grace
[time=2298] and peace on their faces. How does that happen? How is that kind of attitude how
[time=2308] is that kind of mindset attained what would allow what would allow you I know
[time=2318] many of you thought this I thought it once I heard about the whole cell phone
[time=2324] thing going on from the planes I thought oh my goodness what must that have been
[time=2330] like what would that be like and what would allow you or myself to be on a
[time=2340] cell phone on a plane headed for a building and speak with hope and clarity and bravery and love in my voice not that it wasn't gonna be hard or even
[time=2352] painful but what would it be like to have a confidence that comes knowing
[time=2359] it in the next second we would be with him in a place where there are no more
[time=2367] tears in a place where there is no more weeping in a place where there is no more pain what's your confidence and to what degree do you experience it know
[time=2380] it today in your everyday life when our kids go to the doctor as your kids have gone to the doctor you when you go to the doctor and I go to the doctor you know we get shots every once in a while for a while there you know I was learning I still am as a parent but there were times when I wasn't quite sure how to handle that so I would somehow try and talk to these little minds about how it wasn't gonna hurt and then I think one day I realized you know what it's gonna hurt and so I've taken a whole new tack lately and I just tell them
[time=2413] what maybe you'd tell them you know what it's gonna hurt but just for a what just
[time=2421] for a what just for a little bit and then after it hurts for a little bit you're gonna be what gonna be okay and whether we're talking about a shot well
[time=2434] whether we're talking about you and I facing eternity yeah in the end you know what it might hurt that may be painful extremely confusing somewhat scary but
[time=2444] there's a confidence that only he brings that allows people like you and me and others to face times like this with a sense of you know what it's gonna be alright it's gonna be alright number four he maintains control write it down he
[time=2459] maintains control I love this verses 5 to 7 so I'm 46 verses 5 to 7 says this
[time=2469] God God is in the midst of her she will not nor will he be moved God will help
[time=2475] her when morning dawns again referring to the city of God back in verse 4 the people of God is in the midst of her she will not be moved God will help her when morning dawns the nations verse 6 made an uproar the kingdoms tottered he raised his voice the earth melted the Lord of hosts is with us the God of Jacob is our
[time=2497] stronghold I want to just point out a couple things to you found it very very interesting this past week to be shown again something that you only pick up
[time=2510] in the Hebrew here in Psalm 46 I want to draw your attention watch this this is great stuff go back to verse 2 therefore we will not fear though the earth should
[time=2520] change that word change there just kind of make a note there though the earth should change circle it or just kind of put a line underneath it then go down to verse go down to second part of verse 2 and though the mountains slip see that
[time=2536] word slip again make a little note there though the earth should change though the mountains slip look at verse 3 though its waters roar and foam though the
[time=2546] mountains quake make a little note there on that word quake though the earth
[time=2552] should change though the mountains slip and though the mountains would quake at its swelling pride and then go down to verse 6 the nations made an uproar the
[time=2563] kingdoms tottered you see that tottered underline that word make a note kingdoms
[time=2569] tottered now watch this all those words I just had you mark in the Hebrew
[time=2576] language all of those words are the same Hebrew word which means when
[time=2583] translated to shake violently to come undone to be destroyed to shake
[time=2589] violently to come undone to be destroyed and in these verses that I just pointed out to you we see things undone shaking violently being destroyed things you never imagined being destroyed the earth changing the mountains slipping and
[time=2606] quaking kingdoms tottering all the same word now watch this look back at verse
[time=2612] 5 what a great reminder God verse 5 God is in the midst of her and she will not
[time=2621] be he will not be moved make a little note there on the word moved did you do
[time=2630] it you see that word moved will not be moved guess what moved is same Hebrew
[time=2636] word this time in the negative though kingdoms will tottered though mountains
[time=2643] may slip guess what people he will not be moved he will not shake violently he
[time=2650] will not come undone he cannot be destroyed God's presence is immovable
[time=2658] immovable number five he is God write it down he is close oh this is good to see
[time=2668] good to read good to be reminded of people he is close he is constant he brings confidence he maintains control and lastly he is God he alone is God look
[time=2683] at verse 8 down through 11 come behold the works of the Lord who has wrought desolations in the earth he makes wars to cease to the end of the earth he breaks the bow cuts the spear in two he burns the chariots with fire verse 10 cease
[time=2699] striving cease striving and no he says that I am God I will be exalted among
[time=2708] the nations I will be exalted in the earth the Lord of hosts is with us the
[time=2715] God of Jacob is our stronghold if it helps you to remember it write some of
[time=2724] these things down I'm about to say in the end he went remember in times where
[time=2732] defeat seems eminent in times where confusion is overwhelming please people
[time=2738] of God this morning remember that in the end he wins and he wins beg he wins
[time=2744] going away he has the last word all of evil get this all of evil is judged and
[time=2753] in the end eternally defeated and let's just look at it just to see it with our
[time=2762] own eyes and hear it with our own ears go back to Revelation chapter 20 back to
[time=2770] Revelation chapter 20 in the end he wins and he wins big he has the last word
[time=2785] all evil is judged and eternally defeated look at Revelation chapter 20 we'll pick
[time=2791] it up in verse 7 you there Revelation 20 verse 7 it says there and when the
[time=2799] thousand years are completed Satan will be released from his prison and will
[time=2805] come out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth God and may God to gather them together for the war the numbers of them is like the sand of the seashore and they came up on the on the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city and fire came down
[time=2825] from heaven and devoured them and the devil who deceived them was thrown into
[time=2831] the lake of fire in brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are also and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever verse 11 and I saw a
[time=2842] great white throne and him who set upon it from whose presence earth and heaven
[time=2849] fled away and no place was found for them look at verse 14 and death and
[time=2857] Hades were thrown into the lake of fire this is the second death the lake of fire verse 15 and if anyone's name was not written in the book of life he was
[time=2867] thrown into the lake of fire people in the end he wins and in the end listen and
[time=2875] in the end though though it may appear to be winning today more than it loses and
[time=2883] we could probably take issue with that in the end evil evil and the culprit
[time=2891] behind evil and those who ascribe to evil and again we ascribe to evil by not
[time=2898] ascribing to God lose and please make no mistake make no mistake about this one
[time=2907] okay and sometimes in days like this it can get difficult to keep it all straight somebody asked me to the day what I thought about all that had transpired what did I attribute it to what took place this week is a result of
[time=2925] the fact people that we live in an evil world period end of discussion and
[time=2933] there's lots of manifestations of evil that's true and a lot of those in time will be judged but please understand that what happened this week is simply and only the result not of God's judgment on some organization or group of people
[time=2949] no it's a result of evil we live in a fallen evil sick twisted world and things
[time=2958] like this will keep happening and who got judges and how he judges and when he
[time=2965] judges I'll leave that to him how dare you or I or anyone else think that we've
[time=2971] got it figured out when God's who God's no we live in an evil world and these
[time=2978] things will continue to happen in ours our our places to respond in a way that
[time=2985] evidences and shows our faith and our trust in a God who is close who is constant who brings confidence who maintains control and you know what the
[time=2996] fact that he is God the fact that he maintains control brings confidence and
[time=3002] is close it allows every one of us in this room this morning who knows him to
[time=3008] respond to verse 10 back to Proverbs excuse me Psalm 46 because God is all
[time=3014] that we've said this morning and only because he's that we can respond positively
[time=3024] in obedience to what he says in verse 10 cease striving you know what that means
[time=3031] you guys in the vernacular of our day you know what it means if I were going to say it to you like we would say it today it would basically be God looking us in the heart and in the eye and saying relax chill take it down a notch it's
[time=3048] gonna be all right cease striving don't panic don't scratch and claw don't lose
[time=3055] sleep pray live lives of obedience exercise compassion do whatever you do
[time=3062] can do to extend acts of kindness stay close to me walk with me but relax down
[time=3069] deepen your hearts cease striving because why and know that I am God and in the
[time=3076] end I will be exalted among the nations I will be exalted in the earth and I
[time=3083] hope this morning I hope for every one of you that kind of confidence the
[time=3091] ability to cease striving hear me now only comes only comes in knowing him
[time=3100] that's it panic fear insecurity unsettleness you can't and I can't help
[time=3110] but feeling but feel and experience those things we can't help but be overrun by those things when we don't know him because we can only see striving when we stop and know him know that he is God and that is my hope for every one of you
[time=3127] here this morning you know what if we can pray with you today if we can talk with you today if there's anything we can talk about today before you leave this place we would love to do so be happy to do so I'm gonna ask Scott to
