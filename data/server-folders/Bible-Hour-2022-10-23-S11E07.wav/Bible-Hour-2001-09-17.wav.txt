[time=89] His grace was the only thing that mattered.
[time=92] It didn't matter about my sins or my past.
[time=95] His grace was sufficient and covered everything.
[time=98] God's grace to me is His continued faithfulness to me
[time=104] and desire to use me, even though I'm unfaithful.
[time=109] Throughout my life, in times of struggle and weakness, His grace has strengthened and sustained me.
[time=115] His grace means having the strength to wake up every morning and love people.
[time=121] His grace is so amazing to me to imagine He could forgive me for what I've done.
[time=127] In his book, "What's So Amazing About Grace,"
[time=136] Philip the Ancy says this, "One of Jesus' stories about grace made it into three different gospels and slightly different versions." My favorite version, though, Yancy says, appeared in another source entirely.
[time=149] The Boston Globes account in June 1990 of a most unusual wedding banquet.
[time=156] Accompanyed by her fiance, a woman went to the Hyatt Hotel in downtown Boston and ordered the meal.
[time=161] The two of them poured over the menu, made selections of China and silver, and pointed to pictures of the flower arrangements they liked.
[time=168] They both had expensive taste, and the bill came to $13,000.
[time=172] After leaving a check for half that amount as a down payment, the couple went home to flip through books of wedding announcements.
[time=178] The day the announcements were supposed to hit the mailbox, the potential groom got cold feet.
[time=183] "I'm just not sure," he said.
[time=185] "It's a big commitment.
[time=186] Let's think about it a little longer.
[time=187] I need more time." When his angry fiance returned to the Hyatt to cancel the banquet, the events manager could not have been more understanding.
[time=195] The same thing happened to me, honey, she said, and told the story of her own broken engagement.
[time=200] But about the refund, she had bad news.
[time=203] The contract is binding.
[time=204] You're only entitled to $1,300 back, and that leaves you with two options.
[time=210] To forfeit the rest of the down payment or go ahead with the banquet.
[time=214] I'm sorry, I really am.
[time=216] It seemed crazy to the young lady, but the more the jilted bride thought about it, the more she liked the idea of going ahead with the party.
[time=225] Not a wedding banquet, mind you, but a big blowout.
[time=229] You see, ten years before, this same woman had been living in a homeless shelter.
[time=233] She had gotten back on her feet, found a good job, instead of sight, a sizable nest egg.
[time=237] Now she had the wild notion of using her savings to treat the down and outs of Boston to a night in the town.
[time=243] And so it was that in June of 1990, the Hyatt Hotel in downtown Boston hosted a party such as it had never seen before.
[time=250] "The host has changed the menu to boneless chicken in honor of the groom," she said.
[time=255] [ Laughter ] And sent invitations to rescue missions and homeless shelters across the city.
[time=263] That warm summer night, people who were used to peeling half-nawed pizza off the cardboard, dined instead on chicken cord ome blue.
[time=272] Hyatt waiters and tuxedos served hors d'oeuvres to senior citizens, propped up by crutches and aluminum walkers.
[time=278] Bag ladies, vagrants, and addicts took one night off from the hard life on the sidewalks outside and instead experienced grace.
[time=289] They sipped champagne, a chocolate wedding cake, and danced to big band melodies late into the night.
[time=298] And that is what is so amazing about grace.
[time=303] [MUSIC]
[time=310] Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch by me.
[time=330] But once was lost but now and now was by but now I see
[time=351] was great sent off my heart to fear and raised my fears really how precious it that brings our own view.
[time=381] We now are our first believe.
[time=391] We've been there 10,000 years bright shining as the star
[time=409] of our world we've no less days to sing our praise and when we first be young.
[time=431] What do we stand together and listen to this passage of Christ's God who is rich in mercy made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions.
[time=453] It is by grace you have been saved.
[time=459] God raised us up with Christ you have been saved through faith.
[time=472] And this not from yourselves is the gift of God.
[time=481] Maybe today, wherever you're at, you've never experienced that.
[time=487] And I would challenge you just to listen to the words in this song of Christ.
[time=496] I gave His life for you, for me, as a sacrifice and a gift.
[time=506] Let's sing those again.
[time=509] Amazing grace how sweet the sound of Christ's God was lost but now and now I see we've been there ten thousand years bright shining
[time=553] as the sun.
[time=558] We've no less days to sing us great than when we first be dead.
[time=578] Lord Jesus, I pray this morning that we would all, everyone in this place today, understand that your grace is amazing.
[time=591] And we praise you for that.
[time=593] And Lord now please fill Kelly with the spirit and the words and the wisdom to teach us and to grow us.
[time=602] And Lord, may we take what we learn and apply it to our life.
[time=606] In the name of Jesus, we pray amen.
[time=612] You know, back in John 9 in the Gospels, we read about a miraculous encounter.
[time=620] A miraculous encounter between a blind man and the son of God.
[time=625] And what Jesus did, what the son of God did, in that encounter with that blind man.
[time=632] What Jesus did in that situation brought sight and a deepened faith.
[time=638] The blind man, what he did, well, he made the Pharisees mad.
[time=642] That's right, he made the Pharisees mad just by looking at them.
[time=646] You see, in their rigid world, blind men were blind because they were sinners.
[time=650] And sinners like that in their world didn't get second chances.
[time=656] But what bothered them most was that he had gained his sight.
[time=660] According to the blind man's own testimony, there in John 9 11, he said the man who was called Jesus made clay.
[time=668] And anointed my eyes and said to me, "Go to Silom and wash, and so I went away and washed, and I received sight." But the Pharisees said, "Wait a minute, hold on.
[time=681] This was the Sabbath they thought.
[time=683] Everyone knew that making clay, everyone knew that being on the Sabbath was sinful.
[time=690] Therefore Jesus was, in their estimation, a sinner.
[time=692] And sinners couldn't perform miracles, so this had to be some kind of hoax.
[time=697] "Give glory to God," they said to this man who had just received his sight.
[time=703] "Give glory to God," they said, imploring him to confess.
[time=706] We know that this man Jesus is a sinner.
[time=709] You see that down in verse 24, to where they say that.
[time=712] We know this man Jesus in a sinner.
[time=715] My love is response.
[time=717] I love his response in the next verse there in verse 25.
[time=722] Can you see him?
[time=724] I can.
[time=725] I can in my minds I see him looking at them, and almost saying to them, "Hey, guys, look at me.
[time=731] I want to make sure you hear this.
[time=733] I want to make sure this is clear." Whether he is a sinner or not, I do not know.
[time=740] But one thing I do know, whereas I was blind, now I what?
[time=748] See, he blinked and just looked at him again.
[time=753] I can see it in my eyes, probably only escalating their anger.
[time=756] You see, the Jewish leaders in Jesus' day were responding in frustration to an unanswerable argument.
[time=763] And that's the beautiful thing about this and what we'll see later here today.
[time=767] They were frustrated by an unanswerable argument.
[time=771] The healed man's testimony contained personal experience plus irrefutable facts, proving beyond doubt that Jesus was the Son of God.
[time=781] Ironically, the Pharisees who had healthy eyes couldn't even see the truth.
[time=786] In our passage today, in the book of Acts, as we make our way back to this great book that we've been looking at over the months, Paul is standing before yet another spiritually blind group of people at the temple.
[time=798] He is about to tell them how he used to be like them but now sees.
[time=803] He will not use heavy theology or brilliant logic.
[time=806] And like the blind man in Jesus' day, the argument of his changed life will be for them unanswerable.
[time=814] Let's look together at Acts.
[time=816] Into chapter 21, first part of 22.
[time=820] It's been a while since we've been back in our study of Acts in the next month or so.
[time=824] We hope to conclude it.
[time=825] And this morning we kind of picked back up where we left off, Acts 21, 22, as we see Paul.
[time=831] And we will see him and you will see him and I hope we will be challenged this morning as we watch him modeling for us verbal evangelism.
[time=839] Write that down somewhere on your sheet.
[time=841] Paul will be modeling for us in this interchange a great picture, kind of a picture in its purest form of verbal evangelism.
[time=851] Verbal evangelism in its purest most powerful form.
[time=855] First, let's set the stage.
[time=857] Look with me back at verses 35 through 39 of Acts 21 where Paul has finally made his way back to Jerusalem and what turned out to be a less than receptive welcome.
[time=871] Acts 21, 35.
[time=872] And when he got to the stairs, it so happened that he was carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the mob.
[time=879] For the multitude of the people kept following behind crying out away with him.
[time=883] They wanted him dead.
[time=885] And as Paul was about to be brought into the barracks he says to the commander, "May I say something to you?" And he said, "Do you know Greek?" Then you are not the Egyptian who some time ago stirred up a revolt and led the 4,000 men of the assassins out into the wilderness.
[time=900] Paul said, "I am a Jew." But Paul said, "I am a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city, and I beg you, allow me to speak to the people." At the stairs leading to the barracks, Paul asks for a chance and is given the chance to address a hostile violent crowd still calling out for his death.
[time=923] So watch this now, right out of the gate.
[time=925] Watch this.
[time=926] When given the opportunity.
[time=928] So when given the opportunity, and I want you to ask this question this morning of yourself.
[time=934] And we are going to see a parallel.
[time=936] I hope you will see a parallel as we go through these things that we watch Paul do here in this passage.
[time=940] I hope you will clearly see the application to your life and mind.
[time=945] And we ask the question this morning when given the opportunity, as he is being given here, to speak, when given the chance to share the hope that lived within him, when put in the situation to articulate faith and cast a light on truth for those gripped by darkness, how did he do it?
[time=962] How did he do it?
[time=964] How is he going to go about casting light, casting a light on the truth for those gripped by darkness?
[time=971] How will he posture himself?
[time=973] What will he say?
[time=974] How will he say it?
[time=977] Our passage this morning answers these and many other questions.
[time=981] Let's read and learn as we go.
[time=983] Number one, write this down.
[time=985] Write from the get go.
[time=987] Look what he does.
[time=988] Verses 21, 40 through the fifth verse of the 22nd chapter.
[time=994] It says, "And when he had given him permission, and when he had given him permission, Paul standing on the stairs motion to the people with his hand, when there was a great hush, he spun, when there was a great hush, he spoke to them in the Hebrew dialect saying, brethren, and fathers, hear my defense, which I now offer to you.
[time=1015] And when they heard that he was addressing them in the Hebrew dialect, they became even more quiet.
[time=1020] And he said, I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Solicia, and brought up in this city, educated under Gamaliel, strictly according to the law of our fathers, being zealous for God just as you all are today.
[time=1034] And I persecuted this way." Again, that phrase this way, referring to the early Christian church, "and I persecuted this way to the death, binding and putting both men and women into prisons, as also the high priest and all the counsel of the elders can testify.
[time=1052] From them I also received letters to the brethren and started off for Damascus in order to bring even those who were there to Jerusalem as prisoners to be punished." Stop right there.
[time=1066] Write this down, verbal evangelism, a chance to cast light in a dark place, a chance to begin to discuss things that really matter.
[time=1076] Number one thing he does, right from the get-go, he identifies.
[time=1081] He identifies with them.
[time=1086] How did he identify with them?
[time=1088] How can you identify with those that you would share conversation with? How can you and how can I in the opportunities God gives us to cast a light into a dark place to help those far from God begin to understand better truth?
[time=1103] How can we identify with them?
[time=1106] He does a great job.
[time=1107] You know what he did?
[time=1108] He spoke there what?
[time=1110] Say it.
[time=1111] He spoke there what?
[time=1113] Language.
[time=1114] He spoke their language.
[time=1117] Please don't miss that.
[time=1119] He spoke their language.
[time=1121] He used their native tongue.
[time=1123] He used words they could understand.
[time=1127] Do you?
[time=1132] He spoke their language.
[time=1134] He used words they could understand using plain language, not fancy theology or religious jargon.
[time=1141] He makes himself real.
[time=1146] He becomes in some ways to them just a normal guy.
[time=1152] You know, I can tell you in 30 years of watching ministry, in 14, 15 years of doing ministry, there is absolutely, and I would never back down from this.
[time=1166] And I will tell you this this morning and it is my absolute opinion in my heart and my conviction.
[time=1171] There is absolutely nothing I have ever seen God use more powerfully in the realm of communication and ministry.
[time=1177] I mean, aside from his word, which is the beginning point, as far as the communication of it, in the realm of communication and ministry never seen anything used more powerfully than the art of identification, the act of identifying.
[time=1194] People want to know that to some degree their struggles are yours.
[time=1199] They need to know that you have felt their fears, that we have wrestled with their worries, that you have cried their tears, that you have stood in their shoes, that you fought their fights, made the same mistakes they have made and keep making new ones.
[time=1213] People want to know.
[time=1214] People want to sense as we talk with them and as we live life with them, that we understand.
[time=1221] How do you do this?
[time=1224] How do you do this with those in your world?
[time=1228] How do you go about making that kind of effort?
[time=1230] How willing are you to be authentic, to be real?
[time=1235] Or do you still adhere to the notion that pretense and facades will draw them in?
[time=1244] Maybe that's where you're still at this morning.
[time=1246] And we've all heard it before, put on your Sunday face, have no fears, no fantasies, no struggles, no pain, no worries, no disappointments.
[time=1255] And it is a lot easier, isn't it?
[time=1259] It's a whole lot easier to just kind of live life from that perspective.
[time=1263] Less confusion and mess, that's for sure.
[time=1266] And while it's easier to live in a world that's always fine.
[time=1270] How you doing?
[time=1271] Fine.
[time=1272] How's things at home?
[time=1273] Fine.
[time=1274] How's your marriage?
[time=1275] Fine.
[time=1276] Kids, fine.
[time=1278] Work fine.
[time=1280] Investments, fine, liar.
[time=1286] While it's easier to live in a world that's always fine, questioned for you this morning, who's drawn to that?
[time=1295] Who's drawn to that?
[time=1298] Hurting people trying to make sense of life?
[time=1301] No.
[time=1302] Other pretenders.
[time=1304] And if you or if I were to live like that, communicate like that, do ministry like that, fine, everything's good, no worries, no hassles, no struggles.
[time=1318] Then just think about it.
[time=1319] Nobody ever gets to hear.
[time=1322] Nobody ever gets to hear those words that I love hearing.
[time=1325] Wow.
[time=1326] Well, it was like he understood where I live.
[time=1331] If we live like that, nobody ever gets to hear, oh my goodness, it was as if she walked in my shoes.
[time=1339] Unbelievable.
[time=1341] He's faced the same fears and failures I have.
[time=1345] People pure evangelism.
[time=1348] Pure ministry begins when we humble ourselves with others identifying with their humanness, identifying with our humanness and our need for him.
[time=1362] It's kind of challenging for me.
[time=1364] Thinking all this through is the young man just starting out in ministry because there were a couple of different schools of thought on this one.
[time=1372] And there still is.
[time=1374] You see, I was in a place where the school of thought was, and again, it's just kind of the way we got taught.
[time=1380] I was in a place where I remember and they called it sermon prep.
[time=1385] It was where they kind of taught you as young guys going into the ministry.
[time=1390] And I was in a place where you got to see those sermons and taught you communication skills.
[time=1396] And there was a guy in that setting who used to say this, that what he would do is that he would prepare messages every week with the most spiritually theologically minded elite in mind.
[time=1411] He had the privilege of preaching in a church every week where a lot of seminary professors attended.
[time=1417] And so he would preach with those, even with those individuals in mind.
[time=1422] And the idea was that if you would preach to the spiritually elite most mature, that kind of raises the bar and in time everybody else will catch up.
[time=1432] And that's, I think, one way of doing that.
[time=1436] And yet for me personally, as I would sit and listen to that in the back of my mind, I was kind of always going, okay, but wait a second.
[time=1444] What about the ones like down way below the bar?
[time=1449] What about the mom with four kids who's on the verge of an emotional breakdown trying to do two jobs and isn't quite sure if first Samuel's in the old or New Testament.
[time=1460] What about the young man?
[time=1462] You know, I think of myself gripped by addiction who isn't even sure there's even a God.
[time=1468] But yet he's coming and sitting down in those pews.
[time=1471] What about the dad, the husband who's trying his very best to work through the issues in his life, maybe newly saved and trying to just have a quiet time once a week.
[time=1482] And in my mind, I would hear that and I would hear this and I think, you know, somewhere in the middle, there's got to be a balance.
[time=1489] And the balance I've tried to attain the balance I have tried to shoot for when it comes to ministry, when it comes to communication, it's the same balance I would hope you would shoot for and try to attain is that in the middle somewhere there is a good place.
[time=1502] It's called authenticity.
[time=1505] Authenticity.
[time=1507] People be real with your faith.
[time=1511] Don't back away from your faith.
[time=1513] Don't not proclaim your faith.
[time=1515] Don't not study and grow in your understanding of your faith, but with your faith be real and be authentic.
[time=1522] Maybe you have matured tremendously over the years.
[time=1525] Be mature.
[time=1526] Understand this book better and better and better and in your understanding of it, please be real.
[time=1533] And don't ever associate maturity and growth with a life that's always fine because life isn't.
[time=1542] Always fine.
[time=1544] Paul connected.
[time=1546] Right from the get-go here in chapter 22 of Acts, he connects with his audience.
[time=1551] He was authentic.
[time=1552] Number 2, look at verses 6 through 15.
[time=1555] In the end of verse 5, he had mentioned his trip to Damascus to go and bring Christians back to be punished and it came about verse 6 that as I was on my way approaching Damascus about noon time, a very bright light suddenly flashed from heaven all around me.
[time=1572] And I fell verse 7 to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?" And I answered, "Who art thou Lord?" And he said to me, "I am Jesus the Nazarene whom you are persecuting and those who were with me beheld the light to be sure but did not understand the speaking to me." And I said, "What shall I do, Lord?" And the Lord said to me, "Arise and go into Damascus and there you will be told of all that has been appointed for you to do." But since I could not see because of the brightness of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me and came into Damascus and a certain ananias, a man who was devout by the standard of the law and well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there came to me verse 13 and said to me, "Brother Saul, receive your sight." And at that very time I looked up at him and he said, "The God of our fathers has appointed you to know his will and to see the righteous one and to hear an utterance from his mouth.
[time=1633] Their ananias is basically saying back to Saul all that had just happened on that road to Damascus.
[time=1640] Verse 15, here you go, for you, Saul.
[time=1644] Persecuter, murderer of the early church, he says, "You will be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and heard." You know what he does here?
[time=1662] In verses 6 to 15, with this hostile, violent crowd in front of him having gone to great lengths to identify and connect with them through authenticity and realness.
[time=1676] Secondly, he shares with them his Christ encounter.
[time=1682] He shares with them the facts, the unalterable truth, the undeniable reality of how it is he came to encounter Jesus Christ.
[time=1696] He shares with them his Christ encounter.
[time=1700] You know what he does?
[time=1702] He tells his story.
[time=1706] He says, "This is what happened to me." My story, a story of a completely changed heart.
[time=1714] Question for you this morning.
[time=1716] How would it be for you?
[time=1719] I mean, how would it be for you if we just took five minutes here?
[time=1723] And we just turned on some music lightly in the background and just gave you a chance, no we just turned to the person next to you and just say, "Hey, let me share with you my Christ encounter." It started here.
[time=1736] What would that be like for you?
[time=1738] It would be probably pretty intimidating.
[time=1740] You may not know the person next to you.
[time=1742] I realize there would be some tensions.
[time=1744] We're not going to do it.
[time=1746] But I want you to think about it.
[time=1748] It's a critical part of the ministry that God's given you and me.
[time=1753] It's a critical component of verbal evangelism.
[time=1756] But it's a must that you would be willing and able and ready, ready today to share with anyone your Christ encounter.
[time=1770] And I've told some of you this before and I'll tell you all again this morning.
[time=1773] For me, it was 1980 to '83.
[time=1776] 1980 to '83.
[time=1778] Some really, really, really dark days in my life.
[time=1781] My family had just crumbled.
[time=1783] My world had completely caved in all I had ever known or understood about faith and God and my family just went completely out the window.
[time=1791] And for those three years, 1980 to '83, I went places, did things, said stuff, gave myself, my mind, my body.
[time=1799] I mean, just absolutely lived in darkness.
[time=1803] Angry, frustrated, and confused.
[time=1806] And in 1983, he began to do what God does.
[time=1809] And if you're here this morning and you know him, you know that he does it in different ways, through different circumstances and different people.
[time=1816] But nonetheless, he begins to tap you on your shoulder.
[time=1820] He begins to tap you.
[time=1821] And he begins to do this thing called efficacious grace.
[time=1824] It's a big term that means God drawing us to himself.
[time=1829] And in 1983, he began to do that with me.
[time=1832] I was one day away.
[time=1834] I had my ticket in my hand, literally.
[time=1837] They're in the fraternity house in my room and my phone rings and my bag's packed and my ticket's in my hand.
[time=1844] Ten guys for spring break going to Mazatlan, just to, like, lay by the pool and relax and have a good time and enjoy ourselves the way we enjoyed ourselves back in those days.
[time=1855] And my mom calls and she says, hey, I need you.
[time=1859] Do you think you could come home?
[time=1861] Well, home had changed for me.
[time=1862] It used to be the Bay Area.
[time=1863] And then it was now, all of a sudden it was Southern California and she was down there trying to get her marriage back together.
[time=1868] It wasn't going so well.
[time=1869] And she says to me, her only son, would you come home for the week?
[time=1873] I know you got spring break next week.
[time=1875] Do you have any plans?
[time=1876] I'm looking at my ticket and I'm looking at my bag.
[time=1880] I got nine guys going.
[time=1882] No.
[time=1885] And the only son said, what?
[time=1888] Sure.
[time=1889] So I lost the ticket.
[time=1892] Actually, I think I sold it for a profit or something, but let go of the ticket.
[time=1898] And I went home.
[time=1901] And I spent spring break with my mom.
[time=1904] But you know what?
[time=1905] It wasn't even about my mom.
[time=1907] And it helped her me be in there and we had some nice times, but God was doing this.
[time=1911] Because it was during that spring break where I was all of a sudden in a new place and a new town didn't know anybody, was there with my mom, and God brought Rod Shackleford and Matt McArthur and Greg Goens and Mike Romero and Paul Speer and Todd Brooks into my life.
[time=1931] Five, six, seven guys.
[time=1932] My age who liked what I liked and did what I did for the most part, they knew the Lord.
[time=1938] They knew the Lord personally.
[time=1940] They knew the Lord deeply.
[time=1941] They had young men who were walking with God and wanting nothing more than to be used of him in a powerful way.
[time=1946] And they befriended me.
[time=1947] And we went to baseball games at the end of spring training.
[time=1950] The Dodgers and Angels used to do this freeway series.
[time=1953] And we went to a couple of games that week.
[time=1956] Later to the night had a great time.
[time=1959] Went to the beach, hung out, went to Westwood where UCLA has walked the streets, had fun, laughed, went out and had meals, watched TV, went to some movies, and did all the things that they did the way they did them.
[time=1974] And didn't do much of what I was used to doing.
[time=1979] And it was an amazing thing.
[time=1981] God began to soften my heart and they began to help me realize through their lives and through their friendship who he was.
[time=1990] And they began to help me realize who I was and where I was headed and what a sad pathetic picture that was.
[time=2001] And so through those guys and went to church that week, got to hear the Bible taught for the first time in probably three or four years, through their friendship and through their efforts and through the Word of God.
[time=2012] As I went back to school that next week, I was different.
[time=2016] I was changed.
[time=2017] There was something going on that I couldn't deny.
[time=2019] I walked away from my scholarship, transferred schools, began to attend the Masters College, and on September of 1983, on a Sunday night in the back row on the left-hand side with my head just plastered to the front of the pew.
[time=2036] You know, if you're sitting there in your pew and if you would just kind of put your head down and rest your forehead on the wooden part there of the pew in front of you.
[time=2042] I think my head got there about two lines into the message.
[time=2046] He was preaching that night on Romans.
[time=2048] Romans at the end of chapter seven where it says, "Oh, wretched man, that I am, who will save me from this body of death?
[time=2056] Oh, thanks be to God for Jesus Christ." And it was that night in September of 1983, with tears just dripping off my cheek under the floor with my head just rested on that wooden part the entire night that I said the words from my heart, not because of who my dad was and not because of what I grew up in, because of what God had done in those recent months and weeks to my heart.
[time=2078] As he revealed himself to me through people and through his word, and I said, "That's it.
[time=2083] I'm drawing a line in the sand right here and right now, putting a stake in the ground.
[time=2087] I will give you my life.
[time=2091] I will never go into the ministry, but I will give you my life." That I got really clear with him from the get-go.
[time=2100] I will not go into the ministry, but I will give you my life.
[time=2105] And in the next few days, and in the next few weeks, through a series of different events and circumstances, you know, what I began to sense and feel in my heart, write this down.
[time=2115] Write this down.
[time=2116] I began to sense that I was forgiven.
[time=2119] I began to sense in those first few days and weeks that I was write this down graciously, forgiven.
[time=2129] Write it down, and as you write it down, look to Colossians chapter 1.
[time=2132] I wrote these down almost 20 years ago, 18 years ago.
[time=2140] I wrote them down in my Bible, Colossians 1.
[time=2146] I began to sense that I was graciously forgiven.
[time=2149] It says in Colossians 1, 13 and 14, 4.
[time=2153] He delivered us.
[time=2155] Has he you?
[time=2156] Have you gone through this?
[time=2157] Have you experienced this?
[time=2158] Do you know this to be true?
[time=2160] 4, he delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
[time=2171] And then just over a page.
[time=2173] I wrote this one down to Colossians 2, Colossians 2, 13.
[time=2177] And when you were dead in your transgressions and the uncircumcision of your flesh, and friends again, let me just tell you, at that point in my life, you did not have to convince me nor did he.
[time=2189] In all reality, how absolutely dead I was.
[time=2196] I was dead.
[time=2197] I was going absolutely nowhere.
[time=2199] I was fading fast.
[time=2200] And when I was dead in my transgressions, there you go back to verse 13.
[time=2204] He made you alive together with him having forgiven us all our transgressions.
[time=2212] I was graciously forgiven and I began to sense and know that in the days and weeks that followed.
[time=2218] You know what else?
[time=2219] Write this down.
[time=2220] I felt this undeniable thing inside.
[time=2223] It was amazing.
[time=2224] It was hard to describe and still even sometimes hard to articulate today.
[time=2228] But I was different.
[time=2230] Write this down.
[time=2231] I was absolutely new.
[time=2237] Still had a lot of things to deal with.
[time=2240] Still had a lot of circumstances that were confusing and painful.
[time=2243] Still had bad days that were ugly.
[time=2245] Still had days of falling and sin and regression back to an old life.
[time=2250] But you know what?
[time=2251] There was the sense inside me that I had the tools now and the people and the source to deal with this.
[time=2256] I was new.
[time=2257] 2 Corinthians 5.
[time=2259] Write it down.
[time=2260] 2 Corinthians 5.
[time=2263] Turn there if you would.
[time=2265] Look on with somebody next to you.
[time=2267] If you don't have your Bible.
[time=2268] 2 Corinthians 5.
[time=2269] Therefore verse 17.
[time=2270] Therefore if any man.
[time=2271] That go up to 14 for the love of
[time=2278] Christ controls us.
[time=2279] Having concluded this that one died for all, therefore all died.
[time=2284] And he died for all that they who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died and rose again on their behalf.
[time=2292] Therefore from now on we recognize no man according to the flesh even though we have known Christ according to the flesh yet we know him thus no longer.
[time=2300] Therefore verse 17.
[time=2301] If any man is in Christ he is a new creation, a new creature.
[time=2307] The old things passed away.
[time=2309] Be old.
[time=2310] New things.
[time=2311] New things have come.
[time=2312] I felt absolutely new.
[time=2317] Write this one down.
[time=2318] I felt in the days that followed and the weeks that came and in the months and years since that my relationship with him, that point where I gave him my life, that transaction that took place there, the regenerate heart was given new desires.
[time=2332] Write that down.
[time=2333] New desires and new appetites.
[time=2339] That's what happens when you encounter Christ.
[time=2344] You may be here this morning wondering if you have encountered Christ.
[time=2350] Do you know that you're forgiven graciously?
[time=2352] Do you feel absolutely new?
[time=2354] Still got some struggles?
[time=2355] Still got some issues but there's a newness that comes from the Spirit of God and the Word of God and the people of God.
[time=2360] And have you been given new desires?
[time=2362] New appetites.
[time=2365] Go to Ephesians real quick.
[time=2367] Ephesians 2.
[time=2369] Second chapter there in Paul's letter to those at Ephesus.
[time=2372] He describes this so well.
[time=2374] Ephesians 2 verses 1 to 5.
[time=2380] Make the connection here as we read to this idea of new appetites and new desires.
[time=2386] It says in chapter 2 verse 1, "And you were dead in your trespasses and sins in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air of the Spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience." That was me.
[time=2402] That was me pre-1983 to a T.
[time=2405] Among them we too all formally lived in the lusts of flesh indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature children of wrath even as the rest.
[time=2415] But God, verse 4, being rich in mercy because of his great love with which he loved us even when we were dead in our transgressions made us alive together with Christ.
[time=2430] By grace you have been saved.
[time=2435] It says back in Galatians just go back a couple, two, three pages.
[time=2439] Galatians chapter 2.
[time=2443] That's how you used to live.
[time=2444] Ephesians 2, 1 to 5, you used to be and I used to be.
[time=2447] And you know what it may have looked different.
[time=2449] You may not have had my fraternity lifestyle.
[time=2452] You may not have been into all the things that I always do, but you know what?
[time=2456] It doesn't matter.
[time=2457] It was all pre-Christ.
[time=2459] It's all one big deal where you and I in different ways and different shapes and sizes going after appetites and lusts that have absolutely nothing to do with him.
[time=2473] And now having encountered him, Galatians 2, 20, Paul said it so well.
[time=2478] I have been crucified with Christ and it is no longer I who live but Christ lives in me and the life which I now live in the flesh, the things that I'm hungry for, the directions I go, my appetites, my desires, the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by faith.
[time=2496] And the Son of God who loved me and delivered himself up for me.
[time=2501] I was graciously forgiven, made absolutely new, given new desires and new appetites when I encountered Christ and gave him my life.
[time=2515] Can you share your Christ encounter?
[time=2518] That was one page.
[time=2520] It was just a page.
[time=2522] It was just a few notes.
[time=2526] Can you share your Christ encounter?
[time=2529] Can you get it on a page?
[time=2533] Can you do it in kind of just a...
[time=2537] Can you share your encounter in just a kind of a one cup of coffee sit down over on the side in the booth?
[time=2544] I got a friend who says if you can't share your story over one cup, it's time to get out the pen, hone and refine.
[time=2552] It's really true.
[time=2553] It needs to be simple.
[time=2554] It needs to be straightforward.
[time=2556] It needs to be from the heart.
[time=2557] It needs to be real.
[time=2559] It needs to entail the truth.
[time=2561] Can you?
[time=2564] Can you in a short succinct fashion with real words from an honest heart describe and explain how you came to know Christ?
[time=2571] His story.
[time=2573] His story, what he did.
[time=2575] Your story, how you responded.
[time=2579] Are you ready today to share that?
[time=2582] Most of us here in this room.
[time=2586] Most of us here in this room probably need some help, probably need some encouragement, probably need some direction, probably need some accountability.
[time=2594] You may even need some training and that's fine.
[time=2597] We can give you that, but you've got to be ready to share the truth of who he is and what he's done and how you responded to that.
[time=2605] And while many in the room, myself included, need to be encouraged to continue to be ready to do that very thing, we also need to, as a church, my guess would be, do a much better job of what we see Paul do next.
[time=2619] This is where it gets fun.
[time=2621] Number three, he asks the question.
[time=2628] He asks the question.
[time=2630] He identifies with them.
[time=2631] He shares his Christ encounter.
[time=2633] And he asks the question.
[time=2636] Look at chapter 22, back to Acts.
[time=2639] This is something that so many times and so many different situations is so very challenging and hard and scary for, and some of you are thinking I'm going to say you, but no, I'm going to say me.
[time=2654] Very difficult for me to do at times.
[time=2659] What he does here in 22, 16, having shared his Christ encounter, he then turns and says to them, look at verse 16, and now, why do you delay?
[time=2671] He asks him, why do you delay, arise and be baptized and wash away your sins calling on his name?
[time=2681] He says in the vernacular of our day, what are you waiting for?
[time=2687] And he said it with passion.
[time=2689] He said it with love.
[time=2690] He said it with concern.
[time=2691] He said it having identified with them, having established that bridge of authenticity, but he asks the question.
[time=2701] What are you waiting for?
[time=2705] What's going on in your head these days?
[time=2708] Where's your heart in relationship to God and what he's done for you and what he's offering you?
[time=2715] Where are you at? What are you thinking? Talk to me.
[time=2719] I want to hear. I want to listen.
[time=2721] Paul asks the question.
[time=2723] What are you going to do with the Son of God? Jesus Christ and his substitutionary death on your behalf so that you might have forgiveness and peace today and eternal life with God tomorrow.
[time=2735] He just comes out and says it.
[time=2737] Now, I want you to see something in its grammatical structure.
[time=2741] We've talked about this before.
[time=2743] It was written in the Greek language and if you were to look at this verse in the original text, because some look at this verse and think, oh, wait a minute.
[time=2753] Rise and be baptized and wash away your sins calling on his name.
[time=2757] Wait a minute. Now, Kelly, you've been teaching us all along that baptism doesn't save.
[time=2763] And it would appear as if maybe in this verse baptism saves.
[time=2767] No, baptism doesn't save.
[time=2769] The whole context of God's Word calls that clearly. And when you look at this verse, just a little side note for you here, just put you at ease. When you look at this verse in the original language, you would find that this translation is a little bit unfortunate.
[time=2785] In the grammatical structure of the sentence, the verse would read call on his name, washing away your sins, then arise and be baptized.
[time=2795] Call on his name, washing away your sins, then arise and be baptized. It's almost as if the verse grammatically kind of just gets flip-flopped. And that's how that would read in the original, which is consistent with what it says in Romans 10, right?
[time=2811] Romans 10, 9 and 10. Some of you know that. Some of you kids have memorized that. Acts 22, 16 is even in its most purest grammatical sense consistent with what it says, that if you confess with your mouth, Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you shall be saved, for with the heart man believes, resulting in righteousness and with the mouth he confesses resulting in salvation than verse 13, for whoever will call upon the name of the Lord.
[time=2843] There's that same phrase found in 22, 16 will be saved.
[time=2851] So many times with people you and I love deeply.
[time=2859] And I'm talking to all of you, too many times, with people you know and love deeply, people I know and love deeply. What is going on?
[time=2873] We won't ask the question.
[time=2879] And I was thinking about it this week and I thought, you know what, I will just pick on me and I'll tell you why so many times with people I love deeply, I don't ask the question.
[time=2893] I don't personally, me Kelly, I don't ask the question sometimes because number one I'm insecure. That's right.
[time=2901] Sometimes I find myself thinking to myself, if I ask the question, I may get back, not an answer, but another question that I might not be able to answer. Yeah.
[time=2915] You ever feel that? Yeah.
[time=2917] Yeah, me, too.
[time=2919] And so sometimes in my insecurity and really it's my pride.
[time=2925] I let a situation go.
[time=2927] I let someone go.
[time=2929] I don't do what I feel prompted to do, led to do. I keep my mouth shut and I don't ask the question, what are you doing?
[time=2937] Where are you at these days?
[time=2939] I know you've heard the truth. Let's talk about it. No, insecure.
[time=2943] Afraid to ask because I might get a question back. The second thing I wrote down was sometimes I'm afraid to ask the question because I'm simply and completely and totally preoccupied.
[time=2955] Preoccupation, write that one down.
[time=2957] And maybe you can identify with this, maybe you can't. It's for you to figure out, but you know what folks? Just to cut to it and say it straight, sometimes I'm just busy. Sometimes I am just too engulfed in what's going on in my world.
[time=2971] Sometimes I'm too absolutely entrenched in what I'm doing in that moment.
[time=2975] And I am so given to this task or so committed to this endeavor.
[time=2979] I am so busy and I'm giving myself and my mind and my life to so much stuff that a person who's in need of life is flatlining right in front of me.
[time=2993] I've got the paddles and I don't say anything.
[time=2997] Because I'm too busy.
[time=3001] To stop, look, see that through spiritual eyes and open my mouth. Sometimes I'm insecure, sometimes I'm preoccupied and sometimes you know what?
[time=3013] And I just wrote this down and please, I say this to you in all humility and embarrassment and confession.
[time=3019] And I just have to say it to you sometimes and maybe you can identify sometimes in the midst of the insecurity and the preoccupation, my heart gets to a point where I just don't care.
[time=3031] I mean, let's just say it straight.
[time=3033] Sometimes I just don't care enough.
[time=3037] Maybe you can say that. Maybe you can say sometimes you just flat out don't care.
[time=3045] That they're lost without hope.
[time=3049] In need of help and life.
[time=3053] And all you may have to do is just open your mouth and ask a question.
[time=3057] Hopefully with a relationship that's been built to some degree and sometimes we just care more about other things.
[time=3065] And we shouldn't. You shouldn't. And I shouldn't.
[time=3069] And if no one is asking, if no one's opening their mouths, look what happens.
[time=3077] Maybe you're still in Romans 10.
[time=3079] Go back to Romans 10.
[time=3081] If no one's asking the question, if no one's opening their mouths, look what happens. Romans 10.
[time=3087] Look at verse 14.
[time=3089] Paul asks a great question.
[time=3093] A question I've got to wrestle with, and maybe you need to wrestle with as well this morning.
[time=3097] Verse 14, he says, "How then shall they call upon him in whom they have not believed?
[time=3103] And how shall they believe in him they have not heard?
[time=3107] And how shall they hear without a preacher?" Now before you look at me, I'll put the mirror up and it's going to come right back at you.
[time=3113] Because in the Greek, the word preacher means communicator.
[time=3117] One who shares a message.
[time=3119] All right?
[time=3121] So don't look at me like that.
[time=3125] No, because I'm looking at you.
[time=3127] And how are they going to hear unless you open your mouth?
[time=3131] And ask the question.
[time=3133] And ask the question out of a heart of love and devotion and concern.
[time=3139] Who do you need to lovingly,
[time=3145] prayerfully, thoughtfully this week?
[time=3147] I'm asking you, who do you need to lovingly and prayerfully and thoughtfully ask the question to?
[time=3155] Well, a great picture again. I'm going to ask the folks to come back up and we're going to end this morning with a song.
[time=3163] And I'm going to invite you to just worship with all your heart.
[time=3167] Paul, as he often does, and has done all throughout this great book that we've been studying.
[time=3175] He gives us a great picture of what it's like to stand for the truth and not just stand for the truth but what we saw there was a way of even articulating the truth.
[time=3185] And I hope as you leave today, there may be some here today who need to respond to the truth.
[time=3191] You may need to come this morning and just give us a chance to talk.
[time=3195] We'll ask the question.
[time=3197] We'll talk you through whatever needs to be talked through.
[time=3201] And we want to give you that opportunity to come down afterwards and just talk with me and some others.
[time=3207] We'd love to meet you and hear what's going on.
[time=3209] Love to hear your story.
[time=3211] So we can share with you more effectively his.
[time=3213] Others of you here know him.
[time=3215] You're decided. The stakes in the ground, you know, sometimes.
[time=3219] You may be a little bit more willing to identify, to allow people in your world to see you as you are and share with them your encounter and do it in a way whereby you get the privilege of asking the question.
[time=3233] Give it some thought, please.
[time=3235] Let me ask you to stand if you would.
[time=3237] And I hope, and we hope this morning, this song that we're about to sing would just be your prayer as we go.
[time=3243] Sing it from your heart. I'll come back up and close us.

[time=3391] He is the man.
[time=3397] Let's pray. Father, we leave this place today so very thankful for the strength and the courage and the hope that we have in you.
[time=3411] Whether it be on a national scale or just God personally, we need it. We need that sense of your touch in your hand.
[time=3420] And so as we've met with you today and as we've come into your house, and as we've been with your people and most importantly, heard your word.
[time=3427] God, we pray that it would prepare us for that which you have for us.
[time=3432] And we pray that whether it be with family or friends at work or with those that we would meet, God give us strength to be the people you've called us to be.
[time=3441] And for God, for those who are here this morning who again sit here and they hear the truth and they see the truth as it's lived out here in your house and as they see the people of God and the Word of God and the Spirit of God at work, they sit here and maybe they've set here for weeks and in their hearts they sense still the emptiness and the ache of not knowing you.
[time=3463] There's been no line drawn, there's been no stake driven in. There hasn't been yet a commitment to thoroughly and completely give their lives to you and God we pray that they would do that today.
[time=3477] Just one, just one here today who needs that sense of your touch, that forgiveness and the ability then to face life with purpose and meaning.
[time=3487] We pray that for them, we pray they would come and that we could talk. God, thank you so very much for the chance to be together.
[time=3494] We look forward to being together again soon. In your son's name we pray. Amen.
