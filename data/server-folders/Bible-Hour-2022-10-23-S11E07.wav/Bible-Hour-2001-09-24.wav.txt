[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=30] - You know, here at Blackhawk, we have been blessed in so many ways over the years.
[time=39] And recently, one of those blessings that just has continued to grow and meet some very special needs is a class that we call our friendship class.
[time=51] Many of you are aware of this, some of you may not be.
[time=53] We've got a special group of people here in this church and they represent some who are physically and mentally challenged.
[time=62] And we've got another special group of people.
[time=65] And those are some who have come alongside to help minister to and care for and encourage those individuals.
[time=71] And it is called our friendship class.
[time=74] It meets on Sunday mornings during our first hour at nine.
[time=77] And we wanna make that known to as many of you as possible.
[time=81] You may have friends, you may watch the broadcast and have some of those needs in your own home.
[time=87] We want you to know that there are people trained and equipped to meet the needs of those who exist in that arena.
[time=93] And this is a ministry that God has continued to bless.
[time=97] And I want you this morning to be encouraged as you watch this video.
[time=102] See the hearts, see the spirit of those who are giving themselves to these that are challenged.
[time=108] And be encouraged as you see right here on your screen, the ministry that God is furthering as it relates to those with special needs.
[time=116] Pastors often give me the question,
[time=135] why should our church have a disability ministry?
[time=139] Why do we need to minister to such a small group?
[time=141] In my congregation, I have one person who is in a wheelchair and I have one family that has a child with a developmental disability.
[time=150] But I also have 50 families that are right on the verge of divorce and desperately need counseling.
[time=156] And I have people who are suffering with drug abuse and alcohol abuse.
[time=160] We have people who are suffering from debilitating illnesses which are going to result in death.
[time=166] And all of these problems all need my attention.
[time=170] Why should I just focus on these two people in my congregation?
[time=175] Now my answer to the question is, you've answered your own question.
[time=179] You only have two people in your congregation who have noticeable severe disabilities.
[time=186] If I look at what God says about disabilities, I see that in 1 Corinthians Paul tells us that the church is a body and that every part of the body is vital.
[time=196] Every part is important.
[time=198] And for us to say, we are going to only minister to those who are the greatest in number.
[time=203] Or we're only going to minister to those who are the most visible.
[time=206] Really is going against God's word.
[time=210] - I see this as being important because of who Christ is.
[time=216] If Jesus were here, how would he treat people with special needs?
[time=220] How would he relate to them?
[time=222] He would include them, open armed.
[time=225] He would not exclude them in any way.
[time=228] His heart is full of love for everybody, including people with special needs.
[time=233] We need to be like that.
[time=234] We need to show his love toward them.
[time=238] That also is reflected to families, caregivers in a powerful way.
[time=246] They ask, why are you doing this?
[time=248] And we can give an answer because God loves this.
[time=251] He told us to do this.
[time=253] We can show his love and we can help lead others to Christ through this.
[time=258] - It's like you look into God's eyes when you talk to these people.
[time=262] It's absolutely something that I can't explain.
[time=265] And I just feel so thankful.
[time=267] And I just challenge anyone out there to go to the class, just visit because it is the most uplifting experience I've ever had in my life.
[time=283] - You know, I was thinking of this next song.
[time=285] Can we put the words for the next song up there real quick?
[time=289] Oh, lead me to the place where I can find you.
[time=292] Oh, lead me to the place where you'll be.
[time=295] And then the chorus goes, lead me to the cross where we first met.
[time=299] Draw me to my knees so we can talk.
[time=302] And for me, I think about God being a God of second chances.
[time=307] And I go to the story of the woman at the well, the Samaritan woman when Jesus just reached out to her and changed her life.
[time=317] And then she forgot about her jar of water and ran to the town to tell everyone.
[time=325] I mean, she was so excited.
[time=327] And the Bible says that many people came to a saving faith in Christ because of her testimony.
[time=334] And then I remember back to the day that I first met Jesus.
[time=341] And I remember that feeling and how excited I was and how eager I was to tell everybody.
[time=347] And you know what, I didn't tell everybody in a necessarily a very nice way.
[time=351] But I know it was excitement.
[time=353] And as we sing this song today and we look at the cross over here as just a symbol, a reminder that God is a God of second chances and he loves us.
[time=366] And if you're here today and you know him as your Lord and savior, then this song would be for us to remember that and maybe pray that he would lead us to a place where we can get that feeling and excitement about him back.
[time=381] And maybe you have that.
[time=383] And so as we sing this, you can just think, "Man, praise God.
[time=386] "Thank you, God.
[time=387] "Keep it going in my life." And if you're here today and you don't know Jesus as your savior, maybe if you just listen, maybe the Spirit of God is talking to you.
[time=399] And maybe he wants to lead you to a cross.
[time=401] [MUSIC - 102 seconds]
[time=511] (gentle music) - This morning, we wanna use these three songs
[time=521] as we sing them for you to have a time of just worship where you're at, maybe bowing in prayer, kneeling if you need to do that, standing if you need to do that, and just reflecting on the fact that God is a God of second chances.
[time=538] And we're praying that he would lead us to the cross to remember that today.
[time=542] And so as we sing the next couple songs in this one, just take that time, however you need to do it, wherever you're at, and just talk to him.
[time=551] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 20 seconds]
[time=578] (gentle music) (gentle music)
[time=586] Sing that one more time to the cross.
[time=595] [MUSIC - 15 seconds]
[time=614] (gentle music)
[time=628] [MUSIC - 190 seconds]
[time=822] - Do you sing, "You Are My King?" Let's just be able to right now hold nothing back and just keep in mind, God is the God of second chances.
[time=832] And if He is your King, then sing it to Him.
[time=834] Like we've never seen it before.
[time=836] [MUSIC - 14 seconds]
[time=856] - Pour out your heart to Him.
[time=858] [MUSIC]
[time=863] - He is a God of second chances.
[time=865] [MUSIC]
[time=870] He gave everything that He might live with now.
[time=873] [MUSIC - 14 seconds]
[time=889] - That's love is amazing.
[time=891] [MUSIC - 66 seconds]
[time=962] - This morning, if you know the Lord, if you've got a relationship with the Lord, and as you walk through your life with Him, and you know, as I walk through mine with Him, there are times I will admit to you, and I have before, and you've admitted it back to me.
[time=978] So I know we're on the same page.
[time=980] You know, there are times when you just, you'll wonder if we got it right.
[time=986] There's times where you sometimes just wonder, you know, if this thing called truth and this faith that we've given ourselves to is really, really what we believe in our hearts it is.
[time=997] And you know, it struck me, and I has had a great conversation with one of our elders this past week, and Jack and I were talking, and it was just, you know, it was a real brief conversation, but I wanted to just kind of communicate its essence to you because I think it's very, very encouraging.
[time=1014] You know, for the last two weeks without embarrassment, without hesitation, without even flinching, this society of ours, this world of ours, has been calling itself to do one thing.
[time=1031] You see it on signs, and you hear it on the radio, and you see it on TV, and people are meeting everywhere to do it, and in one loud voice, this society is calling itself to what?
[time=1043] Pray.
[time=1044] Now, if you just kind of rewind about six months or six weeks,
[time=1050] this society of ours had a much different message to you and to me.
[time=1057] You see, from, you know, years gone by, this society has said to you, and it has said to me, it has said to itself, when times get tough, when things get a little bit on the edge, when you're in need of some level of comfort or reminding, go have a drink.
[time=1073] Get some pornography.
[time=1075] Go have an affair.
[time=1078] Overspend, overeat, I mean, go do something.
[time=1082] Whatever you want to do is fine.
[time=1083] Whatever will meet the need to bring comfort and peace and security, go do it.
[time=1087] That's been society's message.
[time=1090] Now conflict hits.
[time=1092] Now it gets real close.
[time=1094] Now all of a sudden, we begin to get our worlds rocked a bit.
[time=1097] And society, with one loud voice, says go pray.
[time=1103] Nobody's saying, hey, time out.
[time=1105] At least I didn't see it, did you?
[time=1106] I didn't see anybody saying, wait a minute, time out.
[time=1108] Separation, church, and state, don't have those kids praying.
[time=1112] I didn't see anybody throwing a fit about the national day of prayer.
[time=1114] I didn't see anybody writing letters about the prayer, service, and what, nothing.
[time=1118] And you need to be reminded today why.
[time=1122] You need to be reminded today why you have heard no other options or alternatives altered.
[time=1129] Because they know, in their hearts, Romans 1 says so.
[time=1134] They know there are none.
[time=1138] They know.
[time=1140] A godless world who has chosen to this point to reject him knows down deep in their soul, the core of who they are, that when it gets right down to it,
[time=1153] it's time to pray.
[time=1156] And so be encouraged and continue to pray, not only for our country, but for those who are again in times of crisis praying again, seeking God again, looking for something that brings that sense of security and peace.
[time=1170] Pray for them.
[time=1171] Ask them the question.
[time=1173] Build relationship with them.
[time=1175] Love them.
[time=1176] Be sensitive to them.
[time=1178] And do all that you can to in a time like this.
[time=1180] A, be encouraged because our faith is real.
[time=1185] And secondly, have hearts and eyes that are open to the needs that God places around you.
[time=1190] As Rick mentioned earlier this morning, we gather together to celebrate the fact that our God is a God of the second chance.
[time=1201] Many of you know that.
[time=1203] Many of you are very aware of that.
[time=1205] And so am I.
[time=1207] So am I.
[time=1208] It had been a long week for me.
[time=1211] I had received several critical emails and had heard some comments that really cut pretty deep.
[time=1217] Discouraged my spirit, hurt my feelings.
[time=1220] There had been some relational disappointment and pain.
[time=1223] A real struggle with two different friends over misunderstandings and a differing of opinions.
[time=1227] An out of town friend of mine in ministry was hurting, failing, and on the brink of walking away from all that he knew and loved.
[time=1235] It was a hard week.
[time=1237] Ministry needs and opportunities here were skyrocketing while ministry resources continued to plummet.
[time=1244] And on this specific day, I think in the driving around of that day, I had gotten cut off twice.
[time=1250] I had missed a meeting.
[time=1251] I was supposed to be at my lawnmower broke, which if you know me in fixing things is a real tragedy.
[time=1258] My own mother had gotten on me for a couple of things.
[time=1261] A meeting I had made had not gone well at all.
[time=1264] Our medical insurance, Kevin and I realized, had radically overcharged us.
[time=1269] My head hurt.
[time=1270] Did I mention we were going to have a fifth kid in December?
[time=1275] And when I got home, my two oldest were fighting.
[time=1277] And then I came home for dinner.
[time=1284] And we sat down in Maddie's filter of water everywhere.
[time=1294] It's just a big glass of water everywhere.
[time=1300] And it had been a long week.
[time=1301] And I absolutely popped a gasket.
[time=1307] I mean, I pushed my chair back so fast.
[time=1314] And I stood up, all six, seven of me, towering over a four-year-old, and absolutely popped a gasket.
[time=1322] I yelled at her.
[time=1331] Difficult circumstances, and difficult people in a heart.
[time=1339] Maybe you'll understand this, a heart that had grown distant and discouraged through the course of the difficult circumstances and the difficult people had left me on the verge of and primed for disobedience.
[time=1353] And the moment I chose it, the moment the chair got kicked back and I stood up and chose disobedience, the moment I let it fly at a four-year-old girl, whatever was left of my heart at that time broke into a thousand pieces, completely and thoroughly embarrassed and ashamed in front of my wife and family who I was and what I had done.
[time=1379] You ever been there?
[time=1379] We all have, haven't we?
[time=1385] We've all been there.
[time=1387] We're not alone.
[time=1389] Not alone at all in our failure, I know that.
[time=1392] And you know what so was the apostle Paul.
[time=1395] So was the apostle Paul in the passage that we'll look at today.
[time=1399] He too, as you'll see in Acts 23, knew what it meant to fail and to fail miserably.
[time=1406] Now, the great news is that the story didn't end with me wallowing stuck in my embarrassment and shame, because as is always the case, it seems with the Lord and in my own life and as is often the case with you, as you walk through your days with Him, there is the next morning.
[time=1426] And almost each and every morning and this next morning again as well, about 6'10".
[time=1432] Usually it doesn't go past 6'15", but somewhere around the 6'10", 6'15 mark, the door creaks open.
[time=1438] First you see the blanket, then the fluffy wave of red hair.
[time=1444] And in she comes, and she came in that next morning less than 10 hours after my utter failure and sin against her.
[time=1453] She jumps up in bed and nuzzles her nose up against my neck.
[time=1458] And it was as if God was reminding me yet again that His mercies are new every what, every morning.
[time=1464] And it was as if He was prodding me in my heart that morning to do what He has prodded me in my heart to do so many times and that is to look her in her eyes and to say to her how very, very sorry I was for doing what I did when daddy got loud and raised his voice.
[time=1483] And to say to her, I'm sorry, and to ask her a four-year-old for her forgiveness and then to kind of make my way throughout the rest of that day to my other family members and ask them for their forgiveness as well.
[time=1497] And I sense that prodding and I sense Him at work in my heart to love her better today than I had last night.
[time=1503] And He is a God that works and moves and prods again and again and again and again with me as I know He does with many of you.
[time=1513] And so let's take a look, what are you saying?
[time=1517] Let's take a look this morning at Acts 23 and see how it is that God gave Paul as He gives us so many times a second chance.
[time=1526] And it begins with as it did with me in this specific situation and as it often does with you and the things you face, it begins with what was for Paul, number one, a bad week, a bad week.
[time=1538] To understand Paul's state of mind, let's recall his recent trouble.
[time=1542] So far in this week that we've been studying and really these 21, 22, 23, this all kind of recounts for us a very short period of time.
[time=1552] And so far in this week, Paul has been beaten by a mob, beaten by a mob, go back to Acts 21, go back to Acts 21, we'll pick it up in Acts 21, 27, is where we'll start.
[time=1567] So far in this week, he had been beaten by a mob, it says in 27 and when the seven days were almost over, the Jews from Asia upon seeing him, Paul and the temple, began to stir up all the multitude and laid hands on him crying out, "Men of Israel, come to our aid." This is the man who preaches to all men everywhere against our people, against the law and this place.
[time=1589] And besides, he has even brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place for they had previously seen Trophamis, the Ephesian, in the city with him and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple.
[time=1603] And all the city was aroused and the people rushed together and taking hold of Paul, they dragged him out of the temple and immediately the doors were shut.
[time=1612] And while they were seeking to kill him, a report came up to the commander of the Roman cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion.
[time=1620] And at once he took along some soldiers and centurions and ran down to them and when they saw the commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.
[time=1629] So far in this week, he had been beaten by a mob, bound in chains, just go to the next verse, then the commander came up and took hold of him and ordered him to be bound with two chains and he began asking who he was and what he had done.
[time=1644] He had been beaten by a mob, bound in chains, had his death demanded by a group of zealous Jews, that's basically all of chapter 22 and had come within a hair's breath of being killed later in that same chapter, chapter 22.
[time=1659] And now he was on his way to yet another trial.
[time=1664] This guy's making a living being on trial, defending himself, facing accusations and now he is on his way to yet another trial, what a week.
[time=1674] What a week, huh?
[time=1675] Having had little sleep food or physical care, he stands weary and bruised before the highest Jewish court in the land.
[time=1683] They were known as the Sanhedrin.
[time=1688] A tough week led to a tough crowd, actually a very bad crowd, number two.
[time=1693] And you see this beginning to develop back in 2230, back in 22 verse 30.
[time=1701] We skip ahead a little bit on the next day, wishing to know for certain why he had been accused by the Jews, he released him and ordered the chief priests and all the counsel to assemble and brought Paul down and set him before them.
[time=1720] The counsel officially known as the Sanhedrin, an entrenched group of religious leaders whose love for tradition was thick and whose patience with Paul was wearing thin.
[time=1733] And you see this is an interesting mix, Paul and the Sanhedrin, because you see there would have been some history.
[time=1738] There would have been some major history here.
[time=1741] Paul, you see, had been a member of this austere judicial body in his early years and knew all the details about them.
[time=1748] It was made up of about 70 men, including the high priest.
[time=1752] The high priest was the religious king in a sense.
[time=1755] The high priest was, he was on top of the stack.
[time=1758] This guy was who was in charge of.
[time=1761] He was revered, he was looked to.
[time=1763] He was seen as the one who deserved the most respect, the one who deserved all of their attention.
[time=1770] The high priest was the guy he was in charge.
[time=1773] And there was 70 men, including the high priest, who wrote the laws and made judgments based on their interpretation of the mosaic law.
[time=1782] And since these men held their positions for life, Paul more than likely recognized many of them from his own days on the council.
[time=1790] He also knew that two main factions had divided the Sanhedrin.
[time=1795] And maybe you're aware of this or maybe you're not, but you learn something new here.
[time=1798] Two main factions had over the years divided the Sanhedrin.
[time=1802] The Pharisees were on one side.
[time=1805] The Pharisees, to whom he had belonged, and the Sadducees on the other.
[time=1809] Now the Pharisees were legalistic.
[time=1813] Extremely legalistic, rule-oriented, and viewed the oral traditions as highly as the written law and believed in angels, spirits, and the bodily resurrection of the dead.
[time=1824] The Sadducees, on the other hand, had no room for oral traditions and were rationalists, rejecting the supernatural altogether, including the hope of a resurrection.
[time=1835] And this body was giving spiritual oversight to the people of that time.
[time=1840] Both factions clung tightly to their traditions, and together, they clung tightly to their power.
[time=1846] And as the dialogue begins, as Paul comes before them, and as the dialogue initiates you see from the outset, what we mean by a bad, tough crowd.
[time=1858] Chapter 23, and Paul, verse one.
[time=1860] And Paul, looking intently, that word in the Greek there, would give evidence to the fact that he looked at them with an attitude.
[time=1869] Paul, looking intently at the council, said, brethren, I have lived my life with a perfectly good conscience before God, up to this day.
[time=1881] And the high priest, Ananias, commanded those standing beside him to strike him on the mouth.
[time=1887] Boom, take that.
[time=1891] You see, with a hint of impatience, or maybe even some sarcasm in his voice, he had said to them, I am not guilty of anything.
[time=1899] And you know what?
[time=1900] You know what, dude?
[time=1902] You know what guy up there with the big hat, whoever you, you know what?
[time=1905] I'm not guilty, and I'm not guilty before God, and I don't have to answer to you.
[time=1909] Who are you to judge me?
[time=1911] Was kind of the feel of that interchange.
[time=1915] So he gets popped in the face.
[time=1916] He gets slapped across the mouth, and after all that he has endured, after all that he has survived over the past few days, that's it.
[time=1925] He pops a gasket.
[time=1929] With self-control and wisdom out the window, he pours out a scalding stream of contempt from point-blank range.
[time=1936] There is zero love, none.
[time=1938] Hate takes over, frustration wins out.
[time=1942] And a bad week and a bad crowd lead to a bad choice.
[time=1950] Pick it up there in verse three.
[time=1952] Then Paul, having been hit on the mouth, then Paul said to him, God is going to strike you.
[time=1958] Dead is the implication.
[time=1960] God, he looks now at the high priest.
[time=1962] God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall.
[time=1967] He looks at this guy and calls him the ultimate of hypocrites.
[time=1972] You whitewashed wall.
[time=1973] You look good on the outside inside.
[time=1976] You are absolutely nothing but rotten.
[time=1979] You whitewashed wall, God is going to strike you dead.
[time=1983] And do you sit to try me according to the law and in violation of the law order me to be struck?
[time=1991] Now he's going after him.
[time=1993] He's had enough.
[time=1994] Then it gets interesting.
[time=1998] But the bystander said, do you revile God's high priest?
[time=2002] And again, you don't get the full sense of this in the English, but that's OK.
[time=2008] I'm here to tell you, in the original language, if you were to read verse five, you would almost read it like this.
[time=2013] And Paul said, oh, I wasn't aware.
[time=2023] I didn't know he was the high priest.
[time=2026] Oh boy, look what I did.
[time=2030] And Paul said, I was not aware, brethren, that he was high priest.
[time=2034] For it is written, and Paul knew.
[time=2036] It was written, because he quotes it.
[time=2038] For it is written, you shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.
[time=2042] Now many have debated, and we won't get into it here
[time=2048] this morning, but many have debated how it is that this could have happened.
[time=2051] That Paul, himself, having been a part of this group, Paul himself, have they been so very familiar with these individuals, would not have in that moment recognized who he was blistering with his speech.
[time=2064] Some would say, and I would tend to agree, that we're told, as you read through them, the epistles, and even in this book of Acts, what we're told about a thorn in the flesh that Paul had suffered with over the years.
[time=2077] And many would seem to indicate that that struggle of Paul's was that he had bad eyesight, and that very possibly, by this stage of the game, the eyesight was really struggling, and that in his anger and in his sarcasm, he wasn't seeing clearly.
[time=2095] Sound familiar?
[time=2098] Now whatever the reason the damage had been done, and this is where we gotta kinda hone in.
[time=2105] Whatever the reason the damage had been done, in a heated moment, he had said the wrong thing to the wrong person, lost his chance to receive a fair trial, and most importantly, and this is where you gotta try and connect with Paul, okay, most importantly, in the heated moment, as he said, the wrong thing to the wrong person, not only had he violated the law, not only had he lost his chance for a fair trial, but he put in jeopardy and compromised the one thing that meant most to Paul.
[time=2137] The one thing, as you've gotten to know him over these months of studying him, you gotta realize the thing that meant most to Paul, was that in any and every situation, he was a guy who wanted to proclaim the what?
[time=2150] The truth, the gospel, and in every situation like this, in all the pages we've already seen, whenever he got before people, whenever the accusations came, whenever he was put on trial, he used it as an opportunity to articulate what was right and true about God.
[time=2167] And now he had blown that.
[time=2170] Now he was shut down.
[time=2175] Cast aside, spoke too soon, spoke too fast, spoke too harshly.
[time=2180] You've got the things in your life that mean the most to you, I hope.
[time=2190] Things like me, things that get you up each day, things that keep you up late each night, opportunities that you're passionate about.
[time=2199] I think about my family and I think about you, this family.
[time=2204] I think about the two families in my life.
[time=2206] And if ever I had done something, or if ever I said something, and I don't know about you and the things that you so enjoy, but if ever I did something that jeopardized my ability to be with my family and/or this family, I don't know what I do, it kill me.
[time=2225] And now the one thing that means most to him, he's altered, he's compromised.
[time=2234] He's failed.
[time=2235] And you know what it feels like, I know you do.
[time=2239] I know what it feels like, you promised.
[time=2241] You promised, you said to God, you said to him, you said to her, you wouldn't go there anymore.
[time=2249] You said no more, no more yelling, no more outburst of anger, no more spending, no more overeating, no more lying, no more booze, no more drugs, no more websites.
[time=2259] You said it, you promised and you meant it.
[time=2264] (audience murmurs) In the spiritual arena, I mean it's all spiritual, but in the evangelism arena, as we talked about it last week, you even said no more being quiet.
[time=2277] When you should speak up for what's right, or speak truth into the life of a struggling friend, you said you'd do it, no more being quiet.
[time=2287] Last week you sat right here in these pews, many of you and said that you should ask him, you should ask her the question.
[time=2294] And the time came and maybe you didn't open your mouth again.
[time=2297] You've made promises, you've said you wouldn't go here, you said you wouldn't do this.
[time=2303] You said this would come to an end, you said we get a whole lot more consistent on this, and you know what it's like, as I know what it's like to have failed.
[time=2313] Oftentimes we're like Peter, who said, Lord, I will never deny you, and proceeded to fail him not once, not twice, but three times in less than a day.
[time=2327] We say we won't, and we don't want to, but Paul, Paul's own words.
[time=2333] Paul's own words from Romans seven come back to remind us of our plight and our struggle.
[time=2338] It says in Romans 715, for that which I am doing, does this sound familiar to anybody in this room?
[time=2344] For that which I am doing, I do not understand for I am not practicing what I would like to do, but I'm doing the very thing I hate.
[time=2354] Says that in verse 19, "For the good that I wish I do not do, "but I practice the very evil that I do not wish, "but if I am doing the very thing I do not wish, "I am no longer the one doing it, but sin which dwells in me.
[time=2368] "I find then the principle that evil is present in me, "the one who wishes to do good.
[time=2374] "For I joyfully concur with the law of God "and the inner man, the true me, the real me, "the believer, me, the redeemed me, "I believe in my heart, and I joyfully concur "with the law of God, but I see a different law "in the members of my body, waging war against the law "of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin "which is in my members, wretched man that I am, "struggling, fighting, failing man that I am,
[time=2405] "who will set me free from this body of death?" Verse 25, thanks be to God.
[time=2412] Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[time=2417] So then on the one hand, I myself with my mind, I'm serving the law of God, but on the other with my flesh, the law of sin.
[time=2425] And so you ask yourself, like I ask myself again this morning, who will set you free?
[time=2431] Who will set you free?
[time=2439] From this body of death, who will set us free from the guilt of failure, from the embarrassment and the shame that accompanies our choices?
[time=2448] And this morning, I hope that you sense maybe for the first time, and you know what?
[time=2456] Maybe for the 9,000th time.
[time=2459] That the answer is the same, and it has been
[time=2466] and is and always will be the same.
[time=2468] Who will set you free?
[time=2469] Jesus, thanks be to God, through Jesus,
[time=2475] and what he did, and where he went, and what he accomplished for you.
[time=2479] Thanks be to God through Jesus.
[time=2483] What sets you free?
[time=2486] What moves us away from the embarrassment and shame is the love and mercy and forgiveness of Jesus.
[time=2495] And what we experience and what we get with a life lived for him, a life lived with him.
[time=2502] And you know what many of you, well, I bet a lot of you in the room this morning, room this size with this many people, I bet a lot of us.
[time=2513] To some degree, or another this morning, need a taste of that again.
[time=2520] His forgiveness and his mercy.
[time=2525] His life giving love, and the fresh perspective that comes with yet another chance.
[time=2530] And again, some of you need that chance, some of you need that forgiveness for the very first time as it relates to him, 'cause you've been struggling, you've been fighting, you've been searching, you've been seeking, you've been asking questions, trying to figure out this thing called faith.
[time=2546] And this morning, maybe you need, and maybe the opportunity is here for you to finally cross over a line, to walk across that bridge that we've defined and described so many times, and begin to live life in relationship with Jesus Christ, forgiven.
[time=2562] Forgiven completely, embarrassment, shame, forgotten.
[time=2566] And then to be in a relationship with him, whereby as you then go on to live, talk to a guy last week who said, "Yeah, I get that, but then next week "I'm gonna do the same thing." I said, "I know, I do too," and that's the beauty of being in relationship with one who has the power and the will, the desire to forgive.
[time=2586] If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness, many of you.
[time=2597] Some in the room that I need that sense of his grace and his love and his forgiveness for all the embarrassment and shame of your failures, and you need that desperately today for the first time.
[time=2606] Others, if you like me, have known him.
[time=2611] There was a time back here where you drew that line in the sand, you put that stake in the ground and you've now been doing your best with his help to live life in a way that honors him.
[time=2619] And in the last few days, in the last few weeks, maybe the last few months, choices have been made.
[time=2625] Patterns have started to be developed.
[time=2628] And you've sensed your heart growing distant and discouraged, difficult situations and maybe difficult people.
[time=2635] Circumstances have been such.
[time=2638] And you find yourself this morning in all honesty before him.
[time=2641] Realizing how desperately you need his touch yet again.
[time=2646] In fact, you know what I'm gonna give you a chance right now.
[time=2650] We're not quite done yet, but maybe now would just be a good time.
[time=2654] Why don't you just write where you're at, everybody here in the room, why don't you just bow your heads?
[time=2659] Why don't you just bow your heads and why don't you just close your eyes and why don't you just in your own words, in your own way, maybe you need to just have some people's faces in mind.
[time=2672] As you close your eyes and as you bow your heads and as you kind of open up your heart to the spirit of God here in this moment, you may need to just have some faces, some people in mind.
[time=2683] Because there may need to be some things said.
[time=2686] You may need to not only ask for his forgiveness, you may need to ask for theirs.
[time=2691] And it may be anyone from a three-year-old to a 80-year-old, I don't know.
[time=2697] But maybe this morning, yet again, just like me, who looks forward to the new mercies every morning.
[time=2705] Maybe there's something you need to do, a letter you need to write, an email you need to send, a hand that you need to hold and just look in their eyes and say, "I'm sorry," again.
[time=2722] Others of you may need to just purpose in your heart right now that you're not gonna let the day go by without coming up here afterwards and getting with me or some of the folks that are up here and getting this faith thing, this relationship with Jesus, this hope for all eternity, this direction, this guide in the midst of a troubled world
[time=2746] and a troubled heart, yours.
[time=2748] You're not gonna let today go by without doing that.
[time=2751] Talk to him, just take a minute and talk to him about them.
[time=2756] Make those commitments, ask him for help, ask him for strength to do what needs to be done, to say what needs to be said, to write what needs to be written.
[time=2778] Father, one of the joys of knowing you is that we can come into your presence and we come into your presence here
[time=2798] in this room today at this time, many of us needing your help, needing your strength, needing your courage to humble ourselves and be the people that you've called us to be.
[time=2809] And God, we need to day in and day out experience, your forgiveness, your grace, your mercy and your touch.
[time=2818] And so God, if it's in relationship to really knowing you and committing ourselves to you for the very first time, give those who need to take those steps, the strength and the courage to do so.
[time=2830] And Father, if it's others of us who know you, would need to, again, make things right with you and with others so that we can again experience what it's like to be given a second chance, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, tenth, hundredth, whatever.
[time=2847] We know the mercies, we know the pool of grace doesn't run out as we approach it genuinely and honestly, and so God, I pray that we would do that in your son's name.
[time=2857] We pray, amen.
[time=2858] Paul needed it.
[time=2860] Paul needed what we just talked about.
[time=2863] And if you look back to Acts 23 and the timely grace of God, which brings hope and promise again to a discouraged soul, you will see a second chance.
[time=2873] Back to Acts 23, we'll pick it up in verse 11.
[time=2877] But on the night immediately following, but on the night immediately following, the Lord stood at his side and said, take courage.
[time=2889] You need to hear that sometimes, don't you?
[time=2891] You need to know God is standing by your side, whispering in your ear, take courage.
[time=2896] Take courage, he says, for as you have solemnly witnessed to my cause at Jerusalem, so you must witness at Rome also.
[time=2905] Now see many of you in the room this morning know the significance of those words.
[time=2910] Some of you may have missed it and that's okay because as you study the book of Acts and as you get to know this guy named Paul, you realize again that not only was his passion, not only the thing that got him up early and kept him up late, not only was it the gospel and the chance to plant new churches and preach and proclaim truth, not only was it that, but he wanted so and he has for a long time now, wanted so desperately to do that in a place called what?
[time=2935] Rome, I mean that was kind of what had this guy going and to know just in that one little moment there that he felt like in his heart maybe he had jeopardized the one thing he wanted most to do, must have just killed him.
[time=2949] God comes to him in a vision and says no, no, you've answered the call and you've been faithful.
[time=2954] And you realize what you've done and you've witnessed my cause at Jerusalem and so you must witness at Rome also.
[time=2961] Chuck Swindall says it this way in a commentary on the book of Acts specifically related to that verse.
[time=2968] Swindall says with a cool breeze of grace.
[time=2971] Did you ever experience that?
[time=2972] That cool breeze of grace.
[time=2976] With a cool breeze of grace, Jesus blew away the painful memory of Paul's failure.
[time=2982] He had in a moment been forgiven and restored and it must have been the same feeling I had that next morning when a sleepy four-year-old climbed in bed and looked me in the eye and said good morning, Dad, how'd you sleep?
[time=2997] Not good morning, Dad, are you still ticked?
[time=3002] Not good morning, Dad.
[time=3005] And I promise I won't spill my milk at breakfast.
[time=3008] You know, they're amazing.
[time=3010] It was as if it was all gone.
[time=3011] She climbed in bed and said good morning, Dad, how'd you sleep?
[time=3016] And it reminds me that did and the rest of my failures and interactions with him since.
[time=3024] And maybe those that you've experienced as well reminds me that he is a God of a second chance.
[time=3031] Now, we don't forget this, right?
[time=3033] We don't forget this.
[time=3034] And sometimes I think we want to.
[time=3036] Sometimes we even work real hard at kind of forgetting this part of it.
[time=3041] Maddie is an interesting little girl.
[time=3044] I mean, she's got some interesting things about her.
[time=3046] One of the things is that when she, and this may not be real typical with other kids, I said it Wednesday night thinking it was a very typical thing and I had about 150 blank stares looking back, thinking, oh my gosh, what'd you do to your daughter?
[time=3058] When she cries really, really hard, the blood vessels on the corners here of her eye, I don't know if it ever happens with your kid.
[time=3066] When she cries really hard, the blood vessels kind of break.
[time=3069] And then after she's done crying for like about the next half a day, she's got these broken blood vessels right here.
[time=3074] And I just share that with you to say, you know, that morning those broken blood vessels were a reminder to me that with my failures and with yours, there comes a second chance, but there's always consequences, right?
[time=3088] Right?
[time=3091] There are always ripples when the rot gets thrown in the pond.
[time=3096] When you or I let it fly, there is forgiveness granted and there are new mercies.
[time=3102] There's the nose nudged up against the neck in bed at 610, but there's also the blood vessels reminding me, reminding me of that which I have been forgiven.
[time=3114] I wanna end this morning with a look at Isaiah 43.
[time=3118] Isaiah 43 and Psalm 103, I just want you to look.
[time=3121] I want you to take this truth in.
[time=3124] I want you to just do your very best through the eyes of you and your own world and that which you face to be reminded of what God's word says as it relates to his great mercy and willingness to continue to walk through life with each of us.
[time=3138] Isaiah 43.2 says, when you pass through the waters, I will be with you.
[time=3143] And through the rivers, they will not overflow you.
[time=3148] When you walk through the fire, you will not be scorched, nor will the flame burn you.
[time=3153] Goes on in verse 18 to say, "For I am the Lord your God, the holy one of Israel, "your savior, I have given Egypt as your ransom, "cush and seba in your place." And then in verse 19, it says, "Since you are precious." Since you are precious, I love that word.
[time=3176] He views you and he views me as precious in his sight.
[time=3181] He's not mad at you.
[time=3184] He's not ticked off at you.
[time=3188] No, you are precious, he says, in his sight.
[time=3192] Since you are honored and I love you, I will give other men in your place and other peoples in exchange for your life.
[time=3201] And Psalm 103, the psalmist says it really well too.
[time=3205] And it's a great, great reminder.
[time=3207] Says there, "He has not dealt with us according to our sins, "nor rewarded us according to our iniquities." Goes on in verse 11 to say, "For as high as the heavens are above the earth, "so great is His loving kindness toward those who fear Him." As far as the east is from the west, so far as he removed our transgressions from us.
[time=3229] Just as a father has compassion on his children, so the Lord has compassion on those who fear him.
[time=3236] And then in verse 14, it says, "For he himself knows our frame.
[time=3240] "He knows what we're made of.
[time=3243] "There are no surprises with us, "and he is mindful that we are but dust." I want you to go back if you would, PowerPoint to 103.10.
[time=3255] 103.10, and I want to remind you this morning.
[time=3259] Why don't you stand and we'll close with this.
[time=3264] Just a reminder for all of us, that he is a God of a second chance.
[time=3273] And to just be, I think just, I mean, I hope it's encouraging for you as we say this, and as we close with this, I hope it encourages you.
[time=3281] I hope it also, I hope it also creates a sense of just deep appreciation in your heart.
[time=3289] I really hope it does.
[time=3292] Whether you know him today or you don't, I hope the fact of this truth stirs something in your heart, that as you leave this place, it reminds you and it encourages you as to how he has chosen to deal with you.
[time=3307] I want you just to remember this, okay?
[time=3310] For he has not dealt with you.
[time=3313] He hasn't.
[time=3315] He has not dealt with you according to or in light of
[time=3321] or in a way that would be commensurate with.
[time=3323] He hasn't, you guys.
[time=3325] He has not dealt with us according to our sins, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
[time=3333] Because if he had, if he had dealt with us according to our sins, if he had rewarded you and me in light of our iniquities, who would be here today?
[time=3347] Anybody?
[time=3350] No, the room would be empty.
[time=3352] No breath, no life, no nothing, but he hasn't.
[time=3359] Because he's a God of mercy, whose love for you is great and who wants nothing else than to pick you back up tomorrow and work with you again on the very things that you have failed at today.
[time=3371] And as long as you're in the game, as long as you're genuinely giving yourself to him and the word of God and the spirit of God and the people of God, he just wants to keep moving us down the road.
[time=3384] And if you don't know him this morning, he wants to, 'cause he knows you need to get picked up and to help and guided and loved and forgiven.
[time=3392] And so come and talk to us.
[time=3394] Also don't forget that truth to take home and your bulletin's there.
[time=3396] Somebody in your world, somebody in your will read that when you go home today.
[time=3400] Somebody in your world needs a second chance.
[time=3403] And then I think the second thing there in the bulletin, you'll see it there at the bottom of the page.
[time=3410] You probably need to go ask someone as well for a second chance.
[time=3415] So you give that some thought and you give it some prayer.
[time=3418] And you come talk to us today if we can help.
[time=3421] Father, thanks so very much.
[time=3423] For the chance to, as we often do, each and every week come and open up that which is right and true.
[time=3430] It speaks to the very issues of our lives, pulls no punches, it says it just like it is.
[time=3435] And we are so thankful for it.
[time=3437] Your word, a lamp unto our feet.
[time=3440] And God, I pray as we leave that every one of us would leave with hearts that have honestly and sincerely and genuinely opened ourselves up to you.
[time=3451] God, we may need to leave this place today and ask for a second chance again with you and someone else.
[time=3457] We may need to have a heart that's willing to grant one, yet again, either way, God, we trust you to move us toward those people who would help us understand that.
[time=3467] Give us strength, God, as we leave this place, to be a people that honors you.
[time=3472] And all the people agreed and said, amen.
[time=3475] (gentle music)
