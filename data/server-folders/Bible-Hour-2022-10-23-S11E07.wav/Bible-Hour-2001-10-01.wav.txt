[time=0] (upbeat music)
[time=30] - And that we are to offer our bodies as living sacrifice is holy and pleasing.
[time=36] And this is our spiritual act of worship, the God.
[time=38] You know, as I think of that, it doesn't mean we come in here and we worship.
[time=43] I mean, that's part of it.
[time=45] It's what we do out there.
[time=47] It's what we do outside these doors.
[time=50] How do we worship in that?
[time=51] How are we offering our bodies as living sacrifices?
[time=54] That's what we need to think about.
[time=56] That's what we need to dwell on.
[time=58] Lord, how can I offer myself to you?
[time=61] So as we sing this, as we worship you, think about the ways in which you and I can change.
[time=68] Think about the ways we can follow Christ, to worship Him not here only, but out there in the world.
[time=75] Sing it with us.
[time=77] [MUSIC - 22 seconds]
[time=102] - As we bow in adoration.
[time=104] [MUSIC - 57 seconds]
[time=165] Lord, may all the nations come and see the mercy you've given us.
[time=169] [MUSIC - 15 seconds]
[time=187] - Hi, I'm Kelly Bird pastor here at Blackhawk.
[time=194] And I wanted to just take a minute to let you know that there have been some exciting things going on in our family here at Blackhawk recently.
[time=200] Over the past several weeks, we have seen more and more people coming to join us for worship on Wednesday nights at Common Ground and also on Sunday mornings.
[time=210] The place has just been packed and people are coming and we're enjoying these times together.
[time=216] We're worshiping our God in spirit and in truth.
[time=219] We're hearing the word of God taught and maybe the most encouraging thing, at least from my perspective, as I see more and more people coming each week and leaving each week encouraged and challenged because they've been together with the people of God.
[time=233] They've been encouraged by the spirit of God and they've benefited from their time there in the word of God.
[time=240] And so I just want to invite you all over again.
[time=243] Many of you I know have home churches and that's a good thing.
[time=246] Stay plugged in and give yourself to those places.
[time=248] But a lot of you I know still don't have a place that you call home.
[time=253] And I just want you to know, God's doing some great things here.
[time=256] We're having a great time together, learning, encouraging each other.
[time=259] And I want you to be a part of that.
[time=261] So come and join us, would you?
[time=263] Any Sunday morning or Wednesday night?
[time=264] Wednesday nights at 6.45 here in the worship center.
[time=268] Sunday mornings come at 10 for some coffee and donuts and juice and then we kick in with the worship service at 10.30.
[time=275] So hope to see you soon.
[time=276] [MUSIC - 23 seconds]
[time=304] Sing that with us.
[time=307] [MUSIC - 240 seconds]
[time=552] - It's great to know that if Jesus is our Savior,
[time=562] if we know Him as a Savior, we don't ever have to be the same as what we were before we knew Him, because He's erased that whole part of my life, sometimes not the consequences of it, but He erased the sin.
[time=576] He's taken it away as far as the east is from the west, and we can sing a song like this.
[time=581] I will never be the same again.
[time=583] Why don't we stand and sing that together?
[time=585] Let's pour out our hearts to God.
[time=594] [MUSIC - 929 seconds]
[time=1524] So let's look at the book. You know in chapter 23 at the end of that chapter we find out that Paul is under the authority of Lisius and he's going to be killed because there are some guys, some of the boys in the synagogue have made a vow that they're going to kill Paul off. And they have committed themselves to find him and kill him, forty of them.
[time=1552] And Lisius finds out from Paul's nephew that that's the case. He sends 470 men, I thought wow that's pretty incredible, 470 men to take Paul off to Caesarea. He slips him out of prison by night and he goes off to Caesarea. It's about 65 miles away.
[time=1575] In verse 1 it says, "Five days later the high priest Ananias went down to Caesarea with some of the elders. Ananias the high priest. Not much good about him. It was said by Josephus in historian at the time that Ananias was insolent, greedy, hot-tempered and profane."
[time=1599] That's the chief mucky muck of the land. That's the most religious person in the church. That's the teacher of the teachers.
[time=1611] Insolent, greedy, hot-tempered and profane. I had some profs like him.
[time=1621] As a matter of fact, the school I went to was at one time a Christian college. And over the course of time dissipated into what I experienced, a New Testament survey professor that took me and some of the other basketball players home to expose us to mind-enlightening pornography.
[time=1649] That's Ananias. Being religious and keeping all those laws to the point that he would be elevated to this position of high priest. Insolent, greedy, profane.
[time=1667] Some of the elders are with him. He brings a few Jews along with him that are leaders in the synagogue at the temple.
[time=1676] And then they hire Tertulis. This is a Greek name, probably a Roman name, probably a Greek-Roman combination of this guy's ancestry.
[time=1685] And he's probably a Jew. And hired as, in those days, attorneys were really called orators because they were able to present the case in such a way that they might be able to win favor.
[time=1702] And it was really important that the magistrate or the justice, or in this case the governor, would really respond positively to this person who was representing Ananias and the boys.
[time=1718] And Tertulis is his name. They brought their charges against Paul before the governor. When Paul was called in, Tertulis presented his case before Felix.
[time=1731] Now, Felix is not the sweetest cat in the land either. You think Ananias had some problems. Listen to this description of Felix.
[time=1745] Ananias Felix indulged in every kind of barbarity and lust, the historian Tacitus says.
[time=1755] He exercised his power like a king in the spirit of a slave. They're trying to express all the power that a king would have and the anger and frustration that a slave would have.
[time=1774] Indulging in every kind of barbarity.
[time=1780] Well, you got Ananias and Felix. They connect. They understand where each other is coming from. And Tertulis begins.
[time=1794] He says, "We have enjoyed a long period of peace under you, Mr. Barbarian." No, he didn't say it.
[time=1802] And your foresight has brought about reforms in the nation. Everywhere and in every way most excellent Felix, we acknowledge this with profound gratitude.
[time=1812] But in order not to worry you further, I would request that you be kind enough to hear us briefly.
[time=1821] Now that I have your attention by lying to you and telling you that you're a wonderful person and tickling your ears, let me bring the charges now against this person Paul.
[time=1834] Verse 5, "We have found this man to be a troublemaker, stirring up riots among the Jews all over the world.
[time=1841] He's a ringleader of the Nazarene sect and even tried to desecrate the temple, so we seized him.
[time=1847] By examining him yourself, you will be able to learn the truth about all these charges we are bringing against him.
[time=1855] The Jews joined in the accusation, asserting that these things were true. So you have this group of boys that came along for the ride who were in the background going, "Yeah, yeah, we agree with him."
[time=1870] Who's with Paul? We've got Ananias, the boys, the orator, Paul's alone.
[time=1883] When the governor motioned for him to speak, Paul replied, "Who's Paul?"
[time=1890] We have Ananias, who represents where Paul was headed.
[time=1897] Saul, the young man who held the cloaks of the people who stoned Stephen, was rising to the top.
[time=1905] He calls himself a Pharisee of Pharisees, able to keep the rules that we made up the Pharisees.
[time=1914] You see, in order to be respected by the people, you had to do something more than they did.
[time=1919] And so they weren't satisfied with the law that God had prescribed for them in Leviticus.
[time=1927] And they made up their own rules, lots of them.
[time=1933] And Paul, Saul then, was the best at keeping them, the most religious of the religiosity.
[time=1943] He just, day after day, was moving toward the top. He connected with what Ananias was doing.
[time=1951] He understood those Jewish elders that were there, and he knew how Felix would respond to that.
[time=1958] And this is his simple response.
[time=1963] I know that for a number of years, you've been a judge over this nation.
[time=1968] I gladly make my defense. It's the place to go if you're going to be judged.
[time=1975] And so he's there to present himself and defend for himself his position, alone.
[time=1982] You can easily verify that no more than 12 days ago, I went up to Jerusalem to worship.
[time=1988] There, he's simply stating, they say I was trying to incite a riot.
[time=1992] Okay, now it's been five since I got here. They're saying that in seven days' time,
[time=1998] I was able to, now think about the communication techniques that were available at that time.
[time=2003] They're saying that in seven days, I was able to rally an entire fort, and he hadn't been back to Jerusalem for years.
[time=2012] First of all, it was a mere 12 days when I go when I first entered Jerusalem.
[time=2018] And he says I went there to worship.
[time=2022] My accusers did not find me arguing with anyone at the temple, or with anyone, or stirring up a crowd in the synagogues, or anywhere else in the city.
[time=2033] And they cannot prove to you the charges they are now making against me.
[time=2037] His simple defense is, I didn't do it, and they can't prove it.
[time=2044] I like that. The few times that I was innocent, when my dad and mom were accusing me of something I didn't do,
[time=2053] it's incredible how brief my defense was.
[time=2057] I suppose they could tell by the length of my defense, whether I was guilty or innocent, because I could wax eloquently when I was guilty, I'll guarantee you that.
[time=2071] However, I admit that I worship the God of our fathers.
[time=2076] The God of our fathers, he says. He's including Ananias and the boys.
[time=2086] As a follower of the way which they call a sect.
[time=2090] Now you need to understand here, a sect or a cult in those days.
[time=2095] The Roman government allowed for a religion to exist in the land, and it was Judaism.
[time=2101] And they did not permit other, you see, they were very, very shrewd in their leadership.
[time=2106] If you allow people to have allegiance to this God and allegiance to that one,
[time=2112] and this cult rises up, and this group rises up, it's really hard to keep your thumb on them.
[time=2118] But if you can elevate the leadership of the one existing emotional group,
[time=2125] which are people that are religious typically have a real emotional condition, if you can keep your thumb on them, and there's just one, you can control.
[time=2135] So they didn't tolerate any others.
[time=2137] When Tertolus said that he was the head of this Nazarene sect, Paul knew right away,
[time=2144] that's not good, and he includes the Nazarene sect the way, which Felix is really familiar with,
[time=2151] as a part of, as a fulfillment of Judaism.
[time=2159] And it is.
[time=2163] He understood that pretty well. Read Romans 9, 10, 11 sometime.
[time=2169] I believe everything that agrees with the law and that is written in the prophets.
[time=2176] Jesus didn't come to destroy, but to fulfill the law, he said.
[time=2181] Paul understood that completely.
[time=2187] And I have the same hope in God as these men, that there will be a resurrection.
[time=2192] Resurrection was taught by Jews in those days, about half of them,
[time=2198] both the righteous and the wicked.
[time=2201] So I strive always to keep my conscience clear before God and man.
[time=2208] After an absence of several years, I came to Jerusalem to bring my people gifts for the poor and to present offerings.
[time=2215] I was ceremonially clean when they found me in the temple courts doing this.
[time=2220] There was no crowd with me, nor was I involved in any disturbance, but there are some Jews from the province of Asia who ought to be here before you and to bring charges if they have anything against me.
[time=2231] These are the people that actually brought the charges in Acts 23.
[time=2235] It didn't show up here, and I didn't bring them along.
[time=2240] Or these who are here should state what crime they find in me.
[time=2245] When I stood before, they found in me when I stood before the Sanhedrin.
[time=2248] Unless it was this one thing, I shouted as I stood in their presence.
[time=2252] I was concerning the resurrection of the dead that I'm on trial before you today.
[time=2256] Remember, he did that in order to bring a real disagreement between the Sadducees and the Pharisees because they disagreed on that resurrection issue.
[time=2266] I got their attention.
[time=2267] He turned their aggression away from him toward each other.
[time=2274] Then Felix, Governor Felix,
[time=2280] who was well acquainted with the way, adjourned the proceedings.
[time=2283] How was he acquainted with the way?
[time=2285] We don't know that for sure, but we know something about his life and his history, and we know that he married Driscilla, who were going to be introduced here in a minute.
[time=2296] Driscilla was a 16-year-old wife of another man when Felix bumped into her.
[time=2302] He'd been married twice before, and he snatched this woman, whose grandfather was Herod the Great.
[time=2312] Actually, her great-grandfather was Herod the Great.
[time=2316] His son, Herod Aristobulus, was her grandfather.
[time=2321] Herod Aristobulus's brother, you've heard of before, Herod Antipas.
[time=2329] Remember, he killed John the Baptist, had his head cut off,
[time=2336] and then her dad, Herod Agrippa, was familiar with all of that,
[time=2342] and you might remember him.
[time=2345] So she had family history that obviously brought her into encounters
[time=2353] with people who were on the way.
[time=2355] I love that.
[time=2356] I've probably said this before in here, but you can hear it again.
[time=2358] I'd love to think about the reality that I'm on the way somewhere.
[time=2363] And I'm going to be on the way till I get there, and I'm not going to get there here.
[time=2371] My life is an absolute process, and the only final thing about this life
[time=2378] is the death of this body temporarily.
[time=2384] Paul said, "I run to win the race to get the prize
[time=2391] for which God has called me," Philippians chapter 4, 3, Heavenward.
[time=2398] He's not on his way to Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=2401] I'm not on my way to some other city where I'm called to be on the way wherever I am.
[time=2408] I'm called to be moving toward him in whatever location with whomever.
[time=2416] Christianity is frustrating sometimes because there's no arrival.
[time=2425] We're in the maturation process, knowing Jesus Christ the person who is the way.
[time=2432] It's not some list of to-do's that I have.
[time=2437] It's a relationship with a living God that lives in me and helps me move toward him when he fills me up with his spirit.
[time=2449] Now, I don't know how much Felix knew about that, but it says he has some understanding about the way.
[time=2459] He adjourned the proceedings, look at that.
[time=2464] He adjourned the proceedings, and when Lisius the commander comes, he said, "The person who originally let you go free there in Jerusalem and sent you down to me," you weren't really free.
[time=2474] When Lisius shows up, he's putting off a decision here.
[time=2479] "I'll decide your case." He ordered the centurion to keep Paul under guard, but to give him some freedom and permit his friends to take care of his needs.
[time=2488] I don't know what was going on in Felix's mind right then.
[time=2491] You don't either, because the Bible doesn't tell us what he was thinking.
[time=2494] It tells us a couple steps that he took, but I don't know about you, but I often just try to put myself in those positions and think, "Okay, what is the thought process that would lead you to go there?" There are probably lots of them, and you can be really, you're treading on thin, thin ice when you start to conjecture what the Bible doesn't say and give some kind of spiritual value to it.
[time=2515] Just for a minute, let's just think about it for fun and not think about it as far as something that we're supposed to do or respond to.
[time=2521] What would Felix be thinking? Well, here's a possibility.
[time=2526] He really enjoys his relationship with the Jews.
[time=2532] They revere him.
[time=2536] He does not want to put a wedge between him and Ananias and the boys,
[time=2542] because they represent a whole bunch of people out there.
[time=2546] What's the best thing to do if you feel like your heart's pushing you one way, something you should do, your conscience drives you toward doing what is right, but you've got these reservations because it might harm you personally down the road.
[time=2561] Well, the best thing to do is just put it off.
[time=2565] I've done that a million times in my parenting, haven't you?
[time=2569] We're at a location where they needed that.
[time=2573] And I had to wait. I still did it later.
[time=2577] But I had to wait because I didn't want to be around certain people when I did that.
[time=2582] They didn't know what I was lovingly kicking them.
[time=2586] I've put things off a lot of times.
[time=2589] I think that's what he was doing.
[time=2593] Then it says several days later, Felix came with his wife, Drusilla.
[time=2599] Drusilla, remember, 16-year-old that he'd snatched from another man's home, wife of another man, who was a Jewess.
[time=2609] He sent for Paul and listened to him as he spoke about faith in Christ Jesus.
[time=2615] As Paul discourse on righteousness, self-control and judgment to come, Felix was afraid and said, "That's enough for now.
[time=2624] You may leave.
[time=2627] When I find it convenient, I'll send for you."
[time=2634] At the time, he was hoping that Paul would offer him a bribe.
[time=2639] So he sent for him frequently and talked with him.
[time=2644] When two years had passed, two years, the Bible does that all the time.
[time=2648] We're moving through Paul's life.
[time=2650] And we realize, oh, he went to prison, had this discourse with Felix.
[time=2653] Things were going okay.
[time=2655] He's just attached to a centurion's garden.
[time=2659] Two years later, Felix was succeeded by Porchius Festus.
[time=2669] But because Felix wanted to grant a favor to the Jews, he left Paul in prison.
[time=2675] Because he wanted to grant a favor to the people that scratched his ears, put cash in his pocket, elevated him, he left the guy in prison.
[time=2686] This would indicate that he probably didn't think Paul deserved to be there.
[time=2694] And Paul made him angry.
[time=2704] What's Paul do?
[time=2706] He speaks about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come.
[time=2712] Now, this is the important part.
[time=2715] Understanding that history and knowing about those people, that's all interesting.
[time=2718] I really like it.
[time=2720] But what he said that isn't written here, but we can understand about righteousness,
[time=2729] what we can understand about self-control, and what we can understand about the judgment to come, can change your life.
[time=2742] Righteousness is justice in its widest sense.
[time=2746] Rendering absolutely to everyone what is due then.
[time=2752] We don't want to spend much time on this, but check out 2 Corinthians 5-10, talking about the Bema Seat judgment, it says those words in there.
[time=2759] Christians are going to stand before the judgment seat of Christ, and he is going to grant rewards.
[time=2764] It says we're going to receive what is due us.
[time=2767] I don't know what the other side is, for what we've done while in the flesh, whether good or bad, that's what it says.
[time=2772] That's Christians, not great white throne judgment, not separating sheep from goats.
[time=2779] Justice, absolute justice, righteousness demands justice.
[time=2786] In Matthew 5, Jesus said, "Unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness
[time=2796] of every Pharisee, including Ananias, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law,
[time=2806] you cannot enter the kingdom." I'll tell you right now, you cannot exceed it.
[time=2813] The Sermon on the Mount presented the case completely.
[time=2817] He said, "You've heard it said, thou shalt not murder."
[time=2823] I say to you, if you hate your brother, if you're angry with your brother,
[time=2829] you are guilty of murder.
[time=2832] You've heard it said, "Thou shalt not commit adultery." I say to you, if you lust after a woman in your heart this much,
[time=2841] you don't fulfill it, you just think about it.
[time=2847] You shall not enter the kingdom.
[time=2851] We can't get there.
[time=2853] When the Bible talks about God's holiness in Psalm 50 or 90, you look at those, "God's so holy that when he comes into town, a fire devours everything in front of him.
[time=2862] And thunder and lightning go crazy because he's holy and he's righteous."
[time=2869] He's totally other, that word holy, that's what that means.
[time=2872] Other than us, we try to put him in our box and define holiness, we can't do it.
[time=2879] And you have to be that holy, Paul said, the Felix.
[time=2883] You must be that righteous, Ananias, Jerusalem, if you're going to enter the kingdom.
[time=2893] And you can't.
[time=2897] Self-control, he preached about.
[time=2899] Controlling of passions and desires.
[time=2903] You can't do that either.
[time=2905] Now Paul, at this time, maybe understood, he wrote Galatians.
[time=2913] So he wrote about self-control being a fruit of the Spirit.
[time=2918] Self-control is not something that I can get up in the morning early and work out and work toward.
[time=2925] Self-control is not me doing something, it's giving up myself.
[time=2931] Self-control is a fruit of the Spirit of God and to the extent that the Holy Spirit fills me up.
[time=2938] And I then allow him to control me, he can control myself.
[time=2943] Can I lust less with the Spirit of God dwelling in me?
[time=2947] Yes.
[time=2950] Can I keep from having anger toward people with the Holy Spirit dwelling in me?
[time=2955] Can he fill me up and control myself?
[time=2957] Yes, but I can't.
[time=2962] I can't do it.
[time=2965] It's a fruit of his Spirit.
[time=2970] This is often used regarding the controlling of sexual desires.
[time=2974] I think probably because men connect with that.
[time=2977] That's the Bible's filled with it.
[time=2980] All it takes is a little glimpse of something that causes your mind and your heart to go where it shouldn't go.
[time=2986] All it takes is some song that has a lyric and it can move me there in a heartbeat.
[time=2993] But I know this, the older I get, and the more I'm in this, the less that happens to me.
[time=3004] Because he is self-control.
[time=3008] Thirdly, he talked about the judgment to come.
[time=3014] He knew something about that too.
[time=3016] Look at Daniel chapter 7, turn back there.
[time=3018] You precepts woman, you probably have this memorized already.
[time=3023] Daniel chapter 7, Paul understood these Old Testament passages that dealt with the judgment.
[time=3037] He was a Pharisee of Pharisees, he could teach it.
[time=3042] Daniel has this dream, and he says, "As I looked," verse 9.
[time=3048] Thrones were set in place, and the ancient of days took his seat.
[time=3052] I love that description of God.
[time=3054] The ancient of days, preceding days, took his seat.
[time=3061] His clothing was as white as snow.
[time=3063] The hair of his head was white like wool.
[time=3065] His throne was flaming with fire, and its wheels were all ablaze.
[time=3069] A river of fire was flowing coming out from before him.
[time=3073] Thousands upon thousands attended him.
[time=3076] Ten thousand times ten thousand stood beside him.
[time=3081] The court was seated, and the books were opened.
[time=3086] Then I continued to watch because of the boastful words the horn was speaking.
[time=3090] I kept looking until the beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and thrown into the blazing fire.
[time=3096] In my vision, at night, I looked, and there before me was one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven.
[time=3102] He approached the ancient of days and was led into his presence.
[time=3105] He was given authority, glory, and sovereign power.
[time=3108] All peoples, nations, and men of every language worshiped him.
[time=3111] His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed.
[time=3119] Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3120] You know what I noticed about that?
[time=3122] You know, we quote Scripture, it says, "Every knee shall bow." Every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, and we look forward to that day.
[time=3131] What does he do?
[time=3133] He says that goes where?
[time=3135] Every knee shall bow, every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[time=3139] The next phrase is to the glory of God the Father.
[time=3143] Jesus doesn't even get to receive glory then, because he's humbly obedient to the Father.
[time=3151] What an incredible thing.
[time=3154] Look at Revelation.
[time=3156] Go back there to chapter 20, verse 4.
[time=3158] Last book in the Bible.
[time=3167] Revelation chapter 20, verse 4.
[time=3173] I saw thrones, one which were seated, those who had been given authority to judge.
[time=3179] Now this is John at about age 90, probably, writing down what God reveals to him on the island of Patmos about things to come in the future.
[time=3189] And John saw this, and I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony for Jesus and because of the Word of God.
[time=3196] They had not worshiped the beast or his image and had not received his mark or their foreheads or their hands.
[time=3202] They came to life and reigned with Christ a thousand years.
[time=3206] The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.
[time=3212] Now, turn over to verse 11.
[time=3215] Then it says, "Then I saw a great white throne, and him who was seated on it, earth and sky fled from his presence."
[time=3223] Sounds like Daniel chapter 7, doesn't it?
[time=3227] And there was no place for them, no place for the earth and the sky.
[time=3231] He was not fleeing from his holy presence.
[time=3235] And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and the books were opened.
[time=3241] Another book was opened, which is the Book of Life.
[time=3244] The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books.
[time=3248] The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them.
[time=3254] And each person was judged according to what he had done.
[time=3258] Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire.
[time=3261] The lake of fire is the second death.
[time=3263] If anyone's name was not found written in the Book of Life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.
[time=3272] John writes that in the past because he saw it.
[time=3277] That's coming in our future, and it's real.
[time=3284] When Felix heard that, he was what?
[time=3289] Afraid.
[time=3292] The Bible says when Paul finished talking to him about righteousness, self-control, and judgment, he was afraid.
[time=3299] And his response was, "Get out.
[time=3302] Go away.
[time=3304] I'll think about this another time." And then maybe you'll bring me some cash next time.
[time=3313] I have a question for you this morning.
[time=3319] Have you ever just kind of put it off because it's convenient?
[time=3325] There were workers in those towers in New York City.
[time=3328] There were people on that bus the other day that the guy slit the driver's throat.
[time=3333] There was a motorcyclist that I saw that hit a head-on truck at 60.
[time=3339] Last weekend.
[time=3342] What if they just thought, "I'm feeling it.
[time=3347] I feel like he's calling me." Sounds like the truth.
[time=3351] I think Felix thought it was the truth.
[time=3354] It's just not convenient.
[time=3361] Have you ever been there?
[time=3363] Maybe you're there right now, this morning.
[time=3368] Are you sitting there right now thinking, "Man, I kind of feel like he did.
[time=3373] This is not comfortable." I don't like this, but it sounds right.
[time=3381] It seems like the truth.
[time=3386] I don't want to be judged like that.
[time=3389] I want my name written in the Lamb's Book of Life.
[time=3392] But I want to, it's just they're fanatics or whatever.
[time=3402] Maybe you know somebody that's there and you know they're there and you've been praying for them.
[time=3406] I want to end the service just a little differently today.
[time=3412] I'm so afraid that we just got Felix's everywhere.
[time=3418] So what I'd like to do is ask you to, when we leave, I'm not going to pray.
[time=3424] I'm asking you to pray.
[time=3427] I'd like for you to be quiet until you get out there.
[time=3430] I'd like you to pray from here to out there.
[time=3433] For the people that you know, that it's just not convenient.
[time=3438] They're conveniently lost and they might be conveniently lost on that day.
[time=3443] And we know it's God's job to do this saving, but he's told us to pray.
[time=3449] He's told us to share the gospel and you need to do that.
[time=3452] What I want you to do is I want you to get up in a minute.
[time=3456] And I want you to pray silently until you get out there.
[time=3459] For somebody specific that you know, unless it's you that somebody's praying for.
[time=3469] If it's you, if you're Felix this morning, if you're Jack sitting up here.
[time=3477] And you're just kind of waiting.
[time=3479] Don't wait another minute.
[time=3482] When we all get up, come down here.
[time=3485] We can tell you how to seal that so you can know for sure that you're saved.
[time=3499] [SILENCE - 30 seconds]
