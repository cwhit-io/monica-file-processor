[time=291] >> I desire to worship and obey.
[time=302] >> Hi, I'm Kelly, pastor here at Blackhawk, and I want to talk to you about what's coming up in the next couple of months here at Blackhawk.
[time=310] Before you know it, it will be, believe it or not, Christmas time.
[time=313] And Christmas time here at Blackhawk Ministries, as many of you know, means one thing, and that is the living Christmas tree.
[time=320] And this year, in the first two weekends of December, we will again bring to not only this church, but the greater community of Fort Wayne and northeastern Indiana,
[time=329] one of the greatest Christmas traditions in this community, and that is the living Christmas tree.
[time=335] But this year it's special, it's not just the living Christmas tree, it is the 25th anniversary of that great tradition.
[time=342] We've entitled it a Christmas to remember, and we're doing some things a little different this year with the tree as it relates to tickets.
[time=349] So I wanted to just tell you about it, if I could.
[time=351] First of all, our general admission, free ticket distribution, will continue to take place.
[time=357] That is Saturday, November 10th, mark that on your calendar.
[time=360] Saturday, November 10th, from 9 a.m. to noon.
[time=364] Come early, get in the line, as many of you have done in the past, and get those free tickets.
[time=369] Now, we're also making available this year, tickets for purchase.
[time=372] You can buy a reserved seat or seats, a block of tickets. You can buy a $10 reserved seat in our new reserve seating section,
[time=381] which will be down on the floor level, and you can purchase those tickets any time, Monday through Friday.
[time=387] Here on our south campus, you would enter in the rear of our south campus, follow the signs to the living Christmas tree ticket office,
[time=395] and you can purchase reserved seats, $10, and that allows you to come at your leisure and enjoy the concert.
[time=402] We're really looking forward to it.
[time=404] I believe it will be, as we've said, a Christmas to remember, and I hope you, I hope your family, your friends,
[time=410] and you know what, even those in your life, as well as mine, who need to come, and maybe for the first time be exposed to what Christmas is really about.
[time=421] Again now, to think about it, pray about those folks, maybe buy them a couple of tickets, and come join us for what will be, I think, truly a Christmas to remember. Thanks.
[time=451] Love her out my soul. All I'll continue by is in your hands.
[time=466] Gee, Tabs, I want you to know, I will follow you.
[time=479] All my days, no one else in history is why you.
[time=494] In history itself, he wants you.
[time=503] I'll find, no mana, you have bought me, and I will share eternity with you.
[time=520] It's all about you.
[time=526] Gee, Tabs, I know this is for you.
[time=534] For your glory and your gain is not about me, as if you should do things my way.
[time=548] You alone are God and I surrender to your ways.
[time=562] Gee, Tabs, I know this is for you.
[time=582] My soul, all I'll continue by is in your hands.
[time=594] Gee, Tabs, I want you to know, I will follow you.
[time=606] All my days, no one else in history is why you.
[time=620] In history itself, he wants you.
[time=629] I'll find, no mana, you have bought me, and I will share eternity with you.
[time=645] It's all about you, Jesus, and all this is for you.
[time=659] For your glory and your gain is not about me, as if you should do things my way.
[time=673] You alone are God and I surrender to your ways.
[time=685] It's not about you, Jesus, and all this is for you.
[time=699] Your glory and your gain is not about me, as if you should do things my way.
[time=712] You alone are God and I surrender to your ways.
[time=741] Gee, Tabs, I know this is for you.
[time=768] We love our study of the book of Acts this morning.
[time=772] We see Paul, once again, bound in chains, being mistreated, facing discouragement, and yet incredibly strong in character and faith.
[time=782] We learn from the Scriptures that it's in the face of discouragement and trials that we develop perseverance,
[time=788] and that God is faithful and that He gives us the strength to keep going and to keep trying one more time,
[time=797] one more time.
[time=799] I don't know Liz. I don't think I can get up for it anymore.
[time=804] Sure you can. You've just got to pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and give it one more shot.
[time=811] One more shot, one more shot. That's what I've been telling myself for the last 20 resumes I've sent.
[time=819] That's what I've used to get through the last three interviews. That line won't work anymore. I've used it up.
[time=826] But you can't stop now. You're so close. You've just got to realize that someone will see your abilities soon.
[time=836] Somebody's got to have a need for you.
[time=839] There's no need, Liz. Nobody's hiring. I couldn't get a job flipping burgers at Wendy's.
[time=845] There's already PhDs flipping burgers. I just can't set myself up for failure again.
[time=853] Failure? You're worried about failure? The only failure is doing what you're doing right now. Giving up.
[time=861] There's no failure in giving it another try.
[time=865] Oh well, that's easy for you to say. Sitting in your big office, try getting rejected about 20 times.
[time=873] Try having 20 people promise they'll call you back, and then sit by the phone like an idiot waiting for nothing all day.
[time=881] I just don't have anything left, Liz. My endurance is shot. Zippo, zilch, it's over.
[time=889] Okay. Let's stop right there. You've both got your lines down, which is good. Now we can really go somewhere with this.
[time=898] I want you to back up and think more about your character. Liz, you're trying to be an encouragement.
[time=905] You don't want Lucy to wallow in self-pity, so you're trying to be positive. Be positive but not syrupy, sweet like you've got all the answers.
[time=914] Lucy, the major thing you're feeling here is frustration, and we've got to see that.
[time=920] We've got to see the pain of being turned down and feeling worthless. Okay? Okay.
[time=926] Let's take it from the line. Lucy, let's take it from your line. One more shot. One more shot.
[time=937] One more shot. One more shot. That's what I've been telling myself for the last 20 resumes I've sent.
[time=944] That's what I've used to get through the last three interviews. That line won't work anymore. I've used it up.
[time=951] But you can't stop now. You're so close. Someone's got to see your abilities soon.
[time=957] Somebody's got to have a need for you. There's no need, Liz. Nobody's hiring.
[time=963] I couldn't get a job flipping burgers at Wendy's. There's already PhDs flipping burgers.
[time=969] I just can't set myself up for failure again. Failure? You're worried about failure?
[time=977] The only failure is doing what you're doing right now. Giving up. There's no failure in giving it another try.
[time=984] Oh, well, that's easy for you to say sitting in your big office. Try getting rejected about 20 times.
[time=991] Try having 20 people, promise they'll call you back, and then sit by the phone like an idiot waiting for nothing all day.
[time=999] I just don't have anything left, Liz. My endurance is shot. Zippo, Zilch, it's over.
[time=1006] Okay, we're coming along here. Liz, doing great. Just keep it up. Liz, Lucy, that was better.
[time=1016] But we still need more from you. Try to imagine this. You're discouraged. You're exhausted.
[time=1025] You've got nothing left. Liz here trying to get you to go out and apply again, and you really don't want to hear it.
[time=1031] Do you get the feel? Okay. Let's take it from your line. There's no need, Liz.
[time=1043] There's no need, Liz. Nobody's hiring. I couldn't get a job flipping burgers at Wendy.
[time=1049] There's already PhDs flipping burgers. I just can't set myself up for failure again.
[time=1056] Failure? You're worried about failure? The only failure is doing what you're doing right now, giving up.
[time=1063] There's no failure in giving it another try. Oh, well, that's easy for you to say, sitting in your big office.
[time=1071] Try getting rejected about 20 times. Try having 20 people, promise they'll call you back, and then sit by the phone like an idiot waiting for nothing all day.
[time=1082] I just don't have anything left, Liz. My endurance is shot. Simple. Silt. It's over.
[time=1089] Okay. I don't want to be too picky here, but Lucy, how can I say this? I've got to see more frustration.
[time=1099] Look, maybe I can't do this part. No. No, you can do it. I know you can. You've just got to feel the frustration and let us see it, okay?
[time=1108] You can concentrate on one line and get that down, and then the rest will be easy.
[time=1112] Let's just take it from your line about the 20 rejections and the 20 calls.
[time=1121] Oh, well, that's easy for you to say, sitting in your big office. Try getting rejected about 20 times.
[time=1128] Lucy, let me do the line for you once so you can see what I'm after.
[time=1133] We need to see you really discouraged and really frustrated. This line has both feelings in it.
[time=1140] Try something like this.
[time=1144] Oh, well, that's easy for you to say, sitting in your big office. Try getting rejected about 20 times.
[time=1150] Try having 20 people, promise they'll call you back, and then sit by the phone like an idiot waiting for nothing all day.
[time=1156] I just don't have anything left, Liz. My endurance is shot. Zippo, zilch, it's over.
[time=1163] Do you get the feel from that? Okay. Now you try it, and just do the first two sentences.
[time=1170] Oh, well, that's easy for you to say, sitting in your big office. Try getting rejected about 20 times.
[time=1182] That was about a four on the frustration scale. Now pick it up to about a six or seven.
[time=1187] Oh, well, that's easy for you to say, sitting in your big office.
[time=1195] Well, that was about a five. I can't do any more than that. That's as frustrated as I can be.
[time=1200] No, it's not. You keep trying to get me to do stuff I can't do. What do you want me to do? I can't.
[time=1207] I've seen you more frustrated than you sound here. When? When have you seen me frustrated?
[time=1213] Well, I don't know. I can't think of a time right now, but I know you have it in you.
[time=1217] Why do I have to be so frustrated? Why can't I just play it down?
[time=1222] You just expect too much of people. You're the only one who knows how it should go.
[time=1227] No, you try it one more time. I shouldn't have joined this group.
[time=1231] We're doing it again. Give her the lead to that line. Take it from failure. Go.
[time=1237] Failure? You're worried about failure? The only failure is doing what you're doing right now.
[time=1243] Giving up. There's no failure in giving it another try.
[time=1247] Oh, well, that's easy for you to say, sitting in your big office.
[time=1251] Try getting rejected about 20 times. Try having 20 people.
[time=1256] Promise they'll call you back and then stick by the phone like an idiot, waiting for nothing all day.
[time=1262] I just don't have anything left, Liz. My endurance is shot. Dippo, zilch, it's over.
[time=1270] I want to say thanks again for being here this morning.
[time=1276] We're so thankful for the chance to share times like this together.
[time=1280] Last week, if you were with us, and if you weren't, we're going to give you a quick review here.
[time=1284] Last week, in the 27th chapter of Acts, we talked about the storms of life.
[time=1290] We talked last week about the storms of life.
[time=1294] As we traveled with our friend, the Apostle Paul, in this case, the prisoner, Paul, bound and headed for trial and Rome aboard a Roman ship.
[time=1302] A ship that, as we read and studied through that passage last week, a ship that was caught off the coast of Crete and what was a violent and unrelenting storm.
[time=1312] And in the midst of yet another trial that this man faced, in the midst of yet another trial, as the winds of tribulation blew, as the waves of pain and uncertainty crashed around him, we watched and learned again from this man as he navigated, as he has navigated through the previous pages of this book, the ominous waters of a personal storm.
[time=1336] How did he do it? What did we see last week?
[time=1340] Two things we saw last week. As we watched Paul navigate yet again, the ominous waters of a personal storm, we noticed two things, and we'll remind you of those two things here this morning.
[time=1350] Number one, he rested in the presence of God.
[time=1356] In the midst of uncertainty, in the midst of struggle, in the midst of pain, in the midst of his personal storm, we see the Apostle Paul there in Acts 27 resting in the presence of God. And as we talked about that, we drew your attention to and talked about, even challenged you as a family to memorize Psalm 23, where it says, "Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no what? I will fear no evil.
[time=1381] For thou art where? With me.
[time=1385] For thou art with me. For thou art with me." He rested, Paul did, on that ship, in the midst of that storm, he rested in the presence of God.
[time=1397] Secondly, we saw that he encouraged others to hope in God.
[time=1401] In the midst of his storm, not only did he rest in the very presence of God, but he was willing to be in that situation, in the midst of distress, and in the midst of pressure and uncertainty, he was willing to be others-centered, was willing to give his heart and his time and his attention to something that was beyond his own personal circumstance. He encouraged others to hope in God, in the heat of his own storm. He saw the needs of others, prayed for others, talked to others, pointed others toward hope in God.
[time=1433] And we ended our time by asking the often asked question.
[time=1437] We looked at how he navigated the storm, and then we ended our time by asking the often asked question. You ask it often, and I ask it often.
[time=1449] Why? Remember? Why storms?
[time=1453] Why storms? Why do storms hit?
[time=1457] Why, as you often ask and as I often ask, why? Why do babies die?
[time=1465] Why do moms and dads get sick and never recover?
[time=1469] Why are children mistreated and sometimes abused? Why are families shattered by unfaithfulness or greed? Why do planes fly into buildings? Why does terror seem to escalate while peace and security diminish? Why? Why do the storms of life hit so hard? And if you remember, we did offer two very applicable reminders, I think.
[time=1493] Try to draw your attention to two things worth remembering.
[time=1497] Two truths that we find in God's Word that, in a sense, kind of brings some degree of clarity to those kinds of questions.
[time=1505] Remember what they were? Number one, we said this.
[time=1509] Don't forget the enemy. Don't forget the enemy.
[time=1513] We drew your attention to passages like 1 Peter 5, where it talks about the enemy as a roaring lion prowling about looking for someone that he might devour.
[time=1525] And he's able to do that in a sense because, as it says in Ephesians 2, he's the prince of the power of the air. Working today, it says there and the sons of disobedience. He's a powerful force. He's a very real force.
[time=1541] And as we said last week, he wants nothing more than to move in and through your life. And in the midst of temptation and the opportunities for you and I to deviate from that which God has called us to, he wants nothing more than to see your faith diminished. Nothing more than to see your choices move you and myself in directions of complete total ruin.
[time=1561] The enemy is a very real force.
[time=1565] Secondly, we talked about the fact that spiritual growth is at stake. Seems confusing at times. Seems almost cruel at times, but the fact of the matter is James 1 tells us that God allows trials. God allows trials that you and I might be spiritually grown, developed in character and heart and integrity through endurance.
[time=1589] The enemy in spiritual growth are some reasons why storms sit, but then you know what? If you remember back to last week, we kind of ended our time by almost in a sense kind of admonishing ourselves.
[time=1601] That's right because in the end, I think we agreed that the "why" question is really the wrong question. That's right.
[time=1613] Wrong understandable question, absolutely.
[time=1617] But in the end, probably the wrong question. We concluded as we left last week that nowhere, and it's really true, nowhere in the Bible is the focus on why a storm hits. But instead, the clear call of scripture is to what our response will be to the storm. As the winds blow and the waves crash, how will we respond? Not why. Not why. As hard as that is. Not why, but how will you respond? What will you do?
[time=1649] Not why, but what are you going to do now?
[time=1653] And I posed that question to you again this morning because you know what? There's a lot of you in the room today and the winds and the waves haven't ceased in the last seven days.
[time=1665] Or maybe it's new winds and new waves and maybe it's extremely personal, really up close or maybe it's a good friend or family member going through it, but you today again are feeling that sense of heightened winds and crashing waves. What are you going to do? Not why, but how will you respond? Will you endure or will you escape?
[time=1689] Will you endure or will you escape? Will you bail, opt out, or obey?
[time=1693] Will you retreat or renew your hope? Will you leave?
[time=1697] Or continue the painful process of learning how to love and how to trust? I will fear no evil. The Psalmist said for thou art with me. And I saw this this week and I want to just share it with you this morning. Please remember this as it relates to storms as it relates to your response, as it relates to our perspective, as it relates to our walk through those kinds of times.
[time=1721] Please remember this, he doesn't give hope. I thought this was very insightful.
[time=1725] He doesn't give hope by removing the storm. He renews our hope by giving us himself. Write that down.
[time=1733] Hold on to that truth. He doesn't give hope by removing the storm.
[time=1737] He renews our hope by giving us himself. And he promised to stay. Says in Matthew 28-20, you can jot that down. And I am with you always. Matthew 28-20, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.
[time=1753] He doesn't give hope by removing the storm. He renews our hope by giving us himself. And he is a constant presence. If you know him this morning, if you've given your life and your heart to him, if you live today in relationship with the living God, one of the greatest joys, one of the greatest comforts there is, is knowing that he is with you. He is with you always, even to the end of the age, for thou art with me. How does it go after that? For thy rod and thy staff.
[time=1785] Did you look at that this week? For thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
[time=1789] He is there with a rod to protect like the shepherds would in those days. They carried clubs and they would literally beat away those that would come to hurt or bring danger to. He has a rod. He has a staff.
[time=1805] The rod was used for protection. The staff was used for direction.
[time=1809] And his rod and his staff bring those very things to your life as he practices his presence with you. Many of us last week and this week too need our hope renewed. We need to lift our eyes to the hills and say with David, look with me at Psalm 121. Many of us in the room this morning in different ways, in different circumstances need to just kind of experience all over again the truth of what God's word shows us here in Psalm 121. Turning your Bibles back to the end of Psalms 121. We're going to pick it up right there in the first verse, going to read through the whole chapter, eight verses.
[time=1849] And I read this to you this morning and I invite you to read it with me and I invite you to take in these words and I invite you to be reminded again of these truths because again I'm suspecting that there are many, many in the room this morning and at a very personal level, you're experiencing the need again for his comfort and his guidance. And you know what? Even at a national level. I mean even at a level that every one of us in this room lives in today in light of all of the events that are taking place in light of all of the events that continue to take place in light of all of the uncertainty.
[time=1885] Whether it's a personal storm that's absolutely got you against the wall or the tension and pressure and uncertainty that every one of us lives with as we live and try to face these days, I found encouragement again this week in Psalm 121. I will lift up my eyes. You see it there?
[time=1905] I will lift up my eyes to the mountains. From whence shall my help come?
[time=1909] My help comes from the Lord who made heaven and earth.
[time=1913] He will not allow your foot to slip. He who keeps you will not slumber.
[time=1917] Behold, he who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep.
[time=1921] The Lord is your keeper. The Lord is your shade on your right hand. The sun will not smite you by day nor the moon by night. The Lord will protect you from all evil. You see that?
[time=1937] The Lord will protect you. It's an important verse right here.
[time=1941] The Lord will protect you, it says, from all evil.
[time=1945] bin Laden, anthrax, whatever else may come. Now listen, watch.
[time=1953] The Lord will protect you from all evil. He will keep your, does it say body? Does it say body?
[time=1961] No. It says what?
[time=1965] So, a few weeks ago when all this happened, I stood here and I reminded you that so many times in the midst of situations like this, we get very caught up in the here and now, in the temporal, in the finite.
[time=1981] And we begin to look at bodies, people, you know, stuff that's been impacted by evil.
[time=1989] And we're tempted to look at this and say, he will protect us from evil. What do you mean? We're getting killed.
[time=1997] And verses like this are a reminder to me, and I hope a reminder to you that this is all said from an eternal perspective. This is said with respect to things that matter and will matter forever, and that is not your body but your soul.
[time=2013] And he says, he will protect you from all evil. He will keep. He will hold on to.
[time=2017] He will guard your soul.
[time=2021] The Lord will guard your going out and your coming in from this time forth and forever. The Lord is your keeper.
[time=2029] The Lord will protect you from all evil. He will keep your soul. He will guard you.
[time=2037] I hope there's somebody. I hope there's somebody here this morning who needed to hear that. I know from me it was a great encouragement again to see that truth and be reminded of what it really means. Now others of you this morning, others of you here this morning, you're feeling strong and you're feeling excited. Your life is such today that you're full of hope and energy. And one author I read this week had these words for you. He said and I quote, some of you don't need it right now. Your storm has become a cruise.
[time=2069] Your journey of delight. If such is the case congratulations but remember, you don't know what tomorrow holds. You don't know where this road will lead. You may be one turn from a cemetery, hospital bed, financial ruin or empty house.
[time=2085] You may be in the midst of what is known as the calm before the what?
[time=2089] The storm. And though you don't need your hope restored today, you may tomorrow. And you need to know. You need to be and I need to be reminded to whom we must turn.
[time=2101] And I want to talk to you about that this morning. To whom we must turn. No matter the storm.
[time=2109] No matter the storm. Whatever the trial.
[time=2113] No bottle. No website. No purchase. Nothing illicit. No hobby. No pill or no program will do. We must God's word calls us to. Reality shouts it to us and clear and in no uncertain terms.
[time=2129] We must turn to God.
[time=2137] James 4 says draw near to God and he will draw near to you. We must no matter the storm. Whatever the trial. We must turn to God. In prayer, devotion, obedience and service. And we're going to talk about those four things this morning.
[time=2153] Those four things just mentioned. You sit here this morning and you look at me and you say okay, I must turn to God. Kelly, I've heard that a thousand times.
[time=2161] What does that mean? I mean be specific.
[time=2165] I mean be really, really clear. Because I'm in the midst of a storm. I'm in the midst of uncertain times. I'm in the midst of a life that needs some sense of direction and true north. I need to somehow understand how to keep moving in a way that honors God.
[time=2181] And you're saying turn to God. And so I'll do my best to answer that for you this morning. I'll do my best to give you as clear a picture of that as we can. What does it mean when I say to you turn to God? What does it mean when I say to you in the midst of whatever you might be facing, turn to God? Well here are some specific things and there's probably more than these four but these are four that and this was great to see. I spent some time this, these last couple of days just kind of going back over the entire book that we've spent the last, I don't know how many months, studying. And not only are these four truths evident through all of Scripture, but we've seen them again and again and again as these early band of Christ followers have faithfully given themselves to enduring the storms they faced. And so as we say to you this morning, turn to God in the midst of whatever it is you might face, we'll see this reported from Scripture in what we'll see this specifically lived out in the lives of those we've studied over these last few months. What does it mean to turn to God in a storm? We're going to go back over those four things I just mentioned. First thing I said was pray. Write it down.
[time=2253] Pray. In a storm? Pray. You want to turn to God?
[time=2257] Pray. Look what it says in Philippians. Philippians chapter 4 verses 5 to 7.
[time=2265] Philippians 4, 5 to 7 says, "Let your forebearing spirit be known to all men." You and I understand that forbearance is an act of endurance. forbearance is an act of persevering. "Let your forebearing spirit." We know that forbearance is called for in the midst of difficulty. Paul, as he writes to those here at Philippi, was sharing with them of the many difficulties that he had experienced and he says to them in verse 5, "Let your forebearing spirit be known to all men. The Lord is near. Be anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanks, giving, let your request be made known to God." And what? I'm the peace of God.
[time=2309] The wonderful, calming, direction-giving peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, shall guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. You in a storm?
[time=2321] What do you mean by turn to God? We'll start with this.
[time=2325] Pray. Talk to him, people.
[time=2329] Talk to him. Share your heart with him. Confess, send to him.
[time=2333] Thank him. Praise him. Ask him for help.
[time=2337] Tell him what you love about him. Tell him what's confusing about him.
[time=2341] Tell him what you're thankful for and the circumstances of life and where you need help or where you need clarity or where you need some kind of, ask him for it.
[time=2349] You beg him for it, plead with him for it. Talk to him.
[time=2353] Communicate with him. I don't know about you, but for me it continues to be something that I work at.
[time=2361] And it's one of those things that you wish I'll speak for myself.
[time=2365] It's one of those things in my life I wish I didn't have to work at.
[time=2369] I wish I was a prayer. I wish I was one who just naturally and consistently and fervently prayed.
[time=2377] And I find it being something that I know I need.
[time=2381] But I know he honors and blesses something. I know he longs for it.
[time=2385] Something, though, that I still continue in my own life to have to really, really work at. Found myself in the truck a few days ago.
[time=2393] And a tragedy hit.
[time=2397] My cell phone battery was dead.
[time=2401] And my car charged her cigarette light a thing and I didn't have it.
[time=2405] That is. Do you realize how much I like to talk to people?
[time=2409] Do you realize if I have a 20-minute drive or a three-hour drive that as hard as the drive might be, I look forward to talking to people. And I had a dead cell phone.
[time=2421] And it dawns on me.
[time=2425] Hey, you know what? You could talk to God.
[time=2429] You could spend some time with him. You could share some things from your heart.
[time=2433] Ask him some questions. Confess some sin.
[time=2437] Tell him what you love about him. Say to him what he already knows that you need help and direction and wisdom beyond your years.
[time=2445] See, again, I wish it wasn't a dead cell phone.
[time=2449] I wish it was just the natural outflow of my life and I'm working at it. But you, in a storm, turn to God.
[time=2457] What do you mean turn to God? Talk to him.
[time=2461] Wherever you are, whatever you're doing. And put aside times to talk to him, to share with him the realities of your heart.
[time=2469] Acts 1-14.
[time=2471] Acts 1-14, just again to be reminded of the, we don't have time to be fully reminded of the prominent role prayer played in this great book that we're concluding.
[time=2481] Acts 1-14 had a very difficult time, at a very scary time, at a very uncertain time. As this whole thing, back in chapter 1, was beginning to unfold and we saw these small band of faithful Christ followers up in this room huddled together wondering what in the world was going to happen.
[time=2501] Acts 1-14, these all with one mind were continually devoting themselves to prayer along with the women and marry the mother of Jesus and with his brothers. Acts 2, just a page over, maybe 2. Acts 2-42.
[time=2521] In the midst of a storm, how did these folks respond? They prayed.
[time=2525] They did other things, but they prayed. Acts 2-42 and they were continually, continually devoting themselves to the apostles teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. In a storm turned to God. What does that mean?
[time=2541] Talk to him. Pray. Number 2, be devoted. Write it down.
[time=2545] Be devoted. What do we mean by turn to God? We mean talk to God and we also mean be devoted or maybe better said stay devoted. And if you've been through a personal storm like I have a time or two, then you can identify with the phrase itself because the very essence of the storm, the very essence of the confusion, the very essence of the pain at the very crux of uncertainty and discouragement, there comes with all of that this kind of innate thing in you and I that kind of leads us to want to wander. Don't wander.
[time=2581] Stay at what's right.
[time=2585] If you're here this morning and you're thinking about wandering, let me just plead with you. Again, stay at what's right because right's always right and wrong's always what?
[time=2597] Wrong. Stay at what's right.
[time=2601] Don't allow a storm to be an excuse to roam to flake, to bail, or escape.
[time=2609] I think about Joseph in the Old Testament.
[time=2613] Some of you remember that story. I think about Joseph and the absolute storm that absolutely engulfed his life. I think about the mistreatment by his brothers as they threw him in the pit.
[time=2625] I think about him getting sold from that pit into slavery. I think about him having been sold into slavery being taken to Egypt and made a servant, a slave in the House of Potiphar. I think about Potiphar's wife trying to seduce this young man whose love for God is commitment to what was right, stood strong, and as he refused his Potiphar's wife and her advancements on him he's thrown into prison. In prison he's forgotten a time or two.
[time=2653] And in the midst of all of that he remains devoted to his God willing to endure whatever he may have to endure.
[time=2661] And as you read through that story in the book of Genesis you see God honor his devotion. In amazing ways I think of Daniel, a boy, probably 12 or 13 kidnapped by a crazed completely out of control guy named Nebuchadnezzar taken thousands of miles away from his mom and dad at age 12.
[time=2685] Thousands of miles away. Who would know?
[time=2689] Who would suspect? Who would even care if he deviated from the diet of his people. But now he stands strong and firm. In the midst of storms stays devoted. Doesn't wander. Doesn't flake.
[time=2701] Doesn't bail.
[time=2705] Turn to God. What does that mean? Pray. Talk to him.
[time=2709] Be devoted. And remember this.
[time=2713] You turn to God. You turn to God when you turn to your life. Some of you this morning when I see them say that it's painful. Some of you this morning when I say to you turn and look at your life. For some that's a painful glance because of the uncertainty and pain and confusion that that life holds today.
[time=2737] You turn to God when you turn to your life as demanding, as confusing or as trying as it may be and you embrace it.
[time=2749] And you put your arms around it. Joseph embraced the pit. He embraced the sail and the sled. He embraced his life. As confusing as it was.
[time=2761] Struggling this morning be devoted. Please be devoted. Where do we see that in Acts? Act 16.
[time=2769] Turn back a few pages if you would.
[time=2773] We see amazing devotion throughout this entire book. We've seen it chapter after chapter. Look at Acts 16. You want to see devotion?
[time=2781] You want to see some guys who didn't wander. You want to see some guys who didn't bail. Some guys who didn't flake. Some guys who didn't escape.
[time=2788] No, they stayed the course. Acts 16 22.
[time=2793] Paul and Barnabas, remember this incident at Philippi?
[time=2797] Paul and Barnabas, Acts 16 22 and the crowd rose up together against them and the chief magistrates tore their robes off them and proceeded to order them to be beaten with rods.
[time=2809] And when they had inflicted many blows upon them they threw them into prison commanding the jailer to guard them securely. And he having received such a command threw them in to the inner prison into what would have been solitary confinement and fastened their feet in the stocks but about midnight.
[time=2829] Paul and Silas had had enough and were grumbling and complaining plotting revenge on their own road toward quick gratification.
[time=2841] No, but about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns of praise to God.
[time=2849] And their faithfulness had immediate impact that says they're in everyone and the prisoners were listening to them. In the midst of a storm, the book of Acts teaches us and shows us again and again, turn to God, people.
[time=2865] It's the only place to turn. Turn to God. What does that mean? Pray to God.
[time=2869] Talk to God. Share your heart with God and be devoted.
[time=2873] Don't wander. Don't stray. Stay at it. Number three, be obedient.
[time=2877] Write that down. Be obedient.
[time=2881] We saw this week after week, chapter after chapter.
[time=2885] And our encouragement, our reminder, our exhortation to many of you this morning is this, the pain or discomfort of a storm, the confusion of a really tough stormy sea is not a free pass to sin.
[time=2901] Remember that. Make note of that today.
[time=2905] Stormy sea, waves crashing in, confusing time is not. Sometimes I think it is.
[time=2913] Sometimes I feel like it is. You?
[time=2917] Sometimes maybe you do too.
[time=2921] You take all that in, experience all that.
[time=2925] It keeps coming. It keeps coming. And there are times when in our flesh, I believe we feel as if there comes a point. It's like a meter, you know, and then this meter gets up to a point and we feel like, okay, that's the point where I'm allowed to kind of just do wrong. Does that make sense?
[time=2941] Just a little wrong. That won't be a big wrong. It'll just be a little wrong.
[time=2945] Because I can't take anymore. And the answer has got to be, you know, me somehow feeling better in the midst of this.
[time=2953] And so, no, it's not a free pass to sin.
[time=2961] Think about this. I want you to think about this. I want you to think about what you're called to.
[time=2965] A lot of different callings in this room.
[time=2969] A lot of us share the same calling in some respects.
[time=2973] In your relationship with the Lord, as a believer, follower of Christ, here today, what have you been called to? Many of you have been called to be mothers, wives, some husbands, dads, young people. You've been called by God to live lives of integrity, and character, and purity. We've been called as a people to carry and conduct ourselves in ways that would evidence not only the work of God in our lives, but to carry ourselves and conduct ourselves in ways that would bring glory to him. I mean, there is a calling on your life.
[time=3011] Several different callings, more than likely. If you're here this morning and you know him,
[time=3017] you know what? Paul had a calling. Paul had a calling.
[time=3021] Look at Acts 14. Go back a few pages.
[time=3025] And the pain and the discomfort of the storm.
[time=3029] From what we read, from what we see, never seemed to be for him. A free pass to sin.
[time=3037] A free pass to walk in a different direction. Acts 14, look at verse 19. It says in Acts 14, 19, "But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium." If you've been with us at all during our study of the book of Acts, you know, that's a common phrase. These Jews, they tracked this guy down wherever he went. The gospel and the truth was so offensive to their ears and their hardened hearts. They literally chased him down from city to city. And it says here in verse 19, that they came from Antioch and Iconium. And having won over the multitudes, they turned to Paul, picked up rocks as big as, you know, great fruits.
[time=3079] Canalopes is what the history books would tell us. It was the stone of choice for a stoning in those days. They stoned him, usually took anywhere from an hour to two hours to finish a person off to bring him to the point of physical death.
[time=3095] They stoned Paul and having stoned him dragged him out of the city, supposing him to be dead. But while the disciples stood around him, he arose and said, "That's it. Can't take any more." My meter hit. Count me out.
[time=3115] I mean, at least for a couple of days, I'm going to have to go get some relief.
[time=3121] But while the disciples stood around him, he arose and entered the city. Remember that? What a picture.
[time=3129] He goes back in to the city and the next day he went away with Barnabas to Derby for some R&R. No. And after they had preached the gospel, you see, Paul was called to preach the gospel.
[time=3141] That was his calling. That was what God had told him to do.
[time=3145] Preach the gospel. Represent me. Plant churches.
[time=3151] And after they had preached the gospel to that city and had made many disciples, they returned to Lisztra and to Iconium and to Antioch, strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith and saying through many tribulations. No kidding.
[time=3171] Through many tribulations, we must enter the kingdom of God. What do you call to be?
[time=3179] Be it. Be it.
[time=3183] Stay at it. Pray to him. Talk to him.
[time=3189] Confess your sin to him. Beg him for that help in the direction you need.
[time=3193] And keep talking with him. And be devoted.
[time=3197] Don't wander. Don't stray. Don't punch out.
[time=3201] And in the midst of whatever it is that might come and thank goodness we're not facing, you know, melon-sized stones. Thank goodness we're not being dragged out of cities, supposed for dead.
[time=3213] No, get up.
[time=3217] And because he is present and because his rod and his staff, they comfort you.
[time=3221] We get to keep walking down these roads that he's called us to be on.
[time=3225] Number four, you want to turn to God? Be a servant.
[time=3229] Be a servant. Pray. Be devoted.
[time=3233] Be obedient. And you know what? Be a servant.
[time=3237] Turn to God by serving. By giving. By extending yourself.
[time=3241] Your heart. Your time. Your money. Your spiritual gifts.
[time=3245] When your whole life becomes about giving.
[time=3249] Think about that. When your whole life becomes about giving. When your perspective on life as you walk through your family's life and as you walk in and through your church life and as you live your life on your block or in your neighborhood. When you become about giving.
[time=3265] When you become about giving.
[time=3269] Not, not getting, but when you become about giving.
[time=3273] The blessings. Kevin mentioned it last week as he prayed for the offering and he was right. The blessing.
[time=3281] The blessing that God brings. The unbelievable sense of his hand on your life, when we become about giving and offering and extending ourselves for him.
[time=3297] It's an amazing thing. Turn to God. Be a sacrificing servant. Acts 4. Acts 4, 32 and 35 gave us a great picture of this. We'll close with this.
[time=3309] Acts 4, 32 and 35.
[time=3313] What a great picture.
[time=3317] Turn to God.
[time=3321] Be a servant. Give. Extend your heart. Your time. Your money.
[time=3325] Your spiritual gifts. Be about giving.
[time=3329] Acts 4, 32 and the congregation of those who believed were of one heart and soul and not one of them claimed that anything belonging to him was his own but all things were common property to them and with great power the apostles were giving witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and abundant grace was upon them all. Verse 34, "For there was not a needy person among them." Can you imagine what it must have been like to be a part of that family?
[time=3361] To be a part of that church and that time there wasn't a needy person among them. For all who were owners of land or houses would sell them and bring the proceeds of the fails and lay them at the apostles feet and they would be distributed to each as any had need.
[time=3381] Now that's powerful enough.
[time=3385] Just standing alone. Don't forget the context.
[time=3389] Don't forget who this is. Alright? Don't forget the life.
[time=3393] Don't forget the circumstance that these people existed in.
[time=3397] This is the early church. These are the those faithful followers of Christ facing persecutions and heartache storms unlike anything you've ever endured facing storms unlike anything I've ever seen and they gave and they gave and they gave and they gave.
[time=3417] There was great freedom and there was great blessing in the extending of themselves their hearts their gifts.
[time=3425] What a great book it's been and what great lessons it has taught us.
[time=3433] Maybe the one I take away from it that just kind of sticks with you the most and maybe continues to mean the most to me is how you would and how I would handle respond to that which God allows to come our way. And my hope today is that you would along with me give more thought to maybe even this week in your devotions as you sit and spend time with him with your time around the Bible with your family and with your kids.
[time=3461] What better what better stuff to talk about teenagers and students and young ones as well on your own or with a small group are we praying are we praying are we devoted fully really completely are we living lives of obedience and is there a sense where you are and I am at the core of who we are really about giving and extending that's how we turn to God and my hope and prayer is that you would.
[time=3495] And I surrender
[time=3503] you alone are God and I surrender
[time=3509] to your ways.
