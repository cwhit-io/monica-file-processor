[time=420] - As we prepare for worship this morning,
[time=428] we want to shift gears a little bit and take you back a little bit to the summer.
[time=432] Many of you were out there, many of you were not at Stillwater camp when we had a chance to celebrate together, celebrate baptism and communion.
[time=442] Baptism, while not a means of salvation, is a chance for those that have been saved through the blood of Christ to share their testimonies.
[time=451] And it's really what we're about here, helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=454] And that's what excites us here at Blackhawk.
[time=457] So we want to take just a moment here this morning and share a heartbeat video from this summer at Stillwater camp.
[time=462] Watch and celebrate with us.

[time=990] I'm Kelly, pastor here at Blackhawk, and I want to talk to you about what's coming up in the next couple of months here at Blackhawk
[time=997] Before you know it, it will be, believe it or not, Christmas time and Christmas time here at Blackhawk Ministries
[time=1003] as many of you know means one thing and that is the living Christmas tree and this year in the first two weekends of December
[time=1010] we will again bring to not only this church but the greater community of Fort Wayne and northeastern Indiana
[time=1016] the greatest Christmas traditions in this community and that is the living Christmas tree but this year it's special, it's not just the living Christmas tree, it is the 25th anniversary of that great tradition
[time=1028] we've entitled it a Christmas to remember and we're doing some things a little different this year with the tree as it relates to tickets
[time=1035] so I wanted to just tell you about it if I could, first of all our general admission free ticket distribution will continue to take place
[time=1043] that is Saturday November 10th, mark that on your calendar, Saturday November 10th from 9am to noon
[time=1050] come early, get in the line as many of you have done in the past and get those free tickets now we're also making available this year tickets for purchase, you can buy a reserved seat or seats, a block of tickets
[time=1063] you can buy a $10 reserved seat in our new reserved seating section which will be down on the floor level
[time=1069] and you can purchase those tickets any time, Monday through Friday here on our south campus you would enter in the rear of our south campus follow the signs to the living Christmas tree ticket office and you can purchase reserved seats $10
[time=1084] and that allows you to come at your leisure and enjoy the concert, we're really looking forward to it
[time=1090] I believe it will be, as we've said, a Christmas to remember and I hope you, I hope your family, your friends
[time=1096] and you know what even those in your life, as well as mine, who need to come and maybe for the first time be exposed
[time=1104] to what Christmas is really about, begin now to think about it, pray about those folks
[time=1110] maybe buy them a couple of tickets and come join us for what will be, I think, truly a Christmas to remember
[time=1116] thanks
[time=1126] we were made to love and be loved
[time=1132] but the price this world demands will cost you far too much I spent so many lonely years just trying to fit in
[time=1143] now I found a place in this circle of friends in a circle of friends we have one father in a circle of friends we share this prayer that every ordinance over the road and all the lanterns are in
[time=1165] to the shelter of this circle of friends
[time=1171] if you weep, I will weep with you
[time=1183] if you sing for joy, the rest of us will lift our voices to one
[time=1190] but no matter what you feel inside, there's no need to pretend that's the way it is in this circle of friends in a circle of friends we have one father in a circle of friends we share this prayer that we'll gather together no matter how the highway bends
[time=1218] I will not lose a circle of friends among the nations, tribes and tongues
[time=1229] we have sisters and brothers and when we meet in heaven we will recognize each other joy so dear love so sweet life will never end in a circle of friends we have one father in a circle of friends we share this prayer that it will not be long before all the lanterns to the shelter of this circle of friends
[time=1273] that it will not be long before all the lanterns to the shelter of this circle
[time=1284] of friends
[time=1291] well good morning
[time=1307] what a great morning so far just sitting down there this morning thinking again as I often think about thankful I am for the whole music thing the whole worship opportunity that God gives us I don't know about you I hope you see it this way I really do I hope you understand that God gifts people He gives people passions He gives them talents and gifts and you know I sit down there in that front row and I watch all these people sing and I watch this guy bang this piano every week and he does it like nobody else and I watch Eric playing the guitar and I listen to Doug blow the big sax there and I think and I think to myself you know what you wouldn't know what to do with me you would have to disown me I would fall apart I would completely lose it if I couldn't talk if I had to shut up if I just couldn't speak what was on my heart every week to all of you realize the condition I would be in these people get to do the thing they were made to do and they do it with all their heart and they do it because they love God and they do it because they love this church and I just sit down there and I just thank God every week for the hours and hours they put in the heart they have and the chance they get to express who they are and use their gifts and their talents so I hope you're as thankful as I am Hey I want to tell you what those do
[time=1401] that song that the the song that the gals just sang so well circle of friends that's about the church people that's about the body of Christ and that's about the relationships that we share in this room together and the church the church need I tell you I don't think I need to the church today this church today reminds itself in an incredible spot we find ourselves today people in the midst of a culture that is absolutely on its heels we find ourselves in the midst of a society today that is being bombarded from all sites with all kinds of issues and all kinds of fears and all kinds of insecurities questions questions are being asked and I want to just tell you this morning that we're going to do our very best and it may not be you know I mean we're going to do all that we can do and I'm going to ask you this morning to join us in this over the next three weeks we are going to do with God's help and for his glory and by his grace we are going to do all that we can to present to this to this community of northeastern Indiana we are going to do all that we can to present to them that which every person in the world today needs every person in this community and that is direction and help some slides are going to come up and we want to just let you know that this great postcard you see here one nation under God with the flag in times like these we need answers like this this is a three week series that we're going to start next this coming Wednesday in the following Sunday morning there you see the dates invite friends to join us as we look to God's word for in times like these I wrote some things down over the last several weeks we have found ourselves struggling at times this is going to be on the postcard that got sent out a couple days ago over these last several weeks we have found ourselves struggling at times to make sense of the painful and confusing events in our world the loss of life the loss of trust and security the increasing presence of fear and uncertainty all of it has led many of us to ask questions that concern us here at Blackhawk as we look to the one and only source of truth and direction direction needed in times like these that postcard that flag with those praying hands on the flip side it has what I just read to you that got sent out to all of 46815 and all of 46835 24,000 cards got sent out this week and we prayed about it and we're hoping that God will do what He will do with that there are there are flyers available if you want to pick a few up and pass them out give them to a friend, give them to a neighbor give them to a co-worker here's the deal this morning here's what I'm saying all this we're thankful for the mail and we're thankful for the graphic folks in the communications department here at Blackhawk who helped put all that together and got that sent and that's a good thing ask somebody ask somebody make this an us effort make this a family effort young and old newly saved and those who have been convinced for years every one of you who is it in your life who are the individuals on your street at your work in your own family every one of you would you be willing in days like these those people need answers like this and you have the opportunity and I have the opportunity to invite to say hey you know show them the card the questions that came up on the screen there where's God does he care is he in control and if he does why am I so afraid why do tragic life shattering things happen to good people we're going to answer look to God's word and provide insight for those kinds of questions and probably ask a few others as well so please please every one of you give some thought give some thought right now and begin to pray right now give me the courage and give me the opportunity to invite him or her or them to come over the next three weeks this is where we'll be and we'd covet your prayers and your involvement in the endeavor amen?
[time=1673] all right give it some thought this morning is your vision
[time=1681] is your vision almost two years ago some of you know this maybe some of you don't almost two years ago I had my eyes lasered I went under the old laser knife and had lasek done and a good buddy of mine we went up and checked it out up in Canada where they had kind of originated the lasek process and researched it and figured out it was a good place to go it was a little bit less expensive as well and so he went up first I kind of sent him first to see how it went he went up first actually I was supposed to go with him but some things happened and he came back and it was great and then Cabra and I and I think the girls went up several weeks later and I got my eyes lasered and you go through all the procedures the pre-op checkups and they get it all figured out exactly what they're going to do and you go in this room and you lay down on this table I lay down on this table and they kind of there's this big machine and it just kind of comes over you and the guy is sitting on a stool kind of at the end of the table and he's kind of looking over you and he gets your head all placed just right they kind of secure your head and just to make sure you know it like it doesn't move and they don't want to like laser your nose they just want to make sure everything's nice and still and then before you know it it's just really simple this contraption comes over you and there's this red light and they tell you to look at this red light and they give you some drops oh and first they have to kind of immobilize your eyeball and so they put this socket kind of rubberized socket over your eyeball to keep it still and they had some trouble getting mine still and I was trying my best and they're pressing this rubberized socket down on my eye and finally they got it and then all of a sudden they start and you smell something you say doc what's the smell and he says it's okay it's just your flesh don't worry about it and the laser's actually doing its thing on your eyeball on the cornea they're just getting it all fixed and it takes a few minutes on this side and a few minutes on this side and before you know it 10-15 minutes goes by we're done they unstrapped my head I sit up and I mean it was a little blurry right then but I could tell it was different really different and they'd send you to the hotel and they'd tell you to get a little brief meal and they'd give you this pill to take and it's in this little envelope thing and I never forget getting to the hotel and down in my turkey sandwich and I was all excited to take this pill and I opened up a little packet and popped it out and there's things like a stone it's like a boulder it's like this huge pill and I was all excited and I took this pill the pill first and read the thing and it says prepare yourself for a 14-hour nap 12 to 14 hours I'm like man where do I get a pack of these we could take them home and we could give them to our kids and it'd be great so I take this pill and boom I'm gone there's a best nap I've ever had at the drool going on the pillow the whole thing and I'm telling you I woke up I woke up 14 hours later and I could see and I hadn't been able to see for years I mean I could see I could see clearly I could see you know the way you got intended you to see I could see perfect I could see leaves on trees I didn't realize were there I could see things in my kids' faces from a distance I never used to get I mean I could see amazing I read this 1 Thessalonians 1 6 to 10 I read this passage people and I get a vision I read this passage 1 Thessalonians 1 verses 6 to 10 and I can see clearly I can see a vision of a church a church the way a church is supposed to be and it's amazing what clear and perfect vision does to one's heart and to one's soul I read 1 Thessalonians 1 6 to 10 and I get a picture a vision and I can see clearly in those verses a church the way a church is supposed to be a church the way we can be and I want to ask you that this morning what kind of a church what's your vision like today as you think about your part in a local body what kind of a church do you really want to be a part of what kind of a church what kind of a family do you really want to be a part of what kind of a church do you really want Blackhawk to be do you want Blackhawk to simply be a building you okay with that you okay with this being a big building with lots of seats that folks come into good things and leave some like it that way some prefer it that way do you want to be a part of a church that's a building a good building a strong building a big building is that what church is for you do you want to be a part of a church that's a club a lot of those around these days churches that are in essence clubs out wondering who got what membership who functions and lives in what circles who drives what who lives where how much does he make how much does she make how many kids do they have where do they go to school where do they go to college what do you want to be a part of a building you want to be a part of a club or do you want to be a part of a life-giving life-growing light in a very very dark world offering hope and forgiveness to a community, to a world that lives around you that's in desperate need of that hope in desperate need of that forgiveness do you want to be a part of a building a club or a life-giving life-growing light in a very very dark world by the grace of God for the glory of God well we see here in 1 Thessalonians 1 an amazing group of people and I want to ask you this morning I don't want to invite you to look with me and investigate what it was that was so very special about this church that the Lord through the pen of Paul kind of lifts up here for us as a model family of believers what was it that was so special about these people what made them such an example for us today and what you're about to see on your own I hope later tonight as you continue in this study here of 1 Thessalonians 1 what you'll see what we'll look at what we're going to talk about in these next few minutes I'll tell you this has absolutely nothing absolutely nothing to do what made them so good what made them a model church what made them exemplary it has absolutely nothing to do you'll see with music style denomination affiliation or church name or the countless other issues that you and I at times want to debate lose sleep over and argue about what you will see and what I have seen all over again this week is a church that was a family and they were a model family and God through the pen of Paul lifts them up today as a mature church because of their hearts and because of their perspectives the way they carried and conducted themselves as it related to things that mattered things that had to do with being a life giving light in the midst of a very dark world number one get ready to go here we're going to go quick number one this church personified Christ this church they personified Christ they though humanly limited you'll understand how I say that they copied Christ that's right look at verse six 1 Thessalonians 1 6 Paul says you also look up at verse 1 real quick Paul and Sylvanas and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians and God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ grace to you in peace we give thanks to God Paul says always all of you there in that church making mention of you in our prayers why well look at verse six you also became it says imitators of us and of the Lord having received the word in much tribulation with the joy of the Holy Spirit stop there Paul says here that they had become in my in my version it says imitators the word in the Greek means it means to mimic it means to mimic maybe your kids like my kids in the car or back in the room or down the basement you know they they do this copycat thing and it drives one of them nuts because what the one says the other says and they just won't stop they're mimicking and Paul says you're a good church we lift you up as a model for all because number one you have become imitators mimics of Jesus Christ it means to mirror what one does on this side the other does as well on the other synchronized and connected in motion Paul said in 1 Corinthians 11 1 be imitators he said it again to the church at Corinth be imitators of me just as I also am of Christ in Philippians 4 and 9 you can turn there if you'd like Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians Colossians, Philippians 4 and 9 Paul again to the church at Philippi said the things the things you have learned and received and heard and seen in me practice these things do them mimic me same idea there copy me the things that you have learned and received and heard and seen in me practice these things in the God of Peace it says there shall be with you in Philippians we learn that the church they're mimicked they followed in motion their leader Paul who was simply imitating Christ what he did they did what he taught they taught what he said they followed brings two questions to mind today two questions are you imitating? you are you are you really are you truly are you sincerely giving it all you've got again with his help and for his glory are you those of you that sit in this room this morning are you imitating really following truly copying in your deeds in your words in your attributes publicly and privately the person of Christ second question that comes to my mind is am I helping?
[time=2370] am I helping?
[time=2372] as their leader Paul said follow me as I follow Christ am I providing?
[time=2382] are we providing?
[time=2384] as staff and as elders something for you to follow and mimic elders are you imitating Christ are you copying him in word indeed in attitude publicly and privately staff senior staff and extended staff are we able to watch you and be with you in your life in the everyday and in essence do what you do and go where you go and say what you say and teach what you teach ministry leaders Sunday school teachers school staff faculty administration these passages remind us that part of the imitating process is having someone to help imitate having someone to follow from and so we ask this morning all of us are we really and first thessalonians this church personified they imitated him and don't miss the end of verse six there back to first thessalonians one what made it possible don't miss that what made the imitation process possible because they had received the what the word they had put themselves in positions to receive the word of God it says they're in much tribulation are you putting yourself again and again and again in that situation this church number two exemplified Christ look at verse seven you became imitators in verse six and verse seven so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia the word for example in the original language meant a mark or deep wound left by a blow write that down example in the Greek it means a mark or deep wound left by a blow the word example in the Greek was what happened when a when a white hot branding iron forcibly pressed onto the the rear side of a of a cow or a horse or an animal that would leave a brand that would leave a mark left by a blow and that's what this word example is about and when that cow or when that horse was branded here's the point the brand said to all who walked by and anyone who would ever from that day forward look at that cow or see that horse that brand said one thing it said that cow belongs to him this horse is property of and is owned by him and Paul says to the church thessalonica you're a model church because not only have you imitated Christ but you have become an example there is on you a mark left by a blow that causes others in your world where you work or where you live to as you walk through your life look at you and say oh oh he she they belong to to him and it's clear the phrase also means in the Greek easily recognizable so you ask yourself this morning are you?
[time=2600] are you?
[time=2602] in the everyday of your life wherever it is you're going whatever it is you're doing whoever it is you're with as a part of the family we are to walk through life not with obnoxious spirits not with megaphones broadcasting in a sense but no living in a way whereby it's easily recognizable who you are who you belong to a mark left by a blow that said this person these people are mine these people are mine this church number three amplified Christ amplified Christ there's salvation in verse 8 see that for the word of the Lord has sounded forth from you not only in Macedonia when every place your faith toward God has gone forth so that we the apostles we have no need to say anything powerful statement this church amplified Christ watch this their salvation their hope the purpose and reason for living they've been given when they accepted Christ it meant the world to them it meant absolutely everything to these people their faith and their salvation and what they've been given what they had embraced when they embraced Christ their commitment to follow him it meant so much to them that you couldn't have paid them here's the point you couldn't have paid them any amount of money to keep them quiet that phrase in the original language sounded forth carries with it the idea of a trumpet a trumpet blaring out it sounded and you just got a picture that Paul says you imitated Christ verse 6 you became an example to those in your world and as you walked through your world and lived your lives you sounded forth in appropriate ways like a trumpet the hope that was within you Romans 10-13 is a good verse to be reminded of you can turn there if you want to or I can read it to you it says in Romans 10 something you and I need to often be reminded of it says in Romans 10-13 for whoever listen now for whoever will call upon the name of the Lord will be saved how then shall they and how shall they believe in him whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher again I told you a few weeks ago that word in the original language simply means communicator don't look at me I'm looking at you how will they hear unless you open your mouth and say hey these are tough days we're living in aren't they?
[time=2794] you know what for the next three weeks at our church we're going to talk about what's going on in the world today and what God's word has to say by way of an answer and some direction and some things to think about can you say that?
[time=2812] can you say that?
[time=2814] one person can say that can you say that?
[time=2818] half of you said yes can you say that?
[time=2822] can you all say that?
[time=2824] well okay yeah open your mouth and you won't even talk in here can you say to somebody?
[time=2834] can you look him in the eye and say hey you know what I love my church we got so many great things going on I'd love for you to come and just join me one week pick you up we'd go sit together have some lunch afterwards it'd be great can you say that?
[time=2850] yeah how are they going to know?
[time=2856] unless they believe and how can they believe unless they hear and how can they hear without a communicator?
[time=2862] all of you interesting here as you read that verse back in 1 Thessalonians 1 in their region think about this now I don't think this is exaggeration I don't think this is being overstated I think this is how it was I don't think Paul would have said it if it wasn't this way go back to verse 8 for the word of the Lord has sounded forth from you not only in Macedonia and Akaya but also in every place your faith toward God has gone forth so that we have no need to say anything these people sounded forth these people were trumpets in their region Paul says they had spoken of so much there was nothing left to say and what if that were the case here what if that were the case in north northeastern Indiana what if it what if someday that's how it was what if everywhere I went what if everywhere we went to try and share the gospel they said oh wait time out it's all right you know because I live by I live by the long breaks we're neighbors with the catons I live actually out chair busco you know Dell and Agnes yeah you don't have to say anything to me because we live by your people what if every time we tried to do what Paul and the apostles were trying to do we bumped into people who didn't just live by you but who worked with you and I could just go around this room and just name name after name after name and what would it be like someday to hear people say hey time out save your breath because you know what I've heard it all but better than hearing it all I've seen it because I work with so and so and I work with him and I work with her and man don't forget Ephesians 4 it says that God gave some as pastors and teachers to equip to equip the saints for the work of the ministry it's you it's all of you number four this church identified with Christ for they themselves verse nine you see that for they themselves report about us what kind of a reception we had with you and how you turn to God from idols to serve a living to serve a living in true God they were as a people prior to this church at Thessalonica coming together they were as a people moving in this direction and as you study Thessalonians history you realize that this town and these people who later became the church they were at one time a group of people completely committed to orgies sorcery illicit temple behavior idol worship and debauched living and then God called that tap on the shoulder thing then God called initiating the salvation process and they turned Paul says they turned they chose faith over folly they chose forgiveness over futility they were going in this direction God calls taps them on the shoulder begins the salvation process and they choose and they turn and they go the opposite direction 180 degrees which is salvation
[time=3068] that's salvation we understand that yeah that's salvation when you believe and embrace
[time=3079] what Jesus did for you and in the believing and in the embracing you turn he says you turned you turn because you have to no you're missing
[time=3091] the point and probably not saying if that's the mind that's not because you have to it's because you what because you want to because you've been saved because you've spiritually been given new life and all of a sudden you see where you were going and you realize where that was heading and by the grace of God he tapped you remember he begins to draw you and you choose and you go this way and you go wow new life a second chance because I
