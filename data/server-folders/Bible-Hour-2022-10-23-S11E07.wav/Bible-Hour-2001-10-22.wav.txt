[time=30] [MUSIC - 394 seconds]
[time=431] - As we prepare for worship this morning,
[time=437] we want to shift gears a little bit and take you back a little bit to the summer.
[time=442] Many of you were out there.
[time=444] Many of you were not at Stillwater camp when we had a chance to celebrate together.
[time=449] Celebrate baptism and communion.
[time=452] baptism while not a means of salvation is a chance for those that have been saved through the blood of Christ to share their testimonies.
[time=460] And it's really what we're about here helping seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=464] And that's what excites us here at Blackhawk.
[time=466] So we want to take just a moment here this morning and share a heartbeat video from this summer at Stillwater camp.
[time=472] Watch and celebrate with us.

[time=2132] the denomination affiliation or church name or the countless other issues that you and I at
[time=2141] times want to debate, lose sleep over and argue about. What you will see and what I have seen all
[time=2150] over again this week is a church that was a family and they were a model family and God,
[time=2156] through the pen of Paul lifts them up today as a mature church because of their hearts and because
[time=2162] of their perspectives, the way they carried and conducted themselves as it related to things that
[time=2169] mattered, things that had to do with being a life giving light in the midst of a very dark world.
[time=2181] Number one, get ready to go here, we're going to go quick. Number one, this church personified Christ. This church, they personified Christ. They though humanly limited, you'll understand how I
[time=2194] say that, they copied Christ. That's right, look at verse 6, 1 Thessalonians 1, 6 Paul says you also
[time=2203] look up at verse 1 real quick, Paul and Sylvanas and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians and God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, grace to you in peace. We give thanks to God, Paul says,
[time=2214] always for all of you there in that church making mention of you in our prayers. Why? Well look at
[time=2220] verse 6, you also became, it says, imitators of us and of the Lord, having received the word in much
[time=2228] tribulation with the joy of the Holy Spirit. Stop there, Paul says here that they had become, in my
[time=2236] version it says imitators, the word in the Greek means, it means to mimic. It means to mimic, maybe
[time=2243] your kids like my kids in the car or back in the room or down the basement, you know, they do this
[time=2249] copycat thing and it drives one of them nuts because what the one says the other says and they just won't stop, they're mimicking and Paul says you're a good church. We lift you up as a model
[time=2262] for all because number one, you have become imitators, mimics of Jesus Christ. It means to mirror what
[time=2270] one does on this side, the other does as well on the other, synchronized and connected in motion.
[time=2276] Paul said in 1 Corinthians 11 1, be imitators, he said it again to the church at Corinth,
[time=2282] be imitators of me just as I also am of Christ. In Philippians 4 and 9 you can turn there if you'd
[time=2291] like Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Philippians 4 and 9.
[time=2298] Paul again to the church at Philippi said the things, the things you have learned and received
[time=2306] and heard and seen in me, practice these things, do them, mimic me, same idea there, copy me, the things
[time=2316] that you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, practice these things in the God of peace.
[time=2323] It says there shall be with you. In Philippians we learn that the church they're mimicked, they followed in motion their leader Paul who was simply imitating Christ, what he did they did,
[time=2335] what he taught, they taught, what he said they followed, brings two questions to mine today, two questions, are you imitating, you, are you, are you really, are you truly,
[time=2350] are you sincerely giving it all you've got again with his help and for his glory are you,
[time=2357] those of you that sit in this room this morning are you imitating, really following, truly copying
[time=2364] in your deeds, in your words, in your attributes publicly and privately the person of Christ.
[time=2372] Second question that comes to my mind is am I helping, am I helping as their leader Paul said
[time=2385] follow me as I follow Christ am I providing are we providing as staff and as elders
[time=2395] something for you to follow and mimic elders are you imitating Christ are you copying him in
[time=2403] word indeed in attitude publicly and privately staff senior staff and extended staff
[time=2410] are we able to watch you and and be with you in your life and the every day and in essence do what you do and go where you go and say what you say and teach what you teach
[time=2420] ministry leaders Sunday school teachers school staff faculty administration
[time=2427] these passages remind us that part of the imitating process is having someone to help imitate
[time=2437] having someone to follow and watch and learn from and so we ask this morning all of us are we
[time=2445] really and first thessalonians this church personified they imitated him and don't miss
[time=2453] the end of verse six there back to first thessalonians one what made it possible don't miss that what
[time=2459] made the imitation process possible because they had received the what huh the word they had put
[time=2471] themselves in positions to receive the word of God it says they're in much tribulation
[time=2478] are you putting yourself again and again and again in that situation this church number two
[time=2486] exemplified Christ look at verse seven you became imitators in verse six in verse seven so that you
[time=2492] became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and achaia the word for example in the original
[time=2500] language meant a mark or deep wound left by a blow write that down example in the Greek it means
[time=2508] a mark or deep wound left by a blow the word example in the Greek was what happened when a
[time=2517] when a white hot branding iron when a white hot branding iron was forcibly pressed
[time=2525] onto the the rear side of a of a cow or a horse or an animal that would leave a brand that would
[time=2535] leave a mark left by a blow and that's what this word example is about and when that cow
[time=2542] or when that horse was branded here's the point the brand said to all who walked by and anyone who
[time=2550] would ever from that day forward look at that cow or see that horse that brand said one thing
[time=2557] it said that cow belongs to him this horse is property of and is owned by him
[time=2566] Paul says to the church at Thessalonica you're a model church because not only have you imitated
[time=2575] Christ but you have become an example there is on you a mark left by a blow that causes others
[time=2584] in your world where you work or where you live to as you walk through your life look at you and
[time=2591] say oh oh he she they belong to to him and it's clear the phrase also means in the Greek easily
[time=2603] recognizable so you ask yourself this morning are you are you in the every day of your life
[time=2612] wherever it is you're going whatever it is you're doing whoever it is you're with as a as a part of the family we are to walk through life not not with obnoxious spirits
[time=2624] not with megaphones broadcasting in a sense but no living in a way whereby it's easily recognizable
[time=2631] who you are and more importantly than who you are who you belong to
[time=2639] a mark left by a blow that said this person these people are mine
[time=2646] these people are mine this church number three amplified Christ amplified Christ
[time=2655] their salvation verse eight see that for the word of the Lord has sounded forth from you not
[time=2661] only in Macedonia and a cave but also in every place your faith toward God has gone forth so that
[time=2667] we the apostles me Paul we have no need to say anything powerful statement this church amplified Christ watch this their salvation their hope the purpose and reason for
[time=2681] living they'd been given when they accepted Christ it meant the world to them it meant absolutely
[time=2687] everything to these people it meant so much their faith and their salvation and what they'd been
[time=2694] given what they had embraced when they embraced Christ their commitment to follow him it meant
[time=2702] so much to them that that you couldn't have paid them here's the point you couldn't have paid them
[time=2709] any amount of money to keep them quiet that phrase in the original language sounded forth
[time=2717] carries with it the idea of a trumpet a trumpet blaring out it sound
[time=2723] and you just got a picture that Paul says you imitated Christ verse six you became an example
[time=2733] to those in your world and as you walked through your world and lived your lives
[time=2740] you sounded forth in appropriate ways like a trumpet the hope that was within you
[time=2749] Romans 10 13 is a good verse to be reminded of you can turn there if you want to or I can read
[time=2758] it to you it says in Romans 10 something you and I need to often be reminded of it says in Romans
[time=2764] 10 13 for whoever listen now for whoever will call upon the name of the Lord will be saved
[time=2770] how then shall they call upon him and whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him
[time=2778] whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher again I told you a few weeks
[time=2786] ago that word in the original language simply means communicator don't look at me I'm looking at you
[time=2794] how will they hear unless you open your mouth and say hey these are tough days we're living
[time=2802] in aren't they yeah you know what for the next three weeks at our church we're going to talk about what's going on in the world today and what God's word has to say by way of an answer and some
[time=2813] direction and some things to think about can you say that can you say that one person can say that
[time=2825] can you say that half of you said yes can you say that what I just said can you all say that
[time=2833] well okay yeah open your mouth so you won't even talk in here
[time=2841] can you say to somebody can you look him in the eye and say hey you know what I love my church
[time=2848] we've got so many great things going on I'd love for you to come and just join me one week pick you up we'll go sit together have some lunch afterwards it'd be great can you say that yeah yeah how are they gonna know
[time=2863] how are they gonna know unless they believe and how can they believe unless they hear and how can
[time=2870] they hear without a communicator all of you interesting here as you read that verse back in 1 Thessalonians 1 in their region think about this
[time=2881] now I don't think this is exaggeration I don't think this is being overstated I think this is how it was I don't think Paul would have said it if it wasn't this way go back to verse 8 for the word
[time=2893] of the Lord has sounded forth from you not only in Macedonia and Akaya but also in every place your faith toward God has gone forth so that we have no need to say anything
[time=2904] these people sounded forth these people were trumpets in their region Paul says they had spoken
[time=2914] up so much there was nothing left to say and what if that were the case here what if that were the
[time=2921] case in north northeastern Indiana what if it what if someday that's how it was what if everywhere
[time=2928] I went what if everywhere we went to try and share the gospel they said oh wait time out it's all right you know because I live by I live by the long breaks we're neighbors with the cadence
[time=2943] I live actually out chair busco you know Dell and Agnes yeah you don't have to say anything to me
[time=2952] because we live by your people what if every time we tried to do what Paul and the apostles were
[time=2959] trying to do we bumped into people who didn't just live by you but who worked with you and I could just go around this room and just name name after name after name and what would it be
[time=2970] like someday to hear people say hey time out save your breath because you know what I've heard it all but better than hearing it all I've seen it because I work with so-and-so and I work with
[time=2982] him and I work with her and man don't forget Ephesians 4 it says that God gave some as pastors
[time=2992] and teachers to equip to equip the saints for the work of the ministry it's you it's all of you
[time=3004] number four this church identified with Christ for they themselves verse nine you see that for
[time=3010] they themselves report about us what kind of a reception we had with you and how you turn to God
[time=3016] from idols to serve a living to serve a living in true God they were as a people prior to this
[time=3025] church at Thessalonica coming together they were as a people moving in this direction and as you study Thessalonian history you realize that this town and these people who later became the church
[time=3036] they were at one time a group of people completely committed to orgies sorcery illicit temple behavior
[time=3043] idol worship and debauched living and then God called that tap on the shoulder thing then God
[time=3050] called initiating the salvation process and they turned Paul says they turned they chose faith
[time=3056] over folly they chose forgiveness over futility they were going in this direction
[time=3063] God calls taps them on the shoulder begins the salvation process and they choose and they turn
[time=3070] and they go the opposite direction 180 degrees which is salvation that's salvation we understand
[time=3082] that yeah that's salvation when you believe and embrace what Jesus did for you and in the believing
[time=3092] and in the embracing you turn he says you turned you turned because you have to no you're missing
[time=3101] the point and probably not saying if that's the mindset it's not because you have to it's because
[time=3107] you what because you want to because you've been saved because you've spiritually been given new
[time=3113] life and all of a sudden you see where you were going and you realize where that was heading and by the grace of God he tapped you remember he begins to draw you and you choose and you go
[time=3124] this way and you go wow new life a second chance because I because I want to
[time=3134] not because I have to what they turn to real quick and we're done real quick they turn to
[time=3140] they turn to God from idols to do what somebody say it out loud serve people
[time=3148] serve give of yourselves give of your time give of your talent give of your treasure
[time=3156] the whole process of repentance there the turning to God was not so that they could sit
[time=3162] or soak or take in or get but so they could roll up their sleeves young old recently convinced
[time=3170] those who have known it for a while and jump in and he says you did that and we lift you up as a
[time=3176] model church because you turned to God and served God involved in the greatest thing going I'll tell
[time=3187] you this church at the end of the day was number five satisfied satisfied with Christ
[time=3195] they were willing to live today listen they were willing to live today with eternity
[time=3201] in view they were not they were not going to sacrifice their futures on the altar of the
[time=3212] immediate and they had ample opportunity just like you do and just like I do and this church said
[time=3221] not gonna happen I will not we will not sacrifice our future and our opportunity to be Christ
[time=3230] followers and have an impact on our world we will not sacrifice that on this puny little altar
[time=3237] called the immediate and you know and I know too many times in these days we get too close
[time=3246] to that little altar and they said you know what not gonna happen I will live and I will think
[time=3255] and I will choose with heaven with heaven in mind and to wait for his son verse 10 they chose to
[time=3265] turn to God from idols and serve a living and true God and to wait for his son hard for many
[time=3271] of us to do and to wait for his son from heaven whom he raised from the dead that is Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come write this down Psalm 27 13 and 14 please write it down everybody
