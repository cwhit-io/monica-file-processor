[time=143] [MUSIC - 4 seconds]
[time=152] - Hi, I'm Kelly, pastor here at Blackhawk, and on behalf of our entire family and all of those on our ministry team, I want you to know how excited we are about what's about to happen here at Blackhawk in the first two weekends of December.
[time=165] It is time for what has become known as the living Christmas tree, and this year is going to be a year like none other because we are celebrating the tree's 25th anniversary.
[time=176] And we've entitled this year's tree a Christmas to remember, and it is promising to be a tree that you'll never forget.
[time=184] I've heard the choir rehearsing and they sound phenomenal.
[time=187] I've seen the drama as it's beginning to unfold, and I promise you, it is going to be a night.
[time=192] It is going to be a concert that you'll never forget.
[time=195] And I just want you to know that the tickets, the public distribution tickets, that's kind of come and gone.
[time=201] Those tickets are out.
[time=203] The family here at Blackhawk has received their tickets, and the only tickets that we've got left at this point, and they're going quick, are the reserve seating tickets that we've put aside for this year.
[time=214] We've tried something new, and we've got a reserve seating section on the floor of the auditorium, and those tickets are on sale here at the church on the south campus for $10.
[time=225] And you can call and get directions as to where they're being sold, but they are going quickly.
[time=230] They'll be around, I would guess, for about maybe one more week.
[time=234] And I just wanted to let you know that you may have some friends at work.
[time=237] There may be some folks on your block.
[time=239] You may have some family members who would enjoy coming.
[time=242] And I just wanted to encourage you to come by, buy a few tickets, share them with some friends.
[time=247] And as you share the tickets with them, remember again, you share a great, great gift, a gift that will enable them to hear and see the true meaning of Christmas, the true message of the gospel.
[time=260] I hope you can come, come by, and get some of those tickets soon.
[time=263] Thanks.
[time=264] - Jan. - Hey.
[time=276] - I thought I wanted to kiss the bride.
[time=279] - Please come in. - I am so glad you're home.
[time=282] - We sure hope you don't mind us dropping in on you like this, Katherine.
[time=285] - Are you kidding, of course not.
[time=287] You know you're welcome here any time.
[time=289] - It's so good to see you. - It's good to see you too.
[time=292] - I can't believe we're here.
[time=293] - Come on in and have a seat.
[time=294] - Thank you.
[time=295] - On the way over, we were trying to figure out how long it's been since we were last together.
[time=299] We figured it had to be about six years because it was right before Cheryl got married that you came out to see us.
[time=305] - That's right.
[time=306] - I remember I was frantic about getting everything done in time for her wedding.
[time=310] - You are.
[time=311] - Oh, then when it was all over, I remember thinking, Katherine probably thought I was a complete basket case.
[time=317] - Oh, I sure wasn't much of a hostess that weekend.
[time=320] - You were a basket.
[time=321] - And that was the last time we were together.
[time=324] - Oh.
[time=326] - So what brings you into the city?
[time=328] Don't tell me you've come in for the corn festival.
[time=331] - No.
[time=332] - It's not like you all don't have enough corn way out where you live in God's country.
[time=335] - Right, no.
[time=337] We didn't exactly come for the festival.
[time=339] We just came from the hospital.
[time=343] - The hospital, oh, I'm sorry.
[time=346] What's wrong?
[time=348] - It's our niece Heather.
[time=349] Well, you remember Jan's sister, Lisa, don't you?
[time=352] - Yes.
[time=352] - Heather's her daughter.
[time=354] She was just transferred here from Mercy Hospital so we came up to see her.
[time=358] She and Lisa weren't a bad accident last Saturday.
[time=363] They got caught in that terrible rain and freezing rain storm we had last Saturday night.
[time=368] I guess the roads got so bad that Lisa lost control.
[time=374] Could a telephone pull, the paramedics believe that Lisa died instantly.
[time=379] - Oh, how awful.
[time=382] I am so sorry.
[time=384] - It's been a terrible tragedy.
[time=387] - How has her husband been doing?
[time=390] - Bob, well, he's at the hospital right now.
[time=392] He's devastated by it all, of course.
[time=395] - Is there anything I can do?
[time=397] - Well, quite frankly, and I don't think there's much anyone can do at this point.
[time=402] I mean, at first, I thought Heather was coming along real well, but now the doctors are saying she may lose a leg.
[time=408] Apparently, some bones were crushed at the time of impact and now some complications have set in.
[time=414] - How are you doing, Jan?
[time=418] - I don't know.
[time=421] I just keep asking myself, why?
[time=426] Why now?
[time=428] Why Lisa?
[time=430] Why do horrible things happen to good people like Lisa?
[time=434] She was always going out of her way to do something nice for someone.
[time=438] The irony of it all is that she and Heather had planned a nice, quiet evening at home, just the girls.
[time=446] Bob had gone out hunting for the weekend and on a whim, they decided to go volunteer down at the community soup kitchen.
[time=453] - That's our Lisa.
[time=454] - That's right.
[time=458] Just, I am so sorry, Jan.
[time=462] You know, I remember Lisa just a little bit, and what I remember about her is that she was always really fun to be with, and going out of her way to do something nice for somebody.
[time=474] I know she'll be miss by a lot of people.
[time=477] I am so sorry, Jan.
[time=478] - You know, even when I asked myself why I can't help
[time=486] it come back to something that you said years ago.
[time=490] - Me?
[time=491] What?
[time=492] What did I say?
[time=493] Do you remember when we first met?
[time=497] We were walking back to the dorm from the Student Union building.
[time=502] We had just checked our mailboxes, and you had just received a letter from your fiance.
[time=508] - Oh yeah, what a day that was.
[time=513] I was crushed.
[time=515] I still can't believe he wrote a letter to break off the engagement.
[time=520] - I never said anything then, but what struck me most about that whole thing was the way you handled it.
[time=526] I mean, I know you were hurting, but you were so calm.
[time=532] Here, your whole future just crumbling right in front of you, and I know, I guess-- - I do remember that day, but I still don't see the connection.
[time=541] I'll never forget it.
[time=546] - All you said was, it'll be okay.
[time=549] God is in control.
[time=551] I thought, man, if it had been me, I'd have been pretty angry, wondering if there even was a God.
[time=557] And if there were, why would he let something like that happen to me?
[time=561] I mean, I'm a good person, it's not fair, I don't just-- - Forgive me, Jan, but Catherine, there's just something I gotta ask you.
[time=568] Do you still believe that?
[time=570] I mean, do you believe that God is always in control?
[time=573] 'Cause we're sure not seeing it.
[time=575] Look at everything that's going on around us in the world today, and especially for us right now, losing Lisa Heather's suffering the way she is.
[time=584] - I understand how you could feel that way, Bill, and I don't have all the answers.
[time=589] But through the years, I have learned that life doesn't go the way I wish it would.
[time=597] Life is hard, and pain is inevitable.
[time=604] Don't get me wrong, there are happy times, but there are lots of difficult ones too.
[time=610] My only hope and comfort is in knowing that God is with me.
[time=616] He never promised us that life would be easy,
[time=622] or fun, or even fair, but he does promise that he will walk with us through whatever our circumstance.
[time=635] As I sit here and listen to you now, I can tell it really is more than just a cliche for you.
[time=643] You really do trust in God.
[time=647] How is that?
[time=650] How can you put that kind of confidence in a God you can't see?
[time=655] Wait, to hear you talk, it's as if you know him like a personal friend.
[time=664] "Can that be?" [MUSIC - 294 seconds]
[time=964] For being that kind of a God.
[time=966] [MUSIC - 9 seconds]
[time=983] Father, we thank You this morning.
[time=986] Those of us here in this room that know You and have the privilege and the joy of walking through life with You.
[time=994] We know what it's like to experience Your greatness.
[time=997] We know what it's like to sense Your gentle touch as well.
[time=1002] And we would also pray, Father, for those here this morning, who as they sit and have listened and taken in this time together even so far,
[time=1011] they realize they are without.
[time=1014] The touch, the presence, the relationship with the God, comes alongside, brings peace and forgiveness and comfort.
[time=1023] And so, God, we pray that whether we're here this morning knowing You, walking through life with You and thanking You for Your greatness and Your smallness or whether God were here, still searching, wondering what it would be like to really have hope.
[time=1038] God, we pray that Your Spirit would move.
[time=1041] We pray that Your Word would do what it always does.
[time=1044] It looks into our hearts and it gives direction, brings conviction.
[time=1048] And so, God teaches, mold us, shape us because of our time together this morning in Your Son's name we pray.
[time=1055] [AMEN] Well, in times like these has been kind of our theme over these last few weeks,
[time=1064] as our world and as our nation, as our country and as those of us who live in it
[time=1070] have faced so many different challenges and obstacles in the recent eight weeks or so.
[time=1075] But we have decided to ask that question.
[time=1078] In times like these, we need an answer like this and we've been trying to ask the questions
[time=1084] that so many of you and myself have been asking, trying to ask the questions that this world today is asking as they live in the midst of and watch unfold before their eyes, events that can confuse the mind and stir the heart.
[time=1097] And so, we began a few weeks ago and we asked the question, the commonly asked questions.
[time=1102] The questions that you hear everywhere you go, why do bad things happen?
[time=1106] As the drama this morning so powerfully illustrated, you know,
[time=1112] that scene has been played out in your life, that scene has in some ways or another been played out in mind, that scene and that question gets asked again and again and again.
[time=1121] Why do horrible, painful, tragic things happen to good people?
[time=1129] And we looked to God's words just a couple of Sundays ago and we realized that there's an answer to that question.
[time=1135] And the answer is, the reason bad things happen is that a loving God,
[time=1141] at the beginning of this whole thing, back in Genesis, a loving God, gave man a thing called free will.
[time=1150] He gave us choice.
[time=1152] And in his love he gave us choice and in our choice we chose sin.
[time=1160] And when that first choice was made there in Genesis 3, when she took that fruit and she gave it to him and they both ate,
[time=1168] what got introduced onto the scene of humanity was a thing called sin, a thing called evil and ever since then sin and evil have continued to run rampant.
[time=1181] Why do bad things happen? Well, God's word teaches us because of evil.
[time=1186] Some asked where was God? Where was God September 11th?
[time=1190] Where was God when this happened in my life?
[time=1192] Where was God when that happened in yours? The where was God question?
[time=1196] And we looked again to God's word and we saw there that God was on September 11th and God has been in your life and mind through the years.
[time=1205] He's the same place. He always has been the same place he is today and it's the same place he'll be tomorrow.
[time=1211] God is. God's word teaches everywhere.
[time=1215] He is an omnipresent God. He is everywhere all the time. Nothing hidden from his sight.
[time=1221] Nothing out of his view. No mistakes.
[time=1226] God is everywhere. He was in the towers. He was on the plains. He was in the Pentagon.
[time=1231] He was there. And the third question we asked was does he care?
[time=1236] Does he care? Again, God's word. As we looked through its pages,
[time=1242] communicated to us and it taught us and reminded us all over again that all he cares.
[time=1247] He cares a great deal. In fact, you know what? He cared so much.
[time=1252] And we kind of made the analogy here. If you remember, we talked about being parents and how really though sometimes it's painful, the loving thing to do with kids is to give them a choice.
[time=1260] That's real love. And God and his great love gave us a choice and we chose sin.
[time=1268] Does he care? Absolutely. We chose sin and so then he comes back, us having chose sin.
[time=1275] Sin and evil running rampant through humanity. He comes back and says, "You know what? I got a plan.
[time=1280] I'm going to give you an opportunity again to live in relationship with me, to have sins forgiven, to have hope restored." And that's going to come through the person of Jesus Christ,
[time=1292] my only son. And he gave him up. Sacrificed his own son, John 3, 16, so that you and I could have life.
[time=1302] And so if he's everywhere all the time, always present, and he cares enough about me personally,
[time=1309] to have sacrificed and given his own son. And since his son, God's word teaches.
[time=1316] And since his son, our Lord Jesus Christ, since he defeated death and rose from the grave on the third day
[time=1322] and has gone, he said, to prepare a place for those who have trusted him, for those who have turned from their self-reliance
[time=1329] and given themselves completely and thoroughly to him, since he has gone to prepare a place for those
[time=1336] who love him and trust him, and have given him their lives and their faith, since all of that is true.
[time=1344] Why? Why are we still so afraid?
[time=1351] Why are we still so afraid? We talked about that last week, and it leads us to where I want to go this morning.
[time=1357] Why are some so afraid while Don Frakasi, last week?
[time=1362] Were you here last week? Last week you saw in the video, a guy named Don Frakasi.
[time=1367] Why are some so afraid while the Don Frakasi's of this world in the midst of facing terminal cancer,
[time=1374] the loss of life, losing life in a future with his wife and four boys?
[time=1379] How is it that some are so afraid while Don Frakasi was able to say, I've got cancer of the body, not the soul?
[time=1386] I'll be all right. It'll be okay.
[time=1393] Why are some so afraid while first-century history records in great detail the courage and calm of Christians
[time=1400] walking willingly to their deaths? There's a first-century church historian named Tertullian,
[time=1406] and Tertullian writes this of first-century Christians as they were marched to the Colosseum in Rome.
[time=1412] Tertullian writes, "They walked toward torment and death with a look, not of fear, but instead a look of anticipation."
[time=1422] First-century Christians on their way to being martyred in the Colosseum with lions and beasts.
[time=1428] And Tertullian says they walk with a look of anticipation.
[time=1432] He goes on to say, "It was a look of anticipation as if they saw something beyond the lions and the pain."
[time=1441] And they did. Didn't they? They did.
[time=1447] Why are some so afraid while pastors today?
[time=1452] Pastors in a place called Chechnya, in the former Soviet Union. Why are some so afraid in life?
[time=1461] While pastors today in a place called Chechnya enthusiastically and willingly, week after week,
[time=1469] stand behind their handmade pulpits in small wooden buildings and proclaim the truth, knowing, knowing that just this past year,
[time=1481] anywhere from ten to a dozen of them, pastors in Chechnya have been kidnapped, taken from their homes,
[time=1489] yanked off the streets.
[time=1493] How is it that some stand behind pulpits knowing that they could be next?
[time=1497] Many of those pastors taken from what we're hearing are sent to work camps in Siberia never to see their families.
[time=1503] Again, some are murdered. Body parts sent back to their families in the mail saying stop.
[time=1511] Stop proclaiming the truth. Stop pastoring. And yet week after week, young men stand behind pulpits.
[time=1519] Concourage and proclaim the truth.
[time=1523] Why? Why do so many panic, cower and tremble in the face of fear while some courageously face it?
[time=1535] How is that? Some of you here in this room this morning today
[time=1543] and maybe it's in light of what our world faces, maybe it's in light of what you're facing.
[time=1549] It may have to do with bin Laden and it may have to do with anthrax or you know what it may.
[time=1555] It may have to do with a test result that came back.
[time=1558] It may have to do with a family member who's wandering.
[time=1561] It may have to do with a very personal situation. It may have to do with a lot of things, but there probably are some here in this room this morning and you're petrified.
[time=1572] You're scared to death. You have this anxiousness about the unknown that awaits you tomorrow or next week.
[time=1582] And it's got your soul and your heart shrinking by the minute. Scared, uncertain.
[time=1591] Why are some so afraid while others face fear courageously?
[time=1597] You know why? There's an answer. There's one answer.
[time=1605] Some face fear courageously. They don't cower, tremble in the face of it.
[time=1611] Some face fear courageously because they have a thing called hope.
[time=1618] Some have hope. Some understand hope. Some have really truly embraced hope.
[time=1626] There are those in your world and mind who courageously face fear because they have a thing called hope.
[time=1632] And you know what? There are so many in the world today.
[time=1636] There's only some in this room this morning that don't.
[time=1641] Some haven't and so many today don't. Can we talk about hope this morning?
[time=1646] Would that be all right? Can we look to God's word and talk about and consider and wrestle with this thing called hope?
[time=1651] Do you have hope? Do you have hope? Do you really have hope?
[time=1656] Or do you face life today, hope less? And if you do have hope, if you nod your head yes and you say you know what I got hope, Kelly? I'm hopeful today.
[time=1665] I've embraced hope. What or who have you placed your hope in?
[time=1669] Let me just ask you that. Think about it. Consider that. What or who?
[time=1674] Have you placed your hope in? And as we ask that question, I think it demands that we would first define hope, okay?
[time=1681] So let's do that. You got your pencils? You got a pen? Write this down. Hope defined. What is it?
[time=1686] God's word teaches us that hope is a deep confidence in a future event, a deep confidence in a future event.
[time=1695] Hope is the belief that good will come, that good will come, that I like how this is worded, that satisfaction will be realized.
[time=1706] Hope is a deep confidence in a future event, the belief that good will come, that satisfaction will be realized.
[time=1714] Now, why do so many today?
[time=1718] Why do so many live without it? Why do so many live without hope? Why are so many in your world and mind, even here in this room?
[time=1727] Why are so many, not truly, really satisfied?
[time=1733] In many cases, you know why? In many cases, I believe it's because they have bought the lie.
[time=1742] Actually, I should say that differently. It's not the lie, it's the lies.
[time=1747] There are so many in this world, and there are probably some in this room.
[time=1751] And you know what? I was one of them.
[time=1753] Until the age of about 2021, I was one who had absolutely and thoroughly and completely at the heart level bought the lies.
[time=1762] Because there are some lies out there. There are some trains of thought. There are some schools of thinking.
[time=1768] There are some approaches to life that sell some really, really attractive lies when it comes to this thing of acquiring or experiencing hope, satisfaction, and the good that we seek and long for.
[time=1781] I used to believe wholeheartedly and deeply that you could place your hope in a number of different things.
[time=1788] I wanted a confidence in the future. I wanted good to come. I wanted to realize true satisfaction.
[time=1793] So I and many others today place their hope in a number of things.
[time=1797] Let's just remind ourselves this morning of three. Okay?
[time=1802] Sometimes people begin to believe, and you know what?
[time=1805] Oftentimes, this happens, kids. I know we got some kids in here.
[time=1809] And this is not meant to be a negative thing. It's just a true thing.
[time=1812] So listen to me and hear me out, kids. All right?
[time=1815] So many times, even at a very young age, we begin to think that we can place our hope in people.
[time=1825] Write that down. Sometimes we buy the lie that we can actually place our hope in people.
[time=1832] Now, that's not to say that there aren't people in our lives who aren't, who aren't good people, who do care for us, who do love us and treat us as such.
[time=1841] And the fact of the matter is, gang, that as you go through life and as I went through life, I realized that people are people. People are human and people let you, what?
[time=1849] Down. My dad, many of you know that story.
[time=1854] I realized at a pretty young age that I had placed my hope in a guy who was a great guy with all these gifts and talents who stood for this and said that.
[time=1863] And I watched him do that my whole life and thought, "Oh my goodness." But there's somebody I can place my hope in. There's somebody who will bring to my life the good and the satisfaction that I long for.
[time=1873] And he left. He left.
[time=1878] My heart and my dreams and my hopes were shattered. I had placed my hope in my father.
[time=1888] Then sometimes, here's what's happened to me. And I've seen it happen so many times with others.
[time=1894] Sometimes we grow up young thinking we can place our hope in key adults.
[time=1899] And then that kind of goes south. So then we get to be about, I don't know, 18, 19, 20 and we think, "You know what? I got it."
[time=1907] I figured it out. I can place my hope. I can get what? I can get married. There you go. That's it.
[time=1917] All my troubles, all my sorrows, all my broken dreams. I'm going to get married.
[time=1924] And I'm going to walk down the aisle. I'm going to find somebody who loves me and someone who I can love.
[time=1929] And we're going to get married. And in that marriage and in that union, oh thank goodness.
[time=1934] Satisfaction will be realized. Good will come.
[time=1940] And you know what? It does. Oh it does. Marriage is a wonderful thing.
[time=1948] Marriage is a wonderful thing. Hear me. But you're married a human.
[time=1955] And humans always let you what? Down. And three weeks into it or three months into it or three years into it.
[time=1963] I heard somebody say this week, opposites attract and in ten years they attack.
[time=1971] You get married and you think it's going to be the deal and you realize three weeks, three months, three years into it, it's not the deal.
[time=1979] It's a good thing. It's a chance for you to love. It's a chance for you to give.
[time=1984] It's an opportunity for you to sacrifice. But it is not the end all.
[time=1989] So you say, well that didn't work. My dad let me down. My mom likes key adults.
[time=1995] I can't put my hope in them really. And marriage isn't really going to do it either so, so, so.
[time=2001] I got it. We'll have kids. Lots of kids.
[time=2006] We'll just have kid after kid after and there's in their little eyes and in their little hearts and in all the joy that they bring.
[time=2014] It'll be kids that kind of bring to our lives that sense of satisfaction.
[time=2019] And sometimes it doesn't work right away. So some couples just have more and more and more.
[time=2025] And they keep looking for hope.
[time=2034] There was a lady.
[time=2038] I don't know what it is about or maybe it's that I just identify with a heart that longs for something that's real true.
[time=2048] There's a lady. I've always loved the story. John chapter 4. Look there real quick.
[time=2054] I want to just show you this. Look at John 4.
[time=2058] So many times we, you and I place our hope in people.
[time=2065] Jesus met a lady. And John 4, a Samaritan woman. Jews and Samaritans weren't supposed to speak.
[time=2073] They were at odds with each other. But as always, Jesus crossed over the boundaries of culture and bias.
[time=2079] And he enters into and engages in a wonderful conversation.
[time=2083] Jesus said to her, if you knew the gift, verse 10.
[time=2086] Jesus answered and said to her, if you knew the gift of God and who it was, who says to you, give me a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water.
[time=2095] Jesus is trying to reach out to the seeking, searching woman.
[time=2102] He would have given you living water. She said to him, sir, there at a well.
[time=2107] There at a watering hole there and she looks at him and she says, sir, you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep.
[time=2114] Where then do you get that living water?
[time=2117] You are not greater than our father, Jacob, are you who gave us the well and drank of it himself and his sons and his cattle.
[time=2124] Jesus answered and said to her, everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again.
[time=2131] No hope, no satisfaction, no good will come.
[time=2136] But verse 14, whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst.
[time=2142] But the water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.
[time=2149] And the woman who makes this trip to the well day after day after day, multiple times a day, the woman said to him, sir, give me this water.
[time=2158] So I will not be thirsty nor come all the way here to draw and he said to her, go.
[time=2165] Here he goes, doing what Jesus always did, he exposes her, exposes her thirst, he exposes her hunger, he exposes her hopelessness.
[time=2174] He says, go call your husband and come here.
[time=2179] The woman answered and said, I have no husband.
[time=2184] Jesus said to her, you have well said, I have no husband, for you have had five.
[time=2195] You see that?
[time=2198] Can you identify with her at all?
[time=2200] I hope you can.
[time=2201] And I don't care how many times you've been married, it's not the point.
[time=2207] Do you understand how thirsty a soul is? Do you understand that kind of hunger for something that's going to fulfill, something that's going to last?
[time=2216] That drives you and drives me and drives her to wells that don't quench broken cisterns.
[time=2223] You have had five poor woman, so hungry, so in need, so longing for something that would quench her thirst physically and personally.
[time=2240] And the one whom you now have, number six, is not your husband.
[time=2245] This you have said truly, and the woman said to him, sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.
[time=2254] You can't put your hope in people.
[time=2257] Okay, it's not going to work.
[time=2259] Never has.
[time=2261] Never will.
[time=2263] Some move on from people, some think it's the right profession.
[time=2267] Write that one down.
[time=2268] Some think hope can be realized.
[time=2270] True satisfaction and good will come in the right profession.
[time=2274] The realization of one's full, professional, and monetary potential.
[time=2279] And whether it's the personal fulfillment from the job or the personal profit from the job.
[time=2285] We actually begin to think that the right job, the right challenge, the right opportunities and the right amount of cash and achievement will bring that satisfaction realized.
[time=2297] We put our hope in it.
[time=2298] It happens all the time.
[time=2302] And I don't care how much you make or how little.
[time=2305] This is not really a case of, you know, amounts.
[time=2308] It's just, it's the drive.
[time=2310] It's the movement toward.
[time=2312] It's the thinking that somehow in my achievement, personally or monetarily, somehow and what I can acquire or own or make.
[time=2322] We put our hope in it believing that it will bring that future good.
[time=2331] And then the same thing happens that always happens.
[time=2333] I don't care who you are.
[time=2335] I don't care what your experience has been in some way or another.
[time=2339] It all begins to look like this.
[time=2341] We do the job.
[time=2343] You do yours and I do mine.
[time=2346] And for five, ten, fifteen years, we do the job.
[time=2352] And fifteen years down the road, you know what?
[time=2354] We're as driven and hungry, driven and hungry, which don't forget.
[time=2360] Those are just catch phrases today.
[time=2363] There's synonymous catch phrases for the word empty.
[time=2368] We're as driven, we're as hungry, we are as empty.
[time=2374] Ten, fifteen years down the road, as we were the day we started, bonuses don't really get it done.
[time=2380] Advancement leads to more pressure and hunger.
[time=2382] Wealth and luxury tend to isolate and separate.
[time=2389] And then as always, Jesus comes along and gives you some things to think about.
[time=2395] Gives me some things to think about.
[time=2397] Matthew, chapter 16, first book of the New Testament there.
[time=2401] Matthew, Mark, Luke, go to Matthew 16.
[time=2405] Because Jesus, as he always did, had something to say to those caught in this lie.
[time=2412] Gonna find hope in the right profession. Gonna find hope in achievement.
[time=2419] Jesus says in Matthew 16, 26, he, speaking to his disciples.
[time=2430] And actually I'll back up a verse and it says in 25, "For whoever wishes to save his life shall lose it, but whoever loses his life from my sake shall find it."
[time=2438] Here you go, 26, "For what will a man be profited?"
[time=2444] He says, "If he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul."
[time=2452] Powerful, penetrating question.
[time=2455] But I like the second one even better.
[time=2458] He goes on to say, "Or what will a man give?" He just kind of cuts to the chase, "Or what will a man give?" "In exchange for his soul, what will a man give in exchange for his soul?"
[time=2475] "What will it profit a man for you to gain and have it all and yet lose your soul?"
[time=2482] Maybe we would ask the question like this in our day.
[time=2487] Maybe you need to be asked and I need to be asked.
[time=2490] Maybe all of us need to be asked again and again.
[time=2493] We'll say it this way. What toy?
[time=2496] What toy do you have?
[time=2499] What toy do you have? What possession? What acquisition?
[time=2503] What amount in the net worth column is worth going to hell for?
[time=2509] I'll just say it clearly and simply.
[time=2514] What amount?
[time=2516] And then that next question he asks, "Boy, it's just penetrating."
[time=2523] "What will you, at the end there, what will a man give in exchange for his soul?"
[time=2531] What are you going to hold on to?
[time=2533] Polish up and say, "Look what I have. Look what I got." Finally, what is that thing going to be that's worth you or I spending eternity apart from him?
[time=2547] Because you bought the lie and thought somehow there was hope.
[time=2552] You can't place hope in people.
[time=2554] You can't place hope in a job or that which a job brings.
[time=2558] And so sometimes we get desperate and discouraged.
[time=2563] Don't you?
[time=2565] You realize it in people and it's not profession.
[time=2568] And sometimes you just get absolutely desperate.
[time=2571] And you begin to think, "You know what? I think I'll just try a little compromise."
[time=2579] There's where it is.
[time=2582] Because I've got to give me some. I've got to give me some satisfaction.
[time=2586] I've got to somehow feel that sense of fullness.
[time=2589] My heart aches. There's this void.
[time=2592] And so it's not people and it's not profession.
[time=2595] So we begin to think, we listen to the whisper of the enemy and we begin to think, "You know what? Maybe I'll just try a little compromise." And that compromise looks different.
[time=2606] Takes different shapes and forms. Sometimes it's moral.
[time=2609] Sometimes it's moral compromise.
[time=2612] Sometimes we begin to actually believe that there's some satisfaction to be realized
[time=2619] in the midst of moral, personal, illicit, sexual.
[time=2626] Jesus in the New Testament used the word "pornaya" to describe that kind of activity that moves us outside the realm of God's will for us morally, physically.
[time=2642] Some of you, some of us, myself included, have heard those whispers.
[time=2649] And sometimes it's not whispered. Sometimes it's just yelled, right in our face.
[time=2655] Satisfaction. Here. Come and get it.
[time=2657] And I want to remind you what God's word says. Look at Proverbs.
[time=2661] Look at Proverbs 5.
[time=2663] Thinking about a little moral compromise to bring some good.
[time=2667] Thinking about some moral compromise to bring some level of satisfaction realized.
[time=2672] Think you can put your hope in a little bit of that.
[time=2676] Look at Proverbs 5. Pick it up in verse 1.
[time=2679] "My son, my son," he says, "give attention to my wisdom and climb your ear to my understanding that you may observe discretion and your lips may reserve knowledge for the lips of an adulterous."
[time=2693] And again, male or female here, really, all right.
[time=2696] In the context here it talks about the woman, but understand that goes both ways.
[time=2701] "For the lips of an adulterous," he says, "drip honey and smoother than oil is her speech, but in the end she is bitter as warm wood, sharp as a two-edged sword.
[time=2713] Her feet go down to death. Her steps lay hold of shield.
[time=2717] She does not ponder the path of life. Her ways are unstable.
[time=2721] And she does not know it. Now then my sons listen to me.
[time=2724] And do not depart from the words of my mouth.
[time=2727] Keep your way far from her.
[time=2730] And do not go near the door of her house, lest you give your vigor to others and your years to the cruel one, lest strangers be filled with your strength, and your hard-earned goods go to the house of another,
[time=2745] to the house of an alien," he says.
[time=2750] And you, you've grown. You do that.
[time=2754] You're going to get some satisfaction and hope there, and you do that and you've grown at your latter end when your flesh and your body are consumed, and you say how I have hated instruction, and my heart spurned reproof, and I have not listened to the voice of my teachers, nor inclined my ear to my instructors.
[time=2776] Look at verse 20, "For why should you, my son, be exhilarated with an adulterous and embrace the bosom of a foreigner, for the ways of a man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he watches all his paths.
[time=2789] His own iniquities will capture the wicked, and he will be held with the cords of his sin.
[time=2794] He will die for lack of instruction, and in the greatness of his folly, he will go astray."
[time=2804] You're going to get some life there, are you?
[time=2806] No. You're going to get death.
[time=2809] You're going to get ruin. You're going to get pain.
[time=2812] So some say, "Okay, no moral compromise." You know what I'll just kind of get satisfied and experience the future good, because I'll just kind of live a life that's just about that.
[time=2824] I'll just kind of sit in my chair, sit on my couch.
[time=2828] Some would call it laziness.
[time=2830] God's word in Proverbs 6 talks about the slugger.
[time=2834] Some think that in the compromise of personal responsibility, they can somehow just kind of eke out and stretch out and grind out of life some sense of satisfaction, but God says no. Proverbs 6, pick it up in verse 6.
[time=2846] Go to the ant, oh, sluggered. He says, "Go to the ant." You lazy one, oh, sluggered.
[time=2852] Observe her ways and be wise, which having no chief, officer or ruler, prepares her food in the summer and gathers her provision in the harvest.
[time=2861] How long will you lie down, oh, sluggered?
[time=2865] When will you arise from your sleep?
[time=2868] A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest and your poverty?
[time=2875] Your satisfaction? You are good?
[time=2878] No. Your poverty will come in like a vagabond and your need like an arm man.
[time=2886] Many today realize moral compromise isn't going to get it done.
[time=2891] Personal responsibility, you got to stay at that.
[time=2894] So some in their desperateness, go to a third category of compromise.
[time=2898] And you know some and I know many.
[time=2901] And I've had too many conversations with them.
[time=2905] They begin to think, there are some.
[time=2907] And you know what? Sometimes they're young, sometimes they're students, sometimes they're middle schoolers, high schoolers, college age, sometimes they're grown adults who have seen a lot of life.
[time=2917] But there are some who get to this point of absolute desperateness for something that will fill them.
[time=2922] And they begin to think that they'll explore and investigate other religious options.
[time=2929] Some begin to tire of accountability and obedience or trust and venture out to the other ways to God.
[time=2938] But certainly, that's what the lie says.
[time=2941] The lie says that certainly must be out there.
[time=2945] And so off they go on their search.
[time=2948] And Jesus said in John 14, 6, "I am the way.
[time=2956] The truth and the life, no one." Nobody, he says, comes to the Father.
[time=2962] "But through Me."
[time=2969] Colossians, you can turn there.
[time=2972] Look at Colossians 2.
[time=2974] Flip back there.
[time=2975] Keep going back towards the end of your New Testament.
[time=2979] Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians.
[time=2983] Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth and the life." Jesus said in that verse in John 14, 6, you know what?
[time=2990] There aren't any other options.
[time=2992] It's Me.
[time=2993] And because He was who He was and because He did what He did and because He accomplished what He accomplished.
[time=2998] Because He came, lived, died, and defeated death.
[time=3001] He stands before You and Me with the ability and the power because of who He is and the right and the authority to say that.
[time=3008] And He says it.
[time=3009] But folks at Colossae, we're starting to struggle with this very same thing.
[time=3013] And Paul says to them, in Colossians 2, verse 9, actually back it up to 6, if you would.
[time=3021] Colossians 2, 6, "As You therefore," He says to these folks, "who had come to Christ, He knew that." He says, "As You therefore have received Christ Jesus, the Lord, so walk in Him, having been firmly rooted and now being built up in Him and established in Your faith, just as You were instructed and overflowing with gratitude." See to it, verse 8, "But no one takes You captive, and it is a prison." Let me tell you that.
[time=3046] False philosophy, false teaching, and this mindset that says to You
[time=3054] come and explore and see other options to Him, options that will let You live the way You want to live and still get there.
[time=3065] And we buy in and it is an absolute prison.
[time=3068] See to it that no one takes You captive through philosophy and empty deception according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary principles of the world, rather than according to Christ.
[time=3079] For in Him the fullness of deity dwells in bodily form.
[time=3085] What I learned on my own journey and what a journey it was,
[time=3092] it was a journey that ended up being a very painful, empty search.
[time=3098] It was a journey full of regret and heartache and hopelessness.
[time=3103] And what I learned was that satisfaction was realized.
[time=3108] Listen now, here's the point and we'll end with this.
[time=3113] What I learned and what many in this room have learned, and what some may be here in the room this morning.
[time=3119] Maybe you're ready to learn this and embrace this and see this.
[time=3124] Is that hope, that future good that you long for,
[time=3130] that satisfaction realized.
[time=3133] What I learned on my journey is that hope is realized.
[time=3138] It is embraced where it began.
[time=3144] Write that down, where it began.
[time=3148] And here's what I mean by that.
[time=3150] Please just remember for a moment where all this began.
[time=3153] All this began in a place called the garden, with two people named Adam and Eve, real people.
[time=3160] It really happened.
[time=3162] And Adam and Eve, before the serpent and before the fruit, before the fall, before the entrance of sin, Adam and Eve lived.
[time=3168] Remember, an absolute perfect relationship with God.
[time=3173] Their relationship with Him was unbroken and unblemished.
[time=3177] Their relationship with each other was perfect.
[time=3180] Hope was realized.
[time=3183] Satisfaction existed.
[time=3186] Unadulterated peace and hope right there in this incredible relationship
[time=3193] with the living God.
[time=3195] It was how you and I were designed to live.
[time=3201] And they make that choice.
[time=3203] And sin enters in.
[time=3205] And evil now exists.
[time=3208] And what happened there was this perfect relationship gets severed, it gets tainted.
[time=3213] And it's been tainted ever since.
[time=3216] And hope for you in times like this.
[time=3220] Hope for me in times like this is realized.
[time=3225] And it's only realized when you're willing, and when I'm willing to come back to where it began, and where it began was in relationship with Him.
[time=3236] In relationship with Him.
[time=3240] For God so loved the world that He gave His Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish,
[time=3249] but have everlasting life.
[time=3252] So many today are afraid because they have no hope.
[time=3256] And hope is realized.
[time=3258] Satisfaction comes one place in the person of Christ when you're willing, and I'm willing, to go back to where it began in relationship with Him.
[time=3269] And that is my hope, and that is our prayer.
[time=3271] And you know what?
[time=3272] I want to give you a chance right here just to think that through.
[time=3275] So I'm going to invite you to stand if you would, just quietly.
[time=3283] And I'll just invite you, if you would, to just stay where you're at there, bow your heads, close your eyes.
[time=3287] And let me just give you a couple of things to think about, and we'll go.
[time=3293] Your heads bowed and your eyes closed just in the quietness of your own heart.
[time=3297] I just want to say this to you.
[time=3299] I believe with all my heart.
[time=3301] I told you what I used to believe.
[time=3303] I told you a little bit of the journey I used to be on.
[time=3307] And it was in the person of Christ.
[time=3309] It was in relationship with Him, and a living God, that hope was realized.
[time=3316] Hope for today, hope for purpose and meaning, forgiveness, and a chance to serve a living God.
[time=3323] But you know what?
[time=3324] Hope also for eternity.
[time=3326] It was realized in Him, because I believe Him when He says He's gone to prepare a place.
[time=3331] And this morning, if in your heart there is that strong clear sense that though you're an American, and though you live in the Midwest, and though you fly a flag, things so many times kind of associated with being a Christian.
[time=3349] Maybe this morning you're realizing or you've been realizing that Christianity isn't about where you live.
[time=3355] Christianity is about the state of your heart.
[time=3358] Do you know the Lord?
[time=3360] Are you His?
[time=3362] In times like these people you need Him.
[time=3364] You can't need Him and you need His truth.
[time=3366] And so if that's something that you would be longing for today, I'm just going to invite you to pray this simple prayer.
[time=3372] I'm going to invite you to say these words quietly, just in your own heart.
[time=3376] God's word says that if you say these words and you mean them, Romans 10, if you confess with your mouth and believe in your heart, that He was raised from the dead.
[time=3388] Jesus, as Lord, it says you will be saved.
[time=3390] So just say this, pray this to Him from your heart.
[time=3393] Oh God, oh God in heaven, I realize.
[time=3397] I realize that my sin, my humanness, separates me from you.
[time=3405] And in that separation, God, I realize there's nothing I can do about it.
[time=3413] My goodness, my efforts, my money, none of it.
[time=3418] My church attendance, none of it.
[time=3421] It gets me to you.
[time=3423] Oh God, thank you for the gift and the sacrifice of your Son.
[time=3428] Thank you for His broken body and His spilled blood on my behalf.
[time=3436] And Father today, right here, I recognize that.
[time=3439] I accept that gift.
[time=3442] I put my arms and my heart around it.
[time=3446] I believe that He did that, that He did it for me, and that in His death and resurrection, in His death, no one else's, in His effort, no one else's.
[time=3460] I realize that in that I have life and forgiveness of sin.
[time=3465] And that allows me to have a relationship with you.
[time=3468] Oh God, thank you.
[time=3469] Thank you for saving me.
[time=3471] Thank you for calling me to yourself.
[time=3474] And God now give me the strength to learn to live, to learn to know what it means to follow you.
[time=3483] Thank you for your gift and your Son's name I pray.
[time=3488] And Father, the rest of us here in this room that know you need to be reminded of where hope really is.
[time=3494] We can wander and we can stray.
[time=3496] And so God continue pleased to give us guidance and lead us down paths that are true and right and give us the courage to follow.
[time=3504] We'll look forward, many of us, to coming back together again tonight to celebrate what you've done and who you are.
[time=3511] And all the people agreed and said, amen.
[time=3541] [MUSIC]
