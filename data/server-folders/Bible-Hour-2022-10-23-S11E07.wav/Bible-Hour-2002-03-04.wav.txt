[time=77] [MUSIC - 37 seconds]
[time=119] - We're gonna try something a little bit different.
[time=126] We're gonna sing a song.
[time=128] It's a gift to God today.
[time=129] We're gonna turn off the PowerPoint.
[time=133] We're gonna sing without words so that you can close your eyes if you want and just sing it to God.
[time=140] And it's easy, it's just as Father I adore you and I lay my life before you.
[time=145] That's it, that's pretty much the words, how I love you.
[time=151] And I wanna challenge you, if you know him today, if you know he knows your name today, then sing that with all you have to him.
[time=159] And we're not gonna get tied up in a looking at screens or just or anything, just forget everybody around you and just sing it right to him, okay?
[time=170] [MUSIC - 53 seconds]
[time=228] - Hey guys, we're gonna sing first this time and ladies are gonna follow, okay?
[time=234] Sing it out to the Lord.
[time=236] [MUSIC - 56 seconds]
[time=302] - Okay, this time, sing to the Father.
[time=305] If you wanna sing Father, I adore you, then you sing that.
[time=309] If you wanna see Jesus, I adore you, sing that, okay?
[time=312] If you wanna sing Spirit, I adore you.
[time=314] You sing that.
[time=315] Sing whichever one is on your heart.
[time=317] Sing it right to him a couple of times.
[time=319] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=354] - Okay, this time, just our voice.
[time=361] Father, I adore you.
[time=362] [MUSIC - 34 seconds]
[time=402] (gentle piano music)
[time=421] [MUSIC - 195 seconds]
[time=619] (audience applauding)
[time=639] - Hi, I'm Kelly, pastor here at Blackhawk.
[time=641] And in a couple of weeks, we come to what is a very, very big day in the life of our church and in the life of, I know many of you.
[time=650] On March 31st, we will celebrate in a big way, the day we call Easter, one of the greatest celebrations of all.
[time=658] And I wanna just, I guess, remind you today and invite you to come in and maybe be a part of that celebration with us.
[time=664] We'd love to have you.
[time=666] And I wanna just make sure that we're understanding what the big deal is about Easter.
[time=671] What's the big deal?
[time=672] What's so important, what is so significant about Easter?
[time=676] Well, what's so important is the resurrection.
[time=680] That's right, the resurrection, the fact that Jesus was tortured, he was murdered, he was crucified, he was hung on a cross, taken off the cross, put into a tomb, and three days later, he wasn't there.
[time=695] And he said he wouldn't be there.
[time=697] He predicted that that's what would happen, that he would defeat death for you and for me.
[time=703] And that brings to those of us that know him today, a great sense of hope and a great sense of gratitude.
[time=710] And so we want you to come and be a part of that service with us.
[time=713] Easter Sunday this year, we'll have two services at nine and at 10.30.
[time=718] And we'd love for you to come.
[time=719] It's a big, big deal.
[time=721] When you think about all that has gone on in human history, when you think about the other religions of the world, Joseph Smith, Confucius, the great Muhammad, the Dalai Lama, I mean, no matter where you go, those who have been supposed religious leaders, their tombs, their tombs are occupied today, full of bones.
[time=744] Our Lord's tomb is empty and that's significant.
[time=747] And we wanna celebrate that truth.
[time=749] And we wanna look at the facts behind the resurrection.
[time=753] That's what we'll give our time to that morning, the facts of the resurrection.
[time=757] We're entitling our celebration, the truth will come out.
[time=762] And he did, and we wanna invite you to join us for that.
[time=765] Friday, before Easter, you could even join us for a good Friday celebration at 1215, 1215 to 1245.
[time=772] And then come back Easter Sunday morning and join us for a great morning of worship and a time in God's word looking at the facts, the truth, the evidence behind the greatest event of all time, the resurrection of our Lord.
[time=787] We hope to see you then.
[time=788] - For those of you visiting Black Hawk, I am Kelly Bird.
[time=792] (audience laughing) I've always wanted to say that.
[time=796] Actually, I'm Mitchell Cruz, and I'm gonna be sharing with you today.
[time=802] And we have a drama that sorta lets you in on the window of my life.
[time=806] Haya was a business owner with my dad, and I have only one sibling, and he's seven years younger than I am.
[time=813] And my dad wanted to make a way for him to have an opportunity to own part of our business.
[time=819] And I gotta be honest with you, I didn't want it to happen.
[time=822] So, watch this drama and see if you feel what I felt.
[time=826] - Hey dad, I got your memo.
[time=828] What's up with this?
[time=829] I got a truck loading right now.
[time=831] If I don't get this thing out of here by noon, I'm gonna have the phone ringing up.
[time=834] - Sit down a minute, Chris.
[time=836] - What?
[time=837] - Please, just sit down.
[time=838] Your brother's back.
[time=843] Andy, Andy's back here.
[time=846] I mean, is he okay?
[time=849] - He's fine.
[time=851] He just arrived yesterday afternoon.
[time=852] Just showed up in a taxi.
[time=854] I spent the rest of the evening with him, and he's got quite a story.
[time=858] - Well, it's nice of him to drop in.
[time=860] Did he have him to mention where he's been since July?
[time=863] - Oh, lots of places.
[time=864] But that doesn't really matter, he's home.
[time=867] I just wanted you to have the opportunity.
[time=869] - What do you mean it doesn't matter?
[time=872] - Look, Chris, I've been through all this.
[time=875] I've been through all the issues, and I think we just put this behind us.
[time=881] So I'm asking you.
[time=882] - That's fine, but it's not like nothing ever happened here.
[time=886] He did disappear for eight months.
[time=888] Doesn't that bother you?
[time=889] - It was nine and a half months.
[time=891] And yes, it bothered me.
[time=895] But I'm just asking you to let it go.
[time=903] Well, what do you do with the money?
[time=904] Did he buy the franchise?
[time=906] - He bought it and it's closed.
[time=910] - What do you mean it's closed?
[time=911] - It failed and never opened.
[time=914] - You're telling me he spent $120,000 on a carpet franchise that never opened?
[time=921] - That was only $60,000.
[time=923] The rest was on some other things.
[time=925] - You could be kidding.
[time=927] He lost it all, didn't he?
[time=928] The idiot went out and spent every penny.
[time=931] He went off and wasted a small fortune.
[time=933] And now he's come crawling back to you.
[time=937] And I said, he did crawl, didn't he?
[time=940] - Well, yes, he did, or he would have, you see.
[time=942] - Well, what are you gonna do?
[time=946] - I'm gonna take him back.
[time=948] - What does that mean, take him back?
[time=950] - I'm gonna take him back.
[time=951] How complicated can that be?
[time=953] We're gonna start with a party for him at the latest Saturday.
[time=958] You'll see, he's different.
[time=960] You're gonna have a party for the son who wasted your money and disgraced your name?
[time=965] - Yes, he's my son, and that's only money.
[time=968] My son, your brother is home.
[time=971] Well, that may come as shocked to you, but it is possible to be so committed to someone that they cannot forfeit your love, you know?
[time=979] - That must be the key to getting noticed around here, you know, all this time I thought it was hard work, honesty, and common sense, but now I find out I was all wrong, I guess the way to get depreciated is to go off and squander a small fortune.
[time=995] - Chris, you know that's not true.
[time=997] - Dad, he's taking advantage of you, can't you see that?
[time=1000] He's making a fool out of you.
[time=1002] - Well, you let me worry about that.
[time=1003] It wasn't your money you lost, now it wasn't.
[time=1007] - Fine, you know, you just have your stupid party, but don't expect me to show up and support the thing.
[time=1014] He's your problem now.
[time=1015] - Chris, I do the same with you.
[time=1019] But it's not me, Dad, don't you see that?
[time=1022] I never failed you like that.
[time=1023] I never put you through that kind of immaturity, and wanted to get me, huh?
[time=1027] Tell me, what's that worth?
[time=1029] [MUSIC]
[time=1035] - Well, because my brother is pastor at County Line Church
[time=1046] of God, I really feel obligated to tell you if he didn't do anything like that.
[time=1050] But about the same tone, similar words, how hard I had worked,
[time=1057] I didn't want to make that opportunity happen, and eventually I did give in.
[time=1065] I'm Mitchell Cruz again, and I'm a friend of Kelly's, and we've been teaching a series called Contagious Christian.
[time=1070] Hear the hour before this hour.
[time=1074] And Kelly asked me to share with you today while he's in California, sunny California, at a pastor's conference.
[time=1080] And today we're gonna talk about Black Hawk's core values, one, two, and three.
[time=1085] And if I had to sum it up in one idea, what's the big idea we're gonna talk about today, it's the heart of the Father.
[time=1092] It is the heart of the Father.
[time=1093] If you want to turn to Luke 15, we're gonna talk about the heart of the Father, Luke 15.
[time=1100] I want to give you just a little bit of background.
[time=1105] The Pharisees, it's a group of people that Jesus is talking to were religious guys, really religious guys.
[time=1111] And there are 613 laws in the Old Testament.
[time=1114] The Old Testament existed at this time when Jesus was walking the earth.
[time=1118] But the Pharisees had about 1,500 or 2,000 laws on how to interpret the 613 laws.
[time=1124] And one of those was what Jesus was doing.
[time=1127] And that was eating and welcoming centers, which is why you see in verse two, Luke 15 to, the Pharisees got a problem and they say, "He welcomes and he eats with sinners." When Jesus preached the gospel message, tax collectors and prostitutes got it.
[time=1145] But it was a religious who were put off by it.
[time=1147] We do not have many tax collectors and prostitutes in our churches today, so it just begs the question, are we preaching the same message as Jesus?
[time=1157] See, the Pharisees see the heart of God as a big Pharisee.
[time=1161] They have lists.
[time=1163] You know, you and I have lists, we do it all the time.
[time=1166] Black, white, rich, poor, good, bad, Republican Democrat, conservative, liberal, safe, condemned, hard-working, lazy, but Jesus paints a portrait of a God who doesn't have those kinds of lists.
[time=1182] And it says in Luke 15, three, he told them this parable.
[time=1185] Many scholars say that these are actually one parable.
[time=1192] These three parables are actually one parable.
[time=1194] He told them this parable.
[time=1196] A parable is this idea, a spiritual idea thrown alongside, a spiritual truth rather, thrown alongside a physical one.
[time=1206] So Jesus throws a physical truth alongside a spiritual one and it puts all the emphasis of interpretation on the listener.
[time=1213] Jesus intends to tease the mind and have you leave thinking about what he's saying, okay?
[time=1220] And usually parables have one, two, or three points, but the big idea here is the heart of the Father.
[time=1226] And the first thing that we see is something of value is lost.
[time=1231] Something of value is lost.
[time=1232] Jesus increases the ratio as he increases the value of that which is lost.
[time=1236] So here's what I mean.
[time=1237] One of 100 sheep, one of 10 coins, one of two sons.
[time=1242] Now this third concept involving the son
[time=1249] involves an act of the will.
[time=1252] An act of the will.
[time=1253] When I was nine years old, I went to the Indianapolis 500 with my mom and dad and I kept saying, can I go to the gift shop?
[time=1258] Can I go to the gift shop?
[time=1260] Well, finally they let me go to the gift shop.
[time=1262] Funny thing happens while I'm in the gift shop, I'm getting my allowance or stuff, you know, and I'm all ready.
[time=1267] I come out, anybody know how many people go to the Indianapolis 500?
[time=1271] Four to 500,000 people now stand in between me
[time=1277] and my mom and dad.
[time=1279] And I'm nine years old.
[time=1280] See what had happened is it started to rain and the race was more than half over.
[time=1283] So when it started to rain, they called the race and Bobby Unser wins and Mitch loses his mom and dad.
[time=1290] So, you know, every step back to the seats, every step, I'm thinking more and more, I'm gonna be a permanent resident of Indianapolis.
[time=1299] And so I'm starting to get sadder and sadder and I get kind of to the section where they would be.
[time=1306] And if you've ever been there, you don't see where that is, you come in from behind and I got tears in my eyes, I'm crying and a lady comes up to me and says, "Are you lost?" I said, "Yeah, but my mom and dad are up there, it's okay." And she goes, "No, they're not." I go, "What?" And I don't know this lady, but she assured me that everybody had cleared out of the stands and she was positive they wouldn't be over there 'cause it took a long time to get back there.
[time=1330] So she goes, "I'll help you." Maybe she's an angel.
[time=1335] She starts taking me somewhere, I didn't know where, and out of the corner of my eye, I saw a guy who had ridden down in the bus with us and I ran to that guy.
[time=1343] And I got on that bus and there was my mom and dad.
[time=1347] At nine years old I said, "What were you thinking?" (audience laughing) You know, I just thought about this this morning.
[time=1355] There's probably a little bit of irony in there, it wasn't long after that, that I committed my life that God had got baptized.
[time=1362] And you know, it was that Hebrews 13.5 thing, he will never leave a forsake you.
[time=1366] Figured my mom and dad were, "Jesus wouldn't." So I got into that.
[time=1371] Well, we got an act of the will.
[time=1372] You know, let me just tell you something, Jesus never calls us the parable of the prodigal son, never.
[time=1377] He says there were two sons.
[time=1378] And the climax of the parable is not even the prodigal.
[time=1381] We're gonna look at a painting called "The Return of the Prodigal Son" by Rembrandt.
[time=1388] It was next to last painting, I believe.
[time=1390] I think the last one wasn't finished.
[time=1392] We're gonna talk a little bit about this painting and how it reveals a little bit more about the parable, Jesus is parable.
[time=1398] The reason we're using it is not only that Rembrandt out of the Reformation, a Rembrandt who may have heard Calvin's message of the Reformation.
[time=1406] It's also that Henry Nowan.
[time=1410] Henry Nowan was a great theologian at the top of his game, professor at Harvard, Yale, Notre Dame.
[time=1416] And while he was at Harvard, he said, "You know what?
[time=1418] "I cannot teach the love of God anymore and not live it." So Henry Nowan leaves at the top of his profession, so to speak, and goes to Toronto and teaches and helps kids who were physically and mentally challenged.
[time=1432] He gave his life to that.
[time=1434] But we're gonna be talking about this painting and Rembrandt's desire for us to see some things.
[time=1440] So the first thing we see, if you look at Luke 1511, Luke 1511 and 12, is we have this request.
[time=1448] He said, "There's a man with two sons." And he goes on to verse 12.
[time=1452] "And the younger one said to his father, "Father, give me my share of the estate." "Give me my share of the estate." I think my brother-in-law's here today is from this area.
[time=1462] And in the Middle East, you say that to your parents and you're saying, "I wish you were dead." It's not as loosey-goosey as you and I think of it.
[time=1469] It's not a Western culture kind of a thing.
[time=1471] He's actually communicating to his father, "I wish you were dead." And I'm gonna give you a little sidebar here.
[time=1476] I'm gonna give you three things.
[time=1477] Three things that all these parables are about.
[time=1480] And the first one is something of value is lost.
[time=1482] You have that, but I'm gonna give you a sidebar of five radical things that Jesus has this father do.
[time=1487] And there's the first one, and that's the request.
[time=1490] Verse 12, he gives it to him.
[time=1492] And then the second thing, this never happened.
[time=1496] This is not a typical patriarch of the day.
[time=1498] He also gives him the right to sell.
[time=1501] You know, in our culture, you think, cash it in, man.
[time=1504] Let's just cash it in.
[time=1506] Build it up and cash it in.
[time=1507] Not there.
[time=1508] And you know what? Not here when you got a family farm.
[time=1511] You know what I'm saying?
[time=1512] How that would kind of shame the family when you sell the family farm.
[time=1516] I live on the land that my great-great-great-grandfather homesteaded from the government in 1854.
[time=1522] If I would sell that, I have a great aunt that would probably shoot me.
[time=1526] You know, it's just a big deal, and you can see that a little bit in our culture.
[time=1530] Well, he turns it into cash.
[time=1531] He sells a family farm, and then Jesus says he goes out and he does some riotous living.
[time=1536] I wanna point this out to you.
[time=1537] The Greek word "asotos" for what Jesus is saying for the kind of living that he did is not, and this is a key thing for where we're gonna end up, is not immoral living.
[time=1547] It's just spending all you have.
[time=1549] I'm not saying that's a good thing, but he's not indicating that he's doing anything, but just blowing the dough, all right?
[time=1554] He's just blowing the money.
[time=1556] Well, this is happening to this son, this young son, and he's got this little reminder, 'cause everything's going away, and you see there in verse 13 and verse 14, there's this thing in his mind, and it's called "kisatsa." Everybody say that, "kisatsa." Say it one more time, "kisatsa." And this is what happened.
[time=1578] If you as a Jewish boy lost your money to Gentiles, they had a formal ceremony.
[time=1584] It was a funeral, and it was for you, and you were excommunicated out of the community.
[time=1590] You were done.
[time=1591] And so in his mind, while this is happening, he's thinking, "Kisatsa, kisatsa." You were booted for shaming the family.
[time=1599] This was actually happening.
[time=1600] It's recorded in the Gospel of John to people who would believe in Jesus.
[time=1603] They were getting booted out of the Jewish synagogues in those communities.
[time=1606] So you look in verse 15, verse 15, this is an idea pops in his head.
[time=1612] He plans the recovery.
[time=1613] I'll get the money back.
[time=1619] And you look at verse 16, he says, "I'm starving to death, man.
[time=1624] "Have you ever been there?
[time=1627] "Maybe not starving to death, but in an addiction.
[time=1630] "Or you're starving, and you're craving more and more "and more of whatever it is you're addicted to.
[time=1634] "And the fix you gotta get is bigger and bigger and bigger." (congregation laughing) Well, that's where he is.
[time=1640] And he devises a falsely penitent speech, Allah Pharaoh, and the Pharisees realize this.
[time=1646] Here's what I'm saying.
[time=1647] He says, "Father, he's gonna say," You can see this in which verse says it, 18 and 19.
[time=1653] He says, "Father, here's what I'm gonna go back.
[time=1656] "I'm gonna say, "Father, I sinned against heaven "and against you.
[time=1659] "I'm no longer worthy to be called your son." And three, make me like one of your hired men.
[time=1664] So he's gonna earn the money back.
[time=1666] And he's only saying this 'cause he's starving to death.
[time=1669] And let me just show you, I think we can have it on the screen here.
[time=1671] This is what the Pharisees realized.
[time=1673] This is what Pharaoh said continually in a package of plagues to get rid of them.
[time=1678] He would say this to Moses.
[time=1679] He would say, "It's in Exodus." If you wanna write it down, Exodus 10, 16 and 17 is where there's a clearest resemblance.
[time=1686] He says, "I've sinned against heaven and against you." He says something just like this.
[time=1691] "I'm no longer worthy to be called your son." He's got another phrase for that.
[time=1694] Make me like one of your hired men.
[time=1696] Please take this plague away from me.
[time=1697] And so the Pharisees, here's the point I want you to get.
[time=1700] The Pharisees understand that Jesus is telling them that the lost son, the younger son, is gonna shame his way back in and work his way back to get the money back 'cause he doesn't want what?
[time=1712] He doesn't want quesazza.
[time=1714] Rembrandt identifies with the prodigal son.
[time=1719] His egotistical drive for fame and fortune led him to earn, spend and lose money, fighting many court battles, including bankruptcy proceedings.
[time=1726] And eventually the auctioning of all his possessions, his house and Amsterdam, furniture, paintings, other artist paintings, think what that would be.
[time=1733] In his large collection of artifacts, they're all auctioned off in three auctions.
[time=1737] In 1657 and 1658, his popularity as a painter declined.
[time=1742] And during the next three decades, listen to this, Rembrandt loses three sons, two daughters, two wives, and he dies in 1669, a lonely old man.
[time=1751] If we can go back to the painting on the screen, I just want you to see that a scholar points out, and I think you can see it, that Rembrandt paints the head of the prodigal son as that of a newborn baby.
[time=1765] Look at that, he paints it as that of a newborn baby.
[time=1769] That's what they critics think that he's doing there.
[time=1773] The first black-caught core value is that all people matter to God.
[time=1778] All people matter to God, write it down.
[time=1781] All people matter to God.
[time=1784] Lists, not with God.
[time=1785] John 1-9 says, "Jesus lice the heart of every man, give spiritual life what it's talking about in the context.
[time=1792] Every single man who walks the earth." 2 Peter 3-9 says, "God wants no one to perish but all to come in." 1 Timothy 2-4, "God wants all men to be saved and come to the knowledge of saving truth." Acts 10-35, "Men from all nations," Luke 11-13, "Anyone who asked for the spirit of God will receive it." James 1-21, respond to the word that's planted in you.
[time=1812] Romans 1-16-17, gospel for anyone who believes.
[time=1815] 2 Corinthians 5-15, Christ died for all.
[time=1818] 5-19, He reconciled the world to Himself.
[time=1823] Here's the point I want you to get.
[time=1825] We've been tossing this around.
[time=1826] This is a friend of mine is calling this phrase.
[time=1828] We've been talking about it in contagious Christian, becoming a contagious Christian.
[time=1832] I want you to write this down.
[time=1835] Will I consider every encounter with another human being as a divine appointment by God to point that person to Jesus?
[time=1843] Will I consider every encounter with another human being a divine appointment by God?
[time=1850] Will I consider every encounter with another human being as a divine appointment by God to point that person to Jesus?
[time=1857] At work, at drive-ups, at the grocery, on telephone calls, will I be gentle?
[time=1861] When I see people, will I look into their eyes?
[time=1864] Will I ask questions?
[time=1865] Will I listen?
[time=1866] Will I consider every encounter with another human being a divine appointment by God to point that person to Jesus?
[time=1875] Will I know another go first in line?
[time=1877] Well, the first thing is that something of value is lost.
[time=1882] The second thing Jesus is showing is there's pursuit.
[time=1885] With the sheep, with the coin, there's pursuit.
[time=1888] You look at verses 20 and 21 there.
[time=1891] Jesus paints his picture of what repentance is.
[time=1894] Many say, I think it's Mark 115, where Jesus introduces his preaching.
[time=1899] And he says two words, three if you count and.
[time=1903] Repent and believe.
[time=1905] You know, what's he mean by that?
[time=1907] Well, Jesus in this picture has a chance to show this to the Pharisees, and he paints repentance as accepting to be found.
[time=1915] Here's what I'm showing you.
[time=1916] Kenneth Bailey has shined a lot of light on parables.
[time=1920] He's a scholar, he's a New Testament professor in Jerusalem, and he's probably given us more understanding in this Western culture to how to interpret parables than any other man who's ever lived.
[time=1929] He's still alive, and he writes some of this.
[time=1932] He says that the Father sees the Son a long way off.
[time=1936] He said the Pharisees know that's Isaiah 57, 19.
[time=1939] It means spiritual and physical.
[time=1940] The Father sees his Son a long way off.
[time=1943] And here's the third thing in the sidebar that the Father does, not done in the culture.
[time=1947] It's got his robe on.
[time=1949] What's he do?
[time=1951] He runs.
[time=1952] A Father did not run in that culture like that.
[time=1956] He runs.
[time=1957] You know who would run?
[time=1959] A mother.
[time=1960] Old Testament includes many references to God as a father with characteristics of a mother.
[time=1965] You see that the Father has a plan of his own.
[time=1967] He reconciles with his Son in public outside the village, so no one will do what?
[time=1973] Kitzatsa.
[time=1975] This is radical.
[time=1976] This is not what the prodigal expects.
[time=1978] And now the lost son's speech changes.
[time=1981] The third portion of his speech, if you look there, I think it's verse 21, make me like one of your hired men.
[time=1986] That's the third portion of his falsely penitent speech.
[time=1989] It's dropped.
[time=1990] It's done.
[time=1992] And he just says, I've sinned against you.
[time=1995] I've sinned against you.
[time=1996] In verse 21, I've sinned against heaven and against you.
[time=2003] I'm no longer worthy to be called your son.
[time=2006] He accepts to be found.
[time=2009] In this most succinct way of describing it, I would tell you that repentance is saying to God, I can't.
[time=2015] I can't earn my way back to you.
[time=2017] Faith says to God, you can.
[time=2021] There are two inseparable sides of the same coin.
[time=2023] If you could write that down, repentance, I can't.
[time=2027] Faith to God says you can.
[time=2030] We go to verse 22 and 23, and you see this reconciling father.
[time=2034] Once again, Jesus is equating himself with a father.
[time=2038] Three times in the Old Testament, God is the good shepherd going after the lost sheep.
[time=2042] And I just want you to know that that search, that parable when Jesus tells right before this, the part where he talks about the lost sheep, it doesn't mean the other 99 are neglected.
[time=2051] Bailey and other scholars point this out.
[time=2053] There are more than one guy.
[time=2054] There's just more than just one guy tending the sheep.
[time=2057] So don't think that, and kind of get that out of your mind that he's neglecting the other 99.
[time=2061] You're going to see that's a characteristic of a certain person I'm going to describe here, but that's not what's going on.
[time=2066] The second Blackout core value is that pursuit of Christ results in pursuit of disciples.
[time=2071] Pursuit of Christ results in pursuit of disciples.
[time=2075] Second Timothy 2, 2, it's the campus crusade, theme verse, win, build, send.
[time=2080] It's a concept of teaching teachers, of creating leaders.
[time=2084] I just want to ask, who is lost that you pursue like that?
[time=2088] Is there anyone?
[time=2088] Is there any lost person that you pursue like that?
[time=2090] Anyone?
[time=2091] Better yet, who pursued you like that?
[time=2094] Ask yourself, who pursued you like that?
[time=2096] My daughter used to travel to auctions with me.
[time=2099] She's here today.
[time=2101] She's 11, almost 12, she wants me to say she's 12.
[time=2105] There should be 12 in May.
[time=2106] Well, when she was four, she went to an auction with us.
[time=2109] And we had quite a distance.
[time=2111] I shared this a few months ago on a Wednesday night.
[time=2113] We had quite a distance from our room to the restaurant at the hotel.
[time=2117] So I was holding her hand and we walked to the room, coming to the restaurant from the room.
[time=2122] And because of some things that had happened in my life, I won't go into it.
[time=2126] I was fearful that someone would take her.
[time=2128] She was often seen with me in front of crowds this large or larger, and I just had that fear.
[time=2133] Well, we were standing there at the restaurant, looking at the menu.
[time=2138] And I'm holding Megan's hand, she's four.
[time=2140] And I just let go for an instant to, somebody said something to me.
[time=2144] I turned back and she was gone.
[time=2146] And I looked and I thought, well, she just got to be right here and she was gone.
[time=2152] And I ran up and down that hallway.
[time=2155] I went outside and I memorized license plate numbers.
[time=2158] And I started screaming for my daughter.
[time=2160] And you know what?
[time=2161] The way you're feeling right now, the way you're connecting to me, that's the way God feels about every single human being.
[time=2166] And what he does to pursue every single human being on this planet.
[time=2170] And you know, I was fortunate.
[time=2174] Something told me just opened the girl's restroom door and there she was with a nine or 10 year old girl who had just taken her to the bathroom.
[time=2181] Well, I'm a finite dad.
[time=2188] God's an infinite father.
[time=2192] You know, if I love my daughter that way, think how God loves you.
[time=2194] I'd like you to consider pursuing a relationship that you think God wants you to pursue so you can multiply the efforts that he made through the person who pursued you.
[time=2205] Maybe you could do this, jot it down.
[time=2206] Maybe you need to send a thank you note that someone who's made an impact in your life.
[time=2210] Someone who pursued you for God in a relationship for God.
[time=2214] Well, the third thing we see in all the parables is restoration.
[time=2217] If you want to write it down, restoration.
[time=2219] First one was something a value is lost.
[time=2220] Second one is there's pursuit 'cause there's so much value.
[time=2224] Third one is restoration.
[time=2225] There's rejoicing.
[time=2228] What's going on here?
[time=2229] There's rejoicing.
[time=2230] Verse 24.
[time=2231] And Jesus is saying the father's response reflects the mind of God.
[time=2236] And you get the response of the older brother there.
[time=2239] Verse 25, there's some servants out there and the brother says, you know what's going on?
[time=2245] And he hears this concept that your brother was lost.
[time=2248] Now he's found, lost and now he's found.
[time=2251] Lost there is equated with death.
[time=2253] Found is equated with life.
[time=2255] Death is separation from God.
[time=2257] Kelly's been talking a lot about that.
[time=2259] Well, who found the younger son?
[time=2260] Who found him?
[time=2261] To say it, who found him?
[time=2264] The father, where do you find him?
[time=2266] Outside the village.
[time=2268] Remember, he did that.
[time=2270] His son was still lost and still dead when he was outside the village and the father goes and gets him and the servant there says it's safe and sound.
[time=2280] There's a key concept there.
[time=2281] Safe and sound in Hebrew is Shalom.
[time=2283] In Greek it's where we get our word for hygiene.
[time=2286] Peace, reconciliation.
[time=2288] That's what happened.
[time=2289] That's what Jesus is saying that happened.
[time=2291] Peace, reconciliation, the theme of Paul's writings, by the way, happened right there when he found him and that's getting communicated by Jesus to the Pharisees.
[time=2301] Grace offered and accepted not requirements of the law demanded.
[time=2305] Grace took place.
[time=2309] No requirements to earn it back.
[time=2311] Angry that the younger son is reconciled without paying for his sins, kind of like the drama.
[time=2315] He refuses to go into the celebration.
[time=2317] This is absolutely unthinkable.
[time=2320] A public insult to the father that the older brother says, "I will not go in." And he's so angry that he takes the radical step of breaking his relationship with the father in verse 28.
[time=2331] Now this response, Jesus is showing a contradiction to the servant and to the father.
[time=2335] And you see there in verse 28, the father chases him down and pleads with them.
[time=2341] The father chases him down and pleads with him.
[time=2344] And guess what, is he get a public shouting match?
[time=2346] And that's equally as outrageous in that culture.
[time=2349] That's the unthinkable to have this explosion in public at this kind of a thing, at this kind of a celebration.
[time=2354] And what's the father do in spite of that explosion?
[time=2359] He stoops down to find another lost son, another lost sheep, another lost coin.
[time=2368] That's the fourth radical thing that Jesus is painting a picture of God the father.
[time=2373] Look at verses 29 and 30, but he answered his father, look all these years I've been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders.
[time=2381] Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends.
[time=2388] But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fat and calf for him.
[time=2395] He didn't squander his money on prostitutes.
[time=2399] The older son's making it worse than it is.
[time=2402] He's leveraging it.
[time=2404] You ever do that?
[time=2405] Kind of leverage, like an older brother?
[time=2409] Let's look at the painting.
[time=2410] Rembrandt identifies with the older brother.
[time=2412] He too was difficult.
[time=2414] He was living with his son's nurse for six years and he decided he didn't want her anymore and he got her institutionalized.
[time=2422] He did it through manipulating a power of attorney that her brother had.
[time=2425] And during this time he got so consumed by it that he didn't paint a painting for a year.
[time=2431] If you look at this painting, it's not centered on the prodigal.
[time=2435] It's centered on the contrast between the father and the prodigal and the older son.
[time=2442] That's the older son that has the staff pointed downwards erect.
[time=2445] They each have red cloaks.
[time=2446] It's hard for you to see.
[time=2447] They both have red cloaks.
[time=2449] They both have beards.
[time=2450] But there's a contrast in how they're standing.
[time=2454] Rembrandt paints, and it's hard for you to see this, he paints light on the father's face.
[time=2459] He paints light on the older brother's face.
[time=2462] See that?
[time=2463] But the light on that Rembrandt paints on the father goes down to his hands and on the younger brother.
[time=2472] And it's like a halo effect of warmth that engulfs the younger brother while the hands of the older brother are in the shadows and dark.
[time=2480] He's painting a tension between the father bent over the prodigal son and the stiff erect posture of the older brother.
[time=2487] You know, in Exodus 34, six, God tells Moses, I'm gonna show you who I am.
[time=2492] And he says, this list of things that he is, and there's a word that he says in there that he says, it's said about 30 times about him in scripture.
[time=2500] And it's gracious.
[time=2501] God says, I am gracious.
[time=2503] Strong says that gracious means to literally stoop or to bend down to one who is inferior.
[time=2509] To stoop or to bend down to one who is inferior.
[time=2512] See what the father's doing?
[time=2514] He's stooping and bending down.
[time=2515] See what the older brother will not do?
[time=2518] And we see the reaching, radical love of the father.
[time=2520] If you look in verse 31, he says, my son, you are always with me and everything I have is yours.
[time=2526] Three thanks, my son.
[time=2528] You're always with me and everything I have is yours.
[time=2530] Spirit Sodyahadi says that the great theologian scholar says that the father's right to ownership of either son was never relinquished.
[time=2538] Think about that with me.
[time=2539] The father's right to ownership of either son was never relinquished.
[time=2543] You're always with me and everything I have is yours.
[time=2546] You know why he says everything I have is yours?
[time=2549] When the younger son got his share of the estate, guess who got his?
[time=2554] The older brother.
[time=2556] Deuteronomy.
[time=2558] Deuteronomy 21, 17 says, 2/3 goes to the older son 1/3 to the younger.
[time=2566] The older brother, God, twice what the younger brother got
[time=2572] and has the gall to say that he got his share too.
[time=2575] If you don't believe me, look in verse 12.
[time=2577] Says he divided it among them.
[time=2579] Cook of verse 32.
[time=2583] But we had to celebrate and be glad because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again.
[time=2590] He was lost and now is found.
[time=2593] Jesus in the climax of the parable, remember he's telling to the Pharisees, grabs them, brings them up, makes them the climax of the parable and says, in essence, what are you going to do with the radical limitless love of the father?
[time=2607] Jesus is criticized for welcoming and eating with sinners and he says in essence, it's worse than you think.
[time=2612] He chases them down.
[time=2614] The third Black Hawk value is that God has called the church to initiate and cultivate life-changing relationships and salvation is an act of God.
[time=2625] What relationship in your life or what part of your life needs restored?
[time=2631] Will you let God restore it and use you to restore others?
[time=2636] James 4/8 says, "Draw near to God, he'll draw near to you." I watched one of my best friends die in a racing accident on television.
[time=2647] I have only one hope of that relationship being restored and it said, "I know that I know that he's with God." And one day he's going to grab my hand and say, "Hey, man, this place is great." How you been?
[time=2660] Well, we got three world views from the three main characters in this and this may just shed a little light on who you are.
[time=2667] Which one are you?
[time=2668] First one's a younger brother.
[time=2669] Younger brother's worldview is a relativistic grid that states the liberal and licentious are in and the narrow are out.
[time=2675] Let me say it a different way.
[time=2676] The permissive are in.
[time=2677] The younger brother says the permissive are in.
[time=2679] It feels good, do it.
[time=2680] Just do it, man, and the rigid are out.
[time=2683] The permissive are in and the rigid are out.
[time=2685] But Jesus blows this away by displaying the consequences of that thought.
[time=2689] The younger brother is the law breaker.
[time=2692] Lives for today 'cause tomorrow never comes in his mind.
[time=2695] He does the shame thing.
[time=2696] You ever do that?
[time=2697] Does the shame thing?
[time=2698] He's gonna shame his dad into taking his back.
[time=2700] Low moral standards, low moral standards.
[time=2703] His form of criticism toward others is jealousy 'cause he has a tendency to see people is better than he is all the time, always comparing.
[time=2709] So his form of criticism to others, the younger brother is jealousy.
[time=2713] Always feeling resentment, you know, if they're better off than he is.
[time=2715] But when he succeeds, a younger brother tends to be afraid that other people are gonna be jealous of him.
[time=2720] You know what, what probably began with the younger brother as care for self, legitimate care for self, personal vitality became self-indulgence.
[time=2732] And you know if you're the younger brother, by and large, most of the time, generally true, you're sitting in the balcony and you're sitting in the back.
[time=2739] That's the younger brother.
[time=2740] Well, we have the older brother.
[time=2742] His worldview is the traditional values grid which says that the moral are in and the immoral are out.
[time=2748] But I don't know if you've ever been around many younger brother types, but they even have morals about how you're supposed to be loose.
[time=2754] And then then there's times when they say, "Well, you know, you can't do that.
[time=2757] "You can do that, but you can't do that." And so they really almost always comes down to this older brother grid.
[time=2762] Jesus describes the futility in this grid by uncovering the heart of the older brother.
[time=2768] Morality is a good thing, okay?
[time=2770] It just does not save because our fallen morality falls short of God's character, Isaiah 64, 6, like filthy rags.
[time=2778] You see what I'm saying?
[time=2779] You're not gonna earn your way to God by just being a good person.
[time=2783] Whereas the younger brother's a law breaker, the older brother's a law keeper.
[time=2787] It's most of us here today.
[time=2788] You're responsible, living for tomorrow.
[time=2791] And you know what, you're a little bit angry.
[time=2794] You're a little bit angry.
[time=2795] When you're experiencing trials in your life, in your mind, you don't think it's a result of your sin, you're mad at God.
[time=2804] But if you're experiencing trials in your life and you know it's because in your mind of some sin, you're mad at yourself.
[time=2810] You're always mad 'cause you think that the love of the Father depends on you.
[time=2814] And God says back, did you get in this to serve me or for me to serve you?
[time=2821] The heart of the older brother, his view.
[time=2824] Joyless, conditional, mechanical obedience.
[time=2827] Withholding your heart.
[time=2829] High moral standards, but the irony is they don't even compare to God's.
[time=2833] Charles Spurgeon, the great preacher, tells a story of a peasant who gave a king to the king.
[time=2842] A peasant gave a carrot to the king.
[time=2845] King gives back the peasant three acres.
[time=2850] A nobleman's watching this and says carrot, three acres.
[time=2854] Horse, I'll give the king a horse.
[time=2859] So it gives the king nobleman, gives the king a horse.
[time=2861] Nothing happens.
[time=2863] Goes to the king and says, I don't get it king.
[time=2865] Carrot, three acres, horse, nothing.
[time=2871] And the king says, the peasant gave a gift to me.
[time=2875] You gave the horse to yourself.
[time=2879] And that's often what we do as the older brother.
[time=2881] We don't perceive grace, receive, so we don't do grace issued.
[time=2886] We see God as a taskmaster rather than a loving father.
[time=2889] No communion with God, like the older brother in the parable.
[time=2892] Maybe you've become a foreigner in your own house.
[time=2895] Every relationship gets affected by this darkness.
[time=2898] Maybe you're another thing, another sign of older brother symptoms is you're judging and you're condemning.
[time=2903] Your form of criticism of others is prejudice because you see yourself better than others.
[time=2909] See what I'm saying?
[time=2910] You're doing the moral grid and you're saying, I'm better than others.
[time=2913] So your form of criticism to others is prejudice.
[time=2917] But guess what?
[time=2918] It's kind of hidden, you know?
[time=2919] It's kind of a hidden prejudice.
[time=2921] But the love of the father is the great heart revealer.
[time=2925] You know, if you're an older brother, probably what began as care for others has slipped into your life just being overextended.
[time=2932] It may have began as a genuine care for others, but it slipped into being overextended.
[time=2937] You know, older brothers you're sitting on down here on the floor, you're up front.
[time=2942] I know because I'm an older brother.
[time=2944] Well, we have the younger brother's worldview.
[time=2948] You know, it's by the moral grid.
[time=2950] And if you really put them together, they're both trying to do the moral grid thing.
[time=2953] But we got the father's worldview and it's different.
[time=2956] Here's the gospel grid.
[time=2957] It says that the humble are in and the prouder out because both kinds of lostness, the younger and older brother, are rooted in pride.
[time=2966] And life depends, life depends on the love of the father.
[time=2971] The gospel grid says the humble are in and the prouder out.
[time=2976] The gospel grid defines sin as running from God.
[time=2980] Both brothers ran from the father, but in two different ways, each with the same hard heart.
[time=2986] The gospel grid says that your goodness or your self-righteousness older brother can be as big of a barrier to God as your badness, younger brother.
[time=2995] My self-righteousness can be just a big barrier to God as my badness.
[time=3000] But we have a father who's given it all so that we can come into the celebration of life, which Jesus shows in his parable.
[time=3006] If we come in, then our heart, guess what?
[time=3008] We'll emulate the heart of the father.
[time=3010] We too will chase down sinners.
[time=3012] Black Hawk's values come from the gospel grid.
[time=3016] It's this merciful grid by which God chooses who is in and who is out.
[time=3021] It's clearly stated in Romans 9, 15 and 16, not by desire, mine, not by my effort, but by his mercy.
[time=3030] Let me just ask you, do you, older brothers and younger brothers alike, understand that you deserve justice?
[time=3037] Will you ask God for mercy?
[time=3040] Do you understand that you deserve justice?
[time=3044] Will you ask for mercy because God will give you grace?
[time=3051] You know, you may have been sitting in this pew
[time=3058] for eight years here or a church like it or 80 years.
[time=3061] And I'm gonna ask you, will you accept the invitation to the celebration, to the kingdom of God and stop seeing Christianity, older brothers, stop seeing Christianity as religion, a ritual and begin to see it as what it is, a living, vibrant relationship with the God of the universe that changed my life and others like it all over the world in the history of time.
[time=3082] Like the lost sheep, the lost coin, the changed heart of the lost son and the offer made to the older brother, will you accept to be found?
[time=3090] Will you come out of what I call the prison of pride and rejection, the great masquerade?
[time=3095] Will you humble yourself, bowing the knees of your heart to God and accept the heart of the Father?
[time=3101] The point of Jesus' parable is that you and I receive the heart of the Father, that you and I become the heart of the Father and perhaps the best way to love God, the best way to know God, the best way to find God is to allow Him to love you, to allow Him to know you, to allow Him to find you.
[time=3118] Let's look at Rembrandt's painting one last time.
[time=3122] You see the Father's hands?
[time=3126] His left hand is strong and muscular, it's that of a Father.
[time=3129] His left hand, His left hand, strong.
[time=3133] Fingers spread out, thumb shows pressure, Rembrandt showing pressure as if he's holding on.
[time=3139] But the right hand is that of a mother.
[time=3142] Rembrandt paints the right hand of the Father as that of a mother, refined, soft, tender.
[time=3147] One scholar points out that the Father's left hand corresponds with the Son's right foot, which is covered.
[time=3153] You see that?
[time=3154] It's covered.
[time=3155] And that Fatherly hand protects the Son's strength to live life.
[time=3159] But the Father's right hand corresponds with the bare foot of the prodigal and protects his vulnerability.
[time=3167] It protects his vulnerability.
[time=3169] So which world view do you hold?
[time=3170] Younger brother, older brother?
[time=3174] I've asked the team to come up.
[time=3177] And as they sang, I'd like you to just, with me would you bow your head and close your eyes?
[time=3185] Pride is the lock on the human heart
[time=3191] and humility is the key.
[time=3192] Let me say that again.
[time=3193] Pride is the lock on the human heart.
[time=3194] Humility is the key.
[time=3197] Bow your head, close your eyes, and listen to me.
[time=3200] Is it time for you to humbly come to the Father?
[time=3203] Whatever you're pridefully holding back, you know, it might be money.
[time=3208] Whatever you're saying that I can do better than God, it might be control of your money, it might be control of your family, it might be control of your career, it might be control of your friends, control of your spirit, your mind, your emotions, your will, your body.
[time=3219] I'm asking you that represents, I'm telling you that represents a part of your heart and I'm asking you to give it to God today.
[time=3225] Give it to the Father.
[time=3227] I want to be unmistakably clear.
[time=3230] I'm asking every single person in this building now, younger brothers and older brothers alike to come to the Father.
[time=3237] I found as an older brother in my life that the easiest way to avoid heart transformation is to accept Jesus as an example, but maintain control of my own life.
[time=3247] So I'm not discounting the gospel message by asking you to just get saved today.
[time=3254] I'm asking you to become a fully devoted follower of Jesus Christ.
[time=3259] Haven't you endured enough of the pain that comes from rejecting the heart of God?
[time=3264] I know I did.
[time=3265] Would you like to experience life in its fullness?
[time=3269] If you won't trust God, if you won't trust the life, death, resurrection and spirit of Jesus for forgiveness and grace, you're saying that your standards of forgiveness and eternal abundant life are higher than God's.
[time=3284] That's the irony.
[time=3285] Luke 15 10 says there's a celebration in heaven over one sinner who repents.
[time=3291] If you come to the Father today and you've never done that, you will have a banner in heaven with your name on it.
[time=3298] And many of you are already in relationship with God, but your heart no longer resembles the heart of the Father.
[time=3305] That's you.
[time=3307] I want you to ask Him to restore your heart, giving you grace that radically spills out and overflows to others in love and forgiveness.
[time=3317] Do your business with God.
[time=3319] You can kneel if you want to kneel.
[time=3321] Do whatever you got to do, but do your business with God right now with your heads bowed and your eyes closed.
[time=3331] And if you want and you think this is for you and this is what you want to do, you can come up and you come forward and we'll pray with you.
[time=3337] But you do whatever it is with your eyes closed and your head bowed.
[time=3340] You do your business with God right now and humble the knees of your heart to God.
[time=3345] Come to the Father.
