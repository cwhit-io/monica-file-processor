[time=111] (upbeat music)
[time=121] (applause) - This morning, we're gonna have a few students, actually, a leader and two students come up and give you a brief little testimony about some things that God did last week.
[time=137] Two weeks ago, now, on our mission 2002 Fort Wayne.
[time=142] And I would challenge you this morning if you get a chance to find anybody in a tie-dyed shirt and just ask them to tell you a story.
[time=148] They'll all have a story to tell.
[time=150] So listen to their stories and we're gonna have a song and show you some pictures from the week.
[time=159] - We were given three, am I on?
[time=164] Can you hear me now?
[time=168] Thank you.
[time=169] We were given three objectives for the week.
[time=173] And the objective that I'm gonna be talking about tonight is experiencing the body of Christ in action.
[time=178] And there were many, many ways that this happened this week in a variety of different forms.
[time=183] But the one I'm gonna talk to you about today is the night of the flood.
[time=187] And I kinda like to paint a picture for you if I could.
[time=189] We were all in the sanctuary and we were getting ready for our praise and worship time, our time to come together and debrief and share what God had done in our lives that day.
[time=197] And Matt Toth came in and said, "Hey, there's some water coming in the gym." So we went out to check it out.
[time=203] And if you can imagine a gym, there's a big garage door and the water's coming up, it's about this high.
[time=209] And then there's another smaller door and the water's about a foot and a half high on it.
[time=213] And it's just coming in.
[time=215] They've got some pumps out there going already but it's just not holding the water back.
[time=219] And it's sloped from the gym into the rest of the salvation army just like our floor is here.
[time=225] And I know the last thing that you would think of would be to grab a towel and start sipping up water and ringing it out into a bucket.
[time=232] But when you've got 65 members of this body of Christ bringing out their towels and soaking up that water with those towels and ringing them into buckets, we were able to keep the water back and it only came about 10 foot into the gym.
[time=245] And all during this time, they're doing that without being asked.
[time=249] There's not really a leader, they're just all working together and it was just an awesome sight.
[time=254] And to see them doing that, we had some adult leaders out digging trenches to get the water down the hill.
[time=259] We had clusters of groups on the gym floor where it was dry praying about what was going on.
[time=265] We also had a couple of areas where the flood was coming in on one door and going down in the basement.
[time=271] We ended up getting bucket brigades going there.
[time=273] And it was just an awesome sight and very humbling to see all that happen.
[time=277] And I had the awesome privilege of being with Major Turner, who is the pastor at Salvation Army.
[time=282] And he shared with me that he didn't even ask anybody.
[time=285] He just watched it all happen and he was amazed.
[time=288] He was humbled and gave all the praise and glory to God as he watched our body of Christ work in action.
[time=293] But also told us that had we not kept the waters back, the water would have ran down the slope.
[time=298] It would have got the electrical room.
[time=299] It would have got the nursery.
[time=300] It would have gotten into the ping pong room where the teens hang out.
[time=303] It would have got into an area where they store food and things where they help with the needy in town who may need that food.
[time=312] So there was a lot of things at stake.
[time=314] And because of this body of Christ in action, we got to see some awesome things.
[time=319] My name is Jeff Winkler.
[time=329] For those of you who don't know me.
[time=330] And my objective of the three was sharing God's love and message with others.
[time=335] And I picked one specific time in the week that I really learned a lot through.
[time=339] It was when we went to the nursing home and split up into groups of two, and it was me and Ashley Feter.
[time=345] And we played cards with two old ladies, and that was fun.
[time=349] But the part that meant the most to me was we were supposed to -- we were headed on our way home.
[time=354] And this nurse brought up this old guy, and I don't want to say he's bitter, but he was kind of mean-spirited.
[time=361] You know what I mean?
[time=362] And so we weren't really even going to talk to him because we only had five minutes ago, and Jeff Fright told us that we should pack up and lean pretty soon.
[time=373] So we just made small talk.
[time=375] And he really -- he turned from mean to -- he was very open with us, very truthful and honest.
[time=383] And we just -- we talked about our background, his background, and he asked us where we were from because we were probably the only people we talked to in like two weeks besides the nurses.
[time=396] And we said we were from Black Hawk Baptist Church, and he told us what denomination he was from and his whole background with religious stuff.
[time=406] And you could tell just by the way he was talking, that he felt really empty, and his religion was just a religion to him.
[time=413] It wasn't a relationship with him.
[time=415] And so I thought we were out of time, so I just kind of cut it off right there and left, and I told him we'd pray for him.
[time=423] And I just felt so bad that I didn't share God's love with him at the time, so me and Ashley headed to the bus, and we felt this heavy burden that it was awful.
[time=433] I can't really describe it in words to you.
[time=435] It's just this huge burden to us that we didn't share God's message with him at that time, and we knew that it was God's will that we should have.
[time=444] So it happened that no one was at the bus at the time, so we ran back in and started talking with him for another half an hour, and Mr. Wright didn't care.
[time=455] It was about, it was for God, so he didn't care.
[time=458] And we just talked with him, had a little fun, and I just couldn't believe how open and honest and how sincere and nice he was after that.
[time=468] I mean, when I first walked up to him, I didn't even really want to talk to him, and neither did the nurses, but it was just, it was amazing to see how much he changed just by God working through me and Ashley, 'cause that was not us, that was God's love.
[time=481] And it touched me a lot to know that everybody outside these doors, that's all they need, is they just need a little glimpse of God's love, and their lives will be changed just like all of ours are.
[time=492] And so I was very thankful for Rick and everybody who sacrificed their whole week to give up, for us to learn that in our lives and to help us grow, so thanks.
[time=504] What I'm gonna talk about is experiencing
[time=515] an interactive relationship with God, and I got to experience that with a small group that we broke out into after lunch.
[time=527] It was called ATL, "Ask the Lord." And what we did, we met with one of our leaders, and she just told us to spread out all over the sanctuary and just pray and just listen for God.
[time=542] And we did that for about two and a half hours, and that really stretched me because I wasn't used to praying that long, and that was probably the most fun I've ever had for those two and a half hours.
[time=557] And seeing everybody pray and then just coming back and talk about what God showed them and reading passages, and then we just figured out what we needed to do.
[time=567] And we just went out and we just did service projects, and I have never seen us more unified with God just by praying for about two and a half hours.
[time=577] And I'm glad that I got to experience that this week, and hopefully we'll stay unified through the summer and through the school year.
[time=613] Now flowing down from hands and feet
[time=621] that were nailed to the tree as grace flows down and covers me.
[time=638] Amazing grace, how sweet the sound.
[time=646] Amazing love, now flowing down from hands and feet
[time=657] that were nailed to the tree as grace flows down and covers me.
[time=667] And covers me.
[time=698] Amazing grace, how sweet the sound.
[time=710] Amazing love, now flowing down from hands and feet
[time=722] that were nailed to the tree as grace flows down and covers me.
[time=733] And covers me.
[time=762] Amazing grace, how sweet the sound.
[time=783] The things you can't see and sing pictures is you just can't feel the love from the people
[time=794] as they respond to God's love being shown.
[time=798] Pictures can't capture that, but man, it's incredible.
[time=802] And the one little boy, I got to mention this, the one little boy, Joel was wearing a blue shirt
[time=808] and bent down by a corner post holding up a bracelet.
[time=811] That was an instant, that boy prayed to receive Christ in his heart.
[time=815] I just happened to be there.
[time=817] We talked with him about the gospel and he was 11, his name was Russell.
[time=821] He said, "I want to pray that prayer.
[time=823] I want to go to heaven." This was on Tuesday, on Wednesday Russell had his friends back talking to Joel about God.
[time=830] And the great thing is we didn't leave Minnesota or Mississippi, but we can keep those relationships going.
[time=837] Praise God.
[time=838] He's so good.
[time=840] We're going to teach you a course real quickly.
[time=842] Some of you heard it when we came in today.
[time=844] And then I'm going to tell you why we're going to sing this song today, but it's pretty good.
[time=848] So we'll just teach you a brief version.
[time=851] Those of you that heard it this morning, please sing out with us, okay?
[time=855] And kind of go to the guys part.
[time=858] We'll do the guys part first.
[time=860] Oh God, you are amazing.
[time=869] Oh God, worthy of praise me.
[time=877] You are amazing.
[time=889] It's pretty easy for the guys part.
[time=891] The girls part is a little bit more difficult because there's some kind of, it's almost, I don't know how to explain it musically, but it goes like this.
[time=898] Oh God, you are amazing.
[time=918] You are amazing.
[time=931] Okay, got that.
[time=932] Now let's all try it one time together.
[time=934] Then I'm going to tell you the story.
[time=936] Here we go.
[time=939] Oh God, you are amazing.
[time=946] Oh God, worthy of praise me.
[time=952] You are amazing.
[time=970] Okay, all right, in a minute we're going to sing that and we need you to sing with us because we really want to worship with that song today.
[time=977] Really cool story.
[time=979] Early on in the week, we have two of our guys, Seth and Chad.
[time=983] Are you guys in there somewhere?
[time=985] Raise your hand.
[time=986] Seth and Chad met a four-year-old boy who had never had a teddy bear or seen it.
[time=993] I'm not even sure he saw one, but he didn't know what one felt like.
[time=997] They got it on their heart, almost right away, to start praying somehow.
[time=1001] We got to get this kid, a teddy bear.
[time=1004] Seth has like, what, 30 of them?
[time=1008] I think he was feeling bad because he goes, "I have 30 of them." This little boy has never had one and so was on their heart.
[time=1016] They took up a little collection between themselves and came up with some money and put it together.
[time=1022] Well, then it got lost because sometimes teenage boys, they go and play basketball and do other things and they lose things.
[time=1029] Now they're feeling bad and they're just starting to pray.
[time=1032] God, please, where are we going to get the money now to get this kid a teddy bear?
[time=1038] Later in the week, on Thursday, my small group mission team was out at a house cleaning up sticks
[time=1044] and we were supposed to have from four to six downtime because we had been up to like two in the morning cleaning up the gym and doing all that stuff.
[time=1051] So they promised us four to six downtime go rest, no work.
[time=1055] And we get a phone call at five till four and said there was a house over by harvester that lost everything in the flood.
[time=1062] Would you guys be willing to go out and check it out?
[time=1065] Well, my team, just like I just took it to them, I said, "Whatever you guys want to do, we can go half of us." And they're like, "We're going. There's no way we're missing out an opportunity to go help someone." So we take the drive over there.
[time=1076] And Dave and I walk through the house and it turns out it wasn't a water problem.
[time=1081] It was a sewer problem.
[time=1082] The sewers backed up through the bathtub and the stool and covered the entire house.
[time=1086] So it wasn't a huge house, but every carpet was soaked, everything was, you know, it was just in bad shape.
[time=1093] Dave and I walk through the front door.
[time=1095] The girls are out in the front and some of the kids are out front praying just for God's direction and what to do.
[time=1100] And we get to the front steps.
[time=1102] And the lady said, "I want you to take these bags with you when you go to Dad. I want to donate them to you."
[time=1108] And in that bag, you know, we're like, "Great." You know, I'm thinking, "Oh, great. It's something that's ruined from the flood." You know, from the, and it's no good.
[time=1117] In that bag, I'm going to have that big one.
[time=1120] In that bag we're 13 of these.
[time=1125] And, you know, Seth and Chad had been praying, and they had $15 between them and they lost it.
[time=1134] And so that night, you know, we presented this to them, and it was just unbelievable to see their face.
[time=1140] And all of our faces were like, "You've got to be kidding." Guess what the price tag says?
[time=1145] $15.
[time=1148] Maybe they, maybe God took that money.
[time=1151] You know, I don't know.
[time=1152] But, uh, because that's what we got, it's a $15 teddy bear.
[time=1158] And then just another one day later, our mission trip leader Bob was walking with the pastor of the Salvation Army through the building and said,
[time=1169] "You know, I wish we had some kind of gift to give to our kids." And the pastor had no idea what this story, he hadn't heard this story yet.
[time=1177] And he just said, "I wish we had some kind of a gift." And he goes, "Well, you know, this is going to seem kind of weird, but what would happen if we gave them one of these?"
[time=1187] Because somebody just donated $2,000 of these to us.
[time=1192] It's got amazing.
[time=1194] So all of our kids got one of these as something to remember.
[time=1198] God's faithfulness by something.
[time=1200] And the words of this song, "God, I see your power and majesty." We see that every day, right?
[time=1206] And then it says, "Your faithfulness endlessly." And we see that every day.
[time=1210] Sometimes we forget his creativity.
[time=1213] And that he is amazing to use something like a little teddy bear to teach.
[time=1217] 65 people.
[time=1219] And now maybe all of us.
[time=1221] How creative and how much he really listens and how much he really loves us.
[time=1224] So we sing this song.
[time=1226] Man, we're just thinking about God's creativity and his power and his majesty and all those things.
[time=1231] So, let's worship together.
[time=1236] God, I see your power and majesty, your faithfulness endlessly, your creativity.
[time=1261] I am in awe.
[time=1272] God, you came to earth in a human frame.
[time=1280] You saved me so out of play.
[time=1285] You came above every mission.
[time=1290] I am in awe.
[time=1295] Oh, God, you are amazing.
[time=1300] Oh, God, worthy of praise.
[time=1305] You are amazing.
[time=1330] Mighty King, I am all I can bring.
[time=1337] I am all I can bring.
[time=1342] I want to do more than to sing.
[time=1347] So I give you everything.
[time=1352] 'Cause I am in awe.
[time=1357] Oh, God, you are amazing.
[time=1362] Oh, God, worthy of praise.
[time=1370] You are amazing.
[time=1389] Let's sing this verse again.
[time=1391] Mighty King.
[time=1395] Mighty King, I am all I can bring.
[time=1403] I want to do more than to sing.
[time=1408] So I give you everything.
[time=1413] 'Cause I am in awe.
[time=1418] Oh, God, you are amazing.
[time=1423] Oh, God, worthy of praise.
[time=1428] You are amazing.
[time=1453] Oh, God, you are amazing.
[time=1457] Oh, God, worthy of praise.
[time=1462] You are amazing.
[time=2094] It is the Holy Spirit who is at work.
[time=2099] It is the Holy Spirit who is moving and prodding and interceding, convicting, bringing strength and encouragement.
[time=2107] It is the work of the Holy Spirit that grows us in our faith as we yield ourselves, as we submit ourselves again and again and again to His work.
[time=2122] Without the work of Christ, without full surrender and faith in Jesus Christ, just as you could no more save yourself without Him, you and I cannot be and will not be grown in our faith, sanctified without a yielding to, a submission to the Spirit of God.
[time=2139] What Paul shows us here in our passage this morning is that life lived in the Spirit, surrendered living to the Spirit of God is the result of a choice.
[time=2150] It is not magic, nor is it automatic.
[time=2154] It is a choice made in the midst of a high stakes, raging spiritual battle.
[time=2160] Spirit-filled living, surrendered living to the Spirit of God is the result of a
[time=2167] choice made in the midst of a battle, a battle between, as Paul describes for us here in Galatians 5, the flesh and the Spirit.
[time=2177] And we're going to look at this quickly this morning and just in three components.
[time=2180] If you've got your pens, write these things down.
[time=2182] Give some thought to this.
[time=2184] Interact with this truth this morning here as we go through it and then write some things down and talk about it with a friend.
[time=2190] Go back over it this week with your small group.
[time=2192] Three things you see here.
[time=2194] Paul gives us a look at three things.
[time=2196] Number one, the face-off.
[time=2198] Spirit-filled living, surrendered living to the Spirit of God takes place in the midst of a face-off.
[time=2203] God's word depicts in Romans 7 in 1 Corinthians 9 in 1 Peter.
[time=2207] God's word depicts for us a high stakes battle, a spiritual and very real conflict
[time=2213] between the flesh and the Spirit.
[time=2215] Here it is, verse 16, he says, but I say, walk by the Spirit and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh.
[time=2222] Four, here you go.
[time=2223] For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit.
[time=2227] And the Spirit sets its desire against the flesh.
[time=2230] For these are in opposition.
[time=2232] Paul uses a Greek phrase there that has military connotations.
[time=2236] These two are enemies.
[time=2238] These two are at war.
[time=2240] These two are diametrically and completely and passionately opposed to each other.
[time=2247] This is not a skirmish.
[time=2249] This is a battle.
[time=2251] And they set themselves in opposition.
[time=2254] Verse 17 says to one another.
[time=2256] So that you may not do the things that you please.
[time=2260] This is a great reminder.
[time=2264] Here we have Paul describing the scene, the battlefield, if you will, as established.
[time=2268] And he says, walk by the Spirit.
[time=2270] See that?
[time=2271] Look at verse 16 again.
[time=2273] Does he say, think about walking by the Spirit?
[time=2276] Yes or no?
[time=2278] No.
[time=2279] Does he say, I've got a suggestion for you.
[time=2281] You might want to consider walking by the Spirit.
[time=2283] Does he say that?
[time=2284] No.
[time=2286] He says to you and he says to me, those of us living in relationship with him.
[time=2290] He says, walk by the Spirit.
[time=2293] It's a great reminder.
[time=2294] The power, listen.
[time=2295] The power for Christian living is entirely from the Holy Spirit.
[time=2298] Just as the power of salvation is entirely in Christ.
[time=2302] But both in the justifying or saving work of Christ.
[time=2306] And in the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit, man's will is active.
[time=2312] And commitment is called for.
[time=2315] Choices must be made.
[time=2318] Obedience must be exercised.
[time=2323] The Christian is not to passively sit by.
[time=2326] Christianity, folks, is not a passive existence.
[time=2329] We're not on the sidelines, as it were.
[time=2331] Simply watching the Spirit do battle for us.
[time=2333] No.
[time=2334] We are called to consider ourselves, as it says in Romans 6, to be dead.
[time=2337] We are to consider ourselves dead to sin.
[time=2340] But alive to God in Christ Jesus.
[time=2342] We are to refuse, it says, to refuse to let sin reign in our mortal bodies.
[time=2348] We are to resist presenting the members of our bodies to sin as instruments of unrighteousness.
[time=2356] And we are to present them the members of our bodies, our eyes, our ears, our feet, our hands.
[time=2362] As instruments of righteousness to God.
[time=2365] Romans 6.
[time=2367] Write it down.
[time=2368] Christianity is active.
[time=2370] He says, "Walk by the Spirit." And I don't know what your deal is.
[time=2375] I don't know what your struggle is.
[time=2377] You probably have many of the same ones I do.
[time=2380] I don't know what it is.
[time=2382] I don't know the specific war, or two or three, that absolutely range in your daily life.
[time=2390] It might be alcohol, it might be spending, it might be food, it might be loving money.
[time=2395] And the job that brings the money, it might be illicit websites, it might be gossip, it might be harsh.
[time=2401] Damaging words spewed on children.
[time=2406] Whatever it is, you know, and I know, that this is how it works.
[time=2412] Whatever it is, the moment you or I begin to get too close to that, the Holy Spirit is faithful.
[time=2421] The Holy Spirit is consistent.
[time=2423] And the Spirit of God, living and dwelling the child of God, throws up yellow flags.
[time=2430] And you hear Him, and you sense Him.
[time=2436] And the Holy Spirit is there pleading.
[time=2439] He jumps up on top of that mountain top and he screams into the back of your head, "Don't do it.
[time=2447] Pull a Joseph. Get out." Does He grab you?
[time=2454] And does He take your hands and your feet and make you, does He?
[time=2457] No. The Holy Spirit is faithful to wave the big red yellow flags of life.
[time=2463] And He whispers in your ears, sometimes He screams it, "Don't do it."
[time=2470] And then He waits for you and He waits for me to make a what?
[time=2474] A choice. To make a choice. Life in the Spirit is active.
[time=2479] Listen, it is the constant, disciplined and ongoing readiness to set your mind on the things above.
[time=2485] Write down Colossians 3, 1-2.
[time=2488] Listen, life in the Spirit is the constant, disciplined and ongoing readiness to set your mind on things above.
[time=2496] To keep seeking the things above, things above, meaning things that matter versus things that don't.
[time=2502] Things that are eternal versus things that aren't.
[time=2506] Living life in the Spirit is a constant, disciplined, ongoing readiness to let the Word of Christ richly dwell within you.
[time=2515] Colossians 3, 16, write it down.
[time=2517] Life in the Spirit is your constant day after day, sometimes moment by moment, disciplined readiness to buffet your body, 1 Corinthians 9, and make it your slave.
[time=2530] To push, to prod, to discipline, to remind.
[time=2534] You say, "My goodness, Col, you make it sound like it's boot camp.
[time=2540] You make it sound like it's this daily battle of mind, and will you make it sound like hard work?"
[time=2548] Well, guess what?
[time=2551] It is.
[time=2553] It's really, really, really hard work, sometimes to live surrendered.
[time=2559] To the Spirit of God as this battle, this war, rages within you and within me.
[time=2567] Verse 16 says, "Walk by the Spirit." But then verse 17 reminds us that this is never, or I should say, seldom easy.
[time=2576] He says, "Do it." But then verse 17 reminds us, "For the flesh is set against the Spirit, and the Spirit is set against the flesh."
[time=2586] Somebody said the Spirit led life as a life of conflict.
[time=2590] You understand that, right?
[time=2592] The Spirit led life is not easy.
[time=2598] The Spirit led life is not you saying some prayer and cruising through life.
[time=2603] You understand the Spirit led life as a life of conflict.
[time=2607] Because it is in constant combat with the old ways of the flesh,
[time=2613] the old ways that continue to tempt and seduce the believer.
[time=2617] The flesh sets its desire against the Spirit and the Spirit against the flesh.
[time=2621] Note this, that the flesh, the term that Paul often uses to describe what remains of the old man.
[time=2630] It's a powerful, powerful picture, and it is just that.
[time=2633] It is the term in the Greek that Paul and others use to describe what remains in you and what remains in me.
[time=2639] It's the part of you and I that doesn't get redeemed.
[time=2643] It's our humanness.
[time=2645] Our souls are redeemed.
[time=2648] Our Spirit is transformed.
[time=2650] We're given new hearts.
[time=2652] That all resides in a very fleshly human what?
[time=2656] Body.
[time=2658] Thus the conflict.
[time=2662] Thus the challenge.
[time=2665] Thus the battle that rages in your life and mine.
[time=2670] Paul knew about it.
[time=2671] Remember back in Romans 7?
[time=2673] You can write that down.
[time=2675] Romans 7, you can read the whole chapter.
[time=2677] And I encourage you to, just read the whole chapter tonight.
[time=2680] I do the things I hate.
[time=2682] Remember that part?
[time=2684] He's talking about the turmoil and the conflict.
[time=2686] The very things I want to do, I don't do.
[time=2689] The very things I do, I don't want to do.
[time=2691] He says he sees the law of sin at work and his members.
[time=2694] And as you read through 15 to 28, it just drives him nuts.
[time=2698] The conflict, the battle, it's so intense.
[time=2703] Do you ever feel that?
[time=2706] Do you?
[time=2707] Do you ever feel and sense that?
[time=2709] I do.
[time=2713] But I don't mind letting you into another window of my own life and experience.
[time=2718] Because I don't think it's any different than a lot of the windows in your own.
[time=2723] You know what, for me?
[time=2725] Not only in this arena, but oftentimes it seems like it comes in waves, much stronger in this
[time=2731] arena.
[time=2732] And I'll just tell you, you know, I live a very public life.
[time=2736] You would understand that.
[time=2739] Do you have any idea what it's like sometimes?
[time=2741] And again, maybe you've experienced this too.
[time=2743] Public or pride, sometimes when I'm away, do you ever get absolutely just?
[time=2750] Do you ever feel like the enemies just loading up both barrels on you when you find yourself in situations when you're away?
[time=2759] I'll be walking through an airport somewhere tired, weary from wherever I've been or whatever
[time=2766] I've been doing.
[time=2767] And it just hits me like a wave.
[time=2771] You're alone.
[time=2774] Nobody here knows you.
[time=2778] Nobody would ever know.
[time=2780] Nobody will ever see.
[time=2784] And you think, good night, I'm just trying to get to the gate.
[time=2787] But we're going to do battle, huh?
[time=2791] You understand that.
[time=2792] You're never safe.
[time=2794] You're never outside the enemy's scope.
[time=2798] He's got you sighted, he's got me sighted.
[time=2801] And he will go to great lengths to bring the battle to your doorstep.
[time=2806] Whether you're home with family or friends or whether you're out and about on your own,
[time=2812] thousands of miles from home where nobody knows you.
[time=2816] It is an intense raging battle.
[time=2819] It's important to remember that this conflict rages in the hearts of the saved.
[time=2823] This conflict rages, this war goes on in the hearts of the saved.
[time=2828] The fully surrendered.
[time=2830] Let me explain.
[time=2831] The flesh is that part of a believer that functions apart from and against the spirit.
[time=2836] It stands against the work of the spirit in the believer's new heart.
[time=2842] Listen, the unsaved, and you're here this morning.
[time=2846] And you know that we're thankful that you're here this morning.
[time=2849] You're seeking.
[time=2850] You're still trying to wrestle with this whole faith thing in relationship with a living God.
[time=2855] And as somebody who hasn't come to that point yet, you might very well identify with this because it's true.
[time=2862] The unsaved person often regrets.
[time=2867] Yeah?
[time=2868] The unsaved person often regrets the sinful things he or she does because of guilt and/or painful consequences.
[time=2875] But he or she has no spiritual warfare going on within him because he has only a human nature and his void of the spirit.
[time=2884] The sinful things he does though often disappointing and even disgusting to him or her are nevertheless consistent with his or her basic nature.
[time=2895] Someone far from God.
[time=2898] He therefore has no real internal conflict beyond whatever conscious may remain.
[time=2903] In his sinful state, it is only in the lives of believers that the spirit can fight against the flesh because it is only in believers that the spirit dwells.
[time=2915] Paul shows us next and we'll wrap this up.
[time=2917] Paul shows us next that when obedience to the spirit, when obedience to the spirit, when a yieldedness to the spirit, you understand that, right?
[time=2926] That is an ongoing activity in the life of a believer.
[time=2930] It is a daily constant readiness to be yielding yourself, submitting yourself, coming under the direction and power and guiding influence of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2941] You ought to be and I ought to be having that conversation often as the day goes by.
[time=2949] Paul shows us next what happens when obedience to the spirit isn't chosen.
[time=2954] And most of you know what happens. The flesh will run its course and the results are deadly, tragic and painful.
[time=2961] Look at verse 19.
[time=2962] Now the deeds of the flesh are evident which are immorality, impurity sensuality, idolatry sorcery, ennities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions, envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these.
[time=2980] Then he gets serious. Of which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you, he must have done that also in the past, just as I have forewarned you in the past, that those who practice such things, right down in your Bible there, Revelation 21, 8.
[time=2997] Revelation 21, 8, that those who practice such things might not, probably won't, shall not.
[time=3009] Not inherit the kingdom of God, those who practice.
[time=3016] Make a note there that there is a difference. Please understand this morning, there is a difference between practicing.
[time=3022] If we were to break that phrase down, you might want to write these things down as well, marked by, characterized by, willingly and readily given to.
[time=3032] The one who practices those things is the one whose life, whose overall pattern of living is marked by those things.
[time=3039] A willingness and a readiness of the heart to give oneself freely to those things. A person is characterized by those things.
[time=3049] That person, God's word says, isn't saved. God's word says that person will not inherit the kingdom of God, but please understand this morning, there is a difference between those who practice and those who struggle.
[time=3061] Can I hear an amen on that? Boy, thanks.
[time=3068] A difference between those who practice those things and those who struggle.
[time=3075] There is a difference. Two things about that list. Let me just draw your attention. Look at that list again, 19 to 21.
[time=3083] Let me just look at it. It's ugly. Really ugly. You can read down through those.
[time=3093] You can read down through those like I can read down through those and your mind just goes rushing back years, sometimes months, sometimes weeks, sometimes days, sometimes hours.
[time=3109] Look at that list. Two things about that list. And I'm going to ask you to be honest.
[time=3116] And I'm going to just stick with what I just said, okay? Look at that list.
[time=3121] People, that list this morning either describes your pattern, it either describes your practice, and if in fact it does, you're in trouble.
[time=3138] You need help. And help is offered.
[time=3144] Or it describes, for you like it does for me, your struggle.
[time=3152] And if in fact it does, describe your struggle. We're in trouble. And we need help.
[time=3161] We need encouragement. We need accountability. And yes, we need to be active, not passive, but we need the support.
[time=3170] We've got the prodding and the reminding and the convicting work of the Holy Spirit within us.
[time=3176] We've got the Word of God reminding us which way to go.
[time=3181] I hope that you've got the people of God around you, living life in close relationship with you, helping move and push and pray and encourage and remind.
[time=3194] But there's two things about that list. It either describes your practice, and if that's the case, we need to talk.
[time=3200] You and a good trusted friend need to talk, or it describes your struggle, in which case we need to keep at it.
[time=3209] Look what begins to take place when you evidence an ongoing readiness to be filled with, led by and surrendered to the Spirit.
[time=3216] Look what new patterns begin to show themselves. Look what takes place in the life of a truly saved, fully surrendered believer.
[time=3225] But the fruit, verse 22, there it is. The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.
[time=3236] Against such things, there is no law. Now it doesn't happen like that.
[time=3242] This is not saying that these are instantaneous. These are the patterns that begin to be evidenced in the life of one whose heart and life have truly been redeemed.
[time=3254] The fruit of the Spirit, when you evidence an ongoing readiness to be filled with, led by and surrendered to the Spirit.
[time=3265] Hear that one more time. Make that your prayer. Make it your thought. Right now.
[time=3272] Just hear those words filled with. Say it again, led by and surrendered to. Say it again, filled with, led by and surrendered to.
[time=3291] Write it down. Keep praying that. Keep asking that, "Oh God, you would fill me with your Spirit, that your Spirit would lead me,
[time=3300] and that I would be surrendered to its leading." And when you do that, those things begin to show up the fruit of the Spirit.
[time=3310] When I read the fruit of the Spirit, a bunch of stuff pops in my head. I'll just mention one to you.
[time=3317] When you look at the fruit of the Spirit, what I see is a complete, others-centered mentality. I mean, you look at them.
[time=3327] There isn't anything about you or me in the fruit. It's all about them. It's all about your wife. It's all about your kids.
[time=3338] It's all about your friends. It's all about those you live with. It's all about them and it's not about you because you're taking care of in him.
[time=3348] Needs are met. Satisfaction experienced. Spirit-filled living, surrendered living. Life lived in the Spirit is never about me. It's always about you.
[time=3357] And my hope this morning is that you know a little bit of what that looks like.
[time=3363] Now my hope is that as you leave this place today, you'd maybe look at those two lists that you might even write down on a couple of separate cards, the deeds of the flesh and the fruit of the Spirit.
[time=3373] And that you might look at those daily for the next week or two, and that you might on a daily basis say, "God, please, Spirit of God, fill me.
[time=3383] Lead me. Give me the strength to surrender myself to these." And say them by name. List them out. Say it back to him. And God, I pray that you would move me in my heart away from these.
[time=3396] And that you would look at that list as ugly and as scary and as painful as it is, and that you would be willing to honestly, in your mind before God, be honest about where those things lead.
[time=3409] Who those things hurt? What those things damage and scar, and that you would day after day after day along with me beg God and the Spirit of God to come and fill you, lead you and direct you, and that you would be surrendered to the Spirit of God.
[time=3427] It is a war, people. It is an absolute battle. Fight it. Fight it hard. Fight it strong. Hold on to somebody. Get two or three. Don't go it alone.
[time=3438] Don't go it alone. Would you stand and we'll pray and get on out of here. Father, what a privilege it's been today to be in this place, to be led into your presence by passionate, optimistic, loving students whose commitment to you is great, whose love for this family is enormous.
[time=3463] God, it's an absolute joy to be with them in your presence and to lift those praises, those songs of truth.
[time=3471] And God, as we look to your Word, we thank you for its relevance and its power.
[time=3475] And I pray, God, that if there's anybody here this morning that needs to...
