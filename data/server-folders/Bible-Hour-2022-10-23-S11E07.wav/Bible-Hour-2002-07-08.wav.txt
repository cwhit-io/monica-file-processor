[time=0] [MUSIC - 97 seconds]
[time=102] I will give you all my worship. I will give you all my praise.
[time=113] You alone, I long to worship. You alone are worthy.
[time=122] I will give you all my worship. I will give you all my worship.
[time=130] I will give you all my praise. You alone, I long to worship.
[time=141] You alone are worthy of my praise.
[time=150] [MUSIC]
[time=157] You can stand with us as we begin to sing.
[time=160] [MUSIC]
[time=165] Here in this house, here in this house of the great King.
[time=173] We come together not to worship Him. This house is built on Christ's samurai.
[time=185] You not be shaken, you not be shaken. Come on, let's put our heads together.
[time=193] God is awesome in this place.
[time=200] He sends His presence as we sing His praise.
[time=205] There is power here for the miracle.
[time=209] She's got the strength to take a broken home.
[time=215] God is awesome.
[time=218] He's so awesome in this place.
[time=222] God is awesome in this place.
[time=229] Here in this house, here in this house of the great King.
[time=238] We come together not to worship Him.
[time=245] This house is built on Christ's samurai.
[time=249] You not be shaken, you not be shaken.
[time=255] God is awesome.
[time=258] God is awesome in this place.
[time=264] He sends His presence as we sing His praise.
[time=270] There is power here for the miracles.

[time=424] God is awesome. He's so awesome in this place.
[time=431] God is awesome in this place.
[time=1957] What do you do?
[time=1977] Somebody I know falls into Galatians 5, 19, and 20.
[time=1985] You can look there.
[time=1987] They could fall into a whole lot more than this, but let's just try to make it as real as possible.
[time=1991] Somebody you know and somebody I know.
[time=1993] Somebody in the family of God falls into immorality and purity.
[time=1997] Maybe sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy,
[time=2003] outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions, envying drunkenness, carousing, and things like these.
[time=2010] Somebody you know falls into a trespass.
[time=2015] What should your posture be toward a fallen follower?
[time=2021] Well, you know what?
[time=2023] There are three possibilities.
[time=2027] Three possibilities that come to mind.
[time=2029] Two very common, one rarely seen.
[time=2034] And I'm going to need some help here with this, and I forgot to ask beforehand so I'll put somebody on the spot.
[time=2045] Dave, would you help me real quick?
[time=2047] Dave Wilkins, come on up here just for a sec.
[time=2051] And this is serious stuff.
[time=2053] So this isn't meant to be funny, this isn't meant to be in any way lighthearted.
[time=2057] I just want to kind of have Dave help me here because there are three responses.
[time=2063] To sin.
[time=2066] To the burden that it brings, to the baggage that comes with it, to the weight that it carries.
[time=2072] And I'm going to just ask Dave if you'll just, I'm going to toss this on your partner, and it is not light.
[time=2078] All right?
[time=2080] It's not light, is it?
[time=2081] No, it's not.
[time=2083] And Dave's just been hit with sin.
[time=2087] Dave's just fallen into a trespass.
[time=2092] And you and I need to figure out how to respond to it.
[time=2096] God's words going to help us today.
[time=2098] One way that you and I, and I mean that, I mean you and I.
[time=2104] I do it all the time.
[time=2106] One way that we respond, you know what, that's so heavy and it's so serious once you go ahead and take a knee.
[time=2113] Because a lot of times that's where my sin takes me, just knocks me down.
[time=2116] Yeah, and you're not doing so good, but yet what happens, a lot of times is that we do this.
[time=2129] Yeah, I mean I'm looking at a room full of people who have fallen into trespasses.
[time=2134] I got a brother right here, he's down, right?
[time=2137] I mean this thing has weighed him down.
[time=2139] And I'm just going like, "Hey Dave, how's it going?
[time=2143] Good, great, good to see you.
[time=2145] I think I'll move on.
[time=2148] You and you and you.
[time=2150] You look great.
[time=2152] You look healthy.
[time=2154] You look good.
[time=2156] Great, call me.
[time=2158] I got to get down here.
[time=2161] We walk around with these things on, in the presence and in the midst of those who have taken a fall.
[time=2168] And we do it because sometimes it's so scary, sometimes it might be confusing.
[time=2173] Sometimes we don't quite know what to say and so we throw the old blinders on and we reduce it.
[time=2182] We reduce it to its barest minimum.
[time=2184] We walk right by it.
[time=2187] It's heavy in it.
[time=2188] Yeah, it's really heavy.
[time=2191] And the longer it sits there and then the longer it pulls, the more discouraged we get.
[time=2196] And then sometimes what we do is this, sometimes we reduce it.
[time=2201] Sometimes we reject.
[time=2204] We do.
[time=2205] Sometimes we reject him.
[time=2210] We do and we give him, we give him what?
[time=2214] Go ahead.
[time=2216] Well, actually sometimes we don't give it to him that nicely.
[time=2219] Again, not meant to be funny.
[time=2221] Sometimes it's just, no, we do.
[time=2226] No joking matter.
[time=2229] Down and out, caught in the trespass, waited down by the burden of that sin.
[time=2237] And we just give him this.
[time=2241] Now take it.
[time=2242] And if you wouldn't mind, just go ahead and sit down there in the front row.
[time=2245] You can take this off when you get down there.
[time=2246] I'm going to call you back up in a second.
[time=2248] Good job.
[time=2249] Yeah, you can take it off and just take it down there with you.
[time=2254] Thanks, David.
[time=2257] It's sad, isn't it?
[time=2259] Two very, very common responses.
[time=2263] Ignore it.
[time=2265] Give it the boot.
[time=2266] God's word says no.
[time=2268] Look at our passage.
[time=2269] God's word says no.
[time=2271] Restore.
[time=2272] If a man is caught in any trespass, you who are spiritual, third option, third possibility.
[time=2278] Restore such a one.
[time=2280] Let's look at that in the time we have remaining.
[time=2281] Let's look at what that would entail.
[time=2283] Number one, even if a man is caught in any trespass, you who are spiritual, restore such a one.
[time=2290] Write it down.
[time=2291] Number one, pick them up.
[time=2293] We're going to describe this process of restoration.
[time=2296] First step in this process of restoring one would be to pick them up.
[time=2303] Pick them up.
[time=2306] Restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness.
[time=2309] When I sin, when I've fallen down under the weight of sin, the first need I have is to get back what?
[time=2317] Up.
[time=2318] To get back up.
[time=2320] And sometimes, most of the time, I need and you need some what?
[time=2325] Say it.
[time=2326] Help.
[time=2327] Thank you.
[time=2329] If you think you don't, you're fooling yourself.
[time=2331] You need and I need most every time.
[time=2334] Help.
[time=2335] Getting back up.
[time=2336] Now, our passage says that those who are spiritual, see that?
[time=2340] Restore him.
[time=2341] Those who are spiritual pick him up.
[time=2344] Basically, this means those of you who are believers and dwelt by the spirit growing in your personal submission to the spirit.
[time=2351] It does not mean those who have arrived.
[time=2354] It does not mean those who are sinless.
[time=2356] It is not the perfect going to help the imperfect.
[time=2359] Those of you who are believers and dwelt by the spirit.
[time=2362] Restore.
[time=2363] Pick them up.
[time=2364] The word in the Greek is caddartizo.
[time=2367] Caddartizo means literally to mend, to help repair.
[time=2370] It meant to set a broken bone or put a dislocated limb back in place.
[time=2376] Did you get that?
[time=2377] Last part, most important.
[time=2379] It meant to set a broken bone.
[time=2382] When he says in Galatians 6-1, restore that one.
[time=2385] It means to set a broken bone, to put a dislocated limb back into place.
[time=2392] My freshman year of college playing basketball at San Francisco.
[time=2397] Early in the year, wanting to impress a loose ball went bouncing across the practice floor.
[time=2402] I, with reckless abandon, go and throw my entire body at it, land on the ball, and then about eight guys land on top of me.
[time=2409] My arm gets caught at an awkward angle, and all of a sudden, when I stand up, my fingernails are brushing against my shin.
[time=2416] My shoulder was completely out of joint, and my hand was literally down behind.
[time=2422] I mean, it was just an incredibly painful deal.
[time=2425] I'm standing there, shrieking in pain, partly pain, partly shock, because my one hand is about a foot longer than my other hand now.
[time=2435] And the trainers, two or three of them, they just come rushing over, and immediately begin to, with purpose and clarity, do what they do.
[time=2443] One guy begins to talk to me, one guy begins to distract me while the other guy does what?
[time=2449] Puts me at a certain angle, and pops my shoulder back into the socket.
[time=2454] Now, just some parallels here.
[time=2457] That, the restoring, the setting of the dislocated joint hurt more.
[time=2466] It was more painful, getting it back in than it was coming out.
[time=2471] And these guys, wow, they were, they were amazing.
[time=2475] Restore, caddartizo.
[time=2477] It's the same thing you see in Hebrews 12.
[time=2480] You can look back there.
[time=2482] Hebrews 12.
[time=2485] Hebrews 12, verse 12, same idea.
[time=2489] Therefore, strengthen the hands that are weak, and the knees that are feeble, and make straight paths for your feet,
[time=2498] so that the limb, which is lame, may not be put out of joint, but rather be healed.
[time=2505] Pick them up.
[time=2508] It meant to set a broken bone or put a dislocated limb back into place.
[time=2513] What have we seen so far?
[time=2515] You, you who are fellow believers.
[time=2517] You are to restore, iron to restore, pick them up.
[time=2520] How?
[time=2523] Put it back on, Dave.
[time=2525] Would you, and then come on back up here.
[time=2527] How?
[time=2528] Just come up here and stand next to the podium.
[time=2530] Okay, you're, you're in the game.
[time=2532] We're going to try and do this restoration thing.
[time=2534] You realize the importance of it, and so do I.
[time=2537] So sin has come, I'll take the boot, put that thing over your neck there, and go ahead and get on back down the ground.
[time=2542] Sin has come and knocked a brother down.
[time=2549] Sin has come and knocked your wife down, or your husband.
[time=2552] Sin has come and knocked a friend down.
[time=2554] And it's a heavy weight.
[time=2557] And God's word says, "Come and cut our tizzo.
[time=2560] Pick him up.
[time=2561] Help restore." How though?
[time=2565] Well, too many times you'd, and I'd do it like this.
[time=2572] What are you doing?
[time=2574] Good night.
[time=2575] Here, get up.
[time=2576] Get up, man.
[time=2583] And we do it literally like that.
[time=2586] We do it in the way that we say the words.
[time=2589] We do it in the letters we write.
[time=2591] We do it in the emails we send.
[time=2593] But as we deal with the one, going back down, yelling, yanking doesn't seem to be the picture here.
[time=2602] Galatians 6-1 uses a great phrase.
[time=2604] You can see it right there in our passage.
[time=2606] Galatians, Spirit-led life is not you saying some prayer and cruising through life.
[time=2613] You understand the Spirit-led life is a life of conflict.
[time=2617] Because it is in constant combat with the old ways of the flesh.
[time=2623] The old ways that continue to tempt and seduce the believer.
[time=2627] The flesh sets its desire against the Spirit and the Spirit against the flesh.
[time=2631] Note this, that the flesh, the term that Paul often uses to describe what remains of the old man.
[time=2640] It's a powerful, powerful picture, and it is just that.
[time=2643] It is the term in the Greek that Paul and others use to describe what remains in you and what remains in me.
[time=2649] It's the part of you and I that doesn't get redeemed.
[time=2654] It's our humanness.
[time=2656] Our souls are redeemed, our spirit is transformed, we're given new hearts.
[time=2662] That all resides in a very fleshly human what?
[time=2667] Body.
[time=2670] Thus the conflict.
[time=2673] Thus the challenge.
[time=2676] Thus the battle that rages in your life and mine.
[time=2681] Paul knew about it.
[time=2682] Remember back in Romans 7?
[time=2684] You can write that down.
[time=2685] Romans 7, you can read the whole chapter.
[time=2687] And I encourage you to.
[time=2689] Read the whole chapter tonight.
[time=2690] I do the things I hate.
[time=2693] Remember that part?
[time=2694] He's talking about the turmoil and the conflict.
[time=2697] The very things I want to do, I don't do.
[time=2699] The very things I do, I don't want to do.
[time=2701] He says he sees the law of sin at work and his members.
[time=2704] And as you read through 15 to 28, it just drives him nuts.
[time=2708] The conflict, the battle, it's so intense.
[time=2713] You ever feel that?
[time=2716] Do you?
[time=2717] You ever feel incense that?
[time=2719] I do.
[time=2724] But I don't mind letting you into another window of my own life and experience.
[time=2728] Because I don't think it's any different than a lot of the windows in your own.
[time=2733] You know what for me?
[time=2735] Not only in this arena, but oftentimes it seems like it comes in waves much stronger in this arena.
[time=2742] And I'll just tell you, you know, I live a very public life.
[time=2746] You would understand that.
[time=2749] Do you have any idea what it's like sometimes?
[time=2751] And again, maybe you've experienced this too.
[time=2753] Public or pride.
[time=2755] Sometimes when I'm away, do you ever get absolutely just?
[time=2760] You ever feel like the enemy's just loading up both barrels on you?
[time=2764] When you find yourself in situations when you're away?
[time=2769] I'll be walking through an airport somewhere.
[time=2773] Tired, weary from wherever I've been or whatever I've been doing.
[time=2777] And it just hits me like a wave.
[time=2781] You're alone.
[time=2784] Nobody here knows you.
[time=2788] Nobody would ever know.
[time=2790] Nobody will ever see.
[time=2794] And you think, good night, I'm just trying to get to the gate.
[time=2797] But we're going to do battle, huh?
[time=2801] You understand that?
[time=2802] You're never safe.
[time=2804] You're never outside the enemy's scope.
[time=2808] He's got you sighted.
[time=2811] And he will go to great lengths to bring the battle to your doorstep.
[time=2816] Whether you're home with family or friends or whether you're out and about on your own.
[time=2822] Thousands of miles from home where nobody knows you.
[time=2826] It is an intense raging battle.
[time=2830] Important to remember that this conflict rages in the hearts of the saved.
[time=2834] This conflict rages.
[time=2835] This war goes on in the hearts of the saved.
[time=2838] The fully surrendered.
[time=2840] Let me explain.
[time=2841] The flesh is that part of a believer that functions apart from and against the Spirit.
[time=2847] It stands against the work of the Spirit in the believer's new heart.
[time=2852] Listen, the unsaved, and you're here this morning.
[time=2856] And you know that we're thankful that you're here this morning.
[time=2859] You're seeking.
[time=2860] You're still trying to wrestle with this whole faith thing in relationship with a living God.
[time=2865] And as somebody who hasn't come to that point yet, you might very well identify with this because it's true.
[time=2872] The unsaved person often regrets.
[time=2877] Yeah? The unsaved person often regrets the sinful things he or she does because of guilt and/or painful consequences.
[time=2885] But he or she has no spiritual warfare going on within him because he has only a human nature and his void of the Spirit.
[time=2894] The sinful things he does though often disappointing and even disgusting to him or her are nevertheless consistent with his or her basic nature.
[time=2904] Someone far from God.
[time=2908] He therefore has no real internal conflict beyond whatever conscious may remain in his sinful state.
[time=2914] It is only in the lives of believers that the Spirit can fight against the flesh because it is only in believers that the Spirit dwells.
[time=2925] Paul shows us next and we'll wrap this up.
[time=2927] Paul shows us next that when obedience to the Spirit when a yieldedness to the Spirit, you understand that, right?
[time=2936] That is an ongoing activity in the life of a believer.
[time=2940] It is a daily constant readiness to be yielding yourself, submitting yourself, coming under the direction and power and guiding influence of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2952] And I ought to be having that conversation often as the day goes by.
[time=2959] Paul shows us next what happens when obedience to the Spirit isn't chosen.
[time=2964] And most of you know what happens.
[time=2966] The flesh will run its course and the results are deadly, tragic and painful.
[time=2971] Look at verse 19, "Now the deeds of the flesh are evident which are immorality, impurities sensuality, idolatry sorcery, ennities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions, envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these."
[time=2990] Then he gets serious.
[time=2992] "Of which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you," he must have done that also in the past, "just as I have forewarned you in the past, that those who practice such things,"
[time=3004] Write down in your Bible that Revelation 21, 8, Revelation 21, 8, that those who practice such things might not, probably won't, shall not inherit the kingdom of God, those who practice.
[time=3026] Make a note there that there is a difference.
[time=3028] Please understand this morning there is a difference between practicing.
[time=3032] If we were to break that phrase down, you might want to write these things down as well, marked by, characterized by willingly and readily given to.
[time=3042] The one who practices those things is the one whose life, whose overall pattern of living is marked by those things.
[time=3049] A willingness and a readiness of the heart to give oneself freely to those things, a person is characterized by those things.
[time=3059] That person, God's word says, isn't saved.
[time=3063] God's word says that person will not inherit the kingdom of God, but please understand this morning that there is a difference between those who practice and those who struggle.
[time=3072] Can I hear an amen on that?
[time=3075] Boy, thanks.
[time=3079] A difference between those who practice those things and those who struggle.
[time=3085] There is a difference.
[time=3087] Two things about that list.
[time=3089] Let me just draw your attention.
[time=3090] Look at that list again, 19 to 21.
[time=3093] Just look at it.
[time=3095] It's ugly.
[time=3097] Really ugly.
[time=3100] You can read down through those.
[time=3103] You can read down through those like I can read down through those and your mind just goes, you know, it goes rushing back years.
[time=3110] Sometimes months, sometimes weeks, sometimes days, sometimes hours.
[time=3118] Look at that list.
[time=3121] Two things about that list.
[time=3123] And I'm going to ask you to be honest.
[time=3126] And I'm going to just stick with what I just said, okay?
[time=3128] Look at that list.
[time=3131] People, that list this morning either describes your pattern.
[time=3139] It either describes your practice.
[time=3143] And if in fact it does, you're in trouble.
[time=3148] You need help.
[time=3151] And help is offered.
[time=3154] Or it describes for you like it does for me, your struggle.
[time=3162] And if in fact it does, describe your struggle.
[time=3167] We're in trouble.
[time=3169] And we need help.
[time=3171] And we need encouragement.
[time=3173] We need accountability.
[time=3175] And yes, we need to be active, not passive, but we need the support.
[time=3181] We've got the prodding and the reminding and the convicting work of the Holy Spirit within us.
[time=3187] We've got the Word of God reminding us which way to go.
[time=3192] And I hope that you've got the people of God around you living life in close relationship with you,
[time=3199] helping move and push and pray and encourage and remind.
[time=3204] But there's two things about that list.
[time=3206] You have the ability to describe your practice and if that's the case, we need to talk.
[time=3211] You and a good trusted friend need to talk or it describes your struggle, in which case we need to keep at it.
[time=3219] Look what begins to take place when you evidence an ongoing readiness to be filled with led by and surrendered to the Spirit.
[time=3226] Look what new patterns begin to show themselves.
[time=3229] Look what takes place in the life of a truly saved, fully surrendered believer.
[time=3235] But the fruit, verse 22, there it is.
[time=3237] The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.
[time=3246] Against such things, there is no law.
[time=3249] Now, it doesn't happen like that.
[time=3252] This is not saying that these are instantaneous.
[time=3255] These are saying that these are the patterns that begin to be evidenced in the life of one whose heart and life have truly been redeemed.
[time=3263] The fruit of the Spirit.
[time=3266] When you evidence an ongoing readiness to be filled with led by and surrendered to the Spirit.
[time=3275] Hear that one more time.
[time=3277] Make that your prayer.
[time=3279] Make it your thought right now.
[time=3282] Just hear those words filled with.
[time=3285] Say it.
[time=3286] Filled with.
[time=3287] Say it again.
[time=3289] Led by.
[time=3291] And surrendered to.
[time=3294] Say it again.
[time=3295] Filled with.
[time=3297] Led by.
[time=3298] And surrendered to.
[time=3301] Write it down.
[time=3302] Keep praying that.
[time=3303] Keep asking that, oh God, that you would fill me with your Spirit.
[time=3307] That your Spirit would lead me.
[time=3310] And that I would be surrendered to its leading.
[time=3314] And when you do that, those things begin to show up.
[time=3318] The fruit of the Spirit.
[time=3320] When I read the fruit of the Spirit, a bunch of stuff pops in my head.
[time=3323] I'll just mention one to you.
[time=3327] When you look at the fruit of the Spirit, what I see is a complete, others-centered mentality.
[time=3335] I mean, you look at them, there isn't anything about you or me in the fruit.
[time=3343] It's all about them.
[time=3345] It's all about your wife.
[time=3349] It's all about those you live with.
[time=3350] It's all about them and it's not about you because you're taken care of in him.
[time=3355] Needs are met.
[time=3357] Satisfaction.
[time=3359] Experienced.
[time=3361] Spirit-filled living, surrendered living, life lived and the Spirit is never about me.
[time=3366] It's always about you.
[time=3368] And my hope this morning is that you know a little bit of what that looks like.
[time=3373] Now I hope that as you leave this place today, you'd maybe look at those two lists that you might even write down on a couple of separate cards, the deeds of the flesh and the fruit of the Spirit.
[time=3384] And that you might look at those daily for the next week or two.
[time=3388] You might on a daily basis say, "God, please, Spirit of God fill me.
[time=3393] Lead me.
[time=3394] Give me the strength to surrender myself to these." And say them by name.
[time=3400] List them out.
[time=3401] Say it back to him.
[time=3402] And God, I pray that you would move me and my heart away from these.
[time=3406] And that you would look at that list as ugly and as scary and as painful as it is.
[time=3412] And that you would be willing to honestly in your mind before God.
[time=3416] Be honest about where those things lead.
[time=3419] Who those things hurt.
[time=3422] What those things damage and scar.
[time=3425] And that you would day after day after day along with me, beg God and the Spirit of God to come and fill you.
[time=3432] Lead you and direct you.
[time=3434] And that you would be surrendered to the Spirit of God.
[time=3437] It is a war, people.
[time=3438] It is an absolute battle.
[time=3440] Fight it.
[time=3441] Fight it hard.
[time=3442] Fight it strong.
[time=3443] Hold on to somebody.
[time=3446] Get two or three.
[time=3447] Don't go it alone.
[time=3450] Would you stand and we'll pray and get on out of here.
[time=3455] Father, what a privilege it's been today to be in this place.
[time=3460] To be led into your presence by passionate, optimistic, loving students whose commitment to you is great.
[time=3470] Whose love for this family is enormous.
[time=3473] God, it's an absolute joy to be with them in your presence and to lift those praises, those songs of truth.
[time=3481] And God, as we look to your Word, we thank you for its relevance and its power.
[time=3485] And I pray, God, that if there's anybody here this morning that needs to better or more clearly understand what it means to be yielded to, surrendered to you initially.
[time=3499] And then to even understand after that what it means to live and walk and the power of the Holy Spirit, God, that we could talk with them, that they would talk with a good friend, a believing friend who they trust.
[time=3511] And God, for those who are here this morning already convinced but struggling, facing all the arrows and all the bombs and all the weapons of war that the enemy brings daily, moment by moment.
[time=3525] God, I pray that we would seek shelter and safety, not in our own strength, but under the umbrella of grace and strength and power found only in the Spirit of God, that we would be completely yielded, wise in where we go and what we do.
[time=3544] Father, give us strength for the battle and we'll look forward to being together again soon. In your son's name we pray. Amen.
