[time=430] (Applause)
[time=438] As your two newest teaching pastors make their way to the stage, would you just thank God for them (Applause) What he has done in bringing these guys into this position Again, we are so very thankful If you read your letter last week you know that the elders just in a And I think what was a very, very timely move and something that will benefit Everybody involved have designated Steve the old guy and Mitch the bald guy
[time=473] (Laughter) And here I am the tall guy They have designated these guys and identified them for what they are And that is they are elders, they are leaders, they are shepherds And they have a gift and a passion to communicate and they do it well And they have the elders and as we talked about all this They have been willing to begin to share just a bit of that teaching load And that allows me to do other things that I really enjoy doing as well I enjoy being here with you on a regular basis and will continue to be By and large, but the opportunities that they will have Will allow me to take advantage of other opportunities within our family here Allow me to do things that I enjoy doing And so I am so thankful For the elders and their willingness to go in that direction And so thankful that Mitchell is here And that Steve is still here I am so glad I didn't wear the suit You know if I had worn the suit in time man Gee whiz You want to hear the story?
[time=531] No, I don't want to hear the story I just want to take 20 seconds If I had worn the suit I would never hear the end of it from YouTube I know, I know I had the short sleeves shirt And my closet alone in my hands And I thought Cali went to a wedding yesterday He'll have that suit on Then I realized Yeah, a new fashion state with that wedding I heard about that I wore shorts And Steve always is looking good at jacket and tie I know, I know Well anyway, it's great to be with you this morning The three of us are here because it is time to Wrap up our series in Galatians And if you've been around the last 12 weeks You know that we have had a phenomenal time Let God's Word, week after week And seeing what he has for us What he has had for us As Paul writes this letter to the churches In the Galatian region And again, if you've been with us Most of those weeks, maybe all of those weeks You know that there was a Central driving theme to this study There was a central purpose That Paul had as he writes Inspired by God Under the direction of the Holy Spirit He writes to correct a wrong A tragic thing had started to take place And you know, because we've spent so much time Talking about it, that the gospel The gospel of Christ, the truth The gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ That those in the Galatian region Had initially heard from Paul himself They were beginning to wander away from that gospel Back toward a ritualism Back toward an external deal Back toward a works-based Religious approach Which you know and I know As we've studied through this and as we've talked about it You know that that's not the ticket Paul had so carefully and so Diligently given them the true gospel So he writes now in Galatians To begin to try and remind them And restore them to this path of truth And so that's been our study And as we went through that We gave you a chance in the last couple of weeks To just maybe send in some questions Maybe some things that we didn't hit Some things that we tried to hit But maybe didn't hit to your satisfaction You still had some questions Or wonderings about this or that truth From the book and so as you wrote in We kind of put those down this morning The three of us are going to try our best To just work our way through these questions From our series in Galatians Okay, you want to get your pins out?
[time=671] You can follow along Take a few notes Make a few notations there The first question I'll get us going here The first question I believe had to do with The difference between Galatians Or no, actually how can I get the spirit?
[time=685] That's right How can I get the spirit to Or let him produce more fruit in my life?
[time=692] Great question Somebody writes in and wants to know Hey, about this whole spirit thing How is it that I can get the spirit to Or let the spirit produce more fruit in my life?
[time=704] What was the fruit?
[time=706] Remember Galatians 5 Go ahead and open your Bibles there Galatians 5 I think it picks it up there in about verse 22 Galatians 5 22 says But the fruit of the spirit The evidence of a life that's being lived Yielded to and submitted to The influence of the Holy Spirit The fruit of the spirit is love Joy, peace, patience, kindness Goodness, faithfulness, gentleness Self-control, against such things There is no law, the person writes And how can I get the spirit to produce more of those things in my life?
[time=742] Well, let me just keep reading for you Look what it says there Now those who belong to Christ Jesus Have crucified the flesh Those who belong to Christ Jesus Paul says have crucified the flesh With its passions and desires If we live by the spirit Let us also walk by the spirit A couple of things come to mind The question reminds you, I'm sure, as it does me That the spirit is very willing and ready To produce in your life and mind more fruit But that's a two-way deal That isn't something you just ask for And he just does all on his own No, it is a partnership And as he is willing and ready To move you toward life and the spirit You and I have to be crucifying the flesh Three things to write down Let me just run these by you These are helpful things for me in my own daily life I think they would be helpful things for you as well As you think about a life Further yielded to the spirit And further removed from the flesh Write these things down The Word of God The Word of God, we say this a lot around here These three things, you hear it everywhere you go around here The Word of God Write that down How willing and ready are you And how willing and ready am I To put myself in a position daily Be it by myself or with a group of guys Or here as the family gathers How willing are you And how ready are you To put yourself in positions to have the truth The life changing Eternity altering truth of God's word Deposited into your life How serious do you take that?
[time=842] How willing are you to participate In having the Word of God Deposited into your soul And into your life and into your mind The Word of God The Spirit of God Write that down The Word of God The Spirit of God The Spirit of God How willing, we talked about this Two, three weeks ago How willing are you And how willing and ready am I To honor daily Sometimes hourly Sometimes moment by moment basis Allow the prayer to him To beat God help me Please guide me Lead me Guide me Lead me Guide please Give me the courage And strength to live This moment right here Submitted to the Spirit of God How willing are you and I To honor moment by moment basis Young men, young women, students Young adults, moms, dads Everybody else On a moment by moment basis To be praying prayers of Yieldedness and submission To the Spirit of God And the people of God Write that down The Word of God Will you give yourself to that?
[time=910] The Spirit of God Will you yield yourself to that?
[time=913] The people of God Will you open yourself to them?
[time=917] You are willingness in mind To live life alongside another Or two or three An open, honest, transparent community Saying to them Them saying to you You saying to them I need your help desperately To remind, to come alongside Your willingness in mind To allow the Word of God And the Spirit of God And the people of God To do what they were Designed to do Allows you and I a chance To see the Spirit produce in us More and more fruit Give that some thought Next question has to do with Sometimes a confusing issue And it's to do with choice Or will. Since I notice Blackhawk seems to emphasize That man has free choice Please explain how Galatians Distinguishes between Free will versus free choice Well, to answer the question Simply, we see free will And free choices Being the same things Right after God creates man You see him given choices To man Adam and Eve have choices And then we look at Joshua 24 15, which I think is coming up On the screens, but if serving The Lord seems undesirable to You, then choose for yourselves This day, choose for yourselves This day, whom you will serve Whether the gods your forefather Served beyond the river Or the gods of the amorites And whose land you are living But as for me and my house We will serve the Lord.
[time=1014] Jesus says in Matthew 11, 28, and 30 And I'm reminded Jesus also says There's no way about it You can't serve two masters And if you're in that situation Today, where you think you're Trying to serve God and you're Trying to serve yourself Or you're trying to serve God And you're trying to serve your Job And somehow it's just not Going together for you And we're going to address that A little bit later here today But think about this verse Think about these words of Jesus I've just spent a couple years Intimately with these three verses Come to me You can choose to come to Jesus Come to me All you who are weary and burdened This is where Paul gets the idea Those are people who are weary And burdened with legalism And I will give you rest And rest means vision Hope rejuvenation Purpose in life Take my yoke Take the yoke of Jesus Upon you and learn That involves changing And growing and learning At the feet of the teacher For I am gentle and humble in Heart In which you just hold down That for a second The God of the universe Comes to this earth in the flesh And he says I am gentle And humble in heart I give choices I give choices And you will find rest for your souls Your mind will in your emotions Your entire inner being is your soul Your mind your will your emotions For my yoke is easy And my burden is light Well also in one of the most beautiful passages In scripture I think In Deuteronomy 30 You have God speaking through Moses And he says Now what I am commanding you today Is not too difficult for you Or beyond your reach It's not up in heaven So you have to ask Oh man who's going to go up there And then bring it down for us And it's not beyond the seat We're going to say who we're going to send over there And then come back and give it to us So we can do this So we can say yes to these choices No The word is very near you It's in your mouth It's in your heart So you may obey it Jesus calls us a kingdom of the heart It's within you This day I call heaven and earth As witnesses against you That I have set before you Life and death Blessings and curses And they're one of the most beautiful verses Now choose life Now choose life Choose life It's by grace It's by the grace of the cross of Jesus Christ That you can choose life And you might say why Why does he do it that way?
[time=1188] Well Jesus was asked this in a way In a question I'm going to talk about in a couple weeks And it's what Jesus, what does this whole thing hinge on?
[time=1196] If I want to make choices What do I base all my choices on?
[time=1200] And Jesus says it's really simple Love God and love others as yourself See first John 4-8 says God is love And because God is love he creates Go back to Genesis 1-1 He loves you And all he asks All he asks is that you love him in return And Paul writes Romans 4-5 that's not a work That's not what I'm talking about when I say work Love God, it's planted in you John 1-9 says That God has given us all a spirit He's given us a life in the spiritual realm That we can either choose God It's only because of that grace That we can choose God and have life eternal and life abundant Or we reject God Love God the day Love God the day and learn how to worship God With your life Before I get to the next question I just want to tell you how famous some people are I was, uh, Nancy and I got a chance to go to Africa Last week, a couple weeks ago And I was asked if I knew four people John MacArthur Chuck Swindall David Jeremiah And Dave Kistler That's good company, Kistler I'm really impressed Next question was Given that we are no longer under the supervision of the law What does it mean that we should keep the Sabbath holy In light of Galatians 325?
[time=1291] Let's read Galatians 325 Now that faith has come We are no longer under the supervision of the law Well thank the Lord for the law Because if he hadn't given the law He did two things in the Old Testament He set the people apart So that they could understand and have relationship with him His chosen people He gave them the law And made them totally other than everybody else on the planet As they kept the law And they had a relationship with him That's one thing that he did with the law in the Old Testament The second thing that he did Was that he used them as a light So that the rest of the world would look and see and say Wow, why are they getting blessed like that?
[time=1337] Well, it's because they had relationship with God Through the law The law had tremendous And then for us The law revealed our sin The law, all the law in the scripture Helps us understand we can't keep it We can't do it And so the law is a tool used by God To reveal my sin to me So that I know the fulfillment of the law in Christ So keeping the rules In order to somehow have relationship with him is out That's been fulfilled through the blood of Jesus Christ Now do I still keep some rules of course I do He gives me rules for a couple reasons, lots of reasons But a couple of them are so that I will be able to express I can, through my obedience, I can express my love to him And there are by-product benefits in every arena of my life
[time=1398] When I keep his law Keep his, the laws that are revealed to us in the New Testament Now, where's the Sabbath fit in this?
[time=1408] I've been thinking about this one since I was six years old Because my mom was a keeper of the law when it came to the Sabbath And Sundays was a day set apart And we couldn't do anything that I liked to do We could do a lot of stuff I didn't like to do But we couldn't do anything that I liked to do And my dad wasn't there And so they had a struggle about that stuff And I'll never forget the first time I really understood it He was taking me to a Cleveland Indians doubleheader with the Yankees And she didn't want me to go She didn't want him to go But she definitely felt some authority over the children And they didn't like it They had a battle with each other But you know what, I went to the game, Dad took me there And I felt free to do that, but I always had this guilt hanging over me Every time I did things on Sunday that she didn't think I was supposed to do I felt guilty about it And so when I was old enough, I started to try to study that Well first of all, let me say this You know, she was really missing the book because she was going to keep the Sabbath holy She was going to quit at sundown on Friday night with me And have me keep the Sabbath till Saturday evening at sundown So we really twist that when we start talking about Sunday Yeah, the church first century met on Sunday First workday of the week at night That's when they met On Sunday, first workday, that's why it's the first day on our calendar First workday, they met on Sunday night So if she wanted me to keep it the way they kept it If that was, you know what I mean, it really gets fuzzy So I started studying the scripture about it And Mark chapter 2, Jesus dealt with it He said, remember the disciples were walking through the fields And they were plucking some grain off and eating it And some of the Pharisees were there and they said, don't you do that on the Sabbath That's a lot, you can't do that on the Sabbath And Jesus said to them, don't you remember David and his guys When they ate and the priest gave them food on the Sabbath And he said also, just let me remind you of this, Mark chapter 2 says The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath That's free, let's look at Hebrews chapter 4, I think that was going to be on the screen Hebrews chapter 4 verse 8 says, "For if Joshua had given them rest He would not have spoken of another day after that There remains therefore a Sabbath rest for the people of God For the one who has entered his rest Has himself also rested from his works as God did from his You know what, I believe we're supposed to rest So on Saturdays I just rest up a storm Or I do the kind of work that is rest for me Or I do the kind of play that is rest for me You follow me?
[time=1570] He designed it so that we'd rest and not just be working all the time We need that, he did it for us And then my favorite one that comes to this is Romans chapter 14 In Romans 14 I think that will come up as well I took this one to my mom and at an older age My mom read this and said, "Oh" Romans chapter 14 says, "One man regards Verse 5, one day above another, another regards every day alike Let each man be fully convinced in his own mind
[time=1609] I'm okay with my mom keeping Sunday The way she thinks she ought to keep it And she needs to be okay with me observing Sunday The way I believe in my heart Romans 14 deals with debatable issues 1 Corinthians 8, Romans 14 Powerful passages that anybody that's been trapped in legalism Needs to grab hold of this principle If it's debatable, if it's not absolutely right Give freedom to the other person And do what you believe is right in your heart But give them freedom and liberty and let them enjoy it So I'm letting my mom stay home every Sunday She can do that the rest of her life And just sit and pray But I'm not going to do that and she needs to give me freedom To enjoy Sunday the way I do Good stuff Next question Please describe the difference This person writes in Please describe the difference between Galatians 6 and 1 Corinthians 5 How are we to differentiate in our approach to the two that are in sin The two different individuals referred to here Go ahead and go back to Galatians 6 We were just there last week Let's just look at that real briefly Great question This person is just wanting to be clear Because as you read Galatians 6 And then as you look back to places like 1 Corinthians 5 and Matthew 18 Which we will hear shortly There's some things you have to understand Or it could be confusing Remember last week we talked about What happens when we come alongside And we come along someone, a brother, a sister, someone in the family Who has been caught in a trespass Remember we looked at that and we are too God's word called us last week to go And come alongside and pick them up To pick them up to hold them up To build them up It's that whole thing there in Galatians 6 Even if a man verse 1 is caught in any trespass You who are spiritual You who are believing Restore such a one In a spirit of gentleness Each one looking to yourself less you to be tempted Bear one another's burdens And thus fulfill the law of Christ So Galatians 6 pinks this picture of you And I coming alongside Helping them up dusting off their back Helping them throw away the sin Bearing their burden Up close in personal Restorative action Well now look at 1 Corinthians 5 Go back just a few books Go to the first letter that Paul wrote to that church at Corinth Go to 1 Corinthians 5 We're going to pick it up in verse 9 All right same guy Apostle Paul writing here to the church at Corinth And he says in verse 9 I wrote there seems to have been some confusion About something Paul had said So he says I wrote you in my letter Not to associate with immoral people I did not at all mean the immoral people of this world Or with the covetous and swindlers Or with idolaters For then you would have to go out of the world And Paul didn't want them God doesn't want you and I removing ourselves from the world You remove yourself or I remove myself from the presence In the place that God's given me In the spheres of influence and relationship that I have And those that you have with those Far from God and we lose any chance of being light and salt He said I didn't tell you to not associate with the immoral Outside the world but actually I wrote to you not to associate with any so-called brother If he should be an immoral person If he should be Greek present tense ongoing Continuous action hard-hearted fist in the face of God Saying leave me alone Any so-called brother Any so-called sister Who would be an immoral person or covetous Or an idolater or a reviler Or a drunkard or a swindler Not even to eat With such a one For what have I to do with judging outsiders Paul said you misunderstood me You don't judge outsiders no But you deal with Lovingly yet forthrightly As is seen here With those inside the body Lovingly yet forthrightly For what do I have to do with judging outsiders Do you not judge those who are within the church But those who are outside God will deal with them And then a quote from Deuteronomy Remove, remove the wicked man from among yourselves Go back to Matthew chapter 18 So Galatians 6 says to restore Come alongside, pick up, hold up, build up 1 Corinthians 5 talks about not even eating With such a one And if you go back to Matthew 18 It'll be there on the screen I think for you It's your brother Again life inside the body If your brother sins Go and reprove him in private Love him, love her enough Care enough About the possibility and opportunity For a restorative process To go and to say and to say What are you doing?
[time=1925] Don't do that Let's do what's right Let's obey If you know someone You go to them in private And you say Do what is right Go and reprove him in private He listens to you Good, you have won your brother Verse 16 But if he does not listen to you Take one or two more with you Who love enough Who care enough Not a firing squad It's not a team going to deliver The judgment of those who are holier than thou know This is a loving With hopes of restoring Process where we go one or two or three We beg and we plead and we implore Oh please do what's right So that by the mouth of two or three witnesses Every fact may be confirmed Verse 17 And if he refuses To listen to them And if he refuses to listen to you If he refuses to listen to them Sounds like we might be dealing with what?
[time=1986] A hard or soft heart Hard or soft What do you think?
[time=1990] Hard The fist, the hand, open or clenched Clenched Sounds like we're beginning to see signs Of again the individual Whose fist, the heart is clenched The attitude has gone south fast And there's rebellion And there's a sense of independence And don't tell me what to do And I'm not listening to you And I'm not listening to you And if he refuses to listen To them tell it to the church And if he refuses to listen Even to the church Let him be to you as a Gentile And attacks Gather The idea there being this Tell it to the church You think oh my goodness What are we into gossip now?
[time=2034] No No No we tell it to each other We tell it to the church And we've got to keep working at this But the idea there is to again You do that lovingly You do that with our heart That is breaking because of the sin And the consequences of that sin And as a family then We lovingly plead and implore Whoever would have the opportunity And if he refuses that You treat him like a Gentile And attacks Gather Or a lot of different opinions On that Basically what we see in that Is those in that day Would have wanted For a Gentile or a tax Gather Although they were difficult people Although they represented To those in that culture A degree of pain and discomfort You would have wanted them to You would have wanted for them Repentance We're dealing with a brother So we're not talking about So much repentance Toward salvation But repentance toward what is right So that's why when I find myself In those situations And when you find yourself In those situations With the hard-hearted Fist in the face of God Sometimes they end up losing The one thing that I think sometimes Is most precious in the life Of a believer You know what that is?
[time=2106] Fellowship You know what a privilege To understand what a privilege this is Do you understand what a privilege it is To sit and share a meal And talk about life And kids and struggles And family and this and that And there comes a time when that even gets lost
[time=2132] Now I'll meet with that person I think you should For one reason And one reason only From that point on And that is to beg and plead To beg and plead to do what's right What's the difference between Galatians 6 and this I hope you see it I hope we kind of painted that for you Galatians 6 The person wants to be Restored Galatians 6 Describes a situation Where what we have Is a broken and contrite heart That says I messed up I got caught in a trespass Pick me up Hold me up Build me up First Corinthians 5, Matthew 18 You know what?
[time=2166] Get out of my face I'm not doing your deal anymore I'm gonna do my own thing And when the heart-heart is evidenced God's word is clear There's a process that we need to be willing To pursue To give that some thought Mitchell Next question is a statement Although this is admittedly Not a question I feel that it is vitally important Galatians 3-21 Is one of my favorite Significant doctrinal verses Doctrine means the way things are Doctrine means the way things are Especially the latter part of the verse And here it is For if law had been given Which was able to impart life Then righteousness would indeed Have been based on law It is only by grace through faith In Jesus and Messiah That God bestows righteousness You know the Reformation 15, 17, Martin Luther gets it going October 31st There was an arm that came out of the Reformation that thought You could actually obey All of the law All of the time And if you could Then you'd be in But Galatians 3 here Comes to kind of a crescendo on Paul's part And it says something totally different So let me just read these last verses Of Galatians 3-2 you We just read 21, 22 Galatians 3-22 But the scripture has shut up All men under sin That the promise by faith in Jesus Christ Might be given to those who believe That's a commitment of my soul My mind, my will, my emotions That's what believe is But before faith came We were kept in custody under the law That's a corporate concept He's talking about Jews Slaves who are going to be Free people got a law to help them Learn how to be free And Galatians is about freedom in Christ Okay?
[time=2284] Therefore the law of verse 24 Has become our tutor To lead us to Christ What's the purpose of the law To lead us to Christ?
[time=2291] Steve said it That we may be justified Justified means To be declared righteous Just as if Justification Just as if I never sinned To be declared righteous For you are all sons of God You are all the likeness of God Because of that spirit in me Saying yes to God Through faith in Christ Jesus For all of you Who are baptized into Christ Have clothed yourselves with Christ There's neither Jew Nor Greek Neither slave nor free man Neither male nor female For you are all one in Christ Jesus And if you belong to Christ Then you are Abraham's offspring Ayers according to the promise You see, you might You might think about when Jesus said in John 5 You said you know you look Through the Scriptures You look through those scriptures And you think that in them You find eternal life But they testify to me They testify to me You see this, I've given my life To the study of this But I've given my life to God I heard Joseph stole Stand in front of a small group I was in and said that I've ministered all these years I've passed her churches I'm president of Moody Bible Institute And I've ministered all these years But I want you to know That I have missed God And what a shame And what a wonderful Attitude of humility You see, it's about a humble heart Towards God Peter seemed to get it In the next chapter in John When Jesus' disciples are Desserting him Jesus says, "So what are you Going to do Peter?" Peter says, "Where else could I go?" Because only you Have the words of eternal life God always has been A salvation by grace Through faith, kind of God I just read about faith in Christ You see, my obedience, it'll fall short My wisdom, it'll fall short My love, it'll fall short My leadership, it'll fall short And yes, my faith It even falls short But Jesus Christ does not And so we are to be In that loving relationship With Jesus Christ And we're set for eternity To love God and love others Every day The old law required Circumcision, yet Paul says Not to be circumcised Because they are trying to be Justified by their act In verse 6 Paul says that the only Thing that counts in faith Expressing itself through love If that is the case, if a person Is baptized as a youth Has faith at an older age It accepts Jesus Christ by faith With not being baptized again Be a ritual at that point Instead of obeying a law of gods God says, believe and be baptized In the Bible, it doesn't say In specific that it has to be in that order Help and explain, please Circumcision Circumcision was introduced To Abraham In order that His people, God's chosen people Would be clearly set apart Same kind of thing I was talking about With the Sabbath As part of the law The boys were going to be circumcised To have them be totally different From everybody else on the planet Circumcision as part of the law Helped them Personalize their relationship with God Now, that law was fulfilled As a matter of fact, in Acts 15 They had a debate even about that issue In Acts 15, Peter and James In Jerusalem, Paul, coming back Was trying to convince everybody That the Gentiles don't need to be circumcised Do they?
[time=2545] Now that the blood of Christ has Fulfilled the law Surely they don't have to get circumcised In order to be Christians Which a lot of Jewish people Were asking the Gentiles Who came to Christ to get circumcised Be a part of their fellowship And you know what?
[time=2558] The Jerusalem Council was convinced And they said, you're right They don't have to do that Circumcision was a mechanism To help set the people apart The blood of Christ Saves us And fulfills every obligation That you had in the Old Testament Including circumcision Not needed Now, what's the relationship here Between that and baptism?
[time=2587] Well, I don't know A whole lot of relationship there But I will say this In the New Testament As people were coming to know Christ Every time you see people getting saved there It talks about them then being baptized And in every reference in the New Testament The order is really clear Let's look at one of those Look at Ephesians 4-5 This happens all over the place Ephesians 4-5 says Starting with verse 4, I'll do that There's one body in one spirit Just as you were called to one hope When you were called One Lord, what's the order?
[time=2629] One Lord One faith One baptism That happens over and over again In the New Testament Make disciples Baptizing them then So, we really believe that It is necessary for a person to have faith In order to be baptized In a believer's baptism Now, could you be baptized In some church as an infant Where they're dedicating themselves To teaching you the same things we do When we pray with people up here Of course you could Is that believer's baptism?
[time=2665] No But is it a dedication Using water?
[time=2670] Yeah, that's okay But for us And for what the New Testament says It's very clear Baptism follows faith Baptism follows faith I'll just tell you a personal story I got baptized when I was 15 Backwards once Just like we do it up here I couldn't wait to do it I couldn't wait to get there that night I knew I was going to get baptized I had gotten saved at camp And I just couldn't wait to be baptized A few years later I was ministering in a Grace Brethren Church The Grace Brethren baptized Forward three times I put you all the way under It's good, it's immersion, it's really nice Three times forward And so Renee and I She'd been baptized as well We wanted to be a part of that local body of believers And to be a local member in that church You had to be baptized forward three times To identify with them Well, we'd already been baptized So that was hard So we went in to see the pastor As a matter of fact, what happened was I'd been there long enough That they elected me Deacon Then found out I wasn't a member of the church It was real awkward for them too And so we go in and he says "What's the deal? Why aren't you a member?" And I said "Well, we've been baptized before It's really hard for us to think that we need to get" And he said He said "You know what? We don't know everything We don't know everything We don't know everything about baptism We have chosen as a denomination To make that a distinctive of ours That we're going to baptize three times Forward in the name of the Father In the name of the Son In the name of the Holy Spirit And he said "We'd really like for you to be a part of this local body But we need you" He said "I'm not saying your baptism wasn't a baptism" He said "But why don't you get baptized with us?" And I said "Fine, Renee was having a hard time with that one" This is one of those deals where The leadership of the husband was really kind of tough But I forced her in and dunked her three times So we got baptized Came over here At a board meeting over here A school board meeting with Dave Jeremiah and the board And they were dying to decide whether to hire me or not And they know I came from a Grace Brethren Church Forward three times And one of the guys says "Is there any chance you were baptized once backwards?" I said "Yes, they all went "Yes!" They didn't want me to...
[time=2822] I thought I was going to have to do four backwards this time You know, to re-race the three and get the one I didn't know Now, I don't want to make light of baptism Okay?
[time=2833] I don't want to make...
[time=2834] Because baptism is very serious It's a public, public profession And we do it as close to our understanding What the Word has to say as we can do it here We immerse people The way we believe Jesus was immersed And it's very important And it follows faith It follows faith And what an opportunity to be able to stand before people You know what?
[time=2861] I'd do it some more If I went someplace else and they asked me to do it And I get a chance to give my testimony and be baptized Now, I know that can be a little weird I'm not trying to get baptized over and over and over again But what an opportunity to stand before people And say "I love him" because he first loved me And so I'm going to die and rise again like he did I got an email from a friend
[time=2890] A guy that's really involved here And really gets it and really does well teaching it and modeling it And he said "Mitch, I think we need to address This religion versus relationship concept And we're going to close with this And he's right We have taken the liberty in this series to bash religion And so we want to explain to you what we're differentiating here So I'm going to give you five things And why don't you write them down?
[time=2917] Okay?
[time=2918] Let's be a great sermon, but we only got a few minutes First of all, Christianity originates with God Religion originates with man You make me want to preach it when you do that Number two, Christianity is a relationship
[time=2941] Religion is ritual It's like we've said all along here today Christianity is loving God, God loving me And that love, it's because he loved me first And that love flowing out of me That I do love others, it's fleshed out in loving others You've got to realize this man, don't get into that deal where you think you're loving God But you don't love others, they're together Alright, third thing, I want to put it up on the screen there This is a big deal In Christianity, God permeates all of my life Religion compartmentalizes God It compartmentalizes God in time I'll only pray on these days, I'll go to the service on that day It compartmentalizes God in task Well, I'm with God when I'm praying Or I'm doing the God thing just when I'm reading the Bible Or anything like that Now let me just tell you something, reading the Bible is great Praying is great, going to church is great But they do not save Only Jesus Christ saves Fourth It is such a freedom to have God in all of life Fourth is Christianity is atonement by another I humble my heart to accept that this is grace This is a free gift of the God of the universe And if I don't accept this free gift I'm saying my standards are higher than the gods of the universe Higher than the gods of the universe, higher than his standards You see that?
[time=3036] You see what you're saying to God when you say I will not accept your atonement?
[time=3041] What a fallacy, and that leads to what religion does It's self-attonement and that's pride and that's all about me And that is total denial Total denial of the way things are And finally Christianity is about love, religion is about legalism
[time=3062] A wife and I are having an anniversary coming up on August 4th And I'm preaching that Sunday, can you just imagine that I give her a dozen roses?
[time=3070] And she goes, oh thank you And I go, oh I just did it out of a sense of duty She doesn't want to hear that
[time=3082] She wants me to do it because I love her And that's all God wants That's all God wants We've asked Corbin to come back up I had a moment yesterday, along with God
[time=3098] And I had some Rich Mullins music playing And I was reading Philippiancy's latest book And I'd just come back from Servant of Angelism And a lot of ideas were racing in my mind And I was thinking about you today That we can plan and God is involved in our planning And we can decide how things are going to be But then it's you and it's me And it's God, we're all here And we're hurting In this God thing You may have never said yes to God You may not know God to love Him And then others of you may believe God May believe in God, you're committed to the race But you're hurting Maybe it's your body Maybe it's your finances Maybe it's a relationship Maybe it's your work You know, you're hurting And then I came across this idea You know, maybe you Believe in the God idea Maybe you say you believe, but you really believe in the God idea If you don't love God And you don't love others You've bought into the God idea You might believe in the teacher who's teaching you But I'm asking you today To take Jesus, not the law To take the Spirit of God, not your flesh And give yourself totally to God Do you realize that you are created To have the Spirit of the living God And dwell in you And that in every thought and every feeling and every interaction And in every action that you can actually worship and love The living God of the universe And that person across from you that he created When they yell at you, when they do something different than your expectations are You can still love them and you can still love God And I just want to ask you this as we sing this song I want to ask you this about the wonderful cross About casting aside my pride And about humbling my heart Bowing the knees of my heart I want to ask you this You know I was thinking yesterday That Jesus Christ The whole world builds its calendar Around Jesus Christ B.C. Before Christ A.D. Anodomani In the year of our Lord The whole world Recognizes Jesus Christ on its calendar And all I want to do is ask you right now As we sing this song If you'll think about this one idea Will you recognize him with the day timer of your heart?
[time=3253] Let's sing
[time=3279] This song go re-kind
[time=3287] From my reach escaped I can't go alone
[time=3299] And you can't end on you
[time=3307] God, God Oh, the wonderful cross
[time=3318] Oh, the wonderful cross It's become and die To find that I truly live
[time=3334] Oh, the wonderful cross
[time=3346] All who gather clear My great strong year To bless your name We're the whole world Our own nature and mine
[time=3370] That we're a present
[time=3376] For Jesus Now it's so amazing
[time=3387] It's so divine We meant my soul My life, my own
[time=3404] Oh, the wonderful cross
[time=3410] Oh, the wonderful cross It's become and die To find that I truly live
[time=3425] Oh, the wonderful cross
[time=3431] Oh, the wonderful cross All who gather clear My great strong year To bless your name With your heads bowed, just join me please as we close today, Father.
