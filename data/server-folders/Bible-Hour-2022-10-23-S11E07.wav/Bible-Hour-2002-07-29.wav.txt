[time=183] On a Saturday in June, our church was part of an outreach event to a community here in Fort Wayne.
[time=189] My family and I went to be a part of that outreach and it was an experience like nothing I'd ever had before.
[time=197] I got to be a part of distributing and delivering food and fans and diapers to people who needed it.
[time=205] And I also, as you can see, held babies while people ate.
[time=209] We just had a great day.
[time=211] By the time we left, we all had a story to tell about somebody we'd met or in some way connected with.
[time=217] It was just a great day.
[time=219] The following week, our student ministries had a missions team that continued ministering to that area,
[time=225] kind of a Bible club type of thing.
[time=227] They told stories and sang songs.
[time=230] I wasn't part of that team, but I did get to visit it a couple times.
[time=234] And the first time I visited, I was just overwhelmed with what I saw happening.
[time=239] I watched as one of our students prayed with a little boy there.
[time=243] Another one had her Bible open and just sharing some scripture with a little girl.
[time=248] Before I left that day, I was introduced to a boy who told me that he had prayed that morning and now he was going to be in heaven.
[time=256] It was probably at that moment that my eyes were open to what was really happening there was making an eternal difference.
[time=263] Lives were being changed and many seeds were being planted.
[time=268] You see, for the past couple months, God has been growing within me a compassion for people in my little world.
[time=276] And now it was happening on a bigger scale to the bigger world that I live in.
[time=281] Since that time, we've continued to going to chapalokes this summer.
[time=286] And I have had many opportunities.
[time=288] I've got to do things from play hopscatch with a girl who laughs at the way that I hop to just look in the face of a little girl who has no
[time=297] concept of God.
[time=299] And I got to be the one to tell her about the God who created her and who loves her and who is there for her all the time.
[time=307] It's just been such a blessing to allow God to use me to just be an extension of his love.

[time=409] Why are my wife Linda and I involved in an inner city ministry?
[time=414] Because God called us there.
[time=416] God told us to go.
[time=418] What have we learned?
[time=419] What have we gained from it?
[time=421] Many things, but a primary one is we've learned the joy, the satisfaction of obeying God, of being where he's placed us.
[time=429] Let me back up and tell you my story.
[time=431] My name is Arlen Friesen.
[time=432] My wife Linda and I have been members in this church for a long, long time.
[time=435] Linda's in childhood, and I've been a member for about 20 years.
[time=439] We've had four children.
[time=441] They've all been born here.
[time=443] Four times we've been up in front of this altar dedicating ourselves and our children to the Lord.
[time=447] Our kids have been raising these nurseries about six and a half years ago.
[time=452] God started pushing us, pulling us, prompting in our hearts, saying, "I want you to have a ministry with people who are poor and needy." So we listened, we thought about it, we talked about it.
[time=463] One day about six years ago today, before church on a Sunday morning, Linda and I were talking about that and we stopped and we prayed and we called out to God and said, "God, you need to give us specific direction.
[time=475] You're telling us, spend time with people who are poor and needy.
[time=478] We don't know how to.
[time=479] We don't know very many poor people.
[time=481] We don't bump into them.
[time=482] We don't know how to get involved in their lives.
[time=484] Please help us.
[time=485] Tell us what you want to do.
[time=486] Tell us what you want us to do." That very night was the first time that Pastor Phil Mortensen spoke here at Blackhawk.
[time=494] Pastor Phil is a pastor at Love Church and inner city church downtown here Fort Wayne.
[time=499] Their focus is on people who are poor and needy, physically, financially, and of course spiritually.
[time=506] Pastor Russell Morten invited him to speak and Pastor Phil's message was on this passage
[time=512] right here and others like it and his call was simple.
[time=515] If you feel prompted by God to spend time to have a ministry of the poor and needy, come lend some time to the Love Church downtown.
[time=522] Well, Linda and I looked at each other and we knew right away.
[time=525] This was God's specific answer to our specific prayer.
[time=528] We were so thankful to him.
[time=530] We talked to Pastor Moore, he gave us his blessing to go spend some time to lend our time at the Love Church on Sunday mornings.
[time=537] Well, we've been doing that for six years now and we've taught five, six, and seven-year-old Sunday school classes.
[time=543] For the last three years, we've taught junior high Sunday school.
[time=547] Ironically, those were some of the very same ministries we had here while at Blackhawk on Sunday mornings.
[time=552] God has selected.
[time=553] He's chosen to pick us up out of this body, take us to another part of his body, the Church of our Lord Jesus Christ and serve him there.
[time=561] We've learned a lot.
[time=562] We've been challenged.
[time=563] We've grown.
[time=564] We've learned to be very, very thankful for eyes and arms and for the things we have.
[time=569] We've seen a lot of God's blessing in our life and we're thankful for the opportunity we've had to serve him there.

[time=667] About two years ago, Katie and I were helping lead a small group of seekers.
[time=672] I just opened the Bible for the first time.
[time=675] People were coming to the Lord and talking about what God was doing in their life.
[time=680] We became to be burdened about how we were going to become, if you will, the gospel to the people around us.
[time=689] We had heard about a church who was actually taking teams of people out and doing small, very simple acts of kindness in their communities.
[time=699] In that way, opening a door of trust and becoming known as a church that loved its way into the community.
[time=705] We really liked that, so we started taking our small group out.
[time=709] We take them out every other month and we do just a small act of going down to the Shell Station at Georgetown
[time=716] and washing windshields and filling up people's gas, giving waste and pop.
[time=721] We really liked how that changed the hearts of the people in our small group.
[time=726] We went to a conference and we came back from that conference and we really felt burdened that maybe we could do something in the church like that.
[time=735] About that same time, which was about a year ago, about May last year,
[time=741] I was reading the newspaper one morning and saw some editorials about a play in town, Corpus Christi,
[time=747] and you all may remember that play out at IPFW.
[time=751] And there was a senior who was trying to do a drama project.
[time=755] I named Jonathan Gilbert.
[time=757] And Jonathan was really getting, he brought a really test to the Fort Wayne community
[time=763] and he was being hit pretty hard in the editorials.
[time=766] And a lot of those folks I knew who wrote those editorials.
[time=769] And I felt burdened for Jonathan one morning.
[time=772] And talked it over with some guys in the cadre ministry.
[time=776] They said, "Hey, why don't we go show God's love to Jonathan and his crew in a practical way?"
[time=782] Not that we supported Jonathan or the play or the content of the play, but we think God died for him just like he died for us.
[time=789] So maybe we could show some kind of small act of kindness to them.
[time=793] So we started thinking, what do college students like to do and knowing that they'd have a month of rehearsal to get ready for this play.
[time=801] They would all be together and we thought maybe if we brought them some pizza, we'd take some pizza and some coke over and just let them know we did care about them.
[time=811] Not again that we didn't really agree with the play, but we did care about them.
[time=815] So some guys went over there, took a big cooler full of pop, some cookies and a bunch of pizza.
[time=822] And we met them at the loading dock over at IPFW and met all their casts and their staff and stage crew and just got to know them.
[time=831] And what that's turned into is a friendship with Jonathan where we go out just like we will this week.
[time=838] Every three or four weeks go out for coffee and just talk about what's going on in his life
[time=844] and what's going on in his relationships and it's been really neat.
[time=848] And in all this, I found that I'm changing, God is changing me.
[time=853] And a thing I've been learning is that I've been too utilitarian, that's a big word.
[time=861] I've been making the focus of why interrelationships with people outside the church.
[time=866] Their eternal destiny as opposed to just being there for them.
[time=870] Maybe they're part of a bigger project God has that I may be just one person of a team.
[time=876] And I'm just trying to do now to make my best shot to extend grace and love to them.
[time=881] And if the opportunity presents itself then I'll answer their questions about God himself and introduce them maybe.
[time=888] But he's changing us and the other thing I've been learning is just keep it simple.
[time=893] I make evangelism sometimes into a great big thing when sometimes it's as simple as a cup of coffee
[time=899] and sometimes spent and just asking lots of questions about where people are.
[time=906] [MUSIC]
[time=935] Who has found a tool within me?
[time=941] The world that I've been found in you.
[time=948] But all I can be all you want me to be.
[time=955] 'Cause all I want is more of you.
[time=1001] And all I need is more of you.
[time=1013] 'Cause all I want is more of you.
