[time=59] But you know what it's all about?
[time=61] It's all about giving it right back to the Lord.
[time=64] And that's what we want to do today.
[time=66] We're going to talk about equipping and our gifts and what God has given us and how we can give that to other people.
[time=72] But let's not forget to give it back to the Lord.
[time=74] Let's stand as we worship Him together this morning.
[time=77] [MUSIC]
[time=87] You're in this house.
[time=95] You're in this house no more breaking.

[time=117] You're not being shaken.
[time=122] God is awesome in this place.
[time=129] This is His presence as we sing His praise.

[time=259] I've found where I've been born.
[time=262] I'm a living star.
[time=264] And in this house I will grow.
[time=270] There is power.
[time=272] There is power here won't hear it go.
[time=275] This is Captain's dream, make the world hang on.
[time=282] He's awesome.
[time=288] God is awesome.

[time=859] Often when I hear music like that or other Sundays when the music's so good and the message is so clear, I think maybe we ought to just stop and just think about that for a while.
[time=875] Did you hear what he said? He said how you made me is enough in the middle of that song. And for most people, most people, the whole world has been telling them that there are the haves and the have-nots, the cans and the can-nots, and you either fit in one of those categories, and it's not enough.
[time=903] You need to change. Well, obviously you need to change for the better, but how he made you is enough, and the body of Christ needs you. How you do evangelism, you, how you're able to do evangelism, nobody else can do it that way.
[time=928] How you're able to be equipped and equip other people is only done by you. See that fingerprint up there on that puzzle piece? That's what today's about.
[time=942] Today is about you realizing he made you enough to do the role that he wants you to play in the body of Christ. And without you, the body of Christ is lacking.
[time=959] We need each of us our own peculiar, unique fingerprint and puzzle piece. The body of Christ needs the whole body.
[time=976] How he made you is enough. Don't let anybody tell you differently. My dad liked to fish. I didn't know it then. I do realize it now. Men like to do things because they like toys.
[time=996] And when you start to do adult things, you get bigger toys and you get to get a lot of them, and they like to go to Cabela's and they like to go to the Bass Pro Shop, and they like to go on the websites and look at the stuff they can get.
[time=1012] One of my favorite things to do when I was little was to get my dad's tackle box out and go through that tackle box.
[time=1020] I don't know who taught him. I don't know who first equipped him to fish. I don't think it was his dad, but we didn't really ever talk about that.
[time=1028] I just know his box was full of stuff, and it was all different, and some of it was old, and some of it was newer, and every year some of it was new. That was a fun part.
[time=1040] And he was really equipped to go fishing. He did teach me this. A knife, some soap, and a book of matches.
[time=1054] Every time you go away fishing, you need a knife, some soap. He was clean. I don't need the soap. Dad was clean.
[time=1062] A knife, some soap, and a book of matches in case you need to fire for some reason.
[time=1068] And you know what? In my tackle box, I've got half of his stuff now.
[time=1072] I love looking at those old, I've got a bunch of old lures in there that I'll never use, and they're probably growing in value, and you'll break in steel 'em real soon now that I mention that.
[time=1081] They're not in very good shape, but there's a knife, and some soap, and some matches.
[time=1091] And I'm sure there'll always be a knife, some soap, and matches, because he taught me. He first equipped me.
[time=1099] And I'm guessing when Josh has his own tackle box, it's real when he's had one for a few years, I bet he'll have a knife, some soap, and a book of matches.
[time=1110] You need to be equipped. Yesterday, Josh went on a camping trip. I looked. They went for one overnight. The van was full of stuff.
[time=1120] Camping people, it doesn't matter if it's one night or 30 nights, it's a lot of stuff.
[time=1126] We know what it means to be equipped. We do it in lots of different ways.
[time=1131] God wants to equip you with everything you need in order to be the very puzzle piece and fingerprint that he designed you to be.
[time=1145] He wants to place every single thing in your tackle box that you need to serve him and serve others, and we're not complete without you.
[time=1162] Look at Ephesians 4. Equipped to equip. Equipped to equip. Not equipped to sit. Not equipped to wait. Equipped to equip.
[time=1180] Ephesians 4 start with verse 11. In previous verses Paul calls God one God and father of all.
[time=1197] It was he who gave some to be apostles, verse 11, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers.
[time=1208] To prepare God's people for works of service so that the body of Christ may be built up.
[time=1219] Until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.
[time=1230] Then we will no longer be infants tossed back and forth by the waves and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the coming of craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming.
[time=1242] Instead speaking the truth and love we will in all things grow up into him who is the head that is Christ. From him the whole body joined and held together by every supporting ligament grows and builds itself up in love as each part does its work.
[time=1265] Who does the equipping? Well first it says there are apostles and prophets and pastors and teachers.
[time=1275] You know the apostles and prophets really were necessary that the Bible hadn't been put together.
[time=1280] The Bible wasn't available and God did reveal himself to people to his body through the apostles and through the prophets.
[time=1290] And then with the Word of God pastors and teachers one person really that there's an article in there that makes that really evident when you look at Greek words.
[time=1301] Pastor teacher who is there to equip us. I had Jim Custer when I was 24 and then when I was 29 I had Dave Jeremiah.
[time=1314] And then when I was 32 Rick Hawks and then when I was old Russell and now Kelly.
[time=1326] And several other associate pastors and several other elders in our church and other teachers who had been equipped by someone and by God through studying the Word of God.
[time=1343] And then we're equipping me. So for 27 years I've been in the process of being equipped and that's been an ongoing process.
[time=1356] I've enjoyed that. I'm so thankful for those men of God that studied the Bible and taught me the truth these last 27 years.
[time=1367] I'm grateful for that. So that I may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. That's why they did it.
[time=1376] They cared about me and God chose to use those people to equip me so that I'd be thoroughly equipped for every good work that he has for me to do.
[time=1386] And you've been under the influence of whoever's been teaching you and he's thoroughly equipping you for every good work that he wants you to do.
[time=1397] Who does it? The people who minister the Word. They equip. The ministers of the Word of God. 2 Timothy 3, 16 and 17 is a familiar verse.
[time=1411] All Scripture is God breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.
[time=1421] Why? So that the man of God, you and me, may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.
[time=1430] The Word of God breathed by him. It's inspired. He breathed it into the lives of the people who wrote the words down.
[time=1444] And he did it so that we'd be taught, so that we'd be rebuked when rebuke is needed. The Bible rebukes me, so that we'd be corrected.
[time=1458] The Bible corrects me, helps me go on the right path after it rebukes me to just tell me to stop doing the things that I've been doing.
[time=1468] And it trains us up in righteousness. So we've had pastor teachers in our lives who've been faithful to study it and bring it to us so that we can be thoroughly equipped.
[time=1487] So that my fingerprint can get darker and darker and darker on that puzzle piece that fits into the body life and the body of Christ.
[time=1499] Matureing. Able to teach elders, it says that same kind of thing. 1 Timothy 3, Titus chapter 1, characteristic qualities of elders.
[time=1509] You're looking for the character traits and elders able to teach. That doesn't necessarily mean preaching, but it does mean teaching that you can go to them for instruction.
[time=1522] My dad sat down with me, taught me about that tackle box.
[time=1529] I've enjoyed fishing ever since. I think I enjoy the tackle more than the fishing.
[time=1539] Secondly, why do they equip? Why do the pastors and teachers, the pastor teachers, equip?
[time=1549] To prepare God's people for works of services. It says, look at verse 12, first part of it. Chapter 4 verse 12 in Ephesians.
[time=1557] To prepare God's people for works of service.
[time=1563] That prepare word, when it's used in Matthew chapter 24 verse 21, it's talking about James and John, the sons of Zebedee.
[time=1573] They're sitting there preparing their nets. They're making their nets stronger than they were previously.
[time=1581] You've heard this before. When you weld something that's been broken, it's actually stronger at the weld than it was previous to the weld.
[time=1591] That's what this concept is. The nets are actually stronger in the places where they've been mended than they were when they were first made.
[time=1601] We're broken in our natural condition. God designed Adam and Eve as perfect nets.
[time=1613] And when they chose to sin, the nets got torn up.
[time=1621] And there's a need for preparation on our part. We need to be taught because we're broken in our natural condition.
[time=1629] What most people do on the planet is try to strengthen their naturally broken condition by doing more of those natural things.
[time=1640] And they get stronger in their own way. And they really become more and more selfish.
[time=1647] You know, I've told people this for years. Selfish 40-year-olds become more selfish 80-year-olds.
[time=1655] It's not like they get sweeter in their old age. I bumped into lots of old people that are really nasty.
[time=1663] Because the older you get, the more you become who you are.
[time=1669] And in your natural condition, you're selfish. You might mask it better. You might get really slick at that, but the more selfish you'll become.
[time=1681] But supernaturally, God intended for us to be fixed, to be repaired, to be prepared.
[time=1689] That's what that means. Mended to prepare God's people for works of service.
[time=1694] That same word, that same Greek word is used in Galatians chapter 6 when it talks about restoring us.
[time=1702] Mended. Restore for proper use in Galatians chapter 6.
[time=1714] Why do they equip us so that we'll be prepared, so that we'll be mended, so that our nets will be fixed,
[time=1723] so that we'll be in a supernatural condition rather than a natural condition to do the works of service that God called us to do.
[time=1731] I bought Nancy some golf clubs. When we got married, it was really sad.
[time=1738] The first few months that I was around here with her, it seemed like everybody that met her said, "I hope you play golf.
[time=1746] You know he plays a lot of golf." And I kept telling her, I don't play all that often.
[time=1752] But she got the message, and so she decided, and I decided she should play.
[time=1758] So before we ever got married, I made her a set of golf. I don't make clubs. I put pieces together.
[time=1763] I don't want anybody to think I can forge clubs at home or something.
[time=1767] But I bought all these parts.
[time=1770] And when I got the parts for her clubs, I was really excited.
[time=1774] And we went up to look at them, and they were these nice, true, temper, sensical, steel shafts.
[time=1780] I really liked those because there's less vibration for women, and she really doesn't like to be vibrated a lot.
[time=1787] And there was less weight in those.
[time=1792] And I took them out, and I put them right beside her down to the floor.
[time=1797] And I had her hold her hand down because you measure clubs along the side here.
[time=1803] And Nancy's not 6'3". So my clubs are a different length than hers.
[time=1808] And I tried to fit her just right. And so we measured the clubs, and she started to golf, and she did pretty well.
[time=1815] But she started saying to me, "I saw so-and-so had these other shafts. What are those?"
[time=1822] I said, "Well, those are graphite." She goes, "What's different about those?" I said, "Well, they're a little lighter. I need lighter." I said, "No, you don't." She said, "Yeah, when I come up here and it's heavy in it." So then eventually she hit one, which was a big mistake.
[time=1837] Her friend Carla led her hit her graphite driver.
[time=1841] Well, she has a graphite club now.
[time=1845] And you know what? They're better.
[time=1847] They're better. Because for her, steel shafts were really heavy, and when she got up to the top, it would break her wrists down.
[time=1856] These graphite shafts don't do that to her. You know why? Because she's equipped better now than she was before.
[time=1865] There are hundreds of illustrations about being prepared.
[time=1874] The right instruction with the right equipment makes for a lot of success.
[time=1886] Well, look at Hebrews, chapter 13. Would you please? 20 and 21.
[time=1894] Hebrews 13, 20 and 21 says this.
[time=1898] "May the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, equip you with everything good for doing his will."
[time=1913] Look at that again. "May the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead, our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep."
[time=1930] Equip you. If God did that, he can equip you. "May the God who raised Jesus from the dead, equip you with everything good for doing his will, and may he work in us what is pleasing to him through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever, amen."
[time=1959] He equips us in order that we might do his will. And if we're looking for the opportunities to do his will, the opportunities pop up.
[time=1968] What I find to be true is this. Often we spend an awful lot of time equipping and being equipped, and we don't spend much time looking, praying, begging, being observant for the opportunities that pop us, pop up for us to be servants and do what's good.
[time=1988] I ask teenagers this all the time. Are you looking for the opportunity to submit to your mom and dad, to bring honor and glory to the Lord Jesus Christ and his father in the Holy Spirit?
[time=2003] Are you looking for the opportunities to submit to them because that brings glory to him when you're obedient and you submit and you show respect to them when they're wrong?
[time=2015] They're wrong sometimes. I'd say the time that you worship, one of the times that a teenager could worship best would be the times when they're really been too picky and they're saying, "No, when okay, be all right."
[time=2029] Or they're saying, "You have to when you really..." But when teenagers are looking for the opportunity to do good works, you know what a good work is there, obedience to parents, respect to them, showing them honor.
[time=2044] That brings glory to the Lord Jesus Christ. Are you looking for the opportunities to serve? Or are you constantly looking for the reasons that you can't do what they're asking you to do?
[time=2060] If the reason you can't serve in the body of Christ is because you're too busy serving in the body of Christ, that's okay.
[time=2074] You need to be prepared, you need to be equipped. What's the product? What's the product? Look on there in Ephesians 4.
[time=2084] If pastor teachers are supposed to do the equipping first of all, and then they equip us in order to prepare us for works of service, what's the product look like?
[time=2098] Second part of verse 12. So the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.
[time=2121] Then we will no longer be infants tossed back and forth by the waves and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men and their deceitful scheming.
[time=2130] Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into him who is the head that is Christ.
[time=2140] The body is built up, that's part of the product. The body of Christ gets built up when we are equipped and we serve.
[time=2147] Following Christ is our plan for helping people understand what it is they need to be equipped with, how they can be equipped by that, and then how they can participate in equipping each other.
[time=2166] Following Christ helps us understand about evangelism, about equipping, about how to do exaltation and how to encourage each other.
[time=2174] I really plug it, I just encourage you to sign up and be a participant in following Christ.
[time=2180] It helps us become the body that he wants us to be.
[time=2183] Each puzzle piece becomes defined and refined in order to do its part.
[time=2190] The body gets build up to reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and to become mature.
[time=2196] What's maturity?
[time=2197] Maturity is an ever-increasing attachment and dependence on God.
[time=2204] Maturity isn't a place that you arrive.
[time=2208] Maturity is a process that you're in where you're so dependent on him that you can't move through life without him.
[time=2218] That's maturity, utterly dependent on him, attaining the whole measure, the fullness of Christ.
[time=2231] What you noticed in there, it said verse 14, "Then you'll no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves."
[time=2243] That's a blowfish, it's a really small one, so you can't see it very well, but it's a blowfish.
[time=2247] It's a puffer, some people call them.
[time=2250] Get these little spiny things on them when they puff all up.
[time=2255] If you've ever been in the ocean and seen these, they're really fascinating.
[time=2259] Because when you're not around and they don't know you're around, that is, and you can see them, they're these little fish with real thin bodies and they can dart everywhere.
[time=2270] They're incredibly agile and fast.
[time=2275] When they get puffed up with themselves, they have the same size fins and tail that they had before they were like this.
[time=2289] And if you've ever watched them, it's a sight to behold, because when you get close to them and they're puffed up big,
[time=2295] they have these little dinky fins out here.
[time=2297] I mean teeny, tiny little things, and a little tail that's trying, but the reality is you can go up to those fish,
[time=2305] wave the water in front of them, you can send them any direction you want them to go.
[time=2311] They have no ability to control themselves when they're puffed up with themselves.
[time=2320] We're like that, we're like that.
[time=2324] When I get more and more natural, when I get more and more puffed up with the knowledge that it talks about in 1 Corinthians 8,
[time=2331] the knowledge that leads to me becoming more and more successful,
[time=2341] then anybody around can come and wave me, I'll be tossed by cunning and crafty people
[time=2350] who are moving me around to get me to do the things that they want me to do.
[time=2354] And you know what they tell me? They say you'll get rewards.
[time=2359] You know why they want to give me rewards? Because they get bigger rewards if I get rewards.
[time=2364] That's all that is.
[time=2367] They're very cunning, they're very crafty, and they offer me what comes naturally.
[time=2374] I don't have to think about the things that they offer me long. I want those things.
[time=2380] The Bible says that I can be supernaturally transformed. I can be equipped and get my satisfaction out of a more and more mature relationship with him and serving in the body of Christ.
[time=2391] The byproduct of that is not the stuff that these people are offering me.
[time=2396] It's love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, faithfulness, and self-control.
[time=2403] That's what I get. And I get to be surrounded by that.
[time=2408] They'd like to buy that, but they can't.
[time=2414] Tossed back and forth by the waves,
[time=2422] blown here and there by every wind of teaching, by the cunning and craftiness of men,
[time=2428] and they're deceitful scheming that sounds really, really good.
[time=2433] The rewards are very, very real.
[time=2441] That's what I'll do in my natural condition.
[time=2445] Instead, he says that I need to be a person who's building the body of Christ up.
[time=2452] To reach, that means the same thing as arrive at a destination. To reach unity.
[time=2458] Are you headed for unity? Is unity a destination that you have in mind?
[time=2462] Because that Greek word reach right there.
[time=2464] When it says to reach unity in the faith and knowledge of the Son of God, that means arriving at a destination.
[time=2472] Well, if you don't have unity as a destination in mind, you won't get there.
[time=2478] If that's not a priority to you, but the body of Christ should be longing for the unity that we can experience as each puzzle piece does its part.
[time=2491] Body builders know how to do that.
[time=2494] They feed on things.
[time=2497] They exercise.
[time=2501] I know a guy that was playing Division I football last year.
[time=2504] He was a center at Akron University.
[time=2506] He was six, five, two, eighty because he ate the stuff they told him to eat.
[time=2510] He exercised the way they told him to exercise.
[time=2512] He went from two eighty last fall to two ten this fall when he quit that.
[time=2525] Instead, verse 15, "Speaking the truth and love, we will in all things grow up into him who is the head, that is Christ." When he's really your head and your intent on growing up into him,
[time=2540] you'll become more and more dependent on him, what I was talking about earlier.
[time=2552] It says, "We'll speak the truth and love." That's the product, truth telling, a body built up, equipped, unity, maturity in the
[time=2567] fullness of Christ.
[time=2569] You can have these rewards or you can have that.
[time=2574] And I just want to encourage you to grab that the way people grab hold of the
[time=2580] rewards that they're looking for in this world.
[time=2584] Because we need you.
[time=2589] Verse 16, "From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting
[time=2596] ligament, grows and builds itself up in love as each part does its work."
[time=2605] As each part does its work, the body grows.
[time=2609] The whole body grows and gets built up in love as each part does its work.
[time=2616] Look back there at 1 Corinthians 8 with me, would you please?
[time=2620] I mentioned this puffer fish came to my mind there.
[time=2625] 1 Corinthians 8.
[time=2634] He's really going to talk about the freedom that we have in Christ to not do or to
[time=2642] do things that we personally have convictions about that aren't black and white issues.
[time=2648] That's what chapter 8 is about.
[time=2649] He starts it off this way.
[time=2651] Now about food sacrifice to idols, listen to this.
[time=2654] We know that we all possess knowledge.
[time=2657] Knowledge puffs up.
[time=2660] But what builds up?
[time=2662] Love.
[time=2663] More and more knowledge puffs up.
[time=2665] And I'll just, even more and more Bible knowledge might puff up.
[time=2672] If you're not motivated to know more about him because you want to know more about him, if you're not motivated to know more about the body of Christ because
[time=2683] you want to know the body of Christ, you see some people might want to know more about this because there are certain people in the church that would say, "Wow, do they have a lot of Bible knowledge." There are people that memorize constantly because they want to be known as the memorization king.
[time=2702] Now, be careful.
[time=2705] I'm just telling you about my natural tendencies.
[time=2709] I don't know who those people are, but I'll bet they're out there because those are my natural tendencies.
[time=2719] The man who thinks he knows something does not yet know as he ought to know, but the man who loves God is known by God.
[time=2728] Now, the question is, do you love him?
[time=2732] Do you love him?
[time=2734] If you love him, you long to be equipped with the knowledge that brings you
[time=2740] closer to him.
[time=2743] If you love him, you end up loving the adopted brothers and sisters in your family that you were adopted into.
[time=2756] And together what happens is we grow together.
[time=2759] It's weird.
[time=2760] That passage talks about those ligaments growing each other up.
[time=2764] The body of Christ gets stronger and stronger as each of us is mended by,
[time=2771] first of all, being saved, then being equipped.
[time=2774] And then we are the ones who are able to do equipping.
[time=2777] Who does the equipping?
[time=2778] I said that first, pastors and teachers.
[time=2781] The pastor-teacher does the equipping.
[time=2783] Why do they equip to prepare God's people for works of service?
[time=2787] What's the product of that?
[time=2789] A body built up that reaches unity, that's mature, dependent on him completely.
[time=2796] Then who does the equipping?
[time=2797] That very body that was equipped.
[time=2801] It's a cyclical thing.
[time=2803] And some of those members become the pastor-teacher people.
[time=2806] But others do the equipping other ways.
[time=2809] And my question for you is, how long do you have to be equipped before it's your turn
[time=2815] to do some equipping?
[time=2819] Is there a third grader you can equip?
[time=2821] Yes.
[time=2824] I watched Dan and Jason do that this morning.
[time=2828] They've been equipping fourth and fifth graders all summer.
[time=2835] I watched John as he's the administrator and Dave as they work hard on power equipment
[time=2841] to try to equip men to be better men for Christ.
[time=2847] They were equipped and now they're equipping.
[time=2851] And it takes all kinds of forms.
[time=2853] I watch Audrey as she's busy equipping us by cleaning around here all the time.
[time=2861] By serving in a multitude of ways.
[time=2866] Doing a lot of equipping.
[time=2872] Let's go back to Hebrews and close there.
[time=2874] Dave's going to come up and read for us.
[time=2880] In Hebrews chapter 13 again, think about everything we said and listen to these verses
[time=2887] again, with the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant
[time=2898] brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep.
[time=2904] Equip you with everything good for doing his will.
[time=2907] And may he work in us what is pleasing to him through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory
[time=2916] for ever and ever.
[time=2918] [AMEN] I'll never forget the evening I opened the door of my life to Christ.
[time=2931] I said to him, Lord, I want this heart of mine to be yours.
[time=2935] I want you to settle down here and be fully at home.
[time=2938] He seemed delighted to be given a place in my ordinary little heart.
[time=2942] The first room we looked at together was the study.
[time=2945] Now in my home, this is a small room with thick walls, but it's an important room.
[time=2951] In a sense, it's the control room of my entire house.
[time=2954] He entered with me and looked around, and as I followed his gaze, I became uncomfortable.
[time=2961] Strangely enough, I had not felt bad about this room before, but now that he was here with me looking at these things, I realized there were some books and magazines on the shelves that his eyes were too pure to look at.
[time=2974] There were things on the tables I had no business reading.
[time=2978] As for the pictures on the walls, my thoughts, my imaginations, some of these were shameful.
[time=2985] Red-faced, I turned to him and I said, Master, I know this room really needs to be cleaned up.
[time=2990] Will you help me change it to the way it ought to be?
[time=2994] Certainly, he replied.
[time=2996] I'm glad to help you.
[time=2997] I've come to handle things like this, so he began helping me bring my thoughts under control.
[time=3005] From the study, we went into the dining room, a room of appetites and desires.
[time=3009] Now, this is a large room, a most important place to me.
[time=3013] I spent a lot of time and hard work trying to satisfy all of my wants.
[time=3018] He seated himself for the table and inquired, what is on the menu for dinner tonight?
[time=3023] Well, I said, my favorite dishes, power, money, academic degrees, with fame and fortune as side dishes.
[time=3030] These were the things that I liked.
[time=3033] When the plates were placed before my new friend, I observed that he did not eat.
[time=3037] I asked, somewhat disturbed, Savior, don't you like this food?
[time=3041] He answered, I have food to eat that you do not know of.
[time=3045] My food is to do the will of him that sent me.
[time=3049] He looked again at me and said, if you want food that really satisfies you, do the will of your Heavenly Father.
[time=3055] Put his pleasures before your own.
[time=3058] Stop striving for your own desires, ambitions and satisfactions.
[time=3062] Seek to please him.
[time=3064] That food will really satisfy you.
[time=3067] And there, about the table, he gave me a taste of doing God's will.
[time=3070] What flavor?
[time=3071] There's no food like it in all the world.
[time=3073] In the end, everything else leaves you hungry.
[time=3077] We moved next into the living room.
[time=3079] This was a quiet, comfortable room with a warm atmosphere.
[time=3084] He said, indeed, this is a delightful room.
[time=3087] I'll be here early, every morning.
[time=3090] Meet me here.
[time=3091] We'll start the day together.
[time=3093] Well, naturally, I was thrilled.
[time=3095] I couldn't think of anything I would rather do than have a few minutes alone with Christ in close companionship.
[time=3100] So morning after morning, I would go downstairs to the living room.
[time=3104] He would take the Bible from the bookcase, open it, and we would read together.
[time=3109] Those times were wonderful.
[time=3111] Our friendship deepened in these times of personal conversation.
[time=3116] However, under the pressure of many responsibilities, this time began to be shortened.
[time=3122] Not only was the period shortened, but I began to miss entire days now and then.
[time=3127] Urgent matters would crowd out the quiet times of conversation with Jesus.
[time=3132] I remember one morning.
[time=3133] I was rushing downstairs.
[time=3135] I was eager to be on my way.
[time=3136] I passed the living room and noticed that the door was open.
[time=3139] Looking in, I saw Jesus sitting there.
[time=3141] In dismay, I thought to myself, I invited him into my heart.
[time=3146] He came as my savior and my friend, and yet I'm neglecting him.
[time=3151] I turned and went in with a downcast glance.
[time=3154] I said, "Lord, forgive me.
[time=3156] Have you been here all these mornings?" "Yes," he said.
[time=3160] "I told you I would be here every morning to meet with you.
[time=3163] Remember, I love you.
[time=3165] I've redeemed you at great cost.
[time=3168] I value your fellowship deeply."
[time=3174] He asked me if I had a rec room where I went for fun and fellowship.
[time=3177] I was kind of hoping he would not ask about that.
[time=3180] There were certain associations and activities that I wanted to keep for myself.
[time=3185] One evening when I was on my way out, he stopped and asked, "Are you going out?" "Yes," I replied.
[time=3191] "Good.
[time=3192] I'd like to go with you." "Oh," I answered rather awkwardly, "I don't think Lord Jesus that you would really enjoy or I'm going to go.
[time=3200] Let's go out together tomorrow night.
[time=3202] Tomorrow night we'll go to a Bible class at church, but tonight I have another appointment."
[time=3208] "I thought that when I came into your house, we were going to do everything together.
[time=3211] To be close companions," he said.
[time=3214] "Well, I mumbled slipping out the door.
[time=3217] We'll go someplace together tomorrow night." That whole evening I felt miserable. What kind of a friend was I to Jesus deliberately leaving him out of my life?
[time=3226] Doing things, going places, I knew very well he would not enjoy.
[time=3231] When I returned that evening I went to him and I said, "Lord, I've learned that I am miserable without you." From now on we do everything together.
[time=3239] Then we went into the rec room of the house.
[time=3241] He transformed it.
[time=3243] He brought new friends, new excitement, new joys.
[time=3246] Laughter and music have been ringing through the house ever since.
[time=3252] One day I found him waiting for me at the door.
[time=3256] An arresting look was in his eye.
[time=3258] As I entered he said to me, "There's a peculiar odor in this house.
[time=3263] Something must be dead around here.
[time=3265] I think it's in the hall closet." As soon as he said this I knew what he was talking about.
[time=3272] There was a small closet, just a few feet square in that closet.
[time=3277] Behind lock and key I had one or two little personal things that I did not want anyone
[time=3283] to know about.
[time=3284] Certainly I didn't want Christ to see them.
[time=3287] He pointed to the closet door.
[time=3289] I was angry.
[time=3290] I had given him access to the library, the dining room, the living room, the rec room.
[time=3294] Now he wants access to a little two by four closet.
[time=3298] I said to myself, "This is too much, I'm not going to give him the key." Well, he said, reading my thoughts, "If you think I'm going to tolerate this smell, you're mistaken.
[time=3308] But no matter what is behind that door, I will not leave you to sort it out alone.
[time=3314] Unlock the door." I knew I couldn't do it on my own, so I asked Jesus if he would clean it out for me.
[time=3321] With trembling fingers I passed the key to him.
[time=3324] He took the key, opened the closet, and cleaned out all the putrid stuff.
[time=3329] What a relief to have that rotten stuff out of my life.
[time=3333] A thought then came to me.
[time=3335] "Lord, is there any chance that you would take over management of the whole house and operate it for me as you did that little closet?
[time=3341] Would you make my life what it ought to be?" His face lit up and he replied, "I'd love to." Dropping to my knees I said, "Lord, from now on you are going to the owner and master
[time=3353] of this home.
[time=3355] You run the house and I'll remain with you as a servant and a friend." Running as fast as I could to the strong box, I took out the title deed to the house.
[time=3364] I eagerly signed it over to him alone for all time and all eternity.
[time=3369] Jesus I said, "Here it is, all that I am and all that I have, yours forever."
[time=3375] Now, if you don't mind, would you come with me?
[time=3378] I'll introduce you to some of my neighbors.
[time=3386] And your bulletin is this sheet, "My Heart, Christ, Home." And what Dave just read to you, you can kind of think through as you look at that sheet.
[time=3397] What's your heart like?
[time=3400] As he fills up your heart, he is faithful to empower us that we can be the peace that
[time=3412] he wants us to be in the whole body, the local body here that church represents and the body
[time=3421] of Christ around the world.
[time=3423] Now, get this.
[time=3426] We desperately, desperately need you.
[time=3434] And how he made you is enough to meet the need that we have in the body of Christ.
[time=3444] And when you don't feel like it, it's because somebody's lying to you and maybe it's you.
[time=3452] Now he made you is enough and we desperately need you in the body of Christ.
[time=3461] Please be willing to be equipped and then to be equipping so that the body of Christ
[time=3468] can be complete and mature and prepared for every good work.
[time=3479] You are the only one of those on the planet.
[time=3485] You are the only one.
[time=3488] Lord, help us, please.
[time=3493] We get insecure.
[time=3494] We think we can't do things.
[time=3496] Sometimes we get puffed up and we think we can do too much.
[time=3500] I pray for the balance that we all need to do things your way, to be the fully equipped
[time=3507] person that you supernaturally designed each and every one of us to be.
[time=3516] We depend on you.
[time=3517] We love you and we thank you for your grace and your mercy.
[time=3522] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3537] [AMEN - 30 seconds]
[time=3597] the Lord.
[time=3599] [AMEN - 1 seconds]
