[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=30] (upbeat music)
[time=60] [MUSIC] Oh, my wonderful, I'll never let you know [MUSIC] My savior, my closest friend [MUSIC] I will worship you until the very end [MUSIC] Jesus, the lumber of my soul [MUSIC] Jesus, I will never let you go [MUSIC] Take me from the mighty plain [MUSIC] Set my feet upon the rod [MUSIC] Now I know, I love you, I need you [MUSIC] Though my wonderful, I'll never let you go [MUSIC] My savior, my closest friend [MUSIC] I will worship you until the very end [MUSIC]
[time=167] [MUSIC - 66 seconds]
[time=252] Let's stand together this time as we sing it.
[time=257] In the simplest of all of songs...
[time=267] [MUSIC - 389 seconds]
[time=658] Isn't that again?
[time=659] Oh, the wonderful Christ.
[time=661] [MUSIC - 40 seconds]
[time=705] I love that song because I think it's so true.
[time=715] And then the cross is wonderful.
[time=718] And it's kind of hard to understand and those of you that might be visiting or might not understand exactly what we're talking about.
[time=723] And you think about a cross and that's death.
[time=727] But what we believe is that we have life through that death, through Christ on the cross.
[time=732] We have life.
[time=734] And when we put that cross in front of our eyes and when we make decisions from day to day and the people we come in contact with, if that cross is in the forefront and we can filter all of our decisions and all of our thoughts and all of our words through that cross and through that man who gave his life on that cross, that changes us.
[time=755] And we're different people because of it.
[time=759] I'm going to continue to sing about the forgiveness that we have, "The Blood of Jesus." This song is simple.
[time=767] It's called "Amazing Love." And it says very simply the beginning that we are forgiven because Christ was forsaken.
[time=785] I'm forgiven because you were forsaken.
[time=805] And I'm accepted.
[time=808] You were condemned.
[time=813] I'm alive and well.
[time=815] Your spirit is within me because you were tied in your roles again.
[time=840] I'm forgiven because you were forsaken.
[time=848] And I'm accepted.
[time=851] You were forgiven.
[time=855] I'm alive and well.
[time=858] Your spirit is within me because of the night and your roles again.
[time=870] [MUSIC - 146 seconds]
[time=1024] You are my King. You are my King. You are my King. You are my King.
[time=1147] Oh Lord of light, of form and hue, who has created all things new, creating me from shapeless clay and instrumental which you blame.
[time=1176] But of the dance that planets tread, who walks beside and soars ahead, oh, let me move to worship thee, come away spirit dance with me.
[time=1204] God of the living world, poet of time, teach me your words and your cadence and pride, O Lord of beauty, Lord of art,
[time=1234] who gives a son for every heart, carve out my life, reshape and mould, and be the artist of my soul.
[time=1256] Teach me your words in your cadence and pride, O Lord of beauty, Lord of art, who gives a son for every heart,
[time=1284] carve out my life, reshape and mould, and be the artist of my soul.
[time=1329] Just bow your heads and pray with me, would you Father, that is our prayer this morning.
[time=1345] And as it's been sung there, we're reminded, so many of us in this room this morning, that what goes on in our soul, where we go, what we do,
[time=1354] what we think, who will be, the choices that we make so many times, that pen, that brush is gripped tightly by us.
[time=1367] And our prayer God this morning is that we would each of us in whatever way needed, to whatever extent needed God, that we would surrender again.
[time=1377] Maybe some even here for the first time today, and that we would understand that nobody knows our soul like you, for it was you who created it, it was you who formed it.
[time=1389] And these are souls in this room that were by nature designed to live in relationship with you.
[time=1397] God be the artist, God be the controller, God be the lover, God be the one who moves in and through our souls.
[time=1407] Helping us, moving us in time to be the people that you've called us to be.
[time=1414] In your son's name we pray, amen.
[time=1418] Would you please thank God for the gifts and talents He's given these people to do what they just did for the last 30 minutes?
[time=1432] And we can continue on with this series that we started a few weeks ago, and I'm so very thankful.
[time=1443] So thankful for Mitchell, as you know, and so thankful for Steve, our teaching pastors here at Black Hawk who fill in and contribute on a regular basis.
[time=1455] So grateful for what God has done in bringing them to this place and so grateful that we can take time every year, we do this, we just kind of call a time out, we kind of regroup as a family, and we say, wait a minute, now what are we about?
[time=1470] What are we trying to do with God's help and for His glory?
[time=1475] What are we trying to do? What is the purpose of this place?
[time=1478] What is it that you and me and I mean that you, each one of you, young and old and in between, each one of you that call this place home, what is it that we're giving ourselves to, what is it that we get up for each day?
[time=1492] And so we just take four weeks, sometimes we do it twice and sometimes we do it once, but at least once each year we sit back and we talk about these four things, these four E's, and I want to start with our mission.
[time=1504] And I hope you ask yourself this, maybe you don't ask yourself it very often, I would encourage you to ask yourself this more often, why do we exist?
[time=1515] Why do we come to this place? Why do you call this place home? What is it about Black Hawk Ministries that gives it direction and gives it purpose?
[time=1523] Why is it that these 40, 50 people worked so hard to prepare and to get ready for this morning?
[time=1534] Why is it that week after week so many of us give our nights and our days, our blood, our sweat and our tears?
[time=1543] Why? Why do you come and why do you involve yourself in ministry?
[time=1548] Why do you give in the way that you do?
[time=1552] We exist for the greatest cause of all, it's the greatest thing going, it's the most amazing journey, it's the most incredible ride you've ever been on.
[time=1564] We exist to help seeking people, as the screen says, we exist to help seeking people, both saved and searching, because once someone comes to faith in Christ, the seeking after God never ends.
[time=1579] I mean, we are told repeatedly in God's Word to seek His face, to seek ye first, the kingdom of God. We're doing our very best with His help to get up every day and give ourselves to the process of helping seeking people, both saved and those still searching, find the artist of their soul, the maker of all, trying to help people find and then know what it means to follow Christ.
[time=1607] As we've thought about that, as we've prayed about that, as we've studied the Scriptures in relationship to that, we've come to the realization we've felt a clear sense of leading by God that there are, and in a different place at a different time, it could be four different things.
[time=1623] We have sensed as a leadership that here, there are four things that when you and I and those who give leadership and those who follow when we as a family are passionately given, deeply committed to these four things, we believe that mission has a chance.
[time=1642] God can use us when deeply committed to and passionate about these four things, and Mitchell started out a couple weeks ago, talking to you about evangelism, the opportunity that we have to be good news, the opportunity that we have to share and live out the truth.
[time=1664] Almost 150 of you yesterday did that at a thing we call serve fest, and I've heard nothing but incredible stories about how God used your efforts to share just in small acts of kindness, his love.
[time=1678] Steve came last week and talked about equipping our commitment to be equipped by the one thing that should equip us, and that is the Word of God.
[time=1686] You're willing this to, on the one hand, put yourself in a position to be equipped, and you're willing this in mind to respond to the call with kids, or to lead a small group Bible study, or to do whatever it is you can to make your unique contribution.
[time=1700] It's being equipped and then being willing to go and give that to others in whatever form or fashion.
[time=1709] Encouragement, and then next week exaltation, and this morning I want to just concentrate your thoughts for just a few moments here on this idea, this biblical concept of encouragement, something that we believe, when you're passionate about it, when you and I are deeply committed to this process of encouragement.
[time=1729] Amazing things happen, seeking people both saved and searching, understand more so what it means to find and follow.
[time=1736] Now in the past, what we've typically done when addressing this third E is to talk about the deepened relationship found in community, community.
[time=1745] We've talked about it often, community living and sharing life together.
[time=1748] When dealing with encouragement, we've often talked about the one another's of the New Testament and the importance of accountability, all good things.
[time=1755] This morning, I want to just change it up a little bit if I can.
[time=1761] This morning I want to just kind of back up a bit and maybe simplify.
[time=1768] I'd like us to just look at the word itself.
[time=1772] Would you do that? Would you look at that screen and would you just look at that word encouragement?
[time=1777] And would you be willing this morning to ask yourself a few questions?
[time=1785] Would you an encourager? I'm not talking about by nature. I'm talking about by practice.
[time=1794] Are you an encourager? God's word says we should be and we'll look at that in just a minute.
[time=1801] Are you an encouraging person? Ask yourself that this morning, would you?
[time=1808] Are you an encouraging person? Are you one who has a habit of or is in the practice of and we'll just define it for you here, okay?
[time=1818] Encouragement. You can write this down. To speak words of affirmation and hope into the life of another.
[time=1826] To speak words of affirmation and hope into the life of another.
[time=1830] To extend oneself to another through selfless acts of kindness and sensitivity.
[time=1837] Speaking words of affirmation and hope, extending oneself to another through selfless acts of kindness and sensitivity.
[time=1849] Do you do that? Is that you? By practice is that how you would be characterized as a follower of Christ.
[time=1860] Are you a kind and affirming person? Are you encouraging to your, we'll just get personal here.
[time=1868] And you can write these down if you want to or you can just think and cringe along with me as I did as I thought this through because there's a lot of room to grow in my own heart as it relates to this.
[time=1877] Are you an encouraging person to your spouse? Go and think about that.
[time=1884] Speaking words of affirmation and hope into his life or hers.
[time=1892] Are you an encouraging person to your spouse?
[time=1896] Are you an encouraging person speaking words of affirmation and hope into your kids?
[time=1904] Think about that. Those little angels.
[time=1910] Those precious little things that are growing up faster than you can shake a stick at.
[time=1917] Are you an encouraging father and mother and uncle, grandmother, grandfather to the kids?
[time=1925] Kids who walk around this place and kids who who walk around your homes in desperate need.
[time=1932] I'm not overstating it. Desperate need of your affirmation and your words of hope.
[time=1940] Kids that get up every day, whether 5 or 15, 25 or kids who need your selfless acts of kindness
[time=1951] and sensitivity to them. Are you an encouraging person?
[time=1960] The little ones, the little gifts that God's given you. Are you an encouraging person to your co-workers?
[time=1966] The co-worker. The difficult one, three cubicles down. The unlovely one.
[time=1976] Who's always got something to say. The antagonistic one.
[time=1981] Are you one who's willing to speak words of affirmation and hope?
[time=1988] Extend yourself toward selfless acts of kindness and sensitivity toward them.
[time=1993] Are you an encouraging person? Hey kids, students, wake up.
[time=2000] Are you encouraging to your brother? Ah, sorry. Are you encouraging to your sisters or sister?
[time=2015] Middle school student. Fifth grader, high school student.
[time=2020] Are you willing to speak words of affirmation and hope into the life of your little pesky
[time=2030] sister who bugs and irritates you daily? Little sisters, are you willing to speak words of
[time=2038] affirmation? Might be a big word for you. It means telling them good things about them,
[time=2044] even if you have to stretch it a little bit. You say it. Are we encouraging people?
[time=2052] Are you encouraging toward your friends? You know what? If the answer to those questions is more
[time=2059] often than not yes, then the great thing that we can celebrate this morning is that inside you is a heart that is growing. Do you sense that? Do you sense your heart growing?
[time=2070] Do you sense your heart getting bigger? That's what happens when you use it.
[time=2074] That's what happens when you engage it. That's what happens when you offer yourself
[time=2080] through your words or through your actions to another. Speaking affirmation and hope
[time=2086] into their lives, it grows one's heart, makes it vibrant, makes it big, or maybe you're struggling
[time=2096] on the encouragement front, maybe most of the time, or more often than not.
[time=2105] You're critical. Just look at the words as they come up and you just do a little assessment of
[time=2115] your own heart, of your own relationship with your spouse, with your sons, your daughter,
[time=2123] your friends, your coworkers. Maybe the encouragement thing, maybe the willingness to speak words of affirmation and hope to offer oneself an acts of kindness and sensitivity, maybe in all honesty
[time=2134] this morning before God, it's just not going so well. Maybe it hasn't gone so well
[time=2141] for you and that arena for a long, long time. And maybe you've bought the lie that a lot of us at times are close to buying, that if it's not my personality, if it's not my wiring, you know,
[time=2153] I'm just not a very encouraging person all here at times. No.
[time=2159] God's Word says it's a non-negotiable. How about you? Maybe in all honesty, you find
[time=2170] yourself being critical. Here's one. Impossible to please.
[time=2176] Know somebody like that? Is that you sometimes? Is the room never just, is the room never picked
[time=2186] up just right? Is there always something wrong with the way the job got done?
[time=2194] Is the car never clean enough? And the lines in the carpet just not vacuumed the right way?
[time=2201] Did the game never really get played hard enough or well enough?
[time=2212] Is it just really difficult for you to look at him and look at her in the eye and say,
[time=2219] great job, great job. My dad helped me with this years ago.
[time=2228] And I may have shared this story with you, but it's etched in my mind. Eight years old,
[time=2235] playing little league, center field, had been pitching and had gotten pulled because I stunk
[time=2246] that day. It didn't go so well. So in little league, they just stick you out in the outfield because normally it's not too busy out there. Never forget, my attitude was just horrible.
[time=2258] And I was so embarrassed and so mad that I'd been pulled and so disappointed that the day had
[time=2264] gone as it had gone. And so I went out to center field and took a knee and took my hat off even.
[time=2272] And I'm out there in center field on the bottom of the seventh inning with a runner on second with my hat on the ground pulling grass and tossing grass in my hat.
[time=2280] When I hear that fateful sound, the aluminum bat, right, and it dawns on me a little late,
[time=2292] but it dawns on me. Oh, I think somebody hit the ball and the ball bounces past me.
[time=2297] I'm scrambling for my hat and the grass is falling on my face now and I get to the ball and I try
[time=2303] to throw over. Game's one. Guy from second scores. And I go walking in. You just don't want to make
[time=2313] that walk. You don't want to see your teammates. You don't want to see your coach, but I didn't want to see my dad because he had been, I didn't tell you this, he had been sitting over on the side.
[time=2321] He had this whistle. Do any of you dads have specific whistles that he had this whistle?
[time=2327] It was just he did it much louder and much better. It was with his fingers and I still haven't figured the whole finger thing out, but it was his whistle. And as I'm throwing grass, there were a few times where I heard the whistle and I look up and I see him over there going.
[time=2338] Yeah, whatever. Bing! So I go walking over and I hear it from my teammates and I hear it from my
[time=2351] coach. And remember my dad just walking up to me afterwards. It's a long story for a short little thing, but yeah, he just put his arm around me and just slapped me on the back of the head and kind of smiled. So let's go home. That's it. Let's go home. How about you? Impossible to please?
[time=2370] Critical? Harsh? Oh my goodness. The words that come, not only the words that come out of our
[time=2379] mouths, but the way they come out sometimes. The tone, the pitch, the intensity that so many times
[time=2390] isn't needed. How you doing? Critical and possible to please? Harsh? Insensitive? If this is you,
[time=2402] the sad thing is that not only do you and me more often than I'd like to admit,
[time=2409] if this is you, the sad thing is that not only do you and I leave those in our lives hurting and
[time=2416] discouraged, not encouraged, not only do we leave those in our lives more often than not hurting and
[time=2424] discouraged, but our hearts, your hearts in trouble. Because if it's not growing and getting bigger
[time=2435] and engaging and being used, guess what? It's shrinking and getting hard and smaller and more
[time=2443] calloused. And I don't think, I can't speak for everybody, but I don't think you want to end up
[time=2452] being 40, 50, 60 down the road, hard and calloused, bitter with a small heart that hasn't been used in
[time=2462] years. I'm so grateful. I've told them this. There is a group of people in this church. I just
[time=2472] affectionately referred to them as the wise ones, the 55s and overs. And there's probably some wise
[time=2480] 54-year-olds I realize. But there's a group of people in this church and they have hung around for a long, long time. And they come in here and they sit every week and they're a part of ministry in this place. And preferences put aside, they continue to come and serve and give, be a part of
[time=2496] this family. And they are my great cloud of witnesses. They are my group of Hebrews 11 folks.
[time=2509] And they made a choice at somewhere, at some point along the road. Because I bump into them and I
[time=2515] see them and I get letters and notes from them and they come down and talk to them and you know what? Their hearts are big. Their hearts are full of life. There's gentleness in their eyes,
[time=2524] softness in their touch. Critical spirits continue to be checked at the door and I'm so thankful for
[time=2532] this group of people in our church who exercise their hearts and have refused to allow the heart
[time=2541] to get shut down. And you don't want to do that and I don't want to do that.
[time=2547] So what does God's Word say? Look at Hebrews 3. Go ahead and turn back to the back of your
[time=2556] New Testament to the book of Hebrews. Let's just look and see what God's Word says. What do the
[time=2563] Scriptures say about this call on your life and mind to be a people who speak hope and affirmation
[time=2570] into the life of another, to be encouraging people. We don't have the time to go through an entire
[time=2577] treatment of this as far as even the New Testament, you know, relates to it. But let's just look at a few things. Hebrews 3. Would you look there? Hebrews 3, 13. Hebrews 3, 13 says this,
[time=2593] but encourage one another day after day. But encourage each other day after day as long as it is
[time=2604] still called today lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
[time=2610] To short verse, absolutely packed, absolutely full of great truth for you and I to consider
[time=2619] this morning as you think about it, and as I consider this idea of you and I being encouraging
[time=2626] people, first of all, let me just point your attention to this. Okay, look, just point one.
[time=2629] Note the phrase there at the beginning, one another, but encourage each other. I know this is really
[time=2637] basic, just write down each other. Would you write that down? Just write down each other. What's this mean? Number one, it means each other. Now watch how this works. Sometimes, and I know it's basic,
[time=2649] but please just recognize this again. The Word of God calls you to encourage you. The Word of God
[time=2658] calls you to encourage Him and for you guys to encourage them. The Word of God calls those of us
[time=2666] that call Him Lord in this place home to encourage each other. It's not a hierarchical thing where it
[time=2673] comes from me or the elders and then they encourage them and then they encourage them and then they,
[time=2680] no, no, no, because if that's the case, I don't ever get encouraged.
[time=2686] And people get missed. Look around you. We are to encourage each other.
[time=2693] And it brings up the point, well, I don't really know Him that well. Who cares? Say a nice word.
[time=2702] Speak in a firming thought. Go out of your way. Do your best and grab hold of the fact that
[time=2711] this is a, this is a one another thing. Old, young in between, red, yellow, black, and white,
[time=2718] rich, poor, doesn't matter. Encourage each other. Do it. Say it. Speak it.
[time=2730] The other thing I see there, and you can write this down, number two, day after day.
[time=2737] Day after day. I know people. I know them. And they're laughing right now too.
[time=2742] I know people who would say, hey, wait a minute, I encourage someone last month.
[time=2746] All right? I know folks trying hard not to look at them right now.
[time=2753] I know people who say, oh, yeah, I got that covered. Last month I encouraged somebody.
[time=2758] And then I came back to my right down the middle of the road self because I just say the facts.
[time=2764] I don't beat around the bush with this fluffy stuff. No, I just say it like it is.
[time=2767] But encourage one another day after day after day after day after as long as it's called today.
[time=2781] What's that mean? Every day. You don't have a quotient that you use up one day and then
[time=2789] turn on the encouragement thing 30 days later. No, it is a daily thing. You and them. You and him.
[time=2797] Day after day. It's always, always happening.
[time=2801] Encourage each other. Do it day after day. And here comes the punch right here. Here comes
[time=2810] the meat of this thing. Look at this. Encourage one another day after day as long as it is still called today. Why? What's the point? We say, God, what's the purpose? We see the admonition. It's
[time=2822] clear. Tell us why he tells us why right here. Did you see this? "Lest any one of you be hardened
[time=2829] by the deceitfulness of sin." Do you understand what that's saying? Here's what it's saying.
[time=2837] There are people in your life. There is a six-year-old in your life. There is a teenager in your life.
[time=2844] There is a good friend in your life. There is a spouse in your life. And every day we are attacked.
[time=2851] Every day we are tempted. Every day things come down the pipe. Every day the enemy stands and whispers
[time=2859] in someone's ear. You're no good. You stink. You're awful. You're sinful. You're dirty. You're
[time=2868] unusable. Your past disqualifies you. You're horrible. And sometimes he whispers that and
[time=2876] sometimes he yells that. And we need somebody to stand up and be a voice that says, no, you're not.
[time=2884] You're doing a good job. Hang in there. There's people all over your life who need you to speak
[time=2895] words of affirmation. Great job. Boom. Let's go home. Great job. Well done. And hope.
[time=2904] Hang in there. I can't tell you how many times many of you think me to be a very, very positive
[time=2914] person. And I am for the most part. But you know what? There are days when I sit in that office.
[time=2919] And because of this or that or what got said or what got written. There are times when I think to myself, what am I doing? I can't do this. It's too much for me. I can't handle all this.
[time=2932] It's overwhelming. And an email comes or a note gets written or a head pops in a door.
[time=2943] It says you're doing a good job. Hang in there. Stay at it. Isn't this great?
[time=2950] There's times when I sit with people who are contemplating horrible things,
[time=2958] life damaging future altering things. And they need me and they need you in that booth
[time=2967] at that restaurant or at that table in that kitchen to say to them, don't do it.
[time=2974] That's not who you want to be. That's not where you want to go.
[time=2977] You can do this. You can endure this with this help, my encouragement. We can get through this.
[time=2986] Great job. Well done. Don't do it. Stay at it.
[time=2999] Lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. And we all understand, right,
[time=3005] how deceitful sin is. It's messy stuff. It gets you thinking things. That voice that says you're
[time=3014] no good. That voice that says you're pathetic. That voice that says there's no hope for you.
[time=3019] That voice that says all that stuff. It can get really, I mean, you can really start to buy in.
[time=3025] And when that person buys in, the heart gets hard. So God says to you and to me,
[time=3031] encourage them. Encourage that little girl and that little boy. Encourage your spouse.
[time=3038] Speak affirmation and hope into the life of a friend.
[time=3042] Then look with me at Ephesians 4. Ephesians 4.
[time=3053] We'll just look there at verse 29, first of all.
[time=3056] As if we weren't feeling convicted enough, this morning we'll just add a little bit more
[time=3063] insight here from God's Word. Ephesians 4. 29. Let know. Not some, not a few, not for a month.
[time=3076] Let know. Not one. Unwholesome Word. Proceed from your mouth, but only such a word as is good for
[time=3088] edification. An unwholesome word is a word that doesn't edify. An unwholesome word is a word that
[time=3095] tears down. An unwholesome word is a word that strikes hope. An unwholesome word is a word that's
[time=3102] not affirming, it's critical. And he says to you and to me not to let a single one.
[time=3107] Now I think he realizes that we'll struggle with this,
[time=3113] but he sets the bar and he says this is what I would desire and this is what I'm willing to help
[time=3121] you do to work at this. Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth, but only such a word as
[time=3128] is good for edification according to the need of the moment that it may give grace the words that you say to those who hear. Look at 31. Here you go. He gets real specific, let all bitterness and wrath
[time=3141] and anger and clamor and slander sounds like life in a minivan. I admit it. You know what I mean?
[time=3155] This is shopping for groceries. This is bedtime.
[time=3160] Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you along with all
[time=3167] malice and be kind to each other. Tenderhearted, forgiving each other just as God in Christ
[time=3175] has also forgiven you. You want to write something down under Ephesians 4?
[time=3185] Write this down. Write it in big bold letters. To your spouse, you know, don't write this down.
[time=3190] I'll just remind you to your spouse, to your kids, to your co-worker, to your friends, to the people in this room, to me, to those in the nursery, to those at the front deck,
[time=3201] to everybody. Be nice. Be nice, people. Be nice. Write it down. Be nice.
[time=3215] Be kind and be kind to one another. Tenderhearted, forgiving each other just as God in Christ also
[time=3224] has forgiven you. Be nice. Be kind. Be gentle. You know what? Here's the deal. We have got,
[time=3231] I have got it and you have, all right? We've got monumental battles to fight in this cause,
[time=3242] in this purpose, in this mission that God's given us here, as we are doing our best to be the church,
[time=3248] to offer hope to people in a dying world. You know what? We have monumental, huge, enormous
[time=3255] battles to fight. I don't need to fight any with you. You don't need to be fighting any with each other.
[time=3266] Be nice. Be gentle. Be kind. What am I saying? Don't ever confront. No, we have to confront
[time=3275] sometimes. Sometimes hard things have to get said. Do it nicely. Do it lovingly. Do it gently.
[time=3283] Be an encourager. Be an encourager.
[time=3291] All right. A little homework for you. Number one in your bulletin. In your bulletin,
[time=3298] you'll see, I hope you find a note card and I think even an envelope. Am I right?
[time=3303] All right. I hope you got one there. If you didn't get one, we'll try and track one down for you.
[time=3308] Homework assignment number one. I think it just says just a note, right?
[time=3316] Homework assignment number one, write a note of encouragement to somebody this week, mail it off, drop it in their box, do whatever you got to do. But would you do that? Would you take that note home and would you write a note of encouragement? Speak words of affirmation and hope into the life of someone who needs it. Maybe use that note as an opportunity as well to set up
[time=3338] some kind of an opportunity for you to serve them or to provide some kind of selfless act of kindness and sensitivity. But just give that some thought. Write a note. Write a note to somebody.
[time=3347] And secondly, here you go. Hold your breath on this one. Don't look at me funny.
[time=3354] Don't write me bad letters about it. Write me encouraging letters about it.
[time=3358] Do your best this week to not say one... Let me just read the screen. I want to say it right.
[time=3365] This week, try not to say one critical or negative thing to or about another.
[time=3371] Now you're like me. You're going to be tempted to break that commitment within the hour.
[time=3376] Okay? I got to write home in a van, right? Try. Pray. Pray. And we will. We'll just beg God.
[time=3389] We'll just beg God right here today. And write a note on your mirror and put it in your car and
[time=3396] let's just talk to your kids about it. Make it a family thing or make it a small group thing or whatever. Let's just try this week to see how far we can go.
[time=3405] What the week could be like if we really made a concentrated effort to not say
[time=3412] one critical or negative thing to or about, i.e. behind their back, another.
[time=3423] It's encouraging people. Let's encourage each other. Amen? If you'll do it, if we'll do it,
[time=3434] if we'll give ourselves passionately and prayerfully to this e, this third e of the four that we have,
[time=3444] I believe God will use us in a mighty powerful way to help seeking people, many of whom need what?
[time=3453] Encouragement. Say it. Encouragement. All right. Why don't you stand? Let's pray together.
[time=3462] What a great morning, huh? Boy, so good to be together. Let's let's pray. Ask him for some help
[time=3473] and guidance as we leave this place. Father, we are so grateful for your word and so grateful for its truth. And even though it's painful at times, God, the way it exposes our sin and the way
[time=3485] it reveals our weaknesses, God, we do appreciate that because we know that in exposing us, you're
[time=3491] as committed to helping grow us. And so as a people, we stand before you this morning and we're going to make that commitment. We're going to do our best this week with your help to not speak
[time=3502] words that are negative and critical, but instead words that give hope and affirmation.
[time=3507] And we just, we throw our hands up and our hearts and our lives up before you and we say,
[time=3513] please help us. Holy Spirit, please go with us. Move and prod and remind. Make us sensitive to
[time=3521] these things that we've committed to and give us freedom in our hearts to write a note, a note, God, that would maybe mean something to another who could use those words, who could hang
[time=3533] on to that truth. God, thank you for this family. Thank you for what you're doing here. And we look forward to God. If it be your will, we look forward to being together again soon in your son's name,
[time=3546] we pray. Amen.
