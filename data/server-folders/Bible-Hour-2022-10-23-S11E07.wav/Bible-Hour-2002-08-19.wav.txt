[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=30] (upbeat music)
[time=90] [MUSIC - 163 seconds]
[time=255] One more time, yes Lord.
[time=257] [MUSIC - 12 seconds]
[time=271] Well, it's good to be with you again, and as always, it is just a thrill to be involved in what God's doing here at Blackhawk these days.
[time=279] We have had a tremendous summer, and today you'll be seeing the fourth part in a four-part series that we've entitled our Four E's.
[time=288] Four things that we at Blackhawk are deeply and passionately committed to, as we give ourselves to this ministry that God's given us.
[time=297] And I hope your heart will be encouraged.
[time=300] I hope your mind will be challenged.
[time=302] I hope your spirit's lifted.
[time=304] As again, we get to share in some time together in the Word of God.
[time=309] There have been so many things going on around Blackhawk lately, so many good and encouraging things.
[time=314] And a lot of it has led us to make, in recent months, a very important decision that I want to tell you about this morning.
[time=321] And that is that on September 22nd, we will be going to a second worship service on Sunday morning.
[time=329] It is so encouraging for us to see more and more people showing up here at Blackhawk interested in and wanting to know more about the Word of God and a relationship with God and the people of God.
[time=345] And so as we've seen more and more of them come, we've just decided to kind of make some more space.
[time=351] So we're going to two services on September 22nd, one beginning at 9.15, and the second one beginning at 10.45.
[time=359] And the thing I want to say to you folks today is this.
[time=362] You know how thankful we are for so many of you who have home churches and yet you tune in each week and we're able to provide you some sort of encouragement and support to your week and to your life.
[time=376] And we're glad for that.
[time=378] We also know that there are many of you that don't have home churches.
[time=382] This is your church and you tune in each week and we're going to continue to do with you what we've done in the past.
[time=389] And that is invite you to come and be a part of what God is doing at Blackhawk.
[time=394] To come and maybe further pursue what God may be doing in your own heart and life.
[time=399] And so now you've got two options.
[time=401] Starting September 22nd, 9.15 and 10.45.
[time=406] We'd love for you to come and join us.
[time=408] Love for you to come and see what it's like.
[time=411] To be here at Blackhawk, to meet these wonderful people, to be exposed to the things that God is doing.
[time=418] And we'd love, love to have you with us.
[time=420] So make it a point, which is September 22nd, 9.15, 10.45, child care provided both hours.
[time=427] We'd love to have you come and we hope to see you then.
[time=431] My God is faithful.
[time=442] My God is truthful.
[time=446] My God is boundless.
[time=450] In all he is.
[time=454] My God is wisdom.
[time=458] My God is righteous.
[time=462] My God is vision for all who see.
[time=470] So I will worship you in the beauty of holiness.
[time=478] And I will worship you for the things you've done in me.
[time=486] And when my life's complete, I'll place my crown at your feet.
[time=494] And I will worship you, unbendedly.
[time=513] My God is power.
[time=517] My God is glory.
[time=520] My God is ruler.
[time=524] And we're all that is.
[time=528] My God is timeless.
[time=532] My God is justice.
[time=536] My God is mercy to the old press.
[time=543] So I will worship you in the beauty of holiness.
[time=551] And I will worship you for the things you've done in me.
[time=559] And when my life's complete, I'll place my crown at your feet.
[time=567] And I will worship you, unbendedly.
[time=573] His name is love, his voice is thunder, his heart is tender, his hand is strong.
[time=588] So I will worship you in the beauty of holiness.
[time=596] And I will worship you for the things you've done in me.
[time=602] And when my life's complete, I'll place my crown at your feet.
[time=611] And I will worship you, unbendedly.
[time=618] So I will worship you in the beauty of holiness.
[time=625] And I will worship you for the things you've done in me.
[time=631] And when my life's complete, I'll place my crown at your feet.
[time=640] And I will worship you.
[time=644] Oh, I will worship you, my King.
[time=648] I will worship you, unbendedly.
[time=661] Well, amen to the first 35 minutes, huh?
[time=676] [AMEN] Yeah, you can clap.
[time=679] That's fine.
[time=686] Let me just remind you what we've been doing mentioned earlier.
[time=689] But we have been spending the last three weeks, and now we will conclude this morning with a look at our four Es.
[time=695] And as we've said many times, you know, a different church, different place.
[time=698] It could be four different Es, but we feel a lot of God here in this family.
[time=703] To give our hearts and our lives, to give our energy, day after day, week after week, month after month, we just have been begging God to give us strength and energy and conviction of heart to be a people who would together give ourselves to evangelism, living out our faith and sharing our faith through the relationships that God gives us opportunities to build and have.
[time=725] We believe that if this family, as a family, and as one collective unified unit,
[time=731] if we would together live out our faith, if we would together be a people
[time=737] who understand that there is no greater endeavor on this earth than the privilege that God has given us to live out our faith.
[time=747] We believe He'll make a difference in this community and this world of ours that He's placed us in, evangelism.
[time=754] We've talked about equipping, and we've talked about a deep commitment on your part and mine, hopefully, to be a people who would put ourselves in a position to be taught the Word of God.
[time=765] We hope that you will come and come and keep coming and continue to be a part of settings like these, but we hope you'll go and sign up for that men's ministry Bible study.
[time=773] We hope that you'll sign up for precepts, ladies.
[time=776] As the fall approaches, we hope that you'll get into a small group or go to an A.B.F.
[time=780] We just want you to be a people who are willing to put yourselves in a place where the truth of God's Word gets invested into your heart and life so that you can then engage yourself in the second part of equipping, which is being willing to take that truth and equip others.
[time=798] Give yourself, serve, and offer that same deposit that got given to you into the heart and life of another.
[time=806] Equipping, evangelism, equipping.
[time=808] Last week, we talked about encouragement.
[time=811] Anybody get encouraged this week?
[time=813] Yeah, let me see your hands.
[time=814] Anybody get a card, anybody get a letter, anybody get a call?
[time=817] Thank you.
[time=818] We are an encouraged group as we come together today.
[time=822] What a great time together last week.
[time=824] And you sensed and you saw firsthand what that's like.
[time=828] To have somebody speak words of affirmation and hope into your life.
[time=832] And we believe as our 30 that God uses that, your willingness to be an encourager.
[time=839] Your willingness in mind to receive encouragement, he uses that.
[time=843] And he uses evangelism and he uses equipping.
[time=845] He uses all three of those to help seeking people.
[time=848] Find and follow him.
[time=851] And there's a fourth that we're going to look at today.
[time=855] And it's a very, very important one.
[time=857] And it's called exaltation.
[time=860] Exaltation.
[time=861] And in the past, when we have discussed, when we've studied, and when we've looked at as a family, this idea of exaltation, we've always talked about our willingness to live lives of worship.
[time=873] Exaltation, our willingness to worship God 24/7.
[time=880] Our willingness to live lives of worship.
[time=883] Not just in the hour that we come and spin in this room, no daily living that seeks to bring praise and honor and respect and glory to him and his name.
[time=893] We've talked about God-centered, God-focused living.
[time=897] We've talked about and you've learned and I've learned from the Scriptures that we are to be a people who worship God in our living, in our eating, in our working, our parenting, our spending, our giving, our loving, our playing, where to worship Him and our dating, our schooling, and our thinking.
[time=913] We are to be a people that exalt God, that lift Him up, that worship Him with our lives.
[time=921] And that's kind of where we've gone in the past with this topic.
[time=924] And that's a good place to go because that's what God's word calls us to.
[time=928] Today, though, I want to invite all of you to just consider with me and look to the Scriptures again as it relates to the worship that does take place in this room.
[time=939] I want to talk to you today as a family about what takes place when the body of Christ gathers.
[time=945] I think it's time.
[time=946] I think it's time periodically.
[time=948] It's good for us to just kind of step back and rethink and readdress and give our hearts again to this issue.
[time=954] This issue of worship, the worship service, and all that takes place here in this room when we as a family come together.
[time=962] Why?
[time=964] Why do I feel compelled today to take some time and think this through and talk this through again?
[time=969] Why do I feel compelled?
[time=970] Why do I think it's so important that today we take some time and give attention to what takes place in this room?
[time=978] Well, the answer is clear.
[time=981] The answer, I think, I hope, is obvious.
[time=984] And if it's not, let me maybe help you along here.
[time=987] It's so very important that we look at this today because it is vitally important that we as a family stay unified.
[time=995] It is so very important that we talk about this issue because it is so very important that we as a family stay unified, that we stay in harmony as we approach and live out this issue of worship,
[time=1010] worship style, worship preferences.
[time=1014] So very important that we stay together because you know what?
[time=1017] The enemy.
[time=1018] The enemy is using this issue.
[time=1022] And it's amazing.
[time=1023] You know, I'll talk to guys who have been around for a long, long time.
[time=1026] I can talk to Keith.
[time=1029] Pastor Keith, on our staff, I can talk to Longbreak, who hasn't been around as long as Keith, but he's been around a long time.
[time=1037] I can talk to these guys and I can even think back to growing up in the church.
[time=1041] I remember being an eight, nine-year-old.
[time=1044] And here in my dad talk about the worship issue battles.
[time=1050] And the enemy people has been using this issue of worship, and style, and music, and sound, and volume, and instruments,
[time=1060] and hands, and clap.
[time=1062] He's been, the enemy has been using that issue to divide and destroy the bride of Christ for years.
[time=1071] I mean, it's so very important that we take the time to consider, as a family, what God's Word says, what our posture is going to be, what our attitude is going to be.
[time=1085] So very important that we look at this because you know what?
[time=1088] I don't believe in my heart.
[time=1090] And I don't think you do either.
[time=1091] I don't think any of us want the enemy to get this one.
[time=1095] It's not going to get this one.
[time=1097] We're going to keep at it.
[time=1098] We're going to keep thinking.
[time=1101] We're going to keep together looking at this so that we can stay as one.
[time=1107] Now, here's how we're going to come at this this morning.
[time=1109] And we've come at this a lot of different ways in the past, and we'll come at it a lot of different ways in the future.
[time=1115] But this morning, I want to share with you some things that we've been learning around here.
[time=1119] Steve Longbreak got back recently.
[time=1121] He and Nancy went with Lori Doden, and they visited an orphanage and did some other ministry things in South Africa.
[time=1129] And Steve came back from South Africa, and as he was sharing with us, you know, there were so many things that God did there on that trip.
[time=1137] One of the things that Steve got to do, he and Nancy got to meet a guy named Aki.
[time=1141] And Aki is a guy who's been a senior pastor almost 40 years, and as they begin to talk about this issue of worship in the local church, Aki shared some great perspective.
[time=1153] And as you look to the Word of God, you realize that he knew what he was talking about.
[time=1157] And Aki shared some things, and I want to pass that along to you.
[time=1160] We want to share these things with you this morning.
[time=1163] And I want to just begin by saying this to you.
[time=1166] All of us are called to worship.
[time=1168] Each fully surrendered follower of Christ is called by God to come through those doors as we gather.
[time=1177] All of us that name the name of the Lord are called to come into this place and worship him.
[time=1185] All of us, each fully surrendered follower who comes to gather in this place is called to worship God.
[time=1193] What I'm learning is, and you've been seeing this maybe longer than I have, but what I'm learning is that different people worship different ways.
[time=1201] Different people connect with God in different ways.
[time=1205] I'm realizing that my most meaningful worship may come in a setting or through a means different than the way it takes place for you.
[time=1213] And not only is that okay, but I'm learning and realizing it's the way he made us.
[time=1219] It's the way he made you. He made you different than he made me.
[time=1223] And he made you different than he made you.
[time=1225] And there's a wiring thing, and it's a God-given deal.
[time=1230] And we worship him, we connect with him, we feel that sense of basking in his presence and offering him glory in that sense of connection. You know what? Different means, different settings for me than maybe for you. And so, as Aki talked with Steve that day, he identified four different kinds of worshipers. Let's look at those this morning.
[time=1255] Four different ways to worship. And we'll just say it like this.
[time=1259] All are called to worship. All are called to worship.
[time=1263] Some, some will worship, and we're going to start over here with their head.
[time=1271] All are called to worship. Write it down, but some will worship. Most meaningfully is what I mean by that.
[time=1279] Most meaningfully. I would imagine as we go through the morning that you will find yourself identifying with several, maybe, but you know what?
[time=1287] The way God made you, and the way God made me.
[time=1291] There will be in your life and mind kind of a primary sense where, yeah, that's me. All are called to worship. Some will worship with their head. And what we mean by that is what you see in Nehemiah chapter 8.
[time=1307] If you've got your Bibles, go ahead and turn there. Nehemiah, back in the old Testament.
[time=1311] Nehemiah, just after Ezra.
[time=1315] Just before you get to Esther, look at Nehemiah chapter 8. All are called to worship. Some will worship with their head.
[time=1323] As it relates to the truth, the reading and the studying of God's Word. Nehemiah chapter 8, and all the people, you see it there? Verse 1, "And all the people gathered as one, at the square which was in front of the water gate, and they asked Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the Lord had given to Israel.
[time=1347] And it says there in verse 2, "Then Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly of men, women, and all who could listen with understanding on the first day of the seventh month.
[time=1359] And he read from it before the square, which was in front of the water gate from early morning until midday. And all the people were attentive to the book of the law, and it says there at the end, "Then Ezra blessed the Lord the great God." And all the people answered, "Amen, amen." While lifting up their hands, then they bowed low, it says, and worship the Lord with their faces to the ground.
[time=1383] It says there in Nehemiah that this group of people gathered worshiped the God, yelled, "Amen, and amen, bowed low before their God." And please understand, there had been no song. There had been no dance.
[time=1399] There had been no video. There had been no nothing.
[time=1403] Just simply the reading.
[time=1407] Just simply the opening of the Word of God.
[time=1411] And you know what? There are people in this room this morning, and that is you.
[time=1415] That is what primarily that is all you need.
[time=1419] You're made in such a way that when you study the Word of God, when you hear the Word of God, when you read the Word of God, when the Word of God is proclaimed, something happens in your heart, and it draws you into his presence and you worship him. And that is a good thing. I got a buddy named Paul.
[time=1435] I called him a few months ago. Paul's a pastor up in Canada. I called him at kind of an awkward moment. He was there in his office and I said, "Hey, Paul, how's it going?" And he said, "Hang on." Just like, "Let me kind of gather myself." I said, "Man, is everything okay?" And he was teary. He was kind of all emotional and a little shook up. I said, "Is everything okay?" And he said, "Yeah, I was just having the most incredible time of study in the book in Revelation." I'm thinking Revelation, man.
[time=1463] Revelation leaves me scratching my head and looking for the next appointment. Man, my buddy Paul, he just eats it up. You know, he's that kind of guy. He gets to open this thing up and it's just like he could just get lost in it for hours.
[time=1479] Some of you are like that.
[time=1483] And you know what? That's a good thing. That's a good thing. You're the kind of folks who love the last 40 minutes of the morning.
[time=1491] You enjoy and you connect best with the last 40 minutes.
[time=1499] All are called to worship. Some will worship with their hands. Write that down. Some will worship with their head. That's true. Others of us will worship with our hands. Look at Ephesians chapter 4, back in the New Testament. After first and second Corinthians comes Galatians, then go on one more book to Ephesians.
[time=1523] Ephesians chapter 4, there are many in the room this morning who can really identify with this thought and with this notion.
[time=1531] You are one that worships best with your hands and what we mean by that is this. In verse 11 of chapter 4, Paul says, "And he gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as pastors and teachers for the equipping of the saints." That's you the people, the body of Christ, "for the equipping of the saints for the work of service." For the work of service.
[time=1555] To the building up of the body of Christ. For some in this room this morning, it is the doing of the work of God that connects your soul to him. There are people in this room and I know you and there are some on our team and you come and you listen to the word of God and you enjoy that and you sing songs of praise, but I know some of these folks and their souls get ignited, their hearts get lit when they get the chance to go and roll up their sleeves and teach a lesson. When they get to go and roll up their sleeves and lead a line of kids to the bathroom. I mean it doesn't matter what it is. Dig a trench, drive a bus, there are people and you're this way because God made you this way and you're best active worship is when you're doing things, serving him, giving yourself to him, making a deposit in the life of another. There are people in this room and because of the way God has made you, your souls are stirred through service. You worship as you reach into your spiritual toolbox, you know, and we we've each got one.
[time=1627] We've each got one of these and you know and some of you are you know this and others of us are this and you know he didn't make us all the same, others are better at this and there are people in this family and your most meaningful act of worship is the hour before you come in here. You just love it.
[time=1651] You absolutely love the opportunity.
[time=1655] These are the ones who love doing for God. All are called to worship.
[time=1663] Some will worship with their head, others with their hands, some will worship with their heart. Write that down.
[time=1671] With their heart. And I want to just say this before we go any further with this one, okay? This is not to in any way imply.
[time=1679] Please hear me. That is not to imply that if this is you, you know, or if this is you, it is not to imply that your worship in these endeavors is somehow heartless. No.
[time=1691] But just hear me out on this. There are those in the room and the way God made you your primary means of worship. That time at which you feel most connected to God is when the arts are used. And when the arts are used and when the arts are used well, there's a connection that takes place in your soul and your emotions are appropriately.
[time=1719] Sometimes we think of emotions and we immediately think in the context of church inappropriate. No, no, it's not inappropriate.
[time=1727] Read the Psalms. The stirring of our emotions can be extremely appropriate. And there are those in this room. That's how it works for you. Listen to the psalmist. Listen to the psalmist.
[time=1739] Go back to the Old Testament. Psalm 34.
[time=1743] You just read the psalms. And as you go through the psalms, you just sense that David was a guy wired like this. Psalm 34, 1-3, "I will bless the Lord at all times. His praise shall continually be in my mouth. My soul shall make its boast in the Lord. The humble shall hear it and rejoice. O magnify the Lord with me. And let us exalt his name together." Psalm 63, a few chapters down.
[time=1771] You can turn over there. You see the same kind of thing. You get the same kind of feel.
[time=1775] Psalm 63, 1-5, "Oh God, thou art my God. I shall seek the earnestly, my soul thirst for thee, my flesh yearns for thee, and a dry and weary land where there is no water. Thus I have beheld thee in the sanctuary, to see thy power and thy glory because thy loving kindness is better than life. My lips will praise thee. So I will bless thee as long as I live. I will lift up my hands in thy name. My soul is satisfied as with marrow and fatness. And my mouth offers praise with joyful lips." Jesus told the woman there at the well in John 4 that he was looking for those who would worship him in what?
[time=1819] In spirit. In spirit and in truth. Spirit.
[time=1825] Your soul. Your emotions appropriately engaged.
[time=1833] There are people in this room and these people love the first thirty minutes of the morning.
[time=1840] And they sit and they take in the Word of God and they're thankful for that.
[time=1843] And many of them serve in various ministries, but there are those of you who as you come into this room and the arts just as portrayed in the Psalms.
[time=1855] And those who are gifted and those who are talented when they give themselves to the exercising of their artistic gift. When they do that, your soul, like mine, I'm one of these. Your artistic knights. And that's a wonderful thing.
[time=1871] That's good. It's the way God made you. These people look forward to having the arts touch their emotions.
[time=1879] What do I mean by the arts? You can write it down in case you're not clear. I mean the music.
[time=1883] And I want to say this to you. We'll talk about this for a little bit.
[time=1887] The music and I want to just have you write a little note next to that.
[time=1891] All kinds. Everybody just write it down.
[time=1895] All kinds. The music. All kinds.
[time=1899] The vocals. Where are you going to write next to it?
[time=1903] All kinds. The dramas. The videos.
[time=1907] These people look forward to having the arts, music, vocals, dramas, videos, staging. They look forward to having those things stir their heart. And those things do.
[time=1919] And other people in the room, it doesn't stir them as much.
[time=1923] These people, boy, just ministers to them.
[time=1927] And they in turn feel that sense of connection.
[time=1931] It was interesting last Sunday. What a great, great morning it was.
[time=1935] And you know what? Many, many of you. Many of you commented after last Sunday. And then I've even heard other comments today from those who missed last Sunday but watched the Bible Hour.
[time=1947] And many of you with great attitudes appropriately complimented. Corbin and Eric and Ed and myself and others.
[time=1955] And that was just much appreciated. And I mean that. Many of you.
[time=1959] You know, there were a couple.
[time=1963] And, you know, and I had a great chance to talk with, you know, a few of these.
[time=1967] There were a couple of folks who kind of came up afterwards or maybe I got an email or a note. And the attitude or the mindset was kind of like this. It was kind of like after the 35 piece orchestra and the morning, the way it was put together and all the ties and all the stuff.
[time=1987] There were a few who came up afterwards and said now that's.
[time=1991] Now that's worship.
[time=1995] And they were serious. Now that is worship and that's what we should have every week.
[time=2003] There were a few others who came up and said hey, we're not going to do that like every week are we?
[time=2011] And then there were just a whole bunch of you. Hear me on this. There was just a whole bunch of you.
[time=2019] And you say the same things. You came up and said what you say every week, which is what we all need to say every week. Boy, that was sweet.
[time=2031] It was good to be together.
[time=2035] Boy, that was sweet. And the compliment on the orchestra, that was well received. Again, many of you did that with gracious hearts and it was taken that way.
[time=2047] It's when this person or that person, it's when you or I begin to think that somehow when it finally hits my kind, remember all kinds? It's when we begin to think that when it hits my kind that that's the only kind and we have to work really hard together to be sensitive and to be careful with how we do that.
[time=2075] The electric guitars, drums, songs that repeat again and again, high volume. The response, that was sweet. Wasn't it? And it was so good to be together. 35 piece orchestras, black ties, a medley of hymns from the past. Response? Boy, that was sweet.
[time=2099] Boy, that was sweet. Wasn't it good to be together? In the house of God, with the family of God, a family that he made very, very differently.
[time=2115] Some worship with appropriate stirred emotions and I'm working on that myself. I don't think I, I don't think I have to tell you this.
[time=2123] I think you know, if you know me, that I'm a work in progress there.
[time=2127] I would have been one several years ago that would have been much more prone to stand on my style or my preference and in doing that at times in the past I've even hurt people.
[time=2139] Alienated folks. And I'm working at that.
[time=2143] God's working at that in my own heart. He really is. And I feel like I'm growing and I just want you to be willing to grow with me if you need to.
[time=2151] Many of you, very mature in this. Others of you, maybe with me, we just need to keep growing. And I'm enjoying that.
[time=2159] I mean, I can be here one night at a Tommy Walker concert and I stood right down here both nights and I just got absolutely stirred. I clapped and I danced. My hands were raised. My heart was engaged.
[time=2171] I had, I yelled. I screamed. I sang. I was hoarse for three days. I had such a great time.
[time=2179] And I worshiped. But you know what? Last week was beautiful for me. I worshiped last Sunday. And I worshiped because God's growing my heart and my appreciation. But please catch this. I also worshiped last week because as I scanned this room I saw some of you worshiping in a way that was obviously special and unique and meaningful. And though the preference might be different, the fact that you're a part of my family that brings joy to my heart. And I begin to further and further embrace something that might not be naturally me because you do.
[time=2223] I can listen to, as I did a few weeks ago, Marilyn and Marsha seeing his eyes on the sparrow. And it just brings tears to my eyes.
[time=2235] I can hear the student ministries over there on a Sunday morning or a Wednesday night as I walk by the door and those doors to the asylum are just, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[time=2247] The doors are just thumping. I can walk by there and go, wow, praise God. I can come over and listen to Corbin play the piano.
[time=2255] Quietly, softly.
[time=2259] Just think, boy, that's sweet.
[time=2263] He's working on me. He's growing me. And I hope you'll let him too.
[time=2267] There are some who will worship him with their heads. Others will worship him with their hands. Others of us worship him best when having the opportunity to have our hearts stirred. Some will worship best. And this is great.
[time=2283] I'm learning more about this as the days go by. And there are people in our church who are helping me learn about this as the days go by. And I'm realizing this.
[time=2291] There are some who will worship best in a setting with, I'm going to just kind of say it this way, with high church-like symbols.
[time=2299] We're just going to use that word. Just symbols. There are people because of how they were raised. There are people because of kind of where they've come from. There are people because of the wiring that God gave them. There are those in this family and they feel really connected to God. And their worship experience is the sweetest when they're able to be prompted by a robe, by candles, by a stained glass window, by a cross.
[time=2335] For some there are symbols or settings that prompt them to a deeper worship.
[time=2343] And I want you to think about that. Sometimes I myself have in the past discounted certain physical symbols as being old and outdated. And I admit that to you.
[time=2359] I've done that. I've said that. I've thought that.
[time=2363] I felt that. And as I grow and as he keeps teaching me, I realize and we as a team here are seeing it more and more and more so. But great folks with good hearts who love God and some are 60 and some are 30.
[time=2379] I met a couple of late 20-year-olds last week. They were absolutely just in awe of the symbols of last Sunday service that goes across age barriers.
[time=2395] Some worship best with their heads, others with their hands, some with their hearts, some with physical symbols.
[time=2403] And you know what? Please hear me here.
[time=2407] There's a phrase. I don't know how much it gets used anymore these days.
[time=2411] We used to, when I was in college playing ball and hanging out with the guys, we used to always say this. We used to always say to each other it's all good. It's all good.
[time=2423] We would say. You know what folks?
[time=2427] Those wired like this who best express worship in settings like that. Those of you here in this room who are wired and made by God like this.
[time=2439] Others of you who through the arts have your hearts stirred and others of you who respond best to physical symbols.
[time=2447] Guess what? It's all what?
[time=2451] It's all saved again. It's all good.
[time=2455] It's all great. It's all good.
[time=2459] Now don't miss this. And at Blackhawk we're just going to say this today. We're going to say it and we'll probably have to end up saying it again but we're just going to say it to you today as clear as we can at this place. In this family, at Blackhawk we will celebrate each one. Each of them will be celebrated. We will engage in each learning to appreciate and enjoy each one.
[time=2491] And I mean that.
[time=2495] I don't want you to miss that. You heard me say it right here.
[time=2499] And we're not going to keep score. You have to realize that week after week after week you and I will come in here and that at a fourth of the time you may feel primarily and absolutely connected.
[time=2515] And there may be other times when you don't as much. So then that's when you and I look around the room and you see the others in this family who are engaged through the way that God made them and you go it's all good.
[time=2527] Isn't it sweet to be together as the family of God. We will engage in each one learning to appreciate and enjoy each. Why?
[time=2539] And I'm going to just say this to you as clearly and as emphatically as I can because we're a family.
[time=2547] Because we're a family and we are on this issue folks we are going to stick together.
[time=2555] We're going to stick together. There are churches today and it's alright. There are churches today who say we're just, we're going to make it easy and we're just going to primarily do this.
[time=2567] And that's alright if that's what they choose.
[time=2571] It's easier that way. You only have to keep how many groups happy. One. Some would say no, no, no, no, no.
[time=2579] We're just going to do it this way.
[time=2583] We're going to let it go. We're going to have some fun. You know we're just this going to be us.
[time=2587] And then I suppose it's alright if they want to make that declaration and it's easier because they just got to keep these folks happy.
[time=2595] What I'm learning is it's not about keeping people what? It's not about keeping you happy.
[time=2603] That's not what worship is.
[time=2607] Worship is expressing to him your love and your devotion and your praise and your thanks. And we will hear, we will do it a number of different ways and we will in doing it stick together.
[time=2623] Now some things to remember and if you want to jot this down you can.
[time=2627] Just a couple things kind of flying through my head these days and I just wanted to jot them down.
[time=2631] And I really want you to talk about this as a family.
[time=2635] I really want you to think about this as an individual, okay?
[time=2639] First of all, and I know this goes on. I mean I have eyes, I see it and I probably have the best seat in the house. And I'm going to just say this gently yet forthrightly. There are some in our family who live for the first 30 minutes.
[time=2659] And in the last 40 it's not your thing. And so you kind of check out because this is your thing.
[time=2671] And you like this.
[time=2675] There are some in this family and that's not so much your deal. This is your deal. And sometimes I see you come in at about 11.
[time=2687] 11.05.
[time=2691] Yeah.
[time=2695] That's not good.
[time=2699] We're a family. And we're going to celebrate each other. Chad Birch, one of our elders, we were discussing this the other day. He just gave me a great illustration. And we were talking about it. And it could be Chad's family. It could be my family.
[time=2715] It could be any of your family, you know. He got me thinking about mine.
[time=2719] And what if, you know, what if I came home one night?
[time=2723] And I said, hey, we're going to have a night out. We're going to go have some fun and be together. And I said Maddie, you choose. And Maddie says like she would, Chuck E. Cheese.
[time=2739] And her eyes and her heart are full of joy and excitement.
[time=2743] And what if we all go to Chuck E. Cheese? And what if Russell T. and Wesley and Jake and Cabra and I spend the whole night doing this?
[time=2755] Mmm.
[time=2759] You know what I mean?
[time=2763] We do that.
[time=2767] You know?
[time=2777] Or we go stand over here and it's like, yeah.
[time=2783] This is it right here.
[time=2787] We don't want to do that. We don't want to draw lines and create camps. Because this is about us.
[time=2795] So unfold your arms, Kelly.
[time=2799] Unfold your arms, folks.
[time=2803] Church starts at 10.30. Well, 9.15 and 10.45, right?
[time=2807] In a few weeks. And we will engage in and we will celebrate each and every one.
[time=2815] And that's the call. That's the call.
[time=2819] Now watch this.
[time=2825] Before I let you out of here, I want to just tell you two more things.
[time=2829] And you can just mark this on your sheet. You can kind of just make a little assessment as we go.
[time=2833] I want to ask you this morning how you're doing in this arena. How do you deal with the difference?
[time=2839] How do you personally deal with the difference?
[time=2843] There's a difference, right? We've been pretty clear with that. How do you deal with the difference? Somebody told me this week there's a kind of a scale on which you can see. You can just assess yourself on how you deal with it, where you are, if celebrating and engaging in each with a heart of gratitude and joy. Because yeah, it's me, but sometimes it's not me, but it's us and I'm about us.
[time=2867] If that's the goal, there's kind of a scale on which.
[time=2871] And I want to just ask you this morning.
[time=2875] How do you treat me, me being the person at either one of these stations? Do you antagonize?
[time=2883] Write that one down. Do you antagonize?
[time=2887] Some are there.
[time=2891] That's kind of the bottom of this process. And we've got to work on that.
[time=2895] Some are just flat out antagonistic.
[time=2899] If it doesn't meet their personal preference.
[time=2903] Others move up from antagonism to tolerating me. Some just tolerate.
[time=2907] It's kind of like the me at Chuck E. Cheese with my arms folded. Yeah, okay, whatever. Fine.
[time=2915] Some mature in their hearts and grow toward acceptance.
[time=2919] Some accept me. Some antagonize me. Some tolerate me.
[time=2923] Some accept me. But you know where we want to end? We want to end with celebration, folks. We want to celebrate each other.
[time=2931] We want to celebrate each other. That's the goal, celebration. No matter how different we might be, I want to celebrate with you. I'm going to ask Corbin to come up if he would. And as he comes up, I want to just tell you that it was a few months ago.
[time=2951] He and I were talking in my office one day. And he just said to me, he said, "You know what's on your heart as it relates to worship?" You know, what are some things that, you know, maybe we could in time, just together, kind of teach our people.
[time=2967] And I said to him, you know, Corbin, I just want you to maybe think about Malachi I. And he was kind of asking because I think he wanted to do something to support the effort.
[time=2979] And so we talked a little bit that day about Malachi I. And in Malachi I, you know, it talks about giving your best. God is not pleased at the beginning of Malachi because his people who were called to come in through the door and give their best, weren't giving their best.
[time=2995] They were giving the lame. They were giving the blind. They were giving the sick lambs. And God says, that's not good.
[time=3003] And not only is it not good, but God says it's not acceptable. You are my people and I am your God. And I long to have from you at that place of worship. I long to have your best.
[time=3015] And so our encouragement to date to you is this.
[time=3019] That you would give your best. That financially, as you come to give, that you would give your best.
[time=3027] That in ministry you would come and give your best. We still have some slots that need to be filled with the kids. We've got nurseries, little babies next week that won't be open. We need this family to come and give their best in their service, to give their best in their giving. And as you come into this place, no matter which, no matter which one seems to be the deal that day, you offer your best. You give him your all.
[time=3055] And that we enjoy and celebrate doing that together. So Corbin comes to me a few weeks ago and he says, hey, you know what?
[time=3063] I wrote a song. I wrote a song about Malachi and he played it for me and he played it for the rest of the team and we just thank you, God and thank you, Corbin, and he's going to play it for you right now.
[time=3075] And I want you to listen to the words. Please don't leave.
[time=3079] Just listen. Listen to the words and pray as Corbin sings that this kind of mindset and attitude could be yours. Then I'll come back and close us in just a second.
[time=3101] [MUSIC - 328 seconds]
[time=3433] [APPLAUSE]
[time=3439] Hey man, why don't you stand with me and we'll close.
[time=3443] As you stand, let me just ask you to bow your heads.
[time=3447] I tell you, I can't, I can't hear a song like that. I can't go through a morning like we did last week or even today.
[time=3455] And I hear those words, bringing my all or none. And I can't help but think of one who gave his life.
[time=3461] But think of one who gave his all, all the time around here. And that's our friend Scott Schindler.
[time=3469] And Scott in his years of service and ministry here modeled this for so many of us.
[time=3476] And it just makes me, and I hope it does you, thankful for what we got to have and experience with him.
[time=3484] And I am so thankful that we get to move forward with that great memory and with hearts that are so grateful
[time=3494] for all that he did and all that he gave. We still see it all the time around here.
[time=3501] Father, that is our prayer as we leave today, that you would give us the strength to give you our all
[time=3508] as we leave this place and even as we come back, that we would be a unified, harmonized family.
[time=3515] So incredibly committed to each other, that we come in through these doors and we give our all to you.
[time=3522] And that we support and that we encourage and that we celebrate the differences.
[time=3528] And God, we pray that you would take that and use it in a way that would be powerful in the lives of those who would see it.
[time=3535] And we ask all of this in your son's name. Amen.
[time=3565] [MUSIC - 120 seconds]
