[time=0] I'm going to take a look at the other side of the screen and have a look at the side
[time=12] of the screen.
[time=14] I'm going to take a look at the side of the screen and have a look at the side of the
[time=22] screen.
[time=22] I'm going to take a look at the side of the screen and have a look at the side of the
[time=28] screen and have a look at the side of the screen.
[time=58] He is forever faithful and forever strong and he's forever with us here this
[time=82] morning and I'm praising for that today.
[time=85] Let's continue to worship and sing about who we are, the church.
[time=92] We are Christ's bride and in the context of marriage.
[time=98] It means God is our head.
[time=101] He's the one who's in charge of who we are.
[time=105] He's the husband of this church.
[time=108] We want to sing about that today and hopefully it becomes clear as we sing this hymn.
[time=113] The church is one foundation.
[time=127] Is Jesus Christ the Lord?
[time=132] She is His new creation by water and the world.
[time=142] From where He came and sold her to me His holy ground.
[time=153] With His own burning water and for her life he died.
[time=166] We let come every nation give one more all here.
[time=177] Her daughter of salvation, one Lord, one faith, one birth, one holy name.
[time=191] And she blesses, partakes for holy food.
[time=200] And to a whole she blesses, with every race in blue.
[time=214] She ordered that union with God the free and one.
[time=224] And this extreme of union with those whose last is one.
[time=235] Oh, everyone's and only God in the streets and we.
[time=246] I can't believe and only one I may dwell with me.
[time=260] She is one man with a new nation and to more than ever more.
[time=271] She plays the conservation of peace forevermore.
[time=282] To win the rich and glorious.
[time=288] Her lonely nights are met.
[time=294] And the great church victorious shall be as to ten men.
[time=307] Hi, I'm Mitch, teaching pastor at Blackhawk.
[time=310] And I just want to share with you a few reasons why we're going to two services on September 22nd.
[time=316] There'll be at 9.15 a.m. and 10.45 a.m.
[time=320] Our auditorium seats about 1,800 people so we're going to open up about 1,000 seats per service.
[time=327] And we have a saying around here that it's not about seating, it's not about parking, it's about eternity.
[time=333] And I just want to share with you a few reasons why we're doing that.
[time=336] The first one is call, we believe here that God has put his fingerprint on the heart of every human being and that we all have that call.
[time=346] That's probably why you're watching the Bible hour right now.
[time=350] And that call presents a challenge.
[time=354] Are we going to respond to that call?
[time=357] Are we going to live out that call in relationships with others?
[time=361] And then when we do it leads us to the third thing and that's change.
[time=365] So see, we have the call of God in our lives, it challenges us to live that out and then we change when we live that out.
[time=373] And then there probably is no change that isn't followed by celebration.
[time=380] And we celebrate people into the kingdom of God, into that life-saving, life-giving relationship with God.
[time=389] And wherever you are in your life right now, you may be substituting religion for relationship.
[time=394] You might be hurting financially or in any other way.
[time=398] And I know for a fact firsthand by my experience with the living God of the universe that a relationship with him is what changes your life.
[time=407] It permeates all of life and that's all we want to do is introduce you to that community with the living God of the universe.
[time=415] So to feel his call, to respond to that challenge and to change and to experience that celebration of life with God.
[time=425] We're going to sing a song that a couple weeks ago I sang for you and it's called All or None.
[time=432] It's about how when we come into this room and how when we live our lives that we need to come with the attitude of giving everything we have or nothing at all.
[time=442] Because God is worth everything and if we give him second best that's not good enough.
[time=448] Another part of the song that I want to point out to you it says before I breach that door my heart says I bring you all or none.
[time=455] And it talks about before breaching the door of the sanctuary and that talks about your private times of worship and not just this time when we worship together.
[time=464] And I would hate for any of you to miss out on the opportunity to worship God and the solace of your home or in your room or in your car.
[time=473] And it's not just in here that God is worthy of our praise.
[time=477] It's at home as well and so I want to encourage you to do that in whatever way is best for you.
[time=482] I don't know what that is and that's the fun part because you can worship God however you want when you're by yourself.
[time=487] And today let's worship God through this song.
[time=517] [MUSIC - 817 seconds]
[time=1356] As you mature us and you take us through the events and the circumstances of life, God, we pray today that you, that you alone, that you above all else would be what we desire. You alone and you above all else and that which you've called us to God that that would be our greatest desire.
[time=1382] And that all of that which would attempt to compete, would simply fall by the wayside. And we would be a people completely and absolutely yours.
[time=1395] Better is one day. Father, we pray that today, because of our time together, that which has already transpired and the things that we'll see here in these next few minutes, God, I pray that our love for you, our understanding.
[time=1411] Our understanding of you, our commitment to you would simply grow in your son's name we pray. Amen. Amen. Praise God. Praise God. Thank you, Corbin.
[time=1428] Hey, you know, we are so very thankful for the morning that we get here today. This is a special Sunday in a sense.
[time=1440] Next week, we're going to begin a new series. And we want to tell you about that this morning because we're so looking forward to it and so hoping that maybe even people that you know, maybe some folks that you've been talking to about coming to church.
[time=1457] People that you work with or folks that live on your block or maybe some family members, maybe there's just somebody in your world who's trying to gain a better understanding of this thing called faith.
[time=1467] And we are going to dedicate the next six weeks to a series called Snapshots of a Savior. And it is a six week study that will encourage and deepen your heart if you are one already convinced living in relationship with the Lord.
[time=1482] This will be a chance for you to gain even further insight into the life and ministry and character and person of our Lord for others of you who are still trying to better understand Jesus and who he and who he was and is and the claims that he made and the way he lived his life.
[time=1499] Snapshots of a Savior is this. We're going to take six different interactions that we see Jesus having during his ministry here on earth. And we're going to study from the scriptures, those interactions, the blind man in John 9, the woman at the well, the woman caught in adultery, his interactions with the Pharisees and his interactions with the disciples.
[time=1521] I mean, we're going to just take these interactions, study them. And as we watch him interact with these different people, learn about who he was, learn about how he conducted himself, learn from him, the master, how it is that you and I are to approach and live life.
[time=1539] So you don't want to miss it. Starting next week, Snapshots of a Savior.
[time=1545] You see in your bulletin there, I hope you got one in there, a handout which shows you the pictures of those who are currently serving on what we call our management team.
[time=1557] And this morning really is going to be nothing more than a celebration of the greatest thing in all the world in my opinion.
[time=1565] And I know you laugh at that sometimes when I say that, I realize I'm a bit biased. But you've got to just understand how thankful I am, how committed I am to, and how fired up I get every day of my life that I get to be a part of what the New Testament calls the local church.
[time=1582] There isn't anything like the church, folks. And we get to be a part of a church here that God is using in amazing ways.
[time=1588] And this morning we're going to just do our very best to celebrate what God has been doing, how God is moving, the things that he's teaching us and showing us here at Blackhawk.
[time=1597] We want to do that in a couple of different ways. One of the ways is that we don't do this often enough, and we're just going to begin the process this morning.
[time=1605] There are so many others who will be introduced to you in the days and weeks to come, but we wanted to just start with this group.
[time=1613] I have the absolute privilege of working side by side with this group that you see here in this insert.
[time=1621] And I wanted to this morning, we wanted to just introduce them to you all. Most of you know them, some of you don't.
[time=1628] Others of you know kind of who they're connected to as far as wives and kids, others of you don't, so we tried to provide some insight there for you with the pictures.
[time=1638] But these are individuals that give hours, they give days, they give nights, they give an enormous amount of effort, as do the others on our team who you'll meet in the weeks to come.
[time=1650] But we're going to start with this group, and they're just going to come, I'm going to ask them to come up on the stage here, and we're just going to kind of line across the front.
[time=1658] Dean, if you can hand me that microphone, that'd be great.
[time=1662] And I'm going to introduce them one at a time, actually, come on up, guys, everybody come up together. And as they come, why don't you just thank them as they come, and we'll get the introductions going here in a second.
[time=1673] Let's just stay up here in the front here.
[time=1675] Steve, why don't you come down here, I'm going to go Steve, and then Greg come down here, and then Mitchell after Greg, and then I got an order here, I'm going to have to follow.
[time=1687] And then Doug after Mitch, and then Eric there, see I stayed in order right there.
[time=1693] What a crew, huh? That's a good crew.
[time=1699] I'm just going to hand it over here to Steve's Steve Longbreak, and I just ask these guys just to share briefly.
[time=1706] I hear it from them all the time, the things that they're thankful for, the stuff that excites them about the areas of ministry that they get to be involved in.
[time=1716] And so you can kind of follow along in your handout here.
[time=1720] Steve is a part of, as you know, the Christian school, and also getting more and more involved in adult ministries.
[time=1726] And he's just going to share some things with you and pass it on down the line here, and you can hear from these guys.
[time=1732] My kids aren't in that picture, not because we don't love them, but we didn't have a good picture of all of our kids with us.
[time=1742] And so we just put the two of us in there, and also, you know, they're off doing their own thing.
[time=1747] They're not sacrificing at all for what we get to do here at church.
[time=1751] I'm really thankful the school, God has chosen to bless our school year after year with great people.
[time=1761] And this year, the people that are working in the office to be supportive, Larry Wilhite is the elementary principal, and he does a great job with our K-6.
[time=1772] I'm so thankful for him.
[time=1773] And then in the office on this side of the street, Tom Hopel and Joe Rich are both doing some office things that they haven't done before, some administrative tasks.
[time=1782] I'm grateful for those guys.
[time=1783] And our new athletic director is Steve Wild, and he's doing a great job.
[time=1788] He's got more energy than I do by a long shot.
[time=1790] God has just chosen. He's young.
[time=1792] God has chosen to bless us.
[time=1795] And what I say all the time is this.
[time=1797] He's blessed us in lots of ways.
[time=1799] But the blessing that I am most thankful for are the people that he's continued to bring to shepherd our kids and to train them up.
[time=1810] And I'm so grateful to be a part of that ministry and having been able to do that for a while, be able to see the fruits of that.
[time=1817] And even in my own kids' lives, I'm so glad that they got to be educated there.
[time=1822] So thank you.
[time=1823] You guys have been participating, making Black Hawk Christian School a priority at our church as a ministry since 1973.
[time=1831] I'm really grateful for that.
[time=1832] In addition to that, I've been in the process of transitioning, and God has really laid on my heart a burden for helping men become discipled makers.
[time=1845] And so the last couple years, that's just been churning in my heart.
[time=1850] And I'm going to do that in some new ways.
[time=1852] And so I'm in the transition mode here this year, figuring out what it is I'm going to do in the future.
[time=1857] But part of it's going to be I get to be here for about a third of my time, it looks like, in the future.
[time=1862] And then some adult men's ministries.
[time=1865] But while I'm here, I get to be involved with ABFs, something that I love to do.
[time=1869] Adult ministries, adult Bible studies, those kinds of things.
[time=1873] And then the power equipment, we had 56 guys in the morning, Thursday, and 27 guys in the evening on Thursday that came for power equipment.
[time=1881] And I'm just really grateful I get to do that too.
[time=1884] [AMEN] I'm Greg Deason, and I'm responsible for spiritual formation.
[time=1891] And that means working with children, and with students, and with adults.
[time=1896] And one of the things I am incredibly thankful for is seeing Jesus Christ at work in all ages.
[time=1905] I don't know how many of you have had a chance to come to some of the baptisms, but as I go to the baptisms and as I talk with people in my office,
[time=1913] I am incredibly encouraged and moved and stirred in my heart as I listen to how God is working in this place these days
[time=1924] in the hearts and lives of children and students and adults.
[time=1928] It is an amazing thing.
[time=1930] And I am so thankful to be able to be a part of that.
[time=1934] Secondly, I am so thankful for all the new people that have found their way to Blackhawk.
[time=1941] And many of them are new believers and are now involved in ministry.
[time=1946] I think last Sunday Kelly asked for those that have been here for three months or less to stand.
[time=1951] And I don't know about you, but I was amazed and surprised and encouraged to see that.
[time=1956] And I'm so thankful for that.
[time=1958] Many of the new folks here at Blackhawk are excited and have a passion and have jumped in and become involved.
[time=1966] And many of you that have been here for 15 or 20 or 25 years have that same passion and that same commitment to Jesus Christ.
[time=1974] And you're serving with us.
[time=1975] There's hundreds of people that serve with us in the children and student and adult ministries.
[time=1981] And I'm just so thankful for all of you.
[time=1984] And thirdly, I'm very thankful to be a part of this group of men.
[time=1988] God is teaching me a lot through being with this team.
[time=1992] And He's teaching me in a greater way, daily, the need to rely and depend on Him more than ever before.
[time=1999] And I'm just so thankful for that once again to be reminded of that great, great truth.
[time=2008] I'm Mitchell Cruz and I'm the resident auctioneer for Blackhawk.
[time=2013] And actually I'm teaching pastor and my quadrants kind of a clean canvas that we're painting on called Evangelism and Outreach.
[time=2021] And I have two passions.
[time=2023] One is my passion for sound biblical teaching.
[time=2026] I've studied the Bible for many years intently.
[time=2029] And I often get frustrated when I hear a church describing the God that's not the God of the Bible or describing the relationship with God that's not a relationship that's described with the God of the Bible.
[time=2039] And I'm just absolutely passionate about that.
[time=2042] And that's what makes me so passionate about the second thing.
[time=2045] And that's evangelism and outreach.
[time=2047] Kelly and I met for a year and a half before we decided that this was God's pathway for me.
[time=2055] And it's because of this.
[time=2057] I just think that I think it's Numbers 16, 9.
[time=2063] And 1 Peter 2, 9.
[time=2067] And Revelation 1, 5, and 6, 10, they all say this thing.
[time=2070] We're a nation of priests.
[time=2072] We're a carrier of the message of God.
[time=2076] And you know what?
[time=2077] The NFL Sunday starts today.
[time=2079] And if you're a Bears fan, people know you're a Bears fan, right?
[time=2083] And if you're a Colts fan, they know you're a Colts fan, they're a Packers fan, they know you're a Packers fan.
[time=2088] Well, I think if you've got the light of Christ in your heart, the world needs to know.
[time=2092] The marketplace needs to know.
[time=2096] And I come from that.
[time=2099] And I've lived that.
[time=2101] And so my passion and my desire is that this is a place that's just open to do that.
[time=2105] To bring a lost and hurting world in, then also go out and be the light of the world.
[time=2110] And we're going to do that through missions, through something we got going on called extensions, reaching out to the poor.
[time=2115] In fact, there's a green sheet in there.
[time=2117] You don't mind, guys.
[time=2118] There's a green sheet.
[time=2119] I'd like you to fill out.
[time=2121] It's for the next Servant of Angelism Sunday.
[time=2123] And Doug created that with John Barr.
[time=2126] It's an awesome thing.
[time=2127] And I just get to cheerily the project.
[time=2130] But just want to thank you for loving me and my family.
[time=2133] I'm not single, like some of the middle school girls thought I was.
[time=2136] They're all right over there.
[time=2139] I've got a beautiful family.
[time=2140] And thank you so much.
[time=2141] Hey, Mitch.
[time=2142] When did they make you a Red Coat recipient?
[time=2144] Man, Anthony, you did that with you there?
[time=2146] There's so many things I want to say, but I'm just going to pass it on to Doug.
[time=2151] Man.
[time=2152] I think Mitch needs a little more passion.
[time=2155] What do you guys think?
[time=2159] My name's Doug Crane, and I've just recently come on board and I get to serve in the area of church operations.
[time=2166] I like to call it Team Ops because it kind of sounds Clancy, Tom Clancy, novelist, don't you think?
[time=2173] The areas that I get the privilege of serving in are overseeing and working with the business
[time=2179] and finance office, which is currently led by Mark Kaufman.
[time=2183] And facilities, which is very ably led by Bud Gibson.
[time=2189] And I've had just a lot of fun already.
[time=2191] I got a hard hat tour of this whole area up above us here.
[time=2194] You know, there's a whole world up above there that you don't see.
[time=2197] And I got to go out on the roof and I saw the computers that keep us cool and warm and stuff in here.
[time=2202] So he oversees a whole bunch of things that I'm excited about.
[time=2207] A couple areas that are new, kind of like Mitch said, a blank canvas are internal communications,
[time=2214] which is just improving the whole way that all of us servants get to communicate with each other and make sure we all know what each other's doing.
[time=2221] And I'm excited about helping with that.
[time=2224] And the other thing is Ministry Plan, which is, I guess I would summarize it best just by making us be sure
[time=2235] that we are following God's agenda, that what God wants Black Hawk to be and do and become
[time=2241] that we are being and doing and becoming.
[time=2244] So those are the areas that I get to serve in.
[time=2249] My name is Eric Hall and I get to oversee the programming ministry here, which means that I get to be in charge of everything that happens up here on stage and in this room on Sunday morning, Sunday night, Wednesday night, everything except for the sermon.
[time=2264] And the music, the drama, the visual stuff that we do, the technical stuff that we do, I get the privilege of overseeing.
[time=2271] And the thing that I love so far about what I do is the people I get to work with, people like Corbin and Ed and the techies you see right here making sure you can see and hear me.
[time=2283] And I love working with those people. I love listening to their ideas.
[time=2287] And I love watching those ideas unfold up here on stage that they have and working with that team.
[time=2292] And you've seen some of those unique ideas already come to bear.
[time=2297] And I just love that. And that's what I get to do.
[time=2300] [AMEN] Hey, would you please, before you say goodbye to these guys and they have a seat, would you just please take one last look at this, you know, look at this, look at them, and realize that in each of these pictures, there are some other individuals sitting nearby.
[time=2316] And those individuals sacrifice on a daily basis in enormous ways so that these guys can do
[time=2328] so that we get to do what we do.
[time=2330] We try our very best to keep those sacrifices balanced and in check, but there's just no getting around it.
[time=2336] The people you see, the young lives, the spouses, I mean, enormous sacrifices are made.
[time=2342] And so please, as these guys sit down, would you do two things?
[time=2345] Would you thank them and their families, and would you also commit?
[time=2350] Would you please just commit to put this on your refrigerator, to stick it on your desk, to just put this for the next week somewhere where you would see it and pray for them?
[time=2359] Would you do that?
[time=2361] Would you please?
[time=2362] All right, thank these guys again, would you?
[time=2364] Well, I want to kind of keep celebrating with you if we can, and we've been looking forward to this.
[time=2381] I'm going to ask two good friends to come on up if they'd make their way, Andy and Beth.
[time=2386] And some of you know Andy and Beth, others of you don't.
[time=2389] But Andy and Beth are somewhat on the new side to this family.
[time=2394] And we just thought it was appropriate.
[time=2396] You know, you get to sit here and stand and watch this team of leaders come.
[time=2401] And they all talk about the ministry, how you guys?
[time=2405] Go ahead and grab your stools there.
[time=2407] Have a seat.
[time=2408] They talk about ministry.
[time=2411] We talk about adults and kids, and we talk about the things that God is doing here.
[time=2419] We ask for your prayers, and you know, we do our very best to keep those things out in front of you.
[time=2426] Well, it's a good thing periodically, and we could do this every week.
[time=2431] We choose not to, but it's just periodically it's a good thing for you and I to be able to sit back and to see in real life, in real flesh, right before our eyes the work of God in the lives of people.
[time=2444] As God has taken our weak and feeble efforts and used them to actually bring change, significant change,
[time=2452] and in the lives of those that He brings our way.
[time=2455] And so this morning I just want you to meet Andy and Beth Strobel.
[time=2458] And they got baptized a couple of weeks ago out at the lake, and you may have seen that, you may not have.
[time=2464] But they've just got a great story, and their story is similar to many, many that we hear, week after week after week.
[time=2475] And what God has done with them, and how God listened now, how God has used you, these next ten minutes or so.
[time=2482] This is for this family, to be encouraged and to be reminded that God takes what we try and do and give and bring,
[time=2490] and He uses it to actually change and draw people to Himself, and so it's just good to celebrate that periodically.
[time=2498] Andy and Beth, good to see you guys.
[time=2501] Yeah.
[time=2502] Share with the folks, Andy, start out here and just share with the folks just briefly.
[time=2506] It's always just good to kind of figure out how folks got here.
[time=2511] How did you guys, how did God bring you guys to Blackhawk?
[time=2514] Tell the folks about that process.
[time=2516] And where you're from, yeah.
[time=2518] Yeah, we're from Brian Ohio.
[time=2520] It was about a forty-five year Sunday for us, but our other church was only a mile.
[time=2527] But it's nothing.
[time=2530] I mean, we just, we talk and celebrate, and we just talked about the past year this morning,
[time=2536] and how God has changed our lives and used Blackhawk.
[time=2540] But probably two years ago, I started watching Kelly on the Bible hour before I went to my other church
[time=2547] in our Bible study, and his word and his message was a lot different from what I was hearing at my former church.
[time=2554] He talked about a relationship, and I wasn't used to that, a relationship with Jesus and God,
[time=2560] and I just wasn't used to hearing that.
[time=2564] And I'd given my life to Christ about three years ago, but I was not happy.
[time=2569] I had a lot of turmoil in my life and in my mind, and there was a spiritual battle going on in my mind.
[time=2576] And I couldn't shake it. I couldn't do enough things to please my pastor, my former pastor.
[time=2583] She wanted me to become a pastor, and I'm not supposed to be a pastor, I don't think.
[time=2589] But the to-do list was just huge, and we just couldn't do enough, and we were not happy, and it was time to move on.
[time=2597] But we were in our comfort zone, and we just stayed.
[time=2602] And we were remodeling our house two years ago when we started watching Kelly on TV,
[time=2610] and we could drive by here going to Lowe's.
[time=2613] We'd drive by, and Blackhawk just called out, and we kept saying, "Should we stop?" And we didn't, and we'd drive by.
[time=2621] Finally one night, probably a year and a half ago, we were going on the way home again, and we stopped at Fazole's, and the Blackhawk youth group was there with kids and their parents, and they were serving food that night.
[time=2633] And this one girl kept coming to our table offering breadsticks, and she wouldn't leave us alone.
[time=2639] She was very kind, though.
[time=2642] She just wanted to eat more bread.
[time=2645] She was very kind, but she kept saying, "Do you want more bread?" And I said, "No," and she said, "You sure you don't need more bread?"
[time=2654] And after about four or five breadsticks, I think at the time I didn't know, but I think she was offering me another kind of bread, and that was spiritual bread.
[time=2663] And God was using her to talk to us.
[time=2667] And so finally we stopped one night, and we asked what time the services were,
[time=2675] and they told us, and we came back the next Sunday.
[time=2678] And when we walked in, it was just such, so different from our other church.
[time=2685] We could feel a joy, and the peace when we came in, and Marv Eastlin introduced himself,
[time=2692] and shook my hand, and that was the first step.
[time=2696] And then the Celys walked up the next week, and they introduced themselves, and they talked to us.
[time=2702] And Kelly's word as a message was really good for us, and Steve Longbreak.
[time=2707] And then we met Mitch, and he's got a lot of energy.
[time=2715] I think you're okay.
[time=2717] We okay?
[time=2718] No.
[time=2719] Hang on, just a second.
[time=2722] Did he lose?
[time=2723] No, he didn't lose this mic.
[time=2724] I think you're back.
[time=2725] We okay, guys?
[time=2727] All right.
[time=2729] And the music was really great.
[time=2732] On the Bible hour, we just couldn't believe the music how great it was.
[time=2737] I can't mention all your names, but Curt and Marilyn and the Joneses, and you just kept working on my heart,
[time=2743] and we came into the church, and we come back each week, and we joined a class called Step.
[time=2749] And we just wanted to find out what the truth was.
[time=2752] I know Kelly was speaking the truth, but we needed somebody to talk to us one-on-one.
[time=2757] And Jeff Kowatch taught that class.
[time=2762] Jeff Kowatch taught that class, and he worked with us, and started to bring me out of that spiritual bondage,
[time=2769] and just talked to me every week, and I'd go home, and I'd think about it, and we'd read in the Bible, and we'd talk and talk and talk.
[time=2777] And he finally figured out what was wrong.
[time=2781] I'd given my life to Christ, but I haven't given my heart to Christ.
[time=2784] I wanted to control my life.
[time=2787] My life as it was, and I wanted God on this side, and I wanted to be in the middle and be in control,
[time=2793] and it didn't work, and I just was a mess.
[time=2796] And Jeff finally said, "Andy, you can't do it all by yourself.
[time=2800] You just need to let yourself go, give yourself to God." And I did, and I was saved, and it hasn't been the same since.
[time=2808] [APPLAUSE]
[time=2816] Beth, tell the folks.
[time=2818] From your vantage point on this thing, you had made a commitment to Christ at some point in your past,
[time=2825] but kind of talk about how all that really came to fruition after you guys showed up here.
[time=2830] First of all, Kelly promised if I cry, he'll cry too.
[time=2835] Andy and I have been married 31 years, and I was 17 when I was a senior in high school.
[time=2843] My business teacher was a pastor, and he married us, and through our counseling for marriage,
[time=2852] he prayed the prayer of salvation with me.
[time=2855] I'm not sure I really understood, but after we were married, we went to church, raised our kids in church, and we thought we were doing the right thing.
[time=2864] But we had religion, and like Andy said, we couldn't do enough.
[time=2870] Just constantly, do, do, do, do.
[time=2873] And that's not what it's about.
[time=2876] We had no peace. We didn't have the joy.
[time=2881] And when we came to Black Hawk, the peace and the joy that we could feel
[time=2888] when we walked in the doors was just unbelievable, overwhelming.
[time=2893] And we still feel that every week when we come here.
[time=2896] And we never felt that before.
[time=2898] So, we took, this is the part where I'm supposed to say, we took the step class.
[time=2906] We have completed following Christ.
[time=2910] We did the contagious Christian, and we did the crown financial study.
[time=2918] And through all of that, we have just met so many nice people here, and developed so many relationships.
[time=2925] It's just really great, and overwhelming to know everyone.
[time=2933] Try to remember everyone's names.
[time=2935] That's great.
[time=2937] If you could just, in a moment, if you could just share with the family, there was something you wanted this family to hear you guys say to them, to encourage us, to remind us, to keep us faithful in that.
[time=2950] What, Manny, what would you say?
[time=2953] I'm sure that all of you coming every week and giving so much of yourselves, like the band and the chorus, and Beth with all her arrangements for the dinners.
[time=2964] And just, you give so much, and I know sometimes you must wonder, "Am I doing the right thing?
[time=2970] Should I keep on going and don't give up?" I just, I thank and praise every one of you for all the help.
[time=2977] And step out, don't be afraid to get out of your comfort zone.
[time=2982] This church needs a lot of help.
[time=2984] It just takes a lot of people to take care of all the programs, and just don't be afraid.
[time=2989] There's nothing to be afraid of at all.
[time=2990] God will help you.
[time=2992] It'll just, he'll lead you all the way, and they need your help, and just volunteer.
[time=2996] There you go.
[time=2997] Every time I let go, I see these guys around this place.
[time=3000] I feel like we should reimburse some gas money or something, that they're just here.
[time=3006] They're just here.
[time=3008] Everywhere you look, there's Andy and Beth.
[time=3010] We'll just take your truck.
[time=3012] Okay, you got it.
[time=3015] Beth, how about you?
[time=3016] If you wanted to just say one thing?
[time=3017] I would like to tell the people, and I don't want to sound like I'm preaching, but if you come and you sit in the pew every week and you don't get involved, you'll never feel a part of the church family.
[time=3028] And that's what God wants us to do.
[time=3030] He wants us to feel a part of the church family, be a part of it, and use the gifts and the talents that he has blessed us with.
[time=3038] We all have different gifts and talents, and we're here for different reasons, and use what you have.
[time=3047] My calling is cooking and baking.
[time=3050] That's just me.
[time=3051] I love that.
[time=3052] I love people.
[time=3053] I love just-- He likes to eat.
[time=3058] I love to serve, but you need to make the effort.
[time=3065] The people here, they're willing to reach out, but you also have to reach out.
[time=3071] You need to call the church office, talk to the people who are sitting around you and say, "Oh, I can bake a dozen cookies or three dozen cookies or whatever you can do, hammer a nail or whatever, and offer your gifts and talents, and you will be blessed more than you would ever realize by getting involved here."
[time=3094] And it's just a continuous blessing to be able to serve.
[time=3099] Thanks, guys, for everyone that needs to come and share their story.
[time=3102] You guys can put those right down there in those schlachs there.
[time=3105] [APPLAUSE]
[time=3111] Thanks, you guys, so much.
[time=3113] Let me just read this to you.
[time=3117] I just sat down last night and wrote this down, and then we're going to close.
[time=3124] This morning, getting a chance to see that team of guys up here, having a chance to hear Andy and Beth share their story again.
[time=3132] It reminds me, and I have been in recent days, reminded again and again.
[time=3138] And let me just say this to you as clearly as I can, and then we're going to go, and we'll come back together again, hopefully Wednesday and again next week.
[time=3147] I've been reminded again and again in recent days how much I love the church,
[time=3154] how much I absolutely, thoroughly and completely love the New Testament church
