[time=227] Way to go guys, looking good sounding good.
[time=233] Is that grammatically correct?
[time=235] Sounding good, it's good enough.
[time=237] Hey, welcome to Black Heart, you made it, so glad that you're here.
[time=241] We just love when people visit and we want to put a name with your face at the end.
[time=247] So when we're all done, please come forward, say hi to Kelly and me and are you gonna hang around this time?
[time=253] All right, we'll be hanging around front, we just wanna meet you, wanna talk to you.
[time=258] I think the next six weeks are we some of the most influential six weeks,
[time=264] not only for us, not only for our community, but like individually inside our heart.
[time=269] And it's just, it's about Jesus, we're beginning a series called Snapshots of a Savior.
[time=277] And we have an original painting painted by a member of this congregation that depicts the topic of the day, and that's the first one, hopefully of six.
[time=288] And I just wanna invite you right now to consider a question, a question I asked the group earlier this week.
[time=294] If I were to ask you today, who is Jesus, what would you say?
[time=298] After you got by all the cliches and all maybe religious jargon you've heard over
[time=304] your life, what would you say if I ask you today and say, who is Jesus?
[time=309] What would you say, now would you pray with me?
[time=311] God in heaven is close as the air is around us.
[time=316] We just thank you for who you are.
[time=319] We thank you for Jesus Christ, for your love for all the world.
[time=325] And now God, may we push the pause buttons on our hearts.
[time=331] Maybe may we quiet our entire inner being.
[time=336] So in a very real way, we can feel your prompting.
[time=347] We can feel that gentle whisper of your voice.
[time=351] Maybe so in this place today, may you reveal yourself to us in a mighty way.
[time=356] In Jesus mighty name, amen.
[time=359] Sing this with us, Lord, I want to know you more.

[time=2515] I would just invite you this morning to just take a minute and to just consider what's studying him, seeing him, being with him, watching him.
[time=2528] They were there and saw the interactions.
[time=2531] And you realize, don't you, what it did to them?
[time=2535] You realize that it changed them.
[time=2538] Radically, you realize that these twelve simple men, fearful men, scared men, because of their time with him, because of their understanding of him, that as that grew and as it came to its final culmination, when he died and went to be with the father, it was these
[time=2557] men whose hearts and lives had been completely and radically transformed.
[time=2561] They changed the then known world.
[time=2565] They died, martyrs' deaths.
[time=2568] They were drastically and radically altered as men, as human beings, as followers of Christ, because they saw him, because they watched him, because they listened to him, and in knowing him, and in being exposed to him.
[time=2586] Their hearts were grown, their lives were changed, and yours can be, and mine can be too.
[time=2595] Why six weeks on Jesus?
[time=2598] He is our starting point.
[time=2600] He is the beginning of it all.
[time=2605] He is our sanctification.
[time=2607] For those of you that know him, he offers us a picture, a model, an example to follow that grows us.
[time=2618] Thirdly, write this down, would you?
[time=2620] He is our salvation.
[time=2628] You all know how this works here, and I know you do.
[time=2631] I said just a few moments ago that there are many of you here in this room this morning, and there are many of you watching over TV.
[time=2638] There are many of you who know him, and you're grateful for that, and you realize he's your starting point, and you're being grown and developed by him.
[time=2647] He is sanctifying you.
[time=2650] There are others of you here this morning, and you know how thankful we are that you are here, and still others of you watching by TV.
[time=2658] You're over here in a different place on this journey, and you don't know.
[time=2664] You don't know him.
[time=2666] Not yet.
[time=2669] You know about him.
[time=2671] Oh, you may know a lot about him.
[time=2675] But there are some here this morning, and you have not come to that point of full surrender.
[time=2680] You haven't. You know you haven't.
[time=2682] And sometimes you try and kind of make yourself think you have, and sometimes you kind of almost talk as if you did, but the fact of the matter is you know in the depths of your heart.
[time=2692] But in your journey of searching and seeking, you still have not come to that point yet where you're willing to surrender, to draw that line in the sand to really put that stake in the ground and say, "I believe.
[time=2703] I believe the gospel, and I believe that Jesus died for me and has called me to a life made possible because of his forgiveness and the hope that he grants."
[time=2716] Why do six weeks on Jesus?
[time=2718] You know what?
[time=2719] Because we want to again and again whenever possible remind you and give you the opportunity again to see what it says in John 14, 6.
[time=2732] They were asking him questions like they often did.
[time=2736] You can turn there if you'd like.
[time=2738] Matthew, Mark, Luke, John.
[time=2742] This is the verse I always catch flack for.
[time=2746] This is the verse we always get heat for.
[time=2749] This is the verse they always shake their finger at me and say, "Now how can you say that?" And I say, "You know what? I didn't say it. I'm just reading it. He said it."
[time=2760] John 14, 6.
[time=2763] Jesus said to him, in five, Thomas said to him, "Lord, we do not know where you are going. How do we know the way?"
[time=2769] Jesus said to him, "I." Seeker?
[time=2775] One searching today.
[time=2777] Still, listen. Please listen.
[time=2780] Hear these words of life.
[time=2783] Jesus said, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one."
[time=2792] And he said, "No one. Nobody. No how no way. Nobody. No one comes to the Father, but through me."
[time=2806] Jesus.
[time=2810] That's what it says.
[time=2813] "I am the way, the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father, but through me." Pretty simple. Pretty powerful.
[time=2820] So very straightforward.
[time=2823] So very narrow. Some will say.
[time=2827] Okay. He says the gate is narrow.
[time=2832] Simple. I like that word.
[time=2838] You want to use the word narrow? Okay.
[time=2841] It's just, it could be narrow because all you got to fit in there is one word. Jesus.
[time=2847] That's it.
[time=2849] And I don't view it as narrow and I don't view it as odd.
[time=2853] I view it as incredibly loving when I consider me and who I was and where I was.
[time=2860] You may want to call him narrow. I call him incredibly gracious.
[time=2865] He said, "I am the way, the truth and the life. And no man enters heaven." Not one.
[time=2874] But through me. Not through what you do. Not because of how you were raised.
[time=2881] Not because of how many times you went to church, how much money you gave, what you did or didn't do.
[time=2886] Well, in the end, in the end it's about him. And we want to see him in these interactions that we'll study and observe.
[time=2898] We want you to see him and understand more clearly his heart and his character and his message and maybe most importantly how much he loves you.
[time=2910] Let me just say this. I want to say this to those of you searching and I want to say this to those of you already convinced.
[time=2918] And so many of you here today who know him and are doing your best to follow him.
[time=2922] One of the greatest joys you have is the same greatest joy I have and that is being able to talk with someone and help communicate hope and truth and life in meaningful ways.
[time=2936] To those of you who are still thinking this all through, please understand that there really is just one question.
[time=2945] That there really is just one for you to consider.
[time=2950] It happens to me all the time. I'll be talking on the phone, I'll be on an email, I'll be in a booth at a restaurant with somebody trying to think all this through.
[time=2957] And I can just replay the same conversation for you again and again and again and it might sound a little bit different here or a little bit different there.
[time=2963] But you know what so many times it's the exact same conversation.
[time=2966] They'll lean over and say okay first of all I've got to get this whole Noah thing figured out.
[time=2970] The Noah, the whole ark and the animals thing.
[time=2973] Now tell me this, how and I'll go hey, timer.
[time=2976] You know what? There's going to be a day and we'll get the Noah thing figured out.
[time=2981] What are you going to do with Jesus?
[time=2987] Well okay I know that but okay let's talk about creation.
[time=2992] And then want to talk about creation and evolution and carbon dating and all this stuff.
[time=2996] And off they'll go and halfway through I'll just say time out.
[time=3001] I got some books you can read and I think we can figure some things out.
[time=3004] And you know someday we'll get it all figured out but right now I just got to ask you what are you going to do with who?
[time=3009] Say it.
[time=3010] Jesus.
[time=3011] That's the question.
[time=3013] And they want to talk about babies that die early and they want to talk about things I wanted to talk about.
[time=3019] They want to talk about the end times and are you pre-trip or should I be posh or mid-term.
[time=3023] They want to talk about everything in the world but so many times and I think it's the enemy.
[time=3026] Trying to pull them away from what you know and I know is the main deal.
[time=3030] They want to talk about everything under the sun but they don't want to answer the question.
[time=3034] What are you going to do with a really good man, a perfect man, the son of God who died so you could have life.
[time=3040] And that is the issue and that is the question.
[time=3044] And we believe that for some of you he may use this six week series to bring you to a saving faith and trust in him.
[time=3052] So don't miss any part of it.
[time=3058] Be here if there's anything you can do you know to just make sure that you're here.
[time=3065] And bring a friend, bring two, bring a few.
[time=3070] Go ahead and make the invite.
[time=3073] Go ahead and just pray right now.
[time=3075] God who should I ask?
[time=3078] Come and be a part.
[time=3079] Christ follower, believer, today I'm asking you come and be a part.
[time=3083] Come and grow and be deepened in your faith as we look to the scriptures at the life and the heart of our Lord.
[time=3090] Christ followers come and be a part, seekers come and see.
[time=3095] Come and see the one who said come to me all who are weary and burdened and I will give you rest.
[time=3103] Come and take a look at this man, Jesus the son of God.
[time=3108] Folks watching on the Bible hour, come we'll make room, we'll scoot over, we'll save you seat.
[time=3113] Come witness this study in person.
[time=3119] It's so exciting for us.
[time=3122] So very exciting for us to think about what he might do with his own word as we do our best with his help to proclaim and paint this picture of life with him.
[time=3135] And so we hope that your heart is ready.
[time=3139] We hope that your life, we hope that in your heart and in your life and in your mind that you would come away from this place today that you would come back to this place next week ready
[time=3148] to be transformed, ready to be changed, ready to be radically and drastically altered.
[time=3156] To six weeks from now be a different person, not because of me and not because of him and not because of this but because of this.
[time=3164] This biblical look into the life and heart and character of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3172] He is our starting point. He is our sanctification and he is for those still searching.
[time=3180] Our salvation.
[time=3184] Why don't you stand and we'll close in a word of prayer.
[time=3198] Hey before I ask you to bow your heads and please stay if you would before you bow your heads and close your eyes.
[time=3205] Let me just mention this to you.
[time=3207] We would love to be able to talk with you this morning about a number of different things.
[time=3212] One of the things and we don't mention this very often, we don't ever want to seem or appear pushy.
[time=3216] But you know what, there are so many of you who have in the last five years, five months recently started to really make this place home.
[time=3227] We want to give you the chance to really kind of seal that.
[time=3230] And so if becoming a member of this family is something that you'd be interested in learning more about,
[time=3236] we've got some folks that are just right down here after each service.
[time=3239] Gwen's down here I believe and Lydia and I'll be down there as well and mention some others.
[time=3244] We would love to just talk with you about that.
[time=3246] If becoming a part of this family, if actually becoming a member is something of interest, you can just initiate that by coming on down afterwards and we'd love to talk with you.
[time=3254] Okay, let me invite you to bow your heads.
[time=3257] And I just want to take this opportunity to just say what I know is true, that there are some here in the room this morning.
[time=3265] And you are so very thankful for the faith and the relationship with him that he has given you.
[time=3272] Please don't take that for granted.
[time=3274] Please extend to him this morning, maybe even right now as you stand there, just a word of gratitude and thanks.
[time=3280] Thank him for the fact that he is your starting point.
[time=3283] Thank him for the fact that he is so very committed to be, to perfecting in you and growing in you that which he began, Philippians 1-6.
[time=3293] Because you know him today, because you live in relationship with him today, please don't take that for granted and thank him for that.
[time=3301] Others of you here in the room right now, you know where you stand and you know that you have not yet come to that point and you want to.
[time=3312] You've heard the truth. You've seen the truth lived out in the life of a friend or two.
[time=3316] You've been around this place and you know in your heart that real life, real meaning, real forgiveness, freedom from shame and guilt, that peace that surpasses all understanding for today and an eternity with him in the future, you know that that's available only in relationship with him.
[time=3338] And maybe this morning right now, you just need to say these words to him.
[time=3344] Maybe you're just in the quietness of your heart right now, just between you and him.
[time=3349] Maybe it's time for you to just say to him these words, say it to yourself, he'll hear you, God in heaven.
[time=3359] I know that I'm a sinner. I know that I'm imperfect and flawed. I see it every day.
[time=3370] And God, I know that you loved me. I don't know why, but you loved me so much you gave your son.
[time=3381] And he died. His bones were broken. His blood was spilled so that I could have relationship with you.
[time=3392] And God, today, right here, I surrender my heart and life to that truth.
[time=3400] And I am so thankful for this place that you have brought me where I can grow in that faith, these people, who will help me.
[time=3410] But God, today, I surrender my heart and life, and I commit to follow you and you alone.
[time=3420] Just say this to him, God in heaven, thank you for saving me.
[time=3428] And Father, there are so many in this room that as we say those words, as we pray that prayer again,
[time=3434] so many of us that just are immediately taken back to that point in time when we said those very same words to you.
[time=3442] And God, I pray that that would never grow old.
[time=3446] God, I pray that that passion would just burn deeper and brighter in our own hearts and lives and that we would.
[time=3454] Those who came to know you just now and those here in this room that have known you for years, God, that we would collectively as a family.
[time=3463] Offer each other and this community, the thousands of people living outside these doors far from you, that we would offer a redemptive passion.
[time=3473] Lives being lived, wanting and desiring to be used of you to bring others to faith.
[time=3481] God, please use us, please grow us in whatever way we might need to be grown to be used of you in that way.
[time=3489] And we'll thank you for it, your son's name we pray.
[time=3492] And all the people agreed and said, amen.
