[time=67] [MUSIC - 263 seconds]
[time=333] (audience applauds)
[time=340] - It was a great thing that he did for each one of us.
[time=345] Seems like so long ago, 2,000 years, probably older than any of you here, older than me, I'm young, remember?
[time=353] But there's so much truth that is in the word that was also written 2,000 years ago.
[time=359] And today we're talking about the woman at the well.
[time=362] And Jesus as our Redeemer and the great thing that he did to set us free from the bondage of sin.
[time=369] And I'm excited that the truths that were written several thousand years ago still apply to today.
[time=375] And that the living water that Jesus talked about in that story still applies today.
[time=381] And that we can still have our cisterns full of the living water that God provides for us.
[time=387] I'm gonna continue to sing and sing about the fount of Jesus' blessing.
[time=392] The ladies are gonna sing first and then the men and them will all join in together.
[time=396] But sing out loud and this great old hymn come the fount of every blessing.
[time=401] (gentle piano music) [MUSIC - 106 seconds]
[time=520] (gentle piano music) [MUSIC - 44 seconds]
[time=576] (gentle piano music)
[time=606] Come just as you are, come just as you are, come just as you are.
[time=613] [MUSIC - 191 seconds]
[time=809] You know, it provides that living water.
[time=823] It's Jesus.
[time=825] And although God wanted His people to experience life and it's full of us, they were sinned, that kept them so far apart from God.
[time=835] Started way back from the first man ever created and Adam and Eve, and they brought sin into this world, and by a choice that they made, and we make choices every day that then we send to.
[time=848] But then through Jesus Christ, we have an opportunity to have living water that fills our souls, and unlike anything else can, and so let's just sing this song about the risen Christ and the anointed one that God brought to this earth, Jesus.
[time=869] [MUSIC - 290 seconds]
[time=1163] - Thank you, Corbin and Tanya.
[time=1178] Soon to be Mr. and Mrs. Miller in seven months, eight months.
[time=1183] - Yeah, we're excited for them, and so thankful that they're willing to use their gifts in ways like that.
[time=1192] Savior, Redeemer, friend, that reminds me of a few things.
[time=1196] One is that we get to tonight, come back together, and I really hope you will.
[time=1200] I hope you come back tonight, and celebrate, and remember.
[time=1205] It's what we're told to do, to remember our Savior, our Redeemer, the one who bought us back, and we'll do that tonight with baptism and communion, so please come back tonight at six.
[time=1215] And what a fitting intro to the continuation of our series this morning.
[time=1219] We've called it "Snapshots of a Savior." And it is our desire, and we began last week, and we will continue now, the next five, to take some different interactions that Jesus had, some of the conversations, some of the encounters that we see in the Scriptures, and we're going to do our very best to study those encounters, and look closely into those interactions and discussions, and see what it is that we might be able to learn through our observation, and our study of this wonderful Lord and Savior, our Redeemer, as He interacts with different people at different times.
[time=1253] This morning, we have also our newest installment, our newest visual aid behind me.
[time=1260] We are so thankful for Sarah Stolle and the work she continues to do, and she's doing it passionately.
[time=1266] We're so thankful for the chance to bring each week a new painting that she herself painted, and that's a six-week series, and she's committed to bring every week a new painting that visually captures, and kind of just portrays for us these encounters that our Lord is having,
[time=1283] and so we're so thankful for that, and as the picture shows you today, we will in our time together this morning look at Jesus and the thirsty woman.
[time=1293] Let me start out by just saying this.
[time=1297] Why is it?
[time=1298] And it's a question that I ask myself often.
[time=1300] Why is it?
[time=1301] Why is it that a struggling, hurting world strikes me personally at times,
[time=1308] as more of a burden that I sometimes actually work hard to
[time=1315] and make decisions to avoid rather than embrace?
[time=1323] What is that about me?
[time=1325] Why is it at times that a struggling, hurting world sometimes as they or he
[time=1331] or she represent themselves to me?
[time=1333] Why is it sometimes that I work so hard to stay away?
[time=1337] Instead of seeing it as a life-giving opportunity that should be embraced with hope
[time=1343] and intention and purpose.
[time=1346] Why is it that so many times when I walk onto a plane, one of the first things I think is, "Oh gosh, I hope I get to sit by myself."
[time=1359] Somebody else thinks that too.
[time=1362] And you can say, "Well, Calla, give yourself a break.
[time=1364] It's a plane. You'll never see 'em again as long as you live." Well, you know, I got one for that too, though, because I take my daughter periodically to gymnastics.
[time=1371] And I walk into that room, you know, and it's the same thing every time.
[time=1375] There's this room and there's like five miles of chairs and there's the big window and there's all the moms and some dads in there and the little kids and sometimes not every time, but so many times.
[time=1385] I just want to plot myself in the back right corner, sixth row back, last chair near the magazine rack and just get lost in a magazine.
[time=1398] Blowing them off and sometimes even my own daughter who's in there going, "Why isn't he looking at me? Why is his head in a magazine?" She's bad all the way around.
[time=1406] What is that?
[time=1409] What is it about me?
[time=1411] Why is it that when in personal possession of the only life-giving remedy
[time=1418] offered to the world, I too often find my mouth stays closed, my hands and feet remain still and my heart stays detached?
[time=1426] I've got the cure and I want some magazine time.
[time=1432] What is it about me?
[time=1433] Well, I'll tell you what, I'm selfish.
[time=1435] I mean, let's just be honest.
[time=1436] It's the truth about me too many times in those situations.
[time=1441] I find myself selfish.
[time=1444] I'm short-sighted and my heart at times loses sight of what is eternally at stake in every encounter that God gives me.
[time=1453] And in every encounter He gives you, your heart is given the opportunity.
[time=1458] You are given the opportunity to make decisions.
[time=1461] You know what Jesus says?
[time=1462] You study Him?
[time=1464] And as we've been able to in recent weeks, really, in preparation for our times, look at Him and the way He led His life, the choices He made, the decisions He made, the encounters that He had, Jesus never lost sight.
[time=1476] His heart never loses sight of what is eternally at stake.
[time=1479] Again and again and again He pursued.
[time=1482] We will see Him this morning as the pursuer.
[time=1484] You can write that down, just at the top of your page, whatever you've got a notebook or the bulletin, just write down the pursuer.
[time=1490] And again and again He pursued and made Himself available to those in need.
[time=1495] Magazines would have to wait.
[time=1497] Seeking people were everywhere.
[time=1500] And His redemptive heart, His redemptive heart was ready again and again to reach out.
[time=1505] And I want to invite you this morning to take a look with me at this redemptive heart of His at work.
[time=1510] Let's look closely as we see His redemptive heart at work as He encounters a thirsty
[time=1516] woman in John 4.
[time=1518] If you've got your Bibles, open up to John 4.
[time=1522] Jesus and His encounter with this woman at the well, this Samaritan woman who was so very, very thirsty.
[time=1529] And as you open it, John 4, you might want to just write this down.
[time=1532] What do we learn about Jesus every week now for the next five?
[time=1535] What do we learn about Jesus?
[time=1537] What do we see in Jesus?
[time=1540] What this morning do we learn about Jesus in this encounter?
[time=1544] What do we see about His redemptive heart?
[time=1547] The redemptive hope that was in Him as He lived and walked through His life.
[time=1552] And as He encountered others, number one, I want you to write this down.
[time=1555] First thing we see here in John 4, He exercises redemptive thinking.
[time=1561] There's strategy going on in your life and mind every day.
[time=1564] We make decisions that say, "I'm going to go here or I'm going to go there.
[time=1568] I'm going to go at this time or I'm going to go at this time.
[time=1571] I'm going to go with Him or her or I'm going to go alone." There's redemptive.
[time=1575] There's thinking that takes place.
[time=1577] Every day of your life and mind, we see here in our Lord redemptive thinking.
[time=1581] He exercises redemptive thinking.
[time=1583] Look with me if you would have John 4, verse 1.
[time=1586] Here we go.
[time=1587] "When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John, although Jesus Himself was not baptizing, but His disciples were,
[time=1598] He left Judea." Okay?
[time=1600] You see that?
[time=1601] He leaves.
[time=1602] He is under scrutiny and pressure from these guys.
[time=1606] And He feels it so much so that He chooses to leave where He's at and go to a different
[time=1612] place.
[time=1613] He's under scrutiny and pressure.
[time=1615] He left for Judea and departed again into Galilee and He had to pass through it as in verse 4, Samaria.
[time=1621] And so He came to a city of Samaria called Saikar near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
[time=1629] And Joseph, verse 6, "And Jacob's well," excuse me, "was there.
[time=1633] Jesus, therefore, being weary from His journey, was sitting thus by the well.
[time=1638] And it was about the sixth hour." Footnotes in your Bible may say that was 6 p.m. or noon.
[time=1646] Different Bibles give us some different thoughts there.
[time=1648] But you know what?
[time=1649] Either way, the point is this.
[time=1650] It was a time of day when people would be there.
[time=1656] He's under scrutiny and pressure.
[time=1659] He's wept.
[time=1660] He's tired.
[time=1661] He's weary.
[time=1662] He's worn out.
[time=1663] And I want you to just ask the question this morning.
[time=1665] Where does He go?
[time=1667] More importantly, how does He posture Himself?
[time=1670] Think about it.
[time=1671] At a time when the well would have evening traffic, what's He going to do?
[time=1675] You know what He does?
[time=1676] He goes toward one in need.
[time=1681] He was willing.
[time=1682] You see, you know what, Kelly?
[time=1683] He was Jesus.
[time=1684] He was God.
[time=1685] And He knew how this whole thing was going to play out.
[time=1687] Well, you know what?
[time=1689] You're right.
[time=1691] But in being God in the flesh and in living His life and having these interactions, He leaves for you and He leaves for me a model, an example to follow and think about it.
[time=1702] He goes toward one in need with redemptive intentions.
[time=1706] You say, well, you know what?
[time=1707] He was thirsty.
[time=1708] Kelly, it says there, right in that verse, that He was weary.
[time=1710] Well, you know what I say to that?
[time=1712] I say, He was Jesus and He had all these disciples.
[time=1715] And it would have been very OK, I would guess, for Him to have said to any one of them or all of them, hey, you know what?
[time=1721] I'm tired.
[time=1722] I'm weary.
[time=1723] I'm under scrutiny and pressure.
[time=1724] I'm going to go over here and lay behind this rock under this tree.
[time=1728] Would you guys be willing to please go and get me some water?
[time=1732] To which any one of them most likely would have said, sure, I'm weary.
[time=1736] I'm tired.
[time=1737] I'm under scrutiny and pressure.
[time=1739] Just going to go over here and sit in the recliner with the remote for a while.
[time=1744] No, He pursues.
[time=1747] He pursues.
[time=1749] He moves forward with redemptive intentions.
[time=1752] How about you this morning?
[time=1752] Just ask you right out of the gate here.
[time=1755] How about with you?
[time=1757] Does the redemptive hope that I hope you have in your heart for those that God has brought
[time=1763] into your life or is bringing into your life?
[time=1765] Does the redemptive hope that resides in your heart lead you to make decisions every day as to where you'll go or when you'll go or how you'll go, who you'll go with?
[time=1776] I mean, does it really consume you to the point where it affects and impacts your thinking
[time=1783] and mind?
[time=1785] It did here.
[time=1789] He exercises redemptive thinking.
[time=1791] Number two, write this down.
[time=1792] Then he initiates redemptive discussion.
[time=1799] Verse seven, it says, "There came a woman of Samaria to draw water, and Jesus said to her, 'Give me a drink,' for his disciples." In verse eight, it says, "It had gone away into the city to buy food, and the Samaritan woman therefore said to him, 'How is it that you, being a Jew, ask me for a drink?'
[time=1816] Since I'm a Samaritan woman, for Jews have no dealings with Samaritans." So not only is he under scrutiny and pressure, not only is he weary and tired, but now he encounters a Samaritan and a woman at that, and that culture, that situation just described
[time=1831] would have been fraught with challenge.
[time=1834] Jews despised Samaritans.
[time=1837] Samaritans were viewed by the Jews as half-breeds who had years and years ago begun to intermarry and intermix with other races and nations, and they were absolutely and thoroughly hated.
[time=1849] Samaritans hated Jews.
[time=1850] Jews hated Samaritans.
[time=1851] It was not a good thing.
[time=1853] And you know from our studies in the past that in that day the whole relationship between men and women was not so good.
[time=1861] Men were treated poorly, never would a rabbi in this situation have stooped to or taken the time to dialogue with a woman, much less a Jewish man with a Samaritan woman.
[time=1871] It just wasn't going to happen, but our Lord, he stays engaged.
[time=1876] Our Lord, he stays the course.
[time=1878] He's the pursuer.
[time=1880] And so he asks for some water, and he in doing so in the initiation of the interaction.
[time=1887] In the initiation of the interaction, he does something that we so oftentimes don't.
[time=1895] He gives the opportunity, the chance to progress, and to be furthered.
[time=1900] I was thinking about it this week, how many times my mouth stays closed.
[time=1905] How about you?
[time=1908] And I just started to write down some things, this week just some things that came to my mind, situations that I find myself in, or that maybe you find yourself in.
[time=1915] You know, it's just a question.
[time=1918] Hey, how long have you worked here?
[time=1923] I was just wondering, you know, do you like it?
[time=1926] What's it like?
[time=1928] How long have you worked here?
[time=1932] Pretty easy to say.
[time=1934] Who's thinking about me on planes, and you know, I'm not a complete loser all the time.
[time=1939] Sometimes my heart stays in it, and I sit and I turn and I just sometimes just utter some simple words like, "Hey, you're heading home," or, you know, you're just starting out.
[time=1952] You're heading home, or you're just starting out.
[time=1956] Simple.
[time=1957] Painless.
[time=1958] And I can't tell you how many times the response is, "Well, actually, I'm heading home." Really, like, where's home?
[time=1965] Well, I'll end up in Cincinnati.
[time=1969] Wow, Cincinnati.
[time=1971] What are you doing in Cincinnati?
[time=1973] Well, you know what, off we go.
[time=1978] And then the questions start coming back, and they find out I'm a pastor and they get
[time=1984] real quiet and they want to eat their peanuts.
[time=1989] I'm thinking about me and gymnastics, you know?
[time=1992] The room's full of moms and dads and little ones who want to be in the big room, but they're
[time=1998] not old enough yet.
[time=1999] You know, why couldn't I just say, or why couldn't you just say, "Hey, how old's your little one?" He sure is a cute little guy.
[time=2007] "Oh, two.
[time=2009] Yeah, great." So do you have kids?
[time=2012] "Oh, yeah, I got a few." We got a two.
[time=2016] I mean, just off you go.
[time=2019] "Hey, isn't this like the second year in a row?
[time=2024] Our sons have been on the same team?" I think it is.
[time=2027] I never said hello to you.
[time=2028] My name's Kelly.
[time=2029] It's nice to meet you.
[time=2032] I mean, it's just a question, folks.
[time=2037] It's just a question and you have no idea.
[time=2040] And I have no idea where it goes or where it leads.
[time=2044] I'm picturing you or me, you know, on a driveway, kind of out by the sidewalk, you know, whatever.
[time=2049] Maybe you're spraying off the grass clippings or you're out there raking or something.
[time=2053] I mean, just you and me out in front of the house, and I'm just picturing somebody walking by who's walked by a few times before, and it's you or it's me just saying, "Hey, you know what?
[time=2060] I've seen you walk by a few times.
[time=2062] I just thought I'd introduce myself to you.
[time=2063] My name's Kelly." Maybe it's your break room where you work.
[time=2069] And it's just you saying, "I've seen you in the break room here a few times.
[time=2073] You're new, aren't you?
[time=2074] How do you like it so far?
[time=2076] My name's…" And you know what?
[time=2079] I mean, I'll just state the obvious.
[time=2081] It may lead to redemptive discussion.
[time=2083] It may not.
[time=2084] But if we don't try, we'll never know.
[time=2087] If you don't at least extend yourself with that redemptive hope, just cracking open
[time=2094] the door to see what God may or may not do with it, and what He may do with it may be a three-week deal, what He may do with it may be a three-year deal.
[time=2104] And nothing may transpire, but you and I, what do you say?
[time=2109] Maybe this week, what do you say?
[time=2112] Maybe this week, would you just be willing?
[time=2114] Would you leave this place today and say, "Oh God, please, prompt me, push me, give me the nudge and give me the courage to just open my mouth and just ask a question that
[time=2126] maybe I could ask?
[time=2127] Why don't you write it down?
[time=2130] Make a commitment this morning to before God be sensitive to what He may want you to say or ask in any given situation.
[time=2138] Back to Jesus.
[time=2139] He extends Himself, He cracks open the door, and she throws it wide open.
[time=2145] Number three, He gets the chance to reveal redemptive truth.
[time=2148] He gets the chance, sometimes this happens, folks, we get the opportunity.
[time=2152] He gets the chance here to reveal redemptive truth.
[time=2156] Pick it up in verse 10.
[time=2158] Jesus answered.
[time=2160] She had said, "How is it that you being a Jew ask me for a drink?" Jesus answered verse 10 and said to her, "If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, give me a drink, you would have asked Him and He would have given you living water." She may have been familiar with that term.
[time=2177] She said to Him, "Sir, you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep.
[time=2180] Where then do you get that living water?
[time=2183] You are not greater than our Father Jacob, are you?
[time=2185] Who gave us the well and drank of it Himself and His sons and His cattle?" And Jesus, verse 13, here you go, Jesus answered and said to her, "Everyone, can you picture
[time=2195] Him?
[time=2196] Can you picture Him there at the well?
[time=2197] Maybe He's sitting against it, maybe He's leaning against it, but can you just see Him kind of pointing to this well?
[time=2203] And here's this woman who comes to this well again and again and again.
[time=2207] And He says, "Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give Him shall never thirst, but the water that I shall give Him
[time=2218] shall become in Him a well of water springing up to eternal life."
[time=2224] She's not quite there.
[time=2225] She kind of misses it.
[time=2226] Someone said to Him, "Sir, give me this water, so I will not be thirsty nor come all the way here to draw." We'll stop right there.
[time=2236] In language, she can understand.
[time=2238] Don't miss this.
[time=2240] In language, she can understand and relate to.
[time=2242] He begins to move the discussion from the physical and the literal to the spiritual.
[time=2250] And you and I people, we get this opportunity all the time.
[time=2256] It's just a question of whether you're going to do it or not because the things that they
[time=2262] deal with and the stuff that they struggle with and the things that are in their lives, all the stuff that the people in your world and mine are facing every day.
[time=2271] You and I understand, thankfully and gratefully, that He speaks to that.
[time=2276] And so, He, like He did with Nicodemus, just back a chapter before in John 3, He moves the
[time=2283] discussion.
[time=2284] He says He wants to give her living water.
[time=2286] They're out of well.
[time=2287] She's thirsty.
[time=2289] And He begins to talk about living water, and this is an Old Testament term that she may have or may not have been familiar with.
[time=2297] The phrase "living water," if you want to write this down, means that it means fresh and running a continuous supply and in the Hebrew, that would have been a great deal
[time=2308] to her if she understood that.
[time=2310] I think she did understand that, thus, her response give it to me because I get tired of walking to this place every day.
[time=2316] That living water idea is an Old Testament concept that we see often.
[time=2320] Turn with me if you would back to Jeremiah.
[time=2323] Would you do that?
[time=2324] Turn back to Jeremiah, and let's just see at least one place where this truth gets communicated.
[time=2335] Jeremiah, chapter 2, verses, we'll just look at verses 12 and 13, just after Isaiah, before
[time=2342] you get to Lamentations, Jeremiah, chapter 2.
[time=2348] It says in the second chapter of Jeremiah, verse 12, it says, "Be appalled, O heavens,
[time=2354] that this, and shudder, O, be very desolate," declares the Lord.
[time=2360] For my people, he says, "have committed two evils.
[time=2363] What are they number one?
[time=2364] They have forsaken me." The fountain of, here you have it, living waters.
[time=2369] To hue or to dig for themselves, it says cisterns, broken cisterns that can hold no water.
[time=2377] Two things God says here that these, here he addresses the people of Israel, and this was the story of Israel, all through the Old Testament.
[time=2386] Them trying to dig for themselves new wells that somehow might bring life.
[time=2390] Well, it's the same thing our friend at the well had done.
[time=2396] He hasn't exposed that yet.
[time=2397] We haven't seen it, but he's making his case.
[time=2400] Two things God says they had done.
[time=2402] Number one, they had walked away from living spiritually satisfying water that comes only from God.
[time=2408] Number two, like our friend, they had attempted to make for themselves underground holding
[time=2414] tanks.
[time=2415] Literally, that's what that meant, cisterns.
[time=2419] In those days, they would dig holes and they would line the holes with stretched animal skin that would, in essence, kind of form a container and they would try to or attempt to store water underground for future need, oftentimes though it wouldn't work.
[time=2434] The heat from the sun and the elements around would oftentimes dry up the skin and create cracks through which the water would leak and the attempt would fail.
[time=2444] And they would try again and again and again to quench their thirst with broken cisterns
[time=2450] that never really got the job done.
[time=2454] And we're still trying today, you and me, still trying today.
[time=2461] You and I have tried to find life at many a broken well.
[time=2465] We were sure, you were and I, we were sure that this one was going to bring us life.
[time=2473] We were sure that this one was going to really satisfy and quench the thirst.
[time=2478] And there's all kinds of them.
[time=2481] We try it day in and day out.
[time=2483] We're convinced that more, more house, more house will quench the thirst.
[time=2489] More car, more money, more assets, more leisure, more possessions, more accomplishments, more
[time=2495] accomplishments, more fun, more illicit excitement, more power.
[time=2502] Somehow some way I'm going to find the well that quenches my thirst, that brings to my life the satisfaction that rages, this need that just rages inside of me.
[time=2514] More friends, more recognition, more of a buzz.
[time=2520] You pick it.
[time=2521] We chase after it.
[time=2524] And we say to ourselves, I'm going to find something to quench my thirst.
[time=2527] And at the end of the day, every cistern is broken and you and I are still thirsty.
[time=2536] And oftentimes the thirst even turns to pain.
[time=2542] This Samaritan woman in John 4 is thirsty, physically, yes, she is thirsty and in need
[time=2548] of real water.
[time=2549] She's making history, would tell us, two to three, maybe four trips a day to this well.
[time=2555] But Jesus, the pursuer, sees so much more.
[time=2560] You and I have to be willing to do our very best to see what is so many times there.
[time=2566] So much more than just the physical need and he sees way past it.
[time=2572] He knows there's another well.
[time=2575] He knows her.
[time=2577] He knows her name.
[time=2578] He knows where she's been and he knows there's another well that she's been running toward.
[time=2584] A broken cistern that's leaving her more than physically thirsty.
[time=2588] It's leaving her morally and spiritually empty.
[time=2593] But you know what?
[time=2594] She's not quite there yet.
[time=2595] And so he watched this.
[time=2596] He lovingly, please hear these words, he lovingly yet forthrightly pulls out the scalpel.
[time=2602] And with carefully chosen words, he number four, he exposes her redemptive need.
[time=2611] Write that down.
[time=2612] He exposes her redemptive need with carefully chosen words.
[time=2618] Back to John 4, John 4, 16, 17, 18, and 19.
[time=2628] He says to her, "Go call your husband." He said to her, "Go call your husband and come here."
[time=2638] The woman answered and said, "I have no husband." Jesus said to her, "You have well said I have no husband, for you have had five husbands.
[time=2650] And the one whom you now have, the one whom you're now sleeping with, is not your husband.
[time=2658] This you have said truly." And you know maybe the container did fall down.
[time=2665] You know maybe her mouth did kind of drop open, but I'll tell you mine would have.
[time=2673] And she says, "I love this." He says, "Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet." No kidding.
[time=2681] I mean he just saw right into her soul.
[time=2685] He exposes her redemptive need.
[time=2688] And how did he do it?
[time=2690] Lovingly, but very forthrightly.
[time=2694] I remember just a time, I don't know, it's been a while, maybe a couple of years, found myself in a parking lot with a seeking friend about midnight, I think it was.
[time=2704] And we're in this parking lot and I had jumped out of my car and into his, you see he had called and his life had just completely and absolutely hit the wall.
[time=2710] I mean a hundred miles an hour, it was an absolute mess.
[time=2713] Everybody was gone.
[time=2715] I mean it was not pretty.
[time=2719] And I realized sitting there with him as he wept and moaned and just absolutely flailed that we were sitting in a really, really nice car.
[time=2729] I mean it was brand new and I had never seen it or been in it with him.
[time=2733] But it just struck me that this was probably the nicest rig I had ever seen in my life.
[time=2738] I mean, normal car, it was just amazing.
[time=2742] And as our conversation continued, I also noticed in the console between us a brochure.
[time=2746] And I remember feeling kind of guilty because the brochure caught my attention.
[time=2749] It was a brochure for a resort area that he was on his way to soon and he's over here spilling his guts and I actually kind of got lost in the brochure.
[time=2757] It was so unbelievably attractive.
[time=2760] And I'm flipping through this thing, I can't believe it.
[time=2762] I mean it's stuff that you, I was talking about what they were going to do and where they were going to go and who would take care of you and who would serve you and who, it was just the most amazing thing I'd ever seen.
[time=2770] And then it strikes me that in the back, I knew there was a, because again I knew this
[time=2777] guy who's a friend, I knew there was a new set of sticks, I knew there was a new set of golf clubs back in his trunk, about 2,800 bucks worth.
[time=2787] And I felt that nudge, oh I hate that.
[time=2790] Maybe you hate it too.
[time=2791] You feel that nudge and you just know you should say something and you know it should be direct and you know it should be very clear.
[time=2799] So I just took a deep breath and I said hey buddy, you know what, this, let me just take a couple of things.
[time=2805] This right here, this is an amazing ride.
[time=2807] I don't think I've ever seen anything like it.
[time=2810] People will be in awe of this, this is sweet stuff.
[time=2815] And this brochure, and I held it up right in his face, said this brochure, 99% of the world will dream about but never even come close to see in this place.
[time=2822] I hope you have fun.
[time=2824] And the sticks in the back, I bet they'll shave three to four strokes off your game.
[time=2828] But please don't forget, you're sitting in this parking lot at 12, 30 in the morning,
[time=2834] broken, alone and weeping.
[time=2838] And the words of Jesus and Mark 8 came to my mind and I just asked him, what will it profit a man?
[time=2845] Please tell me, what does it profit?
[time=2849] Those are the words that God, see my words, your words, our words, they serve a purpose, it's the word of God that cuts deep, exposing the heart and the soul.
[time=2860] And he just fell apart, even more so.
[time=2863] Somebody once said, please listen, somebody once said Christianity begins with a clear and painful sense of our own sin.
[time=2869] It begins with the sudden realization that life as we are living it simply will not do.
[time=2875] We awake, I love that phrase, we awake to ourselves and our own futility.
[time=2881] We awake to our need for God, a God whose love is great, whose patience pursues and
[time=2887] whose grace is still amazing.
[time=2889] And people, the woman, our friend here at the well, she wakes up.
[time=2894] It's the great ending to the story.
[time=2897] She wakes up to the realization that the water from any well, it doesn't matter which
[time=2903] well.
[time=2904] She wakes up to the realization that the water from any well, other than the well of personal
[time=2910] relationship with her maker, will never, ever satisfy, never, ever quench.
[time=2919] She was convinced five husbands and a lover later, she's still thinking that a man can
[time=2925] meet her needs.
[time=2929] Or convinced, and I'm convinced of similar things, just as futile and just as empty.
[time=2936] But look what happens.
[time=2939] It takes a little while to get there.
[time=2940] I'd encourage you to read it all today or tonight when you go home.
[time=2943] But look at verse 39 later in the story.
[time=2946] And from that city it says, "Many of the Samaritans believed in him because of the word of the
[time=2955] woman who testified, 'He told me all the things that I have done.'"
[time=2961] Our thirsty friend came to faith in Jesus.
[time=2963] She got her thirst quenched and was able to know and experience the truth of Psalm 63.
[time=2970] Would you turn back there if you would?
[time=2972] Please go back to the Old Testament again, back to the book of Psalms.
[time=2976] Go to Psalm 63.
[time=2977] Our thirsty friend came to faith and it was in relationship with Christ that she was able to know personally and experience.
[time=2985] It is for you this morning, on your journey and on your search, you can know and experience
[time=2993] the reality of Psalm 63.1 where the psalmist says, "Oh God, thou art my God."
[time=3000] "Oh God, thou art my God, I shall seek thee earnestly, my soul thirst for thee, my flesh
[time=3008] yearns for you," and here you go, "in a dry and weary land where there is no," what?
[time=3018] Is there some?
[time=3019] Yes or no?
[time=3021] No.
[time=3022] There is no water in this dry and weary land of ours.
[time=3026] There is only water to be found in you.
[time=3032] And she knew that.
[time=3033] She came to know and experience the truth of Isaiah 55, turn there if you would.
[time=3040] Over in Isaiah 55, the same idea, the same concept is discussed and talked about.
[time=3046] What a powerful passage.
[time=3048] Isaiah 55, 1 through, oh, just the first part of verse 3.
[time=3053] Here the prophet Isaiah says this, so you're there?
[time=3055] Verse 1.
[time=3056] 55, the prophet says, "Hoe, H-O exclamation point, stop, hoe."
[time=3065] He says, "Hey, where are you going?
[time=3069] What are you searching for?
[time=3071] What is it that you're, stop." He says, "Hoe, everyone who thirsts come to the waters and you who have no money come
[time=3081] by and eat, come by wine and milk, without money and without cost, without money and
[time=3090] without cost." What does that mean?
[time=3092] You know what that means, folks?
[time=3093] It means he wants your heart, not your cash.
[time=3098] And it reminds you of me, there's nothing you can buy.
[time=3102] That what?
[time=3103] Quenches.
[time=3104] Here you go.
[time=3105] Why?
[time=3106] Verse 2.
[time=3107] Why do you spend money for what is not bread?
[time=3109] Spend your wages for what does not satisfy?
[time=3112] Listen carefully to me and eat what is good and delight yourself in abundance.
[time=3116] Here it is.
[time=3117] First line of verse 3.
[time=3118] Incline your ear and come to me, period.
[time=3132] He's the pursuer and he pursued this dear woman and he initiated redemptive discussion.
[time=3138] He did some redemptive thinking, he revealed some redemptive truth.
[time=3143] And when it was the right time, he even exposed to redemptive need and you and I have the opportunity to do that same thing day after day after day.
[time=3152] Would you be willing?
[time=3155] Would we be willing together to beg God for the wisdom and the understanding and the sensitivity to be able to do that again and again and again?
[time=3163] Believers, before we leave this morning, those of you that know the Lord, I just got to ask you, are you chasing after any broken cisterns, students, young adults, moms, dads,
[time=3179] those that the other end of the spectrum, nobody's immune, right?
[time=3184] Everywhere you look, this culture and the voice of the enemy, whispers or sometimes yells
[time=3191] to you, this well will work.
[time=3195] Come on, get a little bit of this.
[time=3200] Please run.
[time=3202] Would you just run as fast as you can?
[time=3204] Would you just turn your heart toward what is right and true and would you run as fast as you can away from things that do not quench, away from endeavors that do not satisfy to
[time=3215] him?
[time=3216] Be careful.
[time=3217] Be so very, very careful.
[time=3220] And are you pursuing?
[time=3222] Christ follower, person this morning here in this room who knows and loves the Lord, are you able to categorize yourself this morning as a pursuer, one who has redemptive hope
[time=3234] in your heart for those that God's bought into your world?
[time=3239] Lord has this morning kind of been for you one of those because it's just not happening.
[time=3250] There's nothing going on in that heart of yours.
[time=3253] You don't have a lot of redemptive hope for those in your world.
[time=3255] You don't take a lot of time thinking about where you're going or who you'll go with.
[time=3259] Questions you might ask, things you may need to help expose, boy, I hope.
[time=3264] Others of you here, I know your heart beats in that direction, pray to God and beg Him to keep your heart beating in that direction.
[time=3272] But I hope to think about it.
[time=3275] Others, those of you that are here, and again you know how thankful we are that you're here.
[time=3281] But I'm going to end this morning just by asking you a question and you know what, God's word just asked it of you and I'm just going to repeat it.
[time=3287] Those of you still searching, those of you still asking, why?
[time=3293] Why would you spend money, time, energy, effort, why?
[time=3301] Why would you spend money for what is not bread and all your wages for what does not
[time=3307] satisfy?
[time=3309] Why?
[time=3311] When he offers you in relationship with him, a water that quenches all thirst, living water,
[time=3319] that heals the soul, brings purpose and forgiveness to life, let us talk to you about that.
[time=3326] Maybe this morning's the time for you just to sit with someone that you know or come and talk to us this morning.
[time=3331] Maybe today is the time for you to stop going to wells that don't work and to come home
[time=3338] to the well you were made to be in relationship with, a well that offers living water.
[time=3344] Would you stand with me this morning and let's close on a word of prayer?
[time=3348] And I want to, I want to just say one more thing before we go and let's just not lose
[time=3354] sight of this, okay?
[time=3357] I was amazed, last couple weeks looking through this encounter, there were a lot of things
[time=3364] that amazed me.
[time=3365] I feel like I walked away with a great experience having learned some things and having been reminded of some things.
[time=3372] One thing I want to just share with you this morning, as we look at this encounter that he had with this woman, this, now watch this, this, this tramp, maybe it's how you would
[time=3388] or to be honest, I would have described her in my mind, maybe I wouldn't have said it.
[time=3398] But maybe I would have thought it, five husbands and now shacking up with a guy who's not her husband, tramp.
[time=3408] And I walked away so very convicted this week.
[time=3413] You know, we are so quick to assign verbiage and language and thoughts to people.
[time=3419] And I was reminded this week that he has signed, in essence, one phrase to this woman,
[time=3425] she's thirsty, it's just thirsty.
[time=3431] And please don't forget that you were too, and so was I, and you know what, that's what
[time=3437] thirsty people do.
[time=3440] Be careful, thirsty people beat their kids in the back of cars with video cameras rolling, and we say that, you know, and I understand that feeling thirsty.
[time=3453] Eat people in desperate need, do desperate things, he sees one and his heart goes out.
[time=3461] And my hope is that yours and I would continue to be extended as well.
[time=3465] Father, we thank you so very much.
[time=3467] Again for your word, we are again and again so unbelievably grateful for the truth that it contains and the power that it has to see into our lives and our hearts and point us in directions, God of honor and obedience.
[time=3481] And so would you please give us the strength as we walk out these doors to be a people whose redemptive hearts are full, willing to ask, willing to listen, willing to engage
[time=3492] in the process, God, that you're in control of as you bring people to yourself.
[time=3497] Oh, God, thanks for letting us be a part of that at times.
[time=3501] Thank you so very much for this family, the strength and encouragement that's in this room for me even personally, and I know for so many others, God bring us back together again tonight as we remember and celebrate your sacrifice.
[time=3513] Bring us back together again next week.
[time=3516] And God give us eyes to see those who maybe would come with and be a part, if only asked.
[time=3523] And we'll look forward to seeing what you'll do in the days ahead in your son's name.
[time=3527] We pray.
[time=3528] [AMEN]
