[time=106] (dramatic music) [MUSIC - 338 seconds]
[time=454] (upbeat music)
[time=485] (audience applauding) - Life was so much simpler before I met you.
[time=495] I woke up, ate breakfast, did whatever it was I was supposed to do that day.
[time=501] Eight dinner, checked out the tonight show, and went to bed.
[time=504] Life was all about me.
[time=511] I could justify anything.
[time=513] I mean, I could sit in a bar doing some networking late into the night, you know, when in Rome, or I could do a long lunch without guilt at the company's expense.
[time=524] Or if someone cut me off on the road, I could enlighten him with a few choice words.
[time=530] Well, we all know it's not good to let anger build up.
[time=533] I was sailing through life just fine till you came along with your wave machine and knocked my little boat right out of the water.
[time=543] Oh, it started out innocently enough.
[time=551] You wanted to save me for my sins and take me to heaven with you.
[time=557] Hey, I appreciate that, but now you wanna interfere.
[time=561] Get involved in my life before I even get there.
[time=567] You say you've got some guidelines to live by.
[time=571] I can understand giving help to something poor soul who's at the end of his rope, but come on.
[time=576] You see my life, I have an order.
[time=578] I've got it all together, at least mostly together.
[time=581] So why complicate things by telling me I have to obey you?
[time=586] Have I done such an awful job on my own?
[time=589] Have I?
[time=596] Besides, if you really understood me, you would have never asked that I, okay, you were there when I was growing up.
[time=604] You saw how hard it was to honor and obey my dad.
[time=608] I tried so hard to please him.
[time=611] Did whatever I could to try to make him happy.
[time=614] I remember at first it was fun getting to miss slippers
[time=620] or bringing him his coffee.
[time=622] I felt so grown up.
[time=625] I was Daddy's big helper.
[time=627] Of course, that was when I was good.
[time=631] When I was good, I was very good.
[time=633] When I was bad, I was horrid or so I was told.
[time=638] But as I got older, I noticed it was, why can't you do this better?
[time=646] And stop wearing all that makeup, makes you look cheap.
[time=654] Why aren't you more like Janet?
[time=657] You are such a disappointment.
[time=664] Needless to say he had high expectations.
[time=670] Oh yeah, we were all dad's little puppets.
[time=674] He was in control.
[time=676] And now you want control.
[time=679] You know,
[time=685] you expect a lot.
[time=688] You want me to give up everything, turn it all over to you.
[time=692] But I'm afraid to do that.
[time=696] Surely you can understand that.
[time=699] I know, I know.
[time=706] You say you love me like no earthly father ever could will.
[time=711] I've got no earthly example of what heavenly love is like.
[time=715] And so I fight with you.
[time=718] To keep you in a safe distance and I fight with myself because I don't want to give up control of who I am and what I want and what I do.
[time=728] And so I fight and I fight and I fight.
[time=742] God, I am so tired of fighting.
[time=747] I am so tired of fighting to control my life.
[time=754] Somehow I've got to get over this fear I have of you.
[time=762] Somehow I've got to see you differently.
[time=769] I want to see you for who you really are.
[time=772] I want to surrender my life to you.
[time=800] I feared the waves that you would make.
[time=805] The calm I'd built was now at stake.
[time=813] You came to whisper in your love that waves already crashed above.
[time=823] But therefore, I could not know.
[time=831] Drowning in the calm bell.
[time=838] You raised me in your arms of love.
[time=846] Breathe your life into my lungs.
[time=853] The seas are rough, my bolts steadfast.
[time=857] Amid the storms I rest at last.
[time=861] Stop beating fist against the waves.
[time=869] Surrender to the grace that saves.
[time=876] Take this fight, I throw my hands.
[time=880] Take this fight, my backward glance.
[time=884] I'm lay at your feet above.
[time=888] You are God, you pay my cost.
[time=891] All my games consider love.
[time=896] Take me Jesus, take me love.
[time=910] I offer what I hold so dear.
[time=922] So mold my will and take my fear.
[time=929] I raise to you in trimming hands.
[time=933] My hops, my dreams, and under my cleanse.
[time=938] My pathal heart runs into grace.
[time=945] To claim this gift you took my place.
[time=952] Take this fight, I throw my hands.
[time=956] Take this fight, my backward glance.
[time=961] I'm lay at your feet above.
[time=964] You are God, you pay my cost.
[time=967] All my games consider love.
[time=972] Take me Jesus, take me love.
[time=977] Take this fight, I throw my hands.
[time=980] Take this fight, my backward glance.
[time=983] I'm lay at your feet above.
[time=986] You are God, you pay my cost.
[time=990] All my games consider love.
[time=994] Take me Jesus, take me love.
[time=1013] I surrender all to Jesus.
[time=1031] Take this fight, I throw my hands.
[time=1034] Take this fight, my backward glance.
[time=1039] I'm lay at your feet above.
[time=1042] You are God, you pay my cost.
[time=1045] All my games consider love.
[time=1050] Take me Jesus, take me love.
[time=1056] I surrender all to Jesus.
[time=1075] Father, we come before you this morning of people, many of whom are weary of the fight.
[time=1090] It's a good fight, it's a fight you've called us to fight.
[time=1094] It's life here in a fallen world.
[time=1100] And for some, the weak has been good full of victory and triumph for others.
[time=1104] The weak has been so very disappointing, filled with failure
[time=1110] and the questions and the pain.
[time=1116] And God, I just pray that this morning, as we come before you, as the song just said,
[time=1122] humbly laying ourselves at your feet, that your word and your spirit would comfort us
[time=1130] and that we could find renewed hope, renewed strength in the fact that we come before you
[time=1138] willing and ready and open to that which only you can give, that which only your truth can provide.
[time=1147] Hope and forgiveness, direction, and so God, we come before you, tired of the fight,
[time=1156] but so ready and so willing to see what it is you would have for us this morning.
[time=1162] In your son's name we pray, amen, amen.
[time=1168] Thanks, Corbin. Thank you so much, joy. And thank you for being here. It's so good
[time=1176] to see your faces, so good to be able to be together again in this place, and so exciting to be able to dive back into the series that we've started. Snapshots of a Savior. We find
[time=1186] ourselves in our third week coming this morning to our second encounter. And as you know, we've
[time=1193] been trying to learn from our Lord as we've watched Him encounter others. And we're trying to observe,
[time=1200] we're trying to listen, we're trying to see as we watch Him do this, what it is we can take with us, what it is we need to be reminded of, what new principle maybe we might need to learn for the very first time. And so this morning we come to Jesus and the wealthy young man,
[time=1215] Jesus and the rich young ruler. Let me just read this to you and you can follow along, I think it'll be on the screen. As we study and look closely at the life and ministry of Jesus,
[time=1227] we see that He was characterized by many things. You can stop right there. Several things come to mind. He was compassionate. He was courageous. He was convicting. He was confident. I mean,
[time=1239] the list goes on and on. One of these characteristics, though, would be for sure, clarity. Write that
[time=1245] down. Circle that. Clarity. Jesus, people. Jesus was, He was clear. He was a lot of things,
[time=1253] but one of those things was the fact that Jesus was so very clear. Think about it. Pick a topic.
[time=1262] I mean, just let your mind kind of go and begin to think about different areas of life, different arenas of Christian living. I mean, He was very clear. Think about fighting off,
[time=1273] fighting you and I, fighting off sin. You and I, and what did Jesus say? How did He come at this
[time=1280] idea of you and I and our approach to fighting off sin? Well, look at Matthew. Look at Matthew 5.
[time=1287] It says in Matthew 5.29, this is Jesus. "And if your right eye makes you stumble, tear it out." "Tear it out," He said. "And throw it from you, for it is better," Jesus said, "for you that one of
[time=1300] the parts of your body perish than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. And if your right hand
[time=1306] makes you stumble, cut it off," He says, "and throw it from you, for it is better for you," He said,
[time=1313] "that one of the parts of your body perish than for your whole body to go into hell." Now, we know from our study of Matthew 5 that He speaks here in word pictures. He is not being
[time=1325] literal, but He is being at the same time very, very, what? Clear. Should you fight against sin?
[time=1332] I think so. Can anyone get into heaven? Can just anyone, can just anyone obtain eternal life,
[time=1344] I mean, can you get there your way? And can you get there your way? And can I get there mind? I mean, they're just a whole bunch of different ways to get there. He said in John 14,
[time=1355] 6, Jesus said to Him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life, and no one comes to the Father."
[time=1364] Nobody. Nobody comes to the Father, but through me. Clear. So very, very clear.
[time=1374] He was clear in His own message. You can see that in Mark. You can see that in Mark chapter 1,
[time=1381] at the beginning of this gospel, Mark records the words of our Lord Himself.
[time=1386] And Jesus came saying, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand."
[time=1392] Here's His message. Repent and believe. Repent and believe. Not real wordy, not real complicated.
[time=1401] In the own delivery of His message, extremely clear. Repent, turn, and move away from sin and
[time=1407] believe. Can genuine salvation, I'm just throwing out topics. Just throwing out things that come to
[time=1414] my mind. Can genuine salvation really be evidenced in the life of an individual? What did Jesus say
[time=1421] about that? Can genuine salvation really be evidenced and seen in the life of an individual?
[time=1426] Or are we just kind of left to take it at face value? I mean, if He says He's in, I guess He's in, because He said He was in. Well, He says in Matthew 7. He says in Matthew 7, "You will know them by their what? You will know them by their fruits," He says.
[time=1441] "Grapes are not gathered from thorn bushes nor figs from thistles, are they?" Answer? No. Even so, every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit.
[time=1453] And in verse 18, He goes on to say, "A good tree cannot produce bad fruit nor can a bad tree produce
[time=1459] good. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire." Again, word pictures, but again, a very, very clear message. Very, very clear. Pick your topic.
[time=1473] Choose your issue. He just said it again and again and again like it was. Jesus was clear.
[time=1479] And in this series, we've been looking at these encounters. Again, trying to learn more,
[time=1485] see more, observe more from His own heart. And as we look in today on His encounter with a wealthy
[time=1492] young man, as we look in today on His encounter with a wealthy young man, we are reminded that
[time=1498] before external compliance or the keeping of rules, the Lord requires something far more important,
[time=1504] our full surrender. And as we've said before, eternal life comes when we believe and true
[time=1511] biblical belief embraces not only His salvation, but true belief submits to His lordship as well.
[time=1520] Jesus is very clear about this. Jesus is very clear with this young man who owned much.
[time=1528] You must be willing to surrender it all.
[time=1531] And our question today, my question today is, am I really? Are you really willing to surrender
[time=1546] at all? Today, let's learn about Jesus as Lord. Write that down if you would. Last week,
[time=1552] I had you write down that He was the pursuer. Each encounter will show us something different about Him. Today, I want you to learn about. Today, I want us to see Jesus as Lord.
[time=1562] As we listen in on Matthew chapter 19, you can turn there. If you've got your Bibles, open them up to Matthew chapter 19, verses 16 through 22. And this encounter,
[time=1574] this encounter wonderfully depicted again for us this morning visually, our own Sarah Stole,
[time=1580] again providing kind of a visual backdrop for us. We're so thankful for what she is
[time=1586] doing week after week, producing these paintings that capture the essence of these encounters.
[time=1592] And today you see here again, Jesus, and this encounter with the rich young ruler, the wealthy young man. And we see as we go to our passage this morning that this encounter begins
[time=1604] with a question. This encounter begins with a question. Write it down, number one, the request.
[time=1610] The request, Matthew chapter 19, look with me at verse 16. And it says there, "And behold,
[time=1617] and behold, one came to Him and said, Teacher, what good things shall I do that I may obtain eternal
[time=1626] life?" You can stop there. It's the biggest, it's the biggest, most important, most far-reaching
[time=1633] question of all. It is the most important, most significant question that anybody can ever ask.
[time=1640] I mean, it's a question that you've got to ask. It's a question that so many you know are
[time=1646] asking. And sometimes people ask it internally and sometimes they like this young man, go ahead and just ask it outwardly, but it is the most important question of all time. What must a man do?
[time=1658] What must a man do to be saved? What must a man do to live eternally with God?
[time=1667] Now our passage tells us that the one who comes asking, this is interesting,
[time=1674] the passage indicates that the one who came asking was a young man. You can write that down,
[time=1680] number one, he's young. The passage indicates that the one who comes asking this most important
[time=1686] question of all time was a young man who was wealthy. It says later in the passage that he owned much, he's young, he's wealthy. And Luke tells us in Luke 18, 18 that he was as well a
[time=1697] religious leader. You can write that down, look at it later. It just kind of adds to this composite picture of this young man. He was young, he was rich, and he was a religious leader, part of the
[time=1709] religious elite of that day. And so as you look at this composite picture that gets developed,
[time=1715] we can already say some things about this kid. He was dedicated. He was devout. He was religious.
[time=1725] He was revered. He was well read. He was wealthy. He was prominent. He was looked up to. And he was,
[time=1732] by virtue of his very question, empty. He was all the above. But when it got right down to it,
[time=1742] this young man comes to Jesus and asks him how in the world he could obtain eternal life, because all of that, having been said and done, left him, go back to last week, thirsty, thirsty.
[time=1758] Interesting here in this text, in verse 16 it says, and behold. You see that? Behold,
[time=1765] the use of that word suggests how unusual it was. It's like, wow, behold. Who would have guessed it,
[time=1773] but behold. One came to him and said, teacher, behold suggests how unusual it was that he would
[time=1783] admit he being who he was. He being revered, respected, prominent, part of the religious elite.
[time=1789] The word behold shows you in me how unusual it was that he would come and admit that he lacked
[time=1795] eternal life. Much less and even more unusual is the fact that he would come to Jesus,
[time=1802] the one who was despised by the religious elite, to find it, to ask for it, to seek it out.
[time=1811] That's something else in verse 16 I want you to think about with me this morning before we move on, something else that just kind of caught my attention again this week, and it has to do with the specific
[time=1820] request. What is it that he's asking for? He wants to know how he could obtain what? Eternal life.
[time=1828] Think about that for a second, just that phrase, eternal life. See, I've got to admit to you that
[time=1835] oftentimes when I use that phrase, oftentimes when I myself think about that phrase, eternal life, I oftentimes go to the future. Please realize what this phrase means, though the phrase obviously
[time=1847] carries with it the sense of an everlasting and ongoing future existence in its New Testament usage,
[time=1854] which is about 54 times that that phrase is used in the New Testament. In each of those 50 plus
[time=1862] usages, it always refers primarily to a present quality, to a present quality of life more so than
[time=1871] a future quantity of days. As William Hendrickson insightfully observes, the word life means an
[time=1880] active response to one's environment, and if that's so, then eternal life must mean our active response
[time=1887] to that which is eternal, namely who? God. Just as physical life is the ability to live and move and
[time=1894] respond in the physical world, eternal life is the ability to live and move and respond
[time=1901] spiritually. Eternal life is, first of all, a quality of existence. The divinely endowed,
[time=1908] here it is, the divinely endowed ability to be alive to God and the things of God now,
[time=1915] today and forever. Please be reminded as I was this week that if you know him today,
[time=1925] if you've come to that place of surrender and live today in a relationship with the Lord, we experience, in essence, eternal life now the ability to move and live and respond in the spiritual
[time=1939] realm to be alive to God and the things of God now is eternal life and that will continue forever.
[time=1949] You know what it tells us about the request? What it shows us about the request is that this
[time=1957] young man wasn't looking for fire insurance for later. He was searching for purpose and peace and meaning now. He was searching for purpose and peace and meaning now today. Jesus, what do I need to do
[time=1969] to have real life, real life? And you know what? There may be some of you here in this room this
[time=1975] morning. There may be some watching through TV. There may be many of you who find yourself
[time=1981] today asking that very question. Maybe you've been asking that. Maybe you've been wondering that. Maybe you've been trying to figure that out for days, weeks, months, years. I don't know.
[time=1991] But maybe that very question just resonates in your soul. Would somebody, please, God,
[time=1999] would you please help me understand how to find life, real life? Because this life that I'm leading,
[time=2007] these things that I'm doing, these places that I'm going, the stuff that I'm banking on, it's becoming abundantly clear. More and more so as the days go by that it's not getting it done.
[time=2017] Oh, God, please show me what I got to do to have life. And this is that young, wealthy,
[time=2027] religious leader's question. And Jesus gives him a response. There you see it, number two,
[time=2033] the response, verses 17 through 19. And he said to him, "Why are you asking me about what is good?
[time=2040] There is only one who is good, but if you wish to enter into life, keep the commandments."
[time=2046] And the rich young ruler said to him, "Which ones?" And Jesus said, "Okay, here we go. You shall not
[time=2053] commit murder. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not bear false witness.
[time=2059] Honor your father and mother, and you shall love your neighbor as yourself."
[time=2067] And we'll stop right there. Question for you. Is Jesus all of a sudden changed his theology?
[time=2074] Has he all of a sudden switched and started preaching kind of a works righteousness?
[time=2080] I mean, you kind of look at that and you go, "Wait a minute, a whole time out." Is he saying you get eternal life by keeping the rules? No, no, no, no, not at all. Don't forget,
[time=2092] this is Jesus. And he's not preaching a works righteousness. He's doing what Jesus could so
[time=2099] powerfully and perfectly do. What he does is he looks deeply and he looks intently into the heart
[time=2106] of this empty religious young man. And he sees the one thing that in the end keeps people from
[time=2113] obtaining eternal life. As he looks at this young man, he sees in the core of his being,
[time=2119] because he could see into the core of his being the one thing that keeps him from obtaining it.
[time=2124] It's the one thing that keeps so many of us in this world today from obtaining it.
[time=2130] It's the one thing that keeps people out of the kingdom. Then what is it? Pride.
[time=2136] He looks into the heart and soul of this young man and he sees pride, the lack of humility before God.
[time=2150] So what's he do? Brush him off, cast him aside, give up on him. No, no, he tries to point it out.
[time=2158] That's why all the commandments stuff. He's trying to give his kid a chance. And so he gives him the
[time=2166] last five commandments of the ten commandments. And he could have gone to the great commandment, he could have gone to the great commission, but instead he just goes to these last five.
[time=2175] And he says, "Keep," okay, here we go. "Young guy, bear with me here. Keep the commandments,
[time=2181] keep meaning, keep, adhere to, follow, obey all the time, the commandments." Well, which ones?
[time=2188] The young guy says, and so he tells him. He tells him, which ones?
[time=2194] Verse 20 there, you can just kind of look there in your Bible. The young man said to him,
[time=2201] all these, and imagine saying this, all these things I have kept, what am I still lacking?
[time=2208] And if you just go back through there, I mean, just go ahead and look.
[time=2212] You know, Jesus didn't say this, but you know, in my mind, I go, wow, okay, I'm convinced this
[time=2218] guy's completely deluded. You've never born false witness, you've never lied ever.
[time=2224] The kid's saying, no, I've been doing this since I was five. They've been teaching me this stuff
[time=2231] from the day I could walk, Jesus, I got all this stuff covered.
[time=2234] Jesus must have just been hurting in his heart as the young man continues to just kind of reveal
[time=2242] his arrogance and his pride. You've never lied. You've always honored your father and mother,
[time=2248] always. Well, look at that last one in verse 19, and you've always loved your neighbor as
[time=2254] yourself. That one will come back to haunt him in about two verses. And Jesus knew his heart right
[time=2261] then, and we see his heart right here wasn't ready to surrender and believe.
[time=2271] Oh, he had a deep desire. Don't get me wrong. Please hear this. He had a deep desire for
[time=2278] something significant, something he knew he didn't possess. That's why he comes. That's why as a
[time=2285] religious elite, he comes and he admits, I don't have life. And not only does he admit it, but he comes all the way to this guy who they hated. I mean, there was something going on there, right?
[time=2296] There was a sense of need, right? I mean, that much is clear. His heart ate for personal peace,
[time=2303] for forgiveness, for assurance. But as one author said, he longed for God's blessings.
[time=2311] We see this all the time. He longed for God's blessings, but he did not long for God. He wanted
[time=2318] to do good things, but he didn't want to know the one who was good. He wanted a feeling.
[time=2326] He wanted a feeling. He wanted relief. He wanted calm. He wanted a feeling, not saving faith.
[time=2335] I see this. I encounter this day after week after week after week. People want all of us.
[time=2343] People want relief from their pain. People want relief from their circumstance,
[time=2351] but the gospel calls us to a surrendered repentance from their sin first.
[time=2358] People want relief from their pain, but the word of God calls them to a surrendered repentance.
[time=2364] Notice in the text, okay? Just kind of look back over it. Jesus didn't offer this young man
[time=2370] one ounce of relief. Jesus didn't offer this guy one ounce of relief from that which was moving
[time=2379] in his heart. That which he was longing to have that he didn't have. Jesus didn't offer him one single bit of relief. Instead, he watched. He lovingly gave him an answer designed to confront
[time=2391] him with the fact that he and his pride were an offense to a holy God. He tried so hard
[time=2398] to get the kid to see the one thing that keeps people from eternal life, our pride,
[time=2408] our self-sufficiency, and the fact that somehow we think we're enough.
[time=2412] My mind goes to the Apostle Paul. My mind goes to the Book of Romans, where the Apostle Paul spends
[time=2422] the first three chapters getting us really, really clear on this. It is our sin. It is our pride
[time=2428] that separates us from God. It is our sin that keeps us from this life that this young man was
[time=2434] longing for in chapter one of Romans. Many of you have read that. Some of you have studied that.
[time=2440] Others of you may not have a clue about it. It's fine. You can look at it tonight. Romans 1, Paul goes to great lengths to show that the sin of the immoral man, the debauched, the degenerate.
[time=2451] I mean, there are some whose sin is overt and it is ugly and it is heinous and it is just
[time=2458] despicable. In Romans 1, Paul goes through that whole scenario painting that picture of the immoral
[time=2466] person and their sin which separates them. And then in chapter two, he comes back and he says, "Hey, all you folks who look at the Romans 1 guy with that judgmental demeaning look,
[time=2477] you're just as guilty because you judge him in your heart. You moral, you pious, you got it all
[time=2484] together. Guy or gal? No. You're just as sinful, just as wicked." And then he comes to chapter three
[time=2493] where he ties it all together. The first part of chapter three, Paul says there is, he quotes that passage from the Old Testament. There is none who are righteous, not even one.
[time=2502] And he culminates then in 3.23 for how many have sinned?
[time=2506] How many have sinned? All have sinned. Romans 3.23, he just kind of nails it.
[time=2513] For all have sinned and every one of us, moral, immoral, fall short of the glory of God and it is
[time=2520] that falling short which is produced by our sin that leaves us separated from a holy God in a life,
[time=2528] a life that is really living. Our evangelism, don't forget that. We've got to identify with
[time=2538] folks. We've got to lovingly connect with people. We've got to provide safe places where they can hear a life-changing message. All of that is true. We should serve them. We should love them. We should do our very best to genuinely reach out. But at some point, at some point people, I had to.
[time=2557] You had to, if you know him today, at some point in the evangelism process, at some point as God draws
[time=2564] people to himself, they have to come to grips with the fact that their sin separates them
[time=2571] from the life that they long for and were made to have.
[time=2574] Well, number three, look at the reply. We've seen it already.
[time=2580] The reply from the young man, a reply full of short-sighted pride and ignorance.
[time=2585] The young man says, "All these things I have kept, what am I still lacking?" And Jesus said to him, verse 21, "And Jesus said, 'If you wish to be complete,
[time=2599] go and sell your possessions.'" I love this about Jesus. You know what? He hasn't given up yet.
[time=2603] He's not writing him off yet. I love that about him. I want to be more like that with people.
[time=2611] I hope you do too. He stays at it with him. He says, "Okay, here we go." Jesus said to him, "If you wish to be complete, go and sell your possessions and
[time=2621] give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven and come back then and follow me."
[time=2628] He doesn't say, "You arrogant, ignorant sinner, get out of my face." No, he's the pursuer.
[time=2633] He's patient. Wow, you know what it says in Mark? I love this. It says in Mark 10.
[time=2642] Mitchell reminded me of this in between services. I was so glad he did. Mark 10, 20. Yeah, here it is.
[time=2652] Look at Mark 10.20. Same story from a different author in the Gospel of Mark. This is great in
[time=2660] Mark 10.20. And he said to him, "Teacher, I have kept all these things from my youth up,
[time=2666] and looking at him, Jesus felt a love for him. Jesus, his heart still reaching out.
[time=2674] He doesn't say, "Get out of my face." He doesn't say, "I've had it with you. You ignorant, arrogant sinner." He says, "We'll try this again." And he tries his best to help him see his true
[time=2685] spiritual condition. How does Jesus, with all of his clarity and insight, try and help this guy,
[time=2692] understand and see his true spiritual condition? Well, for this guy, for this guy, it was go sell
[time=2699] all your possessions and give to the poor, and then come follow me for this guy. It was go sell
[time=2706] all your possessions. Hey, what is it for? What is it for you? What is it for you?
[time=2712] And by that I mean this, please, there's symmetry through this whole thing.
[time=2718] When we talk about surrender this morning, as we look at this passage, I mean, the clear indication of the passage is that he's dealing with a young man who has not come to faith.
[time=2727] He's dealing with a young man who was seeking, and he came and asked a question. So there is the
[time=2733] issue of surrender as it relates to your initial surrender. Some of you in this room needing to
[time=2739] come to that point of faith and relationship with him. There are others of you here in the room this morning, and you've made that decision, and yet you know, and I know that the surrendering continues
[time=2751] daily, we're called, to re-surrender and re-give again and again our hearts and our lives and all
[time=2758] that we have to him. So he says to this young man, go sell your possessions because that young man
[time=2766] needed to have some work done in that arena. What about you? Might he say to you this morning,
[time=2773] care about me enough? Might he say to you, care about me, love me enough to surrender your career?
[time=2783] I don't mean quit. I just mean change the focus, alter the motivation.
[time=2790] Might he be saying to you, care about me, love me enough to surrender and lift up to me your career?
[time=2798] Might he be saying to some in this room this morning, love me enough, surrender your heart and life, all of it to me, to the point that you're willing to give up your unsaved boyfriend or your unsaved girlfriend? Care enough about me. Trust me that I know what I'm
[time=2816] doing. When I said to you, don't do that. Don't go down that road. Don't buy into that thinking.
[time=2823] For others of you, maybe he's saying, you know what, would you surrender to me?
[time=2833] Would you really care enough and love me enough to stop writing a check every week that doesn't even come close to representing sacrifice?
[time=2842] Would you stop giving out of your excess and would you love me enough and trust me enough
[time=2851] to really give sacrificially? Jesus says to this young man, go sell your possessions
[time=2860] because this young man needed to. What's he saying to you? He says to him, you want life?
[time=2866] You want real life? I want to give you real life, but there's some things in the way.
[time=2871] There's some stuff blocking the exchange. I want to give it to you, but your pride and your sin
[time=2878] and your possessions are in the way. White knuckling, it's what I call it, just white knuckling life,
[time=2888] the career, the boyfriend, the checkbook, the house, whatever it might be, just white knuckling life. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're God, but I just got a grip on this stuff like the drama depicted because I've never been very good at living life like this.
[time=2905] Here, you take it, you take him, you take her, you take it.
[time=2913] He says you get life. Jesus says you get life with me, whether that's salvation or whether that's
[time=2919] a growing faith. Jesus says you get life with me when all the above, when all that stuff is surrendered fully, not partially, not sort of, not kind of, but fully surrendered to me, given up to me.
[time=2930] Well, those were hard words for the young guy to hear. Look at the result. Number four, the result.
[time=2941] Jesus says if you want to be complete, go sell your possessions, give it to the poor, and you'll have treasure in heaven. Come follow me in verse 22, the result. But when the young man heard this statement, he went away. Yeah, he walked. He bailed. He came seeking. He came asking,
[time=2961] and he was on the right track, and he got a ton of help along the way. But he hears this statement,
[time=2968] the statement that cut to the core of his being. And verse 22 says he went away grieved, grieved. I mean, like really, really hurting. Why? For he was one who owned much property.
[time=2985] In the end, that was it. What a deal. You know what? He didn't want Jesus.
[time=2997] He didn't want Jesus as Savior or Lord. He didn't want to give him his sins to be forgiven or
[time=3003] his life to be ruled. And in the end, the stuff that he owned really owned him.
[time=3009] In the end, he chose to serve things. Wow. In the end, he chose to serve things rather than Jesus.
[time=3024] He came to Jesus for eternal life. He came to Jesus asking for real life, and he left empty, and without it.
[time=3032] Scriptures are full. Absolutely stacked. Because the Scriptures are full of people,
[time=3045] the Scriptures are full of heartbreaking stories. And I read that again this week,
[time=3051] and I studied that, and I looked at that. And you know what? It just broke my heart all over again.
[time=3057] I don't know about you, but you see, I've got some young rulers. I've got some people in my life
[time=3066] who seem to again and again choose that. And I'm not going to give up on them, and I'm going to
[time=3072] keep doing my best to love and extend and reach out. But in the end, people have to make decisions.
[time=3078] Scriptures are full of instances where those kinds of decisions were made. I was so thankful
[time=3084] to just turn over a few pages to Luke 19. And you don't have to turn there, but I just, I got reminded of Zacchaeus. Remember Zacchaeus? Some of you kids remember Zacchaeus, the little
[time=3095] guy that climbed up in the what tree? Sycamore tree. Because he was seeking, right? He was searching,
[time=3102] and he wanted to see who? Jesus. And again, he was the kind of guy who shouldn't have cared, but he didn't care because the call of God was on his heart.
[time=3109] And he said, Zacchaeus, hurry, come down. He looked up and saw Zacchaeus, and he says,
[time=3115] come down. For today, I must stay at your house. There's the pursuer, writing off sinners
[time=3122] disgusted with their sin, distancing himself from them. No. No, I think he was disgusted by their
[time=3130] sin, but he loved and wanted so desperately for their souls to embrace what was true and right.
[time=3137] And he hurried and came down and received him, verse 6, received him gladly, Zacchaeus did.
[time=3142] And when they saw it, they all began to grumble, saying, he has gone to be the guest of a man who
[time=3148] is a sinner. We laugh at that, but be careful. Please be careful how we approach that. Please
[time=3161] be careful how we view that. And Zacchaeus, verse 8, stopped. He's in, Jesus has come to the house.
[time=3172] Now the text would indicate they're in their meeting, their meal time, and it says that Zacchaeus
[time=3178] stopped or in the original language stood up. He had something to say, and he said to the Lord, behold, Lord, half of my possessions I will give to the poor. And if I have defrauded anyone of
[time=3188] anything, I will give back four times as much. And Jesus watched. And Jesus said to him, today salvation has come to this house because he too is a son of Abraham. Don't miss this.
[time=3199] He didn't get saved. Jesus isn't saying that he was saved because he gave away his money.
[time=3206] It's the same thing as the rich young ruler. No, he was saved because he was willing to.
[time=3213] He was saved because that was the heart of one who was willing to be completely and thoroughly surrendered. And in Zacchaeus' case, he embraces. He obtains eternal life.
[time=3224] Well, some things for you to think about, some things for me to consider.
[time=3230] Why don't you just stand if you wouldn't. As we go, I want to just invite you to do something if you would. Just as kind of a symbolic, I don't know, gesture or exercise. Just stay real quiet. Please
[time=3244] stay in your seats. And if you wouldn't mind, if you would just, we won't get carried away with
[time=3251] this, don't worry. Would you just hold out your hands? And don't look at me and don't look at the person next to you. Would you just look at your hands? Would you just do that for just give me, just give me a minute. Would you just hold out your hands? And what some of you in the room this morning who need to know him, some of you here in this room or even listening by TV, if you've
[time=3273] got your hands out, would you just look at your hands and realize that what you need to just see in your hands symbolically is your sin, your humanness. I had to do the same thing 20 years ago
[time=3286] when I realized it was the one thing keeping me from him. Some of you here this morning listening need to just go ahead and place in your hands. I know it's heavy. I know it's ugly.
[time=3296] But your sin, your pride, your humanness, you just set it right there.
[time=3304] And just hold on to that for a second. Others of you here in the room this morning, if you wouldn't
[time=3311] mind just honestly and sincerely before God, would you just place in your hands that you hold out there
[time=3318] in front of you? Your job? Go ahead. See the people. See the business card. See the building.
[time=3325] Your checkbook. That one cuts deep to the heart and soul of you and me. Where's your treasure?
[time=3335] Put your job. Put your checkbook. Put your family. Go ahead. Put their faces right there in your hands. Put your marriage, your friendships, your ministry. Put it all right there.
[time=3346] Put in those hands the things that none of us know about. Go ahead. Look at those hands and go
[time=3353] ahead and put the private struggles of your own heart and soul. And whether again it's those folks
[time=3362] or people whether it's these over here kind of thinking this thing through for the first time.
[time=3367] I'm not going to have you do this but I want you to watch me now. The one thing I love about the westerns, the one thing I love about the cop movies is when the good guys come in and the guns are
[time=3378] drawn and when the guys know they've been had they surrender. The hands just go right there.
[time=3385] I give. Don't do it. I give. And the head goes down and the hands go up and it's over.
[time=3397] And I just wonder at this morning and I won't make you do that publicly but I wonder this morning
[time=3403] and I wouldn't make you do it publicly because there might be some in here who aren't ready.
[time=3407] But we would hope and wish that you would be ready to just lift your hands
[time=3413] and you can if you feel led to but to just lift your hands and just in doing so say to him,
[time=3419] God, my head is bowed. I am laid humbly as the songs of this morning. I am laid humbly before you
[time=3425] and I give these things to you and want to then live like that.
[time=3429] And so maybe whether it's the first time you've surrendered or the 458th time you've surrendered
[time=3438] this week, are you willing to again say to him, I surrender all? Because therein lies eternal life.
[time=3446] Would you bow your heads? Father, we stand before you. Many of us with our hands lifted high
[time=3453] today because we know we are people so desperately in need of what only you can give and what only
[time=3459] you offer and that is life, real life. And God whether it's the first time or the or the or the
[time=3467] 30th time or the 400th time or the 1000th time this month, whatever it might be over here, God on this end, allow us to continue to be a people who are willing to surrender again and again.
[time=3479] And having surrendered God that we would grow, that we would seek out those who could help us, that we would seek out the kind of spiritual deposit into our life so that we could begin to even then live as people surrendered to you with surrendered marriages and surrendered parenting
[time=3496] and surrendered finances, surrendered souls. God, give us strength. Please, God, give us strength
[time=3503] to be a surrendered people. We love you. And we thank you for this interaction with this young man. Our hearts break, that he didn't embrace it, but God, it reminds us of what is true and right.
[time=3514] And so as we leave this place, as Corbin prayed earlier today, God, I pray that we would be transformed because of you, your truth, your spirit, the privilege of being with your people.
[time=3524] And we look forward to being together again soon and all the people agreed and said,
[time=3530] [AMEN]
