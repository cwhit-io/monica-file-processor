[time=161] And I, I'm desperate for you.
[time=177] And I, I'm lost without you.
[time=189] So I'm lost without you, I'm lost without you.
[time=203] I'm lost without you.

[time=547] Hi, I'm Mitch, teaching pastor at Black Hawk Ministries, and I just want to thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour, and especially for this series called "Snapshots of a Savior."
[time=556] Where Steve, Kelly, and I walk through the life of Christ and pull out certain interactions he had with people in the Bible and talk about how that applies to our life today because, you know, Jesus is alive, and we can enjoy that relationship with him today.
[time=570] Thank you so much for joining us, and we'd like to have you come in person.
[time=575] 9/15 and 10/45 is our Sunday morning service times, and we invite you to just come and experience this wonderful worship setting that we have here available for you.
[time=583] I love it, and I would love to put a name with the face, if you could just come and say hi.
[time=587] Something else we're working on here that I would like to invite you to consider is our small group curriculum.
[time=594] We are developing small group questions, Bob Purdy on our staff, is developing small group questions so you can have in an intimate setting with your friends talk about and apply these things that we're talking about in regards to Jesus Christ.
[time=608] You know, I was at an auction yesterday in Kansas City, Missouri, and we auctioned the collector cars of a lifelong collection, and then we concluded the auction with his motorcycle collection.
[time=619] And after auctioned about 30 motorcycles, I came to the very last one.
[time=622] It was the last item of the auction, and it was a 1940 Indian with a side car, and it sold for like $41,000 or $42,000.
[time=629] It was more than all the motorcycles prior to it had brought, and this is just what I do.
[time=634] You know, I thought about, well, why did that happen? Why did that happen?
[time=637] And I came up with two conclusions.
[time=640] The first one was, it was the last one.
[time=642] So it was the only one left, and if you're going to buy one, that was it.
[time=647] And the second reason was, many people perceive value in that Indian motorcycle, and so I do this with my thoughts, and I just invite you to join me and do the same.
[time=658] You know, Jesus is the only way. He said, "I am the only way to experience an intimate relationship, an eternal relationship with the God of the universe."
[time=668] And if that's the case, that warrants, that demands value.
[time=674] So invite you to go to our website and download these questions and grow in your knowledge and perception of the value of a relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=683] Our website is blackhockministries.org, blackhockministries.org, and you can click on small groups, you can download any of the curriculum for any of our small group questions in the snapshots of a Savior series.
[time=696] And you can just do it one time, tell us who you are, and we can email them to you from that point on, and you can be part of this as we develop the small group questions for you over the next few months, and we invite you to participate in that with us.
[time=710] I also like to invite you to come to our Wednesday night services, 645-815. It's acoustic worship, it's interactive, so as we're talking about the life of Christ going through the Gospel of Matthew, you can raise your hand, ask a question, and say, "Hey Mitch, hey Steve, hey Kelly, could you make that applicable to me in my life today?
[time=728] I got this situation going on, and we're trying to model what Jesus taught.
[time=732] We're trying to grow from our study of snapshots of a Savior, and I want to invite you to give us a call beginning October 21st, or come to our website entitled come to hope.com to get your reserve seating tickets for our Christmas with Black Hawk series.
[time=750] We're exchanging the living Christmas tree for an interactive experience. When you come on to our campus, you'll be walking in to the community of hope and interacting with citizens of that community, and the reserve seating tickets that I think they'll go quickly become available October 21st.
[time=766] Our offices will be open 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Thursday, so please do that or get your tickets ordered at our website, come to hope.com. You can also go through our blackhawkministries.org to link to that and get your reserve seating tickets for it'll just be a wonderful presentation of the birth of Jesus Christ.
[time=786] I invite you to come to that, and thank you so much for joining us on the Bible Hour. We just hope that we have been a conduit and continue to be one to deepen your walk and your relationship with Jesus Christ, the living God and Savior of the universe. Thank you so much.

[time=1174] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1181] We continue this morning in our series snapshots of a Savior, and as you know, if you've been around, we're just doing our best to take different encounters that Jesus has with different people.
[time=1192] And be reminded of some things, maybe for the first time learn some things as we observe and listen to Him.
[time=1200] And you know so far in the initial weeks of the series, it's been all of that. We've been able to observe, we've been able to see and listen, and I tell you what I think if I were to describe the first several weeks, most of those interactions have been somewhat cozy.
[time=1215] Most of those interactions have been extremely personal and gentle, inviting. Well, today the heat gets turned up, and today we see a different side of our Lord, Jesus and the Pharisees.
[time=1234] I was a senior in college, playing basketball, just doing the thing I loved most in life at that time of my life, which was playing basketball.
[time=1245] And it was my senior year, and we were probably about three-fourths of the way through the season, and it had been a good season, by and large, and things had been going well for me personally and even for our team.
[time=1257] So by the time we got towards the end of the season, a lot of teams had kind of figured out, or at least thought they had figured out some things as to maybe how to defend against us or prepare for us.
[time=1266] And so anyway, we were at a game, it was an away game, I remember, and we weren't probably maybe ten minutes into the first half, and it dawns on me that wherever I go, there's two guys with me from the other team.
[time=1278] And this one guy, he was talking to me, doing everything he could. He had just determined from the get-go. He was going to get under my skin.
[time=1285] He was talking about my mom, he was talking about my dad, he was talking about my dog, he was talking about my breath, he was talking about anything he could think of.
[time=1292] And it wasn't working, just wasn't working, I was killing him, and he knew it.
[time=1298] And so finally, about ten minutes to go in the first half, we're over here in the corner, balls away from us over in the far corner, which means all eyes are in the fall corner.
[time=1307] So this guy just finally, out of frustration, he just pulls back an elbow as far as he can and he just lets it fly right up under my rib cage.
[time=1315] And every ounce of air I had in me left, quick, and I left with it, I just went to the ground in a heap, I couldn't breathe.
[time=1324] And nobody saw it, so no whistle got blown, and the shot had gone up and a rebound had been made, and off they went down the floor, and I'm in a pile over here.
[time=1332] And as I'm laying there, getting my breath, I stand up and I just went over the edge.
[time=1338] It went where I shouldn't have gone, did what I shouldn't have done, and in my mind I just said, "You know what, that's it." And it was like the whole gym got blurry, and all I saw was that loser down there on the other end with a big smile on his face, and I take off towards him.
[time=1353] There had been a dead ball down there, so everybody's kind of standing around, and I'm just on a beeline to this guy.
[time=1358] Well, as I get to about half court, I notice a buddy of mine playing with me, he's a freshman, young kid.
[time=1365] And he sees me, he sees a look in my eye, he says, "What's that, come with me?" He says, "Absolutely, so we're both coming at this guy." This young freshman kid, he's thinking, "Man, I'm following the leader." So I just, for about half court I start running, he doesn't even see me coming.
[time=1380] It was like, it was like, it was like tee ball, you know, or you set the ball up there and you just have a free shot at it.
[time=1384] I took the guy down, he didn't even know what hit him.
[time=1387] He's against the wall now.
[time=1389] I mean, I'm raring back and firing on the guy, and all of a sudden there's about ten bodies on top of me.
[time=1393] I feel people pulling my legs back, and I just, I hadn't gotten enough.
[time=1397] And the whistles are blowing, and I get tossed out of the game.
[time=1401] The little freshman guy, he gets tossed out of the game.
[time=1404] We head into the showers.
[time=1406] We're back there, the game goes on, we win, they come in, we're already dressed, ready to go.
[time=1412] Coach says a few things to the team, he looks at me, looks at the freshman, says, "You guys have a seat."
[time=1418] They all leave.
[time=1420] I'm thinking, "Man, this is not going to be good." When he comes over and he stands in front of the freshman, and he says, "Hey partner, you can't do that.
[time=1432] Why don't you go on the bus?" I'm like, "That's it." He watches him leave the room and looks at me.
[time=1442] And he proceeded to absolutely light me up.
[time=1449] He chewed me up one side and down.
[time=1452] He said things I didn't think a Christian coach could say.
[time=1456] He absolutely finger wagging, face in my face just read me the riot act.
[time=1464] And in the end just with voice raised and eyes ablaze said, "I am so disappointed in you."
[time=1470] Because you know what?
[time=1471] That kid out there, he's 18 years old.
[time=1475] You, you're a senior, you should have known what better.
[time=1485] All the interactions we've seen so far in this series, I kind of view as being interactions with freshman.
[time=1493] This one, this one, people, Jesus and the Pharisees, these are a group of individuals who should have known better.
[time=1503] And they get a finger wagged in their face, they get eyes ablaze, and it gets really, really uncomfortable.
[time=1511] Jesus and the Pharisees, some of you are sitting here this morning going, "Who are the Pharisees?"
[time=1517] Some of you maybe have heard about them, but forgotten who they were.
[time=1520] These will brief, before we jump in, get a pin out, let's take some notes.
[time=1523] Who are the Pharisees?
[time=1525] The New Testament tells us that the Pharisees were the religious leaders of their day.
[time=1530] They were the experts on God.
[time=1532] They were the spiritual elite of this time.
[time=1535] They were the well read, thoroughly trained and deeply devoted men of that culture.
[time=1539] Whose love for and knowledge of God was to have made them spiritual shepherds of God's people.
[time=1546] These were the guys that were to care for the flock.
[time=1549] They were the dominant religious group in Israel at that time, and they were to have been giving authoritative guidance to these people as it related to the law.
[time=1558] They were the ones who were to be explaining the law, talking about how to apply the law.
[time=1564] These were men who had been put in a tremendous position, a privileged spot.
[time=1570] They should have been the voice of truth, but something went terribly, terribly wrong.
[time=1577] These leaders had become legalists.
[time=1580] That's right, they had altered the law for their own gain.
[time=1584] These who were supposedly deeply devoted had become in fact deeply deceptive.
[time=1589] The ones who were supposed to shepherd had in fact led people astray.
[time=1594] And what did Jesus think?
[time=1598] How did Jesus view these guys?
[time=1601] What was Jesus's heart towards these supposed shepherds who had in fact led people astray?
[time=1607] You know what he was, and you'll see he was furious.
[time=1612] He was furious, and he was saddened.
[time=1616] He was deeply disturbed, and he was completely brokenhearted, all at the same time.
[time=1624] That's right, all at the same time.
[time=1626] We could go to Matthew 5 or Matthew 15 or John 8 to see different encounters he had with these guys,
[time=1634] but let me this morning invite you to open your Bibles to Matthew 23.
[time=1638] Matthew chapter 23, where we'll see again that with those who should have known better,
[time=1646] with those who should have known better, Jesus had some things to say.
[time=1651] Here we go.
[time=1653] You ready?
[time=1655] John, a few things down.
[time=1656] Here we go.
[time=1657] Number one, he was both furious and brokenhearted.
[time=1661] Our Lord was both furious and brokenhearted by their number one.
[time=1665] Write it down by their pride, by their pride, their self-serving, self-consumed lifestyles and ministry.
[time=1673] And I want you to look with me at verses.
[time=1675] It's kind of like verses 1 to 14, but we're going to just kind of make our way through, verse by verse, and as we do that, I'm going to just point out some things to you.
[time=1684] Okay, we'll make some observations as we go.
[time=1687] As we look at the pride that he addresses here in these supposed religious leaders.
[time=1696] First thing I want you to see about pride is that pride is exposed in the self-serving pursuit of authority.
[time=1709] Let's jump in here.
[time=1710] Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to his disciples saying, "The scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves in the chair of Moses.
[time=1719] Therefore all that they tell you do and observe, but do not do according to their deeds,
[time=1725] for they say things and do not do them." Skip down to verse five.
[time=1731] "But they do all their deeds to be noticed by men, for they broaden their phylacteries
[time=1737] and lengthen the tassels of their garments.
[time=1740] And they love, verse six, the place of honor at banquets and the chief seats in the synagogues and respectful greetings in the marketplaces and being called by men, rabbi."
[time=1753] People be reminded this morning that pride is always exposed in the self-serving pursuit of authority.
[time=1759] Let's look at those verses there.
[time=1760] Understand this.
[time=1761] For the Jews, okay?
[time=1762] For the Jews.
[time=1764] Moses was the supreme law giver, the supreme spokesman for God.
[time=1770] And to sit in his chair was in essence saying to those people, "As these men would come and sit in that chair, that very special chair." It was as if they were saying to everyone, "We are the men.
[time=1785] We the guys.
[time=1786] We're it.
[time=1788] Spokesmen for God is incredible." And the sick thing about it is as the text indicates they weren't asked to sit in the seat.
[time=1798] They weren't appointed to sit in the seat.
[time=1800] What does it say?
[time=1801] In verse two, the scribes and the Pharisees have what?
[time=1804] Have seated themselves.
[time=1808] Do you see the drive?
[time=1809] Do you see and sense the desire?
[time=1810] Do you see the hunger for all that that seat brought?
[time=1814] Absolutely.
[time=1816] Pride is like that.
[time=1818] Don't forget it.
[time=1819] Pride always looks for ways to escalate and elevate itself.
[time=1824] Write this down.
[time=1825] Pride's attitude demands altitude.
[time=1830] Pride's attitude demands altitude because pride really thinks that's the best place to be up on top.
[time=1838] Looking down, controlling and governing.
[time=1844] The use of authority, their divine demand, their drive and their demand to be seen had led them to seats of honor.
[time=1851] They hadn't earned nor had they been given.
[time=1854] It was all about recognition.
[time=1856] Listen, don't miss this.
[time=1859] It was all about recognition.
[time=1861] It was all about being noticed.
[time=1864] It was all about power and the control that came with it.
[time=1869] I think part of what so irritates our Lord is that His message was so completely contrary to this.
[time=1876] Go back a few pages to Matthew 20.
[time=1879] What did Jesus say about pride?
[time=1882] What did Jesus say about the chief seats?
[time=1885] What did Jesus say about the way they were to have conducted themselves with these people God had given them to love and care for?
[time=1893] Look at Matthew chapter 20 starting verse 25.
[time=1897] It says there, "But Jesus called them to Himself and said, 'You know that the rulers of the Gentiles, in the way that they rule, they lord it over them.'
[time=1907] And their great men exercise authority over them.
[time=1911] It is not so.
[time=1913] He looks at His guys.
[time=1915] He pulls them aside and He looks at His guys and He says, 'It is not so among you.
[time=1920] But whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant.
[time=1924] And whoever wishes to be first among you shall be your slave.
[time=1928] Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve and to give, to offer, to extend His life.
[time=1939] And His heart a ransom it says there for many." Questions.
[time=1947] Question for you and for me from myself in there with you.
[time=1952] You know I do every time.
[time=1956] Do you ever approach a hallway conversation, wherever you are, you know around here, work your work?
[time=1967] Wherever you might be.
[time=1968] Do you ever approach a hallway conversation with someone important, more excited about what you'll get than the opportunity to listen,
[time=1976] love, and give?
[time=1978] Ever find yourself more excited about the number of people who will see you talking with this important, influential person?
[time=1984] More so than the encouragement and listening ear that important person may desperately need from you at that moment.
[time=1993] Do you ever choose friends or try to choose friends based on what it'll bring you?
[time=2001] Based on where it'll take you, the eyes of others?
[time=2006] You ever do that?
[time=2007] You ever think those thoughts?
[time=2011] I asked myself this week and I'll ask you this morning.
[time=2015] You know when was the last I said, "Kelly, when was the last time?" When was the last time you sought out somebody lonely and unnoticed and said, "Wow, now there's somebody I'd like to hang with?"
[time=2031] When was the last time you opened your eyes and kind of broadened your heart and said, "Wow, God, who's out there?"
[time=2038] That maybe isn't important or influential, but they maybe could sure use a friend.
[time=2046] Ever find yourself like I do at times craving recognition?
[time=2051] Ever do that?
[time=2054] You need to nod your heads more. I'm feeling like I'm out on a limb here.
[time=2059] Ever do that?
[time=2060] Ever find yourself craving recognition and attention?
[time=2063] Ever find yourself doing things you shouldn't to get it?
[time=2068] Like lying?
[time=2070] Exaggerating?
[time=2073] Gossipping?
[time=2075] Flirting?
[time=2081] Are you always right?
[time=2090] I see some husbands taking some shots to the ribs right now.
[time=2094] Ooh, there goes a wife down the back.
[time=2099] Are you always right?
[time=2100] I mean, you know and I know you're not, but you leave people with that impression.
[time=2107] Maybe more than you'd wish.
[time=2109] You're always right.
[time=2111] When was the last time you said to your wife?
[time=2113] When was the last time you said to your husband or a son or a daughter?
[time=2117] I was so wrong to do that.
[time=2121] It was so wrong of me to say that.
[time=2125] I was so wrong to act that way, would you please?
[time=2129] Oh, please find it in your heart to forgive me.
[time=2134] When was the last time you said that to your spouse?
[time=2138] To your son, to your daughter, to a good friend?
[time=2141] Yesterday.
[time=2144] That's good.
[time=2147] Last week?
[time=2151] Maybe getting a little dangerous.
[time=2154] Last month?
[time=2156] Not so good.
[time=2159] You know what?
[time=2160] There's people.
[time=2161] I bump into them all the time.
[time=2163] They don't ever say that.
[time=2165] Do you realize that?
[time=2168] There are people in this life, in this world of ours.
[time=2170] They never say that.
[time=2173] And they somehow expect to be respected and followed and listened to, but they never have enough humility to just look her or them in the eye and say, "You know what?
[time=2183] I'm blew it." Pride is so very ugly, people.
[time=2190] Pride is so very destructive.
[time=2192] You can jot these down.
[time=2193] Proverbs 16, 18.
[time=2195] Pride goes before destruction.
[time=2198] And a hottie, spirit hottie.
[time=2200] I'm better than you, hottie.
[time=2202] I'm superior to you, hottie.
[time=2204] You're down here.
[time=2205] I'm up here.
[time=2206] Pride goes before destruction.
[time=2208] And a hottie, spirit, before stumbling.
[time=2210] Please understand.
[time=2211] Please just see with your own eyes.
[time=2212] It doesn't say pride goes before a kind of sort of bad time.
[time=2216] No, pride goes before destruction.
[time=2219] Carnage.
[time=2222] Bad stuff, people.
[time=2227] Proverbs 11, 2 says, "When pride comes, then comes dishonor.
[time=2230] But with the humble is wisdom." These guys were supposed to be wise.
[time=2237] These guys were supposed to be humble shepherds.
[time=2240] Look at Jeremiah 49, 16.
[time=2242] You know, I've never seen this until this week.
[time=2244] I love it when the Word of God kind of throws up a new truth.
[time=2247] And in all my years, remember what I said earlier about pride?
[time=2250] Pride's attitude demands what?
[time=2253] Altitude?
[time=2254] I'm thinking that through and then I find this.
[time=2256] As for the terror of you, the arrogance of your heart has deceived you.
[time=2261] Oh you, he gets a little attitude in his voice here.
[time=2264] Oh you who live in the clefs of the rock.
[time=2268] Oh you who occupy the height of the hill.
[time=2272] Though you make your nest as high as an eagles, I will bring you down.
[time=2281] You see that?
[time=2282] The high will bring you down from there declares the Lord.
[time=2288] It is an ugly destructive thing.
[time=2291] And though you work so hard to get to that nest, though you work so hard to get to that place of recognition and honor.
[time=2299] God says you completely missed the boat and I will bring you down.
[time=2304] He was furious and he was heartbroken by their pride.
[time=2309] Look at verse 4, we skipped it earlier.
[time=2311] I want to go back to it and I want to show you one more thing about pride.
[time=2314] Pride is exposed, pride is exposed in the willingness to see others burdened.
[time=2320] Pride is exposed in the willingness to see others burdened for the sake of control.
[time=2325] Man, look at verse 4.
[time=2327] And they tie up, the Pharisees he says, they tie up heavy loads and they lay these heavy loads on men's shoulders.
[time=2335] But they themselves, Jesus said, are unwilling to move them with so much as a finger.
[time=2341] Pride is exposed in the willingness to see others burdened, even beaten down so that pride can maintain its control.
[time=2350] Listen to this, the picture that Jesus gives here reflects a common practice of that day.
[time=2355] The loading up of donkeys or camels to the point where it could hardly even move as they traveled down the road.
[time=2362] The owner would walk alongside carrying nothing in his hands, berating and beating the animal.
[time=2369] If it happened to so much as even stumble or bark with no concern for the animal's well-being or welfare, that Jesus said is exactly the way the scribes and Pharisees treated their fellow Jews.
[time=2380] They piled up heavy loads of religious regulations.
[time=2388] They piled up heavy loads of rules on the shoulders of men's until they were unbearable and impossible to carry.
[time=2397] And when the people failed to keep all the commandments, as they were destined to do, they were chided and rebuked by the leaders who thereby, with the chiding and rebuking, added the burden of guilt to the already existing burden of weariness and frustration.
[time=2413] The people were taught that it was only by their good works that they could please God.
[time=2418] If at the end of life the good works outweighed the bad, then God would grant entrance into heaven.
[time=2422] But the scribes and Pharisees offered the people no help in achieving even those fleshly goals,
[time=2429] much less the spiritual ones.
[time=2431] They themselves were unwilling the tax sense to help move those unbearable burdens with so much as a finger.
[time=2437] Here you go, consequently Judaism had become religion.
[time=2442] And all religion produces an insufferable depression, a debilitating sense of confusion.
[time=2450] Judaism had become religion, insufferably depressing, and personally, spiritually debilitating.
[time=2458] You know what these guys hated Jesus.
[time=2461] You know why? They hated him. They despised him.
[time=2465] You know why?
[time=2467] They were so deep into this it was just, it was sick.
[time=2470] They hated him because, and they hated his message of grace and freedom and forgiveness and mercy.
[time=2477] They hated it, and they didn't want it preached to the people because the freedom that came with grace
[time=2483] and the freedom that came with mercy pulled the rug out on their religious system of external works,
[time=2490] a system that kept people subjected to and submissive to who.
[time=2495] God know them, and it was all about them and the power and the control that they could exercise on these frustrated,
[time=2504] depressed, debilitated folks who didn't have a chance because the burdens were so heavy.
[time=2511] And that's the part that's so insane.
[time=2514] That's the part I think that just sent Jesus over the edge.
[time=2518] Do you understand?
[time=2520] They're approached to all this. It was keeping people away from grace.
[time=2525] And when you keep people away from grace, you keep people away from heaven, you send them to hell.
[time=2533] And that's the absolute calamity of religion people.
[time=2540] And you know what? You know us. You know us pretty well by now.
[time=2543] And you know we're not a critical people. I'm not a critical person.
[time=2548] And we don't stand up here week after week and take shots at anybody.
[time=2551] But I've even heard some things lately from some others, some inside and a few outside this place saying, "Hey, you know what? Chill a little bit on the whole religion thing.
[time=2559] You guys have been hammering it pretty hard. You know what? I won't.
[time=2562] I won't chill. We won't chill around here on the whole religion thing." And what we see in our Lord today, the words that He uses, the posture that He takes, the message that He delivers,
[time=2575] convinces me all over again. You know what? It's worth fighting for.
[time=2578] And wherever I see it or wherever you see it, wherever men are putting loads on people that they can't bear,
[time=2586] somehow trying to convince them. And if they could bear it, they might somehow earn the favor of God.
[time=2591] Wherever you see that kind of false gospel, wherever we run into it, we're not going to be quiet.
[time=2598] We're going to proclaim the truth. And we're going to do it our best to do it lovingly, but we're going to be forthright about it.
[time=2605] They were keeping people away from grace. He was furious and brokenhearted by their pride.
[time=2617] Secondly, I want you to see this. He was furious and brokenhearted by their pretense.
[time=2622] Write that down by their pretense.
[time=2625] Chapter 23, in verse 13, it appears as if the Pharisees showed up. Back in verse 1, it's him speaking to the multitudes and to his disciples.
[time=2636] At 13, it becomes very clear that we've got company.
[time=2642] And we don't see it, it's not said, but it's as if having spoken to the multitudes and the disciples, he now turns.
[time=2649] And he squares off on these guys. And all that's been building up just comes out in a divine forthright act of bringing judgment and confrontation to what they were doing.
[time=2666] And 13 is where it starts. I want to pick it up in verse 25, and he uses this phrase, "Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites."
[time=2673] Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites. He uses it seven times. Pick it up in 25.
[time=2679] For you clean the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside they are full of robbery and self-indulgence.
[time=2685] You blind Pharisee. First clean the inside of the cup and of the dish so that the outside of it may become clean also.
[time=2693] Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites. For you are like whitewashed tombs.
[time=2699] Which on the outside appear beautiful, but inside they are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness along any roadway in that day.
[time=2708] Along any path that would be traveled, you would oftentimes come to little miniature kind of like cemeteries, places where folks had been buried.
[time=2716] And oftentimes the stones that were used to mark those graves would be weathered, beaten and kind of worn down, a little dirty, little chipped, so folks would come along and just simply paint them white.
[time=2728] Well that's a nice look. While inside or underneath there's dead men's bones and the decay and the stuff that went with that.
[time=2742] Woe to you. Our first twenty-eight, even so you two outwardly appear righteous to men, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.
[time=2750] Woe to you twenty-nine scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites. For you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous
[time=2757] and say if we had been living in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partners with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.
[time=2763] He says ridiculous. Consequently you bear witness against yourselves that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets.
[time=2770] Fill up them, the measure of the guilt of your fathers. You serpents. Look at him. He says you serpents, you brood of vipers, you snakes.
[time=2787] We've gone to a different level here. You serpents, you brood of vipers. How shall you escape the sentence of hell?
[time=2799] Write this down. Woe to you. Woe to you, he says. In the Greek it was more of an interjection than a word suggesting a cry of angered judgment and pain.
[time=2809] A cry of angered judgment and pain in the whole of New Testament writings. It's used to care the idea of punishment and pity.
[time=2816] Jesus uses the phrase to pronounce judgment. He's not saying damn you in a profane sense. He wasn't wishing for their damnation.
[time=2826] Don't miss this. Simply clarifying it. He didn't want them to go to hell. He was just stating the fact that's where they're going.
[time=2838] Having done what they've done, having abused that which God had given them, having altered the law, shy of repentance and belief.
[time=2849] How in the world he says, can you escape the sentence of hell? Woe to you, hypocrites. Write that down. Hypocrites. Here comes the pretense. Here comes the pretending.
[time=2858] He was both furious and saddened by their acting. That's right. Write that word down. They're acting.
[time=2865] The word in the Greek for hypocrite means actor. The Greek word meant one who put up a false front with the sole intent and purpose of convincing others.
[time=2875] That the false front was real. They had become nothing more than an act.
[time=2880] A sick and pathetic sideshow that had gone terribly wrong and it broke his heart and angered him and it saddened him.
[time=2889] They lacked authenticity. They lacked the things that he himself had modeled. They lacked the things that he longs to see in you and in me.
[time=2900] They lacked authenticity. They weren't real. They weren't genuine. They were fake. And the point is there they were trying to be.
[time=2913] And I don't want you to miss that. It bothers me. I don't know about you, but it really bothers me when I talk to people.
[time=2919] You know, I'll invite somebody to come to church and say, you know what? I'm not going to go to church. They say, I don't do church.
[time=2924] Church is nothing but a place full of a bunch of what? Hypocrites. You hear it? I hear it. And it bugs me.
[time=2931] I say, wait a minute. Time out on the hypocrite thing. Please define hypocrites. He says, well, it's full of people who say one thing and do another.
[time=2937] I say, wait a minute. Wait a minute. If what you're saying is that church is full of people who say one thing and then because they're humans, at times sin,
[time=2946] that's a completely different deal than a church where people say one thing and then get up every day like these guys did and plan to purpose in their hearts to deceive and lie and cheat.
[time=2957] That's a hypocrite. A hypocrite isn't somebody who says one thing and does his best or does her best.
[time=2965] And in the every day of life makes mistakes at points and confesses that and makes that right.
[time=2971] Father's me. It's a big difference. These guys were the latter. These guys were phonies and they meant to be.
[time=2981] Jesus longs for sincerity, authenticity, genuineness. He wants you to be. He wants me to be real, real.
[time=2994] What do I mean by that? I'll just say it to you this way. You know what? Why can't you just be? Why can't I be? Why can't we just be people?
[time=3002] And would we be willing this morning to just commit to? Maybe in a new and fresh way to just be a people who when the cup is dirty on the outside, something spilled over because of some ugly activity inside.
[time=3016] Would you just be willing and would I just be ready to just say to my wife or to say to my friends or to say to you, you know what? The cup's a mess.
[time=3025] Here I am. I'm a messy cup today. I'm ugly and I'm dirty. I get stuff running down the side.
[time=3034] And I just need some help. I need some encouragement. God, I need your forgiveness.
[time=3042] It's so freeing. You know that, right? So freeing to just be genuine and to just be authentic.
[time=3051] They asked me to come a couple weeks ago and speak to the gals, the moms in the mops program, over 70 mothers of preschoolers meeting here every other week, I believe.
[time=3061] I didn't know what to talk about. I didn't know what to say. It was a little late getting over here and I came kind of rushing in and had a seat and had a few moments to think in the back.
[time=3069] I was just racking my brain, trying to think of some deep theological truth to share with mothers of preschoolers.
[time=3075] And I thought, you know what? Forget it. And I walked up there and for just about 15 minutes shared about 5, 6, 7 of my latest failures as a parent.
[time=3086] Because I know they live in the same world I live in. And I just stood there and just shared with them just five or six or seven of the latest failures as a father of preschoolers.
[time=3097] And then said, look at Philippians 3, forgetting what lies behind.
[time=3103] Because sometimes that happens, you know, with you and me, we get so caught up in the failure that we get locked in on the failure and we forget to press on.
[time=3111] So together as mothers and as a dad, we just kind of committed to say, you know what?
[time=3116] We're going to make some mistakes. We've got to recognize them and confess them, but forgetting what lies behind, we move forward. We press on.
[time=3125] And I left that day I felt like a load had been lifted. I felt free.
[time=3132] And I've lived on the other side of that coin and maybe you have too and you know like me how confining.
[time=3138] You know what it feels like to be in the bondage of pretense, walking around smiling when your heart broken.
[time=3147] Walking around acting like everything's okay when it's not.
[time=3153] I say it to the folks here in our team. I say it all the time. I'll always say it.
[time=3158] Comes from the bottom of my heart. I tell folks around here, you know what?
[time=3162] We're not interested in finding people who don't fail. I'm interested in finding folks who fail well.
[time=3169] We're all going to do it. We're not going to mean to. We're not going to purpose to, but it's going to happen.
[time=3174] I don't want people who somehow can keep failure away. I just want to see you handle it well.
[time=3181] I want to see you be honest about it. The cups of mess somebody come give me some help.
[time=3190] Jesus in the Pharisees. You're sitting there this morning saying about this time.
[time=3196] You're saying okay I see the furious. Okay? I see the furious.
[time=3202] I see the confrontation. I see the deeply disturbed Kelly. Where's the, where's the sad?
[time=3207] Where'd you get the whole broken hearted thing? Well let me just show you real quick.
[time=3212] I don't think it'll be on the screen, but look at 2337. After all of that, after saying all of that,
[time=3219] after wagging that finger with eyes ablaze, getting in their face, getting right up close and telling them what he thought and what they needed to hear.
[time=3229] It's like he steps back. It's like he steps back and in 37 there you see it. Oh Jerusalem.
[time=3236] Oh Jerusalem. Who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her.
[time=3244] How often I want it to gather your children together. The way a hen gathers her chicks.
[time=3251] He goes from talking about snakes and vipers and wagging his finger to backing up talking about how much he wished in his heart.
[time=3259] You could have gathered these people like chicks, like a mother hen. How often I wanted to gather your children together.
[time=3267] The way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings and you were unwilling.
[time=3275] You were unwilling. Pride and pretense, ugly, ugly stuff, people.
[time=3285] The coin, one side of the coin says to you and me this morning, we have to be a people who are willing to lovingly and yet forthrightly address it.
[time=3294] The flip side of that coin says you and I better be careful because too often and too quickly you and I can become prideful, pretenders.
[time=3304] Some truth to take home. Write this down if you have to get a pin out still.
[time=3309] Philippians 2, 3 and 4. Exercise humility. First thing I want you to write down is exercise humility.
[time=3316] Exercise humility this week. Read Philippians 2, 3 and 4. And here you go. I'll make it really simple for you.
[time=3323] Some of your minds are already spinning because you know how you can practice humility this week.
[time=3329] Here's some help for you if you're not quite sure. This week, make it a habit of saying to her or to him or to them.
[time=3335] What was what? I was wrong. I'm sorry. This week, read Philippians 2 and make it your commitment to practice, to exercise humility.
[time=3348] Number 2, embrace honesty. Number 2, embrace honesty. Philippians 3, 13, you can write it down.
[time=3355] It's the verse I quoted that I shared with those mothers a couple weeks ago. Philippians 3, 13.
[time=3364] I was wrong. It's how you exercise humility. I just put the sentence together. Watch this.
[time=3370] You want to exercise humility? Say I was wrong. You want to embrace honesty? Honesty? Then say to them, and here's how.
[time=3377] And tell them, say the truth about you, to him, to her. Just admit it. Just say it.
[time=3387] Paul did. He said right there, brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet. Paul was honest.
[time=3395] I have failed. Read Romans 7 sometimes. What I want to do, I don't do. What I don't want to do, I do, he says.
[time=3403] Exercise humility, embrace honesty. Jesus in the Pharisees. Would you stand with me, and we'll close this morning in a word of prayer?
[time=3416] Father, we stand before you this morning, and we can't help but think that you knew exactly months ago.
[time=3426] You knew exactly what we needed to hear this morning. And Father, whether it's been the passionate and heartfelt worship that was modeled and evidenced from children this morning,
[time=3444] and the way that that encouraged our hearts, whether it was the pictures of Angie over seas helping sick people with the love of God, whether it was other worship opportunities that we had or things from your truth here in this message.
[time=3459] God, whatever it is, that we needed to hear. God, I pray that you would impress upon our hearts that we as men and women, we as students, young people, old, middle aged, whoever we are, God that we would walk out of this place.
[time=3475] Very clear, because of your spirit and his work, because of your word and its work that we would walk out of here, very clear on that which we need to give ourselves to this week.
[time=3489] God, I pray that we would be courageous and bold and willing to give ourselves to whatever we need to do, whether that's repentance, whether that's confession, whether that's some new commitments shared with those who will hold us accountable, God, whatever it might be,
[time=3504] to give us the strength to do so. And as we come in contact with others, God, I pray that what we have sensed and experienced here in this room today, that we would invite others to join us to come and hear the life-changing, eternity-altering message of your son to have the privilege of being with and seeing the people of God worship.
[time=3526] God, bring us back together again soon. We thank you for the privilege of worship and being together in your son's name. We pray. Amen.
