[time=435] (gentle music) - Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Blackhawk.
[time=445] And this is my good friend, Mitch Cruz, teaching pastor here at Blackhawk.
[time=449] And we are, as you can tell, a little bit on the casual side today.
[time=454] - We're cash.
[time=456] We're actually heading out on a trip today.
[time=457] So we've got our traveling stuff on, but we wanted to stop by the studio here.
[time=461] And just share with you some things that are going on here in our family.
[time=465] As you know, there are, at Blackhawk, at any given time, so many things happening.
[time=470] And with some very important stuff going on in the days and weeks to come, we wanted to make sure we keep you abreast of those things.
[time=478] - We've got a big one coming up, and it's Christmas with Blackhawk.
[time=481] It's our 26-year, nearly 400,000 people have seen this thing.
[time=485] And each year, it's an original drama set to music.
[time=488] And this year, it's just gonna be incredible.
[time=491] The whole facility will be the stage.
[time=493] And we just wanna remind you that reserve seating tickets are available now in our offices, at our websites, come to Hope.com.
[time=500] And also, the public distribution, the free general mission tickets, they go out November 16th here on our South Campus from 9 a.m. to noon.
[time=508] It's a Saturday, or until the tickets are gone.
[time=511] So definitely, man, get that in your schedule, get your tickets for that, get your reserve seats.
[time=516] If you wanna go that route, but we encourage you to do that now.
[time=519] - Absolutely.
[time=520] - And on today's broadcast, you'll be seeing the end, kind of the culmination of our series that we've been bringing to you each week over the last six weeks.
[time=529] We've called it snapshots of a savior.
[time=532] And today, you'll hear Steve Longbreak, our other teaching pastor talking about the blind man in John 9 and the encounter that our Lord has with him.
[time=541] We've been so thankful for what we've been able to bring you, for what we've been learning ourselves as we've looked at these interactions and observed our Lord and his heart and the way he carried himself.
[time=553] And our hope is today that you'll be encouraged again.
[time=556] In the weeks to come, we're starting a new series called Heroes of the Faith.
[time=561] And we are really looking forward to the chance to look back into the Old Testament.
[time=566] And we've identified several Old Testament figures, some men who followed God, who loved God, some who fell, but were willing in their hearts to come back and pursue him even more so.
[time=580] And there are things that we learn and we see from these guys as they live out their faith and their love for God.
[time=586] So we just want you to look forward to that.
[time=588] Heroes of the Faith, starting in just a week or so.
[time=591] And that's gonna be a good time.
[time=592] - You know what else you can do there?
[time=595] Is go to our site, blackhotministries.org.
[time=598] And we have developed, Bob Pretty on our staff has just developed a wonderful series of small group questions.
[time=603] So we sit around and we talk and we'd ask questions about how are we gonna apply this?
[time=609] Knowing this about Jesus, how are we gonna apply this to our lives?
[time=611] And now knowing this about this particular hero of the Old Testament, how are we gonna apply that to our lives?
[time=618] And they're just great questions there that you can download 'em once, let us know who you are and you'll get 'em sent to you and you can build your intimacy with God.
[time=624] You never have to do it more than once and then we'll email 'em to you.
[time=627] - Fantastic.
[time=628] You sound like you know about all this computer things.
[time=632] I am techno man, a lot of people don't realize it.
[time=635] - Well, I'm not, I'm a techno wannabe.
[time=636] - Help me download or whatever it is you were talking about.
[time=640] Anyway, last thing for you, as you look at this broadcast today, as you're watching it there at home, we wanna just continue to invite you.
[time=649] So many have taken us up on this.
[time=651] It just encourages us to say this to you again.
[time=654] As you watch this today, you know and I know there's still time for you to come and join us and to experience what God is doing in this place with His people.
[time=664] And there's nothing like experiencing the people of God and the word of God and the spirit of God at work live.
[time=673] And so we're so thankful you're tuning in if there's any possibility of you coming and joining us, maybe even coming down afterwards and introducing yourself to us.
[time=682] We'd love to meet you and God bless ya.
[time=684] And we hope to-- - It's what I did.
[time=686] - It's what, that's right.
[time=687] - And look what happened.
[time=688] - You watch the Bible hour?
[time=690] We met and all of a sudden here he is doing his thing.
[time=692] So you never know what might happen.
[time=693] Have a great day.
[time=694] [MUSIC - 107 seconds]
[time=805] And he was a few years old, and he was delivered up to die.
[time=813] But in the power of heaven, he rose from the grave, and he proved.
[time=822] He was, he was.
[time=834] Some write him off as a figment of history.
[time=839] Some say he's only a crutch for the week.
[time=844] And some say he'll always be shrouded in mystery, but every man needs to understand.
[time=854] And he is the answer to all you've been longing for.
[time=866] He is the truth that will ever endure.
[time=871] And he is the light that will last for eternity.
[time=877] And he is, you've got to know that he is the way that he is.
[time=887] He is the Son of God, only one shepherd, Messiah.
[time=892] Eternal life, peace of mind, that's who he is.
[time=897] The Son of God, only one shepherd, Messiah.
[time=903] Eternal life, peace of mind, that's who he is.
[time=917] I hope you know who he is this morning.
[time=921] All of that music led me to the throne.
[time=928] And the reality is, gods of people know who he was.
[time=933] All kinds of folks know about him.
[time=936] They have knowledge that really fills their head.
[time=939] Some of them are filling churches up every day.
[time=943] And some of them don't know who he is.
[time=945] They know who he was.
[time=947] They know about this man that was here that claimed to be God.
[time=950] My hope is today that we'll discover that you know who he is.
[time=956] Personally, you have a relationship with him or you'll want to.
[time=961] One of those two things.
[time=964] I was in about the fourth grade when they took us to the Ohio caverns.
[time=974] You know, elementary kids go to caverns.
[time=977] Where they talk mom and dad into stopping at the caves on the way to Florida or something.
[time=981] But I remember we went over there on the bus and all the instructions about being careful.
[time=988] We go into this cavern and we start walking down the steps.
[time=991] And there are these little lights hanging along the wall of the cave with these.
[time=997] I can remember it well.
[time=999] Yeah.
[time=1000] It's the protected, them little plastic things.
[time=1002] You can see the electrical cord all the way down as you went down there.
[time=1007] And we got down there pretty deep.
[time=1010] And our tour guide said okay now don't panic.
[time=1013] Get ready.
[time=1014] What we're going to do is we're going to turn the lights out in a little bit so you'll experience real darkness.
[time=1021] I thought I'd experienced darkness before because I'd been in the dark.
[time=1026] But in this cave way down there when the lights went out, it was so dark you could see absolutely nothing.
[time=1035] He said put your hand as close to your face as you can.
[time=1039] And open your eyes wide open so that as much light as possible could get in if there was any.
[time=1044] And see if you can sense the shadow of your hand.
[time=1046] I couldn't.
[time=1047] If you do that right now, close your eyes.
[time=1049] When you get your hand up there you can tell it gets a little darker.
[time=1052] Not in that cave.
[time=1053] Absolutely pitch dark.
[time=1058] And he must have left the lights off a little bit too long because some of the fourth graders, well not me, I was really pretty strong.
[time=1064] But some of the fourth graders were getting a little panicking.
[time=1067] And you're sort of reverting back to their three-year-old cry, you know?
[time=1072] Scared because we don't know what it's like to live in the dark.
[time=1078] But this guy in John chapter 9 did.
[time=1082] John chapter 9.
[time=1084] Had a guy sitting over here at the piano this week in chapel.
[time=1087] His name's Duncan.
[time=1089] Duncan's been blind since birth and he travels around to churches and schools doing chapels and church services
[time=1096] and playing the piano and singing.
[time=1098] And so we had a chance to ask some questions.
[time=1100] And I said, Duncan, what would you like me to tell him about John chapter 9?
[time=1104] I thought he might know the passage he did.
[time=1108] He said, tell him this.
[time=1111] He said, tell them that when the disciples asked Jesus why the guy was born blind, whose sin it was, he said, tell them that other people have done that to me.
[time=1124] Other people have said it's either my father's sin or my sin.
[time=1128] And he goes, tell them that those people that believe that way are really short-sighted.
[time=1132] I thought that was a good play on words for the blind man.
[time=1136] Duncan said, tell them that people who try to attach some kind of sin to that.
[time=1140] Now you know what? The Bible says that that's possible.
[time=1142] Sometimes that's happened. The sins of the fathers show up in the sons and the daughters and the grandchildren.
[time=1152] But in this case, Jesus said absolutely not.
[time=1156] Look at John chapter 9.
[time=1160] As he went along, he saw a man blind from birth.
[time=1164] His disciples asked him, Rabbi, who sinned this man or his parents?
[time=1168] That he was born blind. Neither this man nor his parents sin said Jesus.
[time=1172] But this happened so that the work of God might be displayed in his life.
[time=1176] As long as it is day, we must do the work of him who sent me.
[time=1180] Night is coming when no one can work. While I am in the world, I am the light of the world. Having said this, he spit on the ground, made some mud with a saliva, and put it on the man's eyes. "Go," he told him, "washing the pool of salome." This word means sent salome. So the man went and washed and came home seeing.
[time=1204] Here we have point one, a blind man physically who's also blind spiritually.
[time=1212] He's blind and he's blind. As we move through this text, we're going to see that number two, he becomes sighted, physically, remains blind spiritually. And then eventually at the end of the passage, he's sighted and sighted.
[time=1228] He can see physically, but better than that, he can see spiritually as eternal life. Jesus did this. Why? Well, he told his disciples why he's going to heal the guy.
[time=1240] So that the power of the living God could be displayed.
[time=1248] He said that guy was actually blind from birth, so Jesus could display the power of God through healing him.
[time=1260] I was thinking about how many times Jesus did that a lot, not just blindness, but did all kinds of miracles. The disciples did the same kinds of things to establish the church there in the first century.
[time=1272] The Old Testament was done over and over again as well. Two came to my mind.
[time=1276] I don't know why these popped into my mind first, but they did, so they're the ones I went to.
[time=1280] In 1 Kings 18, in order to display the power of God, Elijah plunged the worshipers of Baal. Remember that?
[time=1292] Great miracle. He challenged them. He said, bring the hundreds, they brought 450, maybe 850, Baal prophets and priests. Okay. Came together at Mount Carmel.
[time=1304] And Elijah said, let's have a little contest.
[time=1308] You put your sacrificial animal on the altar?
[time=1312] I'll do mine. And then we'll call for our God, mine being the true living God, yours being Baal, false God, to bring down fire and consume these sacrifices.
[time=1324] And so the worshipers of Baal, they got out the bull and they got the thing ready and they prepared it and put it on the altar and they started wailing and crying, begging Baal to rain down fire and consume this sacrifice that they'd put out there for him. And nothing happened. And so they just wailed harder than nothing happened. And then it says, I kind of like this part, Elijah said to them, this is a little bit cruel, perhaps Baal is in deep thought, busy or traveling somewhere.
[time=1356] He really said those words. They cut themselves up and wailed all the more and nothing happened.
[time=1364] It was Elijah's turn. So Elijah had the altar built. He put the bull on there.
[time=1372] He put 12 rocks around it, which was interesting, to represent the 12 tribes of Israel. He was really in the northern 10 tribes, but he included the two in the south as well. I kind of like that.
[time=1384] He put the 12 tribes of Israel around there.
[time=1388] Those stones representing them. And he dug a trench around that thing, really deep.
[time=1392] And then he poured water. He had them bring buckets and buckets and buckets and buckets of water that drenched the sacrifice. The whole altar was drenched.
[time=1400] There was so much water that it filled up the trench all the way around it.
[time=1404] And then he called in the name of the Lord our God and, boom, fire like they never seen before, lapped up all the water, burnt the sacrifice, did exactly what he wanted them to do. Because God was displaying his power to his people. Now those are to his people. His people who have drifted away and been following the teachings of false prophets about Baal.
[time=1428] I thought about that one because it's a big one and I like it. And I like his sarcasm in there.
[time=1432] Perhaps he's traveling. Maybe he's busy.
[time=1436] Then I thought of another one. In 2 Kings, Elisha, the mentor, I mean the mentee, the trainee of Elijah, he is in a really private setting with just a few people around.
[time=1452] He's out with some guys. They're cutting down some trees. And one of the guys that he's with chops in the head of the axe flies off and it goes into the water. And he starts going, oh no! And Elisha says, what's wrong? He says, that's not my axe. I borrowed the axe. Elisha says, where is the axe head?
[time=1472] He said it's out there, pointed in the water. Elisha takes a twig, tosses it in the water and the axe head goes and the guy gets it and he can return it. That's a little deal.
[time=1484] It's just one little pardon. In 2 Kings, I think it's chapter 6.
[time=1488] It's just a little thing. But what a display of the power of God. That doesn't happen around here. You see, he healed the blind man so he could get the attention of the people there, displaying the power of God. What's been on display in your life?
[time=1508] Is he displaying his power around? Are you recognizing it when he's doing it? Is he doing it in your own life? He uses that spiritual and physical, the physical blindness, actually, of this man to display the power of God and then he transitions and says this.
[time=1528] Look at verse 5.
[time=1532] He says, while I am in the world I am the light of the world.
[time=1540] I like every time I see I am, I think about him saying his own name there. God is I am. He says, I am the light of the world while I'm in the world. That man couldn't have any, he had no light. The man was physically blind. He couldn't see light.
[time=1556] But he was in the presence of the greatest light that ever has existed.
[time=1560] The light that was is and forever will be.
[time=1564] Jesus created light.
[time=1568] He and the Father and the Spirit existing before time began were light then. And he then spoke the very light that we see today into existence.
[time=1580] In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. Jesus is the word of God. He's been speaking the word. He said, let us make man in our image.
[time=1592] All three of them there, Jesus, speaking the creation into existence.
[time=1596] In Colossians chapter 1 he says, he is the image of the invisible God, the first born over all creation, for by him all things were created, things in heaven and on earth. Jesus, creator.
[time=1608] He created the light between the sun and the earth.
[time=1624] When they try to date the earth and talk about how long it took for the stars light to get there, it didn't take any time at all. The first light was here when he created it.
[time=1636] He is light.
[time=1640] Interestingly enough in Matthew chapter 5, 14 he's speaking there the Sermon on the mountain. He says that we are the light of the world. While he was here he is light.
[time=1652] When he left, he left us to be light in the world.
[time=1656] He says, don't hide under a bushel. What shouldn't you hide under a bushel?
[time=1660] He goes on to say there, we are to sow they will see our what? Our good deeds. Our good deeds and praise our Father in heaven. Our light is our good deeds done not for our benefit, but for his glory and the benefit of other people. When you express his real love and you do good deeds for other people, it's a display of his power in your life. It's light.
[time=1688] He took a little dust and spit in it. That's not real couth. You know if I was going to have a plan about how somebody was going to heal me, it wouldn't be that one.
[time=1700] But I don't think the guy cared much. As a matter of fact, he didn't even know it was saliva.
[time=1704] He couldn't see it. He took the dust that he'd created, the very dust that he'd created the original man out of, Adam.
[time=1716] He took that, he spit in it, and he put it on the guy's eyes.
[time=1720] Saliva and dust. Genesis chapter 2, Adam was created out of it. He sent him to the pool named sent. I like that. Now this is what happened.
[time=1732] The guy's response, he went, he washed and he saw.
[time=1740] So we have a blind, blind man, now a sighted blind man.
[time=1748] Point 2, he's sighted and blind.
[time=1752] Sited physically now, blind spiritually still.
[time=1760] That's sad.
[time=1764] Be thou my vision, O Lord of my heart, we're saying. Not be else to me, save that thou art.
[time=1776] Thou my best thought by day or by night, listen to this, waking or sleeping thy presence, my light.
[time=1788] That's who he is. But the guy didn't know it yet.
[time=1792] He only knew, he'd had some mud put on his eyes, he obeyed and went and washed in the pool of Salome, and now he can see.
[time=1800] But that's pretty good. That'd be real good.
[time=1804] What if it happened this week?
[time=1808] What if somebody you knew, what if Julie Collins, here in our church, became sighted this week? Can you imagine the buzz around here? Can you imagine what would be going on if she could, if somebody put mud on her eyes and she could see?
[time=1824] Well, this guy had some people around him the way we're around Julie. Let's look at them.
[time=1832] Verse 8.
[time=1836] It says, "His neighbors and those who had formerly seen him
[time=1844] begging asked, isn't this the same man who used to sit and beg?" Some claimed that he was. They were right.
[time=1852] Others said, "No, he only looks like him." Now, can you imagine, would you be one of those? Which camp would you probably be in? Are you one of the skeptical people and you got it? Well, a lot of us are.
[time=1864] If Julie walked up really sighted right now and said, "Are you Julie's twin?" I wouldn't have an expectation that Julie could see. So I understand where it's perfectly natural for these guys to say this.
[time=1876] But he himself insisted, "I am the man." That'd be pretty shocking, wouldn't it, to be there? The others, the neighbors.
[time=1888] Want to know who he is, but have him say, "I'm the man." At that point, he is the man.
[time=1896] "How then were your eyes open?" they demanded.
[time=1900] He replied, "The man they called Jesus, made some mud, on my eyes. He told me to go to Salome and wash." So I went and washed, and then I could see. "Where is the man?" they asked him.
[time=1912] "I don't know," he said. So here's this guy. First of all, he encounters Jesus. He goes and does what he says, and now we'll see in some subsequent verses just how he responds to everybody's inquiry into how this miracle happened. First of all, he says in verse 9, "I'm the man." Then he says, "I did what he said. From the mud to Salome, I washed and I could see." Then they ask him where he is.
[time=1936] He says, "I don't know where he is." Then in verse 15, to the Pharisees, he says the same thing. Look at that.
[time=1944] Verse 15, "Therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He put up mud on my eyes, the man replied, and I washed, and now I see." Still a physical response. It's okay. "The Pharisees ask who is he?" In verse 17, he answers them.
[time=1964] Okay, look at that. Verse 17, "The man replied, he is a prophet." He is a prophet. They turned again to the blind men.
[time=1972] What have you to say about him? It was your eyes he opened.
[time=1976] The man replied, "He is a prophet." Now, again folks, sighted physically, still blinded spiritually, but he knows who he is.
[time=1988] He knows from whence he comes.
[time=1992] He came from God. That's clear to him. He doesn't know he's the Messiah.
[time=1998] So he's a sighted man with a lot of knowledge about religion.
[time=2002] A lot of knowledge about this person who's coming from God.
[time=2008] He doesn't know the Christ. He does know the healer.
[time=2012] He doesn't know he's Christ. He does know this guy had some kind of power that made it possible for him to give him sight.
[time=2020] Verse 25.
[time=2024] He replies again, "Whether he is a sinner or not, I don't know. One thing I do know, I was blind, but now I see when they ask him about who Jesus is again. I don't know who he is, but I know I can see now." Then finally, in verse 30 and 32, 33-32, the man answered when they're talking to him a third time and he says, "Now that is remarkable. You don't know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes." We know that God does not listen to sinners. He listens to the godly man who does his will. Nobody, that's interesting, isn't he? He'd been taught that from the Pharisees.
[time=2062] Nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind.
[time=2072] Verse 32, "Nobody." Verse 33, "If this man were not from God,
[time=2078] he could do nothing. He knows he's from God, but he doesn't know who he is." This other group that was around the neighbors and onlookers, as they look at him, they're skeptical. We looked at that in verses 8 and 9. They're skeptics. I don't blame them for that.
[time=2098] I'd be skeptical as well. They took him to the Pharisees, verse 13. They're the people that were around the blind guy a lot.
[time=2110] As a matter of fact, they were probably around the Pharisees a lot.
[time=2114] There are a lot of onlookers, spectators, fans. As a matter of fact, I was thinking about that this week.
[time=2122] Do you know what percentage of people are watching NASCAR today versus the number of people who are participating in NASCAR today? Or hockey, or basketball, or whatever this is for, the World Series? The number of people that are spectators that aren't in the game, but are enjoying other people being in the game. That's these onlookers and neighbors. None of them healed. None of them even have taken a step to go as far as becoming the Pharisees.
[time=2154] They don't want that much knowledge necessarily. They're onlookers.
[time=2158] I think maybe there are a lot of people in church across the country who are in this camp.
[time=2162] They go all the time. They spectate.
[time=2166] They watch the game. They see other people and they go, wow, that's really something. That's really a spiritual person when they see people react or be proactive in reaching out to people who are lost or hurting. They can spot them.
[time=2182] They're around them. Matter of fact, they're even close to them sometimes. So kind of so it can rub off and they can feel good about it. Places are full of onlookers, neighbors, fans, spectators who, when they see something questionable, they kind of take that to the Phariseical leaders and try to have them figure it out. They're not in the game.
[time=2206] Then they're the Pharisees.
[time=2210] In verses 13 to 16 we see they're the enforcers of their own rules.
[time=2218] Says they brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind.
[time=2222] Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened the man's eyes was a Sabbath.
[time=2230] Therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight.
[time=2234] He put mud on my eyes and the man replied and I washed him.
[time=2238] Now I see. Some of the Pharisees said this man is not from God. Talking about Jesus.
[time=2246] This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath.
[time=2250] At least he didn't keep the Sabbath the way they interpreted the Sabbath should be kept. Or the way they added to the list of rules that God gave about the Sabbath.
[time=2266] The Pharisees are enforcers of their own rules.
[time=2270] And man we can fall into that camp easily.
[time=2278] They know about the truth. They know a lot about them. They know more than most people know about the truth.
[time=2290] And therefore a lot of folks look up to them as they keep their own rules. It's my fear that there are a lot of churches across the country that are being led by people who are making their own rules. And if you've been in churches like that you know what I'm talking about. I was with a guy recently who said to me, he said I understand what you said, we were talking about the debatable issues in 1 Corinthians 8 and Romans 14.
[time=2322] That's a favorite topic of mine. We were talking about that. He said I understand what you say and really I think you're right. I think that God does allow, gives some freedom in some areas that maybe sometimes we are too strict.
[time=2334] He said but the leadership, okay. He said the leadership, now that they need to maintain a higher standard.
[time=2342] That was his words. He said there's a higher standard for the leaders in the church. And I said higher than what?
[time=2350] He's pausing because the answer to that is the Bible.
[time=2356] We were talking about the standards that the Bible had established.
[time=2360] And nobody wants to say higher than the Bible, they can't get those words out of their mouth.
[time=2366] But the Pharisees were like that you see. The Pharisees wrote their own rules.
[time=2370] They added to what God had revealed to them.
[time=2374] And they kept those rules as well as they could to elevate themselves.
[time=2382] Churches who make up their own rules are dangerous places.
[time=2386] I enjoy the health of our church.
[time=2390] I can stand here and say that without a doubt I believe the leadership of this church does not make a list of rules that they can't keep nor you can keep. The only rules we have in our church are the ones that are clearly stated in the Word of God. I really believe that.
[time=2408] We don't have a bunch of Pharisee or people trying to make a list for all of us to keep.
[time=2414] I believe we're healthy that way. I'm thankful for that. I think we're healthier now than we have and I think we've been growing. I think we've been maturing. I think our leaders really understand that clearly.
[time=2426] The Pharisees, enforcers of their own rules, really religious, really appeared to be godly as they defined godly.
[time=2438] And not only were they not godly, they were hypocritical, they couldn't keep their own rules, pretended to, and they were teaching heresy because that's not the truth of the Word of God. Guard yourself against that.
[time=2454] If we start to do that in here, that's what our elders are for. They're to listen all the time and if they hear heresy from up here, they're supposed to come tell us, don't you do that?
[time=2462] You stop it and tell us why.
[time=2466] They were also accusers.
[time=2470] Look at verse 28 and 34.
[time=2474] Verse 28 says, "Then they hurled insults at him, the blind man.
[time=2478] You are this fellow's disciple," they said. "We are disciples of Moses.
[time=2482] We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this fellow, we don't know even know where he comes from." 34. "To this they replied when he said to them, "If this man was not from God, he could do nothing." They said, "You were steeped in sin at birth. How dare you lecture us?" And they threw him out. You know, one of the things that I think you can, you can spot Pharisees pretty easily. They get real holier than thou.
[time=2510] When somebody that's not a Pharisee likes to confront them or correct them, even if you do it as lovingly as you want to, as you can. When you confront people that believe they're right no matter what, they don't receive you very well.
[time=2526] They send you out. That's what these guys were like.
[time=2530] They accuse you. What happens with a Pharisee?
[time=2534] When you put the Pharisee on the defensive, you'll spot it. They go on the defensive right now. They turn it right back on you.
[time=2542] They don't contemplate what you're bringing to them.
[time=2546] They nail you with what's wrong with you.
[time=2550] Then we have the parents, verse 18 through 22. Look at that.
[time=2558] The Jews still did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they sent for the man's parents.
[time=2566] They asked, is this the one you say was born blind?
[time=2570] How is it that now he can see?
[time=2574] We know he is our son, the parents said.
[time=2578] We recognize him. And we know he was born blind,
[time=2584] but how he can see now or who opened his eyes, we don't know.
[time=2588] Ask him. He is of age. He will speak for himself.
[time=2592] His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews.
[time=2596] For already the Jews had decided that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Christ would be put out of the synagogue.
[time=2604] That was why his parents said he is of age, ask him.
[time=2608] More afraid of the Pharisees and the consequences that might come through them than they were thrilled and rejoicing about the healing of their son. You don't even hear them talk about that here.
[time=2624] Wouldn't you think that if you're the parent, you say, yeah, this is my son.
[time=2628] Yes, he was born since birth. Wow, the guy healed him. Unbelievable.
[time=2632] Let's find out who he is.
[time=2636] Instead, they say, ask him. We went out of the loop here.
[time=2640] You know why? Because they're like the onlookers in the Pharisees.
[time=2644] They're watching the game. They know about the game, but they're not sleeping. They know a lot about it. They know enough to know that if you respond and say that Jesus might be the Messiah.
[time=2656] You're out. Knowledgeable people.
[time=2660] Very knowledgeable people. More afraid of the Pharisees and the consequences than they were rejoicing about the condition of their healed son.
[time=2672] Well, now he's sighted physically, but still blind spiritually.
[time=2680] Third point is he's sighted and sighted.
[time=2684] This is good here. Look at John chapter 9, verse 35.
[time=2688] Jesus heard that they had thrown him out and when he found him, he said, do you believe in the Son of Man? Now go back there for a second. Look at what he said. And when he found him, Jesus heard they threw him out.
[time=2704] Jesus sought him out.
[time=2708] Now he did that for me too. He sought me out.
[time=2712] He sought you out or is seeking you out.
[time=2716] If you have ears to hear the truth of the gospel, it's because he's given them to you. He's seeking you out and you can respond to him like this blind guy does.
[time=2732] Says Jesus sought him, verse 35.
[time=2736] Do you believe in the Son of Man? He asked him for verse 36.
[time=2740] Who is he, sir? The man asked, tell me so that I may believe in him.
[time=2748] Jesus said, you have now seen him. Now the guy hadn't seen much.
[time=2752] He's not been sighted very long. He says, you've seen him.
[time=2756] He is the one speaking with you. Now did you get this?
[time=2760] He hadn't ever seen him before.
[time=2764] Remember, he's the guy that healed him, but he just put mud on, sent him off.
[time=2768] So Jesus is not there at the pull of salam. I love this depiction that Sarah did because that's wonderful. Okay? The guy look at that and look on his face. That's beautiful. But not Jesus is there in spirit maybe, but he's not there in presence of the guy when he washes.
[time=2784] And he goes, yeah, I see you. Okay?
[time=2788] Jesus says, I'm the one who did it. It's me. You're in my presence right now.
[time=2792] I'm the one speaking with you. Then the man said, Lord, I believe any worshiped him. Now you guys, why can't the Pharisees hit their knees in his presence and say, I believe they're choosing their own rules.
[time=2808] What in the rich young ruler over here over there, second one in. He chose what he longed to keep his wealth, his status. Pharisees probably did the same thing.
[time=2824] God said, it's hard for rich people to come into the kingdom.
[time=2828] It's harder for a rich man to get into the kingdom than for a camel to go through the eye of a needle. I want to tell you, it's hard for healthy people to get into the kingdom. It's hard for wealthy people. It's hard for people.
[time=2840] It's hard for the best in this world to get into the kingdom because they depend on themselves. It's natural for us to do that. And if we have success depending on ourselves, we aren't longing for the help that we need through Christ. It's hard for rich people. It's hard for the United States. Sometimes I just wish we were just a little bit poorer.
[time=2864] But this guy blind and healed, he comes to Christ like that. I asked Julie Collins this week. I said, Julie, tell me what it's like to be blind like. Is there some spiritual significance to your life because you've been physically blind? She said, oh yeah. She said right away. She said, Julie said, you know, I have to walk by faith in this physical world when other people don't.
[time=2896] She said, my faith grows pretty easily in the spiritual world because I'm already so dependent in the physical world that being dependent on him is easier for me. My faith just increases.
[time=2912] I bounced that off Duncan when he was at the piano. I said, Julie told me that.
[time=2916] I said, is that true? He said, oh yes, no doubt about it.
[time=2920] He was thankful for his blindness because it made it possible for him to cling to the light.
[time=2928] Now this guy is sighted and sighted. Now it's time to rejoice.
[time=2936] If we had a fatted calf that day, we could dump, well I don't care what we did to it and God consumed it. We'd want to do it. We'd want to offer up a sacrifice to him.
[time=2944] They'd give anything probably. Wouldn't you think that? He would.
[time=2948] Verse 35 and 37, Jesus proclaimed the simple truth.
[time=2952] He said, do you believe in the son of a man? And he said, you've now seen him. In fact, he is the one speaking with you. Son of a man is exactly the same thing as saying Messiah. He says, yeah, I believe. Look at verse 38.
[time=2968] Then the man said, Lord, I believe, what do you do? He worshipped him.
[time=2976] Now you guys, I wonder how he worshipped him for the rest of his life. I know nothing about the guy after this point.
[time=2984] How do you suppose his worship was lived out? How do you think he expressed it?
[time=2992] I guarantee you this. If he was dancing, probably nobody was ridiculing him for dancing. I bet he was excited enough to dance. But if he was singing, they didn't ridicule us. Can you imagine how obedient he was? Can you imagine how much he would look for the opportunity to submit to God's will as an expression of obedience and worship to the living God?
[time=3016] The man received the truth, cited and cited and worshipped.
[time=3024] When you really get saved, when you understand your spiritual need and you really believe that God is grace, had Jesus come and die on the cross to pay for your sins for mine, it demands then that I worship him.
[time=3044] My response to him is worshiping him.
[time=3048] But the Pharisees don't. Look at verse 40.
[time=3056] Some Pharisees who were with him heard him say this and asked, "What?
[time=3064] Are we blind to?" Well, I probably ought to read 39. Verse 3 and 9 says, "For judgment Jesus said, 'I have come into this world so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind." Some of the Pharisees were with him, heard them say this, and asked, "What? Are we blind to?" Jesus said, "If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin. But now that you claim you can see, your guilt remains." One of the things you can spot, one of the things that helps you recognize who the Pharisees are, is they claim to have the most insight. What I'm finding is the more I study the Bible, the longer I live in Christ, the more I realize my ignorance.
[time=3112] But Pharisees the more they live, the longer they live, the more knowledgeable they think they really are.
[time=3124] He says, "But now that you claim you can see, you think you have all the knowledge you need, your guilt remains." I don't know, the whole age of accountability thing, when children become accountable for their sin, I don't know that. I do know, with all my heart, that a little baby isn't accountable yet. They don't have the knowledge. You see, in Romans, Paul said, "The law was given to us to reveal our sinfulness." The law wasn't given to us so that we could keep the law.
[time=3160] The law was given to the Jews and to the Gentiles to reveal our inability to keep it.
[time=3168] It reveals that we have a need that the law doesn't but the Pharisees believe they could meet their need through their law keeping.
[time=3180] Jesus proclaimed the truth, the man received the truth, the Pharisees rejected the truth, heard the same message.
[time=3192] They were around.
[time=3196] The onlookers were like that.
[time=3204] The onlookers were there and saw what the Pharisees saw. Matter of fact, some of them saw more.
[time=3212] They spent a lot of time. They knew the beggar that sat by the gate and begged and was blind.
[time=3220] Who are you?
[time=3224] Where do you fit?
[time=3228] Are you an onlooker?
[time=3232] A bystander? One of the ways that I think you can tell that, 1 John says, that you'll know you're a Christian because you really want to be obedient. You're looking for the opportunities to be obedient. Then you know you're a believer. It gives you confirmation in your heart. It says you want to walk the way Jesus walks.
[time=3252] Unlookers hear the news. Some of them say, yeah, I've done that.
[time=3260] I'm going to go to heaven, but they aren't in the game.
[time=3264] There are a lot of onlookers.
[time=3268] Here's the good news. If you are one, I'm not here to point my finger at you and judge your heart for being one. I'm here to say, you don't have to be an onlooker anymore.
[time=3276] You can get in the game.
[time=3280] You can really receive Christ as your Savior.
[time=3284] Die to yourself and begin to be obedient to his lifestyle.
[time=3292] That's the expression of your worship.
[time=3296] Maybe you're a Pharisee.
[time=3300] There are people in churches that are. I hope you're not.
[time=3304] But I'm not here to point my finger at you and kick you in there for being a Pharisee.
[time=3308] These did a pretty good job of that with those Pharisees, but that's what I'm here for.
[time=3312] The good news is, if you've been a rule keeper and you've been making your own list of rules and you've been demanding, you see, I'm telling you, dads, some dads are Pharisees in their homes.
[time=3324] They're making their own lists. It's not a Bible list.
[time=3328] Now, I'm not talking about rules for your family to live by. I'm talking about calling something that the Bible doesn't call sin.
[time=3340] Some dads are Pharisees.
[time=3344] Some dads and moms in the church are Pharisees. But the good news is, if you recognize that you've been one of those people that's making your own list of rules, you don't have to do that anymore.
[time=3356] Because by his mercy, he's not giving us what we deserve. Hell.
[time=3364] By his grace, he's giving us what we don't deserve.
[time=3368] Heaven. And that's good news.
[time=3372] So, if you're an onlooker or a Pharisee or you think you might be today, don't feel, oh, yes, I get it now.
[time=3384] Maybe you're one of the parents.
[time=3388] Maybe you're like them. They're just kind of hanging around in. They don't ever want to be cast out of that group.
[time=3396] They'll walk on the line and stay there.
[time=3404] Or maybe you're already him.
[time=3408] Maybe you're sighted and sighted today. And if you are, then step it up in the game. Be light.
[time=3420] He said, don't hide it under a bushel.
[time=3424] Be light by doing the good deeds that God has called you to do so that he can express himself through you.
[time=3432] And people can come to know Christ and people can grow in Christ.
[time=3436] I'll bet you that guy that was born blind. I'll bet you he was a spokesperson for the kingdom, for the rest of his life. That's what I want to be.
[time=3444] I get to do it up here. But it needs to be done everywhere. Everywhere.
[time=3452] And God will empower you to be a participant instead of a spectator.
[time=3460] He'll fill you with his spirit. And you need to check that rule keeping stuff and all that religion and be in the church. The living body of Christ. I welcome you. If today this has struck a nerve with you. It's something you want to ask about.
[time=3476] Know that you need to pray and receive Christ as your Savior.
[time=3480] We'll be down here. I encourage you to come.
[time=3484] Get in the game.
[time=3488] Our Father in heaven.
[time=3492] You are God. And we are not.
[time=3496] We are created. You are the Creator. You're the healer. We're the healed.
[time=3506] Physically and spiritually. And God, I pray that by your power you would reach into the hearts of any person here, any person on the Bible hour, anybody who hears about this, that you would please Lord, save their souls, renew them.
[time=3524] And please help us to be the light you've called us to be. In Jesus' name I pray.
[time=3532] [AMEN]
