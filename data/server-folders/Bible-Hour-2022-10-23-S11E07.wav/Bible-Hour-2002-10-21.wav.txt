[time=531] - Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=535] And it has almost been a year, about 11 months ago, that we lost our worship pastor here at Black Hawk, Scott Schindler.
[time=544] Many of you are familiar with that story.
[time=546] That wasn't something that we had expected.
[time=550] That was something that has taken this family here at Black Hawk, well, almost a year to continue to work through and wrestle with.
[time=559] But we continue today to be as thankful as we've ever been for the legacy and the heritage that Scott left us.
[time=566] One of the things that he gave so much of himself to was what we've done around here for 25 years, and that is proclaiming the gospel, proclaiming the message of Christmas through the arts.
[time=578] For 25 years, that was called the living Christmas tree.
[time=582] And as December approaches here around here these days, we just want you to know how very excited we are, how looking forward we are to the opportunity to, again, bring this to this community.
[time=595] We're calling it this year a Christmas with Black Hawk, a community of hope.
[time=600] And I just wanted to come to you today and let you know that those some things have changed, those some people aren't here.
[time=606] And though the form of this production has shifted in some ways, we are so much looking forward to the opportunity to with drama and music and with our choir and vocalists, with young and old alike, we can't wait to bring this message of hope to this community and to your friends and to ours.
[time=627] And so I want to just encourage you, come by and get your reserve seating tickets.
[time=632] First chance you get there.
[time=633] Going to begin to go quickly, $10 seats that allow you a little bit closer look or you can come on the public distribution day, November 16th.
[time=642] That's a Saturday and that begins at 9 a.m.
[time=644] and it'll go till noon or whenever the tickets are gone.
[time=648] But this entire family here at Black Hawk is already geared up to do our very best to bring to you the message of hope, the message of Christmas.
[time=657] And so please give it some thought, come and join us, bring some friends and come celebrate a Christmas with Black Hawk.
[time=665] 10%, that's the magic number.
[time=669] - That's the nut, huh?
[time=670] - That's right, that's the nut.
[time=672] 10% of our income.
[time=674] - To go to the church?
[time=676] - That's right, 10% to go to the church.
[time=680] - Say, can we pay that in installments or anything?
[time=682] - That's what we're supposed to do.
[time=684] It's called the offering plate, remember?
[time=686] But you kept forgetting the checkbook every week.
[time=689] - Every Sunday?
[time=691] - Every Sunday for the whole year.
[time=694] Now we have to play catch up.
[time=697] 10% right off the top.
[time=699] - Is that gross or net?
[time=702] - What?
[time=703] - Gross or net, is it 10% of our gross income or 10% of our net income?
[time=707] - I don't know, I think it's gross.
[time=709] - Come on, not net?
[time=711] Surely don't mean 10% of the gross.
[time=714] - Yes, I'm sure it's gross.
[time=716] I know it's gross.
[time=718] What's the difference between gross and net?
[time=721] - Well, look, gross is before they deduct, but wait, net is after.
[time=728] You know what, I forget, it's like sit or set.
[time=732] Does this chair sit or does it set?
[time=735] Or farther, further, is it a mile, farther, is it a mile, further?
[time=740] Or in or into, there's another one that messes me up.
[time=743] Do you put your hand in fish guts or do you put your hand in two fish guts?
[time=748] - That's gross.
[time=749] - What is?
[time=750] - It's 10% of gross, okay?
[time=753] - Net is what you have after taxes.
[time=755] We're supposed to give up 10% of our gross.
[time=760] - That is gross, 10% of everything we make?
[time=764] Certainly, he doesn't mean that.
[time=767] Isn't there something in the New Testament about a net?
[time=772] - That applies only if you're in the fishing trade, you had to go and become a florist.
[time=778] - This is terrible.
[time=779] You know what, let's just get this over with, okay?
[time=782] All right.
[time=784] - 10% of my income.
[time=787] - 10% of what I bring home is.
[time=790] - This is ridiculous.
[time=792] - What does God need with all of this?
[time=794] Doesn't he want us to be able to pay our bills?
[time=796] - Is bankruptcy part of his divine plan?
[time=799] - Yeah, it's in chapter 11.
[time=801] - Oh, we gotta come up with something here.
[time=806] Oh, but, oh, I got it, I got it.
[time=812] - What if I just take all the tithe money down to church and throw it up in the sky?
[time=816] - What?
[time=817] - Hey, whatever God needs, he can keep.
[time=819] - This is serious, Alex.
[time=821] Wait a minute.
[time=824] I've got a better idea.
[time=826] Let's do some massaging.
[time=828] - Massaging?
[time=830] - Massaging the numbers.
[time=833] - Oh.
[time=834] - Time equals money, doesn't it?
[time=839] Why should it be any different for church?
[time=842] What we need are some deductions.
[time=845] Work with me here.
[time=847] - Okay, okay, I'm with you, good, okay, yeah.
[time=851] Well, what about this?
[time=853] We were both in the Christmas program together.
[time=855] - That's right, okay.
[time=857] Okay, that's three hours every Thursday night for two months plus 12 performances.
[time=863] I'll figure this on what you and I make an hour.
[time=866] And don't forget, we offered to pick up those donated pine trees.
[time=870] - That's mileage and wear and tear, good.
[time=872] Wow, you're kidding.
[time=876] Let's do that again next Christmas.
[time=878] Incredible deduction.
[time=880] What else can you think of?
[time=881] - Well, we worked on the Habitat house.
[time=885] So one, two, well, let's call it seven Saturdays.
[time=888] And we brought our own tools.
[time=889] - All right, that's about four hours each day.
[time=893] Wear and tear, ooh, that's a good one.
[time=896] - Okay, okay, get ready.
[time=897] Get ready, I'm with the program now.
[time=899] All right, we set up tables at the Ministry Fair.
[time=903] I substitute taught in Sunday school, what, eight Sundays?
[time=907] We donated ultra flowers at least 20 weeks.
[time=911] We drove the crazy youth group to Cedar Point, that on account, double.
[time=915] - Oh, you bet.
[time=916] - I played a disciple in the Easter program.
[time=921] So you can count the performances and the rehearsals.
[time=924] And wear and tear on your bathrobe.
[time=926] And we took Mitchell Cruz out to dinner and you saw that man put away the food.
[time=932] (audience laughs) - No kidding.
[time=935] What about donuts?
[time=939] We brought donuts to Sunday school a couple times.
[time=942] - Yeah, donuts, good one.
[time=945] Oh, hey, got another one.
[time=946] I can't believe I didn't think about this right off.
[time=949] Usher.
[time=950] - That's right, give it to me.
[time=952] - I Usher, 20, 45 Sundays.
[time=956] That's an hour every Sunday.
[time=958] - Oh, come on, Kelly never finishes the sermon on time.
[time=962] - That's right, two hours.
[time=964] - That's more like it.
[time=965] - There's simple suppers and all those Bible studies and what about mileage driving the kids back and forth to Alana's every week?
[time=974] - Hey, Sunday clothes.
[time=980] Gotta have Sunday clothes, don't we?
[time=982] - Can you bet?
[time=983] - Include dry cleaning, shoe polish and tied.
[time=988] And what about all the time we spent witnessing to people in the neighborhood and invite them to church?
[time=995] That's publicity work.
[time=996] - Okay, how much time do you figure we spent doing that?
[time=1000] - Okay, let's not count that one.
[time=1006] (audience laughs) - We are so close.
[time=1011] - Give me just a couple more, come on, think.
[time=1014] - Geez, well, you bought pancake breakfast tickets.
[time=1019] - That works.
[time=1020] - We donated some clothes to Salvation Army.
[time=1022] What about all those Bob Evans breakfast after church every Sunday?
[time=1028] - What?
[time=1028] - Hey, we talked about the service and that makes it a meeting.
[time=1032] - You're right, okay, one more.
[time=1036] - Oh.
[time=1042] - Family devotions here at home.
[time=1046] - Bible readings around the dinner table.
[time=1054] - Saying prayers with the kids at bedtime.
[time=1061] - Okay, I'm listening, talk to me.
[time=1063] - Honey, that makes this place a house of God.
[time=1067] - Yes, yes.
[time=1069] - Oh, deduct the mortgage, gas, and electric.
[time=1072] - That's it, that's what we needed.
[time=1077] We owe the church nothing.
[time=1080] - Yes!
[time=1081] - We don't owe them a diamond ties, not a Zippo.
[time=1086] In fact, hold on.
[time=1088] They owe us $325.
[time=1096] - Oh, this is great, I'm gonna call Kelly right now.
[time=1101] - Oh, wait a minute, hold on.
[time=1104] - What?
[time=1105] - There's one more bit of business we need to take care of.
[time=1108] - What now?
[time=1109] - The building project.
[time=1111] - But what?
[time=1112] - Don't you remember?
[time=1114] Kelly talked about the new Sunday school building that church needed, and you were so moved by his words.
[time=1120] You told him when we sold our leg property, we don't eat all of it.
[time=1125] Well, we sold it last month.
[time=1128] - I said what, why didn't you kill me before I could speak?
[time=1132] - I tried to tell you to shut up, you wouldn't listen.
[time=1136] - Oh, all of it.
[time=1138] I must have been out of my mind.
[time=1142] Oh, this is terrible.
[time=1145] What are we gonna do?
[time=1146] - How about if we just give 'em half?
[time=1152] (dramatic music)
[time=1188] (dramatic music) - Well, good morning.
[time=1197] It's so good to see you, and we're so thankful for the opportunity to be here with you.
[time=1201] My name's Kelly Bird.
[time=1202] I'm the senior pastor here at Blackhawk.
[time=1204] This is Steve Longbrake and Mitchell Cruz teaching pastors, and we are looking forward to the morning.
[time=1210] Every once in a while, we do this.
[time=1211] We just kind of take a pause in between series.
[time=1215] We just wrapped up the series, Snapshots of a Savior, and next week we'll begin a new series called Heroes of the Faith.
[time=1223] And that's gonna be a great several weeks looking at Old Testament individuals who followed and loved God well, and we're looking forward to that.
[time=1231] But this morning, we're gonna do what we oftentimes do, and that is just pause and kind of consider some things that we as a family need to just periodically be willing to consider.
[time=1240] We wanna talk you this morning about something that's a familiar topic, full surrender, full surrender.
[time=1247] What it means to be fully surrendered, fully given to God.
[time=1251] And we talk about full surrender around here in a number of different areas.
[time=1254] We'll talk often about full surrender in our relationships, full surrender as it relates to ministry, fully surrendered as it relates to parenting.
[time=1264] I mean, there's just a sense of commitment that God calls out of us, and we wanna just pause every once in a while and kind of refresh our minds and our hearts on those things.
[time=1273] This morning, we wanna talk to you a little bit about what it means to be a fully surrendered giver.
[time=1279] What it means to be a people who are really and truly fully open to God and fully surrendered to Him as it relates to the way that we handle and approach this whole area of finances.
[time=1291] The money, the earnings that God allows you and I to have.
[time=1295] And I wanna just draw your attention as we start to Matthew chapter six.
[time=1299] Matthew chapter six, I don't believe these will be on the screen, but you can just read along with me if you want to in your Bibles.
[time=1306] Matthew chapter six, verse 19.
[time=1308] Jesus speaking, said this, do not lay up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves, he says, treasures in heaven.
[time=1322] You see that?
[time=1323] Treasures in heaven.
[time=1324] Verse 21, for where your treasure is, for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
[time=1333] Hey folks, just real clear with you, okay?
[time=1335] Some of you are aware of this.
[time=1337] Some of you maybe are hearing this for the first time, but let us just say this upfront.
[time=1341] As we begin this discussion this morning about finances and money and giving, please understand, God doesn't need your money.
[time=1350] We don't want your money.
[time=1354] Primarily, what God is after, as he engages in life and relationship with us, God wants your heart.
[time=1363] God wants your heart.
[time=1365] And it would be our hope and our desire that we would be a people whose hearts are squarely facing and fully and completely given to him.
[time=1373] Because you know what?
[time=1374] When full surrender takes place in this arena, the arena of giving when your heart is his, when you're laying up for yourselves spiritual investments.
[time=1384] Amazing things happen.
[time=1387] So would you just this morning open your hearts and your minds again and let's be encouraged, be challenged as a people to see what it is God would have for us.
[time=1396] Mitch is gonna start us out with a principle from the Old Testament.
[time=1400] - We just finished this series on snapshots of a Savior.
[time=1404] If you look behind me, these beautiful paintings that Sarah did in each setting, really, is Jesus asking what he asked you and that is give me your heart.
[time=1413] Give me your heart.
[time=1414] And for purposes of today's discussion, we're defining your heart as your entire inner being.
[time=1419] The overall direction of your life that flows out of who you are.
[time=1424] And the first idea here is I own nothing.
[time=1427] God owns everything.
[time=1428] We base that thought and I'm gonna clarify it, but we base it on first chronicles, 29 verses 11 and 12.
[time=1435] Yours, oh Lord is the greatness and the power and the glory and the majesty and the splendor.
[time=1439] Yours, oh Lord is that.
[time=1441] For everything in heaven and earth is, say it with me, yours.
[time=1446] Oh Lord is a kingdom.
[time=1447] Let's go to the next verse.
[time=1449] You are exalted as head over all wealth and honor come from you.
[time=1454] You are the ruler of all things.
[time=1456] You are the ruler of all things and your hands are strength and power to exalt and give strength to all.
[time=1463] So this idea that God owns it all, I don't.
[time=1467] I do agree, I do understand that your names on the title of your car, your truck, your names on the deed of your house.
[time=1474] And those are yours.
[time=1475] And God has allowed you to own those things, but my point is this, the eternal concept of it.
[time=1479] Second Peter 3.10, the verse immediately following after God says through Peter that he wants everybody to come to repentance that says, you know what, all this stuff is gonna burn up someday.
[time=1491] And there's like this layer as thin as an onion skin that keeps the core of the earth from burning us up.
[time=1497] And if you compress the ozone up there, it's a quarter of an inch and that's what protects us from burning up from the sun.
[time=1504] Also people come to repentance.
[time=1507] So the deal is this, I want you to take your hand to do this.
[time=1510] I just think this is the greatest picture of the heart that would be our tendency and our fallenness.
[time=1516] You just kind of turn your fist over.
[time=1518] Let me see if you got those wristbands on, you should put that on.
[time=1521] And you see a picture there on your knuckles.
[time=1523] And that's what Kelly talks about, white knuckling.
[time=1528] And the bottom line is are you white knuckling things that are temporary?
[time=1534] Are you white knuckling things that are in temper?
[time=1537] I know I've done this.
[time=1539] And so I just want you to do this, just turn your hand over again and open it up.
[time=1543] And that's what I'm saying here.
[time=1544] If I can open my hand, it'll allow God to put it in and then it can go out.
[time=1551] It can come in and it can go out instead of white knuckling and trying to hold on to it.
[time=1556] I had this happen to me in business.
[time=1560] This guy that we did an auction with, didn't like the fact that I had a kind of new terms.
[time=1566] Our business was struggling and we added this thing called the buyer premium where the buyer would pay a percentage in addition to the pricey pay for car.
[time=1574] So if he bought it for 10,000, he now pays 10,500, that goes to the auction company.
[time=1579] We shared the commissions and the other revenues with local representatives in each area where we went.
[time=1585] But we were not going to share the buyer premium because we absolutely needed it to survive.
[time=1590] I sent a couple letters out.
[time=1591] I mean, we communicated this, but one guy, he either just chose not to get it or he never read those things.
[time=1598] And when it came down to settlement on the auction we did with him every year, he just blew up.
[time=1603] He drew a line in the sand, he put a stake in the ground, said this relationship is over.
[time=1608] And man, I was really at a transition point in my life.
[time=1611] And I was reading this stuff at where your treasure is or your heart will be also.
[time=1615] And it's about relationships, not about remuneration.
[time=1617] It's about people, not profit.
[time=1619] And I thought, man, God, if I really believe this, even though I'm not going to change the agreement and have my other 40 agreements not be right, I think when I saw how much money that was, let me say it this way.
[time=1630] When I saw how little money that was, that that guy was willing to tell me the relationship's over.
[time=1634] I thought, you know what, I'm going to give that to him.
[time=1637] If he'll even see me, he wouldn't talk to me or anything.
[time=1639] So I flew down his place of business so the next day was going to be the auction that we would normally have together.
[time=1643] We were now having it without him.
[time=1645] And he was willing to see me and I said, you know what?
[time=1649] And I just told him what God was doing in my life and I just want to give you this money and his response was it's too late, but he took the money.
[time=1655] And you know, here's the rest of that story.
[time=1659] That next day was going to be a horrible auction.
[time=1661] I've auctioned as many collector cars as any human being on the face of the earth.
[time=1666] And I knew that things just didn't add up.
[time=1668] We had bad weather, we didn't have enough cars, we didn't have enough better.
[time=1671] I just knew it wasn't going to work.
[time=1673] You know what I'm telling you?
[time=1675] I sold cars, I never thought I could sold that next day.
[time=1678] And just to me, you know, it's not this way all the time.
[time=1680] It's just to me that was God saying, Mitch, way to go.
[time=1683] You can trust me.
[time=1685] You can trust me, you can take that closed fist, that white knuckling of stuff, and you can just open your hand and that'll be a reflection of your heart.
[time=1693] So that happens outside of this building.
[time=1696] We're not talking about something that's just inside.
[time=1699] It happens in all of your life.
[time=1700] You can take your heart and you can open it like that.
[time=1703] [AMEN] Point number two is about God's measuring stick.
[time=1709] With Jesus, it's sacrifice, not quantity.
[time=1713] When I read the story in Mark 12 about the widow's mic a couple weeks ago getting ready for this, I started thinking about the reality that I don't know who you are, but there are lots of those people that have been in this church for years.
[time=1729] Some that aren't here now, some new ones that are here now that are these people.
[time=1733] Mark 12, let's read that together.
[time=1736] Says Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury.
[time=1742] Many rich people threw in large amounts, but a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins, worth only a fraction of a penny.
[time=1753] Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, "I tell you the truth, "this poor widow has put more into the treasury "than all the others." He didn't say to them, "Make sure you always give all that you have "the way she has." There's some relief in that.
[time=1773] But he definitely said, "I measure things differently.
[time=1777] "God, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit "have a different measuring rod." He said, "She gave more." He didn't say it feels like more.
[time=1788] It's a higher percentage.
[time=1790] He just said, "She gave more." From his perspective, she gave more.
[time=1796] Now I was thinking about those of you.
[time=1798] I see some of you now.
[time=1801] I don't know who you really are, but I'm sure I see you.
[time=1804] That you have been, for years, giving sacrificially.
[time=1811] And me and my family have been the beneficiaries of your willingness to give.
[time=1817] God's used your money to maybe reach my kids for Christ.
[time=1822] And you're probably not the widow with the two little pennies.
[time=1828] You may be a man or a woman.
[time=1832] You might even be an 11-year-old who's given all you could give.
[time=1837] And I believe with all my heart, God's blessing follows that kind of sacrificial giving.
[time=1842] And I'm grateful for that.
[time=1844] And I hope we learn it's not the quantity.
[time=1849] It's the sacrifice.
[time=1850] - And point three, you just keep going there on that same line.
[time=1855] Be careful.
[time=1856] And I'm not just saying this to you.
[time=1860] I am saying this to me, and I say it to us, and we're gonna just have to keep reminding ourselves again and again.
[time=1867] Be careful how you define sacrifice.
[time=1871] I sometimes begin to fudge with that definition.
[time=1876] And please be reminded again today that sacrifice, real, genuine sacrifice, will always entail personal cost.
[time=1884] And I just want you to write that word down, that phrase.
[time=1886] Personal cost.
[time=1890] I'm reminded we were the last couple of weeks thinking this stuff through of the story there in second Samuel 24.
[time=1896] You can write that down.
[time=1898] Second Samuel 24, 24 and 25.
[time=1902] King Aruna said to the king, verse 11, however the king said to Aruna no, but I will surely buy it from you for a price for I will not offer burnt offerings to the Lord my God, which cost me nothing.
[time=1916] There was this threshing floor that the guy wanted to just give to King David.
[time=1922] A threshing floor was what one would use to help build an altar to give a sacrifice to God.
[time=1927] This guy's so fired up David's there.
[time=1929] He wants to just give him the threshing floor.
[time=1931] David says, no, no, no, not a chance.
[time=1934] I am not going to offer burnt offerings to God was something that cost me nothing.
[time=1938] I'm gonna sacrifice and there's gonna be some cost to that.
[time=1944] And we want to just stand here again and we were saying this to each other and we're saying this to you and we're saying this to our family.
[time=1951] You know what, we're not about to get into your world and start trying to define for you what cost, real personal cost looks like.
[time=1962] Steve will talk about it later.
[time=1963] That's an issue between you and God.
[time=1965] But we're inviting you to think that through.
[time=1968] Sacrifice seems to be a common thread in this issue of biblical giving.
[time=1974] And you and I know, I believe we're pretty clear on this.
[time=1977] That involves personal cost for us.
[time=1982] And you know, I don't mind telling you about us.
[time=1984] I tell you about us all the time.
[time=1986] For us, we have to start.
[time=1988] And we have been for years thinking through things like, you know, what trips will we go on?
[time=1994] What stuff will we, what stuff will we do?
[time=1996] That's the difference between stuff and, you know, other than what stuff will we buy?
[time=2000] What trips will we go on?
[time=2001] How are we going to live our lives?
[time=2005] Where are we gonna eat?
[time=2006] How often?
[time=2007] You gotta think it through.
[time=2011] But don't forget, real sacrifice involves personal cost.
[time=2015] And that can be scary, right?
[time=2018] When you and I start talking about personal cost, that can sometimes be very scary, which is why it's so very important that we continue on in this discussion and talk about what is really at the foundation of this.
[time=2030] And that is a deep trust in a God whose love is great.
[time=2033] And Mitch is gonna talk to you a little bit about that.
[time=2036] - Just saw something there that really ties into this.
[time=2038] This is just so wonderful.
[time=2041] The reason, the reason, David says that, I will give to my God that which costs me nothing.
[time=2047] This sacrificial system is set up that you would give your best to God.
[time=2053] And that is because of one reason and one reason only.
[time=2056] And that is because God gives his best to you.
[time=2060] And somewhere along the line, you and I are gonna have to realize that that is who he is.
[time=2064] And we're gonna have to deal with it.
[time=2065] The God of the universe gives it all to me all the time.
[time=2071] And he does it in Jesus Christ.
[time=2073] At the cross, his resurrection, his life, he's ascended, he's living today.
[time=2077] And this next idea is that we trust God.
[time=2080] We trust God for his provision and protection.
[time=2083] And that allows us to give.
[time=2085] It goes back to that close fist, open hand thing.
[time=2088] I trust God, you know, I think that when I earned something that, oh man, I did a good job, you know?
[time=2093] But God gave me the eyes, God gave me the ears, God gave me the desires of my heart, God gave me the energy, God gave me the breath.
[time=2099] And who am I to say when that's all done, that he is not my provider and not my protector?
[time=2104] Let's bring up Malachi three.
[time=2107] Will a man rob God, yet you rob me.
[time=2112] But you ask, how do we rob you in ties, listen to this now, in ties and offerings?
[time=2118] Tied means 10th.
[time=2120] So you're robbing God with your heart.
[time=2121] You're just not given.
[time=2123] You're under a curse, the whole nation of you, because you are robbing me.
[time=2128] Bring the whole time, bring your gifts, bring your giving heart into the storehouse.
[time=2132] Said there may be food in my house.
[time=2134] Test me in this, God says, God says, test me in this.
[time=2139] Test me that I am the provider and the protector.
[time=2142] Says the Lord Almighty, God says that to you, and he says that to me.
[time=2146] I'll never forget how I am so sick and I white knuckle time, talent and treasures.
[time=2155] And I was at this continuing education course for one of my licenses.
[time=2159] And it was at Cruz Auction Park, it was at my place.
[time=2162] And I've gone through like a couple days of that stuff, it's the evening, it's over.
[time=2167] And they're handing out the things that you got, the diploma type deals that you show, the licensing agency that you took your continuing education.
[time=2173] And I'm waiting there getting through the case and I'm thinking, man, he just sort of slipped it to me ahead of time so I could believe this is ridiculous.
[time=2179] You know, and then no Mitchell, no Mitchell Cruz in the case, I'm like, oh man, so now I'm there waiting for the Z man to come up and to see if I'm there afterwards.
[time=2188] So there I was, I was after the man who started with Z, there's my thing, I take it.
[time=2192] I get in my car, throw it in the seat and I start driving down 427 to my house.
[time=2197] And I thought two minutes.
[time=2199] That's exactly why I was so intense and stressed.
[time=2203] I'm gonna kill myself if I'm gonna live my life being white knuckling of time that way.
[time=2208] Two minutes, two minutes is what I was so stressed about.
[time=2213] When I come to this bridge on 427, I see all these people are looking over the bridge so I just stopped.
[time=2217] I wasn't even really thinking about it.
[time=2218] I just stopped and goes, everything okay.
[time=2220] They go, there's a guy down there.
[time=2221] I go, okay.
[time=2222] And I started, they said, no, no, no, no.
[time=2223] A guy just drove from his pickup truck from that opposite direction, went flying across the lane and went down there the bridge and he's flipped over there.
[time=2232] I said, do you want me to call the police or the EMS?
[time=2236] And they said, no, no, no, we just did that.
[time=2238] I said, when did it happen?
[time=2239] And they said, two minutes ago.
[time=2245] And two minutes was on the forefront of my mind and I just realized that God quite possibly in his grace and his mercy just saved me from a head-on collision.
[time=2257] So now I waited 'til the police got there and I left and I'm driving home, I'll never forget where I was.
[time=2263] I turned on counter at 68 and I was really holding something against somebody at that time in my life.
[time=2269] And I just felt God say, Mitch, my grace is good enough for you.
[time=2275] Isn't it good enough for the guy you're pointing the finger at?
[time=2280] And this concept of God as my provider and my protector isn't just about money, it's about life.
[time=2289] It's about his grace for life.
[time=2293] And I felt the God prompt my spirit with these words, "I will open my floodgates on you." You know what does that mean?
[time=2301] What's he saying that for?
[time=2303] He spared me for an accident, why?
[time=2305] And it was just like 90, 120 days after that that I was allowed to sell my company and to pursue this.
[time=2313] And I realized that that floodgate deal wasn't about money.
[time=2319] It was about grace for life.
[time=2322] Amen, amen.
[time=2326] Real trust.
[time=2327] A deep personal trust that God is your provider and your protector.
[time=2333] And that trust moves us right on into the next point there.
[time=2336] And we want you just to kind of keep thinking along with us, write it down, God-honoring giving is never circumstantial.
[time=2343] God-honoring giving, trusting God in the way that you and I would give.
[time=2349] This is not a circumstantial deal.
[time=2351] Let me just ask you to look at 2 Corinthians 8.
[time=2355] A lot of places we could go, but I want you to look at this example here in 2 Corinthians chapter eight.
[time=2361] Paul writes at the Church of Corinth and he says there in 2 Corinthians 8, he's letting them know about these folks in Macedonia who had really evidenced an amazing heart for giving.
[time=2371] He says, "Now, brethren, we wish to make known to you the grace of God which has been given in the churches of Macedonia, but in a great ordeal of affliction." Hear this now.
[time=2382] Listen to their circumstance.
[time=2384] "That in a great ordeal of affliction, their abundance of joy and their deep poverty overflowed in the wealth of their liberality, for I testify that according to their ability and beyond their ability, beyond what they were able to give, they gave of their own accord." Look at verse four, begging us, it says.
[time=2408] Look at that attitude, that mindset, begging us with much in treaty for the favor of participation in the support of the saints.
[time=2416] You know what? The fact of the matter is, I won't officially speak for you, but I know I can for many of you because I believe you've been in these same shoes.
[time=2425] 15 years ago, my wife and I got married.
[time=2428] 15 years ago, we said to God, because of how we'd been taught and because what we saw in God's word, 15 years ago, we said, Lord, we're gonna give you, you know, our 10%.
[time=2437] We said, we're gonna start at 10.
[time=2439] We don't think that's the magic number, but we're just gonna, on a regular basis, we're gonna give you that 10%, Proverbs 3, right off the top.
[time=2447] And so we jumped in there.
[time=2449] And many of you maybe have done that very same thing.
[time=2451] Well, you know what happens?
[time=2453] You know what happens is three, four, five, six months go by and everything's pretty sweet.
[time=2458] Well, but all of a sudden an engine goes bad.
[time=2461] All of a sudden some payments come that you didn't expect.
[time=2463] All of a sudden the student loan thing comes due.
[time=2465] You know what I mean?
[time=2466] Circumstances present themselves.
[time=2469] And then here's what I would do.
[time=2470] And this is what I would do.
[time=2471] If you've done it, you know, you can join in with me here and just kind of thinking this through.
[time=2475] Why all of a sudden would take that checkbook and I would take that commitment.
[time=2478] And what was prior to that circumstance, a non-discretionary deal, this was a commitment.
[time=2485] This was a gift I was gonna, we were gonna give.
[time=2489] No if, ands, or buts.
[time=2491] Circumstances squeeze in all of a sudden.
[time=2493] I'm over here and it's all of a sudden up for grabs.
[time=2497] And I remember saying words to Kevin.
[time=2499] You know what?
[time=2499] We'll just hold off this week.
[time=2501] We can't.
[time=2503] There's no way I can write this check.
[time=2506] Circumstances were allowed to make something that really is a commitment to God based on trust with an open hand because he's my provider and protector circumstances, sometimes move us to a place that I think is dangerous.
[time=2525] And so be reminded of that.
[time=2527] Look at these people in Macedonia and ask God to give you the strength and courage, a greater awareness of his provision and his protection.
[time=2537] And we as a people, we can stay true to those commitments that we've made as we trust in him.
[time=2544] Stephen.
[time=2545] Number six, man should give with a cheerful heart
[time=2552] rather than a reluctant one.
[time=2553] But keep in mind, I like this part.
[time=2556] Generous giving will reap generously.
[time=2564] I'm at a point in my life.
[time=2567] Nance and I are coming into a phase in our life where we're starting to understand that we're gonna have more opportunity to give.
[time=2575] And I've been getting cranked up about that.
[time=2577] And I've studied this passage of scripture in 2 Corinthians 9 differently than I have in the past.
[time=2584] Let's show that.
[time=2585] Remember this, whoever so sparingly will also reap sparingly and whoever so generously will also reap generously.
[time=2593] Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion for God loves a cheerful giver.
[time=2602] 2 Corinthians 9, 6, and 7.
[time=2603] The last thing we want to happen in here ever in our church
[time=2609] is that any person would put such pressure on you, whether it's up here in the pulp anywhere, that any person would put such pressure on you that you reluctantly feeling compelled by them are willing to write out some check.
[time=2624] That would be awful.
[time=2625] But I really hope that as you study the word,
[time=2632] as you spend time in prayer, as you listen to teaching, that God compels you to give.
[time=2637] And I believe he wants you to give generously.
[time=2641] I had a friend who met me and he was feeling sort of guilty about having a boxer, a Porsche boxer.
[time=2647] It's nice.
[time=2648] We went out and out there and he was feeling guilty, tell me about that.
[time=2653] And I said, "Hey, it's all right." I said, "First Timothy 6 says, "Command those who are rich in this world and this world." Rich, that's us, all of us.
[time=2661] It says, "Don't put your hope in wealth.
[time=2665] "Put your hope in God who richly provides you "with everything for your enjoyment." Then it says this, "Command them to be rich in good deeds, "generous and willing to share their boxer."
[time=2682] Well, it doesn't have that last word on there.
[time=2683] But when I told him that he said, "You can use it for a week." I turned him down 'cause I can't afford to fix it.
[time=2690] - Steve? - Yeah.
[time=2691] - I'll take it.
[time=2692] (audience laughing) - A dog? - What I'm getting at my dog?
[time=2696] - It's a be a car, that's a car.
[time=2697] - Oh, it's a car.
[time=2699] (audience laughing) - I'm thinking you are some dogs, too.
[time=2703] - Oh, that's another story.
[time=2705] - All right, I'm sorry.
[time=2707] - Anyway, this is an opportunity.
[time=2710] What I've been studying lately about this, the opportunity to be generous and willing to share, to be generous in your giving, it's incredible.
[time=2717] What Jesus teaches over and over again, and what Paul says about the beam of seat judgment when Jesus is going to reward us, he says, "We'll receive what is due us "at the beam of seat judgment.
[time=2731] "It will receive what is due us "for the work done while in the flesh, "whether good or bad." He says over and over to his disciples, there are rewards that show up.
[time=2742] Sometimes your generosity is rewarded on earth like an auction that goes really well.
[time=2746] I believe God does that.
[time=2747] I don't know why he does it for some and not others, but he does, but I do know this.
[time=2752] I believe everybody's generosity is gonna be rewarded in heaven, amen.
[time=2757] And I'm looking forward to that.
[time=2758] And what I'm realizing now is, I'm at a stage in my life.
[time=2761] Nance and I are going to have less going out than we used to pretty soon.
[time=2765] Steph, get a job when you graduate.
[time=2767] We're gonna have, as soon as those kids are out of school and they, so we've already started thinking, okay, we're gonna get a smaller house.
[time=2774] Some of that money can go to the kingdom.
[time=2777] I'm not talking about the tide that we've been doing for years.
[time=2779] I'm looking forward to the opportunity to be able to give more than that, to be able to be really generous in giving.
[time=2786] And I believe with all my heart, God will bless that and he'll use that.
[time=2789] And he wants us, you people that have been giving already, and you've heard these messages for years, you've already been doing your 10% regularly forever.
[time=2798] Listen to this part.
[time=2800] God wants to reward you.
[time=2804] And he wants to use what you have.
[time=2807] He does not want you to take your assets to your grave.
[time=2810] I know that.
[time=2811] Your kids need a certain amount of inheritance to help them out, that's okay.
[time=2816] You can figure that out.
[time=2817] As a matter of fact, there's a website you can go to.
[time=2819] newtithing.org will help you even evaluate
[time=2825] how to be proactive in using up your assets rather than just your cash flow.
[time=2830] And so that when you die, you won't have all that.
[time=2831] And I don't want to have any.
[time=2834] Another good website is generousgiving.org.
[time=2837] That's a good one.
[time=2839] I know some people that have been really proactive and they're already establishing foundations through their families to be proactive about how can I use this wealth that I've accumulated to further the kingdom.
[time=2849] Man, I want to do that.
[time=2851] Because then I believe with all my heart, your heart, will go there and he can use you in tremendous ways.
[time=2858] [AMEN] - Tell me about your friend's question.
[time=2862] - I have a friend that last week, I coached this guy in Minnesota, he's a pastor and he's been mentored by a guy that's pretty old.
[time=2872] For 50 years, this guy said, I've been asking people who tithe what it's been like.
[time=2878] He said, I've never won time in 50 years had anybody say they regretted tithing, not once.
[time=2885] Now he has bumped into a few other people who've regretted not doing it, but not once.
[time=2890] - Well, see, I've tithed, not tithed, tithed.
[time=2895] And I'm really scared to death, to not give to God because of what I would say about my heart toward him.
[time=2903] - Yeah.
[time=2904] - We've got crown ministries right here in our church to help us figure out how to do all that.
[time=2908] A life skill you can sign up for.
[time=2909] - Great class.
[time=2910] - You know, this car collector died and he wanted to be buried in his 59 Cadillac El Dorado convertible, El Dorado Barretz.
[time=2919] And so they prop him there behind the wheel and he's got his hat on and you know on this.
[time=2923] And they're having this big ceremony, the band's playing and the car's getting lowered into the grave and this little nine year old boy stands there and looks at that and he goes, "Man, that's living." (audience laughs) And you know, that's just, that's kind of what we do.
[time=2939] If you've never really given your heart to God, you're probably not giving to him monetarily.
[time=2948] We just wrapped up this series, "Snapshots of a Saver." Jesus asked you, "Give me your heart "and you'll experience life." And scholars say that Jesus came proclaiming primarily one message and that's the kingdom of God.
[time=2961] The kingdom of God is available to enter the human heart and in the kingdom of God, the humble and harder end and the proud and hard are out.
[time=2970] If I don't wanna acknowledge that an eternity God owns it all, you know, that's just a, that's just deception.
[time=2978] And if I'm not gonna acknowledge that I can trust God to be my provider and protector, that's denial.
[time=2983] But Jesus Christ offers life and if you're considering today, having a giving heart, you first step, I would just say, is to allow the kingdom of God to enter your heart.
[time=2996] Your work has been designed for the kingdom of God.
[time=2999] He's designed to bless you and to give you things so you can give in return, so you can take your heart and quit doing this and you can do that.
[time=3008] And I just wanna ask you that today, if you would consider doing that, just giving your life, giving your heart to him.
[time=3015] Every financial decision I've made to give has been in the context of prayer and it's just coming to me again and again and again as we talk up here.
[time=3023] And so if you've never given before and you're gonna give your heart to God, I just say pray.
[time=3029] Ask God what he wants to do with you.
[time=3031] It's about relationship, not about religion.
[time=3033] What's he wanna do with you with this giving stuff?
[time=3036] Our middle schoolers learn today across the street about the 10, 10, 80 plan.
[time=3041] Maybe you wanna try that.
[time=3043] Give 10, save 10, live off of 80 but honor God in all those categories.
[time=3048] - Wow.
[time=3049] - I just invite you today to give your heart to the kingdom of God within you now.
[time=3056] - Amen, amen.
[time=3057] Let me read to you where we started and then we wanna show you something.
[time=3061] Just kinda go back in your mind to where we began this discussion.
[time=3065] Matthew 619, it says, "Do not lay up for yourselves." Right?
[time=3070] Jesus said, "Do not lay up for yourselves." Treasures upon earth where moth and rust destroy.
[time=3076] That's this right here, folks.
[time=3079] It's the temple, it's the temple of modern day culture.
[time=3082] Right there.
[time=3085] Treasures on earth, it's killing people.
[time=3089] It's ruining families every day.
[time=3093] And he says, "Do not lay up for yourselves." Treasures on earth, but lay up for yourselves.
[time=3098] Treasures in heaven.
[time=3100] We wanna show you right now what treasures in heaven look like.
[time=3105] We wanna show you just a glimpse of what happens when a fully surrendered people come and give themselves to what God is about, which is bringing people home to faith, growing them and their faith.
[time=3119] And when we see that happen, that full surrender of heart, it's one of the most exciting things that I ever get to witness.
[time=3126] And so we wanna have the lights are gonna go down and we're gonna run this video and we just want you to be reminded of what treasures in heaven look like.
[time=3134] And there is no greater endeavor, there is no greater privilege that you and I have the opportunity to give to.
[time=3141] So please open your hearts.
[time=3143] Please stay seated and just take this in and thank God with us as we celebrate his work in the lives and hearts of people.
[time=3151] [MUSIC - 275 seconds]
[time=3431] - Amen, amen, what do you stand?
[time=3435] And just bow your heads if you would, please.
[time=3437] Father, as we see those pictures again, and as we're reminded of those stories, and as we watch young and old, and those in between common, proclaim their love for you, as we realize that in each face there, there's been a changed life, an altered eternity.
[time=3456] And that changed life as the privilege then of impacting, influencing others.
[time=3461] And that's what we get to be a part of, God here in this family.
[time=3464] And so we thank you for that again today.
[time=3467] And we pray that as we leave, and as we consider full surrender, not sort of and not partially, but God hearts that are completely given to you.
[time=3476] And God, however that might affect personally, you know, between us and you, are giving.
[time=3484] However that might affect personally, between us and you, our relationships, our workplace attitude, God, the way we conduct ourselves, and whatever arena of life it is, God, our prayer is that you would, your spirit, your word, and your people would move us and encourage us toward complete surrender to you.
[time=3505] Trusting you, loving, with open hands and open hearts, you, God, as we give ourselves to that, we pray that you would do what only you can do.
[time=3516] Come alongside and give us the strength and courage to do so.
[time=3520] And bring us back together again soon.
[time=3523] Give us the opportunity to be together to celebrate and to worship you.
[time=3527] God, be with us as we go in your son's name, we pray.
[time=3530] [AMEN] (gentle music)
[time=3540] (gentle music)
