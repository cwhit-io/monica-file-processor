[time=1085] [ Singing ]
[time=1105] Amen. Hey, let me just encourage you real quick. Can I just -- every once in a while, I think it's good to just remind ourselves of this.
[time=1114] And, you know, as a family, as we come into this place every week, I feel in my heart, like, you know, so many of us understand or are really growing in our understanding of this, but just periodically, I think it's good to just remind young and old alike that in Malachi chapter 1, it says there that God was not pleased with His people.
[time=1138] Do you remember why? Remember why He was not pleased? God wasn't pleased with His people because they were coming through the doors of His house to bring worship and they weren't bringing their best.
[time=1152] They were bringing sick, lame, and blind lambs, and in a place where He has called us, in a place where He had called them, to offer up their very best with everything they had.
[time=1166] They weren't getting it done, and it displeased God.
[time=1170] And so I just want to thank you, and I want to encourage you on the one hand, and I want to remind you on the other, that every time we have the privilege of coming through those doors, and please don't forget what a privilege it is, every time you or I come through those doors, we come into this place, right, to give Him our very, very best.
[time=1191] And that means that we sing as bad as you may sound, as good as you may sound.
[time=1198] You sing, and you read words on screens that are more than words, they're truth, they're life-changing, eternity-altering truth, and we lift up not just words, but truth to Him, we proclaim His goodness.
[time=1212] And His goodness to you and to me, it should stir our hearts, and it should bring a sense of purpose and focus to this time, and so I just want to say thanks for being a family that's moving in that direction, and keep thinking about it.
[time=1225] Every time you walk through these doors, we come to give Him our very best.
[time=1230] We start this morning, a new series called Heroes of the Faith, Heroes of the Faith.
[time=1236] Do you have any heroes growing up?
[time=1239] Do you have any heroes?
[time=1240] When you think back to those early years of your life, as you kind of looked around this big world of ours, where there's some people in your life that kind of stood out to you, I had one, and his name was Grandpa Joe.
[time=1252] He was my grandpa, my mom's dad, and I just can remember from the earliest of days being around Grandpa Joe, because Grandpa Joe was deaf, couldn't hear a thing, had been completely deaf from the time he was 20 years old, couldn't hear a thing, and so because he couldn't hear a thing, and because he was a rather aggressive and boisterous guy, I mean, he just, he was the loudest human being, I was ever around my whole life.
[time=1276] He just let it fly, and not only was he loud, because he couldn't hear himself, but if he could have heard himself, he still would have been loud, because he just had so much to say, he had so many opinions, he had so much to offer, and he loved me.
[time=1288] He loved me so much, and from the day I was like, you know, like four or five years old, my first recollections of Grandpa Joe, I just could sense him, I just knew, and even though he was rough, and even though he was loud, there was just so many things about him that communicated to me that he loved me.
[time=1304] I never missed a game of mine from junior high on through high school, never missed a single game, not one, made the trip, drove, Grandma took him, went with my mom, I mean, he just never missed a thing.
[time=1317] And it was so incredible, because he was deaf and he was so loud, he would always just, and sometimes I didn't know if he knew what was going on, but he would just say, you know how they sometimes, they just say what they're, you say to yourself what you're thinking, well he would just say what he was thinking out loud,
[time=1331] he would be up in the stands, just, everything I did, no matter where we were, you could just hear Grandpa Joe, his voice would just bell out, come on Kelly!
[time=1341] You know, and you would be thinking that, he would just be saying it, oh my goodness, you'd call that a pass.
[time=1349] The gym would just, everywhere we went, they kind of got to know my grandpa, but he was a hero, he was a hero for what he overcame, he was a hero for the way he loved, he was a hero for the way he gave himself.
[time=1360] And spiritually speaking, how about you, any heroes of the faith, any people in your life who have made an investment in your life that you're so incredibly grateful for,
[time=1372] you know, in the Old Testament, which is where we'll be for the next several weeks, we see some serious heroes, some heroic individuals.
[time=1381] And I want to make sure you understand how I use and how we use the phrase heroic, because these men weren't perfect, they weren't always courageous, they weren't always pure, they weren't always obedient and they weren't always faithful.
[time=1396] But they were heroes of the faith, because you know why, and this is how we'll define hero, because in the end, in the end when it was all said and done, these were men who chose God, who chose what's right.
[time=1409] In the end, though they may have succeeded and/or failed along the way, in the end, these were men who chose God, who chose obedience, and that which was right.
[time=1419] And we begin this morning with the story of Joseph, the story of Joseph and wow, what a story it is.
[time=1426] I want you to write this down, okay, as we start, just get out your pens and I want you to write this phrase down.
[time=1431] Personal character, personal character and the providence of God, would you write that down?
[time=1438] Personal character and the providence of God.
[time=1442] And understand as you write that down that one gets developed and grown, personal character.
[time=1448] When life is lived in submission to the other, when life is lived yielded to the other, the providence of God, personal character and the providence of God.
[time=1460] The providence of God, character is grown within the crucible of God's providence being played out.
[time=1466] Let me just define for you, okay, some of you are sitting there going, okay, wait a minute, what's providence?
[time=1471] What do you mean by God's providence?
[time=1473] Character being grown in the crucible of God's unfolding providence?
[time=1477] Well, here you go.
[time=1478] Here's how we'll define providence.
[time=1480] Providence is this.
[time=1481] God's providence is the fact.
[time=1483] And it is the fact.
[time=1484] It is the fact, it is the reality that a loving God is thoughtfully, don't miss this, and with purpose, orchestrating the events of my life.
[time=1497] Providence is the fact that a loving God, not a mean and not a cruel and not a short sighted God, but no, a loving God is thoughtfully and with purpose, orchestrating each and every event of my life.
[time=1512] Orchestrate what he brings to bear, or even that which he allows.
[time=1517] He orchestrates your life and mind, and that is his providence and character of heart, strength of soul, that gets grown.
[time=1527] That gets developed when you and I live, when you and I yield to that divine involvement, when we stay faithful to that providence.
[time=1538] In the midst of what he orchestrates, character is what comes.
[time=1542] And what you'll see as we look closely at the life of Joseph is amazing, astonishing character.
[time=1549] Amazing, astonishing character.
[time=1551] Character that yielded again and again and again to a loving God's unfolding plan.
[time=1558] Let me ask you this morning before we even jump in.
[time=1562] How are you responding today to a loving God's plan?
[time=1568] And he's loving, and he's orchestrating with thought and with real purpose, the events of your life.
[time=1578] How are you responding today?
[time=1581] Right now, how's your heart?
[time=1584] How's your attitude? What's your posture today to the unfolding providential plan of a God whose love for you is great?
[time=1593] Who makes no mistakes, and who brings to your life and mind exactly what we need to grow and understand him better?
[time=1604] Well, let's take a look at the life of Joseph, and let's look at God's providence at work in this young man's life.
[time=1612] The first place that we'll see it is in his past.
[time=1615] Joseph's past. God at work in his past.
[time=1619] Chapters 29 to 37 of Genesis is kind of the backdrop for what we're going to talk about here briefly.
[time=1625] Genesis chapter 29 all the way through 37 gives us kind of a look, a picture, if you will, into this young man's past,
[time=1632] where the narrative picks up is 37. That's where our story really begins.
[time=1637] But just let's for a moment stop and kind of pause and look back and see God's providential plan in Joseph's past as he prepares him.
[time=1647] Where did Joseph come from, some might say? Did Joseph have the kind of family background we might expect to produce?
[time=1652] We might expect to produce a person of such exceptional character.
[time=1656] What were Joseph's family ties? What had his life entailed?
[time=1660] Well, there's no question that Joseph came from quite a family. No other 17-year-old, he would have been 17 years of age at the time of chapter 37,
[time=1670] and no other 17-year-old in his day could have boasted of a great-grandfather named Abraham,
[time=1676] a grandfather named Isaac, and his own father, who was a well-known man named Jacob.
[time=1683] You'll remember it was Jacob, Joseph's dad, who met and fell in love with a gal named Rachel, the younger daughter of Laban.
[time=1691] Jacob loved Rachel, it says so passionately and so deeply that he offered to work for his uncle Laban seven years for Rachel's hand in marriage.
[time=1700] And he worked the seven years, and when the seven years were completed, the time came, and it was night, it was dark, I suppose,
[time=1707] because what Laban did was he kind of does the old switcheroo. He doesn't give Jacob, Rachel, he gives Jacob there in the tenth that night, her older sister, Leah.
[time=1717] And Laban deceived Jacob in that matter, and the next day it kind of all comes to light, and they strike a new deal.
[time=1725] And Laban comes back and says, "Okay, okay, okay, I'm going to give you, I'm going to give you Rachel, but I'm going to need seven more years from you."
[time=1732] And so Jacob re-ups for seven more years of work and labor, and in the end, Mary's both.
[time=1739] And in rapid succession, the Bible describes how the first twelve children of Jacob were born, eleven sons and a daughter.
[time=1748] Altogether, Leah bore Jacob six sons and the only daughter, Dinah.
[time=1752] Leah also gave her maid servant, Zilpa, to Jacob, and through her, Jacob had two more sons.
[time=1758] When Rachel could not conceive, remember God had closed Rachel's womb.
[time=1763] When Rachel could not conceive, she gave her maid servant, Bill Hot, to Jacob, and Bill Hot bore two sons, and finally, in Genesis 30, we read God remembered Rachel.
[time=1774] God remembered Rachel and opened her womb, and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son, and she named him, it says Joseph.
[time=1781] This was quite a family, quite a family. One father, four mothers, two who were wives, two who were concubines, eleven sons and one daughter.
[time=1790] And at the end of this mixed up, complicated family, Joseph arrives for the present, the youngest of Jacob's sons.
[time=1796] Now, watch this, in the years that followed, Joseph would be ripped away from his grandpa, Laban.
[time=1802] In the middle of the night, as Jacob takes his family and begins to run from Laban's presence, his dad would, Jacob would wrestle later with an angel.
[time=1809] His sister, Dinah, would be raped at Shechem.
[time=1813] Joseph, as a young boy, would watch his brothers take revenge for that rape, killing all the males in that slaughtering, murdering all the males in that city.
[time=1823] His mom would die, his own mother.
[time=1826] Rachel would eventually die, giving birth to his little brother, Benjamin, and his grandfather, Isaac, dies in chapter 35.
[time=1832] And so, as we come to the narrative of chapter 37, we realize something.
[time=1838] What we realize is this, this young man has seen more trauma, more excitement, more pain and more confusion than most we'll see in a lifetime.
[time=1847] His past, his past.
[time=1852] Think about that. His past, the unfolding plan of God.
[time=1857] The providential unfolding plan of God was uniquely preparing him for the future.
[time=1862] God had in store. Write this down. Would you this morning?
[time=1865] Make a note. Write it down. God prepares us for the works he's prepared.
[time=1870] God prepares us for the works he's prepared.
[time=1875] You see this as well in Ephesians, in the New Testament, back in Ephesians chapter 2, Paul writing to the church at Ephesus, and he says they're in Ephesians chapter 2, for we are his workmanship.
[time=1885] Don't forget this. It's as true today as it was back then.
[time=1889] We are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus for good works, good works which God prepared beforehand.
[time=1897] Before the foundations of the world, God prepares you and me, those of us that live in relationship with him, he prepares us.
[time=1905] It says for good works that we should walk in them.
[time=1910] Don't lose sight of that today. Hey, whoever you are, and I mean that, wherever you've been, whatever you've experienced, whatever you've been exposed to, whatever choices you've made, your past.
[time=1927] I mean, I talk to people in so many times, it just seems to be a discouraging thing, and there are painful things at times about your past and mind.
[time=1939] But understand, and kind of just draw a new line in the sand this morning, he prepares us for the works he's prepared.
[time=1946] So painful or pristine, either way, you know, dramatic or pretty normal, whatever your past or mind God has used it.
[time=1961] God has brought you through that to prepare us for divine activity.
[time=1966] Whose life are you going to touch? What circumstance can you bring hope to?
[time=1971] Wherever you've been, whatever you've done, your past, my past, Joseph's past prepares him for divine activity, unique and powerful ministry in the life of maybe one.
[time=1985] You might touch one, and your past God might use to touch one for eternity. You might reach thousands, I don't know.
[time=1995] But remember again today that your past, whatever it might be, God uses to do his work.
[time=2002] While we see character, and we see God's providential plan, we see that whole relationship at work again in his pit experience.
[time=2012] Joseph has a pit experience like none other.
[time=2016] Look at chapter 37 of Genesis. Genesis chapter 37. And let me just give you some backdrop here.
[time=2023] What has transpired is this. His dad, Jacob, many of you know the story.
[time=2029] Joseph's dad, Jacob, as unwise as it might have been and as much trouble as it caused, the fact was he was absolutely blatantly open in the fact that he favored Joseph over the rest of his guys, over the rest of his sons.
[time=2043] I mean, it was just clear. Jacob loved Joseph. And it wasn't that he didn't love the other guys, but you know what?
[time=2049] There was just this special connection with Joseph so much so that he gives him the big coat, right?
[time=2054] Gives him the Technicolor dream coat deal, the big tunic, the big bathrobe with all the colors.
[time=2059] And Joseph's so proud of it. He loves it so much, and all the brothers just grow in their absolute hatred of him.
[time=2067] I mean, they despise their brother. They absolutely despise him.
[time=2073] And it goes way beyond hallway bickering at night over who gets to go into the bath.
[time=2077] I mean, you'll see. It's just serious stuff.
[time=2082] And the dad, Jacob, sends the son, Joseph, to check on his brothers who were out in the fields.
[time=2087] And I want you to picture the scene. Genesis 37.
[time=2091] You can pick it up in verse 18. Joseph has traveled a great distance to come and be with his brothers.
[time=2098] When they saw him, verse 18, from a distance, and before he came close to them, they plotted against him to put him to death.
[time=2105] And they said to each other, "Here comes this dreamer. Now then come and let us kill him."
[time=2112] There it is. They're going to off the guy. They can't stand him.
[time=2118] "Come, let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits, and we'll say a wild beast devoured him.
[time=2123] Then let us see what will become of his dreams." Wow.
[time=2130] Irony plays a part in this story as well. Irony, it's amazing.
[time=2135] Some of you know the story, and so you know the end. Others of you are maybe hearing it for the first time, but the irony is at this point right here that these 10 brothers sit watching him appear on the horizon, they plot to kill.
[time=2148] They plot to kill the very one without whom someday they would starve to death.
[time=2153] The very one they purposed to kill in their hearts is the very one someday
[time=2159] down the road who's going to end up saving their very lives.
[time=2163] Well, read with me. Just kind of keep going here. Verse 21, "But Reuben heard this and rescued him out of their hands and said,
[time=2170] "Let us not take his life." Reuben further said to them, "She had no blood. Throw him into this pit that is in the wilderness,
[time=2176] but do not lay hands on him that he might rescue him." This is Reuben's idea.
[time=2180] This is what Reuben's thinking, that he might himself come back and rescue him out of their hands to restore him to his father.
[time=2185] And so it came about when Joseph reached his brothers that they stripped Joseph of his tunic, the very colored tunic that was on him.
[time=2192] And they took him and threw him into the pit. And now the pit was empty without any water in it.
[time=2198] And then they sat down to eat a meal. These guys are cold, cold-hearted.
[time=2204] They strip him from an a pit and somebody says, "Hey, let's eat." And as they raise their eyes and look behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead with their camels bearing aromatic gum
[time=2216] and bomb and myrrh on their way to bring them down to Egypt. And Judah said to his brothers,
[time=2222] "What profit is it for us to kill our brother and cover up his blood? Come and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites
[time=2228] and not lay our hands on him. For he is our brother, all of a sudden somebody sprouting a conscious.
[time=2233] For he is our brother, our own flesh, and his brothers listened to him, then some Midianite traders passed by.
[time=2239] So they pulled him up and lifted Joseph out of the pit and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty shekels of silver.
[time=2245] Thus they brought Joseph into Egypt. Now Reuben returned to the pit and behold Joseph was not in the pit.
[time=2252] So he tore his garments and he returned to his brothers and said, "The boy is not there. As for me, where am I to go?"
[time=2258] And so they took Joseph's tunic and slaughtered a male goat and dipped the tunic in the blood.
[time=2263] And they sent the very colored tunic and brought it to their father and said, "We found this. Please examine it
[time=2269] to see whether it is your son's tunic or not." Then he examined it and said, "It is my son's tunic.
[time=2274] A wild beast has devoured him. Joseph has surely been torn to pieces." Verse 34, "So Jacob tore his clothes and put sackcloth on his loins and mourned for his son many days.
[time=2286] Then all his sons and all his daughters arose to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted.
[time=2292] And he said, "Surely I will go down to Sheol in mourning for my son, and so his father wept for him."
[time=2303] You know, I read that and I read other stories. You know, you do too. We read through the pages of Scripture.
[time=2311] And sometimes, and sometimes I just wonder, you know, all that we need is here and it is beautiful and it is sufficient and it is powerful.
[time=2321] Sometimes I'll read through stories like that and I'll just think, "Man, I wish sometimes that there was more. I wonder what Joseph..."
[time=2329] You know, I wonder, I sometimes read this and I go, "I wonder what Joseph was thinking." I mean, you and I, you know, we get in spots sometimes and boy, our minds just, I wonder what a 17-year-old is thinking.
[time=2343] I wonder if maybe he might have thought or said to himself something like this, you know, in my wildest dreams.
[time=2350] And I've had a few. I couldn't have imagined that I would end up like this so lost and lonely.
[time=2358] I couldn't believe my brothers hated me that much. I mean, I knew they didn't like me, but come on, they threw me into that dark hole and they wanted me dead.
[time=2366] I cried in that pit. I cried for help. I cried for mercy. I cried for my life.
[time=2371] And then they sold me, sold me, pulled me out and sold me to strangers who put me on the back of a camel and took me off to Egypt.
[time=2379] And, you know, I cried all the way there. Every time I turned and looked down that dusty path, I wondered if my dad would come with his men to rescue me and take me home because, you know, that's all I wanted to do is just go home.
[time=2389] But nobody, nobody came. And I was gone.
[time=2397] That's what he might have said. That's what he might have been thinking.
[time=2401] But I can tell you this, he was really, really distressed. That we know.
[time=2407] You can write this down. Genesis 42, later in the story, Genesis 42, 21, this verse records some conversation between the brothers as they reflect back on this unforgettable moment.
[time=2418] And that verse that says, "Surely, we are being punished because of our brother.
[time=2423] We saw how distressed he was when he pleaded with us for his life, but we would not listen."
[time=2431] And I want you to think about that. I want you just to take a minute this morning. I want you just to picture that.
[time=2436] And you know what? You may not have to go too far in your mind.
[time=2440] You may not have to scroll back too far in your life to remember a time when you, in confusion and pain and uncertainty, pleaded.
[time=2452] God, what are you doing? God, where am I supposed to go? God, what is this?
[time=2459] Your own pit experience.
[time=2463] When the walls kind of came in, when it got real dark, when you weren't real sure what you were going to do or how you were going to survive.
[time=2474] Maybe you're there now.
[time=2477] Maybe that's where you're living these days. In a circumstance of life, in a situation where you were thoroughly and utterly confused, feeling tossed into a pit, getting sold down the road, feeling lonely and uncertain.
[time=2494] I want you to write this down. Just write this down, please. A loving God's love is never lost.
[time=2501] A loving God's love is never lost. A loving God's love is never lost. Jacob and his men.
[time=2508] Alright, remember, okay? Remember, Jacob and his men, alright? They didn't come save the day.
[time=2515] Joseph's dad didn't go get his hired hands and hop on the horses and blow the horn and come stop the caravan and take him back home.
[time=2521] You know what? He didn't save the day, but guess who did? God. God saved the day.
[time=2528] God saved the day. God always does. In his time and in his place and in his way, God's love, God's hand of protection, God's hand of care was never far at all from this young man's life.
[time=2541] Write it down. Romans 8, 37 to 39. Romans 8, 37 to 39. And wherever you are today, whatever it is you're facing, whatever your pit may look like, whatever confusion is running through the days of your life, whatever pain you're doing your best to endure and get through.
[time=2557] Please, this morning, don't forget a loving God's love is never lost.
[time=2562] It says in Romans 8, 37, but in all these things, we, we who are his, right? Those who live in relationship with him.
[time=2569] We overwhelmingly conquer through him who loved us. For Paul says, "For I am convinced that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing."
[time=2585] And with Joseph, no pit, no jealous brother, no nothing could, as it says here, be able to separate us from the love of God, from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus, our Lord.
[time=2601] How are you doing right now? How are you doing right now?
[time=2608] Maybe this morning for you, it's really, really dark. Maybe this morning for you, it's not, but you can remember like it was yesterday, what it was like to be in a really, really dark place.
[time=2619] And I want to just say this to you before we move on.
[time=2623] That doesn't matter if, it doesn't matter if you've got thrown in, some of you have been. It doesn't matter if you just, you got too close to an edge and maybe you fell in.
[time=2639] Others of you, in all honesty, would sit here and say before him and before yourself that you, you just jumped in.
[time=2646] But either way, whether you jumped, whether you fell, whether you got pushed.
[time=2651] Remember this morning that the love of God, the hand of God, is protecting, guiding, caring, loving hand is never far from you.
[time=2663] And there isn't anything in this world that can separate you from it, nothing.
[time=2671] And how do you see it? How do you know it's there? You see the loving hand of God extended to you through the Word of God, through the Spirit of God and through the people of God.
[time=2680] And you and I have to be ready and willing to accept it.
[time=2685] Now watch this, God's loving hand, God's hand of protection and guidance brings young Joseph to a slave auction in Egypt and a man named Potiphar.
[time=2697] Write this down, number three, his placement, his placement.
[time=2702] God's loving hand places you and I and it placed Joseph in just the right place.
[time=2708] Now that probably was a little confusing for him at first because don't forget now he's at a slave auction.
[time=2715] All right?
[time=2716] He gets brought to Egypt by this band of Ishmaelites.
[time=2719] He gets given over to the authorities there and he's auctioned, which means he would have been taken, stripped naked, stood up on a podium and poked and prodded and turned around for all the sea.
[time=2731] Hundreds of miles away from home, beaten, thrown in a pit, pulled out, put on a camel,
[time=2737] stood in front of a hundred, two hundred, three hundred people, nude and just bought like a piece of meat, you know, a little piece of cattle.
[time=2746] Take him, boom, over there.
[time=2749] But who buys him?
[time=2753] A guy named Potiphar.
[time=2755] That's how God worked it out.
[time=2757] That's what God did.
[time=2758] Watch this, go back to Genesis 39.
[time=2761] Genesis 39.
[time=2766] It says, now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt in Potiphar, an Egyptian officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the bodyguard.
[time=2774] This guy is way up there in authority and power, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him down there and the Lord was with Joseph.
[time=2782] There you go.
[time=2783] And the Lord was with Joseph.
[time=2785] So he became a successful man and he was in the house of his master, the Egyptian.
[time=2791] Now his master saw that the Lord was with him and how the Lord caused all that he did to prosper in his hand.
[time=2797] So Joseph found favor in his sight and became his personal servant.
[time=2802] And he made him overseer over his house and all that he owned, he put in his charge, in Joseph's charge.
[time=2810] And it came about that from the time he made him overseer in his house and over all that he owned, the Lord blessed the Egyptians house on account of Joseph.
[time=2819] Thus the Lord's blessing was upon all that he owned in the house and in the field.
[time=2824] And so he left everything he owned in Joseph's charge.
[time=2828] And with him there he did not concern himself with anything except the food which he ate.
[time=2834] Now Joseph was handsome in form and appearance.
[time=2841] Okay, just real quick back up and remind yourself.
[time=2844] He's 17, he's stripped, he's scared, he's sold, he's put on a camel.
[time=2848] He's taken to Egypt, he's put up on a block.
[time=2851] He's bought like a piece of meat by a guy high up in a very evil ruler's regime and taken to this guy's house.
[time=2861] And you know what he did with God's help and I want you to write this down.
[time=2865] Just kind of connect this thought with this whole idea of his placement.
[time=2870] He grew where he was planted, write that down, grow where you're planted.
[time=2879] And I know some of you, I don't know all of you.
[time=2882] But I know in a room this size with this many people that there are some people in this room today and you have been planted in a spot these days and you just don't get it.
[time=2895] I know, I know what it's like, I know what you're thinking.
[time=2899] I know how confusing and how difficult it might be, but I just want you this morning.
[time=2903] You know, there's people in this room today that need to hear this right here.
[time=2906] You need to understand what this young man did.
[time=2909] He grew where he was planted.
[time=2911] Here's the deal, somewhere along the line.
[time=2914] I think he sits down and he says to himself and he says to God, I don't get it.
[time=2919] I'm scared, I'm confused and I'm lonely.
[time=2922] But, and this is where so many times you and I go here, but he stays here.
[time=2928] He says, I'm scared, I'm lonely.
[time=2930] I don't get it, but you know what God?
[time=2932] I'm going to make the most of this.
[time=2936] I'm going to make the very most of this because I believe that's what you would have me do.
[time=2942] And I believe you'll enable me and strengthen me to do it.
[time=2946] And it doesn't make sense and I'm very scared and I don't see where this is going.
[time=2951] But in this moment, in this spot, I will get up today and I will get up tomorrow and I will make the most of this with your help.
[time=2960] I'll obey, I'll be faithful, I'll live a life of character and see so many times.
[time=2968] We get to breaking points where we come to these points where we say, you know what?
[time=2972] Okay, I've done the faithful enduring thing, but you are obviously asleep.
[time=2978] And we come over here and we go over there in efforts to bring relief, in efforts to bring a sense of satisfaction, in an effort to bring whatever it is, we're so convinced we need.
[time=2991] When God's providence being played out puts us right here.
[time=2996] And that's where he had Joseph.
[time=2998] And Joseph decides to grow where he's planted.
[time=3004] And remember the providence thing.
[time=3007] In the providence thing, there's no mistake where you've been planted.
[time=3012] This is the circumstance that you find yourself in today right now.
[time=3016] Where you've been planted, there's no mistakes.
[time=3021] God didn't miss one.
[time=3023] He has you exactly where he wants you to be.
[time=3027] Write down James 1, 2 to 5.
[time=3034] Consider it all joy.
[time=3036] Don't think of a mistake.
[time=3038] Don't think God's off the throne.
[time=3040] Don't think his providence somehow kind of, you know, got a virus and got a little bit skewed.
[time=3044] No, no, no, no.
[time=3045] Consider it all joy.
[time=3046] It says when you encounter various trials, knowing this, that the testing of your faith produces endurance.
[time=3054] And let endurance goes on to say, have it's perfect result that you may be perfect and complete lacking in nothing.
[time=3060] The word endurance in the Greek, watch this.
[time=3062] It's a great word for our discussion today.
[time=3064] The word endurance in the Greek is hupa meno.
[time=3066] And it means to remain.
[time=3068] It means to remain under.
[time=3070] This passage kind of views trials and difficulty as an umbrella, if you were, of tough times.
[time=3076] And the word hupa meno, endure, means to stay right there.
[time=3082] And allow it to rain on you for as long as it's going to rain on you.
[time=3087] Knowing that in enduring your faith and mine are grown, your faith and mine are perfected.
[time=3093] Character gets grown in the crucible of God's providence.
[time=3097] We see it again and again.
[time=3099] And you know what Joseph became the best slave he could be.
[time=3106] It's where he got planted and that's where he grew.
[time=3109] He also shows a growing, escalating sense of integrity.
[time=3114] Integrity of heart and he shows this growing and escalating sense of love for and respect for God and Potiphar when he runs away from Mrs. Potiphar.
[time=3126] We never catch a name, but she's just, she's his wife.
[time=3130] And Joseph was handsome and form and appearance.
[time=3133] And she wants to do things with him that he knows he shouldn't do.
[time=3138] And it says you run.
[time=3140] This young man of growing character turns and absolutely sprints from her.
[time=3147] You can see it there in the passage.
[time=3149] So fast that he leaves his jacket in her hands.
[time=3154] So then he, verse 16, 39, 16, so she left his garment.
[time=3161] He runs.
[time=3163] His garments in her hands, he left so fast.
[time=3166] So she left his garment beside her until his master came home, Potiphar.
[time=3170] Then she spoke to him with these words, "The Hebrew slave whom you brought to us came into me to make sport of me."
[time=3178] And it happened as I raised my voice and screamed that he left his garment beside me and fled outside.
[time=3185] Uh-oh.
[time=3186] Now it came about when his master heard the words of his wife which she spoke to him saying, "This is what your slave did to me that his anger burned."
[time=3194] So Joseph's master took him and put him into jail.
[time=3199] The place where the king's prisoners were confined and he was there in jail.
[time=3206] Well, you know what?
[time=3208] Amazing.
[time=3209] I mean, absolutely amazing.
[time=3213] He does the right thing.
[time=3216] He stands on his character and his love for God and he makes a tough decision.
[time=3221] He does the right thing and he gets thrown in jail back to his prison.
[time=3229] It was the pit verse.
[time=3230] Now it's the prison.
[time=3233] I mean, stay with this, folks.
[time=3234] We're going to close here in just a minute, but just don't miss this.
[time=3237] He does the right thing and he gets thrown in his prison.
[time=3241] He gets put in the dungeon.
[time=3244] Now, you know, I'm not Joseph, but I'm just telling you, if it's me about this stage of the game, I'm starting to think that this character thing is a little bit overrated.
[time=3255] I'm just thinking, "What in the world is going on?" But not him.
[time=3262] Not him.
[time=3264] As the story unfolds and you can read it there in the text, as the story unfolds, guess what he becomes?
[time=3269] He becomes the best what?
[time=3271] Sam, he becomes the best prisoner.
[time=3274] He can be.
[time=3276] He becomes the head of the prisoners.
[time=3279] The jailer sees the hand of God.
[time=3282] The jailer sees the no complaining, the no bitterness, the no bad attitude, the no oh poor me.
[time=3289] The jailer sees the character, the jailer sees the integrity of hard in life.
[time=3293] And he becomes the leader of the prisoners in charge, giving direction, interpreting dreams.
[time=3303] It's an amazing picture.
[time=3306] And we're out of time, but most of you know the story.
[time=3310] That in prison, he so catches the eye and the attention of Pharaoh.
[time=3314] That Pharaoh, the leader of the land, the supreme king and ruler of all, begins to bring Joseph into his confidence.
[time=3322] Begins to allow Joseph to exercise his leadership.
[time=3326] Begins to allow Joseph with all of his integrity and character of heart and love for God.
[time=3332] Pharaoh himself brings Joseph into places of leadership and influence.
[time=3338] And Joseph continues to live this life.
[time=3341] Joseph continues to see down the road.
[time=3344] Joseph was the one responsible for the fact that in a time of famine, which hit the land, the grain houses were full.
[time=3351] Joseph had, with God's help, seen down the road.
[time=3354] And it's these grain houses, these storage bins that are full of grain that years later, all of a sudden the band of brothers come up from the south to ask for help because they know they're about to starve.
[time=3367] And it's Joseph who these brothers bump into.
[time=3371] They don't know it.
[time=3373] It's been 20 plus years.
[time=3375] And we see in that encounter, and there's a couple of them, but we see in that encounter this providential unfolding plan of God come to fruition as he reveals himself to them.
[time=3389] And then there's those famous words in Genesis 50 where he says what you intended for what?
[time=3394] Evil.
[time=3395] God intended for what?
[time=3397] Good.
[time=3398] 20 plus years later, hear that 20 plus years later, it all comes to fruition.
[time=3404] And in the meantime, day after day after day, he calls you and he calls me to lives of character, lives of trust and a willingness, a willingness to live today with whatever it might bring with the realization that he is a good God and that he thoughtfully and with purpose orchestrates the events of my life.
[time=3424] I am never far from his love, and he causes all things to work together for good.
[time=3428] See, it's your theology.
[time=3430] It's your view of God, and it was Joseph's theology that allowed him to endure.
[time=3438] Keep that in mind.
[time=3439] Keep that in heart.
[time=3440] Would you stand?
[time=3441] And let's close this morning in a word of prayer.
[time=3446] God, how encouraging and how convicting it is to be here this morning and to look at this man, Joseph, this true hero of the faith who lived a heroic life in that he followed you.
[time=3460] He chose you in circumstance after circumstance, in situation after situation, God in the midst of it all, he chose you, chose to hang on to that which was right, chose to give himself to the things that honored you.
[time=3474] And even when it didn't pan out, even when the obedience didn't bring blessing necessarily, even though when his willingness to follow you brought great trial and difficulty to his life, God, he models for us today.
[time=3490] An enduring spirit and the willingness to look at life and not allow the circumstances of life to change our view of you.
[time=3501] And so God, please give us that kind of faith, God, please give us that kind of strength.
[time=3506] And for those who are here today and God, they're in the pit, whatever their pit might look like, they're in a prison, whatever that might be, and they need help and they need reassurance.
[time=3517] God allow us the privilege of coming alongside those, praying for them, just doing what we can to be for them what we know you are, a loving, guiding, caring God whose hand is never far.
[time=3530] God's strength is as we go, bring us back together again soon, and all the people agreed and said, amen.
[time=3560] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
