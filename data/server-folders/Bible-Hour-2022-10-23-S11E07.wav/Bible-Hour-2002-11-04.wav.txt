[time=100] - I get to pray, and praying is just talking to the Father.
[time=110] Shall we bow our heads before His presence?
[time=118] Father in Psalms 103, King David writes about you.
[time=126] He says, "You are gracious and merciful.
[time=131] "You are slow to get angry and full of unfailing love.
[time=136] "You do not constantly accuse us, "nor remain angry forever.
[time=142] "You will not punish us for all our sins, "nor do you treat us as we deserve.
[time=150] "For your love towards those who fear Him "is as great as the heights of the heavens are "above the earth.
[time=158] "You have removed our rebellious acts "as far away from us, "as the east is from the west.
[time=166] "In the book of John, you say that you have lavished "your love upon us.
[time=173] "In Psalms 145, it says that you shower us "with blessings.
[time=180] "And my voice this morning is gonna lift up to you "and give you all that you deserve this morning, Father, "for your greatness and your power and your love "and your mercy to me.
[time=194] "And the blessings on this church.
[time=199] "We love you, Father.
[time=200] "In your holy name, I pray.
[time=233] "In your holy name, I pray." "In your holy name, I pray.
[time=235] "In your holy name, I pray.
[time=1194] "So, I take a bite, my first bite of the cinnamon crunch bagel.
[time=1200] "And the very first words out of my mouth were, "SUSAN!" And I had to run the other end of the house and I said, "SUSIC!" She goes, "What?" I go, "This is one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth." It's really, I go, "I mean, I can't hardly describe it." So, I eat my cinnamon crunch bagel from Panera Bread.
[time=1220] I go do my auction and on my way back, I'm listening to praise and worship music, I think.
[time=1224] And I was here that or a tape and I'm listening and I'm thinking, "Oh, there's one more cinnamon crunch bagel."
[time=1233] And he ain't going to survive till the morning.
[time=1236] So, I go in, I go in the house because I didn't eat anything at that chef's thing.
[time=1239] And I come to that little brown bag, and in front of that little brown bag is now a piece of paper that wasn't there before.
[time=1245] And it's a note from Susan that says, "Sorry." [laughter] And I opened up the bag and it was gone.
[time=1255] And so, I wrote a note of my own and took it back to her.
[time=1260] And you know, I started being the evangelist for cinnamon crunch bagels at Panera Bread.
[time=1265] And I start telling everybody for like the next two days.
[time=1268] Well, it's funny, Susan and I were passing in the bathroom on a Thursday morning thinking about, "How am I going to get another cinnamon crunch bag?" I hadn't had one yet.
[time=1279] And I'm passing Susan in the bathroom and she goes, "Huh, I was just thinking, your mom's playing tennis by Panera Bread today.
[time=1285] I'm going to see if she'll get us some cinnamon crunch bagels." I mean, so we're all thinking about it all the time.
[time=1290] So, my mom gets them and brings them back and it's Friday.
[time=1294] And I'm working on this talk Friday and I'm deciding I'm going to have one of those cinnamon crunch bagels.
[time=1300] And I now got like six of them.
[time=1302] And I'm eating one and I'm leaving Greg decent these messages about how good they are.
[time=1306] And I mean, multiple.
[time=1308] And I tell them, I leave this one message that says, "You know, in the law of economics, there's this diminishing marginal returns concept.
[time=1313] Not true, man, with this." And I said, "You know, this is an oxymoron, cinnamon crunch bagel.
[time=1318] It's like diet, cinnamon roll. I don't think it's a bagel." But anyway, they start appearing, they appear mysteriously in my mailbox.
[time=1325] I've been telling everybody, people starting to give them to me.
[time=1328] I'm sitting there in my house and I'm putting the second one down.
[time=1332] And a Bible verse comes to my mind.
[time=1335] So, I'm 34-8, I think.
[time=1339] Taste and see that the Lord is good.
[time=1342] You know, and then another one came to my mind and that was Proverbs 4-23.
[time=1346] And that is above all else, guard your heart.
[time=1349] And you know what?
[time=1350] I had given my heart to those cinnamon crunch bagels and my stomach was hurting.
[time=1354] You know, and I OD'd eat on them.
[time=1357] And it just reminds me of my dad about five or six years ago, was given his heart in a way that he shouldn't.
[time=1365] And he was my best friend, my business partner, and my dad.
[time=1368] And I knew that this decision would have some ramifications that would be negative toward me because I knew that this decision did not honor God.
[time=1377] And I had an auction in January in Orlando.
[time=1382] A friend of mine who worked for Bill Bright, founder of Campus Crusade for Christ, was responsible for the four spiritual laws and millions of people coming to Christ through God's work through him.
[time=1391] My friend called and said, "Would you like to meet with Bill while you're here for the auction?" I said, "Yes." So, I met with Bill and I had these list of theological questions.
[time=1400] And when I was ready to go up to his office or to this room where we were going to meet, I went and I told him I said, "I got these lists of theological questions." He goes, "Let's go." "Shoot." And I said, "But I can't ask him." And he goes, "Why?" And I just, my heart started to break and I started to share with him what was going on in my life and with my dad and how difficult it was.
[time=1419] And I just wanted his wisdom.
[time=1421] And I got to tell you, this man was so vulnerable, so loving, so caring.
[time=1428] He made me feel like I was the only person on the planet.
[time=1431] And I couldn't help but think when I left how much he reminded me of my dad.
[time=1437] And at that moment in time, my dad was relying on his giftedness and Bill Bright was relying
[time=1443] on his godliness.
[time=1445] And not convenient for this message, but I really did think when I left Bill Bright's
[time=1451] office that I had truly met a man after God's own heart.
[time=1455] And that's what I want to talk about today is David, a man after God's own heart.
[time=1460] It's bookended in his life that he's a man after God's own heart.
[time=1463] At the beginning and at the end of his life, scripture records that David is a man after God's own heart.
[time=1469] And the heart, just for the purposes of this talk, I want you to understand that we're defining heart as your entire inner being, its direction.
[time=1476] The direction of your entire inner being.
[time=1479] King David, his name prompts many titles to mind, shepherd, warrior, king, father, husband,
[time=1487] poet, musician, architect, worshipper, but running parallel.
[time=1491] Running parallel to that list is another that includes adulterer, manipulator, murderer.
[time=1497] Conquering a real life giant, devastating military foes evading the lethal jealousy of his country's most powerful man, David's story provides enough twist to drama to make soap opera writers envious and country music singers blush.
[time=1511] Yet nearly one fourth of the Old Testament is devoted to this hero of the faith described, as I said, bookended in his life, peaks in valley's life he's described as a man after God's own heart.
[time=1521] And I just want to find out today with you, discover with you today, what is that?
[time=1526] What is a man or a woman after God's own heart?
[time=1530] Is it a title reserved for an exclusive audience of one?
[time=1534] Or can a sinner like me be a man or a woman after God's own heart?
[time=1539] The first thing that we see about David is a man after God's own heart leans on God like a shepherd.
[time=1546] David was a shepherd. He was young. He had a slingshot in hand.
[time=1550] He had a rod that you would toss to realign, a sheep if they were getting out of line.
[time=1555] He had the staff, which was a six foot long, the curved thing with the hand with the handle that he put his hand on, and that would gently guide the sheep to keep them.
[time=1564] He would protect them in the pastors of Israel.
[time=1567] At night, David and other shepherds would actually lie down protecting the sheep inside a cave
[time=1573] from animals outside the cave.
[time=1576] He would actually lay down his life and be the sheep gate or the sheep door.
[time=1582] A lot of times, shepherds would put all their sheep together in pens, and then the next morning, all they would have to do is make the sound of their voice, and their sheep would come running to the respective shepherds because sheep know the voice of the shepherd.
[time=1596] And the shepherd would never let sheep out of his sight because in Israel it's rocky, and there are cliffs, and a sheep can fall over a shorter cliff and get caught in a briar patch.
[time=1606] And if that would ever happen, the shepherd carries the lamb over his shoulders, like you've seen in pictures, and bring him to safety.
[time=1613] And with his family's livelihood at stake guarding their 1000 BC stock portfolio and retirement fund from Bears and Lions,
[time=1620] David gets time to know and be known by God.
[time=1623] He prays.
[time=1624] He recites parts of the Torah, the first five books of the Bible.
[time=1627] He meditates, and for a healthy climate with water that fosters fresh, green pastures, he trusts in the only one, the only one who can truly protect him, the one who gave him his first victory over the bear and the lion.
[time=1640] And he knows him as Yahweh, God, his shepherd.
[time=1644] Sheep trusts in their shepherd, but a shepherd like David trusts in the shepherd, in God,
[time=1650] because God is faithful.
[time=1653] And it's in this setting that Samuel finds the one God has chosen because he has searched the hearts of men
[time=1659] and boys to find a heart that was fully committed to him.
[time=1663] If you want to jot down Second Chronicles 16-9, says that God does that, that God searches for hearts who are fully committed to him.
[time=1671] And this is where we find Samuel the prophet, who's responding from a message from God,
[time=1678] who said, "I'm going to take the kingdom away from King Saul, who's foolish and not obeyed my commands,
[time=1684] and I'm going to give it to a man after my own heart, 1 Samuel 13-14." So if you turn to 1 Samuel 16, Samuel catches up with David.
[time=1693] And in verse 6, just going to read a couple verses here.
[time=1695] "When they arrived, Samuel saw Elias and thought, 'Surely the Lord's anointed stands here before the Lord.'
[time=1701] He thought that the oldest brother would be the one who was going to be anointed king.
[time=1705] But the Lord said to Samuel, 'Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him.'"
[time=1711] And here's what you hear all the time on the radio and hear people quote this.
[time=1715] 1 Samuel 16-7, "The Lord does not look at the things man looks at.
[time=1719] Man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart, the indirection of my entire inner being."
[time=1726] And you go down to verse 13 there, "Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers.
[time=1732] Only they saw this anointing. And from that day on, the spirit of the Lord came upon David in power.
[time=1740] And David leaned on God in humility." And in Psalm 23, David writes, Zodiacod, he's a biblical scholar, thinks that David writes this Psalm when he's fleeing from Saul who became jealous of David.
[time=1753] And he says, "The Lord is my shepherd. The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want."
[time=1760] David trusted in God as his shepherd.
[time=1764] You know, a Psalm, it's really neat what we've done today because a Psalm is meant to be sung.
[time=1769] A Psalm means words to be sung to a stringed instrument.
[time=1774] And it's interesting that somebody else writes a Psalm, Psalm 78, verses 70 through 72, verse 70, 70 and Psalm.
[time=1783] It says, "He chose David his servant and took him from the sheep pens. From tending the sheep, he brought him to be the shepherd of his people."
[time=1792] And verse 72 says, "And David shepherded them with integrity of heart, with a man after God's own heart, with skillful hands, he led them."
[time=1801] And one of the greatest stories I know that represent someone who trusts in God comes from a girl who was at Columbine during the shootings in Littleton, Colorado.
[time=1810] And her name is Cassie Bernal.
[time=1812] And I was speaking at a high school graduation about a month after that happened.
[time=1816] And I called the Youth for Christ President and asked him if he could put me in touch with anybody there I could talk to about what happened.
[time=1824] And I talked to Cassie Bernal's best friend.
[time=1826] Her name was Amanda Meyer and she told me the story this way. She said that I normally had lunch with Cassie every day in the library.
[time=1833] And we had studied the night before and we planned on meeting in the library around lunchtime.
[time=1838] And she says during that time there's usually 200 kids in the library, but that day they're only 40.
[time=1844] And she said, "I don't know why, but I accepted an invitation from two girls I barely knew to go to lunch." And it was when they went to Taco Bell and she said, "While I was there I got a little sauce on my blouse.
[time=1854] So I went home to change and came back and she came back to this horrendous scene." And she thought maybe there was an explosion in the chemistry lab from the fire and stuff that she saw.
[time=1864] And this is where her friends tell her what happened.
[time=1867] Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris were going through the school saying, "Jock, white hat." And they were looking for jocks and sports guys and they would shoot them when they found them.
[time=1877] And people would say, "Kids would say, "Oh my God." And they would say, "God, you believe in God?" And if you'd answer, "Yes, they'd shoot you." Well, they come to Cassie who's hiding under a table and they pull her out and they say, "Do you believe in God?"
[time=1894] And Cassie's mind, she was a junior, had to go back a couple years to a freshman who had written a note saying,
[time=1902] "I'm going to kill my teacher." And that freshman had it not been for intervention of parents and getting the student in a Christian school.
[time=1913] May have carried out just that act, but the student came to know Jesus Christ and the student is Cassie.
[time=1920] Cassie once knew what it was like to not know Jesus.
[time=1924] And she had this relationship with Jesus and so Cassie asked that question, "Do you believe in God?"
[time=1930] And that folds her hands, kids say that Sarr, like she was praying and said, "Yes."
[time=1937] And they shot her in the head and they killed her.
[time=1941] 30 days prior to that, Cassie's friend told me that 30 days prior to that, Cassie said,
[time=1947] "I can't wait to run into Jesus's arms." And the night before, she had written Amanda a note the night before her murder.
[time=1957] She said, "I want to live totally for God. It is really scary, but totally worth it.
[time=1962] I want to live totally for God." So I asked Amanda two questions.
[time=1966] I said, "I just got to know what's this done to your faith?" And she said, "Oh, I trust God now for everything." And I said, "I hope you don't mind. I just want to ask this question.
[time=1978] You don't have to answer it if you don't want to, but I just want to ask if you were there, what do you think you would have done?" And she said, "Is that question keeps going through my mind?" And she said, "I've thought about it every day.
[time=1989] I think about it all the time, and I do have an answer." And she said, "I know that God would give me the strength to say yes, just like He gave Cassie."
[time=2000] So you see, a man after God's own heart even trusts God for the faith.
[time=2006] Even trusts God for the faith.
[time=2008] And so we got to ask, "Where is your trust really?" When times are hard, do you trust God or do you trust yourself?
[time=2015] Where are you leaning really?
[time=2017] Is there something in your life today that you keep in your fingers on and you're not giving it to God?
[time=2022] Maybe it's money. Maybe it's a relationship.
[time=2025] Maybe it's a task that just has to be done your way and you're not open to any other ways.
[time=2030] Maybe you are relying on your giftedness and not your godliness.
[time=2035] And that's what solved that. Saul trusted in himself and he has this divided mind from trusting in himself.
[time=2042] And he becomes insecure and you just see this pattern in scripture of Saul's life.
[time=2046] Even when he's told he's going to be king, he's hiding among the baggage.
[time=2050] And in 1 Samuel 13, when God says, "I'm taking it away from him, it's because he's foolish.
[time=2055] He didn't keep God's commands." You know, he could, but he didn't.
[time=2060] And it goes on to say that David gets in Saul's kingdom and plays the heart for him because Saul gets depressed out of his insecurity.
[time=2069] And then as David becomes popular, Saul becomes afraid of David and he tries to kill David.
[time=2074] Even before he's out chasing him around, he tried to pin him twice against the wall with his spear as David's playing the heart for him.
[time=2081] And Saul went so far as to say, as to kill the priests at Knob.
[time=2088] But not David. David a man after God's own heart.
[time=2091] A man after God's own heart not only leans on God in total, unwavering commitment with a soft heart because God is faithful.
[time=2099] He loves God with a passion because he grows to love God like a warrior.
[time=2105] And it's the second concept here is to love God like a warrior, a man after God's own heart.
[time=2111] Love is the intentional and active pursuit of a man after God's own heart. It's the intentional and active pursuit by a man after God's own heart.
[time=2119] And that's for provision and protection of the loved.
[time=2123] In 1 Samuel 17, we catch up with David and he's going back and forth from a battlefront that's in Judah.
[time=2130] He's tending sheep and then he takes supplies to his brothers. His oldest three brothers are fighting there.
[time=2135] And he hears about this guy and he hears this guy's voice, Goliath, nine and a half feet tall, three feet taller than Kelly Bird.
[time=2144] His armor weighs 125 pounds.
[time=2148] That's just the end of his spear weighs 15 pounds.
[time=2152] And he offers a winner take all battle every day for 40 days mocking God.
[time=2158] And so this David who has this relationship with God from the shepherd fields brings us supplies and he hears this.
[time=2166] And he hears also this.
[time=2168] Saul was passing around that anyone who wins for Israel, this battle gets the king's daughter and just like in the movie Armageddon, no taxes.
[time=2178] And so David hears this.
[time=2180] And David's not as excited about that king's daughter, no taxes thing as this. He said, "Who is this who defies the armies of the living God?"
[time=2189] And he gets ready, he says, "The Lord who delivered me with my slingshot from the lion and the bear will deliver me from this guy."
[time=2198] It takes that slingshot and he knows how he felt the first time he killed that first lion or bear and he knows God did it.
[time=2206] And he hurls that thing and goes right into David's head, the glass head and he kills him.
[time=2214] And he has victory.
[time=2216] And you know God's desires just that we worship God with our life.
[time=2220] David was just doing what he did.
[time=2223] And he had an opportunity to worship God with his life.
[time=2226] And in that famous story about David in 2 Samuel 6 when they get the arc back, David dances before an audience of one.
[time=2233] He worships an audience of one.
[time=2235] A man after God's own heart loves like a warrior and that love makes room in his heart for others.
[time=2241] David also loves Saul's son Jonathan.
[time=2244] The Bible says he loved them with his soul.
[time=2247] They loved each other at the soul level.
[time=2249] And you know what?
[time=2250] David even loved Saul his enemy who was trying to kill him.
[time=2254] There was no limit to David's love.
[time=2258] And you know how Psalm 23 goes and how it finishes?
[time=2261] David talks about God leading him and guiding him and he says surely goodness and mercy.
[time=2266] Surely God's love will follow me all the days of my life because David sees his source of love as God.
[time=2273] 1 John 4 8 says that God is love.
[time=2276] 1 Timothy 1 5 says that love flows from a pure heart.
[time=2280] Love is the action that flows from a man or woman's heart who is after God.
[time=2286] We had a team meeting here a couple months ago and I asked the question.
[time=2290] I said you know we can't always name the last ten NBA champions in order.
[time=2296] We can't always name the last ten Indy 500 winners in order or Miss America pageant winners or whatever we want to say.
[time=2302] But what we can name is someone who loved us.
[time=2306] And so I said nobody gets a pass this time.
[time=2309] Let's everybody say a story and tell a story about someone who loved us radically.
[time=2315] And you sat around that room and it was like a worship service.
[time=2319] You had people telling about a mom or a dad or a cousin or a friend who went out of their way.
[time=2325] You know it was never, it was never.
[time=2327] You know what?
[time=2328] They let me call them once every three months or they let me send them a letter once every six.
[time=2332] It was always radical, intentional, active pursuit by that person to the person who was loved.
[time=2340] And the way we summed that whole thing up is we just said you know what?
[time=2344] Go love like that.
[time=2346] And that's what I'm asking you to do today is to go love like that, the pursuit of a warrior.
[time=2352] Kelly has pursued me like that for two years now.
[time=2358] We had our anniversary at the Willow Creek Conference a week ago.
[time=2362] And I felt like I should buy him chocolate or something.
[time=2365] But for two years he has pursued me for the kingdom of God in a loving relationship actively.
[time=2373] And so has Steve.
[time=2374] There was a time when Bill Hibles was talking at the conference and Hibles was talking about
[time=2381] two ways you might feel in ministry.
[time=2383] And he was describing a way that I was feeling.
[time=2386] But I didn't want to stand up because we had 55 or 58 people there and I thought they'd misunderstand why I was standing up and it was a matter of the heart that was going on inside of me.
[time=2396] And to make matters worse, my brother who's sitting beside me, he stands up and I'm thinking I'm not going to stand up.
[time=2400] I've just studied humility and pride for three years.
[time=2402] I know I was proud.
[time=2404] So I walk out of that conference and I'm just sobbing.
[time=2407] I'm starting to say as close to my brother as I can so nobody sees me and Steve Longbreak pursues me.
[time=2414] And he said I know what's going on.
[time=2416] And he said I look back to see if you stood up.
[time=2419] I'd never talked about this if he wouldn't have pursued me.
[time=2423] And he says Mitch go ahead and make your wife your number one earthly pursuit.
[time=2431] And I had talked to my daughter the night before and I said I had talked to her for more that night than I had in the couple weeks prior.
[time=2437] And basically I was in ministry and I was missing God and I was missing my family.
[time=2443] And Steve gave me the license, he pursued me and he said go love like that.
[time=2449] And you know what, you may, I called Susan by the way and told her what I was going to do.
[time=2454] I said you know I'm going to make you my number one earthly pursuit.
[time=2457] That's my take home from this conference.
[time=2459] And I think she gathered all the spiritual words she could come up with and she said no way.
[time=2466] And I said well yeah.
[time=2467] And she goes you think that's just what I want to hear.
[time=2470] I said no I really mean it took a big long time.
[time=2472] You can see how bad it was because I'm trying to get her to understand that I meant it.
[time=2476] And you know what, you may not have a nine and a half foot tall giant in your life.
[time=2481] But you may have a husband or a wife or a son or a daughter or a relative or a co-worker or a friend or an acquaintance who because of something that's happened to you, something inside of you, they appear that way to you when it comes to the active intentional pursuit of loving them.
[time=2499] And I just want you to write down today the name of the person you're going to pursue in love.
[time=2505] A man or a woman after God's own heart pursues love like a warrior because God is love
[time=2514] because God is loving.
[time=2516] Even Saul, even Saul was going to kill his own son Jonathan.
[time=2520] Well a man after God's own heart not only leans on God because God is faithful,
[time=2526] not only loves God because God is loving, but he learns to lead like a king because
[time=2533] God is Lord.
[time=2534] And David's life, Saul finally dies in battle and so does Jonathan and David becomes king of the kingdom.
[time=2540] And leadership is really a matter of the heart.
[time=2542] It is an influence of a heart toward God and others.
[time=2546] It's the influence of a man after God's own heart toward others.
[time=2550] It's someone who's contagious like some people are about cinnamon crunch bagels.
[time=2555] And I just want you to look at five things that a leader does and we see this in David's life.
[time=2560] A leader first casts and directs a vision that flows from God.
[time=2564] See the vision comes from God Proverbs 29, 18.
[time=2567] It comes from God because a leader sees God as Lord of all as total truth.
[time=2572] And if you want to write it down I won't go there but 2 Samuel 7.
[time=2576] God says to the prophet Nathan about David, I took him out of the shepherd and to shepherd my people.
[time=2582] I took him from shepherding sheep to shepherd my people.
[time=2586] I did all this.
[time=2587] And the second thing a leader does is unite others for the kingdom of God.
[time=2591] And you go on in 2 Samuel 7 and David prays and David says, God I know you did all this
[time=2597] for me and I give it all to you.
[time=2599] And that's what a leader does.
[time=2600] He unites others for the kingdom by giving them all back to God.
[time=2605] And 30 motivates others for the kingdom.
[time=2609] And you can be a leader today.
[time=2611] You can motivate people for the kingdom.
[time=2613] 2 Samuel 8, 7, it says that wherever David went, wherever he went, God gave him victory.
[time=2621] And 4th, a leader inspires change.
[time=2625] Inspires change for the kingdom of God because we need to change all the time.
[time=2629] We are fallen creatures and we're either going to be stubborn or we're going to be soft and change and grow in wisdom.
[time=2636] But David didn't always rely on his godliness.
[time=2639] Sometimes he did rely on his giftedness.
[time=2642] And in 2 Samuel 11, it says in the spring when kings went out to war, David stayed.
[time=2648] It says, but David stayed.
[time=2651] He's restless.
[time=2653] He needs a challenge.
[time=2656] And he's relying on himself.
[time=2659] And he sins in thought, in word, and indeed.
[time=2663] And he sees Bathsheba taking a bath and he calls for her and she comes to him.
[time=2670] And the Bible is really clear that she conceives a son from David.
[time=2675] The problem is that she's married.
[time=2677] She's married to one of David's.
[time=2679] You'll see in scripture of mighty men, one of his 30 mighty men.
[time=2683] Bobby Beal and Steve Arterburn have drawn a grid of what happens in your family environment as a child affects you as an adult.
[time=2690] And they say, if you feel destined as a child, which David would have felt, right?
[time=2695] He was anointed to be king.
[time=2698] If you feel destined as a child, then your main desire as an adult is to be significant.
[time=2703] And so your main adult phobia is insignificance.
[time=2707] And when you feel insignificant, your tendency is then to manipulate.
[time=2713] And so David manipulates.
[time=2715] He brings Uriah back.
[time=2717] He gets him hammered.
[time=2718] He gets him to go back and sleep with his wife so they'll think it was his child.
[time=2722] And it doesn't work.
[time=2723] And it's nothing's working.
[time=2724] So he finally sends Uriah's death sentence in a letter from the king to Joab the commander
[time=2730] of the army.
[time=2731] And Uriah carries his own death sentence on how they're going to kill him in battle on their own.
[time=2738] And writers of scripture say, I mean scholars say that the writer of Samuel has Samuel just
[time=2749] going like this, up up up on the life of David until you get to 2 Samuel 11.
[time=2755] Because that's the sin with Bathsheba and that's the manipulation and that's the murder.
[time=2760] But then God sends Nathan the prophet to David and he tells him this story so the king will
[time=2766] listen about a family that had one lamb and a family that had a lot of them, a metaphor
[time=2772] of David's wives and Uriah's wife.
[time=2775] And he tells him this story about how when the guy that had all these lambs needed one, he took that one from the guy next door.
[time=2783] And David it says his anger rage and he said, that man will pay fourfold.
[time=2792] And you thought the phrase was coined in a movie, Nathan looks at David and says, you
[time=2798] the man.
[time=2800] And David immediately, just like he worships before an audience of one, he repents before
[time=2806] an audience of one and he says, I have sinned against the Lord.
[time=2813] But the writer of scripture seems to be showing us that David gets his own fourfold judgment
[time=2820] pronounced on himself because the son with Bathsheba dies.
[time=2824] And then Amnon, David's oldest son, rapes David's daughter, his sister from another mother,
[time=2831] he rapes her.
[time=2832] That's the second one.
[time=2833] The third one is Absalom, one of David's sons, kills Amnon for raping his sister.
[time=2839] And it just becomes a mess.
[time=2841] And this whole deal with Absalom gets bigger and bigger and finally David flees and they
[time=2849] end up going in battle and Absalom is killed in battle.
[time=2853] And that's the fourth thing.
[time=2855] And David wasn't doing so good on the father thing.
[time=2859] And David writes like we sang today in Psalm 51, creating me a clean heart, oh God, renew
[time=2866] a right spirit within me.
[time=2868] David writes a song for all to sing about his transgression.
[time=2874] He's the original country music writer.
[time=2877] But can you imagine that the authenticity and the transparency of David to write a song for all to sing about his transgression?
[time=2886] And David writes in Psalm 103, 10, God, you do not give us a one-for-one punishment of
[time=2892] our sin.
[time=2895] About a year ago in February, there was a nuclear submarine commander, his name was Scott Wattle.
[time=2900] And he allowed 16 civilians, including two put at the controls in his nuclear sub off
[time=2907] the waters of Diamond Head in Hawaii.
[time=2910] And while all that was happening, they hit a Japanese fishing boat, killing nine of the 37 on board, including four 17-year-old students.
[time=2919] And in a day of political cover-up, you remember, commander Wattle admitted his wrong.
[time=2925] He accepted full responsibility and his confession was followed by numerous job offers and speaking
[time=2932] engagements.
[time=2932] It's just something attractive about a person who will repent authentically.
[time=2937] And that's the fifth thing that a leader does is he repents authentically.
[time=2942] And the reason is he sees every encounter like David does as an opportunity, as a divine encounter to point a person toward God.
[time=2950] David is this leader who's contagious for God.
[time=2952] He has the divine appointment worldview, but not Saul.
[time=2956] Saul's heart was hard.
[time=2958] And so I want to ask you, do you have that, you point people to something or someone,
[time=2964] why not make it God?
[time=2966] Why not put in your Microsoft Outlook at the top divine appointment?
[time=2971] And make a decision today that you're going to point every single person toward God in thought, word, or deed, whatever that is.
[time=2978] And I'd like you maybe to write down right now, who is that person that you're in a redemptive relationship with that you're trying to point toward God?
[time=2985] And if there's not a person, if a name doesn't come to mind, pray to God and ask Him for one.
[time=2989] And invite that person to our Christmas thing so they can see the gospel message, see the
[time=2995] life of Christ in an original drama with music and the barriers can come down and they can have an opportunity to say yes to God.
[time=3002] Well, a man after God's own heart not only leans on God because God is faithful, loves
[time=3008] God because God is loving, leads others, because God is Lord and He is truth.
[time=3014] A man after God's own heart seizes his opportunity to live like a father.
[time=3019] At the end of David's life, this is where he is, you know, the parenting thing wasn't too good.
[time=3025] And he's going to find out that what parents do in moderation, children will do in excess.
[time=3031] And his son Solomon, who's, interestingly enough, is born to David and Bathsheba, he would become king.
[time=3038] And David recognizes his weak parenting and he gives Solomon this charge in 1 Kings 2.
[time=3044] And it's recorded also in other parts of Chronicles.
[time=3049] And David says to Solomon, Solomon, give a wholehearted devotion, wholehearted devotion
[time=3055] and a willing mind to God.
[time=3056] Because Solomon, God tests the heart.
[time=3059] He tests your heart and is pleased with integrity, a humble heart who walks with God.
[time=3065] And Solomon does that.
[time=3066] He asks for wisdom when God says you can have anything.
[time=3070] But you know what?
[time=3072] What you're doing today as a parent in moderation, your children will probably do in excess.
[time=3076] He takes David's polygamy and Solomon has 700 wives and 300 concubines.
[time=3082] And 1 Kings 11, 3 says that they led him astray.
[time=3085] You know, you and I have a choice.
[time=3088] We have a choice to give our heart to God.
[time=3091] And Psalm 86, 15, David said, God is gracious.
[time=3096] That means that God stoops down and bends down to one who is inferior.
[time=3100] I'd like to close with this story.
[time=3104] They've just recently figured out how Antonio Strata various, the maker of the great violins, one of his violins would sell the day for a million dollars.
[time=3112] And they've just figured out why?
[time=3114] Because they have not been able to figure out why they sound so good.
[time=3120] And they found out why.
[time=3121] He lived in Italy.
[time=3122] And where he got his wood for his violins and where people in that town got woods for making
[time=3128] ship or for anything they made was from a murky swampy pit.
[time=3133] That's the only place they had to get the wood.
[time=3136] And scientists have discovered that when wood is soaked in a pit like that, it develops these microbes inside these holes inside that lets the sound resonate in that violin when
[time=3149] the violinist takes his bow in place.
[time=3153] And right now, you probably have holes in your heart from things that have happened
[time=3160] to you.
[time=3161] And will you let God have your heart and let him play you as an instrument and let his love and his character and his heart resonate through you?
[time=3171] David writes in Psalm 1034 that God redeems me.
[time=3176] That's what Doug read.
[time=3177] God redeems me from the pit.
[time=3180] And I want to ask what pit are you in today?
[time=3184] Is it finance?
[time=3185] Is it physical pain?
[time=3186] Is it relational hurt?
[time=3188] Is it stress?
[time=3189] Is it spiritual denial?
[time=3191] You know in Hebrews 11 it talks about David being a man of faith.
[time=3196] And it says that these men of faith sought God with all their heart.
[time=3200] It says these men of faith let their weaknesses become strong by giving them to God.
[time=3206] And these men of faith never got to see what you and I get to see.
[time=3210] And that's Jesus Christ who in its ultimate clarity showed us the kingdom of God and that
[time=3216] it can enter the human heart today.
[time=3218] Jesus said I am gentle and humble in heart.
[time=3223] And God tells Moses on a mountain that I'm gracious.
[time=3226] It's where David got it.
[time=3227] I bow down and stoop to those who are inferior to me.
[time=3231] And if you've walked with God today, maybe you need to acknowledge that he has been faithful to you.
[time=3236] He has been loving to you.
[time=3238] He has led you.
[time=3240] He has given you life.
[time=3241] And if you're hurting Psalm 3418, David writes that God is close to those, close to those
[time=3249] who are hurting.
[time=3250] He saves those who are crushed in spirit.
[time=3253] And you know it's Jesus who's the good shepherd and who is faithful.
[time=3256] It's Jesus Christ who is love and demonstrates love.
[time=3260] It's Jesus Christ who the Bible says is Lord of all.
[time=3264] It's Jesus Christ who said he who has seen me has seen the heart of the Father.
[time=3271] And if you don't know Jesus today, I've asked Eric and Hugh to come up.
[time=3277] If you don't know Jesus today, I'd like you to realize how good he's been to you.
[time=3285] How good he has been to you.
[time=3287] And Romans 2.4 says it's that goodness, that kindness that leads you to him.
[time=3292] David wrote in Psalm 145.9, God is good and gracious, compassionate to all he has made.
[time=3300] So I invite you now to just bow your heads.
[time=3303] Just bow your heads.
[time=3304] And I'd like this song to be considered your prayer today as Eric sings.
[time=3311] God is so good.
[time=3315] He is so loving.
[time=3316] He is so faithful.
[time=3318] Won't today, won't you just wait today as you hear this song?
[time=3324] I can picture almost David singing this song.
[time=3327] Would you just ask God for him right now, for whatever it takes in your life that you're holding on to, let him touch your heart and make it like his because a man after God's
[time=3339] own heart and a woman after God's own heart receives the heart of the loving Father.
[time=3346] Take this your prayer.
[time=3376] What a good God, you've been to me.
[time=3389] Your goodness and your grace, every day you go, I see what else can I do to give my
[time=3404] thanks to you.
[time=3409] What a good God, you've been to me.
[time=3418] What a faith from God, you've been low to me.
[time=3426] Won't you provide it for me on everything I'd ever need.
[time=3437] So what else can I do but give my thanks to you?
[time=3447] What a faith for God, you've been to me.
[time=3454] What a loving God, you've been to me.
[time=3465] You shed your blood on the cross, so I stand here and be free.
[time=3476] So what else can I do but give my deepest heartfelt thanks to you?
[time=3488] What a loving God, you've been.
[time=3494] What a faith for God, you've been.
[time=3501] What a good God, you've been to me.
[time=3518] And now, go lean like a shepherd, go love like a warrior, go lead like a humble king, and
[time=3532] go live like you loving father, God bless you, have a great week, good Christmas.
