[time=60] ♫ He knows your name ♫
[time=80] ♫ He knows your every thought ♫

[time=96] ♫ And he hears you when you call ♫
[time=114] - Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, and this is Mitchell Crews, and we are pastors here at Blackhawk, and we come to you today from inside the auditorium here.
[time=124] This is the worship center here at Blackhawk, and this is the place where the Blackhawk family comes together every week for the privilege of worship.
[time=132] This is the room where each week that you tune in.
[time=136] You join us, and we're here to tell you, that in about three weeks, this room is going to be in this facility, this whole campus really, is going to be completely and absolutely transformed, changed into a city.
[time=150] That's right, we're going to, as part of our Christmas with Blackhawk celebration, change this place into a town, a place called Hope, a literal town, with that name, and there is so much that comes with that name.
[time=164] There is so much about the word Hope.
[time=166] Hope is a powerful, powerful truth.
[time=169] - It really is, as Kelly said, you're going to walk in here as an attendee of the Christmas with Blackhawk series, and you're going to come into the community of Hope during the Hope Festival, and it's just going to be incredible, and Hope is such a powerful and intrinsic feeling and fact that we want to have in our lives.
[time=187] I remember 10 years ago, sitting at my desk in my office and saying, "God, I just need Hope." And I have only found that Hope in one person, and that's in who God is.
[time=201] And it's like a little girl who looked at me in the eyes just this week, all she wanted was Hope.
[time=208] And wherever you are, whether it's in your workplace, in a relationship, Hope, it's what you're looking for.
[time=216] And as part of that, as part of demonstrating the community of Hope, we're offering a special needs concert on the second Saturday of the series at 10.30 in the morning, and it's for those who are mentally and physically handicapped with disabilities, and we're just trying to demonstrate the community of Hope and present the message of Hope to them.
[time=238] We're looking forward to it.
[time=239] It's a special, special time with those who physically and mentally live every day, almost every hour, in need of Hope, and even for those that live with them, parents and caregivers and friends, we can't wait to offer our concert and our production and hopefully infuse into their hearts and minds that true sense of Hope.
[time=263] So anyway, we've got December 13th is when this all kicks off.
[time=268] Friday, Saturday, Sunday, the 13th, the 14th, and the 15th.
[time=272] And then the following week as well, the 20th, the 21st, and 22nd of December.
[time=278] And we're literally seeing tickets by the hour dwindle, and we don't want you to miss it.
[time=284] And so there'll be some information for you on the screen.
[time=286] You can come by our ticket office.
[time=288] That ticket office is now on our North Campus.
[time=292] You can call us for directions if you need it.
[time=294] We've got general admission free tickets still to give away.
[time=297] And we've also got reserve seating, $10 tickets.
[time=300] There's a few of those left, so you may want to get on that soon.
[time=303] We hope to see you there.
[time=304] Absolutely.
[time=305] Come to Hope.com.
[time=306] We've even got the wristbands.
[time=308] Come to Hope.com.
[time=309] It's at the website.
[time=310] Check that out on the website.
[time=311] That is come to Hope.com.
[time=313] And what's that?
[time=315] It's not just you coming.
[time=317] We're not just trying to say, hey, come buy a ticket, or hey, get your tickets.
[time=320] It's true.
[time=321] But it's-- who's going to come with you?
[time=323] You and who else?
[time=324] Yeah.
[time=324] I mean, it's a chance to have all these resources be invested in a person that you're in relationship with who needs Hope.
[time=332] Yeah.
[time=333] We hope to see you there.
[time=335] He knows your name.
[time=338] He knew it before you did.
[time=340] He knew it before your mom and dad did.
[time=342] As a matter of fact, he knows a name for you that you don't even know.
[time=347] The Bible says in Revelation chapter 2, there's a white stone with your real name on it.
[time=352] And he knows what it is already.
[time=354] And it describes who you are.
[time=356] It may be a brand new word.
[time=358] It probably is.
[time=359] For some of you, it better be a new word because you're pretty unique.
[time=362] Isaiah chapter 43 says, but now this is what the Lord says.
[time=370] "He who created you, O Jacob, he who formed you, O Israel."
[time=376] Fear not, for I have redeemed you.
[time=380] I've called you by name.
[time=382] You are mine.
[time=383] He knows my name.
[time=388] And I'm going to know it too someday.
[time=394] I'm going to know who I really am.
[time=396] And I'm in the process of discovering the man God designed me to be.
[time=404] In power equipment, that's one of the things that we've been learning the last few weeks is how to be the masculine man that's balanced the way God wants us to be balanced as a man, to be the man he designed us to be.
[time=418] Not the one that the world keeps telling us we ought to be.
[time=421] Not the one that in my own flesh I try to figure out but who it is he wants me to be.
[time=428] And Joshua had a really good handle on that.
[time=432] That's who we're going to look at today.
[time=434] This hero of the faith this week is one of those guys that in the Scripture is flawless.
[time=443] You can't find a weakness in him.
[time=445] Now I know he wasn't perfect, but the Bible doesn't reveal any of his weakness to us.
[time=450] Joshua, servant of man who's faithful to do that.
[time=460] We're going to see in a few minutes.
[time=462] He did it for more than 40 years as Moses ate.
[time=466] Servant of man, Moses ate.
[time=469] Then servant of God.
[time=472] Now the reality is he was serving God while he was Moses' aid.
[time=477] But we recognize him.
[time=478] God gives him the name servant of God at the end of his life.
[time=485] Incredible man.
[time=488] I hope that as we look through this passage of Scripture today, first of all you'll rest in the reality that he knows your name.
[time=497] He's already called you.
[time=499] Psalm 139 says he knew you before you were knit together in your mother's womb.
[time=504] He knew everything there was to know about you.
[time=506] He's the only one who did.
[time=510] And you can rest in the reality that he has chosen you to be his son or daughter.
[time=517] He's selected you and adopted you into his family.
[time=520] If you know Christ as your Savior, you can rest in that.
[time=525] And then you can be challenged too.
[time=528] Because what he wants from us is what he wanted from Joshua.
[time=533] A wholehearted attitude of service.
[time=538] And today we'll get to look at this great man of God who's an example for you and for me as servant of man when it was necessary and servant of God.
[time=551] Lord help us please.
[time=554] I don't want to make one mistake up here today.
[time=558] I want the truth to resonate in this room that people might hear it, that it would reverberate in their hearts and they'd be changed because of what you say, not because of what I say.
[time=572] So I just ask you please, Lord, to guide and direct us and help us become the men and women of God that you've designed us to be
[time=583] as we study this great servant of yours.
[time=588] Please help us.
[time=590] In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=594] Deuteronomy 34, absorb will start.
[time=599] Moses dies.
[time=601] It's good news.
[time=603] It's really good news.
[time=604] It's really, really good news for Moses.
[time=608] Most places in the world today you aren't finding people shouting and saying hallelujah that they're going, but it's really good.
[time=614] I've got a good friend, you know, Kim Holloway is one of our teachers.
[time=618] And he's taken a man into his home.
[time=620] He and his wife have come, Kim and Tina take care of them.
[time=624] They have for years.
[time=625] Well, the wife died a few years ago.
[time=628] The husband's in his 90s and every time he has a little pain here he goes, yes, yes.
[time=636] He can't wait to go.
[time=638] The doctors think he's kind of whacked out because he really comes in and they'll try to treat him and he'll go, well, what's that going to do?
[time=645] You know, there's something, I don't want to do that and I don't want.
[time=650] I think Moses was ready.
[time=652] Look at Deuteronomy chapter 34.
[time=655] Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, right before Joshua.
[time=664] In verse 5 it says, "And Moses the servant of the Lord died there in Moab." Good news for Moses, hard for the people.
[time=675] And they buried him.
[time=676] Look at verse 9.
[time=678] It says, "Now Joshua, son of none, was filled with the spirit of wisdom
[time=684] because Moses had laid his hands on him.
[time=686] So the Israelites listened to him and did what the Lord had commanded Moses.
[time=691] And we're going to go back and look in the Old Testament at how all that transpired.
[time=696] But understand this, God chose Joshua to serve Moses.
[time=703] Look at Joshua chapter 1 just for a minute.
[time=705] And the death of Moses, after the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, the Lord said to Joshua, son of none, Moses, aid.
[time=714] Moses, my servant is dead.
[time=716] Now then you and all these people will get ready to cross the Jordan.
[time=719] Moses, aid.
[time=722] A few years ago I preached a sermon on being the lead follower.
[time=728] If you've got leadership gifts and a strong personality and God's placed you in a position where you're supposed to submit to somebody else, be the best one at it.
[time=739] Be the best one at submitting to them.
[time=741] Be the lead follower if God's given you strength and leadership gifts.
[time=745] But at this point in time, he has you in a position where you're under the authority of someone else.
[time=752] Be the lead follower.
[time=755] Joshua had a handle on that.
[time=758] For more than 40 years.
[time=760] For more than 40 years, he did what Moses asked him to do.
[time=765] And he enabled Moses that God had chosen to lead at that time to do the job that God wanted Moses to do.
[time=774] This lead follower, the aid of Moses, enabled him.
[time=780] If you've been through network, you know that a lot of spiritual gifts don't have the same pizzazz as others.
[time=788] And a lot of people say, man, I'd like to have this gift or that gift.
[time=791] Look what they get to do.
[time=796] What we really understand as we move through the process of going through that life skill training is that all those spiritual gifts are really, really significant.
[time=806] And because you have the gift of helps or the gift of service, you might sometimes think, wow, this isn't very important.
[time=814] How well do you think Moses would have done without Joshua?
[time=819] I've been telling people that for years.
[time=820] I told Dave Jeremiah, he needed me.
[time=823] I told Rick, he needed me.
[time=825] I told Russell, he needed me.
[time=826] I told Kelly.
[time=828] I'm in the process of telling Kelly, he hasn't gotten that yet.
[time=834] I've been a follower.
[time=835] I've been in a position of following their lead and following the leadership of our elder board collectively.
[time=844] I've been in a position of, it's really important for me to help lead other followers to follow the elders.
[time=850] When they make a collective decision, it was right.
[time=854] Might not have been the one I would have made.
[time=856] I was wrong.
[time=860] Really important to understand your role and pursue your role that he's given you.
[time=867] Joshua had a handle on it.
[time=871] He started in Exodus 17, he had his first mission.
[time=876] He went out to defeat the Amalekites.
[time=881] Moses told him to choose some men and go out and fight the Amalekites in Exodus 17.
[time=886] Joshua did that.
[time=888] It's interesting in that chapter, the Bible says that God was going to wipe out the memory
[time=895] of Amalek, the king, except he wanted Joshua to remember him.
[time=900] So he called Joshua to the tent and he said, "You are going to remember this and you're
[time=906] going to put, oh, an altar together to help remind other people of something that happened here, but I'm going to wipe out the memory of Amalek." Can you imagine that?
[time=915] God just, somebody was so anti-God, he did not only wipe him out, he wiped out the memory
[time=921] of him so nobody didn't even remember him.
[time=926] So he blotted out the memory of Amalek.
[time=932] Then in Exodus 24, with Moses on Mount Sinai, goes Joshua.
[time=941] Joshua stays at the tent of the meeting.
[time=944] What happened was when the children of Israel were wandering through the desert, now remember,
[time=950] the children of Israel were disobedient.
[time=952] They came out of Egypt.
[time=954] God was taking them to the promised land, Canaan, and their disobedience, he commanded that they would not set foot in Canaan, the promised land.
[time=963] He promised it to Abraham, from the Euphrates on the east to the Mediterranean on the west,
[time=971] from the desert to Lebanon.
[time=975] God said, "That land is going to be for my descendants, Abraham's descendants, sorry, for Abraham's descendants, and had been hundreds of years, but they were going to get it.
[time=986] But the people were so disobedient that God said, "You're going to wander in the desert forty years after you left Egypt here, and Moses will lead you, and none of you are going to get to step into the promised land except for two faithful, wholehearted servants of
[time=1001] mine, Joshua and Caleb, and the children who didn't know the difference between right and wrong," that's what it says in there.
[time=1012] So it went with Moses there.
[time=1014] Well, as they were wandering in the desert, God had Moses put a tent outside the camp.
[time=1022] So there was a tent of meeting outside the camp, and God would come there, and everybody
[time=1028] who wanted to ask of God was supposed to go to the tent of meeting and come to God in
[time=1035] prayer and ask of Him what they wanted to ask.
[time=1038] So people would venture outside the camp, go to the tent of meeting.
[time=1041] When Moses went there, they'd see the pillar of cloud come down.
[time=1046] When Moses was in the tent, the pillar of cloud would be at the entrance of the tent, and the Bible says that Moses had conversation with God as a man face-to-face, unbelievable.
[time=1055] You know what it says?
[time=1058] It says, "Joshua was with him," and then it says this, "and when Moses left, Joshua
[time=1064] stayed there." He just stayed at the tent of meeting.
[time=1067] It doesn't say how long he stayed.
[time=1070] It says, "Joshua stayed at the tent of meeting."
[time=1076] For God to note that, it must be significant.
[time=1080] If you're supposed to go out there to seek God, and he just stayed there, it must be significant.
[time=1089] In Numbers chapter 13, those 12 explorers that I was telling you about got sent out.
[time=1095] They got, 12 explorers got sent out into Canaan to come back and give report, remember?
[time=1101] 12 guys representing the 12 tribes of Israel, when they came back, 10 said too big, too big,
[time=1111] too many, too powerful, Joshua and Caleb ripped their clothing and said, "Who do you think
[time=1121] you're too big for whom, too big for whom, too big for him?"
[time=1131] Of course not.
[time=1132] They were talking about too big for us, 10 of them were going to depend on themselves and the nation of Israel, two of them were whole-hearted servants of the living God,
[time=1144] and they said, "Not too big, not too big." And so God gave them the privilege of going into Canaan with the children who did not know right from wrong, Caleb and Joshua got to enter into the Promised Land.
[time=1163] They followed the Lord wholeheartedly.
[time=1168] What's that look like today for you?
[time=1171] Just stop for a second and think.
[time=1173] What does a whole-hearted devotion look like in your life?
[time=1180] Does a whole-hearted devotion look like a little bit of time on Sunday?
[time=1185] Throw in some Sunday night once in a while, toss in some Wednesday service opportunities?
[time=1192] Whole-hearted?
[time=1194] Does it look like add to that some devotional time each morning?
[time=1197] Making sure I read the Bible?
[time=1199] Whole-hearted?
[time=1203] A whole-hearted, devoted follower of Jesus Christ is a person who is immersed in kingdom-thinking
[time=1211] all the time.
[time=1214] That's Joshua.
[time=1216] That's Caleb.
[time=1217] They made their choices based on a relationship that they had with him.
[time=1229] And God says to him, "When Moses died, okay, now I've set you up here.
[time=1236] Now, now, now get this, be strong and courageous."
[time=1243] Joshua chapter one, it says, "After the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, the Lord
[time=1252] said to Joshua, 'Son of none, Moses, aid.
[time=1255] Moses my servant is dead.
[time=1256] Now then you and all these people get ready to cross the Jordan River into the land I'm about to give to them, to the Israelites.
[time=1263] I will give you every place where you set your foot as I promised Moses.
[time=1266] Your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon, from the great river to the Euphrates, all the Hittite country to the great sea on the west, Mediterranean.
[time=1274] No one will be able to stand up against you all the days of your life as I was with Moses, so I will be with you, I will never leave you nor forsake you.
[time=1284] Okay, you whole-hearted, devoted follower of me, I'll never leave you."
[time=1291] Can you imagine that?
[time=1297] Can you imagine the Holy Spirit dwelling in you all the time?
[time=1305] Can you imagine being filled up with the Spirit of God as a whole-hearted follower of Christ and what that might look like in your life?
[time=1316] I'll never leave you, I'll never forsake you." That's what he said.
[time=1320] In verse 6, look at that.
[time=1323] He says, "Be strong and courageous." I'll never leave you, I'll never forsake you.
[time=1326] Okay, now that you know that, be strong and courageous.
[time=1331] Be strong and courageous because you will lead these people to inherit the land I swore to their forefathers to give them.
[time=1337] Be strong and courageous because you're going to lead these people.
[time=1340] Now guess what?
[time=1341] It's hard.
[time=1342] Be strong and courageous because to lead them is a difficult task.
[time=1348] That's what he says.
[time=1349] First of all, you need strength and you need courage, I'll never leave you, I'll never forsake you.
[time=1354] I'll be that strength and that courage, but you have to know it.
[time=1358] I love the word "be." Whenever I see it in there, whenever I see the word "be" in the Bible, I think about the fact that God called himself, "I am."
[time=1370] Be is present like that.
[time=1372] I mean, I'm being courageous and strong all the time because I am the God who's always
[time=1383] present is the present.
[time=1390] You can lead these people.
[time=1393] Be strong and courageous.
[time=1395] Verse 7, he says it over again.
[time=1397] This time he goes, "Now, be strong and very courageous." Now God, you told me you'll be with me, you'll never leave me, you'll never forsake me.
[time=1406] You follow that with "be strong and courageous." Now you say, "be strong and very courageous." Look at this.
[time=1410] Be careful to obey all the law my servant Moses gave you.
[time=1414] Do not turn from it to the right or to the left.
[time=1416] Be strong that you may be successful wherever you go.
[time=1424] Now why do you suppose he says "be strong and very courageous" when it's about being
[time=1430] obedient to the law?
[time=1434] I think being obedient is harder than leading people.
[time=1441] Being obedient means there are all kinds of times when I feel like I'm alone.
[time=1449] Now I am is with me.
[time=1451] I feel like I'm alone and in those situations when I make choices, I need to be very courageous
[time=1460] and strong.
[time=1461] Why?
[time=1462] Because I'll deceive my own self into making choices that I can justify because they make
[time=1470] me feel better.
[time=1476] Be strong and very courageous.
[time=1477] It isn't easy.
[time=1480] Be obedient to the law.
[time=1483] You guys, if you're not hiding this in your heart, you can't be obedient to it when you
[time=1491] don't have it.
[time=1495] If you aren't in the process of learning the principles that are in this book, if you're not really inhaling the very breath of God, then you can't possibly make choices that
[time=1513] are going to be pleasing to him.
[time=1515] Be strong and very courageous.
[time=1517] Be obedient.
[time=1518] And here's the other thing, it won't make sense a lot of the time.
[time=1523] The reason it's hard to be obedient to the Bible in some cases is it doesn't make sense because you know what?
[time=1528] It makes your son or daughter unhappy.
[time=1531] That doesn't make sense.
[time=1533] It makes your wife unhappy.
[time=1535] It makes your husband unhappy.
[time=1536] It makes the people that you work with unhappy.
[time=1541] Being obedient is hard because often it causes division and it doesn't make sense.
[time=1555] Be sure and use the rod on your child, surely they will not die, then they'll love you.
[time=1563] Well, I agree with the psychologist.
[time=1566] That makes no sense whatsoever.
[time=1569] But God chose to reveal clearly to us that if we love them, we will discipline them.
[time=1575] It says with the rod, not by telling them, "Time out."
[time=1582] I'm sorry, I probably hurt some of you.
[time=1585] That doesn't make sense, but if you're obedient to it, with all my heart I believe that it
[time=1592] works, lots of principles like that in the Bible.
[time=1598] So he says, "Be strong and courageous.
[time=1599] Lead the people.
[time=1600] Be strong and very courageous.
[time=1601] Be obedient to the law." Then he says, "Be strong and courageous." And this is really interesting, he says, "Don't be too terrified, and don't be discouraged."
[time=1613] Because you know what?
[time=1614] You're going to be terrified and discouraged.
[time=1616] Look at it, verse nine, chapter one, says, "Have I not commanded you?
[time=1624] Be strong and courageous?" Yes, you have.
[time=1626] Two times previous to this, Lord.
[time=1627] As a matter of fact, even in earlier in my life you did, do not be terrified.
[time=1633] Do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.
[time=1638] Now, you know what?
[time=1641] That's not good news.
[time=1642] If somebody says to you, "Be strong and courageous three times," that's not good news.
[time=1647] If on the third time he says, "Be strong and courageous and don't be terrified," that's bad, bad news.
[time=1653] That means there are going to be some experiences coming up that in my natural condition I'm going to respond to those in terror.
[time=1661] I'm going to be scared, and he says, "Don't be scared because I'll be with you."
[time=1669] You can move through those times, and you don't have to fear.
[time=1673] You don't have to be, and he uses the word terrified because I'll be with you.
[time=1678] I told you, "I'll never leave you, I'll never forsake you." It's got nothing to do with you, Joshua.
[time=1685] It's got nothing to do with you, Steve.
[time=1687] Just choosing not to be afraid because you're going to be tough isn't the answer, understanding
[time=1694] that you don't have to be terrified when you're terrified because he's with you is the answer.
[time=1704] Be strong and courageous, not terrified, and then you know what?
[time=1708] If you're going to do number one, be strong and courageous and lead people, number three is going to be a reality, you're going to be strong and courageous and discouraged.
[time=1718] Discouraging circumstances come into your life when you lead people, and I don't care at what level you're leading them.
[time=1725] The most significant one, in my opinion, isn't some organizational structure, it's what's going on in your families right now.
[time=1734] It can be really, really discouraging, but he says he'll be with us.
[time=1741] He says, "Do it my way," and then there's a promise that comes with that.
[time=1744] He says, "You're going to prosper." That's what he says on the second point.
[time=1748] He said, "Be strong and very courageous, be obedient, and you'll prosper in the long run, but get ready because it might feel like terror.
[time=1759] It might feel like discouragement." I don't know about you, but I experience that stuff.
[time=1767] I get scared.
[time=1769] When you're in leadership in any capacity, there are times when things are scarier than others.
[time=1777] Over the course of time here at the church, I remember lots of different times when it seemed like, "Wow, we are in a jam this time." I don't care if it's financial or immorality or all kinds of things that come up that might terrorize the place.
[time=1792] There have been a lot of times when we've thought we better get slick here and figure out a way and we start to do things, that doesn't work.
[time=1800] Sometimes he brings you through those circumstances to help you grow more attached to him.
[time=1805] I believe that with all my heart.
[time=1806] We struggle because he wants us to go through the fire, persevering through it, creates a
[time=1812] relationship in which I'm attached to him in such a way that I'm empowered by him and I can move through those terrorizing circumstances and the discouraging ones.
[time=1822] He takes me through them to prepare me for the next ones that might be worse.
[time=1828] That's not good news.
[time=1829] But he says, "I'll be with you." That's good news.
[time=1832] I'll not forsake you.
[time=1833] That's good news.
[time=1835] Well, how do people respond?
[time=1838] Look at verse 16.
[time=1840] They respond the way they always do, they lie.
[time=1847] You know people like this.
[time=1849] Maybe you are people like this.
[time=1850] Then they answered Joshua, "Whatever you have commanded us, we will do."
[time=1856] That's what they told Moses.
[time=1858] And wherever you send us, we will go just as we fully obeyed Moses, huh?
[time=1866] I'd be saying, I'd be standing and going, "No, don't do it that way."
[time=1874] Just as we fully obeyed Moses, "So we will obey you.
[time=1879] May the Lord your God be with you as he was with Moses.
[time=1883] Whoever rebels against your word and does not obey your words, whatever you may command them, will be put to death, only be strong and courageous." Now, why could they say these things?
[time=1892] Well, think about it.
[time=1893] All those are disobedient ones, they died.
[time=1897] They're dead.
[time=1898] They're ready to cross into the Promised Land.
[time=1900] We've got all those disobedient ones dead.
[time=1907] And these people are able to say that and get ready to occupy the land.
[time=1912] Now, verse 18 real quickly, they tell him to be strong and courageous.
[time=1919] I like that.
[time=1920] That's the way that finishes.
[time=1921] I mean, he hears it three times from God.
[time=1923] Now the people respond to him and they say, "Only be strong and courageous." Man, what a challenge for Joshua to live up to.
[time=1932] Well, they're ready to cross the Jordan and take the Promised Land.
[time=1939] Since they left Egypt, they've been on a 40-year hike to accomplish this next step.
[time=1951] And they died off, finally they're all gone, including Moses, and they can cross over the Jordan.
[time=1957] Now, I'm going to blow through some history here.
[time=1961] In Joshua, we're going to cover chapters 2 through 22 real fast.
[time=1965] But I've got to touch some of them.
[time=1966] And some of them are so meaningful to me, I've got to talk about them for a few minutes.
[time=1970] So Joshua 2 through 22, securing the land that God promised.
[time=1975] Now they just have to do what he tells them to do.
[time=1977] He'll do the securing of the land through them.
[time=1981] Because they're obedient and they're strong and courageous, they'll prosper.
[time=1988] Remember the story of Rahab?
[time=1989] They send a couple spies over and Rahab hides them and they find out all about Jericho.
[time=1993] They come back to Tel Aviv News and then they get ready to cross the Jordan to go attack Jericho.
[time=1997] Now remember this?
[time=1998] They get up to the Jordan River and the priests carrying the Ark.
[time=2002] The priests are carrying the Ark of the Covenant and they get to the Jordan and the Jordan is full of water and you can't walk through it.
[time=2010] But when they touch their toes to the Jordan River, it says the water piled up upstream.
[time=2017] I love that.
[time=2019] The water piled like it did when they crossed the Red Sea.
[time=2022] He parted that.
[time=2023] But this is a little different because it's not just water parting like this.
[time=2027] Here we have a river stopped flowing, well it didn't stop flowing, it piled up upstream.
[time=2037] And all of the nation crossed the Jordan.
[time=2042] When they got to the other side, God said, "Take twelve stones out of the dry riverbed of the Jordan and pile them up over here, one for each tribe of Israel." And then you can bring your children back here and say, "This is the altar.
[time=2056] This is the memorial that we put together to remember that God piled the water up upstream in the Jordan so we could walk across it." Psalm 78, making sure you pass on to the next generation, the worthy deeds of the Lord.
[time=2071] You've got to remember to tell them, I have to tell my kids, I was thinking this week about the Sunday school teachers that told me, they told me week after week after week these stories.
[time=2082] When I read through these stories, I've got these images of the flannel graphs.
[time=2086] I can still see it.
[time=2088] Only four people could laugh, that's really, I'm getting old.
[time=2094] We've got Rahab, then we have Cross in the Jordan, then we have the Lord exalting Joshua.
[time=2100] We probably ought to look at that, chapter 4, verse 14, says, "That day the Lord exalted
[time=2107] Joshua in the sight of all Israel," Joshua, 4, 14, "and they revered him all the days
[time=2113] of his life just as they had revered Moses.
[time=2117] God had chosen to place this mantle of leadership on Joshua." He did it through Eleazar, the priest, and Moses laid hands on him, and they passed on
[time=2128] the leadership to Joshua, and the people revered him.
[time=2133] The Lord exalted Joshua that day, and then the march around Jericho and blow some horns
[time=2148] and the walls come tumbling down.
[time=2151] That should have been pretty good evidence that they weren't going to just do it based on their own strength.
[time=2157] I don't think any trumpet blast would bring it down.
[time=2162] They still stumble around.
[time=2165] So they take Jericho, and then remember they're going to go take AI, but Aiken sends, and Aiken takes some things that he wasn't supposed to take to his home.
[time=2173] They were supposed to leave all the plunder, they weren't supposed to take any plunder, but Aiken takes some plunder, okay, and God holds Aiken accountable.
[time=2186] They find out that Aiken finally admits to Joshua what's happened because they're going
[time=2192] to fail unless they get the sin out of the camp.
[time=2197] And Aiken and his wife and children and all of his family and his servants and his cows
[time=2204] and his goats and his donkeys and all of his stuff gets piled up and killed.
[time=2215] God's ways aren't our ways.
[time=2216] That doesn't make sense to me.
[time=2218] I don't like the fact that those other people suffer the consequences of being led by God's ways don't always make sense to me, and sometimes they're so extreme I can't even believe it.
[time=2228] The donkeys, the children, what's that about?
[time=2237] It's about God saying, this is what you deserve.
[time=2242] You see, that's what I deserve.
[time=2246] That's exactly what I deserve, but he's chosen to redeem me and forgive me.
[time=2255] That's just what they deserved, then they destroy A.I.
[time=2262] And then Joshua gathers the people together at Mount Ebal to renew the covenant with God.
[time=2271] Now I skipped a part before they went into Jericho, they got together and they circumcised everybody again.
[time=2280] They hadn't been circumcised since they left Egypt, so all these people that had grown up for these 40 years, these men hadn't been circumcised.
[time=2289] God had ordained that his people would be circumcised to set them apart from everybody else on the planet.
[time=2295] I've never seen anybody in any nation stand in line and say, let's get circumcised to be different.
[time=2301] There's some piercing happening here and there, but I don't know about any circumstances going on.
[time=2307] It's not a popular thing.
[time=2311] And he got the people together and at Mount Ebal, no gilgal, he circumcised all the males
[time=2317] that needed to be circumcised with a flint to set them apart again.
[time=2326] So now they're set apart through circumcision again and later now at Mount Ebal, they get
[time=2334] together to renew their covenant and there at Mount Ebal, Joshua reads the book of the law, all of it and all the men and women and children stand and listen in all of the book
[time=2346] of the law, not Joshua, the book.
[time=2352] Then there's the Gibbianite deception, remember all that stuff, that's real interesting, read it something.
[time=2356] It's a great story, you need to read it.
[time=2359] He calls it the sun to stand still, Joshua asks God to have the sun stand still and he does.
[time=2364] And there's some scientific evidence for that.
[time=2369] There was a period of time, sometime in the past, there's some scientific, I forget now where it is, I should have looked that up.
[time=2376] The sun stands still and then the southern cities are all conquered in the southern part
[time=2382] of the Canaan and then the northern cities are all conquered and then the land gets distributed.
[time=2391] You got Joshua leading the people, they conquer nation after nation after nation after nation
[time=2399] and possess the land that God gave to Abraham and told Abraham, I'm going to give that your
[time=2406] seed is going to be there, they're there today.
[time=2411] Some of those people over there are true Israel, they're there today.
[time=2423] Well then Joshua in chapter 23 and 24 gives a great farewell message to his people.
[time=2438] Before we really start on that, I want you to think about your own commitment in the past,
[time=2452] kind of evaluate how you've been doing regarding being strong and courageous in the arena that
[time=2460] he has described for Joshua to be strong and courageous.
[time=2464] Have you been strong and courageous, willing to lead the people that God's called you to lead?
[time=2469] Have you been willing to be the leader that he calls you to be?
[time=2476] Have you been willing to be obedient in the times when it's hard to be obedient to the
[time=2483] word?
[time=2486] Have you moved through the terrifying times hanging on to him, assured by him?
[time=2494] Have you moved through the discouraging times in a relationship with him that moves you through it?
[time=2500] Evaluate yourself for a minute and then we're going to read here about what Joshua said
[time=2506] to his people after he'd been told to live like that and he's trying to pass on to the
[time=2512] people what God had given to them, to him.
[time=2517] Chapter 23 and verses 1 through 5 he says remember, remember.
[time=2525] He says remember what God's done and remember what God has given.
[time=2534] After a long time had passed and the Lord had given Israel rest from all their enemies around them, Joshua, by then old and well advanced in years, summoned all Israel.
[time=2544] Their elders, leaders, judges and officials and said to them I am old and well advanced in years.
[time=2549] God had revealed that to him.
[time=2552] You yourselves have seen everything the Lord your God has done to all these nations for your sake.
[time=2557] It was the Lord your God who fought for you.
[time=2561] Same thing he knew before they did the fighting, he knew after they did the fighting.
[time=2566] And he and Caleb came back from spying out the land with the other ten that said they're big.
[time=2573] Remember he said he's bigger, he's bigger, they're stronger, he's more powerful.
[time=2586] He says it again.
[time=2591] You've seen everything the Lord God has done.
[time=2594] Remember how I have allotted as an inheritance for your tribes and all the land of the nations that remain, the nations I conquered between the Jordan and the great sea in the west.
[time=2604] The Lord your God gave himself, God himself will drive them out of your way.
[time=2608] He will push them out before you and you will take possession of their land as the Lord your God promised you and he did.
[time=2615] Then he says be very strong, be careful to obey all that is written.
[time=2619] So he says first of all remember now he says be very strong again.
[time=2625] He says be very strong.
[time=2628] Now this time it's Joshua passing on to his people what God had told him.
[time=2634] Be very strong and courageous to hang on to the words that I've revealed to you.
[time=2643] Be obedient to those words holding fast to the Lord he says.
[time=2652] How you doing when you're moving through your week how often do you refer back to the principles
[time=2661] that you've learned in the Bible in making your decisions.
[time=2667] How you doing it being very strong and courageous when it means you have to stand alone at work and say no to this or yes to that.
[time=2677] Do you know it well enough to be able to recall what you've learned?
[time=2683] He says to those people be very strong and courageous be obedient to the law holding fast to him.
[time=2690] You know I say to everybody at school all the time we're only Christian.
[time=2695] We're only Christian to the extent that we are so attached to him.
[time=2700] We're in relationship with him that is wholehearted and constant.
[time=2709] We don't move in and out of our Christianity.
[time=2712] Well I think I'll use the Bible on this one.
[time=2716] We're Christian to the extent that we obey what he says and we're attached to him in
[time=2722] relationship and that relationship will cause us to long for the words that are in here
[time=2728] and we'll want to apply those words in our choice making throughout the week.
[time=2735] First John says it, if you want to know if you're a Christian, if you want to know if you're walking in the light he says it's real easy.
[time=2742] You'll walk as Jesus did.
[time=2747] Attached to the Father in relationship with him.
[time=2755] So he says be very strong, obey the law.
[time=2758] Then he says remember again.
[time=2760] Remember be very strong, remember verses 9 and 10.
[time=2763] Remember the Lord has driven them out.
[time=2765] He keeps coming back.
[time=2766] He helps them remember.
[time=2767] It's the Lord who does it.
[time=2768] The Lord has driven out before you great and powerful nations.
[time=2772] To this day no one has been able to withstand you.
[time=2779] Remember be very strong.
[time=2781] Remember it's the Lord.
[time=2783] Remember it's the Lord who does it.
[time=2786] Verse 11, be very careful.
[time=2792] Be very careful to what?
[time=2794] Verse 11 says, so be very careful to love the Lord your God.
[time=2803] Remember what he's done and what he's given, how you've prospered.
[time=2808] Be strong, be obedient.
[time=2811] Remember that the Lord has driven them out and be very careful to love him.
[time=2820] To love him.
[time=2821] How do you express your love to God?
[time=2828] I notice once sometimes I'm in the shower and I think good grief.
[time=2831] I haven't even said anything to God yet today.
[time=2835] I'm already in the shower.
[time=2836] I mean I've been up for a while and it just kind of strikes me.
[time=2840] I had him on a shelf somewhere this morning.
[time=2847] How do you remember to love him?
[time=2850] Tell him you love him.
[time=2852] When you're driving down the street, say to him, I love you Lord.
[time=2857] We sing the songs a lot of times.
[time=2859] When you're alone do you tell him that you love him?
[time=2864] Be careful to love him, Joshua said.
[time=2870] Remember what he's done.
[time=2873] Be very strong and obedient to what he's told you to do.
[time=2878] Remember again that it's him.
[time=2880] He has been the one who took the land for us.
[time=2884] Now be very careful to love him back.
[time=2886] I'd say this.
[time=2887] I think your greatest act of worship, I believe this.
[time=2891] I believe your greatest acts of worship come when you're alone and you make choices to stop the thought processes that take you where you shouldn't go.
[time=2901] I believe that is more worship than any other thing that I do when I choose him.
[time=2911] And then he says, "Warning, warning."
[time=2919] America verses 12 and 13.
[time=2921] But if you turn away and ally yourselves with the survivors of these nations that remain
[time=2927] among you and if you intermarry with them and associate with them, who are they?
[time=2943] Are we intermarrying with them today?
[time=2951] We need to associate with the world because Paul said so.
[time=2955] But this is fellowship we're talking about here.
[time=2958] You can associate with the world.
[time=2960] You can have a relationship with them that's got one purpose in mind, them coming to Christ.
[time=2971] But the rest of the time, we need to make sure that our fellowship, that we're not sacrificing what we gain through fellowship with believers as we get empowered collectively to do that
[time=2982] very thing I was just talking about.
[time=2984] But he warns them, "Don't you intermarry with those people?"
[time=2992] Warning.
[time=2994] Look at verse 13, "Then you may be sure that the Lord your God will no longer drive out
[time=3003] these nations before you.
[time=3004] Instead, they will become snares and traps for you, whips on your backs and thorns in your eyes until you perish from this good land which the Lord your God has given you." I want to tell you something.
[time=3013] I believe the snares and traps are more dangerous for you today than they were even for those
[time=3020] people.
[time=3023] What our world offers us is more enticing than what they were offered.
[time=3034] And it takes a real man and woman of God to avoid those snares and traps.
[time=3041] The warning is as relevant today as it was then.
[time=3046] We are being wooed.
[time=3048] It is intentional, it is purposeful, Satan is behind it ultimately, and men in their fallen
[time=3056] condition are consistent in their appeal, in their longing to pull us into their camp
[time=3063] to do things their way.
[time=3066] It's like this, "I'll pay you more.
[time=3069] Come on and work for us.
[time=3070] Why?" Because it appears that you can make more money for me.
[time=3075] That's the reality.
[time=3081] You can have these things.
[time=3083] You can go these places.
[time=3086] You can have this free time.
[time=3088] You can collect shells for the rest of your life at your spot that you can purchase and
[time=3094] live there forever and quit working in the kingdom because you quit working completely.
[time=3102] And I'm Piper, hasn't one of his messages, so there are going to be a lot of folks at the Bema Seat judgment when Christ says, "What do you have to bring me?
[time=3108] What have you been doing while in the flesh down there?" And they're going to offer a beautiful seashell collection.
[time=3117] You can collect seashells.
[time=3119] It's all right.
[time=3120] Do it as a restful activity.
[time=3122] Don't make a career out of it.
[time=3125] Work in the kingdom, the rest of your life, until Moses died, until Joshua died, until Joseph
[time=3132] died, until Isaac died, until Abraham died, until Jesus died, until John and Peter and
[time=3138] Paul died.
[time=3140] They did the kingdom.
[time=3142] "Warning, they'll suck you in." He says, "They'll want you to come into their camp.
[time=3149] Do things their way.
[time=3150] You know why?
[time=3151] For their sake.
[time=3152] Not yours." Then he says, "Remember again, verse 14.
[time=3162] Now I'm about to go the way of all the earth, dead, because I'm about ready to die.
[time=3170] You know with all your heart and soul that not one of all the good promises the Lord your God gave you has failed, he's never failed.
[time=3182] Every promise has been fulfilled.
[time=3184] Not one has failed.
[time=3186] He's faithful." Remember that.
[time=3192] He is faithful.
[time=3193] You know what?
[time=3194] I'm not.
[time=3196] You aren't.
[time=3198] You can't fully trust me.
[time=3200] I can't fully trust you.
[time=3202] I can fully trust him.
[time=3204] He's always faithful.
[time=3206] The only faith I have is an expression of his faithfulness when I'm yielded to him and
[time=3212] he does it through me.
[time=3214] The rest of the time, I'm not.
[time=3220] He's faithful.
[time=3223] He keeps his promises.
[time=3225] You can trust him.
[time=3228] I earn your trust over a period of time and I can lose it like that and then I can regain some of it over a period of time.
[time=3234] But you know what?
[time=3235] He is trustworthy, always was, is and always will be.
[time=3243] And Josh was just saying, "Don't forget, he is the one you can trust.
[time=3248] He's faithful." Now, warning number two, I won't yell at just warning.
[time=3256] Here's another warning.
[time=3258] You have to get quiet.
[time=3260] Sometimes that wakes up the people who aren't awake when you yell.
[time=3265] Warning, verse 15 and 16, "But just as every good promise of the Lord your God has come true so the Lord will bring on you all the evil he has threatened until he has destroyed you from this good land he has given you.
[time=3277] If you violate the covenant of the Lord your God which he commanded you and go and serve other gods and bow down to them, the Lord's anger will burn against you and you will quickly perish from the good land he has given you."
[time=3295] Remember what he's done, be very strong, be obedient when it might be terrifying, when
[time=3302] it might be discouraging, be obedient.
[time=3306] Remember the Lord drove him out, you didn't.
[time=3310] Be very careful to love him.
[time=3313] They're trying to suck you in, and they'll keep on doing it for the rest of your life.
[time=3321] Remember he's faithful.
[time=3326] Warning, this is what I'll do to you if you don't do what I told you to do.
[time=3332] That's what he said to those people, "My anger will burn against you.
[time=3337] It burnt against Aiken and his family.
[time=3340] Because wrath and his anger are not something that we want to reckon with."
[time=3348] In chapter 24 then we renew the covenant and Joshua after his farewell address dies.
[time=3364] In verse 29, "After these things Joshua, son of none, servant of the Lord, not Moses
[time=3375] aid, not servant of man, servant of the Lord, died at the age of 110 and they buried him."
[time=3391] Are you strong and courageous?
[time=3393] You stand alone when it's necessary?
[time=3397] Are you strong and very courageous, willing to obey when it's terrifying and discouraging?
[time=3405] Are you strong and courageous when the circumstances seem wrong?
[time=3411] Do you still obey the word?
[time=3417] Dads and moms and kids, friends and neighbors and coworkers.
[time=3422] You have daily opportunities to express the reality of your attachment to the living God
[time=3431] by being strong and courageous in leadership roles or follower roles, in obedience to the
[time=3442] truths that he's taught us, in really believing in your heart that he's the faithful one.
[time=3452] And even when it's terrifying and discouraging.
[time=3458] The good news is he will see us through it all.
[time=3467] And by his grace, that very law that they couldn't keep and I couldn't keep, he fulfilled
[time=3476] through the blood of Christ and now empowered by his spirit, I am empowered to do things
[time=3483] they couldn't even do.
[time=3487] And so are you.
[time=3490] Now be strong and courageous.
[time=3496] Lord help us.
[time=3498] Oh what a great truth, you're faithful.
[time=3503] You've been so faithful as to provide us with a way out.
[time=3509] You've redeemed us, you've called us by name, we're yours.
[time=3512] Now please Lord empower us by your spirit to be the strong and courageous people that
[time=3518] we need to be.
[time=3521] And again I thank you for your faithfulness, I thank you for the redemption of the blood of Christ, how I am forgiven and I pray that our weak would be a love offering to you as
[time=3531] we remember and love you.
[time=3534] In Jesus name I pray, Amen God bless you.
