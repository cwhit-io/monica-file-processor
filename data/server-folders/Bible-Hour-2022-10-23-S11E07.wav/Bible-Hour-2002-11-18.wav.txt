[time=281] [NON-ENGLISH SINGING] [NON-ENGLISH SINGING] [NON-ENGLISH SINGING] [NON-ENGLISH SINGING] [NON-ENGLISH SINGING] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Blackhawk.
[time=291] And I wanted to just take a few minutes and remind you of something that we've been making available to you all for the last couple of months.
[time=300] And from what we hear, it's something that's encouraging and challenging you as you continue in your spiritual journey.
[time=308] It's our small group curriculum sheet that is a product of our Sunday morning message.
[time=313] Our small group pastor, Bob Purdy, came up with this ingenious idea of taking the Sunday morning message and developing from that a series of small group interactive dialogue type questions.
[time=327] You can get that list of questions at our website, blackhawkministries.org.
[time=332] And you can download those questions and then use those questions to further your discussion and your thought and your consideration of the truths that you hear right here in the Bible hour.
[time=344] Those questions are just a continuation of the message that you see each week here.
[time=349] You could use those questions just on your own as you spend time with the Lord and just try to further your own walk with Him.
[time=355] You could take those questions and sit down with them and your accountability partner.
[time=360] You could take the questions and make them the curriculum, if you will, for your small group, whoever that group might be, whenever you meet.
[time=367] We just hope that you'll do that.
[time=369] Download the questions, keep visiting the site each week, and keep tuning in here in the Bible hour.
[time=374] The message that you hear, we hope, challenges you.
[time=377] The questions that you can get, we believe will further your own insight and your own understanding of the truths that we're doing our best to explain.
[time=386] I also want to let you know this.
[time=388] We would love to.
[time=389] We're going to keep inviting you to come.
[time=390] Many of you have taken us up on it, and we've got a great series starting on Sunday morning, December 8th.
[time=397] We've entitled the series questions about heaven, and I don't know about you, but to be perfectly honest with you, though I believe in its reality.
[time=406] And though I know in my heart that God has gone to prepare a place for us, sometimes when I think about heaven, sometimes when I think about what comes after this life, I get a little bit confused.
[time=419] And it's just an encouraging thing for you and for me to kind of go to the scriptures again and again and learn and see what the truth says, what God's word says, about this place called heaven.
[time=431] And so on the 8th of December, the 15th of December, and then the 22nd of December.
[time=437] It's a three week series on heaven.
[time=439] We would love to have you come and join us.
[time=441] The 22nd, right there next to Christmas, we're going to use that Sunday to talk about how the Christ child came.
[time=447] The baby was born really with heaven in mind.
[time=450] Heaven for you and for me.
[time=452] And so we want you to join us.
[time=454] Come and be a part of that.
[time=455] We hope to see you soon.
[time=461] [AMEN - 19 seconds]
[time=481] Father, this morning we want to give you our minds and our hearts.
[time=484] We want to give you our will and ask that you'd conform it to yours and that you'd make a servant of the most high.
[time=490] In Jesus' name.
[time=492] [AMEN - 48 seconds]
[time=548] [MUSIC - 256 seconds]
[time=807] (audience applauds) - Hey, good morning.
[time=811] The title of that song was "Go forth." And I just want you to know how thankful I am and how excited we've been for this weekend because we've had the privilege, the absolute privilege of being able to be with some people.
[time=826] From our family, we consider them family members, some folks who have gone forth and they are giving of themselves and their time and their talent and their treasure and their energies and their passion.
[time=836] And they are doing everything they can to be God's people, to be God's messengers in a number of different places.
[time=843] And what I want to do this morning is we want to identify these folks.
[time=847] It has been our joy to this weekend, kind of dedicate this weekend last night and today to celebrating our global ministries, our global missions, people that we consider our own who are serving God in places far, far away and right here in our own backyard.
[time=866] And we don't get the chance to do this very often.
[time=869] So please, I'm going to read off some names.
[time=872] I'm going to ask these folks if they would to stand, wherever they might be sitting.
[time=876] And I want to ask you just to hold your thanks until the end and then we'll do that together.
[time=880] But just thank God for these people and thank him for the work that they're doing on our Lord's behalf in a number of different places.
[time=888] Here we go, just listen.
[time=889] Mike and Carolyn Ballast, serving in the Philippines, Stephen Maria Gardner, right here now in our own United States, serving with Crown Ministries, David Humphreys from the Fort Wayne Rescue Mission, Chad and Kim DeKines, serving the Lord in France, Carol Bigabhouse, Fran Mortensen, Fran and Phil from the Love Church, Judy Hapke from the Hope Center, Dick and Barb Kelly, Slavic Gospel, serving God here in the States and oftentimes over in Russia.
[time=917] Jim and Sue Seerstad with China Outreach Ministries, serving at Purdue University, Gary Roland with pioneers in Orlando, Florida.
[time=927] That's tough call there, Gary, but glad you're doing it.
[time=929] (audience laughs) Brian Schmucker, Brian from Youth for Christ and at Southern Wells, Kent Zessler from Intervarsity here in Fort Wayne, our own Denny and Deb Howard with Youth for Christ at Family Care and Mark and Jen Rhodes with Youth for Christ.
[time=945] And that's the list that I have.
[time=947] And if you all would just stay standing and would you, the Black Hawk family, please, just from your heart, thank these people for all that they're doing and giving.
[time=956] (audience applauds) Thank you, you can be seated.
[time=966] There's a great opportunity for you today.
[time=970] Take the kids, take a few extra minutes and when we're done here, please go out to the foyer.
[time=975] There's some booths set up and I promise you no one's gonna grab you and take you back to Ghana.
[time=981] You're not gonna, it's just friendly people who would love to get to know you and you can learn more about their ministry.
[time=988] You can learn more about how you could be a part of that ministry.
[time=991] And we'd love for you just to, as the Black Hawk family, make sure that you take just a few minutes and if nothing else go by and please extend your thanks for all that they're doing and giving to the cause.
[time=1002] All right?
[time=1003] Question for you this morning.
[time=1008] Is that a cell phone?
[time=1011] (audience laughs) We have a rule around here you know that if a cell phone rings in a meeting, you buy us all pizzas.
[time=1016] (audience laughs) Any orders?
[time=1021] (audience laughs) Hey, question for you this morning.
[time=1024] What is it that God's calling you to?
[time=1027] What do you think about it?
[time=1030] What is it that God is calling you to?
[time=1033] Where is it that God is nudging you?
[time=1037] You know, the spirit of God and the person of God and maybe even working through the people of God, what is it that he's lately?
[time=1045] Really been encouraging you toward, kind of moving you toward, what is it?
[time=1052] Where is it?
[time=1053] Maybe it's a place that he's calling you to, you know what it might even be a conversation that he's trying to get you to have with somebody and you know you need to have it and he's trying to move you in that direction.
[time=1065] It might be a ministry that he needs you to get involved in.
[time=1069] What's he calling you to?
[time=1074] What's God been nudging you toward?
[time=1076] Think about that, we'll come back to it.
[time=1078] You know what?
[time=1082] I'm gonna just say this to you again, I've said this to you before, but things keep happening in my life that just remind me of it all over again.
[time=1088] I absolutely love Indiana, that's really true.
[time=1093] And I know, listen, and I love Indiana 'cause watch this, I love Indiana so much 'cause I got buddies right back in Southern California where we were from and that used to be home and now I call this home, but they call me, they used to call me all the time and they'd always give me grief about Fort Wayne, Indiana, the thriving metropolis of Fort Wayne, Indiana, you know, and they're back there in the big city.
[time=1117] And I love Indiana and you know what?
[time=1119] I love Fort Wayne even more now because I can call them back now.
[time=1122] They got absolutely, by and large, nothing on me.
[time=1124] I call 'em, I say, hey, you know what, guys?
[time=1126] We've got stadium seating now, theaters with like real stadium seating theaters.
[time=1132] It's got DTS THX sound, you got nothing on me.
[time=1136] We got two malls in town, you know, what else could you want?
[time=1140] We got a Starbucks, that was a big thing.
[time=1142] When we got a Starbucks, it took me right up the ladder.
[time=1144] We got a Starbucks now, I tell 'em.
[time=1146] And then I shut 'em up recently by telling 'em we've even got a cheesecake factory.
[time=1150] Well, it's an indie, but it's like an hour and a half drive.
[time=1154] It's no big deal.
[time=1155] They drive an hour and a half to place this to eat all the time back there.
[time=1159] So it's like no big deal, we're in, you know?
[time=1161] It's like I love Fort Wayne.
[time=1163] I love this place.
[time=1168] I love you.
[time=1169] I love what I get to do every day of my life.
[time=1171] I love this state, I love this city, I love this place.
[time=1174] I love these people.
[time=1175] I love my life that God's given me.
[time=1177] I love the opportunity every day that Deborah and I have to get up and face, the opportunities He's given us with our kids and ministry.
[time=1184] I absolutely love it, so much so.
[time=1188] And I get so, I get so given to and I get so committed to and I get so focused on this.
[time=1194] You know, you ever do that in your life?
[time=1195] It's just, you know, on this right here that sometimes I need a reminder to kind of step back and broaden the scope a little bit.
[time=1205] I need what I call an Acts 1-8 reminder.
[time=1209] And maybe you do too every once in a while.
[time=1212] And if you do this morning, then be reminded of what it says in that great passage.
[time=1216] Jesus said to this small band of really scared, unsure, not quite able to figure out how all this was gonna unfold.
[time=1226] There's this group of people up in this upper room who says, you know what?
[time=1229] You shall receive power.
[time=1230] He's telling them about when the church is gonna unfold, when the gospel's gonna grow.
[time=1234] He's foretelling the activity of the book of Acts, which is just continuing on today.
[time=1240] You know, with you and with me.
[time=1242] And he said to them, just be reminded today.
[time=1245] You shall receive power.
[time=1247] When the Holy Spirit has come upon you and you shall be my witnesses, he says to them.
[time=1253] And he says to you.
[time=1255] And he says to me, you shall be my witnesses.
[time=1260] Where? Well, he starts in Jerusalem, which is where I sometimes get so focused.
[time=1268] But it doesn't stop there.
[time=1270] He says, you'll be my witnesses.
[time=1271] They were in Jerusalem.
[time=1272] And he referred to the place they were at, but he goes on beyond.
[time=1275] And he says, and in all of Judea, the next concentric circle out, you know?
[time=1280] It's like in Jerusalem and in Judea and in Samaria and even to the remotest part of the earth.
[time=1290] And see, I just admit to you this morning that I sometimes get really narrow-minded and I get really focused on here.
[time=1300] And I sometimes forget that in Matthew 20, 20, 80s, they'd go into all the what?
[time=1305] World, go into all the world, making disciples, baptizing them.
[time=1312] That's why we've dedicated this whole weekend to global ministries, catching a global vision, being a people here in this place who understand what it means to have a heart, to have eyes and to have a sense of who God is and how he works and where he works beyond our own sphere and how maybe to some degree we can, you can and I can be an active part of that.
[time=1338] Then I hope this morning you'd open your heart.
[time=1344] Maybe God wants to remind you of some things.
[time=1347] Maybe God wants to point you in a new direction.
[time=1350] Maybe he's got something for you that you need to consider as you listen to and try and better understand where God's calling you, what he's calling you to do.
[time=1362] Now, in all fairness, that might be, that might be and don't be afraid of it and don't run from it.
[time=1369] That might be in global missions.
[time=1371] He may have a call for you that someday takes you far, far away from here.
[time=1377] He may have a people that he wants you to love.
[time=1382] He may have something in store for you that will challenge and stretch you and allow you to see God's hand at work, thousands and thousands and thousands of miles away from here.
[time=1392] What's he calling you to?
[time=1395] You know what, he might be just calling you to greater involvement here.
[time=1401] For you, it might be the remotest parts of the earth.
[time=1404] For others, it might be Jerusalem.
[time=1406] It might be right here in your own backyard.
[time=1409] Greater levels of involvement.
[time=1412] A greater willingness on your part to roll up your sleeves and be a part of the greatest cause of all.
[time=1417] He might be calling you to a new job.
[time=1421] He may be calling you this morning to a new vocation.
[time=1424] What's he calling you to?
[time=1427] What's he nudging you toward?
[time=1430] For some, it might be the spirit's nudge to have you invest God-given resources back into the kingdom in radical, life-changing ways.
[time=1439] And let me just say this.
[time=1440] There might be somebody here this morning and the call of God on your life may have nothing to do with global ministries.
[time=1451] For really even ministry here, per se, he may be with some here this morning.
[time=1456] He may be calling you to himself for the very first time.
[time=1461] And we just want you this morning wherever you are on that spectrum.
[time=1466] To be open and to consider again today what God's calling you to do, where God's calling you to go.
[time=1473] There was a guy in the Old Testament who God called.
[time=1476] There was a man in the Old Testament that God called to go and proclaim his truth to a people and his name was, and you can write it down, Jonah.
[time=1484] His name was Jonah.
[time=1485] Jonah was a prophet.
[time=1486] What is a prophet?
[time=1487] A prophet is one who had been given a special message from God.
[time=1491] That's right.
[time=1492] A prophet is one who had been given a special message from God.
[time=1495] Those were in those days specific messages that God wanted delivered to a specific people for a specific cause.
[time=1504] And God had a message that he wanted to give Jonah.
[time=1507] And God had a people that God wanted Jonah to take that message to.
[time=1510] And you can see the message and the messenger and the intended audience right there at the beginning of the book of Jonah.
[time=1518] Turn there if you would to chapter one, right after the book of Obadiah, right before you get to Micah, you find the story of this reluctant prophet named Jonah.
[time=1529] Jonah chapter one, verses one and two, the message, the messenger and the audience all packed in right there.
[time=1536] Here you go.
[time=1537] The word of the Lord it says came to Jonah.
[time=1539] The word of the Lord came to Jonah, the son of Amatized, saying, arise.
[time=1544] He says to Jonah, arise.
[time=1547] Go to Nineveh, the great city and cry against it for their wickedness has come up before me.
[time=1553] For their wickedness has come up before me.
[time=1557] There is this great city, a few days journey away called Nineveh.
[time=1561] And God comes to his guy, his designated guy and he says, Jonah, I want you to go.
[time=1567] They're evil, they're wickedness has come up against me.
[time=1570] I'm gonna deal with them severely.
[time=1573] If something doesn't change and so he calls to Jonah, he says, Jonah, go.
[time=1578] And Jonah says, I don't think so.
[time=1583] I don't wanna go.
[time=1584] Jonah's heart was cold toward God's call.
[time=1589] Jonah's heart was cold.
[time=1591] We see later in the book toward those people.
[time=1593] Jonah listens to God, he hears God clearly.
[time=1596] The nudge comes, the direction set and Jonah in essence, the only prophet was conversing with Bob Purdy here this week and Bob mentioned to me, and it's true, the only prophet mentioned that basically rejects the call of God.
[time=1610] At first, he just says no.
[time=1612] And then he does this really, really weird, strange, like odd thing.
[time=1617] Well, strange and odd as we look at it, but good night, you know what?
[time=1622] You and I do the same thing all the time.
[time=1625] He tries to what, from God?
[time=1628] Say it.
[time=1631] He tries to hide, tries to run, tries to hide.
[time=1634] He tries to get away from the searching light of God's eye.
[time=1639] Goes down to the ship that's heading down to Tarsus and he gets on this ship and even goes down into the ship, it says like, oh, now he's really gonna be, you know, like hiding from God 'cause he's down inside the ship and he figures he can just kind of run away from God's call.
[time=1655] Well, as the story unfolds, we realize and we'll look back at this in a moment here.
[time=1658] As the story unfolds, you know, it all comes to bear.
[time=1662] God knows exactly what's going on.
[time=1664] He brings this incredible storm that says, the seasoned veterans, the sailors on the ship, who would have been very familiar with stormy seas, they were even scared and this incredible storm comes.
[time=1675] And the guys on the ship are trying to offload stuff to somehow survive and through a series of events, they realize, they find Jonah, they say what's going on.
[time=1684] It's evident that he had had some kind of conversation with them in the past and they know he was running from his God and they had prayed to their gods for relief, nothing happened.
[time=1692] And they said, you're the guy, what should we do?
[time=1694] And he says, throw me overboard.
[time=1696] Throw me into the sea.
[time=1697] Jonah knew what was going on.
[time=1701] And so they reluctantly, after asking God not to hold this man's life against them, they pick him up, they throw him into the sea and the waves come.
[time=1710] Storm goes away.
[time=1711] The text even indicates that that had an impact spiritually on these guys that had thrown Jonah overboard and he sinks to the bottom and God brings the big fish.
[time=1722] Somebody said to me, this week when I told them that we would be discussing this, they said, now that's kind of like for you, right?
[time=1728] That's where the story kind of just stops being real and gets kind of allegorical or just, it's kind of like just a tradition, right?
[time=1735] You don't like really believe that a big fish swallowed this guy.
[time=1739] And I said, absolutely.
[time=1741] That's what it says.
[time=1745] I believe it absolutely.
[time=1746] I believe God sent a very big fish to swallow this guy.
[time=1751] And I believe this guy, Jonah, trying to run from God ends up in the belly of a whale or a big fish, whatever it actually was, but I believe it's true.
[time=1763] And it's in that stomach of this fish,
[time=1769] the bottom of the sea that he prays an amazing prayer.
[time=1773] And I want you to see it.
[time=1774] I want you to go ahead and just look at Jonah too, just look at this with me.
[time=1777] And the reason I'm gonna stop here and kind of bring it to the text is, you know, I don't know all of you.
[time=1784] I know some of you.
[time=1785] And I know that there are people here, ones I know and ones I don't know.
[time=1790] And life right now feels to you like you're in the gut of a fish at the bottom of the ocean.
[time=1797] And you just don't quite know, you know, which way's up.
[time=1801] You've made some bad decisions.
[time=1802] You've gotten tossed overboard.
[time=1804] And there's this time, there's this place where God allows us to kind of do business with him and look at what this guy does.
[time=1812] Listen to how he responds.
[time=1814] And he said, I called out of my distress to the Lord, chapter two, verse, verse two.
[time=1818] And he answered me, I cried for help.
[time=1821] See, he humbled himself.
[time=1822] You in trouble?
[time=1824] Don't forget the first step, typically, is to admit you're in trouble and to humble yourself before God and to ask for help.
[time=1832] And he answered me, I cried for help from the depth of Sheol, thou didst hear my voice, for thou hadst cast me into the deep, into the heart of the sea and the current engulfed me.
[time=1842] All the breakers and billows passed over me.
[time=1844] So I said, I have been expelled from my sight.
[time=1846] Nevertheless, I will look again toward thy holy temple.
[time=1850] You ever feel that, ever feel that tension of having to look again toward him, having to come to him in broken humility?
[time=1859] Again, you ever experienced that?
[time=1864] The frustration and the kind of that defeated sense of having to come to him again and again and again.
[time=1872] But nevertheless, Jonah says, I will look again toward thy holy temple.
[time=1878] Some of you need to do that this morning.
[time=1880] Water encompassed me to the point of death.
[time=1882] The great deep engulfed me.
[time=1884] I descended to the roots of the mountains.
[time=1885] The earth with its bars was around me forever, but thou has brought up my life from the pit.
[time=1890] Oh Lord, my God.
[time=1891] While I was feigning away, I remembered the Lord.
[time=1894] And my prayer came to you into your holy temple.
[time=1898] Those who regard main idols for stake their faithfulness.
[time=1900] But I will sacrifice to thee with a voice of thanksgiving, that which I have vowed I will pay.
[time=1906] Salvation, Jonah said, when it was all said and done, is from the Lord.
[time=1911] Three days and three nights he spins in the belly of the fish.
[time=1916] God hears his prayer, God senses his repentant heart, causes the fish to burp, spit, vomit, whatever word you want to use.
[time=1925] He tosses him out right onto the shore.
[time=1929] And now all of a sudden, we've got somebody who is ready to proclaim.
[time=1936] Now all of a sudden, having gone through all he went through.
[time=1939] If you can, over on the idea of hiding from God, the thought that comes to my mind, when I think of hiding from God, is I think of a little kid playing hide and go seek.
[time=1951] And if there's a picture I'd want you just to walk away with today, it would be this one of a kid who thinks he's hiding.
[time=1958] If you ever see that happen, we play hide and go seek.
[time=1962] And sure enough, there's one of the kids, usually the younger one, right?
[time=1965] Right smack dab in the middle of the hallway, with a blanket over them or a hat pulled down.
[time=1971] And they think they're like, you know, they think they're fine.
[time=1973] And then they get so surprised, like when you find them, they're like, I think it's an amazing thing that they've actually been found.
[time=1982] And so just take that picture with you, of this whole attempt to hide.
[time=1987] He goes through the whole big fish thing and then just take this picture with you.
[time=1991] 'Cause then it was time for Jonah to do what God had called him to do.
[time=1996] To proclaim, to let a city who was in a lot of trouble, know about it.
[time=2002] So it says he walks through the streets and he proclaims the message that God called him to proclaim.
[time=2008] And he did it loudly and he did it faithfully.
[time=2010] It's an amazing thing and the people it says repented.
[time=2015] The whole city just kind of turns on its heels and they respond to this message from the prophet.
[time=2021] It's an amazing story.
[time=2023] I wanna go back through it now with you, but as we go back through it, I just wanna make sure that we don't just go through it
[time=2032] with the story in mind.
[time=2033] I want you to go back through it with you in mind.
[time=2037] I want us to see the story unfold, but I wanna ask you some questions as we go.
[time=2041] And would you please just be willing today before God, just in the quietness of your own soul?
[time=2048] Just ask these questions.
[time=2050] Be honest with the answers that come and allow God and his spirit and his word to work in you today, okay?
[time=2058] Let's go back to the beginning and let's ask that question again.
[time=2060] Number one, write it down, please.
[time=2062] What is he calling you to do?
[time=2065] What has he called you to?
[time=2067] Would you just consider that again this morning?
[time=2070] Where is he calling you to go?
[time=2071] What is he calling you to say?
[time=2074] Go back to Jonah chapter one, verse one.
[time=2076] And the word of the Lord came to, why don't you just, I mean, we're not gonna, I'm not in any way disrespecting the scriptures.
[time=2082] It says what it says, I'm just for the sake of application, asking you if you wouldn't mind putting your name in there.
[time=2088] And the word of the Lord came to you.
[time=2091] You know, are you or you or you?
[time=2093] I mean, just put your name in there.
[time=2094] And then he calls Jonah, son of Amatai, to arise and go to Nineveh.
[time=2101] What is he calling you to?
[time=2103] Think about it, just sit there.
[time=2108] Let the spirit of God remind you of what he's been nudging you toward, where he's been trying to get you to go.
[time=2114] And again, it might be a long, long way away or it might be right here, but this morning it's just your willingness to identify and sense his call.
[time=2125] Well, let me just say this to you.
[time=2128] Just to remind you of some things, okay?
[time=2130] I wanna start here.
[time=2132] We've said this before, we'll say it again, I'll say it to you every chance I get as long as I have breath.
[time=2137] There is one hope for this lost and dying world.
[time=2139] There is one hope for this lost and struggling world of ours.
[time=2144] And that hope is the church.
[time=2146] That hope is the gospel of Jesus Christ, lived out and proclaimed with creativity and passion and energy and excitement and accuracy.
[time=2157] The only hope, it's not government, it's not money, it's nothing other than the local church being the church that God's called it to be.
[time=2167] It's the only hope.
[time=2168] Here in Jerusalem and in the remotest parts of the earth, that's it.
[time=2172] That's the only thing this world can look to.
[time=2176] It's the only thing that God's gonna use is the gospel of Jesus Christ, being proclaimed and lived out and shared through the local church.
[time=2185] And there are, please, remember this morning, some of you forget this, myself as well.
[time=2191] There are thousands of places, thousands of places all over the world that don't even have one church.
[time=2200] Not five people, not 10 people, not 12 people, not 300.
[time=2205] There are places, there are thousands of places in this world and there's no church.
[time=2211] There's no group of faithful followers to be a shining light in the midst of darkness, nothing.
[time=2217] Then what is God calling you to be a part of?
[time=2223] To give yourself to.
[time=2226] What's the nudge from God saying to you as you look at this world and the things that He longs to do?
[time=2234] Thousands of places without one.
[time=2237] And to be fair, you know what?
[time=2240] There are thousands and thousands of people right here in this city of ours, struggling.
[time=2248] Struggling to try their best, you know, they're trying to make sense of life.
[time=2253] And it's not going so well.
[time=2254] And you know what?
[time=2255] Some struggle in their affluence and some struggle in their poverty.
[time=2260] And some struggle, you know, kind of in the middle of all that, it's no different.
[time=2264] They're struggling, they're empty.
[time=2267] And here's the deal.
[time=2268] And I believe this with every ounce of my being.
[time=2271] They would come.
[time=2273] They would, I've seen it.
[time=2276] They'll come.
[time=2277] They'll come into this place.
[time=2280] And they'll sit next to you in that seat.
[time=2283] And they'll hear a message of hope and forgiveness.
[time=2286] Questions will begin to get answered.
[time=2288] Direction will begin to be found.
[time=2290] Thousands of people in this community and they'll come.
[time=2293] You know what?
[time=2295] If you'd go.
[time=2298] If you would go and ask them to.
[time=2300] If you would, and if I would, and it's so exciting for us to be a part of this process, I love it.
[time=2308] I'll never do it any other way.
[time=2309] To be a part of the process.
[time=2312] Of building quality friendships.
[time=2316] Friendships based on a redemptive hope that beats in our heart for what God might have for them.
[time=2321] And are you, are you ready?
[time=2324] Are you engaged in that process of going?
[time=2327] Maybe in this case, right here, building quality friendships within which in time you can extend a quality invitation and they'll come.
[time=2336] I don't know what God's calling you to.
[time=2340] It might be far, far away.
[time=2342] It could be right here.
[time=2343] But the point of the matter is either way you and I have to go.
[time=2348] And we have to be willing to respond to the call of God.
[time=2354] Romans 10, 13.
[time=2355] Just a great reminder.
[time=2356] You can turn there if you would.
[time=2357] I don't think it'll be on the screen, but just look with me.
[time=2360] Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts.
[time=2361] Go back next book to Romans 10.
[time=2363] Romans 10.
[time=2366] It says in Romans 10, 13.
[time=2368] Just something that you and I again, another reminder verse.
[time=2372] Kind of like the Acts 1, 8 thing.
[time=2373] It says in Romans 10, 13, "For whoever will call upon the name of the Lord "will be saved." Well, that's great news.
[time=2380] "How then shall they call upon him?" So Paul says, "In whom they have not believed, "and how shall they believe in him?
[time=2387] "Whom they have not heard, "and how shall they hear without a preacher?" And we've looked at this passage before, and you and I know that that whole preacher phrased there.
[time=2397] That is not a bunch of fingers pointing at me.
[time=2400] Or Mitch, or Steve.
[time=2402] No, no, no, no, no.
[time=2404] That word in the Greek basically just flat out means communicator of truth.
[time=2411] That's just a whole bunch of fingers coming back at you now.
[time=2413] It's not up to me.
[time=2416] It is not up to me to fill this place.
[time=2419] It is up to us to be a people with a redemptive heart who have a redemptive vision of what God can and will do in the lives of people.
[time=2428] And it's your willingness in mind to go.
[time=2430] To go and to make the ask.
[time=2433] Everybody, everybody just take a minute.
[time=2437] Go ahead, just look around this room.
[time=2438] Go ahead, do this for me.
[time=2440] Look around this room and just go ahead and lock in on an empty seat.
[time=2443] Go ahead, just lock in for a second on an empty seat.
[time=2448] And as you lock in on an empty seat, would you just be willing to be reminded again today?
[time=2454] Are you looking?
[time=2455] That every empty seat you see in this place represents the potential for a life changed.
[time=2463] A family given hope.
[time=2468] A wrecked individual struggling with guilt and shame.
[time=2472] A young woman, an older man.
[time=2475] Just look at him.
[time=2476] Every one of them represents the potential.
[time=2479] And we know that in the end all of that's in God's hand, but God looks at you and me and says go.
[time=2485] Be my people.
[time=2485] To the remotest parts of the earth are right here in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=2490] Please give it some thought.
[time=2493] Number two, write this down.
[time=2496] Where are you hiding?
[time=2499] Where are you trying to hide?
[time=2503] As you hear and begin to become more familiar with this nudge of God in your life, you know you've asked enough questions, you've prayed and brought it before him, you've talked to from him, you just, you know, it begins to be clearer and clearer that he's trying to move you in this direction.
[time=2521] Again, toward the remotest parts of the earth or just toward somebody in your life where you know you need to talk to, it's a ministry involvement here that you know, it's been, enough's been said, it's just time for you to go ahead and jump in and get involved.
[time=2537] It's a ministry, you know, here in our church where you know your gifts and talents could be used.
[time=2544] I mean, it could be a wide variety of things, but you know he's nudging, you know he's calling and you're trying to do the Jonah thing.
[time=2553] You're trying to hide.
[time=2557] Jonah 1-3, just remind yourself there what it said.
[time=2561] Jonah 1-3, but Jonah, but Jonah rose up to flee to Tarsheesh from the presence of the Lord.
[time=2571] So he went down to Japa, found a ship which was going to Tarsheesh, paid the fair and went down into it to go with them to Tarsheesh from the presence of the Lord.
[time=2585] Psalm 139, one to five, comes to mind.
[time=2588] You can go there if you want to.
[time=2591] Psalm 139, one to five.
[time=2595] Let me ask you a question.
[time=2596] You don't have to answer it out loud.
[time=2597] Can you hide from the presence of the Lord?
[time=2600] Psalm 139, one, oh Lord, thou has searched me and known me, thou does know when I sit down and when I rise up, thou does understand my thought from afar.
[time=2614] You scrutinize my path and my lying down and you're intimately acquainted with all of my ways.
[time=2621] Even before there is a word on my tongue, behold, oh Lord, you know it all.
[time=2626] You've enclosed me behind and before and laid thy hand on me.
[time=2632] He says, go far away.
[time=2635] You know what, or here at home, but he says, go.
[time=2640] And what do you do?
[time=2642] It's too many times we look for the blanket.
[time=2645] We start to play hide and go seek.
[time=2647] We look for the blanket to hide under.
[time=2648] We look for the little, you know, a little cave we can slip into 'cause somehow, you know, we're gonna escape the presence of the Lord.
[time=2656] Let me try something with you here if I can.
[time=2660] Guys, go ahead, if you would.
[time=2665] And let me just ask all of you, if you would, to just allow the darkness in the room, we've got some more lights that need to go off here.
[time=2675] Go ahead and kill those two.
[time=2676] We've got some darkness in the room for you.
[time=2683] And the reason I wanted the darkness was just to illustrate what very well may be the reality of your own life.
[time=2692] We're almost there.
[time=2693] Keep going, guys, get it dark.
[time=2695] The darkness in the room this morning represents your feeble attempts.
[time=2701] Your feeble attempts in mind to hide, to say no.
[time=2705] And let me ask you again, where are you hiding?
[time=2709] What does this darkness represent in your life?
[time=2713] You can close your eyes if you need to, if you need to get it even more dark.
[time=2720] And I just want you to be honest.
[time=2722] Is this darkness your busyness?
[time=2724] Is the darkness of this room this morning your busy life?
[time=2729] You know what, there are some in this room and you just don't have time to do what he's called you to do.
[time=2735] You're just too busy.
[time=2738] You're making this, you're making that, you're going here, you're doing this.
[time=2741] And it's all just gotten out of hand.
[time=2744] And the call of God on your life to be engaged, not only in what you're doing, but also in things that have an eternal perspective and value.
[time=2752] You know what, you're just too busy.
[time=2754] Too many other things going on.
[time=2759] Maybe the darkness in the room this morning here represents your fear.
[time=2763] That's right.
[time=2764] It's a common thing, you guys.
[time=2767] Maybe the darkness just represents the fact that this thing that God's calling you to do, this place that God might be calling you to go, it just scares you.
[time=2776] Seven years ago, I know a little bit about this.
[time=2781] You know, I love it now.
[time=2784] But there was a day I wasn't so sure.
[time=2786] Seven years ago, my wife and I got on a plane at LAX with a three-month-old little girl and a three-year-old boy.
[time=2793] And I was petrified.
[time=2794] I was leaving everything I knew and loved because I felt like, you know, and I'd been feeling it for a while that God was calling me to come and be a part of a family in Fort Wayne, Indiana, with no stadium seating and no Starbucks yet.
[time=2807] Scared me to death.
[time=2815] Is it your busyness?
[time=2816] Is it your fear?
[time=2818] You know what, there's another group of you here today and I'm scared for you, I'm concerned for you because there are some who reject the call of God who go in different directions, try and hide in ships because you know why they're just flat out indifferent.
[time=2830] They just don't care.
[time=2833] You know, and that was Jonah.
[time=2836] I mean, he in essence said, you know, let the city of Nineveh parish, let them go to hell and perish because you know what God, I don't care about him.
[time=2843] And I want to do this and I want to go over here and I want to talk to these people.
[time=2847] I, I, I, my agenda and an indifference
[time=2853] toward the nudge of God.
[time=2855] So you just sit there in the dark and you just think about it for a moment.
[time=2861] And let me just remind you that wherever you're hiding,
[time=2868] whatever it is you're hiding behind or in, the searching light of God's eye, it'll always find you.
[time=2877] And it comes, it comes a day later, it comes a week later, it comes a month later, but it comes and it might be over, you know, it might be over here or it, you know, it might be, you know, it might be back in the back, but all of a sudden boom, it appears.
[time=2892] And you're found and you might be back there or you might be over here, you know, or you, you know, you could be anywhere behind any of these facades and it just searches and it finally and time lands.
[time=2905] And I want to remind you, as the lights come up, I want to remind you of this, the searching light of God's eye, it's not mad at you.
[time=2912] It loves you.
[time=2914] It just wants to find you so it can point you toward
[time=2920] this incredible thing that he's called you to, be it a conversation or a world far, far away.
[time=2926] Ministry involvement or giving in ways that bring God-given resources back to the kingdom, you know, it's just, he's gonna find you.
[time=2936] And it's a loving eye, it's a loving search because he wants to point you toward what's right.
[time=2942] Sometimes that gets painful, but nonetheless, he finds us, he shines his light and he guides us toward truth.
[time=2950] Number three, write this down, what will he have to do to get your attention?
[time=2955] What will he have to do to get your attention?
[time=2959] And I want you just to write down Jonah 1 verses 10 through 17 and you can read that.
[time=2963] Read that to your kids tonight, read that to yourself tonight, read that, you know, in your small group this week.
[time=2968] I mean, just take some time and look at Jonah 1, 10 to 17 and look what God, look at the links to which God went to get this guy's attention and ask yourself, what is he gonna have to do to get mine, to get me to come to a point where I'm on my knees in the belly of the whale saying, oh God, all please, give me the opportunity to turn myself again towards you and to go and do what you've called me to do, whatever that might be.
[time=2996] Number four, write this one down.
[time=3003] And I really want you to think about this, I really want you to, whoever you are, you know, I want you to really give some thought to this one, imagine, imagine what he would do, imagine what he could do, imagine what might happen if you would follow.
[time=3018] Imagine what might happen if you would just follow him, if you would just go, if you would just, you know, take the time to build the relationship, to develop and cultivate the friendship and ask them, you know, if they'd like to come and hear a message of hope and forgiveness, meet a people who haven't forgotten what it's like to carry with us the baggage of our sin and our failure, but a people who have found what it means to be in relationship with the living God.
[time=3056] You know, imagine what might happen, who in your life, who might find hope and forgiveness,
[time=3065] whose dark, confusing, twisted life might all of a sudden be made whole.
[time=3071] What might he do if you were willing to go?
[time=3074] What unreached people group?
[time=3077] What tribe, what village, who have currently today, no light shining in their midst?
[time=3083] Might you go and reach?
[time=3088] From the remotest parts of the earth to your own kitchen table.
[time=3093] What might happen if you were willing
[time=3099] to not run from the call of God and try and hide from the call of God, but respond to the call of God and say, here am I.
[time=3107] Here am I, use me.
[time=3110] Allow me to be used of you.
[time=3113] Look at chapter three, go back to Jonah.
[time=3116] I don't want you to leave this morning without seeing what God did as Jonah was willing to say yes and follow.
[time=3125] Look at Jonah chapter three.
[time=3128] Look with me at verses five to 10.
[time=3130] So he goes through the city, right?
[time=3132] He proclaims the message.
[time=3134] And in verse five, we pick it up.
[time=3136] Then the people of Nineveh believed in God and they called a fast and put on sackcloth from the greatest to the least of them.
[time=3146] When the word reached the king of Nineveh, he arose from his throne, laid aside his robe from him, covered himself with sackcloth and set on the ashes.
[time=3154] And he issued a proclamation and it said, "In Nineveh, by the decree of the king and his nobles, "do not let man, beast, heard or flock, taste a thing, "do not let them eat or drink water, "but both man and beast must be covered with sackcloth "and let men call on God." Capital G, earnestly that each may turn from his wicked way and from the violence which is in his hands.
[time=3181] Who knows?
[time=3181] The king says, "God may turn in relent "and withdraw his burning anger "so that we shall not perish.
[time=3190] "And when God saw their deeds, "when God saw their deeds, "that they turn from their wicked way." Don't miss this.
[time=3199] They turn from their wicked way because there was one who was, though finally, nonetheless in the end, willing to go and open his mouth and be an instrument that offered truth and hope and forgiveness.
[time=3216] When God, then God, it says, relented, concerning the calamity which he had declared, he would bring upon them and he did not do it.
[time=3226] Well, I hope that we've been clear.
[time=3233] I hope I've been somewhat clear with you this morning.
[time=3235] Please, just hang with me here for a second.
[time=3240] Whether it's an entire tribe, somewhere that's never heard the truth, whether it's a struggling family in Russia and I mean struggling, trying so hard to make it in this new world of theirs.
[time=3262] And spiritually, trying to forge ahead in a place that doesn't offer much hope.
[time=3267] Whether it's the Philippines, whether it's Russia, whether it's a tribe, whether it's the rescue mission right here in our own town, whether it's young gals coming to the crisis pregnancy center, whether it's India, I mean, wherever it is, there's an opportunity for you and I in some form or fashion to go, to make a difference that really matters.
[time=3292] And yes, right here in our own backyard,
[time=3298] you know, in a couple of weeks, we're gonna do what we've done here for 25 years and that is dedicate two full weekends to doing our very best with his help, to through the arts, through the drama and music and the gifts that God's given this family proclaim the truth to thousands and thousands and thousands of people here in Fort Wayne.
[time=3321] It's a Christmas with Blackhawk.
[time=3322] And I know most of you have gotten your tickets and you got your envelopes turned in and back, but you know what?
[time=3329] There's a few left.
[time=3330] You can go to the window today and you can pick up some more free ones.
[time=3335] You can buy some $10 ones, but you know what?
[time=3337] There's some left.
[time=3338] Who else could you bring?
[time=3344] Who else represents for you that sense of going, not hiding, but going and offering the one thing, the only thing that can save, the only thing that can bring direction, the only thing that can clear it all up.
[time=3359] And I would just love to see all those.
[time=3362] We've got a few tickets left, free ones.
[time=3365] I just love to see him gone today because we were a people who said, you know what, I got my eight, but you know, I could use 20 if I really got serious about it.
[time=3374] And so whether it's your role that he wants you to play
[time=3382] in a hut somewhere across the world or whether it's right here in your own backyard, Jerusalem or the remotest part, please, please be a people, join us in trying to be a people
[time=3399] who are willing to go and be used of God in amazing ways.
[time=3404] That's our hope and that's our prayer for you.
[time=3407] Would you stand with me and let's close in a word of prayer and don't forget to visit those tables, meet those people and thank them for what they're doing for the kingdom.
[time=3416] Let's pray.
[time=3417] God, we thank you so very much for the opportunity
[time=3424] you've given us to be together here today in this place.
[time=3428] And we realize that as we stand here this morning, God across the world, somewhere in so many different places there are people, some who are believers and they stand too, they find themselves in a place of worship where they've come to be encouraged and reminded that the greatest cause of all is really worth living for and giving their lives for.
[time=3452] Thing is, God, that some of those will, some of those people will give their lives.
[time=3458] And we stand here in utter safety by and large and comfort.
[time=3465] And God, we understand that there is a people to reach here and we understand that there are those to reach there.
[time=3472] So God, you, you figure it out.
[time=3474] You let us know who you want to go and who you want to have stay.
[time=3479] But whether we go or stay, God, give us the courage to go and to be active and to be engaged in the greatest endeavor of all.
[time=3488] God, helping with your guidance and your truth and your spirit and your power, helping seeking people, find and follow you.
[time=3501] Oh, God, we pray for help in that very endeavor.
[time=3505] And we are so grateful for the time that we've had today to be together, to worship you, to be reminded of a guy who, like us, sometimes, we're so very reluctant.
[time=3516] We get so focused on things that don't really matter.
[time=3520] And so God, like you did with him, find us.
[time=3524] Shine your light on our hearts and help us see again what it is, who it is that you've called us to.
[time=3532] And God, give us the strength to go and do it.
[time=3535] Fund all the people agreed and said, amen.
[time=3550] (gentle music)
