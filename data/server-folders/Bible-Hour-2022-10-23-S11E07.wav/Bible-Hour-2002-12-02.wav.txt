[time=505] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, pastor here at Blackhawk, and we want to welcome you again to the Bible Hour.
[time=511] What you're about to see is the first in a three-part series.
[time=515] We've started a series called Questions About Heaven.
[time=519] It's a three-week look at something that, you know, no matter how long I've walked with God,
[time=525] no matter how long those I know have lived in relationship with him, whether you've known him for two months or 20 years, there's just something about heaven.
[time=535] There's something about eternity.
[time=537] There's something about forever that just raises a lot of questions.
[time=542] And we're so thankful, you know, as always for God's word, because as we go to it, like we will today and in the next couple of weeks, we get encouraged all over again.
[time=552] We get reminded of things that we sometimes forget.
[time=556] And so I just want to encourage you.
[time=559] I hope that today encourages your heart.
[time=561] I hope maybe it begins to remind you of some things that would be of help to you in your spiritual journey, but I really want to do this.
[time=568] I want to invite you to come and be a part of these next two weeks, the 15th of December and the 22nd.
[time=575] We're going to continue the series.
[time=577] And on the 15th in our second part in the series, we're going to look closely at many of the questions that people have about heaven.
[time=586] We're also going to the following week.
[time=589] Take a look at something very, very important, and that is how you know, how it is that we can know for sure that we're going to be there.
[time=599] When it's all said and done, when your time and mind here in this place is over, what does God's word say?
[time=606] What is it that we can look at that can give us the assurance that when your final breath is taken, you will spend eternity with God.
[time=615] It's a very real thing, and it's something that all of us need to grapple with, and I think understand better.
[time=621] So join us as we continue to look at questions about heaven.
[time=626] There are a lot of things I don't get.
[time=629] Some of my friends are here today. It doesn't surprise them.
[time=632] But I'm not real technical. I'm not real mechanical.
[time=636] So there's even a little affectionate nickname for me here among the staff, and that's techno man.
[time=643] And that's because I want all the benefits of technology, but I don't have any clue on how it's all working.
[time=649] So it's kind of like that in my house.
[time=652] There are a lot of things I just don't get.
[time=654] I don't get how to record a show onto the VCR tape at all.
[time=658] And it's a good thing DVDs are coming out.
[time=661] But I call my mom when I need something like that.
[time=664] Mechanically, that nut and bolt and wrench thing, is that what goes together, nut bolts and wrenches?
[time=670] The righty, tidy, lefty, loosey?
[time=672] Never worked for me.
[time=674] Because which way is right, which way is left?
[time=676] On the up, on the down, and if you're underneath like this, does it still apply?
[time=680] There are just a lot of things I just don't get.
[time=683] I don't get why I have hair in places I don't want, and why I don't get ahead of me.
[time=689] That's terrible.
[time=692] And there are just a lot of things I do not get.
[time=696] How all that stuff got in the light bulb.
[time=698] There are just all kinds of things.
[time=701] I'm not alone.
[time=704] David writes in the Psalms a couple times.
[time=707] You know, the created to the Creator, the saved to the Savior, the obedient servant to the Lord.
[time=713] He writes, you know, who can take the mind of God and just peruse it and say, it looks like this over here and like that over there.
[time=720] And oh, I figured God out.
[time=723] You know, who can say that?
[time=726] And when it comes to heaven, it's much the same way.
[time=730] It's much the same way.
[time=732] And Sandra's going to read something that someone in our family wrote from that perspective, from the created to the Creator, that says, you know, there's just some things about heaven.
[time=743] I don't understand.
[time=751] When I say the word heaven, what comes to your mind?
[time=755] Do you picture a beautiful city, angels singing praise, a loved one who is already there?
[time=763] Perhaps you see Jesus on a throne surrounded by lots and lots of people.
[time=768] I asked my daughter what she thought heaven would be like.
[time=771] She answered without any hesitation.
[time=773] Heaven is a big, shiny, happy place where God is.
[time=778] I laughed.
[time=780] But then I realized that my own theology doesn't go a whole lot deeper.
[time=785] As I wonder about heaven, the lyrics of a popular song come to my mind.
[time=791] Will I stand in your presence or to my knees?
[time=795] Will I fall?
[time=797] Will I sing?
[time=798] Alleluia?
[time=799] Will I be able to speak at all?
[time=803] I can only imagine.
[time=806] And that's my problem with heaven.
[time=809] I can only imagine it.
[time=811] I can't really picture it because I don't have all the facts.
[time=815] God gives us glimpses of heaven and his word, but they are just pieces of a puzzle.
[time=821] I want God to put the puzzle together for me.
[time=823] Or at least let me see the picture on the box so I know what to expect.
[time=828] I find some of the puzzle pieces in the book of Revelation.
[time=831] I've learned that heaven is not only beautiful but also a place where there won't be any more death or mourning or crying or pain.
[time=843] That sure sounds good.
[time=845] Especially when life on earth can be so full of pain.
[time=850] But I want to know more.
[time=852] How much of my time will be spent singing, talking, laughing?
[time=856] Will I read books, go fishing, ride horses?
[time=859] Will I know the other people there?
[time=862] And what will I look like?
[time=864] I've learned I'll have a new body, but how will that work for those who died as infants?
[time=869] Will we all be the same age?
[time=872] Will I have any say in picking out my new face?
[time=876] Well, the lack of such details is just one of the things that makes me a little nervous.
[time=882] The other thing is the realization that heaven is forever.
[time=888] The concept of forever has always been mind-boggling to me.
[time=892] Well, as a little girl, I'd lie in bed at night and think about heaven.
[time=896] If I really stretched my imagination, I could picture being there a hundred years, even a thousand.
[time=902] But I could never quite get my arms around being in heaven forever.
[time=906] I would think of it going on and on for billions of years.
[time=909] And finally, I'd throw the covers over my head to block the thoughts.
[time=913] It's just too much for me to grasp.
[time=916] But then, when I pretended that heaven did have an end, that was even scarier.
[time=923] As incomprehensible as forever was, it was even worse to think of heaven being temporary,
[time=929] because that would mean that every moment spent there would be one moment closer to the end.
[time=935] Oh, no.
[time=937] I love the thought of being in heaven to actually be with the Lord.
[time=942] I just haven't come to terms with the forever part.
[time=947] Forever is a scary word to me.
[time=950] I think because I just don't fully understand how incredible heaven will really be.
[time=956] I am so wrapped up in this earthly life, what I can see and taste and touch, that it's hard for me to imagine heaven any differently.
[time=965] And it's like trying to imagine a new color.
[time=971] Some of my fears also come from a lack of understanding about God.
[time=977] I know that He has forgiven me, but I'm still afraid that somehow He'll be disappointed in me because of my sins.
[time=984] When I also wonder if I'll be able to truly enjoy being in heaven, if I know that people I love and care about here on earth won't be there with me.
[time=997] I don't have it all figured out.
[time=999] I suppose I never will in this life, but I do know that the God who knit me together in my mother's womb and have a plan from the beginning of the world to redeem me has heaven under control.
[time=1017] And the closer I am to Him and the more I trust Him, the more excited I am about being in heaven forever.
[time=1029] Well, that was well written and well read and captures.
[time=1036] I'm sure in many ways some of the questions and some of the thoughts that you have as well as myself as we think about this place called heaven and this thing called eternity.
[time=1049] It's quite a thought.
[time=1052] Well, I want to want to invite you to join us today in the next two weeks.
[time=1057] Next week we're going to come back and we're going to talk a little bit more about some of the questions about heaven.
[time=1062] And then week three, December 22, we're going to just get really specific and do our very best to look at God's Word and just see what it says about who goes to heaven, how that works, how all that pans out, and so we invite you to be a part of that.
[time=1077] But this morning as we move you to this initial discussion about forever, I want to kind of just walk you through kind of a chronology, kind of a time frame as to how in fact we get to this place called forever.
[time=1092] Okay, and we're going to try and have some fun doing it.
[time=1095] So here's how I want to do it.
[time=1097] I want you to stand up right where you're at, okay?
[time=1099] Everybody stand up, put your Bibles down, put your pens down, put your kids down, whatever you got in your lap, just kind of stand up and spread out.
[time=1106] Some of you may have been through a thing called Walk Through the Bible, maybe Walk Through the Old Testament or Walk.
[time=1111] It's a program where they put hand motions to the biblical narrative.
[time=1115] So we're going to do our own little deal today.
[time=1117] We're going to put hand motions to kind of the chronology of events that we kind of call the end, kind of the end times thing, kind of asking the question, what happens when, what happens when I die.
[time=1130] If you ask that question, raise your hand. Great, yeah, we're going to just kind of talk you through how that goes and how we go from the point of when we die to the point of forever.
[time=1140] Okay, so here's what I need you to do.
[time=1143] Everybody hands up like this two fists together.
[time=1146] All right, everybody, oh, good job.
[time=1148] Okay, here's how this works.
[time=1150] At the point of death when I die, and the Bible says that there is no time in between there.
[time=1154] When you die, it's like, boom, this starts to happen.
[time=1157] Okay, body and soul are together.
[time=1160] Okay, at the point of death, body and soul separate.
[time=1163] Yeah, a little slow.
[time=1165] Try it again.
[time=1166] Point of death, body and soul separate.
[time=1169] Body to the ground and goes down.
[time=1172] Soul into the presence of the Lord.
[time=1177] Oh, you slow again.
[time=1178] We'll try it again.
[time=1179] Stay with me.
[time=1180] Okay, point of death.
[time=1181] Body and soul separate, body to the ground, soul into the presence of the Lord and hold it
[time=1188] right there.
[time=1189] If you've got a bad back, you can stand up.
[time=1191] Other than that, hold your spot.
[time=1193] God's Word says that we remain in the presence of the Lord in the state of our soul, right?
[time=1198] Until a thing called, ready?
[time=1200] Second coming.
[time=1201] Everybody go, whoa.
[time=1202] Oh, louder.
[time=1204] All right, see the second coming, some folks call it the rapture.
[time=1208] It says the trumpet of God's going to sound.
[time=1210] It says there's going to be a shout.
[time=1212] And here's the deal.
[time=1213] It says everybody is going to hear it.
[time=1215] Okay, just stop and think about that for a second.
[time=1218] Everybody's going to hear it.
[time=1220] Everybody everywhere.
[time=1221] So it's going to be pretty loud, all right?
[time=1223] So we're back in the presence of the Lord, right?
[time=1225] And we stay separated from body and soul in the presence of the Lord until the second coming.
[time=1231] Whoa.
[time=1232] Nice job.
[time=1233] All right.
[time=1235] Hands up.
[time=1236] Keep it there.
[time=1238] And at that point, we believe the Bible teaches that, okay, you ready?
[time=1243] We teach that body and soul are reunited.
[time=1248] Good job.
[time=1249] Body and soul reunited.
[time=1251] And then we are taken to be with him.
[time=1254] Go like that.
[time=1255] Okay.
[time=1256] Try it again.
[time=1257] Watch this from the beginning.
[time=1258] Okay.
[time=1259] And you can even like say it with me if you feel brave.
[time=1261] At the point of death, body and soul separated.
[time=1264] Body to the ground, soul into the presence of the Lord.
[time=1269] We stay in that state until the second coming.
[time=1272] Whoa.
[time=1274] At which point, body and soul are reunited and we're taken to be with him.
[time=1280] Great job.
[time=1281] Now, hang on.
[time=1282] You want to give yourselves a hand?
[time=1283] Go ahead.
[time=1284] Yeah.
[time=1285] You're doing good.
[time=1286] Okay.
[time=1287] Now watch this.
[time=1288] Everybody put up seven because what comes next is a thing called seven years of pain.
[time=1296] Cover up.
[time=1297] Ooh.
[time=1298] Don't want to see it.
[time=1299] Don't want to be there.
[time=1300] Gonna be a dark day.
[time=1301] It's called the tribulation.
[time=1302] Okay.
[time=1303] Again, seven years of pain.
[time=1307] But there's a great ending because that's followed by the thousand year.
[time=1311] Grab your scepter, thousand year rain.
[time=1313] Go like that.
[time=1314] Like a king.
[time=1315] Okay.
[time=1317] Six years of pain followed by a thousand year rain and that's a cool thing because the
[time=1323] Bible teaches that Christ will return and rule for a thousand years over the earth and
[time=1329] it'll be a great rain.
[time=1330] It'll be a time of peace and a time of joy and a time of harmony.
[time=1334] And an amazing thing happens, it says, at the end of that thousand year rain during
[time=1341] which Satan has been kept in captivity.
[time=1345] He's released.
[time=1346] And I want you to kind of crouch down and I want you to do this.
[time=1350] Satan is released and he's kind of like conniving dude, you know.
[time=1354] He's down here kind of looking around, all right.
[time=1357] So stand up.
[time=1359] Seven years of pain followed by a thousand year rain at the end of which Satan is released.
[time=1367] Okay.
[time=1368] No, it's kind of an awkward position so I'll let you stand up.
[time=1370] But listen, here's the amazing thing.
[time=1371] Don't miss this.
[time=1372] I was reading it again this week.
[time=1374] At the end of that thousand year rain of harmony and peace and Satan's released, it says that
[time=1381] he'll actually win people over to his side again, which boggles my mind and shows you
[time=1389] how susceptible we are to the enemy and his, I mean, a thousand years of peace and joy
[time=1396] and harmony, he gets released but not for long because then comes everybody puts your
[time=1402] foot up.
[time=1403] Then he says, it says in Revelation that the thing comes to a screeching halt and Satan is condemned.
[time=1408] Boom.
[time=1409] Just boom.
[time=1410] Squish the dude out right there, all right.
[time=1412] So it's a seven years of pain followed by a thousand year rain at the end of which Satan
[time=1418] is released but not for long because he is, boom, condemned and along with him, not a
[time=1425] funny topic along with him at a place called the Great White Throne.
[time=1432] All the unbelieving dead, all those who've chosen not to believe are judged as well.
[time=1443] It says they are thrown into a place of eternal separation from God.
[time=1449] The believing family of God at that point begins this thing called, remember the Tommy
[time=1457] Walker song where we do this, go ahead, put your hands up.
[time=1460] It's called forever, forever, forever.
[time=1466] That's where it starts.
[time=1468] Okay, you can sit down and on the screen you're going to see some passages just so you know I didn't make all that up.
[time=1475] You can write that down and let me just say this, that would be what we just did would be called pre-trib pre-mill.
[time=1481] I should probably have you stand back up and we'll do like post-trib, but we'd be here all day doing that but really like biblical scholars for years and years and years have kind of differed as far as the chronology of some of what we just looked at.
[time=1495] That would be kind of a pre-trib pre-mill look.
[time=1499] Some day we'll all get there and we'll find out who was right and who was wrong and it won't even matter because we'll like be in heaven so nobody's going to be like bummed or anything.
[time=1509] That's how that works.
[time=1510] Let me read this to you, Revelation 21 verses 1 to 5, Revelation chapter 21 verses 1 to 5
[time=1521] it says this, John on the island of Patmos sees this vision, God reveals to him what
[time=1530] this is all going to be like and look like and he says then I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth passed away and there is no longer any sea and I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God and made
[time=1546] ready as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a loud voice from the throne saying behold the tabernacle of God is among men and he shall dwell among them and they shall
[time=1558] be his people and God himself shall be among them and he shall wipe away every what?
[time=1564] Hear from their eyes and there shall no longer be any what?
[time=1568] There shall no longer be any morning or crying or pain.
[time=1572] The first things have passed away and he who sits on the throne said behold I am making
[time=1578] all things new and he said right, John right for these words are faithful and true.
[time=1588] Faithful and true.
[time=1591] Faithful, why does forever, why does eternity, why does heaven seem so scary and unsettling
[time=1599] to some, why does the bright and glorious reality of heaven seem so dim even dull at
[time=1605] times in my own heart and life, why, why doesn't the thought of heaven and forever thrill my
[time=1612] soul like I sense it should, why does it seem so far away to me when the pages of scripture
[time=1621] seem to indicate it should feel so close and near.
[time=1628] In all honesty just between me and you and I'll just shoot straight with you, why is
[time=1635] it that sometimes and I say this to my shame, why is it that sometimes in the midst of all
[time=1645] that confusion I sometimes feel as if I'd rather stay here than go there.
[time=1654] I don't know and I want you know that today I, you know usually when we spend these kind
[time=1661] of times together usually I say, usually I say we.
[time=1666] You know what today I'm just going to say I, me and I just want to admit this to you.
[time=1672] You know I bump into a lot of people around this place who I feel like are a lot further down the road on this than I am.
[time=1680] I know people they seem to live with a real sense of clarity and confidence about forever
[time=1687] and heaven and I'm getting there and God's growing me in that but I struggle at times
[time=1694] and I think as I ask these questions again of myself this week I came up with a pretty
[time=1700] decent answer, I think I get so confused and I think I sometimes lose track and I think
[time=1706] sometimes the perspective wanes because you know what sometimes I forget things, things
[time=1713] I need to remember.
[time=1716] Sometimes you see I forget life changing, eternity altering truth found right here in this book, sometimes so many times I forget divine principles that bring an eternal perspective
[time=1729] to my otherwise finite and limited and temporal mind and existence here.
[time=1736] I'm just guilty so many times of forgetting truth that I need to hold on to, truth that
[time=1744] brings clarity and purpose and I need desperately at times to be reminded and in turn pointed
[time=1750] again toward heaven, my home, the place that I was made to be in, well what is it that
[time=1760] I forget and again I won't speak for you all just speak for me and if the confusion sounds familiar then why don't you just jump on in with me and we'll wrestle our way through.
[time=1770] What are the things I forget?
[time=1771] There are many.
[time=1772] This morning I want you to write down three.
[time=1775] There are three things that I tend to forget again and again.
[time=1779] Number one write this down, I forget too many times that earthly dreams fall short.
[time=1785] Earthly dreams fall short, write that down.
[time=1788] See sometimes what happens in my life is that heaven begins to and is forced to compete
[time=1794] with earthly dreams.
[time=1796] Does that make sense to me try and explain?
[time=1799] You see when I was a kid I grew up in the church, didn't come to know the Lord till I was twenty but I grew up in the church listening to my dad deliver messages and listening to Sunday school teachers give lessons and I knew from an early age that a day was coming when he would return and take us all away and I used to think and I thought
[time=1819] it as I grew, oh God please wait don't do that until I get to do this.
[time=1824] Sound familiar?
[time=1825] And it wasn't just like kid stuff, those dreams followed me all through my life.
[time=1833] I was a little kid living in the Bay Area and I used to think oh God please I want to see Willie Mays play.
[time=1839] He played for the Giants then with Willie McCovey and all those guys.
[time=1842] I just wanted to see Willie Mays before this big trumpet thing happened and then I got
[time=1848] a little older and I wanted to play varsity basketball as the ninth grader.
[time=1853] It was just a dream, it was just a hope, it was just something I wanted to work toward and oh God please no don't do that until I get to play varsity ball and then I got a
[time=1864] little older and I used to lay in bed and think oh what would it be like?
[time=1867] To hit a game winning shot at the college level don't come back please let me just do this and then you know and got to do that a couple of times.
[time=1877] Then I saw Deborah for the first time and I said oh God please don't come back and it
[time=1889] wasn't you know it wasn't what you're thinking it wasn't just the it wasn't just the physical stuff it was just the joy of realizing there was this incredible relationship that he lets us be a part of and yeah it had its downsides and struggles but oh God please let me let me be married and let me know what it's like to be with someone and to love someone and to be loved and then we got married and then you know both of us began to dream earthly
[time=1915] dreams together and it was like oh God please you know could we have some kids and he answered
[time=1921] that dream abundantly and we are grateful for the answered dreams and we just want to you
[time=1929] know it's like oh God please not not that until we get to do some firsts until we get to go here and do that and watch them experience this and all of it has come true and please
[time=1945] hear me as I say this okay please understand the spirit with which I say this because I had a great time seeing Willie Mays and I loved playing ball and I love my wife and I love our family but the more I walk through this life and the more I try to grow in my
[time=1962] relationship with God there's this there's this thing in my soul that says I'm not quite
[time=1970] there as good as it all is it's it's not quite enough they're still an ache something hasn't
[time=1980] happened that's supposed to and the Apostle Paul captures that in the book of Romans look
[time=1990] if you will at Romans 8 he talks I call it an ache in my soul he calls it a groaning and
[time=1998] he says in Romans chapter 8 I'm going to pick it up in verse 22 Romans chapter 8 verse 22
[time=2005] he says riding to the church at Rome he says for we know believers he's talking to believers here for we know that the whole creation groans and suffers the pains of childbirth together
[time=2018] until now and not only this but also we ourselves having the fruit first fruits of the spirit
[time=2025] having come into relationship with Christ having our eternity's set even we ourselves
[time=2031] grown within ourselves and how does he describe that groaning waiting waiting
[time=2040] waiting eagerly for our adoptions as sons the redemption of our body the adoption and the
[time=2049] redemption that is to come and Paul says we've grown because we know down deep in our souls that
[time=2057] until that point this doesn't get fully yes he gives blessings yes good things happen but it doesn't
[time=2065] get fully filled until we're in a place called heaven wow some of you are sitting here this morning
[time=2077] and you're listening to me and in all honesty you hear me talk about that ache in my soul after
[time=2084] all that he's given me will he maze winning shots a wife and kids and you're going you're nuts
[time=2090] what do you mean you're not satisfied I'd be or you're sitting here this morning and you're
[time=2098] saying you know what I don't get this groaning thing I'm fine in fact I'm doing really well
[time=2104] I got a lot I've got an enormous amount in my life going on and I'm really really doing pretty good
[time=2110] with it and you know what it's only because I've been there that I can respectfully but forthrightly
[time=2117] say to you this you're not satisfied you've just become nearsighted that's all
[time=2129] you've become nearsighted and it happens happens to me happens to many people in this room see what
[time=2136] what's going on there is you and I just have become at times more attached to stuff in this place than we have become attached to him and that place and Colossians 3 says that we are to
[time=2148] seek the things where above that we are to keep our eyes and our hearts fixed to set our minds on
[time=2156] things above to somehow live today here with that place in you and you know what that's really
[time=2166] really difficult it's hard to do it isn't it it's hard to do the Abraham thing look at Hebrews
[time=2174] look at Hebrews 11 Hebrews 11 9 kind of just in these few verses here it just paints out an
[time=2181] incredible picture of this guy Abraham who lived by faith and who walked through life with this
[time=2187] mindset and this attitude of being here but being here with heaven and eternity in view says there
[time=2196] that by faith he lived as a stranger Hebrews 11 verse 9 by faith he lived as an alien it says
[time=2205] you see that as an alien in the land of promise as in a foreign land that's how he lived that's how
[time=2215] he dwelled as one in a foreign land look at that phrase dwelling in tents dwelling in tents
[time=2222] what's that say just that phrase what's it somebody go ahead just tell me what's that say to you
[time=2231] temporary another word come to mind no mad any other phrases come to mind
[time=2237] temporary no mad wanderer just passing what just passing through
[time=2247] as in a foreign land like a tourist you know traveling light attached not too much
[time=2257] but living with the reality of this in view and please don't miss how he was able to live like that
[time=2265] right there in the next verse says in Hebrews 11 verse 10 for he was looking for the city
[time=2271] what do you think that is heaven for he was looking watching he had in view a city which has
[time=2283] foundations whose architect and builder is god he lived here with heaven in view people he lived
[time=2290] here he lived here close to him he lived here and he kept here he kept this place in perspective
[time=2297] and so many times i forget and it gets all messed up i forget earthly dreams fall short
[time=2304] number two i forget earthly pursuits leave us empty would you write that down i forget way too
[time=2311] many times and again to my shame that earthly pursuits leave us empty
[time=2318] coming to walk out on a little bit a little plank here you all have been gracious to me in the past
[time=2325] and just i'm going to continue to just trust that you understand that i'm no different than any of
[time=2331] you and i want to make this statement because i believe it's true and i believe everybody in this room understands to some degree what i mean what do i mean by earthly pursuits leave us empty
[time=2343] what i mean is this one of the one of the ugliest sickest feelings out there in my own life is the
[time=2354] utter and complete emptiness 30 seconds after the sin does that sound familiar to anybody
[time=2365] please nod your heads okay i got company on the plank one of the ugliest sickest feelings out there is the utter emptiness 30 seconds after the sin
[time=2377] you see because sin convinced sin works so very hard to convince you and to convince me that
[time=2384] making that choice doing that saying that even just thinking this see sin says that that when you do that it will bring euphoria and god's word works so hard that convinces that no and it teaches us and it shows us that it will
[time=2402] not be euphoric it will be empty nothing zero not a nothing just destruction just shame just pain
[time=2417] there's a guy in the Old Testament he knew a lot about this his name was Solomon
[time=2426] Solomon knew that empty pathetic ugly feeling and he wrote about it in Ecclesiastes look at
[time=2433] Ecclesiastes chapter two go to Psalms go on to Proverbs and then that very next book before you
[time=2440] get to the song songs is a book called Ecclesiastes and it says there in the second chapter just get
[time=2447] a load of this i don't know if you've read this before if you have boy it'll be a it'll be a great
[time=2453] reminder if you haven't boy just hang on watch what this guy did watch the road he traveled look what he learned Solomon says i said to myself come now i will test you with pleasure so enjoy
[time=2465] yourself and behold it too was futility and i said of laughter it is madness and of pleasure
[time=2472] what does it accomplish i explored with my mind how to stimulate my body with wine while my mind
[time=2479] was guiding me wisely and how to take hold of folly until i could see what good there is for
[time=2485] the sons of men to do under heaven the few years of their lives i enlarged my works i built houses
[time=2491] for myself i planted vineyards for myself i made gardens and parks for myself and i planted in them
[time=2497] all kinds of fruit trees i made ponds of water for myself from which to irrigate not just a clump and
[time=2503] not just a group but a forest of growing trees i bought male and female slaves and i had
[time=2510] home-born slaves and i possessed flocks and herds larger than all who preceded me in Jerusalem
[time=2516] also i collected for myself silver and gold and the treasure of kings and provinces i provided for
[time=2522] myself male and female singers and the pleasures of men namely many concubines i think it was about
[time=2532] a thousand if i'm not mistaken then i became then all that then i became great and increased
[time=2542] more than all who preceded me in Jerusalem my wisdom also stood by me and all watched this
[time=2548] and all that my eyes desired i did not refuse them can you imagine i mean don't for too long
[time=2558] all that my eyes desired he said i did not refuse them i did not withhold my heart from any pleasure
[time=2565] at all for my heart was pleased because of all my labor and this was my reward for all my labor
[time=2572] so many times that's what we think you know what i deserve this thus i considered all my activities which my hands had done and the labor which i had exerted
[time=2583] and behold all was vanity vanity futile and striving after wind and there was no profit
[time=2594] none under the sun what's he saying you want to find some satisfaction through sin go chase the wind
[time=2610] that's what he's saying you go try you go chase the wind you want to find some satisfaction
[time=2617] through stuff through what you accumulate it's going to be empty he says there's going to be nothing there in the end you want to find some satisfaction through
[time=2628] achievement he says it's futile vanity and you know what you you may not be rich you could be sitting this morning going well yeah that's
[time=2639] Solomon he had all that me i'm just over here and you know what i need you know what i gotta
[time=2645] i just like a few hundred bucks in the bank you know if i could just get a car that runs i'd be
[time=2651] okay and it doesn't matter folks whether we're talking about a car that runs or whether we're
[time=2657] talking about ponds and parks and thousands of slaves see because in the end neither of them
[time=2663] quench neither of them bring the answer to the thirst that resides in us and nothing here will
[time=2670] not a thing i forget earthly dreams fall short i forget earthly pursuits leave me empty and i forget
[time=2682] number three write it down earthly philosophy dims hope i forget earthly philosophy dims hope
[time=2689] look at Colossians back in the new testament Colossians chapter two
[time=2695] Colossians chapter two paul writes here to the church at Colossae and in the second chapter
[time=2701] verse eight it says this see to it paul says see to it that no one takes you captive
[time=2707] please understand right out of the gate that in this discussion of modern philosophy in this
[time=2714] discussion of secular thought what's at stake and i've seen it way too many times
[time=2720] you'll never convince me of anything else what's at stake here is a thing called captivity because it can capture you it can bring chains it can bring bondage it can bring it dims hope
[time=2733] and he says see to it that nobody takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception
[time=2740] according to the traditions of men according to the elementary principles of the world rather than according to christ for in him all the fullness of deity dwells in bodily form
[time=2751] and in him you have been made see what moves you and what moves me and what moves so many young
[time=2758] people today toward different ways of thinking and and different schools of thought and and and
[time=2764] different ways of thinking about life and god and people it's this it's this desire to be somehow
[time=2771] made whole they want to find themselves they want to see what's out there that can complete them
[time=2778] they say and God's word says wait a minute and i want to say wait a minute time out
[time=2787] in him plus nothing you have been made complete and he is the head overall rule and authority
[time=2797] see it's dangerous stuff it really is modern philosophy no matter how you slice it it pretty
[time=2804] much says one of two things you can write him down and i'm really condensing this i know but by and large modern secular thought says one of two things either there is no hope
[time=2817] this is all over after you die nihilism one school of thought says basically there is no hope
[time=2823] a second school of thought called humanism says no no no wait a minute hope is hope is here
[time=2829] and hope resides in you they say you're the hope you're good you're it you create your own hope
[time=2839] either way you go it gets ugly really really quick how about the no hope camp
[time=2848] the no hope camp much of modern thought says the darkness will prevail there's just nothing you can do about it nothing we say or do really matters you can try but effort won't win you can give but generosity gets overrun you can help but benevolence brings too little too late and besides they say there is no life beyond this so who cares throw in the towel it just doesn't
[time=2870] matter but Hebrews 10 36 says you have need of endurance for in a very little while he was coming
[time=2877] will come this isn't the end there is something to come and it says you and i have need of endurance
[time=2885] for in a very little while he was coming will come and like the screen said earlier from Philippians 2 every knee will what bow and every tongue will what confess
[time=2895] it is going to happen and you and i don't need a nihilistic pessimistic mindset no we need to
[time=2903] fix our hearts and minds on what is true and right others say you're the hope others say that hope resides in the they use this phrase the inherent goodness of man
[time=2916] he helped me out a little bit here he read the papers lately he watched the news do you
[time=2924] you keep up with what's going on the utter trash the utter garbage that we left to ourselves produce
[time=2935] the things we do the stuff that takes place and you're going to tell me that i am inherently good
[time=2942] no read the paper better better yet read Romans 1 write it down read Romans 1
[time=2951] and look at what happens to man left to himself you know when i think about this
[time=2958] my mind just goes immediately i mean i think of i think of all of us but my mind i guess in a
[time=2964] special way goes to our students and we got a lot of students around here we got you know we got
[time=2970] middle school students and we got high school students and we've got college students you know and it makes me wonder about you know you know those of you in 8th 9th 10th 11th 12th grade you know it's not too long from now but you're going to sit in a classroom very likely
[time=2985] somewhere and they're going to tell you that you're an absolute idiot for your faith based
[time=2991] biblical worldview they're going to say you're weak mentally that you don't have the guts
[time=2998] to wrestle with and and take in and consider the myriad of truth options
[time=3004] and what are you going to say what are you going to do what is it that you're going to fall back on
[time=3013] there are college students right now hearing that and it just concerns my heart and it just fills me full of hope that that we're doing all that we
[time=3024] can to give you truth to help you realize that the fullness of deity dwells in him and in him you
[time=3031] have been made complete and you need him and you need his word and and nothing else
[time=3037] at all him and his word lived out in your life
[time=3044] how are we handling the philosophies of our day
[time=3050] philosophies that in the end stem strip and destroy hope Christ follower I want to just ask you this I'm going to ask two questions and we're going to
[time=3063] wrap it up please stay with me those of you sitting in this room today that know him
[time=3069] you have a relationship with him there's come that point in time when you have surrendered your heart and life to him let me just ask you honestly okay I've been honest you be honest how are you doing with heaven how are you doing today when it comes to really living today with an eternal perspective living
[time=3090] today with with heaven in mind how are you doing dwelling in tents how's it going I got a friend he doesn't live here and we talked periodically in the last two times
[time=3106] we've talked have been pretty powerful he's dying it's an older guy he's seen a lot of life
[time=3113] he's walked with God for years he's loved God deeply he's going to die no we have fans or buts
[time=3119] about six months maybe and I'm talking to him on the phone the day and it strikes me as I hang up
[time=3126] and as I'm driving home the utter clarity that exists today in his life as he talks about who he's
[time=3136] going to see and what he's going to say and where he's taking his family and what he's going to write and what he's going to leave behind as he talks about his schedule and as he talks about his life and as he talks about what the next six months will entail and I'm driving home kind of doing
[time=3153] a dual thing part of me going yeah you know what that's what people do when they find out they've got six months to live and then I jump over here and say hey Kelly why don't you wake up you're
[time=3163] terminally ill yourself why why does a physical medical diagnosis somehow not
[time=3172] what why do we think that somehow that's different hey people you're sick you're going to die
[time=3178] James says this lives of vapor you don't know when and would you join me in an endeavor to just try with his help and with each other's help to live
[time=3192] terminally ill just every conversation and every trip and every night home and every
[time=3200] ministry opportunity with the urgency that comes when we live with the reality that this place is
[time=3208] fleeting and passing and there is a better place and a better objective and a better place to rest
[time=3216] our hope those of you still searching those of you here this morning and you're still seeking
[time=3222] whether you realize it or not whether you sense it or want to admit it without Christ without forgiveness without relationship please hear me I say this with a sense of urgency and a great sense of love you will fall short earthly dreams don't cut it you will end up empty and if
[time=3238] you're not careful your hope will get dimmed and I believe what this book says and if you don't come
[time=3248] to this point of realizing that what I just said and accepting a free gift the gift of his son
[time=3254] Jesus Christ if you don't surrender your heart and life to him fully and completely
[time=3260] this eternity thing it's real and there's a place called hell
[time=3270] and like all of a sudden there's people going oh gosh you know don't talk about you know what
[time=3276] I'm going to talk about hell because it's a real place and you know what those of you trying to figure this thing out I don't want you to go there I don't want you to spend eternity there
[time=3286] he does he he wants you to come to life and forgiveness and purpose and meaning and relationship
[time=3293] with him and this eternity thing it's real and you have to understand that and yes salvation
[time=3302] and relationship with him yes it brings utter meaning and a great sense of joy to today but
[time=3308] please don't forget the eternity thing it's real and it's dark and it's painful when lived
[time=3319] separated from him heaven wow it's real as well and there is no pain and there are no tears
[time=3332] there is no sadness there is but joy and worship and a new heaven and a new earth
[time=3339] and this new Jerusalem this unbelievable city where the presence of God is and we're going to try
[time=3345] our best to answer some questions next week we won't answer them all but consider these things
[time=3353] would you please and come join us again as we continue in our questions about heaven would
[time=3361] you stand and let's pray you know what I with your heads bowed and your eyes closed I was so
[time=3376] very grateful and if you were here last week I'm sure you were to for the ministry of Joel DeSalm
[time=3382] and I just wanted to say to you one of the things I took away from that time together with Joel
[time=3390] much of what he said made an impact what he did at the end as he knelt and prayed just reminded me
[time=3397] how oftentimes you know we take things that the Bible says literally and we kind of discard them
[time=3406] so I just want to remind you today that you know this is a place where if you'd like to kneel you can kneel if you would like to stand you can stand the Bible gives a lot of different prayer
[time=3420] postures if you want to lift your head you can if you want to raise a hand quietly you can
[time=3426] the idea is that we would come before God and submission yielding ourselves literally to him
[time=3434] and so just keep that in mind as we come before him today let's pray father I pray today
[time=3442] that you would in ways that only you can that you would remind each of us in this place
[time=3448] of what it would mean and what it would look like to live today and tomorrow with heaven and you
[time=3455] and God where we have become attached in ways that are unhealthy God where hope has been dimmed
[time=3463] father where affections have gotten way out of control and steered us away from a clear view of
[time=3469] heaven and relationship with you God do a work bring confession and repentance wherever that's
[time=3475] needed bring the accountability of others God bring us together as a family and a desire to know
[time=3482] you and your word even more and more so that we would be a people willing and ready to make a difference in this world that you have us in for now and God we will look forward
[time=3494] to being with you someday and for those here still seeking and searching God we pray that
[time=3500] in whatever way we could be of help to them whatever questions we might be able to answer
[time=3506] whatever conversations we might just be able to have whatever hope or love we might be able to extend God give us the grace and ability to do so and we'll thank you for it and all God's people
[time=3519] said amen
[time=3541] so
[time=3571] you
