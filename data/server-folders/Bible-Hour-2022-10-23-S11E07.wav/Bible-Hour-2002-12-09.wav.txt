[time=420] Hi, I'm Mitch, teaching pastor at Blackhawk Ministries, and I want to thank you so much for joining our series on Heaven.
[time=426] And if you're watching today, Christmas with Blackhawk has two more performances, and they're at 330 and 730, a community of hope where the whole facility becomes a stage,
[time=436] and we invite you. If you show up, we'll do our best to make room for you, and we hope you can enjoy the community of hope.
[time=443] Our Christmas Eve service is December 24th at 6 p.m.
[time=447] We invite you, whether church or unchurched, just come and join us for a time of worship and singing Christmas carols in a short message and get your Christmas season started off on the right foot.
[time=459] And next week, we'll be having a series on Hurry.
[time=462] So we invite you to our Sunday services, and also on Wednesday night, and we just love to see you. Visit our website, get connected with us.
[time=470] We really appreciate the fact that we get to be with you on Sunday morning.
[time=474] ♫ ♫ Oh, we ♫ ♫ Are you Lord God Almighty ♫
[time=484] ♫ Were these the men ♫ ♫ Were these the men ♫ ♫ For you I hold thee ♫ ♫ Oh, we ♫ ♫ Are you Lord God Almighty ♫
[time=540] ♫ Were these the men ♫ ♫ Were these the men ♫ ♫ Amen ♫
[time=552] Father, you are so worthy.
[time=555] We've come here today to proclaim who you are.
[time=561] Your worthiness.
[time=563] God, you are Almighty.
[time=566] You are the maker of heaven, the maker of earth.
[time=569] Lord, you provided that awesome way for us to come back and to be reunited with you, Lord.
[time=578] You put to death our sin nature and you give us an opportunity to know you through your son and through that awesome sacrifice.
[time=588] Thank you that we can stop today and have the opportunity to remember just that, Lord.
[time=594] [AMEN] I don't know about you, but what happens to me when we sing a package of songs like that and it builds to that kind of a finish is that I get in this kind of euphoric state and some people would say that's really a mistake.
[time=610] Be careful.
[time=611] Don't let it get to the foot before it gets to the head and heart and stuff like that.
[time=615] I've heard all those things.
[time=617] What happens to me with music when they do it like that and we get to sing it together is that I really believe I begin to experience just a little bit about what it's going to be like to be freed from the burden and the painfulness of our own sin, the sin that wreaks havoc across our land, the pain that comes with sorrow and all that stuff, I think I get to be ushered in.
[time=643] And when we do that together, when we're collective and we do that, something happens to build me up and give me some relief to recharge me so I can face that stuff again.
[time=652] And I was just noticing there.
[time=654] I didn't feel any of that.
[time=656] That was gone.
[time=657] I like it.
[time=658] I'm so thankful for what Corbin and all these people do to help usher me into that.
[time=664] Well, this is really a big day for me.
[time=667] I just was sitting down there thinking I hadn't really thought about it, but it's a big day.
[time=672] I've been the administrator of our school here, Black Hawk, since the second year I came here.
[time=679] And that was 24 years ago, this year's my 24th year.
[time=683] And I'll not be doing that anymore because I really believe with all my heart, God has been putting a burden in my heart and moving me toward doing more with men.
[time=695] And I'm getting a chance to do that stuff.
[time=698] And I'm so thankful.
[time=699] The last couple years, I originally thought years ago that maybe I'd get to pastor a church when I was 50.
[time=705] And I think what's really happening is God's giving me the opportunity to do a bunch of the stuff that I wanted to do pastoring a church without all that other stuff.
[time=715] And that feels pretty good.
[time=718] And Kelly and the elders have been gracious enough to let me stay.
[time=722] And so I'm going to still be here at Black Hawk and get to preach some and men's ministry and adult Bible fellowships and all the stuff that we do in the mornings with adults.
[time=732] And I'll get to have a chance to lead some of that and serve there.
[time=736] And I'm really thankful for that.
[time=737] And then I get to do some other things too that I'm doing with other men in our community and with other leaders in our community.
[time=743] And God's giving me a chance to do that stuff.
[time=745] And I love doing it.
[time=747] And so I'm thankful.
[time=749] And I'm not the least bit frustrated or upset about any of this because it's right.
[time=755] It's the next step for me.
[time=757] I'm not mad at Black Hawk or school or school board or anybody.
[time=760] And it's kind of neat to leave.
[time=761] Not being angry with anybody or being told to leave.
[time=763] You know what I mean?
[time=764] So I'm thankful.
[time=765] The Lord's really done that.
[time=766] And he replaces me with somebody that's better than me.
[time=771] And many of you are going, of course.
[time=775] That's no brainer.
[time=777] Others, though, I've been able to con.
[time=779] You think I'm doing okay.
[time=780] But I'm really thankful.
[time=781] Sam, you can start walking up here now.
[time=783] Sam Barafell is the man that God is bringing to Black Hawk Christian school to, I keep telling him, take it to the next level that I can't go to.
[time=793] Because he is better equipped to do some of the things that our Christian school needs than I am right now.
[time=799] I'm just so thankful.
[time=801] I asked God, I started praying about this a long time ago.
[time=806] And then I called Sam.
[time=808] And I said, on the phone, I'd like for you to think about being the administrator at Black Hawk Christian school and start praying about it.
[time=817] I said, it's not my hire.
[time=818] I don't get to hire you.
[time=820] And I didn't even ask permission even to call you.
[time=822] This may be a mistake.
[time=823] But Kelly and the school board and elder board and staff, everybody has fallen in love with Sam and his family.
[time=829] And now he's coming here to lead our school and serve our
[time=835] school.
[time=836] And I'll tell you why I wanted him to come.
[time=838] Of all the people I know in the United States that are doing this stuff at Christian schools, he is the one that seemed to me to be the most focused toward doing things his way first,
[time=853] then with his family, and then the school.
[time=856] He is a God-centered man.
[time=858] And it's been obvious.
[time=860] And so I'm really thankful that he's agreed to come.
[time=862] And he'll start tomorrow.
[time=864] I'm hoping he's going to do his old job.
[time=866] No, I guess that's not right.
[time=867] He'll finish the year down at Anderson at Liberty Christian school and then come here and start in the summer.
[time=871] So Sam, thank you very much for coming.
[time=873] [APPLAUSE]
[time=882] Thank you so much for your gracious words and thank you for that welcome.
[time=886] This stuff about taking the school to the next level.
[time=888] I'm not sure exactly what that means.
[time=890] And that thing about all the guys in the nation that are doing this Christian school thing, don't buy it.
[time=896] Don't buy it.
[time=897] Listen, I just want to be used of God.
[time=900] And we are looking forward to coming here to Black Hawk Ministries, to Black Hawk Baptist, and Black Hawk Christian School and see how God can use us here.
[time=909] We weren't looking for a new assignment.
[time=912] We were happy and content and enjoying the exciting things that God was doing at Liberty Christian School in Anderson.
[time=919] But an interesting thing began to happen last spring in Jen and I.
[time=924] The Lord started doing a stirring kind of a thing.
[time=926] I can't even explain it past that.
[time=929] But in the middle of all that, Jen and I prayed this prayer.
[time=931] Lord, if our time is up at Liberty Christian, been there 11 years.
[time=935] Just show us that.
[time=937] We weren't looking to leave.
[time=938] We weren't anxious to leave.
[time=939] We were like Steve.
[time=940] We're happy to be there and happy to serve God there.
[time=943] But within 24 hours of Jen and I verbalizing that prayer, Steve called.
[time=949] And he picked up the phone and said, "Hey, Steve." And he said this before he even said hello.
[time=954] He said, "Sam, I think you ought to be the next administrator at Black Hawk Christian School." And I think I laughed.
[time=962] But you know what, I got our attention.
[time=964] And Jen and I began feeling the compunction, the compelling to begin to pray about that process.
[time=970] And that started about a five month long process.
[time=973] And we came and we visited a couple of times.
[time=975] We met with the leadership, Kelly and all the elders in the school board and all that.
[time=979] And I got to confess to you this morning that four and a half of those five months that I was resistive.
[time=985] I just couldn't believe that God would want us to move to Fort Wayne, Indiana and uproot our family and leave our school that we love and our church that we love and come.
[time=996] But at the end of that process, God made it exceedingly abundantly clear to Jen and me that this is what he had for us.
[time=1003] I don't know why God wants us at Black Hawk, but I do believe he wants us here.
[time=1008] And so we're looking forward to just coming and just rolling our sleeves and working in the school and seeing a lot of young kids have a passion for Christ and develop a Biblical world view that they can impact their world for Christ.
[time=1024] That's what gets me excited.
[time=1026] And I just want to be a part of that here at Black Hawk, Christian School and Black Hawk Church.
[time=1031] If I do have one strong point, Steve, it's my family.
[time=1035] And I'd like to introduce them.
[time=1036] If you'd stand up, guys, this is my beautiful wife, Jenny.
[time=1039] My son, Richard, who's a freshman, Lauren in the red sweater, who's a seventh grader, even though she looks like she's a sophomore, she's not.
[time=1047] Guys, stay away.
[time=1048] (laughter) And my youngest daughter, Elise, who's in sixth grade.
[time=1052] Guys, I love you.
[time=1053] And thank you for being obedient, too.
[time=1055] (applause)
[time=1062] I would just ask one more thing.
[time=1063] We would certainly appreciate your prayers in these months of transition for us as we begin the process of letting go of the ministry God's called us to for 11 years and begin the process of saying goodbye there.
[time=1075] And then the transitioning here, we've begun to meet some of the teachers and look forward to doing that even on in January.
[time=1081] Of course, meeting the students.
[time=1082] We can't wait to get to know the students.
[time=1084] And so pray for us.
[time=1086] We sincerely want and need your prayers.
[time=1088] So we ask you to do that this morning.
[time=1090] And I'm going to do that right now.
[time=1092] Let's pray.
[time=1095] Our Father in Heaven, you are God.
[time=1098] And we are not.
[time=1100] We are your servants.
[time=1102] And God, I know Sam's your servant.
[time=1104] And he's proven that as he's been the husband that he's supposed to be and the dad that he's supposed to be.
[time=1111] And then the Christian school administrator.
[time=1114] And I pray, Lord, that you would please empower him by your spirit to do things your way in our school, in your school.
[time=1122] And I pray that he would be blessed and you would guard his home.
[time=1126] You'd protect them from evil.
[time=1128] You would please guard their hearts and their minds in Christ Jesus.
[time=1131] And his name I pray.
[time=1132] [AMEN - 2 seconds] Good to have you here.
[time=1139] Thanks.
[time=1142] Well, good morning.
[time=1144] It's great to have you here.
[time=1145] We are, as most of you know, a visit you may be visiting for the first time, and if you are, you're coming in on the, you are getting off the stage.
[time=1153] All right.
[time=1154] He knows what's coming.
[time=1155] We're going to go back through the hand motions from last week.
[time=1157] How's that sound?
[time=1159] We have started a series on Heaven.
[time=1161] And if you were with us last week, you know, that we just tried to kind of do it in a creative way to kind of get our minds and our hearts thinking about a sequence of events that God's word says will happen.
[time=1171] Kind of starting with this question that many of us, all of us, have probably asked, you know, what happens to me when I die.
[time=1177] And then after that, what happens to this place and to, you know, how do we get to this thing called eternity in forever?
[time=1184] So last week, we kind of put some hand motions to that.
[time=1187] If you're new visiting, you're not going to know what in the world we're doing, but you'll catch on as we go.
[time=1191] So everybody stand up.
[time=1192] We're going to go back through.
[time=1194] I know there have been some folks practicing, and we want to make sure we get through this one more time.
[time=1199] Okay.
[time=1200] What we said last week was this.
[time=1201] All right.
[time=1202] You limber up a little bit.
[time=1203] You're ready, stretch out.
[time=1204] Don't hit anybody.
[time=1205] All right.
[time=1206] Last week, we said that in response to the question, what happens when I die?
[time=1210] We've got body and soul, body and soul separate, body to the ground.
[time=1216] You can say, you can speak up.
[time=1217] You can just get really loud here.
[time=1219] Start over again.
[time=1220] Body and soul separate, body to the soul into the presence of the Lord, right?
[time=1226] Remember that?
[time=1227] Soul into the presence of the Lord.
[time=1228] All right.
[time=1229] Start over.
[time=1230] Point of death.
[time=1231] Body and soul separate, body to the ground.
[time=1233] Soul into the presence of the Lord.
[time=1235] It stays there in the presence of the Lord until the second coming.
[time=1239] Whoa.
[time=1240] Now you guys are slow.
[time=1241] Remember the second coming thing?
[time=1243] The trumpet of God, it says it's going to sound.
[time=1246] There's going to be a mighty shout, and it's a trumpet, and it's a shout that's heard all over the world.
[time=1252] So it's really, really what?
[time=1254] Loud.
[time=1255] So we go, whoa.
[time=1256] Right?
[time=1257] So here we go.
[time=1258] Body and soul separate, body to the ground.
[time=1260] Soul into the presence of the Lord.
[time=1262] It stays in the presence of the Lord until the second coming.
[time=1266] Whoa.
[time=1267] There you go.
[time=1268] At which point, stay there.
[time=1270] At which point, body and soul are reunited and taken to be with
[time=1276] Him.
[time=1277] Great job.
[time=1278] Reunited and taken to be with Him.
[time=1280] Okay.
[time=1281] Reunited and taken to be with Him.
[time=1284] Then come seven years.
[time=1285] Everybody put up seven.
[time=1287] Seven years, or three and a half, however you want.
[time=1290] Oh, never mind.
[time=1292] It's a theological joke.
[time=1294] Everybody put up seven.
[time=1296] Seven years of, oh, cover up pain.
[time=1298] Seven years of pain.
[time=1299] Say pain.
[time=1300] All right.
[time=1301] Start over.
[time=1302] Seven years of.
[time=1303] Followed by a thousand year.
[time=1306] Grab your scepter, a thousand year.
[time=1308] Rain.
[time=1309] He comes back and he takes the throne in four thousand years.
[time=1312] He rains the earth.
[time=1313] It's called the Millennial Kingdom, right?
[time=1316] And at the end of that Millennial Kingdom during that thousand year rain, the scriptures say that Satan is held captive.
[time=1323] At the end of that thousand year rain, it says that remember this?
[time=1326] Satan is released.
[time=1328] Go ahead and crouch down, open that gate and out goes that little conniving dude, but not for long because it says Satan is released and then Satan is condemned.
[time=1339] Great job.
[time=1341] Satan's condemned.
[time=1343] It's a sad picture because that's where all the unbelieving folks are judged, dead and alive, are judged as well.
[time=1351] And they are condemned and judged to an eternal separation from God, a place called hell.
[time=1357] And then on the other side of that picture is where this begins.
[time=1360] Remember this?
[time=1361] Forever.
[time=1363] Can you do it all without stopping?
[time=1366] Do you think so?
[time=1368] All right.
[time=1369] I want to hear you.
[time=1370] Here we go.
[time=1371] The soul separates.
[time=1373] Body to the ground, soul, and to the presence of the Lord.
[time=1376] It stays there until the second coming.
[time=1378] Whoa.
[time=1379] Where Christ comes, our soul and body are reunited and taken to be with him.
[time=1385] Then come seven years of, followed by a thousand year rain, at the end of which Satan is released, then condemned.
[time=1395] Thus beginning a thing called forever.
[time=1398] Wow.
[time=1399] Give yourselves a hand.
[time=1400] All right.
[time=1401] Have a seat.
[time=1402] No notes right from the top of the head.
[time=1408] Hey, this morning, we're going to continue in our discussion and in our look to the Scriptures on this topic of heaven.
[time=1417] And we know that it generates any time you talk about heaven, any time you talk about forever, it just generates a whole bunch of questions, gazillion questions start coming.
[time=1427] And you know what, the fact of the matter is God's word doesn't answer all of them.
[time=1433] God's word lets us just, it lets us see some things.
[time=1437] It kind of paints a picture here.
[time=1438] It kind of gives some truth here.
[time=1440] But all the questions that you can come up with and all the questions that I sometimes roll through my own mind.
[time=1445] You know what?
[time=1446] A lot of those we just are going to have to kind of wait and see.
[time=1449] But this morning we thought we'd do this.
[time=1450] We're going to take a few minutes and we're going to just take up just several.
[time=1454] Not a lot.
[time=1455] Just a few questions.
[time=1456] Questions that are often asked.
[time=1459] And we tried to kind of bring a wide variety to just five.
[time=1464] But anyway, these are questions that you oftentimes hear.
[time=1466] These are things you oftentimes wonder.
[time=1468] And we're going to just kind of quickly go through those, give you some reference points to look at and to write down.
[time=1474] And hopefully the discussion will help.
[time=1476] Following that we're going to move into kind of a different segment of our time.
[time=1479] I think actually a much more important part of our time this morning.
[time=1483] But let's begin with some questions.
[time=1485] Steve, take it away.
[time=1486] Question number one is will we all be wearing white robes sitting on white puffy clouds and playing harps?
[time=1492] I hope not.
[time=1496] I've heard some harpists that are good, but there are a lot of them that are really not that good.
[time=1501] You know what?
[time=1502] The Bible doesn't give us all the answers about what we're going to do in heaven and where we're going to be and all those things.
[time=1507] But there are some glimpses that we get to look at.
[time=1510] And in Revelation chapter 21 it says, "I did not see a temple in the city because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple.
[time=1519] The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it.
[time=1522] For the glory of God gives it light and the lamb is its lamp.
[time=1526] The nations will walk by its light and the kings of the earth will bring their splendor into it." Get that?
[time=1533] Nations and kings.
[time=1535] "On no day will its gates ever be shut and there will be no night there.
[time=1540] The glory and honor of the nations will be brought into it.
[time=1545] Nothing impure will ever enter it nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life.
[time=1557] If you are a person who has trusted Christ as your Savior, he has written your name in the Lamb's book of life and you'll be one of those people.
[time=1568] And it refers to them.
[time=1570] Did you notice that as kings and nations?
[time=1572] Now this is after New Heaven and New Earth will get into that in a minute.
[time=1576] This New Jerusalem is a place we're talking about doesn't need a temple, but it is a city.
[time=1579] It's a real place.
[time=1580] There are some scholars around the world that would treat all of Revelation as symbolic.
[time=1586] I don't buy that.
[time=1587] I really believe with all my heart this is a real place where we are going to exist.
[time=1592] We're going to go in and out of that city, not sitting on a cloud in some white deal.
[time=1598] We're going to go in and out of that city and kings and nations will exist.
[time=1602] I don't know what that means, but it sure doesn't sound like a harp and a circle around my head and a robe and a cloud.
[time=1609] It seems as if as you study the Scriptures, especially the book of Revelation, which can be confusing, I admit, for some, but I tell you what, it certainly does indicate that there's going to be some purpose, some order, some things happening in this new and wonderful place that seem to go beyond puffy clouds, robes, and harps.
[time=1629] So question number two, one that we have often, I've asked it a bunch of times, will we recognize each other in heaven?
[time=1637] You ever wondered that?
[time=1638] You ever asked that question?
[time=1639] Yeah, a bunch of us had.
[time=1640] Well, we recognize each other in heaven.
[time=1643] And I want to just stand here today and tell you I've searched the Scriptures.
[time=1647] I've thought this thing through to the best of my knowledge.
[time=1649] As I look at the truth, I really believe that we will.
[time=1653] I really believe that we will be recognizable to each other.
[time=1657] And I could take you several places.
[time=1659] We could talk about Luke 16, where the rich man and Lazarus were the same here on earth.
[time=1664] And then the picture of them we see in heaven, we could go to the transfiguration where Peter, James, and John saw and recognized Moses and Elijah.
[time=1671] But you know what?
[time=1672] I want to just take you to one person and one example.
[time=1675] And it's the best one, I think, for you to hold on to as we consider this question.
[time=1679] And that is what took place with our Lord.
[time=1682] What took place with Jesus as he came and died and rose again?
[time=1687] That's a great picture right there.
[time=1689] I think what goes on with this whole recognizable thing.
[time=1692] Go to Matthew 28.
[time=1694] Write that down.
[time=1695] Matthew 28 verses 8 and 9, it says, and they departed quickly.
[time=1698] These are the folks who had come to the tomb, right?
[time=1701] They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy and ran to report it to his disciples.
[time=1706] And behold, Jesus met them and greeted them.
[time=1711] And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him.
[time=1715] I believe they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him because they, what?
[time=1721] Recognized him.
[time=1723] Just write it down.
[time=1724] Remember the tomb was empty.
[time=1727] His body, his earthly body gone.
[time=1729] His earthly body gone, now glorified.
[time=1732] I believe this, your resurrection body.
[time=1735] I believe, and I think God's word teaches clearly, is your earthly body glorified.
[time=1742] Remember, as he had those different encounters with his family and friends there after the resurrection, it says that they could see the what in his hand, the wounds.
[time=1753] Remember?
[time=1754] They could see where the nails had gone.
[time=1756] They could see where the spear had been thrust.
[time=1758] Remember?
[time=1759] It was his body.
[time=1761] It just glorified.
[time=1762] It was the same body now that could go through walls and that could all of a sudden appear on a road to Emmaus.
[time=1768] Remember that?
[time=1769] So I think there's something there.
[time=1771] I think the example, and isn't it always the case?
[time=1773] Jesus is our example in this, I think, as well.
[time=1776] Our resurrection bodies, I believe, are our earthly bodies.
[time=1780] Now, I don't know what kind of condition our earthly body, our resurrection bodies are going to be in.
[time=1786] We'll just figure that out when we get there.
[time=1788] But it'll all be good.
[time=1789] It'll all be extremely exciting.
[time=1792] And there'll be so many other things on our minds.
[time=1795] I don't think we'll be worrying about what we look like.
[time=1798] It'll all be just fine, but we will recognize each other.
[time=1801] I believe that.
[time=1803] Will all of this, meaning all the physical attributes of the world and everything that exists, will all of this be destroyed by God in the end?
[time=1813] Yes.
[time=1814] It will.
[time=1815] That's not bad news.
[time=1817] That's good.
[time=1818] This whole earth and everything in it is in a slow deterioration, you know?
[time=1824] Sin brought about something God didn't intend.
[time=1827] And it needs to be destroyed.
[time=1830] Let's look at 2 Peter, chapter 3.
[time=1833] It says, "But the day of the Lord will come like a thief." Verse 10, "The heavens will disappear with a roar.
[time=1839] The elements will be destroyed by fire.
[time=1841] And the earth and everything in it will be laid bare." Now we give you that verse first.
[time=1848] Let's look at it in context in chapter 3 of 2 Peter, starting with verse 6.
[time=1854] By these waters also, the world of that time was deluged and destroyed, the flood.
[time=1860] Okay?
[time=1861] By the same word, the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.
[time=1869] But do not forget this one thing, dear friends.
[time=1872] With the Lord, a day is like a thousand years and a thousand years are like a day.
[time=1877] The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise as some understand slowness.
[time=1881] He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.
[time=1887] But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, the verse we read.
[time=1890] The heavens will disappear with a roar.
[time=1892] The elements will be destroyed by fire and the earth.
[time=1895] And everything in it will be laid bare.
[time=1897] Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be?
[time=1902] You ought to live wholly in godly lives, Peter says.
[time=1904] As you look forward to the day of god and speed its coming.
[time=1908] That day will bring about the destruction of the heavens by fire and the elements will melt in the heat.
[time=1915] But in keeping with his promise, we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth, the home of righteousness.
[time=1922] It's going to burn up.
[time=1926] It's going to be destroyed.
[time=1928] The very Christ that spoke it into existence in the beginning.
[time=1931] He was the Creator.
[time=1934] The Word of God spoke everything into existence.
[time=1938] In Colossians 1, it says, "He is the image." Jesus.
[time=1942] He is the image of the invisible God, the first born overall creation.
[time=1946] For by Him all things were created.
[time=1949] Things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible.
[time=1952] Whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities.
[time=1955] All things were created by Him and for Him.
[time=1958] He is before all things and get this.
[time=1961] And in Him all things hold together.
[time=1966] If He doesn't hold them together anymore, whether it implodes or explodes, but I know it's gone.
[time=1971] It's going to burn up.
[time=1973] Scientists, when they describe how things hold together, they always come to a point where they say we don't quite get it.
[time=1979] The electrons are going exactly the right speed, exactly the right distance around that nucleus of that atom that has the positive protons in there, keeping it all together.
[time=1987] And that's happening in the macrocosm as well with our solar system.
[time=1990] And they know that's all happening, but why it really stays together.
[time=1993] They always come to this point.
[time=1994] They say, "Well, it's the strong force." That's how they define it.
[time=1998] I know Him.
[time=2002] He's holding it all together.
[time=2004] And when He doesn't anymore, it's all going to burn up.
[time=2008] It's His plan.
[time=2010] Yeah.
[time=2011] That's amazing.
[time=2013] You ever seen it that way?
[time=2014] You ever thought of it that way?
[time=2016] He just takes His hand off it.
[time=2018] And it all goes.
[time=2020] And it brings, I think, from me new meaning to that verse you just read, that He's patient.
[time=2026] He's just holding onto it.
[time=2028] And He wishes that all would come to faith.
[time=2031] But there will be a day when He'll just let it go.
[time=2035] Wow.
[time=2037] Well, from the incredibly profound to the somewhat mundane,
[time=2043] but you know what, it gets asked.
[time=2045] And there's little ears and little lives that need to, I think, get a good answer.
[time=2049] Will there be animals in heaven?
[time=2052] You know, they want to know if phyto and spot are going to be there.
[time=2056] And I just think it's really important.
[time=2059] I don't think, I don't believe that there's anything in here in the Scriptures that would indicate that your pets are going to be in heaven.
[time=2067] It talks about heavenly creatures.
[time=2073] That phrase is used.
[time=2075] And I suppose some might want to find hope in that.
[time=2078] But I think the whole thing we've got to teach our kids is that heaven is about, it's not about bodies and extents, about souls.
[time=2086] It's about the spirit of man and what God does there.
[time=2090] And they need to understand, and that's tough, they won't for a while.
[time=2093] But I think we just need to do our best to really play up the unbelievable and the incredibleness of glory and how though we here today might think we'll miss spot.
[time=2106] We really won't.
[time=2107] But I don't see anything in here.
[time=2109] Now he may surprise us, you know, I don't know.
[time=2112] Our old cat, Christine, may be there, I hope not.
[time=2116] But it could happen.
[time=2119] You just never know what he might do.
[time=2122] But I don't think there's anything in here that would indicate that the pets end up in glory.
[time=2129] The next question is, the New Jerusalem, the city.
[time=2134] That is described in detail in Revelation the same as the new earth.
[time=2137] What is the new heaven and the new earth?
[time=2140] Well the New Jerusalem is not the same as the new earth and it's not the same as the new heaven.
[time=2147] The New Jerusalem in Revelation chapter 21 is described for us.
[time=2151] Because then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, verse 1, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away.
[time=2157] We saw that a little bit ago and there was no longer any sea.
[time=2160] Get that, we'll go back to it.
[time=2162] I saw the holy city, the New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.
[time=2166] Prepared as a bride, beautifully dressed for her husband.
[time=2170] And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, "Now the dwelling of God is with men and he will live with them."
[time=2179] They will be his people and God himself will be with them and be their God.
[time=2186] He will wipe away every tear from their eyes.
[time=2189] There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain for the old order of things has passed away.
[time=2196] The old order is gone.
[time=2199] There's a new order because he destroys all of the old order, the way things operated then.
[time=2205] It's going to be new, it's going to be different.
[time=2208] Maybe it won't be gravity.
[time=2210] I've thought about that one.
[time=2212] Maybe I can cruise myself.
[time=2216] Well, the New Jerusalem is a city that is going to be dwelt in
[time=2223] by God himself and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2226] It's going to come down from the new heaven.
[time=2228] When the new heaven and the new earth get created, I don't know whether the earth's round or what, doesn't say, but it does say there's no sea on it.
[time=2236] That's going to be totally different.
[time=2237] That's one of the reasons that I don't own agree.
[time=2239] Some scholars say that this is just talking about the new millennium, the thousand year rain.
[time=2244] I don't buy that because this is an earth that has no sea on it.
[time=2248] This is a new place.
[time=2250] This New Jerusalem is a city that has walls 1,400 miles long, 1,400 miles wide and 1,400 miles high.
[time=2259] It's a cube.
[time=2260] How many square miles did you say it was?
[time=2262] Over 2 million.
[time=2263] Over 2 million square miles.
[time=2264] That's a mathematical mind, just kind of figured that out.
[time=2267] Just like that.
[time=2268] So we have this, and it goes from the east coast of the United States, just picture this, from the east coast all the way up there in New England, past St. Louis.
[time=2279] That's how high it is.
[time=2281] And wide.
[time=2282] And wide and long.
[time=2283] And long.
[time=2284] It's a cube like that.
[time=2285] Wow.
[time=2286] And so that's a city that John sees coming down out of heaven from the new heaven, God's got it there, coming down to the new earth, and it sets down on the new earth.
[time=2296] And then we're going to be on there.
[time=2298] Wow.
[time=2299] Incredible.
[time=2300] Going in and out of that New Jerusalem.
[time=2303] That's what that said.
[time=2304] Kings and nations going in and out.
[time=2306] Read Revelation 21 and get the description of that city.
[time=2309] That's incredible.
[time=2310] Now the whole earth's probably not going to be paved with gold.
[time=2312] That city's going to be paved with gold for sure.
[time=2314] Look at it.
[time=2315] Incredible description.
[time=2316] The whole earth's going to be a golf course.
[time=2318] You know that and I know that.
[time=2319] Without any water hazard.
[time=2321] No.
[time=2324] No sea.
[time=2325] Yeah.
[time=2326] So at least we know the guys that like sailing aren't going to be happy.
[time=2329] Oh boy.
[time=2330] Wow.
[time=2331] That's an incredible thought.
[time=2332] You know what I was struck by just the other day was that God is in heaven as are the believing dead right now.
[time=2342] But there's going to be a new what?
[time=2344] A new heaven.
[time=2346] So it's like it just boggles my mind.
[time=2349] There's a heaven now but there's going to be a new heaven.
[time=2351] So the heaven God's in now.
[time=2352] He's not going to be in later.
[time=2353] That's going to go away.
[time=2354] And he's going to come while in this new.
[time=2355] It's an amazing, amazing thought.
[time=2357] Well you know what?
[time=2358] Let me shift right here.
[time=2359] And let me get to something that I believe really matters.
[time=2363] I mean really, really matters.
[time=2365] You know we can ask questions all day long.
[time=2367] There's a gazillion.
[time=2368] Remember?
[time=2369] And we can't even answer most of them.
[time=2371] This concept and this truth.
[time=2373] It is very confusing.
[time=2374] And for so much of it we're going to just have to wait.
[time=2377] But while we wait, it is so very important I think in light of what we looked at last week.
[time=2385] You know how we get so confused and we get so misdirected sometimes here.
[time=2389] We get so attached to this place that we forget to live today with that wonderful picture
[time=2397] and hope of eternity in mind.
[time=2400] And I want to just encourage you today.
[time=2402] I want us to be as a family reminded of how very important it is that we live moment by moment,
[time=2408] minute by minute.
[time=2411] Terminally ill.
[time=2413] Remember?
[time=2414] Last week?
[time=2416] Living with the reality that this body and this life, we're dying.
[time=2421] This is not our home.
[time=2423] We are literally just passing through.
[time=2426] And there is a calling that God has placed on us to live today with real purpose and with real truth in mind.
[time=2436] And this guy right here, my good friend, about seven years ago, went through something that I know forever changed him and his family.
[time=2448] And it forever changed us, many of us who watched him go through it.
[time=2453] And as Steve watched, his wife Renee die of cancer.
[time=2458] There were so many of us who saw in her and in him this living day by day with heaven, with eternity in view.
[time=2470] And I just asked Steve if he would just share with us from his heart what it was like going through that.
[time=2477] What kind of perspective God brought, what he learned coming away from that experience and what he would want you to know and what he would want me to know.
[time=2486] As one who has faced that, seen that and gone through that.
[time=2490] So Steve, share your story if you would.
[time=2493] Well, I was just noticing I was sitting there wanting to smile and I'm sitting there thinking they're going to think I'm happy.
[time=2499] It's not happy at all, but I'll tell you the truth.
[time=2502] When heaven becomes faces instead of a place, God told me face instead of place, when heaven becomes faces.
[time=2511] And the more faces are there from a human perspective, the more you start to get a handle on the significance of it being real and forever.
[time=2525] And I'm sitting here smiling because as he talks about it, I've been for the last seven years increasingly smiling about her passing.
[time=2535] Not because I'm glad because I still miss her.
[time=2537] As a matter of fact, you know what the truth is?
[time=2539] I miss her more now than I did the first year just to be able to talk to her and get grief.
[time=2546] Now, for those of you that are nervous, Nancy's okay with this.
[time=2549] She's over here and we've talked this all through and she knows without a doubt that she is my wife and that I love her with all my heart.
[time=2560] And Renee was elevated into heaven and I've got a relationship with her that's real.
[time=2566] It's just she's not my wife and it's kind of strange.
[time=2569] The Bible says there aren't marriages in heaven, so Nancy and I aren't going to be married there either.
[time=2574] But I think moms and dads are still going to be something. I got to have my dad.
[time=2579] So I'm glad he didn't say that. Steph, you better look me up.
[time=2583] But you know what? God took me through. It took us through.
[time=2588] Stephanie included Josh, Renee and many, many other people.
[time=2592] And I'll just tell you, my story is different from everybody else's and everybody else's is different from mine.
[time=2597] And God uses different circumstances to bring people along, but I can share you a snippet here of what it was like for us to go through knowing that we were transitioning from one life to the next.
[time=2611] My kids get tired of hearing me talk about seasons of life, but I've always done that.
[time=2617] And it was a season for Renee and I to go through together as she was ill and sick and the kids watched that.
[time=2626] We had to tell them about that and all the things that you go to when you hear the next report and the next report and the next report and they keep telling you, we think it's going to be better, but it doesn't get better, gets worse.
[time=2635] And so you wonder, man, God, what in the world are you doing? But I'll tell you this, watching her trust him for what he was doing.
[time=2643] Oh man, I wouldn't trade that for anything.
[time=2646] Watching her trust him. She wasn't trusting me. She wasn't trusting. I think Marv was the first one she saw.
[time=2653] Her trust wasn't in Marv or the other physicians. Her trust was in him.
[time=2658] And I grew to understand that too. And so you move through, we had a year.
[time=2663] You move through a year like that that you do incredible things together. And I'll tell you, that was a rich year.
[time=2668] We crammed a lot of marriage into that year. A lot of conversation and a lot of intimacy.
[time=2673] And I wouldn't trade that. It was absolutely magnificent.
[time=2677] And God saw fit to then take her to be with Him.
[time=2683] Going through the illness was one thing. And I'll tell you the truth. I never, ever felt like we were in this dying process.
[time=2691] She didn't feel like that either. Even when we went to the hospital that last week, we didn't think she was going there to die.
[time=2701] I didn't think that. Now, I'm sure a lot of people in the medical community knew that, but I didn't feel that way.
[time=2708] And that night that we, her last night, we'd had, like I said, lots of times holding each other and talking and going through discussion about me,
[time=2720] single parenting the kids. I mean, that scared her to death.
[time=2725] And they really did get tired of stir fry. I went nuts on the stir fry for two years there.
[time=2729] The frozen ones, you know, you can buy those and they're just always ready.
[time=2733] I do the other. The healthy went about once a week, but at least once a week we had that bag, didn't we, Steph?
[time=2739] She was worried about that stuff. We'd talk about all that stuff. But she wasn't scared.
[time=2746] And she wasn't fearful. And even that last night in the hospital, it was incredible, the peace that she was having.
[time=2756] She was really hot, hard to breathe. And she was lying in that bed. And I was fanning her with a pillow.
[time=2764] And I did that. I don't know how many hours I did that with that pillow.
[time=2767] And I believe he gave me some supernatural strength. I'm not kidding you. I don't know how you can do that that long, but I was able to.
[time=2773] And it was okay. But every once in a while, a nurse would come in and she'd fan her while I went down the hall.
[time=2780] And I went down to be with a couple of my buddies that were there, and the nurse came running out.
[time=2784] She said, "Hey, come back quick." So I ran down there. Sure enough, it was obvious that Renee was really physically breathing her last breaths.
[time=2794] And I jumped up there in bed, and I rapped arms around her, and I'm whispering in her ear, and I can hear her.
[time=2800] Every exhale were these mumbles that I couldn't make out.
[time=2805] And I'd hear, and I'd just get my ear up there, I'm thinking, "Is she trying to talk to me? What's going on?"
[time=2812] And I finally heard my kids' names, and I'm thinking, "Oh my goodness, she's even praying now."
[time=2820] And I believe it was. What an incredible thing to be praying for other people when you're dying.
[time=2828] And I'm lying there, and she's fighting, and fighting, and fighting.
[time=2833] Finally, I just said, "Nay, just go on, just go be with him." And it didn't happen like that, but pretty soon.
[time=2841] She either was about ready to breathe her last or whatever, but I'm not kidding you guys.
[time=2846] I had this sense that if I could just jump up out of that bed and run fast, if I knew which direction to go,
[time=2857] I felt like I could catch her.
[time=2860] I never once felt like it's over, and I think maybe God's done that for me.
[time=2866] And that's not true for everybody. Some people have felt awful loneliness and pain feeling like it's so permanent,
[time=2874] but I've never had that permanent feeling as far as never being with her again.
[time=2879] But I'm not kidding you. There was an urgency, but I just didn't know whether to go up, down, over, out.
[time=2884] I didn't know which way to run. So as fast as I jumped up thinking, if I could just, then I thought, man, I don't know where to go. It's just like, no, I'm stuck here still, because I am.
[time=2896] I'm stuck here. And so are you.
[time=2902] Nance had a brother that died when he was 36, Nance.
[time=2907] My dad died. We've had kids from the school, lots of my friends here, all kinds of people.
[time=2913] Nancy's dad died when she was in the womb.
[time=2916] We're really hopeful that he's in heaven there and that he knows my dad, and we don't know what's going on there.
[time=2921] We talk about that kind of stuff all the time.
[time=2923] But I know it's in the present. And one of those times that I had recently that was in the present that just grabbed me,
[time=2929] I was driving down Maysville Road.
[time=2931] Renee's body's buried over there. And I look over there where her body's buried.
[time=2936] When I drive by and I've stopped periodically and go in there, I've looked over there and I said,
[time=2942] I love you, Nae. I said it out loud.
[time=2947] And man, it just came over me like I said that in the present.
[time=2954] And you know what? I do love her. Now, again, let me tell you, she's not my wife.
[time=2960] I love my wife differently than that.
[time=2964] But to say that in the present made me just start crying because I realized I really believe.
[time=2972] It just struck me. I really, truly believe that she's alive.
[time=2978] And man, oh man, that was so comforting. Still is right now this minute.
[time=2985] She's alive, but I'm still here.
[time=2990] She's there and we are here. And what God expects for me, I really believe.
[time=2995] If I really understand what I'm starting to get a glimpse and understand about heaven,
[time=3001] then it causes me to live differently on this earth.
[time=3005] It causes me to move with real purpose to be intentional about making sure that my eternal thinking
[time=3015] impacts my present life on this earth, on this plane.
[time=3019] You know what? People gave me all kinds of books.
[time=3022] And I believe that stuff can really help a lot of people.
[time=3025] I read a lot of them. And for some of you, I really understand you got angry.
[time=3030] You went through the denial stuff, all that. And there's nothing wrong with any of that.
[time=3034] Moving through it, getting through it, being done with that is important.
[time=3038] But I understand that. But for me, I never had the anger part.
[time=3041] I think Steph and Josh had more of the anger part. I think my mom did, but I didn't have the anger part.
[time=3048] I don't know why. And I didn't have the anger part, so people said I was in denial.
[time=3054] And then I didn't think I had the denial part, but then they said, "Man, he's really in denial."
[time=3061] But the truth is, I think if you cling to this, and the more this is real in your life, and the more he fills you up, the more you'll be sad, but not angry.
[time=3071] Grieve, but not like those who have no hope.
[time=3074] We grieve in more and differently. And it causes me to live differently.
[time=3079] And I want you to live differently too.
[time=3083] [AMEN] (Applause)
[time=3092] Thanks.
[time=3094] Boy, let me just invite you to do this, if you would.
[time=3096] If you'd just stand, stay with us here. Stand up.
[time=3099] And as the lights fade, we're just going to listen to a song.
[time=3103] It's a song that all of us have heard a lot.
[time=3106] We just recently, though, kind of came across some new pictures, some new clips.
[time=3112] And so as the lights fade and they roll the shots, just be encouraged, be amazed, all over again.
[time=3120] What a wonderful thing it is that we, as believers, have the privilege of looking forward to.
[time=3127] We hope it encourages your heart.
[time=3130] (Music)
[time=3141] I can only imagine what it will be like when I walk.
[time=3150] And by your side, I can only imagine what my eyes will see.
[time=3159] And when your face is before me, I can only imagine.
[time=3171] Yeah.
[time=3178] Surrounded by your glory, what will my heart feel?
[time=3183] Will I dance for you, Jesus, or in all of you?
[time=3188] Be still.
[time=3189] Will I stand in your presence, or to my knees when I fall?
[time=3195] Will I sing hallelujah?
[time=3198] Will I be able to speak at all?
[time=3201] I can only imagine.
[time=3213] I can only imagine what that day comes.
[time=3219] And I find myself standing in the sun.
[time=3225] I can only imagine.
[time=3228] When all I do is forever, forever worship you.
[time=3237] I can only imagine.
[time=3250] Surrounded by your glory, what will my heart feel?
[time=3255] Will I dance for you, Jesus, or in all of you?
[time=3260] Be still.
[time=3261] Will I stand in your presence, or to my knees when I fall?
[time=3267] Will I sing hallelujah?
[time=3270] Will I be able to speak at all?
[time=3273] I can only imagine.
[time=3285] Surrounded by your glory, what will my heart feel?
[time=3291] Will I dance for you, Jesus, or in all of you?
[time=3296] Be still.
[time=3297] Will I stand in your presence, or to my knees when I fall?
[time=3303] Will I sing hallelujah?
[time=3306] Will I be able to speak at all?
[time=3309] I can only imagine.
[time=3312] Yeah.
[time=3314] I can only imagine.
[time=3324] Yeah.
[time=3326] I can only imagine.
[time=3351] When all I do is forever, forever worship you.
[time=3366] I can only imagine.
[time=3373] Why don't you bow your heads and in the spirit of the song, you can bend a knee, you can
[time=3384] raise a hand, you can bow a head.
[time=3387] Either way, let's just be in his presence here for a moment and lift these prayers up to him.
[time=3397] Father, we come before you this morning and to hear the story again of one who loved you so much and loved life as well.
[time=3412] And we know that Renee's transition, her passing on into your presence and eternal glory, the wonderful and incredible.
[time=3426] And its scope, we know many of us because we watched her and her family go through it and we see so many others go through it.
[time=3436] We know that it is painful, that there is a sense of loss that comes and there is a struggle, as Steve said, to varying degrees but nonetheless, hearts ache.
[time=3448] And this morning we're reminded of our finiteness, God Heaven, in some ways, has come a lot closer today.
[time=3457] And in other ways, God, we remain confused.
[time=3461] Yet in the midst of both emotions and the midst of feelings that sometimes are scattered, God, we believe that as we heard last week that you are a God, you're the same God who knit us in our mother's womb.
[time=3474] You're the same God that in Colossians, as Steve quoted today, you're the sustainer and creator and holder of all things.
[time=3481] And you being that kind of God, we know that you have got eternity figured out.
[time=3487] And it will be just what it's supposed to be.
[time=3490] And God, we pray that you would give us strength in the meantime.
[time=3494] That you would give each of us courage, God to live lives that are completely given to you.
[time=3501] Surrendered holy, not kind of and not sort of, but completely and fully surrendered to you, living life with an eternal perspective.
[time=3510] Longing for that day when we can give up the fight and be with you, longing for that day when others who have gone before us will be reunited with.
[time=3522] God, give us strength these days to point others toward Heaven.
[time=3526] And we'll thank you for it. In your son's name we pray. Amen.
