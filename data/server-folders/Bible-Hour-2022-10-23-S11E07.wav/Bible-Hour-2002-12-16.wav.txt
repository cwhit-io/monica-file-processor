[time=0] [MUSIC - 250 seconds]
[time=258] In the book of Revelation at the end, John's writing and he's just seen an awesome vision of heaven and he sees what eternity is going to be like.
[time=270] He gets that glimpse that God gave him that he can share with us and the only thing he has to say at the end is, "Lord, please come quickly."
[time=278] John wasn't living for himself. He wasn't living in the moment. He wasn't living for the present, but he was living for the future and living for eternity.
[time=286] And living for that moment when heaven could happen, whether it be death or whether it be the second coming of Christ, he was eagerly awaiting that.
[time=296] And that's something that I've been learning recently that I don't eagerly await the future. I don't eagerly await eternity, but that's something I want to do.
[time=308] And this song come quickly by Tommy Walker. It means a ton to me because it says, "Come quickly. Don't wait anymore. This world is not my home. Come quickly."
[time=320] So make this your prayer today that he would come quickly and that he would reign and bring us to be a part of his reign in heaven.
[time=330] [MUSIC - 352 seconds]
[time=690] Heavenly Father, you are so holy. You are so worthy of our praise and that's what we want to give you today. Amen.
[time=698] Hi, I'm Kelly, Senior Pastor here at Blackhawk. And I want you to know that in the day-to-day of my life, people ask me questions all the time.
[time=708] People want to ask questions about their kids. People want to ask questions about marriage. People want to ask questions about the Bible and what it says.
[time=716] But you know what? By far, the most asked question I ever run into is people wanting to know how it is in the end that they can be sure
[time=728] they're going to heaven. How do you get to heaven? And what you're about to see is some time that we spent together here in this room answering that very question,
[time=738] giving attention to what God's word says about that very issue. And so I hope that as you watch that your heart will be open. I hope that you'll be encouraged.
[time=748] Maybe reminded of some truth, but possibly for the first time, maybe you'll understand and see what it takes, what it is that God requires for one to come and spend eternity with him.
[time=760] If you have any questions at all, we hope that you know we're always available to you. Call us, email us, come by and see us.
[time=768] We'd love to help you be sure in your heart that you understand what it takes for one to spend eternity in heaven with God. Thanks.
[time=778] Hey, so you got sent to the salivator too, huh? Yep, he said this is a one for me.
[time=784] You've been waiting here long? No, I just got here.
[time=788] You're that? I think it's here.
[time=792] Boy, I sure hope this thing is going up. Oh, definitely. Definitely going up. Gotta be going up.
[time=808] So, uh, how did it, uh, happen for you?
[time=814] Oh, you mean cancer? Long, slow, and painful.
[time=820] It's too bad. You?
[time=824] You know, it happened so fast I hardly knew what hit me. I was skiing in the Alps. It was incredible.
[time=830] I remember falling from a chairlift and I heard someone say something about head injury, then all of a sudden I was here.
[time=836] Ouch. Tough break. That had to hurt.
[time=840] Yeah. Well, at least you were having a good time before you went. Me? I had just slammed the door in my ex.
[time=846] Another huge fight about money in the kids. I just couldn't take it anymore. I went straight for the medicine cab.
[time=854] Well, at least it's over now. But I sure showed him, didn't I, huh? Now I'll have to do his fair share, won't he, huh?
[time=862] Uh-oh. What's the matter? This elevator only goes one direction.
[time=868] Yeah, so? The way I had it figured out, it was definitely going up. I mean, I'm a really good man, and you seem to be a decent guy, but...
[time=880] Well, her. Hey, the names Angelica, Maria, Calamino, buddy.
[time=886] Okay, okay. Well, hey, no offense, Angie, but you just don't seem like the heaven-bound type.
[time=892] Well, what's that supposed to mean, huh? Do you think you're better than me, huh?
[time=898] Men, you were all alike.
[time=900] Now, hold on there a minute. I'm a good guy like Cliff. Yeah, like Cliff here. Yeah, we're good guys. Not all men are losers like your ex was.
[time=908] Yeah, I was faithful to my wife and kids. I went to work every day.
[time=912] I paid my mortgage on time every month. I gave money to Greenpeace.
[time=918] I only watched PBS. I only read the Wall Street Journal. And I never drank or smoked. I never killed anybody.
[time=926] I was always the designated driver. I bought Girl Scout cookies every year. I went to church every Sunday.
[time=934] That's it. That's the ticket. I went to church too. Like clockwork. Every Christmas and Easter, I was there.
[time=942] God knows I wouldn't miss that for anything. Well, I did miss once for the company golf outing, but I'm sure he understands.
[time=950] That is the ticket we are in. We're in. We're definitely going up.
[time=956] Wait a second. What I hear you saying is if this thing only goes in one direction and it's going up, then I'm in two.
[time=964] Yeah? Well, you have to be good to go to heaven. Were you good?
[time=972] Well, of course. I mean, I always... I never... Well, I didn't squish bugs.
[time=982] Oh, come on. That's not enough. I don't think. Certainly there was something. Can you think of anything you did good?
[time=990] I don't need a close to the Salvation Army.
[time=992] Okay, okay. We're getting there. What do we do now?
[time=998] I've got an idea. Let's have church right here on the elevator.
[time=1002] We'll sing. How had that one song go, "Jesus loves a little children. All the children of the world."
[time=1016] I know this one. And everything is beautiful. It is all the way.
[time=1028] Like a summer night or snow from winter's day.
[time=1036] Hey, you are good.
[time=1038] Thanks. That was nothing. You should have heard me in my high school musical. We did God's Spell.
[time=1044] Did you say God's Spell?
[time=1046] Oh, yeah. Remember? There was all this hair and this singing.
[time=1050] So you know Jesus.
[time=1052] Stop. Stop. Stop. What in the world am I doing?
[time=1058] I don't believe in all this heaven or hell. Stop anyway. What was I thinking?
[time=1062] We don't have anything to worry about.
[time=1064] We don't?
[time=1066] No. Don't you see? We're not really in an elevator after all.
[time=1070] It's more like a subway and we're just going to come back in a different place.
[time=1076] You know, reincarnation.
[time=1078] Reincarnation?
[time=1080] Yes. And I want to come back as a cow in India.
[time=1086] For once in my life, I would be treated like a God.
[time=1088] Holy cow.
[time=1090] But you know, maybe she's right. Maybe this isn't an elevator. I don't see a state inspection sticker.
[time=1098] No. There's no emergency phone either.
[time=1102] Oh, no. These walls are feeling a little warm to me.
[time=1106] All this can't be happening.
[time=1108] Oh, light gets warm. We're going to the light. That is good.
[time=1114] We're going to Nirvana. This is good.
[time=1118] The floor is feeling hot now too. Oh, this is definitely not good.
[time=1124] Oh, no.
[time=1126] Do you hear that? Yeah, it's singing.
[time=1128] No. It's screaming.
[time=1132] It's singing. It's singing.
[time=1134] It's singing. Quiet, you guys.
[time=1136] This is ridiculous. You can't tell.
[time=1144] This is agonizing. It doesn't sound good.
[time=1146] Isn't there somewhere we can know for sure?
[time=1150] Wow.
[time=1154] So the question is, the question is, this morning, what is the criteria?
[time=1164] What is the criteria?
[time=1166] People ask me a lot of questions, you know, in the work that I do, in the days that I spend, I get all kinds of questions.
[time=1172] I get questions about kids, and I get questions about marriage. I get questions about the Bible.
[time=1178] But I'll tell you what, one of the questions that is most on the hearts and minds and souls of people is, please, somebody tell me.
[time=1188] How do you get to heaven? How do you get to heaven?
[time=1192] Do good people get to go to heaven?
[time=1194] Do moral people get to go to heaven? Do church attenders or church members go to heaven?
[time=1198] Do those who came from God fearing families go to heaven?
[time=1202] People are wanting to know what the criteria is.
[time=1208] And I am so thankful that we get to come together here today because we get the privilege and the honor of coming to the one true source, the one place where that question gets answered, and it gets answered really, really clearly.
[time=1222] And I'm so thankful for that. We have been in a series on heaven for the last three weeks.
[time=1228] We started out talking about the struggles that we have sometimes, living here on earth and somehow trying to, in our earthly existence,
[time=1236] understand and grasp heaven and eternity.
[time=1240] Last week we came back and we talked about the reality of heaven.
[time=1244] We tried to answer a few questions and then Steve shared so powerfully of his own experience as he, like many of you, have dealt with the process of losing one from this place to that place to the reality of heaven and what that was like.
[time=1260] And this morning we conclude our series by asking the simple but profound question, how do we get there?
[time=1266] I want you to write two things down if you would as we start.
[time=1270] We're going to try our best to come back to this as we conclude our time this morning, but I want you to write this down.
[time=1274] Who gets in? Write that down. Who gets in? And secondly write this down and how?
[time=1282] Who gets in and how? Very, very important questions.
[time=1288] And to answer those questions today we are going to draw a picture.
[time=1294] And it is a picture that we have drawn many times in the past.
[time=1296] It is a picture that we will draw many, many times in the future.
[time=1300] It's one of the most powerful pictures I've ever seen.
[time=1302] If you've come to Christmas with Blackhawk you have seen Susie, our own Amy McIntosh draw this picture in the midst of that performance.
[time=1312] And it is just a powerful tool.
[time=1314] What we're going to do here is take a little bit of a different tact and really dissect, biblically this picture.
[time=1320] We call it the bridge.
[time=1322] And we're going to look at the bridge, this illustration of salvation.
[time=1326] And we're going to kind of just take it apart biblically piece by piece and in the end hopefully put it all together.
[time=1332] But this does in a very clear way answer the question, how does one get to heaven?
[time=1340] How does that happen?
[time=1342] Well you know what?
[time=1342] It begins with God.
[time=1346] And if you want to draw it with me you can.
[time=1348] You can just find a piece of paper if you've got one or you can just follow along here.
[time=1352] This picture, it begins here and I'm just going to put a G there for God.
[time=1358] It begins with God and I would invite you to always start there with God.
[time=1364] And you're thinking on this issue as you wrestle with these things.
[time=1368] Let's just start with Him.
[time=1370] God and what the Bible tells us, what God's Word tells us about Him is so very important for us to keep in mind.
[time=1378] We use phrases like He is perfect.
[time=1382] He is sinless.
[time=1384] He is without spot. He is awesome.
[time=1388] And all of those are great, great descriptive terms.
[time=1392] I want you this morning to focus in on one that I believe just encompasses all of them.
[time=1396] And please understand this morning that the God of the Bible is a holy, holy God.
[time=1404] Holy, God is holy.
[time=1408] Exodus 1511.
[time=1410] Exodus 1511 says, I think it's going to come on the screen for you.
[time=1414] Who is like me among the gods?
[time=1416] Excuse me.
[time=1416] Who is like me among the gods?
[time=1418] Oh, Lord.
[time=1420] Who is like the majestic in holiness?
[time=1424] Awesome.
[time=1424] In praises, working wonders.
[time=1428] If you go to Isaiah back in your Old Testament, if you go to Isaiah chapter 6, you see the prophet Isaiah describing this incredible picture of God
[time=1438] on his throne and the seraphim, these uniquely made angels who were to exist in the presence of God.
[time=1444] Isaiah chapter 6, if you're looking it up, look at verse 2.
[time=1448] Seraphim stood above him, each having six wings.
[time=1452] There was a reason God gave these seraphim six wings.
[time=1454] The seraphim were to function and minister to him in his presence.
[time=1458] And so to be in his presence, they needed six wings.
[time=1462] Keep going with two, he covered his face and with two, he covered his feet and with two, he flew.
[time=1468] And one called out to the other and said, holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts.
[time=1476] Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts.
[time=1480] The whole earth is full of his glory.
[time=1482] And the foundations of the thresholds trembled at the voice of him who called out while the temple was filling with smoke.
[time=1490] People, God is holy.
[time=1492] Write this down, here's a definition for you.
[time=1494] Just to kind of make sense of that word, holy means separate.
[time=1498] Holy means completely other, completely other and separate.
[time=1504] Incomparable, God is incomparable.
[time=1508] There is nothing, there is no one like him.
[time=1512] He is incomparable in his sinless perfection.
[time=1516] God is holy.
[time=1520] The scriptures often refer to him as light.
[time=1524] It says several times that in him there is no what?
[time=1528] Darkness.
[time=1528] None whatsoever.
[time=1530] God is holy.
[time=1532] Man on the other hand is not.
[time=1538] Man is not holy.
[time=1540] Man is not perfect.
[time=1542] Man is not sinless.
[time=1542] And we just draw a man right over here.
[time=1544] We just kind of do this, and we do that, and there's man.
[time=1550] God is holy.
[time=1550] God is perfect.
[time=1552] Let me just say one thing about his holiness before we move on to man.
[time=1554] It just kind of came back to me.
[time=1556] I want to make sure you understand this.
[time=1558] You can't emphasize this enough, I don't think.
[time=1560] Holiness is not just a trait of his, okay?
[time=1564] Understand.
[time=1564] You know, I'm tall.
[time=1566] You're short.
[time=1568] She's young.
[time=1568] I mean, there's all kinds of traits that we give people to describe, you know, parts of it.
[time=1574] Understand, holiness is not just a trait of God.
[time=1576] It's who God is through and through.
[time=1582] It is his entire and full being.
[time=1584] It is the essence of him.
[time=1586] He is holy.
[time=1588] Completely and thoroughly.
[time=1592] And it is all of him.
[time=1594] Inside and out.
[time=1596] External, internal.
[time=1596] God is holy.
[time=1598] Man is not.
[time=1600] Look at Romans 3.
[time=1600] Let's look at this for a second.
[time=1602] Let's see what God's word says.
[time=1604] Let's see what we learn from the Scriptures as we look at the condition of man left to himself.
[time=1610] Man on his own.
[time=1610] Look at Romans 3.9.
[time=1616] And you can just write Romans 3 here because there's several places we'll go and our biblical look at man.
[time=1624] Romans 3.9 says this.
[time=1626] What then, Paul says, are we better than they?
[time=1630] Not at all, for we have already charged that both Jews and Greeks are all under sin.
[time=1638] Jews and Greeks all under sin.
[time=1640] Paul has in the first two chapters of Romans done an amazing thing.
[time=1644] He started with Romans 1.
[time=1646] And you can read through there on your own.
[time=1648] In Romans 1 he gives this incredibly detailed look at what happens to man left to himself.
[time=1654] The natural regression.
[time=1656] It's an ugly picture.
[time=1658] Man left to himself and his sinfulness.
[time=1660] His immoral state.
[time=1664] It just continues and continues to regress.
[time=1666] And if you read through Romans 1 you see there the depravity of man left to himself.
[time=1672] Romans 2 kind of designates another group of people.
[time=1676] It's the moral crowd.
[time=1678] It's the good people who might look at the Romans 1 guy and say, gee, where's look at that?
[time=1684] That's ugly.
[time=1686] Look at all they've done.
[time=1688] Look at where they've gone.
[time=1690] Romans 2, Paul says, you know what, don't judge.
[time=1692] Because in your morality you're as guilty as they are.
[time=1696] Because whether you are blatantly immoral or whether you are just simply trying to rely on your goodness, you're lost.
[time=1706] You're stuck.
[time=1708] You're without hope.
[time=1708] And then in verse chapter 3 he just brings it all together.
[time=1712] Verse 10, as it is written, there is none righteous.
[time=1714] Not even one left to himself.
[time=1716] There is none who understands.
[time=1718] There is none who seeks for God.
[time=1720] All have turned aside.
[time=1722] Together they have become useless.
[time=1724] There is none who does good.
[time=1726] There is not even one.
[time=1730] And then down in verse 23, for all have sinned and false short.
[time=1736] For all have sinned.
[time=1736] Every one of us have sinned and false short of the glory of God.
[time=1740] Romans 3, 23, right there.
[time=1744] For all have sinned.
[time=1744] You know what?
[time=1746] Every person I've ever met.
[time=1748] Any conversation I've ever been in, there seems to be this deep longing.
[time=1752] And there wasn't me as well.
[time=1754] This deep longing in the heart of man to somehow get here.
[time=1760] To get to God.
[time=1762] And a lot of folks try and figure that out in a lot of different ways.
[time=1766] Some folks think that as the guys in the elevator were saying it's about being good.
[time=1770] Some folks think that it's about going to church twice a year, 30 times a year.
[time=1776] People have kind of bought this notion that walking through these doors and sitting in these seats and singing these songs and listening to this guy talk somehow gets you in.
[time=1786] No.
[time=1788] Being good.
[time=1788] Going to church.
[time=1790] Some folks think benevolence.
[time=1790] The giving away of the money that they've made.
[time=1794] Now, it doesn't work.
[time=1794] Romans 3, 23 says no matter what you try, no matter what effort you give.
[time=1798] It says that all falls short.
[time=1802] Man left to himself sinful.
[time=1806] Let me say something there.
[time=1810] Many times I'll have conversations with folks and we'll be talking about the sinfulness of man.
[time=1816] Our propensity left to ourselves to move in that direction.
[time=1820] And as we talk about this bigger picture of salvation and the Holy God, sometimes they'll say to me,
[time=1826] they'll say, you know what, okay, okay, I understand that.
[time=1828] But you know what, I'm not like really bad.
[time=1832] I mean, they talk about the people and they talk about the individuals who have done really bad things
[time=1838] and they want to kind of hold on to this notion.
[time=1840] And maybe you feel this sometimes that you know what, I'm not like really, really bad.
[time=1848] Let me ask you this.
[time=1850] How much of a stain does it take to taint total purity?
[time=1864] Ladies, everywhere white blouse, how much of a little cherry tomato squirt does it take to ruin the night?
[time=1874] I'm asking you, how much of a, how much of a stain does it take to botch complete and absolute purity?
[time=1886] Five? Ten?
[time=1890] No, just one.
[time=1894] And see that reality.
[time=1896] And I'm saying this lovingly. I'm not trying to slap you on the spiritual wrist.
[time=1900] I'm just being honest with you because I was in the same boat.
[time=1904] That reality condemns us all.
[time=1910] We all fall short because we're sinful and he's not.
[time=1918] And he's not.
[time=1922] And the sad and tragic truth is the reality of all this is that our sinfulness, Romans 6, 23.
[time=1932] Romans 6, 23 says that the wages of our sin, the result, what we're compensated for, right?
[time=1942] The wages of our sin, it says it's death.
[time=1948] The wages of sin is death. And that's not just physical death.
[time=1952] I mean, yes, it's true that when Adam and Eve dropped the ball in the garden and this whole thing started going south,
[time=1960] it's true that one of the results of that was that physically we begin to decay.
[time=1964] Physically, yes, we die. This world is dying. You're dying. I'm dying.
[time=1968] And physically, yes, our hearts stop beating.
[time=1972] But the death of Romans 6, 23 is far beyond that. That describes a spiritual death.
[time=1978] Eternal separation from God in a very real place called hell.
[time=1986] And as Amy says in the production, if that were all we had going, it'd be a pretty gloomy, pretty desperate picture.
[time=1996] But this is where it gets incredibly interesting. This is where the dilemma gets solved.
[time=2002] And I want to take you to Ephesians 2, if you would.
[time=2006] I want to take you to Ephesians 2.
[time=2010] And just like I tried to kind of come back and hammer the holiness point there with you, I want to just say one more thing about this dilemma.
[time=2018] I want to just invite you to engage your mind in a portion of truth here in the Scriptures in Ephesians 2
[time=2024] that I think powerfully. You know what? It did for me. I'll just tell you that.
[time=2028] I was 20 years old, finally coming to a point where I was wrestling with who I was and where I'd been
[time=2036] and what I'd been through and who God was and what He was inviting me to.
[time=2042] And at the age of 20, after several years of just struggling and wandering and making some really bad decisions,
[time=2052] I came to the reality of Ephesians 2.1. I want you to read this with me.
[time=2056] And you were dead. Underline that word. And you were dead in your trespasses and sin to what it says there.
[time=2068] And you know what? There may be somebody here today.
[time=2070] And you may be today living outside of personal and meaningful relationship with the Lord.
[time=2078] I was on that day. And I remember as I thought about dead and as I had dead describe to me again,
[time=2086] you think, you know what? Everybody knows dead. Well, you know what? Just stop and think about dead for a second.
[time=2092] And I had, at age 20, already had a few experiences with death, be it a family member or a friend.
[time=2098] I'd walked by a casket or two.
[time=2102] And I realized that what He's saying here is that left to myself in my own efforts.
[time=2106] I am a corpse. I have no life. None.
[time=2112] I'm dead. I'm cold. I'm stiff. Hopeless.
[time=2118] Paul says in Ephesians 2, "And you were dead in your trespasses and sins
[time=2124] in which you formerly walked according to the chorus of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience.
[time=2132] Among them, we too all formally lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh
[time=2140] and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath."
[time=2146] Even as the rest, spiritually dead.
[time=2152] And then, wow, and this hit me like a ton of bricks.
[time=2156] This absolutely bolded me over. Then comes the greatest act of love ever offered.
[time=2162] Now comes the greatest gift ever given, the divine solution.
[time=2166] Mary, see this all comes back to Christmas. It's amazing.
[time=2170] Mary has a baby. That's right.
[time=2174] God gives His Son. Messiah comes to redeem the sinful.
[time=2178] You see, Christmas and the gospel are inextricably linked.
[time=2182] Hope is found in Emmanuel. God with us.
[time=2188] And I'll tell you what, as a 20-year-old who had finally come to saving faith, I began to consider these next six verses, and I'm going to read them to you.
[time=2198] These next six verses, beginning at Ephesians 2, 4, all the way down to Ephesians 2, 9,
[time=2204] absolutely became, in my opinion, as a young believer, they were like the greatest six verses of all time.
[time=2212] I mean, they were it. They just took me to a place I'd never been before.
[time=2218] And as the truth of this passage began to be realized in my own heart, I can't tell you how thankful and how excited I was.
[time=2226] But God, here you go. Here comes the solution.
[time=2228] Here comes God doing what only God could do.
[time=2230] But God being rich in mercy because of His great love with which He loved us.
[time=2238] Even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ
[time=2244] by grace you have been saved and raised us up with Him.
[time=2248] Understand that for me, and maybe for you today, for me at that point in my life, the concept of me being raised up with Christ was almost inconceivable
[time=2260] that I could be in that condition granted so much mercy, extended so much love,
[time=2268] that He would not only save me, but raise Him up with Him and seek me with Him
[time=2274] in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus. In order that, in the ages to come, He might show the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus,
[time=2284] for by grace you have been saved through faith and that not of yourselves,
[time=2290] it is the gift of God, the divine solution, not as a result of works that no one should boast.
[time=2300] Look what He did.
[time=2306] What He did was in His incredible mercy and out of His great love,
[time=2312] He provides a bridge, He provides a way for you and I to get to Him, says in John 3.16,
[time=2320] "For God so loved the world, for God so loved you, for God so loved me, for God so loved the world,
[time=2326] that He gave His only Son, Jesus Christ, for God so loved the world that He gave His only Son,
[time=2334] and whosoever it says, would believe in Him, should not perish, but have everlasting life,
[time=2342] made possible by the spilled blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, the blood that forgave your, what,
[time=2350] your sin and mine, and made relationship with the Holy God possible."
[time=2358] Now I want to talk about something here today. I want to make sure that we get as clear as we can get on this one point. As you look at this and as we talk through it,
[time=2368] there's a word here that's used in John 3.16, and you'll hear us use this word here often.
[time=2374] It's the word believe, for God so loved the world that He gave His only Son,
[time=2380] that whosoever believeth in Him, believe seems to be, and I would agree it is, it's the key to this whole thing.
[time=2388] Your willingness in mind to believe is what Scripture says, bring salvation.
[time=2396] But you see the word believe, it just, in my opinion, all right, I just, I feel as if that concept has just been trashed over the years.
[time=2406] People not really being clear on what it means to believe as described here.
[time=2410] So write this down, believe.
[time=2414] Believe is to be a firm and full, this is the word here used in the New Testament.
[time=2420] God chose the words that we're going to be put into this book.
[time=2422] He chose this Greek word in the New Testament for believe.
[time=2426] Same word in the Old Testament as you look through all the references, brings us to this basic definition, to be a firm and full persuasion.
[time=2436] You see that? To be a firm and full persuasion.
[time=2440] But beyond mere mental assent, nod your head like this, nod your head like this,
[time=2446] mental assent, yeah, mental assent, yep, yep, we agree, okay.
[time=2450] Beyond mental assent, this belief, the belief of John 3 16,
[time=2456] the belief of the Bible as it relates to this process of coming to faith, this belief entails a yielded or surrendered will.
[time=2464] This is a belief that goes far beyond you and I nodding our heads.
[time=2470] The belief that saves is a belief that deep, deep inside an individual
[time=2476] brings that individual, you and I, to a point of yieldedness.
[time=2480] It is a complete and thorough giving up of ourselves to him.
[time=2486] It is a yielding to this, to this picture, to this truth, better yet, it is a yielding, it is a surrender to him, the one who orchestrated it, the one who authored it.
[time=2498] And it's you and I in our humanness responding to the grace and mercy of God
[time=2504] and yielding, believing in him.
[time=2510] Belief isn't, you want to write this down, you can.
[time=2512] Belief isn't, hey, thanks for the ticket home,
[time=2518] and I'll see you in 30 years.
[time=2520] It's not belief.
[time=2522] Belief isn't saying a prayer somewhere when you were 10 or 20 or 50.
[time=2528] Belief isn't a series of words put together in a prayer set in some service
[time=2534] or some situation and then you or I or whoever that is gets up and then goes and lives life however they want.
[time=2542] It's not belief, belief isn't fire insurance and belief isn't religious ritual.
[time=2550] Belief is the surrendered yielded will.
[time=2554] It looks at this and it believes and that belief moves through the entire being,
[time=2560] leaving that individual completely and absolutely surrendered.
[time=2564] We were talking to Marty Collins in between services and we were just kind of going back and forth having a great, great discussion.
[time=2572] And we were reminded of the illustration you've probably heard a thousand times.
[time=2576] It's back in the late, maybe 1800s, early 1900s.
[time=2578] The guy's doing the tight wire rope thing across Niagara Falls
[time=2584] and he's just doing it back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.
[time=2588] This guy's an expert, right?
[time=2590] Never falls, has this thing completely wired?
[time=2592] Crowds of people come on both ends and he says to them, do you believe I can do this and they all say, yeah, you know, do you really believe I can do this?
[time=2602] Yeah, he says to the one guy closest to the rope, do you believe I can do this?
[time=2606] He says, yeah, he says here hop on my back, we'll do it together.
[time=2614] You see that right there?
[time=2616] What's that guy going to do?
[time=2618] It's crude illustration but that's the point.
[time=2622] Yeah, yeah, you can do it. Get on my back.
[time=2626] Do I really believe?
[time=2632] Because if I do, my will and my heart and my soul will be yielded, surrendered.
[time=2640] Real belief is God.
[time=2642] I humbly bring to you my deepest gratitude and thanks for the forgiveness of my sin and the privilege of life with you and God in my belief and in my submission to you.
[time=2654] I want to learn and know what it means to follow and honor and obey you.
[time=2660] Obedience doesn't save you.
[time=2662] It's not the following that saves you, it's the belief.
[time=2666] But the true saving belief is the belief that is open to and wanting desperately to be his.
[time=2674] Completely, completely his.
[time=2678] I got a letter this week.
[time=2680] Couldn't wait to share it with you.
[time=2682] I hope that it's an encouragement to you, those of you who are a part of this family.
[time=2688] But I also want you to sense the work God did in the heart of this individual as it relates to this very issue of starting to get clear on what it means to really be his.
[time=2698] Hi, my name is and they give me their name.
[time=2700] I've met you a few times.
[time=2702] I'm sure you've met hundreds of people a few times so you might not remember me.
[time=2706] I looked at the bottom, saw the name and it was really exciting because I absolutely did.
[time=2710] I'm currently helping out and she lists some different ministries.
[time=2714] And about a month and a half ago, I could never have imagined loving a church or even God so much.
[time=2720] I got involved with Blackhawk through a friend who told me that I might be able to help out in one of the ministries.
[time=2726] I called Blackhawk and then met with Greg Deason.
[time=2728] Greg and I met for a few weeks to talk about God.
[time=2732] And I love that about our people here.
[time=2734] I mean, we're not perfect, we're still working on some things.
[time=2736] But I tell you what, we've got needs around here.
[time=2738] And oftentimes when the needs are great and folks respond, the tendency might be on our part to say great, you go there quick and we'll see you later.
[time=2746] But no, so many of us here.
[time=2748] Greg in this case, interested in hearing people's story, understanding where they're at in the process.
[time=2754] And so they spent weeks talking about God.
[time=2756] He gave me some great advice helping me begin the journey of my life.
[time=2760] Greg and his secretaries have already done so much for me as they have shown me much love and care.
[time=2766] They even bought me a Bible.
[time=2768] I have been and am still going through some very trying times in my life.
[time=2770] And I have never had anybody truly care for me so much.
[time=2774] It is amazing to see how God works through people.
[time=2776] I always thought it would be a chore to represent God.
[time=2780] But now I realize watching all of you that it's a privilege.
[time=2784] The reason I'm writing this letter is to tell you that I always thought I would probably go to heaven.
[time=2788] But I was never sure.
[time=2790] I told Greg that I thought I would go to heaven because I had prayed a prayer to God in my heart.
[time=2796] Before long though, I realized that if I had died, I would not have gone to heaven.
[time=2800] The reason being that I asked God into my heart but I did not take him into my life.
[time=2806] Do you see that?
[time=2808] That's how she said it.
[time=2810] And I loved the innocence of it.
[time=2812] The difference became obvious to me.
[time=2814] This past month I have been working on becoming closer to and learning more about God.
[time=2818] While times have been tough, I have grown with him through prayer and the Bible and Blackhawk.
[time=2824] Your service has always touched me in one way or another, but today was amazing.
[time=2828] Today, December 15th, 2002, I realized that heaven is my true home.
[time=2832] For the first time in my life, I know that I am going to heaven.
[time=2838] I have accepted Jesus Christ into my heart recently and today made it final.
[time=2842] Wow, she says, "Blackhawk is for real.
[time=2846] Now I am too.
[time=2848] Between Greg, Lisa, Barbara, and you my life will continue to change on this amazing journey.
[time=2852] And I wanted to let you know how much I appreciate all that you people have done." Amen?
[time=2858] [AMEN] Saving faith, people.
[time=2862] Saving faith shows itself in full surrender.
[time=2864] Saving faith evidences itself in a yielded will.
[time=2868] And I want you to see some things that I think will help you.
[time=2872] I think it will encourage you.
[time=2874] I think it will bring to bear this truth even more so.
[time=2876] Look at James chapter two.
[time=2882] It says in James chapter two, some exciting things about true saving faith and where it leads, and how it's evidenced in the life of an individual, and how it moves beyond a nodding of the head, a few words spoken here.
[time=2900] James 2.14 says, "What use is it my brethren?" You see that?
[time=2904] "What use is it my brethren?" If a man says he has faith, but he has no works, can that faith save him?
[time=2912] Go down to verse 19.
[time=2914] You believe?
[time=2916] Here we go.
[time=2916] You believe that God has won?
[time=2918] You do well.
[time=2920] The demons do that.
[time=2922] Talking about mental ascent here.
[time=2924] Talking about a belief that simply stays in this cognitive realm of just nodding our heads and, yeah, I believe that's true.
[time=2932] He says, "You believe that God is..." Well, you know what?
[time=2936] Join the crowd.
[time=2936] The demons believe.
[time=2940] So what makes you different?
[time=2944] The demons also believe in shutter, but are you willing to recognize, verse 20, that faith without works is useless?
[time=2952] Faith.
[time=2954] True belief.
[time=2954] A surrendered, desiring to be obedient heart before God.
[time=2960] It says, "Take me.
[time=2962] Move me.
[time=2964] Teach me this.
[time=2964] Bring the people of God and the Spirit of God and the Word of God into my life.
[time=2968] I am completely and thoroughly yours.
[time=2972] I want to follow honor and obey.
[time=2976] Matthew 7, go back to the very beginning of the New Testament.
[time=2982] And the reason I take you here is because you know what?
[time=2984] I think a lot of people have really misunderstood.
[time=2986] And you know what?
[time=2988] We're going to do our best.
[time=2990] And I'm going to do my very best to try and be really clear on this.
[time=2992] Well, there's many people as possible.
[time=2994] But a lot of folks have chosen to really come at this thing from a different tact.
[time=3000] A lot of folks, I think, have chosen a nodding of the head.
[time=3006] Matthew 7, look at verse 13.
[time=3008] Jesus speaking here says this.
[time=3010] Enter by the narrow gate.
[time=3014] Enter by the...
[time=3014] Here you go.
[time=3016] Enter by the narrow gate.
[time=3018] And he's not saying this judgmentally.
[time=3020] He's not saying this arrogantly.
[time=3022] He's not saying this sarcastic.
[time=3024] No, he is saying this lovingly.
[time=3026] Enter by the narrow gate.
[time=3030] And then watch what he says.
[time=3032] Enter by the narrow gate.
[time=3032] For the gate is wide.
[time=3034] And the way is broad that leads to destruction.
[time=3038] And many, he says, are those who enter by it.
[time=3044] For the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life.
[time=3048] And few are those who find it.
[time=3050] Hey, people, you know what the bottom line here is?
[time=3054] Let's just be honest.
[time=3056] It's a lot easier to just nod your head.
[time=3062] Do you understand that?
[time=3064] It's just a whole lot easier.
[time=3066] And many, you know, in your world and mine, just one easy.
[time=3070] That's what we want.
[time=3072] We want easy.
[time=3072] And it's a whole lot easier to just nod ahead.
[time=3078] He says no.
[time=3080] The gate is small.
[time=3084] I am the way, John 14-6, said lovingly.
[time=3088] Said in an offering of hope and life, "I am the way," he said.
[time=3092] The little baby, you know whose life, whose birth we celebrate next week, he grows up.
[time=3096] And he says in the 14th chapter of John, verse 6, "I am the way, the truth and the life," and nobody comes to the Father.
[time=3104] Nobody, but by me.
[time=3108] But by me.
[time=3112] Where are you today?
[time=3114] Any time you draw this picture, any time you think through this concept, you always want to ask the question, you know, whoever it is, you're having the privilege of just kind of sharing this with.
[time=3124] You know, and it's a privilege for me to get to share it with you today.
[time=3128] Where are you in this picture?
[time=3132] Some people I talk to, they say, "Well, I'm four easels over." They say, "I'm not there." You know, keep talking to me, but no, I'm not there.
[time=3144] Others say, "You know what, boy, boy, I feel like I'm right here.
[time=3148] I just feel like I'm right on the edge." And as Amy says in the drama, and if you haven't seen it, come back today, 3.30 and 7.30, you will absolutely love it.
[time=3160] Amy asks her friend, "Where do you want to be?" "Where do you want to be?" And I want to ask you that today.
[time=3166] "Where do you want to be?" That's as clear as it gets, and that's not me, that's this.
[time=3174] And I'll tell you what I said at the age of 20.
[time=3178] And I'll just, you don't have to bow your heads, you don't have to close your eyes.
[time=3182] I'll just tell you how I said it.
[time=3184] When I came to grips with the fact that I needed His help, His mercy and His love,
[time=3190] I said this, I said, "God in heaven, I'm sinful, and I'm not perfect, and you are."
[time=3200] And God, thank you so very much for doing for me what I could have never done by myself.
[time=3208] Thank you for your Son, for His death, and the forgiveness of my Son,
[time=3214] that allows me now the privilege of relationship with you.
[time=3218] And I said, "Oh God, I believe." Then I don't just believe, I mean, I believe, and I am completely and absolutely yours.
[time=3230] And you know what, if you're saying that, strike that.
[time=3236] If you are believing that today, then He is drawing you to Himself,
[time=3244] because it's an act of God, you know, He does this, He brings us to Himself.
[time=3248] And if you are believing that today, for the first time, He's saving you.
[time=3252] You're crossing over the bridge right now.
[time=3258] And that is some of the most exciting stuff, you know, that you'll ever experience.
[time=3264] And then it gets even better, because then you get to learn what it means to follow,
[time=3270] to obey, to honor, and live this life.
[time=3274] There's a detachment on your bulletin this morning.
[time=3278] And in a little bit, I'm going to ask you to just fill that out if you need to.
[time=3282] On the second box there, it says, "Today I crossed over the bridge." And you know what, if you feel like in your heart, that really went on in your soul between you and Him today.
[time=3292] And I ask you to just add to that, we were supposed to have that read, "Today I crossed over, please contact me, we'd love to talk to you." So you can look at that little detachment, and I'm going to ask you to turn that in on your way out today.
[time=3304] But before we go, I want to just say this to you, and I want you to listen.
[time=3310] Christmas. Christmas is absolutely an undeniably linked to heaven.
[time=3320] I mean, you can make a case for the fact that, you know, that's why He sent His Son
[time=3326] to ensure and provide a way for us to spend eternity with Him.
[time=3330] Christmas and Heaven are just right there.
[time=3334] And they were waiting, you know, for their Messiah to come.
[time=3338] They were hoping that He would come and make a difference.
[time=3342] They were wanting so desperately for Him to come and be who He said He'd be and do what He said He would do,
[time=3348] and you know what He did.
[time=3350] And the amazing truth is He's still coming.
[time=3352] And the manger, you know, it looks different today.
[time=3356] Today it's a human heart.
[time=3358] And a different world than was there back in Bethlehem on that holy night.
[time=3364] But our hope is that as you head into Christmas, and as we celebrate that,
[time=3370] it's coming Wednesday, that your heart would just cry out with gratitude and thanks for the fact that He came and He did what He did.
[time=3378] It's an amazing place that we live in today.
[time=3382] And if you know Him today, there's great comfort in that.
[time=3384] But you also know that there are many others who still are trying to figure this thing out.
[time=3388] Just know again that if in a significant and personal way for you today,
[time=3394] Heaven has become a reality.
[time=3396] We would love to know.
[time=3396] We would love to celebrate that with you.
[time=3400] And we would love to help you with a new life and a new opportunity to live completely
[time=3406] and fully surrender to Him.
[time=3408] And so as you leave, if any of those boxes made sense for you today, make sure you drop those off with the folks at the door.
[time=3414] And let me now, if I can, just invite you to pray with heads bowed or knees bowed
[time=3420] or however you want to do that.
[time=3422] Let's just bring ourselves before Him.
[time=3426] Father, thank you again.
[time=3428] Thank you for the gift of your Son.
[time=3432] And thank you for an understanding today of Christmas that goes so far beyond a day in December.
[time=3440] God, it reaches into eternity past and eternity future.
[time=3444] God, it represents the very life.
[time=3448] And that not only was born that day, but the very life that you gave us.
[time=3452] And God, we thank you for that.
[time=3454] We thank you for the hope of salvation.
[time=3456] We thank you for the reality that your mercy and your love were so great
[time=3462] that you saw fit to extend them to us a needy, hurting, sinful people.
[time=3470] And God, we pray that as we leave this place, that the reality of that would truly change the way we live and think and choose.
[time=3478] And God, as we leave, give us courage to live a life that would be a reflection
[time=3484] of your great love and mercy.
[time=3486] We look forward to Wednesday, and we look forward to being back together again soon.
[time=3492] We love you, Lord, and thank you so very much for this time together.
[time=3494] In your Son's name we pray, amen.
