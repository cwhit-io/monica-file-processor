[time=207] It makes me want to dance, but I don't know if I'm allowed to do it.
[time=211] Good morning.
[time=213] I'm Mitch, I'm a teaching pastor here at Blackhawk, and I want to warn you.
[time=217] The guys behind me have a lot of energy today.
[time=220] All right?
[time=221] You want to do it?
[time=222] Hey, why don't you just stand up?
[time=223] Let's just say hi to everybody.
[time=225] Just stand up, and you can kind of do a move forward in center.
[time=229] The snows kept some people away, so feel free to move forward and kind of come to the center.
[time=235] How's it going?
[time=237] You, sir, sir, what's your favorite Bible verse?
[time=240] Leviticus 1340, what a man has lost his hair, he is bald, he is clean.
[time=246] That's my favorite.
[time=247] How's it going?
[time=248] [APPLAUSE]
[time=252] Oh, yeah, the choir, are you going to go out there?
[time=256] I kind of missed our chance.
[time=258] How's the choir doing?
[time=261] The choir is on.
[time=262] Oh, that was so exciting.
[time=266] Yeah, you're awesome.
[time=270] All right.
[time=272] Good morning.
[time=275] Welcome to Blackhawk.
[time=276] If you're a visitor, good morning.
[time=279] If you're a visitor, there's a card in front of you.
[time=282] We'd like you just to fill that out, let us know about you.
[time=285] When the offering plate comes around, just put that in there.
[time=289] No money, please take a pass.
[time=290] The offering's just for people who call Blackhawk home.
[time=294] Today, you're so blessed.
[time=296] Kelly's going to kind of just treat this as we're sitting in his living room, and he's just talking to us about life and life around here, and it's just going to be so engaging for you, I think.
[time=307] I mean, I just loved it, and it's kind of a building of last week's message about Christ and hurry and disunity of the soul.
[time=317] And we're going to take the next couple weeks and talk about mission, vision, and hope and purpose in our lives.
[time=323] So I just want to thank you for coming.
[time=325] So glad that you're here.
[time=327] Let's just pray and invite God from our perspective into this presence.
[time=334] God, we just thank you that you create, that you save, that you sustain, and that you and only you are Lord.
[time=351] We thank you for Jesus Christ.
[time=355] God help us to individually, each push the pause button on our lives, and just welcome you wholeheartedly into every fiber of our being.
[time=369] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=372] Good morning.
[time=374] I've been looking forward to this.
[time=376] It was nice to have a change of pace for a while and have a smaller band and not, you know, have the choir and all that stuff, but I'm glad they're back, and I'm glad everyone is there.
[time=385] Everybody's here, and I'm just excited about worship today.
[time=388] I want to share something with you that I read in my Bible calls it Isaiah's Vision.
[time=393] In an art search to know and understand who God is, this book has the answers, and this is what it says about God.
[time=400] Isaiah chapter 6, "I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, lofty and exalted with the train of His robe filling the temple.
[time=408] The seraphim stood above him, each having six wings, with two he covered his face, with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.
[time=416] And one called out to another and said this about God, about who he is.
[time=420] Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts.
[time=423] The whole earth is full of His glory.
[time=426] In the foundations of the threshold, tremble that the voice of Him who called out while the temple was filled with smoke."
[time=433] So imagine this Isaiah's having this vision, and he sees these floating objects, and he sees God seated on the throne,
[time=441] and he's got this robe on that fills the whole throne room, and there's smoke, and there's what else?
[time=447] Oh, a trembling, the whole place trembled at the sound of His voice.
[time=451] And this is Isaiah's response, "Woe is me for I am ruined."
[time=457] Pretty drastic, because I'm a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips.
[time=462] For my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts.
[time=465] Because he saw the King, he said, "Whoa, I'm not good enough.
[time=469] I am not holy like He is holy. I'm imperfect, and He is perfect." And then one of the seraphim flew to me with a burning coal in his hand, which he had taken from the altar with tongs.
[time=480] And he touched my mouth with it and said, "Behold, this is touch your lips, and your iniquity is taken from you, and your sins are forgiven."
[time=489] We are a people today who have come to the throne room of God with unclean lips.
[time=495] And although I'm sure a lot of us have come to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ, we still fall short,
[time=502] and we still need to confess our sins as we approach this awesome and mighty and holy God.
[time=508] And so as we sing this morning about the awesomeness of God the Father, knowing that He is so awesome, realize in yourself that you have unclean lips, and you need Him to take that coal and to burn the impurities off your lips
[time=522] from what you've done this week or in the past month, or just use it as a time of confession and as a time of communion,
[time=531] and saying, "God, you are God, and we are not. We fall short, but you are holy." So let's stand together as we worship and sing out from your heart and let's fill this room with praises.
[time=542] [MUSIC]
[time=559] Here in this house of the great King, we come together now to worship Him.
[time=572] This house is built on Christ our right, and not be shaken, and not be shaken.
[time=586] God is awesome in this place, for since His presence as we sing His praise,
[time=598] there is power here for miracles, except the captives free, make the broken world.
[time=608] God is awesome, He's so awesome, God is awesome in His place.
[time=620] [MUSIC]
[time=630] Here in this house of the great King, we come together now to worship Him.

[time=651] God is awesome in this place, for since His presence as we sing His praise,

[time=685] [MUSIC]
[time=699] I found where I belong, I'm a living stone, and in this house I live room.
[time=744] There is power here for miracles, except the captives free, make the broken world.
[time=754] God is awesome, He's so awesome, God is awesome, He's so awesome, God is awesome in this place.
[time=773] [APPLAUSE]
[time=780] [MUSIC]
[time=788] This is my crown, this is my song, you are my guiding line, the waves of gold.
[time=815] And when these sunny skies turn shades of gray, I'll stay close by your side, as you leave the way.
[time=836] Jesus, lead on, I don't follow, Jesus, lead on, let your love back away, Jesus, lead on, I don't follow, Jesus, lead on.
[time=856] [MUSIC]
[time=867] Hear now this cry, hear now this song, you are my guiding line, for the journey I'm on.
[time=888] And when my vision is cloudy, I don't think that the rain, how stay close by your side, as you leave the way.
[time=909] Jesus, lead on, I don't follow, Jesus, lead on, let your love back away, Jesus, lead on, I don't follow, Jesus, lead on, Jesus, lead on, I don't follow, Jesus, lead on, let your love back away.
[time=937] Jesus, lead on, I don't follow, Jesus, lead on.

[time=971] Jesus, lead on, let your love back away, Jesus, lead on, let your love back away, Jesus, lead on, I don't follow, Jesus, lead on.
[time=991] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1005] Here we go.
[time=1032] I will worship, I will worship, with all of my heart, I will praise you, with all of my strength, I will see you.
[time=1061] All of my day, I will come out of your way, I will give you all my worship, I will give you all my praise.
[time=1088] Here we go. I long to worship, here we go, I will worship, here we go, I will worship, here we go.
[time=1116] I will forgive, I will give you everything, I will live God, my eyes do your goal, I will trust you, I will trust you, I will trust you alone.
[time=1145] I will give, I will give you all my worship, I will give you all my praise.
[time=1159] Here we go, I long to worship, here we go, I will give you all my worship, I will give you all my praise.
[time=1179] Here we go, I long to worship, here we go, I will bring you all my praise.
[time=1199] Let's give him praise.
[time=1217] May our homes be filled with dancing, may our streets be filled with joy, may justice bound to Jesus,
[time=1239] as the people turn to praise, from the mountain to the valley, hear our praises rise to you,
[time=1259] from the heaven to the nation, hear our singing, and the end.
[time=1283] May our light shine in the darkness, as we walk before the cross, may our glory fill the whole earth,
[time=1305] as the water or the sea, from the mountain to the valley, hear our praises rise to you,
[time=1325] from the heaven to the nation, hear our singing, fill the air, from the mountain to the valley,
[time=1347] hear our praises rise to you, from the heaven to the nation, hear our singing,
[time=1365] hear our praises rise to you, from the mountain to the nation, hear our praises rise to you,
[time=1383] from the heaven to the nation, hear our praises rise to you, from the heaven to the city,
[time=1429] hear our praises rise to you, from the heaven to the nation, hear our praises rise to you,
[time=1447] from the heaven to the nation, hear our praises rise to you, from the heaven to the nation,
[time=1473] hear our praises rise to you, from the heaven to the nation, hear our praises rise to you,
[time=1481] from the heaven to the nation, hear our praises rise to you, from the heaven to the nation,
[time=1499] hear our praises rise to you, from the heaven to the nation, hear our praises rise to you,
[time=1521] from the heaven to the nation, hear our praises rise to you, from the heaven to the nation,
[time=1539] amen. You can be seated.
[time=1569] (Music) The music fades, all is stripped away, and I simply come.
[time=1585] I'll need just to bring something that's a word that will bless your heart.
[time=1598] I'll bring you more than a song, for a song in itself is not what you have required.
[time=1612] You search much deeper within, through the way things appear, you're looking into my heart.
[time=1625] I'm coming back to the heart of worship, and it's all about you.
[time=1634] It's all about you, Jesus.
[time=1638] I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it, and it's all about you.
[time=1647] It's all about you, Jesus.
[time=1659] King of endless world, no one could express how much you deserve.
[time=1672] No one we can pull, all I have is yours, every single ring.
[time=1684] I'll bring you more than a song, for a song in itself is not what you have required.
[time=1698] You search much deeper within, through the way things appear, you're looking into my heart.
[time=1711] I'm coming back to the heart of worship, and it's all about you.
[time=1720] Jesus, I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it, and it's all about you.
[time=1733] It's all about you, more than a song, I'll bring you more than a song, for a song in itself is not what you have required.
[time=1749] You search much deeper within, through the way things appear, you're looking into my heart.
[time=1761] I'm coming back to the heart of worship, and it's all about you.
[time=1770] It's all about you, Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it, when it's all about you.
[time=1783] It's all about you, Jesus.
[time=1787] I'm coming back to the heart of worship, when it's all about you.
[time=1796] It's all about you, Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it, when it's all about you.
[time=1809] It's all about you, Jesus.
[time=1816] God help us, because we don't know what it means to have a heart for worship.
[time=1825] We know in part, but God, you know in full, and we ask you to impart your wisdom, your love, your knowledge, and your grace into each one of us, God, so that we can have hearts that are fully devoted and true followers of you.
[time=1842] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1872] Hey, just so I can gauge where we're at here today, if the last 35 minutes blessed your heart, strengthened your soul, gave you fresh perspective.
[time=1891] Would you say amen? Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. You know, that's church, folks. That is what you just sensed and what you just participated in there.
[time=1904] That's the Spirit of God, and the people of God, and the Word of God.
[time=1910] And when those things come together, it is a powerful, powerful thing.
[time=1915] It draws people to Christ. It points to the already convinced toward a deeper faith.
[time=1920] It strengthens the soul. And I'm so thankful that we got to share that together.
[time=1925] Hey, would you just, while we're still kind of in a prayerful mode, I want to just ask if you were going to bow in just a second here.
[time=1930] We got word this morning that our own Ruth burns.
[time=1935] Many of you may know Ruth, she's been around for a while, sister of Dale Siegel.
[time=1938] And her son is, her name is Warren, and he pastors a church down west of Indianapolis.
[time=1944] A faithful, faithful guy with a bunch of great people, about 200 people in this church.
[time=1949] And their church burned down last night, just to the ground, just gone.
[time=1954] And in the, in the, in the midnight hours, it just, something happened and they came this morning.
[time=1960] It was gone. And so there's a bunch of folks down there who are, as you would understand, hurting and discouraged.
[time=1967] I'm sure to some degree, but you know, and, and I know that the church didn't burn down, right?
[time=1973] Because the church is those faithful people down there who will with God's help in his direction.
[time=1978] And I'm sure the assistance of a lot of folks who will come alongside and will try and be a part of that effort.
[time=1984] But we want to just pray for them. Warren is his name. He's the pastor.
[time=1988] And that's Ruth's son and those people.
[time=1991] Imagine what that would be like to show up here one Sunday morning and find nothing.
[time=1997] Nothing.
[time=1999] And to pick up the pieces and to move forward, we need to just do our best to support them.
[time=2003] So would you just pray with me for a moment? Please, Father, we come before you this morning again.
[time=2008] And situations like this realizing that your ways are not always ours.
[time=2013] That you are God and we are not.
[time=2016] And in our confusion and in our discouragement even at times, God, we want to remain faithful to what you would have in mind.
[time=2026] All things, you said, all things work together in time for good.
[time=2033] And there are some folks down there, West of Indy, who this morning need that gentle reminder
[time=2040] that you are a God who is near and that your love for them is great and that your plans for them are amazing.
[time=2048] And God, we just lift them up.
[time=2050] We lift Warren up and we pray for strength as he gives leadership and give us wisdom that we would know how to best come alongside.
[time=2058] In your son's name we pray. Amen.
[time=2062] Well, good morning. It is so good to be with you this morning.
[time=2065] We're going to take a little bit of a different tack this morning just for a little bit, and then we're going to jump into some things that we've prepared.
[time=2072] But I've got to tell you, every once in a while, it just kind of wells up in me.
[time=2078] Me being me and wired the way I am, I just periodically need the opportunity.
[time=2083] And I'm so thankful that you grant it to me to just kind of talk with you about some stuff,
[time=2089] to just catch up to kind of just take some things that God's been putting on my heart
[time=2095] and some things that God's been doing here within our leadership.
[time=2098] And as we think about this family and our future and this next year, it just seemed like a good Sunday to just take a few minutes and really just kind of dialogue and catch up on some things that are really very important
[time=2111] for us to be caught up on.
[time=2113] I want to just share three or four things with you that we're going to do here in this initial period of time together that I've been wanting to do for a while.
[time=2123] So first of all, let me say this, first of all, let me just say welcome to those of you
[time=2129] who are new to Blackhawk.
[time=2131] We get the chance every once in a while to just kind of do this, to just say, "Hey, you know what, time out." In the last month, in the last two, three, four, five months, there's probably some folks who have started to call Blackhawk home and it's kind of a new thing for you.
[time=2144] And we want you to know how thankful we are for the chance to be here with you.
[time=2148] I want you to know how grateful I am for the opportunity to, along with those who serve alongside me, provide a place where you can come.
[time=2155] And you may know the Lord, you may have been walking with the Lord for years, and hopefully this is a place where that walk and that relationship can be strengthened.
[time=2162] You may not know the Lord yet.
[time=2164] You may not have come to a point where you have really and truly surrendered your heart and life to him, but you're on a great journey.
[time=2171] And he's got you here and maybe there's some folks who are helping you along and we just want you to know how thankful we are for that.
[time=2177] If you're really new, my name's Kelly.
[time=2180] And I have the absolute privilege of serving along many others.
[time=2184] I'm just part of an incredible team that God's put together here.
[time=2187] And I get to serve in the role as senior pastor.
[time=2190] And I have been doing that now for -- I've been doing that for three years.
[time=2194] December 19th was three years.
[time=2196] Me and my wife, Deborah, have been here in Fort Wayne and we've been at Blackhawk for seven years.
[time=2201] It'll be seven years next week.
[time=2203] And we hope that we get to do that for a whole lot of years to come.
[time=2206] But we love -- I love what I get to do.
[time=2209] We absolutely count on a privilege to be a part of this family and to get to do what I get to do each and every day with those who help me do that around here.
[time=2218] It is a wonderful group of people.
[time=2220] They love you.
[time=2221] They care for your children.
[time=2222] They invest in your students.
[time=2224] They're just a wonderful team.
[time=2226] And I couldn't ask for a better opportunity.
[time=2229] Oftentimes, I want to just share this with you briefly.
[time=2231] And this is just for -- I mean, it's kind of for information, but it's kind of for fun, too, just because people oftentimes ask me.
[time=2237] And sometimes they ask me really seriously wondering, and sometimes they kind of give you a bad time.
[time=2243] It kind of goes along with the joke that you heard about the kid who wanted to grow up and be a pastor because you only had to work one day a week.
[time=2250] Some of you sometimes wonder, so what does a pastor do?
[time=2254] You ever wondered that?
[time=2256] What do you do all week long?
[time=2258] I mean, what does it really actually look like?
[time=2260] We were at dinner over the break, and somebody just genuinely asked.
[time=2263] So they said, "I have no idea.
[time=2265] I see you on Sunday, but what do you do all week?" So I just thought -- and my answer to that is very similar to a lot of the guys and the gals on our team here.
[time=2275] There's a lot going on.
[time=2276] I just threw it up on the slide for you, so you could just -- there you go.
[time=2279] Just letting you in a little bit to my world and what that looks like.
[time=2282] That's kind of a week at a glance.
[time=2284] Message preparation could be anywhere from 15 to 25 hours.
[time=2287] We have a leadership team, a group of us that meets every Wednesday for four hours.
[time=2291] Those are the folks that just try to kind of put their arms around.
[time=2294] Most of this place, and give leadership to that, our programming team meeting.
[time=2298] The programming team.
[time=2300] It's headed up by Eric Hall.
[time=2302] He's our programming director.
[time=2304] And that's a weekly meeting that I'm a part of.
[time=2306] I don't lead that, but I just participate in it.
[time=2308] And the programming team is the team that plans what happens here every week.
[time=2312] We take that very seriously.
[time=2314] That's not thrown together on Saturday night.
[time=2317] These services, the videos, the dramas, the messages, the themes, the songs that are chosen.
[time=2321] All that's thought about, talked about, prayed about four, five, six weeks in advance.
[time=2326] And we take that very, very seriously.
[time=2328] And so that's a part of my week.
[time=2330] Individual leadership team members and I meet just to update on progress in certain areas.
[time=2335] I try my best to come alongside and provide support and encouragement.
[time=2338] However, I can.
[time=2339] We meet with the entire staff of our team.
[time=2343] Everybody, for about two hours a week, sometimes that's more, sometimes that's less appointments.
[time=2349] I'm usually good for about eight hours a week.
[time=2352] And that's just where you call and you say, "Hey, could we get together and talk?" And Lori kind of helps coordinate all that and we get you in as best we can.
[time=2360] And sometimes that takes a little while and I want to thank you for your patience in that.
[time=2364] But it means a lot to me to get to stay in close contact with whoever might need a 45 minutes or an hour
[time=2372] to talk about the things that maybe God's doing in your life or the needs that you have.
[time=2375] So we make room for that and then planning.
[time=2377] Planning means getting ready for all the above.
[time=2380] And then Sunday mornings I'm here for a little bit as well.
[time=2384] So that's kind of my week at a glance.
[time=2386] And if anybody ever asks you, "So what does he do all week?" You can kind of tell them.
[time=2392] Moving on from that.
[time=2394] I wanted to just share a couple of things.
[time=2396] One was this.
[time=2397] I will be periodically, I'll be sitting over there.
[time=2400] Our offices, most of our pastoral offices are over across the street.
[time=2404] Corbin and Eric and Ed and some of the programming folks are on this side.
[time=2408] A lot of us are over there across the street and I will oftentimes.
[time=2412] I'll be sitting in my office and I'll read something.
[time=2415] Or I'll get an email or I'll be reading in a book or I'll get a phone call or I'll hear a story
[time=2422] about something that God's doing.
[time=2425] There'll be some kind of moment there and I'll just me being me the way I am.
[time=2429] I want to capture it and I really do this.
[time=2432] I want to tell all of you.
[time=2434] But you're not all there.
[time=2436] And I can't get on the phone because that takes too long and it just kills me.
[time=2441] Because sometimes I really want you to know and I don't want you to wait until Sunday.
[time=2445] Sometimes things happen.
[time=2447] And I really want you to know what happened and how it happened and what God did.
[time=2452] I want you to be as encouraged.
[time=2454] I want you to be as reminded as I get as these things unfold.
[time=2458] And so I was talking to our tech guys.
[time=2461] I'm not very techie.
[time=2463] I said, "Hey, how could we do that?" And they said, "Well, it's real easy.
[time=2466] Just stand up on Sunday.
[time=2467] Ask them to look at their bulletin." And I think we've provided it for you.
[time=2470] There's a tear-off section.
[time=2472] And this is just if you're open, okay?
[time=2474] You don't have to do this.
[time=2475] But if you would be open to me having your email address.
[time=2479] I won't send you funny stuff.
[time=2481] I won't pass along everything in the world.
[time=2483] I'll just use it with discretion.
[time=2485] But if you would be willing to just give me your email address.
[time=2489] And then I guess they can put that on some big master list that just I can have.
[time=2493] And then if I want to just shoot you a note and encourage you with something, I can just get all of you.
[time=2498] And one press of the button blows my mind.
[time=2500] But they say it can happen.
[time=2502] So I'm trusting them.
[time=2503] So if you wouldn't mind, fill that out.
[time=2505] And if you think I already have yours, don't think that because I might not.
[time=2509] Do it again.
[time=2510] And then the guys will be in the back, the guys in the gals will be back in the back afterwards.
[time=2514] And you can just drop that in a bucket and they'll get it to me and we'll have a whole lot of fun.
[time=2518] Thank you.
[time=2519] I also wanted to share two more things.
[time=2522] Three more things.
[time=2524] One of the things that we, thanks for filling those out.
[time=2528] One of the things that we really, really want to see happen.
[time=2532] Probably kind of in a better way than it's happened in the past.
[time=2535] We want to just kind of keep working on this.
[time=2537] Because we want to help you get those of you who are here, and you come through those doors and you sit in here and you kind of know a few folks that you sit around, you know.
[time=2546] We tend to kind of sit in the same places.
[time=2548] I mean, you're here and you're sort of plugged in, but you know what?
[time=2551] There's so much more to this family.
[time=2553] There's so much more to Blackhawk.
[time=2555] You know, than just sitting in one of these seats and taking in all that goes on here in a service.
[time=2559] We want to help you get connected.
[time=2561] And whether you're young, whether you're old, no matter where you've been, no matter who you are, we want to help you get connected to this place and it's people.
[time=2570] For the greatest people in the world.
[time=2572] One of the ways that we do that is through our adult classes on Sunday mornings.
[time=2576] They're called ABFs.
[time=2577] And we're going to start two new adult classes starting in February.
[time=2581] And they're going to be called connection classes, which is basically what ABFs do anyway.
[time=2586] They help people get connected to a smaller group of people.
[time=2590] Needs get shared, lives get shared, you know.
[time=2593] It's a wonderful setting.
[time=2595] These two new classes, and you're going to hear a lot about this in the next month.
[time=2598] These two new classes have kind of a unique twist and that we're trying to provide kind of a multi-generational setting.
[time=2605] We're going to have these two classes and they're not going to be age specific.
[time=2609] It's going to be single adults, we hope.
[time=2612] It's going to be young married.
[time=2614] Without kids, it's going to be married with kids.
[time=2617] It's going to be married with kids in high school or college.
[time=2620] It's going to be, you know, grandparents and single adults who are later in life.
[time=2624] The whole gamut, we're going to try and bring in a sense kind of like a little church kind of together.
[time=2630] 30, 40, 50 folks.
[time=2632] And we're really looking forward to it.
[time=2634] It would be a great entry point for some of you who are maybe newer to this place and wanting
[time=2640] an opportunity to connect.
[time=2642] Other ABFs that are in existence, they may be for you a great entry point.
[time=2646] And I would encourage you to check those out.
[time=2648] But don't miss that.
[time=2649] Keep your ears perked.
[time=2651] Coming up in the next month, you'll hear a lot about connection.
[time=2653] And there'll be opportunities made available to you and we want you to respond.
[time=2657] And know what it's like to really be connected.
[time=2660] Also coming up the end of this month, January 26th, I believe.
[time=2666] I want you to know this.
[time=2667] I want you to hear this.
[time=2668] We're starting a new series.
[time=2669] And it's something that we've been planning for.
[time=2671] It's something that we've been praying about.
[time=2673] It's something we really believe God has for this family at this time.
[time=2676] And Steve and Mitchell and myself are so very much looking forward to teaching through the
[time=2682] book of James.
[time=2683] It's a book in the New Testament back toward the back.
[time=2687] And for those of you who have again been walking with the Lord for a number of years, you may have studied that book in the past.
[time=2692] You may be familiar with its great truth and just the idea may really excite you as it
[time=2698] does us because we're aware of what that book contains.
[time=2701] Others, if you may not know where James is, no big deal.
[time=2704] That's all right.
[time=2705] That's why we're here to help you better understand God's Word and the impact that it can have on your everyday life.
[time=2712] Why should you be so interested in a 10-week study of the book of James?
[time=2715] Well, it answers some amazing questions.
[time=2718] Here's one.
[time=2719] How should a Christ follower?
[time=2721] How should a Christ follower respond to...watch this.
[time=2725] Here's the things we'll be dealing with, trials, temptation, God's Word, wealth and poverty,
[time=2731] conflict in the church and suffering, those and more.
[time=2736] What should our response be?
[time=2738] What should our mindset be?
[time=2740] How should we, as Christ followers, people who have said, "I'm in.
[time=2743] I've surrendered my heart and life and I want to live my life the way God and His Word call me to." Well, James helps you understand how to respond to those things.
[time=2753] James, as we go through it kind of passage by passage, will unfold for you.
[time=2757] We believe life-changing truth.
[time=2759] So don't miss it.
[time=2760] January 26 is when that begins and we are really looking forward to that.
[time=2764] Hey, I want to do something here.
[time=2767] I'm going to take a few minutes, but believe me, I put some thought into it and we've talked about it and we really believe for us, it is really going to be worth it because these people are so worth it.
[time=2779] To me, to those on our team, and I want to just give you a chance as a family to hear in these next few minutes, thank some people who really are deserving of our thanks.
[time=2791] If I'm going to move this over here a little bit.
[time=2792] If you were in any way, shape or form, I mean in any way at all, if you volunteered your
[time=2802] time, your energy, your effort, in any capacity for what this church rallied together and
[time=2810] offered this community in December, and we called it Christmas with Blackhawk, a community
[time=2816] of hope, and what God allowed us to do, what God strengthened you and I and others to do
[time=2823] was an amazing thing.
[time=2825] Over 10,000 people came and were able to witness and be a part of, and I was so very proud of this place and its people and our effort.
[time=2833] And if you sang, if you built something, if you fed us meals, if you took care of kids,
[time=2840] if you sold crafts, if you didn't, I mean if you did anything to help us bring that effort
[time=2848] to this family and you didn't get paid, we're thanking our paid people often and in other
[time=2855] ways this setting is for those who volunteered.
[time=2857] Would you please, now don't be embarrassed and don't make me start calling names because I know most of you, all right?
[time=2863] I want you to get up and come up here right now, get up right where you're at and come stand up here with me.
[time=2868] And nobody clapped yet, everybody just be quiet, we're going to do something pretty special here.
[time=2872] Come on up, everybody who helped, come on out of the balcony, come down the sides, just come on up here on this stage and stand, if you would right up here, hey gang, what
[time=2883] took place during the month of December, it was worked on and prepared for seven, eight
[time=2889] months in advance, come on up, thank you, don't anybody be shy, please come on up here,
[time=2896] if you were a greeter, if you were an angel, if you were, whatever you did, please come
[time=2903] up on stage, come on make room, scoot back, scoot over, get up on the choir risers if
[time=2909] you have to, if you ran a camera, if you did sound, don't mess with those, there we go,
[time=2920] wow.
[time=2921] Now, as they're making their way on the stage, I want you folks to just look with me to the screen, there were some hundreds of cards that were turned in, and if you need to come
[time=2930] across the front here folks, that's fine, if you need to come across on these steps, that's a good thing, hey sweetie, how are you, yeah it counts you in, good girl, come on up there, you okay, all right, come on in here, we had cards that were turned in,
[time=2945] and I want to just share with you some of the responses that we had, as these people
[time=2951] and some others who were in here first hour gave themselves, look at what God did with it, okay, just read through some of these, this person says awesome, awesome, awesome, keep it up, reserve seating is a big plus, next person says after years of attending the living Christmas tree, we were in wonder, this was an excellent replacement, amazed
[time=2972] at the talent coming from non-professionals, don't be hurt by that statement, I think that was a compliment, it's, enjoy, enjoy the program every year in a big thank you, somebody
[time=2984] else wrote in, the performance was outstanding, you're meant to, okay, skip that part, your people were friendly, it felt like home, I love it when I hear that, it felt like home, thank you, somebody else said thanks for all your efforts through the years, we look forward to the tradition of traveling to Fort Wayne for your performance each year, can't imagine not coming, your program left me breathless and speechless, God bless, best contemporary
[time=3009] Christmas program I've ever, I've seen great testimony, yeah, now what I just want you
[time=3018] to understand and I believe most of you do, okay, but some of you may not, hours and hours
[time=3025] of time, energy and effort were given so that over 10,000 people in the end could hear the
[time=3034] life changing, eternity altering message of Jesus, the real story of Christmas and these
[time=3040] people and others gave those hours, didn't get paid a cent, but because of their love
[time=3047] for God and their love for this place and their commitment to you and our desire to provide our very best effort, non-professional or whatever it was, I just want you to understand, we
[time=3059] don't do this very well around here, we're going to work on this, we need to thank people, we need to thank people for what they do and whether it's the December effort or whether it's another effort in the future, we'll keep working at this, but here's what I want you to do, I want you to stand in just a second and we're going to together just say a phrase,
[time=3079] we're going to say from our hearts to people who gave hours and hours well done, good and faithful servants, we're going to say from our hearts and you're going to say it really loud because they deserve to hear it, we're going to say it really loud because I believe it will bring honor to God and we're going to say well done, good and faithful servants and then we're going to thank Him and I want your thanks to lift the roof off this place, alright because again because of God's strength, because of God's effort here and His using
[time=3109] of these people, amazing things took place and I am so grateful for this group right here,
[time=3115] so would you stand with me quietly and would you just, I'll just go one, two, three and would you from the bottom of your heart with this wonderful group of folks in front of you, would you just from the bottom of your heart say well done, good and faithful servants and then we'll thank them, okay, you ready? G, are you there? Are you ready? Alright one,
[time=3136] two, three, well done, good and faithful servants, thank them, thank them, go ahead, thank them,
[time=3145] whew, yeah thank them for everything they did, everything they gave, whew, guys are the
[time=3162] best, amen, hey great job family, great job, great job, okay you guys can sit down, thank
[time=3175] you so much for coming up, I think that was worth it, alright got you babe, yep, good
[time=3182] job, yep, you're bad, hey let me say this while they're sitting down, I got Dean, thanks,
[time=3194] yeah, let me just say this while they're sitting down, you know when we decided last
[time=3202] year after 25 years of a wonderful tradition, after 25 years of a form, a living Christmas
[time=3216] tree, you know that God used to reach so many people, we knew that when we again having
[time=3222] thought about it, having prayed about it, having kind of tossed it back and forth and when we decided to try something just a little different as far as the form goes, function was the same, same message, same truth, same voices, you know, same instruments, we just
[time=3239] knew that it would be a challenge, I mean we knew that there would be things about that that would be challenging, my mind went to a guy named Gene Bartow, forgive me my athleticism
[time=3252] kind of comes out every once in a while and my sports trivia thing just kind of kicks
[time=3258] in, some of you may know the name, let me just tell you real quick, Gene Bartow was the coach
[time=3264] that UCLA hired to replace John Wooden when he retired, John Wooden was the greatest college
[time=3273] basketball coach to ever walk the face of the earth, John Wooden won more national championships,
[time=3279] John Wooden had more winning streaks, John Wooden was a god in the college basketball
[time=3285] arena and he was at UCLA for 25 years, maybe 26, he was a tradition, he was a legend and
[time=3294] it was time for him to just kind of quietly step aside and allow basketball to continue to be played and they hired a guy named Gene Bartow, Gene Bartow was fired two years later
[time=3308] after having gone 52 and 9, it's tough to follow a legend but you do it and you do it
[time=3320] with everything you have and you do it with all the energy and all the hope that God will use it and you do it together and on you go and you're so very thankful for the tradition
[time=3332] that got you there and you're so very hopeful that he'll give you more years and more opportunity and you know I hear a little here and I hear a little there and maybe some discouragement
[time=3345] setting in over numbers or attendance, hey just let me just tell you this, you will never,
[time=3351] ever catch me or anybody on our team discouraged that we got to share the gospel with 10,400
[time=3360] people, it's just never going to happen, there's just nothing negative about it at all, yeah
[time=3372] and 10,400 is different than 18,000 that's true, it's tough, it's challenging you know
[time=3380] to follow a legend but you keep at it and I want to remind you what Paul said, open your Bibles to 1 Corinthians chapter 1, would you do that please, if you brought one just open it up if you don't, welcome to look on with somebody else, just probably a good time for us just to make sure that we remind ourselves of what Paul said here, 1 Corinthians chapter
[time=3404] 1 verse 10, it says in 1 Corinthians chapter 1 verse 2 it says to the church of God which
[time=3417] is at Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, saints by calling with all who in every place call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours, this is written folk to a church just like this, this is written to a bunch of believers, a bunch of folks who have surrendered their hearts and lives and now they are in the midst of doing what we're trying to do each and every day here which is be a church that honors God and honors each other and fulfills the great commission and some things were going
[time=3446] on in Corinth and so Paul writes in chapter 1 verse 10, look down just a few verses, Paul says this, he says now I exhort you, remember the word exhort, remember that word
[time=3457] we talked about it before, exhort means exhorts, it's like a word of encouragement with a little
[time=3465] bit of boot if you get my drift, right, it's a word of encouragement but it's got a little bit of pop to it, it's kind of saying to the church, hey, hey, time out, wait a minute,
[time=3478] be careful now, listen to me, he says, I'm exhorting you, now I exhort you brethren by
[time=3486] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, here's the phrase that got me, that you all agree,
[time=3494] do you see that, that you all, look at me for a second, he just said all, I think he said
[time=3501] all, did he say all, he said all, he exhorts us to all, not most, not some, but he exhorts
[time=3510] all of us to agree, now you know what, a lot of times if you get right down to it, this
[time=3521] happens in our own team here, there are times when in our own team we don't, right, we just
[time=3531] don't, there's times where as we meet in that meeting that I pointed out to you and we talk about this place and this family and this ministry and we talk about future direction, whether it's an elder board meeting or a leadership, there's times when we're bottom line down deep inside we don't agree and if it's a biblical issue well then we're going to have
[time=3552] to hash that out but on non-biblical issues where decisions need to be made, sometimes
[time=3560] we don't always agree but in the end guess what we do, we agree because we're in this
[time=3567] together and opinions get shared and thoughts get contemplated and discussions are had
[time=3573] but in the end we agree and Paul says hey folks, oh be careful here, he says I exhort
[time=3584] you that you all agree and there be no divisions among you but you be made complete in the
[time=3593] same mind and in the same judgment for I have been informed concerning you my brethren
[time=3599] by Chloe's people that there are quarrels among you, I'm so thankful that that's not
[time=3605] the case very often around here, I'm so grateful for your spirit and your willingness to move
[time=3613] together, he says I hear that there are quarrels among you, now I mean this, that each one
[time=3619] of you is saying I am of Paul and others of you are saying well I am of Apollos and others still saying I am of Cephas and some saying well I am of Christ and Paul says in verse 13 wait a minute has Christ been divided, did I miss something, wasn't this all about
[time=3636] him, wasn't this all about ministry, wasn't this all about the great commission, wasn't this all about things that really matter since when did it become about camps Paul says and
[time=3649] I'm so very grateful, so very thankful that the more and more we spend life together
[time=3657] and do ministry together here it just feels more and more campless but be careful, you
[time=3664] know be careful any time we you know make big changes or go in new directions, there's
[time=3671] the temptation to say I am of the tree, well I am of community of hope and well I am you
[time=3679] know and it's just not us and it's just not what we're about and I just want to say thank
[time=3685] you, I think by and large this family as a whole radically embraced and agreed and gave
[time=3691] an enormous effort and you just saw them and you just thanked them and I am so grateful that God gives us the opportunity to do that together, so stay together, all right, stay
[time=3703] together, Blackhawk in 2003 get a pin out would you, a few more minutes here hang with
[time=3709] me I want you to write something down I want to just kind of set the stage for you as far as where we're going and the rest of this morning and then to next week as well, get a pin out, get a piece of paper back to your bulletin, scratch paper just get something out please each one of you that you can write on would you just write this down, write down Blackhawk in 2003 and then write this phrase a relentless pursuit would you please write
[time=3735] that down you're going to hear that you're going to hear that a lot, a relentless pursuit would you write that down Blackhawk in 2003 and then in quotes just write down your piece
[time=3746] of paper a relentless pursuit a relentless pursuit I want to talk to you this morning
[time=3753] God's just laid it on my heart to kind of do business with myself in this arena in recent
[time=3759] months and I want to talk to you about it this morning and Mitch and I are going to come back next week and do some things with you as well a relentless pursuit think about that
[time=3769] word pursuit what are the pursuits in your life look like today how would you be described
[time=3779] in your pursuing of whatever it might be and we'll talk a little bit more about that here coming up in your pursuing kind of a pursuer are you and I want to challenge you
[time=3790] this morning I want to invite you to consider along with me in the days and weeks and months
[time=3796] to come in 2003 I want to really invite you to consider what a relentless pursuit would
[time=3803] look like for you and here's the thought that's running through my mind I was at a conference recently I heard a pastor tell the story and I might miss a few things but the gist of
[time=3814] it was this he had gotten home early that day from work and his arrival at home early had
[time=3821] enabled him to intercept the male which was a good thing because he had a wife and an older daughter in the house and he was then able to this was like back in October he was able to intercept all the catalogs that had come in the mail that day and you know how it is just stacks of catalogs that just send good people like you and I way into you know trouble so anyway he talks about taking this stack of junk mail into his garage and he
[time=3847] pulls the big you know pulls the big bend back and he talks about just flipping catalog after catalog into the garbage can catalog after catalog and then all of a sudden boom there it is the white postcard that you get I get him too.
