[time=179] (upbeat music) - Hi, I'm Mitch and this is Kelly.
[time=184] We're pastors at Black Hawk Ministries and what we're bringing you today is a combination of two services.
[time=190] A couple of weeks ago, Kelly introduced an idea that I think is important in all of our lives.
[time=195] It's a relentless pursuit.
[time=198] A relentless pursuit is something that all of us engage in.
[time=203] That was the interesting thing as we thought about it and talked about it.
[time=206] You and I, no matter who we are or where we live, we are relentlessly, energetically and oftentimes passionately pursuing something.
[time=216] Our hope is that as you listen today, you would be encouraged and challenged to consider a relentless pursuit of the one who relentlessly pursued you, a relentless pursuit of our Lord.
[time=229] - Black Hawk in 2003, get a pin out, would you?
[time=234] A few more minutes here, hang with me.
[time=235] I want you to write something down.
[time=237] I want to just kind of set the stage for you as far as where we're going and the rest of this morning and then to next week as well.
[time=243] Get a pin out, get a piece of paper, back of your bulletin, a scratch paper, just get something out, please.
[time=249] Each one of you that you can write on.
[time=251] Would you just write this down, write down Black Hawk in 2003 and then write this phrase, a relentless pursuit.
[time=259] Would you please write that down?
[time=261] You're gonna hear that, you're gonna hear that a lot.
[time=264] A relentless pursuit, would you write that down?
[time=267] Black Hawk in 2003 and then in quotes, just write down your piece of paper, a relentless pursuit, a relentless pursuit.
[time=277] I want to talk to you this morning.
[time=279] God's just laid it on my heart to kind of do business with myself in this arena in recent months and I want to talk to you about it this morning and Mitch and I are gonna come back next week and do some things with you as well.
[time=290] A relentless pursuit.
[time=294] Think about that word pursuit.
[time=295] What are the pursuits in your life look like today?
[time=301] How would you be described in your pursuing of whatever it might be and we'll talk a little bit more about that here coming up and your pursuing kind of a pursuer are you and I want to challenge you this morning.
[time=316] I want to invite you to consider along with me in the days and weeks and months to come in 2003.
[time=323] I want to really invite you to consider what a relentless pursuit would look like for you.
[time=330] And here's the thought that's running through my mind.
[time=333] I was at a conference recently, I heard a pastor tell the story and I might miss a few things but the gist of it was this.
[time=341] He had gotten home early that day from work and his arrival at home early had enabled him to intercept the male which was a good thing because he had a wife and an older daughter in the house and he was then able to, this was like back in October, he was able to intercept all the catalogs that had come in the mail that day and you know how it is, just stacks of catalogs that just send good people like you and I away into trouble.
[time=367] So anyway, he talks about taking this stack of junk mail into his garage and he pulls the big, pulls the big bin back and he talks about just flipping catalog after catalog into the garbage can.
[time=380] Catalog after catalog and then all of a sudden, boom, there it is, the white postcard that you get.
[time=387] I get him too, there's two, three little pictures on him and he did with that little postcard, the postcard that gets sent out signifying missing children.
[time=401] He did what I do too many times, he just flipped it.
[time=407] Well, something kind of caught his eye and what caught his eye was the card just kind of doing the flutter thing down to the bottom of the garbage can and as it lands, so happens to land with the, on this card, there were two little faces peering back up at him from the bottom of the garbage and he just kind of stepped back and thought, wow, wait a minute, what's going on here?
[time=430] What did I just do?
[time=431] You see what dawned on him was that those two faces, see he was a dad, he had an older girl inside and a younger son and what dawned on him was that those two faces had dads who one day had gotten a call that these little ones had been taken
[time=453] and what kind of came over him was this very clear picture of what he would have done, if in fact that had happened to his own kids, the magnitude of the search, the energy with which it would have been given, the lengths to which he would have gone, the posters that would have been printed, the notes that would have been sent, the pleas for help, the sleepless nights because they meant that much.
[time=482] So I just want to invite you to think this morning about what means that much to you.
[time=491] What is it in your life?
[time=493] What is it in your days that really means a lot to you?
[time=497] Because whatever it is, you and I, we will pursue it relentlessly.
[time=503] And I want to just as we kind of close this morning and we move toward next week, I want to just show you because it really happened, it really existed.
[time=513] There was a band of Christ followers whose relentless pursuit of him, their relentless pursuit of each other and their relentless pursuit of their mission.
[time=527] They allowed them, got to allow them through their relentless efforts and pursuit to see unbelievable things happen.
[time=535] And it's the very first church that ever existed.
[time=538] Open your Bibles to Acts 2.
[time=540] And let me just show you a picture.
[time=542] We'll kind of paint it briefly here.
[time=544] And we're going to jump back in next week to a band of Christ followers whose pursuit was absolutely relentless.
[time=552] What will yours be like?
[time=554] In the coming year, what words will be used?
[time=557] What phrases would we choose to describe the kind of pursuit that you give him, each other and our mission?
[time=568] Look at Acts chapter two, verse 41.
[time=572] It says there so then those who had received his word stop right there, let me just backtrack.
[time=576] Peter had given what is basically known as the first sermon ever given.
[time=580] And as Peter delivers this powerful sermon, they're there in Jerusalem, 3,000 people it says.
[time=587] Come to faith.
[time=588] So then those who had received his word were baptized and there were added that day about 3,000 souls.
[time=593] And they were, watch this now, and they were continually, relentlessly, devoting themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.
[time=605] This is the church coming together.
[time=607] This is the apostles' teaching folks.
[time=609] This is the word of God being taught, being received, being injected into the hearts and lives of these people.
[time=616] They were pursuing him, his truth, his word.
[time=620] And everyone kept feeling a sense of awe, verse 43.
[time=628] And many wonders and signs were taking place through the apostles and all those who had believed were together and had all things in common.
[time=635] And they began selling their property and possessions and were sharing them with all.
[time=639] Has anyone might have need?
[time=640] And day by day continuing with one mind, not two, not five, not seven with one mind in the temple.
[time=648] They were breaking bread from house to house and they were taking their meals together with gladness and sincerity of heart.
[time=656] You see that?
[time=658] A relentless pursuit of each other.
[time=660] A love that ran so deep, a commitment that was so severe that it led them to live together in relationship as part of that body in a way that was absolutely inconceivable, the love and the commitment and the devotion to each other was so rich and so true.
[time=681] And they were praising God, verse 47, and having favor with all the people.
[time=687] And the Lord was adding to their number day by day those who were being saved.
[time=693] The Lord was adding to their number.
[time=695] And that's right, we know that the Lord, we know him to be the author of our faith.
[time=701] We know him to be the one that initiates salvation.
[time=704] But he's using these people in this church and their relentless pursuit of what he said back in Acts 1, 8.
[time=711] You can just turn one page over, Acts 1, 8.
[time=713] He said, you shall, but you shall receive power.
[time=716] When the Holy Spirit has come upon you and you shall, here you go, here's their mission.
[time=720] You shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem and all of Judea and Samaria and even to the remotest part of the earth.
[time=729] And they had begun to faithfully give themselves relentlessly to vote themselves to that and he's adding to their number day by day.
[time=737] But what I wanna say to you here is this and Corbin, why don't you come on up and we'll get ready here to close.
[time=745] I wanna just say this to you, I sometimes, not very often, it takes a bit to kinda get me off track.
[time=754] But you know every once in a while, I'll get discouraged about this.
[time=759] I'll read this or I'll be in some kind of setting where we're talking about that church and those people and that kind of focus and that kind of passion, that kind of pursuit.
[time=775] And I hear people say, you know what, Kelly, that was then.
[time=779] That's not today.
[time=782] I'll hear folks tell me, you know, it's just different today.
[time=786] It's just not gonna happen.
[time=789] There's too many competing interests, there's people won't stay that focused.
[time=794] There's too many other things going on and you know what, I just don't wanna say to that, yeah, I don't believe that.
[time=799] I don't believe that.
[time=801] And I see God at work and you here all the time and I see powerful bits and pieces of this that thrills my soul and it leads me to believe that it can happen, that a world can be changed when faithful followers of Christ are relentless and very focused in their pursuit of him, him and each other and their mission.
[time=829] And so please come back next week, come back and bring your pens and something to write on and bring your Bible and we're gonna open up God's word and we're gonna look at what it would be like for you and me to have a relentless pursuit of our God, each other
[time=845] and this mission that he's given us to be a part of, would you just stand and would you sing as Corbin leads us?
[time=851] - Hey, we're back and we wanted to just before we went forward, explain to you briefly kind of what you're about to see here as this idea of a relentless pursuit that we spoke of earlier, as that developed over the coming week, we felt really compelled to kind of break that down and to address some specifics of what a relentless pursuit looks like.
[time=875] And so we began with the most important component and that is your willingness in mind to pursue him with a relentless passion.
[time=884] You know, it talks in Jeremiah about and it talks in Proverbs about the kind of pursuit that would entail you and I giving our entire heart, our entire being, a pursuit of God that stretches us and moves us and takes us to places with him that we've never been before and that's the kind of energy he longs for from those who would pursue him.
[time=908] We also talked about a relentless pursuit of each other, the fact that you mean enough to me and hopefully I mean enough to you, the body of Christ is so committed to each other that we will relentlessly give ourselves to each other, loving, coming alongside, encouraging and supporting as best we can, those in the body of Christ and those that God brings across our path, a relentless pursuit of him and a relentless pursuit of each other.
[time=934] - And because I relentlessly pursue God,
[time=940] I will in fact relentlessly pursue others.
[time=943] That's the great commandment.
[time=944] Jesus says you can't do one without the other and when I do those things, I begin to pursue the mission of God.
[time=954] Jesus said I came to seek and save that which is lost and he asked the church to go do the same thing and so our mission here at BlackHog is to help seekers both saved and searching.
[time=965] That's everybody, find and follow Christ and there is no higher goal.
[time=974] There is no other ordained activity than what God has in store for a heart-to-heart relationship like that mission.
[time=983] - Today we're concluding our series but we're not gonna stop bearing the torch on relentless pursuit, relentless pursuit.
[time=993] Kelly started talking about it last week, relentless pursuit of him, relentless pursuit of each other and relentless pursuit of our mission.
[time=1003] So I'd just like to share with you just a little window into my life the way it used to look.
[time=1008] I am driven to the core and back in the late '80s, Reggie Jackson, who was a customer of ours and a friend of ours, had a fire in his warehouse where he had part of his car collection.
[time=1020] He had about 40 or 50 cars in Central California, the rest were in Southern California, so I called him.
[time=1027] Evidently a furniture store next door thrown flammable rags in a corner and they caught fire and his entire car collection of very rare, very desirable muscle cars was gone, poof, in that one location, 40 or 50 cars just gone.
[time=1043] So I called him, I said, Reggie, I think that I have the solution to this problem and he goes, what's that?
[time=1050] I said, there's a collection in North Carolina, few people know about it, know where it is and I said, but I've gotten to know the guy and I don't know, we just have to hit him just right, but I think it's just amazing how car for car resembles what you had that we could, at one shot, replace your whole car collection.
[time=1068] And he says, that sounds good and I'm just pursuing the deal, I'm so driven and I wanna make sure that he's not gonna like forget this 'cause you know, baseball and all over the country and stuff and I said, well, why don't you come to our Labor Day weekend event, this was about 86, 87, as back when Reggie was like the Michael Jordan of our day to day and I said, come to the auction and then we'll fly down there, I'll have a private plane waiting for us and we'll fly down there after the auction's over and we'll just see what we can do.
[time=1098] And so Reggie said he would do it and he came to the auction, it was really cool to have him around because he makes things happen, he bid on hundreds of cars and he bought several and then it was time to go.
[time=1108] We had auction for Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday with auction a little bit Thursday, five days straight.
[time=1114] So I wanna warn out, but I am not gonna lose the deal.
[time=1118] I am not gonna lose the deal because he could go home and I could read about somebody else selling him cars.
[time=1125] So I wasn't gonna let that happen and we got on that private plane and we flew down there to North Carolina and the guy didn't even have lights for his building, it's dark, it's a middle of the night and so he had some kids rig up lights for that and we started looking at all these great cars, including a ZL1 Camaro and when they turned that thing on and he went, "Ram, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop." That's just what Reggie did, he goes, did you hear that, "Ram, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop." And I'm thinking, yes, we're gonna do this deal.
[time=1152] So we looked at the cars, but one a.m. we go to Denny's and I think, well, my dad always told me you never have a deal until you get it signed up.
[time=1160] And so I'm relentlessly pursuing the deal and the agreement.
[time=1166] We get that done, we hammer that out about 3 a.m.
[time=1169] And Reggie's gonna buy all those cars at one shot.
[time=1172] Well, now I gotta make sure he pays for him, right?
[time=1175] So we get on the plane, I take him back to O'Hare and I'm working all that out, halfway sleeping, halfway talking and I love him man, he takes off from O'Hare and I go home and at 6 a.m.
[time=1188] I got home, went to my little house at that time, went to bed and thought, "Yeah, what a rush." The adrenaline of the deal, I was addicted to it.
[time=1200] What a rush.
[time=1201] - Question for you, all right?
[time=1203] You may not be selling Reggie Jackson cars, but it's not the point.
[time=1209] Question for you is this, there is something in your life.
[time=1212] There is something in your life.
[time=1217] There is some situation in your life that has the capacity to do to you what the deal did to him for so many years.
[time=1226] What is it that so many times, maybe you find yourself relentlessly in a driven, focused, frenzied state kind of going after.
[time=1238] What is it?
[time=1240] - You know what's happening?
[time=1244] - Yeah.
[time=1244] - Non-pursuit is pursuit.
[time=1247] - Absolutely.
[time=1248] - I remember sitting in a stoplight in Auburn when I was trying to decide whether or not I was going to do my doctorate.
[time=1252] And it just hit me, just like came over me, he's like the spirit of God said, you know you're going to spend the next two, three years getting a doctorate in something, going to the beach, you know, watching movies, you know, hanging out with friends, you're going to spend that time doing something.
[time=1266] So why not God?
[time=1268] - What's your pursuit?
[time=1269] What is it that really stirs your heart?
[time=1272] And our hope is, and our prayer has been, as we've thought this through, I mean just personally as a team around here and we're going to keep thinking this through and keep talking this through as a team around here for weeks and months to come.
[time=1284] But we want to invite you in 2003 to consider what it might look like and what it might be like for you to give yourself to a relentless pursuit.
[time=1295] Not of the deal, and not of him or her, no matter how cute they might be, no matter how much fun you might have, not the grades and not the job and not the hobby, none of those things are bad.
[time=1310] But what's the real pursuit going to be?
[time=1313] And we want to invite you to consider this year your relentless pursuit beginning with him.
[time=1320] Him, each other and our mission, and we'll start this morning.
[time=1324] Get out your pins, please, write some of these things down.
[time=1327] Your relentless pursuit of him.
[time=1330] You know folks, this is where it begins.
[time=1332] Any other pursuit is useless.
[time=1336] Any other pursuit will fall short.
[time=1338] Any other activity in your life or mind will pale, will diminish, will fade if there isn't a willingness in your heart and mind to first and foremost be relentlessly pursuing him.
[time=1350] You know God's word gives us some wonderful pictures of this.
[time=1354] God's word paints for you and I an incredible picture of what real wholehearted pursuit of him looks like.
[time=1362] So as you look at this this morning, we just want to ask you to do what we've been trying to do ourselves and that is be brutally and blatantly honest with yourself about what your pursuit of him looks like.
[time=1374] Look with us to the scriptures.
[time=1376] We'll begin in Jeremiah.
[time=1377] Turn back there to Jeremiah chapter 29, back in your Old Testament there.
[time=1382] And Jeremiah chapter 29, it says in Jeremiah chapter 29, 11.
[time=1393] It says, "For I know the plans that I have for you declares the Lord.
[time=1397] Plans for welfare and not for calamity to give you a future and a hope." And it says in verse 12, "Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you." And then Jeremiah 29, 13, "And you will seek me.
[time=1413] And you will find me when you search for me with all your heart." Your heart, the very core of your being when he says, "When you search for me, when you seek me, when you come after me," he says, "with all of your heart, not half, not part of, not sort of." But all of it, he says, "You'll find me." Look what it says in Proverbs.
[time=1437] Proverbs chapter 8, verse 17, it says, "I love those who love me and those who diligently seek me." Underline that word.
[time=1445] Mark it there in your Bible.
[time=1447] Make a note.
[time=1448] And those who diligently seek me will find me.
[time=1454] Here's the point there, all right?
[time=1456] Just for many of you, this is just a reminder.
[time=1459] For others of you, it might be kind of an eye-opener, but it's basic, a truth as it is.
[time=1464] Please don't miss it.
[time=1465] People, you are pursuit of him and the deepened relationship that comes with that, it doesn't just happen.
[time=1474] You don't just wish for it and then kind of go about life, and it doesn't just appear.
[time=1479] No, there is a sense where he calls you and I to a relentless pursuit of him.
[time=1484] I've realized this lately in my own life.
[time=1487] I have struggled like many of you have struggled for years as it relates to my time with God.
[time=1496] I have struggled for years trying to understand how that could work better, how that could be more consistent, how it could be more unique and special as I would kind of try somehow, some way, to get these times with him.
[time=1509] And there were times in my life where it was better and there were times in my life where it wasn't so good.
[time=1514] But you know what?
[time=1514] I've realized something in the last year.
[time=1518] I've realized, and I'll just be real honest with you here, but for me, we've got five children now at the house, and we're still very thankful for that.
[time=1527] It makes for an incredible sight, I'll tell you.
[time=1530] And in the morning, as I began to think this through, as the months have gone by, I realized something.
[time=1534] I realized that the kids that go to school need to be here by about eight.
[time=1540] So that means we need to leave our house by about 745, 740, we'll say.
[time=1546] Well, to leave our house by 740, that means they all have to be getting up, getting dressed, getting bathed, getting backpacks together, getting lunches.
[time=1554] All that's going to have to begin about 625.
[time=1560] And if I'm going to, and Deborah's going to kind of together partner on that whole effort, we kind of have to be, well, at least me, I've got to be ready for the day.
[time=1568] I can't get up at 620 and be expecting all that to go on.
[time=1571] So that means I've got to get up to get me showered and ready by about 530.
[time=1578] Well, then I'm realizing something.
[time=1581] Time with him, which has become very, very precious to me as I know it is to you as the years have gone by.
[time=1588] It's not going to happen for me with all I just described to you.
[time=1591] It's not going to happen for me at night.
[time=1593] I got news for you.
[time=1594] It may for you, and that's great.
[time=1596] But by 10 o'clock at night, I'm falling asleep in the middle of sentences, OK?
[time=1601] So it's not going to happen at night.
[time=1603] Unless the Raiders are on.
[time=1605] Unless the Raiders are on, then I'll stay up late.
[time=1607] But here's the deal.
[time=1609] So it dawns on me in this last year.
[time=1612] Then I'm not going to get up at 530.
[time=1617] Or it's not going to happen.
[time=1619] Now, hear me.
[time=1619] I'm not patting myself on the back.
[time=1622] And there's mornings that this is an incredible struggle.
[time=1624] But then I realized this.
[time=1626] I'm not going to make it at 5 unless I get some coffee.
[time=1628] So that means I'm going to have to-- so it's going to have to be 450.
[time=1633] 450.
[time=1635] I want to go.
[time=1637] A lot.
[time=1638] So here's the deal.
[time=1640] I need you to pray for me because I'm not going to have time with God.
[time=1646] It's not going to happen unless I faithfully with his help and your prayers and I'll pray for you and you pray for me.
[time=1655] Get up at 450 and pray for me, all right?
[time=1658] Because it's not going to happen.
[time=1660] And this last year has been an absolute revelation for me.
[time=1664] And I have tried and I'm going to keep trying.
[time=1667] And there's days and weeks that go better than others.
[time=1669] But it doesn't just happen, gang.
[time=1672] He says, "Pursue me with everything you've got." What else does he say?
[time=1679] Well, I think the point we're making here is it's active and it's intentional.
[time=1684] It's not passive, and it's not going to happen by accident.
[time=1687] It's active and intentional.
[time=1689] James, Jesus' half-brother writes, and James 4a, "Come near to God, and he will come near to you."
[time=1697] You know, we all say, "Oh, I just wish God would tell me this," or, "I just wish he would show me this." Well, "Come near to God, and he will come near to you." One translation says, "Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you." It sounds like a journey, doesn't it, rather than an event?
[time=1713] It's a journey.
[time=1714] And it's a journey that's a reflective of a heart condition.
[time=1716] And what hearts that?
[time=1718] Well, in that same text in James 4, it's "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble." They're quoting Proverbs 3.34.
[time=1725] And in verse 10 there, he says, "Humble yourselves before the Lord.
[time=1729] Humble your heart toward God.
[time=1731] Soften your heart toward him, and he will lift you up." If you want to turn there, it will come on the screen.
[time=1737] Psalm 63, verse one says, "Oh God, you are my God.
[time=1743] Earnestly, I seek you.
[time=1745] My soul thirsts for you.
[time=1748] Thirst." You can all picture what that feels like, can't you?
[time=1753] You know, thirst is just a word, but it describes that panning, that longing.
[time=1757] You know, after it will work out, or in David's case here when he's writing this, "In the desert, my soul thirsts for you.
[time=1765] My body longs for you, oh God, in the dry and weary land where there is no water." It's active and it's intentional.
[time=1775] Based on the hurry thing, I did a couple weeks ago.
[time=1780] It reminded me of something I did in my life a few years ago, and I call it the five-minute principle.
[time=1785] I could just write that down, the five-minute principle, it's good.
[time=1788] And here's what I decided to do.
[time=1790] I would try to be five minutes early for every appointment that year.
[time=1794] Any encounter I had, even if it was social, I'd try to be five minutes early, and I would do this, whether in my car or wherever it was, in a room alone, in a meeting room, wherever that was.
[time=1803] And I'd say, God, what is it that you want me to do here?
[time=1807] Is there anything kingdom related that's going on here that I need to open my eyes and ears and my heart to?
[time=1813] And I call it the five-minute principle.
[time=1816] And I'm telling you that I wasn't always five minutes early, but thinking through that five minutes before every encounter radically changed my life and how I approached different encounters with people and started, I began to see them as a divine encounter, as a divine encounter.
[time=1831] And maybe with a phone call, especially an incoming one, maybe it's the five-second principle, but before you pick it up, God, what do you have in mind for me?
[time=1838] Pursuing him, relentlessly opening your heart to him and seeing what it is he has for you.
[time=1846] He's worth it.
[time=1847] Let me just get you to just write that down or just kind of store that there in the front page of your mind.
[time=1856] He's worth, he is so worth that kind of pursuit.
[time=1861] He's worth getting up early for him.
[time=1863] He's worth staying up late for, if that's your deal.
[time=1866] You know what, guys, men, he's worth getting up early and going to power equipment.
[time=1871] Our men's Bible study that meets on Thursday mornings at 6.30, almost 100 guys now coming to our men's Bible study
[time=1879] on Thursday morning or Thursday evenings in a desire to know, understand, and see him more clearly.
[time=1885] He's worth that kind of pursuit.
[time=1887] Ladies and whole new semester of precepts is starting to happen.
[time=1891] You can sign up today, and ladies, whoever you are, wherever you've been, whatever you've experienced, Wednesday mornings or Tuesday nights, you can come and relentlessly pursue and open your heart to a better, deeper understanding of him.
[time=1904] Ladies, it's worth adjusting your schedule.
[time=1906] It's worth doing whatever you have to do to come on Tuesday night or Wednesday mornings.
[time=1912] You know what, people, in your relentless pursuit of him, he's worth redoing your CD collection to put into your car or to put into your living room at home, some CDs that will remind you, that will paint a picture for you, that will allow you and your kids or your friends to have kind of brought before you things that matter.
[time=1935] Instead of stuff that doesn't, he's worth it.
[time=1938] He's worth it.
[time=1940] - Kelly, I like to point out that he is worthy and we are worth full.
[time=1945] He is worthy and we are worth full.
[time=1948] He is worthy because of who he is.
[time=1950] You and I are worth full because he says so.
[time=1954] It's not in and of ourselves.
[time=1955] It's all because of God.
[time=1957] - A relentless pursuit of him.
[time=1959] Write this one down, a relentless pursuit of each other.
[time=1963] Would you join us this year?
[time=1964] Would you give yourself to a relentless pursuit of each other?
[time=1970] And what we mean by that this morning is there's a lot that's involved, we realize, in the each others, the one in others of our world.
[time=1982] And we're all for that.
[time=1983] We want you this morning to just hear us here as we kind of hone in on kind of one specific facet of life with each other.
[time=1992] And that is this, I want to invite you, we want to invite you to a kind of pursuit that would lead you and me to be willing and ready in our lives to say things lovingly and appropriately, but nonetheless, a pursuit of each other that would lead you and I to be willing to say things.
[time=2015] Ask questions, move into the lives of others when we sense or when we know or when we think that there might be something awry, something amiss, something not quite right.
[time=2032] This is not a policing kind of thing.
[time=2034] I'm not saying that you and I walk around with these and whack people over the heads.
[time=2038] I'm saying, would you love me enough?
[time=2042] And would I love you enough to be willing to beg, plead, entreat, and urge?
[time=2050] Look what Paul says, we're gonna run through a few here.
[time=2054] Watch this, Ephesians 4-1.
[time=2057] Paul says in his letter to the Ephesians, "I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord." Paul says, "I entreat you," the word means, "to beg." He says, "I entreat you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called.
[time=2072] I urge you, therefore, brethren, Romans 12, I urge you, same thing, I beg you.
[time=2079] By the mercies of God to present your bodies, the living and holy sacrifice acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship.
[time=2086] See, as you read through the New Testament and you see Paul and you see Peter urging and begging oftentimes, it's just to continue to set before the people a reminder.
[time=2095] I can't help but think sometimes though, as they urge and beg people to do things, it's because the people that they're writing to maybe weren't doing them.
[time=2104] Does that make sense?
[time=2107] And so he hears from Chloe's people.
[time=2109] He hears from the church, I mean, he kept hearing things oftentimes, the Lord would inspire him to write.
[time=2116] And in his writing, he would urge.
[time=2118] In 1 Peter 2, it says, "Beloved, "I urge you, as aliens and strangers, "to abstain, maybe some weren't." And so he begs them to abstain from fleshly lusts which wage war against the soul.
[time=2131] Keep your behavior, he says, "Excellent among the Gentiles, "so that in the thing in which they slander you, "as evil doers, they may on account of your good deeds." 1 Peter 2, 12, as they observe them, glorify God in the day of visitation.
[time=2146] Look what it says in 1 Thessalonians.
[time=2148] And we urge you, we beg you, church at Thessalonica, admonish the unruly, encourage the faint-hearted, help the weak, be patient with all men.
[time=2160] And I am asking you, we are inviting you to a kind of commitment to each other that would be willing because you love each other enough because the people in this family mean enough to you.
[time=2177] I learned some things this summer.
[time=2179] And in recent months, I've drawn the biggest line in the sand I've ever drawn.
[time=2184] I've put the biggest stake I've ever planted on this issue.
[time=2189] There were some things that happened in my life this summer.
[time=2193] And maybe you've been there before too where with those and some I loved, you know, I sensed.
[time=2198] I kind of got a feeling.
[time=2201] You ever been there?
[time=2203] You sit with a good friend, you spend time doing this or that and you just get the sense.
[time=2208] And I didn't say anything.
[time=2211] Maybe sometimes you keep your mouth shut too because who are you and who am I to maybe ask this question or maybe probe a little further?
[time=2221] Well, all that means is I love myself more than you.
[time=2227] And I'm so committed to staying away from the uncomfortable situation or possibly being perceived by you as such that I'm going to just go ahead and keep my mouth shut and I'm not going to do it.
[time=2240] I'm not going to do it ever again.
[time=2242] I'm going to be loving and kind and I'm going to ask for God's grace and sensitivity.
[time=2246] But where I sense, I'll ask where I think I'll pursue
[time=2252] and I'll ask God for the grace and strength and humility and love to do that in a way that would be loving and kind.
[time=2259] But would you please consider that kind of pursuit of each other?
[time=2264] About 10 years ago, I was the one pursued.
[time=2269] I had sort of messed up my life there in the pilot seat.
[time=2276] And we kept this verse up here because I'm going to refer to it.
[time=2280] It says admonishing unruly encourage the faint hearted.
[time=2284] Well, I'm the faint hearted and I was encouraged by someone.
[time=2288] I wasn't slapped around, I wasn't hit over the head with a Bible, I was encouraged.
[time=2295] And someone came alongside me and put his arm around me and said, you know, I'm capable of everything that's going on in your life.
[time=2302] And he connected with me.
[time=2304] And he said, but you know, there's a better way.
[time=2307] And he encouraged me for that better way.
[time=2311] Kind of got my compass pointing back northward.
[time=2313] You know what I'm saying?
[time=2315] How's your compass doing?
[time=2317] Or is it pointing?
[time=2318] But we have a tendency to just go out there and we want to confront them, admonish them, but it's not that way with all people.
[time=2326] The Bible says that we should be wise about how we do this.
[time=2331] And I'm telling you, because this guy, it was my uncle, because he pursued him, he pursued Christ relentlessly.
[time=2339] Now because of that, he pursued me relentlessly.
[time=2345] [AMEN] And then when he pursued me relentlessly, what he did is he taught me how to pursue our third thing.
[time=2353] And that's the mission, the mission relentlessly.
[time=2357] You know, every organization has a mission statement.
[time=2360] Peter Drucker, the business guru, says that it should fit on a t-shirt or on a coffee mug.
[time=2366] And it answers the question, why do we exist?
[time=2370] What are we here to do?
[time=2372] And you know, I think Jesus was really, really clear.
[time=2375] Crystal, about what he was here for.
[time=2378] He says in John 10, 10, that I came so that you might have life and have it abundantly.
[time=2383] Too many times we reduce the gospel message to the fact that it's only about eternal life.
[time=2389] It's just about getting to have it.
[time=2390] No, no, no, no.
[time=2391] Heaven's a benefit of someone who is in Christ and in abundant life with Christ.
[time=2396] Made alive in him.
[time=2399] Jesus said in Luke 19, 10, "I have come to seek and to save that which is lost." And so every church, like Kelly said last week, every church, their mission, models the great commission that Jesus says in Matthew 28.
[time=2413] And I'm just gonna read it quickly here to you verses 18 through 20.
[time=2416] And Jesus came to them and said, "All authority and heaven on earth has been given to me.
[time=2421] "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, "baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son "and of the Holy Spirit and teaching them to obey everything.
[time=2431] "Everything I have commanded, see his life is so important.
[time=2435] "The life of Christ is the core idea.
[time=2438] "And are you in that life?" Because he says this, "And surely if you're in Christ, "I am with you always to the very end of the age "and the Greek I am surrounds you." That pretty I am surrounds you.
[time=2453] In many ways that is a gospel message.
[time=2455] That Christ is with us like we sang today.
[time=2459] Well, our mission here at Blackhawk is gonna come up on the screen.
[time=2464] Helping seekers both saved and searching to find and follow Christ.
[time=2471] Helping seekers, we call that everybody, both saved and searching to find and follow Christ.
[time=2479] That's our mission here.
[time=2481] That's our translation of the great commission, what it looks like here.
[time=2486] - Matthew 28, right there.
[time=2488] It's no different, just a few altered words, but that's the essence of it.
[time=2492] And that's why I get so excited about it.
[time=2495] Long before Peter Drucker and long before corporations were moving toward mission and vision.
[time=2500] Jesus, our Lord, said it.
[time=2504] And he gave us, he gave you, and he gave me, those of us that are in him, the greatest mission statement of all.
[time=2510] It is, you've heard us say, and we'll say it again.
[time=2512] It is the greatest endeavor of all.
[time=2516] And our hope is that you would be, more and more so as the days and weeks go by.
[time=2521] Watch this now.
[time=2522] Not just excited about a mission statement, but that you would be relentlessly pursuing him.
[time=2529] And you're everyday walk in relationship with him, because if you will, if you and I will really give ourselves to that relentless pursuit of him, what happens is he so fills your heart and life with truth and what is right.
[time=2547] He so encourages you and I in good directions that we turn around and we love each other with a love we've never seen before.
[time=2556] Your relentless pursuit of him becomes this relentless pursuit of each other.
[time=2561] I'll allow the great commandment, love the Lord God and love the people.
[time=2566] And when you're engaged and I'm engaged in those two things, you know what?
[time=2570] It doesn't take him or me or Steve or anybody else.
[time=2574] It doesn't take us standing here saying, "Hey, relentlessly pursue our mission." No, you just do it.
[time=2581] And I want to just invite you this morning.
[time=2585] I want to just invite you to consider one word.
[time=2588] The phrase is too big.
[time=2590] We'd be here for two weeks teaching through all of it.
[time=2593] But I want you to look at that first word, helping.
[time=2596] Would you look at that?
[time=2599] Helping.
[time=2600] And I want to remind you what it says here in Ephesians 4.
[time=2604] Ephesians 4, 11 and 12 says that the leadership of this church exists to equip, train and build you up.
[time=2613] You.
[time=2616] For the work of ministry.
[time=2618] For the building up of the body of Christ.
[time=2620] You.
[time=2621] Rolling up your sleeves and gauging your hearts and lives, your days and your nights and everything that falls in between.
[time=2629] And so I want to invite you, high school students and young adults and moms and dads and those on the other end down here.
[time=2637] I just want to, we want to stand here and say you know what?
[time=2640] There isn't any greater endeavor.
[time=2642] Would you pursue him like you never have before?
[time=2645] And if you need help, please ask.
[time=2647] We'll come alongside.
[time=2648] Would you pursue each other with a kind of love that absolutely defies the enemy's attempt to get you and I to look the other way when someone we love is floundering.
[time=2660] And would you be willing, watch this now, to get up every day and help.
[time=2666] Seeking people.
[time=2668] Find and follow him by saying, God, here I am.
[time=2671] Let me use my gifts.
[time=2674] Let me use this circumstance that you've placed me in.
[time=2677] You helping seekers find and follow means you and me getting up every day saying, oh God, please.
[time=2683] Allow me to point people toward you and every encounter somehow, someway.
[time=2688] God allow me to build a relationship possibly with somebody far from God.
[time=2693] God allow me to worship you, live life and relationship with you in such a way to trust you and follow you, to obey you in such a way that those in my world say, hey, where do you get the strength to keep moving forward?
[time=2709] How are you helping, not me, how are you helping him?
[time=2718] Is he, with his hand, moves through this place, assisting those seeking to find and follow him?
[time=2725] If you need some help, trying to figure that out, ask us.
[time=2729] There isn't anything like it.
[time=2732] We see it all the time.
[time=2733] We've seen it recently, even.
[time=2735] - Yeah, helping is a key word, not just practically, but theologically, whom are we helping?
[time=2740] We're helping the spirit of living God.
[time=2742] And John six, Jesus makes it abundantly clear that God is at work in every person's life, drawing him into himself.
[time=2750] And so he's ordained that we come alongside and that we do that.
[time=2754] We help them find and follow Christ.
[time=2756] And why Ephesians 123, the fullness of him, this is Christ, who fills everything in every way, who fills everything in every way.
[time=2769] I had a call here a few weeks ago right before Christmas and it's from Jason, and Jason made an appointment to come speak with me and we talked a little bit and it was time for me to go to common ground and he had something he had to go to.
[time=2783] And just something inside of me said, a little bit was experience, a little bit was a prompting of God.
[time=2790] Jason, you haven't asked me the question, you came to ask me, have you?
[time=2794] There's something inside of me said that.
[time=2795] And he said, no, and he finally started saying he had traveled abroad and he had said that, I just wonder how do those people know they are saved?
[time=2804] Are they?
[time=2806] And I thought, well, he really wants to know if he saved.
[time=2811] And he says, how do I even know if I'm saved?
[time=2814] I said, Jason, we both got to go, but let's meet back at eight o'clock, let's spend about 15, 20 minutes together and we'll do one or two things.
[time=2821] You'll either know that you're in or you'll have the opportunity to know that you're in.
[time=2826] And so I just pointed into the, I asked him to tell me his story.
[time=2829] I listened, there was so many areas where we overlapped and connected.
[time=2833] And I just took him to the Bible where John writes a couple times in Christ so that you know that you are saved.
[time=2842] And he prayed that night on a Wednesday night in a room here alone together so that he knows.
[time=2847] He's in the kingdom.
[time=2848] - I gotta call this week, last week actually, and had a chance early this week to meet with a young man, 29 years old.
[time=2855] And his name's Tom and Tom came in and we sat down and Tom let me know that on the very last night of Christmas with Black Ock, he had sat right here in the middle section at that 730 performance and had come with some friends and he said the moment he sat down didn't have any church background, didn't have any spiritual experience, had absolutely zip.
[time=2879] And at 29 comes in here and sits down and he said from the moment it started to the moment it ended, he felt this uncanny sense that God, who now all of a sudden was very real, was bringing him to himself.
[time=2892] Every line that got spoken, every song that got sung, he said, and then Susie does the bridge on the easel thing and I come up and speak and he says, by the time the whole thing was done, I was in.
[time=2903] And he came to my office and we sat and we talked and I heard his story and we prayed together and he surrendered his entire life to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2912] Steve met a guy just this week, Steve Longbreak.
[time=2915] The guy had just happened to turn on the Bible hour a couple weeks ago when Steve's message that Steve and I shared on heaven or Steve told the story about losing his wife.
[time=2925] This guy had lost his wife six years ago and had been unable to recover in any way, shape, or form, was just lost.
[time=2931] He heard God speaking through Steve, called and came and met with Steve and surrendered his heart and life to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2941] Amen?
[time=2943] Amen and you know what?
[time=2945] God doesn't need our help, but he chooses to let us help.
[time=2949] And I want you to help in whatever way you can and if you need help understanding that, please, come and let us give you some ideas, let us encourage you.
[time=2961] Why don't you stand, if you would, as we close this morning?
[time=2964] And as you stand, just know how this team of people that you have here, giving leadership and direction, we would love nothing more than to come alongside in whatever way we can to help you in your relentless pursuit of him, each other and our mission.
[time=2980] And I'm so glad we get to do it with you.
[time=2982] And I'm so glad you're not flying across the country anymore at three in the morning, trying to sell cars.
[time=2987] Glad you're meeting with the Jasons of this place and thankful that we get to do that together.
[time=2994] Can I just say that on that thing alone?
[time=2996] We're not asking you to fit something else in your life.
[time=3000] We're not asking you to try to make this work at this time and make that work at this time and fit something else into your schedule.
[time=3006] We're asking you to align your whole schedule for what you were created to do.
[time=3010] And that is to be in a relationship with Christ and relationship with others about his kingdom and your work becomes a playground for that.
[time=3017] - Absolutely.
[time=3018] - Let's pray.
[time=3019] God, we are so grateful for the chance, the privilege that is ours to come before you,
[time=3027] to come before you as a people that are reminded day in and day out, how desperately we need you, how desperately we need your touch and your reminder.
[time=3038] We need times like this of worship.
[time=3040] We need to be drawn back to the truth, to the scriptures that point us and teach us how to live life with purpose.
[time=3047] So God, as we walk out these doors, I pray, that our pursuit of you would be renewed and that our love for you would be such that we would realize the value of an earlier wake-up call, more time spent understanding you and asking for whatever help we might need to get that done.
[time=3068] God, that our love for each other would only intensify and that our commitment to what you're doing in this place would just grow, that sleeves would get rolled up all over this room, that people would like never before, take off their warm-ups and get in the game.
[time=3086] Get in deep, giving themselves completely to this incredible endeavor, the mission of the church.
[time=3093] Thank you, Father, for this time.
[time=3095] We love you.
[time=3096] In your son's name, we pray.
[time=3098] [AMEN] - Hi, I'm Kelly, pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=3104] And you know, as I talk with people and as you just kind of go through the day-to-day of life, you realize that there are certain things that people live for, I mean, legitimate stuff.
[time=3115] I mean, if you're a housewife, oftentimes, one of the greatest feelings you get is, you know, when the house gets cleaned and the laundry gets done and it all comes together, the kids get picked up and a day kind of goes by without a hitch.
[time=3129] And I mean, legitimately, that's a wonderful moment, you know?
[time=3134] There are those who are doctors and they live for and they look forward to the chance to see somebody who was once sick, be healed, recover health and go on and live a normal life.
[time=3146] I know for those in the medical profession, that means everything.
[time=3150] It's why they do what they do.
[time=3151] You might be a lawyer and you look forward to and you hope that your efforts could help you win a case.
[time=3158] I mean, there are all kinds of things that depending upon what you do, bring great joy and kind of make it all worth it.
[time=3164] Well, I want you to know something.
[time=3165] It's no different for us here at Black Hawk.
[time=3168] It's no different for me of all the things that God kind of brings along, you know, to help encourage and remind me that what we're doing here is really worth it.
[time=3179] There's one thing, there's one thing that time and time again reminds me that there is no greater endeavor at all and that is a changed life, an altered eternity.
[time=3194] Somebody who has come to faith and entered into a relationship with Jesus Christ and you know, when we see that, when we get to experience that, it's absolutely thrilling for those of us here.
[time=3207] And one of the ways, one of the settings in which we get to see and experience that is once a year we all head out to the lake and those who have given themselves to Christ recently, those who have surrendered their hearts and lives to Him, they get baptized.
[time=3222] That's what the Bible says we should do when we come to faith, we're to kind of proclaim our love for Him.
[time=3229] And so young and old come and they step into those waters and we've captured that for you here on video and I just can't begin to tell you how much it means to us, how thankful we are for God's work in their lives and how excited we get to share this with you.
[time=3247] You will see it in their eyes, you will see it in their expressions, the joy of new life, the joy of relationship with Him.
[time=3259] And I am strong, let the poor say and breathe,
[time=3268] let the blind say I can see.
[time=3274] It's what the Lord has done in me.
[time=3282] Let the we say I am strong.
[time=3288] Let the poor say I am brave, let the blind say I can see.
[time=3299] It's what the Lord has done in me.
[time=3306] Hosanna, Hosanna, Jesus God and Hosanna, Jesus God and Hosanna,
[time=3333] the land that was made, Hosanna, Hosanna, Jesus God and Hosanna.
[time=3350] And so young and young, Hosanna, Jesus God and Hosanna, the land that was made,
[time=3370] it was made, it was made, it was made, it was made, it was made, it was made,
