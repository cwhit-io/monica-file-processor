[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=30] (upbeat music)
[time=60] - Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=70] And we're so thankful that you've joined us.
[time=72] Again, what you're about to see is our service from this past week.
[time=76] And we had the privilege here at Black Hawk of having with us Dr. Al Jennings,
[time=82] the senior pastor and founder of Summit City Christian Center.
[time=86] And what a morning it was, we can't wait for you to see it here.
[time=90] Dr. Jennings came with a powerful message from Hebrews chapter 11.
[time=96] And he reminded us of Abraham and the way Abraham approached life.
[time=102] The way Abraham lived, his days here on earth.
[time=106] And when you boil all that down, you see that Abraham lived in a powerful way with a thing called an eternal perspective.
[time=114] You see, he realized in a very clear and powerful way that his days here on earth were numbered.
[time=122] And that his real home was a place called heaven.
[time=124] And when you realize that, and when you live with that kind of mindset, it frees you up to live life with a real sense of freedom and strength.
[time=133] And so we hope that you will be today as encouraged as we were as Dr. Jennings comes
[time=139] and shares God's word with you from Hebrews 11.
[time=141] You know, you may as you listen to Dr. Jennings even find yourself wanting to visit Summit City Christian Center
[time=148] and Dr. Jennings and that wonderful family that God has put together there.
[time=153] Their service times are going to appear on the screen here.
[time=156] They meet every Sunday, 8.30 a.m. and 10.30 a.m.
[time=161] They're located at 23.20, Mommy Avenue, right across the street from Memorial Middle School.
[time=168] And I know they would love to meet you, love to encourage you.
[time=171] And whatever way they could, I'll tell you what, God used him to encourage us.
[time=176] And I'm so very thankful for Dr. Jennings for not only his ministry here, but his friendship to me personally.
[time=182] He has been a huge encouragement.
[time=185] And I believe as you watch today, your heart will be encouraged as well.
[time=189] Never see more of her who can grasp your implant and wisdom.
[time=201] Who can have on the death of your love?
[time=208] You are beautiful beyond description.
[time=214] Majesty, in throne of love.
[time=221] And I stand, I stand in awe of you.
[time=234] Holy God, too, all praise is new.
[time=241] I stand in awe of you.
[time=249] I stand, I stand, I stand in awe of you.
[time=264] Holy God, too, all praise is new.
[time=271] I stand in awe of you.
[time=313] Hallelujah, for the Lord God Almighty reigns.
[time=334] Hallelujah.
[time=341] Hallelujah, for the Lord God Almighty reigns.
[time=354] Hallelujah.
[time=360] Holy, Holy, are you like God Almighty?
[time=394] Hallelujah, for the Lord God Almighty reigns.
[time=467] Holy, are you like God Almighty?
[time=487] Worthy is the land.
[time=499] Father in heaven, don't ever let us underestimate the value in those words.
[time=506] That you are holy.
[time=510] God, you are perfect and blameless.
[time=512] You were the ultimate sacrifice.
[time=515] You were the land that came to this earth and was slain for us who were so unholy and unworthy.
[time=521] God, that's how we live our lives today, in light of that sacrifice.
[time=527] In light of what you've done for us, Lord, help us to give our all back to you.
[time=532] Hallelujah to your name.
[time=537] Hallelujah, for the Lord God Almighty reigns.
[time=575] Let's sing it out.
[time=595] Hallelujah, for the Lord God Almighty reigns.
[time=617] Worthy is the land worthy of the land.
[time=646] With your heads bowed and your eyes closed, just hang on to that truth right there, would you?
[time=652] Worthy is the lamb, people.
[time=655] He is worthy, amen?
[time=659] He is worthy of your praise.
[time=662] He is worthy of your worship.
[time=665] He is worthy of your life.
[time=668] Every bit of it, all of it, he is worthy.
[time=672] The lamb that was slain, who came to live and die, that you and I might have life.
[time=677] He is worthy of everything you have and everything you can give.
[time=684] And so, God, we come to you here today.
[time=687] We come into this place, and our heart's desire is that we could lift praise and thanks and worship to you.
[time=696] And God, we pray that, to this point, that maybe you've been honored and blessed by our heartfelt expression of love and gratitude.
[time=707] And we pray, God, that as we continue this morning, and as we look at your word and as it does what only it can do,
[time=717] as it searches and looks into each of our hearts and souls, God, I pray that we would be encouraged.
[time=727] God, some here would need to be convicted.
[time=730] God, others would need to be reminded.
[time=732] And God, others still might discover truth for the very first time.
[time=737] God, we are so privileged to be able to be in this setting and we pray, God, again, your hand and your spirit, that it would move and that we would be different.
[time=746] Because of it, in your son's name we pray.
[time=749] [AMEN] You can be seated.
[time=752] And as you have a seat, let me just, let me just remind you of this.
[time=757] Lately, we've been talking about a relentless pursuit, as Corbin mentioned.
[time=762] And that has been something that we feel like God has just put on our hearts.
[time=765] And we've wanted so to share that with you and hopefully encourage you with the idea of relentlessly, with whole hearts,
[time=773] passionately giving yourself to your relationship with Him.
[time=777] Because when you do that, God's word says that then spills over to a kind of an uncanny, um, radical sense of devotion and love for each other.
[time=790] I mean, it's something that's very, very supernatural.
[time=793] It leads you and I to a relentless pursuit of each other, a willingness to walk through life, whatever life might bring.
[time=800] And when we're relentlessly pursuing Him and relentlessly giving ourselves to each other, we are relentlessly and wholeheartedly giving ourselves to the greatest endeavor of all.
[time=810] The mission of the church says there in Matthew 28, and in Acts 1 it says that we're to be His witnesses.
[time=817] We're to give ourselves in an effort to help seeking people, find and follow Him.
[time=822] Well, there's one thing that would move you and me away from that, and that is the cares and the worries of this place.
[time=832] You see, there's one thing that is a huge and complete distraction to purposeful, eternal living.
[time=839] And that is the things that compete for your affection, the things that compete for your devotion here.
[time=846] Now, there are things here that we've got to give ourselves to, but what's the focus?
[time=850] Today, you're going to be blessed, and we are so blessed to have a good friend of mine, Dr. Al Jennings, the founder and senior pastor of Summit City Christian Center.
[time=861] And he is all of that, but he is more than that. I want you to know a good friend.
[time=866] And he has been to me personally a huge encouragement and a reminder of what it means to give oneself to the greatest cause of all.
[time=875] I am so thankful for his friendship, so thankful for Carla and his wife and their family.
[time=881] They have been friends to us, encouragements and reminders along the way.
[time=886] And he is going to come today and share with you from Hebrews 11 about a man who lived with an eternal perspective, who accomplished a great mission.
[time=895] And his name is Abraham, but before that, listen, if you would, to Corbin and the guys.
[time=899] And actually, I want you to do this before Corbin and the guys, would you please give a very, very, very warm welcome to Dr. Al Jennings, and then Corbin is going to play for us.
[time=909] Would you welcome now?
[time=910] [APPLAUSE]
[time=916] [MUSIC]
[time=929] Why would I spend my life on it for the day that it would end? And why would I spend my time pointing to another man?
[time=943] Isn't that crazy?
[time=947] And why would I find an open night with promises unseen? And how can I learn your ways better than everything I'm taught to be? Isn't that crazy?
[time=966] Well, I have not been gone, I have not been to the ways to mount this world, but to a God who's calling out to me.
[time=983] And even though the world made things a little safe touch with reality, it would be crazy to choose this world.
[time=994] Oh, where eternity
[time=999] [MUSIC]
[time=1009] And if I boast, let me boast in filthy rags may cling. And if I glory, let me glory in my Savior's suffering. Isn't that crazy?
[time=1028] As I live this daily life, I trust you for everything, and I will only take a step when I feel you leading me. Isn't that crazy?
[time=1050] I have not been gone, to the ways to mount this world, but to a God who's calling out to me. And even though the world made things a little safe touch with reality, it would be crazy to choose this world.
[time=1074] Oh, where eternity
[time=1081] Call me crazy
[time=1087] You can call me crazy
[time=1101] I have not been gone, to the wisdom of this world, but to a God who's calling out to me. And even though the world made things a little safe touch with reality, it would be crazy.
[time=1126] It would be crazy
[time=1132] It would be crazy to choose this world.
[time=1138] Oh, where eternity
[time=1141] [MUSIC]
[time=1148] Isn't that crazy?
[time=1153] [MUSIC]
[time=1163] You can call me crazy
[time=1182] [MUSIC]
[time=1187] Good morning. Still morning?
[time=1191] Praise the Lord. It's good to be here with good friends, Pastor Kelly and Cabra. They're good friends of colonized. We really appreciate the relationship, the fellowship, and the feeling is mutual.
[time=1210] We encourage each other. He's a blessing to me. Our sons play golf together, and it's just good. It's good to have good friends in the body of Christ.
[time=1223] The Bible says that iron sharpens iron, and we sharpen each other. And it's amazing what you can learn if you are meek. The Bible talks about one of the fruit of the spirit is meekness, and some people think that means weakness.
[time=1239] But meekness is not weakness. Meekness is being teachable. Being able to learn from somebody else.
[time=1247] One thing about me, I'm a teachable person. I like to learn new things. And I've got something already from being here today that's going to help me in my ministry, help me in my church.
[time=1259] One of the things I need to do is let people out earlier.
[time=1267] And I learn that. So it's going to take some tremendous discipline, but you all pray for me. I'm not going to know what to do with myself getting out at 12 o'clock.
[time=1280] See, black folks do stuff a little different. They have church all day and stuff, but I like church. Don't go misunderstand me, but I'm just excited about being here.
[time=1295] You like to have fun? I like to have fun. And we just encourage about being here. We thank you for the privilege. Thank you, Pastor, for this privilege to minister to your people today. I don't take that for granted.
[time=1311] It's almost, it's strange, pastoring in the same city and being somewhere else other than your church. It's like, it's almost, I feel like I'm playing hook here or something.
[time=1324] But I feel good. I got up this morning, like I told the church in the first service, we got up and ran around the block four times and just got myself really ready.
[time=1335] Then after that, I kicked the block back under the bed and went back to sleep a little bit more. So I'm ready to minister to you today. Hebrews, chapter 11.
[time=1354] I mean, I'm glad that you don't have a stiff pastor. He's loose, man. I like to be around people like that. But your pastor, something about him, he's going somewhere. He's my kind of guy.
[time=1371] That's why we get along so well because we have, we like similar things. And I think the one thing beneath the surface that I believe really attracts us is he has the same kind of passion for Jesus as I do.
[time=1388] The same kind of love for the Lord as I do. And that's what I want to share with you today about just joining and hooking up with your pastor and talking about this living life with an eternal purpose.
[time=1402] I was listening to your broadcast this morning watching it and he really stirred me up when he was talking about a relentless pursuit.
[time=1413] I mean, you're pursuing something, but we need to put first and foremost God's kingdom and God's kingdom business. That's what Abraham did as we're going to see here in Hebrews, chapter 11.
[time=1430] This is a great chapter dealing with faith, dealing with the heroes of faith.
[time=1437] We're going to take a look at verse eight, "By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to the place which he would receive as an inheritance.
[time=1449] And he went out not knowing where he was going.
[time=1455] By faith he dwelt in the land of promise as in a foreign country, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise.
[time=1465] For he waited for the city which has foundations whose builder and maker is God."
[time=1473] Abraham lived a life with an eternal purpose. It says in verse 10 that he waited for the city which had foundations.
[time=1484] In other words, he understood that kingdom business was first. He put kingdom things, the things of God first place in his life.
[time=1497] God appeared to him and told him that he would be the father of a multitude or father of many nations that a great nation would come out of him.
[time=1509] He took him outside and had him look at the stars. He said look at the stars and see if you're able to number them.
[time=1516] And he was showing him that his seed would be like that.
[time=1520] And God provided him and Sarah with a son, a son of promise. His name was Isaac.
[time=1527] And Abraham lived with an intense devotion to God. And God wants us all to have that.
[time=1539] He waited for the city which had foundations whose builder and maker is God.
[time=1546] He lived a life of faith. He obeyed God.
[time=1549] Even to the point when he took his son Isaac, the son of promise. The one through whom that the great nation would come out of.
[time=1560] And God told him to sacrifice his son on the altar. And he obeyed God.
[time=1567] That's commitment. That's faithfulness.
[time=1572] That's living life with an eternal purpose because he totally trusted God with his life.
[time=1578] I'm going to give you four principles today that we can see if we studied a life of Abraham.
[time=1585] He had all of these principles at work in his life.
[time=1590] And let these motivate you and inspire you to live according to these principles because it's easy to quote them as easy to memorize them or to say them.
[time=1607] But to live them is a different story.
[time=1611] And the Bible tells us in James chapter 1 verse 22 to be doers of the word and not here as only.
[time=1618] Can you say amen?
[time=1622] The first principle is always keep God first.
[time=1627] Always keep God first. That's real simple, isn't it?
[time=1632] But that means that Christ, the Lord Jesus, God our Father wants to be first in our life.
[time=1641] He doesn't want to be second. He doesn't want to be second to our wife or husband or children.
[time=1648] There are many people today who live a children-centered life.
[time=1654] I mean, my children are involved in a lot of activities, they do a lot of things, but the children are not the center of my life.
[time=1662] My wife is very special to me.
[time=1666] God has blessed me with a beautiful and lovely wife, someone who compliments me greatly.
[time=1672] We compliment each other.
[time=1674] I mean, she is made for me, but she's not the center of my life.
[time=1681] I thank God for the ministry that he's called me to.
[time=1685] And God has done a lot of wonderful things in my life, but my ministry, even though my ministry has to do with the Lord, my ministry is not my center.
[time=1701] And there's so many pastors and ministers throughout the world who suffer from burnout because they get so involved in the work of the ministry that they don't spend time with the Lord who gave them the ministry.
[time=1721] Or another way we can say it, you can get involved in the work of the Lord that you don't spend time with the Lord of the work.
[time=1733] And that's a reminder to us who we're busy doing things in the ministry and we should get involved, but the only way that we're going to have something to offer is that we spend time with the Lord and fellowship with him through prayer
[time=1750] and through his Word.
[time=1752] Matthew chapter 6, we'll look at that verse of Scripture, verse 33.
[time=1772] The Lord is good at his mercy and doeth forever.
[time=1781] Matthew chapter 6, verse 33, it says, "But seek first," it doesn't say second, it doesn't say third, "but it says seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you."
[time=1801] What's he talking about?
[time=1802] Well, there's things that we all need, we need provision in life, we need clothes, we need food, we need shelter.
[time=1812] And he deals with those kinds of things in Matthew chapter 6, verse 25, he said, "Do not worry about your life, what you'll eat, what you'll wear, what you'll drink."
[time=1825] What he's saying is, God is interested in all of that, but he wants you to seek him first, seek the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these other things, what you'll eat, what you'll wear, what you'll put on, what you'll drink, the provisions in life.
[time=1846] All of those things, God is interested in and they will be added to you, but they will be added to you as you put the kingdom business first.
[time=1856] I encourage you to get involved in everything that's going on here at Black Hawk.
[time=1862] Your pastor has a mission, a vision.
[time=1865] I can hear it as he's, and when I'm watching television, I'm seeing him exhorting you and encouraging you to get with the mission of the ministry, that's important.
[time=1875] And first of all, you've got to have Christ as a center of your life.
[time=1880] When he's the center of your life, then you're going to put the things of the ministry, not ahead of the Lord, not ahead of your family.
[time=1890] But how many of you know that God would not ever ask us to do anything that we did not have the ability to do?
[time=1900] Then God would be unjust. God is a just God. He would never require us to do anything that we don't have the ability to do.
[time=1911] In other words, God would not inquire or require, excuse me, require us to get involved in the work of the ministry if he knew we didn't have any time for it.
[time=1927] Obviously, the first thing, the greatest thing that is on God's heart is the mission that he gave to the church to go into all the world and preach the gospel, to go into all the world and make disciples of all nations.
[time=1946] And see, that takes a little bit more time than praying a prayer of salvation with somebody and just leaving them there.
[time=1953] We also need to disciple them, get them involved in the life of the church.
[time=1960] You have small groups, get them in small groups, get them in the different activities and begin to, and be there to answer questions for them because people, they just get saved.
[time=1971] How many of you know? They have questions.
[time=1974] See, so, but who has the time anymore?
[time=1978] We're so busy. I mean, the kids have soccer, and they've got basketball, and they've got this and that, and I'm busy with this, and I'm busy with that.
[time=1988] I think what we need to do is find out what is the Lord saying about my life.
[time=1994] Sometimes you need to, and I like to do this at the beginning of the year.
[time=2000] I just started prioritizing things, and there's always time to do what's most important.
[time=2010] And the most important person in your life is not your family, not anybody else, not the job, but it's the Lord.
[time=2022] And when you seek Him, He'll begin to show you how you should spend your time, where your priorities need to be.
[time=2030] And you'll find out there's plenty of time to do what's most important.
[time=2037] Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things will be added to you.
[time=2043] Okay, first principle, always keep God first. Second principle is God owns everything, and I own nothing.
[time=2054] Don't be tied to anything in this life.
[time=2058] No material possessions, no earthly things.
[time=2062] That doesn't mean that you can't have material things. God wants you to have them.
[time=2066] God wants you to be prosperous, but God does not want you to be tied to any of those things.
[time=2071] There's no thing that I have in my life that I cannot give away, because everything that I have belongs to God.
[time=2080] My children belong to God. My wife belongs to God. I belong to God.
[time=2084] The Bible says that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit. Your body, if you are not your own, did you know that?
[time=2092] If you're not your own, then there's somebody else that needs to be making the decisions and calling the shots in your life.
[time=2100] He's called the Lord Jesus. That's why you call him Lord, because he wants to be the Lord.
[time=2109] That means he wants something to say about how you spend your time.
[time=2114] Have you ever asked him, Lord, I'm doing all of these things, and I don't have time to do some of the things that Pastor Kelly is talking about.
[time=2124] Now, you know, Lord, I don't have time, but really the Lord knows you do have time.
[time=2132] And if you spend time waiting on him, he'll show you how to spend your time so you can set your priorities according to his plan and his purpose,
[time=2142] because the most important thing that you want to focus on in your life is being in his will.
[time=2150] Understand that God owns everything.
[time=2154] Settle that.
[time=2155] Now, you have to make these decisions in your life to settle them.
[time=2163] I'm going to always keep God first.
[time=2169] God owns everything, and I own nothing. My car, it's not my car, it's the Lord's.
[time=2175] It's not my house. Yes, it's yours, but it's God's because you belong to God.
[time=2181] So everything you have belongs to God. God owns everything and you own nothing.
[time=2185] Number three, this third principle is a great principle, and it is that God is first, other second, and myself last.
[time=2200] Now, it's easy to say that it sounds real spiritual. Yes, God first, other second, and myself last.
[time=2211] But then when a lot of Christians spend their time as I'm first, God, I'm sorry I didn't spend time with you today, but I was too busy.
[time=2225] And others, and not even on the radar.
[time=2233] But that's why we need to refocus from time to time, and because all of us, because we're human, we can get off focus.
[time=2243] I had to reevaluate what I was doing. I was chasing a lot of rabbits.
[time=2248] There's a saying that if you chase two rabbits, both will escape.
[time=2254] And you can find in life where you just chasing all these rabbits, and you're really not doing anybody any good.
[time=2263] Because they're all kind of getting away. Anybody can anybody relate to that?
[time=2269] Because there's so many things that your pastor said are competing for our time.
[time=2275] I mean, if you just read all the mail you get, you'll waste time.
[time=2282] All this stuff, we're in the information age, and we get all this information, and all these emails, and all this kind of stuff.
[time=2289] I can't read every joke that somebody sends me over to Internet.
[time=2294] Some of these things, and they send me to these websites that show me all these pictures, and all these things.
[time=2301] I just said delete, delete, because I've got to focus.
[time=2310] The only thing that matters is the Lord and His plan for our life, and when we do that, yeah, you can have fun.
[time=2321] Yeah, you can do things you like to do, and there's plenty of time for all of that when you put in first.
[time=2328] And then you have others second after God, you're looking at how can you be a blessing?
[time=2336] My prayer before coming here was, "Lord, make me a blessing." I didn't come here to be blessed. I'm already blessed. I want to be a blessing.
[time=2347] And when you live your life like that, God is going to take care of you.
[time=2351] You're going to have more time, because what does the Scripture say?
[time=2354] If you seek first is Kingdom, other things will be added to you.
[time=2360] The blessings of God will come upon you and overtake you as you put his things first.
[time=2366] When you put others second, when you look to be a blessing to somebody else, when you lay down your life.
[time=2375] See, when the Bible talks about laying down your life, I used to have a hard time with that Scripture growing up in church.
[time=2380] And they said, "Man, great of love that has no man in this, and a man will lay down his life." I said, "Man, Lord, I'm not there." I'm just, I don't know if you were standing out.
[time=2392] Now, I love you. Most of you, I never have seen before.
[time=2397] But I don't know if you were standing in the middle of a state street and a truck was coming.
[time=2405] I wouldn't get out there in front of that truck to save your life.
[time=2409] I mean, I'm going to be honest with you.
[time=2413] Now, I will pray that that truck will miss you.
[time=2417] But I said, "Well, that's a tough Scripture right there, man. Lay down your life."
[time=2425] But then what I discovered is, what does your life consist of?
[time=2431] T-I-M-E.
[time=2434] Jesus already went to the cross. He don't need you to die for somebody.
[time=2438] He's already died for the world. He's already redeemed mankind.
[time=2442] We miss opportunities every day, many of us, to lay down our life.
[time=2449] To lay down your life, and your life consists of time.
[time=2453] Your time is your life.
[time=2455] So when you lay down something you want to do for somebody else, you're laying down your life.
[time=2464] And God is pleased with that.
[time=2467] Principle number four, and I like this one, God is my source.
[time=2473] People are not my source. The church is not my source.
[time=2478] The job is not your source. Understand that God is your source.
[time=2483] And trust God that He will take care of you.
[time=2487] Say this, say God. Say it. Say God will take care of me.
[time=2494] Turn the person next to you and say God will take care of you.
[time=2501] Even if we argue it on the way to church, God, no.
[time=2507] I know God's going to take care of you.
[time=2512] God will take care of you.
[time=2517] Turn to Colossians chapter one.
[time=2523] In a practical way, how do I seek those things which are above?
[time=2529] Or how do I live life with an eternal purpose?
[time=2536] Colossians chapter three, verse one, it reads as follows.
[time=2548] If then you were raised with Christ, and if you've given your life to Jesus, if you've been born again,
[time=2556] you've been risen with Christ, then seek.
[time=2560] Now, that's your responsibility.
[time=2563] I think a lot of times Christians, they're waiting on God to do something when God is waiting on them.
[time=2571] Notice how the wording is here and how this is your responsibility.
[time=2576] This is not God's. You've got to seek those things in the midst of all of the things that's going on in life.
[time=2583] All of these television programs, we've got satellite, TV, and digital cable, and all kinds of stuff.
[time=2595] Blockbuster video, and we've got time for all these other things.
[time=2600] But when do we have time for the things of God?
[time=2605] And to some people, it's a boring thing.
[time=2608] Are you talking about the Lord spending time with God? If you really know how to spend time with Him, it's exciting.
[time=2615] And the Lord is with you all the time.
[time=2623] He wants us to live in His presence. His presence is an environment that you carry with you all day,
[time=2631] because the Spirit of God, where does He live? He lives on the inside of you.
[time=2636] If you look at the account of creation, that before God ever put anything in place, He created the environment for it before He created the ones to live in or what He created to live in that environment.
[time=2650] Before He created something to put in the environment, He created the environment first.
[time=2656] For example, before He put the fish in the sea, He created the environment for the fish.
[time=2665] He created the sea, isn't that right? That was the environment for the fish.
[time=2670] We talk about a fish out of water.
[time=2673] We'll see a fish cannot exist out of water. The water isn't the environment for the fish.
[time=2677] Well, when He created Adam, He had already created the environment for Adam.
[time=2681] The environment was the Garden of Eden, which is called the Garden of God.
[time=2686] That was the environment in which He functioned.
[time=2689] The Eden was the presence of God, and He walked and talked with God in the cool of the day.
[time=2694] Y'all still with me?
[time=2696] Well, you have the Spirit, the presence of God, on the inside of you, and that is the environment in which you function best.
[time=2707] So that you don't have to lay the Lord down when you go to work.
[time=2713] When you watch the Raiders on TV, no, you're not going to do that because you're going to be at the baptism,
[time=2719] because you're going to put the Kingdom things first.
[time=2722] You're going to set your VCR and you'll watch it later.
[time=2727] Or you can call me and I'll tell you because we don't have church tonight.
[time=2732] But even while I watch football, I'm in the right environment.
[time=2738] I'm in the presence of God because somebody might call that needs to be ministered to.
[time=2744] And I can easily go minister to that person and don't have to work up something to be in God's presence.
[time=2753] I'm already in God's presence.
[time=2756] I play golf in His presence.
[time=2760] I talk to my wife in His presence.
[time=2765] See, so our whole life ought to be in His presence.
[time=2771] And that's why, or for that reason, it'll be easy for you to live with an eternal purpose when you always have God on your mind.
[time=2786] Does that make sense to you?
[time=2789] I hope so.
[time=2791] Because I really want you to get this because now it's easy for me to do what God tells me to do when I don't limit God to a particular place in my house where I read the Bible or where I pray.
[time=2810] I want to go and live that life and live with Him throughout the day.
[time=2822] I want to practice His presence.
[time=2826] They have these bracelets that say, "What would Jesus, or WWJD, what would Jesus do?"
[time=2832] How do we know what Jesus would do?
[time=2834] We've got to know how He thinks.
[time=2836] And we know how He thinks by looking in the Word of God.
[time=2842] See, there's a transformation that happens when you renew your mind with God's Word.
[time=2848] And when you're in His presence all the time, you're going to treat people, right?
[time=2851] Because how can I say I love God?
[time=2854] First John says, "Who I have not seen, if I don't love my brother, who I have seen."
[time=2864] See, there's a lot of people who hate in this world.
[time=2870] And as a Christian, we are to operate in the love of God.
[time=2877] That means if I love God, it's going to be demonstrated in my love for people.
[time=2883] So in verse one it says, "If you were raised in with Christ, seek those things which are above where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God.
[time=2891] Set your mind on things above, not on things on the earth."
[time=2897] See, I've got to do that.
[time=2900] I've got to seek.
[time=2901] And then I've got to seek those things which are above.
[time=2904] And then I've got to set.
[time=2908] Man, I tell you that's a powerful word.
[time=2910] When you set something, that's talking about a quality decision, a quality decision to set your mind on things above.
[time=2920] Not on things on the earth.
[time=2922] How do I do that?
[time=2923] By setting my mind on the things of God's Word.
[time=2926] I don't want to do anything.
[time=2927] That's what a fear of God is.
[time=2929] You hear about a fear of God.
[time=2931] That doesn't mean you're scared of Him.
[time=2934] See, God doesn't want us to be scared of Him.
[time=2936] Some people have the idea that God is just big, big bully with a great big old stick.
[time=2942] Ready to, you know, a big giant heavenly fly-swatter.
[time=2947] Ready to swatch you when you do something wrong.
[time=2950] Get your hand out of the cookie jar.
[time=2953] But no, God is a loving God.
[time=2956] He certainly is awesome, but God is a God of love.
[time=2960] He's a God of compassion.
[time=2962] The Bible says He's full of mercy.
[time=2965] You see, and He wants to spend time with us, but He wants us to fear Him, not a scared fear, but a reverential fear.
[time=2973] See, there's a kind of fear that we stay away from.
[time=2976] 2 Timothy 1, 7, God has not given us the spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.
[time=2984] We're not to have that kind of fear, the scared fear, but a reverential fear, which means that I don't want to do anything.
[time=2992] A fear of God is I don't want to do anything that would displease my heavenly Father.
[time=2998] That means I got to love you.
[time=3001] It doesn't make, it doesn't make any difference who you are, what culture you from, what color your skin is.
[time=3007] When I came to the Lord, I mean, I had a lot of baggage.
[time=3013] I don't know about you.
[time=3014] Let me just talk about, I can't talk about me, or you, but I can talk about me.
[time=3018] I had baggage, man.
[time=3020] There's people that, man, I just didn't like.
[time=3025] I can't talk to their skin color, and let me just be plain, like white folks.
[time=3032] Because there's just certain aspects and things of my culture.
[time=3036] You just get, you get taught to just kind of sweep everybody, paint everybody with the same old broad brush, you know.
[time=3047] See, the devil, prejudice is of the devil.
[time=3052] The devil hates everybody.
[time=3054] And it's his job when really, you know what all racism is, is a spirit of division.
[time=3063] Tries to pit one group of people against another group of people.
[time=3067] It don't make any difference.
[time=3068] You can't make me hate you.
[time=3070] You can spit on me.
[time=3071] It don't make any difference.
[time=3073] If it's Chinese or Hispanic or white or black, they can spit on me.
[time=3077] It don't make any difference.
[time=3078] I'm going to keep loving.
[time=3081] Because I have the ability to love, and that is Christ's character, and I'm going to demonstrate that character, and I can do that.
[time=3090] No matter what you do to me, it's my responsibility to treat you right.
[time=3100] You know, God is more interested.
[time=3103] All of us have all kinds of opportunities that we can be offended.
[time=3109] And the Bible tells us to guard against that, and guard against being offended.
[time=3114] I'm still on my topic, believe it or not, living with an eternal perspective.
[time=3120] But God is more interested when you're attacked and somebody does an unkind thing to you, or speaks unkind words to you, or mistreats you.
[time=3131] God is more interested in how you respond to that situation than the way you were treated.
[time=3144] Because God always deals with you.
[time=3148] I have no...
[time=3151] Some people, I mean, are just funny.
[time=3153] I mean, they just look at you and decide they don't like you.
[time=3157] But I can't be bothered by that.
[time=3158] It's my responsibility.
[time=3160] I can't control whether you love me or not, but I can control whether I love you.
[time=3169] Because my Bible tells me that if I can't love, I can talk all day long about how I love God.
[time=3176] But if I can't love my brother, you all, maybe you didn't realize this or not.
[time=3186] But, you know, we related.
[time=3189] We got the same father.
[time=3192] [AMEN] The blood that was shared was not red.
[time=3196] Excuse me, it was red.
[time=3197] It wasn't white and black.
[time=3200] It was red.
[time=3201] And we all come under that same banner.
[time=3204] So we might well start loving each other.
[time=3208] [AMEN] Because when we get to heaven, there's not...
[time=3212] And I don't even let people say, "Well, you know, you got that black church." No, we don't have a black church.
[time=3217] What is a black church anyway?
[time=3220] What is a white church?
[time=3221] When you get to heaven, I mean, it's not like it's going to be sections over here.
[time=3224] Okay, you black folks, you come on over here.
[time=3227] Okay, you white folks, come on over here.
[time=3231] And you start talking about a demonstration.
[time=3234] Did I give you all the four points?
[time=3236] Because I really lost time.
[time=3240] But what I was going to tell you, seek those things which are above.
[time=3248] Renew your mind with the Word.
[time=3249] Romans 12 to be transformed by the renewing of your mind.
[time=3252] [AMEN] Find out how God thinks.
[time=3254] See, that's what delivered me.
[time=3256] I couldn't think like my culture.
[time=3258] If my culture doesn't line up with the Word.
[time=3261] I'm not going to accept anything that doesn't line up with the Word of God.
[time=3269] See, and I'll give you an example.
[time=3272] And some of you remember a part type in South Africa.
[time=3277] Well, I went to a Bible school and there's a pastor over there that graduated from the same Bible school.
[time=3282] He's pastor Ray McCauley in Johannesburg, South Africa.
[time=3287] And the country was trying to figure it out.
[time=3290] They were trying to figure out what they could do about apartheid.
[time=3294] How can they get, how can they end this thing?
[time=3297] How can they get folks to get along?
[time=3299] And they noticed this church over there.
[time=3301] And this church had at the time over 5,000 people.
[time=3305] But they're all kind of racist.
[time=3308] You had black folks and white folks all together.
[time=3311] And so the government went to the pastor and said, how do you do it?
[time=3319] I mean, this is the way it ought to be.
[time=3321] The government consulting the church for answers.
[time=3325] Because they didn't have to figure it out.
[time=3327] So they said, what do you do?
[time=3330] And the pastor, he didn't pull any punches.
[time=3332] He said, first of all, you've got to get people saved.
[time=3336] You've got to get people born again because until people get the love of God in their heart, their nature is selfish.
[time=3346] So what you've got to do, you've got to get without loving people's heart.
[time=3351] People, their nature is selfish, their nature is hate.
[time=3357] But see, when you get the love of God in your heart, then you can love anybody regardless of the color of their skin.
[time=3366] And this pastor became an advisor to the government and worked to help the end of apartheid.
[time=3373] These are the kinds of things they don't show you in the news.
[time=3375] When they had the election, when they elected Nelson Mandela, they had -- you know who they had to oversee the election, the ballots?
[time=3386] This church.
[time=3388] It was the members of that church because they wanted to make sure everything was done fairly.
[time=3394] And I love it because the church -- here's my point.
[time=3398] I'm going to close with this.
[time=3403] The church has the answer to racism.
[time=3408] And you know what it is?
[time=3410] And the world is a tremendous opportunity to live with an eternal perspective.
[time=3416] When you can love people regardless of their color and demonstrate the love of God,
[time=3423] hug somebody that's a different culture, a different skin color because it doesn't matter because when people can see church folks stop fighting and bickering
[time=3434] and loving each other, it's the love that we have that's going to demonstrate to the world
[time=3441] that we are disciples of Jesus.
[time=3444] Let's pray, Heavenly Father, we thank you and praise you because you're good.
[time=3453] And we always, Lord, want to keep you at the center of our life to keep you first,
[time=3466] help each and every one of us, Father, to live with an eternal purpose,
[time=3472] an eternal perspective to seek you first in everything that we do.
[time=3477] Lord, help us to lay down our time and lay down our life for one another.
[time=3485] Help us to see each other in the body of Christ as valuable and precious.
[time=3490] Teach us to love.
[time=3495] As Abraham was called out of his family, called out of his environment,
[time=3501] called out of his culture and his comfort zone to seek a higher purpose.
[time=3508] Help us, Father, to do the same.
[time=3510] Take us out of our box.
[time=3512] Take us out of our comfort zone.
[time=3515] Teach us to love.
[time=3517] Help us to discover your will for our lives and your plan and your purpose in Jesus' name.
[time=3525] [AMEN] Praise God.
[time=3527] I love you, brother.
[time=3528] Thank you so much.
