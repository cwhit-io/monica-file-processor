[time=272] Let it rise, let it rise, let it rise, let it rise, let it rise, let it rise, let it rise.
[time=301] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Blackhawk, and when I was 17 years old, my dad and my
[time=310] mom, they had some things take place, got kind of ugly and it was all pretty sad and it eventually
[time=318] led to my dad leaving my mom and I, and having grown up an only child and having grown up with
[time=327] my dad actually being a pastor and seeing all that stuff just fall apart and all the heartache
[time=334] and all the confusion. As a 17-year-old, it was really, really difficult to take and much less to
[time=342] make sense of. That was about 20 years ago and I'm here to tell you today that over the course of
[time=350] the past 20 years, God has in a really amazing way, grown me, taught me, He's helped me see things,
[time=360] He has built character into my life, He has solidified lessons, you know, deep in my soul that I'll
[time=369] never ever forget and a lot of what I've learned and a lot of how I've grown has been the result of
[time=377] what took place when I was 17, heartache, pain and confusion. You know, it says in James chapter one
[time=385] and as you join us today, you'll see us here in the service kind of dive into our study of James
[time=391] and it says there in the first chapter that you and I are to consider it all joy when we encounter
[time=398] various trials. Now the reason it says is because God allows trials. He allows things to unfold
[time=406] because He wants in the enduring of them and your willingness in mind to stay in there,
[time=412] to keep getting up each day, to keep trying to understand more and more so what He has for us, what He wants to teach us. In the midst of our endurance, James says our faith is grown and
[time=425] you know, sometimes in the middle of it all, we don't quite see the purpose, sometimes in the
[time=431] midst of it all, we don't quite understand what He's doing as a 17-year-old. I was so very confused
[time=437] as a 39-year-old. I don't think I got it all figured out but I'll tell you what,
[time=443] it's really true. When you and I are willing to endure, when you and I are willing
[time=449] to stay put as the old song says to trust and obey, He has a miraculous way
[time=456] of growing us and teaching us and making us more like Him. And I hope today as you listen,
[time=462] your heart will be encouraged. You may be in the midst of a trial. You may have just come out of one.
[time=466] One may be looming on the horizon either way. I hope you'll listen and I hope God will,
[time=472] through His Word, and encourage your heart and give you hope and direction. Stay at it.
[time=502] I hope that you, in all of your power, to trust you, with all that I am,
[time=515] with all of my life, for this is my way to know you for.
[time=532] All you, in all of your mercy, to serve you with all that I am, with all of my heart,
[time=550] for this is my way to know you for.
[time=580] I hope that you, in all of your power, to trust you, with all that I am,
[time=607] with all of my heart, for this is my way to know you for.
[time=1297] Real questions, real feelings from real people trying to live out our real faith in the midst
[time=1306] of real life.
[time=1308] We begin here this morning because this is where the book of James begins.
[time=1313] And as you saw on the screens here just a few moments ago, we will begin this morning, what will take us about eight weeks or so to get through.
[time=1320] And that is an in-depth look, a study, a discussion together, a look at God's word of this great book back towards the end of your New Testament called the Epistle of James.
[time=1330] James, what a great, great book.
[time=1333] James is the one who authored the book, just a few things as the screens did point out.
[time=1338] James is the oldest half-brother of Jesus.
[time=1341] Also some don't realize he was the full brother of Jude, another author there in the back of your New Testament.
[time=1348] Oldest half-brother of Jesus, brother of Jude.
[time=1350] John 7 reveals something kind of interesting, but it kind of makes sense the more you think about it.
[time=1356] John 7 reveals that early on, James had rejected the Messiah's ship of the Lord.
[time=1362] And you kind of hear that and you go, "Whoa, what was wrong with him?" But then you stop and think about it.
[time=1366] I mean, how would it be for you if Jesus is your brother, huh?
[time=1371] And when we think about things that go on between siblings and stuff, I mean, it was the brother of Jesus.
[time=1375] I mean, there may have been some issues there.
[time=1377] But finally, 1 Corinthians 15 says he kind of got that stuff figured out, fully surrenders his heart and life to the Lord.
[time=1384] He was the key leader in the early church there in Jerusalem.
[time=1388] You see the story of that early church unfold for us in the book of Acts, and you see as you read through that that James was mightily used of God.
[time=1396] This book probably written sometime between 45 and 50 A.D., which uniquely enough makes it the earliest of all the New Testament canon.
[time=1405] Makes it the earliest written book of the entire New Testament.
[time=1409] And it is full of great truth.
[time=1411] But it is a book that sheds divine light on the living out.
[time=1414] I want you to hear that.
[time=1415] You might want to write that down.
[time=1416] It is a book that sheds light on the living out of one's faith.
[time=1421] Those of us who come into this room this morning and say, "You know what, I've given my heart and life.
[time=1426] I have surrendered myself to a personal relationship with a living God." This book says to you, and this book says to me, "Okay, here is how you practically,
[time=1437] in the every day of life, live that out." Very important stuff.
[time=1443] St. Francis of Assisi said this, "At all times preach the gospel when necessary use
[time=1450] words." It's so very important, people, how we live, how we choose, how we act.
[time=1460] Not just what we say, but who we are.
[time=1463] This book sheds divine light on the living out of a biblical Christianity.
[time=1468] So let's jump in.
[time=1469] James, chapter 1, "When real faith meets real life," we'll begin to read here at the
[time=1475] beginning.
[time=1476] James, a bond-servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ to the 12 tribes who are dispersed
[time=1482] abroad, greetings, "Consider it all joy," he says.
[time=1486] Verse 2, "My brethren, when you encounter various trials, knowing that the testing of
[time=1492] your faith produces endurance, and let endurance have its perfect result, that you may be perfect
[time=1499] and complete lacking in nothing.
[time=1503] But if any of you, verse 5, lacks wisdom, let a mask of God who gives to all men generously
[time=1509] and without reproach, and it will be given to him.
[time=1513] But let a mask in faith without any doubting, for the one who doubts is like the surf of the sea, driven and tossed by the wind.
[time=1520] Or let not that man expect that he will receive anything from the Lord being a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways." People, what we see, what you just read, what we just considered there together, our passage
[time=1537] this morning.
[time=1538] I want to just tell you as we jump into it, and I've been asking God all week to just give me the wisdom and the strength to just come close to doing it justice.
[time=1547] The guys, this passage is life-changing.
[time=1552] Let me say it again to you, this passage that you and I are about to try our best to unfold
[time=1559] and understand more clearly this morning, people, this passage right here, I mean the whole council of God, all of its life changing.
[time=1567] We know that to be true.
[time=1568] I can't begin to tell you how very important it is that you would, and I would understand
[time=1575] in a clear and succinct way the impact and the application of this truth right here,
[time=1582] it changes lives.
[time=1585] I have seen people over the years, some younger, some older than me who have grasped this truth
[time=1591] right here, and I have watched it change the way they view life, change the way they interact
[time=1597] with others, change the way, alter the way they do ministry, the way they parent, the way they, I mean, the way they work, the way they face this life that we face each day,
[time=1608] this passage is life-changing.
[time=1612] James, chapter 1, verses 1 through 8, this passage says that when trials hit, there is
[time=1622] a response, number 1, that we should embrace.
[time=1627] This says, and we'll see secondly, that there is a reason we're being stretched, and thirdly
[time=1633] we'll see that there is a request, there is a request that we should make.
[time=1639] Would you join me?
[time=1640] Let's jump in.
[time=1641] Number 1, when trials hit, there is a response that says that we should embrace.
[time=1646] Look at chapter 1, verse 2, it says, "Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter
[time=1652] various trials." Stop right there.
[time=1655] Look at that verse there.
[time=1657] We're going to kind of take it apart, phrase by phrase, and we're going to start kind of right there in the middle.
[time=1661] See where it says, "My brethren, I want you to make note of something there," okay?
[time=1666] James writes to believers.
[time=1670] James writes this to those already convinced.
[time=1673] This is for the fully surrendered.
[time=1675] This is for the family of God, and here's the reason we make a note of that, because what He's about to say, the truth that's about to be unfolded, to somebody living outside
[time=1688] of relationship with the living God, to somebody living life on the outside, not having come
[time=1694] to this point of full surrender.
[time=1696] You see the truth that He's about to unfold to the unbeliever will seem absolutely ludicrous.
[time=1704] It does.
[time=1705] It seems absolutely whacked.
[time=1709] But yet to the one who has come into that relationship with the living God, to that one, that man or that woman who understands what it means to be loved by, cared for, and in
[time=1720] a relationship with God, these truths, though confusing at times, can begin to make sense.
[time=1727] It can begin to get really clear.
[time=1729] "My brethren," he says, "those of you who know Him, those of you who are growing in your understanding of Him." When you encounter various trials, go to the end of that phrase.
[time=1741] Go to the end of verse 2.
[time=1742] When you encounter when you encounter various trials, the NIV may read when you encounter trials of many kinds.
[time=1749] The new King James, I think, says, "when you fall into various trials."
[time=1755] Here's what I want you to make a note of here.
[time=1757] Not if.
[time=1759] But what?
[time=1761] Say it again.
[time=1762] Not if.
[time=1763] But what?
[time=1764] When?
[time=1765] It's not a question, right?
[time=1768] And sometimes we live life as if somehow that's up for grabs.
[time=1774] Not if, he says, "but when," not one, two, "but many," John 1633 says, "in this world
[time=1781] you will have tribulations.
[time=1783] People, storms come.
[time=1785] It rains.
[time=1786] It gets cold.
[time=1787] The winds blow hard all the time.
[time=1790] It never stops.
[time=1791] I mean, you may, I may, we may at times experience a season of rest.
[time=1798] The winds may just begin to blow in a different direction, but sooner or later they come back around and they come full force into your life and mine.
[time=1810] The realization of this, some of you, it may just seem blatantly obvious to others of us.
[time=1816] You know, it's taken some time.
[time=1818] For me, the realization of this truth has impacted my life in many, many ways.
[time=1823] Maybe the most profound is in the area of parenting, in the area of parenting, yeah.
[time=1830] And let me just, let me just maybe explain it to you this way.
[time=1834] You know, from the first day, I ever held one of them in my arms.
[time=1839] And I'm sure most of you, if you've been through this, you could relate.
[time=1842] Or even if you haven't, you know, and maybe you've held one that was an ace or a nephew or just a good friend's child, I mean, when you hold them in your hands, you know, there's something that goes on inside you and you just think, you know what, I will forever from this day forward do everything I can to guard and protect this little life, right?
[time=1862] Right?
[time=1863] And so you just naturally, you want to do that.
[time=1867] But what I'm learning still, and you got to, you got to pray for Kebronai as we keep trying to learn this, because you know, there comes a time when you realize that you can
[time=1878] do that to a fault.
[time=1880] And I see that sometimes.
[time=1882] I see parents today with grown kids still working their tails off to try and guard them
[time=1888] from all kinds of pain and difficulty.
[time=1890] And they've been guarding them from all kinds of pain and difficulty from the day they held them in their arms.
[time=1896] And they haven't stopped yet.
[time=1897] And what that produces down here towards the end of the deal is not so good.
[time=1903] And we're trying our best to grab hold of this truth that, you know what, life, it's
[time=1910] painful and it hurts sometimes.
[time=1914] And you face difficulty.
[time=1916] And at some point in here, we have to start trying to let them taste a little bit of that.
[time=1924] And as a parent, you know, maybe you can identify with this, maybe you can't.
[time=1926] But I know already we've got a 10-year-old and a one-year-old and all the way in that range there, you know, in whatever circumstance it might be, I can kind of, we can kind of as parents see it coming.
[time=1936] Does that make sense?
[time=1938] Whether I'm talking about, I'm going to sound cruel here, whether I'm talking about, I go one-year-old, like rolling off a little stair, you know, and I don't let her do that like, you know, all the time, or whether we're talking about, you know, a 10-year-old who
[time=1954] in school and with relationships starting to see things happen.
[time=1958] And I can kind of say, uh-oh, and I am part of me wants to just grab them and say, no,
[time=1964] no, no, don't do that.
[time=1966] And sometimes I do, but I'm learning.
[time=1969] Sometimes I don't.
[time=1972] Because he has to, he has to begin to understand that that's life and that, and that things
[time=1979] happen and stuff comes his way and it hurts and it's confusing and I think our parenting
[time=1985] opportunity isn't to keep him away from all that stuff, but at times to help him get through all that stuff.
[time=1991] Does that make sense?
[time=1994] Much easier said than done and we're trying our best, but that's life.
[time=1999] Life is tough.
[time=2003] Storms come.
[time=2004] And you know what?
[time=2005] Forget the kids.
[time=2006] Let's just talk about you and I for a second.
[time=2008] That truth, when we encounter, it brings to bear the whole purpose of God for you and
[time=2015] for me.
[time=2016] I mean, forget kids.
[time=2017] We sometimes start thinking that life's about being happy.
[time=2021] I hear it from me.
[time=2024] I'm not happy.
[time=2026] Well, you know what, he's not interested necessarily in your happiness.
[time=2031] He wants to see you grow.
[time=2033] He wants to see you become more like him.
[time=2036] He wants to see your faith stretched, your understanding of him deepened.
[time=2041] And sometimes that will entail you and I not being happy when we have to be reminded
[time=2047] of that again and again, when, when, not if you encounter various trials.
[time=2055] So to the fully surrendered James writes, when trials hit, when real faith meets real life, consider it all joy.
[time=2062] Look at that phrase there, consider it all joy.
[time=2066] God's word says this is the response we should embrace.
[time=2069] Make a note there on that word, consider, underline it or circle it there in your Bible or if you're taking notes, just write it down.
[time=2075] Very important couple words here.
[time=2077] Number one, consider.
[time=2080] Consider it all joy.
[time=2081] That word in the Greek is a word that actually was an accounting term.
[time=2084] It's kind of a mathematical word.
[time=2086] And the word consider means this, it means to add it all up.
[time=2091] It goes hit, winds blowing hard, God's word says consider, add it all up.
[time=2097] Kind of like this, it's, it's confusing, you know, it's you and me kind of just stepping aside for a moment and going, okay, here's the deal.
[time=2104] It's confusing.
[time=2106] It hurts.
[time=2107] I mean, there's pain involved, God, there's, there's frustration.
[time=2110] I'm going to add it all up.
[time=2112] I don't understand it, it hurts.
[time=2114] There's confusion, there's frustration.
[time=2116] And then you add this into the equation as well.
[time=2118] And then there is all I know to be true about you, God.
[time=2123] And I'm going to throw that in this mix.
[time=2125] I'm going to take the confusion, the hurt and the pain, and all I know to be true about you.
[time=2130] And I'm going to add all that up and I'm going to consider it.
[time=2135] Having added it up, joy, joy.
[time=2140] All that equals, God's word says, joy.
[time=2144] Well, hey, let's define joy.
[time=2146] Let's make sure that we understand what the text is calling us to.
[time=2151] Having added it all up, we're to choose this thing called joy.
[time=2156] Watch this.
[time=2157] Write these words down.
[time=2158] A deep inner confidence, a deep inner confidence, a peace born out of what we know to be true
[time=2165] about him.
[time=2167] So very important that you connect with that thought this morning.
[time=2171] As you and I consider it all joy, it is a willingness to grab hold of and experience
[time=2178] a peace that is born out of what we know to be true about him.
[time=2182] A peace and confidence tied not to our circumstance but to a loving and good God.
[time=2187] Did you get that?
[time=2189] It is a peace and a confidence that's not tied.
[time=2193] It's not an ability to be at peace and consider it all joy because somehow you figured this thing out.
[time=2200] No, no, no.
[time=2201] Peace and confidence that you arrive at, that you claim and embrace because of what you know simply and only to be true about him.
[time=2210] So it begs the question, what do you know to be true and right about him?
[time=2220] In the midst of all of that, you and I are to be reminded of the fact that he loves you,
[time=2227] that he sent his son to die for you, that Philippians 1, 6 says that he who began a
[time=2233] good work in you, and you just go ahead and you just scroll back to that night, to that day, to that morning when you surrender your heart and life to him.
[time=2241] And Philippians 1, 6 says that what began there at that moment, he has promised he will
[time=2248] complete, he will from that time on grow you, stretch you, love you, walk with you, then
[time=2254] make you more like him.
[time=2257] And that's the truth, and never at any point along the road, Romans 8, 38 and 39, never
[time=2263] will you or I be separated from his love, never.
[time=2267] He loves you, he sent his son to die for you, what he began in you, he will complete and you can never be nor I separated from his love and his hand on our life.
[time=2280] The realization of that, the stating of that, the embracing of that, that's joy.
[time=2287] It doesn't say be excited, it doesn't say walk around in some giddy state of denial,
[time=2293] no, but internally there's that deep sense of confidence that a loving God is thoughtfully
[time=2301] and with purpose allowing life to unfold and thank God for 1 Corinthians 10, turn back
[time=2307] there if you would.
[time=2309] 1 Corinthians 10, sometimes I just personally have to kind of take a time out as I face the things that I face and just be reminded of what it says in 1 Corinthians 10, 13.
[time=2319] You see it there?
[time=2321] Back there after Romans, 1 Corinthians 10, before you get to 2 Corinthians, it says down there in verse 13, no temptation or you can actually the same word they're used for trial,
[time=2332] no trial, no temptation has overtaken you, but such as is common to man.
[time=2337] So many times you think, so many times I find myself thinking that somehow what I'm facing is uniquely devastating and you know what?
[time=2346] It's not.
[time=2348] It is common to what a fallen world, to what fallen people living in a fallen world face.
[time=2355] It is common to man, but watch this and God is faithful who will not allow you to be tempted
[time=2361] beyond what you are able, but with the temptation or trial will provide the way of escape also
[time=2368] that you may be able to endure it.
[time=2374] Important word to hold on to is we come back to our text that you may be able to endure
[time=2380] it.
[time=2383] Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials.
[time=2389] Add it up.
[time=2391] Add it all up and be at peace, internally confident that he's up to something good.
[time=2399] So how about you?
[time=2400] How about me?
[time=2402] As we leave this place today, this week, what do you say?
[time=2406] Would you make a commitment today?
[time=2408] Would you just write it down?
[time=2409] Would you tell an accountability partner?
[time=2410] Would you share it with your small group?
[time=2412] Would you just make sure today you just kind of cross back and forth with your spouse or good friends?
[time=2417] Just say, you know what?
[time=2418] I'm going to commit this week.
[time=2419] Add it all up.
[time=2420] I'm going to consider it joy.
[time=2425] When what?
[time=2426] Well, you pick, you know, when the milk spills, and I'm not making light of that, you know?
[time=2431] I've shared with you our dinner time stories, you know?
[time=2434] You've got your own situations and it's just milk, but you know, sometimes when they heat a bit more, it wants to send you through the ceiling.
[time=2443] When the milk spills, when the plans fall through, moms, dads, I mean, whoever you are, when the day calls for you to get to here by this time so you can pick up them and get them over to there by that time so that they can get dropped off so you can get, and that whole thing falls apart.
[time=2461] Add it all up.
[time=2463] He hasn't gone anywhere.
[time=2465] He's got something for you.
[time=2467] Feel consider it all joy from spilled milk to plans gone astray.
[time=2471] You know what?
[time=2473] All the way to, if the test results aren't so good, I mean, whatever it might entail,
[time=2483] would you be willing this week to consider it, to add it all up and embrace it as joy,
[time=2491] a deep inner confidence?
[time=2494] There's a response that we should embrace.
[time=2496] You know what?
[time=2497] There's a reason as well, this text indicates, go back to James 1, there's a reason we're being stretched, James chapter 1, verses 3 and 4.
[time=2507] It says, "Knowing, consider it all joy, knowing this, that the testing of your faith produces
[time=2513] endurance and let endurance have its perfect result that you and I would be made perfect
[time=2519] in the end, complete, lacking in nothing." You see, choosing joy in the face of trial develops and cultivates.
[time=2528] The New Testament says this thing called endurance, it's a great word, we're going to look at it in just a second.
[time=2534] The testing of one's faith, being tested and remaining faithful, facing the onslaught and
[time=2540] considering it all joy, it produces endurance, choosing joy instead of anger.
[time=2549] Some of you here this morning, myself included, when the winds blow hard and the rain comes down, instead of choosing joy, sometimes we choose anger, volume, harsh words.
[time=2565] God's word says no, choose, choose joys, some of us, maybe aren't bent toward anger, some are bent toward panic.
[time=2573] Some of you in the room this morning, when the winds blow hard and the rain comes down, we choose worry and we'll spend hours and hours and days and weeks worrying, panicked.
[time=2587] And he says, "No, no, no, I haven't gone anywhere.
[time=2590] My love for you is great, my hand will never leave you.
[time=2594] Consider it joy." Others of us in the room this morning will tend to move toward a thing called manipulation.
[time=2602] The winds blow hard, the rains come down and we're going to just roll up our sleeves and we're going to do say whatever we can do or say, with him or her or them or this circumstance,
[time=2612] we're going to twist the thing and somehow make it right so I can get back to the primary goal of life, which is me being happy.
[time=2619] God says, "No, I want to grow you.
[time=2623] I want to grow you." And endurance is this willingness to go along in that process, to trust him and to, well,
[time=2634] the old song says, "Trust and obey," to trust him and obey him when the pain and confusion
[time=2641] feel almost paralyzing.
[time=2644] And this, James Wan says, develops endurance, "Hupa Meno," "Hupa Meno."
[time=2651] I just share that word with you because of the incredible meaning that comes with it.
[time=2655] The word in the Greek is "Hupa Meno." It means to remain under, we've talked about it in the past, I want to just briefly remind you, again, of what it means, the picture that it paints, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance.
[time=2668] "Hupa Meno," picture, if you will, an umbrella.
[time=2671] Typically umbrellas are meant to keep the rain out.
[time=2674] This now is an umbrella of trial.
[time=2677] It's the picture of literally sitting under an umbrella and trial is coming down on you
[time=2683] from under the umbrella and it says, in a sense, "Sit tight." Don't go anywhere.
[time=2690] "Hupa Meno is to remain under." Because of the belief that rests at the core of your being, that there's something going on here and there's something he wants me to see and there's something he wants me to learn and there is something that he wants to build into my life and I'm going to miss it if I run here or if I run there.
[time=2713] And so I'm going to sit tight, I'm going to remain under this umbrella.
[time=2718] You see, the follower of Christ knows what it says in Philippians 1, 6, that he who began the good work will complete it.
[time=2726] The follower of Christ has a realization of the rest of verse 4.
[time=2731] If you'll go back to there, you see, we begin to understand, let endurance have its perfect result.
[time=2738] Why?
[time=2738] Well, that you may be perfect, that you may be in the end, made complete, lacking in nothing.
[time=2746] The Christ follower knows that a good God allows pain to stretch and grow as is good,
[time=2754] not bad, as is good plan for me unfolds.
[time=2758] I know that endurance, choosing joy, grows my relationship with Christ and deepens my own
[time=2766] sense of trust and hope.
[time=2769] You know, that's what it's about.
[time=2771] It's about Christ in you.
[time=2774] It's about your relationship with him and how in the willingness to remain under your
[time=2780] love for him, your trust in him, his work in you, the things he's unfolding, building in you, all that becomes clearer and clearer as the winds blow harder and harder and you
[time=2792] and I are willing to sit tight in him.
[time=2800] You know what else it does?
[time=2800] I was thinking about this just this morning.
[time=2804] When you're really, truly, honestly willing, in light of whatever it might be, however,
[time=2813] hard the winds might blow, however hard or heavy the rains may be coming down, no matter
[time=2820] how hopeless it might seem, your willingness to exercise a faith that would allow you to
[time=2826] sit under all that and not run.
[time=2829] You got to realize what that says to an on looking friend, to a family member, to somebody
[time=2839] at work, to somebody at school, students, do you understand?
[time=2844] I mean, can you grasp what that communicates and what that says when you sit under that
[time=2852] umbrella of trial and everything in you and certainly everything in them is saying to
[time=2858] you, get out, run for the hills, dude, and you sit there and you sit there with hope
[time=2867] and you sit there with conviction, understand what that says to them, understand the incredible
[time=2873] picture of trust and faith and conviction, things that they're looking for, things that
[time=2881] they know they need.
[time=2883] And in you and in me at times, we have the privilege of painting that picture to someone
[time=2890] who doesn't know what it means or hasn't experienced personal relationship with the living God.
[time=2899] Can I read this to you?
[time=2901] It says, in a commentary I read this week, actually somebody cut it out for me from William
[time=2907] Barkley, just listen to this, it's describing the essence, it's describing what that's sitting
[time=2913] under the umbrella of trial, it's describing what that should look like, because there's an important thing here, an important distinction that we should make, listen to this.
[time=2922] It's not the patience or endurance which can sit down and bow its head and let things descend upon it and passively endure it until the storm has passed.
[time=2932] See, that's me too often, okay, I'll just take it, go ahead, let it rain.
[time=2940] No, no, no, he goes on to say that the essence of Hupa Meno, it is the spirit which can bear things, not simply with resignation, but with blazing hope.
[time=2951] Now it's convicting for me when I read that, I don't know about you this morning as you hear it, but it was convicting for me as I read it, blazing hope, that is not the spirit which sits statically, enduring in the one place, but the spirit which bears things.
[time=2966] It bears things because it knows that these things are leading to a goal of glory.
[time=2970] It is not the patience which grimly waits for the end, but the patience which radiantly
[time=2976] hopes for the dawn, not an endurance that's resigned to just taking it, but a willingness
[time=2985] to wait, to grow, to see what God has for you with a radiant hope.
[time=2993] How about you this morning?
[time=2996] How about you this past week?
[time=2998] About you and I in the days and weeks and months ahead?
[time=3002] Not are we enduring, but how?
[time=3004] I mean, maybe it's, maybe we should just go back and say, are you?
[time=3008] Are you enduring?
[time=3010] Or are you running out from under the umbrella?
[time=3014] It's just to you, it seems like it's just too much.
[time=3018] And if you're willing to sit under it to see what God might have in store, how are you
[time=3024] enduring with a grim resignation or a blazing hope, not a happy giddiness that pretends
[time=3033] and wants to make people feel like everything's fine, no, but with a sense of confidence that
[time=3040] his love for you is great, his hand will never leave you, that it is well with your soul.
[time=3049] Number three, there's a request and I'm going to ask Corbin to come on up with the band and as they come on up, let me just explain number three to you.
[time=3056] You find it there in verses five, six, seven and eight, but if any of you lacks wisdom, let them ask of God who gives to all men generously and without reproach and it will be given to him, but let him ask in faith without any doubting for the one who doubts is like the
[time=3072] surf of the sea driven and tossed by the wind.
[time=3075] Here's the point, as I was reading through all this, this past week again, it dawns on
[time=3081] me that there's a little section break there in my Bible, almost as if verses five, six,
[time=3087] seven and eight kind of take us to a new thought.
[time=3091] And though in some ways it does, it was interesting this week to read how many made the connection between the request for wisdom and the ability to endure.
[time=3103] And I just thought about it in my own life and you know there's times where I just try to add it all up and what I know to be true about him and I run all that through my head
[time=3113] and sometimes having added it all up, I still feel stuck and it still feels like I can't
[time=3121] consider it joy and I find myself coming back to the oh and why, you know what, sometimes
[time=3127] I just need to and I do more often now than I used to, just get on my knees and beg him for wisdom, to beg him for his mind, his perspective.
[time=3137] It says ask him and he'll give it to you and it says ask him with faith, I don't know where you're at today, but whatever it is you might be facing.
[time=3146] There's a reason, there's a response and there's a request and if you need to just ask for strength for help, as it says in James 1 5, if you need to ask him for wisdom to better understand it, ask him, if you need some help, ask him come talk to us and let us ask
[time=3162] with you, let us stand next to you, let us walk through life together if we can.
[time=3167] Let me invite you to stand and as you stand I want to draw your attention to the screens.
[time=3172] It's a short but I think really powerful sweet tune that we've come across just lately by
[time=3179] a group called Mercy Me, it's on their second CD, it's at the very end of that CD and it's a short song that I think captures as we listen to it this week, it just captures the essence of how it is and why it is we can endure and I would just invite you to just listen very
[time=3195] closely, first time through and then Corbin's going to ask you, I think, sing with him and we'll close, but listen to the words, read the lyrics and understand this morning their
[time=3205] great truth and the strength that they bring.
[time=3212] Why do we do the things we do, how can we sing, when there seems no reason to, how do we
[time=3241] do when there's not much to smile about when the world is down, who are we to stand and
[time=3251] shout and they wonder why do the things we do, it's all because of this, it's all because
[time=3265] of this, taste and love, taste and hope, taste and hope the next, it's all because of this,
[time=3277] it's all because of this, taste and love, taste and hope, taste and hope the next.
[time=3289] And they wonder why do the things we do, we want to invite you this time to sing with
[time=3309] me if you can, well just intently look at the words and make it your prayer and your commitment
[time=3316] this morning, why do we do the things we do, how can we sing, when there seems no reason
[time=3331] to, how do we smile, when there's not much to smile about when the world is down, who
[time=3342] are we to stand and shout and they wonder why do the things we do, it's all because of this,
[time=3358] it's all because of this, taste and love, taste and hope, taste and hope the next, it's
[time=3368] all because of this, it's all because of this, taste and love, taste and hope, taste and
[time=3379] hope the last, hey man, would you bow, bow with me, bow your heads, bow your hearts?
[time=3406] And first of all let me just say this, we need to be grateful this morning before we go on
[time=3414] from this point, we need to be grateful and thankful for the life of a man named Tom Younger.
[time=3422] Tom Younger was the pastor at Emmanuel Baptist who back in the sixties had enough guts and enough humility and was willing to respond to a vision that God placed on his heart to
[time=3435] plant churches and not necessarily just grow his own but to give others the opportunity
[time=3443] and so he would almost on a yearly basis take faithful people like Bob and Mary Mishler and
[time=3450] seven other couples and send them to other parts of Fort Wayne and Wall and Baptist and
[time=3457] Westridge Baptist and Shof Park Baptist and Black Hawk and other churches were the result
[time=3464] of his willingness to send people out and this week he went to be with the Lord and boy
[time=3472] what a blessing that must be for him both and God's hand and God's love for Pastor Younger
[time=3480] was obvious all through those years and so we can just thank God for the legacy that
[time=3487] he has left behind and as you leave this morning don't forget there's one reason why we can endure there's one reason why we do the things we do, why we sing, why we shout, why we stand
[time=3500] and that's because we've tasted what it means and we know what it's like to be held by him
[time=3506] and his loving arms and Father we thank you for that this morning and as we go our prayer
[time=3512] is that that truth would give us the courage and the perspective needed to live a life that
[time=3518] would make a difference for you and for others bring us back together again soon in your son's
[time=3524] name we pray amen.
