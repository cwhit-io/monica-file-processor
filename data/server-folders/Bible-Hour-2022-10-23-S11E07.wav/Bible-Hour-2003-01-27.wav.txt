[time=90] - Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Black Hawk.
[time=109] And I'm so thankful that you've joined us again.
[time=112] And what you're about to see is a message that Mitch Cruz, one of our teaching pastors,
[time=120] and I did this past week, we have started a series in the book of James, and we come
[time=126] today to this passage towards the end of chapter one that talks about temptation and sin.
[time=133] And I guess I just felt compelled today to just, I guess, encourage you.
[time=138] I don't know, maybe remind you, for some of you, maybe I would need to plead with you.
[time=146] And I will, I'll plead with anybody who is experiencing what we see in this passage,
[time=154] the absolute destructive, deadly nature of sin.
[time=161] Sin is, sin is wicked stuff.
[time=164] You know it, and I know it.
[time=166] And what we see in this passage, and what I hope and pray, you'll open your heart and your eyes to today, is that there is a process that we go through.
[time=176] There is this thing called temptation, and there are these steps that we take, and there is a source.
[time=182] There is a place where all of it begins, and it's with the enemy.
[time=186] And he is so destructive, and he is so deceptive, and he wants nothing more than to see you and me ruined.
[time=194] And yet so many times we take it lightly.
[time=197] I was reminded this week all over again of what it says in James 4, where it says, "Resist him," it says, "Resist the devil, and he will flee from you."
[time=209] Do you realize that?
[time=210] I mean, do you know that?
[time=211] Have you claimed that truth in your life, that he is a defeated being, that in the end
[time=217] has no power?
[time=218] And if you and I are willing to resist him, it says, "Draw near to God."
[time=224] Resist the devil in James 4, 7, James 4, 8 says, "Draw near to God." And so our hope is that today, as you listen to this truth, and as you kind of take it in, that your heart and your mind would be renewed, and that you would find a strength to fight sin, and it's deadly destructive nature.
[time=244] And you know what?
[time=245] If we can help in any way, please let us.
[time=248] I keep meeting people.
[time=250] I met three last week after the service.
[time=253] I got letters, and I get emails, people who are watching on the Bible hour, who finally decide to come, and just meet us in person and come and worship with us, you know, live
[time=264] right there in the auditorium, and the encouragement that it's bringing people, the hope that it
[time=270] seems to be extending we're so very thankful for.
[time=273] And if you need some help, we'd love to meet you.
[time=275] Come by some week and let us kind of get face to face, and we hope today, as you listen
[time=282] to this truth from the book of James, that your heart and your life will be encouraged.
[time=287] Thanks.

[time=435] As we continue to worship, I want to encourage you to take whatever posture of worship you choose, whether it be to sit and meditate on his word through these songs, or to stand
[time=446] or to kneel, or however you feel led to connect best to your Creator.
[time=449] I just want to invite you to do that.
