[time=280] (audience applauds) - Hi I'm Kelly, senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries, and it is great to be together again with you.
[time=289] I am so grateful for the Bible hour and the opportunity we get week after week to hopefully make a difference in your lives to encourage you in some form or another.
[time=300] I had a chance Sunday this past week after one of our services to meet two families who had come to Black Hawk for the very first time last week.
[time=309] One was from Columbia City and the other one was from Warsaw and they had come all that way to join us.
[time=316] They'd been watching on the Bible hour and just felt compelled to come and be a part of what God was doing, kind of live and in person.
[time=323] Met some people recently who have been coming the last few months and they're from Van Wert, Ohio and just actually got in contact with someone yesterday from ASEAN and so when I see God at work through what we're able to provide here with the Bible hour and the lives of people right here in Fort Wayne and then even in these surrounding areas that just makes us really excited for what he allows to take place through the ministry of these broadcasts and we're so thankful that you're tuning in.
[time=356] I was thinking about how I could prepare you.
[time=359] Kind of just get you thinking in the right direction as we continue in our study of James today.
[time=365] And here's the picture that came to mind.
[time=367] You know, there will be times in my marriage with Deborah where she'll come to me with a concern.
[time=374] She'll come to me and want to talk to me about something and I can tell by the tone in her voice, I can tell by the look in her face that it's important.
[time=383] And at those times, I have a choice to make and I've learned over the years, we've been married 15 years and I know that if I listen to her with a certain mindset, I know that if I'm careful and thoughtful in the way that I listen to what she's about to say, there's a good chance that that discussion could go really well.
[time=406] It could be productive.
[time=408] I also know that if I'm not careful, if I come to that conversation and my heart isn't right and I'm not listening and my mindset and my attitude aren't where they should be, that conversation has the potential to kind of head south, to not go so well.
[time=425] What you'll see today and what we've been learning recently here is that as we come to this Word of God, as you and I come to the Scriptures, the discussion and the conversation that God has with us, there's a way that we can do that.
[time=438] There's a way that we can approach this and it go really well.
[time=447] And I hope today as you listen, I hope today as you think through these things with us that your heart would be open, the Word of God is so powerful and it can make such a difference in your life, how you approach it, how I approach it, is so very important.
[time=463] So I hope today that your heart and mind will be open and that you will be encouraged because of your time with us.

[time=705] (gentle music) - The house across the street had been for sale for over a year.
[time=714] The people who lived there downsized.
[time=716] They moved in September, and the house had empty until November of the following year.
[time=722] - We got a great deal on the house because the owners were anxious to sell.
[time=727] I wasn't looking forward to moving away from my family, but I got excited about decorating the nursery for our first child while all the excitement fizzled when a week before we moved I went to preterm labor and was ordered on bed rest for the remainder of my pregnancy.
[time=748] I saw the moving van in the driveway one morning as I drove my kids to school.
[time=752] And it was gone by the time I got home from work.
[time=755] Well, I thought I should take over some cookies or something, but before I knew it, a month had passed and I hadn't introduced myself.
[time=763] Come to think of it, I hadn't even seen them or the new neighbors that is, except for a man in a black SUV pulling up to the mailbox.
[time=773] My husband couldn't take off of work at being such a new position and all, and there I was, flat on my back in a new home, a new town, all alone every night until Brad got home after seven.
[time=789] I never saw any activity over there.
[time=791] No kids, garage drawers shut.
[time=795] The guy was probably single, but why would a single guy buy such a big house?
[time=800] Probably because he got such a great deal.
[time=803] I wanted to trust God to meet my needs, but I was filled with doubts.
[time=811] I doubted our decision to move, doubted we'd have a healthy baby, doubted I would ever feel at home in this new town, and yes, doubted that God cared.
[time=824] Sometimes it was even hard to pray, and then it was Christmas.
[time=833] I said to Glenn, my husband, we have got to meet the new neighbor across the street.
[time=838] Well, how about we take him some Christmas cookies?
[time=841] But then Glenn came down with the flu, Daniel was a shepherd in the nativity play, and grandma and the cousins came from Akron, stayed all the way through New Years.
[time=850] Though the new neighbor kept coming to mind, something always came up.
[time=855] My in-laws came for a few days over Christmas.
[time=860] It was nice to have the company, but I was terribly homesick and morning sick and not at all the hostess I wanted to be.
[time=870] A Bible verse I kept repeating over and over was,
[time=876] trust in the Lord with all your heart and do not depend on your own understanding.
[time=882] Trust, trust.
[time=887] I wanted to trust him to meet my needs.
[time=891] We scheduled the C-section and Jonathan was born,
[time=898] healthy and hungry on a Saturday morning in January.
[time=903] One Saturday afternoon, a blue stork appeared on the front lawn, a baby, and I didn't even know a wife existed.
[time=911] Well, I was determined to do what I knew I should have done months ago.
[time=916] So I drove to the grocery store asking God for wisdom on what to get.
[time=920] Chocolate chips for tall house cookies or spaghetti in a jar of ragu for a full-fledged meal.
[time=926] I came home with Jonathan when he was four days old.
[time=930] I was looking forward to getting out.
[time=933] But there were complications with my incision and we had a higher nurse to help.
[time=940] Trust in the Lord with all your heart.
[time=944] Lord, I am so homesick.
[time=950] I know I can't get home and mom can't get here,
[time=956] but please, pineapple?
[time=962] I have never, ever bought a whole fresh pineapple before.
[time=966] Never, but I don't know how else to say it.
[time=971] It was clear to me that I was supposed to buy a pineapple.
[time=975] So I bought not one, but two.
[time=978] Well, the way the produce guy described what it was like to slice one up, I thought I might need one to practice on.
[time=984] This is what I did.
[time=986] Well, the freshly sliced hacked pineapple looked less than appealing on a paper plate.
[time=994] So I dug out a little blue paper umbrella that I'd been pushing around in my junk drawer for years.
[time=998] You know, the kind you get in exotic drinks.
[time=1001] Well, it seemed appropriate being blue and it made the pineapple look a bit more festive.
[time=1005] I took a deep breath.
[time=1009] Pineapple?
[time=1011] It was unmistakable.
[time=1015] Yes, pineapple.
[time=1017] I left the house bearing the pineapple along with baked ham, potatoes, and a salad.
[time=1024] I heard the doorbell ringing.
[time=1027] Normally I wouldn't have made the effort to get up.
[time=1031] It was usually the FedEx guy.
[time=1033] But for some reason, I headed for the door.
[time=1035] Hi, I live across the street and I noticed the blue stork on your front lawn and I thought you might be able to use a home-cooked meal.
[time=1042] And oh, by the way, my name is Karen.
[time=1044] Are you feeling okay?
[time=1046] Karen shocked the socks off of me.
[time=1049] Not only was she the first person in the neighborhood to contact me, but she also told me she was a home healthcare nurse and she offered a check on me every day.
[time=1060] I had no idea she had been bedridden.
[time=1063] Well, I set my meal on the kitchen table and began making apologies for not coming sooner.
[time=1068] Oh, and for the hack job on the pineapple.
[time=1072] Pineapple?
[time=1073] You brought fresh pineapple?
[time=1077] How in the paper umbrella?
[time=1080] Oh, the pineapple brought tears to her eyes.
[time=1083] Allergies, do you have allergies?
[time=1085] Are you allergic to pineapple?
[time=1087] No, no.
[time=1089] I was born and raised in Hawaii and my entire family still lives there.
[time=1094] They haven't had the money to come visit.
[time=1097] The pineapple is a symbol of health, good fortune and hospitality.
[time=1102] And boy, I sure needed all three.
[time=1106] And the umbrella, it's exactly the kind of thing my mom would do.
[time=1111] I told her I couldn't take the credit.
[time=1114] The pineapple was God's idea.
[time=1117] And I told Karen that God met my needs through her.
[time=1122] Lisa and I became good friends.
[time=1123] We see each other almost every day.
[time=1126] Trust in the Lord with your whole heart.
[time=1136] (upbeat music)
[time=1166] (upbeat music) Good morning.
[time=1196] Anybody cry during that drama?
[time=1199] Man, what is it about that?
[time=1202] I cried in rehearsal, I cried first hour, I'm down here crying second hour.
[time=1206] And I'm trying to figure out what it is about that.
[time=1210] And there's things that come to my mind.
[time=1212] I think there's just a, there's something powerful about kindness.
[time=1217] Amen?
[time=1218] There's something really powerful about acts of kindness in a world that's not very kind.
[time=1225] A lot of other things come to my mind, but I guess I just want to say this to you.
[time=1229] I think part of the power of that is that there is power in the prompting of God.
[time=1235] God is at work prompting and nudging you.
[time=1241] I mean, come on, as you saw that Bob and I are sitting down here and both of us thinking about nudges we never followed up on, promptings we never responded to.
[time=1251] People, he's at work.
[time=1252] And for some crazy reason, he's chosen to work through you and through me, I don't get it.
[time=1258] But he nudges and he bumps and he says, "Hey, wake up." And I just think it's a powerful picture when you and I are willing to respond.
[time=1267] Well, welcome back.
[time=1269] We are gonna continue this morning in our study of this great book of James.
[time=1273] We come this morning to real faith's response to the word of God, real faith's response to the word of God.
[time=1280] So far, let's just back up real quick.
[time=1282] So far, we've seen that real faith, a genuine biblical faith will respond.
[time=1289] We've seen it already in a couple of different instances.
[time=1291] We've seen that real faith will respond in certain ways.
[time=1295] When faced with trial, it endures.
[time=1298] When faced with trial, it endures, not based on how it feels, but because of what it knows to be true about a good God.
[time=1306] When encountering temptation, it stays in the cove.
[time=1310] When encountering the lure and the temptation of the bait, it sits tight in the safe waters, eyes fixed on Jesus Christ.
[time=1320] Hebrew says the author and perfecter of our faith.
[time=1323] As we move on this morning in our look at chapter one, we see that there is another response, which James invites us to consider and we will do that together today.
[time=1332] How does real faith respond to God's word?
[time=1336] Today we'll look at two very important truths, having to do with the way we interact with.
[time=1342] Listen now, two very important truths, having to do with the way you and I interact with the word of God.
[time=1351] We will see that there is a proper way to receive it.
[time=1355] There's a proper way James says to receive God's word and there is, he says, a proper way to react to God's word.
[time=1364] Let's look at our text and consider the number, the first one there.
[time=1368] A proper reception of God's word, a proper reception of God's word.
[time=1375] Verse 19, 20 and 21, it says this, this you know, my beloved brethren, but let everyone be quick to hear, slow to speak and slow to anger.
[time=1385] For the anger of man does not achieve the righteousness of God and then it says in verse 21, therefore putting aside all filthiness and all that remains of wickedness in humility, receive the word in planet, which is able to save your souls.
[time=1402] Before we jump in, one thing very, very important to just note here, we know that he is referring in verse 19 where he talks about being quick to hear and slow to speak and slow to anger.
[time=1413] We know that he is referring to the way we receive God's word because of what it says in verse 18.
[time=1419] Remember, whenever you're studying God's word, you always stay within the context of what has been given.
[time=1426] So many people come to James 1, 19 and 20 and they think, and I've even heard it said, that really this is just a couple of verses that James just kind of threw in, kind of proverbial type wisdom verses that just are good for us to be reminded of.
[time=1443] And you know what?
[time=1444] The things that you see there in 19 and 20 are very good things to be reminded of.
[time=1449] And Proverbs does address those very things as it relates to just general living.
[time=1456] Proverbs 10, Proverbs 16, Proverbs 17, I think in Ecclesiastes 7 it talks about those things.
[time=1461] In our text this morning, that's not what he's talking about.
[time=1465] He's not talking about just a general kind of wisdom type response to life.
[time=1470] No, he is talking about your response in mind to the very word of God.
[time=1475] How do we know that?
[time=1476] The context.
[time=1478] Look back one verse to verse 18.
[time=1480] It says there in the exercise of his will.
[time=1484] He brought us forth by the word of truth.
[time=1488] By the word of truth so that we might be as it were the first fruits among his creatures.
[time=1493] Here's how you wanna say that.
[time=1495] Having been made new, you see it there?
[time=1497] Having brought us forth, having been made regenerate.
[time=1500] Having come to our salvation by the power of God's word.
[time=1504] Having been made new.
[time=1506] By the power of the scriptures, he says now be careful how you take it in.
[time=1512] Be careful how you receive it.
[time=1514] Real faith.
[time=1517] Are you with me?
[time=1519] Is willing to receive truth with some things in mind.
[time=1524] And I wanna give you three right here this morning.
[time=1527] Got your pins ready?
[time=1528] Here we go.
[time=1529] Real faith is willing to receive truth with number one.
[time=1532] Write this down.
[time=1533] A submissive heart.
[time=1538] But let everyone be quick to hear and slow to speak and slow to anger.
[time=1542] For the anger of man doesn't achieve the righteousness of God.
[time=1547] Real faith is willing to receive truth with a submissive heart.
[time=1551] Well, what's a submissive heart?
[time=1552] Those three things that you saw right there.
[time=1555] A submissive heart.
[time=1556] A heart that takes in the word of God with a submissive spirit is number one.
[time=1560] Write it down quick to hear.
[time=1563] Quick to hear.
[time=1564] What does that mean?
[time=1565] It means this.
[time=1566] Quick to, ready to anxious to.
[time=1568] Aggressively wanting to see the opportunity to receive God's word as an absolute utter privilege.
[time=1577] Absolutely quick to hear is to pursue every opportunity there is.
[time=1581] To take in and learn more of his truth.
[time=1588] When trials come, God's word provides strength and hope.
[time=1592] And so I'm quick to take it in.
[time=1595] When temptation rears its ugly head, it's God's word that provides stability and direction.
[time=1601] And so I'm quick to take it in.
[time=1604] You see, when real faith opens itself up to the word of God, it is quick.
[time=1609] I mean, it can't wait to put itself in a posture and in a position where it can receive the life-giving truth.
[time=1617] Quick to hear.
[time=1619] When these doors open every Sunday morning, when this place opens every Wednesday night, when your Bible study meets, when your men's group meets, when your women's group meets, when your small group meets, when your connection class or ABF class meets, when you sit in the quiet of your room in the early morning hours or late at night, real faith has a quickness, real faith has a strong insatiable desire to open itself up to the word of truth.
[time=1649] Is that way for you?
[time=1656] I mean, are you really, really looking forward to getting in these doors?
[time=1661] Not because of, not because of him, not because of me, but because of this, and the privilege we have, the utter privilege that is ours, to be people who hear it and who hear it quickly.
[time=1675] With an anxious, aggressive, open, can't wait to be their heart.
[time=1682] It says in Matthew 4, I think, Jesus said, "Man cannot live on bread alone, right, but on every what, on every word." You know, I still, I look at it, and I'm not trying to make my experience yours, but I'm just telling you, that's how he's growing me.
[time=1698] It's life.
[time=1699] I mean, it's food, I mean, it's the stuff that we've got to take in.
[time=1704] And it's so important, and it means so much, and it does so much, and it changes me.
[time=1711] You and I, we can't wait.
[time=1713] Real faith can't wait.
[time=1715] It's quick to hear it.
[time=1716] Receiving God's word with a submissive heart also entails that I am slow to speak.
[time=1722] Slow to speak, write these things down.
[time=1725] James 3, one to two.
[time=1727] First Timothy 3, 6.
[time=1730] First Timothy 5, 22, in those three passages and other places in our New Testament, especially.
[time=1738] James 3, first Timothy 3, first Timothy 5, all these passages speak to this very point, and they in essence say this, look, be passionate, yes.
[time=1746] Be hungry.
[time=1747] Be quick to hear it.
[time=1749] Be very, very cautious.
[time=1751] Better yet, be slow to speak it.
[time=1756] Be careful, he says.
[time=1759] Before you stand and proclaim it, before you stand, and with others say this is what it's saying, before you or I ever, in any setting, be it with five, be it with 50 or 500, he says be very, very careful.
[time=1775] Those of you who would desire to, those of you who would feel led to communicate it.
[time=1782] Be careful.
[time=1784] Quick to hear it, slow to speak it.
[time=1788] In receiving God's word were to be quick to listen, slow to speak, and it says they're slow.
[time=1796] Look at the end of verse 19.
[time=1797] You see it there, slow to anger.
[time=1800] For the anger of man, it says in 20, doesn't achieve the righteousness of God.
[time=1805] Interesting again here, please just keep it in the context.
[time=1808] James isn't referring here to outward bursts of anger.
[time=1813] This is not James bringing some kind of admonishment or reminder to you and I about some external popping of a gasket.
[time=1823] No, if that had been his intent, he would have used the Greek word fumas, but he didn't.
[time=1829] He used the Greek word orge, which means this, watch this.
[time=1835] He's talking about a deep internal resentment towards the word, interesting.
[time=1842] He's talking about an internal resentment, a bitterness toward the scriptures, an attitude of angry rejection.
[time=1849] Orge is the word that he uses there.
[time=1856] You see what he's saying?
[time=1858] Sometimes, that's the response of your heart.
[time=1866] You see, sometimes God's word disagrees with my opinion.
[time=1871] You see, sometimes God's word does what it says there in Hebrews because it's double-edged.
[time=1878] Sometimes when you and I sit in settings where the word of God comes in, it pierces us.
[time=1883] It exposes us and it shows you clearly your rebellious heart, your unconfessed sin, your disobedient attitude.
[time=1891] I mean, it just lays you open.
[time=1895] The truth that gets taught, the things that get said, right here from this book, oftentimes, leave us absolutely resentful.
[time=1904] And instead of yielding to it, instead of submitting to it, we walk out these doors, you and I at times, almost having these private conversations with God.
[time=1915] Like, who do you think you are?
[time=1917] I mean, we're walking and we're smiling and we're getting to the car, but in our gut, we're thinking, you know what?
[time=1922] You don't understand where I'm living.
[time=1925] You don't understand, God, what I'm facing.
[time=1929] Do this and go here and have this attitude, right?
[time=1933] Anger.
[time=1938] The internal resentment from an exposure to the word of God, truth.
[time=1944] And you know, sometimes it's not just an anger, you know, that's at God, sometimes the anger even spills over toward the messenger.
[time=1952] You wouldn't believe the letters and emails that I get sometimes from people still in that state.
[time=1961] And I know, I've not been there.
[time=1962] I don't get mad at them, I just identify with them.
[time=1966] They've called me, they've called me arrogant.
[time=1970] They call me judgmental.
[time=1971] They say I'm a harsh one gal a few months ago, called me a meddler, said I was messing with her head.
[time=1977] One guy said he hated me.
[time=1982] You've been there, I've been there, you know,
[time=1988] just so torn up inside, so hurting.
[time=1992] And the truth comes in and exposes us and we just say stuff.
[time=1996] And I try to and you try to just lovingly remind them, you know what, I didn't write it, I'm just telling you what it says.
[time=2003] It's not me, it's him.
[time=2004] Don't be heart-hearted.
[time=2008] Real faith, as it receives God's word in whatever setting that might be in, isn't heart-hearted, it's slow, slow to angry, slow to anger.
[time=2021] And James tells us here, take it in with a soft, submissive heart, eager to hear it, slow to speak it, and thankful for it, not resentful.
[time=2029] Real faith is willing to receive truth with a pure heart too.
[time=2035] Let's keep going through these first few verses.
[time=2038] Real faith is willing to receive truth with a pure heart.
[time=2043] Look at verse 21, first part of verse 21, therefore putting aside all filthiness and all that remains of wickedness.
[time=2052] See, in this discussion that we're having here about a proper way of receiving God's word, not only are we to do it with a submissive heart, but it says here with a pure heart, therefore putting aside all filthiness and all that remains of wickedness.
[time=2065] We're to come, we're to receive God's word clean.
[time=2068] Think about that.
[time=2070] There seems to be some emphasis here being made to your willingness in mind to come into these settings.
[time=2076] And yes, you know what I believe sometimes he uses these settings to move us toward purity.
[time=2083] And I think it's okay to see it that way.
[time=2085] There's also a sense, I think, of preparation.
[time=2087] You know, when the dinner bell rings, we're all supposed to go wash our what?
[time=2092] Hands, we do it for dinner.
[time=2095] I'm thinking about all the things in life that we go and get clean for.
[time=2099] I'm thinking about all the things in life that we go and get tidied up for, you know?
[time=2103] When it's time to eat, you wash your hands.
[time=2106] When it's time to race, you take off the sweats.
[time=2110] When the diaper's bad, you change it.
[time=2115] I was reminded recently that there are different definitions of bad when it comes to diapers.
[time=2122] It's true.
[time=2123] Mitch Cruz and I, Mitch is one of our teaching pastors.
[time=2127] And he and I were volunteered a few weeks ago to help with mops.
[time=2132] He and I just jumped in and we were watching the two-year-olds.
[time=2135] We did that last year, had a great time.
[time=2137] Actually this year was a little bit more low-key than last year.
[time=2141] Last year with the two-year-olds, we thought we'd play dodgeball.
[time=2144] And then we realized they didn't know how to dodge.
[time=2147] We kind of got a little trouble on that one.
[time=2151] But this year it was much more tame.
[time=2153] But we were in there with Nancy Mitchell.
[time=2155] Gal from our church, and Nancy and Mitch now, we're just talking about the lessons we've learned on diapers.
[time=2158] And I've just come a long way, 'cause I just remember early on with the whole kit thing, a diaper, in my opinion, needed to be changed when you would start to see the little gel pellets on the ground from one that had just busted open, you know?
[time=2174] That was always the time to change it in my book.
[time=2177] But we change it, don't we?
[time=2178] We get rid of dirty stuff.
[time=2183] We do it all the time.
[time=2183] Look at Hebrews 12, same idea, exact same phraseology.
[time=2188] Look at Hebrews 12.
[time=2190] Hebrews 12 one says, "Therefore, since we have so great "a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, "let us also lay aside." There it is.
[time=2197] Get rid of, take off, be done with.
[time=2200] Every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us and let us then run with endurance, the race that is set before us.
[time=2208] Go over to first Peter chapter two, go past the book of James.
[time=2212] Just one book, to first Peter chapter two, says it so well right here.
[time=2215] Same phraseology again, exact same Greek root words.
[time=2219] Therefore, putting aside all malice, verse one, and all guile and hypocrisy and envy and all slander like newborn babes, long people.
[time=2230] He says long for the pure milk of the word that by it you may grow in respect to salvation.
[time=2238] Putting aside, putting aside, taking and putting over here,
[time=2244] taking off, the picture comes to my mind of that excitement that I felt as a kid and you may be able to identify with this, you may not be, but I remember being a kid and whenever it was time to go swimming, remember going swimming, I don't care if it was a lake, I don't care if it was a pool, I don't care if it was a hotel or the pool, there was the sense that when it was time to go swimming, man, you couldn't wait.
[time=2264] Remember, you just tore your clothes off, you just put on your suit and you couldn't wait to get to the pool and he says, you know what?
[time=2271] Your sin's the very same way and when you're coming to me and when you're coming to my word, come clean, change your clothes, get them off.
[time=2277] Rip them off and throw them away.
[time=2282] Tie up the loose ends, put it in the plastic bag and get it out, it stinks.
[time=2287] He calls it filthiness and wickedness.
[time=2290] He says, when you come to me, when you come to this word,
[time=2296] get rid of it, filthiness, the word there in the Greek, go back to James 1, 21, therefore putting aside all filthiness, that word means literally dirty clothes, that word literally means external acts of sin that smell.
[time=2312] And all that remains of wickedness, that word there literally means dirty desires, evil, sinful desires, it speaks to the internal evil.
[time=2320] One word there speaks to the external stuff that stinks, the other word speaks to the internal stuff that stinks just as much and he says, all of it, get rid of it.
[time=2328] You throw it away, putting aside all filthiness
[time=2334] and all that remains of wickedness.
[time=2340] I think about our times, I think about our times here together as we come to the word.
[time=2347] And my mind just this week went to, and it again happened this morning, you know, I think about those first 30 minutes that we get to spend together in here.
[time=2355] And what an amazing chance that is, what a great opportunity that is for you and I, as we're preparing to come to the word, to purify and cleanse our hearts.
[time=2365] What are you doing in those first 30 minutes?
[time=2369] What are you just singing songs?
[time=2371] Oh, okay, but you know what?
[time=2374] There's so much more there for us and for you.
[time=2377] It's an opportunity to let the truth of the lyrics, the thing, the words that you see on these screens and the music that's played, it's an opportunity for you and I to engage with a holy God who was welcoming us into his presence and in those 30 minutes say things that need to be said, thank him for things he needs to be thanked for, confess sin and make things right.
[time=2400] And do it all in the absolute utter privilege of corporate worship, you and I standing here together.
[time=2406] James is saying, take 'em off.
[time=2410] All evil actions, all evil intentions.
[time=2413] And receive God's word with a pure heart.
[time=2418] And then he says with all humility, receive the word.
[time=2423] Next point, real faith is willing to receive the truth with a humble heart, write it down.
[time=2428] With a humble heart.
[time=2430] Therefore putting aside all filthiness and all that remains of wickedness, here you go.
[time=2435] In humility, receive the word in planted, which is able to save your souls.
[time=2441] You know what he's saying?
[time=2443] He's saying every time you come to worship here in this place, every time, back to what I said before, every time you're on your own with God in whatever place or setting you're in.
[time=2452] A men's group, a women's group, a small group, a connection class, no matter where it is you've come to receive and take in the word of God.
[time=2459] He says come with a humble heart.
[time=2462] And here's a definition for you.
[time=2464] There's tons of them.
[time=2465] We just picked one that seemed to work best.
[time=2467] Here it is, a willing, ready, and major, major word here, teachable heart.
[time=2472] Are you teachable?
[time=2474] You know, we talk about kids being teachable.
[time=2479] We talk about classroom behavior.
[time=2480] We talk about attitudes on an athletic team or in some, after school, we talk about them being teachable.
[time=2489] Do you come into this setting?
[time=2492] Do you come into other settings where the word of God has come?
[time=2495] And are you teachable?
[time=2496] Are you really open?
[time=2500] Are you willing, ready, and teachable in your heart?
[time=2504] Just thinking about it.
[time=2508] I didn't want to just leave you with a, kind of a big picture question.
[time=2513] So I just tried to, I just tried to think it through practically.
[time=2517] All right, so shoe fits, wear it, if not great.
[time=2520] Thank you for being so teachable.
[time=2522] Here's a few questions for you and for me.
[time=2525] You can kind of just go down through the list.
[time=2527] Kind of gauge yourself.
[time=2528] Give yourself a teachable, humble heart grade.
[time=2531] First question, here's an idea.
[time=2534] What time do you go to bed on Saturday night?
[time=2540] I'm gonna tell you what, there are events in my life and I bet there are for you.
[time=2544] I mean, there are events in our life and we are so jacked up for these things.
[time=2549] We are so ready for this event that I'm telling you days before it, we start getting ready.
[time=2555] We start eating right, or we start sleeping right, or we start thinking right.
[time=2559] I mean, there are events in life that we can't wait to get to.
[time=2563] And so we do everything within our power to come to that event, rested and ready and sharp and alert, and I love you.
[time=2573] You know I love you.
[time=2574] And I'm not the most exciting, best communicator in the world.
[time=2578] But sometimes, and the room gets warm, I know it and you're squeezed together, but sometimes it's tough and the head starts to bob and the elbows start to fly.
[time=2590] And sometimes I know that just happens and sometimes you're up late 'cause you had to be.
[time=2595] I'm just asking.
[time=2598] Bob mentioned to me earlier, in the Jewish tradition, the Sabbath started the night before.
[time=2603] You think about this, the night before?
[time=2608] Is this privileged opportunity to meet with God?
[time=2614] This privileged opportunity to meet with the family of God, I mean, do you get ready for this?
[time=2618] You bring a pen?
[time=2622] I know, some of you say I'm not a, I don't learn like that, I'm not a note taker.
[time=2627] Well, all right, I'm just asking.
[time=2629] I'm just wondering, you know, if having just a few things jotted down, just a few things maybe for you to look at on Tuesday or Thursday might bring your mind and your will back to a place of truth and health.
[time=2643] Just an idea.
[time=2644] Are you an edge of the seat?
[time=2649] You know, participant?
[time=2652] I think about kids, I've coached a lot.
[time=2654] I think about kids in huddles.
[time=2656] I don't care what kind of huddle it is.
[time=2657] There's those kids, you get into that huddle and they're on the edge of their seat.
[time=2660] And that kid being on the edge of the seat, it just says one thing really clear.
[time=2665] It just says, tell me what to do.
[time=2667] It just says, just go ahead, just tell me.
[time=2669] I'll just, I'll do anything.
[time=2670] He's on the edge of a seat.
[time=2672] And then there's kids in huddles who sit back.
[time=2675] Kind of arms around the chair.
[time=2676] And I see it sometimes in here.
[time=2680] And it kind of says, go ahead.
[time=2685] Try and teach me something.
[time=2686] 700 people just scooted up in their seats.
[time=2693] Are you an arms folded?
[time=2697] Arms just went down everywhere.
[time=2701] Are you an arms folded?
[time=2702] Listener, are you a leaning forward listener?
[time=2706] I mean, I'm just asking for you and I to think through.
[time=2711] The spirit with which we come.
[time=2713] The humility of our heart.
[time=2714] Our openness and our willingness and our eagerness to learn.
[time=2718] And you know, I'll tell you why it's that way for me because I'm more and more so in my life.
[time=2722] The more and more I understand me and the more and more I understand him and the more and more I see this.
[time=2726] I've come to the point where I'm trying to be in touch with reality.
[time=2731] And reality states clearly to me every day of my life that I am in desperate need of this.
[time=2740] And maybe you just don't feel that way yet.
[time=2744] But I hope you'll get there.
[time=2747] Because if you're in touch with reality, you know that you have got to have this and you've got to have this.
[time=2755] And it becomes so very important that you come in position and posture yourself in such a way that you get the privilege of taking it in.
[time=2765] And you don't have it all figured out.
[time=2767] And you don't know all the answers.
[time=2769] And half the time like me, you're wrong.
[time=2771] And you need adjusting.
[time=2773] And this is the tool God uses.
[time=2776] And so he says come and receive it with a humble, open, teachable heart.
[time=2781] Interesting phrase there at the end before we move on.
[time=2787] Therefore putting aside all filthiness and all that remains of wickedness in humility.
[time=2791] Watch this, receive the word implanted which is able to save your souls.
[time=2797] It says the word implanted in the Greek that phrase would literally read like this which is able to and continually does save your soul.
[time=2807] It's in the present participle.
[time=2808] It's an ongoing, continuous action.
[time=2811] Interesting, I thought.
[time=2814] How does the word in an ongoing sense in my life saved me?
[time=2820] Wasn't I in fact saved at one point?
[time=2823] Well, yes, that's true.
[time=2826] But I love how this plays out.
[time=2829] Read this quote with me.
[time=2830] Thought it to be very, very powerful.
[time=2833] It says by the power of the word, the believer has been saved from the penalty of sin, is being saved from the power of sin and will ultimately be saved from the presence of sin.
[time=2847] The word is so very powerful, folks.
[time=2851] And from the moment you come to this place of full surrender as you begin with me to then walk through this life, the word of God is active and it is continually, it starts here, it does it here and it continues down here to save us, which is literally able to, it says, "They're save your souls." See, here's the deal.
[time=2878] James is, God is telling us through James to have a submissive heart, to have a pure heart and to have a humble heart.
[time=2889] Now watch, and if you, you, if you will come to this with that posture, he will grow you, he will stretch you, he will challenge you, he will enlighten you.
[time=2901] And do you realize how much pressure that takes off me?
[time=2907] See, I'm not that good.
[time=2909] Mitch and Steve, we're not that good.
[time=2911] It's not about the speaker, it's about the truth that the guys trying to communicate and we just try and get out of its way.
[time=2920] And if you'll come into this place with a submissive heart and a pure heart and a humble heart, it just does its thing in you and it's an amazing thing to watch take place.
[time=2930] Here's a picture that I wanna give you.
[time=2940] It's a pretty simple one, but a really, really powerful one.
[time=2944] I heard a good friend of mine use this.
[time=2948] In fact, he used it, I think in chapel here with our kids, my kids came home that day from chapel talking about this.
[time=2957] And the more I've thought about it, the more I've heard him talk about it, it's one of the clearest, for a mind like mine, I guess I should say, my mind's pretty simple.
[time=2968] One of the clearest pictures I've ever seen.
[time=2971] You see, sometimes we're not very submissive to the word, are you?
[time=2980] You're not, are you?
[time=2983] Go ahead and nod your head.
[time=2985] You're not, are you?
[time=2986] You see, sometimes we're not very pure as we come to it.
[time=2990] And so oftentimes, you know what?
[time=2992] You don't come into this place and we don't open this together with humble, really teachable hearts.
[time=2999] And that represents a heart of stone.
[time=3003] You think you've got it figured out.
[time=3007] You think maybe you've heard enough, I don't know.
[time=3010] Or you got so much junk going on that hasn't been dealt with that you haven't at least just confessed, it's hard for anything to even get through.
[time=3018] Or you're not submissive in your heart.
[time=3023] You're not quick to hear it.
[time=3025] You're always getting here late.
[time=3028] You don't make preparations on Saturday night 'cause you don't really care that much.
[time=3034] You see, sometimes the condition of our hearts is this right here, just as hard as rock.
[time=3040] And what James says to you and what James says to me today, and I love this, this is a big white ball of Play-Doh.
[time=3054] Right there.
[time=3054] And that's the ticket, folks.
[time=3057] Submissive, you know what?
[time=3061] Because sometimes God's word says that as he gets to know you and as he gets to know me, sometimes God's word says, "You know what I need you to do, I need you to do this." And sometimes God's word says, "You know what?" And now I need to kind of have you do this.
[time=3081] And the whole while you and I are going, yeah.
[time=3085] Just go ahead and do that.
[time=3087] Just shake me, just mold me.
[time=3089] Just keep working on me.
[time=3091] Just keep doing your thing.
[time=3093] And I'll just stay as soft and as moldable, as humble and as pure white, white Play-Doh.
[time=3098] Love the way Play-Doh smells.
[time=3100] You like Play-Doh?
[time=3101] It's awesome.
[time=3102] Hey, and guess what's all over this Play-Doh?
[time=3104] Right now.
[time=3105] Guess what's there right now?
[time=3110] My what?
[time=3111] My hand print.
[time=3113] I love that picture.
[time=3114] And so many times you and I are so unwilling to let him just put his hands around us through his word and say, "There, that's what I want for you.
[time=3125] "It's not bad, it's good." Play-Doh, soft, pure and white, mold me, shape me.
[time=3138] Not rock, not stone, not proud.
[time=3141] Oh my goodness.
[time=3144] People, do you realize?
[time=3146] Do you understand what could happen in your life?
[time=3149] Do you realize that then if you took your life and the rest of our lives and if together, we really came before God in his word, day after day, week after week, like a bunch of white Play-Doh, what he would do?
[time=3162] What that would look like, amen.
[time=3167] Think about it and let me just say one more thing and we're gonna go.
[time=3172] Not only does James I here talk about a proper reception of God's word, he also talks about a proper reaction.
[time=3181] And it's pretty simple, pretty straightforward and we may come back and hit it some more next week but I wanted to say it to you this morning.
[time=3187] A proper reaction, look at verse 22, "But prove yourselves, doers of the word." Having gone to all these lengths to take it in, having given yourself to it submissively, having made yourself clean in order to receive it fully, having come with a humble, open, teachable heart.
[time=3208] Now you've received the word of God implanted, he says, now do it.
[time=3213] And if you don't do it, if you go through all that, if you see all this to be true and the word of God comes and you don't, look what he says, for if anyone is a hearer of the word, sitting there in your pew, nodding your head, supposedly taking it all in, if you're a hearer of the word and not a doer.
[time=3233] James says you're like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror, for once he has looked at himself and gone away, he has immediately forgotten what kind of person he was.
[time=3246] Hey folks, look at me.
[time=3247] You understand what that's saying?
[time=3249] Let's just cut to the chase, we'll just be really, really blunt.
[time=3255] You just picture yourself, you picture anybody, picture me, me looking at ourselves in the mirror, walking away and immediately forgetting what we saw.
[time=3265] I mean, that person, the person who would do that, that person is, I mean, it says here that he's a, he's a forgetful hearer.
[time=3277] It's just dumb.
[time=3281] It's just just idiotic.
[time=3284] It just doesn't make any sense is what he's saying.
[time=3289] You just don't do that.
[time=3291] He chooses an illustration that points out the clarity of how utterly ridiculous it would be for you and I to think that we can take it in and not do it.
[time=3302] For once he has looked at himself and gone away,
[time=3308] he has immediately forgotten what kind of person he was, but be this, one who looks intently at the perfect law, the law of liberty and abides by it, not having become a forgetful hearer, but an effectual doer.
[time=3321] This man shall be blessed in what he does.
[time=3326] That's just really, really clear.
[time=3331] That's just a promise right there that kind of wraps that up right there that you and I should hang on to.
[time=3337] Your willingness in mind to give ourselves of this discussion comes where it says that man, that woman, that individual will be blessed.
[time=3349] How are you receiving God's word?
[time=3353] He needs some help, ask.
[time=3358] He needs some accountability.
[time=3360] Let's help get it done.
[time=3362] There are so many of you here today and for many of you here today, this has been a reminder of truth that has been revealed to you in the past.
[time=3370] And hopefully it's been a good reminder because it came from here.
[time=3374] For others of you here this morning, you know what, you're still thinking this faith thing through.
[time=3379] You don't have a faith that works yet because you don't have a faith yet.
[time=3382] You haven't fully surrendered your heart and life to him.
[time=3385] We want you to know, we want you to see, we would want you to experience what it's like to be in relationship with a living God and able to come to this and have this mean something to you.
[time=3399] So let us help come down and talk to us afterwards if you need to, make that phone call today to a good friend who you know will listen and help you better understand truth.
[time=3410] But there may be somebody here today and you just need today to put a stake in the ground and to get this relationship with God, a fully surrendered heart.
[time=3424] You just need to get that taken care of.
[time=3427] You need to get that done.
[time=3430] Let us help you if we can.
[time=3431] Would you stand and let's pray as we go?
[time=3434] Let me invite you if you would to just bow your heads, bow your hearts and let's just before him thank him for the privilege that has been ours.
[time=3444] Would you pray with me father?
[time=3447] We come before you today.
[time=3448] And as we look at this passage here in James, God, we've been reminded of what an incredibly powerful thing is
[time=3458] what an incredible tool, a life changing, life giving tool you've given us in these ancient words.
[time=3466] And they are ever true and they are changing us and they are growing us and they continue to point us toward truth and what is right.
[time=3475] And God, where it's painful and where it's scary and where we need courage, God, please grant it.
[time=3481] Oh, the Spirit of God and the people of God and the Word of God would do their work in our lives.
[time=3488] And God, we pray that we could then be a people that could impact love and encourage others in that same vein.
[time=3497] We pray God for those who are here today and they know you and they've been walking with you for months, maybe years.
[time=3505] God, I pray that today would make a difference, would renew our commitment to come to your Word with a proper attitude and mindset.
[time=3515] And God, for those still searching, we pray that you would bring clarity, maybe a listening ear, a conversation that needs to take place.
[time=3522] God, we thank you for giving us the privilege of being here, bring us back together again soon if that be your will and we'll thank you for it and all the people agreed and said amen.
[time=3545] (gentle music)
