[time=30] (upbeat music)
[time=83] Worship the Lord and the splendor of His holiness, tremble before Him, all the earth.
[time=89] I will proclaim the name of the Lord.
[time=92] O praise the greatness of our God.
[time=95] He is the rock.
[time=96] His works are perfect.
[time=98] And all his ways are just.
[time=101] A faithful God who does no wrong, a bright and just is He.
[time=107] Just is He.
[time=109] And Jesus said, Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me.
[time=118] Rejoice and be glad because great is your reward in heaven.
[time=123] For in the same way, they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
[time=128] - The prophets who were before you.
[time=131] Daniel.
[time=132] - Praise be to the name of God forever and ever.
[time=135] Wisdom and power are His.
[time=137] - Habakkuk.
[time=139] - Though the fig tree does not bud, and there are no grapes on the vines, though the olive crop fails, and the fields produce no food.
[time=148] Though there are no sheep in the pen, and no cattle in the stalls, yet I will rejoice in the Lord.
[time=156] I will be joyful in God my Savior.
[time=159] The sovereign Lord is my strength.
[time=162] - And Jesus said, You have heard that it was said, You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.
[time=169] But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven, for He makes His Son rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.
[time=187] - On the good and on the evil.
[time=189] - The sun rises.
[time=191] - From the rising of the sun to the place where it sets, the name of the Lord is to be praised.
[time=197] The Lord is exalted over all nations, His glory above the heavens.
[time=203] - On the unjust and on the just, it rains.
[time=208] - Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked I will depart.
[time=212] The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away.
[time=215] May the name of the Lord be praised.
[time=218] - Among the gods, there is none like you, O Lord.
[time=221] No deeds can compare with yours, for you do great and marvelous deeds.
[time=226] - You alone are God.
[time=228] - Teach me your way, O Lord, and I will walk in your truth.
[time=232] Give me an undivided heart that I may fear your name.
[time=236] I will praise you, O Lord, my God, with all my heart.
[time=239] I will glorify your name forever.
[time=242] - Blessed be your glorious name, and may it be exalted above all blessings and praise.
[time=249] You alone are the Lord.
[time=252] - You made the heavens even the highest heavens.
[time=255] - And all their starry hosts.
[time=258] - The earth, and all that is on it.
[time=260] - The seas, and all that is in them.
[time=263] - You give life to everything and the multitudes of heaven worship you.
[time=267] - And the nations you have made will come and worship before you, O Lord.
[time=271] They will bring glory to your name.
[time=273] - Praise be to his glorious name forever.
[time=276] May the whole earth be filled with his glory.
[time=279] - Glorify the Lord with me.
[time=282] - Let us exalt his name together.
[time=284] - Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=289] And thank you again for joining us here on The Bible Hour.
[time=292] I wanted to ask you a question if I could really maybe ask you a favor.
[time=297] And periodically I do this.
[time=299] I am so thankful for the many, many people.
[time=303] I mean, you have no idea how much time and effort is put in by so many folks to help bring this broadcast to you each and every week.
[time=312] And you've done this before, so I thought I'd just ask you again.
[time=315] Would you take some time in maybe just the next couple of days to email me or to send me a letter or to somehow communicate with us just your appreciation for what God is doing through this ministry, the ministry of the Bible Hour in your life, or maybe the life of a friend, maybe somebody that you know at work who watches.
[time=335] I mean, just you sharing with us stories of God using this effort to either grow somebody in their faith or maybe God's using it to bring someone to faith for the very first time.
[time=346] Either way, you can reach us at www.blackhawkministries.org.
[time=352] And you can shoot me personally, an email.
[time=355] I'd love to hear from you.
[time=356] And then I can pass that on.
[time=358] It means so much to this team when they hear from you and when they see what God is doing through their efforts.
[time=365] I also wanted to just encourage you with regard to the message that you'll hear today.
[time=370] We have been right here in this room, each and every week for the last month, going through this incredible book of James.
[time=378] It's been a wonderful study.
[time=380] It's been challenging to me personally.
[time=382] And it's been so fun to see the people respond and interact to what it says there.
[time=386] Today's message is a tough one.
[time=389] I felt probably more convicted personally about this one than any message I've done in recent years.
[time=397] You see, what it talks about in James chapter two is this, you and I, we have this incredible tendency to look at people in our world and categorize them.
[time=409] And not only do we categorize them or discriminate in a sense, but then we treat them differently based upon the category that they're in.
[time=418] And we do it all the time.
[time=419] We see, I see through my eyes, I see rich people and I see poor people.
[time=424] I see easy to get along with people and I see difficult people.
[time=428] I see red, yellow, black and white people.
[time=431] And you know what the passage tells us today is this, the passage today says, don't categorize.
[time=437] Be willing to not show partiality, to treat people and love people and extend yourself to people no matter who they are, no matter what they look like, no matter how they treat you.
[time=448] And you know why we can do that?
[time=449] We can do that because the God we serve is a God who in his very nature and character doesn't show any partiality.
[time=456] He is impartial.
[time=458] He extends his love to you and to me.
[time=461] He extends himself to everybody, regardless of where they've been, who they are, the color of their skin, the amount of money they make.
[time=468] And so I hope today as you listen, that you'll open your heart in your mind.
[time=472] Maybe there's some things there that God wants to work on.
[time=475] We're so thankful that you're with us.
[time=478] And our hope, my prayer, is that because of our time together today, your heart will be changed.
[time=484] Thanks.
[time=485] - His lightning lights up the world.
[time=489] The earth sees and trembles.
[time=491] The mountains melt like wax before the Lord of all the earth.
[time=495] The heavens proclaim his righteousness and all the people, his glory.
[time=499] And stand together and give him praise.
[time=506] And sing it again.
[time=508] [MUSIC - 47 seconds]
[time=560] - A couple of weeks ago, Kelly described that our trials and tribulations that we face sometimes in this world, they're like rain.
[time=571] It seems like they never stop and they just keep coming.
[time=574] And so when we sing it this time, I want to challenge you.
[time=577] Can you say, "Lord, bring it on." Test me.
[time=582] Let me prove to you that these words that I sing right now and the commitment that I made in my life is sincere.
[time=589] And when you test me and when you bring trials, Lord, I'm going to stand because I know who you are.
[time=595] I know what you saved me from.
[time=596] And think of those tests and those trials as an opportunity.
[time=602] A really unique opportunity to get to know our maker intimately when we're stripped away of all that we have control of.
[time=612] It's a time for us to just cling desperately to the rock, to the foundation of who we are and of what we believe in.
[time=619] So this time when we sing, let it rain.
[time=623] Let's make that our prayer.
[time=625] Lord, test me.
[time=628] Try me.
[time=628] [MUSIC - 324 seconds]
[time=958] - Saying a lot of God reminds me of a passage of scripture
[time=965] that says that God demonstrates His love for us in this, that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
[time=973] I love that because when we were sinners, that was the worst we ever were.
[time=979] And if God loved us in our worst, wouldn't He not love us in every step of the way until we reach perfection?
[time=986] Whether it be death or whether it be in this life, it doesn't really matter but the fact that God loves us every step of the way, whether you're a new believer and whether you're just starting to grow, He loves you.
[time=1001] Let's sing about the wonderful cross
[time=1007] that demonstrates that love that the Father had for each one of us.
[time=1010] [MUSIC - 254 seconds]
[time=1294] (upbeat music)
[time=1324] (upbeat music) - We come this morning now to our continued study
[time=1340] in the book of James and we want to just invite you if you would to open your Bible to James chapter two.
[time=1345] Real faith plays no favorites.
[time=1350] James chapter two versus one to 13.
[time=1353] I don't know about you, but when I consider, when I stop and think about, or when I stop and I read about, whenever I stop and am confronted with the attributes of God, attributes of God, for those of you that might not understand that, what we mean by that, divine characteristics, you see God's word is full of teachings that show us what kind of God he is, what he's like, what his character's like, what his nature is like, they're called attributes.
[time=1384] And as you read them and as I study them, and when I see them from time to time, I am absolutely amazed all over again at the kind of God that he is, the kind of God that I serve.
[time=1397] And I will oftentimes find myself experiencing varied responses based upon the many different attributes.
[time=1406] I mean, for me, I won't speak for you, but certain attributes just kind of take my mind in my heart different places.
[time=1412] For instance, his omnipresence, his omnipresence,
[time=1418] God's word says that our God is an omnipresent God.
[time=1421] You've got to be kidding me, I think to myself, he is everywhere all the time, everywhere.
[time=1428] And this isn't just like, you know, word pictures, this isn't just like, no, this is true, he really is.
[time=1435] Might tell my kids this and they just go, oh, no way.
[time=1438] And I sit there and I think, you know, my response is the same as theirs, you've got to be kidding me.
[time=1443] No, it's true, he's everywhere all the time.
[time=1448] Never misses a thing, never misses a beat.
[time=1453] His presence everywhere, in and through, up and down, all the way around, all the time.
[time=1459] I'll think about and I'll read about his justice.
[time=1463] You know the God, if you know him today, remember that your God is a God of justice and in his kingdom and in his realm,
[time=1478] it, justice, remember, is always served.
[time=1483] And when I think about his justice, I am oftentimes just immediately taken to this place of reverent, appropriate fear.
[time=1496] Utter, respect for who he is, for his holiness and his purity and the fact that him being him, he must be just.
[time=1507] Oftentimes on the heels of considering his justice, you know, we'll consider another attribute of his and that is his mercy.
[time=1517] And you know what I won't speak for you, but my recollection of my own experience, you know, my own Ephesians II experience where it says that we were dead in our trespasses and sins.
[time=1533] When I think about how dead I was, when I think about the corpse that just laid there, when I think about all that I had done, the places I had been, all the things that had taken place.
[time=1546] And I think about his mercy.
[time=1549] I think about the fact that he took all of my sin past, present and future.
[time=1555] And God's word says that it now is as far as the East is from the West.
[time=1560] When I think about his mercy, there's like this unspeakable gratitude that just wells up inside me.
[time=1568] When I think about his love, we're just saying that song this morning, the love of God.
[time=1575] And I think to myself as we sing it, and I've been thinking to myself all week, okay, now there's an attribute, but you know, if we're just gonna be honest, I just don't get, sometimes I just don't get it.
[time=1587] Am I incredibly thankful for it?
[time=1589] Yes, is that an overwhelming concept?
[time=1591] Yes, and sometimes I just don't get it.
[time=1594] For God so loved you, for God so loved me that he gave his only son that you and I might have life, see the lengths to which his love goes.
[time=1605] Sometimes it just seems hard to understand.
[time=1608] Sometimes it's confusing.
[time=1612] Here's another.
[time=1614] If you're making a list of attributes, here's another.
[time=1617] One that we will look closely at this morning.
[time=1619] You see, the Scriptures teaches that God is along with all those other attributes.
[time=1624] God's word teaches us clearly that our God is impartial.
[time=1629] Write it down.
[time=1630] If you haven't been writing yet, start here.
[time=1632] Great place to jump in.
[time=1633] He is impartial.
[time=1635] Scriptures teaches our God as an impartial God.
[time=1639] What does that mean?
[time=1640] What it means is this.
[time=1641] He offers and extends himself.
[time=1649] He offers and extends his loving kindness to everybody.
[time=1653] Doesn't matter where they've been.
[time=1655] Doesn't matter what they've done.
[time=1656] Doesn't matter what they look like.
[time=1659] He's an impartial God.
[time=1663] Whose Scriptures say isn't concerned with an outward appearance but instead concerns himself and considers the what?
[time=1673] The heart of an individual.
[time=1676] And when I read this and I see his impartiality
[time=1682] to be honest with you, I'm embarrassed.
[time=1685] That's my response to the fact that he is so impartial, embarrassed.
[time=1696] You say, why are you embarrassed, Kelly?
[time=1698] Well, because too often I live in a world of categories.
[time=1702] My categories, I won't speak for you.
[time=1705] I'll just speak for me.
[time=1707] You see, too often I live in a world of categories and distinctions.
[time=1711] See, I put people in boxes.
[time=1715] I put people under banners.
[time=1718] I do it all the time.
[time=1719] To my shame, I will at times treat and view people according to the category that I have placed them in.
[time=1729] You see, too often in my life and I just want to get this off my chest here.
[time=1734] We'll just do this together.
[time=1736] Too often in my life I see rich and poor.
[time=1738] Too often in my life I see talented and not very.
[time=1744] You see, too often in my life I put people in categories.
[time=1749] One might be enjoyable, another might be difficult.
[time=1753] Too many times I see smart and bright,
[time=1759] dull and a little slow, here's an ugly one.
[time=1763] Sometimes I see people and I put them in a category because they may be necessary to the accomplishing of my agenda, which at times leaves other people.
[time=1776] What's the unnecessary, not needed.
[time=1784] I mean, these are the things that run through my heart and my mind at times.
[time=1790] Sometimes I view people as accomplished and I'll view others as unsuccessful.
[time=1797] Sometimes I'll see people as supportive, offering support and kind words of encouragement.
[time=1802] Other times then I'll view people as unsupportive.
[time=1805] Sometimes I'll see people as fun and then other times I'll view others as boring.
[time=1811] And I'm sorry.
[time=1814] I really am.
[time=1819] I'm gonna keep working at it and I'm gonna keep opening my heart to the truth that we're gonna see today 'cause I need some help getting rid of the categories and the distinctions in my life.
[time=1834] You see people, the scriptures, this word of God, cover to cover shows us that we serve a God who plays absolutely no favorites.
[time=1844] Who doesn't see people according to categories or distinctions.
[time=1849] Second Chronicles, 19-7.
[time=1851] We can start back in the Old Testament.
[time=1853] Second Chronicles, 19-7 says now then let the fear of the Lord be upon you.
[time=1857] Be very careful what you do for the Lord our God will have no part in unrighteousness or partiality.
[time=1864] None, he won't have any part in it.
[time=1866] It's not in his character, it's not who he is, it's not how he functions.
[time=1869] He will have no part in partiality or the taking of a bribe.
[time=1873] We can go on to Deuteronomy or back to Deuteronomy 10 where it says for the Lord your God is the God of gods and the Lord of lords, the great, the mighty and the awesome God who does not show partiality.
[time=1885] Doesn't do it or take a bribe.
[time=1888] You can go to the New Testament and find passage after passage.
[time=1891] I'll draw your attention this morning to Acts 10.
[time=1895] Acts 10, verse 34 and 35.
[time=1897] Why don't you turn there?
[time=1899] Acts 10, verses 34 and 35.
[time=1907] It says there in Acts 10, 34, an opening his mouth, Peter said.
[time=1912] I most certainly understand now.
[time=1915] I most certainly understand now that God is not one to show partiality.
[time=1921] But in every nation, the man who fears him and who does what is right is welcome to him.
[time=1928] Peter had his eyes opened.
[time=1931] Used to be a Jew thing.
[time=1932] Now all of a sudden it was Jews and Gentiles.
[time=1934] Now all of a sudden, I mean today the way you would view it being Jews and Gentiles, the idea there is now all of a sudden it was everybody 'cause in those days there was the Jewish nation and then there was everybody else and they just called them Gentiles and Peter realizes, you know what?
[time=1950] It's for everybody.
[time=1951] Romans two.
[time=1953] Romans two, just go over one book to Romans two, verse nine.
[time=1958] It says in Romans two, verse nine, it says there will be tribulation and distress for every soul of man who does evil for the Jew first and also the Greek.
[time=1968] But glory and honor, verse 10.
[time=1970] But glory and honor and peace to every man who does good to the Jew first and also to the Greek, Greek four, verse 11.
[time=1977] There is no partiality with God.
[time=1981] He doesn't think that way.
[time=1982] He doesn't see that way.
[time=1983] He doesn't function that way.
[time=1985] And now we come this morning to James.
[time=1988] We come this morning back to the book of James chapter two, the first 13 verses where we'll see yet again another response of true faith.
[time=1997] Have you been with us these last few weeks?
[time=1999] If you have, you know that as we've begun to kind of unpack and unfold the truth of this great book, we see that in each section we find true faith or genuine faith's response to something.
[time=2014] First we saw true faith's response to trial.
[time=2017] The following week we saw true faith's response, real faith's response to temptation.
[time=2022] Last week we came together and saw how real saving faith will respond and open itself to God's word.
[time=2030] And this morning we come to yet another response.
[time=2033] True faith, real faith's response to those different or diverse.
[time=2038] True faith's response to those different, I might even add the phrase destitute, those destitute different or diverse.
[time=2046] We'll see in our passage today four things, four things about true faith's response to situations in people like this.
[time=2055] Number one, true faith will play no favorites.
[time=2057] Secondly, we'll see that true faith sees and understands the heart of God in the matter.
[time=2062] Thirdly, true faith views favoritism as sin.
[time=2065] And lastly, we'll see that true faith, real faith knows that what goes around in the end comes around.
[time=2072] Let's jump in number one.
[time=2074] Beginning of the passage, true faith plays no favorites.
[time=2078] James chapter two versus one to four, here we go.
[time=2081] My brethren, he says, do not hold your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with an attitude of personal favoritism.
[time=2092] For if a man comes into your assembly with a gold ring and dressed in fine clothes and there also comes in a poor man in dirty clothes and you in the assembly there, you pay special attention to the one who is wearing the fine clothes and say, you sit here in a good place and you say to the poor man, you stand over there or sit down by my footstool, have you not made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil motives?
[time=2119] Wow.
[time=2120] He says a lot right there.
[time=2124] Let's just jump back and try and explain it a little bit for you.
[time=2127] Understand this, people, as you read those first four verses, one of the things that comes right to the surface is that you cannot, you just can't.
[time=2135] I cannot, we cannot claim a surrendered faith in Christ
[time=2141] and at the same time practice in our lives this thing called partiality.
[time=2148] It just doesn't work.
[time=2150] It's just an absolute contradiction to everything he's about.
[time=2154] You see, to play favorites and say you love God is an absolute contradiction to the very nature and character of God himself.
[time=2162] It doesn't work.
[time=2163] Verse one, look at verse one again, read it real quick, whatever translation you have, just to yourself, just go back right now, I'm gonna give you a five second, read verse one.
[time=2174] My brethren, do not hold, read that, go ahead.
[time=2176] Okay, question for you.
[time=2181] There's two answers, so don't answer too quickly.
[time=2186] Would you consider verse one to be a suggestion?
[time=2190] Raise your hand.
[time=2192] Or would you consider verse one to be an imperative, a command, raise your hand if you see that as a command.
[time=2198] Okay, there you go.
[time=2199] Simple, I know, but worth taking note of people.
[time=2202] Verse one comes to us in the form of a command and we can think of all kind of be the flowery ways to say at the bottom line here is that with this issue of partiality and in light of here in this context, your relationship with Christ, he is saying, don't do it.
[time=2218] Don't.
[time=2221] Stop it.
[time=2222] Don't do it.
[time=2225] When the wealthy, smart, attractive, well dressed, fun loving guy or gal shows up, don't give him all the attention.
[time=2233] Don't give him or her all the love.
[time=2235] You pay special attention to the one who's wearing the fine clothes, verse three, and you say, sit here in a good place, and you say to the poor man, stand there or sit down by my footstool when you do that, you've made distinctions.
[time=2247] Pay close attention here.
[time=2251] The passage, the context, again, remember, we're always taking this in light of its context.
[time=2258] The passage is shedding light on the reception that the destitute different or diverse would receive here.
[time=2265] This place, this room, the assembly,
[time=2271] right here, that parking lot, the walk to those doors and the journey into these seats.
[time=2278] Now, your willingness in mind to be impartial and kind and loving and play no favorites in the everyday of life, very important truth.
[time=2288] We can talk about that later.
[time=2290] Today, what this is talking about is what goes on in this family, in this place, as they come through that door.
[time=2296] Specific point of application, and he says,
[time=2302] don't pay special, and I'll watch this.
[time=2306] He says you pay special attention, this is trying to just get real clear on that, okay?
[time=2311] The idea there is this.
[time=2314] You and I are to be in the business of you and I because of our love for him and his love that flows through us, we're in the business of giving special attention.
[time=2322] He's not saying don't show special attention, he's just saying show special attention to everybody.
[time=2329] Sometimes the danger of talking about this whole and parcel thing is that we realize maybe we're prone to kind of give attention and thought and love and kindness over here to this certain kind of person and then we think, oh gosh, that's not right.
[time=2340] And so we take that love and that attention and we take it away from that person, right?
[time=2344] And we come over here and we start giving it to this person, well guess what, you just did.
[time=2348] You just switched the target of your partial treatment.
[time=2352] He's not saying leave one and go do the other.
[time=2355] He's just saying stand right here in the middle and be the people I've called you to be who pay attention, who give love and kindness, who extend hands to everybody because again he's a God that has no categories, he's a God that makes no distinctions.
[time=2370] He doesn't see the wealthy guy and the poor guy.
[time=2374] The precious children to him and he asks you and I to treat them accordingly.
[time=2380] Ask yourself this, and I mean this, ask yourself this,
[time=2387] what's it like for a really, really needy person to walk in this place?
[time=2395] What's it like?
[time=2399] I mean the answer to that is, you know, what's based upon you and me and our reception of them, our love for them, our commitment to be a people filled with the Holy Spirit, ready to love and extend gratitude and gracious care.
[time=2416] I mean, you know what's it like?
[time=2417] What's it like for a wealthy person who's been really blessed when they walk in through this place?
[time=2423] What's it like for a person of color?
[time=2425] When they drive into this parking lot and get out of their cars and walk into these doors and come here and sit amongst this family, red, yellow, black, brown, what's it like?
[time=2438] What's it like for somebody who comes to Blackhawk, who walks through those doors and is emotionally, mentally, not doing so well, maybe they never have, and maybe their mental deficiency, their emotional struggle, maybe it's really obvious, maybe it's sorta obvious.
[time=2460] What's it like for them as they make their way through that four-year and try to find a seat in this place?
[time=2468] There's another one for you.
[time=2470] What's it like for somebody who comes into this place with a really messy past?
[time=2475] It's a pretty incredible thing, you know?
[time=2481] You know a lot of people, you do.
[time=2485] I know a lot of people.
[time=2488] We know a lot of stuff, don't we?
[time=2490] Sometimes too much.
[time=2493] And sometimes that stuff, those people, they show up.
[time=2501] What do you do?
[time=2503] What do you think?
[time=2505] What do you say?
[time=2508] How far out do you extend the hand?
[time=2509] How do they feel?
[time=2512] These people in need, when they come into this place, verse four says to play favorites is to make categories and distinctions, write this down.
[time=2522] Let's just say it differently.
[time=2523] To play favorites is to discriminate.
[time=2527] It's a powerful word.
[time=2531] It's a very ungodly word.
[time=2533] And to be partial, to play favorites people is to engage in the act of discrimination.
[time=2541] A kind of discrimination that God knows nothing of.
[time=2546] I love how Paul talks about it.
[time=2550] If you just turn to Romans 15, back towards the end of that great book of Romans, that letter that Paul penned to the church there at Rome, he says in chapter 15, verses five, six and seven, says some very powerful words as he begins to conclude.
[time=2565] His thoughts, he says there in verse five, now may the God, Romans 15, verse five, you see it there?
[time=2572] Now may the God who gives perseverance and encouragement grant you, those of you in the body, to be of the same mind with one another, to be of the same mind with each other, according to Christ Jesus, that with one accord, you may with one voice, not many, not different, just one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2598] Wherefore, accept one another.
[time=2602] Watch this, just as Christ also accepted you, just as Christ also accepted us to the glory of God.
[time=2610] It's important to take note there.
[time=2613] He says it right there in that last verse, it's kind of subtle, but I think the point is made.
[time=2618] He says, now, wait a minute, don't forget
[time=2624] that you and I are to evidence, you and I are to extend, you and I are to give ourselves to those in need, whatever that might look like, and we are to do that with a loving and kind spirit so that we can be of one accord and we're to do that because don't forget, but you once were over here, different and ugly and outcast in your sin and he didn't play favorites, he didn't push you aside and say, you know what, you're not in.
[time=2654] He didn't push you aside and say, you know what, we don't take your kind.
[time=2658] Now in all your ugly, pathetic sin, he loved you
[time=2664] and he extended you grace and mercy.
[time=2668] And Paul says to the Romans, you know what, people, you better do the same thing, you better offer a hand, you better extend a heart in the same way that Christ extended his to you.
[time=2681] True faith sees the heart of God.
[time=2687] True faith plays no favorites, true faith sees or you might wanna write down remembers, remembers the heart of God and we'll be brief here on this point, but I just wanna show you.
[time=2699] I wanna just kind of give you an idea of the heart of God, his view, his perspective, the way he thinks and sees and feels about those in need.
[time=2710] I'm gonna just rattle through some verses, you gotta pin write some of these down.
[time=2715] Remember people as your faith finds itself in positions where it has to respond to those in need.
[time=2724] Remember the heart of God, Psalm 41 says blessed is he that considers the poor, the Lord will deliver him in time of trouble, the Lord will preserve him and keep him alive, the one that considers the poor.
[time=2736] Psalm 68, 10 says you, oh God, have prepared out of your goodness for the poor.
[time=2740] Psalm 72, four says he will judge the poor of the people, he will save the children of the needy and will break in pieces the oppressor.
[time=2750] Do you hear that, God is the defender of the poor, he meets their needs and goes after their enemies.
[time=2755] Psalm 72, 12 says he will deliver the needy when he cries, the poor also, and he that has no helper, he will spare the poor and needy and will save the souls of the needy.
[time=2765] Psalm 113, seven says he raises up the poor out of the dust and in the end lifts up the needy out of the Dunhill.
[time=2773] God exalts the poor.
[time=2775] Proverbs 17, five, whosoever mocks the poor, mocks his maker.
[time=2780] You wanna mock the poor?
[time=2782] You wanna make fun of the poor?
[time=2783] You wanna think lightly of the needy?
[time=2785] Understand that when you do that, you make light of the one who made them.
[time=2790] The one who made you.
[time=2792] Proverbs 21, 13 says whoever closes his ears, oh listen here, don't close your ears to this.
[time=2799] Whoever closes his ears to the cry of the poor.
[time=2802] You ever done that?
[time=2811] Whoever closes his ears to the cry of the poor, he also will cry himself, but his cry will not be heard.
[time=2821] Proverbs 28, 27, he that gives to the poor shall not lack.
[time=2827] Please don't miss this, people.
[time=2831] He that gives to the poor shall not lack, but he that hides his eyes will have many a curse.
[time=2839] God will provide.
[time=2841] For those who respond.
[time=2843] God will provide for those who give.
[time=2845] And it says back in Isaiah, you can turn there, why don't you?
[time=2849] Back to Isaiah in your Old Testament, kind of toward the middle of the whole deal.
[time=2853] Isaiah chapter three.
[time=2856] Isaiah chapter three, look at verse 13, says the Lord arises to contend.
[time=2864] The Lord arises to contend and stands to judge the people.
[time=2868] The Lord enters into judgment with the elders and princes of his people, those who were leading, those who were responsible for the care and well-being.
[time=2877] And he says, it is you who have devoured the vineyard.
[time=2880] The plunder of the poor is in your houses.
[time=2883] What do you mean by crushing my people and grinding the face of the poor declares the Lord God of hosts?
[time=2891] When your faith in mine have opportunity to respond
[time=2897] to those different, to those destitute, to those in need, don't forget the heart of God.
[time=2905] Don't forget the things that he says, the expressions of his heart.
[time=2909] It's a powerful, powerful picture.
[time=2910] Number three, true faith views favoritism as sin.
[time=2916] Simple, I know, but just keep working through the passage.
[time=2920] True faith plays no favorites.
[time=2922] True faith remembers and sees the heart of God.
[time=2924] And true faith views favoritism as sin.
[time=2928] Go back to James two, pick it up in verse eight.
[time=2931] We're just gonna read eight and nine.
[time=2933] James two, eight, if however, you are fulfilling.
[time=2936] If however, you are fulfilling the royal law according to the scripture, you shall love your neighbor as yourself, you are doing well.
[time=2946] And that's the most important thing going.
[time=2948] And it just says neighbor, doesn't say white neighbor, doesn't say poor rich neighbor, doesn't say smart neighbor, doesn't say easy to get along with neighbor.
[time=2956] It just says neighbor.
[time=2957] It just says others.
[time=2960] Love 'em, he says, 'cause I loved you.
[time=2963] And if you're loving your neighbor as yourself, you're doing well.
[time=2966] But if you're not, if you show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.
[time=2974] If you show partiality, you're in sin.
[time=2979] And here's where it gets kind of interesting.
[time=2984] Here's where it gets a little sticky sometimes.
[time=2985] Here's where it gets kind of, it's sad.
[time=2990] And I admit a little confusing, but you know in the end it's just kind of sad because you say, you say, you've thought it, you've said it, some that you know have thought it and said it, you hear it, I hear it all the time.
[time=3002] There's a train of thought out there.
[time=3005] There's a school of thinking that says really boldly.
[time=3010] And sometimes like unashamedly, they say, well you know poor people shouldn't be poor.
[time=3016] The needy and afflicted, you know, really shouldn't be needy and afflicted.
[time=3022] This whole homeless thing, you know?
[time=3024] If they just get their act together, they say, if they just get a job, I mean there's jobs to be had, you know, if they just go get one, and if they'd be responsible and work hard, and what's being said between the lines there is, like me, is this really gets to be a pride thing in the end.
[time=3045] You know if they just do that, they wouldn't be in need.
[time=3051] I've heard people say it.
[time=3054] I've been walking down the street in big cities and the panhandlers, you know, make their way and the thought goes through my mind or the thought has gone through your mind or you've said it in private conversations.
[time=3065] I'm not gonna give them a dime of my hard earned money.
[time=3070] Not a dime.
[time=3072] You know what?
[time=3073] If they're homeless, destitute, poor, they're obviously lazy and irresponsible and they need to learn a lesson.
[time=3079] And me giving them money, me helping meet their need.
[time=3082] Is it gonna help them learn the lessons they need to learn?
[time=3085] Dog on it.
[time=3086] So I'm not gonna give them a dime of my hard earned money.
[time=3092] To which I lovingly carefully try and remind,
[time=3099] you know, whoever said that, whether that was me or you, I say, "Hey, hold on, time out, let's go back and hit three things there." Who's money?
[time=3112] Number one, you can write these down.
[time=3113] Who's money?
[time=3114] Are you writing?
[time=3117] Who's money?
[time=3120] That's a question, go ahead and answer.
[time=3124] Say it louder.
[time=3126] Yeah, I'm glad you got a job.
[time=3129] I'm glad you got a good job.
[time=3131] I'm thankful for how hard you work 'cause God says you and I should, all right?
[time=3134] But please, let's not get confused here.
[time=3136] It's not your money.
[time=3138] It's his.
[time=3140] And the job you have and the body you have and the ability you have to get out of bed and take a step much less, think through problems and move people in right directions.
[time=3149] It's all because of who.
[time=3150] You?
[time=3154] No.
[time=3155] Who's hard earned money?
[time=3157] I say, first of all, thank you.
[time=3159] Second of all, I say this, let's go back to this whole, and I'm with you, I understand it.
[time=3164] I know I've been honest with you, I struggle at times, but let's go back to this whole issue of connecting the homeless and needy with lazy and irresponsible, I say.
[time=3176] Are they all?
[time=3178] And I say, is that what you're telling me?
[time=3181] That they're all lazy and they're all irresponsible?
[time=3184] So I'm not gonna give 'em a dime.
[time=3186] Are they?
[time=3188] Or are some mentally and emotionally absolutely trashed with no ability whatsoever to do a thing about it?
[time=3198] Are there some who had absolutely no circumstantial control over what happened eight years ago?
[time=3205] And today find, I mean, is there any room for that, I say?
[time=3208] And then I just try to lovingly remind you and me
[time=3215] that you know what?
[time=3216] There might be some who are lazy and irresponsible.
[time=3221] And when you really kinda look at it and you really think it through, I just wanna say, so what?
[time=3228] To myself.
[time=3230] This says that I serve a God who, if I'm willing to extend myself in graciousness and kindness, he's got my back.
[time=3239] And it's not for me to walk around the homeless and poor and destitute population of my world, taking a consensus and trying to figure out who's lazy and who's not.
[time=3251] God says, be gracious.
[time=3256] It's not your money.
[time=3258] Some of 'em aren't lazy and irresponsible and some of 'em are.
[time=3261] But you know what?
[time=3263] As you walk with me and as you abide in my word and as you relentlessly pursue me, I will prompt you and I will guide you to be gracious and kind to give when it's right and if you got taken advantage of, it's all right.
[time=3280] I got your back, he says.
[time=3283] I got you covered.
[time=3285] Thanks, he says for being me to them.
[time=3290] True faith.
[time=3293] True faith, lastly, and we'll close.
[time=3299] True faith knows what goes around, comes around.
[time=3302] Plays no favorites, it sees and remembers the heart of God.
[time=3305] It views favoritism as sin, no matter how hard it might be for you to wrestle with what's really going on there and the giving of that gift and what they're gonna do with it and what, how they're gonna...
[time=3314] Views favoritism as sin and fourthly, true faith knows what goes around, comes around.
[time=3319] Look at the last two verses.
[time=3321] So speak and so act.
[time=3323] So speak and so act is those who are to be judged by the law of liberty.
[time=3328] For judgment will be merciless to one who has shown no mercy.
[time=3332] Mercy triumphs over judgment, please, one more time.
[time=3337] For judgment will be merciless to one who has shown no mercy.
[time=3341] Mercy triumphs over judgment.
[time=3345] Please don't miss this.
[time=3347] What this passage is saying, what this verse is communicating here at the end is that the one who shows no mercy.
[time=3354] The one living a life of favoritism, scoffing at the poor and teaching lazy homeless people lessons.
[time=3361] The one who shows no mercy obviously has never experienced God's.
[time=3366] I mean that, or excuse me, it means that.
[time=3373] You see, the truly safe, the genuinely redeemed who have the spirit of God at work in their lives, they begin to grow in their understanding of how it is that God sees these people.
[time=3387] And they are a merciful, gracious people, the redeemed.
[time=3391] And they extend acts of kindness and love to those that they have the opportunity to do that with.
[time=3399] And they trust God with all the details.
[time=3403] And I hope that this week, I hope today, you know, I hope tomorrow you and I that we could be a place that would be growing and that would be honest about some of the things we need some help with in this arena and that we would be a people.
[time=3418] That would be, you know, more so tomorrow than we are today,
[time=3424] ready to extend our real faith in real ways to real people with real needs.
[time=3432] [AMEN] Let's stand, close in a word of prayer.
[time=3446] Father, I know as I think these things through again here this morning, my mind just keeps racing back to the fact that not only am I so grateful, but you didn't play favorites.
[time=3456] When you came and rescued me out of my sin, I am reminded as we speak here today that I'm still grateful, that you still don't do that.
[time=3467] You never have, you don't and you never will.
[time=3472] And God, that picture is confusing as that is for our human finite minds.
[time=3476] God, I pray that your spirit and your word and your people would all come together and work to do something in our hearts and lives that would make us distinctively different in the way we extend and share our faith with those in need, with those who are different.
[time=3492] God, please chip away at and remove our pride.
[time=3498] God, please chip away and remove that attitude of superiority, God, please, as you chip away, fill us with a new kind of love and a new willingness to extend ourselves to people we should simply view as precious, dear people who you love and gave your son for.
[time=3516] God, bring us back tonight for a special time of remembering the death and sacrifice of your son, a special night of worship.
[time=3526] God, thanks for the privilege that is ours to do it.
[time=3529] And we pray that we'd come back with hearts ready to meet with you.
[time=3534] Thank you for this time.
[time=3535] God, take these words of yours and continue to change us and grow us into the people you want us to be.
[time=3541] (gentle music)
