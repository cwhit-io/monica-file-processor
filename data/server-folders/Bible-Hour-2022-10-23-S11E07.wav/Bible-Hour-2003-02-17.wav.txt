[time=30] (upbeat music)
[time=60] - Hi, I'm Mitch, teaching pastor at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=65] And you might want to grab a pen or a pencil
[time=74] 'cause there's something I'm gonna ask you to write down, not only here, but also in the sermon.
[time=80] You know, I cannot make anything work.
[time=83] I have the least mechanical intelligence of anyone I know.
[time=88] And you're gonna hear an example of how I took a brand new snowblower and in about four uses, it was no longer useful because I had really gunked it up.
[time=98] And I realized that faith is a lot like that.
[time=103] We can't do it on our own.
[time=105] And in some ways, that's the mystery of it.
[time=108] And in the line of progression of faith, it's kind of like my snowblower.
[time=111] I can turn the switch on so I can mentally agree that God exists.
[time=117] But then you can go a little deeper and that's the starter on my snowblower after I made it so it wouldn't work, it would just turn over.
[time=124] And that's emotional conviction.
[time=127] And then there's the engine.
[time=128] You know, if that engine doesn't kick in and run, my snowblowers have no use to me.
[time=132] And if your faith doesn't kick in and turn into action, it's of no use to you.
[time=137] So I just want you to think about it.
[time=140] As you go into this message, where on the line of progression is your faith?
[time=143] 'Cause you know what?
[time=144] There's a mystery to this faith.
[time=147] And it's this light of Christ that's in us.
[time=151] It's the spark plug.
[time=152] And we have a tendency to pour so much of things that are opposed to Christ into our lives that we foul our spark plugs.
[time=160] And that's the story you're gonna hear and that's the message you're gonna hear.
[time=163] And I'd like you to think about what is it that you're pouring too much of in your life that's messing up your relationship with Christ, messing up your faith, messing up how it gets lived out with others.
[time=175] What's making your snowballing life not run?
[time=180] You may be mentally kicking in, your emotions may be there, but it's not running.
[time=186] In a stormy life, your faith isn't working.
[time=190] And real faith, complete faith works.
[time=194] And it's not because of ourselves.
[time=197] So thank you for watching.
[time=198] And I'd like you to write down a website I'm gonna be talking about in the sermon.
[time=202] And that's neighborlinkfortwayne.org, neighborlinkfortwayne.org.
[time=208] And I'd like you to visit that website and consider clicking on the top right icon as you go there.
[time=214] And it's a place where we match people who have needs with people who can meet those needs.
[time=221] And I just think this is huge.
[time=223] And we just like you to go to that website and post a need, post a need of someone who can't get it done on their own.
[time=230] And we'll do our best to apply or attach someone who can meet that need.
[time=236] And we can actually live out this faith that we say that we have, that we mentally agree with, that we emotionally are convicted about.
[time=245] But again, in this stormy life, does your faith really work?
[time=250] - So your job this morning is to be our volunteer choir.
[time=255] Regardless of whether you can sing or not, I don't think that's a factor.
[time=260] But sing out.
[time=261] Let's talk about how good and pleasant it is when we dwell together in unity.
[time=265] That's what Psalm 133 says.
[time=267] Let's sing together.
[time=270] [MUSIC - 152 seconds]
[time=428] - Amen.
[time=429] - Now you guys might not realize how much we need each other.
[time=432] But as we were singing that song, I just thought about what would have happened today if we all would have just stayed home.
[time=437] You know, I have the luxury of coming to work with people who are Christians and who are my brothers and sisters in Christ.
[time=444] And I get to spend day in and day out with people who love the Lord and help me to stay accountable to Him.
[time=450] But man, I know there's a lot of you who don't have that privilege or that luxury.
[time=454] And maybe there's some of you who don't even have the privilege of living with people in your own home who know the Lord.
[time=459] And it's so good and so pleasant when we get to come together and be together.
[time=464] Romans 12 says that each one of us belongs to each other.
[time=468] And that's a huge responsibility for us to keep each other accountable and to keep us headed in the right direction and to continue to praise the Lord.
[time=476] Go ahead, Mark, start us on the next song.
[time=479] Let's sing another one together.
[time=481] (upbeat music)
[time=491] [MUSIC - 163 seconds]
[time=656] Put your hands together.
[time=657] [MUSIC - 53 seconds]
[time=714] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 12 seconds]
[time=734] (gentle music)
[time=749] [MUSIC - 12 seconds]
[time=764] (gentle music)
[time=779] (gentle music) - Good morning.
[time=794] - Good morning.
[time=794] - Glad you decided to brave the elements and come.
[time=798] And if you're visiting today, or if you're investigating Christianity, I just want you to know that we welcome you to do that here.
[time=809] And if you have your kids in here and they make some noise, that's okay too.
[time=812] I grew up in a church of 85 that now is about 450.
[time=817] And so I feel right at home in that kind of a setting.
[time=820] And also I just want you to know that God is here.
[time=825] God is here, he manifests himself to us with his spirit and he is here.
[time=829] Well, a couple of rows back here know that I'm not very mechanically inclined.
[time=837] In fact, I can make nothing work.
[time=841] So I'm really glad God cooperated with me today because a few weeks ago, there was a snow storm.
[time=850] And I got all bundled up, got these snow pants in my coat and the gloves.
[time=854] And I go out to my new Toro snow blower.
[time=857] All right, and it's only been used like two, three times.
[time=861] And on my way out, Susan's on the other end of the house and I'm in the garage, I'm getting ready to shut that door.
[time=867] And I said, hey, Susan, did you put oil in the gas?
[time=871] It's one of those two cycle motors, you know, that sounds like, I've been around cars my whole life, I know nothing about this stuff.
[time=877] But it sounds like I know it's a two cycle motor, you know where you mix oil in the gas.
[time=880] So anyway, you ever ask your spouse a question and she answers it, it's a yes, no question.
[time=886] And she answers it with yes or no, but then qualifies that answer with something that seems to be the opposite of what she said.
[time=893] Well, that's what happened.
[time=894] And I said, did you put oil in the gas?
[time=896] And I thought she said, you know, yes, it needs oil.
[time=900] I got it met from out there in the garage, it was a little bit like the teacher on Charlie Brown.
[time=904] (humming) So I'm dangerously left to my own interpretations.
[time=910] So I think it needs oil, okay?
[time=913] So I go out there and I top it off with gas at the same time, it was just a nice bottle of new oil in there.
[time=920] And I'm thinking back to what the snow blower man told me when he delivered it.
[time=923] I could have swore he said a bottle that every tank of gas, okay?
[time=927] But this bottle's a little bigger than the bottles that I had before.
[time=930] So, you know, I dumped that in there, you know.
[time=932] (humming) You know, and dump it on it.
[time=936] Give it a last drop, tighten it up.
[time=937] You know, get it all going.
[time=939] Turn the switch on.
[time=940] I got an electric starter, so I do that 'cause I don't want to do that wimpy thing.
[time=945] So anyway, and I press that button, you know, and then press the start all of a sudden, you know, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, you know, I undo it.
[time=953] And have I mentioned my friends?
[time=956] No, I'm not very mechanically inclined.
[time=958] So anyway, you know, I get it out there and never seen that black smoke before.
[time=964] (audience laughing) And I mean, it just works.
[time=966] Man, it goes, it goes for about eight feet and it stops.
[time=970] And I thought, no problem, it needs more oil.
[time=974] (audience laughing) So I go on, I try to find more oil and I'm looking for another bottle and we're out.
[time=979] And you know, by the way, which camera's on?
[time=984] The guys at Harmony Equipment in Auburn, Indiana are so wonderful, you too should buy a snow blower from them, call 1-800-555-1212.
[time=993] There, now I don't have to pay for the repairs.
[time=996] But anyway, anyway, my snow blower wouldn't go.
[time=1001] My snow blower just wouldn't go, I tried and I tried and I tried and it just would not run.
[time=1008] And you know what, that snow blower's a lot like saving faith.
[time=1011] A lot like the verses we continue to see here on the screen before we start this series each day on James.
[time=1018] Many of us just turned the switch on and that would be our mind, that on/off switch, that I turned on to start the snow blower and we believe that God exists.
[time=1026] Some of us move forward a little bit more and we get our starter going.
[time=1029] You know that wrong, that's our emotions, turning over to generate conviction.
[time=1034] But for some of us, that's where it ends.
[time=1038] God's idea of real complete faith is that our engine, our will actually kicks in so that our belief, our faith has real action, real deeds, so our faith works.
[time=1051] And I just wanna ask you, in this stormy life, where on the line of progression is your faith?
[time=1056] In this stormy life, 'cause that's when we need snow blowers right after the storms come, in this stormy life, where on the line of progression is your faith?
[time=1067] Does your faith work really?
[time=1069] Is your faith complete?
[time=1073] If you wanna open your Bibles to James 2, 14 through 26, I just wanna tell you a couple of backdrops here.
[time=1080] First of, I don't think we've mentioned that James, the book of James, parallels the sermon on the Mount.
[time=1087] Tremendous amount of parallels that Jesus is sermon, probably the greatest speech, I think, undoubtedly, the greatest speech ever given recorded in Matthew 5, 6, and 7.
[time=1095] Tremendous parallels of James, the half-brother of Jesus, to the sermon on the Mount.
[time=1100] Jesus' speech there to about 20,000.
[time=1103] Second is, when James or any of the New Testament writers would write a letter and it would go to a local church, which was a house church and they circulated, it would go around, and that house church, each house church would have like 12 people, maybe 20, and seekers would actually come and watch in the background for like two years before they got in.
[time=1126] And here's what they did with the letter.
[time=1128] They read it in its entirety during times of worship.
[time=1132] So we miss a little bit, if you don't think back to everything we've taught on up until this point.
[time=1138] So they would read it in its entirety.
[time=1140] And so I just wanna remind you that the background, remember, James starts out with a reminder of Jesus' statement in John 1633, in this life you will have trouble.
[time=1150] And James starts out talking about, in this life, you're gonna have trouble, so consider it all joy.
[time=1155] I wanna give you one more background.
[time=1158] I want you to look at verse 213, the verse immediately preceding our passage today.
[time=1163] And it talks about mercy and judgment.
[time=1166] Because judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful.
[time=1170] Mercy triumphs over judgment.
[time=1173] Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount said, blessed are the merciful.
[time=1177] Blessed, abundantly happy and fully made adequate are the merciful.
[time=1181] And he also said, in the Sermon on the Mount, don't judge, don't condemn.
[time=1185] So our first section here is James 2/14 through 17.
[time=1190] And I think James gives us a real clear picture of the mind, of that switch, of that on/off switch on my snowblower, and that's mental ascent.
[time=1197] So let's just read that together.
[time=1199] Verses 14 through 17, coming on the screen.
[time=1203] What good is it?
[time=1204] What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds, can such faith save him?
[time=1212] Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food.
[time=1216] If one of you says to him, go, I wish you well, keep warm and well fed, but does nothing about his physical needs, what good is it?
[time=1224] And then verse 17, in the same way, faith by itself,
[time=1230] if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.
[time=1235] I want to point out something, in verse 14, NIV, I want to make sure I've read so many different translations on this, NIV says such faith, such faith, that is really key to understand this entire passage, is that he's saying there in verse 14, such faith, that faith, that kind of definition of faith.
[time=1256] You know, Martin Luther said, he was the lead reformer there in 1517, and he said, faith alone, grace alone, only the Bible, only the Scriptures.
[time=1266] And he said this about this passage, man is justified by faith alone, but not by faith that is alone, not by faith that is alone.
[time=1275] And he goes on there, James does in 15 and he talks about physical needs.
[time=1279] You know, he saw Jesus and Jesus talked about this in the Sermon on the Mount, he would meet physical needs.
[time=1284] Jesus would be the salt and teach others to do the same, so they could be the light.
[time=1288] Almost every context of Jesus speaking the gospel, speaking about life with Christ, he has already met a physical need.
[time=1295] He's already met a physical need, and so people listen.
[time=1299] And then in verse 17, I just wanna be clear there about deeds.
[time=1304] Deeds, the Greek word is ergot, it's where we get the word ergonomics, it's like work, okay?
[time=1310] Deeds there are not works of the law.
[time=1313] They're deeds of mercy, verse 13.
[time=1316] They're deeds of mercy, so now it's starting to make sense.
[time=1318] Faith without mercy, you know, it's just, it's not faith.
[time=1323] Mental assent alone, no.
[time=1325] Hebrews 11-1 is one of my favorite verses because it defines faith.
[time=1329] The substance, King James is so good here compared to others because the others have a tendency to make it be sort of not tangible.
[time=1338] But this faith is founded on fact.
[time=1341] Listen to this, Hebrews 11-1, the substance, faith is the substance of things hoped for, substance.
[time=1347] And it's the evidence, the absolute evidence of things not seen.
[time=1352] Faith is confident assurance in truth.
[time=1356] It's trust, it's a commitment.
[time=1358] Believe in faith are the same word in Greek.
[time=1362] Believe is the verb and faith is the noun.
[time=1364] The Greek word is pistas.
[time=1366] In Matthew 5, 16, the sermon on the Mount, Jesus said, let your light shine, let your love shine, let your mercy shine, let your faith shine before men that they may see your good deeds, your deeds of mercy.
[time=1379] Erwin McManus is a pastor of a church in Los Angeles called Mosaic.
[time=1384] And he's written a couple books that are just out and they're wonderful, I encourage you to read 'em.
[time=1388] And one of those he shares a story.
[time=1390] And he said he was speaking at a singles engagement and there were thousands of singles there and it was on a beach and he had his 10 year old son with him and there was a break and they all were going to the beach.
[time=1399] And he said he went to the beach and he noticed this double amputee trying to get out of the water and he had crutches.
[time=1409] And he said immediately, I knew if I turned to my right, it wouldn't look like I saw him.
[time=1417] So he turns to the right and he kinda, and as he's turning he sees him go down, actually sees him go down twice, the double amputee trying to get out of the water.
[time=1425] And he turns the little head, you know how you do that of his son so he doesn't look and he just wants to, he sees the picture, he's got mental ascent.
[time=1433] But that's where it's gonna stop.
[time=1436] And as he's walking away, his 10 year old boy says, "Daddy I gotta go help that man." 'Cause he had seen him.
[time=1444] And this little 10 year old boy tries to help this, this big strong guy who's a double amputee and he's trying to help him out of the water and he just couldn't do it.
[time=1453] But by that time, all these singles had seen that little boy trying to save this guy.
[time=1458] And they all went in and they all worked together and they all got him out.
[time=1466] In this stormy life, is your faith stuck in the mode where only the key switch is turned on like my snowblower.
[time=1474] It's only mental ascent, it's just thoughts.
[time=1477] Real faith includes mental ascent, but it's not mental ascent alone, it's not just a switch.
[time=1483] In this stormy life, does your faith work really?
[time=1486] Is your faith complete?
[time=1489] Well James goes on in verses 18 and 19.
[time=1492] And this idea is the starter of my snowblower and it's the emotional conviction.
[time=1497] It's my emotions turning over and saying, "Yeah, I'm convicted." And in verse 18, we're gonna bring it up on the screen.
[time=1503] But someone will say, "You have faith and I have deeds.
[time=1507] Show me your faith without deeds and I will show you my faith by what I do." You believe that there is one God good.
[time=1514] Even the demons believe that and shudder.
[time=1518] Think about what he's saying there.
[time=1520] Even the demons believe there is one God and shudder.
[time=1525] That's what my snowblower did.
[time=1526] My snowblower would shudder, but it wouldn't run.
[time=1531] He's actually saying here that the demons believe with an emotional conviction that's deeper than mere mental ascent.
[time=1539] The demons at least shudder in emotional fear.
[time=1542] Mental ascent is not saving faith.
[time=1546] In the parable of two sons, when Jesus says in Matthew 21, He says, a father says to one son, "Go do this." And he says, "Other son, go do this." And the one says, "No, I'm not going, but then he does it." And then the other son says, "I'm going, but then he doesn't go." And he asks which one is doing what's right.
[time=1564] Listen how the NASB records this.
[time=1566] This is good on how Jesus' summary of this is.
[time=1569] He says, "For John came to you, he's talking to the Pharisees, in the way of righteousness, John the Baptist, and you did not believe faith.
[time=1578] You did not believe him, but the tax gatherers and the harlots did believe faith him.
[time=1585] And you see, seeing this, listen to this, you did not even feel remorse afterward so as to believe in him.
[time=1593] You did not feel remorse.
[time=1595] Many other translations will have repent.
[time=1598] There are three words used in the New Testament, primarily for repent.
[time=1601] One emphasizes the will, one emphasizes the emotions, one emphasizes the mind.
[time=1606] This one, feel remorse, metamelomei, emphasizes the emotions.
[time=1614] We were in California, our team who did the Tommy Walker worship concert and the outreach to the inner city at Chapel Oaks.
[time=1623] And you'll remember this, we got stuck in LA traffic.
[time=1628] You know, for Kelly, this is nothing.
[time=1629] He's used to this stuff and we're in two vehicles and we got, I got all Midwest in my van.
[time=1635] All right?
[time=1637] And the phone rings, we're like approaching an hour after we were going to eat, meet the group and eat.
[time=1643] We're getting hungry.
[time=1644] And in LA traffic, when you're going like 10 miles an hour, you get a little grumpy, right?
[time=1650] Well, my van gets this call from Lori and it's on Eric's cell phone.
[time=1655] And Eric goes, yeah, yeah, okay.
[time=1659] Hangs up the cell phone.
[time=1661] I said, what's she say?
[time=1663] She just wanted us to know that, you know, Tommy, he's okay.
[time=1667] He knows we're coming.
[time=1670] But does that put food in my Tommy?
[time=1672] No!
[time=1674] And so what he's saying is, you can have mental ascent, your switch can be on and you can even have the emotions going and say, oh, this is bad.
[time=1680] This isn't good being this traffic and we're going to be late for Tommy and, you know, we may be hungry, but Eric summed it up beautifully.
[time=1686] Does it put food in my Tommy?
[time=1688] No.
[time=1689] And for some of us, that's where our faith stops.
[time=1692] It stops at the emotions.
[time=1696] It stops at emotional conviction.
[time=1698] We don't let it get to the will.
[time=1699] And in this stormy life, I want to ask you, does your face stop at the start or turning over?
[time=1704] Is the key turned on, mental ascent?
[time=1708] Is your emotional conviction?
[time=1710] Is it going, but that's it?
[time=1712] Real saving faith includes mental ascent and emotional conviction, but is not built with those alone.
[time=1721] In this stormy life, does your faith work really?
[time=1727] In this stormy life is your faith?
[time=1732] And I got to ask myself the same question.
[time=1734] Is it complete?
[time=1735] Well, third, we go to James 20 versus 25 and James says, this is more about the will now, the volitional trust and the engine, the engine of my snowboard that would not kick in when I needed it to.
[time=1750] James 20 through 25, you foolish man, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless?
[time=1756] I'm gonna give you evidence.
[time=1757] Was not our ancestor Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?
[time=1763] So Abraham's his first example.
[time=1764] You see that his faith and his actions were working together.
[time=1768] We're gonna come back to that.
[time=1769] And his faith was made complete by what he did.
[time=1773] And the scripture was fulfilled that says Abraham believed God and it was credited to him as righteousness.
[time=1778] There's so much here.
[time=1779] And he was called God's friend.
[time=1782] And verse 24, you see that a person is justified by what he does and not by faith alone.
[time=1788] That's a toughy.
[time=1790] In the same way, it was not even Rahab.
[time=1793] Second example, the prostitute considered righteous for what she did when she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different direction.
[time=1801] Well, he says in verse 20, I'm gonna give you evidence.
[time=1804] I'm gonna give you proof of the people we've all learned about and how their faith worked, how their engines kicked in.
[time=1811] And the two examples he gives are listed in the Hall of Faith in Hebrews 11, which I quoted from earlier.
[time=1818] And first he talks about Abraham offering Isaac at the altar.
[time=1821] And in verse 22, if you wanna look in your Bibles, it says faith and actions working together.
[time=1826] The King's James version says wrought together.
[time=1830] Rought, the Greek word for working together there, is sinnerjo.
[time=1835] It's where we get synergism.
[time=1836] The whole is greater than the sum of the parts.
[time=1839] Two plus two equals five.
[time=1842] Faith works.
[time=1844] It's synergistic with my actions.
[time=1848] Two plus two equals five with faith.
[time=1851] And get this, look at this.
[time=1852] It's right there in the text.
[time=1853] Verse 22, united so that faith was made complete.
[time=1859] Complete faith by what he did.
[time=1863] Some of your translations say perfect.
[time=1865] Perfect and complete mean the same thing in scripture.
[time=1869] You and I can't be flawless.
[time=1870] God knows that.
[time=1871] Complete and perfect in scripture typically means in use for what you were made.
[time=1877] In use for what you were made.
[time=1880] Verse 23, he quotes Genesis 15, 6.
[time=1883] And that's the first time believe, trust, faith.
[time=1886] That word is used in scripture.
[time=1889] And Abraham's that picture.
[time=1890] That's why New Testament writers go back to that.
[time=1893] That's the Old Testament.
[time=1895] First time that it describes believe or faith.
[time=1899] And then verse 24, justified by what he does.
[time=1902] The fruit, we see the fruit of what he does.
[time=1906] Not by faith, not by mere mental assent alone, which he, in the beginning, such faith.
[time=1912] Mental assent only, no, faith works.
[time=1916] And this doesn't contradict Paul's writings.
[time=1918] Paul says that we're justified by faith.
[time=1922] Not by works of the law, okay?
[time=1926] And Paul uses justified as a legal forensic term.
[time=1931] A judge declares that you're righteous.
[time=1934] James seems to use it as vindicated.
[time=1937] You're vindicated among men.
[time=1938] I can see that you have faith because you do stuff.
[time=1941] I can see it, but you know what?
[time=1944] It doesn't really matter if they're using it in that context.
[time=1946] Listen to, listen, Ephesians 2, 8 through 10.
[time=1948] Listen to this, okay?
[time=1950] This is Paul's writing to the letter of the church at Ephesus, okay?
[time=1954] For it is by grace that you have been saved through what?
[time=1959] Faith.
[time=1961] And this is not from yourselves.
[time=1962] It is the gift of God.
[time=1965] Not by works so that no one can boast.
[time=1967] And now verse 10, which when many people quote this verse, they leave off verse 10, the very next verse.
[time=1973] For we are God's workmanship.
[time=1975] God's workmanship, God's poem, God's poem, Kelly taught us, created in Christ Jesus to do what?
[time=1982] Good works.
[time=1984] Saved by grace through faith to do good works,
[time=1990] which God prepared in advance for us to do.
[time=1993] And Paul also writes in Romans 4-5 that this trusting of God, this belief in God, this trusting of God for everything I can't do is not the kind of work he's talking about to earn your salvation.
[time=2005] Well, then he uses Rahab as an example and how she responded to the spies.
[time=2010] And Rahab's story is kind of interesting.
[time=2013] It's almost like an evangelistic event.
[time=2016] You know, they come in, they're gonna have the conquest of this land and Rahab's a harlot and she takes care of the spies in a time of war.
[time=2025] She sides up on God's team.
[time=2027] She said, I've heard about what's gone on there and I'm gonna be on your team.
[time=2031] And Jewish tradition says that she married Joshua, Christian tradition, we have it in the Bible that she's in the lineage of Jesus.
[time=2038] In these example, we see three things, that faith is mental assent, the switch has turned on.
[time=2046] Faith is emotional conviction, the starters turnin' over.
[time=2050] Faith is willful action, the engine, unlike my snowblower, has kicked in.
[time=2056] And I think I'm gonna have it on the screen here.
[time=2058] We're seeing the mind, the emotions, and the will continually coming up here.
[time=2064] The mind, the emotions, and the will.
[time=2066] And I just want you to know, that's your soul.
[time=2069] Louis Berkoff, in his book Systematic Theology, is quoted by theologians all the time.
[time=2074] And it addresses this issue.
[time=2076] Louis Berkoff says that faith has, uses three words, noticia, census, fiducia.
[time=2082] He says, it's knowledge of the facts, that's my mind.
[time=2085] It's conviction of those facts, that's my emotions.
[time=2090] And it's willful trust of those facts, that's my will.
[time=2095] Thoughts, feelings, actions, switch, the mental switch.
[time=2101] It's intentional, not accidental, write that down.
[time=2105] It's intentional, not accidental.
[time=2107] The starter, the emotions, it's passionate, not dutiful.
[time=2111] It's passionate, faith is passionate, real faith is passionate, not dutiful.
[time=2117] And then as far as the engine is concerned, it's active, not passive, like my snowboard was.
[time=2122] It's active, not passive.
[time=2125] Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount says, not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my father who is in heaven.
[time=2136] Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine, and does them, does them, this is why I tell my girls basketball team, everyone who hears these words of mine and does them, that's what we're trying to get here.
[time=2147] And Jesus closes the Sermon on the Mount, therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and does them is like a wise man.
[time=2154] Wisdom is faith working, by the way.
[time=2157] A wise man who built his house on the rock.
[time=2160] Henry Nowhan was the theologian at Notre Dame, and out east, great mind, written many outstanding books, and you should read them.
[time=2169] I got to hear him speak before he passed away.
[time=2171] Henry Nowhan said, you know what?
[time=2173] I cannot teach this faith any longer and not go live it.
[time=2178] And he went to a place for the mentally and physically challenged, and he served them 'til the day he died in Toronto.
[time=2188] I cannot just teach this faith and not live it.
[time=2193] By faith, by faith Abraham, by faith Rahab.
[time=2200] By faith, Kelly Bird comes from California to join this church.
[time=2205] By faith and a jury prays for us on staff daily.
[time=2209] By faith, Marty and Joy Kate and say, you know what, let's go do this business thing in Fort Wayne and leave the Carolinas.
[time=2216] By faith, Tony Opliger prays and leads this place in prayer.
[time=2220] By faith, Steve Longbreak ministers into my life.
[time=2226] By faith, Dave Walters speaks truth to me and breathes life into me.
[time=2229] By faith Mark Rhodes comes and sees me on Tuesdays and gives his life not only to this place but to youth for Christ.
[time=2236] And I can go on and on and on.
[time=2239] By faith, by faith, Steve Wild leaves a nice paying job and comes here to be athletic director and director of development, by faith.
[time=2248] In this stormy life, does your faith work?
[time=2252] Is the switch on, mental ascent?
[time=2256] Is the starter turning over emotional conviction and the engine running willful action?
[time=2261] Like Abrahams, and I gotta ask myself this, is your faith complete?
[time=2268] Is my faith complete?
[time=2270] But I wanna differentiate now in this final point, between faith in our faith and faith in Christ.
[time=2277] Many well-intending and well-meaning Christians have taught us to have faith in our faith.
[time=2284] And I wanna talk about faith in Christ.
[time=2287] And finally, we have the spark plug.
[time=2289] You know, I messed up my spark plug and that's where the fire comes from.
[time=2297] That's where that spark comes from to get that whole thing going.
[time=2300] And in my, I sound like I know all these things, I really don't, I just can articulate them.
[time=2304] But that's what I did to my snowblower.
[time=2307] And so listen, this language is just so beautiful.
[time=2310] And verse 26, how James ends this, "As the body without the spirit is dead, "so faith without deeds is dead." I think every word counts in this one.
[time=2323] Nicros is the word for dead.
[time=2327] It's different than the word Kelly and I talked about earlier in this letter.
[time=2332] And it literally means to have the spirit removed, to have the spirit removed.
[time=2339] Jesus on the cross, right before He died, said father, into your hands, I commit my what?
[time=2349] My spirit, Numa, the breath of God.
[time=2353] The breath of God.
[time=2356] John calls it the light.
[time=2360] If my soul is my vertical window, my spirit, I'm sorry, if my soul is my horizontal window.
[time=2368] See, I have no mechanical intelligence.
[time=2371] My spirit is my vertical window, my vertical window.
[time=2375] And it's really interesting that He writes this.
[time=2378] Do you know, maybe you've read this, that James bones have probably been found.
[time=2383] They found this stone box.
[time=2387] And on it it said, James, bar, Joseph, James, son of Joseph, comma.
[time=2395] And now a phrase that doesn't exist on other boxes that they find like this.
[time=2399] Brother of Jesus, archeologists found it.
[time=2404] And they know there's 20 combinations that could be of James, son of Joseph.
[time=2413] But they said to have brother of Jesus, that's not on those boxes that we find.
[time=2418] That means that this Jesus was a very important man.
[time=2421] He was God.
[time=2424] And it's almost like God showing us.
[time=2428] James 2, 26.
[time=2432] You know what?
[time=2432] James isn't in there.
[time=2434] James isn't in that box.
[time=2436] His spirits with God.
[time=2439] And you and I have this light in us, this spirit that God gives us, His breath.
[time=2443] And we can either accept Him or we can reject Him.
[time=2446] But there's gonna come a day when it's too late.
[time=2449] And you're just gonna be bones in a box because your spirits going one way or another.
[time=2453] Well, the soul plus the spirit, that horizontal window and vertical window to the light, which is life, that's your heart.
[time=2463] The soul plus the spirit, I think that's your heart, your entire inner being.
[time=2468] And that spirit gives life.
[time=2472] It gives life.
[time=2473] Genesis 1, 26.
[time=2474] God says, let us make men in our own image, us.
[time=2478] The declarative for Elohim for God is plural.
[time=2483] Let us, Christ is there.
[time=2486] John writes that Christ created us.
[time=2489] John 1, 9, one of my favorite verses, I say it again and again and again.
[time=2493] Jesus Christ lights the heart of every man.
[time=2496] He gives them a spirit and with that spirit, which He will draw, they can accept or reject it.
[time=2501] And there's a time when you'll be bones in the box.
[time=2505] And what are you gonna do with that?
[time=2506] Steve said it as Christ is the cosmic glue.
[time=2509] And he says, I know Him.
[time=2511] I know Him.
[time=2512] Personal God.
[time=2513] Paul writes that we live by the spirit in Romans 8, 4 and he goes on five verses later to say, that's the spirit of Christ.
[time=2521] In 2 Timothy 1, 6 or 7, we talk about this spark.
[time=2525] I'm using the spark plug in my snowblower for this.
[time=2527] Paul writes, fan the flame.
[time=2531] 2 Timothy 1, 6, fan that flame.
[time=2534] Fan that flame, that spirit.
[time=2537] And he goes on in verse seven and a lot of you have this memorized, 2 Timothy 1, 7.
[time=2541] That spirit of power, that spirit of love, that spark plug of power, that spark plug of love and self-discipline.
[time=2550] The spirit is what keeps us from faith in our faith but gives us the opportunity for faith in Christ who fills everything in every way, Ephesians 1, 23.
[time=2559] Christ gives eternal abundant life when we fully surrender.
[time=2563] Our spirit to His spirit when we fully surrender.
[time=2568] Hebrews 12, 2 says Jesus is, it says, fix our eyes on Jesus, right?
[time=2573] The author and perfecter of our faith.
[time=2575] Jesus Christ, fix our eyes on, is the object of our faith.
[time=2579] He's the author of our faith.
[time=2581] He's the perfecter of our faith.
[time=2583] There's an acronym for faith.
[time=2584] You might want to write it down.
[time=2585] Forsaking all, I trust Him.
[time=2595] Real complete faith is intentional.
[time=2598] It's not by accident, the switch of the mind is turned on.
[time=2601] It's passionate, not dutiful.
[time=2602] The starter, the emotions, the convictions are going.
[time=2605] It's active, not passive.
[time=2606] The engine, the willful action is going and it's lit by Christ, not myself.
[time=2614] And that's the spirit.
[time=2615] We can't even take credit for our faith.
[time=2618] He's the light of the world and He says that you and I as believers when we say yes and fully surrender Him, we're the light.
[time=2625] What's the light for?
[time=2627] To help others see, to help others see the love of Christ and that is what also that light does, is it loves.
[time=2636] Jesus says be the salt, be the light.
[time=2640] Do deeds of love so you can communicate me.
[time=2649] I grew up in a church saying in this little line of mine, I'm going to let it shine.
[time=2653] Hide it under a bushel, no.
[time=2656] I'm going to let it shine.
[time=2660] And I hid it under a bushel.
[time=2662] I have 10 progressive years hiding that under a bushel.
[time=2667] Here's the idea guys, here's the big idea.
[time=2672] Faith without deeds of love is dead.
[time=2676] Faith without deeds of love is a song without worship like Corbin told me, just notes on a page.
[time=2682] Faith without deeds of love is life without love, which isn't life at all, that's not how God intends.
[time=2688] Faith without deeds of mercy.
[time=2689] Faith without deeds of love is dead because it is not saving faith because it is not faith at all.
[time=2699] That kind of faith makes a mockery of Jesus Christ and makes a mockery of God.
[time=2706] It is Christ who works in you to provide his fruit, Paul writes and Paul writes in Galatians 5.25 that since we live by the Spirit, since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit.
[time=2720] Jesus says, you know false prophets are going to prophesy in my name, drive out demons in my name and work miracles in my name.
[time=2727] You know what, I personally have never done any of those.
[time=2729] And he'll say, I never knew you 'cause you didn't love me.
[time=2736] Faith in your faith, I love you guys.
[time=2738] Faith in your faith, fall sure.
[time=2742] Faith in Jesus Christ is what he's looking for.
[time=2745] First John 4-8 says, if you say you believe and you don't love others, get out of dodge with that because God is love.
[time=2755] God is love and through his love he creates.
[time=2759] Galatians 5-6, I think I might have this on the screen.
[time=2762] The only thing that counts, Paul says, this is Paul's writing, once again he doesn't contradict James.
[time=2767] The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love.
[time=2771] And I want to give you an example of a girl whose spirit fully surrendered to Christ, gave life through her love.
[time=2780] Susan and I had the opportunity at a Youth for Christ meeting in Pasadena last week to hear Darryl Scott speak.
[time=2788] Darryl is the father of Rachel Scott who was one of the girls killed at Columbine.
[time=2794] I talked to you before about Cassie Bernal whose best friend I interviewed right after that.
[time=2798] This is Darryl Scott, his daughter Rachel.
[time=2801] And there's so many things, I heard him speak for an hour and I mean hundreds of people just sobbing.
[time=2808] There's so much of this story I've never heard and I've studied it and read it and followed it.
[time=2814] But one month prior to April 20th, 1999 when Eric Harrison, Bill and Cleebold, came in and started killing people, they did a video a month before.
[time=2826] And Eric Harris said this, we need to get a chain reaction going on here.
[time=2831] We need to get a chain reaction going on here.
[time=2834] The chain reaction of murder.
[time=2836] Well, Rachel Scott, also a month.
[time=2840] I'm not sure if they know it's to the day, but also a month before April 20th, 1999 wrote this.
[time=2846] It's called My Ethics and My Codes of Life and it was for an assignment in school.
[time=2851] She writes, "Compassion is the greatest form of love humans have to offer.
[time=2857] According to Webster's dictionary, compassion means a feeling of sympathy for another's misfortune.
[time=2862] My definition of compassion is forgiving, loving, helping, leading and showing mercy for others.
[time=2870] I have this theory, she writes, that if one person can go out of their way to show compassion, then it will start a chain reaction.
[time=2880] Then it will start a chain reaction of the same.
[time=2884] People will never know how far a little kindness can go.
[time=2887] My codes may seem like a fantasy that can never be reached, but test them for yourself and see the kind of effect they have in the lives of people around you.
[time=2896] You just might start a chain reaction." And when Eric Harris walked up to her after shooting her twice in the legs and once in the torso, he lifted up her hair and lifted up her head and said, "Do you believe in God now?" And the reason he said now is she had shared her faith with him.
[time=2917] Weeks before, Rachel Scott was the life of Christ to people, the life of Christ, the love of Christ.
[time=2925] And she lived it out.
[time=2926] And her writings that we now have are just unbelievable in how she did that.
[time=2932] And that's why he says, "Do you believe in God now?" And she said, "Yes." And he shot her in the head and he killed her.
[time=2942] And Rachel's dad, Daryl, holds her book bag on his office wall as a reminder with the bullet holes in it.
[time=2952] A chain reaction.
[time=2957] What if you and I would do that?
[time=2960] What if you and I would let our faith, the grace of God, of Christ?
[time=2966] Grace means undeserved love, unmerited favor, Christ in you.
[time=2969] What if we let Christ permeate out of us and start a chain reaction?
[time=2974] By faith, a couple guys in this congregation have started a website called Neighborlink.
[time=2979] It's flowing out of our extension ministries here at Blackhawk.
[time=2984] And we're gonna bring it to the screen.
[time=2986] Neighborlinkfortwayne.org.
[time=2988] Is it in your bulletin?
[time=2989] I think it is.
[time=2990] Neighborlinkfortwayne.org.
[time=2991] I want you to write that, address down, or make sure it's in your bulletin.
[time=2994] Neighborlinkfortwayne.org.
[time=2996] 'Cause I'm asking every single one of you here to do just one thing.
[time=3000] Just one thing.
[time=3001] I want you to go to this website.
[time=3003] I want you to click on top right icon, posting projects.
[time=3008] What Neighborlinkfortwayne.org is, is a way for people with need to come in contact with those who can meet the need.
[time=3017] And we have coaches who put those together.
[time=3019] So it's the ideas that people will serve.
[time=3022] People want to serve.
[time=3023] Unbelievers in Christ will serve.
[time=3027] And we're designing a way for them to come together and for them to serve together with believers and to be evangelical with our faith, to live it out, to show the love of Christ.
[time=3037] And I just want you to do one thing.
[time=3038] I want you to go to that website.
[time=3040] And I want you to be the eyes, the hands, the feet, the ears of Christ.
[time=3047] And I want you to register.
[time=3048] You just follow the promptings.
[time=3049] You click on that icon.
[time=3051] And I want you to post a project.
[time=3052] Don't worry.
[time=3054] Don't worry at all if you feel like you messed something up.
[time=3057] But I want you to find someone in need, someone who can't get that need down on their own and post the project.
[time=3063] This is in its infancy stages.
[time=3064] Not all needs will get met.
[time=3066] But we need this place to take the lead in posting those needs at neighborlinkfortwayne.org.
[time=3074] And that's when I'm bagging and pleading every single one of you today to manifest the love of Christ.
[time=3079] Please just go to this website and engage.
[time=3082] This is a ministry of Black Hawk II guys here in faith have set this up so that we can meet the needs of other.
[time=3089] I think it has international applications.
[time=3091] I mean, I think it's big.
[time=3093] It's so we can serve every single day.
[time=3096] You can do it with your small group.
[time=3097] But please go to neighborlinkfortwayne.org and check this out, a way that we can put people with need and people who can meet the need together and serve.
[time=3107] Well, you mechanical types are ahead of me.
[time=3110] You know that I discovered that the gas can I use was also filled with the oil, the oil gas mixture.
[time=3116] And I probably, man, I don't know how many times over.
[time=3120] I noticed today when I was using it on the gas cap, it's back now and it's working 50 to one.
[time=3125] I think I did 50 oil to one gas instead of 50 gas to one oil.
[time=3130] And you know what that does, that oil settled into the bottom of the tank and I filed my spark plug.
[time=3138] And listen, this the antidote was emptying the old, emptying that old faulty mixture, refilling the tank with the right stuff and replacing the spark plug.
[time=3148] So I wanna ask you three questions and we're done.
[time=3151] And this stormy life does your faith work, really.
[time=3155] Is your faith complete?
[time=3157] Switch starter engine, mind, emotions, will.
[time=3162] If not, second question, is your spark plug filed?
[time=3169] Have you gunked up your spirit?
[time=3172] Have you gunked up that life of Christ?
[time=3174] Your mixture is too rich toward the world then to those opposed to Christ.
[time=3180] Maybe, maybe, maybe you're here today and you've never fully surrendered.
[time=3186] And you can do that today.
[time=3187] What are you third question?
[time=3190] What are you excessively putting in your tank that has produced a mixture too rich toward the world?
[time=3195] Causing your faith to be incomplete.
[time=3197] What's following your spark plug?
[time=3199] What's your oil?
[time=3200] What are you today dumping in your tank that's fouling your spirit, that's gunking it up?
[time=3206] What is your oil?
[time=3208] Might be money, might be work, might be a relationship you shouldn't have, might be an addiction of some kind you know you shouldn't have.
[time=3216] And Jesus says you know what, empty your tank.
[time=3219] Just exhale, just confess that to Christ.
[time=3222] And refill it, inhale his spirit, his spirit of forgiveness, of mercy, of grace, of love.
[time=3230] And replace your fouled spark plug with the spirit of Christ.
[time=3234] Repentance says I can't, with my mind, my emotions, my will, my spirit, it says to God, I can't.
[time=3240] And faith says to God, you can.
[time=3243] Real complete faith works because it's spark, it's light, it's power.
[time=3248] Truly comes from the love of the spirit of Christ.
[time=3252] We sing about amazing grace, amazing grace.
[time=3256] How sweet that sound, amazing grace.
[time=3259] And I've asked Corbin to come up and just close us.
[time=3261] Just close us with that song.
[time=3264] Grace, Christ in you, say by faith.
[time=3269] Faith without deeds of love isn't faith at all.
[time=3274] (gentle music)
[time=3289] [MUSIC - 71 seconds]
[time=3365] - What do you sing with me?
[time=3373] Through many dangers, toils and snares?
[time=3376] I have already come and stay together.
[time=3381] [MUSIC - 63 seconds]
[time=3459] - Now if we could just pray, God faith without deeds of love is dead because it's ripped Jesus Christ
[time=3470] and grace from the equation.
[time=3472] It's not the way it works.
[time=3475] May each person here know that here she is saved by grace
[time=3482] through faith so we can do the works of love
[time=3488] that you've prepared in advance, that you created us to do people in loving community with you and with each other.
[time=3495] God, if there's someone who made it in today, who hasn't fully surrendered his or her heart to you, I pray in Jesus name right now that here she experiences that grace, the breath of God.
[time=3514] Now God, give us safety, bless us, help us to live a life of love for others through faith by your grace and the mighty name of Jesus Christ and all God's people who gathered on this cold snowy morning set.
[time=3531] [AMEN]
[time=3544] (gentle music)
