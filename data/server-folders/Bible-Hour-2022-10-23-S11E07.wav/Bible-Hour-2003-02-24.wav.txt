[time=339] Father, we have come here this morning to reach for you.
[time=344] We stand here amazed at the power of your glory.
[time=348] And Lord, we ask that you'd show us more.
[time=350] We want to see your glory this morning.
[time=352] We want to see a piece of who you are.
[time=355] And we reach for you.
[time=357] [MUSIC]
[time=486] Draw me close to you.
[time=493] Never let me go.
[time=500] Lay it all down again.
[time=507] To hear you say that I'm your friend.
[time=514] You are my design.
[time=521] Though what else will do
[time=528] is nothing else to take your place.
[time=534] To feel the warmth of your embrace.
[time=541] To feel me find your way.
[time=545] Bring me back to you.
[time=551] [MUSIC][MUSIC]â™ª
[time=1421] Well, hey, good morning.
[time=1424] I feel like we need to be cleansed after watching that.
[time=1427] What a humorous but powerful portrayal by our drama team.
[time=1432] As to the power, the power and the potential of the tongue.
[time=1437] Let me ask you a question this morning as we start.
[time=1440] Do you think God cares about what you say?
[time=1446] The words that you speak, do you think it's important for us to consider and ponder our speech?
[time=1452] Listen to these words.
[time=1454] Listen closely.
[time=1455] Take note.
[time=1457] And you can answer that question here at the conclusion.
[time=1460] Do you think God cares about what we say?
[time=1462] James 1, 26.
[time=1464] If anyone thinks himself to be religious and yet does not bridle his tongue, but deceives his own heart,
[time=1470] this man's religion is worthless.
[time=1472] Matthew 12, you brood of vipers.
[time=1474] How can you being evil speak what is good?
[time=1476] For the mouth speaks out of that which fills the heart.
[time=1479] The good man out of his good treasure or good heart brings forth what is good in his speech.
[time=1483] The evil man out of his evil treasure or heart brings forth what is evil.
[time=1488] And I say to you that every careless word that men shall speak, they shall render a count for it in the day of judgment.
[time=1496] For by your words you shall be justified and by your words you shall be condemned.
[time=1501] James 5, 9, don't complain.
[time=1504] Do not complain, brethren, against one another, that you yourselves may not be judged.
[time=1510] Behold the judge is standing right at the door.
[time=1512] Psalm 101, 7.
[time=1514] Maybe you can just write these down as we go.
[time=1516] He who practices deceit with his tongue shall not dwell within my house.
[time=1521] He who speaks falsehood shall not maintain his position before me.
[time=1525] Ephesians 4, 29.
[time=1527] Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth.
[time=1531] You say, what's an unwholesome word?
[time=1533] Well, just listen.
[time=1534] Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth.
[time=1536] But only such a word as is good for edification, good for building up, good for strengthening,
[time=1543] according to the need of the moment that it may give.
[time=1546] The words you speak that they may give grace to those who hear them.
[time=1551] A few more to write down.
[time=1552] Psalm 19, 14 says, let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable.
[time=1558] In thy side, O Lord, my rock and my redeemer.
[time=1561] Proverbs 18, 7 says, a fool's mouth is his ruin.
[time=1565] And his lips are the snare of his soul.
[time=1568] Proverbs 12, 13 says, an evil man isn't snared, is trapped, is caught by the transgression
[time=1575] of his lips, but the righteous will escape from trouble.
[time=1580] Proverbs 13, 3 says, the one who guards his mouth preserves his life.
[time=1584] The one who opens wide his lips comes to ruin.
[time=1589] Proverbs 15, 1, a gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.
[time=1595] And let me just remind you of what it said there at the end of that Matthew 12 passage, for by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned.
[time=1605] And on and on and on we could go.
[time=1608] God's word people is abundantly clear.
[time=1611] Here's the answer to the question.
[time=1613] He cares.
[time=1615] He cares about what you say.
[time=1618] He cares deeply, and it matters.
[time=1621] The words that come out of your mouth, the words that come out of mind, he cares about it,
[time=1627] it matters deeply.
[time=1629] They have great capacity to bring hope, healing, or spread hate, to help, or to hurt, to delight,
[time=1635] or destroy, to build up, or tear down, just a word study.
[time=1640] Just a simple word study from the Scriptures brings light to all kinds of ways in which you and I use our tongue.
[time=1647] It refers in the Scriptures directly or indirectly to a wicked tongue, a deceitful tongue,
[time=1653] a lying tongue, a perverse filthy or corrupt tongue, a bitter tongue, an angry tongue, a crafty tongue,
[time=1659] a flattering slanderous or gossiping tongue, a backbiting tongue, a blaspheming, foolish or boasting tongue,
[time=1666] a murmuring tongue, a complaining tongue, a cursing tongue, a contentious tongue, a sensual tongue,
[time=1672] a vile, whispering tongue, and an exaggerating tongue.
[time=1676] And if the tongue fits, see yourself anywhere in there, hear yourself anywhere in there.
[time=1691] Think about it for a second.
[time=1692] Most of our problems in life involve the tongue.
[time=1696] Go ahead, think about that.
[time=1698] Most of your problems, most of my slip-ups, most of the trouble that we get in, a lot of it has to do
[time=1705] with what comes out of your mouth.
[time=1708] Nothing one commentator said is more representative of man's sinfulness than his speech.
[time=1714] "There is no easier way to sin," he went on to say, "because you can say anything you want.
[time=1719] Circumstances may, and I agree.
[time=1721] Circumstances may, at times, keep us from doing certain things.
[time=1725] Circumstantially, we may feel like, "Oh, I certainly can't do that, but we can say anything we want.
[time=1733] Whenever we want, and so many times, too often times we do, these words we speak, and the tongue that speaks them, people very, very powerful, very powerful."
[time=1745] And let's come back to our study of the book of James and the first twelve verses of chapter three this morning,
[time=1752] and today some of you will, for the very first time, have truth kind of unfold before your eyes.
[time=1759] Today some of you, for the very first time, will get some insight from the Scriptures into the fact that yes, this very practical everyday deal called your speech.
[time=1769] It really matters to God.
[time=1771] For others of you, maybe what we'll see today will be a timely reminder, the potential and the power of the tongue.
[time=1779] Five things today, five things that we'll see, and we're going to start right there at the beginning of chapter three,
[time=1785] and let you see that it has the power, it has the potential to condemn the tongue,
[time=1791] it has the potential to condemn.
[time=1794] Write that down.
[time=1795] It says there, "Let not many of you become teachers." My brethren, knowing that as such, we shall as teachers incur a stricter judgment
[time=1805] for we all stumble in many ways.
[time=1807] I want you to stop right there.
[time=1809] James will move on in this passage to address the broader audience of all believers, but he starts here in our passage this morning by pointing some specific words at some specific people.
[time=1822] He takes just a moment to say, "Hey, those of you who are considering, those of you who may feel led, those of you who might sense a calling, to be teachers, to be communicators of this truth."
[time=1834] He says, "Be careful." He in a sense says, "Whoa, stop.
[time=1839] Time out.
[time=1840] Think about this now." There's a lot at stake.
[time=1845] There's a lot at stake.
[time=1847] He doesn't want just anybody to rush recklessly into this calling.
[time=1853] He wants each of us to consider how very, very serious it is, and to practice restraint
[time=1860] from moving foolishly into this role of teacher-why.
[time=1863] Well, look at the first part of verse two, because the fact of the matter is we all stumble in many ways.
[time=1870] There's going to be some stumbling verbally, he says.
[time=1874] Understand this, be very careful, almost in a sense he's saying better to stumble verbally privately
[time=1884] than to stumble verbally in front of twenty, two hundred, two thousand people.
[time=1890] It's a very serious thing.
[time=1892] Why?
[time=1893] Because look at the end of verse one.
[time=1894] Verse one says, "Knowing that as such we shall incur a stricter judgment." Here's how that works.
[time=1900] The fact of the matter is, is that there are people who stand in places like this all over the world.
[time=1906] There are people who stand in front of other people and claim to be and step forward to be in essence
[time=1913] teachers and communicators of truth.
[time=1915] Problem is they don't speak his truth.
[time=1918] They speak their truth.
[time=1920] Problem is sometimes what goes on is they don't get it straight.
[time=1923] They're not accurate.
[time=1924] They sin verbally.
[time=1926] They stumble in that they misrepresent the truth.
[time=1929] They tell hundreds or thousands of people to go do things that they want them to do, not things that God's called them to do.
[time=1937] And you know what?
[time=1938] People listen.
[time=1939] People are moldable.
[time=1941] People are impressionable.
[time=1943] And people listen to guys who stand in places like this and don't say it straight and they go and do stuff they shouldn't do.
[time=1950] And James is saying here, you know what?
[time=1952] God will hold every individual responsible for his or her actions.
[time=1956] But hey, teachers understand that the condemnation that would fall on that whole scenario in the end comes back on you.
[time=1963] Be very careful what you teach.
[time=1967] Be very careful.
[time=1969] If in fact you're going to pursue this communicating thing.
[time=1974] You know the honest truth?
[time=1977] I get, I mean it, I get really nervous every Saturday night about 10 o'clock.
[time=1985] I get really, really nervous.
[time=1987] Not because you make me nervous and not because we haven't prepared and not be, no, it's just, it's just an amazing thing.
[time=1997] And you know it if you've stood in front of any number of people and said to them, hey, this is what God's Word says.
[time=2005] Let me try to explain it to you.
[time=2008] It's a daunting thing.
[time=2010] I get nervous.
[time=2011] My stomach starts to, you know, roll.
[time=2013] I can't go to sleep.
[time=2015] He says, be careful.
[time=2017] Be very, very careful.
[time=2019] Remember James 1-19?
[time=2020] Be quick to hear.
[time=2021] Remember?
[time=2022] Be quick to take it in.
[time=2023] Be what to speak it?
[time=2025] Slow.
[time=2026] Be slow.
[time=2028] It has the potential people, the tongue, our speech, to condemn, to come back and bite.
[time=2034] The false teacher.
[time=2035] Number two, it has the potential to control in a positive sense.
[time=2039] Number two, write it down.
[time=2040] It has the potential to control.
[time=2043] Last part of verse two on through the first part of verse five.
[time=2046] Let's read it together.
[time=2047] It says here, for we all stumble in many ways.
[time=2049] If anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body as well.
[time=2055] Now, if we put the bits into the horse's mouths so that they may obey us, we direct their entire body as well.
[time=2063] The ships as well, though they are so great and are driven by strong winds, are still directed by a very small rudder.
[time=2071] Wherever the inclination of the pilot desires, so also the tongue is a small part of the body, and yet it boasts of great things.
[time=2080] You see that?
[time=2081] What a powerful, practical truth this is.
[time=2085] What a powerful picture.
[time=2087] Write this down.
[time=2088] Here's the gist of this point.
[time=2090] Write this down.
[time=2091] You know what people?
[time=2092] A surrendered tongue can.
[time=2094] It has the potential to lead to a surrendered life.
[time=2098] A surrendered tongue has the potential to lead to a surrendered life.
[time=2104] And an unsurrendered tongue, an unsurrendered tongue can ruin, bring damage and destruction to a life.
[time=2117] Think with me about this.
[time=2119] Think about all of our physical members.
[time=2121] Think about the physical members of your body, all that's included there.
[time=2127] And as you think about that, and as I thought about that this week, you know, it's the tongue that responds maybe the quickest to sin and to temptation.
[time=2137] You know, it's quite possibly the tongue that is the most expeditious in its response to what is taken in, seen or heard.
[time=2146] It's incredible.
[time=2147] And not only this, keep thinking with me on this, not only is the tongue so quick to oftentimes respond to what it's seen or what's heard or what's brought in front.
[time=2160] But it seems as if the tongue is the leader of the other members.
[time=2166] You follow me?
[time=2167] So many times in my own experience, at least I know that I will sometimes say things and the words will get out.
[time=2175] And then it seems as if that kind of has paved the way.
[time=2179] And other parts of the person, other parts of the body come with.
[time=2184] You know what?
[time=2185] You say things that you shouldn't.
[time=2187] Let's just do some for instances.
[time=2191] You say things that you shouldn't say.
[time=2194] I say things at times that I shouldn't say.
[time=2197] We say things we shouldn't say and then our heart begins to follow.
[time=2204] So many times in directions it shouldn't go.
[time=2208] With the tongue we say things that we shouldn't.
[time=2212] And then our body follows in a number of different ways.
[time=2217] We say things we shouldn't and we eat stuff.
[time=2223] We shouldn't eat.
[time=2225] We say things that we shouldn't and we smoke stuff that we shouldn't smoke.
[time=2230] We say things that we shouldn't and we drink things that we shouldn't drink.
[time=2236] We say things that we shouldn't and our body follows.
[time=2240] You say words you shouldn't speak and all of a sudden your mind kicks in.
[time=2245] Have you ever been there?
[time=2247] You start, you just let out a word or two that you shouldn't have let out and all of a sudden, boom, there's your mind.
[time=2253] Constructing a plan, constructing a pathway to walk down toward things you and I shouldn't walk towards.
[time=2261] You say things that you shouldn't.
[time=2263] You let it slip out in anger.
[time=2265] A word comes out of your mouth and all of a sudden your fist follows.
[time=2271] Maybe an open hand.
[time=2276] There's the tongue leading the way.
[time=2278] With the tongue we say things we shouldn't and moral boundaries.
[time=2284] It's just a word or two and it just gets out and all of a sudden moral boundaries that used to be absolutely solid.
[time=2294] Clear as day get fuzzy and moved a little bit.
[time=2300] Before you know it, a life is going down a path that has no business going down.
[time=2307] The tongue.
[time=2308] James says it's like a horse.
[time=2310] Some of you are familiar with horses.
[time=2313] You've been around them.
[time=2314] You know how they work?
[time=2315] A metal bit.
[time=2318] Just that big.
[time=2320] Just a metal bit.
[time=2322] Attached to a rain, pulled in just the right way, leads a horse that naturally don't miss the correlation here.
[time=2330] A horse that naturally, see, horse doesn't wake up every morning going, man, I cannot wait to bust my tail in front of that plow with that guy cracking that whip on my back for six hours.
[time=2343] Let me at it.
[time=2345] Boy, I hope that guy gets up and comes and hops on my back and sticks his boot in my ribs.
[time=2350] I can't wait.
[time=2352] They don't naturally think that.
[time=2357] You and I don't naturally think certain things.
[time=2360] You put a bit in that horse's mouth.
[time=2363] You attach that to a rain, you pull it in just the right way.
[time=2366] And that horse plows vigorously.
[time=2369] For hours.
[time=2370] That horse carries the rider willfully.
[time=2374] For hours.
[time=2377] Now go verse four.
[time=2378] Behold, the ships also, though they are great and are driven by strong winds.
[time=2382] The readers of this letter in this day would have been familiar with ships much like the one mentioned in Acts 27 by Paul.
[time=2390] A ship that they would have envisioned would have been a ship that would have carried upwards to 350 people.
[time=2398] This huge ship.
[time=2400] You can think of an ocean lighter.
[time=2401] You can think of a cruise ship today.
[time=2403] I mean, it doesn't matter how big you get.
[time=2405] I mean, the same truth still applies.
[time=2407] There's just this little thing called a rudder.
[time=2409] And when the captain goes, the whole thing goes, whoa.
[time=2414] Just a little metal bit.
[time=2418] Just a little tiny rudder.
[time=2420] Just a little body part here.
[time=2424] Stuck behind the teeth, you know, enclosed by the mouth.
[time=2428] And your life and mine are set in motion.
[time=2432] Question for you this morning.
[time=2434] Question for me.
[time=2435] Question for you.
[time=2436] So how in the world are you going to control?
[time=2439] How are we going to control?
[time=2440] How does one control the tongue?
[time=2444] I mean, if it's so powerful and if there's so much potential for so much to go south,
[time=2452] I mean, okay, so how in the world are you going to control your tongue?
[time=2457] And these won't come on the screen.
[time=2458] If you've got a pen, just write these down.
[time=2460] Here we go.
[time=2461] Four things.
[time=2462] Just real quick.
[time=2463] Number one, write this down.
[time=2464] And I don't say this to sound defeatist.
[time=2466] The story gets a little bit better as we go.
[time=2468] But you got to just be honest and start where we all got to start on this.
[time=2471] Number one, write this down.
[time=2472] You can't.
[time=2473] How are you going to control your tongue?
[time=2476] Write this down.
[time=2477] Number one, you can't.
[time=2479] You on your own.
[time=2481] Me on my own.
[time=2482] Our best efforts will fall short.
[time=2484] You can't.
[time=2485] Number two, write this down.
[time=2487] Beg him.
[time=2488] Beg him for help.
[time=2491] No, it's on the screen.
[time=2492] Sorry.
[time=2493] Beg him for help.
[time=2495] Beg him for help and strength.
[time=2499] You know us.
[time=2500] We do our best as I think you do your best to just kind of live life honestly here with each other.
[time=2506] And I can tell you that this morning we talked about it again.
[time=2509] My wife and I, Deborah and I, we have in recent months come to this point where as maybe you've come to this point.
[time=2515] And you know what?
[time=2516] It doesn't matter how many kids you have.
[time=2517] We've got five.
[time=2518] You may have two.
[time=2519] Kids are kids.
[time=2520] And sometimes when enough things get lost, when enough things get broken, when enough things get spilled, sometimes when enough fights are going on, sometimes when you're late for the eighth time in a row, sometimes it gets a little tense.
[time=2533] That was a little too real there, wasn't it?
[time=2538] Sorry.
[time=2542] And you know recently, I would say probably in the last few months or so, we just have
[time=2548] come to the point where we just have sat down together often now.
[time=2551] We just do it often in the early morning hours or late at night.
[time=2554] And we just come together and we just together beg God to help us.
[time=2561] Because you know and we know those little lives, those little hearts, they're so precious.
[time=2566] And then they got issues.
[time=2567] And we're going to try and help them with their issues.
[time=2569] But you know what?
[time=2570] Me yelling at them.
[time=2572] You getting harsh with them.
[time=2575] Though sometimes you and I want to somehow try and kind of explain it away knowledge.
[time=2580] Ridiculous.
[time=2581] It's wrong.
[time=2582] You shouldn't speak harsh and angry words to your kids.
[time=2589] And so we've come to this point where we are begging God.
[time=2593] Oh, please help us.
[time=2596] And we ask Him again and again and again.
[time=2599] Together, individually.
[time=2601] And number three, we're starting to hide truth in our hearts.
[time=2605] Write that down.
[time=2606] You can't do it.
[time=2607] You've got to beg Him for help.
[time=2609] And here's an idea.
[time=2610] Why don't you and why don't we as people take the truth of God's word as it relates to
[time=2616] this issue of the tongue in our speech.
[time=2619] And why don't we hide that truth in our heart?
[time=2621] David said, "Thy word have I hid.
[time=2623] Thy word have I treasured." So I'm 11911.
[time=2626] Thy word have I treasured in my heart.
[time=2630] That I might not what?
[time=2632] That I might not yell at my kids.
[time=2634] That I might not have a harsh or angry word toward you.
[time=2637] That I might not flirt.
[time=2639] That I might not gossip.
[time=2640] That I might not.
[time=2641] Why don't you just take the list of biblical issues.
[time=2646] Having to do with the tongue in our speech.
[time=2649] Corbin mentioned to me at the break, crosswalk.com.
[time=2654] Crosswalk.com.
[time=2656] You can go there and just type in your word.
[time=2659] And it just gives you every single reference that there is on that desired subject.
[time=2663] Just go there and put in tongue.
[time=2665] And you just find a list of truth.
[time=2667] And just pick a few.
[time=2669] And write them on a card and put them on your palm pilot.
[time=2672] Put them on your screen saver.
[time=2674] And hide the truth in your heart.
[time=2677] Don't forget Matthew 12.
[time=2680] What we read earlier.
[time=2682] For what resides in the heart of a man inevitably in time comes out of his mouth.
[time=2688] You can't do it.
[time=2689] You can't control your tongue.
[time=2691] In and of yourself you've got to beg him for help.
[time=2694] Hide his truth in your heart.
[time=2696] And this maybe is the most humbling thing I've started to do recently in my own life.
[time=2701] And that is that when I do go over that line.
[time=2704] Number four, the moment, the moment, the instant you blow it.
[time=2710] Confess it.
[time=2714] Pull over.
[time=2715] Step into a side office.
[time=2717] Go back to your room.
[time=2718] I don't care what you have to do.
[time=2720] The moment it happens.
[time=2721] And the moment you come to grips with the fact that what you've just said.
[time=2725] How you've just said it is wrong.
[time=2727] It violates God.
[time=2728] It does them no good.
[time=2730] You confess it as sin.
[time=2731] You just say it.
[time=2732] It was wrong.
[time=2733] And not only do you say it to him, but then you probably got to go and say it to them.
[time=2737] Or to him or to her.
[time=2739] And I'd add a third component there you probably should call your accountability.
[time=2743] Friend.
[time=2744] Partner.
[time=2748] That individual or individuals that's willing and ready to walk through life with you and say, "Hey, it happened." And pray for me, please.
[time=2753] I made it right with God.
[time=2754] I made it right with him or her or them.
[time=2757] And keep walking alongside me.
[time=2759] Keep encouraging me in this direction.
[time=2764] He can control it.
[time=2766] And when he controls it, what takes place there?
[time=2771] The way that ship gets moved.
[time=2773] That's amazing.
[time=2775] Number three, it has the potential to corrupt.
[time=2780] Back to verse five.
[time=2781] So also the tongue is a small part of the body and yet it boasts of great things.
[time=2784] Here you go.
[time=2785] "Behold," James says, "how great a forest is set a flame by such a small fire."
[time=2792] The word there in the Greek for that word fire there you see is spark.
[time=2796] How great a forest is set a flame by such a small spark.
[time=2801] And the tongue is a fire.
[time=2803] The very world of iniquity right there in your mouth.
[time=2807] The tongue is set among our members as that which defiles the entire body and sets on fire the course of our life.
[time=2815] And is set on fire.
[time=2817] The tongue is, God's word says, "by hell." Because he knows.
[time=2823] He's not dumb.
[time=2824] We've been through this before, people.
[time=2826] He's a very bright individual, this guy we call the enemy.
[time=2829] And he knows if he can move, if he can guide, if he can begin to influence more and more.
[time=2835] The stuff that comes out of your mouth, the further down the wrong road you and I will go.
[time=2843] Proverbs 16, 27 says, "A worthless man digs up evil while his words are like a scorching fire."
[time=2851] Proverbs 26, 18 to 21, like a mad man who throws fire brands, arrows and death.
[time=2859] So is the man who deceives his neighbor and then says, "Was I not joking?" I was just kidding.
[time=2866] No.
[time=2867] It's madness.
[time=2869] For lack of wood, the fire goes out.
[time=2871] And where there is no whisper, contention quiets down, but like charcoal to hot embers and wood to fire.
[time=2880] So is a contentious man to kindle strife.
[time=2886] Look at that.
[time=2887] How great a forest is set aflame by such a small fire.
[time=2894] We don't have them a lot out here in the heartland.
[time=2897] I mean, not as much, but picture with me.
[time=2900] A forest fire.
[time=2902] You've seen the clips on the news.
[time=2904] You've seen the blazes absolutely just blazing out of control back at Yellowstone, back in the Sierra's in California.
[time=2912] You've seen those summer shots on the nightly news.
[time=2916] Thousands and thousands and thousands of acres just scorched by these enormous walls of flame.
[time=2924] Picture it.
[time=2926] Can you see it?
[time=2928] We used to live there and I would watch it, you know, it seemed like daily during the summer months.
[time=2933] Hills and forests just absolutely obliterated.
[time=2939] Animals killed, homes burned down by these incredible walls of fire.
[time=2947] And James reminds you and James reminds me that these walls of destructive, deadly fire that killed people and ruined thousands and thousands of acres started over here.
[time=2959] As a big fire? No, start it as a what?
[time=2963] Say it.
[time=2964] Spark.
[time=2965] See, all of that starts with a...
[time=2969] Just a...
[time=2971] Just a little...
[time=2974] Ah, he won't. He won't hear me.
[time=2977] They'll never get back to her.
[time=2982] That's how I feel, you know.
[time=2984] I can tell him.
[time=2985] I got an old stay right here.
[time=2988] Just a little spark.
[time=2990] I can't stay in the way.
[time=2993] Can you believe it?
[time=2998] And it doesn't get huge fast, it just gets a little bit bigger.
[time=3002] It just goes a little bit further and then all of a sudden, boom!
[time=3006] It's this out of control deal that leaves carnage in its wake that destroys and corrupts and kills.
[time=3014] And it's just a little spark.
[time=3018] The tongue, he says.
[time=3021] Just one small careless word and a friendship is fractured.
[time=3027] Sometimes irreparably.
[time=3029] Just one small careless word and a work setting is weakened.
[time=3034] Just one small careless word, don't miss this, and a church family is divided.
[time=3040] Ministry is thwarted.
[time=3043] Seeking people all over the...
[time=3045] Seeking people, searching people, crawling all over the place out there.
[time=3050] And church is divided, bickering and fighting, throwing out little sparks here and little sparks there.
[time=3058] Ministry being destroyed because of what gets said.
[time=3063] And I'm so thankful.
[time=3065] We don't see a whole lot of that around here.
[time=3067] I'm so very thankful for the way that you and I work at that, guarding what we say.
[time=3073] And kind and careful with our words.
[time=3076] I hope you are.
[time=3078] Couldn't think of anything worse, really.
[time=3081] Than to have you or myself say things about this place, each other, other churches.
[time=3089] Be careful.
[time=3091] Be careful there.
[time=3093] Be real careful.
[time=3098] Be kind.
[time=3101] Be gracious.
[time=3103] Be supportive.
[time=3106] A spark may seem harmless.
[time=3109] It ruins.
[time=3110] It's deadly.
[time=3111] The tongue.
[time=3112] It has the potential to condemn.
[time=3114] It can control.
[time=3115] It has the potential to corrupt.
[time=3117] Number four, write this down.
[time=3118] It has the potential to consume.
[time=3122] It has the great compare and contrast.
[time=3124] For every species of beasts and birds, of reptiles and creatures of the sea is tamed.
[time=3131] And has been tamed by the human race.
[time=3134] But no one can tame the tongue.
[time=3136] It is a restless evil and full of deadly poison.
[time=3141] The venom is incredible.
[time=3146] The point here is really just a reality check, as I said.
[time=3149] There's an essence saying, hey people, as it relates to the tongue, hey, don't kid yourself.
[time=3154] Lions, tigers and bears.
[time=3157] Lions, tigers and bears, killer whales and dolphins, all of them have been completely tamed.
[time=3163] But the tongue, ho, ho, ho, whole different beast.
[time=3167] You can't.
[time=3168] He can.
[time=3170] It's restless and it's evil.
[time=3172] Always.
[time=3173] In the Greek there it talks about always lashing out, fighting against restraint.
[time=3178] And it's bite.
[time=3181] It's bite is always worse than it's bark.
[time=3186] Full of deadly poison.
[time=3193] Just hang on to that for a second.
[time=3195] Don't let that picture leave your mind.
[time=3200] I mean what you say, you know, the bark, that's one thing, boy, the bite on this thing.
[time=3207] Where it goes.
[time=3211] Absolutely deadly.
[time=3215] Destructive.
[time=3217] Wounding.
[time=3219] Confusing.
[time=3223] Number five.
[time=3226] Just as we close, let me just give you this last one.
[time=3229] It has the potential to compromise.
[time=3232] Probably a good one for us to end with.
[time=3236] With it we bless our Lord.
[time=3238] Think about this.
[time=3239] Think of the utter.
[time=3240] I mean if it wasn't so absolutely pathetic it'd be funny.
[time=3244] It's not funny.
[time=3246] It's pathetic.
[time=3248] With it our tongue we bless our Lord and Father.
[time=3251] And with it we curse men.
[time=3256] Men who have been made in the likeness of God.
[time=3258] From the same mouth come both blessing and cursing.
[time=3262] My brethren, these things ought not to be this way.
[time=3265] The fountain send out from the same opening, both fresh and bitter water can a fig tree, my brethren, produce olives or a vine produce figs?
[time=3275] Answer?
[time=3276] No.
[time=3277] It can't happen.
[time=3279] Neither can salt water produce fresh.
[time=3283] It's inconsistent.
[time=3285] Absolutely inconsistent.
[time=3288] And yet this tongue of ours has the potential to compromise you and me.
[time=3294] While we stand in this place and we offer praise to God.
[time=3299] As we leave this place professing and claiming to be surrendered and yet you and I walk out
[time=3305] of this place and too many times just the one little word or just the 10 or 15 for that
[time=3312] matter compromises.
[time=3314] It brings into question who we say we are.
[time=3319] And he says it ought not to be this way.
[time=3323] It has the potential to condemn.
[time=3326] It has the potential to control, to corrupt, to consume.
[time=3329] And if you're not careful compromise who you say you are.
[time=3335] Let me ask if you would just stand and would you just kind of close your eyes and let me just grab a moment with you before we head out.
[time=3343] Hang in here with us before you go.
[time=3346] And let me just ask you this.
[time=3347] Go ahead and let's just bow our heads, close your eyes.
[time=3350] And let me just encourage you with this.
[time=3352] My hope is that as you walk away from here today.
[time=3356] My hope is that you would be willing to beg God for help.
[time=3360] That you would be willing to share with a friend.
[time=3363] One that loves you and cares for you and knows you.
[time=3366] The damage that you know you're doing with your tongue.
[time=3370] From not saying I love you enough to those that desperately need to hear I love you.
[time=3376] From harsh words that keep being said in anger and frustration.
[time=3381] Whatever the deal is information getting passed along that should never be passed along.
[time=3387] Conversations being whatever it might be.
[time=3389] Would you be willing today to realize the damage that is done.
[time=3393] Don't beg God for the help.
[time=3396] Hide his truth in your heart and encourage those around you to hold you accountable.
[time=3402] But as you do that and as we focus in on the tongue.
[time=3407] You know don't forget the heart.
[time=3410] Don't forget your heart.
[time=3411] Would you be willing as well to beg God to give you a fresh new heart.
[time=3418] A heart that is clean and pure.
[time=3421] I was talking earlier with Bob Purdy.
[time=3424] I said hey you know when you go into the doctor.
[time=3427] And you're sick something's wrong and they want to figure it out.
[time=3430] It's just interesting you know he says stick out your what.
[time=3432] Your tongue.
[time=3433] And he gets that little thing in there and he looks around to see what's going on.
[time=3437] Bob said yeah that's true but you know what the first thing he does is listen to your what.
[time=3441] Your heart.
[time=3443] To see if what he's hearing on the inside is consistent with what he's seeing.
[time=3448] And the two are just inextricably linked.
[time=3451] Pray for your hearts people.
[time=3453] Pray for a clean heart.
[time=3455] And if you need some help with that let us know.
[time=3458] We'd love nothing more than to sit and talk with you about the ongoing struggle you might be having verbally or even just about
[time=3466] coming to a fuller, more real understanding of him.
[time=3470] Maybe for you for the very first time.
[time=3473] Let us talk to you.
[time=3474] Let us help if we can.
[time=3475] God as we leave this place today.
[time=3478] We thank you again for this incredible study that you've had us in.
[time=3482] In this incredible book of James God the truth is so practical.
[time=3487] It touches every life.
[time=3489] It touches every heart.
[time=3491] It gives every individual in this room something to hold on to and give thought and attention toward God.
[time=3497] We pray you'd give us strength in that very endeavor.
[time=3500] God help us to be with your help more like you and guard our tongues.
[time=3506] God teach us and grow us as it relates to the words that we speak.
[time=3511] Help us to be humble.
[time=3513] Help us to be ready to hear things that we need to hear to make changes that we might need to make.
[time=3519] And we'll thank you for it in your son's name we pray.
[time=3521] And all the people agreed and said, "Amen, so good to see you." If you're new we'd love to meet you up here afterwards.
[time=3549] Help me, know you are me.
