[time=394] We focus on conflict that results in sinful behavior. And in your life right now, it might be a good idea for you to just think about where are two objects attempting to occupy the same space at the same time. You know, James is really clear that the cause of that is pride. And the consequences, which we'll see, are three-dimensional. But there is a way for you to just think about where are two objects attempting to occupy the same space at the same time. You know, James is really clear that the cause of that is pride. And the consequences, which we'll see are three-dimensional. But there is a way for us to think about.
[time=423] But there is a cure. And the cure comes from the humility of God in Christ and my being willing to humble myself to him. And then there's a change. There's a change in how I deal with relationships wisdom now occurs. I reveal God's character and presence in conflict rather than my own. And so that cycle goes.
[time=448] And I suppose whether you're a believer or a non-believer and you're going to watch this, I encourage you to think about this cycle of conflict and how we go through that. And that really the only answer, the only cure, is to go where to do occupy the same space at the same time. And that's a cross of Jesus Christ where God and man come together.
[time=471] Where love and truth come together for grace. Where mercy and justice come together to form forgiveness. And it's there that you'll find hope and change for your conflict.
[time=488] There's one other thing I'd like to talk to you about. I'd like to invite you, April 12th, any student in your life, any teenage student in your life. We're asking everyone to declare April 12th Surfest Day. And we're going to go out and serve anybody who needs it.
[time=507] And come together for a pizza party and a worship concert by Willow Creek Student Impact worship band on Saturday night, April 12th here at Blackhawk Ministries. And we just invite you to come. Anybody can come.
[time=520] And if you want more information, you can visit our website or call us. And we just love to have you come for the Surfest, the Big Worship Concert Pizza Party on Saturday, April 12th. Any teenage student in your life who you think would benefit from this, we'd like them to get involved.
[time=538] And you can go to neighborlinkfortwayne.org to find out opportunities to serve or actually type in opportunities that you know exist for people to serve.

[time=877] Thank you for coming. If you're visiting, they were just glad you're here. Thank you so much for coming. We're in a series on James. Today's about James 4. It's about conflict, real faith, reconciles conflict.
[time=890] In my life, I've created a lot of conflict. It takes me back to when Susan and I were still fairly newlyweds and we were at an auction out west and after that auction, we were going to take a family vacation
[time=906] with my brother and my dad and my mom. So the auction's over and we're going out for this little boat ride. My mom and my dad and my brother, they get on this big boat with like 50 people.
[time=920] Susan and I get in one of these little fishing-type bass boats with the motor on the back that also steers the boat. You know what I mean? You sit back there and it goes forward, it goes reverse.
[time=931] So the lady's getting us all set up and we're in the same dock as the big boat. My mom and dad and my brother and the 50 people got on that. Susan and I are in the little boat.
[time=941] And the lady who's getting us all set up to go out says, "In front of my new wife, do you know how to operate this?"
[time=951] I'm not at a course. My prize is not going to let me admit something like that. Susan grew up with a dad who fished and she rode mini bikes and she drove boats and she can do all that stuff. I can't but I can't let that be known.
[time=968] So I remember looking down and I'm facing the back of the boat and I look at forward and reverse.
[time=979] And I'm not sure which I picked, but I just went, "Wah, boom!" Right into this big boat with 40 feet taller than my boat. I mean it's way up there.
[time=989] 50 people come run over to the edge. It's proof that the boat won't tip over if they all go to one side. But I hear this voice and it's my dad's voice.
[time=999] And he goes, "What was that?" And so I got to act quickly. I look back down. I don't know which way I did it before, but I'm going to go 50/50 chance. I can pick the opposite.
[time=1011] "Wah, boom!" If the last one was a love tap, this was an act of terrorism. And I hear my dad go, "That's Mitchell!"
[time=1022] Oh, I just didn't know what to say. My head was red. I probably had hair then.
[time=1028] And I use that story to tell you this. Conflict literally means it's from the latin con and fligra.
[time=1036] Con means together and fligra means strike. It means to strike together. And conflict is two objects attempting to occupy the same space at the same time.
[time=1048] Two objects attempting to occupy the same space at the same time. That's conflict.
[time=1053] And we see it today. Two CEOs in a business merger. Two three-year-olds in a preschool say in mine.
[time=1060] A husband and a wife regarding finance are their children in discussions.
[time=1064] Siblings who don't speak to each other for decades. Each represents conflict. Two objects trying to occupy the same space at the same time.
[time=1078] I'd like you to identify in your life right now, where's that conflict with you?
[time=1084] What two objects are trying to occupy the same space at the same time with you?
[time=1091] Right now, what is it that's bothering you? It probably involves a task. It probably involves a person. It probably involves a resource.
[time=1100] And I want you to realize today that we're differentiating between good conflict like sports.
[time=1105] That happens in sports. Black Hawk, sectional champions, right?
[time=1110] Basketball, congratulations.
[time=1114] Or the good conflict that happens when all choices are equally good.
[time=1118] Or the good conflict that happens in an economy with supply and demand.
[time=1122] But we're differentiating between good conflict and bad conflict.
[time=1126] The kind of conflict that ends up or results in negative or sinful behavior. That's today's focus.
[time=1132] Jesus said in John 1633, "In this world, you will have trouble."
[time=1138] In this world, times are hard. You will have conflict. So what's the deal?
[time=1143] The deal is that real faith reconciles conflict. Real faith reconciles conflict.
[time=1151] Today, we're going to look at four things. First is the cause of conflict.
[time=1155] Second, we're going to look at the consequences of conflict.
[time=1159] Third, we're going to look at the cure. And fourth, and finally, we're going to look at the change that God has in mind in conflict.
[time=1166] So first, we want to turn to James 4, verse 1. We're going to look at the cause of conflict. First is the cause of conflict.
[time=1173] Verse 1, "What causes fight and quarrels among you?
[time=1178] Don't they come from your desires that battle within you?" And he's just set up in James 3, 13 through 18, the last package of James 3.
[time=1187] Two ways of dealing with conflict. The world's way that's kind of at the base of my brain.
[time=1192] It's my desire to immediately provide and protect for me based out of fear and pride.
[time=1200] Kind of the political way that we don't like, but we're tempted to live that way in conflict all the time.
[time=1206] And then he says, "But there's another way. That's the world's wisdom. Then there's godly wisdom, and that's different."
[time=1213] And that's what he's going to talk about. Pride is a hardened heart condition.
[time=1217] Just like you go to the specialist for hardening of the arteries, you come to God when your spiritual heart is hardened.
[time=1225] When you're closed. When you're resisting to God. When you resist others.
[time=1231] When you live a life that's all about your favorite topic, me.
[time=1235] When life is all about me, that's pride. And that's a lock. Picture a lock on the human heart.
[time=1245] It's saying to the world and it's saying to God that, "I can, you can't."
[time=1251] And it's really interesting that the biggest conflict affecting our world today is very much a result of pride in a human heart.
[time=1262] Saddam Hussein says that his idol is King Nebuchadnezzar in the Bible.
[time=1272] Because King Nebuchadnezzar was King of Babylon, and Iraq includes what was Babylon.
[time=1280] And Saddam Hussein has restored King Nebuchadnezzar's chariot.
[time=1285] He's restored King Nebuchadnezzar's 600-room palace.
[time=1289] You see, he likes Nebuchadnezzar for one very important reason. Nebuchadnezzar conquered Jerusalem.
[time=1296] And he burned it to the ground. He left the poorest behind. He took the articles from the temple.
[time=1301] And Nebuchadnezzar built this nine feet wide by nine, ninety feet tall gold tower.
[time=1309] And he commanded everyone to bow down and worship it.
[time=1314] Saddam has referred to himself as a neo-nebuchanezzar.
[time=1320] Nine foot wide, ninety foot gold tower, and says, "Everybody worshiped this."
[time=1326] And I just want to ask what's your nine by ninety?
[time=1330] What's the gold tower in your life that seems to be the picture of pride?
[time=1335] What's pride connected to? What is your nine by ninety?
[time=1339] The cause of conflict, two objects trying to occupy the same space at the same time, is pride.
[time=1345] And you might want to take a little test, just ask yourself in that conflict that I ask you to picture here in the beginning.
[time=1350] Am I closed? Am I all locked up? Am I protecting my image?
[time=1357] Do I push? Do I push and try to control the other person involved?
[time=1363] Or do I pull and try to resist that person?
[time=1366] Those are leading indicators of pride in my life.
[time=1370] So the cause of conflict, James says, it's pride. And now let's second, let's look at the consequences, which are three-dimensional.
[time=1377] If you look at James 4, 2 through 5, you want something, but you don't get it.
[time=1381] You kill and you covet, but you cannot have what you want.
[time=1385] You quarrel and fight. You do not have because you do not ask God.
[time=1390] Verse three, when you ask, you do not receive because you ask with wrong motives, that you may spend what you get on your pleasures.
[time=1397] You adulterous people. Don't you know that friendship with the world is hatred toward God?
[time=1404] Doesn't mean that you shouldn't have a relationship with the seeker or someone who is seeking God.
[time=1409] It means you shouldn't align your heart with those opposed to God.
[time=1412] Because anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world, world cosmos, those opposed to God,
[time=1418] anybody who lines your heart with that, you become an enemy of God.
[time=1422] Verse five, or do you think that scripture says without reason that the spirit he calls to live in us envies intensely?
[time=1429] Scholars have debated about what that means.
[time=1432] It probably means, and if you have an NASB, I think it's stated a little more clearly there, that the spirit that God puts in you of him, his spirit in you, he draws that to himself.
[time=1443] He is jealous for your benefit.
[time=1447] That's God's kind of jealousy for my own benefit, versus man's kind of jealousy.
[time=1452] I'm jealous of any benefit that you might have.
[time=1457] So do you understand the damage in your current conflict right now, whether it's your career, whether it's a former friend, whether it's a family member, whether it's a spouse?
[time=1465] Do you see this pyramid of three-dimensional damage? It's three things. First it's me.
[time=1471] Pride, that kind of, the cause of pride in conflict, damages me.
[time=1476] Damage is my soul. We see it in verse two.
[time=1479] Selfish desire. It ends up empty.
[time=1483] Second, it damages my relationship with others.
[time=1487] It says through killing, which might be metaphorical, like the, "Oh, who sings killing me softly with his song?"
[time=1494] It's that kind of a thing, like the words are just killing me.
[time=1497] Or it might mean literally killing, physically killing, because some Jews were killing Romans and part of their fight for liberation, so he might mean that in that fashion.
[time=1507] Coveding, quarrels, fighting in verse two, all damaging my relationship with others.
[time=1512] And then finally, it damages my relationship with God.
[time=1516] It says, "You don't pray." When pride wins in my heart, when I have a lock on my heart, I tend not to pray.
[time=1526] And then when I do pray, I ask for pleasures of things that would be apart from God.
[time=1532] Life apart from God, which is sin, any life apart from God, is sin.
[time=1536] And then I become an adulterer, or this enemy of God, because he's there all the time, verse five, he's there all the time, drawing me to himself.
[time=1547] You know, David experiences these consequences after he has the affair with Bathsheba.
[time=1552] And David's got the pride thing going on at this moment, because it's all about him.
[time=1557] It's all about me.
[time=1559] And so he does this for his own fulfillment.
[time=1562] And he's got an image he's got to worry about.
[time=1565] And so something has to be taken care of, he decides he's going to have Uriah killed.
[time=1569] And he does.
[time=1571] And so this guy, at the end of his life, is quoted as being a man after God's own heart, has his temporary laps here in conflict, where pride got a hold of him, and he has consequences.
[time=1581] He has consequences in his relationship with God that the prophet Nathan has to tell him about.
[time=1586] He has consequences in his relationship with others, and he has consequences in his own soul that he writes about, I believe in Psalm 51.
[time=1596] My experience of pride's consequences has been that I become what I despise.
[time=1603] See, I grew up in a Christian home, and I have a strong will.
[time=1608] I am disciplined.
[time=1610] And so if you're wired up like me, if you're kind of a perfectionist, and you can choose what's right, and you're motivated by what's right, then you kind of wonder why other people can't make those choices.
[time=1619] What's wrong with them?
[time=1620] And so as a high school athlete, it bugs me.
[time=1623] If a guy can go out and do whatever he wants the night before and drink and stuff, and then he can come on the court or on the field and do better than I did, that really bothered me.
[time=1632] And so it would lead to more and more self-reliance.
[time=1636] And the irony of it is that the more and more I rely on myself, the more and more I trust in myself, the more and more I become like that which I despise.
[time=1645] And that's what happened in my life.
[time=1647] I shifted from a church kid who made it all about his choices and his ability to choose what's right morally.
[time=1653] And I shifted all over here to be a prodigal.
[time=1657] It manifested in my relationship with Susan.
[time=1659] We used to get in our biggest arguments when we'd go get Christmas trees.
[time=1662] When you go cut them down, you know, outside.
[time=1665] Because I'm a guy, guys, I think you can connect with me here.
[time=1667] We can find that tree that's perfect for that room in about five minutes or less.
[time=1672] But Susie wants to go look at every tree and make sure that we did find the perfect tree, that there was no other tree.
[time=1681] And I'm bald and I get cold outside and we just had some -- there were some consequences of my pride.
[time=1688] I just want to ask you, what two worlds are you trying to occupy at the same time?
[time=1693] Better yet, what two worlds are attempting to occupy you at the same time?
[time=1700] What's three-dimensional fallout look like for you in your conflict?
[time=1705] What's it look like and the damage it's done in you, in your soul, in your relationship with others, in your relationship with God?
[time=1713] Conflict is two objects attempting to occupy the same space at the same time and the cause is pride.
[time=1718] The consequences are three-dimensional, but there is indeed a cure.
[time=1724] If you want to turn to James 4 verses 6 through 10, the cure is humility.
[time=1729] The cure is that white flag of full surrender to Christ.
[time=1733] I define humility as yielding to the true and loving call of the Spirit of God,
[time=1740] yielding to the true and loving call of the Spirit of God.
[time=1744] I'm the clay, I'm play-doh in my heart so that God can put his fingerprints all over me.
[time=1750] It's the only thing that leaves room for God to be God.
[time=1753] If pride is the lock on the human heart, humility is the key that unlocks and opens the door to the human heart.
[time=1763] We see first here in verse 6 that this all stems from the humility of God in Christ,
[time=1771] the humility of God Almighty in Christ.
[time=1774] I've developed an acronym, we're going to talk about grace and the acronym for grace, G-R-A-C-E, is God's riches.
[time=1783] If you want to write it down, God's riches at Christ's expense.
[time=1791] God's riches at Christ's expense.
[time=1795] The humility of God in Christ, which we see in verse 6, but he gives us more grace.
[time=1799] NASB and some other translations make this a little clearer.
[time=1802] He gives us greater grace.
[time=1804] He gives us grace.
[time=1805] It is greater than any pride I can have.
[time=1807] He gives us a greater grace because he's God.
[time=1811] And that's why, verse 6 says, that's why the Scripture says, and he's quoting Proverbs 3-34 here,
[time=1817] God opposes the proud, but gives grace, God's riches at Christ's expense, to the humble in heart.
[time=1825] God will take direct opposition to anyone who will harden his heart toward him and toward others.
[time=1831] God will give grace freely to anyone who will yield to the loving and true call of the Spirit of God.
[time=1841] The cross of Christ, this is the mystery of the math of God.
[time=1845] Conflict is two objects attempting to occupy the same space at the same time.
[time=1850] And you got that conflict you're thinking of that we initially talked about.
[time=1854] But what's so interesting about God's, the mystery of God's math, is that to resolve that conflict, we have to come.
[time=1861] We have to come to the place where two do occupy the same space at the same time.
[time=1870] And that's the cross of Jesus Christ.
[time=1873] Because at the cross of Jesus Christ you have God and you have man in Jesus Christ.
[time=1879] You have justice and you have mercy to form God's forgiveness at the cross of Jesus Christ.
[time=1887] At the cross of Jesus Christ you have truth and you have love to form his grace.
[time=1895] All because of the mystery of the both and in the heart of Christ.
[time=1900] See, conflict has presented you with an either or situation.
[time=1904] But you come to the cross of Jesus Christ where you embrace the mystery of the both and of Christ.
[time=1912] Because Christ is both the Alpha and Omega.
[time=1917] He is both the beginning and the end.
[time=1921] He is both the lion and the lamb.
[time=1925] He is both shrewd and harmless.
[time=1929] He is both perfection, holiness and payment for sin.
[time=1934] He brought a sword to be counter-cultural and he brought peace for all the world.
[time=1940] He is the Messiah and he is the suffering servant.
[time=1944] And Paul writes in 1 Corinthians 1, 18 that the cross of Jesus Christ is the power of God to save.
[time=1953] And he goes on to verse 24 and he calls Christ the wisdom and the power of God in 1 Corinthians 1, 25.
[time=1960] See, Jews were having a hang up.
[time=1962] This isn't the way it should be.
[time=1965] They said, you know, this should be all about military strength.
[time=1969] And the Gentiles, the Greeks, they wanted a little wisdom and they thought this was foolishness.
[time=1973] So Paul concludes his argument by saying in 1 Corinthians 1, 25,
[time=1979] that the foolishness of the cross of Christ, of the cross of Christ, God's foolishness at the cross of Christ is wiser than man's wisdom.
[time=1992] That manly wisdom at politicalism we don't like.
[time=1996] And God's weakness at the cross is stronger than man's strength.
[time=2005] The humility of God in Christ, God's riches at Christ's expense
[time=2011] demands that I humble my heart toward Christ.
[time=2016] See, humility in the etymology or the history of the word has always had an object.
[time=2021] I don't just sit here and say I'm humble, look at me and sing the Mac Davis song.
[time=2026] I always direct my humility toward an object.
[time=2030] So I yield to Christ the object of my humility.
[time=2035] Verse 7, submit yourselves then to God.
[time=2038] Place yourself under his authority.
[time=2040] Resist the devil.
[time=2041] See, get out of that dual world you're trying to live in and he will flee from you.
[time=2045] Come near to God in your conflict, come near to God and he will come near to you.
[time=2053] The white flag of full surrender, bowing the knees of my heart, bending the knees of my heart in conflict.
[time=2060] Resist the devil.
[time=2061] Stop trying to live in two worlds today.
[time=2063] That's denial.
[time=2064] Jesus said, you're either for me or against me.
[time=2066] You cannot serve two masters.
[time=2068] So quit trying to do it.
[time=2070] Come close to God.
[time=2071] Get in Christ.
[time=2073] And that's where you'll get a clean heart found through full surrender, humility towards Christ.
[time=2078] And this humility leads toward repentance in conflict.
[time=2082] Repentance in conflict.
[time=2084] Genuine, godly sorrow.
[time=2087] Let's look at the end of verse 8.
[time=2088] Wash your hands you sinners and purify your hearts.
[time=2092] You'll only get that if you're drawn here to God in humility.
[time=2095] You double-minded.
[time=2096] There it is again.
[time=2097] He keeps going over and over this again.
[time=2099] Trying to live in two places at the same time.
[time=2101] Trying to have two live in you at the same time.
[time=2104] You double-minded.
[time=2105] You grieve mourn and wail over all that conflict you've caused from your pride.
[time=2110] Change your laughter to mourning and your joy to gloom over all that conflict.
[time=2116] Negative stuff that you've caused because of your pride.
[time=2119] Repentance.
[time=2120] Humility leads to repentance to godly sorrow.
[time=2123] And Romans 2.4 says that it's God's kindness that leads us to that point.
[time=2127] It's the humility of the God of the universe of Jesus Christ on the cross that leads us
[time=2133] to that repentance.
[time=2135] And it's there and it's only there that I receive forgiveness from God.
[time=2140] And have the power to offer it or to receive it from others in conflict.
[time=2146] And here in verse 10 is the fundamental biblical principle.
[time=2150] I think it's the big idea of all of scriptures in verse 10.
[time=2155] Humble yourselves before the Lord and He will lift you up.
[time=2163] Lift up means forgive.
[time=2165] Bring you into a peaceful relationship with God.
[time=2171] You know if you've been outside the church, you think that in the kingdom of God the immoral
[time=2178] are in and the moral are out because if God's perfect and man can't measure up, oh man
[time=2185] everybody can just do what they want to do.
[time=2188] But you still have limits on that, some things you don't allow.
[time=2193] If you've grown up inside the church, you've said in the kingdom of God the moral are in
[time=2202] and the immoral are out.
[time=2203] It's all about just choosing to do right like I did, it's all about self-reliance because
[time=2209] morality depends on me.
[time=2213] But from cover to cover, the Bible says that in the kingdom of God the humble are in and
[time=2221] the prouder out.
[time=2222] The humble lets my heart be clay and lets God's hands mold me and shape me, allows him to
[time=2228] be God.
[time=2231] That's the conflict that's bothering you right now.
[time=2234] Right now what is that conflict?
[time=2237] Ironically when I attempt to live in two worlds or have two worlds live in me, I need to come to that only place, the only place in the history of the universe where two come together at the same time in their fullness, the mystery of the both end of Jesus Christ.
[time=2253] And then it becomes worship to forgive and to reconcile conflict.
[time=2260] We talked about the biggest conflict facing the world today.
[time=2263] Newsweek just came out with a wonderful story, I encourage you to read it about President George W. Bush and he lived a life that was full of pride and this is his story.
[time=2274] And it is 40th birthday just like our pastors have in tomorrow.
[time=2282] He says you know I had that born again experience.
[time=2286] I repented of my prideful ways, I had a problem with alcohol.
[time=2290] I saw three dimensional consequences in me, in my relationship with God, in my relationship
[time=2297] with my wife, my family.
[time=2301] And I remember, I'll never forget this because I was writing my doctoral thesis on this at the time I had started, George Bush was asked when he was running for president how will
[time=2312] you govern the biggest superpower on the planet?
[time=2316] And he said in conflict how will you govern, the biggest superpower on the planet?
[time=2320] And he said with humility.
[time=2324] And George W gets up almost every single morning and he prays.
[time=2328] He just said this week that he's humbled by the people he doesn't even know who lifts him up, who lift him up in prayer.
[time=2336] And he begins every morning, almost every morning in prayer.
[time=2339] Right now he's reading Oswald Chambers my utmost for his highest and he says he prays for peace.
[time=2346] He prays for the humility to make these decisions in conflict.
[time=2352] He prays for God's wisdom.
[time=2354] And it's really interesting we go back then to Nebuchadnezzar and this is so interesting that in Daniel 4-7 after experiencing the consequences of pride he found out that God does resist the proud.
[time=2365] God does oppose the proud.
[time=2366] Here's what King Nebuchadnezzar said, "Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and glorify
[time=2372] the King of heaven because everything he does is right and all his ways are just and those
[time=2379] who walk in pride he is able to humble and that should be our prayer for Saddam Hussein.
[time=2387] Saddam go ahead and be Nebuchadnezzar, the neo-nebuchadnezzar, but follow it all the way.
[time=2394] Now I, Saddam Hussein, now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and glorify the King of
[time=2402] heaven because everything he does is right and all his ways are just and those who walk in pride he is able to humble.
[time=2411] Whereas pride is a lock on the human heart causing conflict in that pyramid of three-dimensional consequences, humility or full surrender to Christ is the key that unlocks that heart.
[time=2422] Augustine, Chrysostom and Calvin said that life with Christ is anchored on three things.
[time=2431] It all comes down to three things, you might want to write them down.
[time=2435] First is humility.
[time=2440] Second is, write it down, humility.
[time=2446] And the third is, it's a trick question, go ahead and guess is, can't fool you.
[time=2451] Humility, humility, humility, humility directed toward Christ is the foundation of everything
[time=2457] that you and I believe.
[time=2460] The two objects trying to occupy the same space at the same time, the cause is pride.
[time=2464] What two worlds are you trying to occupy at the same time?
[time=2471] The consequences are three-dimensional, it's damaging your soul, it's damaging others, it's damaging your relationship with God and where is your heart in relation to the conflict in your life?
[time=2483] Where's your heart?
[time=2485] Are you living in full surrender or have you found what I found to be so attractive?
[time=2491] Partial surrender.
[time=2494] Really right now, are you doing a full surrender or are you doing that attractive Western culture,
[time=2500] American thing of partial surrender?
[time=2505] If you humble your heart and full surrender to the cure, the one whose cross is home to the mystery of the both end, then in conflict you'll experience fourth change.
[time=2519] You'll experience change and that change is reconciliation or peace.
[time=2525] Real faith reconciles conflict because I have been reconciled to God.
[time=2531] The cure came vertically on the vertical part of the cross, if you want to picture that, but the change is manifested horizontally in the horizontal part of the cross with peace
[time=2541] or reconciliation in relationships.
[time=2545] Reconciliation is like a balancing of accounts is where the word comes from, a balancing of accounts in relationships because God has reconciled the world unto himself because God has reconciled the wicked unto himself in Christ, I'm not going to meet anybody that has a leg up on me because it's all about grace.
[time=2562] It's all about grace, and James talks about how I live that out horizontally in relationships
[time=2573] in this next section.
[time=2575] He talks about communication, how I talk, better start praying, how I talk to others
[time=2584] gently, how I listen, better start listening to God, how I listen, listen to others in
[time=2592] conflict in that conflict that's bothering you right now, and then this funny thing happens
[time=2598] when you stop those words of pride, manifested in slander, condemnation of someone else,
[time=2605] this arrogance in conflict.
[time=2608] In humility toward Christ and others he unlocks the door to peace.
[time=2613] He was talking about at the end of James 3, change so that here's the key idea, so that God's character, not mine, is revealed in the conflict.
[time=2622] See I want to reveal my character in the conflict, I just want to show you the way it is.
[time=2626] But God's idea in conflict is that his character, his presence, his peace, his wisdom, his grace,
[time=2632] his mercy, his love, his forgiveness would be revealed.
[time=2639] And that's wisdom.
[time=2642] Wisdom says that Susan and I now have an artificial tree at Christmas time.
[time=2649] Wisdom says that I don't drive boats, and I just want to show you in your life.
[time=2655] I want you right now to think of someone who's really wise, okay?
[time=2660] Everybody do that because we're going to have an active participation.
[time=2663] Everybody picks someone in your life right now who's really, really wise.
[time=2667] Okay now listen, if he's rich, financially, stand up.
[time=2676] I don't see anybody, all right?
[time=2682] So we've proved that not all wise people are rich, right?
[time=2689] Okay.
[time=2690] Second, if this really, really wise person you're thinking of has a PhD, go ahead and
[time=2698] stand up.
[time=2704] Okay.
[time=2710] So we've proved that you can have a PhD and not be wise, right?
[time=2716] Think of that person.
[time=2718] If that person you're thinking of, who's wise, generally has really good healthy track record
[time=2726] in relationships, stand up.
[time=2736] And that is God's idea.
[time=2739] Look around you.
[time=2741] That is God's idea, manly wisdom versus godly wisdom, you can sit down.
[time=2747] And here's what I found, consequences in my life of pride were challenging.
[time=2755] And I was in business with my dad.
[time=2758] And when you're an auctioneer and you get in an argument to win the argument, you kick up the volume a notch and you're going to win.
[time=2765] You ought to go to auctioneer conventions, it's hilarious, you know, it's so loud.
[time=2770] But that's how I handled it with my dad.
[time=2772] That's why I was taught, just give an emotional speech and irrefutable facts and kick it up the volume and you win the argument.
[time=2779] So, man, after years of doing that, I go to my uncle who's my dad's brother.
[time=2785] And I said, I got a problem.
[time=2789] And I told him the story and I figured he'll know because he grew up with the guy.
[time=2793] And he says, why don't you focus on Christ, why don't you humble your heart to Christ?
[time=2801] And not the circumstances.
[time=2802] I said, what?
[time=2805] He said, why don't you, I said, you want me to literally picture Jesus when he's yelling at me and pushing my hot buttons?
[time=2812] Yes, come on.
[time=2816] So I'm going to do that fake it 'til you make it kind of thing.
[time=2817] And I'll never forget it.
[time=2819] We're standing in my dad's office.
[time=2820] He has just pushed the hot buttons with me.
[time=2822] And I am ready to lay out this beautiful speech at a high volume with irrefutable facts.
[time=2828] And he will know there is a God at Cruz International.
[time=2831] Anyway, I remember what my uncle said and I stopped and I thought, oh, okay, I'm going
[time=2837] to picture Christ.
[time=2840] And I kind of go to extremes.
[time=2842] So I was reading Proverbs, I was reading a chapter in Proverbs, still do, every day.
[time=2847] So you go through Proverbs every month.
[time=2849] And Proverbs 15-1, you ought to write this down, Proverbs 15-1 says this, a gentle answer
[time=2855] turns away raff, but a harsh words stirs up anger.
[time=2862] So I went to extremes.
[time=2863] I thought, I'm not just going to be like gentle and soft.
[time=2867] I'm going to give him a compliment.
[time=2870] So I'll never get hit.
[time=2871] He's pushing the hot buttons.
[time=2873] He's kind of raising his voice.
[time=2874] He's getting kind of yelling at me.
[time=2876] And I am an adult, what does that happen?
[time=2879] And I am bald.
[time=2881] And I said, Dan, you are one of the most gifted human beings I know, and he really is.
[time=2888] I said, you are the most gifted human beings I know.
[time=2891] What'd you say?
[time=2894] See, whenever, still to this day, when I pay my dad a compliment, he wants to hear it again.
[time=2900] My brother and I laugh about it.
[time=2901] You know, a lot of people are that way.
[time=2904] You know, they don't just don't get encouragement, so they want to hear that.
[time=2906] That's really what they want to hear.
[time=2908] And he goes, what'd you say?
[time=2910] And I repeated it to him.
[time=2912] And I got to tell you, that changed conflict with my dad immensely.
[time=2917] That changed the way conflict was handled in other relationships with me in my home immensely.
[time=2923] But James says, you know, time is short, I'm not in control.
[time=2927] He says in verse 14, that we're just amissed, our life is just a vapor.
[time=2934] Anybody ever go, I'll raise your hand if this is true, you ever go up to a mirror or to a glass window on a bus or a window in the car when you're a kid and go, raise your hand if you did it.
[time=2943] All right, just want to know we're tracking.
[time=2946] How many of you wrote something in the?
[time=2949] All right.
[time=2951] How many of you wrote your name?
[time=2953] All right.
[time=2954] Well, here's the deal James is saying.
[time=2960] That's the breath of God that he talks about in Genesis 2 that gives life to every human being, it's mentioned in Acts 10.
[time=2970] But what God's doing is writing his name on your heart in that mist, if you let him.
[time=2981] That's what's going on.
[time=2984] And he writes his name, but we're missed.
[time=2987] We don't know when it's going to end.
[time=2990] And James says, so cut out the boasting, cut out the pride.
[time=2993] At the same time I did the Proverbs 15, one thing, I did the Jeremiah 923, 924 memorization
[time=2999] and tried to live it.
[time=3001] Let not the wise man boast of his wisdom, let not the strong man boast of his strength,
[time=3008] let not the rich man boast of his riches, but let him who boast, if you're going to boast,
[time=3016] boast that you know and that you understand, you experience and you have this relationship with God.
[time=3022] And I just want to ask you in your conflict today, in a conflict that you're picturing, do you know him?
[time=3029] Do you experience God in your conflict?
[time=3032] Because James closes out the deal in verse 17 that the sin of omission and conflict, you
[time=3038] got to watch that.
[time=3040] Because guys, you know what to do here.
[time=3046] Because James has talked about the Spirit of God in you, because he talked about the grace of Christ, that greater grace than any pride or conflict you have.
[time=3054] Because of Romans 1 and 2 that it's written on your conscience and it's written in creation, not one person here can say, I don't know.
[time=3064] You're accountable.
[time=3065] As Billy Graham would say, you're accountable today because you heard this message.
[time=3070] It's become clear.
[time=3071] Now are you going to continue to harden your heart and keep it locked up to the God of
[time=3077] the universe, are you going to humble yourself to Jesus Christ and let him unlock peace and
[time=3083] love in you?
[time=3086] So you know the good you ought to do.
[time=3089] And so in conflict, humility sees the truth and chooses to receive truth.
[time=3095] Pride sees that same truth and chooses to deny it.
[time=3098] And that might be what you're doing right now.
[time=3101] Does your faith offer humility and peace in your heart and your relationship with others and your relationship with God?
[time=3107] Are you open?
[time=3109] Do you ask questions?
[time=3111] Notice how proud people, they don't ask, they just talk.
[time=3116] Do you ask, do you listen?
[time=3117] Are you pliable?
[time=3119] James summed it up so beautifully in James 1.19.
[time=3121] Are you quick to listen?
[time=3124] Are you slow to speak in conflict?
[time=3131] That you have that opportunity right now, the breath of God, you're missed.
[time=3140] You don't know when it's going to end on this side.
[time=3143] And he's writing his name on your heart, time is short.
[time=3148] The cause of conflict is pride, the consequences of conflict are three-dimensional.
[time=3157] In me, with God, with others, we're killing people.
[time=3165] The cure is Jesus Christ, the mystery of the both end.
[time=3169] Humility toward Christ because God humbled himself in Christ.
[time=3175] The mystery of the both end.
[time=3179] And the change is peace or reconciliation, wisdom for relationships.
[time=3184] I just want to ask you right now, what two worlds are attempting to fit in the same space at the same time in your heart?
[time=3192] Is it your husband and another relationship with another man?
[time=3196] Is it your wife and a relationship with another woman?
[time=3200] Is it your wife and the internet?
[time=3202] Is it your use of drugs?
[time=3204] And then I let everybody see that I'm also studying the Bible.
[time=3208] Are you lying on expense reports and praying to God for answers to your pleasure?
[time=3214] Are you cheating on a test and pretending to worship on Sunday students?
[time=3221] Do you have an unhealthy addiction and yet pretend to let God fill that vacuum?
[time=3227] Is it the mockery, the absolute mockery of receiving forgiveness and not issuing it?
[time=3236] Is it the audacity to have reconciliation with God without reconciliation with someone you have offended or someone who has offended you, maybe your job, maybe your family, maybe
[time=3247] with God the cycle is the same, the cause is pride, the consequences are three dimensional,
[time=3253] the cure for the conflict is full surrender to Jesus Christ in humility and the change you'll experience is wisdom, is peace, is reconciliation.
[time=3264] Start real faith in Jesus Christ, reconcile your conflict today.
[time=3272] Kelly Bird has modeled humility in my life.
[time=3275] Can you imagine a guy in his position letting me speak like this?
[time=3280] I've spent a lot of time with a lot of pastors, he's unique, he's a humble man.
[time=3286] I've never seen humility exhibited in conflict quite the way that I've seen it in Steve Longbreak.
[time=3293] I've never seen someone so willing to admit when he's wrong, someone to say a statement and then admit afterwards, you know, maybe I should have said that and to do that all the time, to live that out, to live that out with students.
[time=3306] These guys have modeled humility in my life, it's really interesting, you know, I want
[time=3313] to ask you to come to Christ if you don't know him today.
[time=3318] If you got conflict in your life and maybe it's that good conflict, I want you to hear this.
[time=3323] Paul wrote this in 2 Corinthians 12, 9-10, he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you."
[time=3330] He didn't like the conflict, he didn't like the thorn in the side.
[time=3333] Paul didn't.
[time=3334] And he says, "But God says to me, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness, humility, therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weakness
[time=3347] so that Christ's power may rest on me." Which if we would do this, we'd change the world.
[time=3354] That is why for Christ's sake, I delight in weakness in insults, in hardships, in persecutions,
[time=3361] in difficulties, for when I am weak, then I am strong.
[time=3367] And I want to ask you if you don't know Christ today.
[time=3370] If you can never look back and say, "That's when I drew a line in the sand and that's why I put a stake in the ground and that's where I humbled my heart to Jesus Christ.
[time=3378] I want you to do that today.
[time=3380] I want you to do that now because your life is a mist, your life is a vapor, he's writing his name on your heart, are you going to let him?
[time=3388] Are you going to leave that lock on your heart?
[time=3390] Are you going to let humility toward Christ unlock that and have your life changed and live reconciliation and forgiveness in wise relationships for the rest of your life and for eternity on the other side?" So I ask that you buy your knees, or buy your heads and close your eyes.
[time=3410] Does your life look like this?
[time=3412] Last night when I wanted to go to sleep, I felt like God was just pulling me back out of the bed and wanted me to write these things down.
[time=3420] And I'm going to tell you all of them, but it's like God said, "Mitch, do you know?"
[time=3426] And Proverbs 12, 16, I said, "Ignore insults.
[time=3430] Does your life look like that?" And the sermon on the Mount, I said, "Get that log out of your own eye before you see this back in your brother's eye, don't judge, does your life look like that?"
[time=3444] Do you speak the truth in love?
[time=3445] I said that and Ephesians 4, 15, does your life look like that?
[time=3450] I said, "Don't let any and wholesome talk come out of your mouth, but only that which build ups others according to their needs, does your life look like that?" I said, "Love the unlovable.
[time=3459] Even the world loves their own." I said, "Listen before answering in Proverbs 1813." I said, "Seek to understand before you understood Proverbs 1815, that idea came from the Bible."
[time=3473] I said, "Get both sides of the conflict before making a decision." I said, "Be kind to the difficult in Proverbs 25.
[time=3482] Does your life look like that?" Now God, those of us who have had our hearts locked either eternally or in a specific conflict.
[time=3496] We humbly ask you right now, we draw the line in the sand, we put the stake in the ground, we wave the white flag of full surrender to Jesus Christ, give us the key of humility
[time=3508] and unlock our hearts and release in us for eternity a life of forgiveness, of mercy, of
[time=3514] grace, of peace, of reconciliation with others, wisdom in relationships, because real faith,
[time=3525] as far as it depends on me, reconciles conflict.
[time=3530] And Jesus' mighty name, of all agreed and said, amen.
[time=3545] Praise my love, praise my love, praise my love, praise my love, praise my love, praise my love.
[time=3575] Praise my love.
[time=3605] Praise my love, praise my love, praise my love, praise my love, praise my love, praise my love.
