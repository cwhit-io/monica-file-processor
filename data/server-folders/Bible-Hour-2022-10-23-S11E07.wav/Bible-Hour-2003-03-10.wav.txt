[time=330] Hi, I'm Mitch, teaching pastor at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=333] And I want to thank you for joining us for a very unique Bible hour.
[time=338] You know, I read a lot.
[time=341] And apologists today who study our postmodern culture,
[time=347] they struggle with what does it really mean to our culture to be a fully devoted follower of Jesus Christ.
[time=356] And they all come together on one thing, one thing that they think delineates someone who has drawn a line in the sand,
[time=367] put a stake in the ground, and fully surrendered his or her heart to Christ.
[time=374] And that is a public profession of faith that is followed by baptism.
[time=382] Now, the baptism in the water doesn't save you.
[time=387] Only fully surrendering your heart to Christ is what brings you into an eternal relationship with him.
[time=396] But what baptism does is it gives you a chance to tell your story,
[time=402] to tell your story of how he's reached in your heart and changed you.
[time=408] And going down into the water, Romans 6 says, symbolizes your identification with the death of Jesus Christ of God in the flesh.
[time=418] And you're coming out of the water symbolizes your identification with his resurrection.
[time=424] New life, new life that you communicate to others.
[time=429] And then 1 Peter 3.21 says that that's not what saved you.
[time=434] Only Jesus Christ saves.
[time=437] But in Scripture, we see this.
[time=439] And today, 2,000 years later, when someone gives his or her heart to Christ,
[time=446] he or she typically is baptized and has that opportunity to communicate his or her story
[time=454] of how Jesus Christ changed that heart.
[time=458] And so what you're going to see today as a worship experience was just absolutely incredible.
[time=463] I mean, I loved it.
[time=465] But you're going to hear a few stories.
[time=467] And you're going to hear stories that range from Ben Imer,
[time=473] who's nine years old, almost 10, who will tell you how he committed his life to Christ
[time=479] while on his way to a skating party in the car with his mom.
[time=487] And the stories are going to range too.
[time=489] Laurie Reed, who I stood in the tank with and have been part of her story,
[time=495] who went to the party first, shall say.
[time=499] And I just want to ask you, as you're watching, where are you and all that?
[time=507] As you watch these stories, ask yourself, where am I?
[time=513] Am I the person who is saved as a child or am I going to the party first?
[time=525] You know, Jesus uses as a frequent illustration in the Kingdom of Heaven, a feast.
[time=531] And these feasts weren't just for like a night like you and I think of, but they were a week at a time, big blowouts.
[time=538] And God is saying to you, and He said it to me when He reached in my heart and changed me,
[time=544] come and experience the real party, the real feast, the biggest come-as-you-are party on the planet.
[time=551] And that's a relationship and having the security and significance of that relationship in Jesus Christ.
[time=558] Please enjoy these stories and consider where you are on your journey with God.
[time=562] [MUSIC - 170 seconds]
[time=736] Thank you, Father, for everyone that you brought into my life to help me and Father.
[time=745] Thank you, Lord, that you love me so well.
[time=750] Holy, I God like you. Holy, I God like you. Holy, I God like you.
[time=750] [REPETITIVE CONTENT - 354 seconds] Holy, I God like you. Holy, I God like you. Holy, I God like you....
[time=1124] Holy, I want to see. Holy, I want to see.
[time=1137] Holy, I want to see. Holy, I want to see. Holy, I want to see.
[time=1207] Holy, I want to see. Holy, I want to see.
[time=1255] Holy, I want to see. Holy, I want to see. Holy, I want to see.
[time=1282] And I said to my mom for some reason, I said, "Mom, I haven't been back." I mean, I haven't accepted Jesus in my heart.
[time=1290] And I was like, "You're right." And I said, "Well, Karen." And he was like, "Sure." And we got saved just in the car.
[time=1300] Hey Ben, it's my privilege. And it's a real pleasure. As your pastor and your friend to baptize you today in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[time=1311] There we go, Ben.
[time=1320] Our mission around here is to help seekers, both saved and searching to find and follow Christ.
[time=1325] And, you know, that comes right out of the Bible, but it's also our mission because that's the passion of the team around here.
[time=1333] And so when someone comes to Christ, or we get to be part of someone's journey to Christ, we're calling each other all the time.
[time=1340] And there was a Wednesday night, a few months ago, I said, "Kelia, I met this girl and she actually watches us on Sundays."
[time=1349] And she says, "God's doing some stuff through what we say." And you know, we're all going nuts over the phone about that.
[time=1356] But it's just been a privilege to be part of Lori Reid's journey. And I asked Lori to talk a little bit about her story.
[time=1367] Well, I went to the party first instead of getting saved. My grandmother gave me my faith and she encouraged my parents to take us to church.
[time=1382] My dad was an alcoholic and I grew up in that kind of home.
[time=1388] And when I was 14, I caught him drinking about a whiskey and asked him to stop for me, dad.
[time=1397] And he couldn't.
[time=1399] At about that same time, a cousin that I really looked up to all my life was getting high and doing drugs and I remember feeling really angry.
[time=1412] And I really didn't have a support or a church we weren't going to church at that time.
[time=1417] And I don't know if that would have made a difference or not.
[time=1421] But I kind of took on the, can't beat him, join him, motto and became a partier.
[time=1431] I married at 24 and five years later, my dad passed away at 49.
[time=1441] And three months later, my husband left me and my daughters were one and three.
[time=1448] And I've been a single parent now for 11 years.
[time=1454] The neighbors at the time did offer to come to church or take the kids to Sunday school and we did just a little bit.
[time=1461] But I turned to alcohol and used that as my crutch.
[time=1468] Six years later, I was working in Fort Wayne at an advertising agency.
[time=1474] And wearing gold shoes, I walked into a church and got to my knees and I asked God to help me.
[time=1481] My life in every way was caving in.
[time=1486] And a week later, I got a DUI and I called AA and I worked the 12 step program and I worked it faithfully.
[time=1497] And the reason why I say that and I'm doing this thing is because I had his paperwork of his attempts and it was his ego.
[time=1510] And humility is the key to surrendering.
[time=1520] My sponsor said that he thought that God took my desire to drink. He did. I haven't for that time.
[time=1529] He started me with a daily devotional, my sponsor, and I started going to church. I treated my devotional like a horoscope.
[time=1538] I went to church haphazardly. I really didn't know that God was talking back to me.
[time=1544] I don't think I listened or was obedient.
[time=1549] He worked in my life. Things got better when you quit drinking. It does.
[time=1559] But it just wasn't quite right. I mean, I got a new job.
[time=1568] He did some positive things for me. I got a new job with people in a small town.
[time=1574] My boss, who's a chemical engineer, resigned to become a pastor. I work with a pastor's wife.
[time=1582] I work with a man who coached at this church. He brought me around people that mirrored Christ.
[time=1590] And he was a blessing and brought people in my life to teach me hobbies that I could do sober.
[time=1598] But something was really still missing in my heart alone. And last year for Lent, I got down on my knees and I fully surrendered.
[time=1611] And I said, "Let's do it your way, Jesus. I want to take your path. You may have to drag me." And he has.
[time=1619] But I not only hear from him now. He's here. He's right here. He's my husband.
[time=1628] And he's my father. And he's my friend. And I want to be used by him now.
[time=1636] And I believe he's led me to Blackhawk. I started listening to the Bible hour before I'd go to church.
[time=1646] And what they were talking about were both of you. It was right to my heart.
[time=1654] And so I started coming on Wednesday nights to common ground. And I walked in.
[time=1658] And there were people who adored Christ and looked at him beautifully inside and out.
[time=1664] I felt like I was around people that loved him like I did.
[time=1669] And your outreach here has really touched me. I've been in and out of churches for 10 years crying.
[time=1678] And maybe I didn't have an open heart, but people came up to me here.
[time=1683] And one lady in particular came up to me. She heard me talking to some other ladies and said, "I've got 10 years on you. I'm 50."
[time=1691] She said, "I'm happily married now," which was encouraging. But she said, "I raised my children alone for 12 years.
[time=1702] What's your name? I want to pray for you." And it did touch me. And I used it at the bank on a single parent.
[time=1710] And she beamed. And that's what I want to do. And I want to be baptized.
[time=1716] And I've read the word, and it's clear to me that it instructs me to repent.
[time=1722] Do you forgive me of my sins and clean me with your blood and your water? Amen.
[time=1729] [AMEN] Kelly's going to thank you. And thanks for being transparent and authentic, and Kelly's going to pray for you.
[time=1739] Let's pray. Father, how incredibly encouraging to stand here in these waters today.
[time=1749] How amazing for the people here in this room to be able to sit and hear a story.
[time=1756] And the more and more we hear them, and God has people come into these waters as Lori has today,
[time=1762] and they share what you've done, how you did it, who you used, what you brought them through.
[time=1768] God, it just never, ever gets old. And we are so grateful for this place and for the way in which you've used it to impact.
[time=1779] And eventually, here, change Lori's heart and life. And we love her, and we're so glad we get to be a part of this with her,
[time=1787] and her girls, and so thankful for what you have done and are doing and will continue to do.
[time=1794] It says in Philippians 1 that what you start, you will end.
[time=1798] You will bring her to a point of perfection, some day with you, face to face, and we're so thankful.
[time=1804] We got to be a part of it. In your son's name we pray. Amen.
[time=1809] Lori Reid is my privilege and honor to baptize you, the name of the Father, and of the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[time=1824] (Applause)
[time=1845] [MUSIC - 238 seconds]
[time=2102] He says he's the king of angels.
[time=2107] It says that in Hebrews that Jesus is over all the angels.
[time=2114] "He's sovereign Lord," you said.
[time=2117] "God the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit are sovereign over everything."
[time=2124] And a long time ago, thousands of years ago, when his chosen people were in Egypt, he put a plan together to help them get out of Egypt.
[time=2140] And remember the last curse that he put on the nation of Egypt
[time=2146] was that he wanted his children to be free.
[time=2151] He told Pharaoh to let them go, but Pharaoh wouldn't let him go.
[time=2154] And so the last curse was the death of all the first born children.
[time=2162] And in order to spare his own children, he told the Hebrew people to make sure that they killed their best lamb.
[time=2176] And the poorest people got to share a lamb because they might not have one.
[time=2183] But he said to kill the lamb, he told them exactly how to do it.
[time=2188] He said make sure you take the blood at twilight, and you put it on the door frame of your houses.
[time=2197] Because the death angel is going to come across this land,
[time=2203] and only the homes that have the blood of the lamb on the door frame
[time=2210] are going to be spared the loss of their firstborn.
[time=2216] And hundreds and hundreds of years later, Jesus was taking his chosen twelve,
[time=2223] and they went to a very specific place in Jerusalem.
[time=2228] And they were celebrating the feast of the Passover, the first month of the Jewish calendar, big deal.
[time=2236] And he got them together to have a last supper with them, and at this feast of the Passover, the lamb, to end all lands,
[time=2247] told them about what he was going to do.
[time=2253] And he fulfilled all of the mosaic wall that had been passing down that story.
[time=2259] They'd been passing down that story for hundreds and hundreds of years,
[time=2265] person to person, so that they'd celebrate the Passover and enjoy the fact that God spared them.
[time=2275] And when Jesus got the disciples together to do that, he said it's a little different now.
[time=2283] He said now, when you eat of this bread, and this cup that I'm about to give you, he says this bread's my body, and this cup is my blood.
[time=2296] And it fulfills all the law, the fact that I die on the cross,
[time=2303] and I want you to remember that.
[time=2306] I want you every time you have this together.
[time=2309] He said I want you to remember it.
[time=2312] And you know what, that was two thousand years ago, and we still remember it today.
[time=2319] Because people have been faithful to tell the story, tell the truth, pass the gospel on.
[time=2325] And today we don't celebrate a firstborn being spared.
[time=2329] We celebrate the fact that I and you, each of us, have been ushered into the kingdom of God forever through the blood and body of Jesus Christ.
[time=2342] And you know what, for some of you here today, we know that that's probably kind of an awkward thing.
[time=2345] Maybe you haven't heard it a lot.
[time=2347] Maybe you haven't been in a place where people are eating bread and drinking a cup and remembering the fact that Jesus died for you.
[time=2354] And if you haven't really grasped that yet, and you're wondering about it, feel really comfortable sitting here because this is for believers.
[time=2362] This is for people that have already really sealed that in their hearts, and they understand all that.
[time=2368] But feel comfortable to sit where you are and observe what we're doing.
[time=2371] This is for the people that have received that gift that we're talking about through the blood of Christ.
[time=2378] And others of you may need to sit there too.
[time=2380] And that's okay.
[time=2382] In 1 Corinthians 11, Paul warned the people there in Corinth because a lot of them had been sick and dying.
[time=2389] And he said some of the reasons that you've been sick and dying is that you've been taking communion in an unworthy way.
[time=2395] You haven't really been, you haven't been living for me and you haven't confessed your sin.
[time=2400] Some people were coming to communion in Corinth just to get food.
[time=2404] And he said, "Beware of that.
[time=2406] Don't treat this that way." And others hadn't confessed their sin.
[time=2412] They really weren't walking with Christ.
[time=2414] So for you that need to confess your sin, and you do.
[time=2418] Because we sin.
[time=2420] We sin.
[time=2422] Those of you that need to do that, just take some time today and make sure that before him, you take some time to say, "I'm thankful, and please forgive me.
[time=2432] I want to be cleansed and forgiven." During these next three songs, spend some time with him alone.
[time=2441] Get yourself ready to enjoy communion together and then come get your cup and your bread.
[time=2448] And remember the body and the blood of Christ that died for you.
[time=2462] [MUSIC - 41 seconds]
[time=2532] Sing together.
[time=2534] [MUSIC - 411 seconds]
[time=2954] [AMEN]
[time=2956] [APPLAUSE]
[time=2961] We're going to sing again, but I wanted to share something with you.
[time=2964] Psalm 51 is a Psalm that David wrote when he was torn.
[time=2969] He was broken before the Lord because of some things that he had done.
[time=2974] And I think that might be what some of you were feeling here this morning as you've repented and come at his table to remember that sacrifice that he made.
[time=2983] And one of the things that he said that caught me by surprise was he said, let me hear joy, let me hear gladness, let the bones you have crossed rejoice.
[time=2994] And he talks about how even though he was crushed, the Holy Spirit had convicted him of something that he had done.
[time=3001] But after that conviction, after being crushed, he was able to rejoice. He wanted to rejoice. He wanted to experience joy and gladness.
[time=3009] So as we sing this next song, just let it ring out, that joy and gladness, for those of you that were crushed this morning, be grateful.
[time=3018] Because crushing brings us to that next step to be in the right relationship with the Lord.
[time=3023] And crushing helps us to know the Father better.
[time=3027] So let's sing and celebrate this next song.
[time=3031] [MUSIC - 206 seconds]
[time=3244] Let's praise him.
[time=3246] [APPLAUSE]
[time=3251] What a great, great morning.
[time=3253] And I just wanted to just take a minute.
[time=3256] We're going to sing one more song and go.
[time=3258] I just wanted to remind you.
[time=3260] I just wanted to say first of all, those of you who are here and you know him.
[time=3265] You can point to that time in your life when full surrender took place.
[time=3270] And for you and for me, these times are so very special.
[time=3275] I wanted to say something to those of you who are here, and you're still trying to figure this thing out.
[time=3281] And you know how we feel about you.
[time=3283] You come week after week and you sit in these seats and your journey just intensifies as the days go by.
[time=3290] And I want to just ask, I don't know who's up there.
[time=3292] I'm going to ask if we could go back to a picture of the babies.
[time=3296] Just whatever one, maybe the first slide of you alone, if we could do that.
[time=3300] I want to just show you a picture if I could.
[time=3304] Hey, you see that right there?
[time=3307] For those of you still trying to figure this thing out.
[time=3311] I have a hard time making it through that song because this right here is what it's about.
[time=3319] I met a couple last night at a basketball game.
[time=3322] Our boys won the regional.
[time=3324] It was wonderful.
[time=3325] After the game, I got to meet a couple.
[time=3327] Steve introduced me too.
[time=3328] Great couple and she had a three week old baby clutch to her chest.
[time=3333] The place was deafening.
[time=3335] People were screaming and yelling and this little baby was sound asleep in her arms.
[time=3340] And I looked at that and I thought, you know, that's it.
[time=3343] What a crazy world we got going on here, folks.
[time=3346] What a crazy life you may be facing.
[time=3348] But to be able to rest in a mother's arms, to be able to rest in the hands of a father.
[time=3355] Oh, we would want that for you.
[time=3357] And so today as you leave, just know again that we're here to talk to you.
[time=3362] Your friends that you know who've been praying for you, the people you know who love God and have surrendered their lives, they'll talk with you.
[time=3369] And if there might for some chance be in your situation, no one to talk to, just come talk to me.
[time=3375] I love to talk.
[time=3377] We'll have a great time together.
[time=3380] But what a great opportunity.
[time=3382] What a great privilege for the already convinced today and for you still searching.
[time=3387] We pray that you would continue.
[time=3389] And if we could be of help, please let us know.
[time=3393] This last song I think is "Trading My Sorrows." What a fitting way to end our time.
[time=3399] And again, we would just encourage you to lift your voices, stay in here, don't leave yet.
[time=3404] And just let the Lord hear the gratitude and the thankfulness in your heart as we talk about, sing about, "Trading Our Sorrows."
