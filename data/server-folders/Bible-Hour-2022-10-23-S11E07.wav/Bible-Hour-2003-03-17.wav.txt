[time=417] (audience applauding) Good morning, I wanna welcome you to the Bible Hour, and I'm glad we have a chance to talk a little bit about our Good Friday service on the 18th of April.
[time=427] It starts at 12.15 here.
[time=429] It's one half hour long, 12.15 to 12.45, April 18th, we'd love to have you come, so that we can celebrate together what God did for us through the death of Christ, paying for our sins.
[time=442] And then again, on the 20th, we'll be together for Easter, and if you don't have a home church, really encourage you to consider coming here on April 20th for our Easter service.
[time=452] This morning, we're gonna wrap up the book of James, and it's a book about real faith, practical things that you can do to help other people and make sure that you are in a relationship with Christ and you're moving toward Him.
[time=466] There's several things in this chapter that are really significant.
[time=469] We're gonna be talking to people who are rich, warning them, and encouraging them to do what they should do with their wealth, and that's most of us in the United States.
[time=477] And then again, for hurting people, we wanna make sure that you understand God cares about you, and we care about you, and the book of James talks to us about what we should do for hurting people, and what we should do as hurting people, praying, and making sure that we're faithful to Him.
[time=492] And then finally, the faithful.
[time=494] We wanna talk to people from the book of James about what faithful people will do as we trust Him and Him alone to do what He wants us to do.

[time=593] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=628] [AMEN] (audience applauding) Father, we want to make you Lord of all today.
[time=639] God, let the words that we say really be expressive of our hearts and our lives and the actions that we do, God.
[time=646] Sometimes words can just be meaningless, and don't let us fall into that trap.
[time=651] What are we saying that we want to crown you and praise you with all that we have?
[time=655] We want to sing the everlasting song, that's playing now in heaven and the song that will play for all eternity, that you are Lord of all.
[time=663] That day when every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is the Lord.
[time=669] Father, we await that day and we thank you for what you give us today to work with and we thank you, that we can give our crowns back to you.
[time=679] Help us to do that, Lord.
[time=680] Help us to have an attitude of humility that we would recognize the God of the universe, who you are, and Lord, that we would just say, "Not my will, but yours be done," and that we would give you all the praise and all the glory.
[time=694] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=715] [MUSIC] My Father, I adore you more than anything my heart could wish for [MUSIC] I just want you [MUSIC] And Jesus, my beloved Savior, everything I have, I owe to you [MUSIC] I owe it all to you [MUSIC] And Jesus come [MUSIC] And adore you [MUSIC] And we owe our children worship you [MUSIC] You are my world [MUSIC] You are my God [MUSIC] And I lay down my life for you [MUSIC] You are my Lord, the one I love [MUSIC] No one could ever take your place [MUSIC]
[time=799] [MUSIC - 179 seconds]
[time=995] I love that verse that says all my days are gifts from you.
[time=998] I pray that I'd use them as you want me to.
[time=1001] Everything I have is yours.
[time=1005] My question for you is do you really mean it when you sing it?
[time=1009] Those are really strong words and they're important.
[time=1013] They're important to who God is because he gives us so much and he asks for so much in return from us.
[time=1022] It can kind of just be summed up in a word surrender.
[time=1026] It can kind of be summed up in just that and just admitting that we don't have it all together.
[time=1032] And because you've given me everything and because you own everything like that verse said that we were looking at, it makes it easy.
[time=1039] It makes it easy to give it back to him.
[time=1042] So I want to challenge you this morning as we sing and as we prepare our hearts for this time to be in the Word.
[time=1049] I want to challenge you to give him everything and to give him your all.
[time=1053] This next song that we're going to sing just talks about what we're preparing to do.
[time=1057] Preparing to hear the ancient words that are ever true that change our lives, change our hearts.
[time=1063] So really meditate on these words as we sing them.
[time=1079] [MUSIC]
[time=1090] Holy words, long reserved for our love in this world.
[time=1100] They resound with God to light, for that the ancient words in mind.
[time=1111] Words of life, words of hope, give us fame, help us go.
[time=1122] In this world where ever we roam,
[time=1128] ancient words will guide us all.
[time=1133] Ancient words ever true, changing me and changing you.
[time=1143] We have come with open hearts, all that the ancient words in mind.
[time=1153] [MUSIC]
[time=1168] Holy words of faith handed down to this fate, come to us through sacrifice,
[time=1182] for he the faithful words of Christ.
[time=1189] Holy words, long reserved for our love in this world.
[time=1200] They resound with God to light, for that the ancient words in mind.
[time=1211] Ancient words ever true, changing me and changing you.
[time=1221] We have come with open hearts, all that the ancient words in mind.
[time=1231] Ancient words ever true, changing me and changing you.
[time=1241] We have come with open hearts, all that the ancient words in mind.
[time=1249] Ancient words, ancient words ever true, changing me and changing you.
[time=1260] We have come with open hearts, all that the ancient words in mind.
[time=1270] Ancient words ever true, changing me and changing you.
[time=1280] We have come with open hearts, all that the ancient words in mind.
[time=1306] Father, that's a heart to cry this morning.
[time=1309] That we would come today with hearts that are opened and ready to hear.
[time=1315] Lord, I just ask that we would be able to understand today something new in a fresh way.
[time=1324] Words that are ancient but still ever true and that can change as God.
[time=1329] Not words alone, but words empowered by your spirit.
[time=1333] That's what changes our hearts.
[time=1335] We ask that you do a work this morning in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=1345] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=1403] These are ancient words.
[time=1408] Last week I was mentioning before communion that for generations we have had the privilege of passing down the ancient words of God and making sure that the next generation knows the truth
[time=1421] so that they can respond to him in the right way and be the people.
[time=1425] That he's called them to be, being a light for other people and bringing glory to him.
[time=1432] Ancient words, they're really old.
[time=1436] They were true when he first gave them and they're still true today.
[time=1442] But you know what? This book starts out.
[time=1444] The book of James starts out in chapter 1 verse 2 and says, "Consider it pure joy, my brethren, when you face trials of many kinds." And then he goes on to tell us about trials of many kinds, all through the book.
[time=1456] He tells us to consider it pure joy because it isn't.
[time=1461] He says, "Consider it pure joy because it isn't joyful.
[time=1466] The trials that come into our lives are often hard."
[time=1472] And we're going to look at some of those kinds of troubles today in James chapter 5
[time=1479] that we're to consider joy.
[time=1485] The rich, the hurting, and the faithful.
[time=1490] James is about a faith that works and these three groups of people
[time=1497] have an opportunity to do what God calls them to do.
[time=1500] It calls us to do as we fit into these categories.
[time=1503] The rich, the hurting, and the faithful.
[time=1506] The rich. Here's a warning.
[time=1509] The pursuit of wealth is dangerous and deadly.
[time=1518] The pursuit of wealth is dangerous and deadly, all through the Scripture.
[time=1525] No doubt about it, not my opinion, ancient words.
[time=1531] The pursuit of wealth is dangerous and deadly.
[time=1535] Let's read James 5, 1 through 6.
[time=1540] Now listen, you rich people, weep and wail because of the misery that is coming up on you.
[time=1545] Your wealth has rotted and moths have eaten your clothes.
[time=1549] Your gold and silver are corroded.
[time=1551] Their corrosion will testify against you and eat your flesh like fire.
[time=1555] You've hoarded wealth in the last days.
[time=1558] Look, the wages you failed to pay the workmen who mowed your fields are crying out against you.
[time=1564] The cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord Almighty.
[time=1568] You have lived on earth in luxury and self-indulgence.
[time=1571] You have fattened yourselves in the day of slaughter.
[time=1574] You have condemned and murdered innocent men who were not opposing you.
[time=1579] Wow.
[time=1581] To the rich, he says, first of all, physical wealth won't last.
[time=1589] In verses 1 through 3, he tells us who are rich, and I'd just like for you to think about this for a minute.
[time=1597] You may not feel rich today compared to the people that you see around you here, but just work for a minute and thinking about how wealthy we are compared to the rest of the world.
[time=1608] I know you hear this often, but do you apply it?
[time=1612] I know you hear this often that we're rich.
[time=1616] I know that we constantly, at our church, tell you, beware.
[time=1621] Make sure you apply these passages of Scripture to you because you're one of the rich.
[time=1626] It's harder for a rich man to enter the kingdom than for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, Jesus said.
[time=1634] And that's us.
[time=1636] We're very wealthy.
[time=1637] Compared to all of history, and even present day wealth around the world were very, very rich.
[time=1646] So think about this one in terms of how it applies to you, not your neighbor who has more than you today.
[time=1653] Physical wealth won't last.
[time=1655] He says, weep about it.
[time=1657] Burst into tears is what that Greek word means.
[time=1661] Burst into tears.
[time=1663] Whale, howl with grief, it says.
[time=1668] Howl with grief.
[time=1671] Why?
[time=1673] Because of the misery that is coming up on you.
[time=1677] Now, you know, you may not feel right now like there's misery upon you, but James says to rich people.
[time=1688] Weep and whale now because misery is coming to the rich who are the kind of rich that he's describing later in this chapter.
[time=1698] To the rich like that, start weeping and wailing now because it's bad, bad news.
[time=1705] Misery means long term endurance, weep and whale because you're going to face some long term time that will be really difficult to endure.
[time=1722] Verses two and three talk about why, because wealth, rats and corrodes, wealth, rats and corrodes, your wealth has rotted and moths have eaten your clothes.
[time=1734] Jesus said in Matthew chapter six, remember, he said, do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust corrupt and where thieves break in and steal.
[time=1746] He says, don't store up for yourselves treasures on this earth because treasures on this earth rot and they rust, they corrode.
[time=1761] Rather, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust that's corrupt and thieves do not break in and steal.
[time=1770] Then he says this, for where your treasure is, though there will your heart be also.
[time=1777] So I've been trying to tell rich people for the last few years, invest your stuff in the kingdom.
[time=1785] If he's given you the burden of wealth and he has, don't look at somebody else, if he's given you the burden of wealth and he has, it's a burden.
[time=1797] Look for the opportunities to put that in the kingdom any way you can, because he says where your treasure is, there were your heart follow, not the other way around.
[time=1807] A lot of people wait, they say, you know what, man, when I get there, I'm going to be able to, I'm going to give a lot.
[time=1814] When I, I'm almost there. I feel it. And I say, give it. Then you'll feel it. Give it.
[time=1822] Don't store up for yourselves treasures on earth. And you know what, we've got some.
[time=1829] Last week I looked at another used car that I wanted to buy and I really liked it.
[time=1835] But it's big and the one I have now is a little and the top comes off.
[time=1840] And so that used car was big and it was like a living room that you could drive.
[time=1844] I really liked it a lot. On the way home after driving it over to the ball game last Saturday, I said, man, I think we ought to get this.
[time=1852] And she said, okay, it fits you really well, it's big.
[time=1857] And she said, which car do you want to get rid of?
[time=1862] And I said, none of them.
[time=1865] Steph and Josh need to drive and you got your car and then she goes, yeah, I know, but you'd have two.
[time=1871] You know what, I want both.
[time=1876] I don't want to give up the Toyota that the top comes off because all during this summer, that's fun.
[time=1882] I like it.
[time=1885] And I want to have this other car because it's nice and it rides really well.
[time=1891] And I can justify it a million ways. You know why? I buy cheap cars.
[time=1896] I buy cheap cars. So I can justify that one.
[time=1900] I can have two for the price of your one. I can probably have four or five for the price of some of your one.
[time=1908] But that's not right.
[time=1913] The tension that goes on in my life collecting stuff is really good.
[time=1919] But the fact that I can consider having two cars for me, not for my family, for me,
[time=1925] and so if you can, be generous and willing to share, we'll get there in a minute.
[time=1930] But I can't.
[time=1933] And so I can't collect things that rot and corrode.
[time=1940] He says there's a warning there.
[time=1942] Verse 4. He says the cries of the people that I'm using reach the ears of the Lord.
[time=1952] The cries of people that rich people use in order to get more stuff.
[time=1957] I have some friends who have been working hard at providing really good incomes for their employees.
[time=1967] And they talk about sharing profits.
[time=1971] And sometimes a byproduct of that is more profit.
[time=1974] So some people grab onto that because they want more profit.
[time=1977] So they're willing to share their profits with their employees in hopes that their employees will work a whole lot harder so that they can have more profit. Danger.
[time=1985] Wanna warn ya? They're both doing the same thing.
[time=1989] One guy's increased profit is a byproduct of him looking out for his employees.
[time=1996] Another guy's increased profit is the product of his goal as he shares with his employees. Watch it.
[time=2005] The cries of used people reach the ears of the Lord.
[time=2011] Let's look at that. James chapter 4.
[time=2017] I mean, James 5 verse 4.
[time=2022] Look, the wages you failed to pay the workmen who mowed your fields are crying out against you. The cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord Almighty.
[time=2031] Two different groups. Two different groups.
[time=2034] We've got the mowers. They do the labor.
[time=2037] And some harvesters who reap for the farmer.
[time=2041] Using people. Using people. Listen to this.
[time=2044] Using people has a temporary reward. It really does.
[time=2053] It has an eternal consequence.
[time=2059] Several places in the Scripture, the Bible says that masters are going to give an account for how they treated their slaves. And slaves are going to give an account for how they responded in obedience to their master.
[time=2077] Verses 5 and 6 say you have received your reward.
[time=2081] But Revelation 18 is true.
[time=2085] Let's turn back the Revelation chapter 18.
[time=2088] Great passage of Scripture. A lot of debate about what this whole chapter is really about.
[time=2093] I believe Revelation 18 is about the fall of the economic system and political system that is rampant in this world at the time that the end becomes.
[time=2108] Revelation 18 talks about three different groups of people who are going to be really frustrated when Babylon falls. I believe Babylon represents the economic system
[time=2120] that empowers people to use people to gain great wealth.
[time=2127] I asked some students of mine last week.
[time=2131] So what percentage of the time do you think you're being taught to jump into the world's system?
[time=2140] What percentage of the time are you being bombarded by people who will patch you on the back
[time=2146] and even help you set goals that will get you there?
[time=2151] One kid said 83% of the time.
[time=2155] I said well maybe that's right. Another guy kind of laughed at him and said no, at least 95% of the time people are patting me on the back encouraging me to establish goals
[time=2165] that will get me more stuff.
[time=2168] He said I'm going to get trained to do that.
[time=2171] That's where I'm headed the next few years.
[time=2173] I'm going to get trained to be successful by the world's standards.
[time=2177] That's this economic system, Babylon. Babylon is an economic system that rewards us
[time=2185] and allows us the opportunity to continue to increase our wealth.
[time=2192] And in Revelation 18 as it collapses, when that system collapses and the political systems start to collapse, it says that the kings, the merchants, and the captains and sailors all weep and wail.
[time=2206] Same words as we see there in James 5.
[time=2208] They weep and wail because the system collapses that provided them with their rewards
[time=2214] and their rewards are no longer.
[time=2219] Warning, rich people. Wealth as a byproduct is a burden, difficult to handle.
[time=2230] A lot of us have it. Listen to me again.
[time=2233] Wealth as a byproduct of doing things excellently as unto the Lord is still dangerous.
[time=2242] It's still a burden. It can be deadly.
[time=2247] There's a tension that you live with. How much should I give? Who should I give it to?
[time=2251] Where should it go? How much should I keep? Can I have this? Can I have that?
[time=2255] It's an everyday deal. Wealth as a byproduct is a burden.
[time=2261] Wealth as a goal or an objective is a calamity.
[time=2266] It'll absolutely destroy you and the people around you.
[time=2270] And you've got to watch it because in America we patch you on the back.
[time=2275] And in the church we encourage you to keep going if that's your goal.
[time=2279] And we hope you get trained to do it.
[time=2281] We send you off to places that'll push that button.
[time=2285] And we watch advertising every day that lights us up to do that.
[time=2290] It's not wrong unless it's your goal.
[time=2294] If it's your objective to gain more wealth, look out. It's deadly.
[time=2300] Let's say it again. The pursuit of wealth is dangerous and deadly.
[time=2307] Now to the hurting. Let's get off those rich people.
[time=2310] I'm really tired of talking to myself about that this week.
[time=2314] The hurting. James chapter 5, 7 through 12. Let's read that together.
[time=2321] Be patient then, brothers, until the Lord's coming.
[time=2323] See how the farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crock and how prop and how patient he is for the autumn and spring rains.
[time=2330] You too, be patient and stand firm because the Lord's coming is near.
[time=2335] Don't grumble against each other, brothers, or you will be judged.
[time=2338] The judge is standing at the door.
[time=2341] Brothers, as an example of patience in the face of suffering, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.
[time=2348] As you know, we consider blessed those who have persevered.
[time=2351] You have heard of Job's perseverance and have seen what the Lord finally brought about.
[time=2355] The Lord is full of compassion and mercy.
[time=2357] Above all, my brothers, do not swear.
[time=2359] Not by heaven or by earth or by anything else.
[time=2362] Let your yes be yes and you are no, no, or you will be condemned.
[time=2369] If it seems like this is sort of a hodgepodge of studs put together, I believe that's what this last chapter is.
[time=2376] It's James saying, okay, now let me just catch you here with all the last things I want to put down as he writes to the people.
[time=2381] Remember, these are believers he's writing to.
[time=2383] Scattered all over the earth.
[time=2386] And there's some stuff that was really important to him that didn't necessarily fit in other parts of his letter.
[time=2391] He said, now let me make sure you get this stuff here.
[time=2394] To you that are hurting.
[time=2396] Our response to pain is to wait, persevere, and trust him.
[time=2405] Be patient and wait.
[time=2408] Our response to pain is that we are to wait, be patient, wait.
[time=2416] Be patient, persevere, and be patient.
[time=2422] Trust him.
[time=2426] Verses 7, 8, 9, wait.
[time=2430] Talk about a farmer here, I grew up with farmers, and I farmed a lot.
[time=2438] And I have a real sensitivity to the rich people in that first section who always make fun of the farmers.
[time=2443] Now the reality is, a lot of the farmers that I worked for had a lot of cash.
[time=2447] You just didn't know it.
[time=2449] They had a whole lot.
[time=2450] They were great managers.
[time=2452] They were really hard workers.
[time=2455] Growing up in that community, when I went away to the city, I really went there to play ball, but I got an education on the side.
[time=2462] When I went away to the city, all the guys there were city boys, except two of us were country boys on the team.
[time=2468] And we took a lot from them.
[time=2470] You know the Hicks from the sticks and all that stuff.
[time=2473] And I had a little sensitivity to that.
[time=2475] I'll never forget Tony Opeliger just reminded me not long ago.
[time=2477] He was in my government class, and this was a long time ago.
[time=2480] Tony was really sharp.
[time=2483] A valedictorian.
[time=2485] Really smart.
[time=2486] But he made a real big mistake in my class early on.
[time=2489] He made fun of farmers.
[time=2491] He said when he made fun of farmers, he said he didn't know I could look like this.
[time=2497] He said I looked at him and he said he'll never forget how he felt.
[time=2502] And he'll never make fun of farmers again.
[time=2505] Farmers are incredible people.
[time=2509] The ones that are good at it.
[time=2511] One of the things that they're willing to do is wait.
[time=2514] They're willing to wait.
[time=2515] They do their part.
[time=2517] And they wait.
[time=2518] And they know whose part it is for the rest of it to happen.
[time=2524] That's why Paul refers to them so often.
[time=2527] The farmer.
[time=2528] Wait.
[time=2529] Be patient.
[time=2530] What that word means is there to be really long-tempered.
[time=2538] Don't get frustrated and upset.
[time=2543] Be patient.
[time=2546] Focus on the end of the temporal and the beginning of the eternal.
[time=2552] That's harvest time.
[time=2554] Focus on the end of the temporal when you're waiting.
[time=2558] When you're hurting you guys.
[time=2560] When you're struggling.
[time=2562] When there's something that's really difficult for you.
[time=2564] He says be patient until the Lord's coming.
[time=2568] Focus on the beginning of what we know is eternal out there.
[time=2576] Here's a question for you.
[time=2578] What crop is it for which you're waiting?
[time=2586] What is it that has your attention that will cause you to wait?
[time=2591] Maybe it's the end of some suffering.
[time=2593] That's true of some people.
[time=2595] Maybe it's fruition of some labor that you're putting into practice.
[time=2600] But I think it's really important for us to stop for a second and think about it.
[time=2604] What's the crop for which I should be patient and wait?
[time=2610] Is there some spiritual harvest that's really significant?
[time=2616] Is it your spouse? Is it a parent?
[time=2622] Is it your own child?
[time=2626] Are you focusing your attention on what's important there?
[time=2630] Are you willing to wait?
[time=2633] He says he's standing at the door, verse 9.
[time=2637] Do you really know he's near?
[time=2641] Do you really think about that?
[time=2643] I know I used to hide from him.
[time=2645] I mean, how stupid.
[time=2646] I thought I was hiding from my parents.
[time=2648] I think I told you this one time.
[time=2650] I smoked under a boat.
[time=2652] There was a boat dad and I, we were working on this rowboat.
[time=2655] We were putting fiberglass on and refinishing the whole thing.
[time=2658] And I stood under there.
[time=2659] My legs hanging out.
[time=2660] It was sitting on saw horses.
[time=2662] And I stood under there smoking cigarette butts that I'd found.
[time=2666] And the smoke's rolling out from underneath.
[time=2668] And my legs are sticking down.
[time=2669] And I thought I was hidden.
[time=2672] You know, you're that obvious to God when you think you're hiding.
[time=2676] You're more obvious than that.
[time=2680] He's near.
[time=2684] He's really near.
[time=2685] He's at the door, he says.
[time=2687] Look at verse 9 again.
[time=2691] Don't grumble against each other, brothers, or you'll be judged.
[time=2695] The judge is standing at the door.
[time=2698] Do you know how high a priority it is to him that you not be a grumbler and a murmur and a gossip?
[time=2705] You realize he lists it all through the Scripture.
[time=2707] And when he lists it in the things that he hates there in Proverbs, he says I detest these things.
[time=2712] Two of them are about that.
[time=2715] Grumblers, murmurs, complainers.
[time=2718] He's standing at the door.
[time=2723] Now, wait for him.
[time=2725] Do things his way.
[time=2726] What causes you to grumble when things don't go your way?
[time=2730] You can't wait until the eternal things begin.
[time=2732] You have to have things your way now.
[time=2734] Then you grumble.
[time=2738] Be patient.
[time=2739] Stay focused on what's eternal.
[time=2743] Realize clearly what's temporal.
[time=2745] Don't give it your all.
[time=2749] Verse 10 and 11, be patient, persevere.
[time=2752] He says, remember the prophets.
[time=2756] Let's remember some of them.
[time=2757] They didn't have it all that good.
[time=2759] Elijah chased all over the place.
[time=2761] Elijah, Jeremiah, weeping all the time.
[time=2764] Isaiah, they weren't loved by their people, folks.
[time=2768] They spoke the truth.
[time=2769] He says, remember the prophets.
[time=2773] Some were more patient than others.
[time=2775] Job was persevering, but not patient.
[time=2779] Now, Job was a great story.
[time=2781] It teaches us about him persevering through all those trials, but he definitely lost his patience in the process.
[time=2789] Perseverance is steadfastness, endurance.
[time=2794] The people that can go for the long haul.
[time=2796] Now, listen to this.
[time=2797] The long haul is until the last day.
[time=2800] That's what perseverance is.
[time=2802] It's not three weeks, six months, five years.
[time=2809] It's persevering until he comes.
[time=2816] The Lord's full of compassion, he says.
[time=2819] That full of compassion means much affection in the innermost parts of God.
[time=2827] He's full of compassion.
[time=2829] That word's only used there in James chapter five.
[time=2833] That's the only time that word shows up.
[time=2835] That word for compassion.
[time=2838] And mercy.
[time=2839] He's full of compassion and mercy, it says.
[time=2842] Pity is a good word for that.
[time=2845] Mercy.
[time=2846] And the only other time that word shows up is in Luke 636, where it says that Jesus said, "Love your enemies." Remember that whole section in chapter six, verse 36 and all?
[time=2857] He says, "Be merciful just as your father in heaven is merciful." He wants us to extend that kind of mercy on the people who are our enemies.
[time=2871] That'll keep you from grumbling.
[time=2873] You see, who you typically grumble against aren't even your enemies.
[time=2877] We typically grumble against our friends.
[time=2879] He says, "Be merciful even to your enemies." Compassion in the innermost part of your being for your enemies.
[time=2888] Let alone your friends.
[time=2893] Verse 12 is real simple.
[time=2896] It says, "Trust him.
[time=2899] Above all my brothers, do not swear, not by heaven or by earth or by anything else.
[time=2904] Let your yes be yes and your no, no, or you will be condemned." It's a real simple life.
[time=2910] We do things his way. We say, "Yes," when he wants us to say, "Yes." And we say, "No," when he wants us to say, "No." And we do, "Yes," and we do, "No," because we trust him.
[time=2923] And sometimes it doesn't make sense.
[time=2929] And he says, "You trust me." Be patient and wait.
[time=2934] Be patient and persevere.
[time=2937] Be patient and trust Him and Him alone.
[time=2942] Hurting people, we are hurting.
[time=2945] A lot of painful things going on in our lives.
[time=2948] He wants us to trust.
[time=2949] He wants us to be like the prophets.
[time=2952] Some of them lived their whole lives rejected, rejected.
[time=2959] Be like Him.
[time=2962] Next, the faithful.
[time=2966] The rich, the hurting, and the faithful.
[time=2970] And this is just some final pieces to this real faith that we've been talking about.
[time=2976] A faith that works.
[time=2978] He says, "To you people," he says, "pray when you need help."
[time=2984] Look at verses 13 through 19.
[time=2989] Does anyone of you in trouble, he should pray?
[time=2992] Does anyone happy?
[time=2993] Let him sing songs of praise.
[time=2995] Does anyone of you sick?
[time=2996] He should call the elders in the church to pray over him and anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord.
[time=3001] And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well.
[time=3004] The Lord will raise him up.
[time=3005] If he has sinned, he will be forgiven.
[time=3007] Therefore, confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed.
[time=3012] The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective.
[time=3015] Elijah was a man just like us.
[time=3018] He prayed earnestly that it would not rain and it did not for years.
[time=3022] It did not rain on the land for three and a half years.
[time=3025] Again, he prayed and the heavens gave rain and the earth produced its crops.
[time=3030] My brothers, if one of you should wander from the truth and someone should bring him back, remember this, whoever turns a sinner from the air of his way will save him from death and cover over a multitude of sins.
[time=3044] I said some final pieces to this real faith.
[time=3048] Pray when you need help.
[time=3051] Trouble.
[time=3053] Suffering ill.
[time=3054] Suffering from any source that's external.
[time=3057] That's what that is.
[time=3058] Trouble that comes from the outside in.
[time=3061] Pray when that comes to you.
[time=3065] Happy, sing songs of praise.
[time=3068] That word praise is an interesting word, it's used there and it's really about playing on the stringed instruments.
[time=3075] That's what it's really about.
[time=3077] Songs of praise, praying, bringing glory to him, thanking him as you play on the stringed instruments.
[time=3083] If you can't do that yourself, get some music that you can play to him that way or sing to him, that's all right.
[time=3090] But praise him when you're happy.
[time=3092] I think often we forget about him when we're happy.
[time=3097] Some people, when they define what they do when they're happy, it's like the farthest thing from what they do when they're thinking about him.
[time=3106] Praise him when you're happy.
[time=3112] Then pray when you need healing.
[time=3114] This is a hard part, okay?
[time=3116] So pay attention, we're going to go through it kind of quickly.
[time=3118] This is hard.
[time=3120] Verse 14.
[time=3125] Is anyone of you sick, NIV says?
[time=3128] He should call the elders of the church to pray over him and adoint him with oil in the name of the Lord.
[time=3132] And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well.
[time=3135] The Lord will raise him up.
[time=3137] If he has sinned, he will be forgiven.
[time=3139] Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed.
[time=3144] The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective.
[time=3147] That word for sick there, a lot of people kind of dismiss the physical side of that possibility, okay?
[time=3154] And they talk about it being weak in faith.
[time=3156] And it can mean that.
[time=3158] It really can mean that.
[time=3160] It also, in the gospels, is translated sickness, physical illness, a lot.
[time=3169] I don't think it's fair to just dismiss that.
[time=3172] I think it's really important for us to realize this is a hard one.
[time=3176] Having the elders come and pray and then not have someone healed the way you think they should be healed is a difficult thing.
[time=3183] I've done it.
[time=3184] I have them come pray for Renee that we anointed her with oil.
[time=3189] We begged the Lord, "Please heal her." I believe he did, but he didn't do it the way I wanted him to.
[time=3197] And so when I study this passage, I think, "Man, was it my faith that was lacking?
[time=3201] Was it the elders that?" No, I don't think any of that's true.
[time=3205] But I do think there's a significance to this passage of Scripture that we should not ignore.
[time=3211] It can be that God raises up people physically through those circumstances right there.
[time=3220] Most people, like I said, think it means to be weary, to be weak in faith, and so that the prayers can turn somebody around.
[time=3227] It makes some sense because the passage talks about if he's been in sin, which would weaken your faith,
[time=3233] obviously they can be changed if they'll confess their sin be forgiven.
[time=3238] It's interesting at the end there, it says, "And God really listens to the fervent prayer of a righteous man."
[time=3245] A righteous man has a fervent, effectual prayer.
[time=3250] Neil Clay prays that in his prayers all the time.
[time=3255] The fervent prayer of a righteous man of valeth much.
[time=3258] Gene James.
[time=3263] I'd do it again if Josh or Nancy or any of my family, I'd have them come again because it says so.
[time=3272] I'm going to do what it says, and when I don't understand it, I'm going to speak the truth to you and say I don't understand it.
[time=3278] But I'd do it again.
[time=3283] Elijah had supernatural ability to communicate with the Father, verses 17 and 18.
[time=3289] He had an incredible relationship with the Father.
[time=3292] It doesn't say that for no reason.
[time=3295] There's a reason for God saying Elijah was able to stop the rain and it says he's a man just like us.
[time=3309] I can have that kind of relationship with the Father.
[time=3316] Then verse 19, look at that, "My brothers, if one of you should wander from the truth and someone should bring him back, remember this,
[time=3325] whoever turns a center from the air of his way will save him from death, cover over a multitude of sins."
[time=3332] We have the privilege of confronting people in love and bringing them back.
[time=3341] And he wants us to be willing to do it.
[time=3344] Confront when necessary.
[time=3346] This is how you do it. Read Matthew 18, 15 and following.
[time=3350] It'll give you some clear directives about how to do that.
[time=3353] Galatians chapter 6 verse 1 says where to do that.
[time=3357] First of all, considering ourselves, you take the beam out of our eye there, Matthew.
[time=3362] Remember that? You take the beam out of your eye before you go confront them about the speck in theirs.
[time=3367] And then in Galatians 1, we make sure that we do it in love, in love, not holding it over them.
[time=3378] If you're rich, listen to me.
[time=3382] Don't be arrogant or put your hope in wealth, which is so uncertain, but put your hope in God who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment.
[time=3392] Be rich in good deeds, generous and willing to share.
[time=3397] If your wealth is a byproduct, apply that 1 Timothy chapter 6 passage to your life.
[time=3403] If it's a product, if it's a goal, change your goals.
[time=3408] It's deadly.
[time=3410] Teach your children the truth that the pursuit of wealth is dangerous and deadly.
[time=3416] It's okay as a byproduct of godly living, but not as a goal or measure of success, danger.
[time=3427] If you're hurting, fix your eyes on Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith.
[time=3436] Focus on Him, not the temporal.
[time=3440] Wait, persevere and trust Him if you're hurting.
[time=3448] If you're faithful, be in an attitude of prayer when you're in need, when you're happy, when you're hurting, and when you need to confront another.
[time=3464] Pray with faith. Be willing to go after the wandering and bring them back.
[time=3472] Take the beam out of your eye and lovingly confront them about the speck in theirs and help them to see their speck and your love, the love of Christ through you.
[time=3490] Hang on to Him.
[time=3495] Lord, please help us as we try to do that.
[time=3499] I pray that James chapter 5 would become a reality in our lives that this wouldn't be a place full of rich people who are misusing wealth,
[time=3513] and that this wouldn't be a place where we're not turning towards you by prayer and just begging you for help.
[time=3520] And I pray that we'd be a people willing to trust you completely, and that we'd confront when necessary.
[time=3529] God, please help us. If you don't do it through us, it won't happen.
[time=3535] Please empower us by your spirit. In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3544] We praise you, Lord.
[time=3557] I've got a plan.
