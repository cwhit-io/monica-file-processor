[time=583] I don't know why you've come here this morning but I bet that a lot of us has come for different reasons and this song just talks about different reasons that we bless its name
[time=594] and there are times when life is so good and we're so grateful for what God is doing and who He is and it's so easy to just say blessed be your name but there's some times when life is dark and life is hard and it's really hard to say blessed be your name when you're trying to figure out why God has brought about what He has so I'm going to challenge you as we sing this course one more time just to sing it with all your heart and sing it to God don't neglect the fact that He is here and dwelling among us in this room
[time=628] and know that He's here and He knows your heart and He wants you to bless His name this morning so let's just try that one more time just sing the chorus Blessed be the name of the Lord, blessed be your name
[time=647] Blessed be the name of the Lord, blessed be your glory as name
[time=687] When I come into His presence, I humble myself
[time=696] I lift up both my hands and I begin to worship Him
[time=711] I worship Him
[time=717] For our heart is done for me
[time=726] Redeem that sent me free
[time=734] Let me pause, just because He's gone
[time=747] When I come into His presence, I humble myself
[time=758] Remembering what He's done, the victory needs fun
[time=766] So I praise Him
[time=780] For our heart is done for me
[time=789] Redeem that sent me free
[time=796] Let me pause, just because He's gone
[time=809] Oh, my God
[time=832] For our heart is done for me
[time=842] Redeem that sent me free
[time=850] Let me pause, just because
[time=861] Just because And because Just because He's gone
[time=884] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Blackhawk Ministries
[time=890] And it is great to be with you again and I'm so looking forward to you being able to kind of take part in what you're about to see
[time=899] What you're going to see is a Sunday morning that we spent together as a family a couple of months ago
[time=905] And it was a very powerful, very special, very unique time periodically
[time=911] You know, we think it's good just to kind of press pause and as a family come together
[time=917] And in coming together, give us the opportunity to come alongside each other
[time=923] In special and unique ways, in ways that only kind of the body of Christ can do
[time=929] And there is this theme that we established for that morning and it was the idea of seasons
[time=936] And you know, every soul, every life, every one of us, you and me, we go through these different seasons of life
[time=944] And sometimes it's really good, and sometimes it's really rich and encouraging And full of victories and things that go well in relationships that flourish And then there are times when it's not so well There's times when seasons of life, when the days get dark and the picture gets really blurry
[time=965] And your heart and mind get really heavy and it's cyclical
[time=973] It goes south and then it heads back in a good direction There's times of change, there's times of transition And my hope is that you would listen today really closely And allow what we do here and allow what you hear to really speak to you I think you'll really be encouraged And I hope more than anything you'll be reminded that we serve a God who is very aware of our circumstances
[time=998] A God who cares deeply about the summer and the spring, the winter and the autumn of your life and mind
[time=1007] Listen, and I hope your heart is encouraged. Thanks
[time=1020] Every evening sky and invitation to trace the pattern stars
[time=1029] And early in July a celebration for freedom that is ours
[time=1039] And I notice you in children's games in those who watch them from the shade
[time=1049] Every drop of sun is full of fun and wonder
[time=1058] You are summer
[time=1069] And even when the trees have just surrendered to the harvest time
[time=1083] For fitting their leaves in late September
[time=1089] And sending us inside, still I notice you when change begins
[time=1097] And I am raised for colder winds
[time=1103] I will offer thanks for what has been and what's to come
[time=1112] You are autumn
[time=1143] And everything in time and under heaven finally falls asleep
[time=1155] Wrapped in blankets white all creation Shivers underneath and still I notice you when branches crack
[time=1168] And in my breath on frosted glass
[time=1174] Even now in death you open doors for life to winter
[time=1182] You are winter and everything that's new has greatly surfaced
[time=1192] Teaching us to breathe And what was frozen through is newly purposed
[time=1203] Turning off things green so it is with you And how you're making new with every season's change
[time=1216] And so it will be as you are recreating me
[time=1224] Summer, autumn, winter, spring
[time=1254] Thank you Denise Corbin and team
[time=1261] The big question, the big idea of the day is What season? What season best depicts your soul?
[time=1271] Right now, where is your soul? And what season is your soul?
[time=1279] I've been thinking a lot about this week about seasons of the soul And I see this common theme in seasons and the soul
[time=1291] And I liken it to a painting And there's three things about that painting that I know you see in seasons And that is there's an artist, there's a holder of the brush
[time=1306] And that's God, as far as seasons are concerned, Genesis 1.14 says God created the seasons
[time=1313] So it's not just the artist or the holder of the brush But the second thing about a painting is that colors cover the entire canvas
[time=1323] Colors cover the entire canvas And in terms of seasons everything has a season, that's Ecclesiastes 3.1
[time=1331] Everything has a season But the third thing about that painting that's very similar to seasons
[time=1341] Is that if you look closely, you'll see this mystery of movement in a painting
[time=1349] And seasons like the mystery of movement in the painting are always moving
[time=1355] They're in motion, can't stop them Whether it's March 21st or whatever, if it's going to be winter, it's going to be winter It's going to be spring, it's going to be spring, autumn, autumn and so on Well, with your soul, it's the same way God created your soul He's the artist of your soul As a painting as colors all over the canvas Every human being has a soul Every human being has a soul And then if you look closely, if you listen closely Even though you can't touch it, Jonathan Edwards said on this side The soul, the spirit, it's welded together with the body But even though that soul, you can't touch it You know it's there and there's that mystery of movement And so I just thought it'd be good today to have you at least have a definition of the soul
[time=1419] To process all this information as we discuss which season of life is your soul in today
[time=1427] And it's really hard, it's difficult, scholars have a tough time with this But the soul, in a simple way, is your mind, your will and your emotions
[time=1439] Your mind, your will, your emotions Your mind would be your thoughts The images, the information, the ideas and your thoughts The will is your choices or your actions
[time=1459] And then your emotions, that would be your feelings Those difficult things to say, what are those?
[time=1465] Sad, sad, glad, afraid, where do they come from?
[time=1471] So I'd just like you to process the question As we go through these four seasons Which season bestie picks my soul, my mind, my thoughts, my will, my choices
[time=1487] And my emotions, my feelings, and Kelly's gonna get us going with summer
[time=1493] This song that you just heard Denise sing It started with summer And I want you to, and I know it might be a little difficult today whether being what it is But go ahead and think about it Think about summer, if you will, just for a moment Let me just read to you what she's saying there Maybe you caught the words Every evening sky and invitation To trace the pattern stars And early in July, a celebration For freedom that is ours And the songwriter says here, and I notice you She says in children's games And those who watch them from the shade Every drop of sun is full of wonder Full of fun and full of wonder, you are summer For the soul that finds itself In that season of life And maybe that's you this morning And we want to give you the opportunity To just do some reflection today And then we're gonna pray for you As we can go through each and every season But those of you that maybe this morning might find yourself in this season of summer You might this morning find yourself basking In his goodness Is that what it feels like maybe for you today?
[time=1566] Do you look at life and do you look at the circumstance that he has you in And do you look at the road that he's taking you down And today right now Do you sense and do you see Circumstantially and even in your soul His goodness Psalm 30, Psalm 35, 9 says And my soul shall rejoice in the Lord It shall exalt in his salvation Look at that Is that where you find yourself today?
[time=1596] Do you find yourself as you face this life That he's given you today?
[time=1600] Maybe today you're sensing Him taking you down roads where you have experienced Great victory Things seem to be going well There's an appropriate sense of excitement in your spirit You feel good About the things that he's doing with you You feel grateful You feel a genuine sense of excitement Words that might depict Words that might best describe This season for you are words like harmony There's a real sense that What he's doing and what you're doing And the things that you're giving yourself to And kind of just again because of him And the way he's doing it now At this stage of the game for you It all seems to be kind of Fitting together When there's a real sense in your spirit That he's at work Anticipation Excitement Gratitude I think about my kids I was thinking about them as I was thinking about this It didn't really matter what the decision is It could be on a number of different topics But in our house at least I don't know how it is for you But when a decision comes down When a plan is made When something gets communicated And it's met with great favor In a sense of yes I might say or Kebber might say whatever it is And immediately with most of them Especially the older ones The arms go up And there's this sense of yes God is on the throne And my dad is cool And the arms go up And they just kind of bask In the fact that, you know, it doesn't always happen They don't always get what they want Want, you and I don't always get It doesn't always go as we Planned or would hope But sometimes There's a season When he seems to Answer the prayers You with me?
[time=1721] Sometimes there's this season When he seems to really be listening And stuff happens Decisions come down And a road gets paved and we go Wow, it's good to be alive And maybe today And don't feel guilty about it Don't feel ashamed of it Maybe today that is you And we want to just take a minute here And that we're family here, folks So don't anybody feel uncomfortable with this We just want to be able to Reflect a little And we want to just take The reality of where we are To him In whatever form we might need to And so for those of you Who find yourself in this In this season of summer Basking in his goodness Would you just do me a favor We're all going to just Spend a moment here in prayer And if that's you And y'all can go ahead and bow your heads If that's you Would you just stand Right where you're at And don't feel self-conscious about it Would you just stand Go ahead, heads bowed and ice closed And if you kind of sense That this is the season there Thanks, just go ahead and stand Go ahead and stand Right where you're at If as you reflect on the Stage of life that he has you in Right now today You sense a real measure Of his grace and goodness Things are going well You feel him at work in your soul Thank you, just stand there if you would And I'm going to go ahead And just keep standing if that's who you are And let me just pray for you And you know what?
[time=1818] Again, I've been reading recently And have been studying about prayer And the different postures of prayer That we see in God's Word And so again, just in the privacy Of your own heart there With heads bowed and ice closed You may even want to act like a kid Who just got a wish And if you, as we pray for you If you want to just kind of Lift your hands to him in gratitude You're more than welcome to Because I think he longs to see Your expression in mind Of gratitude and thanks So, those of you with souls In the season of summer With hands and/or hearts Just lifted to him Let me pray for you, can I?
[time=1860] Father, as I look out And I see these people standing here People who would today recognize That your goodness and your grace That the richness of your blessing God is being experienced in their lives God, as they stand here today before you And they recognize what a good God you are And as they see things at work Or they see things in their family Or they see things even spiritually In their own lives Experiencing blessing And growth and maturity God, as they sense a movement That is positive And honoring to you God, we bask in that with them And we thank you for the encouragement That comes with this kind of season We thank you for the hope that it brings We thank you for the utter joy With arms raised high We just are so grateful That you bring these This season of life Periodically And God, I pray for those who stand here This morning At this point In relationship to this season God, I pray That they would be mindful of the fact That what Mitch said is so very True Seasons Change And so God, I pray That you would give them the strength And courage To not only face this season With a sense of anticipation And gratitude But God, as that season changes Whenever that might be And whenever that might entail God, I pray that you would In a way that only you can help these That stand here today Remember you Remember your grace and your goodness The way in which you work The way in which you stretch and grow God, give them the courage And ability To remember these sunny days And to thank you for it In your son's name we pray Amen Amen Amen We'll keep moving on here Just as the season of the soul Summer is celebration Autumn Represents change The leaves change color It's a time of harvest I remember that When the Bible coach had a sign On his office window, it said There is no progress Without change And as I've thought about Change a lot this week especially I really think that change Is really either positive or negative There isn't a whole lot of Neutral change We're either kind of headed Forward with God Or headed backward In the change that occurs And I see the same thing In the season As we see in the seasons themselves And in the soul That God is holding the brush God creates change Daniel 2 21 When Daniel has had God Revealed to him, Nebuchadnezzar's dream He says God changes Times and seasons God changes Times and seasons God is the holder Of the brush of change And we also see that Just as every spot on the canvas Has color Everything changes Everything changes Leonard Sweden Professor of Evangelism And an author and a postmodern Culture expert Says that even change Has changed Changed used to be incremental Little bitty steps And now with the internet and technology Even change has changed To be exponential Even change has changed Everything changes Change is no longer incremental But it's exponential And then finally Just as with the artist If you look closely In change You'll see that mystery of movement And maybe if this is you You're seeing movement in your life Maybe there's a change in your career If this is you You've moved either From one level To a higher level Or maybe to a lower level To make room for family Or maybe you've moved companies Maybe you've switched entire Occupations Maybe there's movement in your home Maybe you've moved geographically Maybe you came from a different state Or a different city to here Maybe you're going Maybe like my wife You're pregnant And there's going to be Change in your home And you're now going to be Cruise party of Six Wow Maybe you're like Corbin And Tanya and you're engaged And man is your life going to change And you're in this season of change Well, when you think about That change is either Positive or negative Pretty much But everything's changing It's important to hold on To the one who does not change And that's God Malachi three six God says I do not change You know God has a soul God has a mind, he has thoughts God has a will Right? We know that And God has emotions God has feelings Scripture talks about the feelings of God And the nature Or the purity Or the love or the forgiveness Or the mercy or the justice Of God's soul Doesn't change And so if you're in a season of change You want to remind yourself That you've got to open the hands So if you're in a season of change Palms lifted up And say God whatever You give and take away I'm going to anchor my soul In yours So I'd like you to stand If this is you If you're in a season of change If there's been movement In your soul And movement in your life Either career Or family Or you stand now If you're in a season of change And we want to pray for you And just like Kelly talked about the postures of prayer Where summer arms are lifted up What I'd like to do and you can do this with your body If you want palms lifted up But I invite you to do this in your soul Palms lifted up God whatever Let's pray God I'm reminded that Psalm 143-6 says My hands Are stretched out And opened up and my soul thirst for you And God is these people Open their hands And say God Our souls Let them be anchored to yours You who You don't change
[time=2307] God may we just do that With our lives Anchor our souls to you Palms open thirsty for you That through whatever the change is Whether it's career The pregnancy in new life coming A new marriage coming A move That we Allow you To continue to hold The artist's brush In Jesus name Amen Well as that song progressed And maybe we can even bring the house lights down a little bit On this one We move from autumn To a season called winter And let me just take you back here to the Lyrics that we That we heard And everything in time And under heaven Says Finally falls asleep Wrapped in blankets white All creation Shivers underneath And still I notice you The songwriter says When branches crack And in my breath on frosted glass Even now in death She says you open doors For life to enter You Are winter The reality is that For some of you Here today It's not summer And it's not autumn And it certainly doesn't feel like spring For some here today As you consider the season Of your soul And the reality Of where God has you Same God Same incredible sense of love And devotion to you The same God that a while ago Had you basking in his goodness Today For reasons that he knows So very well And we sometimes don't He's got you in a place Where the winds are blown Really hard And really really cold Maybe you In your spirit can echo The words of the psalmist In that great old chapter In Psalm 23 Says in Psalm 23 4 And even though I walk Through the valley Of the shadow of death For even though I walk Through the valley of the shadow of death It says I fear no evil For thou art what?
[time=2475] For thou art with me And you see sometimes I mean we can just be We can just be honest here Because we've all walked Through that valley And whether it be literal death Or whether it be Circumstantial Happenings in our life that Feel like death We've all known that sense Looking up in the midst of it all And maybe just like wondering Are you really there?
[time=2507] I mean I know it says I fear no evil for thou art with me But there are times when The season of life that he has You and I in leads us to Points of real confusion That would be a word That maybe would mark How you're feeling And what you're sensing In this season of winter Confusion Loneliness Anger A great sense of emptiness And I wonder this morning If you would just in The quietness of your own heart Maybe it's easy for you too Maybe it's a challenge too But would you be able to just admit That these days It doesn't make sense These days it seems almost Too much to bear These days you just find Yourself kind of floundering Wondering when in the world It might get sunny Again Physically Relationally Spiritually There may be folks in the Room today and Physically I mean you may have Just gotten or a good friend Or someone you love Deeply may have just gotten Some test results That maybe have just kind of Sent you spiraling Hurting and confused Sadened by the reality Of this fallen world And its impact on our Physical beings Relationally you may be going Through it at home You may be going through A little tension With a spouse Or with a son or a daughter Or a good friend And what was once sweet And right maybe today Just feels completely lost And hopeless And let me just say this About spiritual Kind of a spiritual Winter Spiritually you may be Feeling a distance from him And I can just tell you this From experience, alright?
[time=2644] Sometimes the distance that We feel from him and since Is a season that He's bringing you and I through Sometimes he just has Some things for you to learn And though he hasn't gone Anywhere, though he hasn't Left and though he is near It seems as if maybe Not There's also some spiritual Darkness if you will There's also a sense of Winter that comes With something called sin Does that make sense?
[time=2684] Sometimes you and I We make choices Sometimes we make decisions We do things and we Say things and we Go places and Things done, places gone That shouldn't have Shouldn't have taken place And that Sin Creates a distance And so I wonder today I wonder today if this is Where you find Yourself I wonder today if maybe it Just seems like winter Broken branches and Cold dark loneliness A sense of Kind of being on your own Then again Your willingness to just this Morning honestly identify Yourself as being in that Season it's not something to Be ashamed of It's not something to be Embarrassed of Like Mitch said in the beginning Seasons change He brings us through to these But we want to as a family Be able to kind of put our Arms around you if in fact That's where you are Maybe i'll do this Corbin if you wouldn't mind Could you just come up and And just play a little there And let me ask the rest of you Just to bow your heads And we'll do this if you don't Mind if this is where you are This morning in all honesty Before God and just The integrity and sincerity Of your own heart Would you give us the privilege Of doing what a church does And that is we stand next to We come alongside We do our very best to encourage And would you mind if in fact This is the season of life You find yourself and Maybe you'd be open to not Just standing but Would you mind just coming down Here and letting us pray with you And you can just The rest of you with your Heads bowed and your eyes closed If you're in winter you don't have To but we would love the opportunity To just kind of put our arms Around you And pray with you this morning Kind of up close So just make your way down Here if you would Corbin's just going to play And you can just get up and you can Just walk right on down here And count it a privilege Come on down Maybe the rest of you would just join us
[time=2854] In a word of prayer And we'll just hang on to Each other here Father we We come before you this morning So Very grateful For the words that we That we find in the book of Psalms It says there in Psalm 30 I will extol the O Lord For you have lifted me up And you have not let my enemies Rejoice over me O Lord my God I cried to thee for help And you did heal me O Lord you brought me up from Sheol You have kept me alive That I should not go down to the pit Sing praise to the Lord You his godly ones And give thanks to his holy name For his anger is but for a moment His favor is for a lifetime Weeping may last for the night But a shout of joy Comes in the morning Father I thank you so very much We as a family thank you For these who stand with us Here this morning experiencing The dark days of winter And God I pray that in the midst Of whatever it is that they may be Facing here today Be it physical, relational, spiritual Or maybe the winds are blown Really hard and it's all three I don't know but God I pray We pray this morning that you would give These dear friends An extra measure of strength To face these winds To not be blown but to stand still And their love And in their trust In you God I pray that their trust In you would be strengthened And furthered God I pray that we could as a family Come alongside in ways that would Make a difference And God I pray That if it be within the parameters Of your will that whatever it is That is Whatever it is That is for these folks here The winter of this day God I pray it would pass That bright days Full of hope and A realization of where You've brought them God that it would come soon And that they would be better Grown stronger More fully surrendered to you We thank you for these people We pray God your hand upon them Your son's name And all the people agreed and said Amen we love you guys Thank you so much for coming down Thank you
[time=3024] And just as Summer is celebration An autumn is changed And winter is cold Spring is creation Where things are new Where you move from old to new From cold to warmth I'll never forget Be almost 13 years ago In my house We experienced Winter and spring At the same time My brother-in-law who was my age Today back then Susan's brother Was fighting leukemia And I noticed a bruise on his arm And his physician said You need to get to an oncologist And he realized he had leukemia And he started doing treatments And he had this year and a half Of remission And just as it goes They told him 30 days 30 days longer And you've got like a 90-some Denver And he called me He never called me on the road like that And he said I went in for that checkup And I got it And 30 days later he died And Meghan, my first And oldest daughter, was born About that same time And so in our house We felt in a way I've never really Felt before Winter and spring Death and new life The coldness of death And that warmth of new life And if this is you, maybe you're there And again, maybe you see That God's holding the brush Maybe you just move from Really eternal death to really eternal life Maybe you're recently saved And you see that he holds that brush And 2 Corinthians 5-17 Says, you know, if you're in Christ You're a new creation Old as God new has come You're on a new journey It's full of new beginnings And just like there's colors On every part of the canvas Everything experiences new creation Revelation 21-5 Behold, I make all things new And maybe you're newly married Maybe you have a new baby In your house Maybe you're coming out Of a recent loss of a loved one And you're in a period of a new beginning And Lamentations 3-23 Said his mercy says his mercies Awakened me each day And you also see, just like with the artist And the paintbrush and the colors on all the canvas If you look closely There's this movement There's this mystery of movement In new creation And Psalm 23-3 says He restores my soul Present tense He restores my soul Just like a car that's under restoration And they got to remove some of that old gunk On the metal Maybe that's going on in your life And that new, like a car that's restored We call it new It's not flawless But it's got a new beginning And if this is you I invite you to stand now And we want to pray for you If you're in spring Go ahead and stand And our posture here Would be Our faces lifted toward heaven In John 17-1 before Jesus prayed He lifted His face toward heaven And it's a way of saying God show me your face Light my way Lead me in this new beginning So let me pray for you as you look toward him God, I just pray for these people That they would seek your face Who you are in this new beginning And see what you have in store for them Open the eyes of their hearts as Paul writes You the one who fills all things full With their faces lifted Their eyes towards you God lead them In this new beginning In this new creation In this new season And now may the Lord bless you and keep you The Lord make His face To shine upon you And be gracious to you The Lord turn His face towards you And give you peace Amen Amen Well, hey, before we let you go this morning Just a couple of thoughts And we'll be done First of all, you may be sitting here Thinking, I should have stood up two seasons ago You were kind of waiting to kind of see where you would fall in And that's okay Maybe you kind of got it figured out And we would just invite you today To share that with somebody Somebody in your family Somebody who, you know, cares about you Tell them about what we talked about This morning And pray that same prayer Pray what we pray And you might be sitting here this morning I imagine there might be a few going Gee, a whole morning Devoted to this Absolutely Absolutely, you know, every once in a while So very important for us In leadership as we think about The privilege that God's given us To shepherd And care for this family Part of what we do is teach Part of what we do is lead But part of what we do is just Periodically take some time And try to, in a sense, put our arms Around each other And I sense that I know Mitch did as well today Sense him just kind of Putting his arms around some people And sensed us benefiting from the opportunity To think that through and to do that together I hope that I hope that your love for Each other Your real love for each other Would only be surpassed By your love for him And opportunities like this Give us a chance to express that In some kind of tangible way So thank you for letting us I have this time with you Thank you for the love and the support You express so often Toward us and please know how much We love you And I don't think I need to stand here and tell you I hope I don't But we are coming upon here in the next Next three weeks Some very important weeks Some very important times In the life of a believer In the life of this church And in kingdom life Easter's coming And the incredible privilege Is again ours To prepare our hearts and our minds The privilege The opportunity is again ours To begin thinking about Who it is that we might Want to invite to come and be apart Over these next few weeks And we've been doing that already And I hope you'll join us In giving some thought to these next few weeks We start next week a series Of courageous Christian And that all kind of culminates With the Easter on the 20th So be thinking about it Be praying about Who it is specifically And if God needs to kind of Boost you in the courageous category Come be a part of the next couple weeks And let's make the ask Let's make the invitation Let's see what God would do With a people Willing to be used of him Would you stand with me?
[time=3504] And let's pray In this room this morning So grateful for our time together So very appreciative of what it is That you've reminded Each of us of As we think about the seasons of life The seasons of the soul And God I pray that we would remember That whatever one we're in today It all might change Tomorrow But as Mitch said, God, you're a God That doesn't change You're the same You're the same God You'll be the same forever God, you are unchanging And in that we find Great comfort Be with us as we go Your son's name we pray Amen
