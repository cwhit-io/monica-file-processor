[time=30] [MUSIC - 170 seconds]
[time=230] >> Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Black Hawk, and as always, it's great to have you with us, and I'm so thankful that Mitch Cruz, one of our teaching pastors, is here with me today and Mitch is going to tell you a little bit about what you're about to see in today's broadcast.
[time=256] You know, in my life in the marketplace, the real risk with God, the real struggle was, will I courageously obey him when the whole world says it's not the thing to do?
[time=267] When every business class you've took, every customer that you've been around, every business guy you've been around, every marketplace information would say don't do it that way, but you know God's asking you to obey.
[time=279] Man, that's rough, and the message you're about to see is Kelly's take on how we can live a courageous faith, how we can take the risk to obey God, and how it always comes back, always comes back as blessing, and you're really going to be blessed by this message.
[time=295] Also, we wanted to let you know about this, and if you've watched the broadcast at all in the past, you know that we've never hesitated to extend this invitation, and we don't do it all the time, but we've got something coming up here that we really feel like.
[time=311] If you've been watching the broadcast, if this has kind of been in some way, maybe your church home, you sitting there in your living room, or in your bedroom, or wherever it is that you watch this.
[time=322] We want you to know that coming up, beginning on Sunday, June 22, is a three-week series, Sunday, June 22, and then the following three weeks, we're calling it three habits of highly destructive people.
[time=338] It's really a look at a passage in the book of 1 John, chapter 2, that talks about the struggles that we have, the difficulties that we encounter when it comes to pride, power, and pleasure.
[time=354] And even as I say those words to you today, even as you think about those words and their implications, you know, like Mitch knows, and like I know, those are deadly traps, those are roads that we can go down, and those are roads that can bring a lot of pain, and a lot of confusion, and a lot of heartache.
[time=372] And so we'd love for you to come in person, come and join us, go ahead and get in the car and make the drive, and join us as we look at these three habits of highly destructive people.
[time=384] And we believe God's got something for you in the midst of that study, and we'd love for you to join us, starting Sunday, June 22. We hope to see you then.
[time=414] [MUSIC]
[time=444] On a judgment day, he was dragged away. This world accused him of lies, full of power and grace, with an angel's face.
[time=466] He claimed Christ as Lord, and was sentenced to die, and as eternity stood, the stones throw away.
[time=479] Stephen's eyes met Jesus, and he began to pray. I will stand for you, because you died for me.
[time=495] I lay down my life for the world to see that your power is real, that your love is true.
[time=509] You died for me, Jesus you died for me, I'll stand for you.
[time=522] I'll stand for you.
[time=529] He showed all around, Christ was looking down. Stephen prayed a precious prize.
[time=542] He gave everything, every hope and dream, for the Lamb of God, the ultimate sacrifice, and as the heavens opened,
[time=558] I'm at a point in the day. Christ rose to his feet, and looked at Stephen to save.
[time=572] I will stand for you, because you died for me. I'll open the heavens for the world to see.
[time=585] That your time is real, that my love is true. You died for me, Stephen you died for me, I'll stand for you.
[time=602] The midst of all persecution, when it means that I must stand alone.
[time=615] If I'm worth dying for, you're worth living for. So I give you my heart, I give you my soul.
[time=629] Will you give, Jesus, your soul?
[time=635] Will you stand?
[time=661] I will stand for you, no matter the loss, I will stand for you, every day I live, everything that I have, everything that I give.
[time=675] I will stand for you, through the darkest night, through the hardest storm. I will be the light, I will stand for you.
[time=683] In all I do, I'll stand for you, I will stand for you, cause you died for me.
[time=694] I'll lay down my life for the world to see, that your power is real, that your love is true.
[time=708] You died for me, Jesus, you died for me, I'll stand for you, I'll stand for you.
[time=726] I'll stand for you, Jesus, I'll stand for you, I'll stand for you.
[time=750] I had dinner with my mother last Tuesday, it's a challenge for us to get together.
[time=755] We are both so busy, she works hard, in fact you might say she lives for her job, she's on call 24/7, head nurse in the ER.
[time=766] Everybody loves Nancy, she's smart, she's funny, very easy to talk to, that's my mom on the surface anyway.
[time=778] What most people don't know is that she is also very lonely, and that she has some pretty serious hang ups, stuff that keeps her from getting close to anybody, including God.
[time=789] She puts up a pretty tough front though, in fact everyone who meets her admires how strong she is, if they only knew.
[time=798] She knows I know, she never could hide it from me, I know what it's like to feel weak and helpless.
[time=808] She also knows that I've started going to church, and that I believe in God now, but she doesn't want anything to do with my religion.
[time=817] I want so much for her to know that my faith in God is more than religion, it's more than going to church.
[time=825] I want her to know that Christ gives me the strength I need to get through my day, but she doesn't want anything to do with it, so I keep quiet.
[time=836] Well, there we were, about halfway through our salads when she started telling me about this guy from work.
[time=844] His divorce was finalized about a month ago, and he had just got custody of his son, well, Jason, the son, had been hit by a car that afternoon, and she explained that he was still in a coma.
[time=858] And then she started in on the extent of his injuries, as only a good nurse can do over dinner.
[time=867] Well, then she interrupted herself and looked me square in the eye and said, "How can you trust in a God that allows innocent children to suffer?
[time=877] Tell me, Stacy, how?" That question was rooted far deeper than mere sympathy for a little boy.
[time=888] Time stood still.
[time=891] My palms were clammy, my stomach was churning, my heart was pounding.
[time=896] Why was I so afraid to answer her?
[time=900] My mind was racing, but my mouth?
[time=908] And then breaking the silence, her cell phone rang.
[time=913] Of course, she took the call.
[time=915] It was a co-worker with a quick question, and well, then the waitress brought our dinner, and the next thing I know, we were off on some other tangent, laughing our way through the rest of the meal.
[time=925] I fell asleep that night, praying for my mom, and for myself.
[time=935] God, please give me the courage to speak.
[time=943] In my devotions the next morning, I began reading from the book of 2 Corinthians, chapter 11, where Paul wrote,
[time=954] "I have worked much harder, been imprisoned more frequently, been flogged more severely, and been exposed to death again and again.
[time=964] Five times I received from the Jews the 40 Lyches, minus one.
[time=968] Three times I was beaten with rods.
[time=971] Once I was stoned.
[time=973] Three times I was shipwrecked.
[time=975] I spent a night and a day in the open sea.
[time=978] I have been constantly on the move.
[time=981] I have been in danger from rivers, in danger from bandits, from my own countrymen, from Gentiles, in danger in the city, the country, at sea, and in danger from those I thought were my brothers.
[time=996] I have labored and toiled and have often gone without sleep.
[time=1000] I have known hunger and thirst and have often gone without food.
[time=1004] I have been cold and naked. Besides everything else, I face the daily pressure of my concerns for the churches.
[time=1012] When one is weak, I too feel his weakness.
[time=1016] If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness." Paul? Weakness?
[time=1024] I had never thought about Paul feeling weak.
[time=1027] Well, considering all he went through for his faith, God must have answered his prayers for boldness.
[time=1034] Paul was made strong in his weakness.
[time=1038] I got to thinking, if God could enable Paul to speak the truth to his friends, maybe he would do the same for me with my mom.
[time=1047] The ball was in my court. I knew I needed to call her, but I was still afraid.
[time=1053] Several days passed.
[time=1056] I got busy, you know, with the stuff of life, keeping appointments, getting the oil changed, putting in a little over time.
[time=1064] Oh, I hadn't forgotten. I was still praying, but before I knew it, Sunday came.
[time=1070] And once again, God got my attention.
[time=1074] The teacher of our class opened the lesson by reading a story, a true story, about a man in the Philippines.
[time=1082] Brother Michael stared at the handwritten words, "We have your nephew. If you surrender to us, we will return the boy to his parents."
[time=1091] The note was from the military leaders of the Communist Party. People have been threatened and persecuted for years by these terrorists.
[time=1099] Brother Michael traveled often into the mountains to preach to the terrorist groups. His eight-year-old nephew, Peter, would frequently go with him.
[time=1107] Peter was a special help to him in the children's meetings in the mountain villages.
[time=1112] As a result of their ministry, some of the soldiers had given their lives to Jesus Christ and had left the Communist organization.
[time=1120] And now, young Peter was held hostage.
[time=1124] Michael had counted the cost and was prepared to give his life for the gospel, but he was not prepared for this.
[time=1131] If Michael surrendered, he was certain they would both be killed. Still, he hesitated.
[time=1139] The boy's parents insisted that Michael ignore this order and continue his outreach.
[time=1145] As a result, eight-year-old Peter was killed good Friday, April 17, 1992.
[time=1153] He was tortured for three hours. His hands were tied with wire, and the terrorists struck him in the legs and head with an axe.
[time=1163] Finally, he was beheaded.
[time=1167] The abductors have warned the boy's parents and Michael that if they do not stop their ministry, they will return and torture them.
[time=1176] Despite the threat, Michael continues his work in the Philippines.
[time=1182] I sat quietly in my seat, fighting back the tears. What really gripped my heart was not only the sacrifice of that young life, but everything that led up to that deciding moment.
[time=1197] At first, I judged Michael. It was wrong. He should have given in to those heathens.
[time=1205] Then I stopped in my tracks. "Give in to the enemy. Give up when it hurts." No.
[time=1212] Brother Michael had hesitated. The last thing he wanted was to lose his nephew.
[time=1219] God must have given him the boost of courage he needed to remain faithful and obedient.
[time=1227] A young life was ended here on Earth, but lives now and forever in the presence of Jesus.
[time=1239] Brother Michael has no regrets. The young boy died for the cause of helping other people find hope in Christ.
[time=1250] I want to live my life with no regrets. I want to stand for what's right. I want to stand for the God of this universe.
[time=1261] And then I remembered another whose flesh was bruised, pierced, and bleeding.
[time=1268] Like that young boy in the Philippines, one who gave his life for the entire human race.
[time=1275] I think about what he went through for me. He is the ultimate model of courage and obedience.
[time=1284] Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane.
[time=1288] Along the way he said to them, "My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death."
[time=1294] Going a little further, he fell on his face to the ground and prayed, "My father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me.
[time=1305] Yet not my will, but your will be done."
[time=1312] Betrayed, mocked, spit upon, and in his own words overwhelmed with sorrow.
[time=1323] He suffered more than I could ever imagine. He prayed for relief, yet there was no relief. He remained obedient.
[time=1334] Why? Because he loved me, and he wanted to provide a way for me to be with him in heaven for all eternity.
[time=1345] Jesus gave his all for me. I can give him no less.
[time=1353] I will stand for him. Thank you, God.
[time=1359] For renewing my strength, that I need today to do what you've asked me to do.
[time=1369] I cannot, will not, let my fear stand in the way of doing what I know he wants me to do.
[time=1383] Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some unfinished business to take care of.
[time=1390] You see, a few days ago, someone asked me how I could possibly trust in this God.
[time=1400] I am going to call my mom.
[time=1407] Why don't you just bow your heads with me this morning and just in the quietness of your own heart.
[time=1418] As you think through what you just heard, and as you just kind of dwell on a little bit, what you just saw.
[time=1429] Why don't you just ask God?
[time=1433] He's listening. He's available.
[time=1436] And I would guess that he has some things for you and for me this morning.
[time=1440] And why don't you just ask God, just in the quietness of your own soul, to show you this morning, whatever he might need to show you, to bring conviction wherever it might need to be brought to open your eyes to maybe give new direction.
[time=1458] Maybe it's old direction. Maybe it's a path he's been asking you, prodding you and prompting you to walk down for days, weeks, months.
[time=1468] But you, like me sometimes, are simply too afraid of what might be, of what could be.
[time=1480] And maybe this morning he wants to, in just a special, supernatural way,
[time=1487] energize your heart and renew your strength.
[time=1492] Why don't you ask him for that?
[time=1505] Father, we come before you this morning having been powerfully reminded
[time=1513] of your great love for us and your desire that we would be a people today in this world.
[time=1521] Here in this culture, God, here in our own personal lives, God, you would long for us to be a people who would follow you no matter what.
[time=1531] To be a people who would represent you lovingly and boldly, God, that we could be that, God,
[time=1540] that you would patiently and faithfully continue to move us in that direction.
[time=1546] Teach us some things, Father, this morning, as we open your word, remind us of truth that would move us in that direction.
[time=1555] And God, thank you so very much for the opportunity to consider these truths in your son's name.
[time=1560] We pray. Amen.
[time=1564] Well, the Apostle Paul, as we just saw here on the screen, and as you heard that passage from Corinthians read,
[time=1571] the Apostle Paul showed it, most definitely, he had it.
[time=1577] Jesus himself, as you just saw and were reminded, he had it, he possessed it,
[time=1586] thousands upon countless thousands of everyday people like you and me,
[time=1592] from those early first-century Christian martyrs to little eight-year-olds in the Philippines,
[time=1599] had it, showed it, possessed it.
[time=1604] What's it?
[time=1606] What's the it that we're referring to there?
[time=1609] Well, simply said, people, courage, a courageous faith, a courageous faith,
[time=1620] a bravery, an appropriate boldness, not an anger necessarily.
[time=1628] We're not talking about some kind of hardcore attitude here.
[time=1632] We're talking about a loving, gentle, soft sense of strength and courage, a courageous faith.
[time=1643] You can write this down if you want this morning.
[time=1646] It's a definition I just scribbled down this morning, a willing, ready spirit.
[time=1651] You can write this down as kind of a working definition for our discussion today in the weeks to come about a courageous faith, a willing and ready spirit,
[time=1663] a willing and ready spirit to face one's fears.
[time=1666] You can write it down. Go ahead.
[time=1668] Stay with me on this, a willing and ready spirit to face one's fears, for the sake of another.
[time=1682] and their chance, the other persons, whoever that might be, whether that's your mom or whether
[time=1688] that's your friend at work or whether that's your neighbor who you know is in need.
[time=1693] I mean, whoever that might be, your willingness and my readiness of spirit to face our fears
[time=1701] for the sake of another and their chance to hear or be pointed toward the truth,
[time=1712] the life-changing, eternity-altering truth.
[time=1720] It's Paul. It's Jesus.
[time=1723] It's first-century martyrs and the thousands and thousands and thousands of martyrs since
[time=1729] saying, "I'll do this. I will. I'll do this. I'll go here."
[time=1737] If it means that they'll get to hear the truth, if it means that somebody might come to faith,
[time=1745] if it means that somebody's hopelessness might be lit with the light of Christ, it's them saying, "I'll do this. I'll go here. I'll face whatever I might have to face."
[time=1757] If it means that another might possibly come to faith.
[time=1766] You see, biblically, and I really want you to get a sense for this this morning, biblically,
[time=1772] again and again, a courageous faith is tied to the one thing he's left us here to do.
[time=1782] We see it all throughout the Scriptures that this courageousness of faith, this appropriate
[time=1788] boldness, this bravery that resides in those deeply devoted to following Christ.
[time=1795] It is again and again tied to this idea of giving oneself to the one thing that he's left
[time=1804] you and I here to do.
[time=1807] Then what's the one thing?
[time=1811] The one thing that he's left you and I here to do, and it has nothing to do with your
[time=1818] vocation and it has nothing to do with your talent or skill set.
[time=1825] It has nothing to do with where you live, it has nothing to do with what we drive, it has nothing to do
[time=1831] with where we vacation, it has nothing to do with what hangs on our walls.
[time=1839] There's one thing none of those things are bad, none of those things are evil.
[time=1843] In fact, oftentimes those things can help move us in wonderful ways toward accomplishing
[time=1849] the one thing that he's left us here to do.
[time=1852] This will be on the screen and I do want you to write this down.
[time=1855] The one thing he's left us to do, go ahead, just look at it there, to introduce and point others to the life-changing eternity-altering reality of a relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=1867] And I hope you'll just jot that down.
[time=1872] Again and again we see in the Scriptures, courageous faith being tied to the one thing
[time=1878] he's left us here to do.
[time=1880] And the one thing is right there, to introduce you and I get the privilege of being a part
[time=1886] of this, to introduce and point others to the life-changing.
[time=1891] Life-changing meaning life-changing now, meaning life-changing here, meaning right here in the every day of my life.
[time=1898] We get the privilege of helping people see that it's not just about where you go when you die, it's about living a life that's full of hope, it's about having peace, it's about
[time=1910] having real, true meaning.
[time=1914] And he allows you and I this incredible privilege of introducing and pointing others to the
[time=1920] life-changing now and eternity-altering reality, because yes, though he brings great meaning,
[time=1930] though he brings great comfort, though he brings great forgiveness to our life now, yes, he does in the end give us eternal life with him.
[time=1940] And we get to point others toward this.
[time=1942] We get to introduce others to the life-changing, eternity-altering reality of a relationship.
[time=1950] We're not introducing them to religion.
[time=1954] We're not introducing them to externals.
[time=1959] We're introducing them to a relationship with a living God.
[time=1967] Mm, excuse me, viewing every encounter as we say it around here.
[time=1973] You've probably written this down before.
[time=1975] You can write it down again if you're in the mood to write.
[time=1978] Viewing every encounter as a divine appointment, a divine appointment to point another toward
[time=1988] Christ.
[time=1989] It's the one thing, I don't care who you are, I don't care how old you are, I don't care where you work, I don't care how many kids you have, I don't care, I don't, you're here
[time=2000] if you know him today for one reason, to point others, to introduce and point others to the
[time=2011] life-changing, eternity-altering reality of a relationship with him.
[time=2016] Let's look at this and let's start with Paul.
[time=2021] Go to Philippians 1 real quick and I'm going to grab a drink of water here, thanks Dean.
[time=2030] Philippians, chapter 1, we're going to pick it up in verse, we'll pick it up in verse 12.
[time=2041] Let's look at Paul.
[time=2045] When the drama Sandra was mulling over this passage that we're finding for 2 Corinthians,
[time=2051] but let's go to Philippians, chapter 1.
[time=2055] Philippians, chapter 1, verse 12, let's look at the courageousness of this guy, his bravery
[time=2063] and how it was can now want you to see this again and again today, how it was connected to the one thing you and I have been left, you and I and Paul were left here to do.
[time=2073] It's chapter 1, verse 12, you see it there, it says, "Now I want you to know, Paul has
[time=2079] been imprisoned for his faith.
[time=2083] Paul's in jail, it's not free, it's a pretty ugly scene, but he says this, "Now I want you to know, brethren, that my circumstances, my adverse situation here, have turned out
[time=2096] for the greater progress of the gospel, so that my imprisonment," which turned out to
[time=2102] be, I think, about four years, "so that my imprisonment in the cause of Christ has become well known throughout the whole Praetorian Guard." This was an elite group of about 9,000 Roman soldiers.
[time=2116] He says it's all turned out real good.
[time=2120] My imprisonment, he says, "In the cause of Christ has become well known throughout the
[time=2126] whole Praetorian Guard and to everyone else, and that most of the brethren, trusting in the Lord, because of my imprisonment, have far more courage to speak the Word of God
[time=2137] without fear, some to be sure are preaching Christ even from envy and strife, but some
[time=2144] also from good will.
[time=2146] The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel, the former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition, rather than from pure motives, thinking to cause me distress in my imprisonment." You see what he's saying there?
[time=2162] I mean, he's in prison, and he's rejoicing in the fact that the gospel has become evident,
[time=2168] the gospel has even been embraced throughout the entire Praetorian Guard, and that others even are coming to faith, and it's happening because there are some who are professing the gospel, claiming and preaching and proclaiming the truth out of pure motives, and some are doing it out of ill motives, evil motives, almost to kind of put it in Paul's face.
[time=2189] Like there you are in prison, here we are, Paul says, "You know what, I could care less."
[time=2196] Look at 18, what then?
[time=2200] Translated into the vernacular of our day, who cares?
[time=2203] Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in this
[time=2210] I rejoice, yes, I will rejoice, for I know, verse 19, "This shall turn out from my deliverance."
[time=2220] And be careful there, when you see that phrase, "My deliverance," you think he's just talking about freedom from prison?
[time=2226] No.
[time=2227] "For I know that this shall turn out from my deliverance through your prayers and the
[time=2233] provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, according to my earnest expectation and hope that I
[time=2239] shall not be put to shame in anything, but that with all boldness Christ shall even now
[time=2245] as always be exalted in my body, whether by life deliverance from prison or by death."
[time=2256] Deliverance from this fallen world, for to me to live, for to me to live is Christ, and
[time=2265] to die is gain.
[time=2271] Go back a few to Acts.
[time=2273] Just thought of this again last night.
[time=2277] Look at Acts real quick, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, chapter 14, just before you get to the book of Romans.
[time=2287] Here's some more courage for you.
[time=2289] Here's some more bravery.
[time=2290] Here's some appropriate boldness being shown, and again, tied to the one thing that he left,
[time=2299] Paul, and you and me here to do.
[time=2303] Look at Acts 14.
[time=2304] I think it's in verse 19, there it is.
[time=2313] Paul has been preaching the gospel.
[time=2315] Paul has been answering the call.
[time=2317] Paul has been standing before people doing his very best to lovingly yet boldly proclaim
[time=2323] the truth about Jesus, and people by the hundreds are responding, and infuriates the Jewish
[time=2332] leaders and those who would see Paul and this message of grace as an intrusion, and so says
[time=2340] in 19, "But Jews came," Acts 14, 19, "but Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and having
[time=2346] one over the multitudes, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing
[time=2353] him to be dead." We've talked about this before, just be reminded briefly here this morning that these folks, they did a lot of these stonings back then.
[time=2364] They were pretty good at it, and they supposed him to be dead.
[time=2371] They knew a dead body when they saw one, and obviously the pain and the brutality that
[time=2377] had been inflicted on this guy was such that seasoned veterans said he's gone.
[time=2385] Get him out of here so they drag him, it says, "Out of the city, supposing him to be dead,
[time=2392] but while the disciples stood around him," wow, "but while the disciples stood around
[time=2398] him, he arose." You see this sentence?
[time=2402] It's almost like hard to read.
[time=2403] He arose, and what?
[time=2408] Entered the city.
[time=2415] He arose, and he went back in, "You've got to be kidding me."
[time=2425] He arose, it says, and entered the city.
[time=2431] And the next day hung up his apostles' cloak, put away his sandals, hopped a ship to Italy
[time=2439] and was gone, no.
[time=2442] And the next day, he went away with Barnabas to Derby, and after they had preached the gospel to that city and had made many disciples, they had returned to Lystra and to Iconium
[time=2452] and to Antioch, strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue
[time=2458] in the faith and saying, "For many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God."
[time=2468] Left for dead in a pile of rock outside a city, in prison there at Philippi where there's
[time=2475] life on the line, he embraces and proclaims his faith, his courage tied to one thing.
[time=2485] One thing, and let's just remind each other, let's just take a minute here, and remind
[time=2494] each other, those of us here in this room, that it is the one thing.
[time=2499] If you know him this morning, it's the one thing he's left you here to do, it's the one
[time=2509] thing, how you doing?
[time=2516] How courageous is your faith today?
[time=2525] The one thing he's left you here to do, how you doing?
[time=2530] How courageous is your faith?
[time=2535] How brave and appropriately bold are you in living out and sharing in real ways, in loving
[time=2543] ways, your faith?
[time=2546] Are you facing your fears with conviction and courage as you befriend a neighbor?
[time=2552] I'm just going to say these real slow, so we just, we don't miss a one.
[time=2564] Are you expressing courage and conviction as you befriend a neighbor or further the discussion
[time=2574] with a friend who you know deep in your heart, you've got a sense, they'd go there.
[time=2583] They talk about it.
[time=2586] They'd ask some questions, you know, if the discussion could just get furthered, even a
[time=2593] little bit.
[time=2595] Are you facing your fears with conviction and courage as you befriend a neighbor?
[time=2604] As you further the discussion with a friend or as you extend a simple invitation, we've
[time=2615] said it again and again and it's true.
[time=2618] We see it all the time around here, if you ask, more than likely they will come.
[time=2628] Hey, would you like to go to church with me?
[time=2634] I'd love for you to meet some of my friends and see what's going on, it's a wonderful
[time=2640] place, great people, decent teaching.
[time=2649] I'm asking you and you've got to ask me, are you, are you facing your fears with courage
[time=2660] and conviction as you befriend a neighbor, further the discussion with a friend or extend
[time=2667] the invitation, do you get up every day begging God to stir your redemptive heart?
[time=2674] You go to bed at night begging Him to bring the divine encounters along the way and the
[time=2680] wisdom to point them toward faith.
[time=2683] It's the one thing He left you and Paul here to do.
[time=2689] He did it with courage in prison.
[time=2693] How are you doing in utter luxury and freedom?
[time=2701] How courageous is your faith?
[time=2703] What about Jesus Himself?
[time=2705] Look with me if you would in Matthew 27.
[time=2707] Go back to the first book there in your New Testament, Matthew, chapter 27, Matthew 27,
[time=2719] I believe verse 27, there it is, then the soldiers, then the soldiers of the governor
[time=2729] took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole Roman cohort around him, cohort.
[time=2736] At that time would have been about a hundred soldiers, kind of a special envoy of guys, dedicated to one thing, that being pain and torture.
[time=2744] And they stripped him, it says in verse 28, and put a scarlet robe on him.
[time=2748] And after weaving a crown of forms, they put it on his head and a reed in his right hand and they kneeled down before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews."
[time=2760] And they spat on him and took the reed and began to beat him on the head.
[time=2766] And after they had mocked him, they took his robe off and put his garments on him and led him away to crucify him.
[time=2777] Jesus in his courage, how does his courageous faith connect to the gospel, to the one thing
[time=2785] he's left, you and I here to do, the privilege of sharing and living out our faith on the
[time=2792] answer is obvious, but it's worth noting, and let's do that.
[time=2799] Him courageously facing his fear, his brave faith gave us something to share.
[time=2806] We realize that, right?
[time=2808] You make that connection, right?
[time=2812] His courage and its connection to the one thing he's left us to do is blatantly clear.
[time=2819] Him going through what he did, him courageously facing his fear gives us something to share.
[time=2826] If he bails on the cross, not only are we left hopeless, but we've got no message to share.
[time=2832] We've got no truth to offer, we've got no answer to a fallen world.
[time=2840] If he doesn't endure the cross, there is no gospel.
[time=2842] Sin wins and the enemy prevails and we spend eternity in destruction, darkness and pain.
[time=2849] But he didn't.
[time=2851] He didn't bail.
[time=2854] He doesn't bail.
[time=2854] He steps up.
[time=2856] He's courageous so that we could live.
[time=2859] He's courageous so that we could do the one thing he left us here to do with courage.
[time=2869] He exercises courage in the face of torture, shame and death so that we can live courageously
[time=2876] in the face of people who might not like us.
[time=2886] People who might disagree with you, I'm just talking from my own heart here.
[time=2893] I'm just telling you why I keep my mouth shut too many times.
[time=2899] What because they might think less of me?
[time=2904] My answer might not impress them.
[time=2908] I might be viewed as he exercises courage in the face of torture, shame and death so that
[time=2916] we can live courageously in the face of whatever it is you might face, whoever it is you might
[time=2927] encounter, whatever opinions they may possess.
[time=2935] Some of you, many of you maybe even are sitting in this morning and you say, "Okay, Kelly, it's all true." It's a powerful reminder of the courage and bravery and perspective and vision that this
[time=2954] incredible guy named the Apostle Paul, probably the Christian of all Christians, one of the
[time=2960] greatest church leaders, church planners of the world.
[time=2965] But whatever, you're right, he was all that and he did it because of the one thing that
[time=2972] we've been left here to do and yes, great reminder about Jesus, the Son of God, and you're
[time=2980] thinking, "You know, like I think sometimes, that's Paul and that's Jesus, God Himself
[time=2986] on the flesh, yeah, they're very, very courageous, but I'm just me, I'm just a normal everyday
[time=2995] guy, I'm just a mom with a couple of kids, I'm just a young professional trying to make
[time=3001] my way, you know, maybe you sit there and in some way do the disconnect and I just want
[time=3010] to remind you this morning of the thousands and thousands, the countless."
[time=3019] And I mean that, we can't count, I mean, we lost track centuries ago, the thousands
[time=3029] and thousands of martyrs that began in the first century with the courage of those first
[time=3037] century Christians and it has extended from the first century to this day.
[time=3044] And whether it's eight year old boys and their uncles in the Philippines, whether it was the first century, that early church, those folks we read about and we've studied in the
[time=3054] book of Acts, these first century Christ followers who in the face of utter torment and torture
[time=3061] and death and shame stood and said, "You know what, we won't keep quiet, we won't renounce
[time=3067] our faith." I was reading this week, it's a guy by the name of Eusebius, don't read him often, but
[time=3082] this opportunity called for it, he was a great church father, an early church historian.
[time=3089] And there's several of these guys whose writings have been preserved in Eusebius, I won't
[time=3095] quote him here, but as I read it, the gist of what he was saying was this that oftentimes these early first century believers whose faith in Christ and their realization of what
[time=3107] it said in Acts 1, 8, or it said, "You will be my witnesses, that's my plan, you're it."
[time=3113] And they took it so seriously and they were so grateful for the salvation that was theirs.
[time=3120] Eusebius says that oftentimes their capture and subsequent torture and eventual death would
[time=3126] come due to the fact that they would initiate spiritual discussion at the well, spiritual
[time=3133] discussion in the marketplace and on the street and what would happen is that eventually they would initiate spiritual, redemptive discussion with the wrong person who would turn them
[time=3145] in to eventually be beheaded, burned at the stake, dipped in tar used as human lamps, fed
[time=3154] to lions, cut in pieces, and upon their capture they would be said, point blank, stop opening
[time=3166] your mouth and renounce this Lord of yours and you're free.
[time=3173] So what'd they do?
[time=3185] You see for them for these faithful followers of Christ in these early days if the two choices were a safe silence or possible salvation for another, they just kept opening their mouths.
[time=3205] How about you?
[time=3208] And you know what?
[time=3209] I am in no way trying, I mean it's impossible.
[time=3214] I mean you're right, it's apples and oars, it's not the same situation.
[time=3219] I understand that and that makes the point even greater.
[time=3226] No one's going to behead me, no one's going to take me away from my family, no one's going
[time=3232] to torture you.
[time=3234] There's nothing on the line, I mean in comparison, in reality.
[time=3241] But I just leave us this morning with a question and I think it's going to come on the screen.
[time=3248] And I want to just ask you this as you leave, with whom are you choosing safety and silence?
[time=3255] For them if there were two choices, a safe silence or possible salvation for another,
[time=3261] they just kept opening their mouths.
[time=3267] With whom are you choosing safety and silence?
[time=3273] Can you identify, would you this morning, be willing to just scroll through the reality of your life and identify a situation where you're choosing a safe silence?
[time=3284] Somebody's eternity hangs in the balance.
[time=3288] Everyone you know living today without hope or real meaning.
[time=3293] And what am I going to do?
[time=3297] What are you going to do?
[time=3301] What are you going to choose and be real clear?
[time=3308] I am not, when I talk about opening your mouth, I am not talking about you or I, taking this
[time=3316] book and walking up to whoever that is and just boom, whacking them across the head and
[time=3323] saying I'm here to profess my faith.
[time=3326] No, no, no, no, we're talking about with sensitivity, with insight, hopefully in the context of
[time=3335] a relationship that you've worked hard to develop and a trust that's been engaged, talking
[time=3342] about you and I, being engaged in not only words, but maybe even just simple and small
[time=3349] acts of kindness, you and I reaching out to those in need.
[time=3354] What kind of need?
[time=3355] Well there's all kinds of need out there.
[time=3356] It might be physical, it might be emotional, it might be relational, I mean you and I being discerning enough and sensitive enough to what's happening in this individual's life and being willing to come alongside, yes with the truth but along with that the truth being
[time=3373] lived out in the things that you say, the things that you offer, the extent that you'll go to live out and share your faith and I know as well as you because regardless of what
[time=3391] you may think about me, there are moments, there are times in my day, there are situations
[time=3397] that I encounter that absolutely petrify me, they just, I'm terrified that what the next
[time=3406] step might be, how these words, this simple question I may want to ask, how that'll be received, but God calls me to face my fears with courage and conviction and to give myself
[time=3422] to the one thing He's left you and I here to do and I want to leave you with this and I want to invite you to come back next week because here's where we'll go.
[time=3432] You're either, you're doing one of two things, you and I, we're doing one of two things in
[time=3439] this endeavor, we're either building bridges, we're either building bridges or we're building
[time=3450] walls and I just want to encourage you to come back next week and let's talk about how
[time=3456] not to build walls, let's talk about how to build bridges, of courage and appropriate
[time=3462] boldness. Amen, why don't you stand, let's pray. Father, we stand before you this morning
[time=3477] and we just, we just recognize God our need to be a people that would be so completely
[time=3490] tied and connected to you that the things, the stuff of this place that sometimes in
[time=3499] such a deceptive way creates all this fear and uncertainty. God I pray that we would be
[time=3506] a people, those of us here in this room today that know you, that our life and our walk with you would be such that the reality of you, the presence of you in our lives and the comfort and the strength that that brings God would move us to a courageous and appropriate
[time=3522] boldness and those opportunities God that you bring our way, God that we would view
[time=3529] every single encounter as a divine appointment, a chance to point someone toward faith. God
[time=3537] hear our prayer, give us courage as we leave. In your son's name we pray, amen.
[time=3548] There is power here, on various goals, to set the cabin straight, let the broken home.
[time=3562] God is awesome, he's so awesome. God is awesome, he's so awesome.
[time=3573] God is awesome, he's so awesome.
[time=3603] God is awesome, he's so awesome, he's so awesome, he's awesome, he's awesome, he's
