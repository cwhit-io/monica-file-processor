[time=80] [MUSIC - 24 seconds]
[time=107] (gentle music)
[time=114] - This week, I've been thinking a lot about distraction and worship and how it's so easy sometimes to let worship music distract us in our focus of God.
[time=130] So many times, music can enhance that, but occasionally and sometimes more for others, music inhibits, I think.
[time=139] I remember a time in my life where I went to a church where I loved the teaching but always before the teaching when we would sing, there was this tension because the Lord blessed me with knowledge of music and the way they were doing music.
[time=153] It conflicted with my knowledge and so I didn't like it.
[time=157] (laughs) But you know, it came to the point where I got really frustrated and I talked with my fiance about it and then I said, "Tanya, I think we need to start going to the service after the music is over 'cause I can't take it anymore." And as soon as I said it, I wanted to take the words back because you know, it's not their job.
[time=180] I know it, it's my job and it's our job collectively to worship and to lead, but I think that there's a part of it that's your job 'cause there was a time that I had to discover that it was my job as I sat in that auditorium.
[time=196] It was my job to focus on the Lord.
[time=199] And instead of counting how many songs we sang or counting the number of phrases we sang or counting how many hymns were sung or counting all the stuff that didn't matter I needed to count the cost of Christ's death and his resurrection and the ability and the privilege that we have to sing to God, the enemy I was reading in Ezekiel 28 and it talks about how the enemy was responsible for music when he was still in heaven.
[time=233] And I just thought, wow, he knows a lot about music.
[time=237] He's been around before time was even created and he knows how to get under our skin with music and get us to focus on the things of music instead of focusing on God.
[time=250] So as we sing this again and sing, we praise you, Lord, and let your minds and your hearts be focused on who God is.
[time=259] Paul writes to the Philippians, "To our God and Father, be glory forever and ever."
[time=265] [AMEN] So let's give him glory now because we will forever and ever and he's worthy.
[time=272] Even if you don't sing with your heart, he's worthy.
[time=275] And the rocks will cry out if we neglect to sing his praises.
[time=278] So let's sing together.
[time=281] [MUSIC - 358 seconds]
[time=652] Lord, we have come here this morning to refocus, to fix our minds, to fix our hearts, and our wills, Lord, on you.
[time=664] We want them to be conformed and transformed completely to be like yours.
[time=672] You are God in heaven, and we are here on earth, and we long for the two to meet.
[time=679] And we ask, Lord, that you would teach us and grow us, as we strive every day to worship you not only in the songs we sing, but in the things we say and do.
[time=693] And Lord, we just ask that you would help us to be worshipers of you without distraction, and that we would be able to focus on you intently.
[time=703] You, the author, you, the perfecter of our faith.
[time=708] In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen.
[time=713] Well, thanks for inviting us over for dinner.
[time=719] Your sloppy joes were terrific, Jan.
[time=721] Thank you. Thank you.
[time=723] No one makes sloppy joes like my jam.
[time=725] Now would anyone care for another refreshing beverage?
[time=728] Or about some more check mix anymore, no thank you.
[time=730] Okay, well, what about now?
[time=732] Yeah.
[time=733] Maybe he gave him a parcheasy.
[time=734] Oh, hey, how about some password?
[time=735] There are four of us.
[time=736] Okay, twister.
[time=737] Well, actually, Dana and I were wondering if you two could help us out with something.
[time=741] Oh, sure.
[time=742] We'd love to, yeah.
[time=743] Come over here soon.
[time=744] Oh, yeah.
[time=745] We can hold for the church, right?
[time=746] Oh, yes, yes.
[time=747] We sure do.
[time=749] Don't pretend yourself.
[time=750] It has been that long.
[time=751] Ten years.
[time=752] Wow.
[time=753] We're not ashamed to say we're Christian.
[time=754] Oh, no, three.
[time=755] Bob, we are.
[time=756] Mm-hmm.
[time=757] Well, you see, Dana and I have never actually gone to church.
[time=760] In fact, we don't know very much about the Bible.
[time=763] Well, and we figured since you were both Christians, well, that you read the Bible.
[time=766] Oh, yes, yes.
[time=767] We do.
[time=768] We sure do.
[time=769] Yes.
[time=770] As a matter of fact, it's the foundation of our faith.
[time=772] It is.
[time=773] It is the B-I-B-L-E.
[time=775] Now, that's the book for me.
[time=777] For us.
[time=779] Oh, honestly, it's a song.
[time=781] We sing.
[time=784] Well, actually, you see, Dana and I were kind of curious about becoming Christians,
[time=790] and we wanted to see specifically if you could tell us a little bit about the Bible.
[time=795] Oh, and Bible, yes.
[time=797] The Bible.
[time=799] Hunter, would you like to start?
[time=800] No, I think you better start.
[time=801] You know, get the ball rolling for us.
[time=803] Okay, I'll get the ball rolling.
[time=804] Okay.
[time=805] All right.
[time=806] Well, the Bible.
[time=807] The Bible starts out with the book of genocide.
[time=808] What?
[time=809] Genesis.
[time=811] What did I say?
[time=812] You said genocide.
[time=814] Oh, I meant to say Genesis.
[time=815] Anyway, the book of Genesis, where God creates Adam and Eve and puts them in the garden of guest seminary.
[time=821] Right.
[time=823] I thought it was the garden of Eden.
[time=825] Okay.
[time=826] All right.
[time=827] Well, it was the garden of some sort.
[time=828] We know that for sure.
[time=829] Yes.
[time=830] That's right.
[time=831] Lots of gardens in the Bible.
[time=832] Any who, Adam and Eve used to spend their days just walking through the garden, eating fruit, and calling each other names.
[time=839] I thought that they named the animals.
[time=841] They did that too, I believe.
[time=844] They did that in their spare time.
[time=846] And sooner or later, Adam and Eve were kicked out of the garden.
[time=848] They were kicked.
[time=849] Yeah.
[time=850] Right out.
[time=851] They were so full of sin that God decided to destroy the world with water.
[time=855] Right.
[time=856] So, Noah had to build a big old ark made out of bull rushes.
[time=859] Big enough to hold all the animals in the entire world.
[time=862] Yeah.
[time=863] And then after the flood, the ark came to a resting spot on dry land.
[time=869] Yeah.
[time=870] And for the next 40 years, the children of Israel carried that ark around the wilderness.
[time=874] Period.
[time=875] It was nutty.
[time=876] It was crazy.
[time=877] Well, that seems almost impossible.
[time=879] Well, that's why they all died, honey.
[time=882] Yeah.
[time=884] They all died.
[time=885] They died.
[time=886] None of them were turned into pillars of salt and then were trampled by golden calves.
[time=889] Yeah.
[time=890] That was sad.
[time=891] Sad.
[time=892] Very sad.
[time=893] And that's when Moses came in and he and the children of Israel walked across the Red Sea.
[time=897] They walked across.
[time=898] Yeah.
[time=899] Well, I thought that Jesus walked on the water.
[time=902] Okay.
[time=903] Yeah.
[time=905] Yeah, Jesus walked on water too.
[time=906] In fact, in the Bible, everyone's walking on water.
[time=908] Right.
[time=909] It's like a hobby.
[time=910] It was like a little trend.
[time=911] It was a thing to do.
[time=912] Well, didn't Moses bring the Ten Commandments down from a mountain?
[time=914] You got right.
[time=915] Good.
[time=919] What are the Ten Commandments?
[time=920] The Ten Commandments.
[time=921] Okay.
[time=922] I think you should start.
[time=923] I'm drawing a blank.
[time=925] Okay.
[time=926] Ten Commandments.
[time=927] Okay.
[time=928] I've got some.
[time=929] Thou shalt not kill thy neighbor.
[time=930] Right.
[time=931] Thou shalt not steal thy neighbor.
[time=936] Thou shalt not kick thy neighbor's door.
[time=1867] Think about wealth this way for a minute.
[time=1869] The culture, the economic system that's put into place
[time=1877] on the planet, God didn't put there.
[time=1880] A fallen man has developed lots of different type methods
[time=1886] systems for creating wealth.
[time=1888] We don't create anything, but putting wealth together and then collecting it.
[time=1893] The system that we take advantage of is our system.
[time=1898] He didn't orchestrate that system.
[time=1901] As a matter of fact, in Revelation 18, if you want to take time and read it, it gets destroyed.
[time=1905] That system falls apart.
[time=1908] Matthew 544 and 45, let's look at that on the screen, but I tell you, you love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven.
[time=1918] He causes his son to rise on the evil and the good.
[time=1922] And sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.
[time=1926] In an agrarian economy, sun and rain are good things.
[time=1930] You need both, okay?
[time=1932] And he says, both groups of people get the sun and the rain.
[time=1937] I think there's one thing intrinsic in this question that we need to kind of explain just for a minute to wrap this up.
[time=1943] We have a tendency to think that getting rich is good, okay?
[time=1947] Wealth, folks.
[time=1949] He says it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a
[time=1955] needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.
[time=1960] Wealth is sometimes a real burden.
[time=1964] And so we need to get it in perspective and see it that way and understand that the system that's out there rewards the good and the bad both if they take advantage of the system that man has created.
[time=1978] Now, sometimes God gives wealth, too.
[time=1981] But remember, sometimes it's a real burden.
[time=1984] We have to figure out what to do with it when we have it.
[time=1988] Well, we're going to transition from kids' questions to questions that they're very common in something like this and that's about suffering.
[time=1995] And the first one is why do you let people suffer, especially old people?
[time=1999] Why don't you just take them, especially those in nursing homes that don't even know what is going on?
[time=2005] You know, he does.
[time=2008] He does take them.
[time=2010] And the suffering we see in Genesis 3, because of sin, we live in a fallen place.
[time=2020] Bad things happen to good people, good things happen to bad people and no one is deserving of the grace of God.
[time=2026] And so there's consequences.
[time=2028] We live in a place where there is suffering.
[time=2030] In John 1633, Jesus said in this life, you will have trouble.
[time=2034] It's that kind of place.
[time=2036] In Luke 13, Jesus says, hey, didn't these two bad things happen because people sinned, you know, a specific consequence for their sin?
[time=2045] Jesus says, no, it's a place where bad things happen.
[time=2048] Turn to God.
[time=2051] And for me, Philippians 4, 13, I've seen totally differently.
[time=2055] Paul writes, I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength.
[time=2059] And I used to think, well, I can do anything, you know?
[time=2062] I can do anything with him.
[time=2063] I'll do it all.
[time=2064] I'll conquer the world.
[time=2065] And really, I'm lifting that verse out of a passage about contentment.
[time=2069] And the way I see that now is, I can grow in my intimacy with Christ.
[time=2073] What are things around me are good or whether they're bad.
[time=2076] You know, whether it's just great or whether I'm suffering.
[time=2079] And when I've suffered, there's been a particular passage that's been of comfort to me.
[time=2083] And that's Romans 5, 3 through 5.
[time=2086] And not only this, but we also exalt in our tribulations or suffering
[time=2092] in the NIV.
[time=2093] Knowing that tribulation or suffering brings about perseverance.
[time=2097] And perseverance, proven character, and proven character hope.
[time=2101] Hope is confident assurance.
[time=2103] It's not wishful thinking.
[time=2104] It's being sure.
[time=2105] And so far in these verses, you would equate this to working out.
[time=2108] You'd equate it to anything, but we don't like spiritual working out, right?
[time=2113] And hope does not disappoint us because it's a confident assurance.
[time=2116] It's absolute truth.
[time=2117] Because the love of God, there it is, has been poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who was given to us.
[time=2124] See, I can grow in my intimacy with God, who has a believer is in me.
[time=2129] And I can love Him, and He can love me, and I can know Him, and He can know me.
[time=2133] And I can grow in my intimacy with Him, because I can take everything to Him in prayer, whether it's good or bad.
[time=2139] This was a tough one.
[time=2145] And I'll just let you see it there on the screen.
[time=2152] And this was a hard one for us to wrestle with.
[time=2156] And we just want you to know that.
[time=2159] You know, it's one thing for you and I to sit here and talk about when things go wrong for us.
[time=2165] It's one thing for Mitch to talk about, and for God's word to address, proven character and perseverance and hope, and I'm not making light of that.
[time=2173] That's a real progression, you know, when I face difficulties.
[time=2181] It seems like, it feels like, I don't know that it is, but as we talked about it this week, this, right here, you know, this feels like a completely different category.
[time=2192] And it's not really a completely different category.
[time=2195] It's just for us, in our minds, in the way we view stuff, we look at a helpless child, and we almost feel like somehow
[time=2205] a line's been crossed, and now this just isn't right.
[time=2208] And so I just want to admit to you that as we think through this question, you know, there was some wrestling going on.
[time=2216] And as you wrestle with this question, when you think about the unspeakable acts of evil that take place in this world against those who have absolutely no defense,
[time=2228] you've got to know, you've got to be reminded today, and please, if somehow, maybe you're starting to question this.
[time=2235] Maybe this morning you can be reminded or encouraged again to know that it breaks his heart, and that the degree of love that he has for them,
[time=2247] you have no comprehension, we have no idea, we can't even fathom the love
[time=2253] that he has for those, for you and for me, but for them as well.
[time=2258] You can't even begin to understand how much he loves them.
[time=2263] And we also know that the day will come.
[time=2266] And I know you're sitting there saying, and I'm sitting there thinking, "You know what? Well, the day should come now because this just isn't right." But what we know is that he has determined that a day will come, and it will all be over.
[time=2280] And justice will prevail, and his hand of love and grace will reach out.
[time=2285] I mean, his hand of love and his hand of grace is touch of mercy and comfort.
[time=2290] It comes now in ways that are mind-boggling.
[time=2294] I'll show you that in just a second here in Psalm 34.
[time=2297] But a day will come, and wicked, evil doers will be dealt with.
[time=2304] And those circumstances, these circumstances will no longer take place.
[time=2309] And in the meantime, he remains a God of integrity who allowed way back here at the beginning for there to be choice, and it's not gone so well.
[time=2320] And as that plays itself out, we, the people of God, have the opportunity to extend a hand.
[time=2326] We have the opportunity to extend our hearts.
[time=2329] We have the opportunity to come alongside parents and help them think through issues.
[time=2332] We have all kinds of things that we can try our best with his strength to do.
[time=2336] But you and I know in the end, Psalms still suffer.
[time=2342] And be reminded today of what's available to them.
[time=2346] Be reminded today of what is true.
[time=2348] It says in Psalm 34.
[time=2349] I don't think this one will be up there, so you might want to just look with me.
[time=2352] Look at Psalm 34.
[time=2355] It says in Psalm 34.
[time=2361] Pick it up in verse 15.
[time=2368] And his ears are open.
[time=2370] They're not shut to their cry.
[time=2372] The face of the Lord is against evil doers to cut off the memory of them from the earth.
[time=2377] The righteous cry and the Lord hears.
[time=2380] He does hear those cries.
[time=2382] And he delivers them out of their troubles.
[time=2385] The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.
[time=2390] Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivers him out of them all.
[time=2395] He keeps all his bones.
[time=2397] Not one of them is broken.
[time=2400] Really broken.
[time=2403] See that phrase right there reminds me that so many times we view suffering and we view abuse
[time=2409] and we view the stuff that goes on.
[time=2411] And in our finite minds, we put boxes around that and say that.
[time=2415] Well, that is what we don't understand fully is what's coming.
[time=2421] But we don't understand fully is the grace, the mercy, the love, the comfort, the peace that is to come and what that will do and what that will bring.
[time=2431] Let me just say this to you.
[time=2432] We'd love to just do this if we could.
[time=2435] In a room this size, you know, with this many people, there may be many in here today.
[time=2442] And you know about this all too well.
[time=2447] You may know a grandson or a granddaughter who has experienced this.
[time=2452] You may know a niece or a nephew.
[time=2454] There may have been one of your own who in some way through some circumstance had to
[time=2461] endure or experience this.
[time=2465] You know what?
[time=2466] Maybe it's you.
[time=2467] Maybe you've endured this.
[time=2471] Maybe you sometimes need a reminder of how much he loves you even though the fallenness
[time=2478] of this world has confused that picture.
[time=2481] Would you just bow your heads all of you?
[time=2483] Could we just as a family kind of take a minute and just reach out?
[time=2487] Would you bow your heads and would you just close your eyes and would you just pray?
[time=2492] Pray with us here.
[time=2494] Father God, we come before you this morning and we know that right here in this room here sitting in these seats are people.
[time=2503] Maybe young, maybe middle-aged, even old, or who in some form or fashion have experienced
[time=2511] firsthand the depravity and the wickedness of this world.
[time=2517] And God, we know that it hurts and we know that it confuses and we know that the violation brings with it a handful of issues.
[time=2527] But God, we also know that you and your great love and the great peace and comfort that relationship with you brings.
[time=2534] God, we know that it is above and beyond anything that this world can dish out and so
[time=2542] Father today right here in this moment.
[time=2544] We would just come together as a family and we would just pray, God, that your hand, your hand of comfort and your hand of peace, the hand that removes shame.
[time=2554] God, the hand that eases guilt.
[time=2556] God, the hand that comes and brings fresh perspective.
[time=2559] God, that your hand would be on these hearts and souls.
[time=2562] Anybody here in this room who has experienced this and we look forward, God,
[time=2568] collectively to the day when it will be no more.
[time=2574] Thank you for the opportunity just to do this, to bring those hurting before you,
[time=2580] knowing God, your love and your care and your grace and mercy.
[time=2584] We ask it all in your son's name, amen.
[time=2586] [AMEN] Why did I have to go through life with no dad?
[time=2592] Somebody wrote.
[time=2594] And when I read that I thought, man, I wish they could have had mine.
[time=2599] I had a really good dad and I wish everybody could have had the experience of having him
[time=2606] come home after hard day's work and love you.
[time=2610] Love you enough to whip you when you need it whipped and hug you when you need it hugged.
[time=2615] And I just hate it that people have to suffer, not having a dad or a mom.
[time=2622] And I've been around it, but I haven't really ever endured it.
[time=2628] My wife was in the womb of her mother when her dad died.
[time=2633] He had a heart attack.
[time=2635] And so she didn't have a dad all those growing up years and she's talked to me about that
[time=2641] and I hear about that.
[time=2643] She even had a dream last night.
[time=2644] She didn't know this was one of my questions.
[time=2646] Last night she dreamed that my dad came to her and just held her and loved her and hugged her.
[time=2654] And she was telling me about that this morning.
[time=2656] I said, "Wow, it's one of my questions." My kids have, you know, their mom died too young from our perspective.
[time=2667] And so I relate to it even though I haven't really endured it myself.
[time=2672] And it seems like such a trite answer to go to James 1 for things so often like this.
[time=2677] But I think if we really look at it, we'll understand something that is true.
[time=2682] It says, "Consider it pure joy, my brothers.
[time=2685] Consider it pure joy, okay?
[time=2687] It's not joyful.
[time=2689] Consider it that.
[time=2691] Consider it pure joy, my brothers.
[time=2693] Whenever you face trials of many kinds, not having a dad is a big trial.
[time=2697] Because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance.
[time=2703] He wants you to persevere because later in that passage it says you will become mature.
[time=2709] And I hate it that you don't have a dad, but I'd say this.
[time=2713] He said, "I'll be a father to the fatherless." And you can hang on to him.
[time=2718] And if you hang on to him and you persevere, you'll become mature.
[time=2723] That's a promise.
[time=2726] And if there's anybody in this room who thinks that hanging on to him is some nebulous weird thing
[time=2732] that we just kind of throw out lightly and how in the world could that ever bring any sense of solidarity and we'll just talk to us.
[time=2740] You just talk to us.
[time=2742] Because what Steve said, there's really, really true.
[time=2744] He is the father to the fatherless and that is not a nebulous out there kind of ethereal thing.
[time=2749] It's a very, very real thing.
[time=2752] And if you need some help with that, let us know.
[time=2755] Mitch, will we move from questions of suffering to questions about salvation.
[time=2760] About being saved, having an eternal relationship with God, going to heaven.
[time=2766] And the first one is, "How do we know we are saved if we can't do anything to earn your forgiveness?"
[time=2773] And that's right.
[time=2774] How could I earn forgiveness?
[time=2777] The only forgiveness that's available for sin is at the cross of Jesus Christ in Jesus Christ.
[time=2783] His life, His death, His resurrection.
[time=2786] And all I can do is ask for mercy and grace to fill that gap that I can never fill.
[time=2792] And this question in similar fashion was asked to me by a very bright girl, I know.
[time=2797] Really bright.
[time=2798] Really smart.
[time=2799] Saved girl.
[time=2800] And she said, "You know, Mitch, on this side of heaven, I may never know if I'm there on the other side."
[time=2807] And I could not disagree more.
[time=2810] 1 John 5, 13 says, "I write these things to you." John says, "I write these things to you, Church, who believe in the name of the Son of God, who believe, commit with your whole heart to the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life,
[time=2826] so that you may know that you have eternal life." And the two verses He says before that.
[time=2831] And this is a testimony God has given us eternal life.
[time=2835] And this life is in His Son.
[time=2838] It's Christ who has the Son, He who has the Son has life, zoe, spiritual, eternal, and abundant life.
[time=2848] And He who does not have the Son of God does not have life.
[time=2853] Jesus says in Matthew 10, and it kind of goes to the second question, "Is there a time when you revoke your grace to an unrepentant sinner?"
[time=2864] And Jesus says in Matthew 10, "If you're ashamed of Me here, if you're not going to have the Son,
[time=2872] I'm ashamed of you at judgment.
[time=2874] It's just that simple." He says in Mark 3, I believe, Matthew 12, Luke 12 talks about blasphemy or rejection of the Holy Spirit of God's work in Me
[time=2883] to draw Me to Himself.
[time=2884] I stop that.
[time=2885] My proud heart stops that.
[time=2889] Then at death if you want to look at Hebrews 9, 27, I think it's going to come on the screen.
[time=2894] And in as much as it is appointed for men to die once and after this comes judgment.
[time=2900] So that's the deal.
[time=2902] You got this side.
[time=2903] And if that's you today, when you can't say today that I have life in Christ,
[time=2909] I just beg and plead that you either talk to the person who you came with or you talk to one of us or anybody
[time=2916] and you accept and fully surrender your heart to His work in you so you can have life eternal
[time=2924] and life abundant now.
[time=2930] I kind of felt for the one that wrote this and I want to just do it this way.
[time=2935] This person writes, "Why if I'm saved and know that heaven is my soul's destination, am I still burdened
[time=2942] by a fear of death?" And I just, boy, when I read that I said, you know, I'll take that one because, and let's just do this.
[time=2949] You know what?
[time=2950] And I hope that person's here.
[time=2951] Anybody in the room here today, especially those of you that know him and you too know your soul's eternal
[time=2958] destination, if periodically you sometimes get a little bit afraid of what dying might be like.
[time=2965] Would you raise your hand?
[time=2966] Okay, keep them up because I just want this person to look around and see that he or she is not alone.
[time=2973] Thanks.
[time=2975] That's just part of it, you know.
[time=2977] It's just, until we get there, there's going to be this humanness.
[time=2981] There's going to be this human side of us.
[time=2983] And all the truth that we grasp and all the things that we believe to be right and what we know are souls,
[time=2990] eternal destination to be.
[time=2991] I mean, all of that we can embrace and hold tightly to in our humanness.
[time=2995] I believe there will be times when some things will seem a bit confusing or some things might even seem a bit scary.
[time=3001] What we know is that he gives grace and he gives his comfort and he offers peace at the time of need.
[time=3008] And I've been around some people who have seen a little bit more life than I have.
[time=3012] And I've also noticed that the more and more life goes on.
[time=3016] I sense in them.
[time=3019] I see and I sense in them a peace and a calmness that comes.
[time=3023] I think it's partly just through the years seeing God's hand, through the years watching God work,
[time=3030] as time goes by that confidence and that trust in him just develops and grows.
[time=3034] And I know right now in my life there's times where it scares me.
[time=3038] And so don't feel like you're the only one out there who wonders really what's that going to be like.
[time=3044] And be careful with what you hear in the movies and be careful with what you read in books
[time=3050] and don't go too far with the white light and being up in the corner of the room stuff.
[time=3054] It's going to be okay and he gives grace and comfort in our time of need.
[time=3061] Amen?
[time=3062] [AMEN] Next, since divorce is sinful and hated by you, why is it so common in the church?
[time=3071] There was a period of time in the United States when culturally it was unacceptable.
[time=3082] Even up until I was a child, it just didn't happen all that much.
[time=3087] And what's happened over the course of time in our country is the same thing that happened
[time=3093] in every other civilization in the past.
[time=3096] If you build a society on some principles that are gods,
[time=3102] you live like he wants you to live and there are some pressures that you feel that keep you from doing some things that he doesn't want you to do.
[time=3112] And as that has eroded over the course of the last 200 plus years,
[time=3118] we are more quickly willing to accept divorce.
[time=3123] It's that simple.
[time=3124] It's happened all around our culture, small towns, large towns out in the country and in church.
[time=3130] It's happened.
[time=3131] Let's look at what Jesus has to say about it.
[time=3135] In Matthew 5, he says it has been said, "Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce." But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife except for marital unfaithfulness
[time=3147] causes her to become an adulterous and anyone who marries the divorced woman commits adultery.
[time=3152] Strong words.
[time=3154] Okay?
[time=3155] In 1 Corinthians 7, Paul says that we also have another option.
[time=3162] When somebody leaves you, if the unbelieving spouse leaves you, you're then free to remarry.
[time=3167] Okay?
[time=3168] So we got those two conditions.
[time=3169] But other than that, he says, "I hate it.
[time=3171] Don't do it." Okay?
[time=3173] Even with that, he doesn't say you have to do it.
[time=3176] He loves for people to stay together in their marriage.
[time=3180] He wants that.
[time=3182] What we want to say to you is don't let it go so far before you go get some help.
[time=3191] Real early, husbands and wives, if you're starting to have these lustful thoughts, men,
[time=3199] go to somebody and tell them the truth about that.
[time=3202] Don't wait until some lustful thought has come to fruition and say, "Help me."
[time=3209] Come here quickly.
[time=3210] If we can't help you, we can send you to somebody who really knows some good answers.
[time=3214] And they're in here, along with the training that some people have had.
[time=3218] And you can get some help.
[time=3220] Don't let it go down the pike at all.
[time=3223] Do it really early.
[time=3225] We want to help.
[time=3226] God wants you to stay together with your spouse.
[time=3230] He wants that.
[time=3233] Next question is, "According to your word, how should people be treated on their job?"
[time=3239] And I've looked at the Bible through these eyes because of owning my business and having employees.
[time=3244] What are the employer-employee relationships?
[time=3246] What do they look like?
[time=3247] What should they look like according to God?
[time=3249] And I'm just sharing with you a little part of that from Proverbs 18.
[time=3254] It's Proverbs 18, it's every other verse, 13, 15, 17, and this helped me immensely.
[time=3259] And Proverbs 18, 13 says, "Listen before you answer." I can't tell you how many times I've made a mistake of not listening before I answered and how grateful I've been to listening to the entire story before I answered.
[time=3272] See, people know when you haven't heard it all.
[time=3274] And so whatever you say and advice, they're going to discount because we know you haven't heard the entire story.
[time=3280] Proverbs 18, 13, listen before you answer.
[time=3283] Proverbs 18, 15 says, "Discerned." Listen to what's being said and discern.
[time=3289] My dad would say it this way, "What else is going on?
[time=3292] What are they really saying?
[time=3294] You know, read between the lines.
[time=3296] What are they saying from their heart?
[time=3298] What's the big issue?" And then Proverbs 18, 17 says, "Oh, please do this.
[time=3306] Get both sides of the story before making any decision." Because Proverbs 18, 17 says, "The first one comes to you and tells you that story." Man, that sounds right.
[time=3316] That sounds right.
[time=3317] You've been there, right?
[time=3318] And I've been there.
[time=3319] And you're almost ready to make judgment on that call.
[time=3321] And then you're, "Oh, I would remember Proverbs 18, 17.
[time=3324] I better go listen and see what the other side of that story is." And it's been so helpful to me.
[time=3330] So listen, discern, and get both sides of the story before making any decision.
[time=3335] Well, I said, "Hey, we're going to end it here and come back next week and pick this up."
[time=3343] Why don't you just stand right where you're at?
[time=3346] And as you're standing, I'll just tell you this.
[time=3348] The next question we're going to deal with is somebody asking us to explain about election.
[time=3354] And so we'll come back next week and talk about what happens in November with Republicans and Democrats and voting booths and all that stuff.
[time=3362] We're happy to give our insights.
[time=3365] But no, we'll come back next week and talk about election and predestination and free will and those things.
[time=3372] And we'd love for you to come back and join us.
[time=3374] I want to just say one last thing on the marriage thing, on the divorce thing.
[time=3378] Please, don't miss this.
[time=3380] The way Steve answered that was just crystal clear.
[time=3384] And what we saw in God's Word again reminds us that it reminds us that,
[time=3390] "Well, we're just not getting along." Or, "You know, we never should have gotten married."
[time=3399] Or, "I just don't think it's God's will."
[time=3405] You know, the truth today reminds us that those excuses are not going to work
[time=3413] and that it is for you and I to kind of come together and do our very best
[time=3419] to live by what God's Word says because He's a good God.
[time=3422] And what He lays out there for us with His help is doable.
[time=3425] Now, listen, if you're getting beaten, if you're getting hit, slapped,
[time=3432] emotionally and are physically abused, if there are kids in that situation
[time=3440] who could be party to the same kind of treatment, then, you know, you come to us and what we do is we help you get out.
[time=3449] And I'm not saying we help you get a divorce necessarily right away.
[time=3453] We just do the right thing.
[time=3455] We use our minds that God gave us and we exercise discernment.
[time=3458] And so we want to make sure that while we hold up what God's Word says, and as we call you to that, we also want to make sure you understand that in those situations there's all kinds of things that take place.
[time=3469] And we want to take those on an individual basis and help you with wisdom as best we can, so consider that.
[time=3476] And if we can help in any way, please let us know.
[time=3478] Father, we leave this place reminded of the fact that life is at times confusing, but God, you, you are a constant.
[time=3485] And even though there are things about you that sometimes in our finite humanness, we can't fully comprehend, God, we look forward to the day when we'll get to.
[time=3493] And in the meantime, we live with your hand, your hand of grace,
[time=3499] your loving kind and compassionate and patient hand on our lives, and we ask God that you would keep growing us, that you would keep at it your work in our lives.
[time=3511] And God, for those here today, still trying to understand this faith relationship with you,
[time=3517] a life of full surrender, God, we pray, that you'd give us the privilege of coming alongside in whatever way we can.
[time=3524] God, I pray that friendships that exist where those conversations can happen.
[time=3529] God, I pray they would.
[time=3530] If we could be of help today, God let us bring us back again, together soon,
[time=3536] to further our understanding of you, to celebrate our relationship we have with each other,
[time=3542] keep us safe.
[time=3543] God, bring us back together again soon in your son's name we pray.
[time=3546] [AMEN - 60 seconds]
