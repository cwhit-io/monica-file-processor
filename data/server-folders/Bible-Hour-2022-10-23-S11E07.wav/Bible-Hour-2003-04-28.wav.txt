[time=224] - Hi, I'm Kelly, senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=228] And thankful again for the chance to spend this time with you.
[time=231] I want you to know that what you're about to see today is the conclusion of a two-week series that we've done entitled "Glad You Asked".
[time=239] On Easter we passed out hundreds and hundreds of cards giving people the chance to ask God any question that they might have.
[time=247] And we've already heard from many of you in our viewing audience after last week.
[time=252] We know that the questions that are being asked and the answers that God's word provides.
[time=258] We know that you're hearing it. We know that you're listening to it.
[time=261] And from what many of you are saying, we believe it's meeting a need in your life.
[time=266] And we're so thankful for that. We hope today as questions continue to be asked, and as you listen to the answers from God's word, I hope your heart is encouraged.
[time=275] And I just want to tell you this. I see so many of you.
[time=279] I bump into you out and around this area.
[time=282] You're gracious and kind enough to stop and say thanks for what we do in bringing the broadcast.
[time=287] You email me, you send me notes, and it means so much to us.
[time=292] I want you to know this, that this is a place.
[time=295] And these are a people here at Black Hawk who would love nothing more than to be able to continue the process of helping you get answers, real answers to your questions.
[time=307] We know that in life there are many questions.
[time=310] We know that there are situations that you face and circumstances that you encounter.
[time=315] And we know that God's word and we know that the spirit of God and the people of God all come together to help bring clarity and to help provide direction for you and for me when we find ourselves in those situations.
[time=329] And so even though this has been a two-week series, I want you to know, it's a year-round deal here at Black Hawk.
[time=336] Us doing our very best with his help to encourage and come alongside seeking people, helping them know what it means to find and then follow Christ.
[time=345] And if you have a question, if you've got a need, if there's any way at all that we could be of help, come and be with us.
[time=352] Join us on a Sunday morning at 9.15 or 10.45, come down front afterwards, introduce yourself to me.
[time=358] And some of the folks on our team, and we'd love to just roll up our sleeves and walk through life together.
[time=364] Hope to see you soon. God bless.
[time=367] Well, we want to say welcome. We have been asking questions and trying to give answers.
[time=372] Okay, are we all here?
[time=373] In the weeks that have...
[time=375] This is an auditorium, commonly referred to as a thanks-to-weary look-up.
[time=380] Okay.
[time=381] We're walking.
[time=383] Let's stay together, folks.
[time=385] Everyone here?
[time=386] Cool.
[time=387] Well, as you can see, we're now standing in the sanctuary of a large Christian church.
[time=393] Chrikey, it's enormous.
[time=395] You must cost a fortune to heat this place.
[time=398] Nance.
[time=399] See those TV cameras?
[time=401] You know what that means, don't you?
[time=403] Tele-evangelists.
[time=405] Really?
[time=406] Where?
[time=407] Oh my!
[time=408] It looks like an actual church service is in progress.
[time=412] Hey, you guys.
[time=413] How are you?
[time=414] Can we help you out here with anything?
[time=416] Oh, goodness.
[time=417] No.
[time=418] You just go right on with your church meeting.
[time=420] Just act like we're not even here, okay?
[time=422] Yeah.
[time=423] Excuse me, but aren't we going to interrupt their church service?
[time=426] Good question.
[time=427] But no.
[time=428] They're used to this sort of thing.
[time=430] Let's go ahead and move up onto the stage here and let's use our inside voices.
[time=436] Good.
[time=437] Watch your step.
[time=439] Squeeze it down now.
[time=441] I'm sick of walking.
[time=443] Are all churches this large?
[time=447] Good question.
[time=448] But no.
[time=449] This is one of the larger churches in this city.
[time=452] This church started in 1969 and has a current membership of about 1600.
[time=459] Well, why does this one have so many members?
[time=462] Good question.
[time=463] Well, to be blunt, many of them come because they have no life.
[time=469] In fact, one side actually overheard some of them talking and they said how they could
[time=475] think of anything they'd rather do on a Sunday morning.
[time=478] And well, as for the rest of them, I heard they all have major problems.
[time=483] So they come here because they need a crutch.
[time=486] Now, please, don't stare.
[time=489] Oh.
[time=490] What does it cost to be a member of a church like this?
[time=494] Good question.
[time=496] Well, typically it's very expensive.
[time=499] From what I understand, Christians operate under sort of a covenant where they must give
[time=506] 75% of everything they own to the church.
[time=510] Seventy-five.
[time=511] You've got to be kidding me.
[time=513] Like that.
[time=514] Whatever happened.
[time=515] We never signed anything over when we used to go to church.
[time=518] Did we dare?
[time=519] No.
[time=520] We used to go to church.
[time=522] You were a lozier mind. Now, you often hear Christians talk about the good news? Well, do you know what that is? No, no. The good news is, once a Christian is baptized, they allow them to pay their membership dues in weekly installments.
[time=543] What does baptized mean? Baptized. Baptized is when they take and they hold you down under the water, then they don't let you up until you agree to pay that 75% thing. Hey!
[time=555] So, they have these gatherings weekly? Good question. And yes, typically they meet like this every Sunday morning and then there's usually some other sort of gathering during the week.
[time=569] Now, do the meetings have to be here? Or can they, you know, do church online? Sort of like a whole virtual Christianity type thing.
[time=578] Man, what's he talking about? Can we sit down now?
[time=582] Excuse me. Is there just one person here at this church? Good question. But no. There are three teaching pastors at this church.
[time=593] Oh, I think two of them are sitting right over there on that special bench called a pew.
[time=599] Now, if my guidebook is accurate, the one up here on stage is the senior pastor.
[time=606] Those guys are pastors? Should they be wearing a white collar or something? Good question. But no.
[time=613] This is what's known as a contemporary church. The preacher's trying to act like they're just normal people.
[time=620] So, they don't wear their collars in public.
[time=626] If I ain't trust a dope preacher, he ain't got a white collar on.
[time=631] Or at least the robe. Look at this one, Apple. I'm pretty strapping young fella.
[time=638] Maybe they couldn't find the robe big enough to feed him.
[time=643] Yeah. Looks like a cut. Corn fat into the other boys.
[time=652] Hey, mate. Hi. I'm just deep from Australia, the airbag, all that.
[time=657] Yeah, nice to have you here from Australia. What brings you to Fort Wayne?
[time=661] The weather. Yeah. Why? Right. Sorry about that.
[time=665] Hey, is this one of them there churches that handle snakes?
[time=667] Because I got a lot of experience with snakes and cross.
[time=671] What? No snakes. No snake handling. None of that stuff at all.
[time=675] Well, animal sacrifices. I just shopped. No, no animal sacrifices either.
[time=680] Please, sir. Stay with the group. You don't want to miss the group.
[time=683] Well, dear, what do you think those TVs are for?
[time=687] Well, the tour guide said that they meet on Sunday, so those are probably hooked up to satellite feeds
[time=693] so that the preachers can catch all the ESPN stations while they're preaching up here.
[time=699] How are all these Christian blokes believed in? Good question.
[time=703] Well, basically Christians believe in a god. I think his name is Jesus and well, this is a real short version,
[time=710] but they believe if you like this Jesus fellow, then you'll go to heaven when you die.
[time=716] Well, if you don't walk in. Good question.
[time=722] Well, then you'll spend eternity in, well, down there.
[time=728] Down where? Down under Australia? Really? I didn't know what I did.
[time=735] Lyle, I don't see an organ. I thought all churches had organs.
[time=739] Yeah, I don't see one either. Well, there's a piano over there.
[time=743] Is that an electric guitar? Wall. An electric guitar? I've never seen one in church before.
[time=750] Hey, can you play some Eddie Van Halen?
[time=754] Yeah! Righteous!
[time=758] Whoa! Oh! Yes!
[time=763] [APPLAUSE]
[time=766] Hello, souls, please. Let's stay together.
[time=773] You know, I couldn't help but, uh, notice that you all had some pretty good questions.
[time=778] In fact, that's kind of what we're doing here today, answering questions.
[time=781] So you're more than welcome to just stay and grab a seat and we'd love to have you just be a part of what's going on.
[time=787] Oh, thanks! But we've got a tight scheduled instinct too.
[time=790] We have to be out at St. Joe, Indiana at one o'clock to tour the secular pickle factory.
[time=797] Well, you know, actually you could do your pickle tour and no problem because we get done at 12.
[time=804] [laughter] Good bye now! We're walking. The bus is waiting, everyone. Good bye.
[time=815] We're walking. We're walking. Come on, everyone.
[time=819] [APPLAUSE - 5 seconds]
[time=829] Wow.
[time=832] Well, that's what we've-- that's what we've been doing. Sorry about that.
[time=836] I left all those sheets there. Sorry, Dino.
[time=838] We have been for the last-- well, last week, if you were here Easter, you know, we passed out hundreds of cards and we asked folks.
[time=844] [APPLAUSE]
[time=852] Wow.
[time=855] Well, that's what we've-- that's what we've been doing.
[time=858] Sorry about that. I left all those sheets there. Sorry, Dino.
[time=861] We have been for the last-- well, last week, if you were here Easter, you know, we passed out hundreds of cards and we asked folks to ask God a question.
[time=869] If there was some kind of spiritual question, you wanted to ask God, what would it be?
[time=872] And we got just a ton of cards and we-- last week and then today are going to do our best to kind of try and divvy those cards up and address questions that real people, like you and I, are asking all the time.
[time=884] And we're trying our best to do that through the grid of God's Word.
[time=888] Before we get to that, though, I want to just-- if you would, please, would you pull out that green sheet one more time?
[time=893] I want to say thank you. We made a huge dent in this-- what is a pretty enormous summer ministry need with the kids.
[time=901] And again, I want to say that if you're-- if you're, you know, high school student, college student, young adult, all the way up to the more, you know, the wiser gray-haired crew, it doesn't matter who you are.
[time=912] We would love for you to come and be a part of this. The kids would love for you to come be a part of this.
[time=918] For nine months, there are a faithful team of people who pretty much every week give themselves to investing in the hearts and lives of kids.
[time=925] And we give those folks the summer off and we come to the family and say, "Hey, would you be willing to jump in and help?
[time=931] Roll up your sleeves, pour some juice, serve some cookies, walk them down the hall, let them do their thing.
[time=936] We need your help." And last week, many of you responded, "Let me remind you what the commitment is.
[time=943] It's really so very doable. There's two teams each hour, and that allows you to go every other week."
[time=950] So that's the commitment. Basically, we'll ask them for six Sundays for the summer.
[time=955] And two-year-olds all the way up through fifth grade is the commitment.
[time=959] So look at your sheets, and then here's the need currently.
[time=962] After last week, team one and first hour, and again, if you're a second hour worship for here in this room, then first hour needs your help.
[time=970] And on team one, there's 15 needed, 18 needed and team two total still for first hour, 33.
[time=977] So please give that some thought. Right now, would you get out your pen and your pencil?
[time=981] Second hour, if you're interested in changing hours and coming to church first hour during the summer, which many do,
[time=988] team one, 31 needed there, 29 still needed and team two, we'd love to see you jump into that mix.
[time=995] If that was on your heart to do, total still needed 60.
[time=999] And so today at the doors, the guys and the gals will be there with the buckets. Please give some thought.
[time=1004] Even right now, just go ahead and fill that out.
[time=1006] Or as you're leaving, jot down something and drop it in the bucket and the children's ministry folks will call you and let you know what your assignment is.
[time=1014] Mitch, what did you say? First hour, I thought it was pretty insightful.
[time=1017] On the way here, I kept thinking about why wouldn't you sign up?
[time=1021] And I think one is fear. I'm afraid I don't have no idea what to expect.
[time=1025] I'm not a scholar. I don't know a whole lot about the Bible.
[time=1029] And I just want to let you know that all that's done for you, the staff here is taking care of the curriculum.
[time=1034] You don't have to worry. I think about a lot of prep time.
[time=1037] And if for some reason you're not doing it because the six weeks don't match up with your schedule, they'll work with you.
[time=1042] The staff is absolutely incredible on how they'll work with you and you will love doing this.
[time=1048] I mean, how many people here can remember a teacher of any kind who influenced your life greatly? Just raise your hand.
[time=1054] I mean, the reward is enormous. So why not do it?
[time=1059] Please, please, if there's some modification, write it down on the green sheet and our staff will give you.
[time=1064] And we need a lot more helpers than leaders, right?
[time=1066] Yes.
[time=1067] So if you don't feel like you can be a leader, man, everybody can be a help.
[time=1069] Some of the opportunities there on your sheet are for kind of lead teachers.
[time=1073] And again, that doesn't require a master's degree.
[time=1078] It just requires maybe some experience and some passion to teach and communicate and kind of lead that group.
[time=1085] But we need lots of helpers as well. So teachers and helpers, please give it some thought.
[time=1090] And let's see if we can't tackle this need here in the next week or so. Okay? Thank you.
[time=1095] Hey, let's jump into our questions. We had a few left over from last week.
[time=1100] And I think last week we actually ended. Someone asked if we would please explain to them this whole thing about election.
[time=1109] Wow, election. The idea that God actually is the one who is at work in this process of salvation.
[time=1118] Having even before time began elected chosen those who would be his.
[time=1126] It's an amazing thought that as you think it through really carries with it all kinds of interesting questions
[time=1134] and challenges for us as we kind of practically try and put our arms around that.
[time=1138] Here's what I want to say about it. Okay? You realize that we could fill a library with books that have been written about this topic.
[time=1145] And so many people trusted scholars and Bible students from ages gone by.
[time=1152] You know, see this thing a little differently.
[time=1155] But I think it is for us to do our best to simply put our arms around what we can put our arms around.
[time=1161] And I want to just say it to you like this. I want to come over here and I'm going to say there's going to be some verses that are going to come up.
[time=1167] Ephesians 1-4. And I want to say on the one hand that I completely and absolutely believe this to be true.
[time=1174] That before the foundations of the world just as he chose us.
[time=1178] Those of us that know him. Those of us that are in relationship with him.
[time=1182] I believe that before the foundations of the world as it says in Ephesians 1-4.
[time=1187] He chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and blameless before him in love.
[time=1195] It goes on to say, "He predestined us to adoptions as sons through Jesus Christ to himself according to the kind intention of his will."
[time=1206] It says in 2 Peter 3-9, "The Lord is not slow." Actually, we're going to skip that one and go to Romans 8-29, "For whom he foreknew."
[time=1218] He also foreknew, knew before, chose before, elected before, whom he foreknew.
[time=1224] He also predestined to become conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many brethren.
[time=1234] We'll stop. And whom he predestined these he also called, and whom he called these he also justified, and whom he justified these he also glorified.
[time=1243] And we'll stop there. I believe because God's word teaches us that before this whole thing ever began, he knew that he was involved in this process of calling us to himself,
[time=1256] and that he was extremely and absolutely involved in that process, and that he knew before the foundations of the world that you would say, "Yes."
[time=1266] And that he called you, drew you to himself, to say, "Yes."
[time=1273] I also believe with all of my heart because this book teaches it, and it says it so clearly, passages like this.
[time=1280] I think we'll go back to where we were just a second ago in 2 Peter.
[time=1286] No, go back to the other passages, 2 Peter 3-9.
[time=1292] There it is. The Lord is not slow about his promise as some count slowness, but his patient toward you, not wishing for any, it says.
[time=1304] Now, he elected and he chose some over here, it says, but over here it says that he's patient because he does not wish for any to perish, but for all to come to repentance.
[time=1319] And then I believe as it says there in John 3, 16, it says, "Forgot so loved the world that he gave his only son that whosoever believes in him should not perish."
[time=1329] He died for the world that whoever believes in him should not perish.
[time=1335] It's very challenging to reconcile these two thoughts.
[time=1340] We know because we've seen enough life that not everybody's in.
[time=1346] We know that. We also know that it says in 2 Peter 3 that he's patient, not wishing any would perish.
[time=1352] And it says over here that he before the foundations of the world decided, elected, chose, predestined.
[time=1359] I can't clear it all up for you.
[time=1362] What we can say to you, and the way in which we can encourage you is this, I always default back to what I do know.
[time=1369] And for me, that's a big default back. Very basic stuff. What I know is that I had a choice.
[time=1377] I was 20 years old.
[time=1379] And I know that in that moment in the back row of that church in September of 1983, I know that I chose to surrender my heart and life to him.
[time=1390] And I can tell you, I can remember it like it was yesterday at that very moment.
[time=1395] And even in the weeks and months prior, I felt a tug at my heart.
[time=1401] I felt like the hook got in and he was tugging me, pulling me to him.
[time=1407] I sensed that. And yet I knew in that moment I had choices to make.
[time=1412] And you have choices to make. And we have been given this truth.
[time=1416] He said in Matthew 28, "Go." He said, "Go. Make disciples baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son of the Holy Spirit. Go and spread this word. Go and live out your faith."
[time=1428] And I don't think he told us to do that, just to go through the motions.
[time=1433] And so we come back to what we know, and what we know is he is an extremely sovereign God who's done some things that someday will maybe understand.
[time=1440] But for now, it is for us to go. It is for us to choose, to make decisions.
[time=1445] And that's truth we need to hold on to.
[time=1447] Next question says, "How should the church address the issue of women dressing modestly?" This is a question about modesty, especially in a culture that encourages them to use fashion as a means to express their sexuality.
[time=1463] If you've watched television at all, lately, if you've gone to the movies at all, lately, if you've walked through them all, at all lately, if you go to school, it's just everywhere in our culture.
[time=1476] We have to admit that we're facing and seeing and coming up against a new movement, an even more aggressive movement.
[time=1488] And we wanted this morning to just share some things from God's word about this whole idea of dress.
[time=1493] Not in just women, either, right? No, not just women. I see a lot of men that I wish they had more on.
[time=1500] A whole lot of them.
[time=1502] Is that from the retreat? I don't know if that's in the Bible word.
[time=1511] First of all, modesty isn't some punishment. It's not the things you can't do.
[time=1517] Okay, modesty is an opportunity for us to worship him by doing what he says to do in his word.
[time=1525] And I can't define it for you, but he does. Look at 1 Peter, I mean 1 Timothy chapter 2 verse 9.
[time=1530] It says, "Likewise, I want women to adorn themselves with proper clothing." I'd throw men in there. In that culture, that wasn't an issue. In our culture, it is.
[time=1539] Likewise, I want men and women to adorn themselves with proper clothing modestly and discreetly, not with braided hair, gold, or pearls, or costly garments, but rather by means of good works as befits women making a claim to godliness.
[time=1554] And I'd say you need to get engaged in the opportunity to express your worship by dressing modestly.
[time=1561] And for most of you, it just means dressing with him in mind the way you do when you come here on Sunday morning.
[time=1568] And men, I'd challenge you just practically to get in the game with your wife and your daughter's clothing,
[time=1576] because they seriously see a lot of things as cute. They aren't trying to be sexy.
[time=1583] They really see some things as just looking cute for their daughter or for themselves that you know.
[time=1590] You know men see differently. And I don't know many men that are willing to risk the price you have to pay to get in that game.
[time=1600] It costs you something, so we just go, "You two take care of that."
[time=1606] Practically speaking, I believe men should lead their wives and their daughters in an effort to express their worship to him through their dress.
[time=1616] Amen. My oldest daughter, Megan, turns 13 this week.
[time=1622] And I'm on the board of her school, the Blakeville Park Christian School.
[time=1626] And so I've watched these girls that I've taught, that I've coached, all kind of do this consequence of the sin in Genesis 3 thing,
[time=1634] where it says, "Women, you'll have a desire for your husband.
[time=1638] Women, you'll have a desire for your husband." So there's this desire in each of you, females, for attention from the guy.
[time=1645] And so I asked Megan on the school one day, "Remember this?" I said, "Hey, why do you think that girls want the attention by sight from the guys rather than have the guy see them at their solar heart level?"
[time=1668] And Megan's response was really insightful, and you can tell her her mother is. And she said, "Well, that's because that's the way the guys measure it."
[time=1681] And so there is a second side to this coin, and that is how men and how boys value girls by sight, and that's wrong.
[time=1695] And in fact, all women want that attention or that notice situation for the experience and the intimacy to be known at the heart level.
[time=1706] So again, we're abusing what God has created as good, and we could just improve a lot if guys would see girls, if husbands would see wives at the soul and the heart level and see all women that way.
[time=1719] And then if women could feel that and know that they don't have to do the adornment on the outside thing.
[time=1724] Well said. Let me just ask you to turn to 1 Peter 3. 1 Peter 3, we're going to pick it up in verse 3, and let me just if I can.
[time=1733] Let me just address this again, this is addressed, this passage here, addressed to women, but I like what Mitch just said.
[time=1740] Really, I would invite women and men to understand and look at this and rethink how you process this stuff.
[time=1747] We're going to start in verse 3, verse 3, 1 Peter chapter 3, verse 3, and let not your adornment. Stop there for a second.
[time=1757] Adornment is in the Greek, it's the word used in essence to say that which is going to be attractive about you, your beauty, that which draws someone to you, that which allows a guy, for instance, to notice you.
[time=1776] It says let not your adornment, or that which is attractive about you, be merely external, braiding the hair, wearing gold jewelry, or putting on dresses.
[time=1787] Now ladies, those three things there, that was for the context of this day.
[time=1792] You don't need me to sit here and tell you what the context of this day, our culture is telling you to wear, or not wear.
[time=1801] Our culture today is loud and clear on what it is you shouldn't wear, how it is you should wear, what you are wearing.
[time=1811] And this is saying, hey, whoa, time out, be careful, don't let what's going to be attractive about you, be those things.
[time=1820] But verse 4, let it be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit which is precious in the sight of God.
[time=1833] And I'll just end it right there and just say to all of us, guys, you know, what's attractive?
[time=1840] What is it that we're going to as men, allow to move us and draw us and move us to notice and pay attention to someone?
[time=1850] God's Word says let it be her godliness, let it be her soft heart, let it be her personality that is committed to the Lord and to people.
[time=1859] Let it be the fact that she's a young woman who honors God with her life and not how she wears her jeans.
[time=1869] And not how she wears her tops, not what she does with her hair.
[time=1874] And gals, help in the process by being careful about your jeans and your tops and your hair and all the other stuff.
[time=1884] And let's just do our best to keep things focused in the arena that God's called us to focus in.
[time=1892] Those reality TV shows that are on right now and everyone in your house and you're intrigued by them.
[time=1897] At least use it as a teaching tool. It surfaces exactly what we said is plain as day.
[time=1902] You know, a guy gets a shot at 20 girls and it's all on how they look at her.
[time=1906] Oh, you know, all the guys are thinking, oh, yeah, I'd like to do that.
[time=1909] And then the girls, to see the sickness of them compete and desire for this one guy all on the outside to eventually get in the inside.
[time=1919] You know, it's sad. Some questions from some kids. We love getting these.
[time=1924] We're just going to give you three today. Some questions from some little ones that they wanted to have some answers to.
[time=1929] Great questions again this week. Number one was why does God give us talent?
[time=1933] Somebody wanted to know why does God give us talent?
[time=1936] And if you're here today or if you've asked that question before and you're a kid, let me just say to you.
[time=1940] Or even if you're an adult, that's not a bad reminder. Please hear this. God gave you talent.
[time=1945] And I don't care who you are, you may think, oh, I got no talent. No, you've got talent.
[time=1949] There's something God's given you the ability to do. There's something God's given you a passion for.
[time=1953] There's something that you really enjoy doing.
[time=1956] And the great thing is, is that he gave you that talent because he wants you to use it not to bring attention to yourself, not even necessarily to help some other organist.
[time=1966] No, he wants you to use your talent. That's what you're gifted at, to bring glory and honor to him.
[time=1974] One of the things that we get so discouraged by sometimes, even around here, is that there are so many talented people.
[time=1982] And again, culture says go use your talent here. Go take what you're good at and be able to go and express it there.
[time=1989] And so many times we would just want to say, hey, you know what, take your talent.
[time=1994] And there's nothing wrong with using it there, but use it here.
[time=1998] Use what you're good at here to help bring glory to God, to help point others toward truth.
[time=2005] It's a great question. You've all got him. It says, and from everyone who has been given much, shall much be required.
[time=2011] That which he's giving you, he expects you to use, and he expects you to use it properly.
[time=2016] Next question from the kids, why can't I pray to Jesus?
[time=2020] Can I pray to Jesus this little one wanted to know?
[time=2024] And there's kind of two answers there. Number one, we just want to answer it just basically, yes.
[time=2030] I mean, if this question is about can I pray directly to him?
[time=2034] Because I've kind of been told over here that I've got to kind of go pray over here and then it gets to him.
[time=2039] No, we want to say to that, you can pray to him.
[time=2043] Now, the question may have been intended, should I pray to Jesus, or should I pray to God, or should I pray to the Lord?
[time=2049] And we had an interesting time this week. The three of us were just driving along and I just said, "Hey, guys, who was talking to Stephen? Who do you guys pray to?" And they looked at me first, a guy with some kind of heretic.
[time=2062] I said, "No, no, no, like Jesus, oh, yeah." And we realized even in our daily lives, we pray to the Lord, and we pray to Jesus, and we pray to Gummy.
[time=2072] We kind of get that mixed up, but I don't want to in any way insinuate that we think this is some kind of dividing watershed issue.
[time=2081] But we do want to just remind ourselves that Jesus said here is an example of how to pray, and in Matthew 6.9, he said, "Our Father, who art in Heaven."
[time=2090] And so it seems as if there's some kind of direction being given there that maybe that's a good place to start with our Father, who art in Heaven.
[time=2099] But if you say, "Dear Lord," or if you're in the custom of praying to Jesus, we don't want to, again, slap you on the wrist and say, "Get your prayer life together."
[time=2107] It's just a good question and a good thought to think through.
[time=2111] Next, "Why wasn't Judas forgiven?" Why wasn't Judas forgiven?
[time=2116] There are some things in the text that seem to indicate that maybe in the end when it was all said and done, Judas wasn't a believer.
[time=2126] And we just, instead of getting into all that, we want to just remind any of you kids today because this was a kid's question, this.
[time=2135] What happened to Judas? Again, it may seem somewhat clear, there may be some confusion, but here's the point.
[time=2141] You know what, kids? If you ask for forgiveness, if Judas asked to be forgiven, and maybe we don't see that in the text, if he asked to be forgiven, he was forgiven.
[time=2151] If you ask to be forgiven, God forgives, because God's grace and God's mercy never runs out and he is longing to, and wanting to grant that very thing which brings life and relationship with him.
[time=2165] Forgiveness, if you'll ask.
[time=2167] Next question.
[time=2168] No, this is from the song.
[time=2170] Yeah.
[time=2171] Every tribe, every time.
[time=2172] Every tribe, every people.
[time=2173] How will lead to the land?
[time=2174] Corbin, come up here and play.
[time=2175] Let's Steve sing this thing.
[time=2176] The song said, "Every tribe, every people, every nation." Why aren't American churches even this one more demographically diverse?
[time=2184] God, why aren't our churches as diverse as our culture?
[time=2187] I tell you what, I've asked in that a lot.
[time=2190] Because I'd love to be in a church, in a local body, where every single type of person in the demographic area would join together to worship.
[time=2201] And it hasn't happened in my life, and I've made attempts to go ask some people and to do this and to do that.
[time=2207] The truth is, in the first century church for one thing, this didn't happen right here.
[time=2212] On Sunday nights, after work, they got together in homes, and they did church then.
[time=2220] But they didn't just do church then when they sang and they prayed and they worshiped.
[time=2224] They did church all week as they met each other's needs.
[time=2227] What I'd like you to think about is the reality that the church at Fort Wayne, like the church at Ephesus and like the church at Colossae,
[time=2236] the church at Fort Wayne is pretty diverse.
[time=2239] It's very diverse.
[time=2241] And the demographics in this whole area, there are lots of Christians from every type of cultural group that you can think of.
[time=2247] They just don't all get together on Sunday mornings at the same place.
[time=2250] And we should be doing church all week long with all of those brothers and sisters in Christ.
[time=2256] If you have people at work that are believers, you should be doing church with them.
[time=2262] And I believe our church is more diverse than we think of it being.
[time=2267] I don't think Blackhawk Sunday morning service is diverse as I'd like for it to be.
[time=2273] But you know what?
[time=2275] We live in neighborhoods and the reality is in the United States, most people go to the place that's kind of close to where they live.
[time=2282] And cultural groups kind of live together.
[time=2285] That's the way the demographics work out.
[time=2287] So I've stopped worrying about that so much, but I've been thinking a lot about how much am I practicing my Christianity among the believers that are in the church at Fort Wayne?
[time=2295] Should be happening.
[time=2297] That's good.
[time=2301] Next question is what happened to the gift of healing?
[time=2304] This probably alludes to three different passages if you want to jot them down from the Bible.
[time=2310] Ephesians 4, Romans 12, 1 Corinthians 12.
[time=2314] Ephesians 4, Romans 12, 1 Corinthians 12, and it talks about spiritual gifts.
[time=2319] But what we tend to kind of gloss over is this word gifts.
[time=2324] And behind every gift there is a giver.
[time=2327] And that giver, the Spirit of God, is available at any time to offer us what we need.
[time=2333] So does God heal today?
[time=2335] Yes.
[time=2336] How many people here have prayed for God to heal you and you've been healed?
[time=2341] Yeah.
[time=2342] Or anybody around you you've prayed for and they've been healed.
[time=2344] Raise your hand.
[time=2345] Keep up high.
[time=2346] Let me see again.
[time=2347] Okay.
[time=2348] How many people here have prayed for healing for someone else or you've been with someone who prayed for healing and they were not healed of that physical ailment.
[time=2357] Go ahead and raise your hand.
[time=2358] Look around.
[time=2359] All right.
[time=2360] So what's the deal?
[time=2361] Well, here's the thing.
[time=2363] We pray for a cure.
[time=2368] But God offers healing.
[time=2373] We pray for a cure of those physical ailments, but God offers healing.
[time=2378] Life on this earth is not about our physical comfort.
[time=2382] God wants everything that is good for us, but we live in a fallen place.
[time=2387] And until we get to the other side, it's going to be this way.
[time=2390] So it's in God's sovereignty on whether you're healed on this side or the other side, or let's say cured.
[time=2397] But that's what brings Paul's phrase to light in Philippians 1, 21.
[time=2402] To live his Christ, to die his gain.
[time=2405] If you have a physical ailment on this side, on the other side, it's gone.
[time=2409] He does.
[time=2410] He does answer that.
[time=2412] Life in Christ is a win-win situation.
[time=2415] We want a cure, but God offers healing through his kingdom heart, his chapter in verse eyes.
[time=2423] His higher good is about our community in him and with each other in Christ.
[time=2431] Well said.
[time=2433] Here's one that I know has been asked many, many, many times.
[time=2438] Lord, I've asked for forgiveness many times for very old sins.
[time=2442] Why do I not feel at peace from these sins?
[time=2446] I know you have forgiven me. Why can't I forgive myself?
[time=2451] I feel haunted forever.
[time=2455] I won't ask you to raise your hands, but I bet in all honesty and sincerity if I asked
[time=2461] us to, there'd be a lot of hands in here that would say, yeah, I've wrestled with that.
[time=2467] I've battled with that for a long, long time.
[time=2469] And there's just a lot we could talk about here.
[time=2472] This is a good six-week series.
[time=2474] But we'll just try and give you some things to chew on here, some things to really consider.
[time=2478] I'm going to give you the first one is this.
[time=2480] I want you to read what it says in 1 John 1-9.
[time=2482] I want you to, before you read it, keep listening to me.
[time=2485] I want you to read this, and I want you to read it, remembering and realizing and seeing
[time=2491] that this is absolutely true.
[time=2494] This is not maybe, this is not sort of, this is not kind of, this is absolutely true.
[time=2501] He says to you and to me, whoever you are, wherever you've gone, whatever it is you did,
[time=2507] whoever it is you hurt.
[time=2509] He says, if you confess, if we confess our sin, he says, in 1 John 1-9, he is faithful
[time=2517] and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us, make us right, make us pure, make
[time=2525] us new all over again, it's what he does.
[time=2530] It's what he does.
[time=2531] You have nothing to do with that.
[time=2535] That's what he does.
[time=2536] He forgives us our sins and he cleanses us from all unrighteousness.
[time=2540] He does, which is why I have a struggle personally with this phrase that has kind of crept into
[time=2546] our terminology in recent years.
[time=2549] I can't forgive myself.
[time=2555] I hear folks say that.
[time=2556] I understand the turmoil and the wrestling that's going on there, but you've got to remember now.
[time=2562] That's not for you to do.
[time=2563] What I can't forgive myself often means is I can't bring myself to receive the forgiveness
[time=2570] that he's offered.
[time=2574] And though I understand that and can identify with that, you and I have to understand the
[time=2580] subtle pride that that exposes.
[time=2586] I can't forgive myself.
[time=2587] I can't receive what he's done as if you could do something more than what he's done.
[time=2597] And you can't.
[time=2599] And so though that's a struggle, we have to wrestle with that.
[time=2602] We have to realize 1 John 1 9 is completely true.
[time=2606] And you forgiving, you can't forgive.
[time=2608] No, that's not the deal.
[time=2610] He does that.
[time=2612] And then talking with a friend this weekend, this friend reminded me of what it says, reminded me of what it says in Psalm 32, and this is so powerful.
[time=2620] Many of you just need to grab on to this in a fresh new way.
[time=2625] It says in Psalm 32, 3 and 4, "When I kept silent about my sin, my body wasted away through
[time=2631] my groaning all day long, for day and night, many of us in the room have gone through this.
[time=2637] For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me.
[time=2640] My vitality was drained away as with the fever heat of summer." And it goes on and says in verse 5, "I acknowledged my sin to thee, and my iniquity I did not hide.
[time=2652] I said, 'I will confess my transgressions to the Lord.'" Here it is, "and thou didst forgive the guilt of my sin."
[time=2664] We sometimes need to be reminded that not only is he the forgiver of the sin, but he's also the one who gives grace even to the guilt that comes with the sin.
[time=2673] He covers it all.
[time=2675] The act, the violation, what took place in your heart and the guilt that comes with it,
[time=2681] he says, "I wipe it all out, I cover it all, forgiven completely by me," he says.
[time=2693] And so, whoever you are, whatever it is you're wrestling with.
[time=2697] And you know what sometimes it helps to talk to somebody about it.
[time=2700] I think sometimes that wrestling and that sense of being alone is because you really are.
[time=2704] You haven't just sat down with a good friend and said, "You know what?
[time=2709] I got to get things straight here, but I want you to be a part of this as well."
[time=2715] So if we can help with that at all, please let us know.
[time=2718] Next question.
[time=2720] "Will a person who lived a good moral life but was never baptized be punished the same way after death as a person who lived an immoral life and was a murderer and a torturer?"
[time=2736] The question seems to place a value on baptism that we want to make sure we clarify.
[time=2742] And I want to tell you a story.
[time=2745] I was sitting on an airplane talking with a guy about some plans that we needed to make for what we were going to do.
[time=2752] And there was a spiritual conversation going on.
[time=2755] And when we got finished after half hour, 45 minutes, whatever it was, he was behind me so we were talking rather loud to each other over the engines.
[time=2763] Now this guy across the aisle reaches over and he goes, he just jerked on my sleeve and I look over and he said, "Are you a religious guy?" And I said, "Oh yeah." I know the difference between religion and Christianity or being a new creation.
[time=2778] I'm not going to go into that now.
[time=2779] I didn't do that with him either.
[time=2780] I just said, "Oh yeah.
[time=2781] I'm a really religious guy." And he said, "I've got a question." He says, "Is there a mortal sin?
[time=2787] Something I can't be forgiven." And I said, "Oh yeah." He goes, "What is it?" I said, "If the Spirit of God is drawing you
[time=2801] and you reject the Spirit of God's tug on your heart and you reject Christ as your personal Lord and Savior.
[time=2810] And you do that until you die, you cannot be forgiven of that."
[time=2816] He goes, "Are there any others?"
[time=2822] I said, "No." Then I went through the illustration with the guy.
[time=2825] I told him.
[time=2826] I went through the bridge and described his sin, his need.
[time=2829] And he's across the aisle.
[time=2830] So I had to be pretty loud because the engines were gone.
[time=2833] And we got through the whole thing and we get finished.
[time=2836] I give him the address of a church in Indianapolis that I know is a really good one.
[time=2840] And about a half hour later, I'd guess, or maybe shorter, maybe longer.
[time=2845] But a lady two rows up in front of him.
[time=2847] She's in the middle of the row.
[time=2849] She sticks her head out in the aisle.
[time=2851] She goes, "Hey mister." And I said, "What?" She's looking around and she goes, "What's the address of that church you were talking about?" I mean, you don't know what's going on, but I do know this.
[time=2861] What I told that guy is the truth.
[time=2864] Circumcision, uncircumcision, baptism, no baptism, good things done, bad things done.
[time=2871] None of that is what counts.
[time=2874] The truth of it is, if you reject the tug of the Spirit of God on your heart and you reject
[time=2881] Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior, whether you've been baptized and preaching,
[time=2887] or not, doesn't make a bit of difference.
[time=2892] Receiving him lets you have fellowship with him forever.
[time=2897] And it does say there are going to be some rewards for people there too.
[time=2901] And not receiving Christ as your Savior puts you in hell, baptized or not.
[time=2908] And the punishment, it says there's weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth and separation
[time=2915] from light and truth and hope forever.
[time=2920] That's the truth.
[time=2924] Oh, 1 John 5, 11 and 12, let's read that first, if you haven't.
[time=2928] 1 John 5, 11 and 12, I think that.
[time=2930] And this is the testimony.
[time=2931] God has given us eternal life and this life is in His Son.
[time=2936] He who has the Son has the light.
[time=2939] He who does not have the Son baptized or not does not have the light.
[time=2944] Well, then the next question fits in really well.
[time=2952] Then why do I still sin even though I'm saved?
[time=2959] Quick answer is Romans 3, 23.
[time=2962] For all have sinned, present tense.
[time=2965] All fall short daily.
[time=2969] All fall short.
[time=2971] So the gospel message is quite a different deal than we tend to make it.
[time=2975] We tend to do the moral or in the immoral or out kind of a deal.
[time=2979] Now we all fall short.
[time=2981] Morality is good, but we all fall short.
[time=2983] This is not a haven for saints.
[time=2985] It's a hospital for sinners.
[time=2987] We're doing life together, recognizing that we need that gap filled by His Spirit,
[time=2993] by Christ's work on the cross through His resurrection.
[time=2996] Just a real simple analogy I've done with kids, and I may do a sermon on it here some time, but I'll use the same illustrations as it's real simple.
[time=3003] When Michael Jordan walks up to a free throw line, and he shoots a free throw, and he makes 88 out of 100, and he misses 12 out of 100, right?
[time=3011] Does he miss those 12 on purpose?
[time=3014] No.
[time=3016] That's what that verse is talking about.
[time=3019] Missing the mark.
[time=3021] I attempt to make it, but I fall short.
[time=3024] On this side of heaven, I fall short.
[time=3028] The other ways that we sin are three other ways, and these are from Greek words, from Scripture, about sin, or words for sin.
[time=3036] Now the one is I walk up, and I just miss it on purpose.
[time=3039] Go up, and I miss the shot on purpose.
[time=3041] That's a no-me that's breaking the law.
[time=3043] No law.
[time=3044] I just miss it on purpose.
[time=3045] Hopefully as a believer, you don't sin that way too often.
[time=3048] I know you do, but that's not the way it should shake out most of the time.
[time=3053] Now the one is you go up to the basketball line, and you don't shoot at all.
[time=3057] It's pareptammo, it's sins of omission, leaving good undone.
[time=3062] I wish I'd have done that good, but I didn't.
[time=3065] So sins of omission.
[time=3066] So we have where we try to shoot it and make it, and miss it.
[time=3069] That's hamertia.
[time=3070] We have where we go up and we miss it on purpose.
[time=3073] That's a no-me, no law, breaking the law.
[time=3075] And then we have pareptammo, where we shoot it, and don't shoot it all rather.
[time=3080] And then there's one more.
[time=3082] And that's where we shoot it, and we miss, but we tell everybody we made it.
[time=3086] It's a daika, it's twisting or wrong to make it right.
[time=3091] As a believer, hopefully, and I'm not saying hopefully you sin, but hopefully your sin looks like missing the shot you're trying to make.
[time=3098] Sometimes you're going to leave good undone, but the Holy Spirit works in you to change that.
[time=3105] I often ask question, what is God's will for me?
[time=3109] How can I know it?
[time=3110] What is God's will for me, and how do I know what it is?
[time=3115] Just real quickly, you can write these three things down, very important.
[time=3119] Many of you maybe have heard this in the past.
[time=3121] Others of you, maybe it's new news.
[time=3123] Just write this down.
[time=3124] The Word of God, write that down.
[time=3126] Number one, the Word of God, secondly, the Spirit of God, and thirdly, the people of God.
[time=3132] Just write down the line there.
[time=3133] The Word of God, the Spirit of God, the people of God.
[time=3136] And what we mean by that is this.
[time=3137] Oftentimes, as you're trying to discern what God's will is, trying to figure out what you should do, where you should go, what you should choose in this circumstance.
[time=3145] Oftentimes, the Scriptures speak to that and give you an eye guidance.
[time=3150] And that's a wonderful thing when that happens that way.
[time=3153] You just look up the chapter and the verse, and there it is, and it gives great clarity, and it might be difficult, but there it is.
[time=3160] Sometimes God leads you and me toward His will, kind of through a subjective sense of His leading.
[time=3166] The Holy Spirit at times will prompt or guide or lead you and I.
[time=3172] It will become abundantly clear through that prompting or leading that we're to have this
[time=3178] conversation with this person or make that business decision.
[time=3181] We've been in prayer about it, and the Word of God maybe wasn't specific in this case,
[time=3188] and so sometimes it's the leading of the Spirit.
[time=3190] That one is a little dangerous.
[time=3192] I mean, we've got to be careful with that, you and I, because oftentimes our own desires and our own wants will kind of mask as a leading or a prompting.
[time=3204] So we've got to be real careful with that.
[time=3206] Thirdly, another great one is the people of God.
[time=3208] God's Word says that we are to pursue wise counsel.
[time=3212] Oftentimes, we need that to balance out what's going on inside of us.
[time=3216] Who are the wise individuals who will speak truth into your life?
[time=3222] Is this in your best buddy who you just go to?
[time=3224] Because you know he'll say what you wanted to say.
[time=3226] Then you go back to your wife and say, "Well, say, I saw wise counsel." And they said, "No, this is somebody who you know regardless of how you're feeling or what you're wanting,
[time=3235] they will speak truth and wisdom into your life on that topic." Look what it says in Romans 12.
[time=3242] I love this.
[time=3243] It says in Romans 12, "I urge you therefore." Brethren, by the mercies of God, you want to experience God's will?
[time=3249] You want to see God's will unfold in your life?
[time=3252] Most of us do.
[time=3253] Look what it says here.
[time=3254] "I urge you by the mercies of God to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice."
[time=3260] How are you doing there?
[time=3261] Presenting your body daily to him, your self, your person, where you go, what you do.
[time=3267] Presenting yourself a holy and living sacrifice.
[time=3271] Acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship.
[time=3274] And then it says in verse 2, "And don't be conformed to this world." Don't be.
[time=3279] Don't be conformed.
[time=3281] Don't be thrown into the mold.
[time=3283] Don't do what they say.
[time=3285] Don't dress like they say.
[time=3287] Don't think like they say.
[time=3289] Don't relate like that.
[time=3290] No, don't be conformed.
[time=3291] He says to this, "You want to know God's will?
[time=3293] Be transformed by the renewing of your mind." Right here with this.
[time=3297] "By the renewing of your mind that you may prove what the will of God is."
[time=3303] That which is good and acceptable and perfect.
[time=3307] It's a great truth.
[time=3309] Great, great truth.
[time=3310] When you give yourself to him, honoring him with not only your life, your physical body,
[time=3316] but also your mind, the will of God, begins to come.
[time=3320] Sometimes it's, yeah, sometimes it's a little sticky.
[time=3322] And that's why we have a scripture in the spirit of God and the people of God.
[time=3326] Good question.
[time=3327] Let me just say this to you.
[time=3333] First of all, let me just invite you to come back next week.
[time=3336] We begin next week, five weeks, that we believe will be absolutely huge.
[time=3343] An incredible five weeks in the life of this church.
[time=3347] And I don't want to say too much.
[time=3348] We just want to invite you back to come be a part of it.
[time=3351] A lot of important things are going to be studied.
[time=3353] A lot of important things are going to be said and we don't want you to miss any of it.
[time=3357] Hey, you know what we've been asking questions lately.
[time=3361] And the great thing is he knows the answers to your questions.
[time=3365] He really does.
[time=3366] And not only does he know the answers to your questions, but one thing we want to make sure that we say this morning to you, he knows your name.
[time=3375] He knows you.
[time=3377] And many of you here in the room this morning know him.
[time=3380] Not just about him.
[time=3382] No, you know him.
[time=3385] And that is a wonderful thing.
[time=3387] That is a life-changing, eternity-altering reality like none other.
[time=3394] Others of you here though, you're searching.
[time=3398] You're seeking, trying to understand what it means to really know him.
[time=3406] He knows you.
[time=3407] He made you, and he designed you to live life in relationship with him.
[time=3412] And we want to help you know what that looks like.
[time=3417] And so this morning, if you're here and you need to talk to somebody about that, we'd love to do that.
[time=3422] You may have a good friend who invited you, who you trust, and you can talk with them or ask them questions.
[time=3428] If there's anything we can do at all, to help you come to know him.
[time=3434] Like he knows you, we'd love to help.
[time=3437] Would you just bow your heads with me as we leave today?
[time=3440] Father, we come before you here in this moment.
[time=3444] So incredibly grateful that you know us.
[time=3449] And I guess the amazing thing, God, is that you know us like you do, and you still love us.
[time=3455] You still offer grace, you still extend mercy.
[time=3458] You still give direction and hope you still embrace each of us that knows you in a way that just, it's almost confusing at times.
[time=3469] Because we're so aware of our shortcomings.
[time=3472] We're so aware and acquainted with our struggles and our failures and our sin.
[time=3477] And God in knowing us, you see all of that and you continue to grow us and shape us and exercise so much patience.
[time=3487] God, I pray it would change us.
[time=3489] I pray it would change the way we live and the way we think.
[time=3492] And God, as we leave this place today, hopefully changed because of our time with you.
[time=3497] God, I pray you'd give us courage and strength to live lives and make choices and represent you.
[time=3504] To see every single encounter as a divine appointment and an opportunity to be consumed with things so far beyond the everyday of life.
[time=3516] God, thank you for a place that we can gather and a family that we can come together with.
[time=3521] We thank you for what you're doing in this family here.
[time=3525] And we pray, God, that you continue to challenge and stretch and grow each of us to be more like you.
[time=3532] Thank you for this time.
[time=3534] And all the people agreed and said amen.
