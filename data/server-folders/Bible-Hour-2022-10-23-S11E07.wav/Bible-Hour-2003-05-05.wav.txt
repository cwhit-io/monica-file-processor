[time=335] - Good question today, can we do that?
[time=337] Let me just ask you this.
[time=339] If I said to you, where is it that you go to worship?
[time=344] What would you think?
[time=346] Chew on that one for a second.
[time=348] If I asked you, where is it that you go for your best opportunity to worship God?
[time=355] Where is it that you go to give him praise?
[time=358] Where is it that you go?
[time=360] What's the setting?
[time=362] What's the surrounding where you can go and offer up to God your best worship?
[time=369] Where do we worship God?
[time=372] I think if you think about that and if we were to actually be in a conversation, a lot of you would say what I said for years
[time=381] and years and years, even knowing the Lord and living in relationship with him, I had kind of bought into the notion and I think the church has kind of done a disservice in that we've taught people this.
[time=392] I think your answer in mind and a lot of people's answers would be well, we go to worship at our church.
[time=399] We walk in through these doors and we sit in these seats or pews and it is there that we worship God.
[time=404] And if that is kind of what's in your mind in any way, shape or form, I want you to listen today really carefully.
[time=412] I want you to look with us into the pages of Scripture and see what we can learn maybe for the first time that you and I can worship God.
[time=422] In fact, we're called to worship God.
[time=424] Not only when we come to church, but if you talk about places of worship and situations where we get to bring praise and honor to him, well, you'll learn today that you can do that in your carpool.
[time=436] You can do that when you go to work.
[time=439] You can do that.
[time=440] You can worship and in fact should.
[time=442] Everywhere you go, whatever it is you're doing, whatever circumstance you find yourself in, you see what God has called us to is a life of worship, living lives of worship.
[time=453] That's what we'll look at today.
[time=455] And I hope as you listen that you'll really open up your mind and heart.
[time=459] There may be some new truths here for you to hear.
[time=461] There may be some things that you need to consider.
[time=463] And again, as always, if you hear something or you come across something in the message today that you need some help with, give us a call, email us at the website.
[time=473] Do whatever you need to do to get your questions answered.
[time=477] We'd love nothing more than to come alongside you.
[time=503] [MUSIC - 296 seconds]
[time=823] Hey, as Deb continues to play, let me ask if you just bow your heads. And let me just invite you as you think about that song we just sang and the opportunity that you have to worship your God, many of you here in the room this morning. You know him. You live in daily relationship with him. And in that relationship we'll see today that he gives you, and he gives me this unspeakable privilege.
[time=851] One that I think probably too often we take for granted, but he gives you the privilege to live out of life that reflects him to a world that, as the song just said, is hungry, lacking hope and direction, a world that you and I see every day in so many ways, crumbling, disintegrating, struggling, wandering.
[time=880] And here you are, and here I am, he gives us a chance to love him and follow him and to do that in such a way that it would make a difference in this world that we face. And oh God today, our prayer would be, and our hope would be, that through your word and through the truth that we've already proclaimed, God that you would be high and lifted up.
[time=906] God that there would be honor and glory given to you and God that as we do that, that you would graciously give back to us a greater glimpse of who you are, a deeper understanding of your truth and the courage, God and the willingness and the passion to live out our lives in a way that would make a difference.
[time=927] Thank you for this time together. In your son's name we pray. Amen.
[time=936] [MUSIC]
[time=955] I don't know, I don't think there is a solution. I really don't.
[time=959] In one answer, in a thirty second sound bite?
[time=964] I can't give you a quick answer. I can't give you a quick answer for that.
[time=969] [MUSIC]
[time=972] You know, we live today in a very scary world, a world that continues to regress morally, ethically and spiritually.
[time=980] When you read through the front page headlines, listen to even a few minutes of the evening news, the message is a dark one.
[time=986] Indicated loud, clear and often, our world is falling apart. Unspeakable evils are a daily occurrence, tragedy and despair run rampant.
[time=995] Hate, violence and abuse seem to increase rather than diminish, and in the midst of it all, the unspoken conclusion begins to leak out more and more.
[time=1004] There really is no hope. There really is no solution. Give up on it, they say.
[time=1009] Be realistic. The darkness is too thick to push back, the crisis and confusion too great to overcome.
[time=1016] But you know what? God's word says that's not true.
[time=1020] Because in the midst of this world's pain and confusion, right smack dab in the middle of its empty philosophy and feel thinking, he says I've placed the one thing that can bring hope and meaning.
[time=1030] The one thing that can stem the tide, the only thing that can push back the darkness and bring life where there once was death.
[time=1037] It's not hopeless, he says, I have given you the church.
[time=1040] And that's the deal people for you and me.
[time=1043] Those of us here fully surrendered to Christ and a part of his church, this church, we get to live out and share and proclaim the saving message of faith.
[time=1053] So will you help us? And will you jump in to the greatest endeavor of all? Will you give yourself completely the greatest promise?
[time=1067] Well, I hope you realize, I think most of you do, but for others of you it might be new news, that this pew, like so many pews in places like this all over the world, is the answer.
[time=1082] It is the only answer to a lost and hurting world, to the hopelessness and the chaos that you just saw there a little bit ago.
[time=1093] Now obviously I don't mean the pew itself, but what we refer to when we say that is really the people who sit in the pew.
[time=1102] Normal, everyday people just like you and me and just like her.
[time=1108] And we come and we sit in these pews and you know what, if we know him, if we have a relationship with him, the Scriptures teach us that as Christ followers who come together in a local fellowship, we are his divine remedy.
[time=1123] The message of hope, the gospel, Christ in us, it's the divine remedy for a really lost and really hurting world.
[time=1133] Scriptures also teach that following him your commitment in mind to give our lives to him, to surrender to him.
[time=1141] Scriptures teach that following him will entail certain priorities, vitally important spiritual pursuits that when followed God uses to strengthen our hearts.
[time=1153] They already convinced spiritually vital pursuits that when followed he uses to bridge with an on-looking and struggling world.
[time=1164] He uses these things. Spiritual pursuits that here we call at Blackhawk are five E's.
[time=1171] And there could be seven or ten or twenty I suppose, we just as a church feel like God's directed us to five.
[time=1177] Spiritual pursuits that we call five E's that when you're willing to and I'm willing to embrace exaltation and evangelism and encouragement and equipping and excellent stewardship, when you're willing to really give yourself to, he uses
[time=1192] to not only change our hearts but reach a world that so desperately needs help.
[time=1198] And this morning we come to this idea of exaltation. You see it there at the top of the list.
[time=1203] And are you willing and are we ready to be a church that is really devoted deeply, surrendered to this idea of exaltation, living a life, living a life of worship.
[time=1216] That phrase to me today means a lot. I mean God has helped me over the years become really, really clear on what that means.
[time=1225] Living a life of worship but for you today maybe that's kind of an odd thought.
[time=1230] Maybe worship is something you've always attributed to this room.
[time=1234] We want you to think about it this morning. Maybe you can identify with one who would struggle to understand this idea of really truly living a life of worship.
[time=1245] They say that I'm supposed to exalt God and live a life of worship.
[time=1251] Well maybe they've never tried to live my life.
[time=1255] Well let me tell you a little bit about myself.
[time=1258] I'm a single mom and I have two wonderful yet challenging children.
[time=1264] I'm a more than full-time secretary at a busy accounting firm.
[time=1268] Oh it's a great job but my days are enormously hectic.
[time=1273] My daughter is 15 and my son is 13.
[time=1277] Now I know that every parent would say that having two teenagers is a challenge but well it's just kind of tough without any help.
[time=1287] The kids do go to their dads every other weekend but let me just tell you that my ex-husband isn't a Christian.
[time=1295] He doesn't understand that the choices he makes for his life and the things he allows the children to watch and to do undermine everything I'm trying to teach them.
[time=1308] So when I hear words like exaltation or that I'm supposed to live a life of worship, can I just admit that that's an area I struggle with?
[time=1318] I mean how exactly do I exalt?
[time=1323] I know God intends for my worship to be more than something that happens on Sunday mornings but I spend most of my time either behind a desk or behind the wheel.
[time=1333] And there just isn't a lot of extra time or energy left to stop and exalt God.
[time=1339] And I find it a little intimidating when I read scriptures about heavenly beings praising God day and night without stopping.
[time=1348] I mean how can I live up to that?
[time=1351] I know Jesus Christ is my Lord and Savior.
[time=1354] I've put all of my faith and hope in Him alone.
[time=1358] I try to share my faith at work when I can and I do my best to raise my kids to be strong Christians.
[time=1365] We do devotions together when we can.
[time=1369] They're both active in youth for Christ.
[time=1371] I try to keep track of what they do and who they hang out with and what they watch but after working all day, driving all over the city, trying to keep my house in some kind of order and struggling to keep the children properly focused.
[time=1387] When am I supposed to exalt you? I just don't have the time or energy left to do anything but collapse and bed at night.
[time=1401] And then once a week I come to church to worship God right here in this pew.
[time=1408] Well that's easy. I can do that and I want to do that.
[time=1412] I love worshiping with my church family.
[time=1416] But living a life of worship, a life of worship, a life style, God, am I exalting you with my whole life, with my whole crazy hectic life?
[time=1441] I'm exalting you not only when I'm doing devotions with my kids but also when I'm driving them to soccer games or going through the grocery line or doing the best I can at my job.
[time=1455] Is it worship to help the kids learn to make right choices about the movies they watch or the music they listen to?
[time=1463] Is it worship to treat the people I meet with kindness, whether behind the desk or behind the wheel?
[time=1472] Is it worship to keep my house in order or pay my bills on time or return phone calls in a timely manner?
[time=1480] Is worship an attitude? Teach me Lord. Help me know what it means to exalt you in my everyday life.
[time=1495] You know I bet there are some of you here in the room this morning and you can identify with what she's saying.
[time=1503] Some of the questions that she asks about a life of worship, maybe those questions resonate inside of you as you hear them come out of her mouth.
[time=1513] Our hope is that today we can help clear some of that up and help you understand what it really looks like when you and I are really willing to embrace this idea of exaltation and living a life of worship.
[time=1531] So let's do that. Why don't you just take your Bibles and you can open them up to Romans chapter 12 and we'll get there in just a second.
[time=1542] As we begin today, a five-week look at these very, very important spiritual pursuits, these biblical mandates, these opportunities that God gives us to live out our faith, these five Es.
[time=1556] And I want to back up a bit because any discussion about these five Es here at Blackhawk always needs to begin with us reminding ourselves, you and I just taken a real quick but real honest look at why it is that we do what we do.
[time=1571] God's word, as we've said before, is absolutely stacked. It's full of passages and verses and truth that declare for us what our mission is.
[time=1582] Matthew 28, Acts 1, we see it in many places. God has left you here. God has left us here as the body of Christ to do one thing.
[time=1591] It's really clear. It's not a mystery. He wants us to reach a world that needs reaching and he wants us to do it with the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=1600] He wants us to do it with lives that have been transformed. The way we say it here is our reason for existence is to help seekers find and follow Christ.
[time=1609] And we mean that. It's more than a saying. It's more than something that shows up on screens. We get up every day and go to bed every night thanking God for the utter privilege of being able to be a part of that kind of endeavor, helping seeking people find and to know what it means to follow Christ.
[time=1625] And that last phrase, you know, that's really the deal. I mean, that's what we're hoping for is that he would allow us the privilege as a body, as a family, to see people, not just come to know him, not just find him and his life-giving forgiveness, but then be able to grow in their faith and really, truly become a follower of Jesus Christ.
[time=1647] And so we ask ourselves the question. We've asked it often and maybe you've wondered at times and this is where those five E's come in.
[time=1655] What does a follower of Christ look like when somebody has truly found him and now is beginning to live out and grow in their faith and they're a follower of Jesus Christ?
[time=1667] Well, what does that person do? What marks that individual's life? What are they characterized by as they live out their faith?
[time=1676] And again, there could be other principles, there could be other words chosen, we just, as a family and as a leadership, have come to really love and grow passionate about these five things.
[time=1691] Exaltation and evangelism and encouragement and equipping.
[time=1695] An excellent stewardship and please again today be reminded, please understand this, please know that this is on my heart today, this is so much more than a list of words that starts with E.
[time=1707] These biblical principles, these truths, when you're willing, whoever you are, young old in between, recently come to faith, you've known him for 30 years.
[time=1716] Single mom, single dad, young married couple, I don't care who you are, if you've come to know him and you're willing to open your life to the pursuit of these things.
[time=1724] To the pursuit of these truths, to really, genuinely embrace them, it changes you.
[time=1731] It grows you and he uses it to reach a world that desperately needs that same truth.
[time=1738] Susan, a divorced mother of four, told me recently that she's here at Blackhawk.
[time=1744] She is here and she calls this place home because of the way a co-worker conducted himself on the job, he lived a life of worship.
[time=1753] That's the phrase that we've attached to that e, exaltation, living a life of worship.
[time=1759] She tells me she's here because of a co-worker from our family who in that workplace conducted himself with integrity and character and compassion and kindness.
[time=1770] I know about a waitress from across town that now calls Blackhawk home because two gals from our church who would eat lunch at this restaurant week after week after week finally chose to see every encounter as a divine appointment, which is the phrase we attach to evangelism.
[time=1789] You and I being willing to see every single encounter, however it might happen, however it might come to pass as not a mistake, not chance, not fate, but a divinely orchestrated appointment for you and I to point someone towards faith.
[time=1805] And these two gals at that restaurant finally figured that out and began to ask questions and began to build a friendship and began to establish trust.
[time=1815] And a sweet gal from across town now calls this place home.
[time=1821] I know it was struggling, hurting couple.
[time=1824] On the brink of becoming another tragic bitter marital statistic who recently found love and strength, encouragement, the truth spoken in kindness and the joy that comes with hope, all of it in a small group, where they were encouraged.
[time=1839] Encouragement, authentic living, and biblical community.
[time=1847] I know a seeking couple, this is great.
[time=1850] A seeking couple who have been here for just over a year and a half, for a year and a half.
[time=1858] And we talked about a little while ago, for a year and a half now they've been coming and for about 12 months, for just about a year, a little over a year.
[time=1867] They came Sunday after Sunday after Sunday after Sunday, never missed a week.
[time=1872] And they sit right back there in the back.
[time=1875] And we laugh because they said that they would drag themselves in to the 1045 service.
[time=1881] After who knows what on a Saturday night, but you know what, they came once and this, the word of God began to speak to their hearts.
[time=1887] And it began to do what only it can do and that has drawn individual to the realization of who Jesus Christ is and what He did and how much He loves.
[time=1896] And so they kept coming and they kept coming and they kept coming and they kept coming.
[time=1901] Equipping a willingness to position yourself in a place where you can hear the word of God again and again and again.
[time=1910] So that having heard it, you can then go and give it and this couple comes to faith just a few months ago.
[time=1917] Fully surrenders their hearts and lives to Him and just found out recently they're beginning now to serve in our family.
[time=1927] The excellent stewardship, I've talked to many of you who in recent days have finally decided to really trust Him with your giving and your time.
[time=1934] Giving T-squared, T-2 as we say back to Him, time and treasure, time and treasure, as much of it as He leads you to give Him, as much of it as you're willing to trust Him with.
[time=1946] And we see what it's doing in our church.
[time=1950] The understanding of these five things, the embracing, the pursuit of these five truths, it changes you, it changes me and it speaks volumes to a world that watches.
[time=1962] So this morning let's jump in, what's a Christ follower?
[time=1965] What's a true follower of Christ they are growing in, they are growing in.
[time=1970] They haven't arrived but they're growing in number one, exaltation.
[time=1974] Exaltation, let's look at it, the word define simply means this, the act of raising high.
[time=1979] The act of raising high, to elevate, to honor and magnify, to praise, to offer praise, the act of raising high.
[time=1989] It's the very thing Paul has in mind.
[time=1991] When he writes these words in Romans chapter 12, are you still there? Romans 12, look at verse 1, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, Romans, and then back toward the back of Romans chapter 12.
[time=2002] If you don't have a Bible it's okay, you can look on with somebody else or follow along on the screen.
[time=2008] It's the same thing Paul has in mind when he says in Romans 12 1, "I urge you, warden Greek means to beg, to plead, Paul, it's this important to him."
[time=2016] He says, "I beg you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies." They had already presented their minds, their souls had already been given in the act of regeneration and the act of them coming to faith.
[time=2030] They had given their spirit to him.
[time=2032] Now he says, "Bodies as well, to make it a complete offering.
[time=2036] Present your bodies," he says, "a living and holy sacrifice." Acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship.
[time=2045] You know what that says?
[time=2047] This verse says that God is exalted.
[time=2049] This verse says that God is worshiped when we surrender, bringing all of our lives to him.
[time=2057] Don't miss that. All of us, all of you, all of me, us being brought to us, you and I being offered to him.
[time=2069] I cannot tell you how many conversations I have with people, how many emails and face-to-faces where I sit with discouraged and defeated Christ followers.
[time=2079] And time and time again, they want the same thing and they almost say it the same way and it goes something like this.
[time=2085] "What am I lacking?" they say.
[time=2087] "What am I missing?" Because you see, they're convinced that there's something more of God they need.
[time=2094] There's something more from him that they want.
[time=2096] How can I somehow receive?
[time=2098] How can I somehow get more from God is the essence of what they cry out for.
[time=2104] And they forget, as I do at times, what it says in Ephesians 1, that you and I have been blessed with.
[time=2110] How many? Every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places.
[time=2116] You see, if you know him today, there isn't anything left for him to give.
[time=2121] He has given you in relationship with him everything there is to give.
[time=2125] And you see, the issue in what we see here in Romans 12 is that true lasting spiritual peace isn't found in our efforts to extract more from God but is instead realized in giving, in offering, in surrendering.
[time=2139] All that we are, all that we do, all that we have to him.
[time=2143] Here you go.
[time=2144] All of the time.
[time=2149] Spiritual peace.
[time=2151] You want that lasting sense of contentment?
[time=2153] You want to somehow move through the struggles and the frustrations that sometimes you and I face.
[time=2160] The answer is not to get more from God.
[time=2164] You know what?
[time=2165] Obviously.
[time=2167] And I'll just turn this around on me, okay?
[time=2171] And if it sounds familiar, or if you've ever bumped into it in yourself, then you can identify.
[time=2178] And I see it with the folks that I talk to, but you know what?
[time=2180] I'll just keep it with me.
[time=2182] Sometimes.
[time=2183] I'll strike that.
[time=2184] Oftentimes.
[time=2185] When I find myself in that mode.
[time=2189] What I'm feeling is if you know what would really be nice is if I could just get a little bit more from you to help me out here.
[time=2196] Oftentimes if you were to look into my heart, I mean really into my heart at those times what you would find to my embarrassment and shame or oftentimes little pockets of compromise.
[time=2208] Little areas of willful disobedience.
[time=2213] The arenas of pride.
[time=2218] If you look real close into my heart at times when I'm wanting so much more from him what you'll find is partial surrender.
[time=2228] Partial.
[time=2230] We sometimes want so much more from him, but won't give him all.
[time=2236] All.
[time=2238] Of us.
[time=2239] He says bring as an act of worship.
[time=2242] He says bring me every bit of you.
[time=2246] All that you have.
[time=2249] All of the time.
[time=2252] And that he says is a life of worship.
[time=2254] Hebrews 13, 15.
[time=2255] Turn back to the back of your New Testament.
[time=2258] Let's track this thought through the pages of Scripture.
[time=2261] Hebrews 13, 15.
[time=2263] Go back to the back.
[time=2264] You get to James you went too far just after Philemon.
[time=2268] Hebrews 13.
[time=2271] There it is.
[time=2272] Hebrews 13, 15.
[time=2275] Hebrews 13, 15 says this.
[time=2278] You see it there?
[time=2279] It says through him.
[time=2280] Hebrews 13, 15.
[time=2281] Through him then.
[time=2282] Let us.
[time=2283] There's the word.
[time=2284] Continually.
[time=2285] Through him then.
[time=2286] Let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God.
[time=2291] That is the fruit of lips that give thanks to his name.
[time=2294] Psalm 34.
[time=2295] You don't have to turn there.
[time=2296] Let me just read it to you.
[time=2297] Psalm 34 one says I will bless the Lord at all times.
[time=2302] All the time.
[time=2304] Not just here.
[time=2306] No the psalmist says I will bless the Lord at all times.
[time=2309] His praise shall continually be in my mouth.
[time=2314] Through him then.
[time=2315] Hebrews 13.
[time=2316] Let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise.
[time=2320] All right here you go.
[time=2321] Let's just be real honest.
[time=2323] Let's just bring the cookies right down to the bottom shelf.
[time=2325] What do you say?
[time=2329] Let's just think about this.
[time=2331] You have an opportunity and I have an opportunity.
[time=2334] God's word says to offer him worship all the time.
[time=2339] So if that's the case then it's possible for you to offer him worship in your room at night alone with the remote.
[time=2349] That can be an act of worship or an act of disobedience.
[time=2358] You can worship him.
[time=2360] You can lift him high.
[time=2362] You can magnify and bring honor to him in the airport bookstore 2,000 miles away from home where no one knows who you are or at least who you're supposed to be.
[time=2376] It's an opportunity right there to offer up an act of worship to live a life in the everyday of life that honors him to run as fast as you can away from that bookstore down the terminal till we're out to McDonald's.
[time=2395] More sin there but not quite the same sin.
[time=2397] So just get out of the bookstore maybe.
[time=2401] It's an act of worship.
[time=2404] It's an act of worship to do the dishes.
[time=2408] Guys, instead of just complaining.
[time=2413] Hey, where all these dishes come from?
[time=2415] What's the deal with all the dishes?
[time=2417] Somebody going to come do it?
[time=2420] It's an act of worship sometimes guys in the everyday of life to just do the dishes.
[time=2425] Don't do it like that, sorry.
[time=2427] Do the dishes.
[time=2429] With a really grateful heart that you got people in your house to make dirty dishes.
[time=2436] It's an act of worship when you pay your bills on time or go to great lengths to make sure you communicate with those who you owe the money to let them know you're going to pay the bill.
[time=2446] It's an act of worship.
[time=2448] You know what, this is going to hurt a little bit but I'll just go ahead and say these next two.
[time=2452] It is an act of worship.
[time=2453] Oh, there's the possibility for an act of worship and the way you conduct yourself in a drive-through line.
[time=2461] The way you talk is talking to Mitch about it this week.
[time=2464] The way you talk to that person and that little interchange there at the microphone and then the way you talk to them when you get to the window and they haven't got it right again.
[time=2475] The way you look at them and the way you talk to them.
[time=2480] Every encounter, a divine appointment.
[time=2483] You know what, this is going to hurt.
[time=2485] I believe it's an act of worship the way you conduct yourself with a telemarketer.
[time=2489] Ouch.
[time=2492] Okay, let's move on.
[time=2495] You know what, you have no idea.
[time=2497] Just be careful with that.
[time=2499] You don't have to engage in a long conversation.
[time=2502] I'm not saying you've got to buy anything.
[time=2505] But you have no idea who that gal is.
[time=2508] You have no idea what has led her to do that job.
[time=2512] You have no idea how many mouths she has to feed you.
[time=2515] You have no idea what her life circumstances, none.
[time=2519] Be kind.
[time=2523] Your response, it's an opportunity for an act of worship.
[time=2526] You know, your response to your complaining whining five-year-old who didn't take off his mud-covered boots and wants help from you desperately while the buzzer on the stove blares, the phone rings, and your other two precious gifts are in the back beating each other senseless.
[time=2543] Your response to that five-year-old in that moment has the capacity to be an act of worship.
[time=2550] It doesn't have to be harsh.
[time=2553] You and I can learn to laugh and be to a five-year-old who's whining and covered with mud, a picture of self-control and perspective that sees beyond
[time=2567] immediate frustrations.
[time=2570] It's an act of worship.
[time=2572] He's lifted high and honored when you don't click on the website.
[time=2579] When you just say no, and go click on, go take yourself, go do something else.
[time=2586] Get up out of the seat.
[time=2591] And I'm not just talking to the guys.
[time=2594] Whether it's a guy in a site that you have no business being at or a gal in a chat room where you're sharing things and saying things and offering things and establishing stuff you have no business offering, saying or establishing.
[time=2609] It's an act of worship.
[time=2612] Some of you may think it unnecessary to address this, but you know what, if you sat with me over a given span of time, you'd know that it's necessary.
[time=2622] And I just offer it to you, whoever it may apply to just as a reminder.
[time=2626] I believe it's an act of worship when a young couple or older couple who have met each other and fallen in love and decided to get married.
[time=2638] And you sit down that night at the table in the living room and you realize that financially there's a great deal of money to be saved in the nine months of your engagement if you'll just what?
[time=2652] Live together.
[time=2655] And all of a sudden the wheel starts spinning.
[time=2658] You know, and all of a sudden the ration outcomes, it's just a financial thing.
[time=2664] It's not like we're going to, well, share you well.
[time=2670] Of course you will.
[time=2672] And everybody who knows you will assume that you will.
[time=2677] It's an act of worship to say no to saving how many hundreds of dollars to honor God when He says you know what?
[time=2683] The physical relationship was designed for marriage, period.
[time=2688] And not only do you dishonor me when you go there, but you dishonor each other.
[time=2695] It's an act of worship when we're willing to be the people God's called us to be.
[time=2700] All of you, one last time.
[time=2702] All of you.
[time=2703] All that you do.
[time=2705] All of the time to honor Him.
[time=2708] How have we missed it?
[time=2710] We've missed it.
[time=2711] Just briefly, we've missed it because we've made worship about the 60 minutes we spend here on Sundays.
[time=2716] You understand that?
[time=2717] We have erroneously, and in a very detrimental way, we have kind of communicated to people that what takes place in this room is worship.
[time=2726] We've reduced worship to 60 or 70 minutes when the fact that the matter is that He's called you and I to a life 24/7 of honoring Him.
[time=2737] And I want to just say this to you, look at 1 Corinthians 14.
[time=2740] 1 Corinthians 14 is an amazing chapter.
[time=2743] And in this chapter He's talking about, I want to just go ahead and talk to you just for a couple minutes about what takes place in here.
[time=2750] And then we're going to get back to this life of worship.
[time=2753] But hey, just for a moment, can we just talk about what happens in here?
[time=2756] 1 Corinthians 14, Paul's talking about the way the body gathers and the things that are going on in the service as this thing takes place.
[time=2764] And He's telling Him, He's warning them.
[time=2766] He's talking about tongues, for instance, in the previous verses.
[time=2769] And He says, "Be careful because of an unbeliever.
[time=2772] If somebody's still searching, trying to figure this faith thing out walks in." And He sees an entire room of people speaking in tongues.
[time=2779] They're going to be confused and think you're mad.
[time=2782] But He says if what they walk into is a body of believers gathered given to prophecy, the proclaiming of God's truth, the proclaiming of it in song,
[time=2792] the proclaiming of it in word and message.
[time=2795] If what that person encounters is a genuine and passionate experience of the body of Christ gathered to lift up His name, look what happens.
[time=2804] But if all prophesies and an unbeliever or an ungifted man enters, He is convicted by all He is called to an account by all.
[time=2815] The secrets of His heart are disclosed.
[time=2819] So He will fall on His face and worship God, declaring that God is certainly among you.
[time=2828] Just somebody, just coming in off the street, should be able to walk into a body, walk into a gathering of a body of believers.
[time=2836] And what He or she senses, what He or she sees, what He or she experiences,
[time=2843] as that body of believers, saved and redeemed, come together, has the power
[time=2852] to absolutely draw that individual to their face and to the throne of Christ.
[time=2860] And so I just want to remind you again, if you once in a while, I think it's okay to just remind you.
[time=2865] And I want to just say this to those of you who know Him.
[time=2868] I want to just say this to those of you here today who are saved.
[time=2872] He spiritually CPR'd you, right?
[time=2874] You were dead, Ephesians 2.
[time=2876] You were a corpse.
[time=2877] He brought you to life.
[time=2880] And I just want to remind you again, if you've been redeemed, if you've been bought off the block because of His great love and mercy,
[time=2889] then you know that you've been blessed with life.
[time=2892] You've been forgiven all your sin past, present and future.
[time=2896] You've been made new.
[time=2897] You've been brought through countless crises, protected from harm.
[time=2901] He's been given you heaven instead of hell.
[time=2904] He has given you life today with purpose and meaning.
[time=2907] He's watched over your family.
[time=2908] He's brought comfort and peace to your loss.
[time=2910] He brings direction and clarity to your confusion.
[time=2913] He grows you in the grace and knowledge of His Word.
[time=2915] He gives you friends to share and walk through life with.
[time=2918] He gives you food.
[time=2919] He gives you shelter.
[time=2920] He gives you comfort.
[time=2921] He gives you life when what you and I deserved was death.
[time=2924] And so every once in a while, again, if you're saved here today, every once in a while, I just want to remind you to sing like it.
[time=2932] To look like it.
[time=2935] To act like it.
[time=2937] To be together in this place when we come through those doors with the reality of that in view.
[time=2944] To walk into a place like this and be so completely amazed and so thoroughly blown away that that's who He is and that's what He did and you're the recipient of that.
[time=2955] How could you not but come into a room like this?
[time=2961] And want to offer Him passionate, expressive, personal thanks.
[time=2968] And no, you don't have to do it just like me or just like whoever.
[time=2974] But how can you come into this room saved with your arms folded in your
[time=2980] mouth shut?
[time=2983] I don't get it.
[time=2984] Sometimes it confuses me.
[time=2987] Why does that happen?
[time=2990] Why do sometimes saved, redeemed, blessed, loved, cared for people sit
[time=2998] and pews just like this on their hands with expressionless faces
[time=3008] and barely open their mouths?
[time=3013] I don't know.
[time=3014] I thought about it.
[time=3015] Sometimes I think it's because some people aren't really passionately grateful.
[time=3022] Maybe you've been doing this for a long, long time and maybe you're a little dead inside.
[time=3028] At some point I would wish for you a remembering of who He is and what He's done and the reality of what that means for you.
[time=3039] My hope would be that your heart would maybe stir again.
[time=3044] Others of you are afraid, insecure, wondering what some might think if
[time=3051] you actually obeyed the Bible and put an ear to ear smile on your face,
[time=3057] lifted a hand of praise and gratitude and shouted for joy.
[time=3061] Because that's what He says you're to do.
[time=3063] But we sometimes worry about what the person behind us or in front of us might think if we actually obeyed the Bible and walked into this room and looked at the heavens and said, "Wow, thank you so much.
[time=3076] Let me sing like it.
[time=3078] Let me act like it." Well, there are 167 other hours in a given week.
[time=3085] That's true.
[time=3086] I think what takes place in that hour and what takes place in those 167 hours is incredibly important.
[time=3091] And He calls us to live lives of worship.
[time=3093] So how can we more fully embrace it?
[time=3095] Let me just give you this and we'll be on our way.
[time=3097] Please don't miss this.
[time=3099] It's on your bulletin, on the tear out section.
[time=3101] You want to just tear that off and look at it and write a few things down as I explain this to you.
[time=3104] I'd love you to.
[time=3105] But please, if you don't get anything from today, just tune in right here and let's give this a try.
[time=3110] What do you say?
[time=3111] Would you do this?
[time=3112] Would you commit to this week giving yourselves to more fully embracing.
[time=3116] I don't care who you are, how old you are, how long you've been around.
[time=3120] If you know Him, let's give this a shot.
[time=3122] You want to live a life of worship, number one, stop at nothing.
[time=3125] What do you say this week?
[time=3126] You just give it a seven day shot.
[time=3128] Stop at absolutely nothing.
[time=3131] I mean, get as aggressive as you need to get.
[time=3133] Get as bold as you might want to get.
[time=3136] But give it a shot.
[time=3137] Stop at nothing to start each day with Him this week.
[time=3141] And I wrote down there 10-10-2-20.
[time=3143] You've heard you've seen the red haired crazy dude on TV with the telephone commercial.
[time=3147] You hear it all the time, 10-10-2-20.
[time=3149] Okay, we got our own twist on that.
[time=3150] All right, watch this.
[time=3151] Write this down.
[time=3152] Just do a 10-10-2-20 this week.
[time=3154] 10 minutes, set the alarm, get up, stop at nothing.
[time=3159] If that means 5-30, do it.
[time=3162] If that means 7, if that means 8, if it means 8, get a life.
[time=3168] But if it means like before 8, come on, do it now, all right?
[time=3173] First 10, spend 10 minutes in the book of Psalms.
[time=3176] Go ahead, write that down.
[time=3177] Just open up your Bible to the book of Psalms.
[time=3179] You can start at chapter 1 and just start reading for 10 minutes.
[time=3184] Read in the book of Psalms.
[time=3186] You can read a chapter.
[time=3188] You can read 5 verses over and over again.
[time=3190] You can do it however you want to do it.
[time=3191] But grab a pen and something to write on.
[time=3193] And as you find things in there that you don't get, write it down.
[time=3197] If you come across a phrase that you really get and it kind of brings you a sense of excitement because you understand it's circle.
[time=3203] You know, 10 minutes in the book of Psalms.
[time=3206] After 10 minutes, do the same thing in the book of Proverbs.
[time=3209] The book of Psalms often speaks to the heart.
[time=3212] It's a book full of worship and praise.
[time=3214] The book of Proverbs often speaks to the everyday issues of life.
[time=3218] 10 minutes read through the book of Proverbs.
[time=3221] Pick a chapter or 5 or 6 verses and write down things you don't get in circle stuff you're really excited about.
[time=3227] And then take two minutes.
[time=3229] We're up to 12 minutes.
[time=3232] Take two minutes, close your Bible and close your notebook and pray everything you just read
[time=3238] and thought about.
[time=3239] Just pray it back to him.
[time=3241] Ask him for help to live it out in your life.
[time=3244] Ask him for clarity on things that are confusing.
[time=3246] Ask him for forgiveness where you've been convicted of sin.
[time=3249] And then you know what?
[time=3251] 20.
[time=3252] Take the 20 seconds that it's...
[time=3257] Take the 20 seconds that are going to be required here to lean over and set your alarm again
[time=3263] and do the very same thing the next day.
[time=3269] 10, 10, 2, 20.
[time=3270] I don't know if that's like a copyright thing, so don't tell anybody that we're doing this as far as like, you know, the phone companies or stuff.
[time=3277] And then take this.
[time=3278] Take five seconds.
[time=3279] This is a great one.
[time=3280] I learned this from Mitch in a message he did a while ago and I've heard him talk about it since.
[time=3284] Take five seconds.
[time=3288] Try this.
[time=3289] Take five seconds prior to each new endeavor.
[time=3293] All right?
[time=3294] You're starting the carpool.
[time=3296] Okay?
[time=3297] You're starting the baths at night.
[time=3299] You're starting work.
[time=3301] You're walking into a meeting.
[time=3304] You're going to answer a very important phone call.
[time=3306] It's just at the transition point throughout the day and there are hundreds of them.
[time=3310] Would you, just this week, just take five seconds.
[time=3314] And at that moment, just offer this up to him.
[time=3317] Give me a way to honor you in this.
[time=3320] Whatever it might be, as simple or as complicated.
[time=3325] Five seconds to live a life of worship.
[time=3327] A prayer that says, "God, give me away somehow in the midst of this to bring honor to you, to lift you high, to magnify you." And then lastly, take five minutes.
[time=3338] And you know what?
[time=3339] You could take more.
[time=3340] I'm just trying to, a lot of you in here have your routines and that's wonderful.
[time=3344] Just stay at it.
[time=3346] We're just trying to help some folks here who maybe don't have a routine.
[time=3351] So just take five minutes at the end of that day and get on your knees.
[time=3356] And you know what I mean that.
[time=3357] I'm not saying that figuratively.
[time=3359] I would encourage you to get on your knees at that chair or next to your bed or wherever it might be.
[time=3365] Hopefully not in front of the TV.
[time=3369] Get on your knees and thank him.
[time=3371] Thank him for what he's been teaching you.
[time=3373] Thank him for what he showed you.
[time=3374] Thank you for what he brought your way as you gave yourself to a life of worship.
[time=3378] Why should we do all this?
[time=3380] I'm going to keep telling you this.
[time=3381] We're going to keep drawing your hearts and your attention back to this.
[time=3384] Why?
[time=3385] Why do all this?
[time=3386] I think it'll be on the screen.
[time=3388] Why do all this?
[time=3390] Number four, what it would say if it came on the screen is basically this.
[time=3394] The reason we talk about this, the reason we do all this is because when you embrace it,
[time=3400] when you see that it's way, way, way more than just a bunch of words that start with E, when we need the church, live lives of worship.
[time=3409] God is glorified.
[time=3411] That's the first and main reason.
[time=3413] And that's what he's left us here to do, to bring glory to him.
[time=3417] And when you do this, you glorify him.
[time=3420] When you do this, when you live a life of worship, God is glorified.
[time=3424] A searching world finds hope in the hearts of Christ's followers who have grown.
[time=3428] And that's what we're trying to be about.
[time=3431] If we could help anybody here today, think this stuff through a little bit more.
[time=3436] If there's somebody here and you'd really like to talk about knowing him, moving from
[time=3442] maybe knowing about him to knowing him personally, we've got some folks down here who would love to talk with you.
[time=3447] Visitors, we'd love to meet you and put a name to a face.
[time=3450] But the family of Blackah, please, come back next week.
[time=3454] Jump in here with us and think through these things over the next five weeks as we consider the kind of church and the kind of people that we want to be.
[time=3461] Would you stand with me and let's pray.
[time=3465] Hey, don't forget as well that we need these green sheets in here soon.
[time=3468] We're continuing to make a dent in this children's ministry need.
[time=3473] So please get these filled out and turned in, and thank you so much for being here today.
[time=3478] Pray with me.
[time=3479] Would you, Father, as we leave, our prayer would be, God, that we would be a people, that we
[time=3486] would be men and women and moms and dads, that we would be young professionals, students,
[time=3492] God, whoever's in this room that knows you, that we would walk out of these doors, at
[time=3498] least willing to respond to the truth of Romans 12 and live a life of worship, offering our
[time=3505] bodies.
[time=3506] Our hearts, our souls and our minds, God, to you at every turn.
[time=3509] And that's a daunting thought, but, God, we know that you're ready and willing to help us in that endeavor as are others and your spirit.
[time=3518] And so, God, we give ourselves to that, and we pray for the strength needed to be a people that really live lives of worship.
[time=3523] And God, please bring us back next week, as we continue to look at these five Es, and
[time=3529] as we continue to look at your word and the kind of church that we want to be to help a world that really, really needs help, in your son's name we pray, and they all agreed and said, amen.
[time=3540] Hey, we'll see you soon.
[time=3541] Take care.
[time=3542] God, forever, forever, forever, forever in our baseball, forever in our baseball, forever
[time=3557] in our baseball, forever, forever.
[time=3572] [AMEN]
[time=3602] [BLANK_AUDIO]
