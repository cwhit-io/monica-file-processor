[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=30] (upbeat music)
[time=60] - As you give, and give cheerfully, we want to sing this song.
[time=76] That is just a reflection of praise to God.
[time=79] I think you know the words, if not, I'm sure you'll learn them quickly.
[time=82] And let's sing this together.
[time=85] [MUSIC - 371 seconds]
[time=461] Just remind you what it says in Psalm 46.
[time=464] Maybe you want to bow your heads just for a moment.
[time=471] Listen to God's word.
[time=472] It says, "God is our refuge and strength.
[time=476] A very present help in trouble.
[time=481] Therefore we will not fear, though the earth should change, and though the mountains slip into the heart of the sea, though its waters roar and foam, though the mountains quake at its swelling pride."
[time=496] "See striving," he says, "and know that I am God.
[time=500] I will be exalted among the nations.
[time=502] I will be exalted in the earth.
[time=504] The Lord of hosts is with us.
[time=507] The God of Jacob is our stronghold.
[time=512] Blessed be the name.
[time=515] Blessed be the name of the Lord." God and Father this morning, that is our cry of worship and praise to you.
[time=526] And we come today first and foremost, God, to celebrate you.
[time=532] God, to thank you for who you are and the sacrifice that you were willing to make so that we could have life with you.
[time=540] God, we come into this place to open up your word, to lift our praise to the heavens, to be reminded of your great love and devotion.
[time=551] And God, our prayer is that as we do that, you would be honored and we would be changed.
[time=557] And God, we come as well to celebrate fathers.
[time=561] And for many in the room this morning, that's a sweet occasion.
[time=565] God, there are great memories, a godly investment that's been made.
[time=570] God, many come into this room today so incredibly grateful for that man,
[time=576] what he did, who he was, the way he did.
[time=582] And God, others here in the room this morning face a picture that's not quite as sweet.
[time=587] God, the memories aren't quite as bright, investment, not quite as deep.
[time=595] And how grateful we are, Father, that we can.
[time=598] From one end of that picture to the other, we can come before the heavenly Father
[time=605] of love and grace, devotion.
[time=609] And you have loved the Fatherless so faithfully.
[time=614] And God, there may even be some here today that don't know you yet.
[time=619] They've lived without an earthly Father and maybe today, maybe today.
[time=625] They would see what it could be like to know and live in relationship with you.
[time=632] God, we come from all walks of life, different places on our spiritual journeys,
[time=640] but know that we come today in our heart to honor you.
[time=644] Teach us, grow us, challenge us in whatever way you need to.
[time=648] In your son's name we pray.
[time=651] [AMEN - 4 seconds]
[time=658] Well, dads, we want to do our very best today to honor you.
[time=661] We are so thankful for you and who you are and what you do.
[time=665] And we realize there's nobody in the room here today that's arrived.
[time=669] Your fathering journey like mine is still full of difficulties at times,
[time=675] challenges and mistakes, but we come together as dads wanting to be challenged, wanting to be encouraged, wanting to be reminded maybe today as to how it is that we could honor God and our kids.
[time=686] And so we invite you to this discussion, the legacy you can write it down, the legacy left by a dad.
[time=693] The legacy left by a dad.
[time=695] Hey, dads, a legacy is simply this.
[time=697] We got it on the screen for you. You can write it down and hopefully this picture will kind of stay with you as we make our way through this discussion this morning.
[time=705] A legacy, dads, is what they remember most about us.
[time=709] It's what they remember most about us.
[time=713] It's what gets passed down, dads, like it or not.
[time=717] And every father who's ever lived has left one.
[time=722] Every father who has ever lived has left a legacy.
[time=727] They're remembered for something. Something gets passed down.
[time=730] Some are remembered for their sacrifice.
[time=735] Some fathers are remembered for their legacy of kindness and devotion.
[time=741] Other fathers are despised.
[time=746] Other fathers are not remembered for a legacy of love, but instead a legacy of cruelty or greed or selfish ambition, even passive uninvolvement.
[time=759] If you have children today, the question isn't will you leave a legacy?
[time=763] The question is, dads, what kind of legacy are you leaving?
[time=767] What kind of legacy will you leave?
[time=769] And here's a great point to make right here.
[time=771] God has given every one of us as dads the opportunity to make a godly investment.
[time=777] Every dad in this room, no matter who you are, no matter where you come from, no matter what your history has been like, no matter what you have endured, no matter what has been propagated upon you, no matter what the picture looks like, no matter how much of this you know or how little every dad in this room has
[time=798] been given the opportunity.
[time=800] You have been given the privilege.
[time=802] And you have within you the capacity with his help to make
[time=808] a godly, god honoring investment in the lives of that little one
[time=815] or those little ones that he's given you.
[time=818] There may be some other room this morning going, you know what that sounds like a million miles away.
[time=823] You don't know me.
[time=824] You don't know where I've been.
[time=825] You don't know my habits.
[time=827] You don't know what mistakes I've already made.
[time=831] And that's the beauty of what we see here today.
[time=834] It's the beauty of what those of us that know him get reminded of every day is that every day is a new day.
[time=842] And today you have, no matter who you are, you have the opportunity to realize maybe for the first time that you can with his help leave a legacy, a legacy that is marked by love, grace and acceptance.
[time=857] The choice is yours.
[time=858] There's two ways we can go on this.
[time=860] A legacy of resentment and lost opportunity.
[time=863] Kind of our two main points this morning that we're going to talk about and try and unfold some truth from.
[time=868] A legacy of resentment and lost opportunity or secondly, a legacy of love, grace and acceptance.
[time=875] And I mean what I say that the choice is yours.
[time=878] And there is on this front, guys, there's really not a lot of middle ground.
[time=885] You're engaged right now in the process of pretty much doing one or the other.
[time=891] And I want us to just look at the scriptures this morning and take a look at both.
[time=896] And let's start on the downside of that picture and we'll work our way back up.
[time=900] Okay, let's look first at a legacy of resentment.
[time=903] A legacy of resentment and lost opportunity.
[time=907] A few years ago, I sat down with a 12-year-old boy.
[time=912] I sat there with a 12-year-old boy who told me this and I quote, "I hate my dad and I hope he burns in hell." It's a 12-year-old boy and he looked me right in the eye and with real passion
[time=930] and with real energy told me he hated his dad and hoped in the end.
[time=936] That his dad would burn in hell.
[time=940] "Why's that?" I said.
[time=942] And note the progression of his response, note where he begins.
[time=947] And I just kind of captured it all here as best I could, word for word.
[time=951] "Why's that? Why do you hate your dad?
[time=953] Why do you hope your dad burns in hell?" Well, I'll tell you what he said, he's never home.
[time=961] Man, I'm thinking.
[time=963] I might have been expecting something else to be right up there at the top, guys.
[time=970] But the first thing out of this 12-year-old's mouth is he's never home.
[time=974] And when he is, you can tell he wishes he wasn't.
[time=978] He yells at my mom a lot.
[time=981] He yells at my sisters and he yells at me.
[time=986] He went on to say, "We never talk about normal things."
[time=992] Think about that for a second.
[time=994] What would a 12-year-old boy consider normal in his longing to have a conversation with his dad?
[time=1006] He says, "We never talk about normal things." His cell phone is always on and he's mean to us.
[time=1016] This was very telling.
[time=1018] He's nicer to his friends and his clients than he is to us.
[time=1023] I hate my dad and I hope he burns in hell.
[time=1028] I remember sitting there that day and I remember thinking back on that conversation in the weeks
[time=1034] that transpired, thinking there is an angry young man, 12, and already seething with resentment
[time=1045] and bitterness.
[time=1047] And yes, some of what he was saying and the way in which he was saying it, some of that stuff
[time=1054] was a little out of, you know, so yeah, I was trying to encourage the young boy as well.
[time=1060] But the facts were unavoidable.
[time=1063] He was angry and it says in Ephesians 6, 4, and you can turn there.
[time=1067] If you've got your Bibles, I'm sitting there talking to this 12-year-old who's absolutely seething with anger.
[time=1075] And I'm reminded of what it says to dads in God's Word, where it says in Ephesians chapter 6, verse 4, "And fathers do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the
[time=1089] discipline and instruction of the Lord." And later here in our talk this morning, we'll get to the last part of that verse where it talks about bringing them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord, but focus if you would with me at that first statement.
[time=1104] "And fathers, do not provoke your children to anger."
[time=1110] In this context of Paul's letter to the Ephesian church, the idea of provoking suggests
[time=1117] this, and I just wrote it down so you could just write it down as I say it.
[time=1121] Provoking a repeated pattern, write that down, a repeated pattern of treatment that gradually
[time=1128] builds a repeated pattern of treatment that gradually builds toward a deep-seated anger
[time=1135] and resentment.
[time=1137] A deep-seated anger and resentment that will in time, it may be when they're seven, it may
[time=1143] be when they're twelve, it might be when they're twenty, but the idea here in this context,
[time=1149] as Paul uses this phrase, it's a pattern of treatment that gradually builds toward a deep-seated
[time=1156] anger and resentment that will in time erupt.
[time=1159] It will come out.
[time=1161] It will come out verbally.
[time=1163] It may come out physically.
[time=1164] It may come out emotionally.
[time=1168] Verbally, I hate my dad.
[time=1170] Physically, I'd like to take his head off.
[time=1173] Emotionally, I could care less about him.
[time=1177] Mentally, I don't even acknowledge him.
[time=1182] And we see little bits and pieces of this.
[time=1185] Sometimes at four and five, sometimes at ten and twelve, but it's there.
[time=1193] Colossians 3.21, turn over just a few more books in your New Testament there.
[time=1198] Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, look with me at the text there in Colossians
[time=1204] 3, Colossians 3, verse 21.
[time=1213] Verse 18 says, "Wives, be subject to your husbands." Verse 19, "Husbands, love your wives." Children, verse 20, be obedient to your parents and all things.
[time=1223] Here you go, verse 21.
[time=1225] "Fathers, do not exasperate your children." Now hang on, watch this.
[time=1235] "They may not lose heart." You ever think about that?
[time=1240] You ever consider the last part of that phrase?
[time=1243] He says to fathers, "Don't exasperate them because you wouldn't want them to lose heart." Would you?
[time=1249] That phrase, "lose heart." When you kind of just dissect that and take it in the original language, it means to be without courage or spirit.
[time=1258] Dads, God's words reminding you and me today that we have the capacity with the way we talk
[time=1264] and the way we conduct and carry ourselves.
[time=1266] We have it within us to strip, to rip out the hearts of our kids.
[time=1274] To leave them without courage and without spirit.
[time=1279] Because of a manner within which we've walked or talked or chosen or acted.
[time=1287] Well, I won't speak for you, but when I read these words and when I consider these truths, the first place I go and the thing I would love for us to consider this morning is, "Okay, so how do we do that?
[time=1298] How is it that we at times as fathers?" And moms, let me just say this to you.
[time=1305] I realize in our discussion today there may be some overlap.
[time=1310] I suppose in many respects what I say to fathers, you know, we would just want to say to parents.
[time=1317] Yet I do sense, as I know many of you do, because of what this tells us.
[time=1322] I sense a great deal of responsibility.
[time=1325] A great privilege has been given to me as a father and to you men as fathers.
[time=1330] To run point in a loving, caring way on these endeavors.
[time=1336] Moms, yes, there's some things here for you to consider, but dads understand this morning.
[time=1341] God has given you the responsibility.
[time=1343] Some of you ladies may be without that kind of help in your situation.
[time=1348] So you have the opportunity and it's an opportunity that he is willing to come alongside you in.
[time=1354] So much of this may be for you having to be applied today on your own, either way.
[time=1360] These are truths and these are the things that we must consider.
[time=1364] How is it that we provoke our kids?
[time=1368] What does that exasperating look like?
[time=1372] And we could go for hours and hours on this.
[time=1375] And I've had a great time, really.
[time=1377] It's been very convicting, it's been very insightful.
[time=1380] I've been searching the scriptures, I've been having conversations with people.
[time=1383] I've asked old, I've asked young, I've asked people in between.
[time=1387] And let me just share with you some things that we've uncovered as we've talked about and thought about this idea of what it looks like to provoke
[time=1393] so that you can be and I can be aware of it and ready to deal with it in a way that would honor him.
[time=1399] And then, number one, we provoke.
[time=1402] We provoke to anger, we frustrate and wound when we overprotect.
[time=1406] Write that down.
[time=1407] Number one, when we overprotect.
[time=1411] When we overprotect them, I've seen it again and again.
[time=1414] Overprotective parents rarely allow their kids any liberty or any freedom.
[time=1419] Rarely do you see this with dads or moms who have been in this direction.
[time=1424] There's rarely this freedom given to the child to fail.
[time=1430] And I see it from toddlers.
[time=1433] You know, I see it and again have felt it sometimes in my own life.
[time=1437] I see it with little ones.
[time=1438] I see it with a parent, a dad or a mom who just isn't going to let that little guy fall, literally.
[time=1444] They're not going to let the knee get bloody.
[time=1448] And I've seen it with 20 year olds and they're still.
[time=1451] They're just not going to let the knee get bloody.
[time=1454] They're not going to let the bad choice get made.
[time=1456] They're not going to let the shaky path.
[time=1459] They're not going to let them walk down.
[time=1460] They're just going to protect them.
[time=1462] They're going to keep the parameters tight.
[time=1464] They're going to control them.
[time=1467] They never trust them and the kid knows it.
[time=1470] And so because nothing the kid does can ever earn the trust of the dad or parent, the kid begins to despair,
[time=1476] believing in time that their behavior is irrelevant, which in time leads to rebellion.
[time=1482] Exaspiration.
[time=1485] Remember this dad's rules?
[time=1488] A lot of us dads are big on rules.
[time=1490] Remember dads, rules and guidelines.
[time=1493] Parameters are okay.
[time=1496] They're not bad.
[time=1497] They're okay as long as they're interacted with, within the context of a loving, trusting,
[time=1503] "I'll be there when you fall relationship." Does that make sense?
[time=1510] Sometimes it's hard to pull off, but I believe that's a great truth.
[time=1514] Overprotective parents at times allow rules and regulations and high expectations to become a noose
[time=1521] that many times I've seen strangle the heart, strangle the spirit right out of a kid.
[time=1528] We provoke and we overprotect.
[time=1530] What's the upside of that?
[time=1532] What's the opposite?
[time=1533] Real simple I know, but just write it down.
[time=1536] Make a mental note.
[time=1538] Don't overprotect.
[time=1540] Give them some appropriate freedoms at two, at twelve, at twenty-five.
[time=1545] I mean, whatever stage of life we're dealing with, give them, offer them some appropriate freedoms.
[time=1552] Give them a sense where you're standing there saying to them, go ahead and give it a try.
[time=1557] Let's see where it goes and know this, that wherever it goes, whatever you choose, however this thing unfolds, bottom line over and above everything else, I will be right here to pick you up.
[time=1573] It's one of the most powerful pictures I can ever imagine.
[time=1590] I'll just do it like this for you.
[time=1592] Not to wig anybody out here, but hey, Connor, come here just for a second.
[time=1595] I just thought of this.
[time=1596] Come here.
[time=1597] Came to me last hour and it's coming to me again here.
[time=1599] Just real quick, come up here.
[time=1600] How you doing, buddy?
[time=1601] Good.
[time=1602] Good to see you.
[time=1603] Turn right here.
[time=1604] It's Connor Bland.
[time=1605] Connor, just pretend like you just fell.
[time=1609] You just skinned your knee.
[time=1610] You're just down on the ground.
[time=1611] You crashed and burned.
[time=1612] Go ahead.
[time=1613] You kind of crashed nice and slow there.
[time=1615] That's good.
[time=1617] That's just cool.
[time=1618] Just stand right there.
[time=1619] Stand this.
[time=1620] Connor, how old are you, Connor?
[time=1622] He's 13.
[time=1623] Connor could be 3 in this picture.
[time=1626] Connor could be 13.
[time=1631] Connor could have fallen off the curb and skinned his knee.
[time=1635] Connor could have fallen off the grade wagon this past semester and not done so well.
[time=1641] You probably did good though, didn't you?
[time=1644] Yeah.
[time=1645] Connor may have.
[time=1648] Connor may have made a real bad decision over here, but maybe at 23 or 33 has impacted a
[time=1656] lot of lives.
[time=1659] Whether 33 or 3 are 13, you're willingness in mind, dads, to just as a pattern, reach
[time=1668] down and say, "Hey, come on, let me get you up here.
[time=1673] Boom." Right there.
[time=1678] Did you see that?
[time=1679] One more time.
[time=1680] Sit down.
[time=1681] I want him to see this.
[time=1682] I'm serious.
[time=1683] Stop right there.
[time=1686] Right there.
[time=1688] See that?
[time=1691] Right there.
[time=1693] It's all right.
[time=1694] It's not the end of the world.
[time=1696] We got a band-aid.
[time=1699] We can study more.
[time=1703] God's grace is wonderful.
[time=1706] Mine's okay, and we'll get through this.
[time=1710] Either way, that right there is a powerful, powerful picture.
[time=1715] Thanks.
[time=1716] Good job.
[time=1717] You guys can say thanks to Connor.
[time=1723] Help him up.
[time=1725] Don't over-protect.
[time=1726] Secondly, we provoke when we unreasonably push for achievement, when we unreasonably push
[time=1733] for achievement, that may get a little uncomfortable in here this morning.
[time=1737] Just hang in there with me.
[time=1740] A child can be so pressured to achieve that he is virtually destroyed.
[time=1748] He quickly learns that nothing he does is sufficient to please his parent, his father
[time=1754] or his mother.
[time=1755] No sooner does he accomplish one goal than he has challenged to accomplish something better.
[time=1760] Others who fantasize their own achievements through the athletic or business skills of their sons or mothers who fantasize a glamorous career through the lives of their daughters
[time=1770] prostitute their responsibility as parents.
[time=1779] A pastor friend shared a story with me some time ago of a young woman who was confined to a padded cell and was in a state of catatonic shock.
[time=1790] She was a Christian and had been raised in a Christian family, but her mother had ceaselessly pushed her to be the most popular, to be the most beautiful and most successful girl in
[time=1800] her school.
[time=1801] She became head cheerleader.
[time=1803] She became the homecoming queen and later was in fact a model, but the pressure to excel became so great and she had a complete and mental breakdown.
[time=1813] After she was eventually released from the hospital, she went back into the same artificial and demanding environment when again she found she could not cope, she committed suicide.
[time=1824] She had summed up her frustration when she had told my friend one day, "I don't care what it is I do, it never satisfies her."
[time=1837] And you know you just don't ever want to hear that.
[time=1840] You just don't ever want to imagine that.
[time=1842] You don't want to ever picture a mind and a heart and a spirit.
[time=1847] So confused and so torn up by your fantasies or mind regarding sports, business, physical
[time=1858] appearance, grades, success.
[time=1864] Children can be exasperated, left hopeless by the bar of a dad or mom, a bar that's always
[time=1873] being raised.
[time=1878] Maybe just some real practical advice would be to say, "Dad, keep your bars, keep your bars in the closet with your old yearbook and letter jacket.
[time=1889] Just leave it alone." And whoever he is, whoever she is, whatever she enjoys, whatever you see their bent becoming,
[time=1900] whatever talent starts to pop up or even if a little bit starts to pop up or even if
[time=1907] there's not much, I mean whatever it is that God's given them, whatever it is that they enjoy, whatever it is you sense them moving towards.
[time=1917] Celebrate that.
[time=1919] Be excited about that.
[time=1923] I sense in our own home these days with the crew that we've got, that's going to be a diverse picture.
[time=1929] I grew up the only child.
[time=1932] I only knew one picture and now I'm learning as a father with five that that's going to
[time=1938] be a diverse deal.
[time=1941] It could be all over the charts.
[time=1942] It's starting to kind of go that way.
[time=1944] Bring it on.
[time=1946] Let's celebrate you and me, who they are and leave our fantasies and leave our demands
[time=1952] and leave our high bars in the closet.
[time=1958] We provoke and wound our kids.
[time=1960] We leave legacies of resentment and lost opportunity when we physically are verbally abused.
[time=1966] When we physically are verbally abused before you check out on this one, hold on.
[time=1972] Stay with me just for a moment.
[time=1975] Battered children are a growing, not diminishing reality.
[time=1984] Just go to the grocery store or as we say here in the Midwest, the grocery.
[time=1993] Anybody identify with that is it just me.
[time=1996] Anybody ever notice in the grocery store the stuff you see, the things you hear?
[time=2001] Yeah?
[time=2002] Not your heads if you're with me.
[time=2004] Yeah.
[time=2005] It's just maybe it's because it's just a tension point.
[time=2009] Folks are in a hurry, they're spending money they don't have.
[time=2011] They got three, four, I mean, me when I go, I try and maybe I shouldn't, we will play
[time=2018] hide and go seek, we'll play, we'll do all kinds of things.
[time=2022] Me, my wife would not do that.
[time=2024] I'll do that.
[time=2025] She's much more together than that.
[time=2027] Does a great, great job of being more like, we just have fun.
[time=2030] But sometimes I hear things and I see things in a grocery store that boggle my mind.
[time=2042] It's not getting better, no, no, no, it's getting worse.
[time=2046] And I don't just mean outside the church people, grocery store, that was kind of safe, right?
[time=2051] Now let's just talk about you and me, physical and verbal abuse.
[time=2056] See, sometimes we spank our kids harder than we should.
[time=2063] It doesn't mean you shouldn't discipline your child, it means you should do it with a calm and appropriate spirit.
[time=2071] Whenever it is, you can get one, an hour later, two hours later, a day later with a
[time=2079] calm and appropriate spirit.
[time=2083] Proper physical discipline, dads, isn't a matter of you exerting your superior strength or authority.
[time=2089] Good night, he's six years old, you should be able to exert your strength, big deal.
[time=2095] Proper physical discipline isn't a matter of that, it's a matter of love, it's a matter of care, it's a matter of calm, it's a matter of an opportunity to make an investment pass
[time=2107] on principle, it's an opportunity to put your arms around him or her.
[time=2111] And though uncomfortable because of the discipline component, it's a chance for you to be a dad,
[time=2117] not a dictator, not a bully.
[time=2121] A father can also verbally abuse a son or daughter.
[time=2126] I've seen dads and moms who can as easily overpower a child with their words as they can with their physical strength, verbally shoving them up against a wall with superior
[time=2137] arguing skills and deadly sarcasm, all of which can inflict immediate and long-term
[time=2145] pain.
[time=2150] You know what's amazing to me about this one?
[time=2154] What's amazing to me, what's humiliating to me?
[time=2158] And I'll just speak for me.
[time=2162] What's humiliating to me about this one is that I will find myself at times saying things to my kids I would never, ever want you to hear me say.
[time=2173] Ever for fear of what you'd think of me.
[time=2177] And when I stop and just think about that and how twisted that is, and I do, I will say
[time=2185] things to them, I would never want you to hear me say.
[time=2191] I was just thinking about it in between services, I didn't mention it first hour, and I haven't even, I've not articulated this until just now, we've, and we can kind of laugh at it,
[time=2202] but it's also not very funny.
[time=2205] We've had a guest with us at our home, all week long, a good, good friend who's here to help with a project, one that you'll actually see here in just a minute.
[time=2215] And it dawns on me this morning as I'm saying this, that the several times this week that we've all sat at the table for a meal, Kevin and I, and all of our kids and our buddy,
[time=2227] they've been remarkably peaceful times this week.
[time=2232] My patience has amazed me, our self-control has been absolutely mind-boggling.
[time=2241] And you know what, it's because I didn't want him, would never want him to hear me say,
[time=2249] or watch me react in some of the ways that I do periodically when the pressure gets tense and the frustration level goes high.
[time=2259] Don't push him, don't hit him, don't power up on him, hold him, hold him, hold him a
[time=2270] lot, kiss him on their forehead, on their cheek, hold their hand, go on there at night
[time=2276] and kneel down next to their bed and kiss him on their forehead and thank God for that little life, 3, 13, tell me whatever, hug him every chance you get, put an arm around
[time=2287] their shoulder, don't yell at him, get up every day and beg God to give you the strength
[time=2294] not to yell at him, beg him to give you the strength and courage to speak words that
[time=2300] will help and then when things aren't tense and when things aren't hot and when frustration
[time=2308] levels aren't sky high, then work with them on something.
[time=2311] You want to make a correction, do it without the presence of conflict, take 5 minutes when things are cool and say, hey, by the way, let's just work on this real quick.
[time=2323] We provoke him, dads, we provoke him to anger, we exasperate him when we remain silent, boy,
[time=2330] this is big.
[time=2333] Adam, Adam lost it all, Adam, Adam didn't do us any favors and Genesis 3 as he stands there and watches his wife take the fruit and do exactly what God said not to do.
[time=2342] He stood there in utter silence and men and dads have been standing there in utter silence
[time=2348] sense, and there's got to be a willingness in you and a willingness in me to speak up
[time=2356] in loving and appropriate ways.
[time=2358] They see you, your kids, they do, they see you with your remote in your hand.
[time=2362] They see you as you go and chase your hobby.
[time=2365] They see you with your job and they see you with your ministry, but they don't hear from
[time=2372] you.
[time=2374] Sometimes they don't hear from you enough, I had a grown man this week, mid-30s, tell
[time=2381] me how as a teenager he was in full and complete rebellion, drugs and alcohol in dangerous
[time=2389] situations that he knew his dad was aware of and his dad said nothing.
[time=2396] No flags got raised, no conversations got had and it may not be drugs and it may not be alcohol for you as a dad as you watch your kids, but you know what, it's something and they need to hear from you.
[time=2408] They need to have you step into their world and say something, communicate something of
[time=2415] love and devotion.
[time=2417] We provoke dads.
[time=2419] This one won't come up on the screen, but it's probably the most important one of all.
[time=2423] Write it down.
[time=2424] We provoke our kids to anger when we don't love our wives, when we don't love our wives.
[time=2435] When you as a father are unwilling to give yourself to an Ephesians 5 love that sacrifices with great humility and devotion to her, they see it.
[time=2444] They sense it and it strikes at the very core of their peace and their security.
[time=2450] Show me a kid who has watched dad love his wife with humility, sacrifice and consistency
[time=2456] and I will show you a kid whose hope, whose spirit and courage have not been stripped, who may not be a perfect kid, but he or she hasn't been exasperated as they've watched
[time=2469] dad love day after day, week after week, month after month and year after year as they've watched him give himself, selflessly with humility and sacrifice to her.
[time=2484] We provoke when we do these things.
[time=2489] We can also, as we repent of these things, move toward a legacy of love, grace and acceptance,
[time=2496] a legacy of love, grace and acceptance.
[time=2500] And before we show you this story this morning, I want to just read this to you, go to Deuteronomy.
[time=2506] And as you're turning there, guys, please listen in here.
[time=2511] Let me just show you, let me just remind you what the foundation, okay.
[time=2514] There's a lot of ways of carrying this out.
[time=2517] You're about to see that.
[time=2518] Let me just remind you, guys, stay with me here, of the foundation, the beginning point of a legacy that really counts, a legacy that begins with you and your relationship with
[time=2529] a living God who loves you deeply and has given you this opportunity to father.
[time=2535] Look what it says in Deuteronomy, chapter 10, verse 12, and now Israel, what does the Lord your God require from you dads?
[time=2543] What would it be like if you and I were relentless in our devotion to this, to fear the Lord your God, to walk in all his ways, not some of them, not most of them, but in all his
[time=2554] ways, and to love him, to serve the Lord your God, dads, with all your heart and with all
[time=2560] your soul and to keep the Lord's commandments, first part of verse 13 there, dad, what would
[time=2566] it look like if you were willing and I were willing on a regular basis as dads, trying to make an investment, trying to leave a legacy of love and grace and acceptance.
[time=2576] What if we were like the dad in Deuteronomy 11, 18, where it says, "You shall therefore impress these words of mine on your heart, dads, on your soul, and you shall bind them,
[time=2588] these words as a sign on your hand and they shall be as frontals on your forehead, and you shall teach them." Teach them, you say, "I'm not a teacher, it's okay, open your mouth, read a book, ask a question, pray with them, talk to them about things you're learning, and you shall teach them to your sons, talking of them when you sit in your house." What do you do when you sit in your house with your kids, dads?
[time=2616] What if you were talking about impractical, real, relevant ways, truth, when you sit in
[time=2623] your house, when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you rise up, and you shall write them on the doorpost of your house and on your gates so that your days and the days of your sons may be multiplied on the land which the Lord swore to your fathers.
[time=2638] Let me back to Ephesians, this is where all this started, Ephesians 6, 4, fathers do not
[time=2645] provoke your children to anger, but bring them up when you sit down, when you walk along
[time=2651] the road, when you lie down, when you get up, bring them up in the discipline and instruction
[time=2657] of the Lord.
[time=2659] Watch, don't leave here, watch and listen closely, you don't want to miss this.
[time=2665] As you see the story of one, who wasn't perfect, but who gave himself to this endeavor, a legacy
[time=2672] of love, grace and acceptance, listen.
[time=2678] I like to play basketball.
[time=2681] I like the sound the ball makes when it goes in and doesn't touch the rim.
[time=2688] Those are the shots I try to make most of the time.
[time=2698] I have two favorite shots, up close and far away.
[time=2707] I don't make the far away once very often.
[time=2711] I wish I could make the far away once all the time.
[time=2717] I wish I could get you better.
[time=2731] An early memory is the arrival home from work.
[time=2735] Dad, he worked a full day, he'd leave in the morning, around 7.30, he usually started his work day around 8.
[time=2742] He'd come home for lunch a lot of times.
[time=2745] We may not be there, but I know mom that always would have lunch with them.
[time=2749] Go back in and then he'd come home at 5 o'clock, his work day ended at 5.
[time=2754] He'd be in his car, drive home, be home at 5 after 5.
[time=2759] As soon as he came in, he came in through the garage door and he'd make kind of a bee line for the kitchen.
[time=2764] He'd give mom a kiss and that was just his standard routine every day.
[time=2770] My memory is that he always came home and had a really good balance between his work and his family life.
[time=2785] Well my dad was not much of a speech maker, a teacher.
[time=2789] He very much seized on reactionary teaching.
[time=2792] Something would happen, something went wrong and he'd kind of seized the moment and you'd hear some kind of input or principle being taught.
[time=2801] He had lived in a small town of about 1500 people growing up and everyone knew everyone else and pretty much knew their business as well.
[time=2810] In that town there was one black family, if you can imagine.
[time=2815] They were real wonderful people, it was the Edwards family.
[time=2819] I remember the first time I saw one of the Edwards kids as the first time I'd ever seen a black person.
[time=2824] I was about 5 years old and it was in a supermarket in Fowler.
[time=2829] I remember telling dad, "Look, look!" And dad got between me and a little boy because a little boy had kind of wheeled around and he got down right in my face and said, "You put my hand down." He says, "Don't you ever point at somebody because of their skin color and make them different.
[time=2846] They're all the same on the inside.
[time=2847] There's no difference between you and him." And just ingrained in my memory is little teachable moments like that where I did something that
[time=2855] was probably a perfectly natural reaction and he seized it and used it to actually do something good for me long term.
[time=2871] The value of truth was real important value to him and there was real serious consequences
[time=2878] for us in the discipline side if we were caught in a lie.
[time=2883] He was very probing.
[time=2885] He was one of those guys that kind of heard out all the facts and he'd hear all the stories and he'd start trying to square the stories with each other and you just hoped that you weren't the guy who was fivin' but truth was a very important principle.
[time=2907] One thing that I remember again and again, especially when I was in high school, is I'd come home from school and I'd go down to the office for some reason and it just seemed like I'd always kind of catch him moving up the main hallway in that from the lobby and there'd be a client with him.
[time=2923] I'd walk in and he'd say, "It's Chris," which is what I went by.
[time=2928] I'm John Christopher Barson because he was a John also.
[time=2931] I always went by Chris.
[time=2933] When we get in the lobby, his eyes would light up and he says, "This is Chris.
[time=2936] I want you to meet Chris.
[time=2937] This is my son and he introduces his client to me." I remember thinking like when I walked in, it's like I need to get out of his way because I'm going to be kind of a bother and it was just the opposite from him.
[time=2949] This is someone I esteemed very highly and want you to meet him and you just sense the specialness in the very introduction.
[time=2965] I don't think there was much doubt, at least from my viewpoint, of who was really important.
[time=2972] My dad loved my mom.
[time=2974] When I think about Andrew and John and who I hope they become as boys and then men later in life, and there's some things like, "I want to die a one woman man." I just think there are hallmarks of dad's life.
[time=2988] He was that and I want them to have that too.
[time=2991] There's real treats and benefits and rewards for that.
[time=2997] But I'd like for them to have that value.
[time=3009] Dad would always leave for work around 7.30, but what he really did is he went down to this coffee shop.
[time=3016] This moved over the years, but I remember there was a time when there was a bowling alley, but they would open in the morning for coffee and all these guys would go in there and they just sit in there and have their coffee together every morning, even Saturday mornings.
[time=3031] They would go in there and they'd talk for probably 30 minutes, 45 minutes before they were going to their respective places of employment and they'd break up and go.
[time=3040] He loved to spend time with those guys and I was teasing because I said they gossiped like a bunch of little ladies, but they just had a great time.
[time=3053] When he passed away, we had a little memorial service for him and people came and paid
[time=3061] respects and we had a receiving line and our family was lined up.
[time=3066] Those guys came and what they said, it was just wonderful.
[time=3082] He was the guy who did this, the guy who served the spaghetti dinners and they all had some
[time=3088] unique thing that they saw in him that they really valued and just one story after another.
[time=3093] We were there for hours.
[time=3108] He was truly one of the most encouraging and proud moments that you could have for a person.
[time=3120] My dad says that every great basketball player worked really hard to be good, so he gave
[time=3127] me a spot to shoot from and practice.
[time=3135] He said if I practiced that shot 20 times a day, I would hear the ball go in without
[time=3141] hitting the rim.
[time=3143] I like that sound more than any other sound.
[time=3152] I think my dad was right.
[time=3156] He's a great coach.
[time=3161] Wow, what a line there, I hope you caught that at the end guys.
[time=3168] Dad's, whoever you are, however old they are.
[time=3173] They want desperately for you and I to give them a spot to shoot from.
[time=3179] Whether it's in the way you love your wife, whether it's in the way you give yourself to others, whether it's the way you would love and pursue your God.
[time=3189] These little lives, these students, even these grown kids, they still to this day need you and I to give them spots to shoot from and maybe even hang around and get a few rebounds
[time=3202] and help them shoot it again.
[time=3204] They don't need you to be perfect.
[time=3206] They just need a spot.
[time=3209] Would you just bow with me?
[time=3212] Father, thank you so very much and as we have honored, done our best to honor one who
[time=3221] has passed and as we have relived his story, we're reminded of many others whose pictures we will see here in just a moment who have left legacies, legacies of love, grace and
[time=3232] acceptance.
[time=3233] God, we thank you that today with those of us who are here, those of us who have the privilege of fathering God that your word and your spirit and your people bring us strength and hope.
[time=3244] God, keep us on that path making that kind of investment.
[time=3248] God, we are so grateful for you and for this time together and thank you for the fathers who are working so hard and giving so much.
[time=3256] In your son's name we pray, amen.
[time=3259] These if you would, just notice the screens and as we get ready to leave today, we want to just kind of immemorial, immemorial of, thank God for those who have left a legacy.
[time=3289] God, we are so grateful for you and for your spirit.
[time=3315] God, we are so grateful for you and for all of us who have left, we are so grateful for
[time=3328] you and for all of us who have left, we are so grateful for you and for all of us who have left, we are so grateful for you and for all of us who have left, we are so grateful for you and for all of us who have left, we are so grateful for you and for all of us
[time=3344] who have left, we are so grateful for you and for all of us who have left, we are so grateful
[time=3354] for you and for all of us who have left, we are so grateful for you and for all of us
[time=3365] who have left, we are so grateful for you and for all of us who have left, we are so grateful
[time=3373] to you and for all of us who have left, we are so grateful for you and for all of us who have
[time=3389] left, we are so grateful for you and for all of us who have left, we are so grateful for
[time=3395] you and for all of us who have left, we are so grateful for you and for all of us who have
[time=3405] left, we are so grateful for you and for all of us who have left, we are so grateful for
[time=3412] you and for all of us who have left, we are so grateful for you and for all of us who have
[time=3418] left, we are so grateful for you and for all of us who have left, we are so grateful for you and for all of us who have left, we are so grateful for you and for all of us who have left, we are so grateful We are so grateful for you and for all of us who have left, we are so grateful for you
[time=3436] and for all of us who have left, we are so grateful for you and for all of us who have left, we are so grateful
[time=3445] I want to leave the legacy, I will remember me, did I choose to learn?
[time=3466] Did I point to you, left to make a mark on things?
[time=3471] I want to leave an awful A child of a mercy and grace
[time=3477] Who blessed your name on a pile of jetty glaze
[time=3484] And leave that kind of legacy I don't mind if you got something nice to say about me
[time=3505] Would you stand and let's close in a word of prayer?
[time=3508] Father, we thank you for the legacy of many who have gone before us And we pray, God, you give us the strength today to leave them, to leave them wherever we go And to do it as we hold tightly to you, your truth, your spirit and your people
[time=3524] Thank you for this time, for us to be together Give us strength as we go, in your name we pray. Amen.
