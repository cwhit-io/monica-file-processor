[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=30] (upbeat music)
[time=60] We're going to sing "Only a God Like You."
[time=75] We're going to picture the throne room of Heaven.
[time=78] With God the Father, Jesus the Son, and His Holy Spirit.
[time=82] And the cherubim, seraphim, flying around, saying holy, holy, holy.
[time=89] In the 24 elders laying down their crowns before His feet and us on earth,
[time=95] joining in and praising Him, telling Him that He is the only God.
[time=99] There is no other God before our God, who is like our God.
[time=104] Let's sing "Only a God Like You."
[time=110] [MUSIC - 48 seconds]
[time=167] (upbeat music) - Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor
[time=187] here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=189] And happy summer to you.
[time=191] Welcome again to the Bible Hour.
[time=192] And we got a rule around here that whenever it's over 90 degrees, we get to wear shorts.
[time=198] And it's hot today, but we're keeping cool.
[time=202] And we are so thankful that you have joined us again.
[time=205] I wanna tell you about two things.
[time=207] Very important things that are going on here at Black Hawk that we would love for you in the viewing audience to be aware of.
[time=213] Number one is this.
[time=214] We get the opportunity again this September to have Tommy Walker and the Christian assembly band with us.
[time=221] We had Tommy and that whole crew with us last year.
[time=224] Many of you may have come and were a part of that.
[time=227] Tommy Walker is probably one of the most renowned and respected worship leaders and songwriters in our day.
[time=234] God is using Tommy, not only here in the States, but really all across the world.
[time=239] And his energy and his style and the message that they bring is so very exciting.
[time=245] And something that we are really fortunate to be able to have right here at Black Hawk this September.
[time=250] So September 6th, Saturday night, there'll be a concert that we're just gonna invite the whole city to come and be a part of several churches in the area are partnering with us again on this.
[time=263] And we wanna just give you advanced notice.
[time=265] You won't wanna miss that Saturday night.
[time=267] And then Tommy and the band will be here helping lead worship that next Sunday morning, September 7th.
[time=273] So please join us if you have any questions at all.
[time=276] Feel free to call us at Black Hawk at 4937400.
[time=281] I also wanna just let you know this.
[time=284] The last three weeks here at Black Hawk, if you've been tuning in at all, you know that we have been in a series that we've entitled the three habits of highly destructive people, the three habits, three things that we find in 1 John, chapter two, verses 15 to 17, where it talks about the lust of the eyes, the lust of the flesh and the boastful pride of life, pride, power and pleasure.
[time=313] And we have just done our very best in these last few weeks to try and not only explain what the scriptures teach about these three things, but to also do our very best to kind of wave the flag, to warn you and to warn ourselves again of where those roads can take us, pride, power and pleasure.
[time=334] You see the enemy wants to convince you and me that pride, power and pleasure can bring great gain.
[time=341] What we learn though, and what we're reminded of as we looked at the scriptures is that those things can bring really great destruction.
[time=349] They form locks on the doors of our hearts.
[time=354] And that's what this symbolism is about right here, locks that really shut the doors of our hearts, locks that keep us from the life, life on the other side that God has for us.
[time=368] And so we just wanna share what we've learned and what we've been discovering with you.
[time=373] And so we just want you to know, those of you in the viewing audience, that we've put together a tape series.
[time=378] And the tapes are available for you, three habits of highly destructive people.
[time=383] And you can get this three set series by simply calling the church office at 4937400, just press zero and talk to our receptionist.
[time=392] She would be more than happy to take your order and get these sent out to you ASAP.
[time=398] We're so thankful for the opportunity we get to share this ministry with you.
[time=402] And our hope is that as you listen to these tapes and you may wanna pick up one, two, or three sets and share them with some people that you know, our hope is that they will be encouraging and that they will not only open your eyes, but maybe even open the locks that are on your heart, the locks that are keeping you from a life that God wants to give you.
[time=422] Hope you're encouraged and we hope to see you soon.
[time=425] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 21 seconds]
[time=456] (audience applauds) - Well, we're glad you're here and we wanna continue today in this series that Mitch did a phenomenal job last week of kicking off, three habits of highly destructive people, three habits of highly destructive people.
[time=476] Let me take you where he took us last week, if you will, open your Bibles to 1 John chapter two.
[time=481] 1 John chapter two and let's see how this unfolds.
[time=485] Three habits of highly destructive people.
[time=488] It says in 1 John two, and you can follow along beginning in verse 15, it says, "Do not love the world, nor the things in the world.
[time=497] If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
[time=501] For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, pleasure, and the lust of the eyes, power, and the boastful pride of life, pride, is not from the Father but is from the world, and the world is passing away, and also it's lusts, but the one who does the will of God, it says abides forever.
[time=524] Mitch did a great job last week of introducing us to these three locked doors.
[time=530] These locked doors of power, pride, and pleasure, and he described in vivid and familiar detail the pursuit of power.
[time=538] It's where he was last week with locked number one, the pursuit of power, the deadly consequence of control gone too far, and this morning we come to our second locked door.
[time=549] I gotta tell you, before we jump in, this is a challenging endeavor for me.
[time=555] I know Mitch and Steve would tell you the same thing.
[time=558] I don't often speak for people, but I think in this situation I can speak for them.
[time=563] You know, no matter how many ways we say it, no matter how many disclaimers, we may try and get out there periodically.
[time=569] It's very difficult to stand behind this pulpit here, sometimes, and be before all of you, and talk with kind of a sense of authority, and I know many of you, you know me, and you know us, and our perspectives are pretty clear, yet there's just always this sense that kind of stirs inside me that you stand behind this and you do your best to explain this, and sometimes people just kind of elevate you a little bit.
[time=601] And it's just a tough one, especially when you come to things like this.
[time=605] Pride, power, and pleasure, and I am just going to, I'm gonna trust you all to just know that as I stand before you, as Mitch did last week and as Steve will next week, that we are really thankful that the ground is level, and I just come to you today as one who, at times around here, even.
[time=632] You know, I was thinking about it this week, there's times around here when I exercise too much power, exercise, control at, I think sometimes, inappropriate levels, and I try to be sensitive to that, but there's times where I fail.
[time=647] There's times at home, you know, with my wife when we're in an argument.
[time=653] Yes, see, we argue too, just like you, and there's times where we'll be in an argument at home, and oh no, guys, maybe you'll identify with the feeling.
[time=665] There's times where in my gut, I know I'm wrong, but I won't say it because I wanna win.
[time=674] So prideful at times, I won't even say I'm wrong to my wife or sometimes to our kids.
[time=682] There's times when I get disconnected from God, you know, we talk around here about a relentless pursuit of him and this attempt that we make with his help, you know, to stay connected to him, to stop at nothing, to pursue him, and listen to him and abide in him.
[time=699] Well, you know what, there's times when I don't, and when I don't, I won't speak for you, but when I don't stay connected to him and I find myself out here disconnected, sometimes worldly pleasure begins to seem a little bit more inviting than godly pleasure.
[time=720] And you might sit there and be thinking, well, what does he mean by worldly pleasure?
[time=722] Well, the same thing that you're thinking about.
[time=725] Same thing that hits you, same stuff that comes across
[time=731] your path, comes across mine, grounds level.
[time=736] And so I just get reminded, in times like this, of Philippians 1-6, maybe you get encouraged by that verse like I do sometimes, because it says there in Philippians 1-6 that he who began a good work, he'll perfect it.
[time=749] And he'll keep growing you and he'll keep growing me.
[time=752] And as long as your heart and mind stay open to that process, he will be faithful to grow us through our weaknesses and our failures.
[time=760] And I'm also reminded, as I think through and prepare for this morning of what Paul said to a young struggling pastor named Timothy.
[time=767] In 2 Timothy 4, he told Timothy, "Preach the word, Timothy." He said, "I know you're young.
[time=774] "I know you don't have it all together.
[time=775] "I know things there at Ephesus are challenging, "but preach the word." And he said, "Preach it in season and what?" And out of season.
[time=785] Preach it when it's easy, Timothy, when it's convenient and comfortable, but also when it's not.
[time=790] And so here we go.
[time=792] We will this morning just jump in and I'll just trust that you understand the heart from which this comes and we are going to this morning do our very best to preach the word.
[time=801] 1 John 2, 15.
[time=803] Go back there to that first phrase, that first line that Mitch read for us last week.
[time=808] "Don't love the world," he says.
[time=811] "Do not love the world nor the things in the world." People were giving, they were agapeying the cosmos.
[time=819] They were loving.
[time=820] They were sacrificially giving themselves thoroughly to this world system that was apart from and opposed to God.
[time=829] He says, "Don't do that.
[time=832] "Don't love the world.
[time=833] "Don't give your heart away to this system "because in doing so they were locking themselves out." They were giving themselves to these three deadly sins, these locked doors that were keeping them from the life that God had for them.
[time=848] And let's take a look this morning at lock number two.
[time=852] The first lock was power, the second lock that we come to this morning is the lock of pride.
[time=858] You've got your pencils, your pens out, write this down.
[time=860] Pride, a self-promoting conceit, there you go.
[time=864] Pride, a self-promoting conceit, a preoccupation with one's own agenda, a preoccupation with one's own interests, a self-promoting conceit.
[time=880] You don't need me, I don't think, to stand here and tell you that the fact of the matter is pride is consumed with I.
[time=889] It's consumed with me.
[time=891] Pride's devotion to self is unending and when you think about it, it's really staggering.
[time=897] Self-promotion, it's rampant.
[time=901] Self-protection, we see it all the time.
[time=904] Self-satisfaction, self-deception, self-rejection, self-destruction.
[time=910] You see, active or passive pride is simply and only committed to itself.
[time=915] And it's always a good idea.
[time=918] It's always the best idea to just before you go too far in a discussion, before you begin to think things through too much, why don't we just look and see what God's word has to say about pride.
[time=929] We won't look at it at all, but let's just kind of take a glance, if you will.
[time=934] What are the scriptures teaches?
[time=935] As we're just kind of in an introductory way, looking at this lock of pride, this self-preoccupation.
[time=942] What does it look like?
[time=943] What are the scriptures have to say?
[time=945] Go back in your Old Testament to Proverbs.
[time=947] Go back to Proverbs chapter 16.
[time=949] If you've got your Bibles, just open them up there, right there before you get just past Psalms, then comes Proverbs.
[time=957] Proverbs chapter 16, verses 18 and 19.
[time=961] Get those thumbs, those fingers warmed up.
[time=964] We're gonna flip through a few here.
[time=966] Pride, what does God's word say, Proverbs 16, 18?
[time=969] It says here, pride goes before destruction and a haughty spirit, a prideful spirit before stumbling.
[time=976] It is better to be of a humble spirit with the lowly than to divide the spoil with the proud.
[time=982] Proverbs 18, over just a few pages, Proverbs 18, 12.
[time=987] Before destruction, you see it there, the heart of man is haughty.
[time=993] But humility goes before honor.
[time=998] Go back to Proverbs 11, just a few pages back, Proverbs 11, verses two and three.
[time=1005] When pride comes, it says there in Proverbs 11, too.
[time=1008] When pride comes, then comes dishonor, but with the humble is wisdom.
[time=1013] The integrity of the upright will guide them, but the falseness of the treacherous will destroy them.
[time=1019] All the way back to the end of Proverbs 29.
[time=1022] Proverbs chapter 29, look if you will there, verse 23.
[time=1027] Proverbs 29, 23, what does it say about pride?
[time=1030] It says this, a man's pride will bring him low.
[time=1034] Proverbs 29, verse 23, a man's pride will bring him low.
[time=1039] But a humble spirit will obtain honor.
[time=1044] Go to Obadiah.
[time=1046] Obadiah, you're thinking, oh my goodness, Oba, what?
[time=1051] Go to Obadiah, whoever gets their first raise your hand.
[time=1055] No, no, no, no, don't do that, that would be prideful.
[time=1058] Go to Obadiah, you'll find it there just before Jonah.
[time=1064] And yes, I do have tabs in my Bible.
[time=1066] Obadiah, no chapters in Obadiah, just verses.
[time=1070] Look at this, I've kind of stalled 'cause I wanna give you time to get there.
[time=1073] You don't wanna miss this.
[time=1074] Obadiah, verses three and four.
[time=1075] Listen, the arrogance of your heart has deceived you.
[time=1080] You who live in the clefs of the rock in the loftiness of your dwelling place, who say in your heart, who will bring me down to earth?
[time=1090] Though you build high like the eagle, though you set your nest among the stars, from there I will bring you down, declares the Lord.
[time=1098] From there I will bring you down.
[time=1103] Go to Daniel, go to the book of Daniel.
[time=1107] Back up a few books from Obadiah, back past Joel and Hosea.
[time=1111] Go to Daniel chapter four.
[time=1113] We see here what for some in the room this morning is a familiar story.
[time=1118] For others of you, it might be some new insight.
[time=1120] Daniel is dealing with King Nebuchadnezzar, who is quite full of himself.
[time=1127] And we'll just pick up the dialogue here in Daniel four, go to verse 30.
[time=1132] Daniel four, verse 30.
[time=1135] The king, Nebuchadnezzar, reflected and said, "Is this not Babylon, the great which I myself have built "as a royal residence by the might of my power "and for the glory of my majesty." Uh oh, dangerous words.
[time=1153] While the word was in the king's mouth, a voice came from heaven saying, King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is declared, sovereignty has been removed from you and you will be driven away from mankind and your dwelling place will be with the beasts of the field.
[time=1168] You will be given grass to eat like cattle and seven periods of time, seven years will pass over you until you recognize that the most high is ruler over the realm of mankind and bestows it on whomever he wishes.
[time=1186] My mind just goes back up the page to verse four of Obadiah, from there I will bring you down, declares the Lord.
[time=1193] Daniel moves on in verse 33, immediately the word concerning Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled and he was driven away from mankind and began eating grass like cattle and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven until his hair had grown like eagles feathers and his nails like birds claws.
[time=1211] But at the end of that period I, Nebuchadnezzar raised my eyes toward heaven and my reason returned to me and I blessed the most high and praised and honored him who lives forever.
[time=1226] If you wanna write this down or something like this just as we go through here, I just noted biblically,
[time=1235] pride is consistently connected to destruction, ruin, punishment and pain.
[time=1242] Biblically speaking, we see in just a few short passages, pride is consistently connected to destruction, ruin, punishment and pain.
[time=1252] Matthew 23, go over to your New Testament.
[time=1255] It says there in Matthew 23, first book in the New Testament, verse one, then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to his disciples and you go down to verse 10 and it says, and do not be called leaders.
[time=1267] For one is your leader, that is Christ.
[time=1272] But the greatest among you shall be your servant and whoever exalts himself shall be humbled and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted.
[time=1283] But the greatest among you shall be your servant.
[time=1289] James chapter four, back toward the back of your New Testament, go to James.
[time=1294] James chapter four, we're gonna pick it up in verse six.
[time=1297] James chapter four, verse six.
[time=1301] It's a powerful concept here, but he, couple of 'em.
[time=1305] But he gives greater grace, James says.
[time=1308] Therefore it says God is opposed to the proud but gives grace to the humble.
[time=1316] Hey, just a word to any of you here today, anybody?
[time=1320] Young, old student, single adult, young married, whoever you are, if you're struggling today.
[time=1327] If you know in the honesty of your heart that you've got to struggle on your hand today with this thing called pride, then understand, as I've been reminded of it myself in this past week, that God, God, the same God who just dealt with Nebuchadnezzar, the same God who's the maker of heaven and earth, the God of this universe that says is opposed to you.
[time=1353] You think you've got some trouble somewhere, you think you've got some, you think you've got some things that God is opposed to you, it says, against you.
[time=1363] If in fact this is the course you've chosen,
[time=1369] if in fact this is the mindset that you've grabbed hold of.
[time=1374] But he gives grace, he's completely for the humble.
[time=1379] Submit therefore to God.
[time=1381] Resist the devil who's behind all of this.
[time=1385] Resist the devil and he will flee from you.
[time=1389] You say, how do you do that?
[time=1390] Well, look at verse 10, humble yourselves, humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord and he will exalt you.
[time=1397] So question for you this morning, where is all of this rooted?
[time=1401] Mitch asked us this last week, I'm gonna ask it to you again, where does all this begin?
[time=1406] Where does all this pride start?
[time=1409] Where does this lock of pride initially take up residence?
[time=1414] Well, what did it say in Proverbs 1812?
[time=1416] It said before destruction, the what?
[time=1418] The heart of man, Proverbs 1812, before destruction, the heart of man is haughty.
[time=1424] What did Obadiah 3 say?
[time=1425] The arrogance of your what?
[time=1428] Heart, the arrogance of your heart has deceived you.
[time=1434] So what's the door?
[time=1435] The lock is pride, that which has been locked, the door is your heart and mine.
[time=1442] It's our hearts, the door is your heart and my heart.
[time=1445] Hearts locked in pride, shut out, shut out from the life that God has for us.
[time=1453] Now, for believers, many of you in the room today, you know him, many of you in the room today, you have a relationship with him.
[time=1460] For believers, for Christ followers, when this route of pride is what you choose, when this mindset of pride is where we function, this prideful heart, the prideful heart of a believer looks like this.
[time=1473] It'll come up on the screen there for you.
[time=1474] Just take a look at that.
[time=1475] A believer's prideful heart is marked by self-centered, write that word down, taking.
[time=1481] It may be kind of a new twist for you, but just hang with me here.
[time=1485] As a believer, when you give yourself to a prideful heart, when the mindset is me, when the preoccupation is I, what you and I do is you see we begin to be takers, we take.
[time=1499] That's right.
[time=1500] About a number of things.
[time=1502] We take credit.
[time=1504] I mean, just think about the conversations of a normal day.
[time=1507] We take credit when we shouldn't.
[time=1511] We take time, we steal time.
[time=1515] We take time from our spouse, from our kids, time they desperately need to make more money, to further our position, to play more, whatever it is you play.
[time=1526] We take, we take away, you take away the dignity
[time=1532] and respect do others when you sit in restaurants or homes or cars and gossip about them or criticize them because they don't do it the way you want it done 'cause as we all know, it should always be done your way.
[time=1548] You take away the heart of a child.
[time=1550] We talked about that in your pride, moms and dads.
[time=1553] We talked about that two weeks ago.
[time=1555] You take away the heart of a child when you exercise prideful abuse, actively abusing them, screaming, hitting, demeaning, passively abusing them by not being there in a loving, caring, sleeves rolled up relationship with them.
[time=1570] You know what, you even take away from them.
[time=1573] You take away from the glory, do God.
[time=1576] You take away from glory, do God when you attribute all that he has given or even some of what he has given, all that he has made possible for you, all or any of the blessings that he has chosen to bestow upon you.
[time=1589] It might be a talent, it might be a gift, it might be the ability to do this or that, it might be a house, it could be a car, it could be a number of things, but the moment you or I attribute any of that to us,
[time=1605] what we've done, what we've accomplished, we take away in our pride from glory, do God.
[time=1613] The believer's prideful heart even takes precedence
[time=1619] over others, takes charge, takes control.
[time=1626] Bob Purdy and I were talking about that this week.
[time=1631] It's all because we're proud.
[time=1635] Locked out, because we're so deeply committed to I.
[time=1640] And you know what, if you're here today and you don't, know the Lord, if you're here today and you're just, you're engaged in this search, you may be actively trying to figure this thing out, you may be here two, three months in asking questions and reading books that you never read and listening to tapes that you used to throw away.
[time=1662] But if you're here today and you still haven't trusted him with your heart and life, your life today and your life for eternity, if you haven't trusted him, then there's some pride going on there.
[time=1677] And I don't say that to you again as a slap on the wrist and sometimes you don't even realize you're doing it, but you are, because sometimes the mind of the seeker, sometimes the heart of the one not yet connected to God still thinks that somehow, maybe some way, on your own, you can get there.
[time=1698] And I meet people and talk to them all the time and there's some things that typically come up.
[time=1703] I mean, a lot of times you think you can get there because of your intelligence.
[time=1707] And a lot of you are really, really smart.
[time=1710] And so you read and you think and you dialogue and you debate and you think somehow your mind is gonna get you there.
[time=1720] Sometimes you think it's your comparative morality, comparative morality, nobody ever thinks they're perfect.
[time=1729] But sometimes they tend to look at the guy next to him and say, "Well, at least I'm not as bad as him." Sometimes it's your intelligence that you think is gonna get you there.
[time=1740] Sometimes it's your comparative morality, your good works, your open mind, your money,
[time=1750] your luck, all of it kind of just paints this picture of a seeker's prideful heart.
[time=1758] Self-reliant independence, self-reliant independence.
[time=1764] Your independent self-reliant effort.
[time=1770] Look at Isaiah, I was talking to Bob about this as well.
[time=1774] Isaiah 47, I believe is where we were.
[time=1778] Yeah, look at Isaiah 47.
[time=1780] And if you're here this morning and you're still thinking all this through, again, this is an invitation to consider truth.
[time=1788] This is a loving offering of what is right and what brings life.
[time=1793] Isaiah 47, 10.
[time=1800] Just give it a chance here, think this through.
[time=1804] And you felt secure in your wickedness and said, "No one sees me." You see, your wisdom and your knowledge, they have deluded you.
[time=1817] For you have said in your heart, "I am." And there is no one besides me.
[time=1823] The problem is though that you, whoever you are,
[time=1829] just like me 20 years ago, you have to come to grips with what it says in John 14.6.
[time=1836] John 14.6, where Jesus said, "I am the way." The truth and the life.
[time=1843] And nobody, nobody comes to the Father, but through me.
[time=1849] And if you're here today and you're still seeking, you're still trying to figure this faith thing out, I want that verse to be relieving for you.
[time=1859] It's not meant to be kind of tossed at you in judgment.
[time=1863] No, to the contrary, what that verse really says is, "Hey, you know what, on the intelligence thing, "you don't have to be that smart." On the morality thing, you see, you don't have to be that good, but the point is you couldn't be.
[time=1875] You couldn't ever be that good.
[time=1877] You couldn't ever be that smart, but see, smarts and good isn't what it's about.
[time=1881] So if it's not about that, what's it about?
[time=1886] If I'm a believer locked out because of my self-serving arrogance, if I'm a seeker locked out because of my self-reliance, how do I unlock this thing?
[time=1899] How do I get through to the other side in the life that God has for me?
[time=1905] Is there a key?
[time=1906] Yes, there is.
[time=1907] Mitch introduced it to you last week.
[time=1910] And it's the same key this week.
[time=1912] Write it down, full surrender.
[time=1914] Full surrender is the key.
[time=1917] Not intelligence, not morality.
[time=1919] Not trying harder, full surrender.
[time=1923] We say that a lot around here.
[time=1924] It's a phrase that biblically and personally, I mean, we believe in it.
[time=1930] And we want you to understand it and know it more and more in your life, whether for the very first time or on an ongoing basis.
[time=1939] I don't know what comes to your mind.
[time=1941] When you hear me say the phrase, full surrender.
[time=1944] What picture comes to your mind?
[time=1947] Is there something that kind of comes into view when you hear me say full surrender?
[time=1951] I think of the biggest white flag you've ever seen.
[time=1954] I think of the Westerns.
[time=1958] We've talked about that before where the guy comes in, you know, with the gun.
[time=1961] They just go, I said, I give, I'm done.
[time=1964] I think about a white flag waving.
[time=1965] I think about a mindset that says, you know what I give?
[time=1969] I give completely.
[time=1970] I give myself completely and thoroughly.
[time=1974] Head down, hands raised, humility.
[time=1978] As a Christ follower, let me talk to you again.
[time=1984] As a Christ follower, caught in self-centered taking, I'll confess my sin of pride moved through the unlocked door of surrender to a life of others-centered serving.
[time=1996] What initially looked like this, a believer's, it was a believer's prideful heart that was completely engaged in self-centered taking.
[time=2007] Now we move through this door.
[time=2008] We move through this key with this key of full surrender.
[time=2012] A believer's fully surrendered heart now takes on the attitude of others-centered serving.
[time=2018] What a thought, huh?
[time=2021] How does that happen?
[time=2022] Look at Philippians, chapter two.
[time=2024] Go ahead and open up there.
[time=2025] Keep those pens going.
[time=2026] Some great, great truth here to uncover and give some thought to Philippians.
[time=2031] Chapter two, how in the world am I, a believer, caught at times more than I wish in this prideful existence?
[time=2039] How can I move toward fully surrendered living?
[time=2043] Others-centered serving.
[time=2045] Look what it says in Philippians two.
[time=2047] We'll pick it up in verse three.
[time=2050] Philippians chapter two, verse three.
[time=2052] Do nothing, he says.
[time=2054] Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit.
[time=2057] But with humility of mind, let each of you regard one another as more important than himself.
[time=2064] Do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others.
[time=2071] Have this attitude in yourselves, which was also in Christ Jesus, who although he existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God, a thing to be grasped, held onto white knuckled.
[time=2085] No, he emptied himself.
[time=2088] It was called the manger.
[time=2090] Taking the form of a bondservant and being made in the likeness of men and being found in appearance as a man, having moved from deity to humanness, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.
[time=2109] Don't ever forget that with humility comes obedience.
[time=2114] And with obedience comes the need for you and I to trust, which prideful people don't do very well.
[time=2121] Let me get you to write three things down right there, can we?
[time=2125] I want you to walk out of this place with something to hold on to.
[time=2128] I want you to walk out of this place today with truth on your mind, just kind of packaged in a way that might give you and I a chance to really take some steps forward.
[time=2139] So if there's any pride struggle going on with you in any way at all, would you make this, we're gonna do it in the form of a prayer, okay?
[time=2146] I want you to write three things down.
[time=2148] At the top of your page or over on the side or somewhere, just write this, write God.
[time=2152] This is all from Philippians two, write God, please give me, God, please give me.
[time=2159] Number one, write this down, a new mind, a new mind.
[time=2165] Go back to the passage, Philippians two, three, do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of what your Bible say, mind, it says, let each of you regard.
[time=2178] One another is more important than himself, people, understand this, before you ever do a prideful deed, before you ever think a prideful thought, before you ever engage in any prideful activity, Philippians two tells us that first you think a prideful thought.
[time=2197] First your mind engages
[time=2204] in twisted prideful thinking.
[time=2207] And Paul says, but with humility of mind, and I want you to beg God with me this week daily, say, God, please give me a new mind.
[time=2217] What do we mean by that?
[time=2218] Write this down, second Corinthians 10, five.
[time=2225] And you can turn there if you'd like.
[time=2228] Second Corinthians 10, five says, and we are destroying speculations, and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God, and we are taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ.
[time=2245] Write that down, taking every thought captive.
[time=2248] If you want a new mind, God says, I'll help you, take every one of those prideful thoughts captive.
[time=2258] Well, what's a prideful thought?
[time=2260] We gotta, I mean, we gotta get, we gotta get real honest here, right?
[time=2265] We gotta get really practical.
[time=2267] So I just wrote a few of them down.
[time=2270] I'm not sure how I came up with them.
[time=2275] It's a joke.
[time=2278] (congregation laughing) But I wrote a few down.
[time=2281] You'll be amazed, I'm sure, at how readily you identify, 'cause you, like me, walk on ground that's level.
[time=2291] Just some, I just wrote a few down.
[time=2293] Just prideful thoughts.
[time=2296] Thoughts that just come.
[time=2298] They just, and they're there, they weren't thinking them.
[time=2301] We may not say anything, we might not do anything, but boy, they come.
[time=2306] I just wrote a few down.
[time=2309] Look at her, give me a break.
[time=2317] Who does she?
[time=2318] He is such a jerk.
[time=2323] Why doesn't he just shut up?
[time=2325] Doesn't he realize nobody wants to hear him?
[time=2328] My daughter is so much more talented than hers.
[time=2336] You idiot, who taught you how to drive?
[time=2344] Oh my, they, they must not make very much.
[time=2349] I'll talk about where we vacationed.
[time=2357] As soon as she stops rambling, and they'll all be impressed.
[time=2361] Oh, hurry and be quiet.
[time=2364] She, if you're willing, and if I'm willing,
[time=2371] to take every thought, you say, well Kelly, I'm gonna be awfully busy then.
[time=2376] I know, I understand that, so will I.
[time=2378] And I would rather you and I be busy taking thoughts captive.
[time=2383] What do I mean by that?
[time=2385] Identifying those thoughts as sinful.
[time=2388] Confessing those thoughts in that moment to God.
[time=2394] I am sorry, that was a pathetically prideful thing to think.
[time=2398] Identifying it as sinful, confessing it as sin, and then claiming and accepting the power of the Holy Spirit to mentally move in a different direction about him or her or them.
[time=2411] And going to Philippians 4.8, and plastering that thing all over your world where it says think on what is good, and what is right, and what is pure, and what is lovely.
[time=2423] Don't think that stuff.
[time=2426] And as soon as you do, confess it, and claim the power of the Spirit to move toward a new reality.
[time=2432] Taking every thought captive.
[time=2433] Maybe cutting off this venture toward prideful activity.
[time=2438] Pray this week, say God, please give me a new mind.
[time=2442] Look at verse four, and pray for a new focus.
[time=2446] Look at that, verse four, a new focus.
[time=2449] Says back in Philippians two.
[time=2452] And when you read it in the original language, do not merely look out for, that phrase look out for.
[time=2459] It's a phrase that kind of gives you the picture of a scope, kind of a target, kind of a line of sight.
[time=2465] What are you focused in on when you get out of bed every day?
[time=2470] You or them, and you beg God with me this week for a new focus, just write down others.
[time=2478] A new focus.
[time=2480] Don't merely look out for your own personal interest, but also for the interest of others.
[time=2486] You might even wanna cross out others and just write a name.
[time=2489] I mean, unless she or he is sitting right next to you and you wouldn't wanna be embarrassed, I mean, just write it down later.
[time=2495] But just pick somebody and this week, what would it be like to completely give yourself?
[time=2500] It's much as possible to bear interests over yours.
[time=2506] And how about a new example?
[time=2508] Oh God, please, give me a new mind.
[time=2513] How about a new example?
[time=2514] Sometimes you know what we're shooting for?
[time=2517] Kind of what we're aiming at.
[time=2518] Sometimes that gets a little muddied.
[time=2520] Look what Paul says in that same passage.
[time=2522] Have this attitude in yourselves, which was also in Christ Jesus.
[time=2530] He's the example who although he existed in the form of God didn't regard to the thing to be grasped but emptied himself.
[time=2538] Let me invite you to do this.
[time=2540] Sometimes it just helps to keep the picture a little bit more in the forefront of your mind and heart.
[time=2546] You know, lately, we've been talking about 10, 10, 2, 20.
[time=2549] Kind of a family-wide commitment to stay deeply connected to him.
[time=2553] And we talked about stopping at nothing.
[time=2556] To start every day with him, 10 minutes in the Psalms and 10 minutes in Proverbs and two minutes just kind of praying that through and then the 20 seconds to set the alarm again and do the same thing tomorrow.
[time=2567] Why don't you do this?
[time=2568] Why don't you take Proverbs or Psalms and replace it with the book of John?
[time=2573] Or Matthew or Mark or Luke?
[time=2576] And why don't you just spend a few minutes every morning or every night reading about this humble Savior, looking at this humble Lord, hearing the words of this man who was marked by, given to utter humility.
[time=2594] A new mind, a new focus, a new example.
[time=2601] You know what, if you're here and you haven't trusted Christ, you can experience the same thing.
[time=2606] You can.
[time=2609] The key, a full surrender, it's available to you.
[time=2613] You can, for the first time, know what it means to not just know about God, but to know Him.
[time=2619] You can fully and absolutely surrender your will and your life and your future to Him.
[time=2625] If you're willing to let go of your pride, your self-reliance, your ability to somehow figure it all out, and it is a loving, kind, gracious invitation
[time=2639] that He extends to you.
[time=2641] I was thinking about a, I was thinking about a picture
[time=2647] that might just kind of capture this.
[time=2650] Do me a favor and just quietly kind of just stand right where you're at.
[time=2654] I'm gonna ask Corbin in the band to come on up.
[time=2657] Would you just stand just quietly?
[time=2659] Please don't leave.
[time=2660] Please just stay kind of tuned in here just for a moment.
[time=2663] Right where you're standing.
[time=2665] I want you to kind of just picture this full surrender notion.
[time=2670] I want you to picture it kind of physically.
[time=2673] And I want you to just realize, believer Christ follower or seeker, believer who may be just kind of stuck in this heart of pride
[time=2684] just basically wanting nothing more than to further your own interest, seeker, just self-reliant, independence still.
[time=2692] And I want you to just, to just feel and see what it's like by just doing this.
[time=2701] Here's the posture that we take in pride.
[time=2705] I want you just to put your hands up like this and we're moving through our day, right?
[time=2709] And I want you to put your hands like this and just say, get out of my way.
[time=2714] 'Cause you didn't say it.
[time=2715] Put your hands up here like this, hands like this.
[time=2718] And I want you to just say it with me, get out of my way.
[time=2722] Don't look at anybody, don't look at anybody.
[time=2724] Just look straight ahead.
[time=2726] And I want you to just think now about your wife, your husband, your kids, coworkers, the stranger at the mark.
[time=2736] I mean, just think about the course of your day, the attitude of your spirit.
[time=2740] And here we go, get out of my way.
[time=2745] And you see what full surrender does.
[time=2747] As it calls you and I to a posture that's much different than that.
[time=2752] Think about those same people, would you?
[time=2754] And would you bow your heads?
[time=2755] Just bow your head, right where you're at.
[time=2758] And would you, in a real picture of surrender, would you just lift your hands up like I give?
[time=2766] Just right in front of you.
[time=2768] Nobody's looking, it's not about what this looks like.
[time=2770] I'm just trying to get you to sense.
[time=2773] Go ahead, just lift your hands up like I give.
[time=2776] Your palms may be up, your arms may be extended, doesn't matter how they're extended, it's just a head bowed, hands raised humility.
[time=2788] And what would they think if that's what they bumped into?
[time=2793] Go ahead and just feel what that would be like.
[time=2796] That new focus, that new mind, that new example of Christ who did this very same thing.
[time=2805] And you can put your hands down and you can keep your eyes closed.
[time=2812] And God, we just come before you, admitting our pride.
[time=2817] This self-preoccupation that once at times nothing more
[time=2823] than to be satisfied, acknowledged, well thought of.
[time=2829] And God, we confess it and we pray, God, that you would give us the strength of heart, the strength of mind, to take every thought captive, to be at people who could truly walk through this door into the life, God, that you have for us on the other side of pride, a life of humility and trust, kindness, graciousness.
[time=2852] God, we thank you so very much for the opportunity this morning to look into your work.
[time=2860] As we respond now, God, we pray that you would be honored in your son's name.
[time=2867] [AMEN] See you next week.
