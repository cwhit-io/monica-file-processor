[time=556] As we were, as Corbin and I were preparing to sing that this past week, I'm just thinking a lot about how big he is and yet how small we are.
[time=579] John says you must increase and I must decrease us just being men and women on this earth.
[time=587] A small earth that's in a solar system which stretches from the sun to Pluto which is about 6 billion miles.
[time=596] And then the solar system which is part of a galaxy which has 200 billion stars and the galaxy stretches 600,000 trillion miles from one end to the other.
[time=606] And that galaxy is one of about 100 billion other galaxies.
[time=612] And he creates all this and yet has a tremendous amount of love poured out on us.
[time=619] And then I was reading Psalm 8 where David says as he sits in a field in Israel, pretending sheepy just says,
[time=626] "When I consider the heavens the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have set in place, who is man that you are mindful of him?"
[time=635] That you care for him.
[time=638] What a God of wonders we serve that is willing to pour out so much love, go from a glory to a manger and then to a tree and sacrifice himself for us.
[time=664] It's the Lord of all creation.
[time=694] You are holy, holy, universal, majesty.
[time=707] You are holy, holy, Lord of heaven and earth.
[time=720] Oh, God of heaven and earth.
[time=724] We stand with us.
[time=736] Sing early in the morning.
[time=745] I will celebrate the light when I stumble in the darkness.
[time=757] I will call your name right now.
[time=762] God of wonders beyond our galaxy.
[time=767] You are holy, holy, universal, majesty.
[time=779] You are holy, holy, Lord of heaven and earth.
[time=792] Oh, God of heaven and earth.
[time=828] Oh, God of wonders beyond our galaxy.
[time=843] You are holy, holy, universal, majesty.
[time=855] You are holy, holy.
[time=861] God of wonders, God of wonders beyond our galaxy.
[time=868] You are holy, holy, universal, majesty.
[time=878] You are holy, holy, Lord of heaven and earth.
[time=889] Oh, God of heaven and earth.
[time=906] Good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=909] The last couple weeks, Mitchell and then Kelly have been talking about the first two habits of highly destructive people, power and pride.
[time=917] This morning, I get a chance to share with you some thoughts and what the Word has to say about pleasure as a highly destructive habit that can keep you from being everyone that God wants you to be.
[time=930] And I just hope that you'll glean from his Word what he has to teach you as we learn about what pleasure can do to preempt the opportunity to really do kingdom building work.
[time=942] As we today understand what it means to unlock that third lock, the lock of pleasure.
[time=950] Christ is the key. He unlocks those three locks. We can eliminate those three habits of highly destructive people if we'll just trust in him and live his way.
[time=960] Well, there are a couple things I'd really like to ask you to consider participating with us in this next couple weeks.
[time=966] We have a baptismal coming up this month and it's out at Stillwater Camp.
[time=971] It's 4.30 in the afternoon on Sunday and you can check our website to find out everything you need to know about that.
[time=979] And then also I'd like to encourage you to come to Common Ground on Wednesday nights.
[time=983] Wednesdays have been growing in number as people are coming to a really different worship service.
[time=988] We don't do the same thing that we do on Sunday morning and we'd encourage you to come and check out Common Ground.
[time=994] It starts at 6.45 on Wednesday evenings right here at the church.
[time=999] You go upstairs to rooms 257 and 259 and there'll be somebody there to help you out. Please join us.
[time=1006] In Psalm 119 it's just that the words of the Lord are eternal, that they last forever.
[time=1012] And we're going to be opening the word this morning we already have through Psalm but Steve's going to come and he's going to talk to us
[time=1020] about the pleasure in life that we so often mistakenly seek.
[time=1026] And let's use this opportunity to just refocus our hearts and our priorities and realizing that these holy words that were preserved for time
[time=1035] not only in this place but God's word says for all eternity.
[time=1039] And before we open that I just want to focus our hearts and minds towards that truth.
[time=1065] [MUSIC - 236 seconds]
[time=1326] Oh my goodness. I sat down there first service and my heart just filled up so fast listening to what Corbin and this is my son Josh that was standing here most of you probably don't know that.
[time=1346] And have been back there on the keyboards and Josh on the saxophone and these old guys that are with them, Denny leading the pack.
[time=1357] And my heart was just was just so full because these are paydays when you get to see last week there were seven students that I'd taught.
[time=1368] And I didn't really count them but Sue Griggs did and she came and told me this week she said oh man church last Sunday my heart was just so full because together as a family.
[time=1377] And you know we've got kids all kinds of kids doing all kind they go to New York and serve and they're doing all kinds of things.
[time=1385] And this is just one evidence of what's going on as we get together to do what God has ordained us to do with those ancient words we were just singing about.
[time=1396] When decent and all those people in children's ministry teach those ancient words to those little kids.
[time=1404] When the school gets to do that, when mom's in debt, when my children go to your house and you do that with my children in your house things happen.
[time=1415] God uses those ancient words those truths and when we value those when we value those so much that we meditate on those and we learn those and we hide those in our heart.
[time=1431] And they come oozing out of us at dinner time and in that three year old class and working with cadre and every other place and when all the arenas of our lives are teaching the truth about those ancient words about who he is.
[time=1451] Oh God does something and then we get paid days like I'm sitting down there for service kind of weeping and this service just enjoying the sight singing I didn't think about these guys too much because I wanted to think more about him.
[time=1463] Oh wow God is blessing us with the privilege and the opportunity of passing on those ancient words to the next generation and he says so that they will tell the generation to come after them and they won't forget it for the next generation.
[time=1480] And it's been happening for 6,000 years written words these words.
[time=1488] Man and now today we get to open this up and see what he has to say to us now.
[time=1496] What a privilege.
[time=1498] These words you know we have some people that have been working really hard at putting tape series together lately. One's on the 5E series that we did and now this three part series that we've just done on power and pride and pleasure.
[time=1513] The three destructive habits of people.
[time=1517] They're on cassettes available to you if you want to grab those out there in the in the foyer.
[time=1524] What's a habit?
[time=1527] A habit is a disposition this list a disposition or involuntary tendency don't have to think about it.
[time=1538] It's like breathing involuntary tendency to act constantly in a certain manner.
[time=1550] It's a disposition I'm born with a disposition toward sin.
[time=1558] I don't have to make a list.
[time=1562] I don't have to try to figure out okay who should I control now what power what pride issue should I develop in my mind.
[time=1569] I don't have to think about what pleasures I don't have to list them from a they come absolutely naturally.
[time=1574] I have an involuntary tendency toward acting in such a way that certain things are done over and over again.
[time=1585] Well two weeks ago when Mitchell taught us he taught us from 1 John chapter 2 15 through 17 to start this series off. Let's look at that again.
[time=1596] 1 John chapter 2 15 to 17 do not love the world nor the things in the world if anyone loves the world the love of the father is not in him.
[time=1606] For all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life is not from the father but is from the world.
[time=1616] And the world is passing away and also it's lusts but the one who does the will of God abides forever.
[time=1625] Now you want to do passing away stuff or do you want to do forever stuff?
[time=1631] That's a question you need to ask yourself every day.
[time=1635] Am I living my life in view of the reality that some things are eternal people in the Word God Himself?
[time=1644] And other things are temporal?
[time=1648] He says in his word that the world and these things will pass away.
[time=1656] They're temporary.
[time=1658] Power.
[time=1659] Mitchell said power was the lust or desire for more control than I am designed by God to have.
[time=1667] God designed us to have some control over some things.
[time=1672] As a matter of fact he gave us control over all of the animals and the plants.
[time=1681] But my lusting or desiring for more of that than he designed me to have is a power seeking lock that gets placed on the door of my heart.
[time=1696] It chains out the truth and seals in this lie that this eternal, I mean this temporal lust for power will be satisfying.
[time=1711] He said loving the world causes me to power up.
[time=1714] Mitchell can use that word.
[time=1716] Power up.
[time=1717] He said I power up in the physical, mental, social, financial and spiritual arenas of my life.
[time=1725] Now he's really guilty of that.
[time=1727] I'm not.
[time=1728] I've never done that.
[time=1729] But I have seen that in Mitchell a lot.
[time=1731] All those physical, mental, social, financial, spiritual power and up on people.
[time=1736] Right Susan?
[time=1739] Loving the world causes me.
[time=1741] If I love the world and the things of this world then I want those things.
[time=1745] I want the world and so I'll manipulate my life and power up on people to get them on my team or if they're weak enough just use them.
[time=1754] Just abuse them and get my way.
[time=1759] That's a lock.
[time=1761] That keeps me from being the person that God has designed me to be when I'm fully surrendered to him and his spirit fills me up.
[time=1771] Life's not like that.
[time=1776] That happens at home.
[time=1777] It happens at work.
[time=1778] It happens with friends.
[time=1779] It happens in the church, Mitchell said.
[time=1782] And it does.
[time=1784] You see it in yourself and you see it in others all the time.
[time=1787] And you know what?
[time=1788] Cam's naturally.
[time=1789] We have a disposition toward it.
[time=1791] Don't have to really work hard at it.
[time=1794] Secondly the next week Kelly talked to us about pride.
[time=1798] And he said pride is a self-promoting conceit.
[time=1803] Self-promoting conceit.
[time=1805] A preoccupation with one's own agenda and interests.
[time=1809] It was interesting when we talked about this, Kelly said man that's the one he struggles with the most of these three.
[time=1814] Mitchell said power is the one he struggles with the most and I struggle the most with pleasure.
[time=1818] So it was weird that we didn't do it that way on purpose but that maybe it's because when we studied these we found out we got a real problem there.
[time=1826] Maybe if I had studied power and pride I might have discovered I got a serious problem there.
[time=1831] Does that probably do?
[time=1833] Pride.
[time=1834] A self-promoting conceit.
[time=1835] A preoccupation with one's own agenda and interests.
[time=1838] That is a lock that locks up my heart and keeps it from being the tender,
[time=1846] penetrable organ and emotional part of me.
[time=1851] The whole of who I am, my soul, my mind, my heart, my spirit locks him out.
[time=1863] Loving the world moves me to be proud, causes me to rely on my abilities, causes me to be dependent on me alone, not on him.
[time=1874] Locking that thing up, thinking I can do it, keeps me from being effective.
[time=1880] Oh I'll be real effective to accomplish some temporal things.
[time=1884] But I won't be effective the way God's designed me to be effective for eternal things.
[time=1888] I lock him out with my own pride.
[time=1892] You know where I do it?
[time=1894] Every place that I do the power up thing.
[time=1896] At home, at work, with neighbors, at church, just takes a little different form in each of those arenas.
[time=1903] Sometimes I get so good at those things that people think I'm really for them when I'm using them.
[time=1910] Some people are really slick at it.
[time=1916] Well, the door represents our hearts, remember? Locked up with power, with pride, and with pleasure, according to 1 John.
[time=1927] The key.
[time=1931] I got one here.
[time=1935] The key is Christ.
[time=1940] We're going to see in a little bit. He unlocks it all.
[time=1947] Faith in Christ.
[time=1950] By grace, God revealed the truth to me.
[time=1955] Through my inability to keep the law, I recognize I'm a sinner.
[time=1960] He gave us the law so we'd all know we need help, we can't keep the rules.
[time=1967] So He presents the law to us. Paul teaches us in Romans.
[time=1972] God gives us the law so it reveals our need.
[time=1975] And then we say, "Help! I can't keep the rules. I can't be perfect."
[time=1982] And by grace, He reveals the key to unlock all of that in Christ.
[time=1987] As Christ comes here, dies on the cross for my sin.
[time=1992] By faith in that, I am adopted into His family, and I surrender to His Lordship.
[time=2000] Saved by faith, surrendering to His Lordship, I'm a fully surrendered believer in Christ.
[time=2006] That's what we long for around here.
[time=2008] And Kelly said in Philippians 2, "Even Jesus surrendered." Jesus Himself surrendered to the Father. You know what it says in there?
[time=2017] If you study this, you'll realize Jesus didn't really want to die on the cross.
[time=2021] He was asking God the Father for another way.
[time=2024] If there's another way, let this cut past from me.
[time=2027] Remember that prayer in John?
[time=2030] But the Father had ordained a plan, and He said, "But not my will. I'm not going to lock up."
[time=2038] "I'm not going to lock up my heart," Jesus said to the Father.
[time=2041] "Thy will be done. I'm surrendering to you, your Lord of my life."
[time=2049] Philippians 2, he says, "He didn't even consider equality with God something to be grasped." He took on the nature of a servant serving God the Father.
[time=2058] Powerful.
[time=2063] Well, that's the key.
[time=2066] What's the lock?
[time=2068] The lock this week is seeking pleasure.
[time=2073] Like I told you, I connect with this one too well.
[time=2076] It's like for years I would manipulate my schedule.
[time=2080] I'd just massage it.
[time=2082] You know, I'd keep some loose things each day.
[time=2084] Try to make that so that if anybody came up with a plan for a party, I could be there.
[time=2090] And even if there wasn't room in the schedule, if you go ask Marge or Teresa or anybody
[time=2096] that's ever handled my schedule, you'll find out somehow for these particular interruptions,
[time=2102] I could move the schedule around and make it happen some way.
[time=2107] Now, opportunities of service didn't really do that.
[time=2112] Like opportunities of golf and having a cup of coffee with somebody and really just talking, listening to anybody's party for me.
[time=2120] I was at work the other day in a new office and I was in there for three hours uninterrupted.
[time=2126] And I was losing my mind.
[time=2129] And I went out to the people that were working in the outer office.
[time=2132] I said, "I know you guys don't know me very well and I know I really don't work with you, but would you just come back periodically and go, "Hey, how are you?" I said, "Because then I can get something done." But that's way too long.
[time=2141] Three hours was way too long for me to not have an interruption.
[time=2146] I like parties.
[time=2150] Remember it said the lust of the flesh there in 1 John.
[time=2153] 1 John 2 16 says that flesh can be something that I lust to satisfy.
[time=2162] The lust of the flesh isn't really easy to define because truthfully lust is the opposite of love.
[time=2176] The opposite of love isn't hate.
[time=2180] When I say I love you, I should be willing to give to you.
[time=2184] The opposite of lust, the opposite of love, illicit bodily appetites, lust.
[time=2190] When I say I love you, I should be willing to give to you.
[time=2193] But I'll tell you, a lot of people, especially a lot of 15, 16, 17 year old boys,
[time=2199] they say I love you pretty easily.
[time=2201] And I tell girls all the time, they don't mean that.
[time=2205] They say I love you. They mean I lust for you to satisfy me.
[time=2211] I said, "So when you hear I love you, just replace those words." You hear me, you guys?
[time=2216] "Just replace those words with I lust to satisfy my own flesh after you."
[time=2223] That's what they're saying.
[time=2225] Now, they don't even think about that necessarily.
[time=2228] They just know those words work.
[time=2232] The opposite of love is lust.
[time=2235] Illicit bodily appetites, like gluttony, sex outside the context of marriage,
[time=2242] drugs that satisfy you temporarily.
[time=2247] My sister-in-law gave me a new one yesterday.
[time=2249] She said, "Here's a new illicit bodily appetite, sleep." She said, "She struggles because she wants to escape through sleep."
[time=2258] And she has family members that do that.
[time=2262] Illicit bodily appetite, really there are escape mechanisms when you think about them.
[time=2267] And they're very temporary, but they do satisfy for a little bit.
[time=2273] Well, gluttony's one I connect with.
[time=2276] That of all those I think is probably most dominant in my life today.
[time=2281] I like ding-dongs a lot.
[time=2285] Now, hear me. I said plural.
[time=2288] There's an "s" on the internet.
[time=2290] Ding-dong.
[time=2291] Like, I'm one of those people that, if I did massage my schedule because somebody wanted to play two hours of fast golf in the middle of the day, I might stay at workman later that night because that's dark.
[time=2304] You can't golf then.
[time=2306] Golf during the daylight.
[time=2307] Stay late.
[time=2308] Get home.
[time=2309] Then feel, boy, I really worked late tonight.
[time=2311] Well, because I golfed.
[time=2313] And then feel like I need to satisfy.
[time=2316] I deserve a treat.
[time=2317] Now, for me, a treat is not a ding-dong.
[time=2320] It's a box of ding-dongs.
[time=2323] That's funny because it's not an exaggeration.
[time=2327] It's the truth.
[time=2328] And it's sad.
[time=2330] I can eat the whole box.
[time=2332] And you know what?
[time=2333] If I can have a twinkie or two in the middle of that to kind of flip the taste from chocolate to that, I'm good with that.
[time=2340] Gluttony is something I can connect with.
[time=2343] I'm a person who can absolutely gorge themselves on something that they like
[time=2349] and I'll look for opportunities to reward me that way.
[time=2353] Some of you are really smiling because you've seen me do it.
[time=2356] Man, I connect with that gluttony thing.
[time=2359] Sex outside of marriage.
[time=2361] Illicit bodily appetites.
[time=2362] Now, let me just, for a minute, help you.
[time=2365] I don't think in terms of some perverted sexual act that you've put on a list somewhere.
[time=2371] This includes men.
[time=2373] Remember this one?
[time=2374] Lusting after a woman.
[time=2376] Jesus said, pluck your eye out.
[time=2380] There'd be a lot of eyeless men walking around if everybody did it every time.
[time=2385] Jesus said, this is very serious.
[time=2387] Helping us to understand who we are as sinners.
[time=2390] He said, when you lust after a woman in your heart, you've committed adultery.
[time=2398] He said, gouge it out.
[time=2401] I don't think he wanted us to gouge him all out, but he sure wanted us to understand the severity of that issue.
[time=2407] Now, lust, every perverted sexual act you can think of.
[time=2413] Now, let me define that for you.
[time=2415] Every single sexual act outside of a husband and wife having sex in marriage is a perversion of that and gets slumped in the same pot.
[time=2429] We pile it all in the same pile.
[time=2431] Heterosexuality outside of marriage.
[time=2434] Beastiality.
[time=2435] Homosexuality.
[time=2436] I don't care what theality is.
[time=2440] They're all in the same kettle outside of heterosexuality inside of God-ordained marriages.
[time=2453] Some people, they just keep locking it up.
[time=2456] They do the pornographic thing or they do.
[time=2459] There are lots of different ways in which kind of we grade them.
[time=2462] This isn't quite so bad, no, they're all fit in the same kettle.
[time=2471] Boys, say I love you.
[time=2473] They mean I lust after you.
[time=2475] Don't forget that because that's who they are in their predisposition for satisfying their own flesh.
[time=2482] Born that way.
[time=2485] Our flesh is our deceptive self that tempts us to sin for our own gratification.
[time=2493] Our flesh is our deceptive self that tempts us to sin for our own gratification at the expense of others or the displeasure of the Lord.
[time=2510] We are tempted by our own flesh.
[time=2514] Three big enemies in your life.
[time=2517] Write them down.
[time=2518] Get them figured out.
[time=2519] No, recognize them.
[time=2520] Spot them.
[time=2521] Satan and his demons are our enemy.
[time=2526] Now, they can't be everywhere.
[time=2528] There are a limited number of them and they are not omnipresent like God is.
[time=2535] They are our enemy though and if you are attacked by Satan or his demons, we need to be very specific about yielding to God and begging God to help us through that.
[time=2546] We need God to help us through that attack.
[time=2549] The second enemy that we have is the world.
[time=2552] Now, a lot of folks, I've been in churches where I've heard a guy preach and they'll start talking about some person or persons or organizations and they'll attack them like they're the world.
[time=2564] Well, they're the very people Jesus spent his time with trying to woo them, loving them, reaching out to them.
[time=2572] It's not the people of the world.
[time=2574] It's the world system that naturally entices me into powering up, being filled with pride and lusting after my own pleasure.
[time=2588] That worldly system is our enemy. Don't be conformed to the patterns of this worldly said.
[time=2595] Be transformed by renewing your mind with ancient words, the words that help us combat what comes naturally as we just willingly conform to the patterns of worldliness that bring us stuff.
[time=2612] Watch out for your own flesh.
[time=2614] That's your third enemy.
[time=2618] Satan is demons, the world, and your own flesh.
[time=2621] James says we deceive ourselves, our own flesh.
[time=2626] You know what?
[time=2627] There were times I could eat the whole box be totally sick and still say, "Yeah, but that was worth it.
[time=2633] I lied down a bit. I can't even go to sleep. I'm so ding donged."
[time=2641] But I could justify it.
[time=2643] And then the next time that I worked hard, I could justify it again.
[time=2647] I deceived me over and over again.
[time=2651] You know what? I know I'm more productive for the kingdom when I'm healthy.
[time=2655] That's a fact.
[time=2657] Now that healthy doesn't mean we're all the same shape.
[time=2661] Healthy means what you look like when you eat well, exercise as well as you can, and get the proper amount of rest.
[time=2669] You'll look like some people, I believe, and I was trying to think about this one.
[time=2673] Less after looking like something that takes all of their time.
[time=2678] If you body build all of the time, there's something going on there that's not healthy.
[time=2686] I do that with other parts of my life too.
[time=2692] Let's look at Ephesians 4, 17 through 19.
[time=2695] So I tell you this and insist on it in the Lord that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do.
[time=2705] Now folks, the Gentiles live in this natural condition of power, pride, and pleasure.
[time=2714] They took drugs then too to satisfy them temporarily.
[time=2719] They had sex too outside of the institution of marriage.
[time=2724] They also were gluttons.
[time=2727] As a matter of fact, some societies made a real institution out of it.
[time=2731] They had locations where you could just go power up on food, throw it up, get some more.
[time=2738] I'd have been there.
[time=2741] That's a scary thing.
[time=2743] I would have been there.
[time=2747] The old man, look at this.
[time=2749] So I tell you this and insist on it in the Lord that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do in the futility of their thinking.
[time=2755] It's empty.
[time=2756] They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God.
[time=2760] That's the other side of those locks.
[time=2762] Separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts.
[time=2768] Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality, pleasure seeking.
[time=2775] But to indulge in every kind of impurity with a continual less for more.
[time=2779] That's me.
[time=2784] That was Solomon too.
[time=2788] Solomon's palace was almost four times the size of the magnificent temple he built for the Lord.
[time=2798] His palace, as a matter of fact, it was more than four times.
[time=2801] It was more than four times bigger than the temple.
[time=2804] You have to house 700 wives and 300 concubines.
[time=2807] You've got to have a lot of space, continual less for more.
[time=2814] He had all kinds of stuff.
[time=2817] First King says he was greater in riches than all of the other kings on the earth.
[time=2827] Then in Proverbs 23 it says this.
[time=2830] When you sit to dine with a ruler, note well what is before you.
[time=2834] And listen to this.
[time=2835] And put a knife to your throat.
[time=2837] Do you hear that?
[time=2839] I'll do it again.
[time=2840] When you sit to dine with a ruler, note well what is before you.
[time=2843] And put a knife to your throat if you're given to gluttony.
[time=2849] Do not crave his delicacies.
[time=2852] For that food is deceptive.
[time=2858] Nancy and I have a good friend that took us to Hawaii.
[time=2862] It was a really nice trip.
[time=2866] We got off the plane, got in the rental car, drove to the resort that we were staying in.
[time=2871] And we got there.
[time=2873] There was a guy, or a guy, I can't remember which, there with a tray.
[time=2877] And they had these rolled up wash claws that had been in the cooler.
[time=2884] They were really nice and cold and chilled.
[time=2886] It was hot in Hawaii.
[time=2888] We got out of the car, they came up with this tray and each of us had our own little wash claws that we could.
[time=2893] The dabblers.
[time=2895] Then we got to the reception desk, the information desk, and they took our luggage away and
[time=2901] they said, "Hey, you want to go out and see the beach right here?" And I said, "Yeah, that'd be great." So we walk out there.
[time=2906] So the four of us walk out to the beach and this guy starts following us with four beach chairs and towels.
[time=2912] Now we're fully dressed like this.
[time=2914] I probably had shorts on.
[time=2915] And he's following us with, and when we stopped, he said, "Is this okay?"
[time=2922] And we're going, "Yeah, it'd be all right." So he puts the chairs down.
[time=2926] He gives us some more of those wash claws.
[time=2928] They have those spritzy bottles.
[time=2929] They come around.
[time=2930] They spritz you.
[time=2931] You don't have to spritz yourself.
[time=2932] They spritz you with the bottles.
[time=2939] That food is deceptive.
[time=2943] There was a lot more going on that week too.
[time=2946] Here's the hard part.
[time=2947] At first, I'm there thinking this country bumpkin is not comfortable in this neighborhood.
[time=2952] By Wednesday, I liked it.
[time=2955] I liked it a lot.
[time=2956] And I thought I deserved it.
[time=2959] Now here's the hard part.
[time=2961] Where do you go on the next vacation?
[time=2965] I'm still thinking about that place.
[time=2968] It's deceptive.
[time=2969] It causes me to think that that's life.
[time=2974] Now folks, the four seasons is not wrong.
[time=2978] If I get to experience that as a byproduct of having a friend who can afford to do that and take us there, or if I happen to be in an occupation where I can afford to go do that, there's nothing wrong with that.
[time=2988] He said, "Command those who are rich in this present world, not to be arrogant or put their hope in wealth, which is so uncertain, but to put their hope in God who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment."
[time=3003] He gives us that stuff sometimes.
[time=3005] When it's a byproduct, I'm to enjoy that.
[time=3011] If I'm in pursuit of it, it's a lock that keeps me from experiencing who God really is
[time=3018] and who He wants me to be.
[time=3021] He goes on there and says, "Command them to be rich in good deeds, generous and willing to share."
[time=3029] He shared the four seasons with us.
[time=3032] It was a wonderful thing for him to do.
[time=3036] But it's deceptive, and it's hard, and I've got to be careful.
[time=3040] I'll start to think that I deserve that instead of getting that as some kind of a reward for something.
[time=3046] I start to think that's the way everybody's supposed to live.
[time=3050] Oh, man, is that dangerous.
[time=3054] Well, Solomon, after experiencing all the pleasures you could possibly experience,
[time=3060] more than any of us, probably more than all of us combined.
[time=3064] Solomon, after experiencing all of that, he says in Ecclesiastes 2 verses 1 through 11,
[time=3071] this is the summary of that whole section of Scripture.
[time=3074] It says pleasure is meaningless.
[time=3078] Now, enjoy it if it comes up, but you've got to keep it in your head.
[time=3082] It is not eternal.
[time=3085] It doesn't have eternal value.
[time=3087] It's not what I need to be pursuing in life.
[time=3090] He is eternal.
[time=3093] He wants to have a relationship with me.
[time=3096] He is who I should be pursuing for all of my life.
[time=3100] And if I get to do that stuff as a byproduct, enjoy it.
[time=3105] But look out because it'll tempt you and you'll start to think, now, if I just do this and that, if we give up that, if we don't give to that,
[time=3115] if we don't sacrifice that, we can do this.
[time=3123] Well, the door.
[time=3126] That's our heart.
[time=3129] The door, our hearts, yielding to the lust of our flesh,
[time=3137] locks the door of our heart, keeping the eternal God out.
[time=3145] And the flesh, get this, temporarily satisfied within.
[time=3152] When I lock the door of my heart with power or pride or pleasure,
[time=3158] I get a temporary rush that's really satisfying.
[time=3165] But it locks out the eternal God and a relationship with Him
[time=3173] that the Bible says will reap rewards in heaven forever.
[time=3179] So I'm going to do a one week deal and do all my life for that.
[time=3187] I'm going to start thinking about gluttony, sexual satisfaction.
[time=3193] All the things that give us temporary, they are not only fleeting.
[time=3196] Remember what it said there in Ephesians 4, it says with a continual lust for more.
[time=3201] You know why there's a continual lust for more?
[time=3203] Because it just doesn't last.
[time=3205] None of it does.
[time=3211] Men that sacrifice their families for 20 seconds of rush
[time=3219] in a sexual relationship outside their marriage.
[time=3225] It's been going on for centuries.
[time=3228] They just chuck all that.
[time=3230] Well, they're chucking more than that.
[time=3232] There's an eternal God that they're neglecting and rejecting
[time=3238] to continue to lust for more.
[time=3242] Women you have your own.
[time=3248] Our hearts yielding to the lust of our flesh locks the door.
[time=3253] You get it?
[time=3256] Our heart.
[time=3257] And we keep the eternal God out to get just this momentary satisfaction
[time=3263] that's so temporal. And then in just a little bit we need some more.
[time=3269] And we start on our next trek toward it.
[time=3275] What's the key?
[time=3279] Full surrender to a God who by faith, His grace saved me.
[time=3290] This key is physical, but I want you to think of the person of God.
[time=3295] He is the key to our full surrender.
[time=3302] By faith in Him and Christ alone, God the Father has redeemed us,
[time=3309] and we fully surrender to His Lordship recognizing that God of the universe is Lord of all.
[time=3317] And so we can unlock these things.
[time=3323] Now, this takes a little while, but it's worth it to illustrate this.
[time=3333] These three locks, power, these are real hold.
[time=3349] Pride and pleasure.
[time=3360] We put these on. Actually, you know what? We're born with them.
[time=3365] They just get bigger over time. They get stronger, but we put these on.
[time=3370] We're born with these power, pride, and pleasure locks.
[time=3374] And God says that He will be pleased.
[time=3380] I can bring pleasure to Him by understanding that He is my God.
[time=3386] I fear the living God, and I bring Him pleasure.
[time=3391] In Psalm 147, it's Jeff Koach verse. He taught it to me a long time ago.
[time=3395] It says, "His pleasure is not in the strength of a horse." I think it should come up.
[time=3399] Nor His delight in the legs of a man.
[time=3401] The Lord delights in those who fear Him, who put their hope in His unfailing love.
[time=3406] When I place my hope in Him, He unlocks those locks.
[time=3411] I can bring delight to Him. I can bring Him pleasure by placing my hope in His un…
[time=3418] It's not my works that bring Him pleasure. It's not my legs and my strength.
[time=3421] It's not my horses, the stuff that I have that bring Him pleasure.
[time=3427] I can be pleased in the Lord, Ephesians 4, 20 through 24, the finish of that section that we were looking at before.
[time=3436] It says, "You, however, did not come to know Christ that way, like the Gentiles." Surely you heard of Him and were taught in Him in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus.
[time=3444] You were taught with regard to your former way of life to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires, full surrender, to be made new in the attitude of your minds and to put on the new self created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.
[time=3460] That's how you were created. You were created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.
[time=3469] And He is there to embrace you. He says, "I'm the key. Unlock those locks.
[time=3475] Don't be full of power, pride, and pleasure. Be holy as I am holy."
[time=3482] What do you want? Another temporary rush or life with the creator of it all?
[time=3494] Our Father in Heaven, we bow down because you are God and we are not.
[time=3501] And Lord, we're born with those locks on our heart.
[time=3508] We are sinners. We are looking for self gratification.
[time=3513] And God, I pray that every person in here would come to faith in Christ.
[time=3519] I pray that you would redeem every person in here.
[time=3523] And that we would then be faithful to tell the truth about the key to other people's hearts, that it's you and you alone.
[time=3534] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3538] Have a great Sunday.
[time=3540] You are holy, holy. God wonders. God wonders beyond our galaxy.
[time=3552] You are holy, holy. You are the first to pledge your majesty.
[time=3563] You are holy, holy. God of Heaven, and God of Heaven, and God of Heaven, and God of Heaven.
