[time=466] [MUSIC - 94 seconds]
[time=565] Let's sing this verse out.
[time=571] Oh, to praise our great identity.
[time=576] [MUSIC - 35 seconds]
[time=618] Father, that's our prayer this morning.
[time=622] That you would seal our hearts for you.
[time=625] Father, the lyrics just said that...
[time=629] that we want you to bind our wandering hearts to you.
[time=634] [MUSIC - 20 seconds]
[time=657] And get rid of this wandering spirit that wants to roam far away from you.
[time=663] [MUSIC] How deep the Father's love for us [MUSIC] How vast beyond all measure [MUSIC] That He should give His only Son [MUSIC] And make a wretch His treasure [MUSIC] How great the pain of sealing us [MUSIC] The Father turns His face away [MUSIC] As wounds which more than chosen want [MUSIC] Bring any sons to glory [MUSIC] Behold the man upon the cross [MUSIC] My sin upon His shoulders [MUSIC] The shame that hear my mocking voice [MUSIC] Call out among the scoffers [MUSIC] It was my sin that hurled him there [MUSIC] Until it was a complex [MUSIC] His dying breath has brought me alive [MUSIC] And I know that it is free [MUSIC]
[time=771] [MUSIC]
[time=774] [MUSIC] I will not boast in any pain [MUSIC] No gifts, no harm, no wisdom [MUSIC] Would I will boast in Jesus Christ [MUSIC] His death and resurrection [MUSIC] Why should I gain from His reward [MUSIC] I cannot give an answer [MUSIC] But this I know with all my heart [MUSIC] His wounds have made my ransom [MUSIC] Why should I gain from His reward [MUSIC] I cannot give an answer [MUSIC] But this I know with all my heart [MUSIC] His wounds have made my ransom [MUSIC]
[time=844] [MUSIC - 10 seconds]
[time=900] What has he seen in you? What has he watched you do?
[time=904] What roads has he observed you going down?
[time=907] And in the end, there's a hand, a hand of love and grace that has time and time again led you back to what is right and pure and true.
[time=920] [MUSIC]
[time=933] So do that just in your own heart. Just tell them thanks.
[time=936] [MUSIC - 10 seconds]
[time=953] God, it says in Ephesians 2 that we were dead
[time=956] [MUSIC]
[time=962] But because of your great love, you made us alive.
[time=967] And you've given us a privilege of knowing and walking with you.
[time=971] [MUSIC]
[time=1021] Thanks, Corbin. Hey, just a few things.
[time=1023] Coming up in September.
[time=1024] Can you believe we're already talking about September?
[time=1027] But most of you know, and if you haven't seen it up around here, you'll see a lot more of it.
[time=1031] Tommy Walker's coming back that first full weekend of September.
[time=1035] We're looking forward to a great, great weekend with him again.
[time=1038] The following week, we're going to kick off the fall around here with a six-week series.
[time=1044] And this is something that we are going to really, really throw some energy and some heart and prayer into.
[time=1051] A six-week series called "Real Love." Real love.
[time=1056] We're going to invite not only this family to participate in this series as we study the scriptures and look at what it means to be the recipients of and the givers of real love.
[time=1069] But we're going to invite this entire community as well.
[time=1072] And love, you know, love is something that modern culture current society they've just pretty much trashed.
[time=1081] The truth about it.
[time=1083] And what it really means and what it really looks like.
[time=1085] And those of you that know him know that it originates with him.
[time=1089] It's the story of the Bible.
[time=1090] God's love being extended to all generations.
[time=1093] And so we want to give six weeks to an in-depth study of what real love really looks like.
[time=1100] And one of the things that we're going to ask you to do, and we would love for you to start doing this now, is you can go on the website.
[time=1106] And we would love for you to contribute just a brief story from your own life.
[time=1110] A time when you've experienced, it doesn't matter who you are, student, young adult, older folks, all of you.
[time=1116] Just a time when you have in your life experienced real love.
[time=1121] Where God and his mercy, God and his grace just kind of extended to you in whatever the circumstance was.
[time=1128] Real love.
[time=1130] Maybe he did that just directly with you.
[time=1132] Maybe he did it through some others that he brought along you in your life.
[time=1136] But a time in a situation where you experienced in your life the real, unchanging, unfading, powerful love of God.
[time=1144] And if you wouldn't mind just a couple of paragraphs on that.
[time=1147] Not three or four pages, just a couple of paragraphs.
[time=1150] And you can submit that through the website.
[time=1152] If you don't have a computer, write it down and bring it to us and we'll throw it in the stack.
[time=1156] But we'd love to just kind of get us started with you helping in that way.
[time=1159] Okay?
[time=1160] Good deal.
[time=1161] Okay.
[time=1162] Thanks very much.
[time=1163] Stephen.
[time=1164] This morning what we're going to try to do is help each of us discover
[time=1171] what our heart is like when we respond to God with a giving heart.
[time=1178] Last three weeks, you know, we looked at the power and pride and pleasure.
[time=1183] Those doors of our heart locked up with what comes very naturally to us in those arenas that we're prideful, powerful and pleasure-seeking people.
[time=1193] And we also understood that Christ the key to those locks by the Father was sent here.
[time=1201] Did you hear it in the song?
[time=1202] It says, "How deep the Father's love for us, how vast beyond all measure
[time=1208] that he should give his only Son to make a wretch."
[time=1216] His treasure.
[time=1220] He unlocked those locks and he values us so much that he gave his Son to do that for us.
[time=1229] Now, we say, once we understand salvation, once you realize that you're a sinner,
[time=1235] separated from God forever, and he's done that for us, once you really get it, that he has saved you by his grace through the blood of Christ, then you go, "Wow, what do I do?" I mean, that's a natural response.
[time=1250] What do you want from me now?
[time=1252] And the word is full of what he wants from us.
[time=1255] And it's different for Kelly than for me, and it's different for you because he doesn't spell it out number by number and tell you how much time, how much of your talent to give, how much of your treasure should you give.
[time=1268] He doesn't do that, he lets us live in the tension of not knowing how much,
[time=1275] but knowing we need to do it.
[time=1277] And that's a treat.
[time=1279] If you embrace that, the tension becomes a treat, an adventure.
[time=1284] "Oh, I get to do this much this year.
[time=1287] I could only do that much last year.
[time=1289] I can do this much today.
[time=1290] Yesterday, I could only do that." And you look for the opportunities.
[time=1294] When you're living life responding to the love of the Father, then a giving heart evolves.
[time=1302] That's what we want to talk about today.
[time=1304] Well, my favorite pastor wrote this.
[time=1308] "God has given so much.
[time=1311] He has graciously extended mercy, life, forgiveness, and joy to each of us.
[time=1318] He has offered peace, purpose, healing, comfort, and redemption.
[time=1323] Not at a price to you or me.
[time=1326] Not because we deserved it or earned it, but simply because he is a good God,
[time=1332] a giving God who loves you." Well, what's my response to that?
[time=1336] Am I a giving person?
[time=1338] Are you a giving person?
[time=1340] Around Blackhawk, we like to say this, around here, we are asking you, are you giving him your time, your talent, and your treasure?
[time=1352] Now, like I said before, that'll be different for each one of us.
[time=1357] That's the treat.
[time=1360] We don't want to know that it's 10% of that and 3% of that in one hour there.
[time=1364] That would be boring.
[time=1366] God, in his infinite wisdom, gave us life and choices.
[time=1373] What's it look like when it comes to your time?
[time=1378] In Colossians chapter 1, he says that, "We get the opportunity to live a life worthy of the Lord."
[time=1386] Look at that first verse there.
[time=1388] "And we pray this in order that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and may please him in every way, bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God, being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience and joyfully giving thanks to the Father." Now, to get that, we get to do this, to give thanks to him, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the kingdom of light, for he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
[time=1427] When that's real, when I have been redeemed by him, I say, "What do you want me to do with my time, Lord?
[time=1435] I only have so much left, folks.
[time=1438] You do too." And you know, the truth is we don't even know if we have the amount of time that we think we have.
[time=1446] So what am I going to do with it?
[time=1449] In Psalm 46, it's a familiar Psalm, you know.
[time=1454] Verse 10 says, "Be still and know that I am God." But preceding that, he says these things about himself.
[time=1459] "I'm your refuge, strength, help, glad dwelling.
[time=1463] I'll be with you. I'm your fortress." To really know those things, we need to be still.
[time=1472] We need to hear from him.
[time=1475] This is how you hear from him.
[time=1477] You read his words.
[time=1479] You hear his words taught.
[time=1481] But you don't just let them go in and out.
[time=1484] You hear them, and then you do them.
[time=1489] He says, "Take your time to do the things that I teach you." In order to know the things that he teaches us, we have to be spending time with him.
[time=1498] How much time?
[time=1499] I don't know.
[time=1500] Think about that just for a minute.
[time=1503] Just think about that.
[time=1504] No answer here.
[time=1505] We're not going to give you, again, a bar to shoot for.
[time=1508] But I just wonder what runs through your mind.
[time=1512] If you just were to think for a moment about all that he has given, all that he has made possible, all that he has granted, all the love, the depth of his mercy and grace, all that we've just been talking about, all of that poured out on you, and then somebody comes along and just asks you to kind of wrestle in your mind with just a hypothetical here, just a figure, like how much time
[time=1539] would be a good response for you.
[time=1544] He desires your offering of time.
[time=1551] Well, how much?
[time=1555] An hour?
[time=1558] Two, I don't know.
[time=1559] Where's your mind go?
[time=1562] Some of you right now are mentally racing through your day planner.
[time=1567] Thinking about slots, you know, you could throw them in.
[time=1573] It's just a question.
[time=1576] One way to evaluate that.
[time=1578] When you're alone, what do you think about?
[time=1583] When you're alone, what do you spend your time thinking about?
[time=1586] Are you more and more and more conscious of God through your day?
[time=1594] Good question.
[time=1596] Now, when should I have this alone time with him?
[time=1599] I used to hate it when people would say it had to be in the morning.
[time=1602] There are a lot of people that just say, "You know what, though?
[time=1605] That's growing on me." Because what I find to be true is I have a whole lot of stuff that goes on from the time I get up until the time I go to bed.
[time=1615] And if I wait to spend time with him later in that process, a whole lot went on in that day that I needed prepared for.
[time=1623] So I want to check 18 times in the Psalms.
[time=1626] It talks about being still with him in the morning.
[time=1631] Start your day that way.
[time=1635] Secondly, we want to ask this question.
[time=1639] Do you have a giving heart with your talents?
[time=1642] Matthew 25 is a really familiar parable.
[time=1645] It's the parable of the talents.
[time=1647] I love it so much because talents really are numerical coins.
[time=1653] They're cash.
[time=1655] Those were talents.
[time=1657] But you can really apply this to the way we use the word "talent" today, and it works perfectly, and it fits.
[time=1663] The parable of a talents, in Matthew 25, we won't read it all, but look at the beginning.
[time=1668] It says, "To one, he gave five talents of money.
[time=1671] To another, two talents, and to another, one talent, each according to his ability."
[time=1677] Now, this is a guy that went away.
[time=1678] Remember, he's a landowner.
[time=1680] He's going away on a journey.
[time=1681] And he gives five talents to one employee and two talents to another employee and one talent to another one according to their ability to reproduce using those talents.
[time=1691] The guy with five invests, five, he comes back.
[time=1694] He gives him five more.
[time=1697] He says, "Well done." The guy with two talents invests his and makes two more.
[time=1703] He had the ability to earn two more.
[time=1705] He says, "Well done." Same thing.
[time=1708] The man has one talent.
[time=1710] The employee that has one talent, he says, "I was afraid of you, so I dug a hole in the ground and stuck it in there because I know you're harsh." He says, "You better believe I'm harsh." He says, "Well done.
[time=1721] Well done.
[time=1722] Poorly done.
[time=1724] You lived in fear and didn't invest what you had.
[time=1726] I gave you this to invest.
[time=1728] Folks, he has given us talent.
[time=1734] And he really desires that we will do according to our ability
[time=1740] what he has given us the opportunity to do.
[time=1744] Everybody can serve.
[time=1747] Do it for him and for each other.
[time=1750] There are all kinds of one anothers in the Bible.
[time=1752] We need to meet each other's needs.
[time=1754] You were talking to me a little bit ago about what talents are really important.
[time=1758] Yeah.
[time=1759] There are some simple ones.
[time=1761] Some really simple ones.
[time=1762] You know what?
[time=1763] So many times people think, "Well I have just, I'm only able to do this." You know what?
[time=1768] He gave you that and he wants you to invest whatever that only thing is.
[time=1775] Sometimes I've had my greatest joy doing the simplest thing serving.
[time=1779] I love to drive people places.
[time=1782] I don't know why, but I really enjoy that.
[time=1785] If I can just load up a van and be responsible to be a safe driver, I like that.
[time=1790] Some of us can clean things.
[time=1793] We have all kinds of, some of us, he's given other gifts to them.
[time=1796] We need to use those.
[time=1797] But he's given them according to your ability by his decree.
[time=1803] Make sure at the end of it all, you get to hear, "Well done."
[time=1809] And then it comes to our treasure.
[time=1812] And familiar passage, we look at this a lot when it talks about giving.
[time=1816] 2 Corinthians chapter 9.
[time=1819] He says, "Remember this, whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly.
[time=1823] And whoever sows generously will also reap generously." Again, those generous words, instead of 15%, 3%, 2%, $100, 20, none of that generously.
[time=1835] Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion.
[time=1842] Don't feel compelled by other people.
[time=1845] Let God compel you.
[time=1846] For God loves a cheerful giver.
[time=1850] And God is able to make all grace abound to you so that in all things, at all times, having all that you need,
[time=1856] you will abound in every good work.
[time=1859] As it is written, he has scattered abroad his gifts to the poor.
[time=1863] His righteousness endures forever.
[time=1866] Now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will also supply and increase your store of seed
[time=1874] will enlarge the harvest of your righteousness.
[time=1878] You will be made rich in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion.
[time=1883] And through us, your generosity will result in thanks, giving to God.
[time=1889] This service that you perform is not only supplying the needs of God's people, but is also overflowing in many expressions of thanks to God.
[time=1898] Because of the service by which you have proved yourselves, men will praise God for the obedience that accompanies your confession of the gospel of Christ.
[time=1906] And for your generosity in sharing with them and with everyone else.
[time=1910] You realize our generous giving is an expression of our thanks and other people who benefit from it often
[time=1918] get to also say thank you God.
[time=1922] It's always an expression back to him.
[time=1924] A giving heart is somebody who wants to, is looking for the opportunity to be with him, give their time that way,
[time=1932] give their time serving him, using their talents to serve him, and use their money as a giving, as an offering to him, as an expression of thanks,
[time=1942] and as an expression of obedience.
[time=1945] Now, just a little practical deal here.
[time=1948] The Bible doesn't say the amount.
[time=1951] But when our elders lead us somewhere and we, under the leadership of those elders,
[time=1958] say, okay, we're going in this direction, and we're going to increase our budget to do that.
[time=1963] We're going to have a fundraising campaign to do that.
[time=1966] Here's a practical way to look at that.
[time=1968] If our budget goes up six percent like it did this year, if I give $150 a week and the budget goes up six percent and I say, oh,
[time=1978] we're increasing our budget six percent.
[time=1981] Now, I don't see this as just an offering to the Lord, although I really do give it that way, but this is something even lesser than that.
[time=1989] This is me doing my share.
[time=1991] If our budget's going to go up six percent, Steve and Nancy need to put six percent more in the offering.
[time=2000] So that would make us $159 a week givers.
[time=2003] Six percent of what we give, not six percent more of our total income.
[time=2007] I'll make sure you get that right.
[time=2009] Six percent of what we give, we need to give more.
[time=2012] That's a practical thing, but you know what?
[time=2014] God lets us live in that tension.
[time=2017] He doesn't spell it out for a reason.
[time=2019] And it brings joy to your heart when you get to do it that way.
[time=2023] Now, do you have a giving heart?
[time=2026] Are you really responding to the way he's unlocked the locks?
[time=2032] I hope so.
[time=2034] Talk about cheerful.
[time=2035] All right.
[time=2036] Sometimes people ask me if that means, I mean, it's not so much how you put the thing in the plate.
[time=2042] Yeah.
[time=2043] I mean, it's more than that.
[time=2045] The Bible says that we're to be cheerful givers.
[time=2048] Yeah.
[time=2049] What have you learned about that?
[time=2050] What I've discovered about being cheerful is this.
[time=2052] You know, I think one of the versions says hilarious givers, doesn't it?
[time=2056] There is something to the joy that comes.
[time=2061] And this is more than joy because joy is really something that you can do without smiling.
[time=2064] This cheerful, hilarious giving is something you do with a smile.
[time=2067] I have a privilege when I really see it that way.
[time=2071] And he says not to do it under compulsion.
[time=2075] You people shouldn't compel me to give.
[time=2077] But when I respond to him and I'm looking for the opportunity to give it because I'm thankful.
[time=2086] When I'm doing it as a response to what he's done for me, I can't give enough.
[time=2091] I can't give enough.
[time=2092] So we give as much as possible and then it's cheerful.
[time=2098] That's well said.
[time=2102] And if you sit here today and as we talk through this, I mean, there's a sense in your heart.
[time=2108] And I would suspect that more than likely maybe there is.
[time=2111] There's a sense in your heart that there's real truth in what's being said.
[time=2115] The passages that we're looking at, the things that Steve's explaining.
[time=2118] The idea of you and I out of gratitude being people who are willing to give back time and talent and treasure.
[time=2126] If there's a collective sense of amen, which usually there is, it's good to ask the question.
[time=2139] Though there's this collective sense of that's right, why is it that still so many times in your life and mind,
[time=2152] we seem reluctant, hesitant to really with passion and energy and at a sacrificial level, do it.
[time=2163] I mean, really give him with passion and heart are our time and our talent and our treasure.
[time=2172] Why is it that we so often direct our time and our talent and our treasure in other directions first,
[time=2180] leaving him when it's all said and done, left over, left over time, left over talent, left over treasure?
[time=2196] Why when there's a collective sense of amen in my own heart do I often find him getting scraps instead of the best, the most?
[time=2210] I think the answer is found as most of them are here in God's Word.
[time=2217] And I think to say it to you clearly and just plainly the answer is that you and I get duped.
[time=2222] See, we get deceived, we get tricked.
[time=2226] It's kind of a bait and switch and the enemy is really, really good at it.
[time=2232] We've been lied to and we've bought the lie that great gain and fulfillment can be found in things or pursuits other than him.
[time=2243] And let me just invite you to open up your Bible to Psalm 73. Go back there to Psalm 73.
[time=2251] The book of Psalms, kind of right there in the middle of your Bible if you open it up and you're going to see here in Psalm 73 written by a guy named Asaph.
[time=2260] You're going to see in this Psalm, you're going to realize as we make our way through this Psalm, as we ask ourselves the question,
[time=2266] why if we know this to be true about giving, why is it that so oftentimes we get pulled away from that?
[time=2274] We get sidetracked. And what you're going to see here in Psalm 73 is a guy who can identify with your pain.
[time=2280] You're going to see a guy who understands the struggle that you and I so oftentimes face.
[time=2284] And let me just say this before we go any further.
[time=2286] As we talk about giving, giving of time, giving of talent, giving of treasure, please lose the categories in your mind, okay?
[time=2296] Whether you're a $30,000 a year person or a $300,000 a year person, whether you live in 800 square feet in an apartment that you pay for monthly or you live in 10,000 with eight rooms and four.
[time=2311] But you know what? All of that in this discussion really is irrelevant.
[time=2317] It's not a matter of who has what in this discussion.
[time=2322] We're talking about what you're willing to do with the time and the talent and the treasure that God's given you.
[time=2329] And He has given you some.
[time=2333] And no matter what it looks like, no matter what it feels like, as Steve mentioned earlier, there in Matthew 25,
[time=2340] you're going to be held accountable as am I for what we did with it.
[time=2347] Make sense?
[time=2350] I want you to look at Psalm 73.
[time=2352] This guy, he understands your struggle and mine.
[time=2355] Surely, he says, look at verses one to seven out of the gate here.
[time=2359] Surely, God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart.
[time=2363] But as for me, he says, my feet came close to stumbling.
[time=2368] My steps had almost slipped.
[time=2371] Why?
[time=2372] For I was envious of the arrogant.
[time=2375] As I saw the prosperity of the wicked, for there are no pains in their death.
[time=2381] And their body is fat.
[time=2384] You ever been there?
[time=2386] You ever had those thoughts?
[time=2388] You ever wondered those things?
[time=2390] Have you ever sat there in your attempt to do and to be who he's called you to be?
[time=2395] You ever looked over to the other side of the fence and thought, my goodness.
[time=2400] They just keep getting richer.
[time=2403] They just keep having more fun.
[time=2406] They just seem to get more and more and more.
[time=2410] There doesn't even seem to be any pain in their death.
[time=2416] Wow, what a twisted statement that is.
[time=2419] That's a twisted statement, isn't it?
[time=2422] Isn't it?
[time=2424] But we get so far down that road we even start thinking things like that.
[time=2431] No pain in their death.
[time=2434] Their body is fat.
[time=2435] They are not in trouble as other men, nor are they plagued like mankind.
[time=2441] Therefore pride is their necklace.
[time=2443] The garment of violence covers them.
[time=2445] Their eye bulges from fatness.
[time=2447] The imaginations of their heart run riot.
[time=2452] They sit there and begin to think, you know what?
[time=2454] Doc, on account me in.
[time=2456] I'll take my time and my talent and my treasure.
[time=2459] I'm going to go have myself some fun.
[time=2462] It's working for them.
[time=2465] I bet it'll work for me.
[time=2469] Look at verse 11.
[time=2471] Here's that mindset.
[time=2472] Here's that perspective.
[time=2473] They say, how does God know?
[time=2475] And is there knowledge?
[time=2476] I mean, we start questioning all kinds of stuff once we go down this road.
[time=2480] Knowledge with the most high, I mean, really?
[time=2482] Behold, these are the wicked.
[time=2484] And always, they are always at ease.
[time=2488] They have increased in wealth.
[time=2490] Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure and washed my hands in innocence.
[time=2495] For I have been stricken.
[time=2497] They're out there having fun.
[time=2499] They're out there gaining in wealth.
[time=2501] They're out there having zero problems.
[time=2503] And I have been, once it's say in 14, I have been stricken all day long.
[time=2509] And chastened every morning.
[time=2515] He sits there, you know, figuratively speaking on your shoulder and mind.
[time=2519] And he whispers sometimes screams in our ear.
[time=2522] Go.
[time=2525] And we begin to slowly by the lie that there's life.
[time=2529] That's what's going on here.
[time=2530] It's the lie that there is life to be had.
[time=2534] Good life, fulfilling life in places other than, in pursuits other than him.
[time=2544] Sometimes we get so far down that road, we begin to think and we begin to say some really, really twisted stuff.
[time=2555] Hey, remind yourself this morning.
[time=2558] Maybe you know this personally.
[time=2560] Maybe you've seen it played out.
[time=2563] Find me one truly and deeply fulfilled, porn addict.
[time=2571] Find me one truly and deeply fulfilled alcoholic or adulterer or person who has put business
[time=2579] or ministry or pleasure above God.
[time=2584] Go find him.
[time=2588] Find one who in the end would come back to you or me and say, boy, it was worth it.
[time=2597] Just go find one.
[time=2599] Because see, when it gets kind of twisted in our hearts and minds, we think they're all, we think there's hundreds of them.
[time=2605] No, but now just in reality, as you sit back and you think about what really matters, you go find one.
[time=2610] Who's story, you could come and tell, who in the end would say, boy, it was worth it.
[time=2620] Even the things that we are free to enjoy are so fleeting when we think eternally.
[time=2628] Absolutely.
[time=2629] And the truth of it is, they're as fleeting when you don't think eternally.
[time=2633] Even the people that have the stuff that we see, they are bored with it.
[time=2638] I asked a guy recently who gets new cars all the time.
[time=2641] I said, how long now does the new car give you a rush?
[time=2647] How long does the new smell and he stopped and he said, you know, I think it's less than a week.
[time=2654] In less than a week, it's transportation again.
[time=2658] It's really fleeting.
[time=2660] Five kids will help that new smell go quick.
[time=2664] God, hey, he comes to his senses.
[time=2670] He comes to his senses.
[time=2672] You do as well, I hope.
[time=2675] He comes to his senses as the chapter unfolds.
[time=2679] Look at 21.
[time=2680] When my heart was embittered, verse 21 there, when my heart was embittered and I was pierced within,
[time=2687] then I was senseless and ignorant.
[time=2690] I was like a beast before you, God.
[time=2692] Nevertheless, I am continually with you.
[time=2696] You have taken hold of my right hand and it says in 24, with your counsel, you will guide me
[time=2702] and afterward receive me to glory.
[time=2706] He wakes up and he realizes that the thinking and the mindset and the perspective of those first 20 verses
[time=2715] is ignorance.
[time=2716] It is senseless.
[time=2721] He says there in 22.
[time=2724] And then in verses 25 to 28, which is what I want you to see, what we want you to see so clearly this morning.
[time=2730] In verses 25 to 28, he gives you three things.
[time=2733] Would you write these things down?
[time=2735] A giving heart.
[time=2736] A giving mindset.
[time=2738] You and I living life with him in a way whereby we can truly respond to the goodness of God,
[time=2745] the depth of his love that he poured out on you.
[time=2748] Now, as Steve asked earlier in this talk, what's your response going to be?
[time=2753] Here you go.
[time=2754] The psalmist having struggled with his truth comes to the conclusion in verse 25.
[time=2758] And here we find the first thing we want you to write down.
[time=2761] A giving heart, number one, write this down.
[time=2763] Desires only him.
[time=2767] "Whom have I in heaven but you?" he says.
[time=2770] When he's done looking over the fence, when he's done observing all the futility that's out there,
[time=2776] he says, "In the end, whom have I in heaven but you?
[time=2780] And besides you, God, I desire nothing on earth."
[time=2786] Write that down.
[time=2787] A giving heart, number one, desires only him.
[time=2790] Now, please understand, we don't mean by this, just him.
[time=2795] We're not saying you're not the desire your wife or your husband or your kids or the people that you love.
[time=2801] No, this is that you desire him most over and above everything else.
[time=2809] Desire.
[time=2810] Powerful word.
[time=2812] Watch this.
[time=2813] Desire.
[time=2814] It is an emotional excitement connected to the possession of an object from which great pleasure
[time=2824] is expected.
[time=2826] Read it again.
[time=2828] An emotional excitement that is connected to the possession of an object from which great
[time=2834] pleasure is expected.
[time=2839] Question for you this morning.
[time=2840] What object in your life do you get really, really emotionally excited about having, getting
[time=2851] a hold of, being with, you know what the psalmist is saying here?
[time=2861] The psalmist is simply and very powerfully saying this.
[time=2866] When he's saying it to young people and he's saying it to parents and he's saying it to those who have seen a lot of life, he's saying it to everyone of us.
[time=2874] I won't be emotionally excited about the cheap brief thrill of material gain.
[time=2882] I won't be emotionally revved up by the cheap and brief thrill of illicit activity or success.
[time=2891] No, I will be, he says, and you and I need to be, he says, we will be emotionally excited.
[time=2897] We will be on the edge of our seat.
[time=2900] Can't wait to have it.
[time=2902] Can't wait to touch it.
[time=2904] Can't wait to be with it.
[time=2907] We will be, the psalmist says, emotionally excited above and beyond us by God himself
[time=2914] and the privilege that he gives you and me to know him, to live in relationship with him, to walk with him.
[time=2923] When you and I are willing and ready in our hearts to desire him more than anything else,
[time=2930] then we get to enjoy the objects.
[time=2934] Yes, appropriately.
[time=2936] And then it's really fun.
[time=2938] Absolutely.
[time=2939] Because again, some of the things that might come into your minds and mind aren't in and of themselves evil.
[time=2946] It's a lot out there to enjoy, but it all falls into place when you're willing and I'm willing
[time=2953] and emotionally excited about the thought of being with, walking with him.
[time=2959] Yes.
[time=2960] C.S. Lewis said this.
[time=2963] Check this out.
[time=2964] C.S. Lewis says, we are half-hearted creatures.
[time=2967] Fooling about, this is a quote about, I read it in John Piper's book called "Desiring God."
[time=2973] And he gives us this quote from one of Lewis' sermons years ago and he's preaching about the desire of God.
[time=2980] We are half-hearted creatures, fooling about with drink and sex and ambition while infinite joy is being offered freely here.
[time=2991] We're like an ignorant child who wants nothing more than to go on making mud pies in a slum
[time=2999] because he cannot imagine what is meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea.
[time=3009] Lewis concludes, we are far too easily pleased.
[time=3016] We cheapen pleasure.
[time=3020] We cheapen real desire by allowing it to and choosing for it to be fulfilled and stuff that doesn't fill us.
[time=3030] A giving heart says, God, I give you.
[time=3032] Sacrificially, I give you my time and my talent and my treasure because you, God,
[time=3038] are my greatest pleasure.
[time=3040] You, God, are my greatest delight.
[time=3042] God, I give it to you.
[time=3044] Sacrificially, because I desire you.
[time=3049] You are my greatest delight.
[time=3052] Secondly, write this down, a giving heart trusts only him.
[time=3056] It's important to remember this.
[time=3058] A giving heart trusts only him.
[time=3061] Look with me at verse 26, it says there, my flesh and my heart may fail.
[time=3067] Okay, see this in the context of the chapter, right?
[time=3071] He got a little bit confused there at the beginning.
[time=3074] Now he's kind of come to his senses and now he's transitioning to a healthy, God-honoring perspective on all this stuff.
[time=3082] But still he says, my flesh and my heart may fail.
[time=3085] But God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.
[time=3090] You know what?
[time=3091] It's good to remember this because as you and I transition, you, in the struggle that you might have, when all of a sudden your eyes and your heart and your thinking somehow kind of get off track and you're worried about and looking at and considering all that they've gotten, all that they're getting and all the fun that, and you're over here trying to do, when you wake up and you begin to transition away from that, as you're moving away from that, your heart and your flesh very well may fail.
[time=3125] It may still kind of throw itself up one more time and say, hey, get back.
[time=3132] You're nuts.
[time=3134] Look again.
[time=3136] Look what they've got.
[time=3137] Look where they're going.
[time=3138] Look what they go back.
[time=3144] And what will determine your decision at that point?
[time=3147] Is that what you trust?
[time=3151] That which you really down deep inside believe in.
[time=3155] And look what the psalmist says.
[time=3157] Psalmist says in verse 26, my flesh and my heart may fail.
[time=3160] Hey, go back.
[time=3161] But God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.
[time=3167] Interesting word portion.
[time=3172] You can write this down.
[time=3173] That word literally means that which is ultimately needed.
[time=3176] It's that which, think about it.
[time=3178] You know, if we just took this away from you and if we took that away from you, if we removed him and took away, if it all kind of got stripped away,
[time=3188] I mean, how would you fill in the blank as long as I have blank?
[time=3196] I'd be okay.
[time=3199] I mean, when you get up each morning, you know, what are you thinking really?
[time=3203] I mean, as long as I've got, when you're on your way to work, when you're home all day with kids or doing your thing at school, you know, as long as I've got this.
[time=3212] See, that's your portion.
[time=3217] What is that for you?
[time=3220] A giving heart desires only him people.
[time=3223] A giving heart trusts only him.
[time=3226] He is your portion.
[time=3230] You can't trust you completely.
[time=3233] I trust you.
[time=3234] Thank you.
[time=3235] But I can't trust you completely because you're fallible.
[time=3238] You get tired.
[time=3239] You get weak and your flesh does draw you back over there periodically.
[time=3243] I can't trust any -- we can't trust each other at that level.
[time=3247] We're all -- but you can always trust him.
[time=3250] He is never failing.
[time=3253] Yeah.
[time=3254] Yeah, that's true.
[time=3257] A giving heart desires only him, trusts only him.
[time=3260] Write this down.
[time=3261] A giving heart pursues only him.
[time=3264] Pursues only him.
[time=3266] That's powerful.
[time=3267] Look what it says there.
[time=3268] Look at verse 28.
[time=3269] He's gone through all of this and now he concludes by saying, "But as for me, the nearness of God." Nearness of what?
[time=3278] Nearness of God is my good.
[time=3282] This guy is absolutely wandering all over the place back over here.
[time=3287] He's thinking about this should be -- maybe that's his good.
[time=3290] Maybe this could be my good.
[time=3292] Oh, look what they've got.
[time=3294] That could be my good.
[time=3297] But he ends by saying, "But as for me, the nearness of God is my good.
[time=3302] I have made the Lord God my refuge, that I may tell of all your works."
[time=3311] Just think this through or write this down, please.
[time=3313] It's just a pretty basic thought.
[time=3315] But you're most -- and I am too.
[time=3317] We are most near.
[time=3320] What did he say, the nearness of God?
[time=3322] We are most near to that which you and I pursue most.
[time=3329] I mean, it's just really that simple.
[time=3332] Pursuit.
[time=3333] That which you are really, truly intentional about.
[time=3337] Going toward and being with.
[time=3342] You are most near to that which you pursue most.
[time=3347] Another fill in the blank for you.
[time=3350] I mean, if we actually -- if you actually follow -- if you actually had one of those helmet cams or whatever.
[time=3356] I mean, if you actually could just follow me around all week long, morning, noon, and night.
[time=3366] Maybe I could you, you know, we could make it even.
[time=3369] I mean, God does all the time, so maybe we should just realize that.
[time=3373] If we could just go with each other through the every day of life
[time=3379] and ask the question, just kind of make the statement like the psalmist did.
[time=3384] But as for me, as for Kelly, as for you, Keith, Linda Sally, Joe, whoever you are.
[time=3391] But as for me, the nearness of what is my good?
[time=3401] The nearness of what?
[time=3404] In the every day of life.
[time=3406] I mean, come on, be really, really honest with yourself.
[time=3409] The nearness of what brings to you and me that sense of things are good.
[time=3417] Now that's good.
[time=3422] What is it?
[time=3426] Yeah, I won't even list them all.
[time=3429] You know all the things that you and I could slide into that slot.
[time=3437] The psalmist reminds us that in the end, it's the nearness of God.
[time=3443] You are intentional, relentless, heartfelt pursuit of Him.
[time=3448] And when you desire, get emotionally excited about the pleasure you're going to receive from Him.
[time=3456] When you desire only Him, when you trust only Him, when He is your portion, when you can take this, this, and that away from your life and mind, and we're going to be okay as long as we've got the chance to walk with Him.
[time=3469] And when you pursue Him only, when you draw near to Him,
[time=3476] we'll be, you and I will be, when we do that, we'll be ready.
[time=3479] You are willing to give Him the best of your time and your talent and your treasure.
[time=3489] Desire only Him, trust only Him, pursue only Him.
[time=3497] And when that takes place, then we move away from giving Him scraps and leftovers.
[time=3504] Steve, why don't you pray for us?
[time=3508] Or Father in Heaven.
[time=3512] We truly want to desire, trust, and pursue you.
[time=3517] And our own flesh and the world's system, Satan and his demons,
[time=3523] they all place obstacles there.
[time=3526] And we just ask you, please, to tear those down.
[time=3531] And we just lay ourselves open before you and beg you, please, to grant us the desire of our heart, and that is an ever-increasing understanding of who you are and how you want us to respond.
[time=3544] Please give us hearts that give.
[time=3549] In Christ's name I pray, amen.
[time=3552] [AMEN]
[time=3566] [SILENCE - 30 seconds]
