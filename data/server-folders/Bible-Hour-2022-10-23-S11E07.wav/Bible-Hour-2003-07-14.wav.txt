[time=303] - Okay, we're gonna sing those verses again.
[time=308] This time, when the women to sing men of faith rise up and sing and bless the ears of the men who hear it.
[time=316] Okay, guys, just push your eyes and listen.
[time=319] And last hour, like the men didn't sing very loud, so we gotta sing loud and bless the ears of the women when we sing, rise up women of the truth.
[time=328] Listen to the words and sing it all to the glory of our Savior, Jesus.
[time=332] [MUSIC - 15 seconds]
[time=351] - Hey, guys, sing out.
[time=353] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=386] - Hey, let's all sing rise up church.
[time=396] Here we go.
[time=398] [MUSIC - 32 seconds]
[time=435] - I was on the trip to New York and that experience just really inspired me to write this song, which I call Never Fade Away.
[time=449] It just seems like so many times after I come off of these trips, I make these resolutions, like I'm gonna start doing this more.
[time=461] I'm not gonna do that anymore, but it never seems to really stick for very long.
[time=467] And so this song is kind of a prayer that I never want my love for God to fade away.

[time=748] (gentle music) - Hi, my name's Kelly Bird, Senior Pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries, and I'm so thankful for the opportunity to be with you again.
[time=757] We're so very grateful that you take time each week to tune in, and we hope that today you find yourself encouraged yet again.
[time=766] What you're gonna see today is really what was an amazing Sunday.
[time=771] When over 100 of our students who had gone to New York City for a week long missions trip came back, and they were able to in this morning not only lead us in worship, but several of them come and share their stories of what God had done, what God had done in them in their own lives and what God was able to do through them in the lives of others.
[time=793] And so I know I was incredibly encouraged and challenged as I sat there and heard these students telling what God had done.
[time=801] I hope you'll find it encouraging as well.
[time=804] I also wanna invite you to at least just give some thought to this, coming up on August 10th, just a couple of weeks from now, Sunday, August 10th.
[time=814] You might wanna come, you might wanna think about joining us.
[time=818] Beginning on that Sunday, August 10th, for three weeks, we've decided to dedicate a three week series to the idea of God and suffering.
[time=828] We're entitling it God, sovereignty, and suffering.
[time=833] Because so many of you, you and the viewing audience, even the folks that are a part of the family here at Black Hawk, so many times we get questions from people who are wondering where is God in the midst of suffering?
[time=847] They wanna try to figure this out.
[time=849] How a good and loving God who has my best interest at heart, which is what we're told, can kind of stand by or does he stand by?
[time=858] I mean, the questions abound.
[time=859] Where is God when really difficult, really challenging, sometimes heartbreaking, life altering stuff takes place?
[time=869] And we're not gonna just treat this with kind of a cursory, brush stroke.
[time=873] We're gonna do our best to dig into the scriptures and help you and help us try to better understand God, his sovereignty, his rule, and his control, and his ability to hold in his hands, everything that happens, and suffering.
[time=892] God, sovereignty, and suffering.
[time=895] Three weeks beginning August 10th.
[time=897] We'd love to have you join us.
[time=898] 915 and 1045, thanks.
[time=901] - I get a pleasure of introducing you to some people who are on our trip, and come on up here, you guys.
[time=908] Little bit less nervous the second time around, I think.
[time=912] So that's good, but this is Cecilia Allwine and Whitney, Chrisman, and Jan Burwell, and they were with us in New York, and they would like to share just a little bit about what God did in their life on the trip.
[time=924] - Hello, I'm Cecilia.
[time=927] When I signed up to go on the trip and went and talked to everyone about this trip, I was really excited, but the full impact of what happened on the trip wouldn't even hit me until after I got there.
[time=944] And when I got there, we on Monday night, or on Monday night, we went to ground zero.
[time=950] And the thing that I remember most about that place was how incredibly vulnerable I felt.
[time=957] It was a humbling, humbling experience.
[time=960] And I guess I should just preface this all by just saying that growing up, like I knew exactly what to say.
[time=970] I was, in my mind, I was a Christian.
[time=973] I knew what to do.
[time=975] I knew that my emotions, I could work out my emotions to back anything up for people to say that there was heart behind that.
[time=983] And I learned to be a pretender through my whole life.
[time=988] And when I got to New York, I was in full swing.
[time=992] And we went to the nursing home the first day on Monday, and I came away from there just, I couldn't deal with it.
[time=1000] And I went to Julie and Barb, and I just looked at them in the face and I said, you know what, I can't do this.
[time=1007] Right now, my heart is, I hate God.
[time=1010] And I cannot go to these people and tell them that I love God because I don't trust them.
[time=1016] I don't trust God.
[time=1017] I can't look them in the face and tell them that God loves them because I don't even believe that.
[time=1024] And they looked at me and told me that guilt is an incredibly, incredibly heavy burden to carry.
[time=1033] And it had never ever hit me in all of my life that I still carried this burden of guilt around.
[time=1039] And it was amazing how the Holy Spirit was in our conversation just because everything that I was thinking and everything that I was struggling and wrestling with, Barb and Julie, they said the exact things that I needed to hear.
[time=1052] They reminded me of God's word and what he had to say.
[time=1056] And he really spoke to me through these two women who I look up to so incredibly.
[time=1062] And they led me in the sinner's prayer and I became a Christian that night, Monday night.
[time=1070] And in all my life, it had never occurred to me that I wasn't a Christian.
[time=1075] I had gone through life saying, oh, I'm a Christian, but I've never ever experienced the comfort of God.
[time=1081] I've never experienced his strength.
[time=1083] Every time I would go to pray, I would come away so angry because I felt like I'd never been heard.
[time=1089] And it was just incredible that it's a truly to me.
[time=1094] No one comes to the Father unless the Spirit leads him.
[time=1099] God led me to himself.
[time=1101] He drew me to himself.
[time=1103] And I just want to read a Psalm.
[time=1105] That it's Psalm 66 and I've known it for a long time and it's been a favor of mine.
[time=1111] But I've always wanted it to be my prayer and tried and tried and tried to convince myself that it is my prayer.
[time=1118] And I knew I was always lying to myself, but I wasn't willing to admit it.
[time=1124] But now I can say that this is my prayer.
[time=1127] It says, come and listen all you who fear God.
[time=1130] Let me tell you what he has done for me.
[time=1133] I cried out to him with my mouth.
[time=1135] His praise was on my tongue.
[time=1137] If I had cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened.
[time=1142] But God has surely listened and heard my voice in prayer.
[time=1145] Praise be to God who has not rejected my prayer or withheld his love from me.
[time=1150] (audience applauding)
[time=1156] - Hi, my name is Whitney.
[time=1162] And this year, God blessed me with the opportunity to go on this mission trip to New York with our youth group and while we were there, I worked at a nursing home.
[time=1174] And the second day we were there, Jan and I met a couple named Martha and Thomas.
[time=1182] And Thomas was very sick and it was very difficult for me to stay in that room with them because Martha was sitting there just crying because she said that it hurt her to just sit there and watch her husband die and be in so much pain.
[time=1202] And I walked out of that room in tears and I realized that it was sad but at the same time, it was really cool because you could just see that she had unconditional love for that man.
[time=1219] And I just realized that I need to love everyone that way.
[time=1224] It doesn't matter who they are or what they look like.
[time=1227] I just need to love them unconditionally like Christ loved us.
[time=1231] (audience applauding) - I get to- - Am I on?
[time=1241] Is it not?
[time=1243] Okay, I get to continue Whitney's- - I get to continue Whitney's story.
[time=1253] It was kind of me and how God put Martha and Thomas in my path throughout the week without me even trying.
[time=1262] And I have to cut this story away short.
[time=1266] There's a lot of really neat details that I have to leave out but on Wednesday I spent some time with Martha and it was time for me to leave and I remembered Rick's challenge to the mission kids to end a conversation in prayer.
[time=1282] So I asked Martha before I left if I could pray for her and she said would you please pray for Thomas?
[time=1289] And I asked her specifically how she would like me to pray for Thomas and she said please ask God to take him quickly so he doesn't suffer anymore.
[time=1300] And that was really hard for me but I just thought it was neat because that was something I wouldn't have done on my own without Rick's challenge.
[time=1307] And then the next day I also spent some time with Martha and I was in her room and she showed me her Bible and it was about this big and weighed at least 10 pounds and as I was looking through her Bible
[time=1327] I noticed a little note on her table and I asked Martha if she'd like me to read it to her and she said yes and so I opened it up and read it and it was the sweetest encouraging note from Whitney and at the end of the note Whitney had given Martha some scripture to read for comfort.
[time=1348] So I asked Martha if she would like me to read to her from the Bible and that's also something I don't think I would have done on my own without Whitney's little note.
[time=1361] And so I read to Martha from the Bible and as we are reading, Thomas called out for her and so I wheeled Martha over to his bedside and Thomas was very, very weak and he, but he mustered up enough energy to just reach his hand over the bed rail so that she could hold his hand.
[time=1387] And I read scripture to both of them and then he asked me for a drink of water so I gave him a drink of water and it just seemed like Thomas was more alert than he had been throughout the week and I just remember thinking while I was reading to them that Martha really needed a Bible that was smaller
[time=1413] so she could read it for herself after I left and then I remembered a Bible that had been given to me earlier in the week and had been given to me by another resident named Larry and I can't tell you that story 'cause it's too long but asked some of the kids about Larry and he gave me that Bible with the challenge to give it to someone else so I gave that Bible to Martha to give her comfort during that time and as I was sitting there with them, like I said, Thomas became more alert and I really was led to share the Gospel with Thomas.
[time=1452] I don't do that on my own very often and that was another God thing and I just really wanted to go away from there knowing that Thomas was gonna be in heaven when he died.
[time=1464] So I shared the Gospel with Thomas and I prayed for them before I left
[time=1475] and the next day was Friday was our last day at the nursing home and when we arrived, I just overheard someone saying that a resident had died on the second floor and I was just really sure it was Thomas but I needed to check for myself and so I went upstairs and looked in the room and there was an empty bed and Martha sitting next to it, folding his clothes and it was just a very sweet time and I got to talk to her son for a little while and he said that Thomas had died around 5.30 which was only a short time after I left the day before and it was just so neat that I was able to give him maybe his last drink of water and the last words that he heard were Jesus's words and just to sum it all up, I felt like it took Whitney's note
[time=1537] and Larry's Bible and Rick's challenge to end a conversation and prayer for me to minister to Martha in her time of need and I have to give Jesus all the credit 'cause I couldn't have done it on my own.
[time=1553] (audience applauding)
[time=1566] One thing you won't know because Jan will never tell you this but she was actually asked to come back and pray with the family, she had that kind of an impact on them in such a short time that they asked her and requested her to come back and so that's a cool thing.
[time=1581] We're gonna bring up some flute players now and who'd have thought when we were going to New York?
[time=1587] I mean, we're thinking we're gonna go minister to kids and we were minister to someone who was dying and in a family and it was pretty amazing.
[time=1597] That's just one story of many and so ask somebody with a t-shirt on today, they all match like this.
[time=1602] So this is Allison, Lions, Ashley Crisman, Aubrey Dowd and Lisa Denny and they had a special task when we were in New York.
[time=1612] We visited ground zero.
[time=1614] We had given every student a name a month prior to leaving and we said to pray for this person's family and that's all we said.
[time=1623] And then we took them on a trip on Monday night and we arrived at ground zero and they still didn't know.
[time=1629] They knew to have the name with them.
[time=1631] They're thinking they're gonna get to meet this person and we arrived and when we got there, we kind of gathered by the fence and I said, now I want you to go look on that wall over there and I want you to find that name.
[time=1640] And it kind of instantly dawned on them that each name had been a person that died at ground zero and they found the name and then we gave them like an obituary, more to the story of each individual about their families, about maybe how they died.
[time=1655] And it was pretty powerful.
[time=1656] God used it in a lot of our hearts to just wake us up to some things about life and the reality of death and living.
[time=1665] And we brought four flutes with us and afterwards we walked around ground zero one time and then we had the flutes play.
[time=1671] And it was a time of worship right there at the memorial and people on the street kind of just gravitated over and we ended up singing a little bit and people were on their knees and it was an amazing time.
[time=1685] And so we wanted them to be able to bless you and to show you some pictures of our trip to ground zero.
[time=1692] So.
[time=1693] One, two, three, one, go.
[time=1702] (upbeat music)
[time=1763] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[time=1778] (upbeat music)
[time=1837] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[time=1849] (upbeat music)
[time=1858] (applause)
[time=1864] I sit there and I hear that story like you did.
[time=1870] And a lot of things come to my mind.
[time=1873] I think one of the things that just initially pops up is this picture of Thomas, this old and dying man trying to gather up enough strength to lift his hand up over the bed so he can hold his wife's hand.
[time=1889] How sweet is that?
[time=1894] This picture of love and age and devotion and when it's all said and done, you know, all I really want is just to be able to lay here and hold your hand.
[time=1912] And in this week that we've just gone through here, again, I have seen the unbelievable side of both ends.
[time=1920] I did a wedding right here yesterday and saw two absolutely full of excitement, love and joy and hope for the future.
[time=1932] Flowers were beautiful and the occasion was bright and off they went.
[time=1939] And in the last seven days on the other end of it all, I've seen yet another family disintegrate right in front of our eyes.
[time=1948] I've watched and seen now again the heartache that comes with that and all the pain and all the confusion.
[time=1956] And I stand back and I ask myself, as you ask yourself again, what in the world happens?
[time=1965] How do we go from this?
[time=1970] The vows and the commitments and the excitement and the hope of a future to utter bitterness and disdain?
[time=1979] Hatred, dissension and just everything completely falling apart.
[time=1987] Well, you know what it is?
[time=1989] What happens is that we forget.
[time=1996] We forget.
[time=1998] We forget about what's right and true.
[time=2001] We forget, we move away from what is good and pure, we forget.
[time=2009] We knew at one point in some place we realized most of us what was right.
[time=2016] God honoring and real and time goes by and choices get made and we begin to be a forgetful people.
[time=2027] And we lose touch with what is really good and right and true and we make all kinds of decisions and go down all kinds of roads.
[time=2039] Sometimes don't end up in a room with the one we love just wanting to hold a hand one more time.
[time=2047] You ever done that?
[time=2049] You ever forgotten?
[time=2053] Have you ever made a really bad decision?
[time=2057] You ever really messed up?
[time=2061] Can you remember what it was like?
[time=2066] Kids in the room, maybe you can remember a time when you really, really messed up.
[time=2073] You told a lie or you stole something or you just did something that, yeah, you just knew was not good.
[time=2081] Moms and dads, older folks in the room, maybe you can remember a time where you did something, you said something, you made a decision and it was the wrong one to make.
[time=2091] God was dishonored and others were dishonored.
[time=2096] You remember that?
[time=2099] Can you feel that feeling again today as you sit here and just think back on a real bad choice?
[time=2106] Then can you remember like I can because yes, I can remember that too.
[time=2111] And can you then remember like I can the feeling and that sense that comes over you
[time=2117] when you, as you confess that to God, as you confess that to your dad or your mom or your sister or brother or whoever it was
[time=2129] and they looked at you and they said, it's all right, I forgive you.
[time=2137] Come here, give me a hug or, you know, your dad or your mom, you know,
[time=2144] they come over and they grab you and it's okay.
[time=2147] You remember what it was like to kind of have those arms around you?
[time=2150] Do you remember what it was like to see in their faces, whoever that was, that sense of grace and mercy that was being extended?
[time=2158] Do you remember what it was like to kind of look to the heavens and say, I don't deserve it, I know, but thank you so very much that my sin is as far as the east is from the west.
[time=2168] Do you remember that?
[time=2172] Do you remember, do you remember then, a month or two, maybe a week or two,
[time=2184] maybe a year or two later?
[time=2188] This is kind of a hard one to say, but I guess it's just reality, so we got to at least talk about it.
[time=2194] Do you remember down the road, being back in that same position again and starting to make the exact same choice all over again, doing the same thing, making the same move?
[time=2213] I do, I won't speak for you.
[time=2219] Sometimes these are significant, you know, biggies as we say, and sometimes it's just kind of the everyday stuff, but you know what, it's all the same.
[time=2227] We forget, we forget, and we put ourselves in situations.
[time=2235] And we should never, you know, in reality when we look at it, you and I, the light of what it was like to stand here and to bask in his goodness and grace.
[time=2244] And you know that next day and the next couple of days, boy, it's just all.
[time=2248] And then all of a sudden we get down here again.
[time=2252] Forgetful.
[time=2256] Let's just pray real quick.
[time=2258] God, as we come to your word this morning, God, as we come to some weeks
[time=2264] here, where we're going to kind of look at and study and come familiar again with the people who were a forgetful people.
[time=2275] God, I pray that you would do a work in my own heart and life.
[time=2278] God, I pray that you would do a work in the lives of those who sit here in this room this morning.
[time=2283] God, that we would remember what is true and right and real.
[time=2288] And God, that we would, through your spirit, through your truth, learn to hang on to
[time=2294] that.
[time=2296] That we would be a people who, having forgotten, would remember.
[time=2301] And having remembered would return to you.
[time=2307] To obedience.
[time=2310] Full surrender and devotion.
[time=2314] God, do a mighty work in us, in your son's name we pray.
[time=2318] [AMEN] Hey, would you turn your Bibles to the Old Testament book of Isaiah?
[time=2324] Do that for me, would you?
[time=2326] Turn to Isaiah.
[time=2327] We're going to spend some time in the coming weeks looking closely at several books in the Old Testament books that traditionally have been classified in a category known as the minor prophets.
[time=2339] The minor prophets.
[time=2341] Isaiah is not part of this category of minor prophets but I had you turn there because it is with this book of Isaiah that this last and very significant
[time=2353] section of the Old Testament known as the prophetic books begins.
[time=2359] It begins, the prophetic books begin with the book of Isaiah.
[time=2363] The poetic books of Job and Psalms and Proverbs and Ecclesiastes and the songs of Solomon have just concluded and now God in his unfolding story.
[time=2374] In this unfolding story of redemption and grace he leads us to these 17 books
[time=2381] known as the prophets.
[time=2384] Here's a quick glance at the big picture, the big prophetic picture if you will.
[time=2391] Prophets and prophecy.
[time=2395] There are four major prophets.
[time=2397] Some of you know this, some of you don't.
[time=2399] It's okay.
[time=2400] It can be a reminder for those of you who have studied this in the past.
[time=2403] For others of you it can be a new day of insight for you.
[time=2406] Four major prophets.
[time=2408] Those are, same with me.
[time=2411] Just kidding you.
[time=2412] You got a little nervous there, didn't you?
[time=2414] The four major prophets.
[time=2416] Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Daniel.
[time=2420] Four major prophets.
[time=2421] Isaiah, Jeremiah.
[time=2423] Lamentations is oftentimes thrown into this group because it's believed that Jeremiah, the weeping prophet as he is known as, wrote the great lament as well.
[time=2435] But Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Daniel.
[time=2438] The four major prophets.
[time=2440] Then there's 12 minor prophets.
[time=2443] 12 minor prophets.
[time=2444] Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zephaniah,
[time=2452] Zechariah and Malachi.
[time=2456] 12 minor prophets.
[time=2458] Now oftentimes people will ask what's the difference between the major and the minor.
[time=2463] Do we have more spiritual content in the majors?
[time=2466] Are they more important?
[time=2469] Not at all.
[time=2471] The basic difference between the major prophets and the minor prophets really boils down to the length, the length of their prophecy.
[time=2478] If you've ever read in Isaiah, Ezekiel.
[time=2481] Jeremiah or Daniel, you'll know those are lengthy.
[time=2484] That's a lengthy read.
[time=2485] There's a lot there.
[time=2487] These minor prophets, though they spoke with great power, and though their message was incredibly significant, those are just shorter writings.
[time=2496] The difference there between major and minor.
[time=2498] What is a prophet?
[time=2501] As we look at this in the Old Testament, what was a prophet?
[time=2505] A prophet was one specifically called by God.
[time=2508] You might want to write this down.
[time=2510] A prophet was one specifically called by God to proclaim God's specific message.
[time=2517] You can add that in there.
[time=2518] God's specific message.
[time=2520] In the case of Old Testament prophecy, this was a specific message of rebuke.
[time=2528] It was a specific message of warning.
[time=2531] It was a specific message of coming judgment.
[time=2534] In the case of the Old Testament, a specific message from God to an unbelieving and rebellious
[time=2544] Israel.
[time=2545] These Israelites, this chosen race of God, they were quite a crew.
[time=2551] And they had for years and years and years and years been a forgetful people.
[time=2558] Forgetting about the amazing provision that he had offered them.
[time=2563] That he had given me at times, the grace that he had extended.
[time=2566] And so God through these prophets, the major and the minor prophets, God speaks a specific message to them.
[time=2572] Now, most of us, most of us, when we hear the phrase prophecy or we hear about the office
[time=2579] of a prophet, we immediately think about, and our minds go to future events.
[time=2584] We oftentimes kind of categorize these guys as those who predicted what was to come, who
[time=2591] predicted future events.
[time=2592] Now, they did.
[time=2594] Just real quickly, stay with me here.
[time=2596] They would predict future events as it related to the Messiah.
[time=2600] There was messianic prophecy.
[time=2603] They would predict and talk about future events as it related to the New Covenant.
[time=2608] You had the Old Testament, you had the New Testament coming, the church age, the New Covenant
[time=2614] that God would make through Christ his son.
[time=2616] Much of the prophecies, excuse me, some of the prophecies had to do with the church, the future church age.
[time=2623] There was a little bit of future stuff going on also as it related to end times.
[time=2628] There was messianic prophecy.
[time=2630] That was future.
[time=2631] There was church age prophecy.
[time=2633] There was end times prophecy.
[time=2636] But watch this.
[time=2637] If you take those three together, all the prophecies that kind of came under the umbrella of those
[time=2644] three, it was less than eight percent of all the prophecies and all the prophets, both major
[time=2652] and minor, leaves about 92, 92 percent.
[time=2657] The other 92 percent was them speaking God's truth, them proclaiming God's word to their
[time=2665] own contemporaries in their own day.
[time=2668] Because God's truth being proclaimed, His warning or judgment to those in the family of Israel
[time=2675] at that time.
[time=2676] Look at it this way, four main themes.
[time=2678] You can just write these down if you'd like to.
[time=2680] Four main themes that you see again and again and again whenever we interact with the prophets.
[time=2685] They exposed the sin of the people.
[time=2688] They called the people having exposed their sin.
[time=2691] The prophets would oftentimes call the people back to obedience.
[time=2694] They warned the people of the coming judgment and again as I mentioned they did look forward.
[time=2699] They made divinely ordained predictions.
[time=2702] They looked forward to the coming of Messiah, the coming of Messiah.
[time=2706] The first time in Bethlehem and then they would also speak to the issue of look forward to
[time=2713] and make prophecies relating to His coming the second time, which is the coming of the
[time=2719] Lord that we continue to wait for today.
[time=2721] But really the bulk of what they did is there in those first three.
[time=2724] You see it there?
[time=2725] Exposing the sin of the people, calling the people back to obedience, warning the people of the coming judgment.
[time=2732] Now it's very important to point out here something about these messages of warning,
[time=2738] rebuke and coming judgment.
[time=2742] And just in a nutshell, kind of just think back with me.
[time=2745] Again for some of you I know this is review but for others of you maybe it's helping you gain some perspective.
[time=2751] All God ever wanted.
[time=2755] All God ever wanted from these people, the nation of Israel.
[time=2759] You see all God ever wanted was a people to call His own.
[time=2764] All God ever wanted was a people who would live life with Him.
[time=2769] All He ever wanted was a people who would love and honor and respect and obey and live their
[time=2775] lives with Him.
[time=2780] See all He ever wanted to do was reach the nations through His people and their love for Him and their devotion to Him and their faithfulness to Him would be a light in a really dark world.
[time=2793] See all He ever wanted was a people to call His own.
[time=2796] A people who would look to Him and say, "You are our God and we love you and we follow
[time=2802] you and we honor and respect you." What He got was the Israelites.
[time=2810] A stubborn bunch who it seemed like every couple, two or three decades would just do a complete
[time=2818] like brain dead unplug God who kind of thing and they just went off and they would do their
[time=2825] things.
[time=2826] They were forgetful from the beginning.
[time=2829] I mean you can trace it from Abraham, Isaac and Jacob to the captivity in Egypt to the Exodus to the 40 years and the wilderness to them demanding God wanted to be their ruler.
[time=2840] They wanted after it was all said and done.
[time=2842] They wanted kings and so God gave them kings and they divide the nation into two and there's a northern kingdom and a southern kingdom and the kings are wicked guys that move them
[time=2852] toward Baal worship and there's murder and there's dissension and there's factions and from the beginning to the end there's just this story of murmuring and complaining and
[time=2863] unfaithfulness being matched again and again and again by God's goodness and God's grace
[time=2869] and God's faithfulness.
[time=2873] And finally it's like they just push the envelope of His patience a little too far.
[time=2883] He longs for repentance.
[time=2886] He longs for them to repent.
[time=2889] He was talking to Bill Archer this week and he reminded me of what it says in Amos, not a long read.
[time=2895] You should look at that sometime in the book of Amos we see God's deep desire that they would just come back to Him.
[time=2903] All He wanted them.
[time=2904] All He wanted from them was a people who would love and honor and follow Him.
[time=2909] People who when they didn't would just repent and come do the right thing and they don't.
[time=2914] And finally we come to this point where He decides to take action and He allows them to
[time=2920] be given over.
[time=2921] He allows them to be overrun, captured and taken away.
[time=2928] Overrun, captured and taken away.
[time=2931] I want you to look at Amos with me just for a second.
[time=2934] I'm standing here thinking about it, go to Amos 6, excuse me, 4.
[time=2940] Go to Amos chapter 4 verse, we'll pick it up in verse 6.
[time=2945] Listen to the heart of God.
[time=2946] Hear what He's saying here and again we realize in this context of Amos He speaks to and has
[time=2952] to do with Amos here is prophesying on behalf of God to the people of Israel.
[time=2955] But boy just you know it's not hard as we read through these things to put yourself and myself in these shoes.
[time=2963] He says the name is 4 verse 6.
[time=2966] But I gave you, listen to God, but I gave you also, it says here in my translation cleanness of teeth in all your cities it has to do with a lack of water.
[time=2975] And a lack of bread in all your places yet you have not returned to me, declares the Lord.
[time=2982] Furthermore I withheld the rain from you while there were still three months until harvest.
[time=2988] Then I would send rain on one city and on another city I would not send rain.
[time=2992] One part would be rained on while the part not rained on would dry up so two or three
[time=2998] cities would stagger to another city to drink water but would not be satisfied yet you have not returned to me, declares the Lord.
[time=3006] I smote you with scorching wind and mildew and the caterpillar was devouring your many gardens and vineyards, fig trees and olive trees yet you have not returned to me, declares
[time=3017] the Lord.
[time=3018] I sent a plague among you after the manner of Egypt, I slew your young men by the sword
[time=3024] along with your captured horses and I made the stench of your camp rise up in your nostrils yet you have not returned to me, declares the Lord.
[time=3038] We get pretty stubborn sometimes only in our sin and rebellion.
[time=3044] We get so very convinced that we're on to something, that what we're chasing after is
[time=3051] somehow someway in the end really going to pay off.
[time=3057] I overthrew you, verse 11, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and you were like a fire
[time=3064] brand snatched from ablaze yet you have not returned to me, declares the Lord.
[time=3070] Therefore, thus, I will do to you, O Israel, because I will do this to you, prepare to
[time=3078] meet your God, O Israel, for behold he who forms mountains and creates the wind and declares
[time=3085] to man what are his thoughts, who makes dawn into darkness and treads on the high places
[time=3092] of the earth.
[time=3093] See, this is who we're dealing with, people, the Lord God of hosts is his name.
[time=3102] And so the patience envelope gets pushed and the rebellion just continues and repentance
[time=3108] doesn't take place and so he allows them to be given over.
[time=3111] He allows his precious people who would possess this precious land to be absolutely overrun.
[time=3120] The northern tribes, the northern kingdom and about 722 BC, I believe, are absolutely wiped
[time=3128] out and taken back to Assyria.
[time=3131] The Assyrian army comes and they take them all, they take the women, they take the kids, they take the dads, the young, I mean everybody just gets taken into captivity to live a slaves,
[time=3145] to be beaten and tortured, mistreated in a foreign land.
[time=3150] Years later the southern kingdom falls to Nebuchadnezzar and they're deported, taken captive, the two tribes, the ten tribes known as the kingdom of Israel in the north are gone in 722, the two tribes to the south known as the kingdom of Judah, taken in 586, gone.
[time=3169] And back in Deuteronomy, turn back there if you would, back in Deuteronomy, Moses knew it was going to happen, little prophecy of his own.
[time=3179] Go to Deuteronomy 4, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Deuteronomy 4.
[time=3192] Look what it says there, look at verse 25, "When you become the father of children and children's children and have remained long in the land and act corruptly and make an
[time=3203] idol in the form of anything and do that which is evil on the side of the Lord your God so as to provoke him to anger I call heaven and earth to witness against you today
[time=3214] that you will surely perish quickly from the land where you are going over the Jordan to
[time=3220] possess it.
[time=3221] You shall not live long on it but will be utterly destroyed.
[time=3225] The Lord will scatter you among the peoples and you will be left few in number among the nations where the Lord drives you.
[time=3232] There you will serve God's, the work of man's hands, wood and stone which neither see nor
[time=3238] hear nor eat nor smell but from there you will seek the Lord your God and you will find
[time=3244] him if you search for him with all your heart and all your soul and that is still true today.
[time=3254] When you are in distress and all these things have come upon you and the latter days you will return to the Lord your God and listen to his voice.
[time=3261] For the Lord your God is a compassionate God.
[time=3266] He will not fail you nor destroy you nor forget the covenant with your fathers which he swore
[time=3272] to them.
[time=3275] So it was going to happen.
[time=3277] We knew it back here in Deuteronomy and it happens.
[time=3281] Now as for the prophets just listen we'll wrap it up here.
[time=3285] As for the prophets some of these prophets write before the captivities.
[time=3292] Some of these prophets are kind of pre-captivity authors and the message that they declare is one of warning.
[time=3298] They are saying in essence repent it's coming.
[time=3302] Couple of them Ezekiel and Daniel actually write during the captivities.
[time=3307] In the end they all came back to the land in about 538 but during the captivities there
[time=3313] are a few that write Daniel, Ezekiel being those two and then there are some who write
[time=3319] post-captivity.
[time=3322] After they've come back to the land there are some who give a word from the Lord.
[time=3326] Zechariah, Hagii and Malachi.
[time=3330] The last book in your Old Testament and mine.
[time=3334] The book of Malachi and here's what I want you to do this week okay.
[time=3338] I want you to just make a promise, I want you to see what's going on here.
[time=3344] This is an amazing thing and we'll be done.
[time=3347] Remember the whole thing about you and I doing this and then God comes and brings this great grace and then sometimes we find ourselves down here almost ready to do the exact.
[time=3357] The people of Israel had gone through all that they had been through.
[time=3361] God had removed them from the land.
[time=3363] Now he brings them back to the land, the book of Malachi is written over a hundred years
[time=3369] after their return.
[time=3371] They've gone through unspeakable, I mean if we could spend weeks just teaching on what took place in the captivities.
[time=3378] I mean it was horrendous stuff.
[time=3381] Now they've been saved and rescued from that brought back to the land.
[time=3385] Malachi now writes over a hundred years later and guess what they're doing?
[time=3392] Are they walking the straight and narrow?
[time=3394] Yes or no?
[time=3395] No.
[time=3396] They're doing it worse.
[time=3400] They're doing it all over again.
[time=3404] What are they thinking?
[time=3406] You're thinking, I think, what do they think, well what are you thinking?
[time=3412] What am I thinking?
[time=3414] Read it this week.
[time=3415] It's an easy read.
[time=3416] I want you to read through the book of Malachi and I want you to see a hundred years later.
[time=3422] You now know the story and look and read and kind of take in what they're doing and what God's response is to what they're doing.
[time=3429] What you'll see is this, what you'll see is that He takes very seriously your rebellion in mind but in me.
[time=3436] In the end, in the end of Malachi you'll see He holds out the promise again because Deuteronomy
[time=3443] 4 says He is a compassionate God and where would they be and where would you and I be
[time=3451] today if He wasn't.
[time=3455] Read it, would you?
[time=3456] Please.
[time=3457] Just sit down.
[time=3458] It's an easy read.
[time=3459] Just read through Malachi as the week goes on and join us back again next week as we continue on with the minor prophets.
[time=3463] Would you stand?
[time=3464] Thanks for bearing with me.
[time=3465] Let's pray.
[time=3466] Father, we counted a privilege to be with you in this place today.
[time=3471] We're so grateful for these students, God, so very thankful for their willingness to come and lead us into your presence, God, to lead us in song, to share their stories
[time=3482] of the work you have done in their hearts, God, the lives that you touched through them, all of it reminds us of how grateful we are for them, for Rick and for that staff of people
[time=3495] who give themselves tirelessly day in and day out to invest in and to make a significant
[time=3502] deposit in the life of so many students here in this place and around this city.
[time=3508] God, we thank you for that work.
[time=3510] We pray you would continue to give Rick and Jill and Julie and that volunteer staff the
[time=3516] energy and the perspective and the heart to continue to give themselves in the way that
[time=3522] they do.
[time=3523] Thank you for this family.
[time=3524] We're here today.
[time=3525] Bring us back together again, if it be your will next week, and in the in-between, God
[time=3531] remind us as we look through Malachi of what it means, what it looks like when we get forgetful and draw us in that way that only you can.
[time=3540] God, draw us back to what is real and true and right in your son's name.
[time=3545] We pray.
[time=3546] [AMEN]
[time=3554] Thank you.
