[time=60] [MUSIC - 24 seconds]
[time=88] To my soul, your word is a lamp unto my feet. Jesus, I love you. I love you. Jesus, strong, we close.
[time=113] Close, alone, to you. Let the world around me fade away.
[time=132] To Jesus, strong, we close. Close, alone, to you.
[time=144] For I desire to worship and obey.
[time=182] Draw me close, draw me close to you.
[time=200] Never let me go, I lay it all down again.
[time=216] To me, you say that I'm your friend. You are my desire, and no one else will do.
[time=235] There's nothing else can take your place. To feel the warmth of your embrace,
[time=246] and stand together and sing. Help me find the way. Don't bring me back to you.
[time=258] You're all I want. You're all I want. You're all I've ever needed.
[time=274] You're all I want. Help me know you are me. Ladies, would you sing this?
[time=292] Draw me close to you. Never let me go, I lay it all down again.
[time=311] To hear you say that I'm your friend. You are my desire, and no one else will do.
[time=330] There's nothing else can take your place. To feel the warmth of your embrace,
[time=341] and stand together. Help me find the way. Don't bring me back to you.
[time=352] You're all I want. You're all I've ever needed. You're all I've ever needed.
[time=375] Help me know you are me. You're all I want. You're all I've ever needed.
[time=395] You're all I want. Help me know you are me. Help me know you are me.
[time=422] Father, that's our prayer this morning. Father, we draw near to you so that you
[time=429] draw near to us. We want to be in your presence this morning, but God, so many
[time=438] times we just look at ourselves and know that we don't deserve that privilege.
[time=445] Father, you are God who was holy and blameless, and you are consuming fire that indwells any sin and burns it up that comes before you and Lord. We know
[time=458] that the only reason we stand here today in your midst is because of your son Jesus, the holy and anointed one, the perfect sacrifice. Lord, we pray that you would
[time=470] continue to draw near as we worship through singing, as we worship through giving of ties and offerings and those things that you command us to give with joy and as we struggle through that and learn what that means and as we open
[time=485] the word and learn from the book of Habakkuk and all the stuff that you have for us today Lord be near to us. Your word says that your nearness is to us our good and that's our prayer today. Amen.
[time=517] The end of the book of Habakkuk says though the fig tree does not bud and there are no grapes on the vine, though the olive crop fails and the fields produce no fruit,
[time=528] though there are no sheep in the pen and no cattle in the stalls, yet I will rejoice in the Lord. I will be joyful in my God Savior. Let's sing this song that
[time=541] talks about regardless of what we face in life, whether good or bad, we choose to praise the name of the Lord. Let's sing together.
[time=575] All through the wilderness, blessed be your name, every blessing, every blessing
[time=585] you pour out out, turn back to praise. When the darkness closes in Lord, still I will
[time=598] sing. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Blessed be your name. Blessed be the name of the
[time=610] Lord. Blessed be your glory as name.
[time=617] Blessed be your name with the sunshine now on me.
[time=627] The world's all as it should be. Blessed be your name. Blessed be your name on the
[time=640] roll heart with suffering. So let's paint in the coffee. Blessed be your name, every
[time=651] blessing, every blessing you pour out out, turn back to praise. When the darkness
[time=663] closes in Lord, still I will sing. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Blessed be your
[time=673] name. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Blessed be your glory as name. Blessed be the
[time=686] name of the Lord. Blessed be your name. Oh blessed be the name of the Lord. Blessed
[time=698] be your glory as name. Stand together and sing. Give and take away. You give and take away.
[time=713] My heart will choose to sing. Lord, blessed be your name. Give and take away. You give
[time=726] and take away. But my heart will choose to sing. Lord, blessed be your name. Oh blessed
[time=737] be your name. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Blessed be your glory as name. Oh blessed
[time=754] be the name of the Lord. Blessed be your name. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Blessed
[time=767] be the glory as name.
[time=797] Let's sing everything that has breath. Praise the Lord. Everything that has breath. Everything
[time=820] that has breath. Everything that has breath. Praise the Lord. Sing them one more time.
[time=834] Everything that has breath. Praise the Lord. Everything that has breath. Praise the Lord.
[time=848] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord
[time=979] Today, we're going to talk about that. We're going to talk about Habakkuk. If you want
[time=988] to turn there, it's about four books, I think, back from Matthew. We're going to just kind
[time=994] of go through the text. We're not going to read it all, but I want you to be ready if you can turn there right now. Habakkuk, Habakkuk, or Habakuk, I've seen all pronunciations.
[time=1005] But you know, I'm really excited about Tommy Walker. Are you? You know, this worship set
[time=1013] was sandwiched by Tommy Walker's songs. And so I just encourage you to get those tickets and get them now because they're going to go. We only have one concert, worship concert last year we had two. And so the three-story life, whoever their story is in your life, that you're trying to connect his story to, please get tickets for them. And I suggest you get them today because next week, all the other churches who are participating with us will be releasing them to their churches, their respective churches. Also kind of excited
[time=1043] because last night was my 20-year high school reunion. DeKalb high school class of 1983.
[time=1052] And we had one of the best basketball teams the school ever had. We got beat on a horrible call. But he's not here. We got beat on a horrible call in the semi-state finals when
[time=1065] basketball was one class as God intended it. And every March I relive that and I think
[time=1073] that I have a dream usually in March that we won. That the IHSAA says, "We're sorry, we did make an error." You know, and that's the way it is. But it was funny. It's funny the things you forget. You know, the things you forget. Back in high school I was playing basketball. I was student council president and Susan was a prom queen. Therefore I was
[time=1093] a prom king. And yeah, she's my high school sweetheart. And just to remember that when
[time=1101] we would walk down the hall and the girls would line up against the lockers and sing how great that heart. You know? Hey, Susan sang the loudest so I married her. But you
[time=1114] know the other things we forget. You know, one of the sweetest girls in the whole room last night. She's basically her entire adult life. She's battled with cancer. My best friend
[time=1125] has had two significant bouts with cancer and now he's in remission. And you look at
[time=1131] all this. But what I would call injustice, you know? And good buddy mind played baseball.
[time=1137] He's got the, I still think the high school record for the most home runs in a row and as many at bats. It's a really good buddy. And he went to Clemson to play baseball. He's
[time=1148] a great baseball player. He's going to play catcher and he was going to be behind someone in his same class. So that wasn't going to work out so well. Had a broken relationship with a girlfriend and comes back and I'll never get my conversation with him at the Waterloo gas station. He was just trying to get his life back together, going to pick a different school and start a new direction. It wasn't, it was a couple months after that I think it was in January when I was a sophomore in college that on Tonkel Road there were the iron bridges, the car that he was a passenger in, lost control. And he hit his head just right, not a scratch on his body, his head just right on the window and he died. And Susan's nephew who was in her class, he died in a car accident. I remember when I was told the guy was being really kind who was telling me it was at the Labor Day auction and he wasn't telling me exactly what happened and in his kindness I misunderstood. I thought he meant that Susan was in that crash. So I remember that really vividly and you know two girls in our class committed suicide. One girl was murdered by her husband along with all her children. The guy that grew up about a mile from me died in a car accident and I'm sure your class is this way too. And I look at that you know and I just ask why? Why?
[time=1219] And you know September 11th I see that September 11th 01 and I ask God why? Why would you let
[time=1226] that happen? I see Christians sold to slavery in Sudan and ask God why? I see abortions
[time=1233] and child abuse when many who can't have children want to adopt and you know I ask God why?
[time=1239] And in this thing in liberating Iraq when the good guys, when our soldiers are getting
[time=1245] killed ask God why? Do you ever ask God why? When there's injustice you ask him why? That's
[time=1253] what Habakkuk does. He says why? Judas kings were disobedient despite a short
[time=1259] live revival led by King Josiah. Habakkuk's complaint is two-fold. First he asks why the
[time=1266] unrighteous leaders in Judah are allowed by God to hem in the righteous like Habakkuk.
[time=1271] Why would you let an unrighteous guy even be a leader here, God? After receiving God's answer that he's judging his own people by allowing a group of bad boys from Babylon to perch the unrighteous among Judah, Habakkuk quickly follows with the second complaint.
[time=1284] He says what in the world? You're not grating on the curve. You're going to let wicked
[time=1290] Babylon mess with sort of unrighteous Judah. Why would you do that? And God answers that
[time=1300] the just shall live by faith, a remnant comprise of those who are committed to God will endure as he brings justice to both Judah and Babylon. And Habakkuk, whose name means embrace, finds
[time=1312] contentment in the embrace of God's hands while he embraces others celebrating in the hope that they have in a trusting relationship with the God of the universe. Just like Habakkuk, you and I often cry for help to God when we perceive injustice. And God's answer is that he is at work and we can live by our faith in him. We can commit our lives into his hands
[time=1333] and we can celebrate, celebrate in the embrace of hope that we have in our relationship with
[time=1340] the Almighty God who loves us. I just want to ask you today before we go through this so the words can kind of pop off the pages today. I want you to think right now what injustice is going on in your life that you want to ask God why? Maybe it's finances.
[time=1356] Maybe you see unbelievers around you and you're a believer and you don't get that.
[time=1360] God, they're making more money than I am. I don't understand that. Maybe it's in your
[time=1366] career. Maybe it's like an unbeliever is advancing up the corporate ladder fast in you are and you're saying, "God, I don't get that. I'm obeying you. I'm trusting what's not all about." Maybe it's physical. Maybe you've had some illness or someone in your families has some illness or you've just got some bad news from the doctor on test results. And you're saying, "God, why? I've been faithful. Why?" We just ask God why.
[time=1393] And I want you to think what that injustice is with you. You know, maybe it's a spiritual one. Maybe you haven't figured out this stuff on God and you're wondering, "God, what is going on here? Why? What is the meaning of life? Why?" And I want you to think of that
[time=1408] right now. And we're going to go through God's embrace of hope, Habakkuk's writings of God's embrace for hope. And the first thing we see is a cry for help. A cry for
[time=1418] help. And that's where it all starts. I'd like you to just know why he's doing this.
[time=1422] Let me give you a brief history lesson. Kelly told us last week that in 722 B.C., a Syria
[time=1428] conquered the 10 northern tribes of Israel, okay? But you have two southern tribes in Judah. And they got a great king about that time. And his name's Hezekiah, wonderful God, godly guy. We know a lot about him from Scripture. But he did one thing he shouldn't
[time=1443] have done. He showed some envoys from Babylon all his gold and silver and spices in his
[time=1449] palace. And Isaiah prophesied Judah's downfall in 2 Kings 20. Well, then a little later,
[time=1456] Hezekiah's son, I believe, Manasseh becomes king. And he's wicked. He's really wicked.
[time=1461] And he rules for about 26 years. And he's so wicked, it's witchcraft, it's sorcery,
[time=1467] it's sacrificed his own children in the temple. He did idolatry in the temple, Baal worship
[time=1473] Ashrow Pulse. And he finally was taken in Assyrian captivity himself. And he did repent. He did
[time=1482] repent. But God says, you know, you've created a lot of consequences here. Nationwide, it's going to be a real problem. And his son, Amnon, is a wicked king of Judah, just a wicked king of Judah. And then Josiah comes. And Josiah comes in 639 B.C. And Hezekiah the
[time=1499] priest finds the book of the law in the temple. And they read it. It's about 18 years into Josiah's reign. And they just praise God. And they say, we're going to do this the right way. And we're going to love God. And we're going to stop idolatry. And then in 612 B.C.,
[time=1516] Nineveh, Assyria's capital, falls to Babylon. So Assyria conquered Israel's 10 northern tribes.
[time=1522] And then Babylon conquers Assyria. Because Babylon had come on to the scene about 630
[time=1529] B.C., about 18 years before that. And they're bad people. And in 609 B.C., this is in 2 Kings
[time=1536] 23, Josiah dies in a battle with Egypt. And his son, J.O.A., has reigns for three months
[time=1543] and Pharaoh Niko of Egypt, invades Judah and takes him out. And he replaces him with his brother, Jehoia Kim, who is king when Habakkuk writes. And it says in 2 Kings 24, 4, J.O.A.
[time=1559] Kim has shed and filled Jerusalem with innocent blood. He's a bad guy. And in 605 B.C.,
[time=1566] Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, we know a lot about Nebuchadnezzar, right? He comes in and he just defeats Pharaoh Niko at the Battle of Karkamish. And he pursued the Egyptians back through Palestine, which brings him to Jerusalem. So he besieges it. He takes hostages including Daniel that we see in Daniel 1-1. And he would have conquered the city then, but he gets news that his dad has just died. So he returns to Babylon to ascend to the throne. And I want you to keep in mind here that Babylon, they're bad people, but they got a lot of great things that other countries might be envious of. They got these hanging gardens. They got indoor plumbing. They got indoor water. They got a lot going on, but
[time=1606] they're wicked. And in 604 B.C., about a year after that, probably, Habakkuk writes.
[time=1612] And this is really interesting. And the Dead Sea Scrolls that we found in 1947 in Kumran,
[time=1619] the best preserved and the biggest commentary of any book in the Old Testament is the one on Habakkuk. So we've learned a lot from that. And his contemporaries include Jeremiah, Daniel,
[time=1630] Ezekiel. And he's just saying, "Will Judah have a chance?" God, "Will your people have
[time=1636] a chance?" Habakkuk means embrace. And he embraces God. And he embraces others. And
[time=1644] he asks God why. And the unique thing about Habakkuk is that the other prophets proclaim God's divine judgment. You listen to the judgment of God for your lack of obedience.
[time=1656] Habakkuk asks God to bring it. Bring your divine judgment. Where is the hope? And so
[time=1665] the first thing he does is he cries for help. And if you want to look there, verse 2, "How long, O Lord of chapter 1, must I call for help, but you do not listen? I cry to you violence, but you do not save. Why do you make me look at injustice?" And you might be saying that in your life right now with what you were thinking about. "Why do you tolerate wrong? Destruction and violence are before me." There is strife and conflict of bounds.
[time=1688] So he doesn't like this injustice that's going on. And either do you. And in verse 4, he says, "The law is paralyzed, even though Josiah found it, and they did that, and they obeyed God, the law is paralyzed. And justice never prevails. Justice never prevails."
[time=1704] You can go strong there. "The wicked hem in the righteous, like me," Habakkuk. "So
[time=1711] that justice is perverted." And so his first question is, "Why does God permit injustice
[time=1718] among his people?" And it's a good question. And God's answer is he's bringing the bad
[time=1725] boys of Babylon to the scene of events. Verse 5. Look at the nations. This is God's answer to the first question. Look at the nations and watch and be utterly amazed for I'm going to do something in your days that you would not believe even if you were told. I'm raising
[time=1739] up the Babylonians, these bad guys, that ruthless and impetuous people. Now raising up doesn't mean he's glorifying him. It means he's allowing them to come on to the scene of events who sweep across the whole earth to seize dwelling places, not their own. They are feared and dreaded people. They are a law to themselves. Think of that. A law to themselves.
[time=1757] Do you ever do that? And do you ever do this? They promote their own honor. Do you promote your own honor? It's like the marketplace tells us to do that. "Their horses are swifter
[time=1768] than leopards, fiercer than wolves at dusk. Their cavalry gallops headlong. Their horsemen come from afar. They fly like a vulture swooping to devour. They call, they all come bent
[time=1778] on violence. They're bad people. Their hoards advance like a desert wind and gather prisoners like sand. They deride kings and scoff at rulers. They would do that publicly. They laugh
[time=1789] at all fortified cities. They build up earthen ramps. They would build big piles of dirt to come up to a city wall and then conquer it. And they capture them. And then they sweep
[time=1799] past like the wind and go on and listen to this, guilty men whose own strength is their
[time=1805] God. And I want to ask you today, do you think there's even a hint of that in your life?
[time=1812] Where your own strength is your God? Where your own strength is your God? Babylon was
[time=1818] a wicked people. Zedekiah who eventually was the last king of Judah who gets taken into
[time=1824] Babylonian captivity. Nebuchadnezzar had his eyes poked out after the last thing he saw,
[time=1832] which was his two sons being killed in front of him. So that's what's embedded on his mind. That's the image for the rest of his life. There are wicked people. And Habakkuk
[time=1843] asks why? He asks why. And there's just a point I want to make here. Psalm 103 10 says,
[time=1851] "God does not give a one-for-one punishment for our sins." If he did, we'd be dead. Okay?
[time=1860] Hebrews 10, 10 says, "All sin is judged at the cross of Christ." And 10, 18 says, "You're not going to add anything to it." Jesus was asking Luke 13, "Why are these bad things
[time=1870] happening to good people because they're not quite obeying you just right?" And Jesus says, "No." He said in John 1633, "The bad things happen to good people here." That's
[time=1879] what's going on here. And I do want to clarify though, I think in my heart there's damage
[time=1887] when I sin every time. And I do think in my heart there's blessing when I obey every
[time=1893] time. So Habakkuk says, "Oh, come on. Why would God allow wicked Babylon to punish the
[time=1900] unrighteous Judah?" He says in verse 12, "O Lord, are you not from everlasting? My God,
[time=1906] my holy one, we will not die. O Lord, you have appointed them to execute judgment. O
[time=1912] rock, you have ordained them to punish. Your eyes are too pure to look on evil. You cannot tolerate wrong. Why then do you tolerate the treacherous? Why are you silent while the wicked swallow up those more righteous than themselves?" Now look at that, that's really important. Verse 13 at the end, "Why are you silent while the wicked swallow up those
[time=1930] more righteous than themselves? Come on, God, great on the curve. You have made men like
[time=1936] fish in the sea, like sea creatures that have no ruler. The wicked foe pulls all of them up with hooks." And that's true. And Nebuchadnezzar got this from the Syrian kings. When they
[time=1949] would take people captive from Israel and Judah, they would hook them through the nose and the mouth like a fish. Two hundred thousand of them in one setting. Manasseh was one of
[time=1959] those when he was taken captive as the king of Judah by Assyria. They'd hook them, so that's actually happening. He catches them in his net. He gathers them up in his drag net, which would be at the bottom in fishing. And he rejoices in his glad. "Therefore he sacrifices to his net and burns in since to his drag net. For by his net he lives in luxury." See, they got a lot going on. So it's a nice place. "And enjoys the choices food. Is he to keep on emptying his net destroying nations without mercy?" Why would you allow
[time=1991] wicked Babylon to punish the unrighteous? You know, I can identify this really with
[time=1997] this really well. Because I remember in junior high, this God-grading on the curve thing really was a big deal to me. Because I was a Christian. I grew up in the church. It was baptized when I was nine. And in basketball I was working really hard. And I was praying.
[time=2014] And I'd watch some kids in junior high that would drink a little bit and not work as hard, but they'd play ahead of me. They'd start. I'd say, "God, why? Why aren't you grading
[time=2026] on the curve?" And maybe you'd do that. "God, I'm a man here. What are you doing?" You
[time=2033] know, but the first thing in the embrace of hope, of God's embrace of hope, is to cry out to God. To cry out to God. Not necessarily go complain into others. See, I started my
[time=2044] study of Habakkuk thinking Habakkuk was a bit of a whiner. Philippians 2, 14, that I quoted my home all the time to my children. Don't do anything. Don't do anything in complain.
[time=2056] Do everything without complaining. But there's something about taking and how the Psalmist
[time=2063] does and how David does taking. And to get this embrace of hope from God taking that injustice that I perceive and crying out to God. And I concluded that he's doing a good
[time=2075] thing here and taking it to God. Imagine in this concept of injustice, if just one of
[time=2082] these stories was yours, a 12-year-old girl learns at school that her dad is dead because
[time=2088] his vehicle was crushed by a truck and it was a truck driver's fault. A young woman
[time=2094] loses her mom to a premature heart attack. A woman loses her baby in the ninth month
[time=2100] of pregnancy and has to deliver the dead body. A person loses relatives to a freak accident
[time=2109] when a semi overturns on a family and crushes the entire family. After 37 years of marriage
[time=2116] an attractive, godly woman is abandoned by her husband. And I know you have stories that
[time=2122] are similar. What if one of those stories were yours? What would you do? What if they
[time=2130] all were the same person? Because each one of those stories is my mom's. And I've never
[time=2140] heard her complain. I'm sure she's probably asked God why, but that's been between her
[time=2148] and God, and I've just watched her do one thing and that's commit her life into his
[time=2154] hands. And that's the second point here, what Habakkuk does. So the first point, I want
[time=2160] you to lift up your left hand. And that is to cry out to God, as if you're crying out
[time=2167] to God for help. And that's to go ahead and keep them up, the first thing, to embrace
[time=2174] God's hope is to cry out to him, to cry out to him and go and put him down. Well, the
[time=2181] second thing is, we're going to commit life into his hands. I'm going to make a commitment
[time=2187] of my circumstances, whatever that injustice is, to his hands. Look in verse one, Habakkuk says, "I will stand at my watch and station myself on the ramparts. I will look to see
[time=2198] what he will say. He's got imagery here as if he's looking out to see what the enemy's doing. But I think he's just, he's using you at his imagery. What he will say to me and what answer I am to give to this complaint. And now we're going to see the central theme
[time=2214] in scriptures and it's really two things. Number one, commit your life, committing your
[time=2221] life into his hands, results in life. A commitment of your circumstances like the picture into his hands, results in life. Non-commitment, results in death. Non-commitment, results
[time=2234] in death. And here is God's answer of verse four. Verse four, "The righteous will live
[time=2244] by faith." Look what he contrasts with faith. See, he has puffed up, his desires are not, his desires are not upright, but the righteous will live by his faith. He's contrasting a proud heart with a humble heart. Faith is an acronym I've used before, forsaking all, I trust him. But I will not exercise my trust in him unless I humble my heart to him. If
[time=2266] I harden my heart to him, that's non-commitment. That my masquerade itself is partial surrender.
[time=2275] But the righteous will live by faith. The first time righteousness is used in scripture in Habakkuk would know this, is Genesis 15-6 when it says, "Abraham believed," that's the same thing as faith. "Abraham believed and it was credited to him as righteousness." Faith. And it's this verse, "The righteous will live by faith that Paul uses as the
[time=2297] theme verse, verses 1, 16 and 17, for Romans." But there's a gospel. And it's the power
[time=2305] of God, and it's Jesus Christ who can save anyone, anybody, and the just and the righteous
[time=2312] shall live by faith, by faith in him. Hebrews 11 once, his faith is the substance of things
[time=2324] hoped for and the evidence of things not seen. Well, he goes on in verse 5 there, and he says
[time=2332] 5 through 20. He talks about how the proud and heart are condemned, unless they'd repent, and he went and write this down. It's a taunt song. Habakkuk has this taunt song, and it's
[time=2343] five woes to a proud heart who is his own God. Remember, they act like they're their own God. They look for the strength and their own honor. And here's the five woes. It's against destruction. You've got a proud heart. There'll probably be some destruction in your life. Second, he says, woe to deception. You've got a proud heart. You're going to be deceiving people around you again and again and again. Third, you've got a proud heart. There's going to be death. Babylon was murderous. Nebuchadnezzar ran it that way.
[time=2375] Fourth, there was drunkenness. And you've got a proud heart. There's going to be some kind of an addiction because it's going to be all about you and not about others and not about God. And finally, idolatry. And idolatry is so subtle today. Today, it can
[time=2388] be a car. It can be a house. It can be jewelry. It can be something somebody else has. It
[time=2396] can be chairman of a committee at church. It can be a position in the band. It can be
[time=2402] a spot on the organization. It's everywhere. It's everywhere. Idolatry. And I just want
[time=2409] you to, you can turn there if you want. I'm just going to read quickly. In Daniel 4.
[time=2413] Now we're talking about Nebuchadnezzar, right? He's leading the bad boys of Babylon. Five woes to him. And just listen to what happened in his life. He says in Daniel 4, 28, look
[time=2424] at everything I did. Look at this kingdom. And Deuteronomy 8 says, don't you ever do
[time=2430] that with your proud heart because God created you. God gave you the eyes. God gave you the
[time=2436] years. He gave you the talents. Who are you to say to God? Look at what I did. And immediately
[time=2442] he falls to the ground and eats grass like an animal. And he starts to come to the end
[time=2448] of that time. And he says in verse 34 and Daniel 4, at the end of that time, I Nebuchadnezzar raised my eyes toward heaven and my sanity was restored. And then I praised the most high. I honored and glorified him who lives forever. His dominion is an eternal dominion.
[time=2464] His kingdom endures from generation to generation. And then listen how he concludes. Now I, Nebuchadnezzar,
[time=2475] the bad boys from Babylon. Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and glorify the king of
[time=2481] heaven because everything he does is right. Everything he does is right. And all his ways,
[time=2488] all of them are just. And listen to this. And those who walk in pride, he is able to humble.
[time=2497] Nebuchadnezzar, who God's bringing on the scene of events, the bad guy. He repents. Remember,
[time=2508] I used to sell anti-classic cars at auction. I used to own crews international. In 1992, I changed my life. Mine's different. You know, I grew up in the church. I grew up in a relationship
[time=2521] with God. And I forgot my roots subtly after 10 years in the marketplace. And we had this auction
[time=2527] in a city where a competitor had an auction in that same city, either the week before us or the week after us once a year. And I felt like they were lying a lot about what they were doing. I
[time=2537] felt they lied to get people to consign their cars at the event. I felt like they were lying about
[time=2543] the sale total at the end. And so I'm having this conversation with God. And I'm saying, God, I want to tell the truth. I want to do this. God owns my business kind of thing. But now what do I do? If they're going to fudge on the number, should I? God, you know, I'm not going to do it.
[time=2558] Let's just see what happens. All right? But God, I can tell you how this would work better PR-wise.
[time=2564] Why don't you take every event that I have and every deal that I do and make it work?
[time=2569] And those guys, they need to be gone. Then I could have all that business, and it would just work beautifully. God, and I could give more money to your kingdom. Thank you.
[time=2577] Well, I'll never forget. I was in Pebble Beach, Monterey and Pebble Beach and Carmel
[time=2584] were in the most beautiful places on earth. And we had an auction. It was in the evening, too.
[time=2588] What do you say when they're before and after each other? consecutive. Two consecutive evenings.
[time=2595] And so I got up that morning and I just want to see how beautiful it was. I worked out and I love fresh squeezed orange juice. And there was this place across the courtyard where there was where you could get fresh squeezed orange juice from the hotel. I thought, you know what? I'm going to go get some fresh squeezed orange juice. Just got to work it out. I go get it and I'm really happy and I'm really happy. I think I had a cinnamon crunch bagel up some kind, too, you know.
[time=2615] And I'm really happy. And there he is, the guy I prayed about. And my orange juice glass keeps
[time=2624] getting higher and higher. But people can recognize this. So I got, what am I going to do? I sit on
[time=2632] the bench beside him where he's sitting. And I said, how are you doing, man? I'll never get
[time=2640] what he did. He put his hand on his face. He looked up at the sign. I said, God is with me again today.
[time=2653] See what had happened is he had been through a bitter divorce. He had struggled with some addictions. And I think through AA, he had given his life to Christ. And he quite looked, feel,
[time=2663] smell and taste the way I wanted it to. But that had happened nevertheless. And I felt rather
[time=2669] awkward before God. And I changed my prayers. And I'm going to challenge you to do this today.
[time=2673] This is a little sidebar on what we're doing. I changed my prayers to make anything can happen.
[time=2679] God, if it's good for the kingdom. You can bless everybody. I know your work with everybody.
[time=2683] Your work with King Nebuchadnezzar, your work with this competitor, I thought was bad.
[time=2686] You know what? If I can't sell a car that I wish I would have sold, if I miss out on a collection,
[time=2693] the solid auction that I thought we should sell, I'm just going to chalk that up as you know what's going on. And you're at work with everybody. And you're building the kingdom. That's the overall
[time=2704] good. And that's what I want to be about. And I got to tell you, that's so freeing. Pride goes like this. What's that? And I humble my heart and I become clay before God. And he molds me, and he shapes me. Well, that guy died soon after that. God was at work. He had a unique disease,
[time=2720] and he gave his life to Christ before he died. He died at a very young age. And I saw another
[time=2726] thing like that. A really wealthy guy, probably the wealthiest guy I ever dealt with. And he was a
[time=2732] former professional hockey player. He got involved in real estate. He was a contractor, and he built one of the biggest hotels in the world. And it was also a casino. And he made a lot of money.
[time=2741] He owned the Las Vegas airport, and this guy came to town by the name of Howard Hughes.
[time=2745] And he wanted to buy the airport, so the guy sold Howard Hughes at a big price to the airport.
[time=2752] And Howard Hughes is in his plane one day, and he's looking around the land all around the airport, and he says, "Who owns this?" That's the same guy that sold him the airport.
[time=2760] So now I sold him the land around it for a whole bunch of money, and that's where he took the money.
[time=2764] He put it in a casino, and this guy is tough. He is tough. You know, he invented swear words,
[time=2771] and he was just a tough guy, you know? And I looked at that, and I sold him a lot of cards, and I got to tell you, I was thankful for that, but I just wondered, "God, why this guy?
[time=2780] Why billions of dollars to this guy?" And you know what? About 36 months ago, he had a window
[time=2787] letting him know that his time had come, and he was going to die. Had a unique disease.
[time=2795] And he spent that last 36 months trying to decide how to give all that money away.
[time=2801] And his wife was a believer, and he had a lot of Christian business principles in his life,
[time=2808] but it didn't look the way I wanted it to look. He was debt-free always. He helped a lot of people in secret, gave cash to save people, their homes and things like that. And I just made up my mind, I'm not going to do that anymore. I'm going to be about the higher good. I'm not a hero in this story. God has changed me, and he can change you. He can free you from that building your own kingdom
[time=2830] here today, even in the church. And so to embrace God's hope, the first thing we do is we lift our
[time=2837] left hand, go ahead and do that right now, and we cry out to God. The second thing is we lift our right hand, and now we have two hands up, and we're committing it into his hands. We're committing
[time=2848] the circumstances and the life into his hands. And while we've got our hands up, we can celebrate,
[time=2854] and that's our third point. The celebration of hope. The celebration of hope. Habakkuk is now moved from why to our weight to who, where his focus will now change. And he offers a prayer of
[time=2869] praise, and there's three things here. First two verses in chapter three, he asks for mercy.
[time=2874] Next thing he does is he remembers God's faithfulness. He remembers a thousand years prior,
[time=2880] Habakkuk does, that God delivered Israel from Egypt. And he recounts that, and you and I need
[time=2886] to do that in our lives when we pray to God. God, you brought me, I should have done that when I was saying that about the competition. God, you brought me here, you changed my life, you changed my heart, you're restoring my relationships, you're making me new. But instead, I want him to
[time=2899] grate on the curve and stop those guys. But it's not what he wants me to do. He wants me to remember his faithfulness, the second thing. And then the third thing is hope in him. Habakkuk ends,
[time=2910] and we're going to look at these verses, with an unbelievable celebration of hope, regardless of the circumstances, regardless of the circumstances. And you know what God comes
[time=2921] through? Even though in 586 BC, Judah gets taken captive by Babylon 50 years later, Babylon falls to the Medes Persians, to the Persians, by Babylon only lasted about 90 years.
[time=2933] And in 515 BC, Zerubbabel returns to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple. In 458 BC,
[time=2940] Ezra returns to Jerusalem to rebuild the people. And in 446 BC, Nehemiah returns to rebuild the wall.
[time=2948] Oh, and by the way, about 440 years later, God comes to earth as a man. And Jesus Christ
[time=2959] offers the embrace of hope to every human being. His perfect life, his death, his resurrection
[time=2967] stands there in the center of scriptures and all of history. Prior, there's a shadow.
[time=2974] In all of the future, there's this light. And Christ envelops it all. And every single person
[time=2984] here today, ever hearing this message, ever walking this planet, can respond to the embrace of hope
[time=2990] in Jesus Christ. He is the rock. Habakkuk writes this. If you want to look at verses 16 through 19,
[time=3000] Habakkuk says, "I heard in my heart pounded, my lips quivered at the sound,
[time=3010] decay crept into my bones, and my legs trembled." You ever felt that way where you've been scared like that? I can think of it right now exactly how I felt when a guy took me to the top of the DeKalb County Courthouse, and I was just shaking, showing me on top of the roof the whole city as a little kid. It had been really funny, though, if it was a few days ago. So, decay crept into my
[time=3030] bones, and my legs trembled, yet I will wait patiently for the day of calamity to come on the nation abating us. You're going to deal with them. You're going to judge them. Though the verse 17, though the fig tree does not bud, fig trees in a picture example typically in the Old Testament for
[time=3045] Israel, for God's people. And though it's not blossoming right now, God, and there are no grapes
[time=3052] on the vines, though the olive crops fail, and the fields produce no food, though there are no sheep
[time=3059] in the pen and no cattle in the stalls, though my finances are a mess, so my marriage is a mess,
[time=3065] though I got this bent for pride, though I got bad test results today, though I'm sick,
[time=3072] though my competition is rising up around me, though I might lose my house, yet I will rejoice
[time=3079] in the Lord. I will be joyful in God my Savior. The sovereign Lord is my strength.
[time=3092] The Psalmist writes in 42, Psalm 42, and again in 43, "Why are you so downcast, oh my soul?"
[time=3099] And I know you're saying that when you see this in just as I say it, why so disturbed within me?
[time=3104] Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God, I will celebrate.
[time=3115] Paul calls Jesus our hope for Timothy 1 and 1. Christ Jesus our hope.
[time=3121] And in case you're struggling today, I want to share this with you. He says in 1 Timothy 6, 17, "Command those who are rich in this present world." Maybe it's going great for you, you know it?
[time=3130] But Paul says, "Command those who are rich in this present world, not to be arrogant." There it is again, "Not to be proud, nor to put your hope in wealth." And maybe that's where you are today, which is so uncertain. The wealth is so uncertain, but to put their hope in God,
[time=3148] their confident assurance, not wishful thinking, confidence. God who richly provides us with
[time=3155] everything for our enjoyment. Put your hope today in God.
[time=3162] I tell you, this really started clicking with me Sunday. How many people were at the
[time=3169] baptism's in communion? Was that unbelievable? There was a story that didn't get quite articulated.
[time=3178] Well, you couldn't hear it all. I just want to share that with you. His name was Kenny.
[time=3181] And Kenny was shot by a guy four times, and he was paralyzed. And I don't know how many years
[time=3191] that lasted, but lasted a period of years, I guess. And then Kenny can walk again.
[time=3196] If I got the story right, Kenny hunts down the guy who shot him, and he kills him, and he's a
[time=3204] policeman. And Kenny goes to prison for, I think, about 17 years if I have it right. And while he
[time=3211] was in there, his life was threatened on many occasions by drowning. Some guys tried to drown
[time=3221] him. So you can imagine this guy, and if you were there, you remember not being too excited about being in the water. But God worked in his life, and he has found Christ, and a neighbor of his who
[time=3234] attends here did three-story life with him and invested in him, and Bob Purdy invested in him.
[time=3240] And I watched him, and I watched 35, 36 other people cry out to God for help,
[time=3248] commit their lives into his hands, and I saw their faces. You see some of the pictures? I got to see almost every face of it, so it would come out of the water. And I watched them celebrate
[time=3259] in the hope that they have, in praising God with their lives. And so, go ahead and put that left
[time=3266] hand up. And to receive the embrace of God's hope, I lift my left hand, I'm going to cry out to him
[time=3275] for help, to him. And lift up your right hand, I'm going to lift up my right hand, and I'm going to fully surrender, not partially. I'm going to fully surrender and commit the circumstances along with my life into his hands. And in Habakkuk means embrace. Fold your hands. It means a folding
[time=3292] of the hands. And I'm going to pray like he did. I'm going to live a life of prayer. I'm going to
[time=3299] praise God. I'm going to hope in him. I'm going to remember his faithfulness. I'm going to remember his mercy. And I will yet praise him. And that's the answer for the injustice for your life.
[time=3313] To put your hope in God. You know, rabbinical tradition says that Habakkuk is the son of the
[time=3320] Shumanite woman who rose raised to life by Elisha in 2 Kings 4, 16. Because they use the word Habak.
[time=3329] You know, I think Habakkuk might be that guy. I think he might be the guy who God raised from the
[time=3335] dead through Elisha. And I think Habakkuk is probably a nice guy. He's like music in the temple. He
[time=3343] taught people how to embrace God, which is the meaning of his name. And he taught people how to embrace others. And I just want to ask you today that you take that injustice you see in your life
[time=3357] and that you cry out to God. Don't complain to those around. You cry out to God.
[time=3360] Fully surrender to him. And embrace the hope in prayer. And let God take that. Why?
[time=3370] Change it to who? Change your focus. It's about his kingdom and developing his kingdom.
[time=3375] And the two groups today. And I want you to bow your heads and pray.
[time=3378] There are two groups here. I say this a lot because I believe God's got me here for this.
[time=3386] I'm just responding to what I think he's doing in me. One group is your believer and you perceive
[time=3393] this injustice in your life. And whether it's death, whether it's destruction, you know, whether the bad guys are winning, whether it's the test results, whether it's cancer, you know, whatever it is, cry out to God. Commit it to him. And celebrate in the hope that you have in eternity.
[time=3412] And that the Romans 28 thing will happen, that he'll take it all and he'll work it for good.
[time=3417] He'd rather you pass through here and spend eternity with him than to not pass through it all.
[time=3423] And then the other group I want to pray for you and you were that spiritually restless we talked
[time=3431] about at the beginning. And right now it's it's common clear to you.
[time=3440] What's this all about? It's about you, God. You brought me on to the scene of events.
[time=3447] You worked in the heart of the wickedest people ever to live. You can work in mind.
[time=3452] You work in every heart. I want to fully surrender to you. And I give you that opportunity right now to embrace the hope of God and live that out embracing others so that they will embrace the hope of God.
[time=3469] Just pray right now that you cry out to him and you say, I can't God but you can. I can't pay for
[time=3475] my sin but you can. I can't get forgiveness from her sin anywhere but you. And I want you,
[time=3481] the second thing, just like we talked about here today, I want to fully surrender. Commit my life into your hands. I want you to be Lord of my life. And God, I make that irrevocable decision.
[time=3493] And I'm going to celebrate the hope of you and share that hope with others as my life becomes a fragrance and a prayer. If you prayed that, I sure like to hook up with you. Maybe talk to the
[time=3505] person who invited you or come see one of us, whatever, whatever God's prompting you to do.
[time=3511] God, we love you. We thank you for who you are. We thank you that we can cry to you for help. We
[time=3517] can come directly to you. We thank you for Jesus Christ. We fully surrender our lives to you. God, whatever we're holding back today, whatever injustice we're holding on to, we release to you. And God,
[time=3528] we celebrate the hope that we have in you and make our lives a prayer this week, God.
[time=3532] In the mighty name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
