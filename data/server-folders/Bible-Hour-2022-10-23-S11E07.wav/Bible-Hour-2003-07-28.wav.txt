[time=0] (bells ringing)
[time=30] (upbeat music)
[time=90] Again, it's so nice to have you with us.
[time=92] And I want to, if I can, just take a couple of minutes.
[time=95] And I'd like to just talk to you about two things.
[time=97] One, somewhat light-hearted, but we think important and the other, very serious and having to do with today's message.
[time=107] First of all, kind of on the light-hearted end.
[time=110] I just want to say thank you.
[time=112] And I say this every once in a while, but I'll tell you what, in talking with Mitch and in speaking with Steve, our other two teaching pastors here, we continue to be utterly amazed at the numbers of people like you who are willing to stop us whenever we get to see each other.
[time=132] We bump into you out in the stores, at the gas stations, at the games, downtown, wherever we might be.
[time=139] And so many of you are kind enough just to stop and say thank you.
[time=144] And we want you to know, first of all, that we extend your thanks to those who really make this possible.
[time=153] There are a faithful team of people every week who give themselves to making this broadcast a reality.
[time=159] And so we're glad that it ministers to you.
[time=162] One of the things that we hear you say is how you wish you could come and be a part of it, but you're doing your own thing on Sunday, at your own church, which we think is wonderful.
[time=172] We wouldn't want to change that.
[time=175] But what we do want you to know is this.
[time=177] So oftentimes you talk about how you enjoy and appreciate the teaching and how the worship is encouraging.
[time=184] And I just want you to know that that happens every Wednesday night as well.
[time=189] Every Wednesday night, here at our Black Hawk campus, upstairs in the worship center, we have what we call common ground.
[time=198] And common ground is a weekly worship service where the Word of God is taught oftentimes in a dialogue fashion.
[time=205] We interact with the crowd that is there.
[time=207] The worship is so sweet and God honoring.
[time=211] And 645 to about 815.
[time=213] And again, that time may not work for everybody, but you know, if you've been encouraged by what you've seen and heard in the past here on the Bible Hour, you ought to come and check it out.
[time=223] Wednesday nights at 645, common ground, upstairs in the worship center.
[time=230] Secondly, I want to just maybe get you if you would to just consider what it must have been like to be Hosea.
[time=239] Hosea is the minor prophet that we're going to cover and look at in today's message.
[time=247] It's a story familiar to some, but the more I tell it, the more I realize that there are so many people today, even folks that know the Lord and would be somewhat familiar with scriptures that don't have any idea what took place in this man's life.
[time=262] You see, Hosea was a prophet that God chose to use.
[time=266] And he chose to use Hosea to exemplify, to illustrate God's great love for his people.
[time=274] God's unfailing, faithful love for his unfaithful, wandering, complaining,
[time=284] forgetful people, the nation of Israel.
[time=288] And the way God does this is really miraculous.
[time=292] And maybe almost more miraculous is the way Hosea responds, where you see God says to Hosea, "In order to illustrate my love for an unfaithful people, Hosea, I want you to go and marry a prostitute." He calls this man to this point, not married, to go and marry a woman named Gomer, daughter of the blame.
[time=317] And she's a prostitute, and Hosea knows it.
[time=321] And he not only says, "Mary a prostitute," he says, "have children of prostitution." God in essence says you're gonna marry this woman and she's going to continue in her trade.
[time=333] And she will have children from other men and you, Hosea, are to love her and them well.
[time=339] And the way this thing unfolds and the lessons that get learned and the pictures that get painted, of God's great love for you.
[time=347] And the love that he calls you and I to be willing and ready to extend.
[time=352] It's an amazing picture.
[time=353] And I hope this morning as you listen, maybe like never before, I hope that your heart and your mind would be open to what God's word, what the word of God and the spirit of God has to say to you today, are you really willing to love the way God's loved you?
[time=369] And I hope as you think it through, I hope as you open your heart to the word of God, that you would be as I have been just in thinking this through recently, challenged and grown in new and exciting ways.
[time=383] Thanks.
[time=384] - Well, if you've been around at all the last couple of weeks, you know that we have been studying in the minor prophets.
[time=392] We have been studying the minor prophets and we thought today it might be a good way to just kind of get us going and kind of remind us of a few things if we kind of had a quiz.
[time=402] And I was thinking that maybe what we might wanna do is just have a couple of you come up here and maybe even help with the quiz.
[time=410] I see heads immediately going down and we were just thinking a couple of you could come up and maybe help us remember some of what we've covered.
[time=419] So I'm thinking maybe I might come over any volunteers
[time=427] with no hands.
[time=428] Hey, how about you guys right down here in the front?
[time=430] Yeah, in the blonde there in the glass.
[time=432] Yeah, you guys, honey.
[time=435] Yeah, come on, you guys can come up and help us out.
[time=437] - Okay, okay.
[time=438] - Well, we love to help.
[time=439] Yeah, come on up.
[time=440] - This is exciting.
[time=441] - Give these folks a hand.
[time=442] - Thank you.
[time=442] - Yeah, come on up here.
[time=443] - Thank you.
[time=444] - Oh my.
[time=445] - Yeah.
[time=446] - We can do it.
[time=447] Thanks for being willing to help.
[time=449] I've seen you around and know that I know your name.
[time=451] I'm Kelly.
[time=452] - I'm Dan and this is my wife, Jan.
[time=454] - Well hello.
[time=455] - Jan, how are you?
[time=456] - Good to meet you.
[time=457] - Thank you very much.
[time=459] It's good to meet you guys too, Jan.
[time=461] It looks like you're gonna have a little minor profit of your own there, huh?
[time=463] - Oh, thank you.
[time=465] - Yeah, I'm sure you are.
[time=466] - Yeah, it's a matter of fact.
[time=467] - October.
[time=468] - That's right in October.
[time=469] - Yeah, it's coming up.
[time=470] - It is such a thrill to meet you in person.
[time=472] - That's right.
[time=473] - We've heard all your sermons.
[time=474] - All of them.
[time=475] - Wow, really.
[time=476] - Yeah.
[time=476] - All of them, huh?
[time=477] - Wow, it's kind of scary.
[time=479] Well, that's great.
[time=482] Well, as you guys know, the last couple of weeks we have been studying the minor profits and I thought we'd start off today with a little quiz before the message.
[time=491] Just to see how well everybody's been listening.
[time=494] - Well, actually, we've not been here the last couple of weeks.
[time=499] - I see.
[time=500] - We've had some little emergencies that have kept us, but any who, we'd love to help you out.
[time=505] - Everybody's okay, yeah.
[time=506] - Yes, everybody's fine.
[time=508] - We sure would like to help.
[time=508] I know a lot about minor profits.
[time=511] You know, as a matter of fact, they're part of my daily life.
[time=514] Our daily life, actually.
[time=516] - Wow, every day.
[time=517] - Every day.
[time=518] - Minor profits, yeah, it's impressive.
[time=521] It's impressive, huh?
[time=522] Well, I'll tell you what, Dan, why don't you just share a little bit of your minor profit expertise with us.
[time=528] I'm sure we'd all love to hear a little bit of it.
[time=530] Go right ahead.
[time=531] - Okay, okay.
[time=532] - Yeah, well, the true definition of a minor profit is the amount of money you have left over after taxes, depreciation, and then amaturization expenses.
[time=541] - That's right after all the expenses.
[time=544] - Yeah.
[time=544] - The sad truth is, this past several years, we've had some accounting scandals.
[time=549] - Oh, yeah.
[time=550] - And some companies have been improperly calculating their minor and major profits.
[time=555] - Yes, naughty, naughty little bookkeepers.
[time=557] - Very bad.
[time=558] - Yeah, but not me and my firm.
[time=559] - No, not Dan, not Dan.
[time=560] - We go strictly by the book.
[time=562] - By the books.
[time=563] - Yeah, I understand.
[time=564] - That's what they call it.
[time=565] - Honest, 'cause the day is long.
[time=567] - That's it.
[time=568] Wow.
[time=569] - Well, I'll tell you what, you guys.
[time=572] We've actually been studying and talking about a different kind of profit, the profits that are in the Bible, P-R-O-P-H.
[time=580] - Oh, okay.
[time=581] - Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
[time=583] - He's talking about the profits that are in the Bible.
[time=587] Oh, my Dan, he's always willing just to put on his little accountants hat.
[time=590] - That's right, Jan, you betcha.
[time=591] It's all in perspective.
[time=592] - Yeah, that's right.
[time=593] See, honey, the minor profits were those profits that worked in the mines around Jerusalem and Iraq, digging for gold, Frankenstein, and Murr to present to the baby Jesus by the goat herders who watched their flocks by night, honestly.
[time=607] - Oh, yeah, the goat herder miners, of course.
[time=610] - Yeah, that's it.
[time=611] - Well, you know, actually, that's not exactly, that's not exactly right either, you guys.
[time=616] The minor profits are actually the last 12 books of the Old Testament, the last 12 books of the Old Testament.
[time=624] - Old Testament, yeah, of course, we knew that.
[time=627] - Yeah, yeah.
[time=629] - How about, well, let's do this.
[time=630] How about you just take a stab at naming a few of them.
[time=635] I don't want to put you on the spot, I don't know.
[time=636] - Okay, okay.
[time=637] - How familiar you are with the Bible.
[time=639] - The Bible, the Bible, the Bible.
[time=641] - You know, I've always said it's the foundation of our thing. - It is, it is the B-I-B-L-E.
[time=646] Now, that's the book for me.
[time=649] - For us. - Ah, so, honestly.
[time=652] - We're not ashamed to say we're Christian.
[time=653] - That's right, that's right.
[time=655] We've been going to church for 10 years now.
[time=657] - 10? - 10 years.
[time=660] - Wow, 10 years.
[time=662] That's impressive.
[time=664] Well, then go ahead, why don't you give it a shot?
[time=667] Maybe just name one or two of the minor prophets.
[time=670] - Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[time=672] - No, I think you better start 'cause I'm drawing a blank.
[time=674] I'm drawing a blank.
[time=675] - Okay, all right, okay.
[time=677] Oh, I've got one.
[time=678] Oh, honey, what was the name of that guy that complained all the time?
[time=682] - Job. - Job, job.
[time=684] - Yeah, job's one of them, right?
[time=686] No, I think you mean Job.
[time=688] - Oh, yes. - Job, that would be Job.
[time=691] But you're not too far off.
[time=692] Actually, the first book of the minor prophets comes right after the book of Daniel.
[time=698] - Daniel. - Right after the book of Daniel.
[time=699] - There's a whole book in the Bible named after you.
[time=702] - Wow. - Wow.
[time=704] - Wow, learning new stuff every day, aren't you there, Jan?
[time=707] - Wow. - Yeah, the first book of the minor prophets is...
[time=711] Hosea. - Hosea, oh, that's right.
[time=714] Oh, honey, you know that song we like to sing about him.
[time=717] You know how that goes?
[time=717] Hosea. - Hosea.
[time=721] - Hosea in the highest. - I like it, yeah.
[time=725] - Yeah, it's one of her favorite hymns, we love that.
[time=727] - Amazing.
[time=728] Okay, then after Hosea comes Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah.
[time=734] - Whoa, Jonah, Jonah, I love that story.
[time=737] Jonah in the great white shark.
[time=739] - Oh, honey, I think it was a whale.
[time=741] - What did I say?
[time=742] - You used that shark.
[time=743] - That was cute, though, that was cute, though, yeah, it was a bit of a great white shark, it could have been a whale.
[time=746] We know it was a big fish or some sort.
[time=748] - That's right, that's right.
[time=749] - And when that fish spit Jonah back up on short, God chased his name to Ishmael, and he became the greatest fisherman, the Dead Sea ever knew.
[time=757] - That's right, you know, I just love the way that God has always changed in the names of people in the Bible. - Angel.
[time=763] - Precious, precious, actually.
[time=764] - Yeah, yeah.
[time=767] (audience laughing) - Well, after Jonah comes Micah, name him, Habakkuk.
[time=775] - Oh, bless you.
[time=776] (audience laughing) - Thank you, Jan.
[time=781] Zephaniah, Hagii, Zechariah, and Malachi.
[time=785] - Oh, Zechariah?
[time=787] - Oh, honey, I love that name, wouldn't that be a great name for our new baby?
[time=790] - Oh, wow, Zechariah, Zechariah, Daniel, actually we could name him after you cookie fave.
[time=795] - Oh, like the sound of that, that's great.
[time=798] - Zechariah. - That's great.
[time=799] - Well, now that we've named them all, now that we've named them all, why don't we just jump into a few questions?
[time=805] How about this, okay?
[time=806] - Okay, let's bring it, bring it on.
[time=808] - Shoot, Micah. - Sure.
[time=809] - Good.
[time=810] What's the difference between the minor prophets and the major prophets?
[time=815] What was the difference?
[time=815] - Salary!
[time=816] - No, it wouldn't be salary.
[time=819] - Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[time=820] I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[time=821] - Wouldn't be salary.
[time=822] - The major prophets, they told really big prophecies, and the minor prophets, they just told Shulich.
[time=829] - Oh, that's right, that's right.
[time=830] - That's right, alright, good.
[time=831] - Short stories and jokes, actually, just to warm up the crowd before Jesus spoke the Ten Commandments from the Sermon on the Mount and fed the 5,000 men their last supper.
[time=840] (laughing) - Very good. - Thank you.
[time=843] - Yes, that's it. - Yes, that's it.
[time=844] - No, that's not quite, you were close there, but that's not quite right either.
[time=849] - Okay. - Okay.
[time=851] - You know what I mean?
[time=852] - You know what something, we should ask for a lifeline.
[time=855] - Oh yeah, a lifeline, maybe 50 or 50 other friends.
[time=858] - Yes, we could put the audience.
[time=859] - No lifelines, I'm sorry, Jihin and Dan, we don't have any lifelines on this quiz.
[time=863] How about if I just give you the answer to this one?
[time=866] And actually, yeah, Dan, big guy, you were close there, you were real close there, and so the whole joke thing came in, the major prophets were the prophecies that were longer in length.
[time=878] The minor prophets were called minor simply because they were shorter in their writing, in their duration.
[time=884] - Yes, you learned something new here, honey.
[time=886] It sure does pay to be here on Sunday.
[time=887] - It sure does. - Sure does, yeah, sure does.
[time=890] - Well, hey, Dan, Jan, what can I say?
[time=892] Thanks so much for being here today.
[time=894] - Oh, oh my God. - Anytime.
[time=895] - Appreciate your help. - We love the help, yeah.
[time=896] - Yeah, okay. - You guys were wonderful.
[time=898] - Anytime you need help, you just pick up the phone and you give us a call. - Yes, call on.
[time=902] - We love it, we love it. - I'll make sure to look out.
[time=904] - I'll make sure to do that. - Yeah, okay.
[time=906] - Bye-bye. - Bye-bye.
[time=907] - Here we go. - Yeah.
[time=909] - Bye-bye.
[time=910] That was fun, wasn't it?
[time=913] Hey, and it was fun.
[time=916] And just a reminder that sometimes this stuff can get a little confusing, but it is good to be together and it is good to get on the same page.
[time=923] And we have been talking a little bit about the minor prophets, and I want to invite you this morning to open up to Josea.
[time=931] Like we said, Josea, Josea in the...
[time=936] Josea comes right after Daniel.
[time=940] And I want to take you back, if I can, just a couple of weeks ago, as we kind of jumped in on the whole discussion of the prophets, I told you that God, as we watch this story
[time=958] of the Bible unfold, it becomes really clear, real quickly, that there was one thing that God wanted so desperately to have.
[time=969] God wanted from the beginning of this story, the story of God and his people.
[time=974] God wanted to have a people who would be his own.
[time=978] Remember talking about that?
[time=980] He wanted so desperately to have a people who would be his own.
[time=984] This nation of Israel that he called to himself, he wanted desperately for them to be a people who would know him, who would love him, who would be faithful to him.
[time=994] A people who would obey him.
[time=996] You see, God had it in his heart to reach the nations.
[time=1000] And it was God's plan from the beginning to reach the nations through his people.
[time=1006] And he wanted his people's love for God to be so great.
[time=1010] He wanted their faithfulness to be so strong.
[time=1012] He wanted their devotion to him to be so clear.
[time=1016] He wanted their conviction to be so evident that the nations would know him.
[time=1023] But what he got was the nation of Israel.
[time=1031] A stubborn, complaining, whining, forgetful, unfaithful people.
[time=1040] An unfaithful bunch of folks who forgot
[time=1047] time and time again, all that he had done, all that he had provided.
[time=1053] And so God, as we come to this story this morning, this book of Hosea, God begins to, and I'll just tell you right up front, he begins to here in this story of Hosea, pain a very graphic picture.
[time=1068] God is wanting here in this book to illustrate in a powerful way for his people, the unfaithfulness that they had exercised, their utter lack of devotion, their utter disregard for the commitment that they had made.
[time=1088] And his enormous, his unending, unbending commitment to them.
[time=1094] Today we see God, Gomer and Israel.
[time=1100] God, Gomer and Israel, faithfully loving the unfaithful.
[time=1106] And let's just say it like this.
[time=1110] We'll just start here with an example.
[time=1115] What if, guys, in the room?
[time=1119] Some of you here, men, today some of you are married.
[time=1124] What if he had, as you were contemplating getting married, what if he had done this with you?
[time=1129] Or guys, there are some here today, you're not married.
[time=1133] Yeah, you're maybe still thinking about what that would be like.
[time=1136] You're maybe hoping today that God will move you in that direction and that there will be a day when your love for him can be expressed as you give your love to a woman.
[time=1146] Well, what if God did this?
[time=1150] Let's just say there's a guy in his late 20s here, maybe early 30s.
[time=1153] And you've been faithfully walking in a surrendered relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=1158] You're not perfect, but you're moving along this road and you love God and you want to serve God and you've given yourself to this family, let's say, and God comes to you.
[time=1169] Let's just say God comes to you and he says to you, "Hey, you know what, pal, it's time.
[time=1173] "I got her.
[time=1176] "I've got her for you.
[time=1177] "It's time for you to be married.
[time=1179] "And I want to show you too.
[time=1182] "I want to take you to her, "but I don't want you to go to her.
[time=1184] "She's ready for you, but she's not, "it's not going to be Sunday here at the church, no?
[time=1191] "She's not here at the church, "and she's not in your small group, "and she's not in the ministry that you serve in.
[time=1199] "No, I want you to go downtown." And you say downtown?
[time=1206] And he says, "Yeah, I want you to go downtown." You see, because this gal that I've got for you to marry, she's a prostitute.
[time=1215] And I want you to marry her.
[time=1220] 'Cause you see, I want to show my people how much I love them.
[time=1230] And you're going to help me do it.
[time=1231] Now some of you are sitting here going, "What in the world is he talking about?" Talk to a friend this week told him we were going to study a little Jose N. Gomer.
[time=1244] Guy had been in the church for years, never heard of it.
[time=1247] Was unfamiliar with the story of Jose N. Gomer.
[time=1251] I was unfamiliar for a long, long time.
[time=1254] But it is a powerful story.
[time=1260] And this little scenario I've talked you through is exactly what God did with this faithful young man named Jose M.
[time=1270] Look with me at the book of Jose at chapter one.
[time=1274] What we're gonna see here is we're going to see in these first few chapters an unfaithful wife restored.
[time=1281] You can write this down, an unfaithful wife restored.
[time=1286] We'll also see later an unfaithful people restored.
[time=1290] And under each we will see her sin, her judgment, her restoration, their sin, their judgment, their restoration.
[time=1298] We'll just follow that pattern.
[time=1300] I want you to look with me at Jose at chapter one, an unfaithful wife restored.
[time=1306] Let's look at her sin.
[time=1308] How all of this unfolds.
[time=1310] Says there in verse two of Jose, "When the Lord first spoke through Jose, "the Lord said to Jose go take to yourself "a wife of harlotry and have children of harlotry
[time=1324] "for the land commits flagrant harlotry "for saking the Lord." The word there harlotry and the Hebrew language, just a straight translation, prostitution.
[time=1338] Prostitution.
[time=1341] So he went, verse three, and he took Gomer, the daughter of the blame, and she conceived and bore him a son.
[time=1350] You can go down to verse six, then she conceived again and gave birth to a daughter.
[time=1358] You can go down to verse eight, and when she had weaned, "Loruhama," the daughter she conceived and gave birth to a son.
[time=1371] So God comes to Josea, and he says to Josea, "Hosea, we're gonna work with our people.
[time=1376] "Here's what I've got for you.
[time=1377] "I want you to go and marry a prostitute." And I want you to, in your relationship, in your marriage to this woman, I want you to look what it says, have children of harlotry.
[time=1391] And we just read through that passage, and we saw that she had conceived and gave birth to three.
[time=1396] Understand the impact of this.
[time=1398] A cursory reading might lead you an item, maybe think that she had these children with him.
[time=1403] But no, the text indicates that these were to be children of prostitution.
[time=1409] These kids were fathered by other men in the night.
[time=1414] This is the picture.
[time=1420] This is the reality.
[time=1421] This is what God wants you and I to see this morning.
[time=1426] It was that bad.
[time=1428] It was that difficult.
[time=1430] It was that ugly, her sin.
[time=1434] And Josea is to love her.
[time=1437] Josea is to have these children.
[time=1440] And you know what, she wasn't waiting around.
[time=1446] She was anxious to get to her sin.
[time=1449] Verse eight, when she had weaned, when she had weaned, "Lo-ru-hamah." I mean, she's not waiting around, right?
[time=1456] In Hebrew tradition, that would have been about two years of age, and she's gone.
[time=1461] She's back at it.
[time=1463] Her sin, the sin of unfaithfulness.
[time=1468] Her judgment.
[time=1472] Look at Josea, chapter two.
[time=1475] Her judgment.
[time=1478] Says in Josea two, verse two, "It says, 'Contend with your mother, contend for she is not my wife, and I am not her husband.' And let her put away her harlotry from her face, and her adultery from between her breasts, or I will strip her naked and expose her, as on the day when she was born.
[time=1496] I will also make her like a wilderness, make her like desert land, and slay her with thirst." Look at verse six.
[time=1504] Excuse me, verse five.
[time=1508] For their mother, Josea two, verse five.
[time=1511] For their mother has played the harlot.
[time=1513] She who conceived them has acted shamefully.
[time=1516] For she said, "I will go after my lovers, who give me my bread, and my water, my wool, and my flax, my oil, and my drink, all of which should have come, all of which you, and I know, when we're thinking clearly, comes from whom?
[time=1531] Him, but no, she like you and me, oftentimes feel as if it's to be had elsewhere, to be gained from some other source.
[time=1541] Therefore, behold, I will hedge up her way with thorns, and I will build a wall against her, so that she cannot find her path.
[time=1550] She will pursue her lovers, but she will not overtake them, and she will seek them, but will not find them.
[time=1555] Then she will say, "I will go back to my first husband, for it was better for me then than now." Her judgment.
[time=1565] Look at verse 13, "I will punish her, for the days of the bales." The Israelis, the nation of Israel in this day, and here we see it again illustrated through Gomer, they had become obsessed with other gods, they had forsaken their own, and come to, in this instance, bail worship, which was a promiscuous and immoral activity, where sex and promiscuity and unfaithfulness were heightened, and people would make those encounters, and those endeavors their offerings to bail, and here he refers to her activity in that arena, I will punish her for the days of the bales when she used to offer sacrifices to them, and adorn herself with her earrings and jewelry, and follow her lovers.
[time=1612] Here you go, so that she, what?
[time=1615] Say it, so that she forgot me,
[time=1624] and follow her lovers.
[time=1628] You know what, you could just put in a blank right there, and you and I could read that, and how would you fill in the blank?
[time=1639] You ever been there?
[time=1640] You ever sensed or felt what it's like to actually be so far down a road, so engaged, and in disobedience, so distant,
[time=1653] from a right relationship with him that you almost like begin to forget him, and follow her, what would you put in the blank,
[time=1667] so that you forgot him?
[time=1671] I will punish her, he says,
[time=1677] and he did.
[time=1682] As you read this story, as you study the text, you realize that this road she went down was a dark, filthy, demeaning, degrading, moral, empty road, and she suffers this daughter of the blame,
[time=1701] she suffers the consequences of that, and then she is restored, and this is amazing stuff,
[time=1711] this picture that you're about to see here is a powerful, powerful illustration of how he moves and how he works, look what he does with Hosea.
[time=1720] We've seen her sin, we've seen her judgment now, watch what God has Hosea do, her restoration, her restoration, chapter three.
[time=1731] Read with me here, look what it says, then the Lord said to me, this is God speaking to Hosea, then the Lord said to me, go again.
[time=1741] I want you to look at that word again, just look at it, don't look at me, look at the word, look at that word again, because isn't that the way it is so often, that he asks you and I to go again, and again, and again.
[time=1760] Two sides of that, isn't that the way it is, him asking you and I to again and again, and again extend mercy, isn't it the way it is, people that you and I again and again and again need it?
[time=1776] And he says to him, go again.
[time=1782] Love a woman, love a woman who is loved by her husband, yet an adulterous, even as the Lord loves the sons of Israel,
[time=1793] though they turn to other gods and love raising cakes.
[time=1796] So I, Hosea, I bought her, he says.
[time=1800] I bought her for myself for 15 shekels of silver and a homer and a half of barley, then I said to her, you shall stay with me for many days, you shall not play the harlot, nor shall you have a man.
[time=1814] So I will also be toward you, for the sons of Israel will remain for many days without king or prince, without sacrifice or sacred pillar, and without Ephod or household idols.
[time=1825] Afterward, the sons of Israel will return and seek the Lord their God and David their king, and they will come trembling to the Lord and to his goodness in the last days.
[time=1836] Please do not miss the imagery of this passage.
[time=1840] Do not miss the literal picture that just got painted.
[time=1844] He bought her back, people.
[time=1846] It says there in verse two, for 15 shekels of silver and a homer and a half of barley.
[time=1853] Do you understand what this means?
[time=1855] What this means is that this gal, Gomer, she has gone so far down this road of prostitution.
[time=1865] She inevitably, you know, at some point left Hosea,
[time=1871] at some point she's gone from these kids, at some point she kind of comes under the possession of some guy who probably had several Gomer's.
[time=1882] And there she is, night after night, week after week giving herself to whoever had money to have her.
[time=1888] And see, this is the way it works.
[time=1891] Finally, she would have gotten to a point.
[time=1894] It may have been weeks, it may have been months.
[time=1896] It was obviously a stretch of time, and finally she comes to this place where she is absolutely done.
[time=1904] She has seen so much, she has been down that road so far that the allure is gone.
[time=1911] She's beat.
[time=1914] She's spent.
[time=1917] She's torn up.
[time=1921] She's no longer attractive.
[time=1923] She can no longer bring in the money and so the guy would have done what they did then.
[time=1930] He would have sold her as a slave.
[time=1934] And so beaten and tattered and torn, spent no longer attractive.
[time=1941] Slaves would be brought up on blocks, clothes taken off, chains sold to the highest bidder.
[time=1950] And there she stands.
[time=1955] And there he comes with his money and his word from God saying, "I'll take her." "I'll take her, and I said to her, 'You shall stay with me now for many days, and you shall not play the harlot, nor shall you have a man.
[time=1972] So I will also be toward you." Wow.
[time=1976] The love of God shone through the love of Hosea,
[time=1985] willing to faithfully love one who had been so very, very unfaithful.
[time=1991] And they will come into verse five, trembling, how she must have trembled there on that block, and they will come trembling to the Lord and to his goodness in the last days.
[time=2003] All of this, as I said earlier, is God's attempt to illustrate.
[time=2007] I believe it was a very real story.
[time=2009] I don't think this is some analogy.
[time=2010] I believe on the scholars would agree as well that this is a true story that God orchestrates to paint a picture of an unfaithful people.
[time=2020] And we see that as the book progresses.
[time=2022] Look with me, an unfaithful people restored.
[time=2026] And we start as we did with her.
[time=2029] We start with their sin.
[time=2031] An unfaithful people restored.
[time=2033] It begins with their sin.
[time=2035] It begins with your sin in mine.
[time=2038] Chapter four, verses one and two.
[time=2040] Listen to the word of the Lord.
[time=2041] Oh, sons of Israel.
[time=2042] Now, Hosea turns in essence to the people, to the nation.
[time=2047] And he speaks on God's behalf.
[time=2049] Listen to the word of the Lord, oh, sons of Israel.
[time=2052] For the Lord has a case against the inhabitants of the land because there is no faithfulness or kindness or knowledge of God in the land.
[time=2062] There is swearing, there is deception, there is murder, there is stealing and adultery.
[time=2067] They employ violence so that bloodshed follows bloodshed.
[time=2073] Verses six to ten, my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.
[time=2080] He now turns his proclamation of judgment.
[time=2083] He now turns his condemning message to beyond the people.
[time=2087] Now he turns to the priests.
[time=2089] I read this this past week and I shudder again, realizing the responsibility.
[time=2094] He gives you and me those who lead.
[time=2097] That which he entrusts to us to feed and give to and equip the people with.
[time=2102] And he turns to the priests.
[time=2104] He says, because you have rejected knowledge, I also will reject you from being my priest.
[time=2109] Since you have forgotten the law of your God, I also will forget your children.
[time=2113] The more they multiplied, the more they sinned against me.
[time=2116] I will change their glory and the shame.
[time=2118] They feed on the sin of my people and direct their desire toward their iniquity.
[time=2123] And it will be like people like priests.
[time=2126] So I will punish them for their ways and repay them for their deeds.
[time=2132] They will eat, but not have enough.
[time=2133] They will play the harlot, but not increase because they have stopped giving heed to the Lord.
[time=2138] The people have been unfaithful.
[time=2141] The priests had been unfaithful.
[time=2143] Now look at chapter seven.
[time=2146] They're sinned.
[time=2150] Laid out before us and clear.
[time=2156] Unmistakable pictures.
[time=2157] Chapter seven, look at verse two.
[time=2162] And they do not consider in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness.
[time=2175] Now their deeds are all around them.
[time=2179] They are before my face.
[time=2182] Look at verse 14.
[time=2184] And they do not cry to me from their heart when they wail on their beds.
[time=2189] Interesting there.
[time=2191] Are they crying?
[time=2195] Are they wailing?
[time=2196] Yes or no?
[time=2198] Yeah, they're crying, aren't they?
[time=2200] They're wailing, they got their face in the pillow.
[time=2203] They're slamming their fist against the bed at night.
[time=2205] Oh, they're wailing.
[time=2206] They're just not wailing to him.
[time=2208] For the sake of grain and new wine,
[time=2214] they assemble themselves.
[time=2216] Oh, they cry.
[time=2217] They just don't cry to him.
[time=2220] Me and the boys had about an hour to kill at the day so we went to the range.
[time=2226] Grabbed a few clubs, got a bucket of balls and we were just having a blast.
[time=2230] And just so happened that Russell, T. and Jake were over at the putting green and I kind of ended up by myself kind of over hitting a bucket.
[time=2239] And I was, there wasn't anybody there, it was just me.
[time=2241] And then I realized that somebody had come, maybe just a few feet away, had come and put down a bucket and had begun to hit balls.
[time=2251] And I'm not really much of a golfer, I love the golf, maybe you love the golf, maybe you've been around driving ranges, maybe you haven't, no big deal.
[time=2262] It's just that you'll learn over time.
[time=2264] You can not only, you know, with your back to somebody who's hitting balls, you can not only see a good swing, or a bad swing.
[time=2278] You can also hear it.
[time=2280] And so I'm over here hitting balls and mine's not so great, but I begin to hear and see behind me that things aren't going so well.
[time=2289] I mean, I'm looking up, I'm seeing chunks of land flying through the air that had their own zip codes.
[time=2295] I mean, this guy was just tearing it up and the balls weren't going where he want, I mean, most of them were going about 20 feet in front of them.
[time=2305] There's dirt, there's grass, there's sea.
[time=2307] I mean, it's just ugly and I'm trying to just kind of keep my own, you know, deal going over here.
[time=2312] And then the expletives start to come out.
[time=2315] He is hot.
[time=2317] And I'm telling you, he is whacking 100 miles an hour.
[time=2321] I mean, there's trenches over there where he's trying to hit balls.
[time=2325] And then, and then he's joined by his buddy.
[time=2328] And now please forgive me, I mean, I don't eavesdrop, you know, often.
[time=2336] But when it's right there, you'll forgive me, right?
[time=2340] I mean, I couldn't have missed it if I tried.
[time=2342] And here's the deal, his buddy's his, and this is not a shot, I'm not trying to be funny here, his buddy's an attorney, and it becomes very clear, very quickly, that his buddy, the attorney and him, the client, neither of them are happy at all.
[time=2359] In fact, what they're engaged in has gone south.
[time=2363] And the attorney comes up, puts his bucket of balls down, he starts hitting, I mean, we've got dual trenches now.
[time=2369] We got grass flying everywhere.
[time=2371] They're cussing and they're talking and they're going off.
[time=2374] I'm still over here just trying to keep out of it.
[time=2376] And it's just getting really, really crazy.
[time=2379] He's talking about how she has counter-filed.
[time=2383] I'll get some of these terms wrong, attorneys, but it was the gist of, she's counter-filed.
[time=2387] And now, I think the best thing we can do is kind of counter-filed her, counter-filed.
[time=2391] I can subpoena this guy over here.
[time=2393] And if I can subpoena this guy, whack, whack, whack!
[time=2398] And their balls are going to the left and the right.
[time=2400] And they're kind of yelling back and forth at each other.
[time=2403] And they get about halfway through the story.
[time=2404] And they stop and they just demean and degrade this gal.
[time=2408] And there's kids involved.
[time=2409] I hear about the kids.
[time=2411] And then they start hitting balls again.
[time=2412] And they, as they're hitting, they can cock the plan.
[time=2416] But they're going to pursue that, well, legally, if things go right, prolong all this for possibly 18 to 24 months.
[time=2423] These guys are miserable.
[time=2430] And they're hoping to prolong it for 18 to 24 months.
[time=2436] They're wailing in their pillow.
[time=2438] I promise you.
[time=2440] They're just not wailing to the right person.
[time=2444] I mean, I wanted to just turn around.
[time=2446] I didn't.
[time=2446] You've been proud of me.
[time=2449] I just want to turn around and say, guys, there's a better, there's a better option.
[time=2455] I feared for my life.
[time=2456] So I just-- it was bad.
[time=2458] And you do the same thing.
[time=2465] And I-- oh, we wail at times.
[time=2471] And we howl.
[time=2472] And we grieve.
[time=2473] And we are angry.
[time=2477] And we want this to be different.
[time=2480] Well, we're going to do-- but sometimes we just need to-- I would do what I wish those guys would have done, just thought and said, wow, what a mess.
[time=2490] This isn't working.
[time=2492] This is misery.
[time=2494] Isn't there another way?
[time=2497] And God says there is.
[time=2499] There's another way.
[time=2502] Me.
[time=2503] My faithful, outstretched arms that are here for you still.
[time=2508] Cry out to me.
[time=2509] Well, they didn't.
[time=2514] And so they were judged.
[time=2515] They're sinned.
[time=2519] Now they're judgment.
[time=2520] Look at chapter 11.
[time=2523] They hung on to their anger.
[time=2526] They hung on to their hard and wandering hearts.
[time=2528] Look at Hosea 11, verses 1 to 7.
[time=2533] My Bible says, God yearns over his people.
[time=2535] And here you see again the heart of God stirred.
[time=2540] And in this case, it was too late.
[time=2541] When Israel was a youth-- you with me?
[time=2544] When Israel was a youth, I loved him.
[time=2546] And out of Egypt, I called my son.
[time=2550] The more they called them, the more they went from them.
[time=2553] They kept sacrificing to the bales and burning incense to idols.
[time=2557] Yet it is I who taught Ephraim to walk.
[time=2559] I took them in my arms, but they did not know that I had healed them.
[time=2562] I led them with cords of a man, with bonds of love.
[time=2566] And I became to them as one who lifts the yoke from their jaws.
[time=2570] And I, their God, their Father, I bent down and fed them.
[time=2576] But they will not return to the land of Egypt.
[time=2583] But Assyria, he will be their king.
[time=2586] Here comes the captivity we talked about before.
[time=2589] God's going to allow them to be overtaken.
[time=2591] God's going to allow moms and dads, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters to be torn from each other and taken to a place far away.
[time=2598] Well, they'll become slaves, mistreated and beaten.
[time=2601] They will not return to the land of Egypt.
[time=2603] But Assyria, he will be their king because they refused to return to me.
[time=2607] It's all they had to do.
[time=2609] It's all you've got to do.
[time=2610] It's all I've got to do is at some point in time put a stake in the ground and say, you know what?
[time=2615] It didn't work.
[time=2617] The lies that the enemy whispered in my ear, they weren't true.
[time=2621] And God, I need you.
[time=2622] And God, I'm sorry for my sin.
[time=2624] God, please forgive me for what I've done and where I've gone.
[time=2627] And please, God, have me back.
[time=2629] I am returning to you.
[time=2633] But they wouldn't return to me.
[time=2634] The sword will, verse 6.
[time=2635] The sword will whirl against their cities and will demolish the gate bars and consume them because of their counsel.
[time=2642] So my people are bent on turning from me, though they call them to the one on high, none at all exalts him.
[time=2650] None.
[time=2651] And so they were captured and it was dark and it was ugly
[time=2659] and it was hard and it was tumultuous.
[time=2662] Look what he says in verse 8.
[time=2667] Their restoration.
[time=2668] God is amazing, isn't he?
[time=2671] They finally cry for help and he answers.
[time=2676] You read through these verses and you realize God doesn't give up.
[time=2679] Constant quest has come.
[time=2681] Judgment sometimes is executed, but in the end, how can I look at verse 8?
[time=2684] How can I give you up?
[time=2686] Oh, Ephraim.
[time=2687] How can I surrender you?
[time=2688] Oh, Israel.
[time=2689] How can I make you like Edmah?
[time=2691] How can I treat you like Zaboyim?
[time=2693] My heart is turned over within me.
[time=2695] All my compassion's, not some.
[time=2697] All my compassion's are kindled.
[time=2700] I will not execute my fierce anger.
[time=2703] I will not destroy Ephraim again.
[time=2705] For I am God and not man.
[time=2707] The holy one in your midst.
[time=2710] And I will not come and wrath.
[time=2712] Wow.
[time=2715] They will walk after the Lord.
[time=2717] He will roar like a lion.
[time=2718] What a great picture.
[time=2719] Indeed, he will roar and his sons will come trembling from Assyria.
[time=2724] They will come trembling from the west.
[time=2727] They will come trembling like Gomer did to that block.
[time=2730] Like birds from Egypt and like doves from the land of Assyria
[time=2736] and I will settle them in their houses, declares the Lord.
[time=2740] An unfaithful people restored.
[time=2747] Their sin, their judgment and their restoration.
[time=2751] Now that's a lot I know in just a few minutes.
[time=2754] But that is the story of this great book, this book of Hosea in a nutshell.
[time=2759] But you see, we can't leave today.
[time=2762] I can't dare let you or I leave this place without some truth.
[time=2767] Some applications, some things for you and I to tonight and tomorrow and Tuesday, give ourselves to.
[time=2775] Consider and think about.
[time=2777] Talk to our kids about.
[time=2779] Discuss further in our small groups or accountability partners.
[time=2783] Here's some truth for you and I to just kind of hang on to.
[time=2787] Some things that you and I need to realize as we come from this story of Hosea.
[time=2791] And number one, write it down.
[time=2793] Please, you're gonna get a Gomer.
[time=2794] That's right.
[time=2796] You're gonna get a Gomer.
[time=2798] Why?
[time=2800] Because you know what, when I say Gomer in this, you might have an unfaithful spouse.
[time=2807] I mean, in the realistic sense and the literal sense what happened with Hosea and Gomer may happen to you.
[time=2815] But beyond the literal, you know what?
[time=2817] The pain and the difficulty and the challenge that this man faces as he experiences this with his wife, that same challenge, that same sense of you and I having to live life in a fallen world where test results aren't what we'd wish, where relationship sometimes goes south, where trust is from, you know what?
[time=2840] People, it's going to happen.
[time=2842] And sometimes you see you and I act surprised when it does.
[time=2848] Look what it says in first Peter.
[time=2850] Go back, if you would, to the back of your New Testament.
[time=2852] Would you go back to the book of first Peter, just after the book of James.
[time=2856] Go to first Peter, chapter four.
[time=2859] You see in first Peter four, Peter writes to a church that was right in the midst of severe persecution.
[time=2864] You see the church that existed in the time when Peter writes is the church that was being persecuted by Nero.
[time=2870] Nero was the guy who was having them beheaded.
[time=2872] Nero was the guy who was torturing families.
[time=2874] Nero was the guy who was having Christians thrown to lions.
[time=2877] Nero was the maniac dipping Christians in tar, tying them to sticks and lighting them as torches in his elaborate garden.
[time=2886] Nero was whacked and he was murdering Christians by the thousands and Peter writes in first Peter 4, 12, "Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery," I think he used the word purposely, "at the fiery ordeal among you, "which comes upon you for your testing, "as though some strange thing were happening to you." You know, we act like that sometimes.
[time=2915] Like, why in the world would this happen?
[time=2919] Well, why in the world wouldn't it?
[time=2925] In a world like this, in a fallen, cursed place that was broke from the day, I mean, John 1633, Jesus said, "In this world you will have tribulation." Back in first Peter two, just a couple chapters back, first Peter 2, 21, "For you have been called for this purpose," he says, "This is the purpose of your calling." To what?
[time=2953] Since Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example for you to follow, you and I have been called to suffer.
[time=2960] But we act like something must have, you know, no, you're gonna get a gomer.
[time=2967] Don't be surprised.
[time=2971] Hold on to him, second point, in the face of unfaithfulness, be faithful.
[time=2975] In the face of whatever unfaithfulness you might encounter, be faithful.
[time=2979] Please, what I mean by that is this, be faithful to who?
[time=2983] Please understand that Hosea in this unfolding story of Gomer and her adultery, she, he wasn't, I mean, yes, he extended forgiveness and he was faithful in the end to her, but understand that underlying all of that, Hosea was first and foremost faithful to who?
[time=3000] God.
[time=3001] You got a hard wife, you got a hard husband, you got a tough relationship, you got some difficult friendships, yes.
[time=3006] He calls you to respond appropriately, but that response is made possible because of your love and trust in God.
[time=3013] Not him, not her, not them.
[time=3016] Lastly, be careful who you identify with.
[time=3025] Be careful for the most effective, applicational benefit of today's message.
[time=3032] If you really want this stuff to sink in, if you really wanna leave this place today changed, be careful who you're sitting there in your seat right now, identifying with in this story, because I'll just, I'll raise my hand on this one.
[time=3046] When I read this story, I oftentimes quickly find myself identifying with who?
[time=3053] Hosea.
[time=3054] Well, I've been taking advantage of.
[time=3058] Yeah, I've been, I've been, she, I've been mistreated.
[time=3060] Well, you know what?
[time=3063] You're a, you're a gomer.
[time=3066] I'm a gomer.
[time=3069] Just face it.
[time=3070] You be honest with yourself.
[time=3076] You have enough integrity.
[time=3077] I'm gonna ask the guys to come on up now.
[time=3079] You have enough integrity in your heart today.
[time=3082] To just own up to the fact that you and I are a very, very unfaithful people at times.
[time=3089] And that unfaithfulness, that you and I exercise at times, it breaks the heart of God.
[time=3096] And yet again and again and again.
[time=3099] He extends to you and he extends to me.
[time=3102] Again and again and again.
[time=3103] He finds this up on the block, trembling, broken and done.
[time=3107] And he says, come on back and let me love you.
[time=3112] How do we get there?
[time=3113] We were talking about this a while ago as a team.
[time=3119] How do we get to these places of emptiness and despair, these places of futility?
[time=3128] You know, again, the enemy whispers.
[time=3130] Sometimes he screams in your ears and mind.
[time=3133] Life satisfaction is to be had over here.
[time=3137] Come over here, do this, do that.
[time=3139] Click on here, talk to him.
[time=3142] We do what Jeremiah talked about and Jeremiah too.
[time=3148] Be appalled, O heavens, at this and shudder.
[time=3152] Be very desolate, declares the Lord, for my people have committed two evils.
[time=3156] They have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters to hue, to dig for themselves cisterns, wells.
[time=3165] But they're broken.
[time=3168] The wells don't hold the water.
[time=3170] Broken cisterns that hold no water.
[time=3175] We run off to them, often.
[time=3180] And we find ourselves needing again to be reminded of the living water that only he provides.
[time=3184] We were talking about it as a team one day and I said to Corbin and Joshua, I think there might be something here.
[time=3190] I mean, think about it, you guys, maybe there's a song.
[time=3194] Well, they called me two hours later.
[time=3198] They said, "Hey, we got it." They said, "You got what?" They said, "The song." I said, "Wow, great, amazing." They came over and they played it for me and I couldn't wait for you to hear it today.
[time=3209] For you to hear the words that God speaks in Jeremiah.
[time=3214] There's a few other passages, Psalm 1.
[time=3216] You'll recognize many of the lyrics.
[time=3218] But listen, maybe close your eyes and be reminded today of the living water, the only thing that can satisfy.
[time=3227] You're soul and mine.
[time=3229] (upbeat music)
[time=3237] [MUSIC - 190 seconds]
[time=3430] - Why don't you stand, and as you stand
[time=3436] would you just close your eyes, and just stay with me here, think with me just for a moment.
[time=3445] You know, there's somebody in this room this morning, and you have gone a long, long way down a very, very dark road.
[time=3456] You've almost forgotten where you even started, what maybe initially went wrong, but you stand here this morning so far from God.
[time=3466] Confused and lost in a way, hurting, guilty,
[time=3473] maybe full of shame.
[time=3475] And if I could tell you one thing today, if God could say one thing, God would say, I think what He has said to you today through His Word, here I am, a faithful God who today still extends toward you, open arms,
[time=3494] a willingness to forgive, a willingness to make right, a willingness to make new, but you, whoever you are, as we saw there in the text, you must return.
[time=3506] And maybe again, there are some here today who were there and have walked away others if it may be for the very first time need to come to a loving God whose arms are open wide.
[time=3522] And what He would long for us for you to say,
[time=3528] and you can say this today right here, just in the quietness of your heart, you can just say these simple words that carry such great meaning.
[time=3539] You can say God in heaven, you are so good, and you are so great, and I am not.
[time=3551] God, I'm a sinner.
[time=3553] I'm so far from you, and I want nothing more today than to confess to you my sin, seek your forgiveness and come into a relationship with you, God, that would not only bring a cleansing to my soul, but meaning to my life.
[time=3572] God, forgive me, and bring me into a relationship with you.
[time=3579] God, thank you for your grace and your mercy.
[time=3586] God, thank you for loving me.
[time=3590] [AMEN]
[time=3596] (gentle music)
