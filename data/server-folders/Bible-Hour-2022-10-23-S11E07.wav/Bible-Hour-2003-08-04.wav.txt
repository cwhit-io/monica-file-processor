[time=303] We're bound in the desert place.
[time=307] Now I walk through the wilderness.
[time=311] Blessed be your name.

[time=373] On the road not with suffering.
[time=377] Though there's pain in the offering.
[time=381] Blessed be your name.

[time=508] 4,000.
[time=525] 4,000 times to sing.
[time=530] My great redeemer's face.
[time=535] The glory's love, my God, and King.
[time=540] The triumphs of his grace.
[time=547] My gracious master, and my God,
[time=553] assist me to proclaim.
[time=557] To spread through all the earth of Christ, the honors of thy name.
[time=569] Oh, to praise the greatest God.
[time=574] Oh, to sing of who you are.
[time=579] To proclaim your name of God, all of the God.
[time=588] He breaks the power of counsel sin.
[time=594] He sets the prisoner free.
[time=598] His blood can make the father's king.
[time=603] His blood avail for me.
[time=610] Oh, to praise the greatest God.
[time=615] Oh, to sing of who you are.
[time=620] To proclaim your name of God, all of the God.
[time=630] Oh, for a thousand times to sing.
[time=635] My great redeemer's praise.
[time=640] The glory's love, my God, and King.
[time=645] The triumphs of his grace.
[time=652] Oh, to praise the greatest God.
[time=657] Oh, to sing of who you are.
[time=662] To proclaim your name of God, all of the God.
[time=670] We will praise, we will praise the greatest God.
[time=676] We will sing of who you are.
[time=681] And we proclaim your name of God, all of the God.
[time=690] And we will praise the greatest God.
[time=695] We will sing of who you are.
[time=700] We proclaim your name of God, all of the God.
[time=737] And I'll let my words be here.
[time=746] Jesus, I am so young up with you.
[time=776] You are God in heaven, and here am my honor.
[time=790] So I'll let my words be here.
[time=800] Jesus, I am so young up with you.
[time=811] And I'll stand in awe of you.
[time=835] And I'll let my words be here.
[time=842] Jesus, I am so young up with you.
[time=862] So I'll let my words be here.
[time=884] Jesus, I am so in love with you.
[time=895] And I'll stand in awe of you.
[time=919] And I'll let my words be here.
[time=925] Jesus, I am so young up with you.
[time=940] And I'll stand in awe of you.
[time=960] And I'll let my words be here.
[time=966] Jesus, I am so in love with you.
[time=990] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=994] And I'm so grateful for what I get to do with my days, with my life.
[time=1000] I've told you this before, but I want to tell you again.
[time=1004] I counted a privilege to be able to do what I do, where I do it here at Black Hawk, with the people that I get to do it with.
[time=1011] And you know, when I meet you, when you say hello to me, out wherever it is that we bump into each other,
[time=1017] when I get your emails, when I read your letters, I am so grateful for the fact that with many of you,
[time=1023] even though we're together via television, it's almost as if you kind of view me as your pastor.
[time=1030] And I want you to know that not with just the people who are here in this place, but even with many of you who are out there.
[time=1038] And for whatever reasons, you know, you can't get here.
[time=1040] Or for whatever reasons, you haven't made the trip yet.
[time=1043] I'm so grateful that I get to, in some way, play that role with you.
[time=1049] I'm really thankful that I get to lead.
[time=1052] I'm thankful for the opportunity to teach.
[time=1055] But I think if you asked me to kind of tell you the one thing that I enjoy most about what I get to do, it's wrapped up in that word, "pastor." I get to be with people. I get to talk with people.
[time=1065] I get to do my very best with his help to come alongside.
[time=1068] And today, as Steve teaches us from the Scriptures about suffering,
[time=1074] as we learn more about the fact that this sovereign God does allow difficult things
[time=1081] to come into your life and mind. And he uses these difficult things.
[time=1085] He really does.
[time=1086] He uses them to not only grow us, but he uses them to advance his kingdom.
[time=1091] The good that comes from the sufferings we face.
[time=1096] Sometimes we don't even see it. Sometimes it takes place and sometimes it comes to fruition
[time=1102] in settings and in situations beyond what we ever get to see.
[time=1106] But the suffering comes. And there are times when we need each other in the midst of the difficulty. And so today I want to just say to you who are out there and the folks that I don't get to see every day, the people I don't get to come in contact with.
[time=1120] If you want to just send us an email, if you want to give us a call, if you want to write us a letter,
[time=1126] if you're going through something that really has been recently for you a difficult time,
[time=1132] a time where your faith has really been stretched, a time where your heart has really been heavy.
[time=1137] And if we could just pray for you, if we could just send you a note back, if there's anything that we could do to pastor you, to shepherd you, to care for you, we'd love to do that.
[time=1149] So take me up on it. We know that life can at times be dark.
[time=1154] There can be circumstances that we encounter that can really be discouraging and painful.
[time=1159] And we want to be the church for you. And so give us a call. Let us know how we can help.
[time=1166] Again, even if it's just to pray for you and to lift you up, we'd love to do it.
[time=1170] Thank you so much for being a part of this family, this place we call Black Hawk.
[time=1183] I'm tired. I'm not so good at this prayer thing. I might not be saying it right.
[time=1192] You know, it seems like I'm doing all the talking lately. Are you home?
[time=1198] Forget it. Please, don't answer that.
[time=1203] Yes. I know you are. But I am so tired.
[time=1213] I came in here with some things. I came in here with a lot. With a lot.
[time=1222] This one. This is doubt. Self-doubt. Faith-doubt.
[time=1229] Unlike the doubting Thomas, who wants to believe, I need some proof.
[time=1236] This one. This is the questions. You know them, the questions.
[time=1247] Will it be my job tomorrow? If not tomorrow, what about next week?
[time=1252] How do I make all these ends meet somewhere?
[time=1256] You promise to take these if I give them up to you.
[time=1260] Is that true? Is that really true?
[time=1273] This one. This is regret. Notice the size, the color.
[time=1283] This one is full of all the things I never should have done.
[time=1293] Words that cracked and broke relationships.
[time=1299] How do I let that go? I mean, what are you going to do with all my regret?
[time=1305] All my should-habs. Wood-habs. Good-habs. If only this. If only that.
[time=1314] If only this. These are all the broken items. All the broken things.
[time=1326] Dreams, hopes, friends, myself. All the broken things. I want them fixed.
[time=1342] Can I give this stuff to you? Or do I hold on to it myself?
[time=1350] If I never take a chance and pray, how am I going to know if you're going to answer?
[time=1355] Is there something that you want to say? Do you want to keep me from some disaster?
[time=1360] I want to make a wager of faith. I want to put my trust on the line.
[time=1365] So I'm going to open the door and pour my heart out to you.
[time=1370] Lord, if I open up and tell you everything that's on my mind.
[time=1375] How can I know for sure that you're going to give me a reply?
[time=1380] Lord, if I let it fly and open up the lines of communication.
[time=1385] Will there be miracles? Am I going to find you've been there all the time?
[time=1392] I'm all the time. I'm not going to say it right.
[time=1395] I know I'm not going to say it right. I don't know how to pray.
[time=1398] I'm not going to think about the punctuation. You already know it's going to be a big surprise.
[time=1403] You already know about my situation. I want to make a wager of faith.
[time=1409] I want to put my pride on the line. I'm not going to see the floor and pour my heart out to you.
[time=1417] But guys, I get mad. I get really mad. I cry. I doubt. I can't believe.
[time=1425] Are you big enough? Can I trust you?
[time=1428] Look, I don't know how to let go to release when I'm holding so tight.
[time=1434] Jump when I'm scared of midair. Can I be sure you're going to catch me?
[time=1439] If I'm really going to talk to you, if I open up my soul and I tell you what I'm feeling.
[time=1444] Are you really going to answer me? Are you going to show me something I'll be able to believe in?
[time=1449] I don't want to put you to the test, but I'm going to take a risk and I better have a reason.
[time=1454] Am I really going to hear from you? Are you going to show me something I'll be able to believe in?
[time=1460] I want to make a wager of faith. I want to put myself on the line.
[time=1465] So I'm going to open the door and pour my heart out to you.
[time=1470] I hope I'm not just talking to myself. If I come to you in need and I'm open to believe.
[time=1478] Will you speak to me? Show yourself to me, will you make it real?
[time=1483] I don't want to just play games. I don't want to stay the same.
[time=1488] When I talk to you, when I reach for you, when I call your name.
[time=1493] And if I come to you in need and I'm open to believe.
[time=1498] I don't want to be fake about it.
[time=1500] Show yourself to me, will you make it real?
[time=1502] I don't like it doubting times.
[time=1504] I don't want to just play games. I don't want to stay the same.
[time=1508] If I can only say to him, not to him, when I call your name.
[time=1513] I could be sure.
[time=1515] Okay.
[time=1524] I'm leaving these here with you.
[time=1530] I don't know how to move without them.
[time=1538] I don't want to move without you.
[time=1541] I was waiting for a helicopter rescue.
[time=1546] But I'll just wait for you.
[time=1552] However you come.
[time=1556] As you think through what you just saw and what you just heard,
[time=1567] with your heads bowed and hopefully your hearts just wide open to what the Spirit of God would want to say,
[time=1578] I would imagine that there are probably many in the room today and you know very well what it's like to have shoulders that are weary, to have hands that are tired, to have souls that have been dragged down by the luggage, the baggage, the burdens of life.
[time=1601] As Corbin mentioned earlier, sometimes life is really, really not only difficult but very, very confusing.
[time=1608] And so this morning, it would be our hope.
[time=1612] This morning it would be our desire that you, whoever you are, wherever you've been, that you would be willing to realize again today or maybe for the first time today that what was just portrayed,
[time=1629] that what was just said moments ago really is true.
[time=1634] He's there and he's been there all along.
[time=1637] And though that in itself can be confusing, he wants nothing more than for you to be able to take all of your regret and all of your shame and all of your doubt and all of your fear, all of your questions, and fully.
[time=1653] Not sort of, not kind of, but fully surrender them to him so that he can begin to move, so that he can begin to heal, so that he can begin to do his mighty work in your heart and in mine.
[time=1672] God, we come before you this morning of people who have been powerfully reminded of the fact that life in this fallen world,
[time=1684] life in this place that has been racked by sin, theirs and ours, God, life here can at times lead us down paths,
[time=1695] choices that we make can move us in directions so very, very far from you.
[time=1701] And God, those are lonely, difficult places to be.
[time=1705] And for those in the room this morning, God, who today walk closely with you, God, there are some tasting the goodness and the joy of life.
[time=1714] God, help us not to forget.
[time=1718] Help us not to, for a moment, forget those who might be struggling or the fact that we ourselves were there at one point.
[time=1727] God, for those who just kind of crawled in here this morning, feeling the weight of these very things, we pray that your word and we pray that your spirit and we pray, God, that your people would come alongside in powerful ways.
[time=1743] Teach us and grow us.
[time=1745] Help us realize in a clear and maybe fresh way that we can trust you.
[time=1752] In your son's name we pray. Amen.
[time=1762] Well, we are going to this morning continue with this theme that's been established.
[time=1771] We are going to in the next several weeks just do our very best to go to the Word of God
[time=1778] and talk about and look for ourselves and see what the Scriptures teach us as it relates to suffering.
[time=1786] Recently, as we've been making our way through the minor prophets, we've seen the fact that difficult and challenging, sometimes even confusing, things happened to certain people, thinking about Hosea even last week.
[time=1801] We hear from you often, we hear things from those that watch the Bible hour.
[time=1806] We get emails and questions at the website.
[time=1809] People often wanting to understand more about this thing called suffering and how suffering fits with this loving God who's in control,
[time=1820] in charge in a sense we've been taught, you know.
[time=1824] And so Steve, long break and Mitch Cruz are teaching pastors and myself.
[time=1829] We've just been thinking about this for a while and we've been working with our programming team and we want to do our very best to look up at and give some thought to God.
[time=1840] His sovereignty, it's a big word and if you don't understand it, it's okay.
[time=1845] We'll explain it to you here in a second.
[time=1848] God, His sovereignty and suffering.
[time=1854] And how in the world all of that together makes sense.
[time=1860] And if you've been walking with the Lord for any length of time, you know that there are times when we can't always make sense of it all from our human perspectives, but boy, the word of God brings great insight and helps us understand better how we should respond and how we should view these things.
[time=1879] Let's start, if we can, by just talking a little bit about this idea of God and His sovereignty.
[time=1887] The sovereignty of God.
[time=1889] Just as we start here, if you want to get a pin out, that'd be great.
[time=1892] If you want to just write this down, let me just read this to you.
[time=1896] It's a definition of God's sovereignty.
[time=1898] Then we're going to look at some verses that kind of give some light to that.
[time=1903] The sovereignty of God, His possession.
[time=1906] I think it says it there on the screen.
[time=1908] His possession of the supreme and highest power.
[time=1912] Scripture teaches that God in God alone is in possession of the supreme and highest power.
[time=1918] He is the supreme and highest power.
[time=1920] The sovereignty of God is His absolute dominion.
[time=1923] And I would even add the word loving rule overall.
[time=1927] Does it always seem like that no?
[time=1931] But the fact of the matter is because God is who God is.
[time=1935] His rule is loving.
[time=1937] His absolute dominion and loving rule overall.
[time=1941] Look at Romans.
[time=1942] Go ahead and open your Bible to your New Testament.
[time=1944] Go to the book of Romans.
[time=1946] Romans 9.
[time=1949] In Romans chapter 9 we see Paul's talking about God's dealing with the nation of Israel.
[time=1955] And we get a great glimpse of His sovereignty.
[time=1958] The sovereignty of God.
[time=1961] He says to Moses in Romans 9, 15, for He says to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy.
[time=1969] And I will have compassion on whom I have compassion." That's God.
[time=1974] He decides.
[time=1975] He chooses.
[time=1976] And it does not depend on the man who wills or the man who runs, but on God who has mercy.
[time=1983] It goes on in verse 17 to say, "For the Scriptures say to Pharaoh." Don't miss that.
[time=1989] For the Scriptures say to Pharaoh, "For this very purpose I raised you up to demonstrate
[time=1996] my power in you, God's power, demonstrated through Pharaoh.
[time=2001] And that my name, God's name, might be proclaimed throughout the whole earth.
[time=2007] So then he has mercy on whom he desires and he hardens whom he desires.
[time=2013] God, lovingly, perfectly, doing, moving, choosing, seeing things take place.
[time=2022] And not one single thing slips by.
[time=2027] Although it seems that way at times.
[time=2030] God in His sovereignty lovingly, mercifully, with justice in consistent fashion with all
[time=2040] of His attributes does what God does.
[time=2042] Look at Isaiah.
[time=2043] This won't be on the screen, but go back to Isaiah.
[time=2046] Understand again the kind of God that we have.
[time=2049] The power, the supreme power.
[time=2053] Go to Isaiah 40, Isaiah 40 verse 12, paints a great picture of this sovereign God, this
[time=2064] powerful God, this mighty God.
[time=2068] Who has measured, Isaiah says, "The waters in the hollow of His hand," we've talked about this before.
[time=2074] All the waters, Isaiah refers to there.
[time=2077] All the waters of the earth, who measures them in the hollow of His hand and who marked off the heavens by a span, the length between the thumb and the end of the forefinger there.
[time=2088] That's the span.
[time=2089] That was a unit of measurement back in those days.
[time=2091] And Isaiah talks about how God has marked off the heavens by the span and calculated
[time=2097] the dust of the earth by the measure and weighed the mountains in a balance and the hills in a pair of scales.
[time=2104] I love that.
[time=2107] With whom did He consult, verse 14, with whom did He consult, and who gave Him understanding?
[time=2115] And who taught Him in the path of justice and taught Him knowledge?
[time=2119] Like in verse 15, "Behold, the nations are like a drop from a bucket and are regarded as a speck of dust on the scales."
[time=2130] Go back to Psalm.
[time=2131] Go back a few books.
[time=2132] Go back to Psalm 89.
[time=2137] Just be reminded of the sovereign power, the sovereign insight, the sovereign ability that only He has to rule, to lead, to guide, to Psalm 89.
[time=2151] It says there in Psalm 89, verse 8, Psalm 89, "O Lord of Host, who is like you, O Lord
[time=2172] God of Host, who is like you, O mighty Lord, your faithfulness also surrounds you.
[time=2177] You rule the swelling of the sea.
[time=2179] When its waves rise, you still them.
[time=2182] You yourself crushed Rahab, like one who is slain.
[time=2185] You scattered your enemies with your mighty arm, the heavens are yours.
[time=2189] The earth also is yours, the world, and all it contains.
[time=2195] You have founded them." Go back one more book to Job.
[time=2200] Just look at this real quick.
[time=2201] Job 38, I believe is where it is.
[time=2205] Job's questioning the sovereignty of God.
[time=2209] Job, if you're familiar at all with the story, has been through a great deal.
[time=2212] It's been very confusing.
[time=2214] It's been very painful.
[time=2215] It's been very unsettling.
[time=2216] In the end, Job just kind of in a fit of frustrations, he says, "You know what?
[time=2219] I'm not so sure.
[time=2221] You know what's going on." God replies in Job 38, look at verse 4, hold on, he says, "Where were you, Job 38 for?
[time=2229] Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?
[time=2233] Tell me if you have understanding.
[time=2235] Who set its measurements, since you know, or who stretched the line on it?
[time=2240] On what were its bases sunk, or who laid its cornerstone when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy?" Like a verse 12, "If you ever in your life commanded the morning," that's what God does.
[time=2259] He's that sovereign.
[time=2260] He's that powerful.
[time=2262] He's that big.
[time=2263] Have you ever in your life commanded the morning and caused the dawn to know its place?
[time=2272] So we have a sovereign God who is that big and has his arms around all of that.
[time=2284] And yet we have this life, this life of yours and this life of mine and this life that Tanya
[time=2291] just so powerfully portrayed.
[time=2294] And any time you start trying to think through the fact that really, really terrible things
[time=2300] happen, decisions get made and people get scarred, choices are made and families get
[time=2307] disintegrated, things are perpetrated upon young boys and young girls and their lives
[time=2314] are never the same, mothers get diagnosed with cancer, dads die too soon, I mean it just
[time=2321] keeps going.
[time=2323] And any time you and I begin to think through how it is that those things can be a reality and that this loving God who has our best interest at heart, who is sovereign overall,
[time=2336] how these two things come together oftentimes leaves you and me just scratching our heads
[time=2343] and it moves us oftentimes into a discussion.
[time=2346] And we want to have this discussion this morning.
[time=2349] It moves us into a discussion of the will, the will of God.
[time=2355] You hear that phrase and I hear that phrase often, God's will.
[time=2360] Is it God's will that certain things happen?
[time=2362] Is it God's will that this gets done?
[time=2365] God's will can sometimes just like God's sovereignty be a very confusing thing and so we want to do our best this morning to just introduce you or remind you to some things about the will of God that will then form a foundation for our study and our look at God, his sovereignty and suffering, understanding better the will of God, okay?
[time=2385] We're going to jump in here, I'm going to just start us off.
[time=2387] There's three main pictures that we want to show you today, three words that are used
[time=2393] often in the scriptures for the will of God and we've just tried to define them in a way and we're going to show you some examples of these things in a way that we hope will make some sense.
[time=2403] Let's start with the first one, understanding God's will.
[time=2407] First we have his absolute will.
[time=2414] With his absolute will, we want you to understand this, there are some things in life, there are some things in this world as God moves and as God chooses.
[time=2422] There are some things that are just going to happen.
[time=2425] There are no choices, you can write that down.
[time=2429] There are no choices to be made that affect God's absolute will.
[time=2436] The next bullet says it just kind of plainly for you.
[time=2439] With his absolute will, he has declared it and it will happen.
[time=2443] Do you understand that?
[time=2444] There are some things in this life, there are some things under his, they're just going to happen.
[time=2450] Look at Galatians.
[time=2451] Go to Galatians chapter 1, it says in Galatians chapter 1 there and we could give you four
[time=2457] or five or six other passages that say this very thing.
[time=2461] This would just be an example of his absolute will.
[time=2465] It was the absolute will of God who gave himself for our sins so that he might rescue
[time=2471] us from this present evil age according to the will of God, according to the will of
[time=2478] our God and Father.
[time=2480] Do you understand that?
[time=2481] The will of God our Father was to give Jesus Christ his son to be the one who would rescue
[time=2489] you and I from our sin.
[time=2492] God chose before the foundations of the earth that that's the way that was going to be and there isn't anything that anybody was going to do to change that.
[time=2502] Absolute.
[time=2503] No choices.
[time=2504] It's going to happen.
[time=2505] Genesis 1 in the beginning, God what?
[time=2508] In the beginning, God what?
[time=2510] He created.
[time=2511] He was going to do it.
[time=2513] Nothing anybody was going to, I guess there wasn't anybody there to disagree.
[time=2516] But you get the idea?
[time=2518] The absolute will of God.
[time=2520] It's going to happen.
[time=2521] There's no choices.
[time=2522] He declared it.
[time=2523] It's going to be the absolute will of God and when you go on from there to what, Mitch?
[time=2529] The approved will of God.
[time=2532] If the absolute will of God, it's his design.
[time=2536] The approved will of God would be his desire, his desire.
[time=2543] It's an impression upon me to be moved in the way he wants to move me.
[time=2549] He has that right as God and to impress on my heart and I think he does it generally
[time=2555] and he does it specifically if you want to write that down.
[time=2558] He does it generally and he does it specifically and in the approval of God are many choices.
[time=2565] There are many choices, all of which are acceptable to him.
[time=2570] But there are many choices in the approval of God.
[time=2573] Generally, they're all predicated on this though, generally.
[time=2578] The general response to his approved will is that I would humble my heart to him and fully surrender my life to him, my mind, my will, my emotions, my spirit.
[time=2588] I make it clay in his hands.
[time=2590] I allow him to be the potter and my heart to be the clay and I quit trying to be God of my own life, receiving his forgiveness and his lordship.
[time=2598] That's his general approved will, that's the intention of God.
[time=2603] Second Peter 3.9 says it's not God's will that anyone should perish but all would come to that humble heart, to that repentance.
[time=2610] He desires that.
[time=2611] Is that going to happen with everybody?
[time=2613] I think Scripture is pretty clear in 27 books in the New Testament, 234 times it talks
[time=2619] about hell.
[time=2621] So it's probably not God's absolute will that everybody's going to heaven, but his desire
[time=2627] is approved will and he's just because he's drawn us all to himself.
[time=2631] You never lock eyes with someone who doesn't matter to God.
[time=2635] Then specifically, specifically through spiritual gifts, God can use me, specifically he can
[time=2644] use me to lead or to teach or to offer mercy or hospitality or to proclaim the Word of
[time=2653] God.
[time=2654] He's designed each one of us as a unique spiritual gifts package, able to be tapped in to the
[time=2661] Spirit of God at any time in his approved will.
[time=2665] The Holy Spirit's available to us all the time and each one of us is a unique package.
[time=2669] Each one of us is a minister.
[time=2672] The Bible is so clear about this.
[time=2674] Each one of you has your own ministry and with every person you encounter, every day, that's church, that's the kingdom of God and God's used you and designed you and brought you on to this scene of events for you to operate in his approved will, both generally and specifically.
[time=2689] If you want to look at Romans 12, this is really a good place and this is getting into the discussion of spiritual gifts.
[time=2695] So it's really interesting.
[time=2697] Romans 12, 2 says, "And do not be conformed to this world.
[time=2702] So don't let this world, don't let that which is opposed to God cosmos, squeeze and mold
[time=2708] you and shape your clay heart." Don't do that.
[time=2714] But be transformed, let the fingerprints of God show through you and his approved will by the renewing of your mind so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which
[time=2726] is good and acceptable and perfect, that which is approved.
[time=2730] So often referred to as his perfect will.
[time=2732] My wife, when I was having this discussion with her this week about these three concepts of God's will, said, "Well, which one do I pray for?" It's this one.
[time=2743] Prayer is actually humbling my heart to God, surrendering my heart to God and saying, "God, you know, change me.
[time=2749] God put me as clay in your hands.
[time=2753] Mold me and shape me." Generally with my heart to be fully surrendered to you specifically on however you want me to do it, God asked Abraham to go.
[time=2760] He impressed on his spirit to go.
[time=2761] He impressed on Jonah to go.
[time=2765] God is impressing on you to go.
[time=2768] And he has a specific purpose for your life.
[time=2771] There are many choices on how you get there.
[time=2774] But God is impressing on your heart and your spirit with his approved will.
[time=2780] Unapproved, approved, and the third one allowable.
[time=2788] He allows us to make some choices that sometimes have some really bad consequences.
[time=2796] And in some ways, I wish I could kind of move through life just being the puppet on
[time=2803] a string that some people think we are.
[time=2808] That God is just up there moving us through life.
[time=2812] He's orchestrated every event and I'm a puppet.
[time=2818] But I don't think the Scripture teaches that.
[time=2821] And if we look at his sovereignty, certainly it totally overshadows all of the choices
[time=2832] that we can make and ultimately his sovereign absolute will is coming to fruition.
[time=2841] But we see many places in Scripture where we have opportunities to choose.
[time=2847] The nation of Israel as a type for the church.
[time=2851] The nation of Israel, we see them making choices often that really cause some bad consequences.
[time=2858] And it says many times in the Old Testament that their actions caused God to be angry
[time=2865] and he therefore gave them consequences.
[time=2869] He allowed them to make choices.
[time=2871] He allows me to make choices like that too.
[time=2873] Now within his approved will are many choices that we saw there.
[time=2878] But think of this allowable will as all of those on one side versus these other choices
[time=2887] that he has also given us the freedom to make that our sin contrary to him.
[time=2895] In Numbers chapter 11, it says the nation of Israel says there were some grumblers.
[time=2904] In the NIV it calls them the rabble of the crowd.
[time=2909] And they were tired of manna and it says the rabble craved meat and it didn't take long.
[time=2920] Everybody started to crave meat and they started to remember back.
[time=2923] Remember when we had fish and meat when we were in Egypt?
[time=2928] That was better than this.
[time=2930] Now they grumbled like this before they got the manna in the first place remember.
[time=2935] We used to get food back there and now they're craving meat rather than manna which God
[time=2941] had provided for them.
[time=2943] Remember manna?
[time=2944] What is it?
[time=2945] They called it.
[time=2946] That was the name.
[time=2947] Manna means what is it?
[time=2948] And God had provided them something that was really nourishing and they could gather every day, six days and they gathered twice as much on the day before the Sabbath.
[time=2959] And so God, Moses went to God and said these people, I need help.
[time=2963] They're complaining, they're grumbling and craving meat.
[time=2968] And he said I need some help here God.
[time=2971] They're turning against me like they did often.
[time=2973] And he asked for elders and God gave him some elders.
[time=2977] And then he gave them meat.
[time=2979] He had quail made available to them and they gathered it but this is what he said.
[time=2985] He said I'm going to satisfy your craving but I want you to know this.
[time=2989] You're choosing outside what I've planned for you.
[time=2993] And it says in Numbers 11 as before they could get all the meat out of their teeth.
[time=3001] Some of them were cursed with a plague because God in his anger was bringing a plague down
[time=3007] on them.
[time=3008] Folks there are some unbelievable consequences that we suffer.
[time=3013] If we make choices outside what he's already declared to be true for us, there are some
[time=3019] natural consequences and sometimes there are God intervenes and ordained some consequences
[time=3027] that are incredible and you see it often in here.
[time=3030] Why would you assume that doesn't exist anymore?
[time=3034] But we live like that.
[time=3037] Are you the rabble?
[time=3040] Are you part of the people that continually crave what he said we should not have out here?
[time=3046] He says we can have many choices and the approved will of God.
[time=3050] We need to make our choices there.
[time=3054] Are you a rabble or are you obedient?
[time=3059] Great question.
[time=3063] Mitch, share with the folks about the garden, how we see in the garden all three of these
[time=3074] wills of God being played out.
[time=3078] First of all, when you see these three wills of God, what you see is a relationship not religion.
[time=3084] It's relationship and not religion.
[time=3086] If I'm unique, therefore my relationship with God will be unique.
[time=3090] This is based on relationship, not religion.
[time=3093] God is not a cookie cutter God where you can just line them up and say this is the way it is.
[time=3098] You just can't do that.
[time=3099] I can't peruse the mind of God and say, oh, this is how he works.
[time=3102] And we're not carving up God here, we're talking about a relational loving God.
[time=3106] And God is love and therefore out of love, he creates.
[time=3109] So we go to the Garden of Eden and God creates in his ultimate will, he creates nobody like
[time=3115] Kelly Red, nobody told God how to make the sun, the stars, the moon, the land, the vegetation,
[time=3121] the fish, the birds, nobody.
[time=3124] Nobody told God how to make man.
[time=3127] That's God's absolute will, his design.
[time=3132] In the Garden of Eden, God says in his approved will to Adam and Eve, eat from any tree in
[time=3139] the garden, eat from any tree in the garden.
[time=3143] We have a lot of choices here, go for it, name the animals, you know, he impresses on
[time=3152] them with his desire, be in community, be fruitful, be multiplying.
[time=3157] But then you see the allowable or the permissive will of God, eat any tree but one.
[time=3167] Because he is love to have integrity, to have righteousness to be just, he has to allow me to love him back and to allow me to love him back, I have to have the opportunity to not love him back.
[time=3178] It's not God's approved will that I should eat of that tree, but he allows it.
[time=3186] And then they do, and all you know what breaks loose, and that's the problem, Genesis 3.
[time=3195] That's the problem.
[time=3196] That's why there is suffering of the kind that we experience today.
[time=3200] And you see those three wills again and again and again through Scripture, especially at the cross of Christ.
[time=3205] God's ultimate will is Kelly Red from Galatians 1-4, that Christ is the only way and God himself
[time=3211] is on the cross.
[time=3212] That is the absolute will of God.
[time=3215] He said what he had to say to get there, he didn't say what didn't need to be said to get there.
[time=3221] But on one side is a thief, and that thief responds to the approved will of God.
[time=3229] This is in Luke 23 I think.
[time=3233] He recognizes who he is and he surrenders to him, he says, "You know you are who you say you are." And Jesus says to him in that approved will and response, "Today you'll be with me in paradise but then on the other side." There's a thief in that permissive or that allowable will of God and he says this is ridiculous.
[time=3252] He hardens his heart, heart of stone and the permissive will of God and the allowable will
[time=3259] of God.
[time=3260] He says no to God.
[time=3261] And we see it again and again and again and we see it today.
[time=3268] So three things just out of the gate here.
[time=3270] We've got the absolute will of God.
[time=3273] You're pretty clear on that.
[time=3275] No choices.
[time=3276] You don't affect it.
[time=3277] He said it.
[time=3278] It's going to happen and it does.
[time=3280] It's always been that way.
[time=3282] There's the allowable, excuse me, the acceptable, the approved will of God.
[time=3287] Many choices, like Mitch said in the garden, you got all these trees.
[time=3290] Go ahead and choose one.
[time=3292] Whatever you choose there within the prescribed parameters of what I've given you is going to be okay.
[time=3297] The approved will of God and then we have the allowable.
[time=3301] And really for the sake of our discussion in the coming weeks you just can take those top two away because it's this idea of his allowable will.
[time=3312] The fact that he gave this humanity a choice and we chose sin.
[time=3320] And because we chose sin then, Genesis 3, unspeakable evil takes place.
[time=3333] And it impacts you and it impacts me and we see it in this fallen world.
[time=3338] And sometimes when that evil, sometimes when that sin, sometimes when the fallenness of this place comes into your life in mind, we sit back, we cry out as again, Tanya was doing
[time=3352] this morning.
[time=3353] You know, God, where'd you go?
[time=3354] God, how in the world could this have God?
[time=3357] And if we could just, with this idea of his allowable will, if we could just remind you of one thing today, if there's just one thing that you kind of take away from this as we continue this study and discussion, it's not God's fault.
[time=3371] This unspeakable evil, these things that take place, don't for a moment think that that's
[time=3377] what God intended.
[time=3379] Don't think for a moment, don't see him for an instant as the author of evil, no.
[time=3386] Because he was a loving God and gave us a choice and we chose sin, we've got a fallen world.
[time=3392] Now in the midst of this fallenness, in the midst of his allowable will, he chooses to walk us through, growing and shaping and encouraging and healing.
[time=3403] And that's a challenging road and we'll talk about that, we'll study about that in the days to come.
[time=3409] It's not God's fault, trust him, he's trustworthy.
[time=3414] And in the midst of the suffering that we face, even though he's sovereign, in the midst of the suffering that we face, there are things for you and I to learn, things for us to take home.
[time=3424] Come back, join us next week and be a part of this study, God, His sovereignty and our
[time=3431] suffering.
[time=3432] Let's stand and pray.
[time=3437] Father, we stand before you this morning, again, many of us here in the room with heavy
[time=3443] hearts.
[time=3444] There are things that have transpired in our own lives and years gone by, maybe in months
[time=3450] gone by.
[time=3451] There are things that just happened yesterday and we're struggling to understand how it
[time=3458] is that we can follow you, how it is that we can trust you, how it is that a God like you would allow something like this and God, our prayer today is that as we look to your
[time=3470] Word and as we see in Scripture, your heart and what it was you desired, we realize, God, that these things we face today are the result, not of you, but God, they are the result of
[time=3482] an enemy.
[time=3483] They are the result of a fallenness that every one of us not only experiences but has within
[time=3492] us.
[time=3493] And so God, as we work to move through that, as we work to understand better how it is that in the midst of suffering, we can trust and love and give ourselves to a sovereign God, we pray you would make that clear.
[time=3506] And God where forgiveness needs to take place, God, give us the strength to grant it, God where healing needs to take place, God, we pray that your hand would do it, that your
[time=3516] spirit would accomplish it.
[time=3518] God, I pray as we leave this place that many of us here today would leave with our baggage
[time=3524] on the ground and that we might know what it means to really walk out these doors today
[time=3530] and into this life that you've given us, God, without that weight and without that burden simply looking to you, simply holding on tightly to the three things that you've given
[time=3543] us to face each and every day, the Word of God and the Spirit of God and the people of God.
[time=3549] We thank you for those things.
[time=3552] Bring us back together again soon in your son's name we pray, amen.
[time=3560] Thank you.
[time=3561] Have a great day.
[time=3590] [end]
