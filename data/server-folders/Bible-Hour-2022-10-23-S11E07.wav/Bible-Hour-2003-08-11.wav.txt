[time=1105] My wife came home from work one day and told me that she was moving out. She said she had fallen in love with her boss and wanted to be with him. I was devastated. I hated her. And I decided to get back at her by living a fast life, you know, wine women and song. But no matter how many women, how much wine or how many songs I filled myself up with, I couldn't catch that hole. And I decided to get back at her by living a fast life, you know, wine women and song. But no matter how many women, how much wine or how many songs I filled myself up with, I couldn't patch that hole. And I decided to get back at her by living a fast life, you know, wine women and song. But no matter how many
[time=1136] songs I filled myself up with, I couldn't patch that hole in my heart. A year ago, I became a Christian. Now, I still hated my ex, still had that hole in my heart, but, you know, I was a Christian. And one day I was reading Psalm 130. If you, O Lord, kept a record of sin, so Lord, who could stand? But with you, there is forgiveness.
[time=1163] Wow. My name is Bob Jackson, and I'm just like you. I know that real love forgives.
[time=1193] I love the words, and the funny thing is, it's okay. The last thing I need is to be heard, but to hear what you would say.
[time=1214] The word of God speak and you pour down my cream, washing my eyes to see, your Majesty, to be still and know that you're in this place.
[time=1234] Please let me stay in rest in your holiness, love God speak.
[time=1254] I'm finding myself in the midst of you, beyond the music, beyond the noise, and all that I need is to be with you, and in the quiet.
[time=1280] And hear your voice, the word of God speak, to pour down my cream, washing my eyes to see, your Majesty, to be still and know that you're in this place.
[time=1302] Please let me stay in rest in your holiness, word of God speak and you pour down my cream, washing my eyes to see, your Majesty, to be still and know that you're in this place.
[time=1329] Please let me stay in rest in your holiness.
[time=1339] I'm finding myself at a loss for words, and the funny thing is, it's okay.
[time=1360] Let's pray that that would be the case.
[time=1369] Lord, as Corbin and those guys saying, word of God speak, and we want desperately to hear from you.
[time=1375] Lord, you know everything about us, and you can speak to the issues that others don't even know about.
[time=1386] And I would pray that today, this morning, your words would come out of these pages and be a life for people and hope.
[time=1397] And Lord, our hope is in you and you alone. In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=1405] Well, we're for three weeks looking at God's sovereignty and his will.
[time=1414] And last week, we looked at three different aspects of the will of God.
[time=1421] I was obvious to me that there was a lady that was not in the will of God this morning. I was following a line of traffic on Trio Road on my way here.
[time=1432] And it was slow, I mean really slow, and I thought something is wrong and I really wondered what the trouble was.
[time=1442] And when I finally got to the front of the thing, I realized the real problem was there was somebody who had the audacity to drive under the speed limit.
[time=1452] And I don't know what was wrong with her, but that's ridiculous, and we all know that.
[time=1458] And I found myself back there, I wanted to get to church, I wanted to be a little early, and I found myself back there, frustrated about this person.
[time=1466] And I realized what I got up there, they were driving under this, they were driving less than 35 miles per hour.
[time=1479] And it grabbed me, I thought. The frustration that you felt back there was somebody that was doing something way within the approved will of God.
[time=1493] Way within. And here I am frustrated with them.
[time=1498] Let's review for a minute what we looked at last week, Russell Russell Mitchell.
[time=1503] (Laughter)
[time=1509] That's funny. Mitchell, you don't look like him, you don't sound like him.
[time=1515] Mitchell and Kelly and I were talking about God's sovereignty and his will.
[time=1525] And the Bible doesn't really list it this way, but we decided that we discovered some things in the Bible as we looked at it.
[time=1531] He has some absolute will. There are things that won't ever change.
[time=1535] Let's see the definition, in God's case, we have no choice in this whatsoever.
[time=1541] His absolute will are the things he has set in place that will come about no matter what anybody chooses.
[time=1549] No choice in it whatsoever. He has declared it, it will happen.
[time=1554] He said, for instance, the earth and heavens both are going to burn up in the future.
[time=1561] I don't care what we do, that's going to happen. We can save every tree, it's still going to burn.
[time=1567] Someday. And there's his approved will.
[time=1571] Within parameters, he has given us choices.
[time=1576] And we have lots of choices we can make. We can eat the things we choose, we can wear the things we choose, we can drive, we can live in.
[time=1583] We can date, we can do all kinds of things. Within his approved will, many choices, he will bless and honor choices made within his parameters.
[time=1594] We have a lot of freedom to choose in there.
[time=1597] And then thirdly, there's his allowed will.
[time=1600] We said, here are the approved will items. Then outside the approved will, we also have the freedom to choose things that are outside his approved will.
[time=1611] And there are consequences that come with those.
[time=1614] Sometimes we suffer the consequences. Sometimes we inflict consequences on other people when we choose to sin.
[time=1623] Make choices outside the approved will of God.
[time=1627] But he allows us to do that. His allowed will obey and follow him, disobey and rebel against him.
[time=1635] And there are consequences.
[time=1639] I pray and have prayed for our kids for years.
[time=1645] I remember, I used to pray when Josh and Steph were little, and I just begged God, please God.
[time=1652] Don't let me be the person that would prohibit them from walking in your truth and in your light.
[time=1660] Please draw them to you, no matter.
[time=1663] And we'd say, no matter what it takes, their mom and I would just beg him.
[time=1668] And when she had cancer and she was sick, I remember her saying to me one time, Do you think God's answered our prayers?
[time=1675] Do you think he has brought this suffering into our children's lives so that they'll become who he wants him to be?
[time=1684] And my response was, I don't know, maybe he did.
[time=1687] And I say that prayer now and I'll pray and I catch myself and I'll say, Lord, please draw Brian and Abigail and Earl and Josh and Steph to yourself and please God.
[time=1697] And sometimes when I say it, I'll even interrupt it and I'll say, please don't make it so hard.
[time=1704] Because I know suffering is often how he grows us up.
[time=1710] The Bible's clear.
[time=1712] I don't like suffering.
[time=1714] When I'm going through suffering, it doesn't feel good.
[time=1717] There's nothing about it that makes me happy.
[time=1722] But he says he'll mature us through that process that we can suffer.
[time=1728] So here's some news for you.
[time=1732] Suffering is on the way in your life.
[time=1740] Some of you have experienced it already.
[time=1742] It takes lots of different forms.
[time=1744] Some of you have experienced suffering because you have been abused, used in childhood as a wife, as a husband.
[time=1755] Sometimes as a parent, abused by children, I've seen that.
[time=1761] Some of you have been in relationships that were so hard that every single day it was difficult just to stay in it.
[time=1773] Sometimes there are health issues that bring about suffering.
[time=1780] Sometimes God just chooses to grow us up and discipline us and he brings suffering into our lives.
[time=1791] But it's on the way.
[time=1793] Don't be surprised.
[time=1795] In 1 Peter, Peter says, "Dear friends, do not be surprised at the painful trial you are suffering as though something strange were happening to you.
[time=1806] But rejoice that you participate in the sufferings of Christ so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed."
[time=1814] My question for you today is have you been suffering for Christ?
[time=1820] It's not very often for me that I actually experience persecution because of my Christianity.
[time=1830] Peter said, "Don't consider it strange when you do." So I'm saying, "Why isn't that happening more often in my life?" He said earlier in chapter 2 of 1 Peter, he says, "We are strangers and aliens in this world.
[time=1848] When you're a stranger and an alien, you then get persecuted.
[time=1852] Maybe the reason I'm not experiencing persecution at the level that I think I should is that maybe I'm not such a stranger in this world.
[time=1864] Maybe I have my feet planted in the conforming pattern of this world system, and so people don't see me as a stranger."
[time=1875] That's something this week that I didn't like thinking about.
[time=1879] Maybe I'm so comfortable in the system that they don't even know I'm a stranger to it.
[time=1889] The disciples suffered great persecution.
[time=1895] They didn't leave the arena of their life that they'd grown up in.
[time=1900] They suffered it right there.
[time=1904] Why don't I? Maybe I'm not bold.
[time=1909] Maybe I'm not willing to sacrifice the comfort of this world and what the system gives me.
[time=1919] So I continue to conform to the patterns of this world rather than being renewed transformed, it says, by the renewing of my mind there in Romans 12.
[time=1929] Maybe that's my problem.
[time=1932] John 16 says a similar kind of thing.
[time=1935] John 1633, we'll see that on the slide, please.
[time=1940] "I have told you these things so that in me you may have peace," he says.
[time=1947] This is Jesus talking to his disciples in John 16.
[time=1951] In this world you will have trouble.
[time=1954] Not you might have some, so get ready because maybe something's going to take place.
[time=1958] Jesus said, "In this world you will have trouble," but take heart.
[time=1965] You can have hope.
[time=1968] "I have overcome the world." Now, we're going to experience troubles while we're in this world.
[time=1977] And he says to his disciples, "Don't think it's weird, it's going to be a reality, they will come."
[time=1983] And he doesn't say, "And because I've overcome the world, they'll be brief."
[time=1989] He just says, "Take heart, I've overcome all that." When you're finished with that, know this, I've overcome it, there's something beyond that.
[time=2002] Hope in Christ.
[time=2004] In this world there will be trouble.
[time=2007] Suffering results from me making bad choices sometimes.
[time=2015] Others making bad choices that affect me.
[time=2019] That part I just hate.
[time=2022] I don't mind suffering consequences when I've caused it.
[time=2027] When I think about the consequences, the pain that I have caused other people in my bad choices.
[time=2033] If I let my mind go back in the past to think about who suffered because I chose to operate outside the parameters that God established as his approved will.
[time=2044] When I think about the way they have suffered, and then when I think, I don't even know what kind of suffering has transpired as that trickled down effect, that multiplication effect.
[time=2054] I don't know what's happened there.
[time=2056] I don't know for you guys. A lot of you have hurt because other people have just disobeyed God and they've hurt you.
[time=2065] And I hate that.
[time=2067] And I wonder why God, why don't you just shut it all down?
[time=2072] Why don't you stop this? I don't want one more child to suffer the abuse that they suffer from parents who are operating outside God's will.
[time=2083] And he says, "My ways are not your ways, and my thoughts aren't your thoughts."
[time=2091] You see, I have this linear thinking, and I think everything is a cause and effect, and a cause and effect.
[time=2097] And if I just get everybody to make the right choices, eventually these things will come true and everybody will be happy and there will be real comfort and peace.
[time=2104] God doesn't think that way.
[time=2106] God has a plan that includes suffering, bringing people to himself and growing them up.
[time=2113] Sometimes it's my own bad choices. Sometimes other people, God gives freedom to make choices that really hurt you and have hurt others.
[time=2122] And sometimes God just intervenes and disciplines us because he loves us.
[time=2130] Just like my dad did. My dad loved me, but I tell you what, when I could hear the belt coming through the loops on my dad's pants sometimes, real fast.
[time=2143] You know, when I know he loved me, but right at that instant, I wasn't thinking about, "I know this is for my good.
[time=2152] I just can't wait for you to lay it on me, Dad. I just need..." No, it doesn't feel good.
[time=2158] Now often when I've looked back on disciplinary times in my life, when I look back on those and I see, "Yes, God, I really believe you allowed those things."
[time=2170] Or you even intervene and cause those things, some of those to happen, for my good.
[time=2176] I know when I look back on it, I believe that.
[time=2179] But during the beginning stages of it, it doesn't feel like that at all.
[time=2184] But he does. The Bible's clear. In Hebrews 12, he clearly intervenes.
[time=2189] Let's look at that. Hebrews chapter 12. That's not on the screen for you, I don't think.
[time=2193] But let me just read that to you. Hebrews 12 verses 7 through 13.
[time=2198] He says, "Endure hardship as discipline. God is treating you as sons for what son is not disciplined by his father.
[time=2206] If you are not disciplined and everyone undergoes discipline, then you are illegitimate children and not true sons.
[time=2212] Moreover, we have all had human fathers who disciplined us and we respected them for it.
[time=2217] How much more should we submit to the father of our spirits and live?
[time=2222] Our fathers disciplined us for a little while as they thought best.
[time=2225] But God disciplines us for our good that we may share in his holiness.
[time=2231] Do you want to participate in the holiness of God?
[time=2234] The Bible says he disciplines us in order that we might share in his holiness.
[time=2240] He gets our attention and causes us to think about his otherness.
[time=2246] No discipline seems pleasant at the time and is at the truth, but painful.
[time=2256] Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained in it.
[time=2264] The times that I've gone through hardship, I look back and I see that God was with me.
[time=2273] I'm sure you can think of times when it was so difficult that if you'd known all of what was transpiring,
[time=2280] you might have chucked it and given up early on.
[time=2283] But when you look back on it and you see that as you held on to God and he held on to you moving through that process,
[time=2290] you survived it and you look back and you say, "He's good." The circumstances were awful, but he's good.
[time=2299] That's his way, not my way.
[time=2302] I wouldn't plan it that way.
[time=2307] Audrey Handel is a member of our church.
[time=2309] Many of you remember early days in their family life when Jim and Audrey were together
[time=2316] and Greg was the eldest and Ryan and Lisa.
[time=2320] And Audrey is a lady that you might see here.
[time=2324] She works here.
[time=2325] She cleans a lot of things here.
[time=2327] She works in this building all the time and she helps people through grief and she helps prepare people's food for funerals.
[time=2335] She does a lot of different things.
[time=2337] And you know what?
[time=2338] When you see Audrey, if you didn't know this, for some of you who've just met her recently and I tell you what went on in her life, you may be shocked.
[time=2348] Her son, Greg, got leukemia.
[time=2351] And he went through the typical treatments that were really difficult.
[time=2358] And eventually he died.
[time=2363] Young teenager.
[time=2367] And that was hard. And Jim and Audrey and Ryan and Lisa moved through that trial with God.
[time=2375] And they found God faithful.
[time=2379] And it was evident in their lives.
[time=2381] And we saw the character that developed out of that.
[time=2383] And we saw the hope that they had.
[time=2385] And they talked more about heaven than they had before.
[time=2390] And just a couple years later, Audrey's husband Jim had a heart attack running on the track at IPFW and died.
[time=2401] And I thought, "No Lord." You can't take this woman and these two kids through the death of a sibling and a son
[time=2410] and now have the dad die too.
[time=2414] That just isn't right.
[time=2416] And you know what?
[time=2417] It isn't right.
[time=2419] From my perspective, now, how do Audrey, Ryan and Lisa, respond to that?
[time=2429] Well, if you see Audrey now, her faith is stronger.
[time=2433] She moved through two trials that I don't want people to have to go through.
[time=2438] After the service, first service, one guy came down to me and he said, "You know, when you use health things as an example in death and as an example, sometimes there's an end to that and you can look back on it and see how, but some things that you're living through don't have an end while you're on this earth." And he's right.
[time=2456] But God is able and he will come alongside us.
[time=2461] Suffering is on the way.
[time=2463] And number two, suffering is an opportunity to grow.
[time=2472] Rome is five, one through five.
[time=2475] Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
[time=2481] through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand, and we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God.
[time=2490] Not only so, but we also rejoice in our sufferings because we know that suffering produces perseverance,
[time=2498] character, and character hope.
[time=2502] And hope does not disappoint us because God has poured out His love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit whom He has given us.
[time=2511] When I watch people go through suffering with God, when people are willing to see suffering as an opportunity to grow, they really don't even have to be conscious of that.
[time=2525] They simply have to be conscious of the fact that He is right.
[time=2531] Eli had it down.
[time=2533] His ways are right.
[time=2535] Whatever He chooses for us is best.
[time=2538] If we really know that, then we'll be willing to persevere, stay under the difficulty.
[time=2545] Suffering leads to perseverance, it says.
[time=2547] Well, sufferings are any distresses, any pressure that you feel that's hard for you to stay under.
[time=2553] Suffering yields perseverance in a believer's life, steadfastness, the ability to stay, remain under without giving in.
[time=2563] I'm going to move through this process.
[time=2565] I'm not going to cash it in, I'm not going to cave in on my faith.
[time=2569] And perseverance leads to character, proof.
[time=2573] It's interesting, that word really means proof.
[time=2576] As I persevere through trial, my character becomes more his character.
[time=2585] And it gives me, people see that there's proof that I have a relationship with him
[time=2592] as my character grows.
[time=2594] And not only that, it reassures me that I am in Christ,
[time=2600] because my character grows instead of falls apart as I persevere through suffering with him.
[time=2607] And that character then leads to hope.
[time=2610] And people might see that someone has hope who's been through a lot of difficulties.
[time=2614] One of the things I've noticed over the years is, this person may go through the very same circumstance that this person went through.
[time=2623] One person may come out of this shining in character and hope, and the other person has caved in and is miserably unhappy.
[time=2634] What's the difference?
[time=2635] The difference is, I've trusted in Christ here, I haven't trusted in Christ here.
[time=2640] I've held onto his hand, he is faithful.
[time=2643] He will see us through these things.
[time=2646] I haven't here.
[time=2649] Hope, confidence that the future is better than the present.
[time=2653] Now I'm not talking about confidence that the future on this earth is going to be bright and shiny.
[time=2659] I may have a 50-year suffering issue that I think, "Oh, I'm going to have another 20 years at least that'll be good." That's not the issue.
[time=2666] The reality is, we are trapped in a fallen world.
[time=2671] And if we allow ourselves to empathize with those who are suffering,
[time=2677] we will be suffering all the time.
[time=2683] Did you get that?
[time=2684] And some of us do.
[time=2687] If we allow ourselves to really think in terms of building the kingdom
[time=2693] and being part of the body of Christ and that we're in a fallen world and we aren't embracing the world but the people in the world, we will empathize and we will be suffering a lot.
[time=2705] And it'll build character and it'll cause hope.
[time=2709] And in that case then, all I have to look forward to.
[time=2712] If I really see what I want to do is turn the TV off when the pictures have starving kids on there.
[time=2718] I want to flip the channel to another channel so I don't have to embrace and empathize with the suffering that's taking place around the world because of its fallen condition.
[time=2729] I flip the channel instead of embracing it.
[time=2733] When I embrace it, I suffer.
[time=2736] And you know what folks? We're going to do that until the day we die.
[time=2742] And he wants us there.
[time=2745] That doesn't mean I don't experience joy because I do.
[time=2751] But I embrace the suffering.
[time=2756] I know a little guy, he's seven.
[time=2759] He's embraced his suffering.
[time=2763] He's Jacob and he has something called Morquillo syndrome.
[time=2769] I don't understand it very well but I know that his bones don't grow the way they're supposed to.
[time=2774] And it's a genetic disorder.
[time=2776] From birth he's had a real problem, his bones just haven't grown.
[time=2779] And he's seven now and he's about three feet tall and he's going to be three feet tall for a while.
[time=2785] And he was able to hobble around in his condition and so he played on a little league team.
[time=2792] And this team, the pitchers were the coaches and the coaches would toss one up there.
[time=2796] And he was on the team and he couldn't possibly beat one out to first base unless people on the other team embraced his suffering and allowed him to make it to first base.
[time=2807] And every once in a while they'd do that.
[time=2809] There'd be an error here or there, whatever.
[time=2812] This mom had this son and he has been taught by his mother and his grandparents that he has hope.
[time=2825] And it's a reality to him.
[time=2827] Now you know it doesn't seem right but a couple months ago in the middle of that little league season Jacob fell out of bed and hurt his spinal cord.
[time=2838] And he's very tender and he couldn't walk anymore.
[time=2843] So he went to the last game in a wheelchair, they wheeled him in there and all he did was lift everybody's spirits.
[time=2849] You know why?
[time=2850] His hope isn't in getting to play another baseball game.
[time=2853] This little guy is only seven years old.
[time=2856] His hope is not in him ever walking right on this.
[time=2860] His hope isn't that he'll live till 35 because he'll probably die in his twenties.
[time=2864] His hope isn't placed in anything on this earth.
[time=2867] His hope is in Jesus Christ and him alone.
[time=2873] And so when he talks to people he had a conversation with his grandfather and he said, "Poppy, I really want to go snowboarding."
[time=2882] He can't snowboard and his grandpa looked at him and said, "Jacob, you know you can't." He goes, "No, not here, I mean there." He thinks about it all the time.
[time=2894] You know why?
[time=2896] Because he doesn't have much hope here.
[time=2900] Sometimes when I've been with hospital patients I've said you're in a very privileged position.
[time=2905] You're in a privileged position sometimes when your hope is gone.
[time=2908] You can't make it in this world.
[time=2912] You'll place your hope where your hope belongs.
[time=2917] Jacob's done that.
[time=2920] He's got a good grandpa and grandmother that are teaching that and he's got a mom that teaches them that every day.
[time=2927] And they've placed their hope in eternal things too.
[time=2932] James 1 says that we are to consider it pure joy.
[time=2938] Pure joy, think about that.
[time=2940] We are to consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds.
[time=2945] Why?
[time=2946] Because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance.
[time=2949] It's the same perseverance we were talking about in Romans 5.
[time=2952] Trials, perseverance, hope.
[time=2955] Perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete.
[time=2959] What does God want you to be?
[time=2961] Not lacking anything.
[time=2962] He wants you to be heavenly-minded.
[time=2964] He wants us to have an eternal perspective.
[time=2967] He wants us to place our hope in him, not in things being good on this earth.
[time=2973] So when I get a trial, when sufferings come my way, when they come our children's way, when things don't go the way that they should go, we have a plan.
[time=2982] You're born, you live, you get educated, you get a job, you have a nice house, you have a nice family.
[time=2988] You grow to be at least 80 to 85 years old, then you die and we kind of ignore that part.
[time=2995] And when the plan doesn't work out that way, because God's ways aren't those ways, we think something's wrong.
[time=3003] Something's not wrong.
[time=3010] Suffering is on the way.
[time=3014] Suffering is an opportunity to grow and suffering is an opportunity to help others.
[time=3020] Suffering is an opportunity to help others.
[time=3026] Have you ever been through enough suffering that you've experienced the comfort that comes from God
[time=3036] and the comfort that comes from others?
[time=3043] If you haven't been, sometimes you haven't allowed that, but most of us have experienced
[time=3050] the comfort that comes from God and that comes from others.
[time=3055] I remember sometimes when I really didn't feel like reading the Bible, and I would just kind of struggle with that.
[time=3065] I knew I should do it, but I didn't want to do it.
[time=3070] And when I would make myself do that, it didn't matter what I read.
[time=3077] It's the comfort in the words of God.
[time=3081] This book is alive and active.
[time=3084] It's the only living thing.
[time=3086] And it brings comfort.
[time=3089] And then when you've experienced comfort from him and comfort from others, the Bible says that it's an opportunity then for me to help others.
[time=3099] I've experienced suffering so that I can now comfort those with the comfort that I've been comforted.
[time=3105] Second Corinthians verses three through seven in chapter one.
[time=3109] Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort,
[time=3116] who comforts us in all our troubles so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves have received from God.
[time=3125] For just as the sufferings of Christ flow over into our lives, so also through Christ our comfort overflows.
[time=3134] If we are distressed, it is for your comfort and salvation, Paul says.
[time=3138] If we are comfort, it is for your comfort, which produces in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we suffer.
[time=3146] And our hope for you is firm because we know that just as you share in our sufferings, so also you share in our comfort.
[time=3156] That's a very important verse to me. I was telling you about Audrey Hindles suffering, her son Greg.
[time=3166] Her son Greg, as he went through chemotherapy, as he went through bone marrow transplants, he was really, really sick.
[time=3175] He was really down. And he had a period of time in his life during that time where he got discouraged.
[time=3183] And then God did an incredible thing. God gave him hope and his joy came back.
[time=3191] In the last months of his life, Greg, every time I went to see him, I walked out of there going, man, life is good.
[time=3203] He was lying there dying, but he gave me hope.
[time=3207] He wrote Tom Cashin a letter, one of the last letters that he wrote, and Tom shared it with me.
[time=3213] I remember reading the thing and just thinking about how mature this person was, writing this letter, young teenager.
[time=3220] And he quoted that verse. That's what he said at the end.
[time=3225] He talked about how he'd been comforted and how he'd been given the opportunity to comfort nurses and doctors and other family members of other leukemia patients and those leukemia patients.
[time=3236] And the people that had come to visit him, and he said, "And our hope for you is firm because we know that just as you share in our sufferings, so also you share in our comfort."
[time=3246] Greg comforted others on his deathbed. Why? Because he had experienced suffering with him.
[time=3260] He had matured as he persevered through the obstacles of his illness. He matured in Christ.
[time=3269] It says that. That's what happened to him.
[time=3272] And then he was able to be a minister to people while he was lying there sick.
[time=3280] Paul said he listed his hardships in 2 Corinthians 6. Remember, he said he had every kind of beaten, thought dead, hungry, shipwrecked, all those things.
[time=3292] And then Paul says that his light and momentary troubles in 2 Corinthians 4. Look at it with me. We're in that chapter.
[time=3302] 2 Corinthians 4. He says his light verse 16. He says, "We don't lose heart, though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day.
[time=3319] For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all.
[time=3326] Why could Paul say that those things were light and momentary troubles?" I mean, we're talking about death here, folks.
[time=3333] We're talking about hunger and people being ill and struggling.
[time=3338] And he says these are light and momentary troubles. Why? Because he was comparing them to an eternal glory that far outweighs them all.
[time=3352] Is your hope that you'll get through the trouble so that things will be good for you for the rest of your life on earth?
[time=3361] If that's your hope, get ready. It ain't happening.
[time=3367] Troubles are going to face us for the rest of our lives on this earth.
[time=3374] Paul says they're light and momentary compared to what we're going to experience.
[time=3382] I have three questions for you. This is the most important one, I think.
[time=3387] Do you really believe that living in a fallen world is bad?
[time=3393] I want to explain that a little bit. Do you really believe that living in a fallen world is bad?
[time=3399] Are you able to be in the world not of it?
[time=3403] The people that say the world is wonderful, that the systems that are out there in place that make it possible for us to experience wealth and comfort.
[time=3413] The people that embrace those systems, sometimes they're in the church, I don't think they really believe it's bad.
[time=3421] I think they talk about it being bad and then they jump in with both feet and experience all the pleasures that you get out of participation.
[time=3431] Do you really believe that the fallen world is bad?
[time=3437] Are you feeling their pain? All the people that are suffering out there, even when you don't happen to be suffering yourself?
[time=3446] Are you preparing you and your children for that? That's a good question.
[time=3450] Are you preparing you and your children for the suffering that's coming?
[time=3454] Are they going to be ready to persevere through it? Are they going to watch you persevere through it?
[time=3460] And then thirdly, do you take the time to comfort people with the comfort that you've been comforted?
[time=3472] I really challenge you today. I challenge you to see suffering as on the way it's coming.
[time=3482] See suffering as an opportunity to grow and then embrace it.
[time=3487] It doesn't mean it's happy hour. Embrace it and be willing to move through it, persevere through it with God.
[time=3495] And then comfort others with His comfort.
[time=3501] Father in heaven, so many times I feel like the one foot that I have in the world is entrenched more deeply than the foot I have in the kingdom.
[time=3516] And I don't want to be of this world, but Lord, it just draws me in because I love the pleasure that comes with it.
[time=3527] And I just ask you please, Lord, to help us see things more your way.
[time=3534] You said as the heavens are higher than the earth, so your ways are higher than our ways and your thoughts than our thoughts.
[time=3541] And I pray that we'd have your thoughts, that we'd embrace suffering, that we'd persevere through it, and that we'd live with hope for eternity.
[time=3550] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
