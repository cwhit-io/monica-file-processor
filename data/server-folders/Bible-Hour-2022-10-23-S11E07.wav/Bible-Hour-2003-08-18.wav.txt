[time=635] For us, we choose Father to respond like that. It is well with my soul.
[time=644] Lord, help us to have a perspective that's more like yours.
[time=649] Father, help us to trust that all things work for good. In Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=657] [MUSIC]
[time=665] A few weeks ago, we were sitting in the room back here where several of us meet every Tuesday morning.
[time=673] Every Tuesday morning for three hours or so will meet as a team to pray about and plan with His help these times.
[time=684] This 70 minutes that He gives us each and every week. And we knew as we look forward to this week that we would be coming to this verse that some of you here in the room are very familiar with.
[time=696] Others of you here today, it may be new truth, but we knew today we would come to Romans 8, 28, in our discussion, in our study that we've been in recently of God, His sovereignty, and this thing called suffering.
[time=711] And as we've been kind of working our way through this, we've said from week one, you know, to you and we've said it kind of to ourselves, don't blame God.
[time=721] When the suffering comes, when the trials hit, God's words really clear. Don't blame Him. Don't blame Him.
[time=728] Because then the second thing we've seen and Steve brought it to bear last week in such a powerful way, because he's so ready to walk through it with you.
[time=737] And he does that in miraculous and very personal in real ways.
[time=742] And all of that leads us to this morning where we conclude by saying again as God's word says so clearly, don't blame Him.
[time=750] He walks through it with you and in the end, He works it all out for good.
[time=756] And we begin to discuss in that meeting this idea of Him working it out for good.
[time=761] And Eric asked me if I'd just maybe write a few things down, and so I, as we met, I just began to scribble.
[time=768] And what I wrote was this.
[time=772] It says, let me just read the verse to you first.
[time=776] It says in Romans 8, 28, "For we know that He causes, and we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose."
[time=790] And what I wrote was this.
[time=792] I wrote down, many of us have struggled with the meaning or promise of this verse.
[time=797] In most cases, due to an inaccurate understanding of this word, this concept of good, He causes all things to turn out for good.
[time=810] Does He? You're telling me He causes all heartache, all pain, all loss, all tragedy, all confusion, and all trial to turn out for good?
[time=824] And you see what happens is we think that this good is going to be our good.
[time=831] We so often think that this good that's promised in Romans 8 is our circumstances changing, our circumstantial benefit, our immediate good.
[time=844] Not necessarily, though, for you see the good promised in Romans 8, 28 is kingdom good.
[time=850] Church, did you hear that?
[time=852] The good promise there is big picture, good. His good in your life, yes, but His good in mine, and His good in theirs, and His good over in that arena, and His good over in this one.
[time=870] And when that's your perspective, then you realize, and I just kind of ran a scenario through my mind,
[time=876] you realize that your faith, or my faith, and my perseverance in the midst of trial may in time lead someone to faith who heard about it.
[time=886] My circumstance from an aunt's friend who heard about it from a cousin of her's dad who worked with a friend of mine in Nevada.
[time=898] I mean, I was just kind of spitballing there, but you get the drift.
[time=904] And here's the deal, that person in Nevada, their eternity might very well have been altered.
[time=914] While my circumstance here, your circumstance here stays hard.
[time=925] Let me ask you just for a moment to just bow your heads.
[time=929] And just between you and Him, just think with me.
[time=935] I don't know what it is you're facing, I don't know what it is that you've encountered, I don't know what wind of trial or suffering may be blowing through your life today.
[time=948] But I tell you what, the Trump will resound, and the Lord will descend.
[time=956] And your circumstance might not ever change.
[time=960] It could, it may, but would you today be willing to invite Him honestly?
[time=966] It's kind of a scary thing, but would you today be willing to honestly invite Him to reshape and remold the level of trust and willingness in your life, me and mine,
[time=977] to see the good come from whatever circumstances may arise.
[time=982] God, this is our prayer, and as Ed and Marsha share with us this morning, this very process that you've brought them through in their own lives.
[time=991] God, I pray that your truth would be lifted up and that our hearts would be encouraged.
[time=995] And your son's name we pray, amen.
[time=1000] One of my most favorite verses in the Bible, and the reason it is, is because it shows the magnificence of God's power.
[time=1011] And I want to recite it from my Bible, it's the new living translation, it's my favorite translation.
[time=1019] And what I do is in my mind, I don't know if you guys ever do this, but in my mind, I think like I'm this great orator or narrator with this beautiful, low, deep voice and echo.
[time=1034] And you can hear thunder and lightning in the background and, well, let me just say it, it's Genesis 1-1.
[time=1043] In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth, and the earth was empty.
[time=1054] A formless mass cloaked in darkness.
[time=1062] Do you hear the lightning?
[time=1064] I do.
[time=1065] I love this part, it gives me the goosebumps.
[time=1070] And the spirit of God was hovering over its surface.
[time=1078] And God said, "Let there be light." And there was light.
[time=1083] Now you take that same God and go forward about a few thousands of years, and he's forming and creating this little baby girl in Emma Fern's tummy.
[time=1095] Born December 21, 1953, 5 o'clock in the morning on a cold winter day, to George Andrew and Emma Fern Roars, they were farmers, Marshall Lee, that was me.
[time=1109] And I was raised on a hog farm, Dad had like 650 hogs, and he farmed about 160 acres.
[time=1119] I had a good life, I grew up, four years of college, graduated music, but no MRS degree.
[time=1129] Well, see, God had a plan, you know, that God back there.
[time=1133] From Modesto, California, he brings a fella, and he joins this group by joining a singing group called Sounds Alive in 1977.
[time=1142] Started by Peter Coby, Pastor David Jeremiah was there, and that fella is this one right here.
[time=1151] Hi, honey.
[time=1154] You sure look good today.
[time=1157] Can I blow you little kids?
[time=1161] You want to blow me a little kid?
[time=1165] Well, anyway, about six, seven years in their marriage, we have a little baby girl born Super Bowl Sunday that year, January 26, 1986.
[time=1175] And about five months, five and a half months, she has a seizure with Ottawa's fever.
[time=1180] Okay, fine.
[time=1181] Eight months, same thing.
[time=1183] About a year, the doctor says, now we're going to have to put her on medication because of her seizures.
[time=1189] And then she started getting sick a lot.
[time=1191] She had pneumonia, she has his manic bronchitis.
[time=1195] And then about, oh, I'd say about a year and a half or two, you know, she's not doing the things other kids are doing.
[time=1203] And so we had her tested and they said, well, she's developmentally disabled.
[time=1207] And then I'm going like, whoa, you know, I'm supposed to have this healthy little baby, what's going on here.
[time=1214] And I can remember, I would plead with God and I'd pray, you know, I'd squint my eyes and I'd grit my teeth.
[time=1220] I mean, it wasn't mad at God or anything.
[time=1222] And I'd go like this and I'd go, oh, Lord, please.
[time=1225] Not Audra, please take her seizures away.
[time=1228] All of them, I know you're the great physician.
[time=1230] I know you can do it.
[time=1233] Nothing.
[time=1235] Okay, Lord, just don't let her get sick so much.
[time=1238] Like maybe once every two months, you know, and then she wouldn't have so many seizures and, well, that didn't happen either.
[time=1246] And, you know, I thought, okay, I can take a week of pain.
[time=1249] Okay, maybe a month of pain.
[time=1252] Six months and, you know, you might as well dig me a hole.
[time=1255] I'm going to jump in it and cover myself up.
[time=1258] And it wasn't six months.
[time=1260] It was like five, six years.
[time=1262] And about in the middle of that, I let go of God's hand.
[time=1266] And I can still remember getting up in the morning and I was sick to my stomach and I go to the toilet with the dry heaves.
[time=1273] Because I was afraid to start a new day.
[time=1277] And I remember it now as I look back on it.
[time=1281] You know that God back there who was hovering over an empty surface?
[time=1287] He was the same one that was kneeling by that toilet and he was rubbing my back.
[time=1294] And he was trying to tell me, I have a plan.
[time=1298] I understand you've got to trust me.
[time=1301] Please take my hand again.
[time=1304] Well, I know in my mind a lot of times I get pictures in my mind and I just picture God.
[time=1309] You know, he's got this gorgeous throne room up in heaven and he gets up off there.
[time=1314] And you know, he's got a tab or an apple up there and he's got his home.
[time=1318] And so he goes to the medicine cabinet and he pulls out this heavenly menthol rub.
[time=1325] And he begins rubbing it on my soul.
[time=1329] And the reason, the way I knew how I could feel that was, and everyone has ever helped me,
[time=1336] I remember every one of you in my pain.
[time=1341] And these are people from our church.
[time=1343] I remember back Karen Weinbrenner.
[time=1345] Years ago she came a couple times and watched Audra because I never could get to church hardly.
[time=1349] I felt like I was always in the ICU Park view and I remember Ed got to know Paul Taylor.
[time=1357] He's been ministering with the Bible hour for a long, long time.
[time=1361] His wife Kay is a nurse for Dr. John Brandenberger here in Fort Wayne.
[time=1366] Well, she used to come years ago to our little apartment on Hobson Road and administer a shot for Audra.
[time=1372] And it was to help boost her immune system.
[time=1374] We'll see this God who plans.
[time=1377] Well, years later he spoke to Kay and whispered in her heart and she obeyed.
[time=1383] And it's been like five or six years now, she's been doing this for me.
[time=1387] She gets people that come to our house and babysit so that I can go and be a part of the Christmas program here.
[time=1395] And if she doesn't have a lady that comes, you know, she'll do it.
[time=1399] People like Mary Mishler, Mary Kay Siegelin, Nancy Gardner, Georgia Hines, Frida Gibson, Sherry Marisie, Betty and John Brandenberger came.
[time=1411] Elaine Zollman and Nick even came one time.
[time=1415] And dear sweet Beth Mill, she's in heaven now.
[time=1419] But this last Christmas she wanted to do it and she took Audra.
[time=1423] I think it was the biggest day, three days, three concerts that day.
[time=1427] And I didn't get home to like 10, 10, 30 that night and she wanted to do it.
[time=1431] She passed away a cancer.
[time=1433] And I remember Scott Schiller would have us over on Christmas Eve.
[time=1437] And his sister Brenda, and they give gifts to the girls.
[time=1441] And Brenda, I remember years ago when I was in the praise band, she would come sometimes on a Sunday morning and watch the girls
[time=1447] when Hillary, I other daughter was like three, four and just watch her.
[time=1452] And just different ones.
[time=1454] One more I wanted to mention was, oh, can I have your name now?
[time=1460] Well, anyway, all these different ones, God had handpicked for my pain way back there when he was creating the world.
[time=1472] He knew it was coming for me and he was there for me.
[time=1477] You know, in Psalms 103 it says that he surrounds me with love and tender mercies.
[time=1484] And in Psalm 145 he says he helps the fallen and he lifts them up those bent beneath their load.
[time=1493] And that was me.
[time=1498] You know, I put Audrey to bed at night and no matter if she's had a bad day or good day, I don't know what it is.
[time=1505] She loves her bed and she smiles whenever she gets into bed.
[time=1509] And a lot of times I'll kneel at her bed and I'll say, now, Audrey, you dream your dreams about heaven.
[time=1518] And you're going to see Jesus and he's going to cup his hands and place them under your chin.
[time=1526] And he's going to lift his face up to yours.
[time=1529] And your eyes are going to look into his and he's going to look in your eyes and he's going to smile.
[time=1537] And your damaged brain will be set free.
[time=1542] And for the very first time you will know him, the one who was loving you when he was creating the world back there.
[time=1554] Ed and I are going to sing a song and it's called "Smile" by Chris Rice about the longing.
[time=1566] [MUSIC]

[time=2280] And that's what he does is he carries us through it as Marsha talked about, and so suffering becomes an opportunity, becomes an opportunity to grow, to grow in my intimacy with God, to grow to be more like his heart.
[time=2290] And it also is an opportunity for me to help others who suffer the same way.
[time=2296] And then finally, where we are today, the third thing.
[time=2300] First, don't blame God, trust him.
[time=2304] Second, he walks through it with me.
[time=2306] And third, he works it out for good.
[time=2312] For good.
[time=2314] Not necessarily your immediate, circumstantial good.
[time=2320] He works it out.
[time=2322] He promises for kingdom good, his good, as his plan continues to unfold, and as his unfolding plan in your life has the opportunity to touch and impact the lives of others.
[time=2336] Some you're aware of, some you'll never even know.
[time=2338] His good comes to pass.
[time=2340] Look at that verse, would you?
[time=2342] Again, for some of you this morning, it might be a completely new truth, but I want you to look with me at Romans 8, 28, and then we're going to also look at 31 and a few other verses there.
[time=2352] It's just a great reminder.
[time=2354] He really does cause all things to work together for good.
[time=2358] Look what it says, and we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to his purpose.
[time=2368] And look what it says in 31.
[time=2370] That being said, what then shall we say to these things?
[time=2376] What then shall we say to these things?
[time=2378] If God is for us, who's against us?
[time=2382] It's a great thought, the God of this world, the God whose spirit hovered, that Marsha brings to mind there as she reads from Genesis.
[time=2392] That very God is for you.
[time=2396] And that being said, who is against us?
[time=2402] He who did not spare his own son, but delivered him over for us all.
[time=2408] How will he not also with him freely give us all things?
[time=2412] All things.
[time=2416] And again, sometimes we think that which he's going to give us in the midst of our trial is going to be this, but he says no, it's big picture good.
[time=2424] It's kingdom good.
[time=2424] And it's that same principle that Steve showed you in 2 Corinthians 4.
[time=2428] Turn there real quick.
[time=2430] Just a few more books back in your New Testament.
[time=2432] 2 Corinthians 4, look at verse 16.
[time=2438] So very important to keep this in mind.
[time=2440] So very important for you and I to understand the weight and the meaning of these great words.
[time=2448] Therefore, it says Paul in 2 Corinthians 4, 16, therefore we do not lose heart.
[time=2456] And I know sometimes you want to.
[time=2458] I know sometimes like Marcia, you're down there knelt over the toilet or wherever it is that you've come to this posture, this position of you know what God, I cannot keep going.
[time=2474] And I know there are times when you really feel like you can't even help it, you're just going to lose heart.
[time=2484] There's still small voice with that comforting hand on your back comes to your spirit and says you can.
[time=2494] I'm here, hold on.
[time=2498] And Paul says therefore we do not lose heart.
[time=2502] But though our outer man is decaying, though we find ourselves, you and I stuck in this fallen world with things not as they were intended, but they are today.
[time=2514] A result of where sin has taken it and it's ugly and at times very difficult, so very painful and confusing, though our outer man is decaying yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.
[time=2526] Here it is for momentary momentary and the bigger scope of things.
[time=2530] For momentary light affliction.
[time=2536] For this momentary light affliction is producing for us a changed circumstance.
[time=2542] No, it is reading, it is producing for us an eternal weight of glory, far beyond all comparison.
[time=2552] And we were just thinking today, you know it would be, we were thinking this week that it would be great today for us to just try our best in the time that we have to just encourage you.
[time=2560] And to think about this truth, this Romans 828 truth, the second Corinthians 4 truth that he really does work it out for good.
[time=2572] Sometimes you're immediate, but in the end always, his kingdom good, it might just be good for you to remember that this book, this unfolding story of God's blood is full of people who experienced this very thing.
[time=2588] And so we were just going to today throw a few of those out there for you, talk briefly about it, but we would really encourage you to think about it.
[time=2596] You'll see four on the screen. Mitch is going to jump in here and tell you a little bit about the Apostle Paul.
[time=2600] We encourage you to read about the life of Joseph, Genesis 37-50, and in the book of Daniel, read about Daniel because they model what we're talking about, but let's talk about Paul who writes this.
[time=2614] Very interesting. In Acts 858, you see him as Saul, and he's there when Stephen gets stoned, kind of holding the coats of people.
[time=2622] And I'm convinced at this point, after studying his life intently, you know, he's about 20, 25 years old and 35 AD, and he's one of the smartest men, if not the smartest on the planet.
[time=2634] He was educated in University of Tarsus, he was taught in Jerusalem by Gamaliel, which he says in Scripture, and he was either the son or the grandson of Hillel, who wrote all the Old Testament commentary for the Jews.
[time=2650] I mean, this guy is smart, and he's persecuting these people who are Jewish and saying yes to Christ.
[time=2658] And he sees this great life, recorded in Acts 9, this great light comes down on him and it's Jesus, and he's probably getting ready to hear, "Way to go, way to go, man."
[time=2668] He thinks God's going to tell him, "Way to be the big Pharisee." But Paul says, "Who are you?" And he says, "I'm Jesus.
[time=2678] I'm the one you're persecuting.
[time=2680] We're going to do this differently." And Paul's life has changed.
[time=2688] I think Paul has taken off one set of eyeglasses, the way he sees life, and put it on a new set of eyeglasses.
[time=2696] And Paul goes on a totally different journey.
[time=2698] It's kind of an upside down the way the world sees it, but I really want to remind you that it's the world that's upside down.
[time=2704] It's that which is opposed to God that's upside down.
[time=2708] But Paul gets beaten, gets imprisoned, all for communicating the grace, the undeserved love, the unmerited favor that's available in Christ.
[time=2720] And now I got to think about that because Paul writes about Philippians 1, these chains.
[time=2726] I was in a group where I was teaching Philippians and I said, "What are your chains?
[time=2730] What are your chains?" And it hit me at the very end, after all of us had shared, you know what our chains were?
[time=2736] Problems with our comfort, problems with our abundance, problems with poor decisions we made.
[time=2742] Paul's chains are because he's communicating the love and the grace of Jesus Christ.
[time=2750] Are any of us really ever in this Western culture persecuted for that?
[time=2754] Couldn't we really take some stronger stance in PTA meetings, at home, at work?
[time=2764] Couldn't we go ahead and say, "Turn up the suffering because I'm given my life to Jesus Christ no matter what happens?"
[time=2770] And I'm going to communicate that everywhere I go.
[time=2774] Let's just look at a couple verses that Paul writes.
[time=2778] And I want to start with verse 29 here, and the Romans 8, 29, "What's good?"
[time=2784] And verse 29 says, "For those God foreknew, for those He loved first, He also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of His Son."
[time=2794] That's what's good.
[time=2794] To have your heart conformed to the heart of Jesus Christ, to have your mind, your will, your emotions, your spirit show the fingerprints of God everywhere you go.
[time=2806] And in Romans 5, Paul addresses this, and he says in Romans 5 1, "Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace through God with God through our Lord Jesus Christ through whom we have gained access by faith into His grace in which we now stand, and we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God."
[time=2828] Glory means the revelation of His character and presence.
[time=2830] So listen to this, verse 3, not only so, and I had to memorize this, because I have kind of a suffering spirit, I have a suffering temperament.
[time=2838] I can get down in a hurry.
[time=2840] And not only so, but we also rejoice in our sufferings because we know that suffering produces perseverance as we see with Ed and Marcia.
[time=2848] Suffering produces perseverance.
[time=2850] Perseverance produces character to be molded in shape like Christ.
[time=2854] And character produces hope, and get this next verse, verse 5, "That confident assurance does not disappoint us because God has poured out His love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit whom He has given us."
[time=2872] Maybe just want to jot down 2 Corinthians 12, 9 and 10.
[time=2876] 2 Corinthians 12, 9 and 10. Paul's suffering says, "Steve took us through last week, they recorded in 2 Corinthians 6 and 2 Corinthians 11."
[time=2884] And then in verse 12, he summarizes the whole suffering like this.
[time=2888] He says, "You know what? Bring it on." Because in my weakness, the power of Jesus Christ comes through.
[time=2898] So I will rejoice in sufferings.
[time=2900] And so what Paul's saying is, he takes off that set of glasses that we tend to look at life through, that look at suffering through.
[time=2908] That's all about me, all about my selfishness, all about my pride, all about my kingdom.
[time=2914] And he sets them down and he picks up this other set of glasses.
[time=2918] And he says, "I'm going to see it through God's eyes." Because it's about His kingdom. It's about His higher good. It's about people loving and being loved, knowing and being known, serving and even being served by a holy God in community with each other.
[time=2936] And we become the body of Christ to one another.
[time=2940] Well said. Well said, Joseph, Daniel, Paul, Jeremiah, again just for that we immediately were drawn to.
[time=2952] And I don't know if you've ever studied or looked at the life of Jeremiah, have you?
[time=2958] It's an interesting eye-opening, pretty convicting read.
[time=2964] Are you familiar with Jeremiah? Here's the deal with Jeremiah, mind-boggling to me, just period, but then also because I do what I do with my life.
[time=2976] It's the same thing that Jeremiah wanted to do with his.
[time=2978] And here's the thing with Jeremiah.
[time=2980] Jeremiah is this, at the point of his calling, he's this young man that God calls to be a prophet, a voice for God to his people.
[time=2988] God calls Jeremiah to preach a message of repentance.
[time=2992] He says, Jeremiah, go to these people and tell them the truth and call him back to what is right and true.
[time=2998] And so, Jeremiah, with all of his zeal and with all of his excitement to fulfill the calling of God in his life, which would be to proclaim truth and see people respond, goes.
[time=3010] And he delivers this message.
[time=3012] And not one single person responds.
[time=3018] Do you know how encouraging it is for me, for a guy like Mitch or Steve or for other teachers?
[time=3024] Do you know how encouraging it is to give time and effort to try to do your best to communicate truth?
[time=3030] And somebody writes you a note or somebody shoots you a voicemail or somebody just comes up afterwards and says, thanks so much.
[time=3036] See, nobody responded to Jeremiah's message, not one.
[time=3042] Not only did they not respond, they were so offended by what he said, they were so recalcitrant in their hearts, they were so hardened, they put him in stocks, they take him and they drag him and they put him in stocks in the city square.
[time=3056] They put him up on display, they spit on him, they hit him, they yell at him, finally they kick him out and tell him to be quiet.
[time=3066] And it's amazing, his first introduction to ministry, it doesn't go so well, it wasn't what he had thought and he says even he can look with me if you want, Jeremiah 20.
[time=3076] He says in Jeremiah 20, he gets real honest with God, he says in Jeremiah 20 verse 7, oh Lord, you have deceived, this guy's been put in stocks, he's been spit on and kicked and told to be quiet, you have deceived me.
[time=3092] And I was deceived, you have overcome me and prevailed, I have become a laughing stock all day long, everyone mocks me, this guy is absolutely disillusioned.
[time=3104] He says in verse 14, cursed be the day when I was born, this is how bad it's getting, let the day not be blessed when my mother bore me, cursed be the man who brought the news to my father saying a baby has been born to you and made him very happy.
[time=3120] I don't like my birthday, I don't like my mom, I don't even like the guy who came and told my dad I was born.
[time=3130] But then look at verse 9, kind of go back a few.
[time=3134] See there's that character, there's that reality that God is at work and he probably can be trusted and oh yeah, what about what I've been called to do, what about this road that he's asked me to walk down.
[time=3150] But if I say I will not remember him, look at verse 9, but if I say I will not remember him or speak anymore in his name, then in my heart it becomes like a burning fire, shut up in my bones and I am weary of holding it in and I cannot endure it.
[time=3164] Jeremiah says you know what, if I do what he says to do, nobody listens, they spit on me and tell me to shut up.
[time=3172] If I stop doing that then it wells up within me and I can't stand it.
[time=3180] And so God is the story progresses and you can read it right there and Jeremiah, God comes to him a second time, can you imagine?
[time=3186] And he says to Jeremiah I want you to sign up for a second tour, I want you to do it again.
[time=3194] I want you to go and be my voice, I want you to go and proclaim truth, I want you to go Jeremiah to these stiff-necked hardhearted people and call him back to what is right and Jeremiah says I'll go, I'll do it.
[time=3204] And he goes and he proclaims and he speaks and they throw him in a cistern.
[time=3210] They're so sick of hearing his voice, they're so hardened in their hearts they toss him in a muddy pit.
[time=3220] And finally they let him out and as the story progresses a third time God says, hey Jeremiah will you go and will you speak for me, will you call these people back to what is right and true.
[time=3236] And he does and he gives it everything he has and records would indicate that not one single person shoots him an email saying way to go.
[time=3248] Not one single person repents from their sin, nothing.
[time=3252] And then on the heels of that Jeremiah and the entire nation are taken captive and shipped off to Babylon where now a weirried but faithful prophet sits down by a stream and writes what is known as the great lament.
[time=3272] Did you know that? It's Jeremiah who writes the book of what? Lamentations.
[time=3278] Within which he says after all of that having seen all the hopes gone down the drain after seeing all the dreams crushed after giving everything he had and nothing coming back his way.
[time=3294] He says in Lamentations 3, he'll come up on the screen here for you. Lamentations 3, this weary big hearted prophet, he hasn't gotten cranky, he hasn't gotten bitter, he hasn't gotten welled up with disgust and anger toward God, it says in Lamentations 3.
[time=3310] Can I come up there? There you go. Thanks. Lamentations 3, 21. Yet this I call to mind and therefore I have hope.
[time=3320] Yet this I call to mind and therefore I have hope because of the Lord's great love we are not consumed for his compassion's never failed.
[time=3328] 23, it says they are new. After all he's been through, he's getting up in the morning saying praise God, his mercies are new every morning.
[time=3336] He says great is your faithfulness. Not a single person listened to me, nobody responded, I got thrown in pits, I got beaten and spit on, but you are a faithful God.
[time=3350] I say to myself the Lord is my portion, therefore I will wait for him.
[time=3358] And see you've got to know today that thousands of years later him enduring that in that fashion often encourages a young pastor like me, a guy like Mitch.
[time=3378] There are days when you just wonder why you're doing what you're doing and Jeremiah didn't know me and I don't know him, but here years and years and years and years later, you see, it's all working out for good.
[time=3394] His circumstantial? No. Kingdom good. Kingdom good because he was faithful to answer the call and those circumstances were difficult, great things got accomplished.
[time=3410] Would you just stand with us this morning? We're out of time, but I just want you to please, if you would, as you stand and as your heads are bowed, I just want to invite you, if you would, to please consider.
[time=3422] With your heads bowed and your eyes closed, would you please consider this road that he has had you on?
[time=3430] Maybe you could this week with a good friend, somebody from your A.B.F. or somebody from your small group or just your accountability partner, maybe with a spouse or even with your kids, you could just look back on the last ten years.
[time=3440] Maybe you could scroll back through the last five, maybe even take a closer look at the last year of your life.
[time=3448] And would you be willing to pinpoint the times of great suffering? Would you be willing to identify those moments of great confusion and would you as well be willing to identify his hand?
[time=3462] What he did? What he taught? What he brought to your heart and soul?
[time=3468] Would you be willing to see in that look back the goodness, him shaping you and forming you more into his image, maybe the lives that were touched, the hearts that got encouraged?
[time=3482] God, as we do that, as we think about doing that very thing this morning, we pray, God, that in doing that, we would be reminded of your goodness, of your faithfulness.
[time=3494] And in days when it seems really dark, when a road to walk seems almost non-existent, God, I pray, as you did with Marsha, that you would come alongside and put your hand on our backs, God, that you would be real to us, offering comfort and hope beyond anything we've ever imagined.
[time=3514] And we'll thank you for it. We believe you to be the God of all gods, we believe you to be sovereign in all that you do, we believe you to be supreme.
[time=3522] There are no mistakes. Everything that unfolds is something that you've wanted us to experience, and so God grow us, help us not to blame you, help us to realize that in the midst of it, you walk through each and every moment with us, and God in the end, help us to realize the great good that comes.
[time=3542] In your son's name we pray, and all the people agreed and said, Amen.
