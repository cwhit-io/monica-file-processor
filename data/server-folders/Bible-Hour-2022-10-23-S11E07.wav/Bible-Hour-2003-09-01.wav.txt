[time=137] We're gonna do three-part harmony, are you ready?
[time=140] Here we go, one, two, three, four, go.

[time=323] Real big.
[time=324] [MUSIC - 3 seconds]
[time=340] (audience applauds) - Hi, I'm Mitch, teaching pastor at Blackhawk Ministries, and I wanna thank you for joining us for our special with Tommy Walker, and we'll get back to him in just a moment.
[time=352] I'd like to update you on some things we have going on here at Blackhawk Ministries.
[time=356] First, we're so thankful that Huntington College is partnering with us to offer associate and bachelor degree level programs here in the evenings through their Excel program.
[time=367] And you can find out more about that by dialing the number on your screen.
[time=372] Also, we would love for you to come join us on Wednesday nights, we call it Common Ground.
[time=376] It's 6.45 to 8 p.m.
[time=378] We have a time of acoustic worship, and we're in a series right now that we've just started with the gospel of John.
[time=385] And it's just gonna be a wonderful time of digging into that gospel in the heart of someone who lived life with Jesus and paints a portrait of him that is just so relevant for us, even in today's culture.
[time=399] I'd like to thank you again for joining us.
[time=401] The message that you're about to hear flows out of the weekend that we had of outreach.
[time=407] We had a worship concert with Tommy and his band from his church.
[time=411] Almost every musician that you see and vocalist is professional.
[time=416] They're just having incredible hearts.
[time=418] They worship God with their lives.
[time=420] And what we did is we tried to do the same thing this last weekend.
[time=424] We reached out to the inner city, to Chapel Oaks, and many of you helped us.
[time=429] We had a little carnival there.
[time=431] We distributed some necessities that they had to have there.
[time=436] And it just grew the hearts.
[time=438] I think of both the givers and the receivers.
[time=441] And I call that God's boomerang love.
[time=443] So the message is about the parable of the sower.
[time=446] And it's about how God just continues to sow seed in our lives with his word and speaking to us and expressing his life to us.
[time=453] And then in turn, he'd like us to do the same.
[time=457] And so we either close the door to that, or we're shallow and we don't go very far with it, or we have a tendency to get wrapped up in the pleasures and the treasures and the worries of this world.
[time=470] Or we have a soft heart.
[time=472] And we're fruitful.
[time=474] And we make disciples and we point other people toward Jesus Christ.
[time=478] I wanna thank you again for joining us.
[time=479] And I hope that our efforts here today have helped your heart grow a little closer to God's.
[time=486] (gentle music)
[time=495] [MUSIC - 211 seconds]
[time=723] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 299 seconds]
[time=1030] I had somebody come up to me once and they said, tell me, I really like that one song, but why do you keep doing it over and over again?
[time=1037] I've got it, let's move on.
[time=1039] But you know what, there's something heavenly.
[time=1043] Would we say, holy, where are thee as the land?
[time=1048] That's what the angels are doing 24/7.
[time=1052] From now until ever and ever and ever.
[time=1057] They don't ever stop.
[time=1060] They don't ever say, hey, can we go to the next song?
[time=1063] I'm tired of this one.
[time=1064] Because he's so holy, because he's so worthy you just can't ever say it enough.
[time=1070] You can never get to the end of the song because it's infinite.
[time=1073] Lord, we join with the heavenly hosts.
[time=1079] We join with the great cloud of witnesses, Lord.
[time=1082] We've been joined with all the thousands of churches worshiping you in this moment throughout the world.
[time=1090] We sing holy.
[time=1092] Come on, let's sing it.
[time=1094] [MUSIC - 136 seconds]
[time=1236] You know why I wrote this song?
[time=1239] I wrote this song because I was in a time in my life of incredible doubt.
[time=1246] And just things were happening in my life and I was just like, "God, are you there?" I was just like, "I just don't know if I believe anymore." But I knew that deep, deep, deep, the deepest part of who I was, that Jesus was there. He was in me.
[time=1266] And so I just said, "I'm just going to write something that will just help me declare to myself and to the world around me and to my God."
[time=1277] I don't care. What happens? What it looks like? What people say to me?
[time=1283] I'm going to declare it, "I believe in you, Jesus, from now to forever."
[time=1292] And I just say that because I just believe there's somebody here and you're just in a time of doubt.
[time=1297] You don't even understand, just your mind constantly is searching and scanning some reason to doubt God.
[time=1303] You're just looking for trouble in your life and saying it.
[time=1309] But I think God just wants to reveal himself to you again as you step out in faith and just declare it.
[time=1316] But you've got to take the step. That's what faith is. It's a step.
[time=1320] And you just declare and say, "Lord, I do. I do. I do. I believe in you." And I believe God will reveal himself again in a fresh way.
[time=1330] Do you believe it? Can that happen? Can we sing it?
[time=1337] Come on, everybody. Here we go.
[time=1340] [MUSIC - 84 seconds]
[time=1433] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1438] Some say I'm a man of few words.
[time=1441] Always have been, I guess.
[time=1443] I'm not into greeting cards or flowers.
[time=1447] I just believe in saying what needs to be said and let my actions speak for me.
[time=1454] I'm a good father and I provide well for my family.
[time=1459] My youngest daughter, Amy, is a senior at Purdue this year.
[time=1463] We didn't think she'd get this far.
[time=1466] She suffers from anorexia and had to be hospitalized last year.
[time=1472] When we went to see her, she was so frail and tiny.
[time=1478] She dropped to 92 pounds.
[time=1483] She had these IVs and tubes sticking out of her.
[time=1488] And she was crying for attention.
[time=1491] Attention she wasn't getting from me.
[time=1496] She whispered to me, "Come on, say it, Dad.
[time=1503] You can't even say it now to me, can you?"
[time=1510] My little girl just wanted to hear Daddy say, "I love you."
[time=1517] My name is James Roberts.
[time=1521] And now I know real love speaks.
[time=1530] Can I pray real quick for us?
[time=1534] God, just make these words yours, not mine.
[time=1538] Touch every heart here.
[time=1541] That here's these words.
[time=1544] May your Holy Spirit penetrate each of us.
[time=1548] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1551] If you want to turn to Matthew 13, we're going to talk about the agriculture of the heart.
[time=1555] Matthew 13, Jesus tells the story.
[time=1557] We know it as the parable of the sower.
[time=1560] And I come from a family of farmers, although I am not a farmer.
[time=1565] In 1854, my great-great-great-grandfather homesteaded the land on which I now live.
[time=1570] And he farmed.
[time=1574] And about 60 years ago, my grandfather was out farming with his brother on that farm.
[time=1582] And they were both on a combine.
[time=1584] My grandfather was driving.
[time=1586] And his brother jumped off to catch a rabbit.
[time=1592] And you know, farmers, the one thing they don't want to come up against in a field is a rock or a boulder.
[time=1597] Some of them might damage the equipment, and we all know nothing's going to grow around that.
[time=1601] So my grandfather didn't know that he jumped off and chased the rabbit.
[time=1605] And about 60 years ago, my grandfather hit a boulder, a flesh, and it was his brother.
[time=1613] And he got out, and he saw him trapped in there.
[time=1621] And they rushed him to the hospital, and they thought he would die.
[time=1626] But a miraculous thing happened.
[time=1628] In the hospital, he made a full recovery.
[time=1631] And all he had to do was take this medication so there wouldn't be a blood clot go to as long as hard or spring kind of a thing.
[time=1637] Well, a nurse was supposed to make sure that he got that medication every day.
[time=1640] And he had this baseball glove out, and he looked at my grandfather and called him Rusty.
[time=1644] And they were going to be in business together.
[time=1646] They were going to be farmers together, and he was throwing that ball in the glove.
[time=1649] And he said, "Hey Rusty, I'm coming home today." But they also, the nurse forgot to give him his medication, and he died of a blood clot.
[time=1661] And that has been what I will call, because he said so.
[time=1668] A boulder in the heart of my grandfather, his whole life.
[time=1674] And I just want to ask you today, in the agriculture of your heart, what's your boulder?
[time=1681] Is there a defining moment in your life?
[time=1683] Is there something you're going through right now that's presenting you with the same situation that was presented to him?
[time=1689] That you're either going to do one or two things.
[time=1692] You're either going to hearten your heart toward God, or you're going to soften your heart toward God.
[time=1701] Maybe it's a spouse who left you. Maybe you're abused as a child verbally or physically.
[time=1711] Maybe you're thinking about leaving your spouse.
[time=1717] Maybe it's a financial deal, gone south.
[time=1721] Maybe it's a career, not going the way you wanted it to.
[time=1724] Maybe somebody doesn't love you the way you say would love you.
[time=1727] But whatever that is, that's a boulder in the agriculture of your heart.
[time=1730] And you come up against that, and that's a defining moment.
[time=1732] And you're either going to grow harder toward God, or you're going to grow softer toward God.
[time=1736] You're either going to fully surrender, or you're going to partially surrender.
[time=1741] You're either going to be fruitful or unfruitful.
[time=1746] And I want you to think about that, and before we read the parable, I want you to realize something about Palestinian farming.
[time=1752] First of all, they used a Babylonian design, which the yoke would be attached to the animals.
[time=1760] And then there was this cross-shaped tool that would be attached to that, and the horizontal part would use for steering.
[time=1768] And the vertical part would dig a hole in the ground as you would go, and you would scatter the seed 30 pounds to every half acre.
[time=1777] And it was like a drill back then when Jesus was talking.
[time=1781] So you want to drill the seed in the ground, right?
[time=1783] So it'll grow, you don't want to scatter and go away.
[time=1785] So you had this cross-shaped, and it would plow, very important that you get this.
[time=1789] It would plow as you would scatter the seed.
[time=1792] It would plow as the seed would get planted.
[time=1795] Alright, you with me?
[time=1797] And Jesus is having a lot of people following.
[time=1800] He's having a lot of people following 20,000 people, some scholars say, after the Sermon on the Mount.
[time=1806] And Jesus doesn't, when he gets him together, he doesn't tell him the four spiritual laws, he doesn't have an altar call, and those are wonderful things.
[time=1814] But he tells them a story, and it makes you want to ask why.
[time=1818] Why would he do that?
[time=1820] Why would he tell them a story?
[time=1822] 35% of all his teachings in the Gospels are parables.
[time=1825] And a parable means to throw alongside, it's an earthly truth and a spiritual truth thrown alongside each other.
[time=1832] And scholars say they had anywhere from one to three points.
[time=1836] Okay?
[time=1837] So they're getting this.
[time=1838] The story's going to tell them, they understand because they understand the physical truth clearly, but will they discover the spiritual truth?
[time=1846] And in your my life, whatever that boulder is, whatever that defining moment is, am I going to heart my heart or am I going to soften my heart?
[time=1853] And hey, one more thing before we go through this.
[time=1856] If you've grown up in the church and you've heard this parable and you say it doesn't apply to me, I'm going to challenge you to look at this differently.
[time=1863] Okay?
[time=1864] I don't think it's only about salvation.
[time=1868] And if you're here today and you don't know God, you haven't experienced God in your life.
[time=1874] You would say my life is defined as I've never fully surrendered my life.
[time=1878] I've never received his forgiveness from my sin.
[time=1880] I don't experience that.
[time=1882] He's not Lord of my life.
[time=1884] On my business card, I'm still CEO of my life.
[time=1886] I want you to listen to what Jesus Christ says to an audience that he's connecting to.
[time=1893] Okay?
[time=1894] Matthew 13, verse one there.
[time=1897] The same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake.
[time=1900] Such large crowds gathered around him that he got in a boat, see they're big, and he sat in it so he can be seen and heard while all the people stood on the shore.
[time=1908] And he told them many things in parable, saying, now parable is designed, C.H.
[time=1915] Dodd says, to twist the mind, to engage the mind.
[time=1920] Okay?
[time=1921] So Jesus doesn't just present truth and have you reject it.
[time=1924] He's going to engage the mind and have you think about what's going on.
[time=1928] C.H. Dodd even says it leaves you insufficient evidence.
[time=1930] You're going to go away thinking and pondering and wondering on what was just said.
[time=1934] Jesus said a farmer went out to sow a seed and as he was scattering the seed, some fell on the path and the birds came and ate it up.
[time=1941] Some fell on rocky places where it did not have much soil shallow.
[time=1945] It sprang up quickly because the soil was so shallow.
[time=1948] But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched and they withered because they had no root.
[time=1953] Other seed fell among the thorns which grew up and choked the plants.
[time=1957] Other seed fell on good soil where it produced a crop to 160 or 30 times what was sown.
[time=1965] He who has ears led him here.
[time=1970] A typical crop was tenfold in Palestine.
[time=1974] I think it's in Genesis 26.
[time=1976] It says Isaac got this bumper crop and was blessed by God and it was a hundredfold.
[time=1981] So Jesus is talking some pretty big numbers here but I want you to get the idea that it's attainable.
[time=1988] So the disciples came to him and asked why do you speak to the people in parables?
[time=1993] Just tell them what you want to tell them.
[time=1995] And Jesus replied, "The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you but not to them.
[time=2001] Whoever has will be given more and he will have an abundance, whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him."
[time=2008] In Mark 4, if you want to write it down, in Mark 4, this parable is also in Mark and it's also in Luke.
[time=2016] In Mark 4, it says that Jesus would continue to talk to these great crowds and parables and stories as much as they could understand.
[time=2024] But the disciples, he would explain everything.
[time=2028] And rabbis in the day would do that.
[time=2030] Teachers would do that.
[time=2031] They would teach in a broad general sense in stories generally to broad audiences so they could understand.
[time=2037] But as you would get closer to the teacher and as you would become more of a disciple, you would learn more.
[time=2043] He would tell you more.
[time=2045] And that's what that verse is saying.
[time=2046] As you get closer, as you become more of an insider to that teacher, you'll learn more.
[time=2052] So he says verse 13, this is why I speak to them in parables in quotes Deuteronomy here, those seeing they do not see,
[time=2059] though hearing they do not hear or understand.
[time=2062] And then in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah. This is Isaiah 6, 9, and 10.
[time=2067] You will be ever hearing but never understanding. You will be ever seeing but never perceiving.
[time=2071] For this people's heart, heart has become calloused.
[time=2075] They hardly hear with their ears and they have closed with their eyes.
[time=2079] Otherwise, they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn, and I would heal them.
[time=2086] But blessed are your eyes because they see your ears, because they hear, for I tell you the truth, many prophets and righteous men long to see what you see, but did not see it.
[time=2095] And to hear what you hear, but did not hear it.
[time=2099] Verse 15 otherwise.
[time=2101] If you have a King James version or any sb it might say less.
[time=2105] I'm going to talk about that. We have two camps.
[time=2107] This has become a difficult passage for many.
[time=2110] Some say, well, Jesus is talking in parables and stories so the people who aren't going to be in, they are not going to be in.
[time=2116] It's not, their hearts are callous. It's over.
[time=2119] It just tells them a story but the people who get it get it.
[time=2122] A lot of theologians say that. Not a lot of, I shouldn't say that. A lot of preachers say that, actually.
[time=2128] But there's another camp among scholars.
[time=2132] And that is that Jesus is really telling them a story, like I said earlier, to engage the mind.
[time=2137] So when they leave, he's got them.
[time=2140] Because if he just would have stated a few sentences, their hearts are callous.
[time=2143] They'd say, oh, yeah, I'm out on that deal.
[time=2146] But because he told them a story and because they got engaged and because they can interpret it and they can apply it on their own level,
[time=2152] now all of a sudden Jesus has got a hold of their hearts that he created.
[time=2158] Aspir Soty Hadi's, a great Bible scholar says that that word otherwise in the NIV or lust should be translated if perhaps.
[time=2166] Because if perhaps they would turn and they would see with those eyes and hear with those ears, I will heal them. I will forgive them.
[time=2175] And that's where I am. Remember how we talked about the plow and the cross and that tool and we steer it and it's digging the hole and the seas getting planted?
[time=2184] Well, if you notice in your Bibles right before this parable in Matthew and Mark, Jesus makes this statement about the Holy Spirit.
[time=2194] He says, if you want a one-way ticket south to hell, you want eternal separation from God.
[time=2203] Then reject the Holy Spirit's work in your life. Reject it.
[time=2210] So here's the deal. The Holy Spirit, we know this from John 1-9. We know it from a lot of passages.
[time=2218] The Holy Spirit is plowing the heart of every single human being he creates.
[time=2226] The Holy Spirit is plowing the heart. He's making you soft if you let him.
[time=2231] Jesus Christ, I'm not trying to carve up the Trinity, but Jesus Christ is sowing seed. His Word. His news about His Kingdom.
[time=2238] His Kingdom of the heart. His Kingdom of eternal and abundant life. His Kingdom of forgiveness. His Kingdom of grace. His Kingdom of mercy.
[time=2246] And Jesus says in John 15, one, "My Father, He's the gardener."
[time=2252] And so you have the very community of God at work and every person he chooses to create.
[time=2259] Last night checked, and we prayed this a couple days ago before we had an event here. Last night checked, not one person asked to be created.
[time=2268] God has brought you on to this scene of events for a purpose, and that purpose is to worship Him with your life and to love others into that Kingdom.
[time=2279] So let's look at how Jesus is going to explain this. He says, listen to what the parable of the sower means.
[time=2285] When anyone hears the message about the Kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away that which was sown in his heart.
[time=2292] This is seed sown along the path. You've got a picture coming up on the screen. It's a picture of that path with seed, and there's a door in its closed.
[time=2302] Because I think that picture is ideal for you to remember, and you've got a card in your bulletin, that that's the way the heart looks. See, the seed is sown.
[time=2311] The Holy Spirit is plowing your heart. He's making your hearts up, but you're saying, no. I'm going to close it.
[time=2320] Psalm 1710 says, they callus their hearts. You're doing that, and I'm doing that. Whatever that boulder is, whatever that barrier is to God we have in our relationship.
[time=2331] Even if we're a saved individual, maybe there's something we're holding back. Maybe there's something we're saying, no God, you can't have a part of this.
[time=2337] And if you're saying, I don't know where God is in this deal, and I'm not saying whatever you're talking about, I'm out.
[time=2344] But let me point out to this, Psalm 141 says, a fool says in his heart, there is no God. You're wrong.
[time=2353] I want you to come to grips with that today, if that's you.
[time=2360] Psalm 10, 4 says, in his pride, the wicked does not seek him. Hebrews 3 8 says, don't do that. Don't harden your heart.
[time=2372] Why? The Holy Spirit's doing this. He's making your hearts off. In Revelation 3 20, Jesus says, behold.
[time=2379] I stand at the door and knock. And if anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I'll come in and I'll eat with them and with me.
[time=2388] They'll be communion in whatever I'm holding back in my life. I can have communion and walk through it and build my intimacy with the living God of the universe. And you know what? He's done all he needs to do.
[time=2399] And if you're going to reject him, he's justified. He made you. He's justified to say an eternity.
[time=2408] No, you callus your own heart, you shut the door. So you actually have the audacity to say to God,
[time=2418] now you didn't plow my heart, man. And whatever area that is in your life, or maybe for your whole eternal and abundant life.
[time=2427] Well, look what he says next. He says, the one who received the seed that fell in rocky places is the man who hears the word at once
[time=2434] receives it with joy. But since he has no root, lasts only a short time.
[time=2439] When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, because of the kingdom, because of the message of life, he quickly falls away.
[time=2448] Shallow soil, rock underneath it, no root, withers and dies because, you know, it didn't work out for you.
[time=2456] Maybe this is you. Maybe you got saved. And you prayed a prayer at some event. Or you even got baptized.
[time=2464] But nothing ever took root. You've never trusted God with your life. Never. You're still seeing you all of your own life.
[time=2473] You've never trusted God. You just did that and you've treated it as life insurance.
[time=2479] Jeremiah 29, 13 says, hey, seek me and you will find me when you seek me with all of your heart. Not some, but all.
[time=2491] John 15, 7 and 8, Jesus says, remain in me and my words will remain in you. Dwell with me.
[time=2497] Let's do this thing and my words will dwell in you. And you will bear much fruit and you define fruit as disciples.
[time=2504] Well, Jesus goes on. You know, before I do, if this is you, why don't you make a commitment today to admit that you and say, I'm going to seek God.
[time=2519] I'm going to read the Bible. I'm going to pray. I'm going to come to this series on Roll Up. I'm going to get with somebody.
[time=2525] I'm going to start asking questions and I'm going to seek God with all of my heart. No holdbacks. And just see what happens.
[time=2531] Jesus goes on and he talks about a thorny heart. We had the heart or closed heart. We had a shallow heart and now we have kind of a worldly or worried heart.
[time=2542] Verse 22. The one who received the seed that fell among the thorns is the man who hears the word but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth, choke it, making it unfruitful.
[time=2553] This is me and this is my story. And many of you have heard it. A lot of you I found haven't.
[time=2566] I owned a company called Cruise International and we sold antique and classic cars in real estate at auction all over the world and museums.
[time=2573] And I got to tell you, I had this mission in life. I was going to make all this money and have all this wealth and have all these achievements and tell everybody in the end, you know what?
[time=2581] When I was pictures on the front of the magazines, I'd say, you know what? I'm a Christian. Wow.
[time=2587] Funny about 10 years in the marketplace and God blessed. I forgot the Christian part. I was just working on the worldly success part.
[time=2597] And July 1st, 1990, I remember somebody turned the lights out in the economy. And if you were there, you probably remember it too.
[time=2604] And the first thing to go in people's lives are collector cars. They don't need them.
[time=2607] And so I made a living off of that for a while, but then they weren't buying them and then it was over.
[time=2613] And I find myself making a lot of foolish decisions. My personal life was a mess as well. And I had just forgotten my roots.
[time=2622] The pursuit of the car, the pursuit of the watch, and I did all that and the pursuit of cash and the pursuit, maybe for you it might be a diploma or it might be prestige, you know?
[time=2632] But the pursuit of what this world has offered, the things that are temporary, trusting in the gifts, not the giver, relying on my giftedness, not my godliness, that got me into real trouble.
[time=2644] And I didn't know on a daily basis how I was going to survive. I didn't know how I was going to make payroll. I didn't know how the business would survive.
[time=2651] And to cap it all off, finally thinking about circumstances might be on my control. On July 1, 1992, I came to the private entrance of my office and I unlocked the first door and I got to the second door to unlock.
[time=2664] And the funny thing, it was already unlocked and that wasn't the case very often.
[time=2668] And I opened that door and I was greeted by two IRS agents with guns and badges.
[time=2672] I found out later there were a dozen of them combing my office. They had all my employees in the conference room.
[time=2677] And I thought it was a joke. I was late for our monthly all-employee office meeting and I thought it was a joke.
[time=2684] And so I asked the guys, this is a joke, and they said, "No, we appreciate you remaining calm during this raid."
[time=2690] I thought, "Rade." So partly because I can't stand to be controlled and partly because I saw it in the movies, I made a phone call.
[time=2700] And I called my attorney who also happened to be my uncle and my uncle had been investing in my life and discipling me on this concept of wisdom in the marketplace in spite of where I was in my life.
[time=2711] And he came out and he found out in a matter of minutes that the IRS had run a sting operation on us.
[time=2716] That means they tried to trick us into proving that we were money launderers.
[time=2719] That means you take money from criminals and you're allowed to buy cars.
[time=2723] And I wouldn't know how to do that and we didn't do that, and it took about ten years to have that go away.
[time=2730] And that night in my bedroom at 750 Greenbrier Street in Auburn, Indiana,
[time=2737] realizing the circumstances were beyond my control.
[time=2740] I got on my knees and not knowing what was going to happen the next day from that point forward,
[time=2746] I said, "God, I don't know what I'm saying for sure, but please make my business a ministry."
[time=2757] And I pictured myself moving out of the pilot seat and into the co-pilot seat and God moving in the pilot seat.
[time=2765] And I remember thinking back when I was nine years old and I used to walk to the church that was a half-mile dump that rode from my house.
[time=2774] And a great-great-grandfather built it a hundred years ago.
[time=2778] There were days when nobody would be in there and I could be alone.
[time=2782] And I'd walk down there at nine or ten years old and I'd walk to the altar and I'd pray all by myself.
[time=2788] And I'd say, "God, what do you want me to do with my life?" And I realized that I was not that boy.
[time=2799] Ten years in the marketplace hit me pretty hard.
[time=2803] And I was hold on pretty tight to the things of this world.
[time=2807] At the expense is Luke's 9.25 says, "I'm my own soul." It's funny, Deuteronomy 15.7 says, "Don't be hard, hard, or don't be tight-fisted with your stuff."
[time=2817] Open your hand.
[time=2820] If that's you right now, I ask you to consider that.
[time=2824] Joel 2.12 says, "Return to me." This is the Hebrew word for repentance.
[time=2831] It's return in the Old Testament. It's shubb.
[time=2834] Even now, and he says this to you, even now in your life, "Return to me with all your heart."
[time=2840] The fasting and weeping in mourning means a repentant heart.
[time=2844] And here's what you'll find.
[time=2847] That God gives grace to the humble.
[time=2853] And that's what this weekend has been about.
[time=2855] But God opposes the proud.
[time=2859] The audacity to say to the Spirit of God, "You've never plowed my heart."
[time=2865] The audacity to say to Jesus Christ, "You've never so seated in my life." The audacity to say to the Father who created you, "You don't garden my heart."
[time=2875] And if you're in the kingdom, and you love God, whatever that is,
[time=2881] whatever that boulder that barrier is in your life, give it to him.
[time=2887] Because he continues to sow seed.
[time=2889] When you said you got saved, you know, he's still sow and seed.
[time=2894] He's still plowing your heart, and he'll do it for eternity.
[time=2898] And every circumstance is another opportunity to grow in your intimacy with God.
[time=2903] St. Corinthians 9.10 says, "He who supplies the seed to the sower will also supply and increase your store of seed, who enlarge the harvest of your righteousness." And that's disciples.
[time=2917] James 1.21 says, "Humbly, except the word that's planted in you." 1 Peter 1.23 says, "For you have been born again if you've humbled your heart to God and received his grace, not of perishable seed, but of imperishable seed, the living, enduring word of God." As Tommy and the team to come up, Revelation 3.7 says that
[time=2946] Jesus has the key.
[time=2953] And he says, "What he unlocks, no one can lock.
[time=2957] What he unlocks, no one can lock.
[time=2962] What he opens, no one can shut.
[time=2968] What he opens, no one can shut." And I want to invite you now, if you come on up, I want to invite you now as they sing, to submit to God what that is in your life, what that boulder or that barrier is in your heart.
[time=2984] Let's bring you to a defining moment, either hard in your heart or soften your heart, or surrender, or remain un-surrendered, or to just partially surrender.
[time=2992] One foot in the world, one foot out.
[time=2995] God loves you.
[time=2997] And God will do it all.
[time=2998] And that's the meaning of grace.
[time=3000] All you got to do is humble your heart to him and say, "God, take it.
[time=3006] Take it." Jeremiah 14.22.
[time=3011] You know, we need rain to grow things in our heart and grow things in life.
[time=3015] Jeremiah 14.22 says, "You know, do the rains come down by themselves?
[time=3020] Do the idols do that?" And God says, "No.
[time=3024] I do that." Jesus called himself the seed in John 12.24, when he said, "You know, unless a seed falls to the ground and dies, there'll be no plants that grow out of it." It's an organic kind of thing.
[time=3038] And 2,000 years ago, Jesus Christ died on a cross.
[time=3042] God in the flesh, for every single person here.
[time=3046] And like a seed, he went in a tomb, his dead body.
[time=3051] And he resurrected and he lives today.
[time=3054] And 10,000 miles from here, there's an empty tomb to prove that.
[time=3059] So I'll ask you, will you consider whatever it is in your life, giving it to God?
[time=3066] I think the gospel can be summed up in 12 words.
[time=3069] The life leads to his death, his death leads to my life.
[time=3073] What a Savior.
[time=3099] Who asks him to be new?
[time=3106] I'll let you know what a Savior can do.
[time=3115] But he changes softly in my place.
[time=3125] God in place will seal my heart with his blood.
[time=3136] Hallelujah.
[time=3140] God of sin.
[time=3144] Hallelujah.
[time=3523] Seek me, find me, I will give you more.
[time=3529] Loosen your grip, return to me, I will restore.
[time=3536] When your heart is open into your life, holy rain I'll report, I will pour.
[time=3543] God, we pray these things in Jesus' mighty name, amen.
[time=3546] Let's thank Tommy and the man for one more time.
[time=3550] Hallelujah.
[time=3560] You dismissed.
[time=3562] Hallelujah.
