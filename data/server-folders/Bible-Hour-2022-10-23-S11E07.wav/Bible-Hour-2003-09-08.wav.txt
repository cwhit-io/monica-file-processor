[time=356] - Let's pray together, Father.
[time=362] Only a guy like you is worthy of our praise.
[time=366] Lord, we are excited to gather together today.
[time=368] Excited to sing your praises.
[time=372] Excited to learn more about who you are.
[time=375] To learn more about who you desire for us to become.
[time=378] Lord, in your words, Psalm 115 says,
[time=384] "Not to us, O Lord, not to us be the glory, "but to you, be the honor and the glory "and the power and the praise forever." That's why we're here and that's why we sing.
[time=395] In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[time=604] - Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, pastor here at Blackhawk, and it's great to be with you again.
[time=609] I was thinking this morning on my way over here to spend this time with you.
[time=613] I can't believe sometimes what God allows us here at Blackhawk to actually see and be a part of.
[time=620] And it's not just me, if you were to talk to anybody on our team, and you got them to just begin to share with you the things that we see happening each and every day, each and every week, the hand of God at work in the lives of people, it's truly amazing.
[time=635] I met a couple Sunday who have been coming for three weeks from Decatur.
[time=640] I don't know quite how long that, I think it's about a 45-minute drive, and they're coming week after week now from Decatur.
[time=648] They're so encouraged by the people here in this place and the message and the things they seek God doing.
[time=655] We have a family who comes every week from defiance, Ohio.
[time=659] They came for several weeks, then friends of theirs started to come.
[time=662] Then their dad and mom began to come.
[time=664] Now we've got 15 or so folks coming from East Ohio every week and already now beginning to be a part of this family.
[time=672] I met a couple two weeks ago who last summer, this past summer began to come from Bluffton.
[time=677] And they just, they make the drive every week because they're so encouraged by what they see taking place.
[time=683] They're so encouraged and thankful for what God's doing in their lives through the ministries and the people of Blackhawk.
[time=690] And it just blows me away.
[time=692] I met a guy last week.
[time=694] He and his wife and their kids, he came to faith.
[time=698] He came to a point of full surrender, just I think two or three weeks ago at Common Ground.
[time=704] And now they're coming to Common Ground every Wednesday night and now they're coming on Sunday mornings.
[time=708] And I get to see this guy and his wife and his kids now beginning to grow in their faith because of what God allows us to be a part of here.
[time=717] I was this morning at a local restaurant where we've just some of the guys on our team have just become friends with an entire staff at this local restaurant.
[time=726] And three or four of those gals are coming to church every Wednesday night, listening to Mitch as he teaches through the book of John and God's doing amazing things in their lives.
[time=737] One of them came to faith, came to a point of full surrender just last week.
[time=742] And we get to see all of this.
[time=745] And it just blows us away and we're so grateful.
[time=748] And I think about that and I think, you know what, there are those of you out there.
[time=752] And you too need to be encouraged.
[time=756] And I wanna just invite you again.
[time=759] We have and you'll see today started a new series called Real Love.
[time=763] And there are people out there and you're watching this right now and you haven't ever experienced it.
[time=770] Real love, that is.
[time=772] You've never tasted it.
[time=773] You've never had it extended to you.
[time=775] You don't even know what it's like to really, really be loved deeply.
[time=782] And we want that for you.
[time=784] We really would love the privilege of introducing you to real love.
[time=789] And as you listen today, I hope that your heart will be open.
[time=792] And I hope that maybe for the first time you'll realize that it's available.
[time=797] Not in the places that we often go to for it.
[time=800] It's available in the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=803] God is a God of love.
[time=805] And he has given love in an amazing way.
[time=808] And today as you hear about that, we hope that number one, that maybe your heart and eyes will be opened for the very first time as to what that's like and how available that is for you.
[time=819] Secondly, as you watch and listen, our hope is that you might be willing to come.
[time=824] We'd love to meet you.
[time=825] We'd love to put loving arms around you.
[time=828] We'd love for you to be able to see and witness these things that we're seeing and being a part of every single day around here.
[time=836] So we hope you enjoy today.
[time=839] We hope to see you in the future.
[time=841] And God bless.
[time=842] Hopefully we'll see you soon.
[time=844] (upbeat music) - My divine real love is passion.
[time=854] Passion that won't go away.
[time=856] - I don't know, it's like a special feeling.
[time=859] - Real love is giving to other people,
[time=867] having the interest of others before yourself.
[time=872] - The person who is understanding, caring, thoughtful of others, not just to self.
[time=878] About 99 years old walking hand-in-hand down the street.
[time=883] That's real love.
[time=887] (gentle music) - Honesty, trust, and deep caring.
[time=894] - Good companionship.
[time=897] - No, it's probably nonexistent.
[time=903] (gentle music) - You can't wait to find it, it's just an emotion.
[time=912] You can't wait to find it, it's hard, you know?
[time=914] You just feel it.
[time=915] How do you feel it or what it means?
[time=917] That's how you feel, you know?
[time=919] - Don't believe in it, it's just a word.
[time=923] - How long that you've been with somebody?
[time=928] (gentle music) - You might get lucky if that's what you want to call it and last forever, but most people I know that after four or five, six years, they're getting pretty bored.
[time=939] They won't tell you about it, but they make up for it in children or in their business.
[time=943] And before you know, one of them is blaming the other one for not spending enough time with them.
[time=947] (gentle music) - That's an hard question.
[time=955] I mean, you know, I guess my wife.
[time=959] - My girlfriend?
[time=961] (laughs) (gentle music) - Well, I'd say my brother was a good example of a brother we love.
[time=971] He's been a good brother.
[time=973] (gentle music) - Calling my mom and dad, they've been married for 55 years.
[time=978] - Well, I've been lucky, I've had a number up with him.
[time=981] (gentle music) - Um, I can't say him.
[time=985] (laughs) Sorry to say I can't say him, probably my dad mostly.
[time=989] (gentle music)
[time=1004] - Infatuation.
[time=1005] Looks.
[time=1006] - Feeling.
[time=1008] Self-gratification.
[time=1013] - Track goodness.
[time=1016] - I think people mistake attention for real love.
[time=1019] A lot of attention.
[time=1021] (gentle music) - Oh, all kinds of things today.
[time=1030] You know, I just think people are going in all the wrong places, looking for love.
[time=1034] They just are trying all kinds of things that they hope will satisfy, and they don't.
[time=1040] - Flings, one nice dance.
[time=1042] (laughs) Lost.
[time=1045] - We're always willing to taste something.
[time=1048] We want something new.
[time=1049] We want to try, maybe this is the answer, maybe that's the answer.
[time=1053] So if you're lucky enough and you have the options in life to go taste something here and taste something here, then life is this.
[time=1059] It's real simple.
[time=1060] It's a series of events to let you know what you don't want.
[time=1063] Don't want that.
[time=1064] - I will satisfy your soul.
[time=1068] - Wow, interesting.
[time=1076] Real love.
[time=1078] Real love and our thanks to the programming team for putting that together, especially Jeannie Roars and the work that she did.
[time=1086] Real love.
[time=1087] Why a six week series on real love?
[time=1089] Somebody asked me just the other day.
[time=1090] Why a six week series on real love?
[time=1094] Wow, let me answer that by saying this.
[time=1096] While it's true that we want to help husbands better love their wives, and while it is true that we would hope to see wives better understand real love and the way that plays out with husbands while we would want friendships to obviously benefit from the presence of a love that is real, while each of us would admit the need for help in really loving the unlovely, though we'd want families, by all means, to be strengthened by the presence and the practice of real love, while all of that is what we would hope might come from a biblical study of love above and beyond at all, is the hope that every person here can be clear and personally aware of its source, that every person in this place could in the weeks to come develop a clear personal awareness of real love's source, to know where and with whom real love originates and to get clear, crystal clear on what it is, real love, how it lives and how it can be maintained and how real love can be grown and expressed.
[time=1167] The mailer that we sent out to three or four different zip codes this week, thousands of people were able to get this in their home.
[time=1174] I think it says it pretty well.
[time=1175] For so many of us today, our experience with love has been so very disappointing.
[time=1181] Some of us believe that it can be bought.
[time=1183] Some see it as only a feeling that comes and goes and sadly there are many others who have never once in their entire life experienced it.
[time=1192] Maybe, as the lady said on the interview, we've been looking in all the wrong places.
[time=1198] So, in order to find it,
[time=1204] in order to understand it, real love better, we need to go back to the beginning, the very beginning.
[time=1212] That's right, you say the beginning of what?
[time=1213] Well, the beginning of everything is where we find the origination of real love.
[time=1218] Turn your Bibles to Genesis, chapter one, that's right.
[time=1222] Genesis chapter one, you see the beginning of real love is found in the midst of right in the middle of this world's beginning.
[time=1232] In fact, you see the origin of real love in the first five words of the Bible.
[time=1238] And I'm glad you're turning there.
[time=1241] Most of you could just look up here in with me, say and recite those first five words, the first five words that contain the origination of real love.
[time=1251] First five words of the Bible.
[time=1253] Here we go, in the beginning God, God what?
[time=1260] Created, God created.
[time=1263] In the beginning God created, people, that's it.
[time=1268] That is the beginning of this amazing thing called real love.
[time=1275] And I'm gonna ask you if you would this morning to just cut me a little slack here and give me the opportunity to share with you something that is a little bit more lengthy than I would normally do in this fashion.
[time=1287] But really trust me on this one, I think you'll appreciate it.
[time=1292] And I wanna read these words to you because it is the, these words are written in only a way that Max Lakato could write them.
[time=1300] And I wanna share with you this morning the truth behind the beginning of real love.
[time=1309] In the beginning God created.
[time=1311] Listen and begin to understand maybe for the first time how this thing really worked.
[time=1318] In the beginning God created.
[time=1320] Behind it all was a choice, a deliberate decision and informed move, he didn't have to do it, but he chose to.
[time=1328] He knew the price, he saw the implications, he was aware of the consequences.
[time=1333] We don't know when he decided to do it, we can't know, not just because we weren't there, because time was not there.
[time=1339] When did not exist, nor did tomorrow or yesterday or next time, for there was no time.
[time=1347] We don't know when he thought about making the choice because, but we do know that he made it.
[time=1352] He didn't have to do it, he chose to, he chose to create.
[time=1357] In the beginning God created.
[time=1361] With one decision, history began, existence became measurable.
[time=1366] Out of nothing came light, out of light came day, then came sky and earth.
[time=1370] And on this earth a mighty hand went to work.
[time=1374] Canyons were carved, oceans were dug, mountains erupted out of flatlands, stars were flung, a universe sparkled.
[time=1382] Our sun became just one of millions, our galaxy became just one of thousands.
[time=1387] Planets invisibly tethered to suns roared through space at breakneck speeds, stars blazed with a heat that could melt our planet in seconds.
[time=1396] The hand behind it was mighty, he is mighty.
[time=1400] And with this might he created, as naturally as a bird sings and a fish swims he created.
[time=1406] Just as an artist can't not paint and a runner can't not run, he couldn't not create.
[time=1412] He was the creator, through and through.
[time=1414] He was the creator, a tireless dreamer and designer from the palette of the ageless artist came inimitable splenders.
[time=1423] Before there was a person to see it, his creation was pregnant with wonder.
[time=1427] Flowers didn't just grow, they blossomed.
[time=1430] Chicks weren't just born, they hatched.
[time=1434] Salmon didn't just swim, they leaped.
[time=1436] Mundaneness found no home in his universe.
[time=1442] He must have loved it.
[time=1445] Creators, relish creating.
[time=1448] I'm sure his commands were delightful.
[time=1451] Hippo, you can't walk, you'll waddle.
[time=1454] Hyena, a bark is too plain.
[time=1457] Let me show you how to laugh.
[time=1458] Look, raccoon, I've made you a mask.
[time=1461] Come here, giraffe, let's stretch out that neck a bit.
[time=1464] And on and on he went giving the clouds their puff, giving the oceans their blue, giving the trees their sway, giving the frogs their leap and croak.
[time=1473] The mighty wed with the creative and creation was born.
[time=1478] He was mighty, he was creative and he was love.
[time=1484] Even greater than his might and deeper than his creativity was one all-consuming characteristic.
[time=1490] Love, water must be wet.
[time=1493] A fire must be hot.
[time=1496] You can't take the wet out of water and still have water.
[time=1499] You can't take the heat out of fire and still have fire.
[time=1502] In the same way, you can't take the love out of this one who lived before time and still have him exist, for he was and is love.
[time=1512] Prope deep within and explore every corner, search every angle, love is all you find.
[time=1516] Go to the beginning of every decision he has ever made and you'll find it, go to the end of every story he has told and you'll see it.
[time=1523] Love, no bitterness, no evil, no cruelty, just love, flawless love, passionate love, vast and pure love.
[time=1531] He is love.
[time=1533] As a result, an elephant has a trunk with which to drink, a kitten has a mother from which to nurse, a bird has a nest in which to sleep, the same God who was mighty enough to carve out the canyon is tender enough to put hair on the legs of the Matterhorn fly to keep it warm.
[time=1553] The same force that provides symmetry to the planet's guides the baby kangaroo to its mother's pouch before the mother knows it is born, but it wasn't enough.
[time=1565] His greatest work hadn't been completed.
[time=1567] One final masterpiece was needed before he would stop.
[time=1571] Look to the canyons to see the creator's splendor, touch the flowers and see its delicacy.
[time=1577] Listen to the thunder and hear his power, but gaze on this, the zenith, this last thing and witness all three and more.
[time=1588] Imagine with me what may have taken place on that day.
[time=1597] Lucado writes about this day, this moment in the garden.
[time=1601] He placed one scoop of clay upon another until a form lay lifeless on the ground.
[time=1609] All of the garden's inhabitants paused to witness the event, hawks hovered, giraffes stretched, trees bowed, butterflies paused on petals and watched.
[time=1619] You will love me, nature, God said, I made you that way.
[time=1624] You will obey me universe for you were designed to do so.
[time=1627] You will reflect my glory, skies, for that is how you were created, but this one will be like me.
[time=1636] This one, you and me, he said we'll be able to choose.
[time=1642] All were silent as the creator reached into himself
[time=1652] and removed something yet unceded.
[time=1655] A seed, it's called choice, the seed of choice.
[time=1659] Creation stood in silence and gazed upon the lifeless form.
[time=1663] An angel spoke, but what if he chooses not to love?
[time=1668] The creator finished, come, I will show you.
[time=1672] Unbound by today, God and the angel walked into the realm of tomorrow.
[time=1677] There, see the fruit of the seed of choice, both the sweet and the bitter.
[time=1682] The angel gasped at what he saw.
[time=1684] Spontaneous love, voluntary devotion, chosen tenderness, never had he seen anything like these.
[time=1691] He felt the love of the atoms.
[time=1692] He heard the joy of even her daughters.
[time=1695] He saw the food and the burden shared.
[time=1697] He absorbed the kindness and marvel at the warmth.
[time=1700] Heaven has never seen such beauty, my Lord, truly.
[time=1703] This is your greatest creation, but you've only seen the sweet.
[time=1709] Now, witness the bitter, a stench, envelop the pair.
[time=1714] The angel turned in horror and proclaimed, what is it?
[time=1719] The creator spoke only one word, selfishness.
[time=1725] The angel stood speechless as they passed through centuries of repugnance.
[time=1729] Never had he seen such filth, rot in hearts, ruptured promises for gotten loyalties.
[time=1733] Children of the creation wandering blindly in lonely labyrinths, this is the result of choice, the angel asked, yes, they will forget you?
[time=1744] Yes, they will reject you?
[time=1746] Yes, they'll never come back.
[time=1749] Some will, most won't.
[time=1754] What will it take to make them listen?
[time=1757] The creator walked on in time further and further into the future until he stood by a tree, a tree that would be fashioned into a cradle, even then he could smell the hay that would surround him.
[time=1770] With another step into the future, he paused before another tree, it stood alone, a stubborn ruler of a bald hill, the trunk was thick and the wood was strong, soon it would be cut, soon it would be trimmed, soon it would be mounted on the stony brow of another hill, and soon he would be hung on it.
[time=1789] He felt the wood rub against a back, he did not yet wear.
[time=1795] Will you go down there?
[time=1797] The angel asked, I will.
[time=1799] Is there no other way?
[time=1801] There is not.
[time=1803] Wouldn't it be easier to not plant the seed?
[time=1806] Wouldn't it be easier to not give the choice?
[time=1809] It would, the creator spoke slowly, but to remove the choice is to remove the love.
[time=1816] It must be done, he said, and withdrew, but as he stepped back in time, he heard the cry that he would someday himself scream, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" He wrenched at tomorrow's agony.
[time=1835] The angel spoke again, it would be less painful the creator interrupted softly, but it wouldn't be love.
[time=1842] They stepped into the garden again, the maker looked earnestly at the clay creation a monsoon of love swelled up within him, he had died for the creation before he had made him.
[time=1855] God's form bent over the sculptured face and breathed, dust stirred on the lips of the new one, the chest rose cracking the red mud, the cheeks fleshed, a finger moved and then eye opened, but more incredible than the moving of the flesh was the stirring of the spirit.
[time=1874] Those who could see the unseen gasp, perhaps it was the wind who said it first, perhaps what the star saw that moment is what has made it blink ever since, maybe it was left to an angel to whisper it, it looks like, it appears so much like it's him.
[time=1891] The angel wasn't speaking of the face, the features or the body, he was looking inside at the soul.
[time=1899] It's eternal, gasped another.
[time=1902] Within the man, God had placed a divine seed, a seed of himself, the God of might, had created earth's mightiest, the creator had created, not a creature, but another creator and the one who had chosen to love had created one who could love in return.
[time=1923] Now, it's our choice.
[time=1936] Love, real love.
[time=1939] And as these six weeks unfold, boy, I hope you get this.
[time=1944] I hope as a foundation for all that you'll hear and all that we'll talk about, but this morning you will be so very clear on this.
[time=1951] Real love started with God.
[time=1954] He chose it first, he gave it first.
[time=1957] Real love has always been is and always will be God, period.
[time=1964] God is love, it begins with him, it is sustained by him, it is meaningfully offered and realized only in and through him.
[time=1973] And let's just take a few minutes, can we?
[time=1976] And let's just go to the scriptures, turn with me to first John chapter four.
[time=1980] Let's just take some time, we're gonna keep your fingers busy this morning.
[time=1983] As we just are reminded of what the word of God says about this notion of God being love, God possessing love, love beginning with God.
[time=1994] Look at first John, back toward the back of your Bible, just before you get to Jude and Revelation, you'll find first, second, and third John.
[time=2002] First John chapter four, verses seven and eight.
[time=2010] Look with me there, it says, "Beloved, "let us love one another for love is from God, "and everyone who loves is born of God, "and knows God, the one who does not love, "does not know God for." Here you go, God is love, he is the essence people, he is the embodiment of love.
[time=2034] Go back to your Old Testament, go back to Psalm, would you?
[time=2036] Flip back, kind of just open your Bible to the middle and usually you hit Psalm, go to Psalm 86.
[time=2042] Go to Psalm 86 verse five.
[time=2051] Flip on back there to the book of Psalms and we're at the 86th Psalm, verse five.
[time=2058] It says for you, David here, the Psalmist says for you Lord, are good and ready to forgive and abundant in loving kindness to all who call upon you, abundant in loving kindness.
[time=2073] Let me just real quick, we're gonna see that word several more times, let me just give you a picture of abundant, if you read your Bible, if you're familiar at all with scripture, you hear that word again and again and again.
[time=2084] He is abundant in loving kindness.
[time=2086] The word in the original language, kind of paints a picture if you will of a cup, you just picture yourself holding a cup, all right?
[time=2093] You've got a cup in your hand, it's under the faucet, you've got it on, the water's running into the cup and the cup is filling up and up and up and now the water gets to the top and now the water is what?
[time=2105] Overflowing, the water is running over and you're not gonna turn off the faucet, the water's just gonna keep running and the water and the cup's gonna keep overflowing.
[time=2115] It's abundant, that's his love.
[time=2119] He is abundant, it says in loving kindness.
[time=2123] Go over to Psalm 103, just a few pages over, Psalm 103, I believe 11, is that right?
[time=2130] Psalm 103, 11, Psalm 103, 11 says for us, high, great thought here, for as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his loving kindness toward those who fear him and then go back to Exodus, back to the beginning, just past Genesis, you go to Exodus 34, turn back there to Exodus 34, an amazing thing is transpiring here in Exodus 34.
[time=2156] If you'll remember Moses has already come up to the mountain once, he's received the 10 commandments, God etches them on these two tablets.
[time=2165] Moses comes and descends from the hill, back to the people of Israel who are absolutely an utter rebellion, hard-hearted rebellion, they have turned against God, they are complaining, he throws the stones, they break, now he's back up on the mountain and Exodus 34 getting two new tablets.
[time=2182] God's gonna come at it with him one more time and it says in Exodus 34, six, God here revealing himself to Moses, then the Lord said, you see it there?
[time=2194] Exodus 34, six, then the Lord's passed by, then the Lord passed by in front of him and proclaimed, the Lord, the Lord God, compassionate and gracious, you see it there?
[time=2207] Compassionate and gracious, slow to anger and, oh there's that word again, abounding in loving kindness and truth who keeps loving kindness for thousands who forgives iniquity.
[time=2222] Go on to Jeremiah 31, go to the book of Jeremiah, Jeremiah 31, three, in fact just read this one on the screen with me, okay, Jeremiah 31, three, read this with me, it says the Lord appeared to him from afar saying, I have loved you.
[time=2236] What a great truth here and what a great description of love, God's love, real love, it says I have loved you with an everlasting love.
[time=2246] Therefore I have drawn you with loving kindness.
[time=2250] You see, God's love, real love has no beginning, it has no end, it is an everlasting love and with that everlasting love, he draws you and he draws me to himself with loving kindness.
[time=2264] Ephesians two, three to four.
[time=2267] Go back to the New Testament, Ephesians.
[time=2269] First and second Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians.
[time=2273] When I got saved, when I came to Christ, when I fully surrendered my own life, 20 years ago, this week, in fact, this was a verse or two, this was a passage here in Ephesians two that just jumped off the page to me.
[time=2288] I could not believe what I was reading.
[time=2292] I could not fathom this kind of love.
[time=2296] Ephesians two, three, it says among them, we too all formally lived, everybody in this room.
[time=2303] Prior to full surrender to Jesus Christ, we've known this, lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind.
[time=2314] And we're by nature, children of wrath, even as the rest, but God being rich in mercy because of his great love,
[time=2325] his everlasting love, his abundant love.
[time=2330] But God being rich in mercy because of his great love
[time=2336] with which he loved us.
[time=2337] And then verse five says, even when we were dead and our transgressions made us alive together with Christ.
[time=2344] And then what did Jesus himself say in the gospels?
[time=2347] Look at John, or just look to the screen, John 15, 13.
[time=2351] Jesus describes real love.
[time=2352] Jesus gives you a picture of what love looks like.
[time=2355] Jesus said greater love has no one than this, that one laid down his life for his friends.
[time=2364] There's love, and Jesus did it, didn't he?
[time=2369] Real love, we just sang about it so powerfully.
[time=2372] For God so loved the world that he gave.
[time=2377] Hey folks, there's a key word right there in this whole discussion.
[time=2381] If you wanna really get this close to who you are, if you wanna really take this truth in and really kind of rub it up against who you are and how you live, get used to the word gave.
[time=2390] Get used to the idea of giving.
[time=2392] Get used to the idea that real love has everything to do with that word.
[time=2399] He loved you so much that he gave.
[time=2403] His only begotten son that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
[time=2408] And then I was thinking, you know, we started in 1 John 4, let's end there.
[time=2414] End this one point, don't get too excited there.
[time=2416] 1 John 4, go back there, this is amazing.
[time=2421] We started this whole look through the scriptures on this one idea of God being loved.
[time=2425] We started with 1 John 4, 7, and 8.
[time=2427] Well look what it says in 1 John 4, 9.
[time=2429] By this, it won't be on the screen, just turn there if you will.
[time=2432] 1 John 4, 9.
[time=2433] By this, the love of God was manifested in us that God has sent his only begotten son to the world so that we might live through him.
[time=2445] That's real love, people.
[time=2450] His love given to you.
[time=2453] And so we've got to pause and just ask you, what are you doing with it today?
[time=2461] God is love, it began with him.
[time=2465] It is sustained by him, it is offered through him, and he has given it to you, you know him today.
[time=2470] What are you doing with it?
[time=2472] How are you choosing?
[time=2474] How are you deciding?
[time=2476] How are you posturing yourself?
[time=2478] How are you giving?
[time=2479] With this real love that comes from God that's made manifest in you through Jesus Christ.
[time=2487] How are you handling this love that he's made available to you?
[time=2493] Well let's just make sure we're defining it, okay?
[time=2497] In a way this morning and we'll just kind of jump off from here on into the next few weeks, just a simple definition.
[time=2504] And I hope if you're writing some stuff down, you'll just write this down and kind of look at this and think through this with me.
[time=2509] Would you?
[time=2509] Real love defined, okay?
[time=2511] Let's just look at it.
[time=2513] Real love defined.
[time=2515] You know, based upon what we've seen so far this morning from the Scriptures themselves, it's safe to say that real love is this.
[time=2522] You're ready?
[time=2523] Real love is God's love.
[time=2526] Real love, okay?
[time=2529] If your heart is longing for it this morning, if in your life you sense that it's missing.
[time=2536] If as you look at your relationships, when you look at your home, when you look at what is going on in the lives of those around you, if you sense an absence of it, please be reminded this morning.
[time=2547] Okay, as simple as it sounds, it is a profound truth, especially in light of this culture, which is screaming to you the exact opposite because it says to you and I every day and every afternoon and every evening on TV that real love is viable.
[time=2565] You can purchase it, that real love is available to you on a magazine rack or at some internet site.
[time=2572] Real love, they say, real love, what gets communicated is that you can find it somehow, some way and somebody else.
[time=2579] But please see this morning and be reminded or see it for the first time that real love is God.
[time=2590] Real love is God's love.
[time=2594] It's not something you can muster.
[time=2596] It's not something you can work harder at to dig up more of.
[time=2599] No, it's not about you.
[time=2600] You can't get to it.
[time=2602] You can't put your, no, it's God's love.
[time=2605] Keep going, received and embraced.
[time=2614] Have you, have you, have you received God's love?
[time=2619] Have you embraced God's love?
[time=2627] Have you come to that place, that point in your life where you realize in and of yourself your sinfulness separates you from God?
[time=2637] Have you come to that place where you have realized that the creator, the maker of all, the God of this universe loved you so much he sent his son to be a sacrifice for your sin?
[time=2647] Have you accepted that?
[time=2649] Have you fully surrendered your heart and life to him?
[time=2652] And in so doing, finally experienced real love.
[time=2658] Because that right there, see people?
[time=2660] That right there, that's the only way.
[time=2663] You and I can ever be one.
[time=2667] You and I can ever be those who would pass that on.
[time=2672] Whatever it is you're trying to do over here, it's not love, it's not real love.
[time=2678] Real love is God's love, received and embraced.
[time=2682] And then when you've done that, then you and I get the opportunity as Christ followers to give it freely, sacrificially and often.
[time=2692] Real love is God's love, received and embraced, then given freely, sacrificially and often.
[time=2699] Let's just jump in there real quick.
[time=2700] What do you say, three practical things to leave with this morning.
[time=2703] Three things you can write down right here that are the very essence of this definition and they in and of themselves provide you and I with very practical opportunities to experience and give real love.
[time=2715] Number one, write it down.
[time=2716] People, real love is given freely.
[time=2719] Not say it with me, not earned.
[time=2722] Real love is not earned.
[time=2727] If you just real quick, look at 1 Corinthians 13.
[time=2730] Would you do that?
[time=2731] It won't be on the screen.
[time=2732] Go to 1 Corinthians 13.4.
[time=2733] This classic chapter, this classic passage on love,
[time=2739] it says in 1 Corinthians 13.4, watch this now.
[time=2743] Here's the biblical definition, if you will, of love.
[time=2746] Love is patient, love is kind, it is not jealous, love does not brag and it is not arrogant.
[time=2752] Love does not act on becomingly, it does not seek its own, it is not provoked, it does not take into account a wrong suffered.
[time=2759] Love does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth, it bears all things, it believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
[time=2767] And doesn't say there at the end of verse seven, as long as something's coming back at me.
[time=2775] I mean, do you see the word if?
[time=2779] Yes or no?
[time=2782] Do you see the word because?
[time=2786] Yes or no?
[time=2788] No.
[time=2789] See, love just is, it just is patient, it just is kind,
[time=2796] it just is those things because it's his, it just is.
[time=2801] In 1 Corinthians 13, that whole passage is in the present tense in the Greek, it indicates an ongoing and continuous action.
[time=2810] It's just given and it's just given freely, it's not earned.
[time=2817] I could go a thousand directions right now, my mind is just spinning, but I'll land on you dads.
[time=2824] I'll just land on you dads.
[time=2827] I see this and I encounter it even in my own life
[time=2834] with young daughters, I wanna talk to your dads with daughters, I could talk to you moms with sons, again I could go a thousand different directions, dads with daughters.
[time=2843] Let me just say it to you clearly this morning, and I think I'm just saying it to you because I see so much of this in the day to day of my own life as I bump into those who have not gotten this.
[time=2855] Dad, our daughters, our daughters don't have to end up promiscuous, hanging all over and giving themselves to the first older guy that shows him attention.
[time=2866] It doesn't have to be that way.
[time=2871] And you know what dads, you may be proud of her or you may be disappointed in her.
[time=2876] And her, she may be five, she may be 10, she may be 15, she may be 25, she may be 30.
[time=2882] And you might be really proud of her or you might be a little disappointed in her.
[time=2887] She might make A's or she might make C's.
[time=2890] She might make really good choices, she could make really bad ones, but you know what, regardless of that, you can show her love, you can give her attention, you can give and show interest, you can hold her, you can cuddle her, you can listen to her and you can help her up when she falls and you can from day one.
[time=2910] And if you didn't do it from day one, you can do it at day 100.
[time=2914] You can do it, you can start it at any point along the line, communicating to her that there isn't anything she can do that could ever separate her from the love of her father.
[time=2927] Not one thing, you see dads and moms, I'll talk to you both here, there are two issues here.
[time=2934] You see, some children don't get any of the above.
[time=2938] You understand that, right?
[time=2942] You all understand that?
[time=2944] I'm not just talking, I'm not just blowing smoke here.
[time=2946] You all know, right?
[time=2947] That there are kids in this church.
[time=2951] You all know that there are kids in this community that don't get any of what I just said.
[time=2962] Leading their precious little hearts to one conclusion, that they haven't done enough to get it, so that means they must have to what?
[time=2971] Earn it.
[time=2972] Second issue, some get a little love,
[time=2979] it's the same thing, just different nuance.
[time=2982] Some get a little love here and there, but more than the little they might see, it's the overwhelming sense that they live with, that one wrong move and it's gone.
[time=2992] And they learn from day one that love is conditional and that mommy or daddy or grandma or grandpa or friends, you know, they give it to me when I do what's right and when I do what's wrong, it's gone.
[time=3006] Real love has no conditions.
[time=3007] Mom, stay has husbands, wives, friends.
[time=3010] Romans 3.24, real love, God's love.
[time=3012] Romans 3.24 says being justified as a gift.
[time=3015] Gift.
[time=3020] Revelation 22, 17 says, let the one who is thirsty come, let the one who wishes take the water of life without what?
[time=3027] Cost.
[time=3028] God's love, real love.
[time=3033] The real love that gave you life comes free and you're gonna charge.
[time=3038] You're gonna make him earn it.
[time=3042] You're gonna make her work for it.
[time=3045] It's not God's love.
[time=3048] It's not real love.
[time=3050] Number two, it's given freely and it's also given at a cost, not a profit.
[time=3058] It's given at a cost, not a profit.
[time=3060] What do I mean by that?
[time=3061] Mark 10.45, the son of man, Jesus Christ, came to serve not to be served, right?
[time=3068] Came to serve, Mark 10.45, write it down.
[time=3071] The son of man came to serve not to be served to give his life.
[time=3078] Real love isn't given.
[time=3081] I know this is basic, but it seems like we keep missing this people.
[time=3084] Real love isn't given to get.
[time=3087] Real love is given to give, period.
[time=3093] You say, but wait, I wanna put a comma there.
[time=3096] 'Cause what about me?
[time=3099] You know, what am I gonna get my?
[time=3100] You know what, that's called a relationship with the living God whose love for you is greater than you could ever imagine and as long as you walk with him, as long as you talk with him, as long as you live with him, as long as you stay surrendered to him, he will bring a presence and a force of love into your life you've never known.
[time=3120] And you will walk around in relationship with him with a tank full ready to give.
[time=3125] But no, see, we don't live like that with him.
[time=3128] So the tank gets empty and we end up looking at people who were never supposed to provide that for us in the first place, demanding love.
[time=3138] Wanting our tank filled up from people who were never supposed to fill up our tank.
[time=3142] Real love isn't given to get, it's given to give.
[time=3145] It's sacrifices, it's given at a cost.
[time=3148] What do I mean by that?
[time=3149] Listen, real love sacrifices time.
[time=3152] Real love sacrifices preference.
[time=3154] Real love sacrifices pleasure in an effort to give it.
[time=3159] Does that make it this really boring, drab, hard, painful, that no, it's a good thing.
[time=3166] And at times it comes with a cost.
[time=3169] But it's a good cost because when you pay it, you get to give it and when you give it, it makes a difference.
[time=3175] Guys, you don't do the dishes or vacuum the whole house or fold three baskets of laundry.
[time=3184] So that's seal, rub your back.
[time=3190] Is that safe?
[time=3191] (congregation laughing) You with me, you do all of that 'cause she needs the rest and you wanna love her.
[time=3202] And you wanna say here, I just wanna do this.
[time=3205] 'Cause you love her.
[time=3208] You wanna express love, real love.
[time=3212] No strings attached.
[time=3213] You don't invite all of his friends over, ladies.
[time=3218] You don't invite all of his friends over, bake cookies, buy pop, order in pizza and appetizers and have them watch football all day long.
[time=3224] Doesn't that sound good, guys?
[time=3226] (congregation laughing) Gals, you don't do all of that.
[time=3229] Then roll over the next morning and ask if you can have a basket party.
[time=3232] (congregation laughing) You just do the pizza and the appetizers and the football all day long just 'cause you love him.
[time=3243] And you want, come on, ladies, stay with me.
[time=3245] (congregation laughing) Man, no love in here right now.
[time=3249] (congregation laughing) No reciprocation needed.
[time=3259] You with me?
[time=3261] No reciprocation needed.
[time=3268] I give.
[time=3271] I give you love and I give it to you freely.
[time=3277] Sacrificially.
[time=3278] And then just write this down.
[time=3279] Real love is given frequently, frequently not sparingly.
[time=3283] Please don't miss this.
[time=3286] Real love is given frequently, not sparingly.
[time=3289] It says in Lamentations Three.
[time=3291] I don't think this'll be up there.
[time=3292] Just write it down.
[time=3293] Please, Lamentations Three, 21 to 23.
[time=3295] You know what it says in Lamentations Three?
[time=3297] Jeremiah just cries out talking about how the love of God, the mercies of God are new every three months.
[time=3306] Yeah?
[time=3307] No.
[time=3308] Every week?
[time=3309] No.
[time=3310] Every what?
[time=3311] Every single morning.
[time=3314] It's new.
[time=3315] And it goes on in that same passage.
[time=3318] Read it.
[time=3319] Read it tonight.
[time=3320] Lamentations Three, 21 to 23.
[time=3322] It goes on to say that the love of God never ceases.
[time=3325] It's just being given freely and sacrificially and frequently.
[time=3332] And it's always out there.
[time=3335] And you say, come on, Kelly.
[time=3336] That's okay, I get you, okay?
[time=3338] But that's God, not me.
[time=3339] That's the point.
[time=3341] It's not you.
[time=3342] And if you're over here without him, you're stuck with the inability to in any way it all come close to real love.
[time=3353] With him in relationship with him, received and embraced, then and only then do we have any opportunity not to muster it up ourselves but to in relationship with God, allow our lives and our words and our spirit to be a conduit through which he expresses and shows real love to little boys and girls and family members and wives and husbands and friends and co-workers, often.
[time=3378] Grown man, grown man.
[time=3382] I think he was probably 45, maybe even older.
[time=3387] Not long ago in my office, weeping because his dad died and never said I love you.
[time=3393] Dad's, I hope you're holding your children's faces
[time=3399] in your hands and I don't just mean little ones.
[time=3404] I hope every night or every morning or every opportunity that you have, you hold their faces in your hands and you look 'em right in the eyes and tell 'em I love you so much.
[time=3419] And I hope they know that there isn't anything they could ever do, there's nowhere they could ever go that would ever separate them from the love of God, Romans eight or the love of their dad.
[time=3428] Let me close with this.
[time=3433] It's free, it's not earned, sacrificial.
[time=3440] It costs you and I at times.
[time=3443] It's to be done and given frequently.
[time=3449] And let me just remind you of this.
[time=3450] Real love, God's love gave us a choice and don't forget that with choice comes sin.
[time=3456] Because he gave us a choice back there at the very beginning.
[time=3461] With choice comes sin and with sin comes real judgment.
[time=3464] He is a God of love and we have elevated that and we have taught on that and we have sung that this morning.
[time=3471] With his love comes choice people and with his choice comes judgment.
[time=3476] And he wants, as John 3 16 says, he wants that all would know him and experience real love without it.
[time=3485] It's not a good thing and we'd love to help you
[time=3491] if you need some help on that front.
[time=3493] We'd love to talk with you about it so let us talk to a good and trusted friend who you know here.
[time=3498] Come and talk to us, we'd love to point in the right direction.
[time=3501] Real love, real love is God and we'll continue on next week.
[time=3507] Why don't you stand, let's close in a word of prayer.
[time=3510] Father, as we stand this morning we just stand as a people grateful for the fact that we could spend this time this morning in the pages of scripture with this unfolding story, God of your great love, God that we would know it and experience it and not only know it and experience it but God that we would pass it on, that we would evidence it and express it and show it to others.
[time=3536] And so as we study those things in the weeks to come, God we pray you'd grow our hearts.
[time=3540] And we'll thank you for it in your son's name we pray.
[time=3544] [AMEN]
[time=3563] (gentle music)
