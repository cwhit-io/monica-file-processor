[time=30] [MUSIC - 120 seconds]
[time=178] Lord of Heaven and the Lord of Heaven and the Lord of Heaven and the Lord of Heaven and the Lord.
[time=189] [MUSIC]
[time=201] Holy, holy, holy, holy, all the saints adore thee, casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea.
[time=221] [MUSIC]
[time=252] Lord, we thank you this morning for singing, being able to sing that you are holy.
[time=257] And now as we hear these stories, I pray that we as a family would just rejoice and be excited as you are.
[time=264] In the name of Jesus, we pray. Amen.
[time=268] If you've been around Black Hawk for any length of time, you know that one of the things we most enjoy
[time=275] is being able to come together as a family, be it here or out of the lake and hear the stories of people
[time=281] who have come to faith in Jesus Christ, stories of full surrender.
[time=286] And when this happens, when this takes place, when God brings someone to himself,
[time=292] and he does it in all kinds of different ways and he uses all kinds of different people and circumstances.
[time=298] Either way, it is an absolute joy. And what you're about to witness, you know, the miracle has already taken place.
[time=308] I mean, the life has been renewed, salvation has come, the full surrender has happened,
[time=314] but this is an opportunity for these folks to share that with you, and that is exciting stuff.
[time=320] And so I hope that you will not only just internally rejoice as we hear and see these folks,
[time=326] but I hope you'll be able to just express to him your gratitude and your thanks for what he does in the lives of people.
[time=334] Carolyn, come on in. I want you to meet Carolyn Brody.
[time=337] And she is here as one who wants to be a part of this family, and she wants to share with you her story
[time=345] of how she came to faith in Christ. How are you doing?
[time=348] Good. Good to have you here.
[time=350] That's all right. Most do.
[time=352] Share with the people.
[time=354] Most do.
[time=355] You share with the folks how you came to know the Lord.
[time=358] A little bit of my walk with the Lord started in 1997, and I was on a retreat called a Walk to Emmaus,
[time=367] and if you know the story in the Gospel of Luke, it's about two men that walk along, and a third man joins them, and they suddenly realize that it's the Lord that's walking with them.
[time=378] And on this retreat, I had that same experience, and I was in a small group discussion with a bunch of women,
[time=385] and we were just talking, and I was really kind of down and out and feeling sorry for myself and saying,
[time=391] "You know, I'm just not a good mother. I'm divorced. I'm always tired. I don't have time to spend with my kids.
[time=398] I'm not doing what I should be doing." And really kind of in a pity party.
[time=402] And this one woman looked right at me, and she kind of had a little attitude going, and she said to me, "You know, who do you think you are?" I kind of went, "Excuse me?" And she said, "You know, who do you think you are?" She says, "The Lord forgave you. Why can't you forgive yourself?" And she said, "You know, you think you're that much better than he is?" I was sort of like, I don't know what to say.
[time=427] So, you know, that kind of sunk, and I thought she was kind of being rude.
[time=432] Little did I know the Lord was talking through her. And I went outside when we had a break, and I was walking outside, and I mean, it was just the sky, the grass, everything was just in color.
[time=447] And I remember shaking my fist at cod and saying, "You know what? 40 years I have struggled with guilt and shame and all these things,
[time=458] and how dare you let me go through 40 years of suffering?"
[time=464] And he stood right in front of me, and he said, "Carolyn, I've always been there with my arms, held out to hug you.
[time=471] You just never hugged back." And ever since then, I've been hugging the Lord.
[time=476] And thank you, Black Hawk, for letting me become part of your family.
[time=481] Good job.
[time=488] I will.
[time=490] "Carolyn, you know in your heart that your sin, a sin that comes with your humanness,
[time=496] you know in your heart that's been forgiven, and you know that Jesus Christ is the one who forgave you.
[time=502] And you fully surrendered. Not part, but all, of your heart and life to him. Amen. Let's pray.
[time=509] God, we are so thankful.
[time=512] For Carolyn, we're so thankful for this story, though it sounds familiar, God, we never ever tire of seeing you at work in the lives of people.
[time=523] And God, as you revealed yourself to her, and as she has recognized her need for your broken body and your spilled blood,
[time=533] God, we rejoice in the fact that she now is a new creation.
[time=538] And we are so grateful to have her as part of this family.
[time=541] And we pray, God, you'd continue to grow her and strengthen her and her walk with you.
[time=545] Your son's name, we pray. Amen.
[time=548] Let's do this way.
[time=550] Just hold on there.
[time=551] Carolyn, it's my privilege and a pleasure as your pastor and a friend to baptize you today in the name of the Father,
[time=558] and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[time=561] [APPLAUSE]
[time=573] [AMEN] Johnny, come on in. I want you to meet a guy who has come in a good friend.
[time=579] And we are so thankful that he's here. This is John Runquist. Everybody say, "Hi, John."
[time=586] They're out there.
[time=588] John, come on in Dale. This is John's friend, Dale Hanson, who God has used in a wonderful way to kind of point John in a good direction.
[time=599] John's just going to share with you his story of how all this came to be, and then we're going to pray for him and baptize him.
[time=606] Come over here a little bit in front of the mic.
[time=608] All right. Gotta bring my notes.
[time=611] Thanks very much. For those of you that know me, I'm a bit forgetful, including today.
[time=618] I left my notes at home, along with my swim trunks, but I made it on time anyway.
[time=623] I've been very fortunate, I think, in my 41 years on this planet to have a great family.
[time=630] I have two wonderful parents that taught me very early on the important of a good, strong work ethic.
[time=636] My father was a dentist for nearly 40 years. My mother taught third grade for nearly 35 years.
[time=641] I have one brother who has been an architect and home builder and has also instilled in me as an older brother, the importance of a hard-working life.
[time=652] I feel that I've known God all of my life from the time I even before I understood what the word God meant.
[time=659] When I was taken to church by my parents, who brought my brother and I up in a very strong Christian home,
[time=665] solid Christian beliefs, I was raised in an inter-denominational church and came to know Christ through the words that I studied and read and recited each and every Sunday.
[time=677] Totally oblivious to the storm that was brewing in my family home.
[time=681] As a pre-teen and teenager, I came even closer to Christ as I saw before my very own eyes the Lord lead my father back to sobriety.
[time=692] He's been sober 29 years and for that I am forever grateful.
[time=698] He also led my parents back together and they've been married some 47 years.
[time=704] So I'm eternally grateful for both of those examples of his power, strength and wisdom.
[time=710] As an adult, I was blessed with two beautiful children, or I should say I am blessed with two beautiful children.
[time=718] Gifts that I believe came from God, Matthew 11, Victoria 7, and they continue to show me the light and leave me down the parental path.
[time=726] And for that I'm grateful as well.
[time=728] He also led me through some very difficult times, divorced five years ago and two very serious automobile accidents,
[time=736] after which I had a very deep lull.
[time=739] I found myself in the garage of my home with the car running, the door down and me arguing with God.
[time=746] What had I done to deserve this?
[time=748] All I wanted out of this life was to be a husband and father.
[time=752] Well, I got the father part.
[time=754] I didn't, unfortunately, haven't gotten the husband part as long as I wished.
[time=758] But I'm here and I'm back and I'm stronger and greater and more blessed than ever.
[time=764] And for that I can only thank one person, one being in my life and that's God.
[time=769] I truly believe that he has shown me the way and led me to where I am today.
[time=773] It's people like Dale Hanson.
[time=775] Come on up here Dale.
[time=777] If it wasn't for this guy right here, I wouldn't be joining this great big happy family as I am,
[time=783] because I drove by Black Hawk Baptist for years and years and wanted where all the excitement was about why the parking lot was always packed as I went to another church at which time I was a member where the parking lot wasn't so packed.
[time=796] Dale and I went to school together, sat right next to each other and hit it off immediately and our friendship has grown from there.
[time=802] There's also someone very special out of the audience that I'm not going to identify.
[time=807] But if it wasn't for that person, I would have lost that argument with God in the garage that day.
[time=812] Their face and the faces of my two children kept flashing before me saying don't quit, don't quit, don't quit.
[time=820] And I didn't quit.
[time=822] That's my story and I'm sticking to it.
[time=824] And I believe very strongly in my faith and I believe one thing that God is amazing
[time=831] and our God is an awesome God. Thank you.
[time=834] Pray with us.
[time=844] Would you father, thank you so much for the faithfulness that you have shown John over the years.
[time=850] And so encouraging is he and I have talked father to know that even as he has gone through so much,
[time=856] there has come a time when he realized that full surrender, a personal relationship with you was what he needed.
[time=866] And we're so grateful to see that in him today and to see it growing.
[time=870] And we're grateful for people like Dale and others who continuously come alongside young Christ followers in our family.
[time=878] And we're so grateful for the opportunity to have John as part of your family and that we get to share life with him that we count on a blessing.
[time=887] We pray you would continue to strengthen him, that you would continue to grow him in your son's name we pray. Amen.
[time=894] All right, buddy.
[time=896] John is my privilege.
[time=899] As your friend and pastor to baptize you today, for the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[time=913] [APPLAUSE]
[time=922] All kinds of hugging going on up here. Good stuff. Wow.
[time=928] Let me introduce to you Dave. Dave Schock is going to come and he's going to share with you his story.
[time=933] And Dave is joined in here today by his son Kevin and his daughter-in-law Karen.
[time=942] And I think even Mitch is going to, Dave wanted Mitch in here as well.
[time=946] And hey brother. We're doing great man. Hi there. Good to see you guys.
[time=951] Just step up there buddy. Kevin and Karen stand with you.
[time=955] With him there and Dave share with the folks how you came to know Christ.
[time=959] Morning. I'd first like to tell you how honored and how blessed I am to stand here today.
[time=969] Fifty-two years of sin I could, four minutes isn't long enough.
[time=974] All I can tell you is a hundred and five days ago on June 8th.
[time=983] As I stood in the Vineyard Church in Columbus, Ohio,
[time=991] with my 13-year-old grandma holding my hand as I wept, listening to amazing Greeks.
[time=1000] She was holding my hand and said, "Are you ready grandpa?"
[time=1008] So aside from that, it's been a wonderful journey.
[time=1012] I can stand here today and tell you that I'm so much more on fire today than I was 105 days ago.
[time=1018] There's many, many people in my life that I have to thank for that.
[time=1023] I'd like to thank my wife for having the patience to wait for me.
[time=1029] And my son Joshua and his wife and family,
[time=1035] all the people that were in the Vineyard that day, friends and family.
[time=1041] And these two that are standing here with me today, I could not be where I am here.
[time=1048] I could not be here today if it wouldn't be for these two.
[time=1052] Kevin has waited very patiently.
[time=1057] Karen wasn't so patient.
[time=1062] For years Karen says, "Here Dave, read this book.
[time=1065] Here Dave, listen to this tape.
[time=1067] Here Dave, read this book.
[time=1070] And today when I have any problems that these two guys can't answer, I come to her." She's shooting about 60%.
[time=1083] But like I said, it's just an honor and I'm so blessed to be here.
[time=1087] And like my friend that came down here before me, I had everything memorized.
[time=1092] I've been thinking about it all week.
[time=1094] And yesterday morning and this morning I said, "Lord, I'll never remember all that." It's in your hands, just speak through me.
[time=1102] I love you all. Thank you.
[time=1104] [AMEN] Dave, I'm going to pray for you, buddy, all right?
[time=1118] Join us.
[time=1119] God, we just thank you that you saw fit to Design Day
[time=1126] and to never give up.
[time=1129] And just through your spirit to continue to draw, to shape, and to mold like a potter does the clay.
[time=1139] And finally, with a heart of clay, they said, "Yeah, go ahead and put your fingerprints on my heart."
[time=1146] And God only, you can do that.
[time=1149] And we love you for it.
[time=1151] Thank you for Kevin and Karen, how they continue to invest in Dave's life.
[time=1156] And just as we've got to see God today, the three stories of life,
[time=1162] all come together, my story, their story, and his story, Father, your story.
[time=1169] And how it's unbelievable when hearts fully surrender to you.
[time=1178] And they don't want to keep it a secret.
[time=1180] They want the whole world to know and to receive that grace which you give so freely.
[time=1188] Thank you for who you are, God.
[time=1190] In Jesus' mighty name we pray. Amen.
[time=1193] [AMEN] All right, partner, I want you to hang out here.
[time=1199] It's a privilege and a real honor to be able to baptize you today, Dave Schock.
[time=1206] The name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[time=1211] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1226] Well, hey, just before we go, a reminder, just a word of encouragement to every one of you.
[time=1233] For some reason, and we still don't get it, one day we'll get to ask him,
[time=1239] but for some reason he has left his kingdom and this message of hope and life,
[time=1248] the gospel, he has left that in your hands and in mine.
[time=1253] And he has asked us to be the conduit through which it gets shared and lived out.
[time=1260] So please, please keep sharing it.
[time=1264] Please keep living it out.
[time=1266] Please get up every day and beg God to bring just the right people at just the right time, you know,
[time=1273] into your life that you could befriend, love, and come alongside.
[time=1278] And we'll enjoy Lord willing more and more and more mornings like this.
[time=1283] Amen. Amen. Let's continue the worship.
[time=1287] [MUSIC - 216 seconds]
[time=1523] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1525] Would you pray with me for the message this morning?
[time=1528] Lord Jesus, thank you.
[time=1532] Thank you for teaching us, for giving us your word and setting the example for us.
[time=1536] And now today I pray that as we see in your life, real love, please open our hearts,
[time=1543] that we might take that and use it and live it in our lives every day.
[time=1549] Please bless Kelly and his words. In the name of Jesus, we pray. Amen.
[time=1555] [MUSIC]
[time=1561] Well, what an appropriate Sunday to deal with this second topic in our six-week series
[time=1569] that we've entitled Real Love. We come this morning to this idea of real love serving.
[time=1575] And there has been, as you will see in just a few minutes, note greater example of selfless service
[time=1582] than what we celebrated here just a few minutes ago.
[time=1586] And it is a joy. It really is to get to celebrate and remember that together like we just did.
[time=1595] We're so thankful if you're here for the first time today or maybe it's your second or third.
[time=1602] You may have come on your own. You may have come with a friend.
[time=1606] You may have watched the Bible hour. You may have heard about us in a number of different ways.
[time=1613] But we're so thankful that you're here. And we'd love to meet you afterwards.
[time=1617] God is doing amazing things here in this family.
[time=1622] And I'm one of the most fortunate people on the earth to get to spend my days in the midst of what he's doing here
[time=1631] with this church and we're so thankful that we get to have you with us and we're so thankful that we get to open up this book here this morning and learn more about real love.
[time=1643] Sometimes it mows a lawn without being asked.
[time=1650] Sometimes it delivers a meal to a new mother or herding friend.
[time=1656] Sometimes it cleans all the toilets inside and out throughout the entire house.
[time=1664] Even reaching back underneath and unscrewing those plastic screws
[time=1671] that hold you as you're tracking with me, aren't you?
[time=1674] Those plastic screws that hold the seat and lid in place and then cleaning where no human nose should go if you have boys.
[time=1684] Sometimes it just sits down and folds the laundry for an hour or two or three.
[time=1692] Sometimes it sits for hours or days or even months in a hospital waiting room while a good friend's spouse or child clings to life.
[time=1701] You see, sometimes it buys groceries for a family in need.
[time=1705] Sometimes it covers tuition for a student who wouldn't otherwise have an opportunity.
[time=1711] Sometimes it rubs feet or shoulders in an effort to say thanks for a long day's work.
[time=1716] Sometimes it befriends somebody who has none.
[time=1724] Sometimes it cleans house. Sometimes it runs errands for a mom or dad overwhelmed by a season of trial. Sometimes it cooks. Sometimes it paints.
[time=1733] Sometimes it sows. Sometimes it changes a diaper. Sometimes it fixes things around the house of a guy who doesn't know how to fix anything.
[time=1743] Sometimes it goes to the store at 10.30 at night when there's no milk for the lucky charms in the morning. Sometimes it weeds. Sometimes it washes.
[time=1755] Sometimes it listens. Sometimes it writes. Sometimes it carries the groceries in from the car
[time=1763] or carries an unbearable burden of another in need.
[time=1768] And sometimes once it allows a body to be broken completely and its own blood to be spilled.
[time=1782] It does these things people because real love serves.
[time=1792] Real love. It just goes those places and it does those things because that's real love.
[time=1802] It serves. Serving defined for you this morning.
[time=1808] What does it mean to serve if you're taking some notes down?
[time=1811] Boy, just get your pen or your pencil out and write this down.
[time=1815] Real love serves. What does it mean to serve? Serving defined is this basically it helps people.
[time=1821] It willingly helps people. It sacrificially gives away time, title and effort.
[time=1829] It comes alongside in humility in order to shoulder burdens and renew hope.
[time=1847] You who are here this morning, anybody here who's had their lawn mowed, anybody here who's had groceries delivered.
[time=1855] Anybody here who's had a house cleaned by a friend in a time of need.
[time=1861] Anybody in this room who's ever had anyone sit next to you in a hospital waiting room, you know what that means.
[time=1867] You have lived and experienced the effect of service.
[time=1873] You know exactly what I mean.
[time=1876] When I say these words, it shoulders burdens and renews hope.
[time=1883] See, that's what service does.
[time=1886] And guess who did it? Guess who did it better than anyone ever?
[time=1891] Who is the truest, purest, greatest servant of all?
[time=1897] Who is it? Jesus Christ. Absolutely.
[time=1902] The one who willingly died to save your life.
[time=1907] A lot of you in here this morning, you know that.
[time=1910] A lot of you in here this morning have realized, and not only realized it, but you've accepted it, that gift of life.
[time=1917] Many of you here this morning know that a good man died to save your life and to give you hope.
[time=1924] Others of you here this morning may be hearing this for the first or second or third time.
[time=1929] For some in the room this morning, it may be starting to sink in.
[time=1934] That Jesus Christ came and gave Himself.
[time=1939] He came and served.
[time=1940] He came and offered His life so you could have forgiveness of sin, so you could have hope for eternity.
[time=1947] So your burdens could be shouldered, so your hope could be renewed.
[time=1952] Look with me at Philippians, would you?
[time=1955] Back there in your New Testament Philippians chapter 2.
[time=1959] Open up to Philippians chapter 2, and we're going to just kick in here this morning, I think at verse 3.
[time=1965] Then we're going to make our way through verse 7.
[time=1968] Can we just read that, let me just read that to you first, and we're going to come back and look at a few things.
[time=1973] Philippians 2, verses 3 to 7.
[time=1977] Powerful passage here people, worth taking note of, worth just right now there in the quietness of your own heart.
[time=1985] Just maybe saying again to Him, just real quick before we read through it, maybe just saying again to Him, oh God please.
[time=1993] Show me something today.
[time=1995] God, have your word speak to me in a powerful way.
[time=1998] God, please.
[time=1999] My heart and my mind are open to what you would have for me today through the power.
[time=2005] The penetrating power of the Scriptures.
[time=2009] Listen, Philippians 2, picking it up in verse 3, it says do nothing.
[time=2016] There's only too many options there, does it?
[time=2020] It says do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind.
[time=2028] Regard one another as more important than yourself.
[time=2037] Do not merely look out for your own personal interests in a culture that is absolutely obsessed and given to that very endeavor,
[time=2048] but also look out for the interests of others.
[time=2053] Have this attitude in yourselves, which was also in Christ Jesus, who although he existed in the form of God,
[time=2060] did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, taking the form of a bondservant
[time=2068] and being made in the likeness of men.
[time=2073] We'll stop right there. Paul describes here in this amazing passage Jesus' flawless example of humility,
[time=2082] and theologically what he does here is he chronicles for us as well the descent of the Son of God from Heaven's glory to Earth's shame.
[time=2093] He describes the exalted position which was left behind and then presents a series of downward steps from that glory and honor to ever increasing in dignity and pain.
[time=2106] And I want you to look with me. We're going to come back and look at some things here in this passage this morning.
[time=2111] Look with me at this. What is a progression really of humility, a progression, if you will, of service?
[time=2119] And I bet as you look at this and as you think about this and as you open your mind and your heart to this, you like me will see again in a fresh way as I did this week some things that perhaps we need to consider again
[time=2133] in the way we think and in the way we live.
[time=2136] Number one, write this down. This progression of service, it begins with the relinquishing of all rights.
[time=2143] He relinquishes all rights. Real love relinquishes all rights. Write that down.
[time=2155] Do nothing from selfishness. Verse three or empty conceit, but with humility of mind, regard one another as more important than yourself.
[time=2162] Do not merely look out for your own personal interest, but also for the interest of others.
[time=2167] Have this attitude. Verse five kind of now begins this process of giving us an example of this kind of relinquishing.
[time=2174] Have this attitude in yourselves, which was also in Christ Jesus, who although he grasped this, who although he existed in the form of God,
[time=2186] did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped.
[time=2194] Think about it this way. I mean, just for a moment. And be honest, all right? You've got some rights, don't you?
[time=2203] I mean, whoever you are, I mean, even just the most common every day in one of us. I mean, we've got some rights, right?
[time=2212] I mean, we've got rights as human beings, we've got rights as citizens, and oftentimes we like to exert those rights.
[time=2219] Claim those rights. You've got rights. You've got even some that are beyond that. Some of you in this room are dads.
[time=2225] You're fathers. I mean, you've got some rights. You've got some things coming to you as a dad or a father.
[time=2231] Others of you are mothers, you know, wives. I mean, there are some things that you deserve.
[time=2238] Some of you have the most seniority in your place of employment.
[time=2247] Some of you are in senior management positions. Some of you are spiritual leaders.
[time=2255] There's a lot of people in this room who have been given titles.
[time=2259] You're a little placard on your desk says something. The thing outside your office says something.
[time=2264] And see what happens is that sometimes those titles, sometimes those positions, sometimes those rights that we have.
[time=2271] We like to sometimes kind of fall into this pattern of flaunting those or removing ourselves from certain activities,
[time=2279] certain opportunities to roll up our sleeves and get a little dirty because you know what? I do this.
[time=2288] And when you just stop for a moment and think about it, he was God.
[time=2296] I'll say it again. He was God.
[time=2305] He was the God of the universe. He was the sustainer and creator of all things.
[time=2310] He was the powerful one. He was the mighty one. He was the one who put it all together and held it together.
[time=2317] He was the one who was the ruler and the authority over all.
[time=2321] He was the one that made the universe. He was the one that set the stars in place. He was the one who gave life.
[time=2327] He was that one we read about last week. He was God.
[time=2333] But in order to serve you, in order to serve me, in order to come alongside with humility and shoulder a burden and renew hope,
[time=2344] he rolls up serving sleeves, refuses to hold on to his divine rights. He relinquishes status in order to serve.
[time=2355] He relinquished all rights. Secondly, and very similar, I realized, but just listen to the truth of it as it unfolds.
[time=2367] Look at the first part of verse 7. Not only see that he relinquish all rights, he lets go. Secondly, he lets go of position.
[time=2377] The first part of 7 there. You see that? He didn't regard equality with God a thing to be grasped in 6, then first part of 7, but emptied himself.
[time=2388] Stop right there. Look at that again. But emptied himself.
[time=2395] The Greek word there is empty. It means this. It means to empty completely, to nullify, to make void.
[time=2410] To empty completely, to nullify, to make void. Now, please hear this. And try your best. This is a challenging thought, okay?
[time=2418] There are library, in theological libraries, there are stacks and stacks of periodicals and journals and books written about this one phrase.
[time=2428] We're not going to get this all figured out this morning. But just try for a moment to begin to put your arms around what this is saying.
[time=2436] He emptied himself. He completely emptied himself of divine rights. He empties himself so he could come alongside and serve you, shoulder your burden,
[time=2447] renew your hope. He completely empties himself of divine rights and position, certain prerogatives that came with his deity.
[time=2455] Now, he didn't lose or relinquish his deity. He stayed divine, right? Because had he stopped being God, had he lost his divinity, he could have died and defeated death and paid for the sins of the entire world, could he?
[time=2475] Had he stopped being God, he'd be decomposed in some garden tomb today outside the city limits of Jerusalem.
[time=2484] But he's not, is he? He's alive. See, rights and rights and position, rights and position were forfeited for a time made void, emptied.
[time=2501] You've got some rights. You've got some position. You've got a level of status in your life, whatever it might be.
[time=2511] Man, it's just good for you and I to realize something that's very hard to grasp, that he let go of what he let go of, that he left, what he left.
[time=2522] That he laid prerogatives and rights and position aside and you and I have the very same opportunity and principle. Does it match up? No, but you have the opportunity every single day of your life to say, you know what I'm not above that.
[time=2540] I could do that. I could offer this. I could come alongside there and where I work or what I make or what I drive or where I live or what I have, it makes no difference. See?
[time=2554] Because he left an example for me to follow and you know what, he did all this so he could, he did all of this so he could selflessly serve.
[time=2565] Number three, write that down. He did all of this so he could selflessly serve. You see real love that serves, it relinquishes all rights, it lets go of position and it selflessly serves.
[time=2581] Look at the last part there, verse seven. He emptied himself, taking the form of a bond servant and being made in the likeness of men, a bond servant.
[time=2596] Another word there that I want you to write down, a bond servant. It's the key word there in the last part of that verse, bond servant.
[time=2603] The Greek word there is doulos, D-O-U-L-O-S. Write that down, doulos, doulos, bond servant. One commentator, listen, described it this way, a doulos in this day and time owned absolutely nothing.
[time=2619] Not even the clothes on his back, everything a doulos had, including his life, belonged to his master, the one who had purchased him or her.
[time=2630] Jesus did own his own clothes, but he owned no land or house, no gold or jewels, he owned no business, no boat, no horse.
[time=2637] He had to borrow a donkey to ride into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, borrow a room for the last supper and even was buried in a borrowed tomb.
[time=2646] He refused any property, any advantages, any special service to himself relative to his glory, the king of kings and Lord of lords willingly became the doulos.
[time=2659] The doulos of all bond servants. The one who was in the beginning with God and through whom all things came into being claimed as his own, nothing that he had created.
[time=2673] Among other things in this time and in this culture, a bond servant was required to carry other people's belongings.
[time=2681] The bond servant was required to carry other people's stuff, whether it was to the market, whether it was to the next city, whether it was across the country, the doulos, the bond servant would follow behind carrying his master's burdens.
[time=2698] It's what they did. It's what they lived for.
[time=2703] As the supreme bond servant, Jesus carried the burden that no other man could carry, the sin burden, for all who would believe.
[time=2713] As Isaiah revealed, you can write this down, Isaiah 53 6, Isaiah 53 6, it says there, "The Lord has caused the iniquity of us all to fall on him."
[time=2728] And there he is, the doulos, the bond servant carrying, holding and sustaining your burden and mine.
[time=2735] As he himself, the Lord Jesus Christ testified while heading toward Jerusalem for the last time, you find this in Matthew 20.
[time=2743] He said, "The son of man did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life a ransom for many."
[time=2750] A few days later, during the last supper, he asks the disciples rhetorically, "Who is greater?"
[time=2756] Remember this, Luke 22, he says, "Who is greater?" Hey, guys, let me just ask you a question here.
[time=2761] Who is greater, the one who reclines at the table or the one who comes alongside and serves?
[time=2769] Is it not the one who reclines at the table when he says that?
[time=2772] These in essence kind of getting inside their minds kind of already just saying out loud what most of them were thinking and most of them, like you and I, most of the time think that the one who is greater is the one who has the most toys.
[time=2785] The one who has the bigger house, the one who takes the better vacations, I mean the one who has more stuff, the one who has more square footage.
[time=2796] They're the ones that are great, right? He says?
[time=2803] No, Luke 22, 27, "But I am among you as the one who serves."
[time=2814] You see, through his provision of salvation, Jesus served others more completely than any other servant or slave who has ever lived.
[time=2825] But he was also an example of servanthood for his disciples to follow.
[time=2830] He reminded them that a disciple, Matthew 10, you can write this down, Matthew 10, 24.
[time=2835] He reminds them that a disciple is not above his teacher nor a slave above his master and that if then the Lord and the teacher washed your feet, and this comes from John 13.
[time=2850] If then he said, "The Lord and the teacher washed your feet." You also ought to wash one another's feet, for I gave you an example that you also should do as I did to you.
[time=2862] Truly, truly I say to you, a slave is not greater than his master nor is the one who is greater than the one who sent him.
[time=2870] If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them.
[time=2875] In Matthew 23, 11, he declared that the greatest among you, this is really simple but really profound, don't miss this.
[time=2883] He says in Matthew 23, "The greatest among you will be your servant."
[time=2891] Boy, we've twisted that.
[time=2895] The greatest among you shall be your servant, yet after they have faithfully done, he says this in Luke 17, 10.
[time=2904] Yet after they have faithfully done all the things which are commanded, Christians have to take no credit for themselves but rather confess with genuine humility.
[time=2916] We are unworthy slaves.
[time=2920] We have done only that which we ought to have done.
[time=2926] That's to be your mindset and mine.
[time=2930] In the end, we are unworthy slaves. We have done only that which we ought to have done.
[time=2940] So look around you this morning.
[time=2944] I mean, not here necessarily.
[time=2949] I mean, maybe here, but maybe just look around you.
[time=2956] I mean, in your mind's eye.
[time=2960] Why don't you just take a minute and scroll through your day.
[time=2966] Scroll through your week, go ahead.
[time=2968] I mean, just take a minute and look around you.
[time=2971] Look around that office.
[time=2973] Look around your neighborhood.
[time=2976] Look around your family, immediate and extended.
[time=2979] Go ahead, look around that specific and unique place that God has put you.
[time=2988] See, and he's put you in a place. He hasn't put me.
[time=2991] And there are opportunities screaming for service.
[time=2996] There are people and there are individuals who need burdens shared, who need to have hope renewed.
[time=3003] Go ahead, look around.
[time=3006] Who do you see?
[time=3009] Whose burden could you carry?
[time=3012] Whose pain could you shoulder?
[time=3017] Whose need could you help meet?
[time=3023] Whose trial could you share in?
[time=3031] No matter what rights you think you have, what position you may claim to possess or how busy you may be.
[time=3042] You see, real love serves.
[time=3049] And let me just tell you this from experience.
[time=3055] Observation first, and then let me just tell you one thing, from experience.
[time=3061] Mine and the experience of so many others.
[time=3067] People, we are so...
[time=3071] You know this and I know this, and I hear it so often.
[time=3074] You know what, I hear it out of my own lips and I hear it out of yours.
[time=3079] And at some point, I feel like down deep in my heart, we've got to, on issues like this, somebody's got to draw a line in the sand.
[time=3087] I feel like at some point, somebody, some group of people have got to just say, "You know what, we're going to put a stake in the crown right here." And we as a family, we as a group of individuals, maybe we here as a band of Christ followers would just kind of go to war on this phrase that I hear again and again and again from me.
[time=3108] And you, I'm so busy.
[time=3115] You say, and I say.
[time=3120] I hear it all the time.
[time=3124] I'm so busy, I've got so much going on.
[time=3127] I mean, there's just things happening here and there, and then I understand that.
[time=3134] I'm busy.
[time=3137] But you see, never ever in the pages of this book, I mean, never, ever would he call you and I to something?
[time=3143] And he has, he has literally, and he has clearly, he has plainly called you and I to lives of service.
[time=3149] He has called you and I to be a people, young and old, married, not married.
[time=3154] Walking with the Lord for a couple weeks, knowing him for 30 years.
[time=3159] Grandkids, no grandkids, aunts, uncles, I mean, he has called every one of us to be a people who would aggressively and willingly look forward to opportunities to do any one of those 27 things I mentioned at the beginning of this.
[time=3176] And as you looked around in your mind, just a few minutes ago, I know you saw people, I know you realize that right there on your block, right there in your family, right there in your place of work, there are opportunities for you and I to roll up serving sleeves and come alongside in what may seem like
[time=3196] small ways, but you and I know they would have huge implications, but you see, you're too busy and I'm too busy sometimes to extend ourselves in that fashion.
[time=3210] And so I just, I want to encourage it, it's not a problem we're going to fix right here in five minutes, but I want to encourage you this morning.
[time=3217] What you, and I'm going to try the same thing in the way that we schedule our days and the way that we make commitments and the way that we spread ourselves, maybe sometimes too thin.
[time=3230] And the pace that you and I choose to go at life, would you be willing this morning to recognize this truth and do your very best tomorrow morning, to do your very best tonight, to along with me, just get on our knees and say, "God please, your love for me served, and I want to be one who serves in return, and God I need your help."
[time=3259] To orchestrate as best I can, my life and our family and our activities in a way that leave us some space, white space.
[time=3274] We need a little bit more white space in the old schedules.
[time=3280] We need a little bit more freedom to be a people who would at work and home and in our families be able to have our heads kind of on serving swivels, just looking for what he might have for you.
[time=3294] You a student here this morning?
[time=3297] Doesn't matter, student, mom, dad, older adult.
[time=3304] And you know what? That's the observation. Here's the thing I've seen.
[time=3310] He redeems the time.
[time=3314] He is a God who redeems the time.
[time=3316] Oftentimes you and I don't think we have time to serve.
[time=3319] Oftentimes we don't think we have enough space to really give ourselves to him or her or them.
[time=3325] I'll tell you what, why don't you trust him this week to go ahead and make an effort, to go ahead and just take a stab at this thing.
[time=3333] And you watch how he redeems that time.
[time=3339] It might be ten minutes, it could be an hour.
[time=3341] And what you think might be twenty might end up being three hours.
[time=3344] I mean, you know what?
[time=3346] Trust him.
[time=3348] And I would just encourage you right now before we leave this room.
[time=3352] I would encourage you to just write down if you're writing, it's okay.
[time=3355] No one will really know what it means.
[time=3356] Just I would encourage you to write down a name.
[time=3358] I would encourage you to take just a minute and write down a name, write down a situation.
[time=3364] If you're not going to write it down just, you know, write it down on the front of your mind this morning and ask God to give you the courage and wisdom and strength to, you know, before the sun goes down tonight.
[time=3377] To go before him and say, "God, help me serve.
[time=3381] Help me be one who, would you go back if we could on the slide, could you just go back to that definition back at the beginning?"
[time=3389] And let me just close this morning by just reading this through with you one more time.
[time=3393] Would you get on your knees tonight or in the morning with God?
[time=3397] And would you say, "God, please give me the strength and courage to help people."
[time=3403] To sacrificially, when it's right and of you, God, give away my time and my title and effort to come alongside in humility so that I could with your help shoulder a burden, maybe even renew hope.
[time=3423] Think about that. Make that your prayer. Trust him with the time. He'll redeem it.
[time=3430] And thank him today for relinquishing all that he gave up, for letting go of the position and the prerogatives and all the rights so he could selflessly be a doulas, a burden bearer.
[time=3446] Let's stand and we'll close. Again, if you're here for the first time this morning, we'd love to say hello to you. Come on down and let us put a name and a face together.
[time=3455] We want to invite you to visit our guest center. If you're here for the first time or second or third, please go visit the folks at the guest center.
[time=3462] We've got some things we'd love to give you and come back again next week as we continue this look at real love.
[time=3468] Father, we stand before you this morning of people who have been reminded in a powerful way this morning as we came to these tables and as we took part in remembering your broken body and spilled blood.
[time=3483] God, what an amazing act of love. Amazing grace. We just are amazed again and again at the kind of love that you evidenced for each of us.
[time=3496] And God, as we see clearly today from this passage here in Philippians, how your love serves, how your love comes alongside, how your love is willing to leave this in order to offer that.
[time=3509] We need more of that in our lives. I know I do in mine. And so God, please empower us to look around today, to look around tomorrow, to look around this next week.
[time=3521] And God, show us who it is, where it is we might need to travel in order to be you, in order to really love by serving.
[time=3533] And God, give us the strength to do it well. In your son's name and all the people agreed and said, Amen.
