[time=181] [MUSIC - 62 seconds]
[time=259] - You are my King.
[time=260] [MUSIC - 132 seconds]
[time=406] - Let's sing one more song before we sit.
[time=408] Beautiful song, a hymn that was written a long time ago, but means a lot.
[time=414] I hope that you are able to digest the words as we move through them quickly.
[time=420] [MUSIC - 63 seconds]
[time=488] Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.
[time=515] God, I say, Yours, you team, I'll end, come, bless me.
[time=528] Spamless land, the God was here, full of doneness.
[time=539] Can indeed, hallelujah, what a Savior with heaven
[time=554] Was He to die, it is finished, was His cry, now in heaven,
[time=571] Salted high, hallelujah, what a Savior.
[time=585] Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, what a Savior.
[time=620] When He comes to our glorious King, all His rents are come to free.
[time=635] Then I knew this, strong will sing, hallelujah, what a Savior.
[time=650] Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, what a Savior, hallelujah, hallelujah.
[time=679] Father, we come this morning to praise Your name, to say, "Hallelujah."
[time=691] What a Savior, a Savior that forgaves so much, a Savior that became sin in our place.
[time=700] We're grateful, Lord, we love You.
[time=706] Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, what a Savior.
[time=729] [AMEN] Hi, I'm Mitch, teaching pastor at Blackhawk Ministries, and we want to thank you for joining us again during our series entitled, "Real Love." You know, we'd like you to come experience "Real Love" with us on Sunday mornings at 9 a.m. and 1045.
[time=744] Or we also have a church service called Common Ground on Wednesday nights, 645-8 p.m.
[time=749] It includes acoustic worship, storytelling, prayer, and a message.
[time=754] And right now, we're walking through the gospel of John, and it is changing lives, including mine.
[time=760] We invite you to come to Common Ground Wednesday nights, 645-8 p.m.
[time=766] The message that you're going to hear is Kelly and I talking about sin and forgiveness.
[time=773] And "Real Love" forgives, but the requirement for forgiveness comes because of sin.
[time=779] And in our life, in your home, at work, wherever, we fall short.
[time=786] And at sin, we fall short of God's holiness, of God's utter perfection, of God's standards.
[time=795] Larry Krab says that sin is an attempt at any life apart from God, and we all find ourselves
[time=801] doing that.
[time=802] And so sin is very present in this world, all around us, wherever we go.
[time=808] And that sin has power, and we can succumb to that power, and that power and that presence
[time=815] of sin comes with a penalty, and that penalty is eternal separation from God.
[time=822] But it doesn't stop there.
[time=825] Real love forgives because God in his heart is forgiving, and we have freedom in Christ.
[time=830] In a relationship with Jesus Christ, where we fully surrender to Him, we have freedom from the presence of sin and eternity, we have freedom from the power of sin today, and we
[time=842] have freedom from the penalty of sin.
[time=845] And if we've been forgiven, then we need to forgive.
[time=849] And you're going to hear me talk about four things that we need to let go of to forgive.
[time=855] And I'll just let you experience that, but I challenge you to think about, do I really
[time=861] let go of all four of these things?
[time=865] Because as I'll say in the message, if one of them is still gripped tightly, then you're
[time=872] not really forgiving, and you won't experience freedom in Christ.
[time=877] Thank you, and come see us on Sunday mornings and Wednesday nights.
[time=880] Let me ask you a question.
[time=882] Well, before I ask the question, let me just paint the scene for you.
[time=888] It was a few months ago, I think, and my wife was driving around going somewhere.
[time=894] She goes a lot of places.
[time=895] And I had most of the kids, I think, actually in the van with her on this day.
[time=901] And as she's making her way through the city streets with most of our kids in the back,
[time=907] she's kind of making her way toward an intersection when all of a sudden, alongside, comes I think maybe two possibly three car loads of kids, younger kids, I don't know, high school, early
[time=919] college, completely out of control.
[time=923] Really reckless, having fun, but going way, way over the line.
[time=931] And the closer they get to this intersection, all of a sudden, in one fell swoop, this lead car without any realization of what was going on here, just makes this sharp turn, pulls
[time=940] over into Kevin's lane, completely cuts her off, the brakes get slammed, all the car
[time=946] seats, you know, hold, but like that, that thing could have got real, real messy.
[time=954] What would you do if somebody in their carelessness, in their recklessness, in their sin took
[time=965] one of yours?
[time=968] What would you do?
[time=970] How would you respond?
[time=971] What would you say?
[time=974] You know, there's some forgiveness scenarios that I can run and you can run, and at the end of those scenarios, I can say, you know what, that's doable, I could offer, I could extend that.
[time=983] There are a few, and I don't know that I could, I know I should, but there are some scenarios,
[time=991] I don't know if I, if I could.
[time=994] Listen, this morning, listen real close and watch as we begin to dialogue again this morning
[time=1003] about real love and how it forgives.
[time=1008] Is anybody home?
[time=1011] Hey, Elise, come on in, okay.
[time=1019] Andy just called, he said he'd be just a few minutes late.
[time=1021] Figures.
[time=1022] His replacement at work showed up late.
[time=1025] Are you guys going to the library again tonight?
[time=1027] Yep, her papers do Friday, I can't wait to get it finished.
[time=1032] Can I get you something to drink?
[time=1033] Oh, no thanks, I'm fine.
[time=1034] You sure?
[time=1035] Yeah.
[time=1036] So, how do you like it at IPFW?
[time=1040] It's okay.
[time=1041] I really like the junior college I went to in Florida, but my parents won't let me stay there.
[time=1046] Oh, why not?
[time=1047] Well, we just moved here in May and, well, they want me at home with them.
[time=1052] I guess to help them adjust.
[time=1054] It's not fair, I mean, they gotta let go sometime.
[time=1057] Well, it's a hard thing to do.
[time=1059] Yeah, I know, but I mean, I've been with them almost 19 years.
[time=1063] Most marriages don't even last that long.
[time=1065] So you want a divorce?
[time=1066] A separation would be fine.
[time=1069] Have a seat.
[time=1070] Thanks.
[time=1071] So, were you born in Florida?
[time=1075] Lived there my whole life.
[time=1076] Oh, well, being here, you're in for a real treat.
[time=1079] There is nothing like a white Christmas.
[time=1081] Yeah, I guess that'll be kind of neat.
[time=1083] In Florida, Santa delivers presents by speedboat.
[time=1087] This was at the front door.
[time=1088] Well, thanks.
[time=1089] I wasn't expecting it.
[time=1091] Well, what's wrong?
[time=1095] Who's Jason?
[time=1097] My son.
[time=1099] I thought Andy was an only child.
[time=1104] Jason died six years ago.
[time=1105] Oh, Mrs. Hollander, I'm really sorry.
[time=1109] How old was he?
[time=1110] Fifteen.
[time=1113] He was hit by a car on his bike.
[time=1116] He died two days later.
[time=1117] How awful.
[time=1121] Was it a drunk driver?
[time=1123] How did you know?
[time=1124] So that's why Andy wanted to do our paper on that.
[time=1129] What do you think it is?
[time=1131] It's from our insurance company.
[time=1141] Dear Jason, happy birthday in advance.
[time=1146] Since you're turning 21, you will no longer be covered under your parent's insurance policy.
[time=1153] I'll be calling you soon to discuss the possibility of you purchasing your insurance from us.
[time=1158] In the meantime, it closes our gift.
[time=1164] It's a highway safety kit.
[time=1166] I am so sorry.
[time=1170] I'm home.
[time=1171] Hey, Elise, sorry I'm late.
[time=1176] What's going on?
[time=1178] Mom?
[time=1180] Elise?
[time=1182] A package came for Jason.
[time=1189] Why didn't you tell me about your brother?
[time=1194] I don't know.
[time=1196] Well, what happened to the person who hit him?
[time=1198] Did he or she walk away from it?
[time=1201] Yes.
[time=1203] He did.
[time=1204] Figures.
[time=1205] Killing a 15-year-old kid and walking away from it.
[time=1209] That is so unfair.
[time=1211] Would it have been better if he would have been killed too?
[time=1213] Yeah.
[time=1214] I think it would.
[time=1216] Somehow I think it would.
[time=1219] Your brother got killed because some low-life idiot got drunk.
[time=1224] What happened to the guy?
[time=1226] I'm hoping out life.
[time=1229] He didn't go to prison.
[time=1230] What?
[time=1231] Why?
[time=1232] They didn't press charges.
[time=1234] Why not?
[time=1236] Your parents just let him walk away?
[time=1239] Not exactly.
[time=1242] Look, he was just a messed up kid with lots of problems, okay?
[time=1247] So what happened to him?
[time=1259] They were going to press charges until they saw this kid in court.
[time=1264] Until they got to know him.
[time=1267] He didn't know what he was doing.
[time=1269] He didn't mean to kill anyone.
[time=1271] He was just a stupid, lonely kid.
[time=1277] They saw that and they forgave him.
[time=1281] Wow.
[time=1284] And there's more.
[time=1286] But when they got to know him, really know him.
[time=1293] Eventually, they fell in love with this kid and they adopted him.
[time=1301] Wait.
[time=1304] Your parents?
[time=1305] Jason is not my brother.
[time=1307] What?
[time=1308] I never knew him.
[time=1310] I'm the drunk driver, the low-life idiot.
[time=1314] Wait.
[time=1316] I don't get it.
[time=1317] They adopted you?
[time=1319] Yeah.
[time=1320] Me.
[time=1325] Question for you this morning.
[time=1328] As we journey on into this discussion of real love and what it offers, what it requires,
[time=1335] what it gives you and I the opportunity to extend.
[time=1339] And as we talk about forgiveness this morning as we look to God's Word, let me just start by asking you this.
[time=1345] What is it that makes forgiveness necessary?
[time=1350] What is it that happens?
[time=1351] What is it that's said?
[time=1353] What is it that's chosen?
[time=1355] What is it that's thought?
[time=1357] What is it that goes on in the life and mind and soul of a human being that makes forgiveness
[time=1364] necessary?
[time=1366] What is it that we do?
[time=1369] It's with an S, ends with an N, three letters, it's called what?
[time=1375] Say again?
[time=1376] Sin.
[time=1380] Sin is what makes forgiveness necessary.
[time=1383] And sin is something that you and I have wrestled with.
[time=1390] Sin is something you and I are wrestling with.
[time=1393] Sin is something that we will wrestle with until the day we leave this place.
[time=1398] Sin is an amazing thing.
[time=1402] Just real quick, a brief definition just so as we further our conversation here.
[time=1408] We'll try to stay on the same page.
[time=1410] The word for sin in the Greek is the word hamartia, H-A-M-A-R-T-I-A, hamartia.
[time=1420] Don't miss this now.
[time=1421] It's pretty basic but pretty profound.
[time=1423] Hamartia means to miss the mark, hamartia means to fall short.
[time=1433] Something has been established as right.
[time=1437] God has spoken.
[time=1439] The bar has been set and it's a good bar because it's his bar but you see sin misses
[time=1447] the mark.
[time=1449] Just illustrate it like this, Marty, do me a favor.
[time=1454] Marty, catch this ball, stand up there brother.
[time=1457] There you go.
[time=1458] There's the ball.
[time=1459] Duck, Ola, thanks.
[time=1460] Go ahead.
[time=1461] Stand up, Marty.
[time=1462] Stand up.
[time=1463] Here's the mark.
[time=1464] Marty is a good man.
[time=1465] Marty is a pretty decent athlete.
[time=1466] Marty is going to try his best here to hit my hand.
[time=1469] But now listen, just take it out of the realm of Marty and just again think about it in terms of what you and I live with every day.
[time=1474] See God's word has said, let's pick one.
[time=1478] We'll talk about people behind their backs.
[time=1484] Go ahead, Marty, hit the hand.
[time=1491] Marty's a good man.
[time=1492] He doesn't talk about anybody.
[time=1495] Thanks, Marty.
[time=1496] He missed the mark.
[time=1499] He was close to hitting it.
[time=1501] But he misses the mark.
[time=1502] Let me see this for a sec here.
[time=1504] There you go.
[time=1505] Hey, Jim.
[time=1506] Go at it too far.
[time=1508] Nice grab.
[time=1509] Stand up here, Jim.
[time=1510] God's word also says, pick your principal.
[time=1515] God's word says husbands love your wives.
[time=1518] Jim loves his wife well, not perfectly.
[time=1521] But you see us as husbands, we make that effort.
[time=1526] Sometimes we work at that really hard.
[time=1527] Sometimes we fail miserably.
[time=1529] Go ahead, Jim.
[time=1530] Throw the ball and hit the mark.
[time=1533] Sometimes we fall short, right?
[time=1535] Thanks, mention.
[time=1537] Hamartia.
[time=1538] You can take it with you.
[time=1539] Or you can put it there.
[time=1540] Hamartia.
[time=1541] God has spoken.
[time=1542] God has called you and I to live lives and make choices, be it with what we say, how we love, where we go, what we do.
[time=1549] He's established the mark.
[time=1551] The target is very clear and yet in our fallenness.
[time=1555] We miss the mark again and again and again.
[time=1560] Where did it all start?
[time=1562] Where did it all come from, this missing of the mark?
[time=1566] Look at Genesis chapter three.
[time=1567] Open up your Bibles.
[time=1568] Go back to the very beginning because it is at the beginning where we see this first unfold.
[time=1573] Sin, three things about sin this morning.
[time=1576] As we begin this discussion on forgiveness, sin, its presence.
[time=1581] Sin, let's talk about its presence.
[time=1584] Let's talk about where it came from.
[time=1585] Let's talk about when and where and how it started.
[time=1588] Look with me at Genesis chapter three verses one to eight.
[time=1591] For some of you here this morning, this will be enlightening.
[time=1594] For some of you this morning, this will be new information.
[time=1598] For others of us here, we can just shake our heads again and realize how this whole
[time=1605] downward spiral started.
[time=1606] It says in Genesis three verse one, "Now the serpent was more crafty than any beast."
[time=1612] We know Satan here takes the form of a serpent, more crafty than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made.
[time=1619] And he said, Satan did through the mouth of this serpent, he said to the woman, "Indeed, has God said you shall not eat from any tree of the garden?" The woman said to the serpent, "From the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat.
[time=1634] But from the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God has said," here you go, target right, "God has said, you shall not eat from it or touch it or you will die." The serpent said to the woman and the serpent keeps saying to you and me moment by moment
[time=1656] today, these same words, yeah right.
[time=1662] You surely will not die.
[time=1664] You see, it's a game he's playing with you Eve, for God knows that in the day you eat from it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like God knowing good and evil when the
[time=1676] woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was a delight to the eyes and that the tree was desirable to make one wise.
[time=1684] She took from it fruit and ate, target missed, hamartia, sin enters the picture.
[time=1695] And she gave also to her husband who was with her and he ate.
[time=1702] Watch this now.
[time=1704] See if this doesn't sound familiar.
[time=1706] See if this isn't a feeling and a realization that you can't like myself identify with.
[time=1713] Then the eyes of both of them were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loin coverings because they were ashamed.
[time=1725] They were embarrassed.
[time=1726] They now realized for the very first time what it meant to be separated.
[time=1733] Verse 8 breaks my heart every time I read it.
[time=1736] They heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day.
[time=1742] And you see, for days and days and days and weeks and weeks and weeks prior to this, they had heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden and it had been a joyful thing.
[time=1751] You see, because their maker, their friend, their God was coming to engage in relationship
[time=1757] with them and it was a beautiful thing.
[time=1760] But see now the mark had been missed.
[time=1762] The choice had been made.
[time=1764] Now there's separation.
[time=1765] Now there, what does it say?
[time=1768] And they hid.
[time=1770] And the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees
[time=1776] of the garden.
[time=1779] And there it starts.
[time=1782] On through the Old Testament and on into the new, says in Romans chapter 3 verse 23, I've
[time=1788] had thousands of conversations, you know, with thousands of people over the years and not one of them has ever looked me in the eye and argued with this.
[time=1796] I doubt any of you will as well for how many have sinned and fallen what?
[time=1803] Short.
[time=1806] You're tossing balls and sometimes you try really hard and sometimes you don't.
[time=1812] And we just day after day, moment by moment, fall short, sin, its presence is undeniable.
[time=1820] Its power, write this down if you're taking notes, not only is it present, but it is powerful.
[time=1826] Go to Romans, stay there if you're turned there, just stay there.
[time=1829] But if you didn't turn to Romans 7, I want you to just catch a glimpse of the power, the battle, if you will, that sin brings with it.
[time=1838] It is an amazing thing.
[time=1840] Is it all powerful?
[time=1842] No, no, but it is very, very powerful.
[time=1846] Sin's power, captured here in an amazing way by Paul.
[time=1849] Look at Romans chapter 7.
[time=1852] Go to Romans chapter 7, look with me if you would at verse 15.
[time=1855] Now don't forget who this is, okay?
[time=1857] This is the apostle Paul himself.
[time=1861] This is one of the greatest, most godliest men who ever walked the face of the earth.
[time=1866] This is Paul, this is the guy who meets Christ himself on the Damascus road.
[time=1871] This is Paul who writes the letters that fill up most of the New Testament.
[time=1875] This is Paul full of character and grace and love and wisdom.
[time=1879] This is Paul who's writings inspired by God today provide strength and endurance for millions.
[time=1886] This is Paul.
[time=1888] And Paul says, "For what I am doing, I do not understand, for I am not practicing what
[time=1896] I would like to do, but I'm doing the very thing I hate."
[time=1902] Look at verse 17, "So now no longer am I the one doing it, but sin which dwells in me.
[time=1909] For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is in my flesh.
[time=1913] For the willing is present in me, but the doing of the good is not.
[time=1918] For the good that I want, I do not do, but I practice the very evil that I do not want."
[time=1924] This is Paul.
[time=1927] But if I am doing the very thing I do not want, I am no longer the one doing it, but sin which dwells in me.
[time=1935] I find them the principle that evil is present in me, the one who wants to do good.
[time=1941] "For I joyfully concur, I agree willingly," he says, "I joyfully concur with the law of
[time=1949] God in the inner man." Raise your hand if you identify with that.
[time=1954] You in the inner man, you joyfully concur, you say, "Yeah, that's right."
[time=1960] But verse 23, "But I see a different law than the members of my body."
[time=1966] Raise your hand if you identify with that, waging war against the law of my mind and
[time=1973] making me a prisoner of the law of sin which is in my members.
[time=1980] All powerful, no, but what a fight, what a battle, what an amazing reality.
[time=1991] I mean, those of us that know him, those of us that have fully surrendered, our hearts and lives to him, we've drawn that line, we've put that stake in the ground and we've said, "I'm in, I want to follow you." And with that comes great strength and with that comes great hope and with that comes a new heart and a new mind and a new opportunity to live in the power of Christ.
[time=2014] But you know what?
[time=2015] Nowhere does it say, "The battle will be done."
[time=2021] As it won't be until the day we're gone.
[time=2026] Sin is present, sin is powerful and lastly here, just look, there's a penalty that comes
[time=2034] with it.
[time=2036] Romans 8, just a chapter over from Romans 7, look at Romans 8, look at Romans 8, verse
[time=2045] 12, "So then brethren, we are under obligation, not to the flesh."
[time=2051] That should in your mind take you back to chapter 7 where he was talking about the battle of the flesh.
[time=2056] The flesh is equated with sin, the sinful nature, the sinful remnant.
[time=2060] So then brethren, we are not under obligation.
[time=2062] We are under obligation, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh, for if you
[time=2068] are living according to the flesh it says you must die, but if by the Spirit you are
[time=2075] if by the Spirit, not by you, not by your strength, not by your might, but if by the Spirit you are putting to death the deeds of the body you will live.
[time=2084] See there is a consequence, there is a penalty that comes with sin.
[time=2088] Romans 6, just back a few pages, many of you know the verse, Romans 6, 23, "For the wages
[time=2096] of sin is," what, death.
[time=2100] Death meaning there, don't miss it again, separation.
[time=2103] The wages, the result of sin in the eternal, in the eternal picture, separation between
[time=2110] me and God, the wages of sin, the result, what comes with the payday of my sin is separation
[time=2119] from God.
[time=2120] In the everyday of life it's separation between you and your wife, separation between you and your husband, separation between you and your kids.
[time=2129] When sin enters in, see the chasm comes and there is this division, there is this distancing,
[time=2135] there is this separation and that separation.
[time=2145] That's a nasty deal, that's a hard one.
[time=2152] You in this room this morning some have never received the forgiveness of sin that only Jesus can bring.
[time=2158] See, God gave His Son.
[time=2162] We celebrated that last week, His broken body and His spilled blood, all of it, so sin
[time=2170] could be covered, so life could be offered, greatest act of forgiveness ever offered and
[time=2177] it's still being offered today.
[time=2179] And this morning we hope that those of you that are in that stage of life on your spiritual
[time=2186] journey, we hope these words, God's words ring true with you, but you know what, there's also a lot of you in this room and see you've been sinned against.
[time=2199] There are many in this room and you have been sinned against, the sin of another lived out
[time=2207] in your life and it has left you bitter, it has left you confused, it has left you suffering
[time=2214] with the wounds and scars of adultery, molestation, abuse, gossip, slander, dishonesty, criticism,
[time=2223] broken promises and more.
[time=2226] And for some in this room you see these acts that have been perpetrated against you, these things that have been done, this sin that has been carried out.
[time=2236] For some in the room this morning you see it happened a week ago or two, for others of you it was two, three, four, five years ago, still others of you here in this room this morning, you still today carry with you the wounds and the scars and the hurt and the bitterness
[time=2251] and the shame of things that took place 20, 25, 30 years ago.
[time=2259] And whoever you are, whatever it is that's been done, whatever choice it was that got
[time=2265] made by Him or by her or by them.
[time=2271] See God's Word and God's truth calls you and I to a very, very challenging place this
[time=2280] morning because God's Word reminds you and it reminds me that there is a response that
[time=2291] we are to offer and so I ask you this morning, what are you going to do with all of that?
[time=2301] What are you going to do with all that you have carried for so long?
[time=2309] Let me ask if you would to just bow your heads just for a moment, would you?
[time=2316] What I really want to ask you this morning is this.
[time=2319] What I really want to ask you this morning is what would real love do?
[time=2325] Whoever you are, whatever you've been through, whatever it is that you have had to endure
[time=2331] and with all that it has brought you emotionally and spiritually and personally and physically
[time=2337] in your life, what are you going to do with it?
[time=2342] What would real love do?
[time=2350] Corbin mentioned earlier that God is love and real love sent His Son to offer forgiveness
[time=2363] for all the pathetic, despicable, unspeakable things that you and I have done.
[time=2374] Real love as exemplified through Him you see it forgives.
[time=2382] And so Father God, in these remaining minutes we pray that Your Word and its power and its
[time=2391] strength God would draw broken, troubled, confused hearts to a place God of recognition
[time=2402] of Your great love and the ability that You give to help us down roads like this.
[time=2409] God help us learn more here.
[time=2411] In these next few minutes it's about real love and its power to forgive.
[time=2415] In Your name we pray, Amen.
[time=2418] Well, real love forgives.
[time=2423] May 17th, 1996, was one of the most awkward days I experienced in my life.
[time=2430] I got a call from a friend of mine that told me one of my best friends had just been in
[time=2436] a racing accident at the Indianapolis 500.
[time=2439] And I left messages at my friend, the race car driver's house, his apartment in Indianapolis's
[time=2445] garage at the track, his cell phone and his voicemail I think in cold water.
[time=2452] And I didn't think much about it.
[time=2453] An auction was going on that day at Cruise Auction Park and it was, I think, a Friday.
[time=2459] And my dad sent something was wrong and he went home and he started watching on TV if
[time=2466] anything had happened.
[time=2468] And he had called me and said that they were playing on ESPN revisiting video clips of people
[time=2478] who lost their lives at the track and I said, oh dad, it's not that kind of a deal.
[time=2483] I heard something by now.
[time=2485] And they called me back just a few minutes later and he says, Mitch Scott's dead.
[time=2490] So Susan was working the auction with me and I said, I'm going to go and she was going to take the girls and I said, I'm just going to go home and I'm going to be alone.
[time=2498] And what was unique about this experience was I went home and I watched over and over and over again on ESPN and all the news channels.
[time=2506] I watched him die.
[time=2509] And what had happened was he was testing a car and he had a faulty tire.
[time=2514] And that tire just exploded and came apart and then the wheel hit the pavement at 200
[time=2521] miles an hour at Indianapolis 500 on a track and turned to it becomes like an ice effect and there's nothing you can do.
[time=2528] So what I watched again and again was he spun twice.
[time=2531] And I kept thinking about this as I would see it.
[time=2535] Alive, alive, dead.
[time=2541] He spun twice.
[time=2542] Alive, alive and he hits the wall, dead.
[time=2548] And you know, the interesting thing about that is because one tire went bad, no matter
[time=2554] how tightly he held on to the steering wheel, he was going to hit the wall.
[time=2561] And in our lives, no matter how tightly we hold on to the steering wheel of our lives,
[time=2570] if we haven't let go of four things, if we let go of even three of the four, we're going
[time=2577] to have some relational damage, we're going to hit the wall relationally.
[time=2582] And I want to talk today about how real love forgives.
[time=2586] How real love forgives.
[time=2587] If you open your Bibles to Matthew 6, there's this concept of freedom in Christ and the
[time=2596] Bible.
[time=2597] Paul writes about it in Ephesians 5-1.
[time=2598] Don't you love it when I say turn to Matthew 6 and I start quoting Ephesians 5.
[time=2602] So wait, preachers do it.
[time=2603] Anyway, freedom in Christ and it's freedom from the things.
[time=2606] Hell, he just talked about freedom from the penalty of sin, freedom from the power of sin,
[time=2612] and on the other side in heaven, freedom from the presence of sin.
[time=2615] And that's freedom in Christ.
[time=2617] And Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount teaches people how to pray together, and this is kind of the core text for us today.
[time=2623] And Matthew 6, 12, he says, this is how he's teaching us to pray, forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debt tours.
[time=2633] Jesus Lewis says that word as is the most sobering two-letter word in all of Scripture because we are actually praying to God to forgive us in the same fashion with the same ease or difficulty that we forgive others.
[time=2645] It's a powerful thing to think about.
[time=2649] And then you go down to verse 14, for if you forgive men when they sin against you, your Heavenly Father will also forgive you.
[time=2655] But if you do not forgive men, their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.
[time=2660] We know this isn't a one-for-one deal because Psalm 103 10 says there's not a one-for-one punishment to our sins.
[time=2668] But if your life is characterized and known by not forgiving, you have a problem.
[time=2677] This is a sobering thought.
[time=2680] Truly forgiven by God means that I issue forgiveness to others.
[time=2683] And forgiveness literally means there's a definition.
[time=2685] To give away, for as a prefix means a way, give is give to give away or to let go.
[time=2691] And we're going to let go of four things.
[time=2694] Because of sin, real love forgives and we let go of four things.
[time=2697] The first one is revenge.
[time=2698] We're going to let go and I put this at the front driver's side, wheel or tire of a car.
[time=2705] We're going to look at four wheels on a car of revenge because oncoming relational traffic,
[time=2711] when I want revenge, when I want to retaliate, I just want to like boom, go right into him.
[time=2717] And that's what revenge is in our lives.
[time=2718] That's what retaliation is in our lives.
[time=2720] We want to take repayment on ourselves.
[time=2722] Very interesting.
[time=2723] The Bible in Leviticus 1918, one of the key passages in all of Scripture, it's the horizontal part of the great commandment.
[time=2729] Paul says the whole law summed up on it.
[time=2731] Paul said nothing matters if you don't do this.
[time=2733] And that is don't seek revenge or bear a grudge against your people.
[time=2741] But love your neighbor as yourself.
[time=2744] Real love doesn't seek revenge but loves my neighbor as myself.
[time=2749] Listen what Jesus says in Matthew 5, still in the Sermon on the Mount, verses 38 through 42, "You have heard that it was said that I, for I, tooth, for a tooth, but I tell you, do not resist an evil person.
[time=2761] If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also." This was an imagery that Jesus is using for an insult.
[time=2768] We use the same imagery today.
[time=2769] That was a backhanded comment.
[time=2772] So he's saying if you're insulted, this is just Proverbs 12, 16, says ignore an insult.
[time=2776] He says, you know, just ignore it.
[time=2778] Ignore the insult.
[time=2780] And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let them have your cloak as well.
[time=2783] If someone forces you to go one mile, Roman soldiers could do that with anybody.
[time=2787] They could stop anybody, say, here, carry this stuff and let's go, we're going a mile.
[time=2790] Call your plans on hold.
[time=2792] Jesus says, don't retaliate.
[time=2793] Don't spend all that time thinking about revenge and retaliation.
[time=2796] Go two miles.
[time=2800] Give to the one who asks you and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.
[time=2804] Here's why.
[time=2805] Freedom from the penalty of sin.
[time=2808] Hebrews 10-10 says, "All sin is judged at the cross of Jesus Christ, where his justice and his mercy come together to form his grace or forgiveness.
[time=2817] Forgiveness is the only concept that will perfectly wed justice and mercy." Yes, I need to punish my kids.
[time=2824] Yes, there needs to be law of the land.
[time=2825] Yes, there need to be consequences for sin, otherwise be chaos, but yes, there needs to
[time=2833] be mercy.
[time=2835] And all sin is judged at the cross of Jesus Christ.
[time=2838] Hebrews 10-18 goes on to say, no one's going to add anything to it.
[time=2842] Do all the revenge and all the retaliation, do any kind of sacrifice you want.
[time=2846] I'm not going to add to it because all sin is judged and paid for, the penalty is paid at the cross of Jesus Christ.
[time=2853] Wheel number one, that you've got to let go of his revenge and retaliation.
[time=2856] The second wheel is bitterness.
[time=2860] Let go of bitterness.
[time=2860] It's literally a word picture in the Greek.
[time=2863] It means poison.
[time=2864] It's poison of the heart.
[time=2867] Ephesians 4-31 says, "Get rid of it all.
[time=2872] Get rid of how much?
[time=2874] All bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice." And the very next verse says, "Be kind and compassionate to one another.
[time=2883] Forgive each other just as God in Christ forgave you."
[time=2889] Really been forgiven?
[time=2890] Then you forgive.
[time=2892] Not letting go of bitterness is not forgiveness.
[time=2896] It's a poison of the heart.
[time=2899] It's usually a poison because we blame.
[time=2900] We either blame God.
[time=2901] I had to work through that with my buddy.
[time=2903] I lost at the racetrack.
[time=2905] I went through stacks of theological works and Bible, and I would sob, and I was trying to work through all that, and maybe in your case today, maybe what you can't forgive.
[time=2915] Maybe what you need to be forgiven from.
[time=2917] Maybe it's because you're blaming God.
[time=2918] But we don't just blame God.
[time=2920] We blame other people, and in many cases we blame ourselves.
[time=2924] With my buddy, I thought about if I had just said this, if we had just done what we said we were going to do.
[time=2928] Remember in vivid detail our last conversation before he died.
[time=2933] You just think about all that.
[time=2936] Hebrews 12, 15 says, "When you harbor bitterness, when you harbor that in your soul, you're missing out on the grace of God." And James 3, 14, and 15 says, "That's of the devil when you do that." Very clear.
[time=2949] Job 36, 13, one of his friends says, "The godless in heart harbor resentment.
[time=2955] The godless in heart harbor bitterness." First will we need to let go of his revenge, the second will is bitterness, the third will is regret, regret.
[time=2967] And that's the thought that I could change the past.
[time=2969] This is big.
[time=2971] The thought that I could change the past.
[time=2972] Paul writes in Philippians 3, 13, "I forget what is behind me.
[time=2976] I can't live back there, and neither can you, and neither can I.
[time=2978] I cannot live back there, but I go forward because that's where it's headed.
[time=2982] I can only live in the present." In St. Corinthians 7, 10, he also writes that, "Godly sorrow, if I need to repent to somebody,
[time=2991] if I need to go seek forgiveness, and also when forgiveness is given, there is no regret.
[time=2996] We're not going to hold back and revisit these things in the past.
[time=3000] No regret.
[time=3002] We need to let go of the thought I could change the past.
[time=3005] We let go of bitterness.
[time=3007] Over here, we let go of the first one was revenge or retaliation.
[time=3011] We let go of the thought I could change the past.
[time=3012] The fourth thing we need to let go of is withholding a blessing, not wishing one well before God.
[time=3021] In the church, we're kind of notorious for some of this stuff.
[time=3028] Sometimes we can do pretty well on the retaliation thing, and we can let go of that.
[time=3032] Sometimes we can let go of bitterness, but that becomes a very safe place to be bitter,
[time=3038] to go ahead and on the outside look like we forgave, but inside we're bitter and we're holding on to it.
[time=3042] We're mulling over and it's poisonous like a cancer inside of me.
[time=3047] We have a tough time coming back here to the rear of the car for letting go of regret, the thought I could change the past.
[time=3052] But I think we have a really, really, really tough time, letting go of not blessing or
[time=3059] wishing someone well before God.
[time=3061] I remember when I tried to do this, I had read a passage we're going to read here, and I thought, "Gosh, that means I got to pray for this competitor of mine who had just abused the vulnerability I had with him, he was also a customer," and I thought he had done some really, really bad things, and I read this passage I'm going to read to you, and I said, "Okay, I'm going to pray for him," and I couldn't do it.
[time=3082] I couldn't pray the blessing, so I just asked God to help me, and to change me, and that's what we need to do, and it's Matthew 5, 43 through 48, the next passage there in the Sermon
[time=3092] on the Mountain.
[time=3093] Jesus says, "You've heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'" I tell you, "Love your enemies, pray for those who persecute you, that you may be sons of
[time=3101] your father in heaven, revealing his character and presence.
[time=3104] He causes his son to rise on the evil and the good, his grace and his love is on everybody, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous, and an agrarian economy, rain is a good thing.
[time=3114] If you love those who love you, what word will you get?
[time=3117] Are not even the tax collectors doing that?
[time=3119] And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than others?
[time=3122] Do not even pagans do that.
[time=3124] Even the mafia loves those who love them, but Jesus says, "Reveal God's character and
[time=3131] presence and love your enemies, be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect, be complete, be impartial, be loving, love everyone, release that grace to everybody."
[time=3144] So forgiveness, let's go of revenge.
[time=3148] Forgiveness, let's go of bitterness, that poison inside of us.
[time=3154] Let's go of regret, the thought I could change the past, and forgiveness, let's go of withholding
[time=3162] a blessing not wishing someone well before God.
[time=3170] No matter how tightly my buddy held on to the steering wheel, because he had a bad wheel,
[time=3178] because he had a tire that was faulty, he hit the wall.
[time=3185] And if you don't let go of every one of these four wheels, you will not be experiencing
[time=3191] forgiveness and you will hit the wall relationally.
[time=3194] And it's really interesting that that will never happen.
[time=3199] That will never happen in your life or mine if I don't first let go of the steering wheel of my life and fully surrender my life to Jesus Christ.
[time=3210] Real love receives forgiveness from a God who is love.
[time=3216] And then my life is characterized and known by my issuing of forgiveness to others.
[time=3222] Real grace received means real grace issued.
[time=3225] In Luke 1248, Jesus talking about this very thing says, "If you receive grace, your life becomes characterized and known by as issuing grace." Forgiveness is the vehicle that transports grace from one heart to another.
[time=3243] Forgiveness is the vehicle that transports grace from one life, one heart to another.
[time=3249] And that will never happen if I don't take my hands off the steering wheel of my life and let Christ put his hands on the steering wheel of my life.
[time=3258] Ephesians 2, 4 and 5, Paul says it this way.
[time=3262] I love these verses.
[time=3263] But because of his great love for us, God who has rich in mercy made us alive with Christ.
[time=3271] Even when we were dead in transgressions, it is by grace you have been saved.
[time=3277] Grace, life, grace, life.
[time=3284] Even though in a race there is no checkered flag until there is a white flag.
[time=3295] Tell me there is one lap left.
[time=3298] And someday each one of us are going to stand before the Father and there will be no checkered
[time=3304] flag for us.
[time=3305] There will be no grace of life eternally for us if we have not first wave that white flag of full surrender to Jesus Christ.
[time=3314] And taking the hands off of that wheel and putting his hands on the wheel of our life.
[time=3318] And Jesus says back in the Lord's prayer, "If you receive forgiveness from me, you're going to forgive others.
[time=3324] But if you don't, you're not." And it's not just a made up deal.
[time=3332] The drama you saw was based on a true story.
[time=3335] It's a story about Elizabeth Morris, Lee Strobel, in his book, "God's Outrageous Claims Rights About Her," and Elizabeth lost her son to a drunk driver.
[time=3348] And Elizabeth began, and the drunk driver got on probation.
[time=3351] And so she goes down this road of revenge and bitterness.
[time=3358] And she pictures herself hitting him and pinning him against a tree and watching him
[time=3364] suffer and die.
[time=3366] The bitterness became so strong she called it a cancer in her soul.
[time=3369] And she began to track him down and try to find the one who hit her son and killed him
[time=3376] so she could find him breaking his probation and put him back in prison.
[time=3382] She couldn't let go of the thought that she could change the past and she would not wish
[time=3388] him well before God.
[time=3389] And she knew there was only one place to have the freedom in Christ.
[time=3394] We will let go of these four things.
[time=3396] And she remembered the one who died on a cross, the one who gave his son his one and only son so that she might have life.
[time=3404] And she began to let God change her heart.
[time=3407] And you'll never be able to forgive unless you let Jesus Christ do this through you.
[time=3410] You have to humble your heart first before you'll forgive or receive forgiveness.
[time=3416] And she had her relationships were damaged with her husband who was a preacher.
[time=3421] Well as they pursued this boy, his name was Tommy, they developed a relationship with him.
[time=3429] And actually her husband, Elizabeth's husband baptized Tommy and Tommy came to a relationship with Jesus Christ, getting his hands off that steering wheel.
[time=3439] And Elizabeth's husband ended up marrying Tommy to his new wife and every day they go
[time=3446] to church together in the same car.
[time=3450] This isn't fantasy, this is reality.
[time=3452] Real love forgives.
[time=3454] And so here's what I want to ask you to do.
[time=3456] I want you to whatever it is in your life, I want you to let go of those four things.
[time=3460] That's forgiveness.
[time=3461] If you've never been forgiven by God, you've got to deal with that.
[time=3464] You've got to get the hands off the steering wheel and you've got to wave that white flag a full surrender to Jesus Christ and let his forgiveness be issued through you.
[time=3474] I tried it once for two weeks.
[time=3475] I decided I was going to instantly forgive anything that happened to me.
[time=3478] I shared it with you before.
[time=3479] It got to be funny on the third day, because it was like, is that all you got?
[time=3483] And that's what I want you to do.
[time=3485] I want you to take this next week and I want you to let go of these four things every single time that you're wrong.
[time=3490] And let's just see what happens.
[time=3492] Let's pray.
[time=3494] God, we thank you for who you are.
[time=3498] We love you.
[time=3502] And God, justice and mercy come together in you.
[time=3505] And there's ultimate clarity at the cross of Jesus Christ where all sin is paid for.
[time=3511] But God, to appropriate that to our lives, we need to get our hands off the steering wheel.
[time=3516] And we need to let you change our hearts so we can issue the grace we've received to those around us.
[time=3521] We love you, God, and we pray that you will help us to let go of our retaliation or revenge, let go of our bitterness, let go of the thought we could change the past, and let go of not
[time=3532] wishing one well before God.
[time=3534] And God, we understand that that won't happen until we let go of control of our own lives and now allow you to transform us.
[time=3541] Make us radical issuers of forgiveness, God.
[time=3543] The greatest evangelistic tool in the world is to forgive.
[time=3547] Help us to forgive others into the kingdom of forgiveness.
[time=3550] In Jesus' mighty name I pray, and all God's people agreed and said, Amen.
