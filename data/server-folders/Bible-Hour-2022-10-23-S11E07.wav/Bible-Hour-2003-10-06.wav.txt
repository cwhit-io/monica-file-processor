[time=933] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=937] And it's great to be with you again.
[time=939] I want to just share with you the fact that as I do what I do with my days, as I have the privilege of walking through life with a whole lot of people, sitting and talking with folks and restaurants, appointments in my office,
[time=955] even involved with the many, many people on the team here at Black Hawk Ministries, I am amazed. I really am.
[time=963] I am absolutely shocked at how many people I bump into these days.
[time=969] 20-year-olds, 30-year-olds, 40-year-olds, 50-year-olds, people who to this day have never heard the words, "I love you."
[time=981] Spoken from a dad or a mom or a significant adult.
[time=986] I mean, I bump into people almost on a weekly basis who haven't been hugged by a parent since they were a small child.
[time=998] There are people in your world and in mind who today are starving
[time=1004] for the affection and the expression of love that God calls us to.
[time=1010] And as we've been studying and looking at this topic of real love, we come today to this notion that real love, God's love, expresses itself.
[time=1021] It doesn't stay quiet. It doesn't stay to itself.
[time=1025] It isn't self-serving. It isn't timid.
[time=1028] No, it gets out there. It writes a note. It gives a gift.
[time=1032] It spends quality time. It hugs. It holds. It says.
[time=1038] And that's what God did.
[time=1040] God had all this love in Him for you and for me.
[time=1045] And what did He do with it? Did He just stuff it inside? Did it just sit in there?
[time=1050] No, no, what He did was He allowed His own son to be taken to a cross.
[time=1056] And Jesus Christ was falsely accused, beaten, tortured, and murdered, hung on a cross
[time=1064] for you and for me so that we could have life.
[time=1068] God's love was expressed. He did something.
[time=1073] He let us see and know in a very clear statement that His love for us was great.
[time=1079] And you and I have the opportunity day in and day out to make very clear statements of our love.
[time=1086] Do you? Are you saying it? Are you expressing it?
[time=1091] And not just to people, but also to God.
[time=1094] We have the chance to be people whose love is expressed to others and to Him.
[time=1098] And I hope today as you watch that you would just open up your heart in life.
[time=1102] Maybe you need to be one who expresses your love in more meaningful, personal, passionate ways.
[time=1112] Some say I'm a man of few words. Always have been, I guess.
[time=1117] I'm not into greeting cards or flowers.
[time=1121] I just believe in saying what needs to be said and let my actions speak for me.
[time=1127] I'm a good father and I provide well for my family.
[time=1132] My youngest daughter Amy is a senior at Purdue this year.
[time=1137] We didn't think she'd get this far.
[time=1139] She suffers from anorexia and had to be hospitalized last year.
[time=1145] When we went to see her she was so frail and tiny and she dropped to 92 pounds.
[time=1156] She had these IVs and tubes sticking out of her.
[time=1162] And she was crying for attention. Attention she wasn't getting from me.
[time=1169] She whispered to me, "Come on, say it, Dad.
[time=1177] You can't even say it now to me, can you?"
[time=1183] My little girl just wanted to hear Daddy say, "I love you."
[time=1192] My name is James Roberts and now I know real love speaks.
[time=1205] It is so good to see you. We're still thankful that you're here.
[time=1209] And many of you have been here for a long, long time.
[time=1212] Others of you here for the first time, some of you fall in between there somewhere.
[time=1216] For the last five weeks, we've been involved in a series called Real Love.
[time=1225] And if you've missed it, then you've missed it.
[time=1228] It has been a wonderful time.
[time=1230] And I just want to remind you this morning as we jump into our fifth week.
[time=1234] I want to just take you back to where we began, if I could.
[time=1237] Would you open your Bibles to 1 John chapter 4?
[time=1241] Way back at the back of your New Testament.
[time=1243] I want to go to 1 John chapter 4, and I want to just kind of start this morning, where we began several weeks ago as we introduced this topic of Real Love.
[time=1253] 1 John chapter 4, I'm going to pick it up at verse 7.
[time=1259] If you were here, you'll remember that we said this, that the God's Word says, "Beloved, let us love one another." Love is from God, and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God.
[time=1273] The one who does not love does not know God, for God is love.
[time=1284] People, that's where it begins.
[time=1286] And what a great opportunity it was, that first week to be reminded of the fact that God is love.
[time=1293] And you see only in Him, only in full surrender to Him, only in relationship with Him, only in your personal connection
[time=1304] to the living God through what Jesus Christ provided you on the cross, only in relationship with Him.
[time=1314] Are you and I able to access this thing called Real Love?
[time=1319] Outside of relationship with Him, you can call it a whole lot of things, but it falls short and it isn't Real Love.
[time=1328] Real Love is available.
[time=1330] Real Love is made manifest in God.
[time=1333] God is love, and we have the opportunity to express it in our lives.
[time=1339] We have the opportunity to extend it in our lives when we know Him.
[time=1346] And that is where we begin. We went on to talk about how Real Love serves.
[time=1350] In week three, we talked about how Real Love forgives.
[time=1354] Last week, Mitch did an amazing job just reminding us of the two greatest commands,
[time=1360] loving God and loving others, and showed that when we really love Him, when in relationship with Him, we're growing in our story, His work in our lives,
[time=1370] we then have the opportunity to share that with others.
[time=1375] We then have the privilege of having experienced His love.
[time=1378] We have the chance to share that love with the hopes that someday, at some point in time,
[time=1384] they would be able to experience His love, an amazing picture of three-story love.
[time=1390] You know what else Real Love does?
[time=1392] And this is where we find ourselves this morning.
[time=1395] Real Love expresses itself.
[time=1398] Write it down. If you're taking notes this morning, go ahead and write that down.
[time=1401] Real Love, week five, Real Love people, it expresses itself.
[time=1407] That's right, it speaks, it cheers, it applauds, it cries.
[time=1411] Real Love hugs, it writes a note, it warns, it waves the yellow flag, it encourages, it offers quality time, acts of selfless service.
[time=1420] Real Love gives a thoughtful gift. You know what?
[time=1423] Bottom line, Real Love isn't kept to itself.
[time=1426] No, it's not stuffed down inside. Real Love gets out.
[time=1431] Real Love is expressed. Love not expressed isn't love.
[time=1438] Don't miss that. Basic but very profound truth.
[time=1442] Love not expressed. Love not let out isn't love.
[time=1449] Now in the end it's selfish pride. Real Love acts.
[time=1453] Real Love moves. Real Love expresses. Look at John, chapter 15.
[time=1458] I don't think it'll be on the screen, but go back to the Gospel of John.
[time=1461] Matthew, Mark, Luke, John. Go to John 15, 13.
[time=1466] Speaking of God and knowing again that Real Love begins with God, let's just be reminded of the fact that God's love was expressed.
[time=1474] It wasn't kept inside. It wasn't stuffed down in the deepest parts of who we was.
[time=1479] No, we have a great example here as we begin this morning of its expression.
[time=1484] The way he expressed it, John 15, 13. Greater Love has no man than this,
[time=1490] that one lay down his life for his friends.
[time=1495] Greater Love is no one than this, that one laid down his life for his friends.
[time=1500] And in Romans 5 we see the fruition of that. Go to Romans 5.
[time=1504] Just pass the book of Acts. Keep going to Romans 5, where it says, right there in verse 6, for while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly, the love of God, expressed, not kept inside, not hid to himself. No.
[time=1524] He laid it out on the line. He expresses it in the sacrificial death of his son.
[time=1531] In real love, God's love, it expresses itself as you see there in powerful, powerful ways.
[time=1538] This morning I'd like every one of you here to consider three ways.
[time=1541] Three very important ways that real love is expressed.
[time=1546] Could have been 6, could have been 9, could have easily been 28, but we'll just take time to look at three this morning, okay?
[time=1553] Three very, very important ways.
[time=1556] You're young, elementary age, high school, middle school, student, college age, you know, young adult either way. Senior adults, it applies to every single person
[time=1567] in this room, because every single person in this room has been given the opportunity to really love. Three ways. One's going to be toward him, the other two towards others. Let's start with the one towards him.
[time=1580] Here you go. You're ready, write it down. Real love is expressive and it celebrates God. Real love celebrates God. It celebrates him.
[time=1592] The scriptures in John 4, if you remember that story there of the woman at the well, in that story as it unfolds, Jesus explains to her that he is looking for God is looking for those who would worship him in spirit and in truth.
[time=1608] Remember that saying? Looking for those who would worship him, looking for those who would celebrate him, looking for those who would be devoted to him in spirit and in truth. And we've talked about that before, the basic meaning there is this. He longs for a people who would come to him willing to worship him emotionally, while at the same time being led by
[time=1631] and guided by truth, not being led by or guided by their emotions,
[time=1637] but a people who would be expressive in their love and praise and thanks to him
[time=1643] guided by the word of God he is looking for, he longs for.
[time=1648] It honors God when he has the people with stirred hearts and passion who are guided by his word, expressing worship to him.
[time=1657] When can you do this? Can you do this when you're alone?
[time=1663] Absolutely. It was wonderful this week to just kind of be flipping through the, looking through and taking note of what's written in the book of Psalms and to see how many times David, when he was on the run, hiding in what? Hiding in caves would write these Psalms and express great worship to God there alone in the dark, fearing for his life with nobody around and no instruments and no gathering, just David in a cave before God and you read some of these Psalms that he wrote and they are full of great expression to God.
[time=1700] We also can worship him in the assembly.
[time=1704] We also have the opportunity to celebrate God, to have our love for him be expressive when we come through these doors and gather together as a family to come before him.
[time=1716] According to God's word, that will look a number of different ways.
[time=1721] According to the Scriptures themselves, there are some postures that are given.
[time=1727] There are some descriptive phrases that are set forth for us that kind of give
[time=1734] us an idea of the kind of celebration, the kind of expressed love for him that
[time=1741] he longs to see.
[time=1746] Notice how we said that? We didn't say kinds of expressions that you feel good
[time=1752] about. Are you feel come to know? It's talking about this book is packed with postures of worship that he longs to see and hear and take note of.
[time=1765] Let's look at just a few, can we? When we celebrate him, we will write this down if you're taking notes, just write this down. We will shout.
[time=1775] We're going to kind of flip through at a rather rapid pace here just so we can keep it going here. Psalm 66 1, and we're going to look at several others.
[time=1784] Look with me at the screens, if you will. When we celebrate him, we will shout God's word says. Psalm 66 1 says, "Shout joyfully to God, all the earth."
[time=1796] We go on from 66 1 to Psalm 98 4 to 6. Look what it says there.
[time=1801] Psalm 98 4, "Shout joyfully to the Lord, all the earth.
[time=1805] Break forth and sing for joy and sing praises, sing praises to the Lord with the
[time=1811] lyre, with the lyre and the sound of melody." In verse 6 it says, "With trumpets and the sound of the horn, shout joyfully before the king, the Lord." From Psalm 98 you can just write this down, go back to Psalm 81 1.
[time=1826] Psalm 81 1 says, "This sing for joy to God our strength.
[time=1831] Shout joyfully to the God of Jacob." And then on in Psalm 95, Psalm 95 1 and 2
[time=1839] says, "Oh come, let us sing for joy to the Lord. Let us shout joyfully
[time=1845] to the rock of our salvation. Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving.
[time=1850] Let us shout joyfully to Him with Psalms.
[time=1855] And on and on we can go. One of those postures that He longs to see and hear
[time=1861] from you and I is a joyful what? Shout.
[time=1865] A joyful what? Shout. That's right.
[time=1870] Sometimes He just longs to hear. What's a shout? Now by shout we don't mean, "Hey!" He's not referring to, "Hey!" He's referring to just five minutes ago.
[time=1881] Worthy is the Lamb. How are you singing that?
[time=1886] How are you lifting that up with whole heart, with everything that was in you?
[time=1893] Because is he worthy? Yes or no? Yeah.
[time=1896] So He longs to hear you say it and sing it and lift it up like it's really, really true and sometimes He longs to hear that in the form of a shout.
[time=1908] And that's a good thing.
[time=1912] Sometimes when we celebrate Him we will be silent.
[time=1918] That's right. Sometimes when we celebrate Him our postures should be one of silence.
[time=1927] Psalm 62 1.
[time=1931] My soul waits. In what? Silence.
[time=1937] My soul waits in silence for God only. From Him is my salvation.
[time=1945] Psalm 65 1. Psalm 65 1 says there will be silence before you.
[time=1953] You see that? There will be silence before you and praise in Zion, O God, and to you the vow will be performed.
[time=1965] Sometimes He longs to hear your shout and sometimes He longs to hear and sense your silence.
[time=1973] And when you really, really love Him you express that love to Him in celebration.
[time=1979] And it looks a lot of different ways. You know what?
[time=1982] Sometimes He wants it to be loud kind of back to the shout thing.
[time=1987] But yeah, write that down.
[time=1989] Sometimes God in heaven longs to hear from you and me a sound of praise that is loud.
[time=1996] I saw this this week. I just wrote it down. Psalm 150. Look with me.
[time=2001] Watch the progression. Psalm 150 verses 1 to 6.
[time=2004] It says, "Praise the Lord. Praise God in His sanctuary. Praise Him in His mighty expanse.
[time=2011] Praise Him for His mighty deeds. Praise Him according to His excellent greatness.
[time=2016] Praise Him with trumpet sound. Praise Him with a harp and lyre.
[time=2021] Verse 4 says, "Praise Him with temporal and dancing." Praise Him with temporal and dancing. Praise Him with stringed instruments and pipe.
[time=2032] Verse 5 it says, "Praise Him with loud symbols." And it's like He kind of comes back and says a little like an even like louder than loud.
[time=2040] Praise Him with resounding symbols. Hit those things hard.
[time=2046] He says, "Praise Him with loud." And then He goes to resounding.
[time=2050] Let everything that has breath. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[time=2055] Sometimes He longs to hear your shout. Sometimes He longs to hear our silence.
[time=2061] Sometimes He longs to hear the worship and the music and the instruments that we bring loudly.
[time=2069] Sometimes when we celebrate Him we will kneel, bow, and weep.
[time=2079] That's right. Sometimes God longs for us and sometimes we see even in Scripture
[time=2085] that our expressive worship takes the form of kneeling, bowing down and even weeping.
[time=2093] Go to 2 Chronicles 1 and 2 Kings 1 and 2 Chronicles back there kind of toward the beginning of the Old Testament.
[time=2100] Go to 2 Chronicles if you will.
[time=2104] Solomon here in the second book of Chronicles chapter, go to chapter 6.
[time=2112] He's dedicating the temple.
[time=2115] The ark has been brought into the temple in 2 Chronicles 5 and now we come to 6 Solomon's in the process of dedicating what's been built.
[time=2125] It says in 2 Chronicles 6, 12, "Then He stood before the altar of the Lord
[time=2132] in the presence of all the assembly of Israel and spread out His hands."
[time=2138] Now Solomon had made a bronze platform, five cubits long, five cubits wide and three cubits high
[time=2145] and had set it in the midst of the court and he stood on it, then knelt on his knees in the presence of all the assembly of Israel
[time=2155] and spread out his hands toward heaven.
[time=2159] Why?
[time=2160] Well, if you go on in verse 14, he said, "Oh God, oh Lord, the God of Israel,
[time=2166] there is no God like you in heaven or on earth, keeping covenant and showing loving kindness to your servants who walk before you with all their heart." It was an act of praise.
[time=2180] It was an act of worship.
[time=2181] It was an act of utter consecration and devotion to him and the thought of it brings him to his knees with hands spread toward heaven.
[time=2193] Look on the screen at Psalm 95, Psalm 95, 6, come let us worship and what?
[time=2200] Come let us worship and bow down.
[time=2202] Let us, you and me, those of you in the assembly who are aware of the kind of God He is
[time=2208] who know the things that He has done.
[time=2212] Let us worship and bow down.
[time=2214] Let us kneel, it says, before the Lord our Maker.
[time=2220] This, this, this is amazing.
[time=2223] Go to Nehemiah.
[time=2224] Just if you were in Second Chronicles, just keep going.
[time=2228] Go to Nehemiah.
[time=2230] This is a passage that I think I saw several, several years ago and it's one of those passages that you just, I don't know how it happened, but I just kind of lost track of it.
[time=2241] And this week as we were considering these very truths, it kind of came back to me and as I became reacquainted with it again, I was just utterly amazed at what I saw here and I believe you will be as well.
[time=2256] Sometimes people, when we celebrate Him, sometimes when we come before Him, He longs for a posture of submission and reverence, kneeling, bowing, even weeping.
[time=2271] Look at Nehemiah 8.
[time=2274] I think the screen will have verse 2.
[time=2276] I'm going to go ahead and start at verse 1 and then we'll just follow along.
[time=2280] And all the people, let me just say, it had been a long, difficult period of time for the Israelites.
[time=2288] Things have not gone well.
[time=2290] And now after years and years, their back in the wall has been built and the reading of the law, the reading of the Scriptures,
[time=2301] the opportunity and privilege to take in God's truth.
[time=2305] It had been something they had been without for a while.
[time=2307] And all the people, verse 1, and all the people gathered as one man at the square, which was in front of the Watergate.
[time=2314] And they asked Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the Lord had given Israel.
[time=2320] Then Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly of men, women, and all who could listen with understanding.
[time=2327] This would have been about 25, 35, somewhere between they say 30 and 40 or so thousand people.
[time=2334] And I want you to picture that just for a moment.
[time=2337] Because there's great significance in that picture that you just painted in your mind.
[time=2341] Let's say 40,000 people longing for and asking for the Scriptures.
[time=2351] On the first day of the seventh month, he read from it, verse 3, he read from it before the square, which was in front of the Watergate, from early morning, which would have been sixish or so, from early morning until midday, noon to one.
[time=2368] In the presence of men and women, those who could understand and all the people were attentive to the book of the law.
[time=2375] You go down to verse 5.
[time=2377] Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, for he was standing above all the people.
[time=2383] And when he opened it, when he opens the book before the 30 or 40,000 people,
[time=2389] all the people stood up.
[time=2393] He didn't ask him to.
[time=2395] Promptings didn't come on the side screens.
[time=2397] No, he just opens the book, begins to read and they stand.
[time=2402] Then Ezra blessed the Lord, the great God.
[time=2405] And all the people answered, amen, amen, while lifting up their hands.
[time=2410] Then they bowed low and worshiped the Lord with their faces to the ground.
[time=2418] Look at verse 9.
[time=2424] Then Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who taught the people, said to all the people, "This day is holy to the Lord, your God, do not mourn or weep." That's right, weep.
[time=2438] Watch what it says.
[time=2439] For all the people were weeping when they heard the words of the law.
[time=2448] Weeping, bowed low, 6 a.m. to noon.
[time=2464] Oh, please, oh, please, don't stop.
[time=2470] Faces in the gravel, arms spread.
[time=2475] Oh, please, they said more, more, more, more, more, more, more.
[time=2480] Weeping.
[time=2483] Because they got to hear this.
[time=2487] They got to take it in.
[time=2492] And we go home and toss it on the shelf, hoping we can find it next Sunday.
[time=2500] You and I.
[time=2504] We skip through it flippantly.
[time=2509] We paste it on placards and see it on cards and hear it in messages.
[time=2515] None of that's bad.
[time=2516] I'm just saying.
[time=2517] Do you understand?
[time=2518] Do you get a glimpse here?
[time=2520] For their utter love for God, their utter respect for His Word, and their utter willingness to strike a posture that celebrates who He is
[time=2532] and what He had done and what He meant to them.
[time=2537] Sometimes He longs to hear our shout.
[time=2540] Sometimes He likes it silent.
[time=2542] Other times He likes it even louder.
[time=2545] Sometimes He longs to see you kneel, bow, and weep.
[time=2551] When we celebrate Him, we'll also, the Scriptures say, lift up our hands.
[time=2555] Paul says to Timothy in his first letter to this struggling young pastor who's trying his best to give leadership and love to this family at Ephesus.
[time=2565] Paul says as he's giving some direction to Timothy in First Timothy 2-8.
[time=2570] First Timothy 2-8 says, "Therefore Timothy, I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands without wrath and dissension." Paul wanted a unified body.
[time=2582] He wanted a body that was deeply committed to harmony.
[time=2586] He wanted them praying.
[time=2587] He wanted them praying, lifting up holy hands.
[time=2591] Holy hands.
[time=2593] Hands lifted that say in prayer in an attitude of dependence.
[time=2598] God, we need your help.
[time=2600] God, my hands can't do this.
[time=2603] God, we're not smart enough.
[time=2605] God, we're not big of God.
[time=2606] We need you.
[time=2612] It says in Psalm 28, you can write that down, Psalm 28-2.
[time=2619] Psalm 28-2 says this.
[time=2621] It says, "Here the voice of my supplications when I cry to you for help, when I lift up my hands toward your holy sanctuary." You see that?
[time=2630] Here the voice of my supplications.
[time=2632] When I cry to you for help.
[time=2635] See, that's what that's about.
[time=2637] This is about I can't do this.
[time=2639] This is about your God and I'm not.
[time=2642] This is about you know what?
[time=2644] I have come to the end of me and here in this moment, I'm basking in the privilege of again surrendering myself to you.
[time=2652] This isn't Pentecostal.
[time=2654] This isn't charismatic.
[time=2655] This isn't denominational.
[time=2657] Some have made it that.
[time=2659] And some have abused that.
[time=2661] But this from a pure heart that comes before God in utter submission and respect is biblical.
[time=2669] And it is a posture that He longs to see.
[time=2678] Look at Psalm 100 if you will.
[time=2683] I want you to look at this one.
[time=2684] So go ahead and turn.
[time=2686] Psalm 100.
[time=2688] Many of you have memorized this over the years.
[time=2691] Some of you kids could probably say it for others in the room.
[time=2694] It's all new, which is great.
[time=2696] It says in Psalm 100.
[time=2698] Shout joyfully.
[time=2700] Kind of back to where we started.
[time=2702] It says shout joyfully to the Lord.
[time=2706] All the earth.
[time=2708] Serve the Lord with gladness.
[time=2711] Come before Him with joyful singing.
[time=2716] While you got your pins out, can I just give you a definition of joyful?
[time=2719] Write this down.
[time=2720] The excited passion.
[time=2722] Listen to this.
[time=2724] The excited passion.
[time=2725] He says to you in me, shout joyfully.
[time=2729] But what does joyfully mean?
[time=2731] That word there means this.
[time=2732] The excited passion brought on by the possession of something great or glorious.
[time=2740] It is the excited passion brought on by the possession.
[time=2744] You possessing and me possessing it says something great and something glorious.
[time=2750] So I just want to ask you, do you possess something today that you would consider great or glorious?
[time=2757] Yes or no?
[time=2759] It doesn't sound like it.
[time=2762] Yeah, and I mean that.
[time=2763] See, that's my point.
[time=2767] It's just family here, right?
[time=2768] I'm just talking to you.
[time=2770] We're just looking at the scriptures.
[time=2772] That didn't sound like it.
[time=2773] And I'm not asking you to yell louder now.
[time=2775] I just want you to -- we've got to think about that.
[time=2779] Maybe you're here this morning and you don't possess yet something great and glorious.
[time=2787] But if you do, if he saved you and you've realized that and you've surrendered your heart and
[time=2793] life to him and the spirit of God lives in you and you have the privilege of walking through life in personal relationship with the living God.
[time=2801] And if in doing so, your eternity is secure and your days have been given purpose and
[time=2807] learning.
[time=2808] And he says, if you've got something, if you've possessed something great and glorious, then shout joyfully.
[time=2817] Lift your voice.
[time=2818] Say something to me in utter joy and excitement.
[time=2826] And we've got to think about that.
[time=2828] If we possess it, he says, as we come to worship and celebrate him, we have the opportunity
[time=2835] to bless it.
[time=2837] And it's just about him.
[time=2839] That's what he longs for.
[time=2842] Not about you.
[time=2845] Some of you are more comfortable with this, you know, than that and I completely understand
[time=2851] it.
[time=2852] But as we look to the scriptures and see these biblical postures, then there's great freedom
[time=2858] without drawing attention to yourself, without becoming a spectacle, without distracting those
[time=2866] who would be celebrating alongside, we can with reverence, respect, with great joy and passion.
[time=2873] Offer our praise.
[time=2875] That's toward him.
[time=2877] Toward others, write this down.
[time=2879] Real love comforts.
[time=2882] It moves towards others in an effort to bring relief, support and affection.
[time=2887] Write those three things down.
[time=2889] Comfort, you kind of think you know what it means.
[time=2891] Just write those three things down to give you kind of a picture there.
[time=2894] Real love is expressive.
[time=2897] And in its expression, it comforts others.
[time=2900] It moves towards others in an effort to bring relief, support and affection to one in need.
[time=2907] And don't take that in need to be just crisis, all right?
[time=2912] Every single day of my life and your life, people wake up in our world, in your personal
[time=2919] world and mine, in your home, in my home, in your workplace, every single day, people wake up with the need to be comforted.
[time=2927] And it doesn't have to be a crisis and it doesn't have to be a big, bad, ugly deal.
[time=2932] They need it every single day.
[time=2934] Look at 2 Corinthians chapter 1.
[time=2936] Go back to the New Testament.
[time=2938] In this second letter, Acts, Romans 1 Corinthians 2 Corinthians, go to the first chapter.
[time=2945] Second Corinthians chapter 1, we're going to look at verse 3, 4 and 5.
[time=2951] Here's how I want you to kind of frame this up in your mind.
[time=2953] Here's a great way to kind of take this with you.
[time=2959] Here's how God says it should be done.
[time=2961] Blessed be the God and Father, Paul says.
[time=2963] Verse 3.
[time=2964] It should be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort who comforts us in all our affliction so that we will be able to comfort
[time=2977] those who are in any affliction with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted
[time=2984] by God for just as the sufferings of Christ are ours and abundance so also our comfort
[time=2991] is abundant through Christ.
[time=2994] You see what he's saying there?
[time=2995] What he's saying there is real love comforts and you are to be one and I am to be one who has the antenna if you will up looking everywhere you go, every situation you're in, be it with
[time=3007] family or friends, there are those who need to be relieved.
[time=3012] There are those who need to feel your support.
[time=3015] There are those who long for your affection and because he has given you comfort because
[time=3021] he has brought to your life the relief and the support and the affection that you longed
[time=3027] for he says just turn around and give it to somebody else.
[time=3034] Has he ever spoken hope and assurance into your life?
[time=3039] Yes or no?
[time=3042] Then speak those things into the life of another.
[time=3045] Has he ever with great sacrifice extended peace to your troubled soul in a time of need?
[time=3050] Yes or no?
[time=3052] Then sacrificially extend it to another real love comforts.
[time=3057] Has he ever brought one along at just the right time in your life to hold you, to put
[time=3063] their arm around you, to pray with you, easing your pain and confusion?
[time=3069] Yes or no?
[time=3070] Yeah, then open your eyes and put your arms around your spouse.
[time=3074] Put your arms around your kids.
[time=3076] Put your arms around a good friend.
[time=3083] Some say to me, you know, Kelly, I understand all that.
[time=3085] I'm just not a very affectionate person.
[time=3089] I'm just not much of a cuddler, you know.
[time=3094] I hear what you're saying and all.
[time=3096] It's not me.
[time=3097] I'm not very warm.
[time=3099] They say.
[time=3100] I mean, I hear what you're saying, you know, I'm just, I'm just, I'm a guy of few words.
[time=3107] What can I say?
[time=3109] You know, I just kind of let my actions, you know, I just, I don't speak a whole lot.
[time=3113] I hear what you're saying and all, you know, but it's just, I'm not that warm.
[time=3118] I'm not that cuddly.
[time=3120] I'm not one for words.
[time=3125] But all that would be fine and good, I say, if this was about you.
[time=3134] But this isn't about you, is it?
[time=3139] It's about your wife or your husband.
[time=3143] It's about your son or your daughter.
[time=3147] It's about a number of good friends in your life.
[time=3150] It's about people that God has placed near you who need your cuddle, who needs your kind word, who need your affection, who need your warmth.
[time=3162] And there may be really serious issues.
[time=3164] There may be things that have transpired, that have kind of led in some ways you to become this hard callous, kind of shut up guy or gal, but you know what?
[time=3173] The spirit of God can break through that.
[time=3175] The spirit of God can grow your heart again.
[time=3177] And the fact of the matter is the comfort which He brings to you, no matter who you are where you've been, He's called you to deliver to others.
[time=3186] So dads, moms, men, women, comfort.
[time=3195] Come alongside somebody really, really soon, hug them, talk to them, listen to them, take a walk with them, send them a note.
[time=3209] Thirdly, real love confronts sin.
[time=3211] Please write that down.
[time=3213] Real love, real love, God's love, lived out in your life and mine.
[time=3221] It confronts sin.
[time=3226] Look at Matthew 18, see, because you really, really love God and you really, really love the people in your life as Mitch was talking about last week when you're really doing your best with His help to follow the first and the second greatest command, loving God and
[time=3240] loving others, when they do something they shouldn't have done, when they say something they shouldn't have said, when they make decisions and harbor attitudes and you know it firsthand,
[time=3251] not second or third, no.
[time=3252] When you and I come across these things because we really love God and we really love them,
[time=3258] we say something and you say, well, you know what?
[time=3260] But it's not really any of mine, but you know what it is.
[time=3263] It is because we're in this together.
[time=3266] It is because this is the church, the body of Christ and it is your business to watch this lovingly with humility and with great grace and sensitivity, speak the truth in love.
[time=3280] Matthew 18, verse 15, it says, if your brother sins, go and show him his fault in private.
[time=3290] If he listens to you, you have won your brother, but if he does not listen to you, take one or two more with you so that by the mouth of two or three witnesses, every fact may be confirmed.
[time=3301] If he refuses to listen to them, the two or three who didn't come with a hammer, they
[time=3307] came with hearts wide open.
[time=3309] They got on their knees before him or her and they begged him to do what's right.
[time=3317] If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church and if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him beat to you as a Gentile and a tax collector, people who were in that
[time=3328] day in that setting on the outside.
[time=3333] Not on the outside because you're better than them.
[time=3336] Not on the outside because they were naughty.
[time=3340] No, on the outside because sometimes you've got to get to the outside for God to finally
[time=3348] get your attention, there's people here in this room today who could testify to that.
[time=3355] Luke 17, Matthew, Mark, Luke, Luke 17, be on your guard, it says, Luke 17, three.
[time=3369] You see it there?
[time=3370] Be on your guard if your brother sins rebuke him and if he repents, forgive him and if
[time=3376] he sends against you seven times a day and returns to you seven times saying, I repent,
[time=3383] forgive him.
[time=3387] Real love doesn't let it slide, people.
[time=3391] Real love doesn't let it go.
[time=3394] Here's a picture for you.
[time=3397] It, Craig, come here just for a second, real quick, watch this.
[time=3402] Just kind of came to me this week because I was thinking this through, I just want you to stand right here, face me, okay?
[time=3412] Real love confronts, real love stands in the way and any of you here in this room who have
[time=3419] ever dealt with or are dealing with somebody who currently is struggling, currently has
[time=3425] a hard heart, currently isn't listening and there you are begging, there you are doing
[time=3432] everything you can because you love God and love them and what they do is this, they
[time=3438] try and walk this way and see real love just says, you know, one time or maybe two, you
[time=3446] know, and literally, I'm serious, you know, literally it's just I'm begging you.
[time=3454] Please don't.
[time=3456] Let's walk back and I'll go with you.
[time=3459] Please don't and then see sometimes the hardness is really deep and so then they start to kind of go the other way, they go this way and then you just lovingly and really graciously, you just say, no, no, no, I'm going to get a couple of others now and we're just going to say, please don't.
[time=3475] Here's where it says that you can't do this and we love you and he loves you and see then
[time=3482] sometimes that ends up with, that ends up with, you know, this right here and that's
[time=3489] a good thing.
[time=3491] It says you've won over your brother and sometimes he goes and after begging and pleading and
[time=3501] praying and pursuing, sometimes that's where it ends up and God's not done with him there
[time=3510] sometimes that's where it goes and when they're there then we all just have to pray and we
[time=3516] all have to whenever we see him or her beg him to come back but real love, real love gets
[time=3526] on its knees and says, please, oh please don't do that, thanks.
[time=3536] Thanks God it comforts others and it confronts sin because you really, really love them and
[time=3543] you really, really love them.
[time=3566] and you really love them and you really love them and you love them and you love them.
