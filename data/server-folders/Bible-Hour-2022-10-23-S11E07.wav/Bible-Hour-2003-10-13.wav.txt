[time=537] (upbeat music)
[time=547] (audience applauds) - Good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=554] We're really glad you joined us.
[time=555] I think we probably take it for granted too many times that people are watching over television.
[time=560] And we really are delighted that you're joining us and that you can get a chance maybe before you're going to church or if you don't have a church, maybe this is what's happening in your life as far as church experience.
[time=571] And we'd invite you to come to Black Hawk and visit if that's the case.
[time=574] But thanks for joining us, we're really glad you're here.
[time=577] This morning, we are wrapping up a series on Real Love.
[time=581] It's been six weeks and this sixth message on Real Love is about obedience.
[time=587] If God calls us to obedience and he does, then it will force us into a position that will be really different from the people that are around us.
[time=598] It'll put us out on a limb, so to speak.
[time=601] And we have a video about that very thing.
[time=604] We have a drama that we have taped and it's really good.
[time=609] There's a guy out on a limb willing to be out on the end of the limb to be obedient to God.
[time=616] God saves us by grace, but he calls us to obedience and that really sets us apart.
[time=622] I hope you enjoy it.
[time=623] - So, you can see me.
[time=635] Well, this probably looks a little strange to you, doesn't it?
[time=638] Well, believe me, it's a little strange for me as well.
[time=642] Have any of you ever been in this position before?
[time=646] Come on, there has to be many of you that have taken this step before.
[time=652] Maybe you don't know what I'm talking about.
[time=656] Let me explain.
[time=657] Let me start by telling you a little bit about myself.
[time=661] My name is Mike Stravinsky.
[time=664] And I, well, I guess you could say that I'm a pretty altogether kind of guy.
[time=669] I'm the sales manager for a major pharmaceutical company, so I can't complain about my job.
[time=674] I worked my tail off to get my MBA.
[time=677] And well, that investment paid off quite nicely.
[time=681] I mean, check it, I got big home, country club membership, nice cars, nice vacations with the family.
[time=692] Are you getting the picture here?
[time=695] I've done pretty well for myself.
[time=697] So, what am I doing out here?
[time=700] About six months ago, I made a big decision.
[time=704] I surrender my life to Christ.
[time=710] Ask Jesus Christ to be my Lord and Savior.
[time=713] Now, most of you should understand that that is not the end of the deal, but only the beginning of the journey.
[time=721] I will not go into details of how I ended up surrender in my life.
[time=725] Let's just say that it was the result of a lot of truth, a lot of time, and a lot of caring by a friend.
[time=731] Well, with Christ in my life, I realize that old Mike here was no longer in control.
[time=741] Nah, I know a lot of you are thinking, Mike, you were never in control.
[time=747] You only thought you were.
[time=750] Well, you're right, I realize that.
[time=753] Now, asking Jesus to my heart was pretty easy for me to do, but giving up control, really surrendering?
[time=763] Hey, it's pretty scary going out there.
[time=766] A lot of things are gonna change in my life.
[time=770] A lot of things that I used to, well, rely on,
[time=776] those things, they're things I'm not going to rely on anymore.
[time=780] I mean, I can't rely on them anymore.
[time=784] That's a tough concept for me to grasp.
[time=788] Because, well, you all heard, didn't you?
[time=790] I've had a really good life.
[time=793] I've really done well.
[time=796] God's gonna want more of my time.
[time=801] When do I pencil you in?
[time=806] Do I need to pray for a certain amount of time every day?
[time=809] How much?
[time=810] You know how busy I am, Lord?
[time=813] When will I find time to fit you in?
[time=815] Oh, the budget section of my daily plan
[time=822] is gonna change, too, isn't it?
[time=824] You're gonna want a lot more of my money, aren't you, Lord?
[time=827] Well, I guess anything would have been improvement over what I have been given, one in it.
[time=836] But how much, Lord?
[time=838] How much?
[time=839] What am I gonna cut out so that I can start giving my treasures to you?
[time=843] Oh, man.
[time=845] I bet you're going with my country club membership.
[time=849] Or my new Lexus.
[time=851] Lord, can you give me some help here?
[time=856] Can you give me a sign that everything will be okay?
[time=861] All right, I'll close my eyes.
[time=866] And you do something, something that'll show me that you hear me.
[time=869] All right, I really want to surrender my life to you, but you just gotta let me know that I'll be okay.
[time=878] That my family will be okay.
[time=879] Oh, my family, what will happen to them?
[time=885] Will they still respect me if I have less money to buy them things or less money for vacations?
[time=894] I guess I couldn't make it up by, just by being around them more.
[time=899] That's probably a good thing, isn't it?
[time=901] Oh, man, I was just getting my golf handicap in the single digits.
[time=906] Lord, you're gonna change everything, aren't you?
[time=913] Or isn't there some sort of minor league camp
[time=919] that I can start off in?
[time=921] But do I have to jump in the full program right off the bat?
[time=923] Why do you have to be the Lord of everything?
[time=928] Can't I just surrender on Sunday mornings and we'll just check in once or twice throughout the week?
[time=935] I'm just not sure that I'll be able to.
[time=938] Lord, I'm just scared.
[time=951] No.
[time=953] Lord, you're right.
[time=955] Right. Everything will change.
[time=958] Including me.
[time=961] And who knows?
[time=964] Maybe my family will join me out here someday.
[time=969] We're gonna need a bigger limb.
[time=981] (audience applauds) I try to rush up here when you're plotting for the video, so I feel like you're plotting for me.
[time=990] That's what we're doing.
[time=991] You know, for those of you who haven't really placed
[time=999] your hope in the fact that Christ died for your sins,
[time=1005] and you haven't yet understood his love for you, and you haven't yielded to him, and you haven't experienced salvation, want to make sure one thing's really, really clear.
[time=1021] You're not on the limb yet, okay?
[time=1025] So when we talk about obedience today, it's not about you obeying so that you can somehow have a relationship with him.
[time=1035] That needs to be really clear.
[time=1039] We have relationship with him because he chose to reach down to us, and Christ died on the cross for our sins.
[time=1047] So for people who haven't really come to grips with that yet,
[time=1053] don't get confused today as we talk about real love being obedience.
[time=1058] It's not you obeying him so you can earn somehow his favor and get to go to heaven.
[time=1063] But for those of you that do know Christ, that have a personal relationship with the Father through the Son and the Holy Spirit's dwelling in you, you need to make sure you understand you're out there on the limb.
[time=1077] And I loved watching him inch his way out on the limb.
[time=1084] I told Kelly, sure wasn't Jack Loser out there on the, I'm glad they didn't pick him to act.
[time=1090] That would have made me way nervous.
[time=1092] (congregation laughing) Inching your way out, don't leave Jack.
[time=1098] Inching their way, and then you know what?
[time=1101] It's absolutely normal for you to feel attention.
[time=1106] There's some tension in your life.
[time=1109] When you get out on the limb and the further you go out on the limb, get this, the less strength there is in that limb and in you to handle the potential consequences.
[time=1128] The further out on the limb you get by being obedient to God, the more you express your love to him, the more intimate your relationship with him becomes because he's all you have to hang on to.
[time=1145] And so today what we're hopeful to teach is that
[time=1153] that's good, getting out there on that limb is a good thing, being obedient to him that causes you to be totally different from the rest of the world, totally in it, but totally different from it, is a good thing.
[time=1167] Are you out on a limb this morning?
[time=1174] I hope you are.
[time=1175] Let's just look at the first John chapter two, verse five, just for a verse to kick off here.
[time=1185] First John chapter two, it's back at the very end of your Bible, first, second, third John Jude revelation.
[time=1190] First John, two, five says, but if anyone obeys his word,
[time=1198] God's love is truly made complete in him.
[time=1205] This is how we know we are in him.
[time=1209] Whoever claims to live in him must walk as Jesus did.
[time=1216] You know how Jesus walked?
[time=1217] Jesus walked in obedience to the Father.
[time=1221] That's not saying that we're gonna be perfect and sinless somehow like he was.
[time=1229] We can't do that, but we can be utterly dependent on him.
[time=1234] And Jesus was dependent on the Father.
[time=1239] But if anyone obeys his word, God's love is truly made complete in him.
[time=1246] I looked up that word complete.
[time=1248] And what it really means, this out on a limb is a great illustration.
[time=1252] Being complete in him means I am out there,
[time=1258] utterly dependent with no means of my own to control the circumstances in my life.
[time=1265] It's an intimate relationship with him that is so utterly dependent that it's complete.
[time=1274] - Yes.
[time=1275] - Well, real love is obedient.
[time=1281] And we can see that as we look at how Jesus loved the Father.
[time=1288] Real love is expressed as Jesus loves the Father.
[time=1292] First of all, he humbled himself.
[time=1295] Let's look at Philippians chapter two.
[time=1302] I don't know if you think about Jesus being humble and obedient very often, but he was.
[time=1312] Jesus, a hundred percent man, was first of all obedient to come be with us as one of the created.
[time=1324] Philippians two says your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus.
[time=1331] Who being in very nature, God did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but made himself, okay?
[time=1341] Nothing.
[time=1342] Taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness and being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to death, even death on a cross.
[time=1356] Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus, every knee shed bow and every tongue confess, that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
[time=1374] In his humility, he comes here.
[time=1377] The Creator, Colossians one says, Jesus himself spoke the world into existence.
[time=1383] He created all things.
[time=1386] The Creator made himself human.
[time=1391] Made him like the created.
[time=1393] I mean, can you just think about that for a second?
[time=1397] What, he left the presence of the Father, all the angelic host, the perfection of the presence of the Father and came here as a baby, as a human being and the Bible teaches us that he was tempted in every way as a man, just the way we are.
[time=1421] That step, why'd he do it?
[time=1424] Because he chose to obey the Father.
[time=1426] The Father had a plan and the Son submitted to the Father.
[time=1431] He obeyed the Father, John 15, look at that with me, John 15, nine and 10.
[time=1435] This is the gospel of John, now not first John back there where we were.
[time=1440] John 15, nine and 10 says, "As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you." Now remain in my love.
[time=1447] If you obey my commands, call to obedience.
[time=1451] If you obey my commands, you will remain in my love.
[time=1454] Just as I have obeyed my Father's commands and remain in his love, Jesus says he obeyed the Father
[time=1465] and remained in the Father's love.
[time=1467] And he says, if you want to experience the love of the Father, remain in him, keep his commandments.
[time=1474] As I did, he says, he chose obedience.
[time=1481] You know what, when he was tempted?
[time=1483] I just was talking to the guys in power equipment last week.
[time=1487] Do you know how people probably tempted him?
[time=1490] We know about some temptation.
[time=1491] We know that Satan came and tempted him.
[time=1493] But the Bible says he was tempted in every way.
[time=1497] Can you imagine the people that approached him that would want to use him?
[time=1503] Tempted in every way, but obedient.
[time=1510] You want to remain in his love?
[time=1512] You want to be filled up with him?
[time=1514] Like it says in John 15, then you obey him.
[time=1518] Jesus, real love, was expressed as he glorified the Father.
[time=1523] In John chapter 17, his high priestly prayer time, John chapter 17 verses one through five.
[time=1530] Let's look at that together.
[time=1531] After Jesus said this, he looked toward heaven and prayed.
[time=1535] Father, the time has come.
[time=1537] Glorify your son, that your son may glorify you.
[time=1541] For you granted him authority, God the Father, granted him authority over all people that he might give eternal life to all those you have given him.
[time=1550] Now this is eternal life.
[time=1553] That they may know you, the only true God.
[time=1555] And Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.
[time=1558] I have brought you glory on earth by completing the work you gave me to do.
[time=1565] Now think about that one.
[time=1567] How would you like to have your tombstone
[time=1573] say he finished the work God gave him to do?
[time=1579] And now Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began.
[time=1589] I want that again, he says.
[time=1591] I want that again.
[time=1595] When I memorized John 17, 4, I was at a knavs conference and the president of the navigators said that was his life first.
[time=1605] And so he suggested that we consider that.
[time=1608] I learned it this way.
[time=1609] It says, I have glorified thee on the earth, having finished the work thou gave us to me to do.
[time=1617] It's been a while, it's King James, you know, 1609.
[time=1620] I have glorified thee on the earth, having finished the work thou gave us me to do.
[time=1627] Obedience, when you choose obedience and you crawl out on the limb, you are saying no to being of the world
[time=1640] and yes to bringing him glory.
[time=1644] Act of worship.
[time=1646] You wanna worship him, obey him.
[time=1651] I think maybe the greatest act of worship I ever have may be the times when I'm alone and I wanna go there and I say no, I'm going there.
[time=1663] It might be a television, it might be a book I'm reading.
[time=1670] Hardest time is when it's just a thought I have.
[time=1674] I'm in the car, I could think about anything.
[time=1679] And when we choose obedience, we bring him glory.
[time=1684] Jesus loved the Father by being obedient to him.
[time=1693] That's a good example.
[time=1697] I tried to think of illustrations.
[time=1700] And I really, like every time I came up with something trying to illustrate Jesus' obedience and love for the Father, I'm thinking, that's not good, next, that's not good.
[time=1713] You know why?
[time=1714] You can't have some human illustration about that, duh.
[time=1719] I mean, how am I ever gonna come up with some illustration about a man doing something that's going to illustrate that?
[time=1728] So I thought, okay, rather than illustrate it, let's pray and thank him for it.
[time=1735] That's what we'll do, let's pray.
[time=1739] Our Father in heaven, there is no human experience to illustrate what Jesus chose to do in obedience to you.
[time=1748] And I pray that you will accept our thanks.
[time=1756] Lord Jesus, for you to come here in the form of a man
[time=1766] and then to humble yourself even to death on a cross, humiliating death because you love the Father.
[time=1778] That's what it says.
[time=1779] It says, "Not my will, but thine be done." Jesus, your will was to not go down that road, but you chose to obey the Father.
[time=1789] What an example for us.
[time=1792] I love you.
[time=1796] We are so thankful and so we pause now.
[time=1800] We pause now to give you the glory you deserve for your obedience.
[time=1807] [AMEN] Well, our obedience through real love
[time=1819] is expressed by Jesus to the Father and then by our love for God.
[time=1828] We love God as an expression of our love for him.
[time=1833] We obey him and we go out on the limb
[time=1839] and I wanna tell you something.
[time=1840] It's tense out there.
[time=1843] Do you notice how the thing gets smaller the further you go?
[time=1849] It's tense out there.
[time=1852] The more I reject the natural, normal responses that the world tells me to do and the more I know this and do things his way, the more tense it becomes with the world.
[time=1868] Now it doesn't become more tense with him.
[time=1870] There's an intimacy that I get to have that's incredible but it does become tense with everybody that says, well, you're nuts.
[time=1877] You're so spiritually minded, you're no earthly good.
[time=1880] You heard that when I was a kid, I heard that about people all the time.
[time=1882] Well, now I've grown to appreciate those women who prayed that way that were so spiritually minded that they were no earthly good.
[time=1890] A lot of earthly things were accomplished in the spiritual realm because of those people who are that way.
[time=1897] You know, it is extreme.
[time=1900] Josh, we have a 20 year old, he's Joshua, he got the intern here at the church, I'm so thankful.
[time=1906] You wouldn't believe what our church has done to impact the growth of our son.
[time=1912] In so many ways, small group, just guys that love him confront him, opportunities to stand up here and play guitar and lead and to be surrounded by the people that put the programming together, to have Eric and Ed and Corbin and all those people influencing him all summer long.
[time=1932] Well, he's one of those people.
[time=1934] Josh has a hard time kind of distinguishing, when the limb might be too small or something.
[time=1939] He's just extreme.
[time=1942] A few weeks ago, he called and he said, "You know, Dad, I'm in this extreme running class." And he said, "I'm gonna run a race pretty soon." He said, "It's 50 miles." You know, he's the kind that just can't accept a marathon being a marathon.
[time=1959] You have to do the ultra, whatever, deal.
[time=1962] And my first thought was that is the stupidest thing I have ever heard in my life.
[time=1967] And you know, he's 20, so I'm not gonna say you can't do it, but I did say, is that foolish?
[time=1974] I mean, can you get hurt?
[time=1975] What do you think?
[time=1976] 50 miles, how do you do that?
[time=1977] He said, "Oh, you walk some." He said, "You always walk up the mountain." Like you could run up the mountain.
[time=1983] He said, "But it's 50 miles." Well, yesterday was the day.
[time=1988] So I called him from the concert last night.
[time=1990] I left a couple messages.
[time=1992] I left Mercy Me on his message and then I left Michael W. Smith on his answering machine.
[time=1997] But I did finally talk to him last night and he finished it.
[time=2000] It took nine hours and 52 minutes.
[time=2003] You know what?
[time=2004] On the one hand, I'm saying, "Stupid." On the other hand, I'm going, now if he can translate that kind of extreme passion into being obedient, into doing things God's way, I like it.
[time=2019] One of the things I said, "How are you?" He said, "I'm really tired." And he said, "And I have a lot of blisters on my feet." He said, "As a dad, I wanted to go to Virginia and take care of his blisters and really make sure that he's okay." That kind of extreme attitude, little dangerous.
[time=2041] I mean, you can go too far with that stuff.
[time=2044] I really think so.
[time=2046] But that kind of attitude toward glorifying the Lord God Almighty is not dangerous.
[time=2053] But it'll feel like it sometimes.
[time=2056] That's what I want to make.
[time=2057] That's the point I want to make there.
[time=2058] As you love God, as you obey his commandments, you'll get out there on the limb and it'll feel really dangerous.
[time=2069] And he says, "You do that.
[time=2075] You're choosing not to love the world." Look at 1 John, chapter two, verses 15 through 17.
[time=2087] Do not love the world or anything in the world.
[time=2089] If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
[time=2093] Now, I want to tell you something.
[time=2095] I have people read 1 John a lot and I'd encourage you to read 1 John and test your faith with 1 John.
[time=2102] Don't think about other people when you're reading that book.
[time=2105] Don't think, "Oh, he should be.
[time=2108] She should be there, not I." Think about you.
[time=2112] For everything in the world, the cravings of sinful man, the lust of his eyes and the boasting of what he has and does, comes not from the Father, but from the world.
[time=2123] The world and its desires pass away, but the man who does the will of God lives forever.
[time=2128] Doing the will of God will put the world behind you as far as satisfying your own flesh and it will put you out there on the limb and those desires, the world, it's all going to die anyhow.
[time=2143] Invest yourself in what's going to live forever.
[time=2148] There's a teacher that I know, Christian school teacher.
[time=2155] He's one of those guys that over the course of time, his education and then his learnings that have taken place over the years kind of put him in a position where he's very attractive to the world because of what he can offer them.
[time=2174] He knows a lot about an arena that really helps people make a lot of money.
[time=2179] And so not long ago, not many years at all, a person told me that there are some jobs that they knew about that this Christian schoolteacher could take and make a lot of money.
[time=2194] I said, "What are you talking about?" He said, "Well, it's starting six figures." And I said, "Wow." So I felt compelled to tell this teacher that so I did tell him.
[time=2206] And I said, "I just want you to know this job opportunity that you could have could mean more than $100,000 a year." Now let me tell you something, this person's been living within his means as a Christian schoolteacher for a long time.
[time=2221] I lived a whole lot better, live a whole lot better than he has as far as the world standards are concerned.
[time=2229] And so this would have meant a huge deal.
[time=2232] And I said, "What do you think?" And he said, "Oh, we're not gonna." I said, "Maybe you need to pray about that." He said, "We don't need to pray about that." He said, "When we chose to do this, we chose not to do that." Now, you guys, I'm not saying that you need to quit what you're doing that earns you money.
[time=2252] I'm just saying the money should be a byproduct of what you're doing as you serve the Lord.
[time=2256] If you happen to be in an arena in life where money comes at you, I feel sorry for you.
[time=2263] It's really hard there.
[time=2265] No one would know what to do with it is really hard.
[time=2268] But for some of us, for me, it's a lot easier to be in ministry, so I don't have to really go through that.
[time=2275] But you know what?
[time=2278] Some of you are out there.
[time=2280] And money's coming at you as a byproduct.
[time=2282] For this person, they chose this lifestyle in order to do these things, and God really called him to do that.
[time=2289] And if he's called you into an arena where you make a whole bunch of cash, make sure you're obedient with your cash.
[time=2295] But it's tense out there, and that limb is small out there.
[time=2302] And if you aren't intimately in connection with him, you won't do it the right way.
[time=2311] Real love chooses not to love the world.
[time=2315] Enjoy the things that he provides for you.
[time=2320] First Timothy 6 says, be generous and willing to share the things that he provides for you.
[time=2324] But don't pursue those things.
[time=2327] Don't have that be the heartbeat each day.
[time=2329] We love God.
[time=2333] That's an expression of our love for him as we obey him.
[time=2337] His commandments, John 14, 15, 23, and 24, and choosing not to love the world.
[time=2344] And that, you guys, I'm not gonna list all those things.
[time=2349] They're different for you out there.
[time=2351] Each of you have something different.
[time=2353] The world offers you to view something different.
[time=2355] It doesn't offer us all the same thing, but you know what it is for you.
[time=2360] And you make a choice not to go there.
[time=2365] Thirdly, our real love expressed in our obedience as we love each other, as we love each other.
[time=2374] John 14, verses 19 through 21, talk about us
[time=2381] as we respond to our love for the Father.
[time=2383] John 14, before long the world will not see me anymore, Jesus said, but you will see me because I live.
[time=2391] You also will live.
[time=2393] On that day, you will realize that I am in my Father and you are in me and I am in you.
[time=2402] Whoever has my commands and obeys them, he is the one who loves me.
[time=2409] He who loves me will be loved by my Father and I too will love him and show myself to him.
[time=2415] As a response to our love for the Father, we love each other.
[time=2424] In John 13, 34 and 35, we love each other so that others will know that we are his disciples.
[time=2435] A new command I give you, he says, love one another.
[time=2438] As I have loved you so, you must love one another.
[time=2442] By this, all men will know that you are my disciples if you love one another.
[time=2447] God uses us as we love each other as an expression to other people of his love and he draws them into his kingdom as they observe us loving each other.
[time=2463] He said, they will know we are his disciples as we love each other.
[time=2470] Thirdly, he says, we love each other
[time=2478] because love fulfills the law.
[time=2480] Matthew 5, 17 says, do not think that I've come to abolish the law or the prophets.
[time=2486] I've not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.
[time=2489] Jesus, love incarnate, came to fulfill the law.
[time=2494] Our obedience is not an effort in order to please him
[time=2501] that we might earn our salvation.
[time=2504] Our obedience is an expression of our love to bring glory to it.
[time=2510] Because the law is fulfilled.
[time=2512] Number four, we love each other deeply.
[time=2519] It says in 1 Peter 1, 22 and 23, look at that.
[time=2522] Now that you have purified yourselves by obeying the truth, you ever think about that, you're purifying yourself as you obey the truth so that you may have sincere love for your brothers, it'll be real.
[time=2534] Love one another deeply from the heart.
[time=2539] Last night, I wanted to go love Josh deeply.
[time=2543] I really would like to help him salve his blisters.
[time=2550] And you know what?
[time=2556] That comes pretty easily for your own children.
[time=2559] If you guys had called me last night and said I have some blisters, could you come over?
[time=2565] (audience laughs) (audience laughs) I don't know that I would have, but you know what?
[time=2575] I probably should.
[time=2576] I probably should because I should have such
[time=2582] a deep love for you that when you call, I don't need to know why.
[time=2589] Let me ask you this.
[time=2592] If somebody that you love calls and says I need you, can you come right now?
[time=2596] And if you said what's wrong?
[time=2597] They said I can't tell you, but can you come right now?
[time=2599] Would you go?
[time=2601] Of course you would.
[time=2602] I'd go like that for you.
[time=2605] Love deeply.
[time=2609] We express our love to him as we love each other.
[time=2616] And the whole world sees us loving each other and they're drawn to him because of our love one for another.
[time=2624] There might be some church buildings full of people that aren't loving each other.
[time=2629] Do you ever heard of any?
[time=2633] I have.
[time=2635] I don't think that the whole town sits there and says, wow, let's go visit there.
[time=2641] I really like the way they can't agree on anything.
[time=2645] I really like the way they criticize each other on a regular basis.
[time=2648] I love the way they talk about their pastor at the restaurant and how much they don't like this or that.
[time=2654] No, he says they'll know we're his disciples.
[time=2659] Not that we're a member of this church or that church or whatever place.
[time=2662] We'll know that his, they'll know that we're his disciples as they observe us loving each other.
[time=2668] And then fifthly, we love each other because he tells us to.
[time=2672] That passage and second John, verses four through six.
[time=2678] One chapter in second John says it has given me great joy to find some of your children walking in the truth just as the Father commanded us.
[time=2689] And now dear lady, I'm not writing you a new command,
[time=2696] but one we have had from the beginning.
[time=2698] I ask that we love one another.
[time=2701] And this is love that we walk in obedience to his commands.
[time=2707] As you have heard from the beginning, his command is that you walk in love.
[time=2713] We love each other as an expression of his love for us.
[time=2718] And he tells us to.
[time=2723] He commands it.
[time=2726] You know, there were certain times when my dad said,
[time=2732] I'd like for you to do this or that.
[time=2736] And we'd do it even if he just said I'd like for you too.
[time=2739] But we kind of do it when we want to do how we want to do.
[time=2744] But there were sometimes when my dad said, I want you to have the garage clean when I get home from work.
[time=2751] And when he said, when he gave me a deadline, I did it.
[time=2760] 'Cause maybe I didn't do it once and then I learned that I did it.
[time=2765] When God says I command this, it's not up for debate.
[time=2770] It's not for us as believers to say, well, I wonder what that one means.
[time=2776] I should be or can we or do we have to?
[time=2778] When he says, I command that you do that.
[time=2782] Do you realize that's stronger than any order that any commander in chief, general, admiral, ever gave anybody?
[time=2794] He commands that we love each other.
[time=2797] What's the greatest commandment?
[time=2801] The greatest commandment Jesus said to the Pharisees when they ask him was, love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind, soul, and strength.
[time=2809] And the second commandment is like it.
[time=2812] Love your neighbor as yourself.
[time=2815] It's a commandment, folks.
[time=2817] In order for me to love you the way I'm supposed to, I believe it sometimes puts me in a very precarious position out on the end of a limb with the whole world back there saying that's a stupid thing to do.
[time=2833] And my natural inclination, I don't have to think about it
[time=2839] long as to just, I just wanna get back where it feels safe.
[time=2849] There were some good illustrations about men that have laid down their lives for their brother.
[time=2857] Jesus said, that's ultimate love.
[time=2860] That you would lay down your life for your brother.
[time=2863] And I thought, man, Dawson Trotman did that.
[time=2869] Remember that's how he died.
[time=2870] Head of the knabs, he jumped out of a boat.
[time=2872] He was trying to help people that were drowning and he actually drowned.
[time=2877] And a friend of mine gave me that illustration, I really like it.
[time=2881] And I read a lot about it on the internet and I found out all kinds of details.
[time=2884] But then I realized, what I've been saying to people for years is this, often you're willing to die for the people you love.
[time=2892] I think the best illustration of the people that have laid down their life for their brothers are the people that live for their brothers.
[time=2904] The husband that lives for his wife, lifting her up, sacrificing himself for her as Christ did the church, Ephesians 5.
[time=2915] That's love, that's laying down your life.
[time=2920] The wife that submits to a husband who isn't doing that.
[time=2924] That's incredible love, that's laying down your life.
[time=2927] I wouldn't do it, they don't deserve it, but he does.
[time=2935] My dad and mom, they laid down their lives for their children, no doubt about it.
[time=2943] They gave up all kinds of things they could have had.
[time=2946] I had new basketball shoes, they had no new shoes.
[time=2952] I had new school clothes, they had no new clothes.
[time=2956] I remember once pouting about the shoes I didn't get,
[time=2962] being frustrated, I think I was about 12.
[time=2965] I wanted these loafers with lightning on the side.
[time=2967] Dad took me back in the bedroom and he said, "Now, I just want you to understand." He said, "I'm going to whip you here." And he did, but he really wanted me to understand before I got the whipping what it was really about.
[time=2985] He said, "How long has it been since your mom got a new piece of clothing?" He said, "You're old enough to get this." I said, "Well, I don't know." He said, "Well, either her last birthday or the last Christmas 'cause that's when she gets something new from me." I said, "Well, yeah." He said, "Now, how often do you get new things?" And he said, "Don't you ever pout when we tell you
[time=3015] that you can't have something." You know why?
[time=3019] That rang true to me because my mom didn't get new things.
[time=3022] He didn't, they gave up stuff for us all the time.
[time=3026] Now, you know what?
[time=3027] For a lot of people, that's natural for your children.
[time=3029] What God's asking us to do is to love each other that way.
[time=3032] He wants us to lay our lives down for each other.
[time=3038] When you do, it brings glory to God
[time=3044] and we're a light in the darkness.
[time=3048] (Silence) If I have blisters, will you please come savv them for me?
[time=3058] I wanna do that for you.
[time=3061] We need to do that for each other.
[time=3063] Real love is obedient.
[time=3067] Our praise team's gonna come up
[time=3074] and they're gonna lead us in a song about trusting in him.
[time=3079] Trusting in him.
[time=3083] You need to place all of your trust in him.
[time=3088] When you're on the limb, out there far enough, that's the only place you can go.
[time=3102] [MUSIC - 109 seconds]
[time=3221] (piano music) - Well, what a great song and what a great truth.
[time=3236] And what a great six weeks it's been.
[time=3238] We hope that you've been encouraged.
[time=3243] We hope that maybe you have learned something new.
[time=3246] And as we've done our very best with his help to kind of unfold for you, a clear biblical look at real love, we look forward to what that's gonna be like for you and for me as we continue to try our best to live these things out.
[time=3262] If you want to kind of look back over these six weeks, make sure you place an order for a six set tape or CD series, you can get that done out in the four year and we're so thankful that you were here today.
[time=3275] We wanna invite you back next week as we begin a new series, a study, a verse by verse study of the book of first Thessalonians.
[time=3284] We are so looking forward to just week after week and the next several months just unpacking the truth from that great book.
[time=3291] So be with us next week and we'll jump into a new study.
[time=3295] Hey, we have a great opportunity before you go.
[time=3297] We wanna just introduce somebody to you, actually a couple.
[time=3301] We always enjoy it and we are always so grateful when God brings new members to our team.
[time=3307] And I wanna invite Ken and Julie Westra and any of the crew they've got, they've got a couple of them with him today.
[time=3313] You may have already met Ken and Julie, if not, Ken has joined our staff recently in a full time capacity in our student ministry arena.
[time=3323] Rick Vance has done a wonderful job giving leadership there in the recent years.
[time=3329] He needed some help and God brought just the right guy.
[time=3333] Ken comes to us from Kalamazoo.
[time=3335] He has been involved in student ministries for over 10 years and he and his wife, Julie, have a deep passion for kids and for making an investment in their lives and for the ministry that God has in the lives of students.
[time=3350] They've got four kids themselves.
[time=3352] They've got Caleb, Paige, Maddie, and Emma, right?
[time=3357] Yeah, and two of them are up here with them and you even got some family here today, right?
[time=3362] Kenny, would you introduce them and just have them stand?
[time=3365] Yeah, if you guys could stand over here, my family's over here.
[time=3368] They love that.
[time=3370] They really are welcome.
[time=3371] Thank you.
[time=3372] And it's an honor to be a part of this family.
[time=3384] We've already seen just the love from you, the congregational members to help us unpack and the staff and in term point ministries and the staff here at church.
[time=3396] And we're honored to be able to come and to learn and grow and also to serve.
[time=3401] And I hope too that I can have your feet and grow and help with you guys.
[time=3408] So thanks.
[time=3409] It's an honor to and appreciate you allowing us the opportunity to be with your students and your family here.
[time=3415] Thanks.
[time=3416] We're going to ask any staff, any of our pastoral staff and any elders that are here, would you come on up?
[time=3423] We want to pray for Ken and for Julie.
[time=3425] We are so grateful that they're here and we're so thankful for the ministry that we believe God's got in store for them as they come alongside your kids and mine.
[time=3436] I am looking forward to seeing what God will do.
[time=3440] And we are so thankful for their family, all of you guys over there that made the trip down.
[time=3446] Thanks for being here.
[time=3447] Thanks for letting us be a part of your family.
[time=3451] And we promise to take good care of these guys.
[time=3453] We all up here, come on guys, let's just put our hands on these guys.
[time=3456] And would you, the family of Blackuck, would you stand and would you just join us in a word of prayer here?
[time=3462] Father, we come before you this morning so thankful for the Westeros.
[time=3467] We are so thankful for the students, the middle school kids and the high school students.
[time=3473] God, you've given us a lot of them.
[time=3476] And we realize every one of us in this room that stands here today, we realize God that the world they live in, the things that they face, the choices that they are confronted with daily.
[time=3487] God, we realize it is a confusing world.
[time=3491] There's a lot more out there for them to face and have to wrestle with God than there was for us.
[time=3498] And so as they make those decisions, God, we are so grateful that you bring along people like Ken and Julie, we're so thankful again for Rick and the student ministry staff for Joe and for Jill and for Julie and the many other volunteers who help make turn point what it is.
[time=3516] And God, as Ken and Julie come to us, we pray that your hand would stay on their own family.
[time=3521] God, that you would give them strength in a new place.
[time=3524] God, that you would give them wisdom and insight as they come alongside students.
[time=3528] God, we thank you for Ken and his gifts and his heart.
[time=3531] And we look forward to partnering with him in the days to come.
[time=3535] Thank you so very much, God, for the way you work, for the way you add to this family and to our team.
[time=3541] And we commit again, God, to faithfully and lovingly serve you as best we can with your help.
[time=3547] And all the people were thankful and said amen.
[time=3561] [AMEN]
[time=3591] [SILENCE], amen.
