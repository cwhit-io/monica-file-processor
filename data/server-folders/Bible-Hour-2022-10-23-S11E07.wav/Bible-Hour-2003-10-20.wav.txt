[time=30] (upbeat music)
[time=60] (upbeat music) - Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Blackhawk Ministries.
[time=71] And it's great to have you with us again.
[time=74] I am not going to play for you this morning.
[time=78] I will leave that to others.
[time=80] But I do, I do just seeing this this morning when I walked in here.
[time=84] It did remind me of something that's very, very close to my heart and something that is very, very precious and very special to the family that God continues to grow here at Blackhawk.
[time=96] And that is this amazing privilege that we get.
[time=101] Not only in the 70 minutes on a Sunday morning or a Wednesday night at Common Ground, but on through the week as well.
[time=107] But especially here in this setting, this privilege that we get to worship our God in song and in words of praise and thanksgiving.
[time=117] And we've been learning more and more about that here.
[time=120] And God's desire for you and I to be a people who would express from deep in our hearts our love and our gratitude and our thanks to him.
[time=131] And you see, when the people of God come together and the spirit of God is present and the word of God is proclaimed or sung, God's word says amazing things happen.
[time=143] Let me just remind you, can I just do that?
[time=145] Let me remind you what it says in 1 Corinthians 14.
[time=149] It says this, listen, it says, if therefore the whole church should assemble together and all speak in tongues and ungifted men or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are mad?
[time=163] But if all prophesy, if the body gathered is given wholeheartedly to the proclamation and the singing of truth, watch what happens.
[time=175] But if all prophesy and an unbeliever or an ungifted man enters, he is convicted by all.
[time=183] He is called to account by all.
[time=185] The secrets of his heart are disclosed and so he will fall on his face and worship God declaring that God is certainly among you.
[time=196] See, that's what happens when people come in through these doors and they join us here in this room and the people of God come together to passionately and genuinely offer praise to him.
[time=210] People come still on that search.
[time=212] Folks walk through these doors, still seeking.
[time=215] Currently outside of relationship with God and yet they see the family of God coming together in passionate prophecy, the proclamation of truth and it stirs their hearts and it stirs ours as well.
[time=230] And we just long, we absolutely as a family and as a team, we long for you to experience that.
[time=239] Many of you do each week on the broadcast and we're so thankful for the job our folks do in bringing that broadcast to you.
[time=245] There's nothing like being here in person and we would love for you to come and just taste and see what it's like to be with the people who are passionate about their worship and their praise and their thanks to God.
[time=259] I'm so grateful for Corbin Miller.
[time=262] Corbin's our worship pastor and he has in the last year and a half or so brought a spirit of worship, brought an intensity and a commitment to excellence and a love for God and a presence to our team and our family here that we are so grateful for.
[time=278] He just turned 23 yesterday and no, he's not my son.
[time=282] Some people mistake him from my son.
[time=284] I'm not quite sure if that means he looks older.
[time=286] I look older, I look young, but anyway, we'll just know how thankful we are for him.
[time=291] And as he leads us in worship week after week, it just reminds me of how very important it is that we would be a people committed to giving our best and our most to him.
[time=302] So come, come soon and do that with us.
[time=305] We'll look forward to having you here.
[time=307] [MUSIC - 81 seconds]
[time=404] Let's sing this together.
[time=405] [MUSIC - 447 seconds]
[time=859] [AMEN] Let's continue to worship in the spirit of humility as we stand before our God and King.
[time=874] [MUSIC - 194 seconds]
[time=1080] Let's pray together. Father, we stand here this morning in awe of who you are.
[time=1089] We stand out of respect and we stand out of hearts that want to acknowledge you as the only God, the only King.
[time=1100] Lord, humble us. We don't ever want to come with you with many words, with many words about the plans that we have.
[time=1111] But we didn't want to surrender yet again and acknowledge that your ways are higher than ours and your thoughts are higher than ours.
[time=1119] And you are a high God. We love you and we want to give you all of us this morning in worship with everything that we say and do.
[time=1129] Be honored and glorifying. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[time=1134] To the Church of the Thessalonians and God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1139] Grace and peace to you. We always thank God for all of you.
[time=1144] Mentioning you in our prayers.
[time=1146] We continually remember before our God and Father your work produced in faith.
[time=1151] Your labor prompted by love.
[time=1154] And your endurance, inspired by hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1158] For we know, brothers loved by God, that He has chosen you.
[time=1163] Because our gospel came to you not simply with words.
[time=1167] But also with power.
[time=1169] With the Holy Spirit and deep conviction.
[time=1173] You know how we lived among you for your sake.
[time=1176] You became imitators of us and of the Lord.
[time=1179] In spite of severe suffering, you welcomed the message given with joy by the Holy Spirit.
[time=1185] And also, you became a model to all believers in Macedonia and IKEA.
[time=1190] The Lord's message rang out for you not only in Macedonia and IKEA.
[time=1195] Your faith in God has become known everywhere.
[time=1199] Therefore, we do not need to say anything about it.
[time=1203] For they themselves report what kind of reception you gave us.
[time=1207] They tell how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and to God.
[time=1213] And to wake for His Son from heaven who He raised from the dead.
[time=1218] Jesus who rescued us from the coming wrath.
[time=1224] Question for you.
[time=1226] Why do we come in this room and open up this book?
[time=1237] What is it about this book, these sacred truths that leads us week after week?
[time=1245] Many of us here in the room day after day to open up its pages and with great anticipation and curiosity and hope.
[time=1254] See what is there for us.
[time=1256] See what it is that God, what is it about God's Word?
[time=1261] That leads us week after week to come in through these doors and sit in this room and myself or Mitch or Steve open it up and do our best to teach it and explain it and proclaim it.
[time=1272] What's the deal with the Scriptures?
[time=1278] It's good periodically just to ask ourselves and to remind ourselves why it is that we value so deeply the truth of that book.
[time=1290] You know what it says in Hebrews 4, you can see this on the screen or you could turn there if you wanted to.
[time=1295] It says in Hebrews 4, 12, it says for the Word of God, here's why.
[time=1300] Because it says the Word of God is living and active and sharper than any two edged sword.
[time=1309] And it, the Word of God, when you take it in, when it's taught, when it's preached, when it's proclaimed, God's Word says about itself that it pierces as far as the division of soul and spirit.
[time=1322] You see the Word of God, it's not just a flesh wound in its piercing.
[time=1328] It doesn't just get barely, you know, like under the skin, no God's Word says about God's Word that it pierces as far as deep as the division of soul and spirit of both joints and marrow.
[time=1340] And it is able to judge the Scriptures themselves, just the Word of God, in and of itself, able to judge, expose, bring to light.
[time=1353] All of that which resides in your thoughts and your intentions and mind.
[time=1363] And able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
[time=1370] It's a powerful, powerful thing, the Scriptures.
[time=1374] That's what it does.
[time=1376] Look at, look at what it brings.
[time=1379] Think about that for just a moment. That's what it does.
[time=1382] And when you and I are willing to interact with it, when we do our best to explain it, when we take it in, look what it brings, go to Psalm, go to Psalm 19.
[time=1391] Go back there middle of your Bible about, you'll find the book of Psalms, go to Psalms 19.
[time=1399] Look at what the Word of God, look what it brings to your life and to mine.
[time=1404] And this would just be a sampling of what it brings. The law of the Lord, it says there in Psalm 19.
[time=1410] The law of the Lord is perfect, restoring the soul.
[time=1415] The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.
[time=1421] The precepts, again, all of these phrases here in 7 through 11 or 12, all these phrases having to do with the Scriptures.
[time=1430] The law of the Lord, the testimony of the Lord, the precepts of the Lord in verse 8.
[time=1436] The precepts of the Lord are right.
[time=1440] You ever need what's right?
[time=1445] You ever get lost along the way, you ever get confused about where you should go, you ever wonder, I mean like what you should really.
[time=1452] The precepts, these sacred truths, God says, are right.
[time=1459] Rejoicing the heart, the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.
[time=1464] The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever. The judgments of the Lord are true.
[time=1471] They are righteous altogether. They are more desirable, these sacred words, they are more desirable than gold.
[time=1478] Yes, then much fine gold, sweeter also than honey and the drippings of the honeycomb.
[time=1483] Watch this, moreover by them your servant is warned.
[time=1488] You and I get yellow flagged.
[time=1491] Time and time and time again by these precepts, these truths, these testimonies, this Word of God.
[time=1500] In keeping them, last part of 11, there is great reward.
[time=1505] And in ignoring them, there is great loss.
[time=1512] So you know what?
[time=1516] So we do our best with His help to every week as we come in through those doors and sit in these seats.
[time=1523] We do our very best to preach it, to explain it, to do our best with His help, to understand it, to communicate it, to proclaim it.
[time=1533] Paul told Timothy, in 2 Timothy 2, excuse me, 2 Timothy 4, you'll see it on the screen.
[time=1540] 2 Timothy 4, 1 to 3, Paul understood how important it was.
[time=1543] Paul knew what those people and Ephesus needed desperately.
[time=1546] Paul knew what the culture of that day was calling those people toward, and it wasn't the truth.
[time=1552] And so he said to this young struggling pastor, he said, "I solemnly charge you, Timothy, in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus,
[time=1561] who is to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom." Preach the Word.
[time=1570] This right here, he said, "Timothy, whatever you do, make sure you do this." Preach this.
[time=1577] Preach the Word.
[time=1578] Be ready, Timothy, in season and out of season.
[time=1581] That doesn't refer to fall and summer.
[time=1584] That refers to the fact that there are times when you walk in through these doors, sit in these seats, and the morning I've had or the week I've had or the battles I'm facing, I don't feel like preaching it.
[time=1599] There's times when in the life that you lead, in the situations that you encounter.
[time=1604] I mean, there are times when you don't feel like, where it doesn't feel as conducive.
[time=1608] I mean, there are times when preaching it, saying it, explaining it, communicating it, are difficult.
[time=1615] And he says, "In season and out, Timothy, realize you've got to preach this.
[time=1621] Reprove, rebuke, exhort with great patience and instruction.
[time=1626] Why? For the time will come.
[time=1629] See if you think it has.
[time=1633] For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but wanting to have their ears tickled.
[time=1640] Wanting to hear what they want to hear.
[time=1643] Wanting to hear things that will make them feel good about their sin.
[time=1651] They'll want their ears tickled," he says.
[time=1653] They will accumulate for themselves teachers.
[time=1656] They'll find people who will stand in front of folks and say what they want them to say.
[time=1662] And he says, "No, no, no, don't do that." In accordance to their own desires, he says, "Preach it.
[time=1668] Explain it. Proclaim it.
[time=1671] Why?" Because it does all of that.
[time=1677] Because it's alive and active.
[time=1679] It's sharp.
[time=1680] It pierces.
[time=1681] It exposes and brings to light your thoughts and intentions.
[time=1684] It rejoices the heart.
[time=1685] It restores the soul.
[time=1686] It lets you and I know what's right.
[time=1688] And you know what in the end it does again and again and again.
[time=1691] It changes us.
[time=1694] You realize that, right?
[time=1696] The Word of God, not me, not any other individual, not any other program.
[time=1701] The Word of God has the power to change you, to transform your life.
[time=1710] It's what happened to me.
[time=1713] Most of you know that.
[time=1715] Some of you don't.
[time=1717] It's what happened to me at the age of 20.
[time=1722] For the first time in my entire life, having basically grown up in the church, having set
[time=1730] in pews, just like the pew you set in, at the age of 20.
[time=1734] I finally heard the Word of God taught.
[time=1738] I finally heard the Word of God proclaimed.
[time=1740] I finally heard the Scriptures lift it up.
[time=1745] And what a difference it made.
[time=1749] You see, three years prior to that, at the age of seventeen, my entire world, the world
[time=1756] that I knew collapsed.
[time=1759] I grew up in the home of a pastor, an only child.
[time=1764] Wade, twelve pounds, ten ounces at birth, so that explains the only child thing.
[time=1775] The twelve thin almost led me to grow up the son of a single father.
[time=1780] But it was just me and my mom and dad, and my dad, my dad was a pastor.
[time=1787] And that's all I knew.
[time=1789] My whole life.
[time=1792] Where churches, many of them, just like this, several even bigger and larger, more people.
[time=1798] And my dad was the most amazing, most charismatic, most gifted, most endearing, most amazing
[time=1805] leader I had ever seen in my life.
[time=1808] What he did to a room full of people would have amazed you.
[time=1813] What he would say, the words that would come out of his mouth, I'm telling you, I spent my entire life in awe of this man.
[time=1821] And as I got to be ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, I'll tell you what, everything I did, every
[time=1828] place I went, there was the thought in my mind, I would do nothing to bring him any shame.
[time=1836] I would do nothing to in any way taint what was going on in his life and his world and
[time=1843] in the thousands and thousands of lives that he touched.
[time=1848] I didn't go where some of the kids went.
[time=1851] And I didn't drink what some of the kids drank.
[time=1853] And I didn't swallow what some of the kids were swallowing.
[time=1855] I didn't smoke, I just did it.
[time=1857] I just did everything the way I was supposed to do it.
[time=1861] Four.
[time=1864] For him.
[time=1869] Now, one summer afternoon, I was seventeen years old.
[time=1871] I came home from work a little early and his car was in the driveway.
[time=1873] My mom was out of town and I walked in and there he sat in the recliner.
[time=1877] With tears just streaming down his face.
[time=1881] And I'd never seen my dad cry.
[time=1884] And he just wept.
[time=1887] I sat there for about an hour just trying to get a word out of him.
[time=1891] My mom was out of town on a trip with some friends and I thought she died.
[time=1896] And he said, "No, I just needed to tell you that I had to resign my position at the
[time=1902] church today." You see, for seventeen years, I was seventeen at the time.
[time=1909] He said, "For seventeen years I've been having an affair with another woman."
[time=1916] And it all came out today.
[time=1921] And that seventeen-year-old heart didn't quite know what to do.
[time=1925] Didn't quite know what to think.
[time=1928] Didn't quite know how to respond.
[time=1932] So all I could think to do at the moment was just be really clear about one thing.
[time=1937] I was done with him.
[time=1941] And I was certainly done with whoever he was.
[time=1948] Because at this stage of the game it was just all up for grabs.
[time=1951] And so I spent the next three years, finished my senior year of high school, slaughtered any testimony I had built in the previous three years, went away to play basketball at school, played a lot, played well, had fun, and committed myself in those three years to swallow smoke and drink
[time=1971] and do a chase after everything I had for years been told not to.
[time=1975] And there isn't a bit of that that I stand here today proud of or thankful for
[time=1982] just an angry, confused kid who had no idea how to make sense of what had happened.
[time=1991] And so three years later at the absolute bottom, and I mean it, the bottom of the barrel, two days away from going to Acapulco with ten guys for spring break
[time=2003] and we weren't going for a service project, I'll tell you that.
[time=2008] My mom calls from LA, home had been the Bay Area and now home was LA
[time=2014] and she called and was crying and asked if I'd come home and be with her.
[time=2019] Hadn't done that in three years.
[time=2022] So finally she broke and she asked and I gave my ticket to a friend and went home.
[time=2026] And that week I met eight guys, Rod, Matt, Paul, Dave, Mike, Greg, eight guys that just came
[time=2043] and I had known Matt for years and they just kind of put their arms around me.
[time=2047] Real cool, real calm, no big deal.
[time=2050] We went to the beach, we went out at night and had fun, their way.
[time=2057] They were wonderful guys, Christ followers.
[time=2061] And they invited me to a Bible study on that Friday night.
[time=2066] There I was on a Friday night at a Bible study.
[time=2073] They would have shuttered back at the frat house.
[time=2077] And then that Sunday I walked into a church where I sat in the back and heard for the first time.
[time=2083] Ever really explained and communicated and proclaimed the Word of God.
[time=2089] And it began to change me that day.
[time=2093] The guy teaching it was a guy named John MacArthur and the church was Grace Community Church.
[time=2100] And John and Patricia had been good friends with my dad and my mom and still were trying desperately to help them reconcile their marriage.
[time=2109] I went back to school and I knew something was up and John would actually call.
[time=2116] He would call periodically knowing that I was struggling, knowing that I was hurting, knowing that I was confused and he didn't call to preach and he didn't call to teach.
[time=2123] He just called to remind me of truth.
[time=2128] And I left that school and transferred, still un-surrendered to a Christian college there
[time=2135] in Southern California where I started that next August, 1983.
[time=2142] And it was in the back row at Grace Community Church in the first week of September, in the middle of Romans 7, where it says, "O wretched man that I am,
[time=2155] who will save me from this body of death that I just thoroughly and completely tossed in the towel.
[time=2166] I white flagged it, man. I just said I'm done." And for the first time surrendered my heart and life to him.
[time=2173] And it was the Word of God that got deep in my heart and began to pull me and draw me toward him.
[time=2184] I gave my heart and life to him that evening. It was a Sunday evening service.
[time=2188] And I said to him, "And I'll never forget this. I sat there with my head." You know, do you ever get tired of hearing me talk and you just lean your head on the wood in front of you on that pew back there? It's kind of comfortable. I know.
[time=2198] And I wasn't tired of hearing him talk. I just didn't want people to see me cry.
[time=2202] And so I put my head on the wood part of the pew and I was in the back and the tears are just dripping off the floor.
[time=2207] And I said to God, "I'll do this, but I will never, ever, ever be in ministry."
[time=2213] Don't you ever think for a moment that me surrendering my life would mean that I would ever expose myself to what I grew up with.
[time=2223] Put my family through what we went through, live with the pressures and the rigors of all that I will not do that.
[time=2230] And a week later I met a guy named Russ Moore who befriended me, put his arms around me,
[time=2240] could tell I was a confused young man with some semblance of potential.
[time=2245] And he said, "Hey, you want to help me with junior high kids?" At the church of about 10,000 people, there were about 500 junior high kids.
[time=2254] And after a few weeks, he gave me a small group of seventh grade boys.
[time=2259] There were about five of them, Danny Stepper and Rodney Anderson and a few others.
[time=2268] And I prepared a little talk on Daniel.
[time=2272] And I talked to those boys for about a half an hour on Daniel.
[time=2278] Probably just butchered the text and probably took things out of context and they listened.
[time=2285] And I left that night saying, "What in the world are you doing?
[time=2293] I can't do this, but everything in me having spent an hour and a half with five seventh grade boys wanted to."
[time=2302] All of that because of the power, the transforming power of this book and its truth.
[time=2311] And so here I am 20 years later still trying my best to keep your heads off the pew bars in front of you,
[time=2317] but hoping that he draws your heads to the pew in front of you.
[time=2323] And that he changes you, that he transforms you.
[time=2329] These are good things to consider as we come to what will be a verse by verse,
[time=2335] passage by passage study of the Apostle Paul's first letter to the church at Thessalonica.
[time=2343] First Thessalonians, that's right. Many of you have experienced something like this.
[time=2348] Some of you in the room haven't. We mean it. It's going to be a verse by verse wherever we end up that day.
[time=2354] We'll just pick up right there the next week and we will slowly but surely make our way through this great book.
[time=2361] And it may be eight weeks, it could be ten, it could be twelve, we just don't know.
[time=2366] We'll get done when he gets done teaching us and showing us whatever it is he has for us.
[time=2372] And you will see, Lord willing our hope and our prayer is that you will see in the weeks to come that these Thessalonians Christ followers,
[time=2381] they were changed just like I was.
[time=2385] They were exposed to the truth and it transformed them.
[time=2390] It changed them. What was old was made new. What was broken was healed.
[time=2396] What was deceived was given freedom. What was weary was given hope. What was lost was found.
[time=2404] It's what happens. Don't miss this.
[time=2407] It's what happens when the living God enters a fully surrendered heart.
[time=2411] That person is forever different. They're changed.
[time=2415] The young and growing band of Christ followers that the Apostle Paul writes to in Thessalonica had been changed.
[time=2422] You'll see that in chapter one. They had been drastically changed.
[time=2427] They needed to continue to change. You'll see that in chapters three and four.
[time=2433] And they would someday, we'll see in chapters four and five, they would someday be changed forever at an event called the Second Coming of Christ.
[time=2443] Then we'll study that and we'll look closely at that and we'll do our best to kind of put our arms around that great truth.
[time=2450] This letter of Paul speaks to the everyday issues of life.
[time=2454] There's in the early first century and hours today and it paints a picture of life transformation that will if you'll let it.
[time=2465] It will. I can promise you that. I can guarantee you that it will change your life if you'll let it.
[time=2476] If you will stop at nothing to come into those doors week after week in the next couple, two, three months or so.
[time=2482] If you spend time in the six days in between familiarizing yourself and reading and taking in the great truth of this book,
[time=2491] our study, his study, as he leads us through this, it will transform you. It'll change you.
[time=2499] It's what the Word of God does.
[time=2503] Now, before we jump into the text, I want to introduce you if I can.
[time=2508] Some of you, this will be an introduction for the very first time.
[time=2512] Others of you here, it might just be kind of a reacquaining yourself with, but I want to just, if we could take a few minutes and reintroduce us to the author.
[time=2522] Can we do that? Let me introduce you to Paul.
[time=2526] How appropriate, I was thinking this week, how very appropriate that a book that has within it such an emphasis on change and the transformation that God brings to a life.
[time=2537] How very appropriate that the guy who writes it is somebody who had himself and so radically changed.
[time=2546] Some of you know what I'm talking about, others of you don't, so let me just catch up if I can.
[time=2551] The great Apostle Paul wasn't always the Apostle Paul, you see, he begins.
[time=2557] He comes onto the scene as Saul, the Pharisee.
[time=2563] Let's look briefly at Saul's past. Saul's past. Saul was born into the Jewish tribe of Benjamin.
[time=2571] He was born into the Jewish tribe of Benjamin. He was a Hebrew, a Jew.
[time=2576] How many in the room raised your hand if you know how many tribes there were in the Israeli Jewish system?
[time=2581] How many tribes were there? Everybody say it one time, go. Good job. Raise your hand if you can name all 12.
[time=2586] I didn't think so.
[time=2589] You know what, he was raised in the region called Tarsus, and he was, get this, he was passionate.
[time=2595] And I can't say that strongly enough. I can't emphasize that enough. He was, this guy was passionate about his religious lineage.
[time=2604] He studied, you see, under the great Rabbi Gamaliel, and became as a young man a Pharisee.
[time=2610] Those were the religious leaders of the day. These were the guys who ran point over the entire Jewish community.
[time=2618] They were the ones who were in charge. They were the ones who called the shots.
[time=2622] They were the ones who had interpreted the Scriptures, these Pharisees, and he was a very zealous.
[time=2628] Get this now, a very zealous, I would say even enraged Pharisee.
[time=2636] You see Saul would be a guy who in the vernacular of our day, we would say Saul had issues.
[time=2645] Saul had some serious issues. He was enraged when it came to Jesus Christ, this man who had claimed to be the Messiah.
[time=2656] He was enraged when it came to Christ followers, and this movement that they had birthed.
[time=2662] Look with me at Philippians. Philippians chapter three, verse five. Philippians three, five.
[time=2669] Paul says in his letter, Paul now, looking back on his past, says in his letter to the Philippian church.
[time=2675] He says he was circumcised, you see it there, circumcised the eighth day, which was what every good Jewish family would do with their son.
[time=2684] He circumcised the eighth day of the nation of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews, as to the law of Pharisee.
[time=2693] And it goes on, if you will, look at verse six. As to the law of Pharisee, and then it says in Philippians three, six.
[time=2704] As to zeal, a persecutor of the church, a persecutor of the church.
[time=2712] As to the righteousness which is in the law found blameless, Paul saw himself as perfect as it related to the law, and he hated the church.
[time=2723] Look at Acts seven. Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, just before you get to Romans, turn your Bibles, look on with somebody else.
[time=2730] Maybe if you don't have one. Acts seven, go to verse 54.
[time=2740] Acts seven, 54 through 58.
[time=2746] Again, bringing a clearer picture of this man Saul and his past and his hatred for Christ and those that followed him.
[time=2756] It says now when they heard this, Acts seven, 54. Now when they heard this, they were cut to the quick.
[time=2762] Stop right there, just real quick. What we have here is the ending of Stephen's message.
[time=2769] Stephen, a faithful follower of Christ, has in the previous fifty-three verses laid out for these Jewish religious leaders on scathing and indicting attack on their godless selfishness.
[time=2785] Selfish, faithless treatment of the god of their fathers. And he goes back generation by generation by generation.
[time=2794] You should read it sometime. Just pick up Acts seven, start the beginning and you'll just see the scathing denunciation that Stephen brings against the religious leaders of the day.
[time=2804] He basically says you murdered Jesus and you're lost and you're going to hell and they don't like that too much.
[time=2811] And you see it pick up there in verse 54. Now when they heard this, they were cut to the quick and they began gnashing their teeth at him.
[time=2820] But being full of the Holy Spirit, he gazed intently into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. This is Stephen now.
[time=2830] And he said, "Behold, I see that heavens opened up and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God." But they, when they heard him say this, they cried out with a loud voice and covered their ears and rushed at him with one impulse.
[time=2844] And when they had driven him out of the city, they began stoning him. They are going to murder this guy for what he has said.
[time=2852] They have rocks and they're going to kill him. And the witnesses laid aside their robes that the feet of a young man named, say it, Saul.
[time=2862] There he is. People, he hated them.
[time=2868] He hated Jesus. He hated Christ followers. He hated this movement. He despised what was going on.
[time=2878] And in his zeal for the law, he was going to do everything he could to step on it, to squish it out, to end it. Look at chapter 8, Acts 8, 1-3.
[time=2891] Saul was in hearty agreement with putting him to death. And on that day, a great persecution. I mean, it lit, lit, lit, it lit Saul up.
[time=2899] I mean, it was just what he needed to get this thing rolling. It says there, on that day, a great persecution began against the church in Jerusalem.
[time=2907] They were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles. Some devout men buried Stephen and made loud lamentation over him.
[time=2915] But Saul began ravaging the church, entering house after house and dragging off men and women. He would put them into prison.
[time=2928] And you'll see on the screen some pictures, some renderings. And this isn't myth, folks.
[time=2939] This is the atmosphere that early Christ followers lived in. I mean, it really happened.
[time=2948] I mean, they really nailed people to the ground and cut their heads off if they wouldn't renounce their faith.
[time=2960] And Saul loved it. He bashed in the torture and the pain and the agony. He hated them.
[time=2968] I mean, they really, I mean, it's not just a movie, you know? It's not just something you see and, no, they really put believers in the Colosseum.
[time=2979] And they really starved lions so that when they put them in the Colosseum with the lions, the lions would eat them.
[time=2987] They really did tear them limb from limb. I mean, they really crucified Christ followers upside down. They really did.
[time=2994] And Saul loved it. People like you and me, moms and dads and families torn apart and treated like this.
[time=3003] They really did hang them in trees dipped in tar and light them as torches.
[time=3011] While they shoved food and drink down their mouths and garden parties 50 feet away, they really burned in the trees.
[time=3022] In his religious arrogance, he loved the law, the Jewish tradition, and he despised followers of Christ.
[time=3030] One early church father said this about Saul. He was inflamed and ignited by a seething hatred.
[time=3036] An anger of spirit that was murderously and relentlessly poured out on all who would name the name of Christ.
[time=3043] Did you know this about the great and godly Paul?
[time=3050] Were you aware of this that the apostle of all apostles spent years murdering and torturing innocent Christ followers?
[time=3064] Let me ask you this. Who's the most evil person you know?
[time=3069] Who's the most evil person you've ever heard of? Maybe you don't know him or her.
[time=3073] I mean, just for a moment, we won't dwell there long, but think about it. Who is the most evil, despicable, ruthless, insensitive, unkind person you've ever known?
[time=3082] They've brought nothing but pain and destruction and despair to the people in their lives. I mean, who is it?
[time=3089] Many of you in the room know someone like that. Many of you in the room have lived with an evil person.
[time=3097] Some of you may be not, but you know of someone. Let me ask you this. Do you believe that if...
[time=3107] Do you believe that if God...
[time=3113] Actually, we'll wait on that just a second. Let's read this first. And we'll come back to that. Go to Acts 9.
[time=3122] Go to Acts 9. First verse. Now Saul is still breathing threats. Breathing. He breathed it people.
[time=3131] Still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord went to the high priest and asked for letters from him to the synagogues at Damascus
[time=3140] so that if he found any belonging to the way, both men and women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
[time=3149] Are you following this? People, he ate Damascus, Mitch did some work this week on this and he found out we got about 130 miles northeast of Jerusalem.
[time=3159] Okay, this guy is going to go and there wasn't a tram and there wasn't a taxi. We're not talking about high-speed transport.
[time=3165] The guy was going to walk 130 miles because he hated him so much he wanted him captured and bound.
[time=3173] So he was going to put on his sandals and he goes to the high priest and says, "Give me papers. I want to go round them up."
[time=3181] Mitch showed me this week that in the Roman Empire, ethnic groups were considered to be governed by the laws of their own nation even when they moved to foreign lands.
[time=3191] Thus the six million Jews scattered throughout the Roman Empire were subject to rulings by the Sanhedrin back in Jerusalem.
[time=3198] Saul's letters from the high priest would be considered by the Damascus authorities and by the Jewish community
[time=3204] as adequate authorization to imprison any Christian Jews and return them to Jerusalem for judgment.
[time=3211] It was going on everywhere. Josephus, one of the early church fathers, records that 18,000 Jews were massacred there in Damascus in 66 AD.
[time=3221] And Paul, Paul's hoping for a little massacre himself, but instead he gets thumped.
[time=3232] He gets lit up, literally.
[time=3238] Saul.
[time=3240] Saul surrenders.
[time=3245] Acts 9, 3. It's amazing, people. As he was traveling, it happened.
[time=3250] That as he was approaching Damascus and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him and he fell to the ground
[time=3257] and heard a voice saying to him, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?"
[time=3263] And he said, "Who are you, Lord?" Interesting, I thought that he used the word "Lord." I would have expected, "Who are you?" Paul later writes in Romans 1 that all of us know, "Don't we?"
[time=3283] Everybody knows and he knew he's flat on his face on a road.
[time=3292] It's a real picture right there from the road to Damascus.
[time=3299] There on that road, a couple thousand years ago, at midday it says in Acts 22, "A light so bright takes this guy to the ground."
[time=3312] I am Jesus whom you are persecuting, but get up and enter the city and it will be told you what you must do.
[time=3318] The men who traveled with him stood speechless, hearing the voice, but seeing no one.
[time=3323] Saul got up from the ground and though his eyes were open he could see nothing and leading him by the hand and he brought him into Damascus and he was there three days without sight and neither eight nor drink.
[time=3332] People, Jesus Christ brings Saul to a fully surrendered down on the ground.
[time=3338] God, I'm yours, faith.
[time=3342] The voice, Jesus, his voice tells him to get up.
[time=3345] Did he? Yes or no?
[time=3348] Yeah.
[time=3349] He says, "Go into the city." Did he?
[time=3351] Yes or no?
[time=3352] Yeah.
[time=3354] The Lord says it's time and you know what? I don't know why, why then?
[time=3357] So much had transpired, so much had taken place, but it was time and God did what he does.
[time=3365] He transforms people.
[time=3367] He changes people and he transformed this murdering Christ hater.
[time=3373] And you'll see in chapter two of 1 Thessalonians that later on he says, "I love you.
[time=3378] I love you people like a nursing mom loves her baby.
[time=3382] I have," he says, "a far on the faction for you." This is Saul, who's now Paul.
[time=3391] It's amazing.
[time=3392] Would you stand?
[time=3393] And as you stand, let me just ask you this.
[time=3396] Back to that evil person that you know or know of.
[time=3403] You think God could change him or her?
[time=3407] I mean, having been where we've been this morning, are you reminded again that God is a God who transforms people?
[time=3414] And sometimes we write them off and just kind of designate them as just being of that.
[time=3420] But you know what?
[time=3421] I believe we would be wise, you and I, to pray for, to continue to do our best to come alongside anybody.
[time=3427] And how about you?
[time=3428] How are you doing?
[time=3431] You sometimes wonder why you're still stuck in certain sense.
[time=3434] You still wonder why sometimes you give into the same things you've been given into for the last 5, 10, 15, 20 years.
[time=3441] You ever wonder where the transforming power of God is in your life?
[time=3447] Let's just, let's just beg him.
[time=3450] Let's just beg him to, through the words of sacred truth, to change us and them.
[time=3459] And let's see what he has for us in the weeks to come, amen?
[time=3463] Father, we leave this place today so very thankful for you and so very thankful for the way you transform us and change us.
[time=3470] God, give us strength and courage to live as you've called us to live in the days to come and if it be your will, bring us back together again soon.
[time=3478] And all the people agreed and said, amen.
