[time=631] If you send this week, if you said something, you shouldn't have said, if you thought something, you shouldn't have thought.
[time=645] If you withheld love when it should have been offered freely, when you shared information, you shouldn't have when you raised your voice a little bit too loud.
[time=660] And whatever it was, if you send this week, did you just raise your hand?
[time=670] [MUSIC]
[time=672] And would you just keep them raised?
[time=674] And would you just pray with me, Father, we sit here this morning and people amazed by your grace.
[time=682] One sin, it's all it took, we should be done, gone, removed from the sight of a holy, all-consuming God.
[time=694] And yet it happens again and again and again and again.
[time=699] And so we humbly come before you again this morning with hands raised as sinners.
[time=705] Amazed at the unmerited favor that you continue to pour out your grace, God.
[time=714] It still amazes us and it always will and we are so grateful for it.
[time=719] And all the people agreed and said, amen, amen.
[time=728] Well, if you were with us last week, you know that we begin what will be an interesting and exciting and we believe life-changing series.
[time=738] In this book of First Thessalonians, we didn't actually get to First Thessalonians last week, we're going to try and get there this morning.
[time=745] But we jumped in last week with this book of First Thessalonians and its idea, one of its main themes being this idea of life transformation.
[time=756] I told you and we'll say it again this morning that you will see in the weeks to come and the months to come that throughout this book we will see again and again the fact that the Word of God and the Spirit of God and the people of God, when all of that comes together, life change, life transformation takes place.
[time=773] And we took some time last week and we'll kind of finish up our look this week at the author.
[time=779] We took some time to look at the author of First Thessalonians and we thought it was so ironic and so of God that in a book that talks about change, in a book that paints for us this picture of life transformation, isn't it amazing that the author of the book would be a guy who knew a little bit about change.
[time=799] He knew a little bit about a life being transformed, mainly his own, the book of First Thessalonians is written by the Apostle Paul, the great Apostle Paul, but we learned last week many of us for the first time that the great Apostle Paul wasn't always the great Apostle Paul.
[time=815] And at the time when he was Saul, Saul the Pharisee, Saul the Christ haters, Saul, Pharisee as we said with issues, he had some serious issues.
[time=830] He didn't like the church, he didn't like this Messiah that had come, he was completely and absolutely against what had transpired there, he had a seething hatred of Christ followers
[time=844] and of the church itself, he hated Christ followers individually and he hated them as a whole, he hated this growth and this blossoming church movement, he was a persecutor of the church and of Christ.
[time=859] So that was the great Apostle Paul, earlier as a young man, as a Jew, as a Pharisee who hated Christians, had a seething hatred of them.
[time=871] And we see that in Acts, we looked, if we can, we're just going to review just for a second, Acts 8, go back to Acts 8, you see in Acts 8, what has just transpired is a young Christ follower by the name of Stephen had boldly stood
[time=887] proclaimed the truth of the gospel to a large gathering of Jews and they had, as was most often the case, not responded well to this proclamation of truth.
[time=898] And at the end of chapter 7, they have stoned Stephen and it says there at the end of 7 that they laid their robes at the feet of a young man named Saul.
[time=907] Saul was the instigator, Saul was the persecutor, Saul was the one who was behind these beatings and these tortures and these murders and these imprisonments.
[time=916] He hated Christians.
[time=919] And it says there in chapter 8, Saul was in hearty agreement.
[time=922] Verse 1, Saul was in hearty agreement with putting him to death and on that day a great persecution began against the church in Jerusalem.
[time=931] And they were all scattered, it says, throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.
[time=937] Some devout men buried Stephen and made loud lamentation over him, but Saul began ravaging the church and dragging off men and women, he would put them in prison.
[time=950] This guy had it out for him. He was going to do everything he possibly could because of his extreme zealousness for the Jewish lineage in tradition.
[time=958] He was going to see as many Christians Christ followers put to death, put in prison as he could possibly get his hands on.
[time=968] Go to chapter 9, here we see the miraculous beginning to occur.
[time=974] You look at a guy like that, you think my goodness, there is absolutely no hope for him.
[time=978] Look at chapter 9, now Saul still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest there in Jerusalem.
[time=986] And he asked for letters from him to the synagogues at Damascus so that if he found any belonging to the way, both men and women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
[time=998] He hated him so much, he was going to strap on his sandals.
[time=1002] We noted that last week in a walk, the 130 to 135 miles that it would take to get to Damascus, round up any Christ followers he could find, both men and women, bind them,
[time=1014] and bring them back 135 miles to Jerusalem and put them in prison, or hopefully according to him they might die.
[time=1025] But God had something unbelievable in store.
[time=1032] Here we see the beginnings of Saul's surrender.
[time=1035] Verse 3, as he was traveling, it happened that he was approaching Damascus and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him.
[time=1042] And he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?"
[time=1049] And he said, "Who are you, Lord?" He said, "I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting, but get up and enter the city and it will be told to you what you must do."
[time=1061] The men who traveled with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one.
[time=1065] Saul got up from the ground and though his eyes were open, he could see nothing and leading him by the hand, they brought him into Damascus.
[time=1074] And he was there, he was three days, and he was three days without sight and neither ate nor drank.
[time=1082] Saul's surrender.
[time=1085] You saw some things right there in that passage, we noted him last week just to briefly go back and touch him again.
[time=1091] His surrender is marked by a number of things.
[time=1093] He acknowledges Christ as Lord.
[time=1095] You saw it there as he's down on the ground in the midst of this unbearable light.
[time=1099] He says, "What, who are you, Lord?" He obeys Saul's surrender acknowledged not only in his addressing the Lord as Lord, but he obeys the Lord.
[time=1113] He said, "Get up. Did he get up? Yes." He said, "Go into the city. Did he go into the city? Yes." He acknowledges Christ as Lord. He obeys the Lord.
[time=1122] He evidences a surrendered heart by the presence.
[time=1125] Here you go. We didn't get this far last week. Write this down by the presence of a changed life.
[time=1130] The evidence is a surrendered heart by the presence of a changed life.
[time=1134] Many of you in the room this morning would raise your hand and say, "I have surrendered."
[time=1140] God's Word gives you a great opportunity this morning.
[time=1143] It gives you a great opportunity at any time.
[time=1145] But this morning it gives us collectively a chance to just say, "You know what? Part of that is a changed life."
[time=1152] You say you're his, you say you're in, you say you have given him all of your heart and life.
[time=1158] Are you changing?
[time=1160] Do we see the transforming work of the Holy Spirit and the Word of God in your life?
[time=1165] Not are you perfect, not are you there, but are you changing? Are you being transformed?
[time=1174] It's amazing. I bump into this all the time.
[time=1177] And it does my heart good.
[time=1179] Most of you would understand that when you give yourself to something, when you pray for something, when you try to use your gifts as best you can to do the part that you play, it always means a lot to you.
[time=1191] I know it does to me when you see God at work in the lives of people.
[time=1195] I got a letter this week from a gal who just about 10, 11 months ago,
[time=1201] sat right here in this room and surrendered her heart and life to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1206] And she writes me 11 months later.
[time=1209] And as I read it, it struck me that a year ago, I mean a year ago today, she was a young lady who didn't know the Lord.
[time=1217] She didn't love the truth.
[time=1219] She had no capacity to really love people.
[time=1222] She was absolutely and thoroughly lost, wandering in darkness, no hope, no heart, no life to speak of spiritually.
[time=1232] And 11 months later, her life has been transformed. She's changing.
[time=1236] She's not there yet, but she is changing right before our eyes.
[time=1239] And she was part of a group of about 30 that went two weeks ago to a church leadership conference.
[time=1245] And she writes upon return, it was the most life-altering trip I've ever experienced.
[time=1250] And I read this to you just so you sense what has happened in one's heart who was completely separated from him.
[time=1258] 11 months of this and 11 months of you and 11 months of him moving and working in her heart.
[time=1268] She writes, "It was the most life-altering trip I've ever experienced.
[time=1271] The first family vacation, as it was also the first time I've heard and accepted ever,
[time=1278] and I love you from a family member." I think my grandparents may have said it at time or two, but I never took it personally.
[time=1286] I don't recall my parents ever saying it to me, but I'm sure they each have their own reasons.
[time=1291] Hugs and physical touch have always been a scary thing for me.
[time=1294] I used to get scared if somebody even put their hand on my shoulder.
[time=1297] It freaked me out at times I still get nervous, but other times lately I just don't want the other person to let go.
[time=1303] Blackhawk is really helping me learn so much about what real love is.
[time=1307] It's even helping me love people more openly, especially my mom.
[time=1311] I cannot wait for her to come to know God.
[time=1314] When she comes to Blackhawk, she will love it.
[time=1317] Unfortunately, my dad is the only thing stopping her.
[time=1320] I just have to keep, listen to this, I was amazed after 11 months that it would be put like this.
[time=1324] It had never come to my mind after 20 years to say it like this.
[time=1328] I was really encouraged.
[time=1329] She says, "I just have to keep God in the way of my attitude toward him."
[time=1335] Need to put God in the way of your attitude toward somebody?
[time=1344] She mentioned with reference to her dad.
[time=1347] I'm so excited for that day to come when they give their lives to Christ.
[time=1351] Sometimes I think it's more difficult to be around my dad than before because now I have to show love toward him rather than anger.
[time=1357] On the other hand, knowing that my reaction represents God makes it easier.
[time=1361] It's all about God.
[time=1363] I want God to continue to shape and form my heart into a newer person every day.
[time=1369] People get changed.
[time=1374] They get transformed and Saul had been transformed.
[time=1377] Check this out. We didn't get to read this far last week.
[time=1380] We kind of left him on the road or heading into the city.
[time=1384] Watch what transpires.
[time=1386] Go to Acts 9, pick it up in verse 10.
[time=1388] Okay, now this has happened on the road and now he's coming into town.
[time=1391] Now there was a disciple at Damascus named Ananias.
[time=1394] This is a Christ follower, right?
[time=1396] And the Lord said to him, now you picture yourself, okay?
[time=1400] You picture yourself being Ananias.
[time=1402] You're a Christ follower in the city of Damascus and the word is out.
[time=1407] That Saul of Tarsus is on his way.
[time=1410] And everybody in that region knows exactly what this guy is about.
[time=1414] This guy is out to murder.
[time=1416] This guy is out to maim.
[time=1417] This guy is out to capture.
[time=1419] This guy is out to do everything he can.
[time=1421] To do everything he can.
[time=1423] Despicable and unruly in the sight of.
[time=1426] He just wants to wipe these folks out.
[time=1427] So you're Ananias.
[time=1428] You're a Christ follower in Damascus.
[time=1430] And here comes God.
[time=1433] And the Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias.
[time=1436] And he said, here I am, Lord.
[time=1438] And the Lord said to him, get up and go to the street called straight and inquire at the house of Judas for a man from Tarsus named Saul for he is praying.
[time=1447] And he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias.
[time=1451] You come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight.
[time=1459] But Ananias answered.
[time=1461] Remember we talked a few weeks ago about first-time obedience and how yes mom and dad or mom and dad may I ask a question.
[time=1468] Those are like the only two appropriate responses so he goes for the second errors.
[time=1473] But Ananias answered, Lord, I don't know about you, but I've heard some things.
[time=1479] I've heard from many about this man how much harm he did to your saints in Jerusalem.
[time=1483] And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on your name.
[time=1489] But the Lord said to him, go, for he is a chosen instrument of mine to bear my name before
[time=1496] the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel.
[time=1499] For I will show him how much he must suffer for my name's sake.
[time=1503] So Ananias departed.
[time=1507] He went, didn't he?
[time=1509] He asked one time.
[time=1512] Everybody get that?
[time=1513] And I'm not just looking at you kids.
[time=1516] He asked one time, for a little help, God said, you heard me, go, and what did he do?
[time=1525] He went.
[time=1526] I think it was all cleared up for him in his mind.
[time=1529] I think he was a little bit afraid.
[time=1531] I think he may have had some questions, think he may have kind of been standing back inside going, okay, now do you really know what you're asking me to do?
[time=1540] And he went.
[time=1543] Departed and entered the house, and after laying his hands on him said, brother?
[time=1547] Wow, look at that, brother saw.
[time=1551] The Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road by which you were coming has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit, and immediately there fell from his eyes something like scales, and he regained his sight and he got up and was baptized, and he took food and was strengthened, and here he goes.
[time=1570] Now for several days he was with the disciples who were at Damascus, and immediately he began
[time=1576] to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues, saw the Pharisee with issues, immediately begins
[time=1585] to proclaim Jesus in the synagogue saying he is the Son of God, he used to kill people
[time=1591] for saying that, and he stands before him and he says with all the boldness and courage
[time=1598] he is the Son of God.
[time=1602] All those hearing him continued to be amazed and were saying, wait a minute, is this not he who in Jerusalem destroyed those who called on this name and who had come here for the
[time=1613] purpose of bringing them bound before the chief priests, but Saul kept increasing in
[time=1619] strength and confounding the Jews who lived at Damascus by proving that this Jesus was
[time=1627] the Christ.
[time=1628] How that go?
[time=1629] Well here you go, same song, different verse, when many days had elapsed the Jews plotted
[time=1635] together to do away with him.
[time=1640] And here we are.
[time=1643] Saul's past is gone.
[time=1646] His surrender has now been made crystal clear, and now we have Paul's future, Paul's future
[time=1654] which is going to be an amazing future at that.
[time=1658] It's incredible to just read through the book of Acts and you see that as his future ministry and his future life begins to unfold, he actually departs from the scene for a bit.
[time=1668] We don't see him for a few chapters, he's gone and as you read in other places you realize
[time=1674] that it was necessary, it looks as if it was necessary for God to kind of take him away for a bit to prepare him for what would come.
[time=1684] He leaves the scene for a period of time, but he's back on the scene with a passion and he comes back at a very, very crucial time.
[time=1691] Look at Acts 11.
[time=1693] Look at Acts chapter 11, verse 19, you see what is so crucial about this is that for the first time, well actually let me just read it to you and you'll kind of see as we go what transpires, it says in Acts 11, 19, so then those who were scattered because of
[time=1709] the persecution, Christ followers, scattered because of the persecution that occurred in connection with Stephen made their way to Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch speaking the word to no one except to Jews alone.
[time=1723] See stop right there just for a moment.
[time=1724] We studied this a couple of years ago in our study here of the book of Acts.
[time=1728] At the beginning of this deal it was thought that this gospel would only be for the Jews.
[time=1734] There was this notion that they would go out but they would only speak it to the chosen people.
[time=1739] But what happens here in Acts 11 and in the chapters that come is an amazing revelation
[time=1745] that the gospel is in fact going to be made available to every one, everybody but there
[time=1752] were some of them, verse 20, men of Cyprus and Cyrene who came to Antioch and began speaking to the Greeks, Gentiles also preaching the Lord Jesus and the hand of the Lord was with
[time=1764] them and a large number who believed turned to the Lord.
[time=1768] The news about them reached the ears of the church at Jerusalem and they sent Barnabas off to Antioch.
[time=1775] Then when he arrived and witnessed the grace of God he rejoiced and began to encourage them all with resolute heart to remain true to the Lord for he was a good man and full of the
[time=1786] Holy Spirit and of faith and considerable numbers were brought to the Lord.
[time=1790] Barnabas realized as this is heavy duty stuff the spirit is at work and people are coming and above and beyond everything else he realized as he needs help and he left for Tarsus to
[time=1801] look for who, Saul.
[time=1805] And when he had found him he brought him to Antioch and for an entire year they met with the church and taught considerable numbers and the disciples were first called Christians.
[time=1816] Did you know this?
[time=1818] This is the first time that we were called Christians.
[time=1822] As this massive work of God in the lives of both Jews and Gentiles culminates in those
[time=1828] coming to faith in Antioch and they are called Christians.
[time=1832] And Paul, people I want you to see right here, it is at this point and you would if you were to read through the rest of the book of Acts you would see this begin to unfold.
[time=1840] Paul begins to give himself completely and wholeheartedly to the two things that God
[time=1846] made him to do.
[time=1848] He begins to give himself with great passion to the two things that God made him to do.
[time=1853] Preach the gospel and establish the church.
[time=1857] That's the call that God gave him to preach the gospel primarily though not only but primarily
[time=1864] in the chapters to come now to the Gentile world.
[time=1869] And he does it, he does it with passion, he does it with boldness, he does it with courage.
[time=1874] Some of you in the room this morning are aware of how well he did it.
[time=1878] Others of you maybe just could use a refresher for some, maybe it's the first time you've ever heard this but let me just briefly just kind of fast forward in an effort to kind
[time=1889] of help you see the way in which he gave himself to that which God called him to do.
[time=1894] Preach the gospel, establish the church.
[time=1897] In the New Testament you have the books Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, right?
[time=1901] There's four written by those four, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.
[time=1904] Then you have the book of Acts which tells of the birth of the church and the spread of the gospel written by the great physician Luke.
[time=1910] Then you come to the book of Romans.
[time=1912] The book of Romans, this incredible book in the Bible that gives almost a theology of the gospel and Christian living, living written by the apostle who, Paul, written by the apostle Paul to the church at Rome.
[time=1924] Then you have first Corinthians and second Corinthians, amazing books of correction and doctrine and direction written to the church at Corinth by the apostle who, Paul.
[time=1936] You have the book of Galatians, written to the church at Galatia, an amazing book helping
[time=1944] correct doctrine, helping re-establish the truth of the gospel, written to the church at Galatia by the apostle who, Paul, Galatians, Ephesians, written to the church at Ephesus
[time=1957] by the apostle Paul, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, the letter written to the church
[time=1963] at Philippi, an amazing book of encouragement and truth written by the apostle who, Paul,
[time=1971] Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Colossae, another book written by the apostle
[time=1979] Paul, first and second Thessalonians, written by the apostle Paul, first and second Timothy.
[time=1985] Paul writes to his young child in the faith, this young struggling pastor at Ephesus named Timothy, he writes to encourage him and remind him of what is true and right, Titus, written
[time=1997] by the apostle Paul to a young man in need of encouragement as well, Philemon, written
[time=2005] to Philemon from the apostle Paul.
[time=2010] He was called to do two things, preach the gospel and establish the church.
[time=2013] How do you do?
[time=2015] My goodness, he did well.
[time=2019] He was faithful to that which God called him to and he did it with courage and I want you to just lock in on this for a few minutes or this morning.
[time=2028] People he did, he had a calling and it was to preach the gospel and establish the church and he did what God called him to do with great courage and great conviction.
[time=2039] He did it with passion, he was absolutely relentless with what God called him to do.
[time=2047] And you see the deal is, see you and I have been given callings and see right now, just right here, I want you to stop something because right now in your minds in many of your minds you're starting to already go where I sometimes go and that is to say, wait a minute now, come on, this is a square peg in a round hole, this is apples and oranges, Kelly, this is Paul and now you're going to walk over on this side of the stage and you're going to see now you and I have callings too.
[time=2073] And I did walk to the other side of the stage and I am telling you, you got a calling too that God has called you in your relationship with him.
[time=2081] He has called you to faithfully and passionately with great conviction and courage, go do what
[time=2088] he has called you to do and whatever circumstance he's put you in and he got out of bed the same
[time=2095] way you do.
[time=2097] He put on his sandals, the one sandal at a time.
[time=2101] He was a normal guy just like you and me who availed himself, who made himself available
[time=2107] and with great courage and conviction stayed at it.
[time=2115] Go to, let me just show you a little bit of this, go to Acts, watch how this thing unfolds, go to Acts 14, go to Acts chapter 14, Paul, the way this began to happen, if you've read
[time=2129] through the book of Acts you know he took these missionary journeys, he took these evangelistic tours where he just got out on the road, hooked up his knapsack and his sandals and he was gone hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of miles, boat trips and by land and he just preached the gospel and established the church.
[time=2147] He did it three times covering hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of miles and in Acts
[time=2155] 14 in the midst of his first missionary journey he comes, you'll see there in 14 he initially
[time=2162] comes to a place called Iconium, in Iconium, first part of 14, I don't think this will be on the screen so just look on with somebody if you don't have your Bible with you, 14 he's in Iconium, but now watch this, we're going to go to 19 but don't miss 5.
[time=2177] As always was the case, he spoke the truth and a lot of folks didn't like it and verse 5 and when an attempt was made by both the Gentiles and the Jews with their rulers to
[time=2188] mistreat and to stone them, they became aware of it and they fled to the cities of Lyconia,
[time=2196] Lystra and Derby.
[time=2199] So they go to Lystra, you see in 8 verse 8 at Lystra and they're in Lystra and again
[time=2206] he begins to proclaim the truth, about verse 14 it picks up and then on through 14 down to 18 he delivers the gospel message, he delivers the message of truth, he delivers the message
[time=2217] of Jesus Christ and verse 19 here we go.
[time=2221] But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, see they followed this guy around, now they hated
[time=2227] him so much, Jews came from Antioch and Iconium and having won over the crowds they stoned
[time=2235] Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing him to be dead.
[time=2241] Now stop right there, Mitch would you do me a favor and pick up this bucket of rocks right here and Dave, shock would you come up here and pick up this bucket of rocks and would you guys just kind of go down the aisles and just pass them out?
[time=2254] Just make your way back, just grab a rock from these guys, I did some interesting things that I don't free on, treat it kind of like just pass them down, look at them, hold on to them okay, hold on to these rocks, look at them, take a minute and hold on to them and then just kind of pass them back, you know after you've looked at it and given it to the person next to you that just pass it across the aisle and let the rocks just make their way back, here's the deal on the rocks people, I did some study on this this week and you know I probably should have known this by now in my life of ministry and study
[time=2284] but I learned something new for the first time and that is that they didn't throw pebbles.
[time=2290] They did this a lot in that day and what they would throw is basically a softball size boulder
[time=2300] and there were many of them on hand just for these occasions and as you hold that rock
[time=2308] and as you look at it in your hand, I just want you to get a visual, I just want you
[time=2314] to get a real up-close look at what hit this guy in the side of the head for what would
[time=2321] have been 20 to 30 minutes.
[time=2325] It was an amazing search for me as I just read about how these stonings would occur and
[time=2332] the other point I'm making here is this, that these people in this time, in this setting, see they were used to doing this, this was not a new adventure, they had done this many, many times and so when it says there in the text that they stoned him and they dragged him out and supposed him to be dead, these were people that have looked at dead bodies
[time=2353] before who had been stoned.
[time=2356] They didn't let him off the hook here is what I'm saying, they killed him.
[time=2360] They threw softball size boulders at his head and upper body for 20 to 30 minutes until
[time=2367] he was a bloody bludgeoned mess, dead and it says, but look at verse 20, this is where
[time=2379] I just go, okay, this is, this is why sometimes when I say, okay, he was a different league.
[time=2384] But while the disciples stood around him, he got up, see if this was the story of Kelly,
[time=2390] it would say, he got up and ran as fast as he could away from the city where all the
[time=2400] crazy people were who had just killed him.
[time=2404] But while the disciples stood around him, he got up and does it say what I think it says?
[time=2412] You tell me, you say it out loud, go ahead.
[time=2418] She entered the city.
[time=2423] She Paul had a calling on his life and Paul was courageous and he lived with great conviction
[time=2430] as it related to the two things God had made him to do.
[time=2433] God said to him, preach the gospel and establish the church, so you know what's a guy going to do?
[time=2438] That's all he did.
[time=2441] Says he got up and entered the city.
[time=2445] How those rocks doing?
[time=2448] Here's the deal on the rock.
[time=2449] I know that this week, I know that you are not going to get stoned.
[time=2455] You are not going to be dragged out of a city, laid in a pile of dirt and have softball size boulders thrown at your head for 20 minutes.
[time=2466] I know that.
[time=2469] But I also know this.
[time=2471] I also know that in this room this morning that there are men and women here today who
[time=2477] have a really, really hard marriage.
[time=2481] I mean, truth be told, it's just not good and it hasn't been and it's not getting any
[time=2489] better.
[time=2491] And for you, husband or wife, whoever you are, you see for you, no, it's not the same
[time=2497] literally, but you know what, for you sometimes to do what's right, for you sometimes to stay
[time=2503] at it for you, sometimes to keep doing what God has called you to do, sometimes for you.
[time=2511] I mean, you might as well take a rock and hit me on the side of the head because it hurts.
[time=2518] And it's hard and it's lonely and it's painful.
[time=2523] There are people in this room today and you're trying your best to take a stand at work.
[time=2528] You're trying to stay ethical, you're trying to stay on this path of integrity and everywhere
[time=2535] around you, they're just compromising like crazy and they're getting rich because of it.
[time=2541] And yet you feel in your heart this desire to stay true to what you know is right and it hurts.
[time=2547] It's painful.
[time=2551] Like a rock on the side of your head.
[time=2553] You know what, there's students in this room this morning.
[time=2556] There's high school students and middle school students and there's college age students and 20-somethings and I just got to tell you, I cannot believe sometimes the culture and
[time=2570] the message of this culture and the fiery arrows of the enemy that are everywhere you
[time=2580] go.
[time=2581] Every magazine you look at, every television show you watch, every movie you go to me, it is absolutely, it is 50 times more than I ever experienced as an 18-year-old.
[time=2592] And the message to you students and young people is the same compromise.
[time=2598] Take your clothes, wear as few clothes as you can, get involved in as much illicit activity
[time=2604] as you can, literally or online, expose yourself to pornography, give yourself with reckless
[time=2611] abandon to whatever you want to give yourself to.
[time=2617] And there's this, there's this something inside of many of you that wants to do what's right.
[time=2624] And yet to stand and to get up day after day and to keep moving toward what is true and what is good and acceptable, it's hard.
[time=2633] Some of you in this room want to give up on a friend.
[time=2637] Some of you in this room need desperately, need desperately to continue to walk the road
[time=2645] away from addiction, well, away from addiction on stuff toward addiction to him.
[time=2657] And it's painful.
[time=2659] And you're not getting drag out of the city and thrown on a heat, but you're facing that
[time=2666] stuff every day.
[time=2667] And I just want to be a voice on the side that stands here with you today and says as I look at this man and what he did, I just want to say to you again, be courageous.
[time=2679] Be brave people.
[time=2681] Do what's right, obey God.
[time=2684] When you mess up ask for help, seek his forgiveness, confess and repent and go in the, go in the,
[time=2690] go in an opposite direction, but do everything you can to fulfill the calling that God has
[time=2696] given your life, to do the things that God has given you to do and don't waste a minute.
[time=2702] And when the rocks come and they will get back up and go into the city, I mean, as long
[time=2709] as that's wise, again, I realize there are some situations where it would be wisdom and obedience to go away from the one throwing the rock, but ask for help on those situations.
[time=2720] In the general every day of rock throwing that you and I encounter, we need to be people
[time=2729] with courage and boldness.
[time=2730] Well, you know what, look at 2 Corinthians 11, this one will come on the screen.
[time=2736] Let me just show you again, the kind of, let me show you again, the kind of courage that you and I need to have, though our courage won't look like this, I realize it's the kind of courage.
[time=2747] It's the kind of determination.
[time=2749] It's the kind of boldness.
[time=2752] It's the kind of willingness that you and I have got to possess.
[time=2756] Paul says in 2 Corinthians 11, "Are they servants of Christ?
[time=2759] I speak as if insane.
[time=2760] I'm more so.
[time=2762] In far more labors, in far more imprisonments, beaten times without number, couldn't even
[time=2768] give you a number when asked to tell you how many times he'd been beaten, can't even give
[time=2774] you a number, often in danger of death," says in 24, "five times I received from the
[time=2780] Jews, 39 lashes, 40 was the death penalty, five times he received 39, in 25, three times
[time=2788] I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, acts 14, three times I was shipwrecked, a night
[time=2794] and a day I have spent in the deep floating in water." Basically, 26 goes on to say, "I have been on frequent journeys and dangers from rivers,
[time=2804] from robbers, from my countrymen, dangers from the Gentiles, dangers in the city, dangers
[time=2810] in the wilderness, dangers on the sea, dangers among false brethren.
[time=2815] I have been in labor and hardship through many sleepless nights in hunger and thirst, often without food and cold and exposure, naked, no clothes.
[time=2826] Apart from such external things, there is the daily pressure on me of concern for all the churches.
[time=2835] As I read about Paul this week again, I was reminded of the fact that bottom line, you know what people he really believed this stuff, he really, really believed what he had given
[time=2845] his heart and life to, what he had surrendered to on that road, he was completely in on.
[time=2852] And no matter what came, there was a willingness to courageously and with great conviction, stay the course.
[time=2858] Well, in Acts 16, he goes to a place called Philippi, guess what?
[time=2864] He gets into trouble.
[time=2866] They cast an evil spirit out of a gal who was making these guys some money and they have
[time=2872] Paul and his partner beaten with rods thrown into prison, into the inner prison it says,
[time=2879] into solitary where they were put in stocks and it says at midnight he was singing hymns, singing songs of praise in the inner prison having been beaten with rods and God comes
[time=2892] and delivers them with a mighty earthquake and as he's leaving the jailer who has witnessed all of this realizes as he converses with Paul what has transpired and that jailer comes
[time=2904] to faith his whole household.
[time=2908] But the climate is kind of hot and tense so he moves on in Acts 17 to a town called Thessalonica.
[time=2916] You're thinking two Sundays and we're finally getting there.
[time=2918] Here we are.
[time=2920] He comes to Thessalonica and we will see in the weeks to come this amazing book unfold.
[time=2928] And I want you to know that in coming to Thessalonica and as he ministers there and then years, few years later he writes this letter, he's actually in Corinth when he writes,
[time=2940] this letter of appreciation, this letter of encouragement, this letter that really in
[time=2946] essence kind of his Paul sharing his heart on how thankful he is for the fact that they were once this and now they're this and he is so very grateful for what they've done.
[time=2956] There are some things they need to keep working at and he gets to those and we'll get to those in the weeks to come.
[time=2963] But as I read this week about how grateful he was for them, it was amazing for me personally just because I'm so very grateful for you.
[time=2971] I'm so very thankful for the things that you have allowed God to do in you as a family.
[time=2977] So many of us have come from here and because of the Spirit of God and because of the Word of God and the people of God, we've been transformed and he's still transforming us.
[time=2986] But when you see it, when you experience it, when you stand where I stand or you read what
[time=2992] I read and I just wanted to bring something to you this morning as we close.
[time=2996] Just listen to this, would you?
[time=2997] This came to me this week and I couldn't wait to share it with you because I am so appropriately proud of what you are willing to give yourselves to.
[time=3007] And please don't tune out here, listen to what the transforming work of God is doing in your
[time=3015] lives as it impacts others, our family, Dear Pastor Bird and Black Hawk family, our family visited Black Hawk this past Sunday and I just felt the need to tell you what a tremendous experience it was.
[time=3026] We have been watching the Bible hour.
[time=3028] Do you know how many people tell me that?
[time=3031] Do you know how many hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people?
[time=3035] Tell me that all the time.
[time=3037] Young and old, church and non-church.
[time=3042] The work that these individuals do, the hours that they put in, and here it is again, we had been watching the Bible hour for the past year or so, but the televised broadcast doesn't come close to conveying the absolute love and worship of the Lord and the incredible warmth and family feel we observed and felt from the moment we approached the front doors.
[time=3062] There is no doubt of God's presence in this ministry.
[time=3066] After a year of continuing to attend a church where we felt no support and no growth, we felt God was prompting us to go outside the comfort of familiarity and find a church that challenged us and helped us to live our lives for him.
[time=3078] It took a few weeks, but we finally began discussing what we needed to do and the Lord led us to you.
[time=3084] The sheer size of Black Hawk intimidated me and I feared we would get lost in the shuffle and I feared it would be difficult to get to know people.
[time=3092] See, I've been failing miserably in my daily walk with him in my times of study and no I need a friend to keep me accountable.
[time=3100] Although we've only attended one week, I believe I can and will find that with Black Hawk.
[time=3105] Our oldest daughter loved her toddler class with her limited vocabulary.
[time=3110] She has told us several times a day about hearing a story coloring and playing in the gym.
[time=3116] We weren't sure she would leave the classroom to come home.
[time=3119] The music and sermon moved John and I to tears, something we haven't felt in some time during worship.
[time=3125] Then the home visit, remember that in just a second, then the home visit from Curt and
[time=3131] Kathy just floored us.
[time=3134] What a tremendous outreach and ministry they have welcoming people for the first time.
[time=3139] It made us wish that Sunday we were much closer so we could hurry and come back.
[time=3144] I guess the whole point of this rambling was to say thanks, to say what a wonderful ministry
[time=3150] you all have, that the heart and love of Jesus has felt and shown and finally that I think you have gained another family in the Black Hawk flock despite the 45-minute drive.
[time=3166] See part of our greeting ministry is there are several couples in our church who load up their kids in car seats, put welcome baskets together and sometimes beat the visitors home.
[time=3178] They don't go in, they don't do any promotion, they just walk up to the front door, hand them a gift and say it was really nice having you in church today.
[time=3189] And it doesn't matter, I guess for our people who do this, that these folks were 45 minutes
[time=3195] away.
[time=3199] In Christ's love, and she signs it for her and her husband, it's an amazing thing.
[time=3205] When you see lives altered, it's amazing thing when you see lives changed.
[time=3210] It's an incredible gift for someone like me to be a part of a family like this.
[time=3217] And would you all please stay at it?
[time=3220] Would you all please be courageous if you need help ask, but know today, and I'm going
[time=3226] to ask the guys to run the video here in just a second, know today that there is absolutely no greater endeavor than what we've been given the opportunity to be a part of.
[time=3235] Here in this family, give yourselves to it, give yourselves to it completely with courage and conviction.
[time=3242] What he does with that is forever, and there is nothing like a changed life that has been
[time=3249] transformed.
[time=3250] We'll see it in here in the weeks to come, watch the screens this morning as we just look back on the celebration we had recently as we came together to celebrate changed and transform lives.
[time=3268] There is a fountain filled with blood drawn from me man, you'll face.
[time=3280] And sinners punched beneath that fold lose all their guilty stays, lose all their guilty
[time=3300] stays, lose all their guilty stays, lose all their guilty stays, lose all their guilty
[time=3393] stays, lose all their guilty stay, lose all their guilty stays, lose all their guilty
[time=3600] [BLANK_AUDIO]
