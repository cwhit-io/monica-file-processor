[time=30] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=90] Hallelujah, Hallelujah, what I say you.
[time=101] [MUSIC - 351 seconds]
[time=453] I love how this song says that every single breath that we take, and every single moment that the Lord has given us, that we want it to be His,
[time=464] and we want to be used by Him.
[time=467] I always think of the phrase that says that every breath is something that we need to be a good steward of.
[time=476] We can't just limit it to a specific time, but every single breath and every single moment is one that we need to breathe in half that's His.
[time=489] So let's sing that together and dedicate it to Him.
[time=493] [MUSIC]
[time=495] Lord, I give You my heart, I give You my soul, I give for You alone, and every breath that I take, and every moment I'm away.
[time=541] But have Your way.
[time=547] [MUSIC - 14 seconds]
[time=562] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, Senior Pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries, and I'm so thankful for the chance to be with you again,
[time=568] and as you can see today, I am not alone, and I'm really grateful for that.
[time=573] This is Corbin Miller.
[time=575] Hi.
[time=576] And he is our worship pastor, and for those of you wondering, we should just go ahead and clear this up right now.
[time=582] Corbin is not my son.
[time=584] No.
[time=585] And any of you who would think I to be that old, any of you who think that I might could possibly have a son who's 23, it's possible.
[time=594] It's possible.
[time=596] I'm not going to say I was offended, but anyway, we'll just get past that.
[time=599] He's not my son, but boy, what a great friend and partner in ministry God has brought to my life and to the life of this family.
[time=607] And we're so thankful that we get to be a part of what we do here day after day and week after week.
[time=613] As many of you know, over the last 27 years, Black Hawk and this ministry that God's given us,
[time=619] we have had the privilege for 27 years to bring the message of Christmas, portrayed and communicated through the arts to this community.
[time=628] And we are so ready and so looking forward to doing that again.
[time=633] These days we call it Christmas with Black Hawk, and the theme, the title that we've given this year's performance is Home.
[time=640] And it is a captivating and compelling story and the things that I have seen already as the folks have been preparing under Corbin's leadership and with the help of so many others.
[time=651] They've been working on this since February.
[time=653] And the things that I have seen lead me to believe in my heart that it's going to be a really, really special couple of weeks there at the beginning of December.
[time=662] I've asked Corbin if he would just kind of share with you his heart and his excitement for this project.
[time=669] And I think as you listen to him talk about it, you'll understand what a wonderful opportunity this is going to be.
[time=675] Thanks, Kelly.
[time=676] As you said, this year's message is all about home.
[time=680] We've been brainstorming this idea and talking amongst our crew about what home is to each of us and talking about the different levels of home and how it's not just home
[time=691] as in home for the holidays, but how we can make Christ's home in our heart.
[time=696] And even on a different level that home isn't just what we see around us because the word tells us that the world around us is going to burn one day.
[time=704] And that the real investment, the real home that we have is eternity.
[time=708] And it's eternity with them or eternity without them.
[time=711] And that's really what the crux of Christmas for all of us.
[time=714] And that's where we need you to come in because we can't do this without you.
[time=719] Christmas with Blackhawk isn't an end in itself, but it's a means to an end.
[time=724] It's a means to get people to know about that eternity that they can have with our Father in Heaven.
[time=730] So this year as you're sitting at home thinking about who you might be able to invite to Christmas with Blackhawk,
[time=737] I just want to encourage you to think along the lines of people who don't know about that eternal home in Heaven.
[time=743] And think about bringing them here because we're going to do our best to bring up in so many different ways using lights and costumes and drama and music and a powerful message from Kelly or Mitch.
[time=755] Hopefully we're working on that.
[time=757] But in that process we want you to be able to come and experience all that with your friends.
[time=762] But then more importantly we're excited about that coffee you might have with them or that breakfast or lunch or that chat in your living room where you can talk about the things that matter to them, the eternity that's really important, not the home that we see, but the opportunity to have a home in Heaven with Christ and with our Father.
[time=780] Someday with Him. We are really looking forward to it and we don't want you to miss it.
[time=786] So just do whatever you can. I mean stop it nothing to get ahold of as many tickets as you can.
[time=792] The information is going to be here on the screen for you. All your ticket needs.
[time=796] Reserve seating and general admission tickets, all of that can be purchased at our website at blackhockministries.org.
[time=802] You can also just come by in person anytime during the week to our North Campus main reception area from 9 to 4 throughout the week.
[time=810] We've got folks on duty. They'd love to put some tickets in your hands. Thank you so very much for tuning in week after week.
[time=817] Thanks for being a part of our family. And just know that as family we would love to have you with us.
[time=823] Here at Christmas with BlackHock we look forward to it and hope to see you soon.
[time=853] Peace for you, for that so true. I surrender to you, my life.
[time=873] I live with my love, I live with my heart.
[time=884] The touch, the love, the grace to me is deep.
[time=900] The land of soul can see, my power was in change.
[time=916] When I follow out your name, my life.
[time=925] I live with my love, I live with my heart.
[time=960] I surrender to you, my life, my life, my life, my life.
[time=979] And when this world has gone to end,
[time=998] the pain that dies with you begins will die.
[time=1013] You'll say that I see your face.
[time=1023] I live with my love, I live with my heart.
[time=1037] I spend the race with just one touch on you.
[time=1048] I call for me, my faith has changed.
[time=1054] Your God has saved you, oh yeah, so true, so true.
[time=1067] I surrender to you, oh yeah, so true, so true.
[time=1092] I surrender to you, my life, my life, my love, my life.
[time=1109] Jesus, you are my love, my love, my life, my love.
[time=1139] Well since I was with you last, my wife had a baby.
[time=1147] Thank you, thank you, I did all I could do.
[time=1153] Oh there she is, that's Haley Joy, she was nine pounds four ounces.
[time=1158] We found out at her two week checkup that she broke her collar bone.
[time=1161] I guess you can't know that and delivery until the knot formed.
[time=1165] And so we wondered why she was irritable and we found out why.
[time=1168] She's just been a Joy, Haley Joy, except I haven't had much sleep.
[time=1173] So today you'd have a free pass to sleep during my sermon because I might sleep during my sermon.
[time=1181] Thank you for everything.
[time=1182] Kelly was so funny when he came, he had his cell phone, he blew right past Susan's mom,
[time=1188] he got in there, I mean the baby had just come out and there was Kelly.
[time=1192] Hey, you know, what's your name?
[time=1195] I said well, I'm trying to take in one last effort here.
[time=1199] Susan's laying there and bed watching all this, I'm taking one, nurses are watching, doctors laughing.
[time=1204] I'm making one last effort for Zoey.
[time=1206] I want to name her Zoey because in the Greek Zoey means life, it's in one word, it's like grace.
[time=1211] It defines what we're all about, what a relationship with Christ is spiritual, eternal and abundant life.
[time=1215] And he goes oh, he gets his phone out.
[time=1218] Okay, they just had her, nine pounds, four ounces, yeah get the email going.
[time=1222] Well wait a minute, I might know that.
[time=1224] Well what are you going to name her?
[time=1225] And I said well if they want Haley Joy, every girl wants Haley, you know, in the family.
[time=1230] I got three girls, I got four girls now, four son-in-laws to pick out.
[time=1233] And I said but I'm, I'm trying to go to Zoey, hold on, is Zoey because of that Greek thing?
[time=1238] This is Kelly, Zoey because of that Greek thing you're always talking about?
[time=1241] I go yeah, yeah he's trying to do Zoey again.
[time=1245] Mitch everybody at church is saying go with Haley.
[time=1248] I go alright, it's Haley Joy, hang out, it's Haley Joy, I'm not kidding you two minutes later, pull that deal out, it's Marty Kate and Marty's wife is Joy.
[time=1258] Marty says hey Mitch just want to congratulate you and Joy wanted to say thank you for naming her after her.
[time=1263] I go how do you know?
[time=1265] Black hawking email man, so it really really was fun.
[time=1271] Oh boy, now to the sermon.
[time=1273] Welcome to the series on first Thessalonians.
[time=1276] Today we are going to get into first Thessalonians.
[time=1280] So please open up your Bibles and turn to Acts 17, no I'm just joking, I'm just joking.
[time=1285] You know one of the most interesting time periods in history is the time period between the old and the New Testament.
[time=1294] And what's so interesting about it to me is the Greek influence.
[time=1300] A guy by the name of Alexander the Great in the 300's BC came onto the scene and wanted to conquer the whole world
[time=1307] and release this Greek culture, this great way of life, this great philosophy, this thinking of breaking things down, breaking things down.
[time=1315] And he wanted that to be everywhere.
[time=1317] And a story goes like this and I got to thinking after first service, I wonder if Paul heard this story because this was probably told down through the ages.
[time=1325] And a few hundred years before Christ and some of you have heard this before, Alexander the Great, they're out in the battlefields
[time=1334] and they're at a time there where he's got a group around him and they bring to him a deserter, a guy who didn't want to fight.
[time=1342] And they bring him to Alexander the Great and he's standing, Alexander the Great standing there and the timid soldier standing there had been caught deserting, not wanting to fight.
[time=1351] Alexander the Great said soldier, what's your name?
[time=1357] And he whispers, soldier, what's your name?
[time=1365] Alexander, sir.
[time=1368] What?
[time=1370] Alexander, sir.
[time=1373] And Alexander the Great replied soldier, change your conduct, or change your name.
[time=1383] And today, church, Christian, we're going to see three hallmarks that Paul writes about a fully surrendered life in communion with Christ, about a fully surrendered community in Christ, and about a fully surrendered celebratory life in our culture in Christ.
[time=1409] And he gives us those three names, their faith, love, and hope.
[time=1415] And for each one there's a conduct.
[time=1418] For faith, it's work.
[time=1422] For love, it's labor.
[time=1426] And for hope, it's endurance.
[time=1432] And so today I just want to examine ourselves individually and as a community of believers.
[time=1440] Do those names that we use to kind of flippantly describe ourselves?
[time=1446] Are they followed in our lives by those three conducts?
[time=1449] And so if you want to open your Bibles and turn to 1 Thessalonians 1, we're going to go through the first three verses today.
[time=1455] And I wrote down a couple weeks ago as Kelly was talking about how Paul had changed.
[time=1461] And I wrote down these things.
[time=1463] You know, Paul's name, there was a change.
[time=1465] He kind of went from using the Hebrew version to the writer, start using the Greek version.
[time=1469] Saul in Hebrew means ask for Paul in Greek.
[time=1472] It's interesting.
[time=1473] It means little.
[time=1474] Not only his name changed, his position in Christ changed.
[time=1477] He went from out to in.
[time=1480] I wrote that his relationship to the church changed.
[time=1482] He went from persecutor to promoter.
[time=1485] His heart changed.
[time=1486] It changed from hard to soft.
[time=1489] His hands changed from clenched fists ready to pick a fight to open hands bearing gifts.
[time=1495] His perspective of others changed from a condemnation judgmental grid to a merciful grid.
[time=1501] His theology changed from religion to relationship.
[time=1506] The eyes of his heart he writes changed from being closed to being open.
[time=1513] The way he would make himself right with God changed.
[time=1515] He wouldn't do it earned through a pursuit of the law, but it would now be unearned by grace through faith in Christ.
[time=1522] And most importantly, his spiritual vital signs changed from dead man walking to alive, to life in the Greek Zoe.
[time=1535] And so we need to ask faith, love, hope.
[time=1541] Work, labor, endurance.
[time=1545] Is that me?
[time=1546] Is that us?
[time=1548] Is my heart changing?
[time=1551] So let me just kind of give you the setting of Thessalonica.
[time=1555] We're going to have some pictures come up here.
[time=1557] Thessalonica actually was named after Alexander the Great's half-sister.
[time=1562] A general Cassandra who was married to her came and conquered the city and named it after his wife, Philip of Macedon's daughter.
[time=1573] And he eventually, General Cassandra eventually became king.
[time=1577] You know, this Alexander the Great thinks so interesting because he's probably prophesied in Daniel where it talks about a great kingdom conquering the world.
[time=1584] And then it's divided into four quadrants after his death.
[time=1587] That's what happened with Alexander the Great.
[time=1589] In fact, Alexander the Great met with the Jewish leaders and they showed him that prophecy and he was kind to them because of it.
[time=1599] So it's really interesting.
[time=1600] So it's named after his half-sister.
[time=1602] In 146 BC, it became the capital of Macedonia.
[time=1605] And in 42 PC, it became a free city.
[time=1608] It was governed by its own local politicians.
[time=1612] And we see that in Acts 17 when Paul goes there.
[time=1615] And about 50 to 52 AD, Paul visited with Silas and Timothy, Thessalonica, and he planted a local church.
[time=1623] And I want you to start thinking about, well, what did he plant?
[time=1625] What was it?
[time=1626] It was on his second missionary journey.
[time=1628] There are some similarities to Fort Wayne and Thessalonica.
[time=1631] Thessalonica's population then was 200,000 people.
[time=1635] Fort Wayne, about 200,000 people.
[time=1638] It was on a harbor that flowed from the thermic Gulf off the Aegean Sea.
[time=1647] Well, we got the Three Rivers.
[time=1650] It was on the Ignatian Way, which was this huge highway that united all of Rome from east to west.
[time=1656] Rome was about the size of the continental United States.
[time=1659] And it also had many north-south arteries going through it.
[time=1662] So it was kind of like what they call us.
[time=1664] The crossroads of America was like a crossroads of Rome.
[time=1669] And as I mentioned, their economy was free trade.
[time=1671] There was no Roman garrison.
[time=1672] There was no Roman military presence.
[time=1675] And they minted their own coins.
[time=1677] And I want you to get this.
[time=1678] They would mint their own coins and put Caesar on it and have an inscription that he was God.
[time=1684] They thought Caesar was divine.
[time=1686] That was the religion that was kind of part of the day.
[time=1689] And the number one cult of Thessalonica was called "Cabria." C-A-B-R-I-U-S-C-A-B-R-I-U-S-Cabria.
[time=1697] It was a chief cult of the city, and it was promoted by the wealthy and the ruling to ensure their power.
[time=1704] Kind of like America.
[time=1705] The great American dream gone awry is it's all about wealth.
[time=1709] It's all about power.
[time=1710] And so Cabria was this cult.
[time=1713] It was a problem.
[time=1715] And see, Rome prohibited new religions.
[time=1718] As long as Christianity was tied with Judaism, it was fine.
[time=1721] We know that there was a synagogue in Thessalonica by Acts 17.
[time=1724] But it's when it began to be seen as separate as where it got to be seen as unacceptable by the Roman leadership.
[time=1733] And when an army would conquer a city, they'd level it.
[time=1738] And then they'd build on top of it.
[time=1740] So underneath modern day Thessalonica is the remains of the city we're talking about.
[time=1747] Thessalonica has about a million people living there.
[time=1749] It's the second largest city in Greece.
[time=1751] But there have been some archaeological discoveries that prove that everything we're seeing here in the Bible is true.
[time=1757] And that's the point I want you to know.
[time=1759] Paul writes his letter about 50 to 52 AD is the date.
[time=1762] He writes it from Corinth.
[time=1764] And the purpose is to encourage the people in Thessalonica and encourage you in me today is what we can get from it.
[time=1770] Because they were panicked about the second coming of Christ.
[time=1774] Where is he?
[time=1775] What happened to all these people who died?
[time=1776] What's going on?
[time=1778] And even it says in the text, many stopped working.
[time=1782] Many stopped working.
[time=1784] It's because they were afraid.
[time=1786] They didn't know what was going on.
[time=1788] And so the whole purpose of the southerners would be red in that light.
[time=1792] And every letter Paul writes and every letter written in the Greek culture followed in a specific outline.
[time=1798] I'm going to give it to you now.
[time=1799] And Paul tweaks that to kind of reclaim it for Christ.
[time=1803] But the first part is the opening and that's verse one.
[time=1806] It's the opening.
[time=1807] The second part is the Thanksgiving section.
[time=1810] And that's probably verses two through ten.
[time=1812] And that's where Paul says I'm thankful for this.
[time=1815] And that's where you find Bible scholars say the greatest clues, and I think so too, on what a letter is about.
[time=1821] So you have the opening, you have the Thanksgiving, then you have the body.
[time=1824] And then you have this section called perinesis.
[time=1826] It's advice.
[time=1827] It means advice.
[time=1828] It means I'm going to tell you all these theological truths, but then I'm going to tell you how to practically put it into your lives.
[time=1834] And then finally there's a closing.
[time=1836] So opening, Thanksgiving, body, perinesis, which means advice and closing.
[time=1841] First Thessalonians is divided into the first sections through the body would be belief.
[time=1847] That's chapters one through three.
[time=1848] Paul didn't write it with chapters and verses that happened in the 1200s with Archbishop Stephen Langton of Canterbury.
[time=1856] He did that.
[time=1857] So Paul just wrote it as a letter.
[time=1859] And the perinesis into the closing is behavior and it's chapters four through five.
[time=1866] So chapters one through three, belief, chapters four through five, behavior.
[time=1871] Now there were problems.
[time=1872] So people had quit working.
[time=1873] They were evidently by the text, which we'll get to.
[time=1875] There were some sexual problems.
[time=1877] And then we had that cult problem, "Cabrious." So that's why he's writing.
[time=1880] And let's just read it here real quick.
[time=1883] Paul, Silas, and Timothy, the three guys who planted the church, to the church of the Thessalonians
[time=1890] in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, grace and peace to you.
[time=1894] We're going to talk about that.
[time=1896] We always thank God for all of you mentioning you in our prayers.
[time=1899] We continue to remember before our God and Father, your hallmark number one of a fully-stranded church work produced by faith.
[time=1911] The hallmark is faith.
[time=1912] The conduct is work.
[time=1914] Your labor prompted by love.
[time=1916] The hallmark is love.
[time=1917] The conduct is labor.
[time=1919] And your endurance inspired by hope.
[time=1923] The hallmark is hope.
[time=1924] The name is hope.
[time=1925] The conduct is endurance.
[time=1927] In our Lord Jesus Christ, very important phrase.
[time=1930] The weight is put on faith, hope and love in the original Greek.
[time=1936] The weight is on there.
[time=1937] Silas was a leader in the Jerusalem church.
[time=1939] He was a Roman citizen.
[time=1940] He was one of our first career missionaries.
[time=1942] We know that he helped Peter and he was a writing secretary for Paul.
[time=1945] Timothy means God-honor.
[time=1947] His mother and grandmother were believers and became Christians.
[time=1950] They were Jewish.
[time=1951] Who became Christians.
[time=1952] His father was Greek.
[time=1953] And Paul led him to Christ.
[time=1954] And Timothy became the pastor of the church of Ephesus.
[time=1957] And we know that he struggled with timidity and being youthful.
[time=1961] Paul writes in 2 Timothy 1, 7.
[time=1963] God didn't give us a spirit of timidity.
[time=1965] But one of power, one of love.
[time=1967] And he writes in 1 Timothy 4, 12.
[time=1969] Don't let people look down on you, Timothy, 'cause you're young.
[time=1972] So we know that Timothy was struggling with these things.
[time=1975] And here is what Paul writes about Timothy.
[time=1977] If you want to write it down, Philippians 2, 20 through 22.
[time=1981] Paul says this about Timothy.
[time=1982] "I have no one else like him who takes a genuine interest in your welfare.
[time=1985] For everyone looks out for his own interest.
[time=1987] But look what Timothy was like.
[time=1988] Not those of Jesus Christ.
[time=1989] That must have been what Timothy did.
[time=1991] Looked out for the interest of Jesus Christ.
[time=1993] But you know that Timothy has proved himself because as a son with him, because as a son with his father, he has served with me in the work of the gospel.
[time=2001] And so Paul says this letter's from us and it's to the church of the Thessalonians and God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2009] And this is what he planted.
[time=2011] He planted a movement of people in Christ.
[time=2016] In Christ, 172 times.
[time=2020] Paul describes the Christian life in his letters as in Christ.
[time=2025] The church, Echolicea, are those who are called.
[time=2029] Those who respond to that call to be in Christ.
[time=2034] Now that makes it quite different than what we have today.
[time=2037] We look at the church today as a building.
[time=2039] Well, they met in house churches about 22 a house and they'd pass Paul's letter around
[time=2045] and they'd read it its entirety when they were in worship together.
[time=2049] So we miss a lot here the way we handle the text.
[time=2053] It would be great to read the text in its entirety in our time of worship.
[time=2057] That's what they did and they'd pass it along.
[time=2060] And so they didn't meet, you know, they weren't these great assemblies probably, but they were meeting in house churches and they faced great persecution.
[time=2067] And Paul talks about in Christ.
[time=2072] Now if that's the case, it's a 24/7 deal.
[time=2075] Wherever I go, I am in Christ and I'm the church because the church is believers.
[time=2081] Wherever I go, in my work, in my house, in my car, wherever I go.
[time=2089] Paul even writes in 1 Corinthians 6, you go into sin and you have sex with someone you shouldn't have sex with, you just took Jesus Christ there.
[time=2097] And you and I should not take that lightly.
[time=2101] In Christ, in God the Father.
[time=2105] You know, all these things that we call the church today, the building, the steeple, the pews, the stained glass, all rooted in pagan religions.
[time=2115] That's right. In 312 AD, when Constantine decided that Rome was all going to be Christian without one conversion, he said, "We're all going to be Christian because I am." He looked across the street and he saw what all the pagan religions were doing.
[time=2128] They had stained glass, they had pews, they had pulpits, they had steeple.
[time=2131] They had all that kind of thing and said, "Well, let's do that.
[time=2133] And let's start building churches as buildings." But it's not it. It's not Jesus' idea of the church. That's not Paul's idea of the church.
[time=2141] I don't think it's God's idea of the church. You look back in 1 Samuel 8 and God didn't even want to give him a king. It was called Theocresia, Theocracy, God rules.
[time=2149] And God wanted to be their king and he says, "You know what?
[time=2152] They've rejected me as their king." And all God's ever wanted is a people to be in love with him and worship him with faith, love, and hope.
[time=2162] And the church is a 24/7 deal in Christ 24/7.
[time=2168] In fact, Jesus said it this way. I think he was probably hitting his chest.
[time=2171] He says, "Tear this temple down, this body. Crucify this if you want.
[time=2176] I'll raise it back up in three days. You are the temple of the Holy Spirit if you are in Christ.
[time=2180] You carry Christ to every conversation, to every encounter, and every encounter becomes a divine appointment 24/7.
[time=2189] And because of in Christ, that's where we find grace and peace.
[time=2193] And Paul takes an ordinarily cliche-ish greeting that's in all kinds of writings and he reclaims it for Christ. He takes grace and he changes two words.
[time=2202] He takes grace and peace, which kind of meant like blessings and prosperity.
[time=2206] Changes two words, two letters rather, in the word grace.
[time=2210] And now it means what you and I call grace and the readers know it.
[time=2213] It means undeserved love, unmerited favor, Christ in you.
[time=2217] And then he says peace, grace and peace, grace always precedes peace.
[time=2222] I ask a friend of mine that one time, why he thought that was the case?
[time=2226] He says, "Because you can't experience God's peace until you've experienced God's grace." And you'll never find that unless you're in Christ, never.
[time=2236] And so what about peace? You know, grace, I think, 7 Corinthians 8, 9, if you want to write it down.
[time=2242] I think it's the greatest picture of grace.
[time=2244] You can just remember it as an acronym, God's riches at Christ's expense.
[time=2249] God's riches at Christ's expense.
[time=2252] And grace, 2 Corinthians 8, 9, Paul writes that this is the grace of God,
[time=2258] that Jesus, so he was rich, became poor for our sakes.
[time=2263] So that in his poverty, we might become rich.
[time=2266] Atonement of another, that's grace.
[time=2269] And so peace, and the Bible scholars say that peace is the theme of Paul's writings, reconciliation or peace. And we see it in three ways.
[time=2279] Peace within my soul, peace with God, peace with others.
[time=2291] All sin is judged at the cross of Jesus Christ.
[time=2294] God and man are reconciled, and man to man need to live that out in reconciliation.
[time=2300] Jew and Greek, slave and free, man and woman, all because we have peace in Christ with God.
[time=2315] And then I have peace in my soul.
[time=2317] Paul writes in Philippians 4, 6 and 7, that don't worry, don't be anxious, don't have a divided mind,
[time=2325] don't have one foot trusting yourself and one foot trusting God and be worried about anything, but in everything, in prayer, in petition, submit a request to God, and the peace that passes all understanding will guard your heart.
[time=2339] That's peace. Paul writes that Jesus is our peace in Ephesians 2, 14.
[time=2349] He calls God the God of peace for Caesalonians 5, 23, peace with God.
[time=2358] He even calls it the Gospel of peace, Ephesians 6, 15, peace, the theme of Paul's writings,
[time=2364] and it means something. Paul writes Romans 12, 18, as far as it depends on you and me, be at peace with all men.
[time=2371] And Paul says I thank you. This is really interesting to me and I'll tell you why.
[time=2375] We always thank God for all of you mentioning you in our prayers.
[time=2378] Well, I got to thinking, do I thank God for people when I pray?
[time=2382] When I pray with my girls and we go to bed, do I thank God for people?
[time=2386] And I realize that the way I pray is I'm kind of telling God to do things for people.
[time=2392] And so I'm really, I'm convicted by this, I'm going to try to pray and model with my girls.
[time=2398] I want to ask you to do the same to thank God for people.
[time=2403] I have a tendency, if I can remember and go through, I'm not perfect at this, but I go through Blackhawk and I go through people that I'm involved with and people in the buildings and people on staff, and I pray for them and their families.
[time=2414] But again, it's a be with, do this kind of a thing, and I'm going to start thanking God for them.
[time=2419] And I think some changes in my heart might occur, and I encourage you to do the same thing.
[time=2425] Prayer, prosuque, pro means from, suque from the soul.
[time=2429] Prayer is my heart, my soul connecting with the very heart and the very soul of God.
[time=2435] And you know, it's tough for me to do this, but I'm going to challenge you to do it.
[time=2439] Would you consider men praying audibly with your wife every night?
[time=2444] I've only done it for seasons at a time, and I'm ashamed to say it.
[time=2447] I don't have a problem if I'm at an auction and it's broadcast live on ESPN 2 to 50, 60 million people.
[time=2453] No big deal to me, I kind of like that.
[time=2455] Pray audibly with my wife, ooh, scary.
[time=2459] I don't know why, but I'm going to try to do that.
[time=2463] Thanking God for all his blessings.
[time=2465] I have no problem praying audibly with my kids.
[time=2467] You know what, I didn't want to do it, but even prayed with my employees.
[time=2470] I was afraid they wouldn't do it.
[time=2472] Amazing what happened, just amazing.
[time=2475] It was that first step that was the hardest, I was afraid to do it.
[time=2478] Fear kept me from it.
[time=2479] I actually prayed with customers about auctions that we were having for them about maybe it
[time=2486] was in a state or maybe it was a guy's life savings or something.
[time=2489] And I got to tell you, it's amazing what happened.
[time=2492] The only reason I don't do it is fear.
[time=2495] So I encourage you, would you do that?
[time=2497] Would you torch up prayer in your life?
[time=2499] Your soul connecting with God's soul.
[time=2502] And here's the three hallmarks and here's the three conducts.
[time=2505] And it's faith, work produced by faith, labor prompted by love, endurance inspired by hope.
[time=2512] In our Lord Jesus Christ, you'll only find them in Christ.
[time=2516] In fact, let's read Romans 5, 1 through 5.
[time=2519] I think it's coming on the screens.
[time=2521] This kind of sums the whole deal up, connects it all together.
[time=2525] Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace through God, our Lord Jesus Christ, in whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand.
[time=2535] See, we're there.
[time=2536] And we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God.
[time=2539] Glory is a revelation of God's character and presence.
[time=2542] And we rejoice in Christ because that's where we see it.
[time=2545] Remember, it's one of my favorite verses in the face of Jesus Christ.
[time=2548] It's the glory of God.
[time=2549] Verse 3, not only so, but we also rejoice in our sufferings.
[time=2552] That's interesting.
[time=2553] I'm going to be joyful in my sufferings in my endurance because we know that suffering
[time=2559] produces perseverance, perseverance character, and character hope.
[time=2564] Not wishful thinking, but confident assurance.
[time=2567] And hope does not disappoint us because God has poured out His love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit whom He has given us.
[time=2574] Faith, hope, love.
[time=2576] Work, labor, endurance.
[time=2578] If you want to take work, labor, endurance, and summon up in one word, serve.
[time=2584] Serve.
[time=2585] Our response and ours to the initiative of the grace and peace of Christ.
[time=2589] This is, by the way, verse 3 is the vision of our church.
[time=2592] Our response is faith, love, and hope.
[time=2597] Faith.
[time=2598] Let's look at that first.
[time=2599] Acronym, if you want it.
[time=2601] Forshaking all, I trust Him.
[time=2603] If you want to write it down, faith can be an acronym.
[time=2605] Forshaking all, I trust Him.
[time=2607] Illustration.
[time=2608] You walked in today.
[time=2609] I've shared this with kids a lot.
[time=2611] You walked in today.
[time=2612] I watched you.
[time=2613] You walked down the aisle.
[time=2614] and boom, sat in your pew. Nobody did this. You know, nobody did that. That's faith. Everybody has faith. The question is the object of our faith. All right? You have faith, trust, that the floor will hold your weight and that the pew will hold your weight.
[time=2638] The great theologian says it this way, that it's my belief in my mind. That's what most people think, believe in faith. They're the same word in Greek. That's what most people in our culture treat it as.
[time=2652] Well, yeah, I believe that Jesus died on a cross resurrect from the dead. Yeah, I got that life insurance. See you. No, no, no, no, no.
[time=2659] That's just a mental ascent. So it's not just my mind. It's my emotional conviction. Like, I believe that pew is there and a story. That's mental ascent.
[time=2667] But there's an emotional conviction. You know, I really believe, I would go tell people that there's a pew right there. But the third part is trust until I sit in the pew.
[time=2678] Until I, as Paul just said in Romans 5, stand in the grace of God. Until I am in Christ, until I trust Christ with all of my life, full surrender, 24/7, I have not experienced the faith that he's talked about.
[time=2690] And we know that God is the source of this faith. Jesus Christ, Hebrews 12, 1, 2, and 3, it talks about that he is the author and perfecter of our faith.
[time=2700] Hebrews 11, 1 gives a great definition for it. The substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen, it goes on to verse 6 to say without faith.
[time=2710] But we just talked about it. It is impossible to please God.
[time=2715] God is faithful. He gets Moses on the mountain, Exodus 34, 6, and he describes himself in one of the words he uses. He says, I'm faithful.
[time=2723] God is faithful. He's the source. And because of that, because you're in Christ, then your faith and your trust will result in work.
[time=2730] The writers of Scripture know nothing about a life of saying, I believe that, but I'm going to maintain control of my own life.
[time=2737] That it's so far from the truth in Scripture, it's pathetic, and anyone who preaches it should not preach it, because what I do in Christ, who I am in Christ, results in behavior.
[time=2750] Faith without works is dead, James writes. It's about a full surrender of all of my life work in the Greek ergontics where we get ergonomics.
[time=2761] Paul writes in Ephesians 2, 8 through 10 that this is all a gift, salvation by grace through faith in Christ. In order to do the work, he's prepared you to do the good deeds of love.
[time=2771] You are God's workmanship, poem A. We are God's poem. He's writing on our hearts every single day.
[time=2778] And God works, Jesus said, my father's at work. And so should I.
[time=2784] Here's how Paul did it. Paul had a two-fold business plan on how I call it a business plan, on how he was going to communicate the gospel of Christ, who's a person of God to everybody. First he'd go to the synagogues.
[time=2797] He'd go to the synagogues, and they were open 24/7, by the way, that's really interesting. And he would preach there that Christ is a Messiah. We see that in Acts 17.
[time=2805] And many would believe. But then when things got a little rough, he was in Thessalonica for three Sabbas where he preached. He'd have to go out and he'd plan a church. What is it that he planted? Was it a building? Was it a pew? No.
[time=2820] It was Christ. In Christ. In Christ. And so you and I got to ask, does my faith, does my full surrender to him really result? Do am I really in communion with him? Does my life really show it? Or is it just something I want to believe?
[time=2838] But does my life really show it? Do I really read the Bible in communion with God? Do I pray? Ruth Graham says if you pray for less than five minutes, the only voice you'll hear is your own.
[time=2850] Now is that really in my characterizing known by those things? And finally he talks about love. The hallmark of full surrender is love and its conduct is labor.
[time=2866] And here we see the community in Christ. Paul says in Galatians 5, 6, the only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love.
[time=2875] And here's where we see the second part of Paul's plan on how he's going to carry the gospel. He would go into urban centers or marketplaces where there were a lot of traffic, so the Ignatian Way, the north-south arteries, the harbor.
[time=2888] And he would preach in the marketplace and we found archeological discoveries of that marketplace where he preached. This is true.
[time=2895] And he says in 1 Thessalonians that I was there and we were doing it day and night in the marketplace.
[time=2903] He says that he was making tents there. You, your marketplace, my marketplace, outside this building, that's where it all happens.
[time=2914] 24/7 in Christ, labor of love because God is love. He is the source.
[time=2921] You know, I was, I took about 10 days to spend with Susan after we had the baby.
[time=2926] And talking to someone who's going to bring a meal over. I don't know if I told you this or not.
[time=2933] But I was complimented for staying with her for that time period. And I did that pretty much with all of our girls.
[time=2941] And I made this comment. I said, "Well, I've been feeling a little guilty about it."
[time=2948] And here's why. I felt, I had these thoughts. And maybe part of these, because I'm a guy.
[time=2954] But I thought, "Well, I should be doing something for the church. I should be doing something for Blackhawk." You know, I had these stack of books I was going to read. There were some things that were working on.
[time=2962] I said, "I should be doing this. I should be doing that." And I was staying in touch, but there were some things I kept thinking I should be doing.
[time=2967] Well, the bottom line is the church in Christ with my wife.
[time=2973] That's what God's called me to do. That's what God's called you to do.
[time=2976] We got to quit making it about a building or a program.
[time=2981] And she heard me say that I felt guilty about it. And she was in the room next door.
[time=2986] And I almost destroyed everything that I had done and said.
[time=2991] I mean, I'd cut my finger. I'd burnt my hand. I figured out how to get the dishwasher light that says "clean off."
[time=2997] You got to leave it open long enough to unload it before to go off in the past. I would just go bloop bloop bloop.
[time=3002] Just a little sidebar. I put together this stroller because I can't do anything.
[time=3007] And I thought, "I'd really show her. I'll come out with this stroller all put together." And so I was kind of hiding in a corner where she wouldn't see me come out in the foyer where she can see me.
[time=3016] She's going to run into me. I didn't say anything. She's just going to kind of like run into me.
[time=3019] She goes, "You put the stroller together." And I'm thinking, "I hope you never push her across the street where there's a lot of traffic."
[time=3025] And I go, "I am the smartest man alive." So we had a little moment there. I just wanted to tell you that.
[time=3032] Gustave Dore, an artist, was teaching. And he looked over the shoulder of the students who were painting Jesus.
[time=3040] And he looked at one particular painting. He goes, "The painting the student was a painting of Jesus."
[time=3049] And he said, "If you loved him more, you'd paint him better. If you loved him more, you'd paint him better.
[time=3060] Guys, if we love Christ more, we'd paint him better in community in Christ." 24/7, small groups, family, work, marketplace, community in Christ, and finally hope.
[time=3075] Hope is the fully surrendered hallmark. That's the name. Its conduct is endurance.
[time=3084] Tybello gave me the acronym, Last Christmas with Black Hawk Hope, helping others prepare for eternity.
[time=3092] Helping others prepare for eternity. And hope is contagious.
[time=3097] Paul writes that Jesus Christ is our hope for Timothy 1.1. Again, in Christ, Christ is a source.
[time=3104] Paul writes in Titus 2.13 that his return is our blessed hope. Christ's return is our blessed hope.
[time=3110] And endurance, Hoopomeno, flows from that. God is patient. Romans 2.4 says, Jesus is patient.
[time=3118] He endures Hebrews 12.1 through 3 says, "Patience is a gift from God." Paul writes.
[time=3124] And so we're called to be patient toward others celebrating our hope in Christ in the culture.
[time=3131] Faith, work, that's my communion in Christ. Love, labor, that's my community that you and me
[time=3139] to and I in Christ. Hope, that's the celebration in Christ in the culture because people need and want hope.
[time=3153] I use an analogy this way. Revelation says how this all ends.
[time=3160] So it's almost like you and I are on a team and we're in March Madness.
[time=3165] We're in the NCAA basketball tournament and we know that we're going to win the final four.
[time=3172] If that's the case, why would we ever get upset about a bad call?
[time=3180] God wins. We win. We need to endure. Peter writes in 1 Peter 4.14 that if you share Christ and you're rejected, you're blessed.
[time=3194] We need to celebrate the hope and endure in our culture of Christ.
[time=3200] And are we doing that as a community of believers?
[time=3203] Do we invite people to come and experience that hope just like Christmas with Blackhawk?
[time=3208] When the synagogue, when they met there, unbelievers came.
[time=3212] In the early church, 1 Corinthians 14, 24, 25, unbelievers came.
[time=3217] The politician writes, they used to hang around back and watch from afar for two years and then they decided to get in.
[time=3224] At Blackhawk, we invite seekers to come and to seek in a safe place.
[time=3230] But it doesn't have to happen here. It can happen in your home. It can happen in a car. It can happen in a restaurant.
[time=3236] It's a 24/7 deal in Christ.
[time=3242] Paul, his conversion is recorded three times in Acts.
[time=3249] And on the third time it's recorded in Acts 26, it's recorded that Jesus said to Paul, "Why are you kicking against the goats?"
[time=3258] A goat is what they used to stick. They used to prod and ox.
[time=3264] And I think what Jesus is saying to Paul is, "Why are you bucking the draw of the Holy Spirit?"
[time=3271] "Why are you bucking Christ? You were made to be in a relationship with me.
[time=3278] You were made for faith that works, communion in Christ. You were made for love that labors community in Christ.
[time=3288] You were made, Paul, for hope that endures celebration in Christ.
[time=3295] Why kick against the goats?" If you're here today and your life may not look so much like faith that works in communion.
[time=3303] Love that labors in community in Christ.
[time=3309] Hope that endures in celebration out in our culture in Christ so people are drawn.
[time=3315] Maybe it does. If it does give thanks.
[time=3319] But I invite you as Paul would write to examine yourself. I've asked Corbin to come up and say, "Great is thy faithfulness."
[time=3326] Because you've seen that in Christ Christ is the source of the faith, Christ is the source of the love, Christ is the source of his hope.
[time=3338] Paul writes in Romans 3, 3, and 4, "If my faith isn't so hot, does that nullify God's faithfulness?"
[time=3347] No. God is faithful. He tells Moses on the mountain, Jeremiah writes in Lamentations 3, "Great is thy faithfulness, O God."
[time=3357] So I just invite you as Corbin plays and sings to bow your heads.
[time=3362] To close your eyes and to ask God to speak to you.
[time=3370] Whether or not you're in Christ, I'd like you to deal with that if you don't know.
[time=3375] Faith, love, hope, work, labor, work means effort, labor means extra effort.
[time=3381] Kind of like I was doing on the stroller.
[time=3384] Hope that endures.
[time=3388] Change my conduct, O God.
[time=3392] Or I need to change my name.
[time=3396] Great is thy faithfulness, O God, my Father.
[time=3408] There is no shed of turning with me.
[time=3417] Thou changest, not thy compressions, they fail not.
[time=3426] As thou hast been, thou forever will be.
[time=3437] Parton for sin and the peace that endoreth.
[time=3446] There no deep presence to fear and to guide.
[time=3454] Strange for today and bright hope for tomorrow.
[time=3464] Blessings all mine with ten thousand beside.
[time=3475] You sing this with me.
[time=3478] Great is thy faithfulness.
[time=3487] Morning by morning, you mercies, I see.
[time=3495] All thy have needed, thy have no idea.
[time=3504] Great is thy faithfulness, Lord unto me.
[time=3515] And now, O God, in Christ where we can only find the grace and the peace that you have for
[time=3523] us by responding in communion with you in a faith that works, in community with others,
[time=3530] and a love that labors, and in a celebration in Christ with a hope that endures.
[time=3536] God bless us and reveal to us who you are this week and help us to carry your character
[time=3542] and presence to everyone in Jesus mighty name, and all God's people said.
[time=3547] [AMEN]
