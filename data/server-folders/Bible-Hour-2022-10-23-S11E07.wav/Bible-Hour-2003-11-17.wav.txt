[time=377] (audience applauds) - Let me just remind you, if I can, let me just take a minute here.
[time=386] Stage light is gonna come and present this to you in a very, very powerful way, but I want it to this morning just remind you of what an amazing God we serve.
[time=399] And I mean that.
[time=400] Sometimes we just need to be reminded of what an amazing God, what an awesome God we serve.
[time=409] Your God, if you know Him today, this God that loved you so much that He sent His Son, is a God whose character and whose attributes, whose might and whose power and whose awesome majesty is, like beyond what you and I can't even imagine.
[time=431] And sometimes it is so much that we just kind of give up on the effort, but this morning I want to encourage you to just do your best mentally and emotionally to be reminded of this great God that we serve.
[time=444] It says in Isaiah, who?
[time=446] Isaiah says, who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand?
[time=451] The hollow of His hand, we've talked about that before.
[time=457] That's just this right here.
[time=460] All the waters in all the world, everywhere, right here.
[time=465] Who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand
[time=474] and marked off the heavens by the span?
[time=478] The span would have been in that day, the length between the thumb and forefinger extended, the heavens, all the galaxies, all the stars, all of space, marked off as it were, right there.
[time=495] That's your God.
[time=499] If you know Him today, this God that we love and serve, an amazing and mighty God, and calculated the dust of the earth by the measure and weighed the mountains in a balance and the hills in a pair of scales.
[time=518] Who has directed the Spirit of the Lord?
[time=520] With whom did He consult?
[time=523] And who gave Him understanding?
[time=524] And who taught Him in the path of justice and taught Him knowledge and informed Him the way of understanding?
[time=532] Answer.
[time=533] Nobody.
[time=535] 'Cause there is none like Him.
[time=539] Isaiah goes on to say in verse 18 to whom then will you liken God?
[time=546] To whom then will you liken God?
[time=548] This great, great God of ours.
[time=553] Father, we come before you this morning and we are a people that sometimes struggle to understand you and all that comes with you and all that you are.
[time=564] But God, this morning as we, with your help, as we try,
[time=570] as we open our minds and our hearts again to the vastness and the majesty and the awesomeness and the greatness of you, Father, humble us.
[time=580] Remind us of who you are and what a privilege it is to live with and walk with a God like you in your son's name we pray.
[time=592] [AMEN] In the beginning was the word
[time=600] and the word was with God and the word was God.
[time=603] In the beginning.
[time=604] Through Him all things were made.
[time=606] Without Him nothing was made that had been made.
[time=608] Now the earth was empty.
[time=610] Darkness was over the surface of the deep and the spirit of the Lord was hovering over the waters.
[time=614] In the beginning.
[time=615] The very beginning.
[time=616] God created the heavens and the earth.
[time=618] And the Creator said, "Let there be light." And there was light.
[time=623] And God saw that the light was good and separated the light from the darkness.
[time=628] And God called the light day and the darkness He called night.
[time=632] God said.
[time=633] And it was so.
[time=634] And there was evening and there was morning.
[time=636] The first day.
[time=637] Then God said.
[time=643] And it was so.
[time=644] And the master creator saw that it was good.
[time=647] God also made the stars and the beasts of the land.
[time=650] Orangutan.
[time=651] Hippopotamus.
[time=652] Platypus.
[time=652] And the fish of the sea.
[time=653] Whales.
[time=654] Dolphins.
[time=655] Mahimahi.
[time=656] And the birds of the air.
[time=657] Pelican.
[time=658] Evans.
[time=659] Eagles.
[time=660] The Creator separated the sky from the land and the land from the sea.
[time=664] And God saw that it was good.
[time=667] And there was evening and there was morning.
[time=669] The third day.
[time=670] The fourth day.
[time=671] The fifth day.
[time=673] Then God said.
[time=675] I am lonely.
[time=676] Let me make.
[time=677] Let me create life.
[time=678] Man.
[time=679] Woman.
[time=679] In my image.
[time=681] I am God's creation.
[time=682] You.
[time=683] Me.
[time=684] We are God's creation.
[time=686] They were made in my likeness.
[time=688] I am the handiwork of God.
[time=691] And let them rule over the fish.
[time=692] Whales.
[time=693] Dolphins.
[time=694] Mahimahi.
[time=695] In God's image, I was made.
[time=697] Rule over the birds.
[time=698] Pelicans.
[time=699] Ravens.
[time=700] Eagles.
[time=701] What can I do?
[time=702] Rule over all the earth.
[time=704] I can do all things through God, my Creator.
[time=707] And God created man in his image and woman in his image.
[time=710] God created me.
[time=712] The sixth day.
[time=713] You.
[time=714] In his image.
[time=715] By the seventh day, God finished the work.
[time=718] The masterpiece was complete.
[time=720] In my Creator's likeness, I was made.
[time=723] What can I do?
[time=725] So on the seventh day, the Creator rested from all his work.
[time=728] I can do all things through him who strengthens me.
[time=731] Who created me.
[time=732] And God blessed the seventh day.
[time=733] I bless you.
[time=734] The seventh day was made holy.
[time=735] You are holy.
[time=736] The work of creation was done.
[time=738] The Creator's work was done.
[time=741] Mine is beginning.
[time=742] His creation was complete.
[time=744] Mine is beginning.
[time=745] Seven days.
[time=746] Because I was created in God's image.
[time=748] And he rested.
[time=750] I am the handiwork of God.
[time=752] My Creator.
[time=799] Mine is beginning when I serve Him.
[time=804] My Creator.
[time=993] To listen to what the Holy Spirit might have you to do.
[time=996] The Word of God talks about a lot of different positions or postures of worshiping Him.
[time=1002] It talks about standing in His presence.
[time=1004] It talks about kneeling in His presence or lying on the ground in the presence of the Lord.
[time=1010] One day will all be in that position.
[time=1013] And this morning I want you to ask the Holy Spirit what He might want you to do.
[time=1017] Whether it's to stand in honor of Him or to sit in contemplation of who He is.
[time=1023] Maybe with your head bowed and your eyes closed.
[time=1027] Or if your hands lifted up to Him.
[time=1030] And just feel free as we sing the rest of this song to express yourself in a personal way to your Creator.
[time=1043] The Holy Spirit.
[time=1066] So amazing.
[time=1071] So divine.
[time=1076] Demon's eyes hold.
[time=1080] My light.
[time=1082] My heart.
[time=1087] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[time=1098] It's me, my light.
[time=1101] My light.
[time=1104] My true meaning.
[time=1137] [MUSIC - 32 seconds]
[time=1174] Let's pray together.
[time=1182] Father, when we think about the cross and we think about all that you did, we can't help but express to you gratefulness and thankfulness and praise and honor and glory and power, might and majesty.
[time=1202] You are truly amazing God.
[time=1206] And we say hallelujah together this morning.
[time=1209] Your word says that we are crucified with Christ.
[time=1216] Those of us who believe are crucified with Him and we no longer live, but it's you that lives in us.
[time=1224] And your word also says that every good and perfect gift comes from above, from the Father of lights.
[time=1231] And so God, we acknowledge this morning that anything good and anything perfect that others see in us or we observe in ourselves, it comes from you, we're crucified.
[time=1244] And if we were left to our own, we would mess things up.
[time=1248] But we thank you for your spirit and for your blood that cleanses us and for Christ who lives within us.
[time=1255] We call Him brother and call Him friend.
[time=1257] [MUSIC - 266 seconds]
[time=1528] This is the next section of scripture.
[time=1531] And you have to know and understand about him being Lord
[time=1537] to really understanding about him being savior.
[time=1542] If you don't really understand the reality that he's Lord of all, and all are going to be judged by him,
[time=1554] you can't really grasp him having chosen you to be saved from the wrath that's coming, to be saved from separation from him for the rest of eternity.
[time=1568] If you really don't get it, that that's the reality, you can't really grasp the savior part of that.
[time=1576] And then in addition to that, on the other side of our salvation, he's still Lord and he works through us.
[time=1587] His spirit empowers us to then respond to our salvation as a fully surrendered person that he uses as a light to a really dark world.
[time=1601] And he uses as a collective in a local body as a light to a community in a whole world.
[time=1607] Oh, I like being a part of that.
[time=1613] That gives meaning to all of this.
[time=1615] Without him, none of it has meaning.
[time=1619] And you know what?
[time=1622] There's a real tension.
[time=1623] When you hear what we heard last week about him choosing us
[time=1630] and then you read through the scriptures and you see sections here about are doing our part.
[time=1634] You go, okay, he chose me, he elected me.
[time=1637] How's that go together with me now, living out my salvation, working it out, in sphere and trembling, the Bible says.
[time=1645] Knowing he's Lord.
[time=1646] How does that really work with me doing what he's called me to do, the doing part?
[time=1651] If he's done the saving part, and that's all there is to it, how in the world do I respond when I read passages like this that spell out how the Thessalonians responded to him in a fully surrendered capacity to the Lord of all?
[time=1670] The bottom line is what we believe.
[time=1672] Those of us here at this church who are sitting together trying to talk through, how's that work out together?
[time=1678] What we believe is this.
[time=1680] That we live in tension, knowing that both those things are really true.
[time=1684] J.I. Packer calls them friends.
[time=1687] Kelly read this list to me this week.
[time=1689] It's a whole list about election.
[time=1692] And a whole list about our free will and our part in the salvation process.
[time=1696] And there's a tension that comes with that.
[time=1699] And Packer says, don't think of that as something negative.
[time=1703] Those are friends.
[time=1704] That's where we are.
[time=1707] But there is a tension there.
[time=1709] This week we're going to emphasize our response by looking at how the Thessalonians responded.
[time=1717] Romans chapter 15 is a great place to look when you think about the sanctification process that God has us in.
[time=1727] Let's go there first.
[time=1728] That's not going to be on the screen.
[time=1731] Romans chapter 15, verse 15.
[time=1734] Romans 15, 15.
[time=1738] Paul writing in the Romans, he says, I have written you quite boldly on some points as if to remind you of them again because of the grace God gave me to be a minister of Christ to the Gentiles with the priestly duty of proclaiming the gospel of God.
[time=1758] So that the Gentiles might become an offering acceptable to God, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
[time=1766] Don't misunderstand this.
[time=1770] The sanctification process happens in us by the power of the Spirit of God.
[time=1776] Our role is yielding to him.
[time=1785] He says we can become an offering acceptable to God.
[time=1790] Don't you want to do that?
[time=1794] The Thessalonians rang out throughout the world
[time=1801] as people who were doing that.
[time=1804] Let's look at how they did it.
[time=1805] I've been recently to Las Vegas.
[time=1813] You sent me there, by the way.
[time=1815] Thank you very much.
[time=1816] In June, the church in school gave Nancy and I a gift
[time=1824] for serving in the school for those years.
[time=1826] And the gift was a trip to Las Vegas during the world finals of the Professional Bull Riders Association.
[time=1835] And we couldn't have had more fun.
[time=1839] The seats were the best in the whole joint.
[time=1842] You really did well.
[time=1844] We were beside the CEO and jewel and other people like that.
[time=1848] And I loved it.
[time=1852] We had a blast.
[time=1853] One of the things that happened there was, it so happened there was a light heavyweight championship fight in our hotel.
[time=1861] The very weekend we were there, it was two weekends ago.
[time=1865] And after the fight and after the world finals at the bull riding event, everybody came back to that hotel because that hotel was hosting both.
[time=1874] And the crowd were cowboys, whole bunch of them, and fight people.
[time=1882] Whole bunch of them.
[time=1883] Man, you talk about a contrast in people.
[time=1888] We had a lot more fun watching them than we did going to bull riding event.
[time=1893] It was unbelievable.
[time=1895] The clothing, now the clothing was really different in the two camps.
[time=1901] But the clothing was still the same thing.
[time=1903] The clothing was making a statement about who they were, in both cases.
[time=1909] I mean, the boots were very, very expensive.
[time=1912] I know boots now 'cause I like 'em.
[time=1914] There were a lot of, and I see boots that were way too much money and I wanted 'em.
[time=1918] (audience laughs) The buckles were gold, the hats were the best.
[time=1924] And in both camps, women were dressed to reveal what they were trying to reveal.
[time=1933] Scary.
[time=1934] And I thought, you wanna find out what people look like who are conforming to the patterns of this world?
[time=1949] That's the place.
[time=1950] Now, I don't know all their hearts, so I'm not gonna judge what their motives were, but collectively, I'm telling ya, there was something going on there that was conforming to the patterns of this world.
[time=1961] Do you wanna be different from that?
[time=1966] You see, that's kind of the, there were a lot of those people that thought they were strutting their stuff because they were, they'd made it.
[time=1974] The Bible says we're to be transformed.
[time=1982] The Thessalonians were.
[time=1987] A fully surrendered church.
[time=1990] First of all, speaks a spirit-powered message.
[time=1993] Let's look at first Thessalonians chapter one.
[time=1997] We're gonna start with verse four.
[time=1998] That's what Kelly ended on last week.
[time=2000] Says, "For we know brothers loved by God "that he has chosen you.
[time=2006] "It was obvious to Paul that God had chosen "these brothers in Thessalonica." Why?
[time=2015] Because our gospel came to you not simply with words, but also with power, with the Holy Spirit, and with deep conviction.
[time=2022] First of all, he says, "The gospel came not just with words." Now, I want you to hear me on this one, 'cause this is a pretty big deal.
[time=2030] Many times, churches teach certain words for you to say that other people might say certain words back, okay?
[time=2039] And then once they've said the certain words back, you can go, got another one for the kingdom.
[time=2044] Be really careful about that.
[time=2048] The gospel does not come in words alone.
[time=2052] And he says, "We didn't simply come and speak words to you." It wasn't just words, it was their very life that they brought.
[time=2060] And you know what?
[time=2061] I've pretty much quit asking people if they'd like to pray a prayer with me, unless they initiate that, and sometimes they do.
[time=2071] Because they don't need to say some words in order to believe in their heart.
[time=2076] Now, they will confess with their mouth.
[time=2079] That's what the Bible says.
[time=2079] They will confess with their mouth at their believers.
[time=2082] But to get people to say some words, danger.
[time=2085] It's really obvious, isn't it, when people come to know Christ.
[time=2090] You watch them a few weeks later, and a few weeks later, and you go, "Oh, yeah, they really didn't believe." Look at that, different people.
[time=2097] Born again.
[time=2099] Old nature, dead.
[time=2101] New creature.
[time=2103] You see it in them.
[time=2104] He said it wasn't just words.
[time=2107] He said it was by power, by the Holy Spirit,
[time=2113] and deep conviction.
[time=2114] Deep conviction means fully assured.
[time=2120] I'm totally sure of what I've heard is true.
[time=2126] And what I've seen lived out in you is true.
[time=2129] And I am confident then that I can receive this message.
[time=2134] That's what they did.
[time=2136] By power, by the Holy Spirit.
[time=2138] Reminding me of Acts 1-8.
[time=2140] As soon as I saw that power in the Holy Spirit, I thought about Jesus with the apostles.
[time=2145] You know in Acts 1-8, Luke writes about what Jesus said to the apostles before he ascended into the heavens.
[time=2152] And he said, "But you shall be my witnesses, "when the Holy Spirit comes up on you, "you'll receive power by the Holy Spirit.
[time=2162] "And you'll be my witnesses." In Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and the uttermost parts of the earth.
[time=2170] Or the ends of the earth, the king.
[time=2171] I mean, the NIV says.
[time=2172] I thought, man, that's the same kind of thing there.
[time=2176] The Thessalonians, they didn't just hear words.
[time=2180] They received the power that comes through the Holy Spirit.
[time=2184] And Paul says, and we've observed that, and we've heard about it in you.
[time=2188] It's the real deal with you.
[time=2190] Deep conviction they received those words.
[time=2197] You know, I've been in those settings that I was talking about earlier, where you learned the words, you said the words, they responded with the words that they were supposed to respond with.
[time=2209] Truthfully, sometimes that happened with full assurance.
[time=2214] That happened with deep conviction.
[time=2217] Those people were born again.
[time=2218] God has used things like that for ages to lead people to Christ.
[time=2222] But if it's not with deep conviction, if it's not with full assurance, if they aren't really grasping the reality of their need for a savior, it's not real.
[time=2232] The words can be dangerous.
[time=2236] There are some words I learned that I still use.
[time=2241] I use them as illustrations to try to help people really understand and come to full assurance and help as they become convicted about what they need to do.
[time=2250] So firstly, a fully surrendered church
[time=2257] speaks a spirit-powered message.
[time=2260] A church can only do that when the body of believers within it is doing that.
[time=2264] Secondly, a fully surrendered church becomes an imitator, an imitator.
[time=2272] That word, verse six, let's look at it down there in verse six.
[time=2275] He says, "You became imitators of us and of the Lord, of us and of the Lord." Now, Paul, even other times in the Scripture, has said, "Be like me." Can you say that to people?
[time=2295] There's an element of that that makes perfect sense.
[time=2301] You know, when I first got saved and I first started to walk with the Lord, the guy that discipled me, I can tell you, I still say his words.
[time=2311] I hear him come out of my mouth and I'll go, Bill.
[time=2314] That was Bill.
[time=2315] My kids have heard him often enough.
[time=2317] They can probably spot the Bill words.
[time=2320] Don't let school get in the way of their education, Bill said.
[time=2324] I've said that to families for years.
[time=2328] Take them on vacation.
[time=2329] Don't you let school get in the way of their education.
[time=2333] But there's an end to me imitating him.
[time=2341] When I really understood more about the Bible and what God had for me, then I began to imitate Christ and I'd pick and choose what Bill taught me.
[time=2354] And you better do that with the people in your life.
[time=2357] The Thessalonians were able to imitate them, which is a sobering thought.
[time=2362] You better be ready, people are imitating you.
[time=2364] You ever watch your kids put on the clothes when they're little, puts your clothes on?
[time=2369] The first times they do that, man, that's just such a treat.
[time=2372] Big shoes, it was interesting.
[time=2376] One time Josh and Steph came out of the basement.
[time=2379] It's a little scary.
[time=2380] She was dressed like me and he was dressed like Renee.
[time=2383] He was really pretty.
[time=2386] And Steph was a pretty man, too.
[time=2390] But Steph had those great big shoes on and she actually dressed him up, which was kind of fun.
[time=2396] Did you have makeup on him and everything like that?
[time=2399] Yeah, that's what I thought.
[time=2401] But when they mimic you, when they imitate you, that's a real high privilege to see that happen, but it's also sobering, isn't it?
[time=2410] They're going to be like you.
[time=2411] Now later, they don't want to be like you at all.
[time=2414] But then later, they sort of want to be like you again.
[time=2416] It's fun when that happens again.
[time=2418] Is it coming?
[time=2419] (audience laughing) Then he says, but imitate him.
[time=2428] Listen about him.
[time=2429] He's faithful.
[time=2430] He's the same yesterday, today and forever.
[time=2432] Bill, no.
[time=2432] Uh-uh, not the same yesterday, today and forever.
[time=2437] Not faithful.
[time=2438] He is faithful.
[time=2438] He's the same yesterday, today and forever.
[time=2440] He's truthful.
[time=2441] He's just.
[time=2442] He's light.
[time=2443] He's love all the time.
[time=2447] That's why we can imitate Christ.
[time=2451] He's the only one that's the same yesterday, today and forever.
[time=2457] And I challenge you.
[time=2460] Yeah, there are some, there are certain aspects of imitating disciples.
[time=2465] You need to go ahead and grab that.
[time=2467] That's a normal thing.
[time=2468] But move toward imitating him.
[time=2470] Get in this yourself.
[time=2472] Be filled by his spirit.
[time=2475] And empowered by him to imitate him.
[time=2479] That's what the Thessalonians church was doing.
[time=2482] Can you, wouldn't you love it if you heard from somebody today and they said, hey, we've heard about your church.
[time=2488] We've heard you're imitating Christ over there.
[time=2490] Man.
[time=2493] Thirdly, a fully surrendered church
[time=2502] receives the word in hardship.
[time=2506] Look at the second half of verse six there.
[time=2511] Says you, you became imitators of us and of the Lord
[time=2518] in spite of severe suffering.
[time=2521] You welcome the message with the joy given by the Holy Spirit.
[time=2529] They received this message in hardship.
[time=2534] We don't know all about that.
[time=2537] We don't know everything there is to know about that.
[time=2539] But Thessalonica was a city on the sea, on the eastern coast of northern, what we call Greece today, in the region of Macedonia.
[time=2550] And it was a real transport city.
[time=2554] The Romans moved all kinds of goods through their back and forth from the east, okay?
[time=2560] And like most cities that are the hub of transporting things, it was large.
[time=2568] And there were lots of things available to the people that moved through town, nasty things.
[time=2574] And there were many idols there and temples there.
[time=2580] And if you weren't a participant in that city enhancing economy, if you step outside of that and you start to say that that's what's wrong with the world, you can imagine there's not a whole lot of people coming up going, hey, thanks for tearing our city down.
[time=2600] Really appreciate that our economy is gonna start slipping, not going on.
[time=2605] There's a lot of suffering that takes place.
[time=2607] And it was a nasty place to live.
[time=2613] And they received the gospel in suffering.
[time=2618] They were poor, we know that because it says so in 2 Corinthians, we'll look at that in a minute.
[time=2624] They were struggling.
[time=2626] They were under severe trial there.
[time=2628] And they received the word there.
[time=2631] How?
[time=2632] By the Holy Spirit with joy.
[time=2636] James says we are to consider it pure joy
[time=2644] okay, we're to consider it pure joy when we suffer through trials of many kinds.
[time=2649] Now let me tell you right now, it's not happy time.
[time=2654] And there's a mystery that takes place.
[time=2659] When you watch people who are filled with the spirit of God move through trials of many kinds, what you observe in them is joy.
[time=2672] And if you aren't familiar with that, you go, what is that?
[time=2678] Sometimes people say, ah, they're in denial.
[time=2681] 'Cause a spirit filled believer will be joyful
[time=2688] in times of trial.
[time=2689] Can't help it.
[time=2691] A spirit filled believer exhibits the fruit of the spirit.
[time=2696] Not the fruit of what they're experiencing.
[time=2701] They don't exhibit the circumstances that are taking place in their lives.
[time=2705] What they, what you see in them is love and joy and peace.
[time=2710] Patience and kindness and goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control as they're filled with the spirit moving through real, real severe times, you'll see joy.
[time=2723] And people outside the body, they don't get that at all.
[time=2731] They'll really think, they'll worry about you.
[time=2733] Oh, my God.
[time=2734] They can't, they haven't really dealt with it yet.
[time=2737] They haven't really done.
[time=2739] We gotta make sure they read the right book because they need to vent.
[time=2744] Not true.
[time=2748] You can have joy.
[time=2750] You can have joy in trial.
[time=2753] I'm not talking about being happy.
[time=2755] I'm talking about tear-filled, sad joy.
[time=2759] I'm talking about pain-ridden, heartache-filled, sad, painful joy.
[time=2766] If you've experienced that, you know exactly what I'm talking about.
[time=2773] That's them.
[time=2774] It comes from the Holy Spirit as I yield myself to Him, as I obediently quit doing the things that satisfy my old nature, my flesh.
[time=2788] And I block those, and I do, excuse me, what God has called me to do in obedience.
[time=2795] He fills me up.
[time=2796] Fourthly, a fully surrendered church
[time=2803] becomes a model to others.
[time=2806] They did this.
[time=2809] Look at verse seven.
[time=2810] And so you became a model to all the believers
[time=2816] in Macedonia and Acadia.
[time=2818] Macedonia, remember I said, that's that northern region of what we call Greece now?
[time=2822] Acadia is a southern region just south of there in what we call Greece today.
[time=2827] And it says they were models to both Macedonia and Acadia.
[time=2832] Well, that struck me again.
[time=2834] Well, how were they models?
[time=2836] Well, I told you we're gonna look at second Corinthians.
[time=2838] Let's look at that.
[time=2839] Second Corinthians chapter eight, turn over there in your Bibles.
[time=2842] That's not gonna be on the screen.
[time=2844] Second Corinthians chapter eight.
[time=2846] And second Corinthians chapter eight, Paul is writing to the Corinthians describing what's taking place as he has been in the process of taking up an offering to go back and help out the church in Jerusalem.
[time=2863] It's been suffering tremendously.
[time=2865] He says, let me tell you about the Macedonians.
[time=2869] That's the Thessalonians that we're talking about here.
[time=2872] Let me tell you about these people in Macedonia, he says, to the Corinthians.
[time=2876] Look at this.
[time=2876] And now brothers, verse one, chapter eight, second Corinthians, we want you to know about the grace that God has given the Macedonian churches.
[time=2886] Out of the most severe trial, their overwhelming joy and their extreme poverty welled up in rich generosity.
[time=2896] I have put that in the margin of every Bible I've had, little equation there.
[time=2901] So this is a God deal.
[time=2903] This doesn't work in man's terms.
[time=2906] Look at that equation.
[time=2907] Severe trial plus joy plus extreme poverty equal rich generosity.
[time=2917] That's what Paul said to the Corinthians about these people in Thessalonica.
[time=2925] They're really poor.
[time=2929] They're under terrible trials.
[time=2931] They have the joy of the spirit obvious in them, and they're giving a lot.
[time=2937] I wanna be in a group of local believers that are like that.
[time=2945] I wanna participate.
[time=2948] I want the people in our community to know that out of, when we're in dire circumstances, we're generous.
[time=2955] That's what he says about these people.
[time=2959] He says, you're a model, Thessalonians.
[time=2963] You're a model to everybody in the region around you.
[time=2965] That's Acts 1-8 again, look at that.
[time=2967] I couldn't believe it.
[time=2968] First we have by power and the Holy Spirit up there when I talked about them being imitators.
[time=2974] And now I see it's in Macedonia.
[time=2978] First of all, Thessalonica, the city they're in, Macedonia, Acaya, the region.
[time=2984] In Acts 1-8, he says, "You'll be my witnesses." We're Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, the next region up and to the uttermost parts of the earth.
[time=2994] And if you look down here, it says and everywhere in the next verse, these people were a model.
[time=3000] They were a model of the people in their city.
[time=3006] They were a model to the people in the bordering region.
[time=3009] They were a model to people everywhere.
[time=3016] I said in the first service, oh man, I'd love for people to hear about our local body in Fort Wayne, I'd hope that more than just Blackhawk, even that the church at Fort Wayne would be known as something across the land that was ringing out the truth.
[time=3031] But obviously, I want our local body, Blackhawk.
[time=3034] And a guy came up to me after the first service.
[time=3035] He said, "Well, you're known in Wisconsin.
[time=3037] "That's why we came here here." He said, "We heard about Blackhawk in Wisconsin, "so we checked it out and we're here." That's good.
[time=3046] Are you a model?
[time=3051] Are you a person that you'd say, "Yeah, be like me?"
[time=3057] You see, in our humility, we often just beat ourselves
[time=3066] up and say, "No, I can't ever be like that." Paul said, "Be like me." He said, "These people were models "for other people to be like.
[time=3076] "By the power of God and by the power of His Spirit, "we're able to be models." And it's important to accept the reality that it is within you by God's grace and for His glory and by His power to be a model.
[time=3094] The next verse just kind of builds on that.
[time=3101] We have this big crescendo here in the fifth point.
[time=3105] The fifth point is the fully surrendered church shares the gospel loudly.
[time=3110] I should say shares the gospel loudly.
[time=3114] Look at what it says there.
[time=3120] The Lord's message rang out.
[time=3123] That's the loudly part in the NAS.
[time=3126] It says sounded forth, but there's an exclamation in that.
[time=3129] This word rang out sounded forth.
[time=3131] That Greek word really means like blast forth.
[time=3135] It's like the biggest trumpet you can possibly imagine.
[time=3139] Think of one bigger than those real long horns that they have up in the Alps, those guys.
[time=3144] Bigger than that, bigger bell than that.
[time=3146] Think of one big enough that everybody could hear it.
[time=3150] That's what he says.
[time=3152] He says,
[time=3161] The Lord's message rang out from you not only in Macedonia and to Kya.
[time=3164] Your faith in God has become known everywhere, everywhere.
[time=3169] It's like thunder.
[time=3174] It's like this trumpet that blasts, the biggest blast anybody's ever heard on the earth.
[time=3182] It's like the biggest gong you can ever think of building.
[time=3187] Anybody ever see that movie, The Vikings?
[time=3190] I always let you probably haven't.
[time=3191] There's this big bell that they find.
[time=3193] It's an old movie.
[time=3195] Richard Widmark is in the movie.
[time=3199] The only three people in here know who that is.
[time=3202] I think Kirk Douglas might be in that movie too.
[time=3207] Anyhow, there's a big bell that they're going after.
[time=3211] It's this giant bell and it's covered with, they don't know that the bell is really metal because it looks like stone.
[time=3220] It's been covered with this plaster and mud and stone and stuff and they get in the fight, they're looking for this gold bell, but they don't realize they've found it and they're inside this thing having a fight and suddenly the clapper hits the bell.
[time=3237] What looked like rock and everybody's going, you should ring out like that.
[time=3246] The gospel should be so a part of who you are.
[time=3251] We're not talking about a Sunday morning experience here.
[time=3254] Every guy in business in here should be clanging the gospel out.
[time=3259] And I'm not talking about yelling at people.
[time=3262] I'm not talking about trumpeting in their ear.
[time=3265] I'm talking about your life being so filled by the Spirit of God that as you move through your life day by day, people say, wow, that's different.
[time=3275] That's other than what I am.
[time=3277] That's a transformed person.
[time=3280] Every man and woman and boy and girl should be modeling that.
[time=3288] What he says about the Thessalonians here, they were a giant gong ringing out everywhere.
[time=3296] Oh man, I want to be a part of a church like that.
[time=3300] That just wasn't for the first century folks.
[time=3303] That's for 2003 in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=3307] And we can be people like that.
[time=3310] And it's not Sunday morning.
[time=3311] Hear me on this again.
[time=3312] It's who you are in Christ, Sunday through Saturday night.
[time=3319] And it rings out a message that people can hear.
[time=3325] And God uses that message to bring them to saving faith.
[time=3329] And then they begin to bring glory to him the way he designed them to.
[time=3334] And that's why we're here.
[time=3335] And Paul was able to say that about the Thessalonians.
[time=3339] That's five points.
[time=3343] Kelly's going to finish the next three.
[time=3344] He and I put these together this week and I had time to do five.
[time=3349] Let's close.
[time=3350] Look at 1 Peter, I love this passage.
[time=3362] 1 Peter, chapter one, verse 13.
[time=3367] Again, it's not going to be on the screen.
[time=3369] He says, therefore, chapter one, verse 13,
[time=3375] prepare your minds for action.
[time=3377] I want to challenge you to get in this and listen intently to the people that teach it well, to prepare your mind for the action that God's called you to wherever you are tomorrow.
[time=3393] Like the Thessalonians did.
[time=3397] Set your hope, oh, he says for action, be self-controlled.
[time=3405] Remember, that's not you controlling yourself.
[time=3409] Remember when I listed those fruits of the Holy Spirit?
[time=3411] The last one's self-control.
[time=3413] I am controlled by him to the extent that I'm obedience,
[time=3419] yielding to him and he fills me up and he controls me.
[time=3424] That's what self-control is.
[time=3427] Set your hope fully on the grace to be given you when Jesus Christ is revealed.
[time=3432] Keep my mind focused on him coming back.
[time=3436] Kelly's going to hit that next week.
[time=3438] As obedient children, do not conform to the evil desires
[time=3444] you had when you lived in ignorance.
[time=3447] Don't go back to doing those stupid things that you didn't know better and they drug you down.
[time=3453] Listen to this, but just as he who called you is holy, he who called us is holy.
[time=3460] God is holy.
[time=3461] So be holy in all you do.
[time=3464] For it's written, be holy because I am holy.
[time=3467] You cannot choose to be a holy person and be holy.
[time=3477] When he's chosen you, you can respond to him in obedience and yield to his spirit filling you up as a fully surrendered follower of the Lord Jesus Christ and he makes you holy.
[time=3493] That's what he said about them.
[time=3498] I want them to say that about us.
[time=3502] I want that to be our epitaph.
[time=3508] Don't you?
[time=3509] Don't you really deep down in your heart really want that?
[time=3513] Let's beg him for it.
[time=3516] Lord, your word is so powerful
[time=3522] and by your spirit we are empowered to understand it
[time=3529] and we feed upon it and we yield to you and I pray that this week we will wring out, we will sound forth the gospel through our lives.
[time=3542] Sometimes our very soft words.
[time=3546] In Jesus name I pray, amen.
[time=3551] (upbeat music)
