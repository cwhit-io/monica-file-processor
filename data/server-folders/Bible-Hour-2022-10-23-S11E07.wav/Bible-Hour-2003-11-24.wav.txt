[time=554] [MUSIC] â™ª Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, Senior Pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries, and we're so thankful for the chance to be with you again.
[time=564] I want you to know that what you're going to see today is the second part in a series we've entitled "The Eight Traits of a Fully Surrendered Church." The eight characteristics, if you will, of a God-honoring church.
[time=578] And as I say that, I think what I would love for you to consider today as you view the broadcast is that a church is made up of individuals.
[time=588] And for a church to truly be God-honoring in its ministry, for a church to really reach its full redemptive potential, for a church to be a fully surrendered church, doing things the way that God would have them done.
[time=603] Having a ministry that's truly effective, it's got to be full of people, individuals, like you and me that are fully surrendered, that are God-honoring, that are connected, connected to the Spirit of God, doing the work of God in a way that would truly honor and please Him.
[time=624] And so I would just invite you as we go through these eight traits to just honestly assess, how are you doing?
[time=633] As you hear these things described, and as you hear these eight traits articulated, would you be willing, as I've been trying to do, in these last two weeks, just personally, to just kind of lay my heart open before God and say, "God, these eight things are really important, and do whatever you've got to do in me.
[time=650] Teach me, whatever you've got to teach me.
[time=652] Take me, wherever you've got to take me, because I want to be individually fully surrendered and completely given to you so that I can be part of a body, part of a family.
[time=664] It's truly and absolutely committed, fully surrendered, a God-honoring church.
[time=670] So I hope you'll take me up on that and open up your heart and mind today for what God would have for you.
[time=676] I also want to invite you to come and join us.
[time=679] By the time you see this, we will be headed toward our second weekend of Christmas with Blackhawk in our presentation of this spectacular drama and musical called "Home." And this next coming weekend, December 12th, 13th, and 14th.
[time=697] There's still some room.
[time=698] We'd love for you to come by and get some tickets.
[time=700] We'd love for you to visit the website at Christmaswithblackhawk.org.
[time=704] There are some general seating tickets still available, some reserved seats as well, and we would love to have you come with us.
[time=711] It has been an absolute privilege, again, to bring the never-changing message of Christmas to this community for the 27th year.
[time=721] And I am so proud of our people and the effort that they've made.
[time=725] You will be not only impressed, you'll be encouraged.
[time=729] You really will be.
[time=730] It is a spectacular performance, and we'd love to have you come and join us this weekend.
[time=735] Hope to see you then.
[time=748] [MUSIC]
[time=778] (SINGING)
[time=808] [MUSIC - 32 seconds]
[time=842] Let's sing that last slide again.
[time=844] Here's my heart.
[time=846] [MUSIC - 2 seconds] Here's my heart.
[time=852] [MUSIC - 10 seconds]
[time=863] Well, we are thankful for the chance to be together again, and I want to just say before we get going, how grateful I am again for Steve, long break, and for Mitchell, teaching pastors here at Blackhawk.
[time=874] Some of you remember about a year and a half ago, our elders decided that we would give this teaching team concept a try, and we have been so very thankful for what it has brought to this place.
[time=885] I was the one that asked that we give ourselves to this.
[time=890] I can't describe the first time it actually hit me, but kind of looking back over my spiritual life since I came to Christ at the age of 20, from the very beginning, and on through these years, I've always sensed inside me kind of a danger, if you will, in just one voice,
[time=912] if that makes sense at all to you.
[time=914] I look at the body of Christ, and I realize how diverse and how gifted the body is, and how there are those who can communicate, there are those who can teach, and they do it different ways with different styles, and I always felt like, again, growing up in my faith, that it would be a healthy representation of a body of Christ if we literally had teaching elders, if you will, men who could stand and communicate truth, and it not always be done just the same way by the same guy all the time.
[time=947] And so I'm so grateful that Mitch is here with me today, so thankful for what Steve did last week.
[time=953] I learned some new things, again, last week from him, and I'm grateful for what it allows me in my own life, just so you know, when I come to a week when I'm not preaching, I don't not work.
[time=965] I stay at it, and I'm able to give myself to people and to things that I wouldn't normally get to do in light of the study and preparation.
[time=974] I've got to admit one of the biggest gains that it brings to my life is the freedom it brings me in a given week when I'm not teaching to be with my family, to be with them literally, yes, but if this makes sense mentally.
[time=987] See, when I'm preaching, it consumes me.
[time=990] It's what I think about, it's what I talk about, it's what I ask about, it's always there, and so on those weeks, it gives me a wonderful break.
[time=998] And as I've said to you before, I love them, my family, more than I love you.
[time=1004] And I want nothing more than to be able to do what I do in a way on a team that allows me certain freedoms to invest in them and to be with them.
[time=1014] I want them to love this place in 20 years and not resent it.
[time=1019] And so we do what we can to just kind of divvy it up and keep going at it and thanks so much for the support that you give.
[time=1025] And like I said, it's good to be here today with Mitch and we are going to continue in this study of first Thessalonians.
[time=1032] Why don't you open your Bibles if you've got one with you today?
[time=1035] If you don't know a big deal, most of it will be on the screen or you might want to look on with somebody next to you.
[time=1040] What Steve did for us last week, it was phenomenal.
[time=1043] What he did was start in a sense to paint a picture, a picture of a fully surrendered church.
[time=1049] What we got last week was the beginning look at a biblical picture of a God honoring effective church.
[time=1056] And I suppose it's not a surprise to you all that I would want to be a part of that.
[time=1061] I would want your efforts and mine.
[time=1063] I would want our service to him.
[time=1065] I would want this that we've thrown our arms around here.
[time=1069] I would want it to make a difference.
[time=1071] I would want it to honor him.
[time=1072] I would want to be a place and a people that these kinds of things could be set about.
[time=1078] And what we see here in 1 Thessalonians 1, 5 through 10 are 8 traits of a fully surrendered God honoring church.
[time=1086] Paul commends this church.
[time=1089] He encourages this young and growing body.
[time=1092] And as he does, it gives you and I the growing family here at Blackhawk.
[time=1096] It gives us the opportunity to evaluate.
[time=1099] It gives us the opportunity to assess.
[time=1102] It gives you and I the chance to in a sense challenge ourselves and not compared to the church down the street, not compared to the church across town, but instead to take what we're doing here, what he's doing through us here and compare it to the biblical model.
[time=1120] This God honoring family found in Thessalonica.
[time=1124] And that's what we began last week.
[time=1126] That's what Steve got us going on, the 8 traits.
[time=1128] Let me just take you back through these first several traits that he went over.
[time=1132] If you weren't here last week, get out of pen and catch up.
[time=1135] Because these are some powerful truths.
[time=1137] What we saw was that a fully surrendered church, number one, speaks a spirit-powered message.
[time=1144] Go ahead and get that down.
[time=1146] A fully surrendered God honoring church speaks a spirit-powered message.
[time=1152] What Steve told us last week was that it's not really necessarily or primarily about a clear or bright or eloquent message, but instead a messenger, right?
[time=1165] Completely surrendered, totally given, absolutely yielded to the Holy Spirit.
[time=1176] That's a God honoring church where those that teach, yes, with microphones wrapped around their ears, okay, but also those who live, those who proclaim the truth,
[time=1190] those who take the gospel message, if you will.
[time=1193] And you like I do.
[time=1195] We go out of these doors back into life.
[time=1198] And at the workplace and with your family and with friends and in your neighborhood, we all are communicators.
[time=1205] We all are proclaiming something.
[time=1208] Our hope is that we would be proclaiming a spirit-powered message.
[time=1213] Messengers, you and me yielded to the Holy Spirit.
[time=1222] It's dangerous stuff, people, when that doesn't happen.
[time=1227] When you or I just speak what we want to say, talk about what we want to talk about, give opinions that are just ours.
[time=1238] It's dangerous, you know, when instead we could be giving truth, spirit-led and spirit-guided.
[time=1246] A fully surrendered God honoring church speaks a spirit-powered message.
[time=1250] My wife and kids gave me this Bible just a couple of years ago, and on it they had inscribed what they know is one of my favorite verses, 1 Peter 4-11, every time I sit right down here in this pew, no matter whether I'm in this building or some other place, whatever I go to speak, wherever I go to try my best to communicate God's word, every single time I sit, wherever I'm sitting, before I walk up, I just say to myself, and I began doing this years ago, I say to myself the words of 1 Peter 4-11, let him who speaks speak as if it were the utterances of God.
[time=1285] Not me, not man, but him, his word, his truth, guided by his spirit.
[time=1293] What I love about that is that the gospel now can't be contained in four sentences.
[time=1303] The word of angelism doesn't appear in the Bible, the word of angelist does.
[time=1308] And so if I'm in Christ and I'm actually taking the Holy Spirit into whatever room I walk into and whatever person I lock eyes with, and I don't have to make them say it a certain way, but I need to be the life of the gospel to them and have them catch it.
[time=1326] Secondly, we saw that a fully surrendered church becomes an imitator.
[time=1331] Write that down, a fully surrendered God-honoring church, those people become imitators of him.
[time=1338] They become, as it says there in the text, imitators.
[time=1342] That was back up there in verse 6.
[time=1345] You also became imitators of us and of the Lord.
[time=1349] You see that?
[time=1350] And I got a question for you just real quick on that one.
[time=1352] It says here that a fully surrendered God-honoring church will be comprised of people who are becoming more and more like him.
[time=1359] You and I, it says, would become imitators, mimics, copiers.
[time=1364] I mean, we would become more and more like him.
[time=1368] And when I thought about that more this week, a simple but profound truth came to mind
[time=1374] and that is that we become like, we become imitators.
[time=1378] We become mimics of something that we know, that we see,
[time=1385] for you to become a copy, for you to become an imitator.
[time=1388] Your view of him, your knowledge of him, your proximity with him
[time=1394] has got to be something that's real and growing and intimate.
[time=1399] These people, Paul says, we're becoming imitators of him.
[time=1403] Thirdly, they were receiving the Word.
[time=1405] Look what it says there at the end of verse 6.
[time=1407] You also became imitators of us and of the Lord, having received the Word in much tribulation with the joy of the Holy Spirit.
[time=1416] Thirdly, a fully surrendered church receives the Word in hardship,
[time=1423] receives the Word in hardship.
[time=1425] And it begs the question for you and I today, where do you go?
[time=1429] Where do you run?
[time=1432] Where is it that you seek refuge?
[time=1435] I mean, when the tough day comes, when the difficult times hit, when the suffering rears its head, where do you go?
[time=1444] Where do you go to receive?
[time=1447] The refrigerator, a hobby, the computer, someone else,
[time=1461] these people it says, this fully surrendered body in Thessalonica, when hardship hits, it says they received the Word.
[time=1470] They run to the truth.
[time=1473] They run to the life-giving, perspective-giving Word of God.
[time=1480] In much tribulation, in hardship, they receive the Word.
[time=1485] And it says fourthly there, they became a model, a fully surrendered church.
[time=1490] It's full of fully surrendered Christ followers who are becoming a model.
[time=1495] A model, it says there, look at verse 7, so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in a Kia.
[time=1504] Interesting Word.
[time=1505] I love this Word example.
[time=1506] In the Greek, when you look at that, you kind of dig around a little bit on that Word and its usage, you find that that Word is the same Word used in the Greek language in reference, a mark left by a blow.
[time=1521] Think of somebody taking a shot in the eye.
[time=1524] Or better yet, it's the same Word used for a branding.
[time=1528] You think of that hot iron, you know, pressed on the back side of that cow.
[time=1533] That's the Word in the Greek for model.
[time=1538] An example, a distinct mark that clearly indicates that cow right there, that's mine.
[time=1546] That's my brand.
[time=1548] I don't know anything about cows, so don't mistake me as an expert here.
[time=1554] But I'm told.
[time=1556] Seriously, I'm told you can get a hundred of them going back and forth in a deal and the guy that owns them, the brand, it's just boom, right there.
[time=1565] You can just tell.
[time=1566] That one's mine.
[time=1567] That one's not, that one is, and that one's mine.
[time=1570] The brand, this mark left by a blow.
[time=1572] Your faith, God says, you're fully surrendered life.
[time=1578] And the fully surrendered life of this church, it's a brand.
[time=1584] And wherever we go, whatever we do, it's clear.
[time=1589] There's no real question, see, because we're Christ followers.
[time=1594] That always kind of used to be about what we didn't do and where we didn't go and what we didn't wear and what we didn't watch.
[time=1602] You know, more so in my mind these days, it's much more about what we do
[time=1609] versus what we don't do.
[time=1612] And when you do Christ in you, when you love like that, when you give like that,
[time=1618] when you come alongside like that, when you serve like that, mark left by a blow.
[time=1627] You and I become examples.
[time=1628] You know, I love about that branding concept is Paul writes in 2 Corinthians 3 that that branding is on my heart.
[time=1636] And it's not written with pen and ink or someone that's written with the spirit
[time=1642] of the living God and with his finger on my heart.
[time=1645] And so now everything, the heart is my source.
[time=1648] And so everything I do, that branding flows.
[time=1651] Absolutely.
[time=1653] Fifthly, write this down.
[time=1654] This is where Steve left off last week.
[time=1656] So here we're kind of catching up.
[time=1658] Fifthly, a fully surrendered church, a God honoring body of Christ followers.
[time=1663] They share the truth.
[time=1664] They share the gospel loudly.
[time=1668] They are a people who are not ashamed.
[time=1671] They are a people who are completely given.
[time=1673] They see every encounter as a divine appointment.
[time=1679] They are willing.
[time=1680] They are ready.
[time=1681] They are wanting to share their faith.
[time=1684] They look forward.
[time=1686] They look forward to building redemptive relationships with those in their world.
[time=1691] They get up in the morning thinking about it.
[time=1693] They go to bed at night praying about it.
[time=1696] They've got people on their hearts.
[time=1698] They want so badly with his help to be him to a lost and hurting world.
[time=1707] I wrote this down last week.
[time=1708] This is the one trait that an increasingly materialistic, busy.
[time=1712] I'll say that again.
[time=1714] Busy face in front of a computer screen Christian culture continues to fail miserably at.
[time=1720] It's the one thing that an increasingly materialistic, busy face in front of a computer screen Christian culture
[time=1727] continues to fail miserably at.
[time=1730] Who are you?
[time=1731] Who are you actively, intentionally sharing your faith with, living out your life with?
[time=1741] Who's far from God?
[time=1743] How is it that you are trumpeting?
[time=1745] We saw in the text last week that it talked about trumpeting.
[time=1748] Sounding the gospel has sounded forth, Paul says, from you.
[time=1753] How is it that you are trumpeting the gospel?
[time=1756] Not me, not Mitch, you.
[time=1759] How are you sounding forth?
[time=1762] How are you living with a redemptive passion?
[time=1767] What redeeming friendships are you cultivating?
[time=1770] What changes to your schedule are you making?
[time=1773] What alterations in your lifestyle are you considering so that you can rub shoulders with,
[time=1779] be with, come up alongside and love somebody?
[time=1784] Who needs to know what that really is like?
[time=1788] It really bothers me as I look at these if I don't measure up on that one.
[time=1794] Because if I'm truly in Christ, then I will take him and if he is like the father he equates himself with
[time=1801] and the parable of the prodigal son in Luke 15, if he chases down sinners, then so should I.
[time=1808] And we need to look at that.
[time=1811] That's one through five, Mitch is going to start us off here on six.
[time=1814] And we'll hit six, seven and eight, these eight traits of a fully surrendered church.
[time=1818] And Mitch is going to pick it up there at verse nine.
[time=1820] Six, seven and eight are turning to God from idols, serving God, and waiting for him.
[time=1830] Or awaiting for him.
[time=1832] So let me go verse nine first for they themselves report about us, what kind of a reception we had with you
[time=1840] and how you turn to God from idols.
[time=1846] Turn in Greek is epistrefo.
[time=1850] And the reason it's kind of important is this.
[time=1852] Epistrefo, the prefix EPI means to.
[time=1858] Strefo means turn.
[time=1861] Paul could have said APO, epistrefo, which means from.
[time=1868] And the reason I point this out is because the world outside of the church, the world outside of Christ,
[time=1874] a relationship with Christ, has caught a message that seems to be quite different than what the Bible communicates
[time=1880] and what you and I, if we would remember, looks more like.
[time=1884] And that is that I turn to God and then I release the idols here, or then I release that habit.
[time=1892] And they've caught a message from us that we've got to clean ourselves up to come to Christ.
[time=1897] I shared the story with you once before and I shared it with a person who was in first service about six weeks ago
[time=1903] and he surrendered his life to Christ.
[time=1905] And the story is this, that there was a seminary class that would, as it would end, as they would be ready to graduate.
[time=1912] The professor would send them up the hill and go talk to the center, the big center Hank, who smoked, drank, cussed and chased things
[time=1919] and weren't supposed to chase.
[time=1920] So they would all go up there and Hank would got wise to this and Hank would ask each seminary graduating class,
[time=1926] if you're telling me I got a quit smoking, quit drinking, quit cussing, quit chasing to come to Christ and they'd say yeah.
[time=1932] And they'd leave and nothing would happen.
[time=1934] Well, one day a seminary student got kind of wise and he was getting ready to leave the seminary and he went up on his own.
[time=1939] And Hank, you know, was caught on to this and he said, "Now wait a minute, son, you're telling me I got a quit smoking, quit drinking, quit cussing, quit chasing to come to Christ."
[time=1951] And the seminary student said, "No, you got to come to Christ Hank to quit smoking, to quit cussing, to quit drinking, to quit chasing."
[time=1961] And that's our message.
[time=1963] And that's Paul's message so clearly here, epistrofo, and it's not just a message here and Paul would know this.
[time=1969] It is the message of the Old Testament.
[time=1971] Turn to God or return to God.
[time=1974] You turn to Joel 2 12, I think it's going to come up on this screen.
[time=1979] A thousand sixty times in the Old Testament, the word for turn or return, choose both ways, the Hebrew word is SHUB, SHUB.
[time=1990] A thousand sixty times in the Old Testament is one of the predominant themes.
[time=1994] It is the twelfth most frequently used Hebrew verb in the Old Testament.
[time=1999] And listen to this, here's what Joel says in 2, 12 and 13, yet even now, yet even now declares the Lord, return to me.
[time=2007] There it is, return to me with all your heart, that source of every decision you'll make.
[time=2014] And with fasting and weeping and mourning, you'll really mean it and rent your heart and not your garments inside, not outside.
[time=2023] Now return, there it is, return to the Lord God. Why? For He is gracious, compassionate, slow to anger, abounding and loving kindness and relenting of evil.
[time=2033] And remember that Paul started this whole section in 1st Thessalonians in this letter with the grace and the peace that is only found in Christ.
[time=2043] God is gracious, Christ is the ultimate picture of that grace.
[time=2047] Think of this, if I had a key, remember I talked about full surrender and a lock, and we got this lock on the human heart, and a lock is two concentric cylinders.
[time=2058] And there are pins that hold them together, so until a key is inserted and pops up those pins one by one, there isn't full surrender.
[time=2066] We talked about putting the key in part way, inserting the key part way is not full surrender, it needs to be and pop those last pins up.
[time=2075] But can you imagine, can you imagine popping that key in and getting that last pin to pop up, but never turning, never turning the key in the lock, so it will open the door of your heart.
[time=2093] And that in many ways is what Paul is saying, "Epistrefal, turn to God, in my life, in my deepest sin, is where I found an intimacy with Christ that I didn't know could exist, and it wasn't in a church building."
[time=2110] Solomon has just dedicated the temple, and he's prayed to God, "God, when we mess up, turn back to us, God, if we'll turn to you, please turn back to us."
[time=2120] And God responds at the dedication of this temple, and it's one of the most beautiful verses in all the Scriptures in 2 Chronicles 7, 14.
[time=2129] And it says, "And my people who are called, branded by my name, when they humble themselves in pray and seek my face, when they humble themselves in pray and seek my face, do that first, turn from their wicked ways.
[time=2149] Then I will hear from Heaven, will forgive their sin, that's the ultimate problem, and will heal their land."
[time=2157] Epistrefal, turn.
[time=2159] Turn.
[time=2160] The word in the Greek also carries with it the idea of turning and moving.
[time=2164] Don't miss this.
[time=2165] Turning and moving in the opposite direction, right?
[time=2169] And I want to make sure we're clear on this.
[time=2171] Several folks have asked about this in recent weeks around here, because we'll use this phrase fully surrendered often.
[time=2178] And there is a turning and a moving in the opposite direction, right?
[time=2182] That takes place when someone comes to faith in Christ.
[time=2186] For me, 1983, 20 years ago, I came to that point where I said I quit.
[time=2192] I can't do this.
[time=2194] My sin separates me from a living and holy God, and I surrendered my heart and my life to him completely and fully I believed.
[time=2203] And he saved me.
[time=2205] Fully surrendered.
[time=2207] Salvation.
[time=2209] Now, there is in my life today, there has been from that day all the way along these 20 years, just these stops along the way where almost like, I hope this doesn't discourage you, but like daily along the way.
[time=2222] I'm having to fully surrender myself again and again and again.
[time=2227] You okay with that?
[time=2231] Not for salvation, because salvation took place once and for all right here, but now there's this work that he does in us called sanctification, making us more and more like him.
[time=2241] And I find as I go that as the days go by, I see in new ways all over again things I've got to get rid of, things I've got to let go of, things I need to confess and I find myself again and again fully surrendering, needing to turn.
[time=2256] What I did here, I turned. See, I turned here, 1983, I stopped going certain places and I stopped ingesting certain things and I stopped doing a lot of stuff.
[time=2268] And I turned and went in an opposite direction.
[time=2271] And the turning that he calls me to now in life, much the same, you and I coming face to face with our sin, realizing that we need to turn.
[time=2281] And these people, folks at Pestrefo, they turn. Stand up just for a second, everybody.
[time=2286] Stand up, face me right here. I want to remind you, I know it's just a slight little nuance of the word, but I want to remind you of something, okay?
[time=2295] I want everybody to just turn and face this wall right here. Everybody turn and face this far wall here, okay?
[time=2304] Nobody looking at me, everybody looking at the wall. Now when I say go, on three I'm going to say go, I want you to turn back and face me, one, two, three, go.
[time=2314] Okay, that's not it. That's called a glance.
[time=2321] Okay, there's a turn and there's a glance.
[time=2326] A lot of us in the room, we like to glance instead of turn.
[time=2333] Sometimes you and I think it's a one foot in, one foot out deal. It's not.
[time=2339] Turn back and face this wall, if you will, okay?
[time=2342] And understand that when God's word says that these were a people who turned epistrefoed, it means they realized some things and realized that honoring God would mean
[time=2355] a completely different direction, an absolute turn. So now turn and face the other wall on three, one, two, three, go.
[time=2365] There you go.
[time=2367] Make sense? Thanks. Have a seat.
[time=2370] These people had turned, they had turned to God and look what they turned to do. Look what they turned and gave themselves to. Look what this led to.
[time=2380] Number seven, a fully surrendered church serves God.
[time=2385] You see that right there? Serves God.
[time=2388] For they themselves report about us, what kind of a reception we had with you and how you turned to God from idols to serve, underline it, highlight it, do something to help those two words stand out.
[time=2402] These people, they turned and they turned to serve a living and true God's service. This word, doulas, D-O-U-L-O-S.
[time=2414] This phrase captures more of a mindset. Watch this. More of a mindset than an activity.
[time=2420] There is an activity that comes with it that's true, but first we must understand the mindset. First we must ask ourselves, is it my mindset?
[time=2429] Is it how I view myself? Is it how we view ourselves?
[time=2433] A fully surrendered church sees themselves as servants, literally slaves. The word doulas used here in the text means slave and we see it depicted so powerfully.
[time=2444] Go back to Romans, if you will. Go to Romans chapter six and let's look at this idea of being a doulas, being a slave.
[time=2454] Paul points out that we are slaves. We're slaves in one world or the other. Question is which one will we serve? Look at Romans six and we're going to pick it up in verse 16.
[time=2468] Follow along with me. It says, do you not know that when you present, I'm going to ask you to put yourself in the shoes here of this passage.
[time=2478] So when it asks you a question, it's asking you a question. Do you not know that when you present yourselves to someone as slaves for obedience,
[time=2488] you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin resulting in death or of obedience resulting in righteousness.
[time=2499] But thanks be to God, Paul says here to the church at Rome, thanks be to God that though you were slaves of sin, you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching to which you were committed and having been freed from sin, you became slaves.
[time=2519] See, sometimes people have a mental block with this word slave. They hear me or others talking about being slaves to God and they think, oh, wait a minute now.
[time=2530] It's getting a little dark, it's getting a little confining, isn't it? But wait a minute. No, no, no. We were slaves.
[time=2538] We were freed from sin. Sin owned you. Sin owned me. It had its way with us.
[time=2548] And because of the grace of God through faith in Jesus Christ says we have been freed from sin and we have become slaves of righteousness.
[time=2559] And I want that. I want righteousness to have its way with me. I want to be tossed around. I want to be governed by. I want to be ruled by what is right.
[time=2570] By Him. I'm speaking verse 19 in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh for just as you presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness resulting in further lawlessness.
[time=2584] So now, present your members. Listen to that folks. Present your eyes. Guys, ladies, present your eyes and your mouth and your mind and your feet and your hands.
[time=2610] Where you go and what you think and what you touch and what he says all of that, the members.
[time=2617] So now, present your members as slaves to righteousness resulting in sanctification.
[time=2626] Do lots. There it is defined for you right there on the screen. To serve as a slave. One who existed to serve only one purpose. The expressed desire of his or her master.
[time=2641] These people turned to serve and to serve in this fashion. Mitch is going to tell you a little bit about what that looks like, what that means for you and I today.
[time=2650] Well, they turn from idols carved images to the living and true God, a vibrant relationship with the living and true God.
[time=2659] And people who study the history of words and where they come from say that doulas comes from the word dust to get dusty, to get dusty.
[time=2670] Jesus says in the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 624 that no one can serve two masters.
[time=2676] You either hate one and love the other, but you're not going to be able to serve two masters. It doesn't mean I can't serve Kelly and Steve.
[time=2683] What it means is who's going to be the overarching Lord of my life? Is it going to be God or is it going to be me?
[time=2690] Jesus goes on to say you can't serve God and money. We know that this is a problem that the Thessalonians have because of the cult.
[time=2698] The predominant cult there was Cabrious. It was all about wealth and power. Very similar to the great American dream gone awry here in our culture today.
[time=2705] So Jesus says you can't serve one or the other. You know the interesting thing about that is I'm going to serve, I'm going to get dusty, I'm going to do loss for something, for somebody.
[time=2716] Can't serve two, but there's going to be somebody like Bob Dylan writes in the song. Everybody's going to serve somebody.
[time=2722] And so the question is who am I getting dusty for? Who am I getting dusty for?
[time=2731] And the more I bow the knees of my heart to God, Jesus says, the more the knees of my heart are bowed to other people.
[time=2745] So I go through life and I begin getting a little more dusty, a little more dusty to serve God and flesh that out by serving others.
[time=2754] And Jesus says you're going to have one master. He could have picked two words. It's so interesting. You could have picked two words for master.
[time=2762] And he chose karyos instead of despotis. Karyos is a master that everything good flows from him. So I'm 145-9. God is good to all he has made.
[time=2776] First Timothy 4-4, everything God created is good. God is just this source of goodness.
[time=2782] And so am I going to get dusty for the goodness? He didn't choose the other word which means like, you know, that slave like beat you like a rented mule and there's evil in that heart.
[time=2794] And you know, all that kind of, he chose karyos. So we got to ask ourselves, who am I getting dusty for?
[time=2801] For me, for a car, for a house, for a job, for a career, for advancement, for an illicit relationship, or for him.
[time=2812] You can't serve. You can't get dusty for two masters.
[time=2820] And he moves on to the 8th, the 8th trade of a fully surrendered church, which is weight. This is very interesting to me.
[time=2830] Verse 10, "And to wait for his son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, that is Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath to come."
[time=2840] Weight. Animino, it's the only place in the New Testament and I think the whole Bible that this word appears. And it means, oh, wait.
[time=2850] It's like an athlete getting ready for the big game. It's like a bride awaiting her wedding day.
[time=2860] It's like a child awaiting Christmas. And there's two things I want you to get from it.
[time=2867] First of all, it's intentional, not unintentional. It's intentional, not unintentional. This awaiting of Jesus.
[time=2876] And it's active, not passive. It's active, not passive. Turn to Isaiah 40, 31, and you'll see that in the Hebrew language, there is no passive verb.
[time=2888] Every verb is active, so it's not passive. And Isaiah 40, 31, he says, "Yet those who wait," there it is, "those who wait for the Lord."
[time=2898] More like a waiter or a waitress in a restaurant and a less like somebody sitting on a bench waiting for a bus.
[time=2905] We'll gain new strength. Those who wait for the Lord will gain new strength.
[time=2910] They will mount up with wings like eagles. Look how active this is. With wings like eagles, they will run and not get tired.
[time=2917] They will walk and not become weary. They will be active. They will wait. They will serve. They will wait for Jesus.
[time=2928] And the picture I'd like you to get there is wings.
[time=2932] The wings of the eagle, because the wings of the eagle kind of allow me to rise up above all this hurt, all this pain, all this sin, all this death, and to see that there is an end. There is a hope.
[time=2946] God is still in control. And that hope is a vibrant relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=2954] And if I wait and await and carry that around everywhere I go, people are going to see that and they're going to want that.
[time=2962] I think we've done the church. It's my opinion. I think we've done the church a huge disservice.
[time=2969] I think for years and years we've taught a message of waiting for him that in a lot of ways has kind of backfired.
[time=2978] I think we've done the church a huge disservice when it comes to this incredible truth that Mitch just articulated.
[time=2985] And what I mean is this I've seen it since I was a kid and I bump into it still today. There is this mindset in Christianity.
[time=2993] I mean there are theological systems that are based around this idea. It is even snuck into our gospel presentation.
[time=3000] There is this idea within Christian culture that really this life here is all about just getting out of here and getting there.
[time=3010] We talk about, we talk about, "Hey, do you want to know how to get to heaven?"
[time=3016] I understand that's a good question to ask. And we have folks come and pray and they pray a prayer.
[time=3021] And then oftentimes the message they get, oftentimes the picture that gets painted is having come to faith in Christ, pack your bag.
[time=3028] Go sit on the bench and wait. And someday we'll get out of here.
[time=3035] Heard a guy in a tape this last week liking it to the waiting room at a Denny's.
[time=3042] Just hoping the God you'd die before you have to go in there and eat.
[time=3047] And it's this idea that I'm saved and I've got my ticket.
[time=3055] And I just want out.
[time=3059] And it is so wrong. It is so against the picture that he paints for us.
[time=3067] I believe with all my heart that he wants to come and reside in relationship with you.
[time=3073] I believe with all my heart he wants to come into your life and mind today.
[time=3077] And make a difference today. He wants to bring passion and purpose to your life today.
[time=3083] It's not a waiting game. It's not a passive waiting like Mitzot. It's an active waiting.
[time=3089] And it's you and I looking for the opportunities that he gives us daily.
[time=3094] To come alongside someone in need. To come alongside one far from God.
[time=3098] To come alongside and offer love and presence or a home or a friendship to one who doesn't have one.
[time=3106] Every single day of our existence here he gives us the opportunity to live with passion and purpose.
[time=3114] And yet too many times we've got folks sitting around going you know what?
[time=3119] I've got my ticket. It's all going to burn.
[time=3124] And some glad morning I'll fly away.
[time=3129] And they miss. We miss this opportunity. This world right here in front of us.
[time=3135] That he wants to come and help you and I make a difference in.
[time=3139] And I want to fly away someday. Don't get me wrong. And I want to be with him someday. Don't get me wrong.
[time=3144] But this waiting, this waiting has got to be an active waiting.
[time=3148] This waiting has got to be a waiting with passion and purpose.
[time=3152] This is what he's called us to.
[time=3155] It's amazing to me. A few weeks ago I shared with you how this is the Thanksgiving section.
[time=3162] And Paul's letters have an opening and then they have a Thanksgiving section.
[time=3166] And verses two through ten are that Thanksgiving section.
[time=3169] And we started this Thanksgiving section of the letter with three things.
[time=3173] Three hallmarks of a fully surrendered church.
[time=3176] And that's a faith that works. A love that labors.
[time=3182] And a hope that endures.
[time=3184] And what's so interesting is that Paul bookends this section.
[time=3188] Remember this is where you find the most evident clues of what the letter is about when Paul writes.
[time=3192] And he bookends this section with this idea.
[time=3197] Turn to God for idols. That's faith that works.
[time=3201] Serve the living and true God. That's labor that loves.
[time=3204] Self-sacrificial agape. Copos. Serve that loves.
[time=3210] Hope that endures. That's a waiting. Jesus Christ.
[time=3217] And so I see that and I ask, "Well, why?" Well, we know that Timothy came back and told Paul, "Hey, they need this. They're concerned.
[time=3227] They're very confused about the second coming and what happens when people die." So I look at that and I say, "Well, what about 2,000 years later? What about today?"
[time=3239] Why are those three things so important today?
[time=3243] Why? Paul even closes every single chapter in this letter with this concept of hope and eternity in the second coming of Christ.
[time=3252] So why is it important to me today in Fort Wayne Indiana 2,000 years later?
[time=3258] It's because of sin and death.
[time=3261] I experienced something Friday, Susan. I did that I don't ever want to experience again.
[time=3267] We went to a funeral. The funeral was for a four-and-a-half-month-old infant.
[time=3274] A twin who died suddenly of sids.
[time=3279] And the twin was a nephew of our two dearest friends from high school.
[time=3284] When I got home Sunday, we got the message on a recorder and we just looked at each other and I just looked at each other and couldn't believe what we had just heard.
[time=3293] And at that funeral Sunday, I heard a wonderful, genuine hearted man preach
[time=3302] that there is only one hope. There is only one hope for that family, that loving family
[time=3309] to be reunited with that baby again, that life again.
[time=3314] And that's in Jesus Christ. There is no other hope.
[time=3319] There is no other confident assurance than in Him.
[time=3326] David, who lost a baby in a similar fashion, says in 2 Samuel 12, 23, I think.
[time=3337] He won't come back to me, but I'll return to Him.
[time=3343] And so I'd like you to stand and buy your heads and close your eyes.
[time=3350] And like you just think about these three images, this key or this picture
[time=3356] of turning that Kelly talked about, this serving, this getting dusty.
[time=3364] And for whom am I getting dusty? Because I'm serving somebody.
[time=3371] And then this picture of eagle's wings, of this glorious hope that maybe I have, maybe I don't. And that's what I want to just mention here briefly, is that in this room right now, there are two camps.
[time=3384] There are those who are in a living, vibrant, saving relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=3389] And there are those who are not.
[time=3393] And if you're in Christ, you know, I'd just like you to examine what these eight things that we've gone through and say, does my life look like that? Because just as Kelly said, as full surrender goes, when I see a way that my life isn't measuring up, maybe I'm not chasing down sinners, you know, I surrender that to God and say, OK, bring me somebody.
[time=3411] But if you're here today and you're outside of a living, vibrant, saving relationship with Jesus Christ, I want to give you a chance to draw a line in that dusty sand and put a stake in that ground and say, I surrender my life to you.
[time=3426] I want it to look like that. I want to turn to you.
[time=3431] And I bring my idols and I bring them. You hear, you take them.
[time=3436] And I want to serve you the living and true God that gets fleshed out and serving others.
[time=3440] And I want hope for eternity.
[time=3444] And if that's you right now, just pray with me. God, I surrender my life to you.
[time=3450] Jesus Christ is the only place where I can find forgiveness of sin, and hope eternal and abundant life like Kelly talked about on this Earth now that includes eternity.
[time=3464] Just surrender your heart to God.
[time=3469] And now, God, we know you hear these prayers and I just want to communicate one warning,
[time=3476] one caution.
[time=3479] If you think you're in a relationship with Jesus Christ and you're not doing so well on clicking off this little list that we just went through that Paul saw in a living and vibrant church.
[time=3491] And maybe your life has got caught in religion.
[time=3495] And maybe like Jesus says in Matthew 23, 13, maybe you keep people out of the kingdom
[time=3501] and you're not really in it yourself.
[time=3504] Maybe you got a heart of a Pharisee, a hard heart.
[time=3508] I ask you, as Paul would ask you, Jesus would ask you, examine that.
[time=3512] And if that's you, surrender that to a living, vibrant relationship with Jesus Christ that can go everywhere.
[time=3520] And now, God, we just express our love to you.
[time=3523] We thank you for your mercy, for your grace, for your forgiveness, God, for your wisdom, and that we can be in Christ no matter what car, what hallway, what conversation on the telephone, what internet, no matter what God.
[time=3537] The spirit of you can be lived out through us. God, may we get dusty for you.
[time=3543] And not for some idol. In Jesus' mighty name, in all God's people, said, amen.
[time=3567] God, amen.
