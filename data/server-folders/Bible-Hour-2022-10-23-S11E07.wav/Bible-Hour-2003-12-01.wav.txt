[time=436] - Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=448] It's so nice to be with you again.
[time=450] I wanna just tell you two things today.
[time=452] Number one, the message that you're gonna hear this morning is the first in what will more than likely be a three-part series that we've entitled Church Leadership 101.
[time=462] And I don't want the title to scare you away because I believe that in the second chapter of 1 Thessalonians, Paul very clearly lays out for us kind of a biblical model of good God-honoring leadership.
[time=476] But the fact of the matter is that you and I, in the situations that God's put us in, you as a parent, you as a teacher, you as a worker at your job, all of us have the opportunity every day to influence and to inspire, and that's what leadership really is.
[time=493] It's the opportunity you and I have every day to influence and inspire people toward what is right and good and true.
[time=501] And so as we work our way through this passage, I just hope that your heart will be open.
[time=506] Your mind would be sensitive to the opportunities, the many chances you and I get every day in the church, in the marketplace, in the home, in the neighborhood to influence.
[time=517] I hope it challenges you.
[time=519] I hope it shows you some things about you and the opportunities God's given you.
[time=524] I hope your leadership is grown.
[time=527] Hey, I also wanna just say this to you.
[time=529] I wanna invite you, many of you who watch the Bible Hour have your own church home, which is fantastic, and they may be doing it.
[time=537] Those churches, things on Christmas Eve.
[time=539] If you don't have anywhere to go Christmas Eve, I want you to know that a tradition has been established here and Christmas Eve at Blackhawk is an incredibly special time.
[time=550] A time of worship, a time of communion, a time to celebrate this amazing gift that God gave us.
[time=557] And so six o'clock p.m.
[time=559] right here in the worship center.
[time=561] On Christmas Eve, we will gather.
[time=563] And we would love for you to come.
[time=565] Bring your friends, bring your family, bring your kids.
[time=568] There's no child care provided that night.
[time=571] We all just pack in and have a real, real special night together.
[time=576] So come and join us Christmas Eve.
[time=578] Make your plans now, and we hope to see you then.
[time=589] Go ye, go ye.
[time=601] Hurly in the morning.
[time=608] I song shall rise to thee.
[time=615] Go ye, holy, holy.
[time=655] Go the darkness by me.
[time=662] Go ye, I am sinful.
[time=667] Go ye, holy, holy.
[time=683] There is none beside me.
[time=690] Perfecting power in love and purity.
[time=707] Go ye, holy, holy.
[time=714] Go ye, God Almighty.
[time=721] All I work shall praise thy name.
[time=727] In the earth and sky and sea.
[time=735] Go ye, holy, holy.
[time=741] Mercy, fall and mighty.
[time=748] Go ye, holy, holy.
[time=754] Mercy, fall and mighty.
[time=761] Go ye, holy, holy.
[time=846] Let the truth of God shine on us.
[time=855] Let your grace sparkle us.
[time=864] Let your love come over.
[time=873] [MUSIC - 1688 seconds]
[time=2583] Paul knew about heartache. Paul knew about heartache and suffering and had known many of failure. We've seen that in this study of 1 Thessalonians as we took those first couple of weeks and just looked at his life and where he had come from and what he had encountered. And he refers here in the text back to an incident in Acts chapter 16 where he talks about where they had come prior to coming to Thessalonians.
[time=2612] Coming to Thessalonica, they had been in a town called Philippi. And something had happened there. Something that really was common for Paul. And he reminds these people of what he had been in a sense born out of. Go back there if you would. Go to Acts 16.
[time=2630] Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts. Just before you get to the book of Romans, look at Acts chapter 16. We're going to look just at verses 16 to 24. I'm going to read through it and you just kind of follow along, will you?
[time=2641] Acts chapter 16, verse 16. Here we go. It happened that as we were going to the place of prayer, a slave girl having a spirit of divination met us. Paul and his compadres bump into a gal who is demon possessed.
[time=2663] The enemy has come in and taken control of this gal. A slave girl having a spirit of divination met us, who was bringing her masters much profit by fortune telling. You follow that? A couple of guys are cashing in on her unfortunate state. She's able to tell the future with the spirit of divination. And so these two guys are using her. These two guys are exploiting her. These guys are making cash.
[time=2690] As she tells the future, she works for them. And it's going pretty well from what we can see.
[time=2698] Following after Paul and us, she kept crying out saying, "These men are bondservants of the Most High God who are proclaiming to you the way of salvation." That's what this gal is shouting.
[time=2710] She continued doing this for many days. And you can imagine what that must have been like. So Paul, after many days, I might have turned around after many hours. He's, I guess, somewhat patient. And after many days, he was greatly annoyed and turned and said to the spirit, didn't say it to the girl, didn't say it to the guys.
[time=2733] He turns and says to the spirit, "I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her." And it came out at that very moment, which was good news for her, not so good for the exploiters here.
[time=2747] But when her masters saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the authorities.
[time=2757] And when they had brought them to the chief magistrates, they said, "These men are throwing our city into confusion being Jews and our proclaim customs, which it is not lawful for us to accept or to observe being Romans.
[time=2771] The crowd rose up together against them and the chief magistrates tore their robes off them. This thing's getting out of control and proceeded to order them to be beaten with rods, large, long, four, five foot metal steel rods, when they had struck them with many blows."
[time=2792] They threw them into prison, commanding the jailer to guard them securely, and he having received such a command threw them into the inner prison that would have been solitary, and that day that would have been a pit.
[time=2807] With a cover, darkness, with stocks inside and in those stocks, they fastened their feet.
[time=2820] So now remind me again what they had been doing. They had been simply and only faithfully fulfilling that which God had called them to do.
[time=2832] They had been doing their best to lovingly lead and proclaim, and what they get is they get brutally beaten, treated shamefully and degradingly, all with the intent to humiliate and to intimidate and to belittle.
[time=2853] Some of you in the room this morning know this to be true that suffering and pain has a way of preparing and building up those who might someday truly lead.
[time=2867] Have you ever tasted that? Have you ever seen that? Have you had enough years? Have you had enough time go by where you can today just kind of recall and say, "My goodness, look what God did there."
[time=2885] That nobody understood. He or she certainly didn't. Look what they went through. Look what they endured. And now, look where, wow, can you do that? Can you come over here and go, "My goodness."
[time=2900] I mean, if we could have just not, I mean, but no, we just got to walk the road and you see today what he has shaped and formed in him or her.
[time=2913] We know a little bit of that in our family. I'll never forget it as long as I live, and it's good that I wouldn't.
[time=2924] There have been times when I wish I could, but Deborah and I had just been married, just a short while, and in my last year of seminary, and then right upon graduation, I had the utter privilege of working in my very first church.
[time=2942] It's about 110 people and me and a really good buddy. We just had the chance to kind of co-pastor and co-lead this little congregation north of L.A.
[time=2952] And boy, I was excited. And I was young and I hadn't been through much, but we just threw ourselves into this thing.
[time=2960] And Deborah and I, and my buddy and his wife and their family, we just did everything that we could to lovingly lead and teach and disciple and come alongside and serve.
[time=2972] And God, just for some reason, chose to honor that effort, and 110 people became 250, and before you knew it, 250 had become 400, and before you knew it were bumping 500 people, and you're just getting up every day going, "My goodness, I can't believe what we get to be apart."
[time=2989] And what we get to do, and these people, we get to love. And then a couple years into that stint, my buddy decided to go and be a pastor in some God forsaken place called Fort Wayne, Indiana, where it got really cold.
[time=3006] And so he came to this church called Black Hawk, something, I forget what it was, but he came in 1991. And we stayed.
[time=3016] Oh, we stayed, because we were so excited about what God had been doing. And we could think of nothing else, but just the privilege of being able to keep at it with these people.
[time=3027] It was all an amazing thing happened. When my buddy left, there were some powers that be, as they say, in this church.
[time=3039] There were some folks, and some of them were young, and some of them were middle of the road, and some of them were older, but there was this group of individuals.
[time=3049] And upon his departure and the realization that now there was going to need to be a church-wide decision on what to do with me, they just rallied the troops and decided that they were going to draw a line in the sand, and they wanted their church back.
[time=3067] You see, any time you journey from one ten to five hundred, there's always going to be some change. And see, I was the first then and now to raise my hand and say, you know what, I hadn't always managed that change.
[time=3081] Well, so now it was going to be my turn to pay for that.
[time=3087] And so they brought me before the church as a candidate for the senior pastor position, and there was to be a vote on a certain night, and I'll never forget this.
[time=3098] There was a band of them, and they decided to, and they got a hold of the membership roles at the church, and there were a couple hundred people on that membership role who didn't even attend the church anymore.
[time=3113] But these people knew them, and they got, and they got vans.
[time=3118] They got vans the night of the vote, and they went, and they bust them in to vote no.
[time=3128] And they all showed up, and I saw a room full of people I'd never seen before.
[time=3134] And I answered a few questions, and they asked me to leave, and they took the vote, and wasn't even close.
[time=3142] With the majority of the vote, they in essence then came to me and said, we don't want you, as our pastor here.
[time=3151] You can stay for as long as you need to, while you figure out what you and your wife are going to go do.
[time=3158] We just found out she was pregnant, by the way, with Russell T. And so I thought I'd play it cool and say thank you.
[time=3166] I didn't know what I was going to do, and that was on a Sunday night.
[time=3171] And so I went through that next week, and I just prepared to preach that next Sunday and tried my best in the midst of utter disappointment to begin to get ready for that next Sunday.
[time=3183] And that next Sunday, I remember walking up the stairs to my little office, and as I got there, the door was open.
[time=3190] And I walked into my office that Sunday morning, fifteen, twenty minutes before the service, and there were the seven deacons of the church in my office, standing behind the desk, looking at me.
[time=3205] And one of them, Wayne was his name, stepped forward and said, we've reconsidered, you're fired.
[time=3218] Have everything out of this office, by noon tomorrow.
[time=3223] That's it.
[time=3226] And they all just filed out.
[time=3231] And I grabbed the last guy and I said, hey, am I supposed to preach today?
[time=3235] And he says, if you want to, go ahead.
[time=3240] So I did.
[time=3243] And we got boxes that next day, and we packed up, didn't know where to go, what to do.
[time=3253] And I learned some things from that.
[time=3263] Don't ever give the deacons the keys to your office would be the first thing that I would put down on paper.
[time=3273] Secondly, I learned that every real leader, I learned that every leader who's really, really in it for the long haul, they really believe James 1.
[time=3292] They really believe that in the midst of every trial, you can consider it all joy, knowing the testing of your faith produces endurance.
[time=3301] And endurance, oh, let it have its perfect result, that you would be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.
[time=3309] I learned something there, that real leaders, they just don't give up, they just keep going after with God's help, which they've felt called to do.
[time=3319] I learned that there are people out there.
[time=3321] I learned it in those days there, that there really are people out there who, if you love them, and if you teach them as best you can,
[time=3329] and if you cast a compelling God-honoring vision, there really are people out there who want to do all that they can with God's help and with your help to make a real difference in their world.
[time=3343] And I learned that there are some who don't want to.
[time=3348] In that case, there were some who just wanted their church back, they just wanted things the way they were, and they would go to great lengths to get that done.
[time=3361] It was kind of interesting, it was a little scary, about four years ago next week, we had a vote here.
[time=3367] And you all were deciding if you wanted me to be your pastor, you didn't know all this then.
[time=3372] I mean, it was a very, it was a very nervous time for us. I mean, we felt real good about what God had been doing here, but we felt really good about what God had been doing there.
[time=3381] And I remember the elders asked me one night, on the vote thing, what percentage of the vote would you, Kelly, need in your heart to have from the people to say, yes, I said, well, like, what's the Constitution say?
[time=3396] And they said, well, the Constitution states the majority. And I said, well, 51 then. I'll just take it, you know, because I know you can't keep them all happy.
[time=3407] So 51 is fine, and I don't even know what it was, but would you agree with me today that God honoring leadership, those of you who would seek to with his help inspire and influence,
[time=3423] that oftentimes, we do that best. Oftentimes, we begin to do that better. Oftentimes, there comes a seasoning that's born only.
[time=3435] Amen? Out of trial and heartache and suffering.
[time=3441] And first Thessalonians 2, 1 to 12, is going to give us this picture of leadership that leads to this amazing culmination in verse 12 that I can't wait to get, but it begins with this guy who understood a little bit about.
[time=3452] Pain and suffering. And that's where leaders are born, whoever you are. Would you stand with me? Let's pray.
[time=3462] Father, thank you so very much for this church and this family. I thank you for the deacons and elders here in this place and the way in which they have loved, cared for, and been so kind to me and to Deborah and our family.
[time=3481] There's so many others here on our team. And for this family that graciously and lovingly continues to follow, God, I pray that we would lead well.
[time=3492] God, I pray that what we see here in this text in the weeks to come, God, that it would clearly establish for us a kind of living and a kind of leading that would make a difference in this world.
[time=3505] And God, that we would be a place that's about doing whatever we've got to do with your help in accordance with your truth to see this community that you've placed us in reached for you.
[time=3519] God, give us the strength to do that. God, we want to be a part of what you're doing. We want to do it your way. We want to do it with your heart and your spirit.
[time=3529] And so God, we will bring ourselves again to this place, Lord willing. And in the meantime, God, take these truths and build them and check them into our minds and our lives.
[time=3542] May we read back through even these verses again in the days to come, understanding more and more what it looks like to come alongside in a way that truly matters.
[time=3552] We ask all of this in your son's name. Amen.
