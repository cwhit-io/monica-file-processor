[time=60] (upbeat music) (singing in foreign language)
[time=90] (singing in foreign language) - If I could just echo that sentiment,
[time=117] glory to God in the highest.
[time=120] [AMEN] Says in Daniel, "Let the name of God be blessed forever and ever." And Daniel writes this in a situation that we find ourselves familiar again with this morning.
[time=135] Most of you I'm sure have heard of the capture of Saddam Hussein.
[time=140] And how interesting it is that a tyrannical evil ruler
[time=149] comes face to face with justice in a place actually in the same geographical place
[time=158] that a man named Nebuchadnezzar once came face to face with justice.
[time=165] And I say, and you say this morning, praise God for what has transpired and that has nothing to do with the party I vote for or the public officials I might align myself with.
[time=179] I just say praise God 'cause I don't like evil.
[time=181] And Daniel says it so well.
[time=184] Let the name of God be blessed forever and ever for wisdom and power belong to who?
[time=191] To God.
[time=192] Not to you and not to me and not to anybody who thinks they're powerful enough to do whatever they wanna do whenever they wanna do it.
[time=201] It is he Daniel says it is he God who changes the times in the epochs.
[time=206] He removes kings and establishes kings.
[time=210] He gives wisdom to wise men and knowledge to men of understanding it is he who reveals the profound and hidden things.
[time=218] He knows what is in the darkness.
[time=222] [AMEN] Would you bow with me and can we just pray this morning?
[time=225] God, we come before you today as a family, a group of people who are so grateful for who you are and the way you do what you do.
[time=238] The timing of it, it's so very confusing at times.
[time=242] We can look at this capture this morning and even go back a couple of years to September.
[time=247] And all of it, the hundreds of lives that have been lost,
[time=253] most certainly the lives that will be lost still yet in the future.
[time=258] And in our humanness, we don't understand it.
[time=261] And yet, God, we know that to stand for what is right is a good thing and that in time your hand moves and those who need to come face to face with justice and what is right, you, Father, the need to come face to face with you.
[time=281] God, it happens.
[time=283] And let us not forget this morning that it'll happen.
[time=287] It'll happen with every single person in this room.
[time=290] We will come someday face to face and what was in darkness will be revealed.
[time=297] And God, that those in this room this morning, God, that we would know you.
[time=301] God, that we would have surrendered our hearts and lives to you.
[time=304] God, we give to you this morning our praise, our voices,
[time=311] as best we can.
[time=312] God, we give our gifts now, knowing that you are a great God and that we are privileged to even have the opportunity to be a part of your work in this world.
[time=326] God, help us to be faithful with that which you've given us to do here.
[time=331] And we will continue to marvel at what you do abroad and in our hearts and lives here as well.
[time=338] And all the people agreed and said, amen.
[time=348] [MUSIC - 304 seconds]
[time=664] I have to share something with you all that I read this morning and I haven't been able to get it out of my mind.
[time=668] The psalmist says in Psalm 79, "Help us O God our Savior, for the glory of your name, deliver us and forgive us of our sins for your name's sake." The neat part that I noticed was that there are two requests made.
[time=685] One is a cry for help to God, and the other one is a cry for the forgiveness of sins.
[time=692] But the interesting part is that both of those had exceptions put on him.
[time=696] The psalmist didn't want help for his own personal gain, and they didn't want forgiveness of sins so that he had freedom from a life of troubles and a life of sorrow.
[time=706] He wanted help for the glory of God's name.
[time=710] And he wanted deliverance and forgiveness for the name of Jesus Christ, and the name of God the Father.
[time=718] And so many times when I look at my life and some of the requests that I make known to God, my motivation is sometimes so selfish.
[time=727] And I want things my way.
[time=730] And so I ask God in my name sometimes instead of in his name.
[time=735] And I really want to make today a day that changes the days ahead of me.
[time=741] And I want, from now on, to pray for things for the glory of God's name, and not for my own personal gain.
[time=749] And I was sharing this with the musicians this morning.
[time=751] I kind of let my imagination go with this and pictured our God in heaven and the heavenly hosts that surround him and all the saints and those who were there to worship him.
[time=762] And I look at the mercy that he's had on my life.
[time=764] And so many times when I fall short.
[time=766] And so many times I think that he died for me and me alone,
[time=772] but he really died for his own glory.
[time=774] And I think about the heavenly host looking down in this world and seeing me and you and the body just mess things up over and over again.
[time=783] And they look at God's mercy.
[time=785] And they don't say, "Thanks God for saving these people." They say, "Wow God, you are compassionate and you are gracious and you are slow to anger and rich in love and your love and do us forever." And look at the mercy that you've shown to your people.
[time=798] Let's stand together as a body and let's sing this chorus again.
[time=804] But instead of singing, "Oh come, let us adore them." Let's change the words and sing.
[time=808] We give you all the glory.
[time=810] Maybe close your eyes and do whatever it takes to fix your hearts on him and give him all the glory this morning.
[time=817] [MUSIC - 27 seconds]
[time=847] Just the voices.
[time=849] [MUSIC - 17 seconds]
[time=879] - We praise you Jesus Christ for the way you take
[time=888] a relationship that's separated.
[time=891] Our relationship with the Father has been ripped apart by our own doing.
[time=897] But you take that broken relationship and you've restored it Christ.
[time=901] You've died in our place while we were still sinners and made a path for us to access the Father and we give you all the glory.
[time=910] For you alone are worthy.
[time=912] We want our lives to be filled with you and the presence of you and the spirit of you.
[time=918] And we ask that we may be a light to the world around us God so that others may recognize this truth and give you glory as well.
[time=925] In Jesus' name we pray.
[time=929] [AMEN] You may be seated.
[time=931] (gentle music)
[time=948] (gentle music) - Let's sing this together.
[time=967] [MUSIC - 157 seconds]
[time=1129] - Father, we want to praise you and thank you
[time=1140] for touching us and loving us and being a God who is near and not far away.
[time=1144] Father, be near to us today as we open the word to study and learn more about who you are, and may it pierce our souls and change us to be more like you.
[time=1155] In Christ's name we pray all things, amen.
[time=1158] (gentle music) - Well, open your Bibles if you would to first Thessalonians.
[time=1168] First Thessalonians chapter two, we began to look at this passage last week.
[time=1173] Church Leadership 101 is what we entitled it.
[time=1177] Church Leadership 101, and just to review briefly for those of you that may not have been here last week, here's the deal, all right?
[time=1185] Timothy has come back to Paul with a report about what's been going on in Thessalonica.
[time=1192] As you know, Paul and Timothy established the church, gave themselves to these people, saw great things transpire and then Paul had to leave.
[time=1201] So Paul has left, now Timothy comes back and interacts with the people, sees what has transpired, sees what's going on and then comes and gives a report to Paul.
[time=1211] The report, as we mentioned last week, by and large, pretty healthy.
[time=1215] We see that in chapter one, but there had been those who had come into Thessalonica after Paul's departure, and they begin to attack the character and credibility of not only Paul himself, but his ministry.
[time=1229] There are those who have come into Thessalonica saying to those in that church this guy has done you wrong.
[time=1236] This guy isn't who you think he is.
[time=1238] And so Paul, unwillingly, yet forcibly, in a sense,
[time=1244] defends what God had done through him in that place and his defense of his ministry.
[time=1251] Paul answering his critics is what we see here in these first 12 verses of 1 Thessalonians chapter two.
[time=1258] As we looked at it last week, the way our passage here in chapter two breaks down.
[time=1264] We saw that it came in the form of three questions.
[time=1267] All right, and if you weren't here last week, you might want to kind of get this first one down.
[time=1272] Three questions, we looked at the first last week.
[time=1274] The first question we see asked in this defense of Paul's leadership is where do leaders come from?
[time=1284] If what this is, and it is about Godly, God honoring leadership, what we have here in Paul's defense is a picture that's been painted of God honoring leadership.
[time=1298] And as you look through there, and we talked about this last week, there is a whole lot for me.
[time=1302] There is a whole lot for those of us that give leadership in the church to read and to see and to consider.
[time=1309] But there is much for you as well.
[time=1311] Any of you who would be given the opportunity day after day to influence and inspire those of you who are moms and dads, those of you in the workplace, those of you with friends, we have opportunities daily to lead.
[time=1326] And what we see here is kind of a blueprint of God honoring leadership.
[time=1330] And the first thing we see is that God honoring leaders are born out of trial and suffering.
[time=1338] Where do leaders come from?
[time=1339] They are born, we said, and the scriptures indicate out of trial and suffering.
[time=1345] Paul references it there in verse one.
[time=1348] For you yourselves know, chapter two, verse one, that our coming to you was not in vain, but after we had already suffered and been mistreated in Philippi.
[time=1357] As you know, we had the boldness in our God to speak to you the gospel of God amid much opposition.
[time=1365] Paul shares with the readers in Thessalonica, his experience in Philippi.
[time=1371] We looked at that last week.
[time=1372] If you missed it, I'd encourage you to get the tape or the CD and listen to what he endured.
[time=1377] Listen to what took place.
[time=1379] Remind yourself of what this guy had been through, the beatings and the torture and the mistreatment.
[time=1386] And it wasn't just in Philippi, it was through his entire ministry.
[time=1389] I shared with you our experience at a little church out in Southern California.
[time=1394] Foothill Baptist was its name.
[time=1397] You know from your own experiences that leaders are often born out of their experiences of trial and suffering.
[time=1404] D.L. Moody said it.
[time=1406] We mentioned this to you last week.
[time=1408] Thought we'd show it to you again this morning.
[time=1410] D.L. Moody once said, "You feed the right man just enough heartache "and the right amount of failure.
[time=1415] "Mix it in with an enduring and hopeful spirit "and that man may by the grace of God change the world."
[time=1424] God-honoring leaders are born out of difficulty.
[time=1428] As the passage continues to unfold, we come to the second very important question.
[time=1433] And before we ask that one, I wanna just invite you, if you would, to read through this passage that we'll consider this morning, verses three through six.
[time=1442] And again, in honor of God's word, would you please stand?
[time=1445] And as I read this, just follow along.
[time=1448] It says in 1 Thessalonians two, verses three through six for our exhortation, the way in which we came to you.
[time=1458] Our exhortation does not come from error or impurity or by way of deceit, but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God who examines our hearts, for we never came with flattering speech, as you know, nor with a pretext for greed, God is witness.
[time=1481] Nor did we seek glory from men, either from you or from others, even though as apostles of Christ, we might have asserted our authority.
[time=1490] Father, we come before you this morning and having just read those words, having seen again where we're headed in this passage, it is a reminder to every one of us that there is a way in which, God, you've called us to leave, there is a way in which, God, you are honored when we influence, and there is a way in which you aren't.
[time=1516] God, we can go down roads and we can give ourselves to things that detract, that take away from what would truly be honoring to you.
[time=1526] And so, God, I pray that as I do my best with your help to articulate and communicate this truth, God, that your spirit would in every heart and mind here, convict and remind and continue to paint a picture, God of your truth, and this way of leading, this way of loving, this way of pastoring that you've called us to, give us strength and courage to respond in a way that would honor you in your son's name we pray, amen.
[time=1558] You can be seated.
[time=1560] Question number two, the way we say it is this, what do God-honoring leaders avoid?
[time=1564] We've seen where God-honoring leaders come from.
[time=1567] What is it that God-honoring leaders avoid?
[time=1571] We'll see four of these things this morning.
[time=1573] Number one, we'll start there in verse three, deception.
[time=1577] Write it down there on your note sheet and let's look at this together, deception.
[time=1583] The God-honoring leader will avoid deception, verse three.
[time=1588] For our exhortation does not come from we see three things.
[time=1592] From error or impurity or by way of deceit.
[time=1597] People, the God-honoring leader is sincere.
[time=1600] The God-honoring leader is authentic.
[time=1604] Any leader who is going to honor God in his or her effort will be genuine.
[time=1611] You've seen that, you've experienced that.
[time=1617] You and I know what that's like when we bump into or come alongside or find ourselves in a situation with one who is giving leadership in those ways.
[time=1627] You see with a God-honoring leader what you see is what you get, no deception.
[time=1635] You don't leave an encounter with this person wondering or thinking, I wonder if he really cares.
[time=1642] You see, you don't leave an encounter with this individual.
[time=1647] Wondering to yourself, I wonder if what she said or what he said is really what they meant.
[time=1654] I wonder if it's really how they feel.
[time=1657] I wonder if he's really going to follow through with what he said.
[time=1661] You see this leader, this first Thessalonians 2 leader
[time=1667] is so very careful with the truth.
[time=1670] So able to be because of the character, because of the credibility, so able to be trusted.
[time=1678] You know Thessalonica wasn't the only place where Paul had his detractors.
[time=1684] Thessalonica was not the only place where they came in and tried to discredit his ministry.
[time=1689] Same thing happened in Corinth.
[time=1691] Look at 2 Corinthians chapter four.
[time=1693] You can turn there or it's going to be on the screen, I believe.
[time=1696] 2 Corinthians four verses one and two, Paul finds himself in the exact same situation.
[time=1702] They have come in and they have started to undermine who he was, what he did, how he ministered.
[time=1708] And so he just very clearly, very plainly says, therefore, since we have this ministry, since this is what we do, since we go where God leads us, preach and proclaim the truth so that some may come to Christ, therefore, since we have this ministry, as we received mercy, we do not lose heart.
[time=1726] And it says in verse two, but we have renounced the things hidden because of shame, not walking in craftiness or adulterating the Word of God.
[time=1737] Paul right there says, this is not about trickery, this is not about deceit, and there were those in that day who were crafty.
[time=1746] There were those in that day who twisted things, who adulterated, toyed with, messed with the scriptures.
[time=1757] It should send a shiver up your spine.
[time=1762] It really should for you and I to just even consider that, that there would be some who would twist this to get them to do what they wanted.
[time=1773] And Paul says, wait a minute, we didn't do that.
[time=1778] We weren't tricky, we were honest, and we didn't adulterate this, we held onto it, we proclaimed it accurately and lovingly and boldly.
[time=1791] Look what he says to Timothy, his young son in the faith, this young pastor friend of his who he had loved and invested so much in.
[time=1801] You can look at, this won't be on the screen, 1st Timothy 4, 1st Timothy 4, verses 11 and 12.
[time=1807] Just hear his heart as he communicates this to Timothy.
[time=1811] You can sense as he says it, this need for truthfulness, this need for honesty, this need for a lack of deception, prescribe and teach these things, verse 11.
[time=1824] And then in 12 he says, let no one, Timothy, let no one look down on your youthfulness, but rather in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith and in purity, show yourself an example of those who believe.
[time=1842] I was reminded this week of what it says in 1st Kings, chapter two, would you turn back there, look back to your Old Testament, back to 1st Kings.
[time=1851] 1st and 2nd Samuel and then 1st and 2nd Kings.
[time=1858] Go to 1st Kings, here we see David giving kind of his last charge, if you will, to his son Solomon, David's time has come.
[time=1868] And if ever, right, if ever there was a man who would have known now on his deathbed, the importance of sincerity, the importance of genuineness, the importance of leaving deception far from oneself, it would have been David, right?
[time=1885] David says in 1st Kings 2, verse one, as David's time to die drew near, he charged Solomon, his son, saying, every one of us in this room who's got a son or a daughter
[time=1901] would be good to be able to say this, communicate this, leave this in their hearts and minds.
[time=1908] He says, I am going the way of all the earth.
[time=1911] Be strong therefore and show yourself a man, keep the charge of the Lord your God to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, his commandments, his ordinances and his testimonies, according to what is written in the law of Moses that you may succeed in all that you do and wherever you turn, then verse four, so that the Lord may carry out his promise, which he spoke concerning me, saying, if your sons are careful of their way, to walk before me, not in deception, but in truth, with all their heart, not part of it, not some of it, but a fully surrendered heart, and with all their soul, then you shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel.
[time=1963] No deception, no deception, and I want you to look back there,
[time=1970] 1 Thessalonians 2, 3, just look at the three things, he just kind of lays it out there, it's kind of brief, but it's very powerful and there's lots for you and I to consider, our exhortation does not come from error or impurity or by way of deceit, here's how I want you to see this this morning, here's how I want you to understand this.
[time=1987] As you study those three phrases in the original language, what you see is a real clear distinction between the three, okay, he didn't come in error, that has to do with the way in which he handles this, this he brought to them with clarity, this he brought to them truthfully, this he gave to them, no holds barred, but he gave it to them honestly, right?
[time=2019] There was no error, that phrase there has to do with the handling of this.
[time=2024] The next phrase you see there in verse three has to do with impurity, not from error or impurity, impurity in the Greek has to do with the way he handled not so much this, but with this,
[time=2042] your and minds, members, our minds and our feet and our hands and what we do and where we go and what we consider and who we're with and all the stuff that goes on in that moral realm.
[time=2064] He said, I handled this with accuracy as best I can
[time=2070] and I lived among you not perfectly in that moral arena because we would know Paul to have been human like you and me, but the intent of my heart and the pattern of my life was that I conducted this with purity, a commitment to honor him and then he goes on thirdly and he says, or by way of deceit and it's a very interesting word in the Greek, it's a phrase that means it has to do with the tongue, but as you read about it, you realize that that phrase has to do with one who creates an environment around him or her, an environment of truth, an environment of character,
[time=2117] an environment of honesty and he says, there you go, I mean, I did my best to avoid deception and I avoided mishandling this, I did my best to avoid mishandling my mind and my body and its members, I did my best to speak truth and create an environment of honesty.
[time=2143] Next we see that God honoring leadership avoids flattery.
[time=2153] He went to great lengths to avoid deception.
[time=2156] Well, let me just say this before we go on.
[time=2161] Are you?
[time=2162] Am I?
[time=2168] I mean, are you really just asking again, are you going, are we going to great lengths?
[time=2176] Come on now, think with me.
[time=2181] Just you, you and your own world, you and your own mind, you and wherever it is you live, whatever it is you face, are you going to great lengths, stopping at nothing
[time=2193] to avoid deception?
[time=2199] It's a tricky one, it's a scary one
[time=2205] 'cause you and I both know how easy it can be.
[time=2211] And I would encourage you and I would pray that you would encourage me and that we would be a people who would stop at nothing to avoid any wrongdoing, any deception and the way we handle this
[time=2228] and the way we handle this and the way we handle this.
[time=2233] It's the mark of a God honoring Christ followers,
[time=2239] the mark of a God honoring leader.
[time=2241] Apply it where you will.
[time=2243] It's powerful truth.
[time=2244] He goes on and says they avoided flattery.
[time=2248] Flattery, but just as we have been verse four, but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God who examines our hearts and then the first part of five, for we never came with flattering speech.
[time=2266] Look closely, would you, at those words?
[time=2270] It was so interesting reading this week a commentary by a gentleman named Leon Morris and he writes just real briefly, it was so insightful and it was so, is this cool to see how it works?
[time=2284] Verse four, in a very powerful way, refutes the accusations of verse three.
[time=2292] What's on the screen?
[time=2292] Four is on the screen, so good.
[time=2294] Look at four on the screen and then watch how four refutes three and if you've got your bibles, look back and forth with me at four and three, watch this.
[time=2302] Paul's preaching didn't come from error.
[time=2306] Paul's leadership, his shepherding, didn't come from error, first part of verse three, right?
[time=2313] God had entrusted him with the message.
[time=2317] First part of verse four.
[time=2320] Paul wasn't characterized by impurity, middle part of verse three.
[time=2324] He'd been approved by God, middle part of verse four.
[time=2329] He wasn't about deceiving people, end of verse three, he was consumed with pleasing God, not man.
[time=2339] Last part of verse four, it all just begins to unfold there.
[time=2345] He avoids, he avoids flattery.
[time=2349] He avoids flattery.
[time=2352] Hey, what's flattery?
[time=2355] Think about that with me for a minute.
[time=2357] What's flattery?
[time=2358] Well, how would we define that?
[time=2361] How would we articulate that?
[time=2363] What is flattery?
[time=2364] Flattery is speech offered, one definition might be this, speech offered with one intent and pretty much one intent only, that being to keep everyone pleased.
[time=2378] To keep everyone pleased, the one who flatters is saying whatever needs to be said in order to keep the others, whoever they might be, on his side.
[time=2391] Does that make sense?
[time=2393] You know what, flattery is so very connected with flattery.
[time=2398] And I know because I struggle with this, you may or you may not, I do.
[time=2404] Flattery is connected with insecurity.
[time=2407] Insecurity, that's right.
[time=2410] The insecure people pleaser is the one who at times has to be careful with this issue of flattery.
[time=2420] The people pleaser.
[time=2422] Anybody here a people pleaser?
[time=2423] No, somebody who's a people pleaser?
[time=2425] Yeah, yep.
[time=2426] The rest of you who didn't raise your hand, we don't care what you think.
[time=2430] We wish we could say that, but no, we deeply care.
[time=2434] That's why hardly anybody raised their hands.
[time=2437] The one who wants both sides happy, happy with the decision.
[time=2440] Yeah, don't miss this.
[time=2440] The people pleaser, he or she is very much wanting you to be happy with the decision, but don't be fooled.
[time=2447] They are much more interested in you being happy with them.
[time=2452] They want desperately to be liked.
[time=2455] And that can be a decent quality.
[time=2458] It can in the life of a leader at times though get very unhealthy, very dangerous.
[time=2465] Flattery, insecurity, people pleasing.
[time=2468] Our passage here reminds us that a good God honoring leader pleases God first and foremost, pursues God's goals first, God's truth, God's principles first, not man's.
[time=2482] Now a word of caution to some of you.
[time=2486] That doesn't mean that you have the right to be abrasive.
[time=2491] You with me?
[time=2493] There are some I know who kind of have this as their mantra.
[time=2496] I live and I speak to an audience of one they say.
[time=2501] And because all they care about is what God thinks, they speak and they act and they do things sometimes in ways that are incredibly insensitive.
[time=2510] This is not this truth here about Flattery.
[time=2513] This is not a free pass to be a jerk.
[time=2516] All right?
[time=2519] This is not a free pass for me as a leader because all I care about is pleasing God.
[time=2523] That doesn't mean I don't live with you and lead you and love you in a way that would be sensitive or caring.
[time=2531] Same with you, your kids, your friends,
[time=2537] those situations where you lead.
[time=2539] Doesn't mean you get to be abrasive but it does, don't miss this as well, clarify what must always be the primary intent.
[time=2550] Please an honor and listen to him, do his agenda first.
[time=2555] And you've got to understand and I think most of you do how very freeing that is for a person, for instance in my shoes who lives in the world that I live in, as I think about our team and I think about the men and women here who give leadership when we read this, though it's challenging and though we have to keep things in perspective because sometimes there are those of us prone to wanting to please, this really is very, very freeing.
[time=2587] It reminds me this morning that I'm not leading in order to keep people in these seats.
[time=2595] Do you understand that?
[time=2598] We don't lead in order to keep people in the seats pleased and approving of each and every decision made.
[time=2609] Do I in my heart long for my leadership to be connected to what he's doing and that as that plays out that you would be honored and encouraged by that, absolutely.
[time=2620] But I don't lead for that primarily.
[time=2623] I'm not leading in order to keep big givers giving.
[time=2627] I'm not leading in order to keep opinionated members on my side or in my corner.
[time=2632] I'm not leading in order to keep the complimentary emails and the complimentary cards and letters coming.
[time=2640] Do I want givers to give?
[time=2641] Do I desire opinionated members to be thankful and gracious for the things that God's doing?
[time=2647] Do I love getting letters and emails that are nice?
[time=2652] Yes, I do, we do.
[time=2655] But we don't lead for that, right?
[time=2660] You would want, and the scriptures would teach and he would want us to lead in a way and in a fashion that's consistent with and directly connected to his agenda.
[time=2672] A great leader, I just read it this week.
[time=2679] One said I have absolutely no idea what the secret of success is, but I have come face to face with the secret of failure.
[time=2686] Try and keep everybody happy.
[time=2688] Can't do it.
[time=2692] And so you do your best with wise counsel and the scriptures and that sense of God's leading, you do your best to lead and you hope and you pray that God would use that to further what he's about, not what you're about, not what you're about and not what you're about, but what he's about.
[time=2712] He avoids, Paul says he avoids deception, he avoids flattery.
[time=2718] And number three, you can write this down, he avoids greed.
[time=2723] He avoids greed, verse five.
[time=2726] Before we never came with flattering speech, as you know, nor with a pretext for greed, God is witness, greed.
[time=2735] Remember what it says in Proverbs 11.4.
[time=2739] You can write that reference down, Proverbs 11.4 says riches do not profit in the day of wrath, you understand that, right?
[time=2745] A day of wrath is coming, a day of judgment is coming, there will be a day, a real day, people, right?
[time=2753] There will be a day when you and I, whoever you are, wherever you've been, whatever choices we've made, there will be a day when we stand before him.
[time=2763] And on that day, the writer of Proverbs reminds us, riches do not profit.
[time=2771] The one thing riches have done up until that day in the minds of so many, they will not do.
[time=2777] They will not profit on that day of wrath, but righteousness delivers, it says.
[time=2784] But righteousness delivers from death.
[time=2786] Verse six, the righteousness of the upright will deliver them, but the treacherous will be caught by their own greed.
[time=2794] Greed, write this down, the craving to have more, the craving to have more than one needs.
[time=2802] Because I read that this week, as I interacted with the meaning of that word, literally.
[time=2808] As I read that first part, my mind just kind of said, yeah, that makes sense, I've heard that so many times in the past, and I believe that to be true, greed is the craving to have more than one needs, but then it kept going.
[time=2819] And to be honest with you, it was kind of a new slant I'd not picked up on in the past, and I share it with you this morning.
[time=2825] It's not only the craving to have more than one needs, but then watch how it goes on.
[time=2828] And in the end, the craving to possess and have for oneself what belongs to someone else.
[time=2837] And isn't that so true about greed?
[time=2844] You and I wanting more than we need, but really as it plays itself out, we end up inevitably wanting something more, something over here that we're convinced, God missed this one, because they have it, whatever it is, and I don't, and I want it.
[time=2865] And so I go after it, and I scheme about it, and I think about it, and I dwell on it, and I'm preoccupied with it.
[time=2871] And I want it, what they have, what she owns, what he drives, where they live, where they shop.
[time=2886] 'Cause I'm convinced in my heart that somehow I deserve it, and they don't.
[time=2892] Greed.
[time=2893] Usually, we think of it in terms of money,
[time=2899] cash, right?
[time=2900] Assets.
[time=2902] And yes, it's so very applicable in that arena.
[time=2905] Understand this, that in the context of our study this morning, as we look at church leadership primarily, all right?
[time=2914] This is so very important for me, and for those of us who lead to wrestle with, so very important for you to understand this, that I'm about to say, because we need your accountability, we need your encouragement, we need you, I need you to pray for me, and for those of us that lead on this front, because a lot of times in this situation, it's not necessarily about money, though it can be,
[time=2942] understand that in the world of church leadership, greed can take many a form.
[time=2947] We can be, as leaders, tempted to want more results.
[time=2952] We can, as leaders, be tempted to want more,
[time=2959] more numbers, bigger budgets, more facilities, bigger buildings, more praise, more popularity in this city of churches.
[time=2978] You may or may not be surprised, I don't know.
[time=2984] And I am as guilty as the next on this.
[time=2989] But I tell you, you sit down with ministry people at a lunch here or there.
[time=2997] And though it might not come out, you know, and sometimes it does, though it might not come out, every one of us within five minutes is either thinking or actually asking.
[time=3009] So how many you're running these days?
[time=3015] It's true.
[time=3018] How many have you got coming on Sunday?
[time=3021] And you know, we always ask it with this look of, boy, I hope it's a lot.
[time=3025] How's your giving?
[time=3028] Are you giving good these days?
[time=3030] How's your budget?
[time=3031] And the questions, they just kind of fly back and forth sometimes.
[time=3036] Any new building campaigns on the horizon for you?
[time=3039] It's got doing great things.
[time=3041] Do you hear that last statement I just made?
[time=3045] See how that slides in there?
[time=3048] That is such a lie.
[time=3051] And I think it sometimes, I won't speak for you, but sometimes we get trapped in that thinking.
[time=3058] I just connected God doing great things with numbers on an attendance sheet.
[time=3065] We can begin to connect God doing great things with building programs and brick and mortar.
[time=3073] We can begin to connect God doing great things with dollar amounts in offering plates.
[time=3082] And I got to shake my head and kind of step back and be reminded people, God doing great things is connected with this thing called fruit.
[time=3091] Fruit, fruit, translated, changed lives.
[time=3098] The transforming power of God that takes place
[time=3104] when you and I are faithful to proclaim this, teach this, model this, live this out, encourage others with it, come along those in our family with loving and accepting arms when we love Him with all of our heart when we preach this as best we can, when we give ourselves to each other, when we are a family of those committed to being filled by the Spirit of God and reaching out to those still on their spiritual journey when we do our best, inspired by Him to do those things well, lives get changed.
[time=3140] And it is the transforming work of God in a life, a family being brought back together.
[time=3146] An individual who was once lost and far from God now in a fully surrendered relationship with God who's now patient instead of impatient, self-controlled instead of out of control, hungering and thirsting for God's word.
[time=3161] And I have to remind myself and maybe you need to remind yourselves at times that the kingdom of God remember people advances one life at a time.
[time=3172] And if you and I are faithful to do this, if we are faithful to do that which He has called us to do, then you know what?
[time=3180] It is a good thing.
[time=3184] If as we do that and we encounter folks and the Spirit of God's at work here and in other places, if the chapel grows, if pathway community church grows, if gravel missionary grows, if grace point grows, if thousands and thousands of people flock to Calvary Temple or Brookside, we can all with one voice in a resound heart say, praise God.
[time=3214] Because what we're trying to be about here, we're trying to be leaders and we're trying to be people who aren't in any way connected to this thing called greed that says, I want it all here.
[time=3227] I want it all here meaning, I want it all here
[time=3233] and I want what's going on here to be connected with me.
[time=3236] And so we got to be really, really careful.
[time=3241] Really, really careful.
[time=3243] Look at the text.
[time=3246] He says, there was no pretext for greed.
[time=3250] I'm a friend of mine this week pointed this out for me.
[time=3254] No cloak, no covering, no effort was made to cover up a false intent in order to extort money, success, praise or affection.
[time=3267] And let's just be real clear this morning as we wrap it up.
[time=3272] I want nothing from you.
[time=3275] I personally, I want primarily, I want nothing from you.
[time=3282] I want you to honor him.
[time=3288] I want you to love and praise him with all your heart.
[time=3292] I want you to serve him passionately.
[time=3295] And if you do that, if I do that, if that's the way we go about that, he'll do whatever he's gonna do with numbers.
[time=3306] And he will take care of the things that need to be tended to.
[time=3312] You and I have got to avoid deception.
[time=3316] We've got to avoid flattery.
[time=3317] We've got to stay far, far away from greed, greed of all kinds.
[time=3322] And then lastly, and we'll get to this in our next time together, he avoids this godly leader over authority.
[time=3331] I don't think it's a word, I just made it up, sorry.
[time=3334] He avoids over authority.
[time=3338] This godly leader doesn't overdo the authority thing.
[time=3343] And you can see that there in chapter two, verse six.
[time=3348] Nor did we seek glory from men, either from you or from others, even though as apostles of Christ, we might have asserted our authority.
[time=3359] For the God-honoring leader, this isn't about him.
[time=3363] He doesn't carry a big stick.
[time=3367] He exercises a humble spirit, right?
[time=3372] A god-honoring leader doesn't demand respect or submission, he earns it through sacrifice and kindness, no intimidation, no manipulation.
[time=3387] And around here, we try, we work at this, we really do.
[time=3395] I guess we're not gonna get to this next week.
[time=3396] I guess I'm gonna just keep going, aren't I?
[time=3399] We're almost done.
[time=3400] We try so hard.
[time=3402] We don't always get there.
[time=3404] But I want you to know that it's something that we talk about, it's something that we are mindful of.
[time=3410] We try to never say the words in charge.
[time=3415] I'm not in charge of anybody.
[time=3419] We try to always draw that triangle of leadership.
[time=3426] And we try and always, we draw that triangle and there I am or whoever else is and all the folks that work with us and for us.
[time=3434] And then we just work really hard.
[time=3435] Every time we had the discussion to just take that triangle, just turn it upside down.
[time=3439] We aren't in charge of you.
[time=3442] We get the privilege of serving you.
[time=3445] The towels, the white towels are on our arms and we want nothing more than to do what we can to point you toward him.
[time=3456] The godly leader, you know, it's just not about him or her.
[time=3461] It's about him and doing everything we can with his help to move you and point you in that direction.
[time=3467] And the over authority thing, boy, that can be deadly.
[time=3472] You've seen it and I've seen it.
[time=3474] And we want to avoid it because we want to be a place that honors him.
[time=3479] Would you stand with me and can we just pray as we go?
[time=3487] Father, as we leave this morning, I know that there are some in the room who, like me, we've seen these words, we're so grateful for your truth.
[time=3494] We've made our way through a bit of this passage and we feel so, I feel so in process.
[time=3501] I feel God as if there is so much still to be done in me.
[time=3507] And I am so thankful for your patience with me, God, for your gracious, compassionate spirit.
[time=3514] And I pray that as we try to lead in this way, as we try to avoid these things, and we'll see in the future weeks here that which we will embrace as leaders, but God, as we move to avoid these things, we pray that your hand of strength and courage and blessing would be on that effort so that we could be honoring in the way that we influence and inspire.
[time=3534] God, thank you so much for this time together.
[time=3537] Bring us back together again soon, if that be your will, in your name we pray.
[time=3541] [AMEN] (upbeat music)
[time=3574] (upbeat music)
