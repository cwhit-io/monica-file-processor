[time=117] Father, holy, holy, the universe declares Your Majesty. You are holy, holy. You are
[time=134] holy, holy. To the Lord of your end, to the Lord of your end, to the Lord of your
[time=167] Lord of your end, to the Lord of your end. How do I come to you, holy God, ever true,
[time=194] and how am I not consumed by the fire, around me, wretched, poor, and blind,
[time=215] a fallen flesh am I? Through the blood of Jesus Christ, freely I am come, to heal
[time=237] the Lord of your end, to the Lord of your end, to the Lord of your end, to the Lord of your
[time=472] The first chapter of Matthew says that a virgin gave birth to a son and his name was
[time=480] called the Emmanuel, which means God with us.
[time=488] Father what a privilege, what an absolute privilege to have you with us.
[time=498] Christ said that even in the Old Testament, when the pillar of fire was there and when
[time=506] the cloud guided them and when Manafell from heaven and when Quail felt that it doesn't
[time=512] compare to having Christ with us, that your people had never known the presence of God
[time=523] until Jesus Christ himself humbled, humbled his rule over the earth and came to be with
[time=533] us.
[time=536] Father you came so that we would give glory and honor and praise and worship back to you,
[time=542] not just songs and not just disciplines but a whole lifestyle and everything we do and
[time=550] say and all of who we are that that would make you smile and that that would give you
[time=556] praise. Father as we sing be pleased with what you hear, may our hearts rejoice as we sing
[time=568] these words and don't let them just be lip serviced but God let us really worship you
[time=575] with our whole being as we sing and give you praise.
[time=586] Glory to God, glory to God in the highest, glory to God we sing, glory to God in the
[time=600] highest, peace on earth, there is hope for everyone tell the world that the saving
[time=620] King has come and his light is here for all who live in darkness and his love is here
[time=633] for all the broken heart and sing, glory to God, glory to God, glory to God in the highest,
[time=647] glory to God, glory to God, glory to God in the highest, glory to God in the highest,
[time=665] glory to God, glory to God in the highest.
[time=677] Jesus Messiah the promise fulfilled the hope of the world born for us and all who believe
[time=686] him and all who receive him are children born of God Jesus Messiah the promise fulfilled
[time=697] the hope of the world born for us and all who believe him and all who receive him.
[time=707] Glory to God, glory to God, glory to God in the highest, glory to God, glory to God
[time=725] in the highest, glory to God in the highest, glory to God in the highest, glory to God
[time=742] in the highest.
[time=760] We pray with me, God I just pray that every word that follows from here, that it would
[time=766] be yours and not mine, God make me weak so you can be strong, and God you brought every
[time=772] person here from a different journey, different set of circumstances, each person unique,
[time=779] and God I just pray that you speak to that person in the way that that person can listen in here.
[time=783] I love you, God, we thank you for who you are in Jesus name, amen.
[time=788] We're in a series on 1 Thessalonians entitled changed, entitled changed, and we're in kind
[time=795] of a mini series within that series on leadership in the church, 101, Kelly called it, church
[time=801] leadership 101.
[time=803] And so I just thought I'd start today by sharing with you a story of a change, of change.
[time=810] A guy the name of Ricky Lopez is in a federal penitentiary and he walks up to a guy named
[time=816] Dave and he says, Dave, I want to be your friend, I want to come alongside you, want
[time=822] to walk with you, and he said, but I want to tell you what the purpose is, Dave, Ricky
[time=828] says, I want to be your friend, I want to give you this Bible, and I want you to pursue a relationship with Jesus Christ because Jesus has a plan for you and he loves you.
[time=839] And Dave said, man, you don't know who you're talking to, because David come to prison about 10 years prior, and he was so renowned that other prisoners wanted to make names
[time=850] for themselves, and one prisoner slit him and cut his face, they said, like an envelope and it flipped open and it just missed an artery that would have otherwise killed him.
[time=859] See Dave was Dave Berkowitz.
[time=862] Dave Berkowitz was a postal worker in New York in '77 who would target brunettes and he
[time=870] would shoot them with 44 caliber handguns and then write about it flattering himself
[time=876] in the newspapers and New York just became mayhem of everybody in fear from the upper
[time=882] class to the lower class of this guy, of Dave Berkowitz.
[time=887] You and I will know Dave Berkowitz as the son of Sam.
[time=891] Well, Dave had been adopted in a Jewish home and he had an affinity for the occult that
[time=897] he couldn't describe, he was emotionally disturbed, he would prowl around at night as a kid growing
[time=903] up, sneaking out the fire escape, and went away for a little bit.
[time=908] After high school, came back, his friends are gone, he's just searching, he gets caught up in a satanic group, and Dave eventually started setting fires, he logged a journal
[time=918] 2000 of them, of the fires.
[time=921] He started throwing rocks over, overpasses just to see what it would do and they would smash into the car below, and he targeted and killed, as I said, brunette women.
[time=931] Well, Dave takes this Bible from Ricky Lopez, he says, "You don't know what you're talking to." And Ricky said to Dave, "Because you're Jewish, I'm going to suggest you start with the Psalms." So he does, and he reads Psalm 34, and he reads Psalm 18, and he hears for the first
[time=948] time in a way that he understood about forgiveness and grace, and he gets on his knees by his bed and he weeps, and he sobs, and Dave Berkowitz, the son of Sam, changes and surrender his
[time=958] life to the Savior and Lordship of Jesus Christ.
[time=963] And now, 16 years later, he's been discipled, he disciples, the words used to describe him
[time=974] are gentle and humble, he's the assistant chaplain in the prison, and he won't let anybody try
[time=980] to get him out.
[time=981] He said, "This is where I belong, I deserve justice, but God is using me here to change
[time=987] lives." So what is that leadership?
[time=990] What is that leadership of Ricky Lopez?
[time=992] What is the leadership that's changed that has transpired in the son of Sam and Dave Berkowitz?
[time=998] We're going to look at that today.
[time=999] And the first thing that we talked about in this series was where do leaders come from, and it is suffering.
[time=1005] We saw in verses one and two, leaders are born out of suffering.
[time=1009] My dad used to tell me that the strongest deal is made in the hottest fire.
[time=1014] And what do leaders avoid?
[time=1016] We saw four things that they avoid.
[time=1019] Deceit, Kelly talked about this, deceit, greed, flattery, and abuse of positional authority.
[time=1027] Deceit, greed, flattery, and abuse of positional authority.
[time=1032] What Paul has done in the way he has written this, is he's taken a set of scales like the scales of justice or the way you'd weigh gold or something, and he's tilted it one way, and he put on deceit.
[time=1043] He put on greed.
[time=1044] He put on flattery.
[time=1046] He put on abuse of positional authority.
[time=1049] And now one by one, he's going to contrast that with the opposite, and he's going to
[time=1055] start where he left off.
[time=1056] He goes one, two, three, four.
[time=1058] He's going to go four, three, two, one.
[time=1060] So he starts where he left off on the abuse of positional authority, and that's where he begins.
[time=1064] And we're going to see something here.
[time=1065] A vertical component to this, and a horizontal component to this.
[time=1069] We're going to see a heart condition that's affected in full surrender in my life with God, and we're going to see how that full surrender is lived out in life with others.
[time=1078] There's a vertical component, and there's a horizontal component, so let's just get right at it.
[time=1082] 1 Thessalonians 2, 7 through 12, I'll just read the entire passage.
[time=1086] But we were gentle among you, like a mother caring for her little children.
[time=1091] We loved you so much that we were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of God,
[time=1097] but our lives as well, because you had become so dear to us.
[time=1101] Surely you remember, brothers, our toil and hardship, we worked night and day in order not to be a burden to anyone while we preach the gospel of God to you.
[time=1111] You are our witnesses, and so is God of how holy, righteous, and blameless we were among
[time=1118] you who believed who fully surrendered.
[time=1121] For you know that we dealt with each of you as a father deals with his own children, encouraging, comforting, and urging you to live lives worthy of God who calls you into
[time=1134] his kingdom and his glory.
[time=1137] And so what we're going to do here is we're going to look at 2003 in our lives, each of us do a personal examination, kind of see where we are on this scales, this picture that
[time=1148] Paul is painting, and where we want to go in 2004, and the very first thing that we see is we want to move.
[time=1155] So if you want to draw a horizontal line, we're going to draw four of them.
[time=1159] We're going to move from an abuse of positional leadership, and we're going to move toward
[time=1167] number one, gentleness, gentleness, which is leadership by permission.
[time=1174] Now, there is authority leadership.
[time=1178] There is leadership by position, policemen, CEOs, parents, CEOs, different kinds of leadership
[time=1187] by position.
[time=1188] We're going to contrast an abuse of positional leadership.
[time=1192] With leadership by permission, I allow you to lead me.
[time=1196] In relationships, gentleness is how leadership is done.
[time=1201] It's done by permission.
[time=1203] I allow you to lead me.
[time=1206] Authority used in the NASB and burden in the NIV is borrows, B-A-R-O-S in the Greek, which
[time=1212] means weight.
[time=1213] It's a burden.
[time=1214] And in the culture, this is the way it was.
[time=1216] It's like it is today.
[time=1218] Remember in Thessalonica, they were dealing with people who had lorded over them, and that was the deal.
[time=1223] That was their cult, Cabrias.
[time=1227] Their cult was to get ahead, to lord it over.
[time=1229] When you get the upper hand, we're going to take advantage of you.
[time=1234] And he contrasts with that gentle, which the oldest manuscripts takes the word gentle,
[time=1240] E-I-P-I-O-I, and adds an end to it.
[time=1244] And it means infants.
[time=1245] Paul says, "I've come to you as an infant, gentle, caring and loving."
[time=1251] The word he uses for caring means to warm tenderly.
[time=1254] It's like a nursing mother.
[time=1255] In fact, I think the NASB talks about a nursing mother.
[time=1259] They were wet nurses in the day.
[time=1260] They would actually nurse children who were not their own.
[time=1263] And Paul says, "I'm not only doing that with you, I love you," like that wet nurse would love her real children.
[time=1270] Paul says, "I love you.
[time=1271] I care for you like that.
[time=1273] I have a nursing mother in my household." And I think about that when I read these words on how that care and that purity in that
[time=1282] love that my wife has for our daughter.
[time=1285] Well, he also says, "loving," and he uses a word for loving, not found very many places.
[time=1289] And it's H-O-M-E-I-R-O-M-A-I, Homer, Rome-A-I.
[time=1296] And in NASB it says, "So found an affection," and it's very rare.
[time=1299] And we've actually found it on a fourth century tomb of an infant and the parents use it to
[time=1305] describe and have inscribed on the tombstone are yearning for you.
[time=1310] We yearn for you, and Paul says, "I yearn for you in a way that I'll share my life with
[time=1317] you.
[time=1318] I'll share my life with you," so important.
[time=1322] Not just the gospel of God, which is his life, but my life, they come together.
[time=1328] See, Paul had changed.
[time=1329] Paul had changed from an abuse of positional authority to a leadership by permission kind
[time=1335] of guy.
[time=1336] The Jewish Pharisee, and he strictly adhered to Jewish customs.
[time=1340] He persecuted Christians due to his intensity.
[time=1342] We know that, right?
[time=1344] He did it so originally with a pure conscience.
[time=1347] He says that in Acts 23.1 and 2 Timothy 1.3.
[time=1350] He did it with a pure conscience.
[time=1354] He abused positional authority with a pure conscience, and he later refers to it in 1 Timothy 113 as blasphemy.
[time=1359] We're going to see that this is a hard issue, that's a life issue, that's a full surrender
[time=1366] issue.
[time=1367] I say that it's a hard issue because I find that I'm not going to move from abuse of positional authority to leadership by permission or gentleness until I want to.
[time=1378] I can pretend on the outside, but that isn't going to work.
[time=1383] I'm really not going to do this unless I want to, unless it flows from my heart, from my thoughts, my feelings, my choices, my prayers.
[time=1393] Paul says this is a hard issue, B in Ephesians 4-2.
[time=1396] He writes, "Be completely humble and gentle." Be completely humble and gentle.
[time=1401] Oswald Chambers says, "In a relationship with God, it's be, be, be, so he can, through me, do, do, do." And it's a life issue, it's horizontal.
[time=1410] Proverbs 15.1 says, "A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.
[time=1418] I've shared with you on how I've used this, but I want to share with you just a brief illustration on how it was used upon me.
[time=1425] My oldest daughter, Megan, is 13 years old when she was four, nine years ago.
[time=1431] I noticed from those four years with her that she was a strong, wild child.
[time=1437] And Megan would do at many times the opposite of what I would ask her to do.
[time=1443] So Dr. Dobson says, "When it's willful disobedience, draw that line in the sand, put that stake in the ground." And I had decided one night when I was giving her a bath and when I said, "Stand up," she would sit down and when I said, "Sit down," she would stand up.
[time=1454] That she was going to learn that there was a God in Israel.
[time=1459] So Megan willfully disobeys and I have just had it because she's been doing it all night
[time=1465] and she's got four-year pattern here and I come unglued with my words.
[time=1469] And I yell, I wish I could tell you this was before I was safe, but I yell, you know.
[time=1475] Well my wife's in the kitchen and she comes up the steps.
[time=1479] She knocks on the door of the bathroom, she opens it up and she says, "Mitch, Dr. Dobson's on the phone.
[time=1485] I want to know if he can interview you about your parenting skills and how great you are on his next show." And I started laughing, you know, and that's how it works.
[time=1496] You know that gentle answer can just, it is so powerful on what it does to a moment like
[time=1502] that.
[time=1503] Well it's not just a heart issue, it's not just a life issue and how I live it out with others.
[time=1507] It's a full surrender issue.
[time=1508] It comes down to this, God is gentle.
[time=1512] In a relationship, God is gentle, God leads by permission.
[time=1517] He invites you or calls you to a loving relationship with him.
[time=1521] He doesn't abuse his position of authority.
[time=1524] I don't mean he's not sovereign, I don't mean he's not infinitely powerful, I don't mean he didn't draw you to himself, I don't mean anything like that.
[time=1529] I'm talking about the gentleness of God because of the Bible says, "So Exodus 34, 6-8, God gets Moses on the mountain and he says, 'I'm gracious, I'm compassionate, I bend or stoop to those who are inferior to me.'" First Kings, 1912, he says to Elijah, "There's this earthquake, there's this wind, there's this fire and God's not in the earth, wind or fire." I always remember that because of the singing group.
[time=1550] God's not in the earthquake, the wind or the fire, but he's in a still small voice, a whisper.
[time=1558] In Matthew 11, 29, Jesus says, "I am gentle in heart." In Galatians 5, 22, 23, one of the mentions of the fruit of the Spirit is gentleness, gentleness.
[time=1571] There are many biblical references to our heavenly Father who commits the acts of a mother, just like Paul used, and Paul knows this, I believe.
[time=1579] For a long time, I have kept silent.
[time=1581] I've been quiet and held myself back, God writes through Isaiah, but now like a woman in childbirth, I cry out, I gasp and pant, Isaiah 42, 14.
[time=1591] And Isaiah 66, 13, "As a mother comforts her child, God says, 'So I will comfort you.'"
[time=1597] Jesus says in Matthew 23, 37, "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, I've longed to gather you under my wings, just
[time=1603] like a hen gathers her chicks, but you wouldn't let me."
[time=1609] In Luke 22, verses 25 and 26, the apostles are saying, "Oh, Jesus, who's going to be at the top of this pyramid scheme?
[time=1616] Who gets the highest position authority?
[time=1619] Who will get it, Jesus?
[time=1620] Tell us how this works, because they're in a culture where it gets lorded over them.
[time=1623] And Jesus says, "It's not like that." The Gentiles say, "Let's lord it over them." It's not like that with me, man.
[time=1630] It's not like that.
[time=1632] If you want to lead, serve.
[time=1635] Contrast that with Satan's lust for positional authority.
[time=1640] Peter says to Cornelius, this is Acts 10, 38, Acts 10, 38, Peter says to Cornelius how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and miraculous power and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him.
[time=1656] He uses a phrase, "Those who were under the power of the devil," the word, therefore, devil, the word, therefore, power would be translated oppressed very well.
[time=1666] In fact, N.E.S.B. says oppressed.
[time=1668] The Greek word is kata, dunisteo, kata, dunisteo, Acts 10, 38, the devil desires to oppress.
[time=1679] The devil, Satan, desires to do this.
[time=1682] So, what about me?
[time=1685] And what about you?
[time=1687] What I like you to do is just kind of have a line there in the middle because you're not going to be able to put this X I'm going to ask you to put in the middle.
[time=1693] But as you look at 2003, out of every ten times you encounter a thought or a feeling or a choice or a person, how would you describe yourself?
[time=1705] Are you characterized and known by efforts for the abuse of positional authority?
[time=1709] Are you looking for a title?
[time=1711] Are you looking for to be chair of a committee?
[time=1713] Are you looking for abuse of that as a parent in your household?
[time=1717] Are you looking for any kind of abuse of positional authority?
[time=1723] And let's just kind of say if you do that more than 50% of the time, if you do it 100% of the time you'd be here, so more than 50% you start coming this way wherever you are.
[time=1734] And let's just say that's 2003.
[time=1737] Now let's just say what's reasonable for me in 2004 and put an X there.
[time=1746] You know what?
[time=1747] I think two thirds of the time I can be gentle.
[time=1751] All right?
[time=1752] That's our first line.
[time=1754] You know what really has bothered me about the church and I'm guilty of this as well,
[time=1761] is that if you come to Christ and you're an abuser of positional authority, and 20 years
[time=1768] later, you're still an abuser of positional authority, I got to ask if you really come
[time=1775] to Christ because if you come to Christ, you will move toward the gentleness because he
[time=1783] is gentle.
[time=1784] If you are in Christ, you will lead by permission, others will ask you to lead them.
[time=1790] You will not abuse positional authority.
[time=1793] Same situation four weeks ago, my oldest daughter and Kelsey have set off my hot buttons and
[time=1800] we're on our way to school and I wish I could tell you this never happened.
[time=1805] But I thought about it and I deliberately chose to come unglued verbally and I yell at them
[time=1812] and I quench their little spirits.
[time=1816] I usually pray when I drop them off at school and I watch them walk out of the car and I
[time=1823] drove here and it's not sitting well with me and we had this time of prayer in this
[time=1829] room over here with the pastors and I just confessed it and I said I can't believe I
[time=1835] made a deliberate choice to lord it over them, the positional authority thing abuse.
[time=1840] And you know what, I sobbed.
[time=1844] I couldn't believe I did that and they prayed for me and they came alongside me and Steve
[time=1850] and Doug and particularly had some comforting words for me and my point is this, it hasn't
[time=1856] been nine years since I've done that but it happens less and I'm not a hero but as I
[time=1862] grow closer to Christ I want to be more like him.
[time=1867] I want to be more like him.
[time=1869] Well the first thing leader embraces is gentleness, leadership by permission of fully-stranded
[time=1875] leader embraces, gentleness, leadership by permission and avoids as Kelly said, an abusive positional authority.
[time=1881] Well second, if you want to look at verse nine, the leader embraces generosity.
[time=1891] All you remember brothers, our toil and hardship, we worked night and day, that's a phrase of the day because in the Hebrew culture the day began at 6 p.m.
[time=1902] So night was 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. day, 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. so we worked night and day in order
[time=1908] not to be a burden, key phrase here, not to be a burden to anyone while we preach the gospel of God to you.
[time=1914] They need to give willingly, greed, pleonexia, pleonexia in Greek which is covetousness.
[time=1922] And in their culture, they were in a culture of greed.
[time=1925] Are we in a culture today of greed?
[time=1927] Are we?
[time=1928] Yes.
[time=1929] This is so applicable.
[time=1931] Paul unites marketplace and ministry.
[time=1934] Paul unites marketplace and ministry and he talks about how he worked night and day
[time=1944] in the marketplace and out of his life in the marketplace, he preached the gospel.
[time=1951] Paul was a tent maker, Paul, tents were made of leather.
[time=1955] So Paul was probably a leather worker and did all kinds of leather working functions for people and as he would encounter them, he would preach the gospel, he takes marketplace and ministry and he does it like the Bible communicates it and they go together.
[time=1968] And what I found was so interesting is that he probably learned the tent making leather skill in rabbinical school because they taught the rabbis to be able to be self-supporting
[time=1980] financially in order to not have a financial burden on the people to whom they were teaching.
[time=1987] Powerful.
[time=1988] And so he says, "I preach the gospel, keruso, preach with my life." There's a sign in the choir room back here, keruso, it defines it.
[time=1997] It's communicating the gospel with my life, my life and God's communicated through me without
[time=2004] financial burden.
[time=2007] And it's a heart issue.
[time=2009] Generosity versus greed, it's a heart issue.
[time=2010] I need to want to be generous first, Ezekiel 33, 31, with their mouths they express devotion
[time=2017] but their hearts are greedy for unjust gain, unjust gain.
[time=2022] My heart is greedy and that's the way it is with greed, right?
[time=2026] People say whatever it takes to sound generous but they're really after something, unjust
[time=2032] gain.
[time=2033] In Luke 12, 15, this is a verse I have blown by, Ed emailed it to me a week ago and I just
[time=2041] heard it when Howie Hendrix was speaking the tape I was listening to and I thought, "I don't remember the Bible saying that." And you just kind of a tendency to blow by it because of the story it's in.
[time=2053] But Jesus says in Luke 12, 15, then He said to them, "Watch out, be on guard against all
[time=2059] kinds of greed, all kinds for money, for title, for position, for authority, all kinds, food,
[time=2065] alcohol, cocaine.
[time=2068] A man's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.
[time=2079] The Talmud says, "He that gives should never remember, he that receives should never forget."
[time=2087] Greed breeds dissension in my life with other people horizontally, generosity spawns harmony.
[time=2093] In Proverbs 28, 25, and 26, Greed breeds dissension.
[time=2097] It says, "A greedy man stirs up dissension, but he who trusts in the Lord will prosper."
[time=2103] Verse 26 says, "He who trusts in himself is a fool, but he who walks in wisdom is kept safe, wisdom, trusting God." See, I'm greedy because I don't trust God as the giver, trusting myself.
[time=2117] Generosity spawns harmony, Acts 20, 35, Paul wrote in everything I did, I showed you that by this kind of hard work, we must help the week that's the poor.
[time=2125] Remembering the words of the Lord Jesus himself, which we don't have in the gospels, but he got it from somewhere, said, "It is more blessed to receive," whoops, "It is more blessed to give than to receive." It really is.
[time=2138] It really is.
[time=2140] Proverbs 11, 25, "A generous man will prosper, he who refreshes others will himself be refreshed." I'm refreshed every time I give.
[time=2148] First Timothy 6, 18, 19, command them to do good, to be rich in good deeds, and to be
[time=2154] generous and willing to share like Paul shared his life in this way, they will lay up treasures for themselves as a firm foundation for the coming age so that they may take hold of this life that is truly life.
[time=2167] It's not just a hard issue, it's not just a life issue horizontally, it's a full surrender issue vertically.
[time=2173] God is generous.
[time=2177] First Chronicles 29, 14, David writes, "But who am I, and who are my people that we should be able to give as generously as this?" Well who are we to give as generously as this?
[time=2187] Everything comes from you, God, and we have given you only what comes from your hand.
[time=2191] And I only give to God what He's first given to me.
[time=2196] Holding back 90% seems a little different now.
[time=2199] "O Lord, our God, He goes on, as for all this abundance that we have provided for building you a temple for your holy name, it comes from your hand, and all of it belongs to you."
[time=2211] Jesus, God in the flesh, says Mark 10, 45, "I didn't come to be served.
[time=2216] I came to serve and give my life." Jesus says to the Pharisees who are full of greed in Matthew 23, Jesus says, "You know
[time=2226] what?
[time=2227] You're like a cup.
[time=2228] On the outside, you're really shiny and clean." Nobody ever tells you, "I'm greedy.
[time=2232] I'm greedy.
[time=2233] I'm going to give you." You're really shiny and clean, but inside you're full of greed and self-indulgence.
[time=2239] It's like Satan, 1 Peter 5, 8.
[time=2243] God is generous.
[time=2244] Satan is greedy.
[time=2246] All seeking to devour, the devil Satan is looking greedily for someone to devour.
[time=2254] And so what about you?
[time=2257] In your life and your encounter with people in 2003, eight times out of ten, six times out...
[time=2262] What is it?
[time=2263] Is it on the greed side or is it on the generous side?
[time=2265] Are you out for unjust gain?
[time=2267] Be honest.
[time=2268] Are you out for unjust gain?
[time=2270] Do you want title?
[time=2271] Do you want any more of anything?
[time=2274] More money, more things, more cars, more accolades of words from other people, whatever it is?
[time=2281] Just put wherever you are in 2003.
[time=2283] Where do you tip the scales, this picture of scales?
[time=2286] And I'm just picking them.
[time=2288] And then what would be reasonable for you in 2004, really?
[time=2294] Could you be more generous?
[time=2296] Could you give a higher percentage if that's what you want?
[time=2298] Could you give more of your time?
[time=2301] Could you be your greedy for your time?
[time=2302] Could you give more of your talent that gift God has given you?
[time=2305] Could you give more of your treasures?
[time=2306] It's up to you, to God.
[time=2309] Well, fully surrendered leadership not only avoids positional authority, abuse, and embraces
[time=2316] gentleness.
[time=2317] It not only avoids greed but embraces generosity.
[time=2323] It avoids flattery that Kelly talked about.
[time=2329] And therefore Paul talks about, it embraces authenticity.
[time=2334] Now authenticity, I would call, an easy way to understand it, it's big in the car world.
[time=2341] I think authenticity is reflecting the design of the designer.
[time=2347] Reflecting the design of the designer.
[time=2349] If I sell a car from 1925 to 1948, that's one of the classic cars made for the classes, not the masses, each one had this unique design.
[time=2358] And if I sell it and it's rebuilt later, not restored to the way it was, but rebuilt,
[time=2364] new different parts, different body shape, anything like that, it really, really detracts in the value of the car.
[time=2373] When you and I don't reflect the design of the designer, we really detract in our value.
[time=2382] Really not flattery, verse 10, you are witnesses and so is God of how holy, righteous, and
[time=2388] blameless we were among you who believed who fully surrendered.
[time=2393] Righteous, holy, righteous, and blameless.
[time=2397] If you look up authenticity in the dictionary, it'll say genuine, true, trustworthy.
[time=2402] Genuine is holy, true is righteous, trustworthy is blameless.
[time=2406] It says your witnesses of this, holy, totally other, Kelly, as described it as, it's three
[time=2413] things, holy, set aside, purified, signified.
[time=2417] If you want to write them down, set aside, purified, signified, signified, I'm revealing
[time=2423] the design of the designer.
[time=2425] God says be holy because I am holy, Leviticus 1144, and a whole bunch more places in the Bible.
[time=2431] This is right in God's eyes, and in NASB it says up rightly for righteous in the NIV.
[time=2438] It means right with God.
[time=2439] This is so, so moving.
[time=2442] Isaiah 64, 6 says my righteousness is like, what filthy rags?
[time=2448] Two verses later than it talks about, but I'm the potter, God says, and you're the clay, reflect the design of the designer.
[time=2457] One of those classic cars had a clay mold made of what it was going to look like when they built it.
[time=2464] God's clay mold of you and of me is our heart, and he continues to shape it, to mold it and
[time=2472] design it.
[time=2473] We're not just holy, not just righteous and authenticity, but we're blameless, we're trustworthy, and Paul calls the church in Ephesians to be holy and blameless.
[time=2482] Now this is a heart issue, this is a life issue, this is a full surrender issue.
[time=2486] It's a heart issue, Jesus says this in Luke 6, 45, the good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, the evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart, for out of the overflow of his heart the mouth speaks.
[time=2501] The Italian proverb says nothing can come out of a sack, but that which is in it.
[time=2507] Nothing can come out of a sack, but that which is in it.
[time=2512] Jesus said to the Pharisees again, pretenders, he says, "You whitewashed tombs, you hypocrites,
[time=2519] you actors." On the outside, you're really beautiful and you appear to be righteous.
[time=2527] Really look like that, maybe your words are that.
[time=2530] But inside, like a whitewashed tomb, are dead man's bones, and you're full of hypocrisy
[time=2537] and wickedness.
[time=2538] It's a heart issue.
[time=2540] Now think about authenticity and you're not, remember what Kelly said, nobody's getting a license to be rude, all right?
[time=2548] So authenticity doesn't give you some license to go tell everybody everything you want to tell them to be rude, all right?
[time=2553] This is for their benefit in their relationship with God, all of these for their benefit in their relationship with God.
[time=2558] So flattery, flattery, think about it, is for the recipients' disadvantage and for the
[time=2565] givers' advantage.
[time=2567] Also at Proverbs 29.5 says, "Whoever flatters his neighbor is spreading a net for his feet.
[time=2573] Whoever flatters his neighbor is spreading a net for his feet, he's going to catch you." Romans 16, 17 through 18 says, "I urge you brothers to watch out for those who cause divisions
[time=2582] and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned.
[time=2586] Keep away from them." Verse 18, "For such people are not serving our Lord Jesus Christ but their own appetites
[time=2593] by smooth talk and flattery." We deceive the minds of naive people, smooth talk and flattery.
[time=2603] And it's for the flatter's advantage.
[time=2605] Jude 1.16, these men are grumblers and fault-finders.
[time=2609] See, it's not going to, you can't be authentically a grumbler and a fault-finder.
[time=2613] They follow their own evil desires, they boast about themselves and flatter others for their own advantage.
[time=2620] It's not just a hard issue, not just a life issue, it's a full surrender issue because God is authentic, God is holy, God is righteous, God is blameless, God is not a flatter.
[time=2634] Psalm 31, 5, we can use authentic and substitute the word true.
[time=2637] David refers to the God of truth.
[time=2640] Jesus, full of grace and truth, John 1, 14 and 1, 17.
[time=2644] Jesus says, "Then you will know the truth when you come to me and the truth shall set you free." "I am the truth," Jesus said.
[time=2651] Jesus referred to the Holy Spirit and called him the spirit of truth.
[time=2656] It's very reflective of who God is in his heart, but Satan is a flatterer.
[time=2661] God is authentic and holy, Satan is unholy.
[time=2663] God is authentic and righteous, Satan is unrighteous.
[time=2666] God is authentic and blameless, trustworthy, Satan is full of blame and he's an accuser.
[time=2673] Revelation 12, 10, Satan is an accuser.
[time=2676] And Jesus calls him in John 844, "The Father of Lies." The Father of Lies.
[time=2682] So it's a full surrender issue.
[time=2685] To whom am I fully surrendering?
[time=2686] Really.
[time=2687] And so for you in 2003, as you look back, what were my words like, "Did I flatter?"
[time=2694] Eight times out of ten, two times out of ten, at home, at work with friends.
[time=2701] What did I do?
[time=2702] I just picked that X, wherever it is, 2003, based on something that was said to me after
[time=2708] first service, I want you to realize, you know, I'm a complimenter.
[time=2715] And so somebody else who came up and talked to me, I like to tell people about the genuine heartfelt good things I see in them from my heart.
[time=2723] That's not flattery.
[time=2724] That's authenticity because it's in my heart, I have an appreciation for the grace God has done in me and for what he's done in them and I want to communicate it.
[time=2732] It's expressing love.
[time=2735] Flattery would be for your own benefit.
[time=2737] How do you know when you're flattering and say, "Well, you're doing it for your own benefit.
[time=2740] You want to move up a corporate ladder.
[time=2742] You want to, you know, improve.
[time=2744] I want to think of a good, healthy way to say this." Taking advantage of your wife, guys.
[time=2751] So it's that kind of a thing.
[time=2753] Is it for their benefit and their relationship with God or is it for mine?
[time=2759] Well, a fully surrendered leader embraces not only gentleness, but avoids positional authority abuse.
[time=2764] This is leadership by permission.
[time=2767] Fully surrendered leader does not only embrace generosity, but avoids greed.
[time=2772] Fully surrendered leader not only embraces authenticity, holy righteous, blameless and avoids flattery.
[time=2779] Fourth and final thing.
[time=2781] And I think Paul's worked his way back to this as the core idea.
[time=2786] Paul talked about a fully surrendered leader avoids deceit and embraces integrity.
[time=2796] Very interesting if you look in a dictionary on what integrity means.
[time=2803] Integrity means complete.
[time=2805] It's all this work about being complete, wholeness, entireness, unbroken state.
[time=2812] In Hebrew the word is tomam, T-A-M-A-M, and that's what it means.
[time=2817] Complete.
[time=2818] He who began a good work and you will complete it.
[time=2821] In Christ I am complete, outside of Christ I am incomplete.
[time=2825] Trickery in the NIV or deceit in the NASB is Dolos, D-O-L-O-S, which originally referred
[time=2831] to catching fish with bait.
[time=2833] I'm going to bait you, and then inside every bait we know is a hook.
[time=2838] So I'm disguising the hook.
[time=2840] And that is what trickery or deceit Dolos is.
[time=2845] A father, and Paul uses a father as the description of what this is like, and a lot of us, many
[time=2852] of us have had poor relationships with fathers, and so this is tough for us.
[time=2856] But he uses it as a very good thing, because this is what it was designed to be.
[time=2860] A father in the Greco-Roman world was normally responsible for the education and the training of his children.
[time=2865] And Paul's communicating that that's all I'm trying to do with you, because I love you like a father.
[time=2871] And many of the families, we know this by John 922 and 1242, they were getting booted out of the synagogues.
[time=2877] If they were Jewish and they believed in Jesus, they were losing everything.
[time=2881] And they found family in Christ.
[time=2884] They found family and a brother and sister in a fully surrender relationship with Christ.
[time=2888] And you know what, I love my family.
[time=2890] I have good relationships with my family, but I have found relationships that are so deep to other fully surrendered believers, they're way beyond what just said, what a biological
[time=2903] family in and of itself can oftentimes give, powerful on the family picture here, community
[time=2912] in Christ.
[time=2913] So a father with integrity, we see his three things.
[time=2916] He's encouraging.
[time=2917] Pericaleo, this is, we're in verses 11 and 12, "For you know that we dealt with each of
[time=2923] you as a father deals with his own children, encouraging, comforting, and urging you to
[time=2930] live lives worthy of God who calls you into his kingdom and glory.
[time=2937] Pericaleo encouraging, it's exhorting in the NASB.
[time=2940] It means it was used in official letters when kings wanted to not be heavy handed, when they wanted to be soft.
[time=2947] And the readers know this, when they wanted to express a more friendly, less heavy handed tone, leadership by permission, not abuse of positional authority, they use that word for encourage.
[time=2957] Isn't that interesting?
[time=2960] Do not be afraid or do not be discouraged, but encouraged.
[time=2964] The Bible talks again and again, do not be discouraged.
[time=2966] In Joshua 1 9, it says, do not be afraid, do not be discouraged.
[time=2970] The Lord, your God will be with you wherever you go.
[time=2974] You don't need to be discouraged.
[time=2976] Staying or encouraging in the NASB is a monk or beside coming alongside speaking consolingly
[time=2983] its words of comfort.
[time=2986] Urging, he takes as the word witness, he's just said to our witnesses and he uses it again.
[time=2991] It's kind of a play on words, urge you, I urge you with my life.
[time=2994] It's the cognitive verb of witness.
[time=2995] I urge you, I martyr you with my life, sincerely connected to them and to God.
[time=3004] It's kind of an interesting concept here on that sincere.
[time=3011] It's not just a heart issue, it's not just a life issue.
[time=3016] It's a full surrender issue.
[time=3017] God is full of integrity.
[time=3019] God is complete in and of himself.
[time=3021] God is sovereign, theologians say.
[time=3023] First Chronicles 29-17, I know, my God, that you test the heart and are pleased with integrity.
[time=3031] Listen, complete David writes and give my son Solomon the whole hearted devotion, the complete
[time=3038] devotion, the full surrender.
[time=3042] The Vatican 1144, as I mentioned, God says, "Be holy because I am holy, be complete because I am complete and you're only going to be in complete with me." Jesus is called a man of integrity.
[time=3053] God as the Bible says in Psalm 68.5 is a father to the fatherless, a defender of widows.
[time=3059] God is and is holy dwelling, but Satan contrasted as a deceiver.
[time=3063] Deceit, flattery, greed, abuse of positional authority, all tools of a defeated being.
[time=3071] All tools of a defeated being.
[time=3073] If I buy into this, I'm actually buying into something that's a defeated being's tools.
[time=3081] So what about you?
[time=3083] 2003, 2004.
[time=3087] Look at it this way.
[time=3089] How many times put the X on there out of every ten times of encounters with people of life with others?
[time=3094] How many times, out of ten, am I incomplete in my responses?
[time=3104] This is so dangerous.
[time=3107] I asked an attorney once, I said, "Is it like this?
[time=3110] Do you have anybody coming in and telling you I got all these problems?" And it came from a guy that did this.
[time=3115] He took me aside and he said, "You know what?
[time=3116] Over the next ten years I'm taking everything from you." And here's step one, here's step two, and he goes down to step ten and here's exactly what I'm going to do.
[time=3125] He said, "No." It's always based on this.
[time=3129] So Deceit, it's the way a man told me out in Hershey, Pennsylvania, standing in a parking lot full of thousands of collector cars.
[time=3135] He was older and astute in the ways of the East and he says, "Mitchell, it's just like my grandmother always says, 'You never met a con, man, you didn't like.'"
[time=3145] Deceit is so dangerous.
[time=3147] Deceit is of the devil, Satan is a deceiver.
[time=3152] Revelation 20, "In the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur." Paul said to the sorcerer, "You are a child of the devil and an enemy of everything that is right.
[time=3163] You are full of all kinds of deceit and trickery." Acts 13, 10, "Well, what about you?
[time=3172] 2003, where do you want to go in 2004?"
[time=3178] You know, Paul closes this and we're going to close with this idea with the phrase in
[time=3185] verse 12, "Urging you to live lives worthy of God, worthy of God who calls you into his
[time=3194] kingdom and glory, worthy as Axios," Axios, A-X-I-O-S, "and it's a picture of scales."
[time=3203] And really what Paul has done with this whole passage is he's drawn an illustration of scales.
[time=3208] And he says, "You know, we try to tip them this way for our own benefit."
[time=3214] And now he's put, after he told you all those four things, he contrasted each one with what
[time=3220] brings it back over here for their benefit and their relationship with God.
[time=3224] That's what makes it that way.
[time=3226] And Paul says, "Who calls you, God who calls you, who invites you, who leads gently into
[time=3233] his kingdom, the effective reign of one's rule is a kingdom.
[time=3236] The effective reign of one's will is a kingdom.
[time=3239] And glory is the revelation of the character and presence of.
[time=3242] So he's taken the scales and here's what I think he's done.
[time=3254] Can you see what that is?
[time=3256] Can you?
[time=3258] That's a cross.
[time=3262] And what Paul has said, "Don't do this, side.
[time=3268] You can't, the ground is level because of the grace of Jesus Christ.
[time=3275] The ground is level at the foot of the cross.
[time=3278] Vertically reconciled with God and horizontally.
[time=3282] Don't do deceit.
[time=3284] Don't do flattery.
[time=3287] Don't do greed.
[time=3289] Don't do abuse of positional authority because it doesn't exist.
[time=3295] It doesn't exist.
[time=3296] You're going down a road that is empty, that is wrong, that you cannot do because Jesus
[time=3302] Christ in the ultimate clarity of God demonstrates, demonstrates that he is gentle at the cross.
[time=3312] He demonstrates that he is generous, gives his life not greedy.
[time=3320] He demonstrates that he is authentic, not a flatter.
[time=3325] He demonstrates that he is complete, that he has integrity.
[time=3330] The ultimate integrity of God in Jesus Christ at the cross.
[time=3336] He is not deceitful.
[time=3338] You can't do it.
[time=3339] It's empty.
[time=3341] He's paid the price.
[time=3343] So in 2004, what do you want to do?
[time=3347] You want to move from an abusive positional authority to gentleness, leadership by permission.
[time=3353] If you want to move from greed to generosity, if you want to move from flattery to embracing
[time=3361] authenticity, if you want to move from deceit to embracing integrity, and I believe this.
[time=3367] I believe this side, this side isn't leadership at all.
[time=3374] This side is manipulation.
[time=3377] This side is fully surrendered leadership.
[time=3380] But it's a heart-conditioned issue you've got to want to.
[time=3385] It's a life issue.
[time=3388] You have to live it out horizontally with others.
[time=3391] It's a full surrender issue because I fully surrender to God in Jesus Christ.
[time=3395] So you want to move in 2003 and 2004 that way, then you have to change the question.
[time=3403] What do fully surrendered leaders embrace to who do fully surrendered leaders embrace?
[time=3412] And you need to just grow in your intimacy with Jesus Christ in whatever that is for you.
[time=3417] You know what it is.
[time=3418] You know, because the Holy Spirit is convicted.
[time=3420] You know what these things are for you, abusive positional authority, greed, flattery, deceit.
[time=3425] You know what you're holding back.
[time=3428] And whatever it takes for you to let go of that, to grow in your relationship to embrace Jesus Christ.
[time=3434] Maybe for you it's to read through the Bible this year, four chapters a day, and you can get through the Bible in a year.
[time=3440] Maybe just do the New Testament.
[time=3442] Maybe you need to pray audibly with your wife at night.
[time=3446] Maybe you need to have some kind of a small group time with your kids and your family and let them see that it's natural and real.
[time=3453] Maybe you need to quit cheating on your taxes, on expense reports.
[time=3456] Maybe you need to surrender something that is that you're holding back.
[time=3459] You know what that is.
[time=3461] But fully surrendered leaders embrace Jesus Christ.
[time=3466] And when we worship Him with our lives, true, fully surrendered leadership is evangelism and it's discipleship.
[time=3473] And it's what Ricky Lopez did with David Berkowitz.
[time=3478] And it's what David Berkowitz is now doing with his life.
[time=3481] And it's what God intends for you and for me in 2004.
[time=3486] Let's pray.
[time=3489] And now God, we just surrender our lives to you.
[time=3491] We embrace you, God, for who you are, and we love you for your gentleness, for your generosity,
[time=3500] for your authenticity, for your integrity.
[time=3505] God reveal yourself in us and through us.
[time=3509] May it be so in 2004.
[time=3512] But may we resemble not the son of Sam, but the son of man.
[time=3521] And I remember the verse that meant so much to David Berkowitz.
[time=3528] The son sets you free.
[time=3530] You're free indeed.
[time=3531] You're free to be holy.
[time=3532] You're free to be righteous.
[time=3533] You're free to be blameless.
[time=3535] You're free to be encouraging.
[time=3537] You're free to be comforting.
[time=3538] You're free to urge others with your life.
[time=3542] We love you for who you are.
[time=3545] In Jesus' name and all God's people said, amen.
[time=3568] [AMEN]
[time=3598] in Jesus' name and all God's people said, amen.
