[time=161] Hi, it's good to have you with us again for those of you that are part of the Bible Our Family. We're thankful to get to spend this time with you again.
[time=170] For others of you maybe who are tuning in for the first time, my name is Kelly Bird and I get the privilege of serving as the senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=179] A couple of days ago, we lost a good friend here at Black Hawk. His name was Pete Smith.
[time=186] And the story behind Pete Smith is a story that reminds us, those of us here in this family, of why it is we do what we do.
[time=196] It was about four years ago and Pete didn't know the Lord. Pete didn't have a relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=204] Pete's wife Mary had come to faith. She had fully surrendered her heart and life just several months prior to this and was a part of our church and a part of our choir.
[time=217] And it was Christmas time, 1999 I believe. It was one of the final performances of our Christmas program that year and the weather was bad and Pete being the good husband that he was, decided to stay that night,
[time=230] sit through the performance so Mary could have a right home. And on that night, Pete Smith came to know Christ.
[time=238] Pete surrendered his heart and life, the gospel, the truth that God loved him, that God had sent his son to forgive Pete of his sins and that in a relationship with God,
[time=250] he could find life, he could find meaning, he could find purpose, he could most importantly have forgiveness of his sin. And Pete entered into that relationship and he began to grow.
[time=263] And we began to hear in this family just rejoice and celebrate this new life and this couple that now knew the Lord together and it was an amazing thing.
[time=274] Sickness came into the picture a couple of years ago and after a long, long battle, just a few days ago Pete, he died, but you know more than dying.
[time=287] He went to be with the Lord. He went to be in a place where there are no more tears. He went to be in a place where there's no more pain.
[time=294] He went to be in a place where there is no more sickness and today he's in the very presence of God. And though Mary and the family mourn his loss,
[time=305] they too are comforted by the fact that he's in heaven and someday they will be too and will all get to be together, those of us that know him.
[time=316] As I think about that, it just reminds me that that's why I get up every day. That's why we do what we do around here. That's why we give so much time and so much effort.
[time=328] That's why we plan and we pray and we try our best with His help to be a place that helps seeking people find and follow Christ.
[time=341] As you watch today, you'll see that we just took a Sunday, this past Sunday and we paused on our study of 1 Thessalonians and we revisited just some basic truths that we're trying our best to be so very committed to here.
[time=358] Truths that really mark us as a ministry. Truths that we try so very hard to be about and to give ourselves to. And so as we look at these three truths,
[time=370] these fundamental starting points for ministry and for life as this new year begins, my prayer and my hope is that you would open your heart and your mind to these things,
[time=381] that you would be maybe willing to consider their role, these three truths, their role in your life. And so watch and listen today and I pray the Spirit of God will speak to you.
[time=394] We're so very thankful for what He did in the life of Pete Smith and we're so very hopeful that He would be doing the same thing in your life as well.
[time=424] [MUSIC]
[time=437] For the wonderful Christ, for the wonderful Christ, for the wonderful Christ, for the wonderful Christ.
[time=455] For the wonderful Christ, for the wonderful Christ, for the wonderful Christ, all you gather here, by great strong ear to bless your name.
[time=477] [MUSIC - 94 seconds]
[time=590] As Corbin keeps playing, let me invite you if you would to just bow your heads. Close your eyes and just take a moment.
[time=601] We are so grateful for the opportunity we get to be here together this morning, lifting praise and thanks to Him and as we do so.
[time=616] And as we sing those last two songs, we're reminded that the cross of Christ is great sacrifice that He makes for you and for me.
[time=630] It bids us to come and die. And in the dying, in that coming to the end of you and me, it shows us that we can live, that we can have life.
[time=649] And then we sing, take all of me, take all of me. And I wonder this morning what it is in you. I wonder what it is in your life. I wonder what it is in your mind.
[time=668] I wonder what it is in your heart that you continue to this day to clutch so tightly, to hold on to so desperately.
[time=680] Some sin, some individual, some dream, some demand, whatever it might be. Would you this morning, would you in a setting like this?
[time=697] Would you at the beginning of yet another year? And would you in the light of all that we have sung and this truth that we have already been reminded of?
[time=710] Would you today be willing to let go, to fully and absolutely and completely surrender your heart and your life and your days as scary as that might seem to him?
[time=736] And I'm going to ask you just to think about that. I'm going to ask Corbin if he would just, along with the praise team, just sing prayerfully.
[time=747] And we'll just listen. If they would just sing that last chorus again, the end of that song, all of me, listen as they sing, would you today be willing to make this really and truly your prayer?
[time=763] [MUSIC] Here am I [MUSIC] I am only more than me [MUSIC] Take my life [MUSIC] Take my life [MUSIC] Take my life [MUSIC] I am only more than me [MUSIC] Take my life [MUSIC] Take my life [MUSIC] It's over me [MUSIC]
[time=825] Father, that is our prayer this morning.
[time=828] And I pray for those in this room who do need desperately to give you every part of them, every corner of their life, every compartment of their mind, so that we could truly and only then live.
[time=849] Thank you so much, God, for this great truth that we've already heard, this privilege of praise and worship to you, and we pray, God, your hand and your blessing on the remainder of our time together, and your son's name we pray.
[time=866] And all God's people said, amen.
[time=871] Well, it's good to see all of you. It's great to be back. We have had a great two weeks. Most of you know, every December, the last two weeks of the month.
[time=880] I just try my best to kind of clear my schedule and take off.
[time=884] And so these last two weeks, Deborah and I and the kids, and my mom was here for a week. We've just had a wonderful, wonderful couple of weeks, and it is so good to be back.
[time=894] And while I was vacationing at home with our family, doing the things that we do, and living the life that we live, and thinking so much about them, and thinking an awful lot about you as well, God really began to, over the course of the last couple of weeks, really put some things on my heart.
[time=918] And maybe you know how it is. You'll get up in the morning and you'll go to that spot that you go to when you spend time with him, or you'll sit down at night in that place where you go to fellowship and listen to what he may have to say to you.
[time=934] You spend time in his ward. And as I did that these last two weeks, there just was a clear sense that there were some things that we needed as a family to discuss and to think through.
[time=950] Good things. Things that we need to as a family be reminded of often. And I just felt like as the new year came and as we had the opportunity this morning to kind of kick that off, I thought we would just take a break for a Sunday.
[time=963] And our study of First Thessalonians, and just have a little heart to heart, you and me, and really give some thought. If you're open to it, and I hope that you would be, really give some thought to what this next year might hold.
[time=981] I have been in those times with him lately. I have been, I have been begging him. I have been absolutely begging him to continue to do what only, what only he can do.
[time=999] I have been begging him lately to continue to change and spiritually transform lives right here in our midst. And I don't know about you. I mean, I know most of you and how you feel about this and most of you know how I feel about this.
[time=1016] It's what gets me up every day. Him, Him spiritually changing me, Him transforming and growing my family, the Spirit of God and the Word of God and the people of God and how all of that comes together and people's lives get altered forever.
[time=1045] It's what gives me life. It's what gives me a reason. It's the most amazing thing to live out and get to be a part of. And I have been begging him lately to, in these coming weeks and months that we're about to face, I have been just humbly asking him if it would be his will.
[time=1072] And I don't know that it is. But that if it would be his will, that he would be gracious enough and that he would be patient enough with you and with me to continue to use us to, maybe in a way like never before, be a part of his work. See, he lets us do that, right?
[time=1092] He doesn't need us to spiritually and personally change and transform lives. But it's the way he decided to do it. He lets us be a part of this. And so I've just been, I've been begging him to allow us to be a part of that process at a level and to a degree like possibly like we've never seen before.
[time=1115] And as I think about that and as I've prayed about that and as I've listened to him, it just comes back to me again and again that there are some things that we would need to. You and I, if we're willing this morning to humbly sit before him and say, "Oh God, if you would will it to be so, would you, would you allow us to be a part here in this place of you transforming the lives of people at a rate and at a level?
[time=1144] Like never before, for you and I to be a part of that process, I'm reminded and like new and really fresh ways lately that there's some things that you and I would need to consider. There are some components, if you will, of your life and mine that we would need to kind of open up again.
[time=1165] There are some disciplines, there are some patterns, there are some mindsets that we would need to embrace and be given to, to really be a part of something of that nature.
[time=1182] Now something of that nature, you know what, it might not today sitting here in all honesty, it might not light your jets. You may not sit up in your seat when you hear me talking about an opportunity for us to be linked together in our hearts and partnering with God Almighty to see this community and this city and this place that God's put us in.
[time=1203] To think of it being changed radically and impacted by the truth that you may be already thinking about lunch, I don't know, but I don't think about lunch when that's the topic.
[time=1221] And lately he has just been burning that into my heart and my soul and so for whoever's here today, anybody who would be interested in giving themselves corporately, collectively and personally to a 12-month opportunity of that nature,
[time=1246] then there's just some things I felt like today we should consider. Really there's some questions I think we'd need to ask if you're okay with that.
[time=1257] There's some questions that I would need to ask of myself, there's some questions that we would need to ask of each other.
[time=1267] Three truths to consider this morning, if in fact that kind of a journey is something you would be interested in and why don't we just jump in, okay?
[time=1278] Three truths to consider, three questions to ask, let me just start with the first thing that over the last two weeks has been again and again and again and again impressed on my heart and mind.
[time=1289] Number one, your word, number one, your word, have I hid or treasured in my heart that I might not sin, that I may not sin against you.
[time=1306] Read that, look at that, so I'm 119. Your word, I have treasured in my heart that I may not sin against you.
[time=1325] You know the real impact of that is right there in and of itself, that is a powerful, powerful truth.
[time=1333] I'm always drawn to the two verses that come before that and if you've got your Bibles, this won't be on the screen but I just invite you to look back just at verses 9 and 10.
[time=1342] Because you see it says in 9 and 10, how can a young man keep his way pure by keeping it according to your word with all my heart?
[time=1354] I have sought you. Do not let me wander from your commandments. Your word, I have treasured. Your truth, I have hid.
[time=1365] Your word, I have stored in my heart that I may not sin against you. And here's the thought I've had, here's the prompting that's been there just again and again and again these last couple of weeks.
[time=1380] If we, if you and I, those of us that would be here in this room this morning, interested in really open to making a difference in this world that God's put us in.
[time=1392] If we are going to stand up to the onslaught of illicit, promiscuous, pornographic and immoral messages that this culture is absolutely attempting to cram down your throats.
[time=1413] Maybe I saw it more because I had some free time. Maybe I bumped into it more because I wasn't at work. I don't know but, and maybe I don't know how it impacts you but I'll tell you what, the last two weeks of my life at the mall,
[time=1427] the last two weeks of my life out and about, the last two weeks of my life listening to the airwaves, the last two weeks of my life with a little bit of extra free time to actually watch some things that come.
[time=1444] Unbelievable.
[time=1447] You know, it's one thing that they pulled the Abercrombie and Fitch catalog but then they broadcast it all over the world so we can see it anyway.
[time=1456] If we, if you and I are going to stand up to the onslaught of illicit, promiscuous, pornographic and immoral messages that this culture and the evil one is attempting to cram down your hearts.
[time=1472] Trying to cram down our throats and, and, and store deep in our hearts.
[time=1480] First nine, how can a young man keep his way pure?
[time=1485] Then I'll tell you what, we must be, we have to be.
[time=1489] You and I would then need to be absolutely consumed with the Scriptures.
[time=1498] You can write that down. We must be absolutely surrounded by the Scriptures.
[time=1505] We must be thoroughly and completely buried in the truths of God's Word.
[time=1515] And as I thought about it, here's the thought that comes to mind.
[time=1518] Just seeing, seeing what's out there, hearing what's on the airwaves, just walking through this culture of your horse in mind that we find ourselves in.
[time=1530] It dawns on me, you know what?
[time=1532] You're going to be consumed with something.
[time=1536] You and I are going to be buried with something.
[time=1541] There's just so much of it. It's just so blatant. It's just so persistent.
[time=1548] You can't help it. You're going to be buried with something.
[time=1555] And how can a young man, how can a young woman, how can we as faithful followers of Christ keep our way pure?
[time=1568] And you know what? I'm not really interested in just surviving the onslaught.
[time=1573] See, God's called us to make a difference.
[time=1577] God's called us to dent the onslaught. God's called us to stand in a way whereby the darkness gets pushed back.
[time=1588] And you know what? This is where I can just speak from my own experience.
[time=1594] I can show you a direct correlation in my own life.
[time=1601] The times at which I feel as if through the Spirit of God and the Word of God, the darkness gets pushed back in my life are the times when this is getting meditated on.
[time=1613] This is getting red. This is getting glanced at. This is getting sung. This is getting listened to.
[time=1620] It's everywhere in my life.
[time=1624] I've got the card on my laminated verse from Isaiah 54 on my dashboard right above the steering wheel.
[time=1633] I've got the CDs going in my truck. I've got the time in the morning. I've got the time during the day.
[time=1639] I've got the verses. I'm trying them. I mean, and some here this morning you might hear that and go, "Wow, dude, relax."
[time=1648] You're sounding a little scary, a little fanatical, a little on edge.
[time=1658] Maybe I am, but I'll tell you what, it's because of the times in my life
[time=1667] when the darkness hasn't been pushed back.
[time=1672] When choices get made, when roads get traveled, I can make a direct correlation in my own life.
[time=1682] When this isn't red, when this isn't meditated on, when this isn't studied, when this isn't glanced at, when this isn't sung, when this isn't listened to,
[time=1692] it's like I'm open, pray.
[time=1700] Just listen.
[time=1702] Just read these words with me. Psalm 119-24. Psalm 119 is a phenomenal chapter.
[time=1708] You should just sit down over the next few weeks and just kind of make your way through it.
[time=1712] It lifts up the value of God's Word, of the Scriptures.
[time=1718] Your testimonies also are my delight.
[time=1722] Are they for you?
[time=1724] They are my counselors.
[time=1726] We're just going to go ahead and just tear through these. Keep going.
[time=1728] Psalm 119-24. 30, "I have chosen the faithful way.
[time=1732] I have placed your ordinances before me." It goes on in 31 and says, "I cleave."
[time=1739] All right, cleave doesn't mean just hold on to. No, cleave means to clutch.
[time=1745] Cleave means to stranglehold the thing, and the psalmist says, "I cleave to your testimonies." Oh, Lord, do not put me to shame.
[time=1753] "I shall run the way of your commandments, for you will enlarge my heart."
[time=1759] Psalmist goes on later in Psalm 119 and verse 54, "Your statutes are my songs."
[time=1766] How about your songs?
[time=1770] I just got to ask.
[time=1774] What are you singing?
[time=1777] What are you listening to?
[time=1779] What are you filling your head and your heart with?
[time=1783] The psalmist says, "Your statutes, oh God, are my songs."
[time=1792] In the house of my pilgrimage, it goes on in 55 to say, "Oh, Lord, I remember your name and the night and keep your law." It is good for me. Try this one on.
[time=1803] It is good for me that I was afflicted, that I may learn your statutes.
[time=1808] And then in 72, the law of your mouth is better to me than thousands of gold and silver pieces.
[time=1819] I found another couple verses that just said so much to me, 92 and 93.
[time=1824] If your law had not been my delight, then I would have perished in my affliction.
[time=1830] I will never forget your precepts, for by them you have revived me.
[time=1837] And you know what?
[time=1838] There's people in this room this morning and you need to be revived.
[time=1843] There are people in this room this morning that are absolutely in the midst of perishing.
[time=1850] If your law had not been my delight, then I would have perished in my affliction.
[time=1857] And you're perishing this morning because something else is your delight.
[time=1863] You cleave more than likely to something else.
[time=1870] And so it just reminds me, and it just leads me to say to you all again.
[time=1875] And I'll say it again at some point, I'm sure, but we talked about this several months ago.
[time=1880] We talked about a commitment that you would make to just absolutely stop at nothing.
[time=1886] Students, middle schoolers, high school students, young adults, moms and dads, grandmas and grandpas.
[time=1892] We talked about you and I being willing to stop at nothing to spend that time with him each day.
[time=1899] Ten, ten, two, twenty is kind of how we just summarized it.
[time=1905] A commitment to just as you start out in this process.
[time=1909] A commitment to spend ten minutes in the morning or at night at some time when you can be alone.
[time=1915] To spend ten minutes with a notebook and a pen and your Bible.
[time=1920] Ten minutes in the book of Proverbs.
[time=1923] To just start there at the beginning and just spend about ten minutes just reading through slowly and prayerfully.
[time=1930] The things that God's truth has for you and me in this great book of wisdom, the book of Proverbs.
[time=1936] Ten minutes and as you go and as things jump out at you, as questions pop up, you write them down.
[time=1943] And then when ten minutes is up you go to the gospels, let's say, and you go to Matthew or Mark or Luke or John
[time=1949] and you start reading prayerfully and thoughtfully and just quietly and you've got your notebook
[time=1955] and you've got your pen and as you read through carefully and you read through maybe five, six, seven, eight verses.
[time=1962] Just asking God the whole time to just allow those words of life and truth to speak to you and as questions pop up, you write them down.
[time=1973] And then to take two minutes.
[time=1977] And that's not like hard and fast, it could be three or four or five.
[time=1980] But you could just then take two minutes and just close your Bible and close your notebook and then just pray.
[time=1985] Talk to God. Ask God for wisdom and courage to live out those truths you just read about.
[time=1992] Ask God to bring the people in your life but you need to help answer the questions you just wrote down.
[time=1998] Two minutes or three or four or five with him.
[time=2002] Asking him for guidance and direction and then ten, ten, two, twenty and then twenty seconds to just
[time=2009] move back over there and set that alarm for that same time the very next day.
[time=2017] There are some of you in the room this morning and you would be ready, not for ten, ten, two, twenty.
[time=2022] You would be ready and in need, some of you in this room this morning.
[time=2027] For twenty, twenty, five, twenty or twenty, twenty, ten, twenty, I mean you know,
[time=2034] there are some of us in the room this morning in your time with him.
[time=2038] You're at a point in your life and your walk with him where it could be, should be and can be extended.
[time=2045] But you've got to have it.
[time=2048] But the point is it can't just be the, it can't just be the, the thirty minutes.
[time=2053] Are you kidding me?
[time=2055] If all you and I give to this is thirty minutes and then we go out and spend twenty-three hours with the stuff that you're seeing and I'm hearing and we're bumping into good night.
[time=2068] Clean your clock, it'll lay you out, I don't care who you are.
[time=2073] And so it needs to be listened to, it needs to be read again, it needs to be on a card, it needs to be on a CD, it needs to be in your house at night, it needs to be part of the bedtime routine.
[time=2087] Question number one, are you fully surrendered to the truth?
[time=2092] Are you fully surrendered to the truth?
[time=2097] We'd better be.
[time=2099] And if you need help with that, ask who we would love to help you.
[time=2107] But if we're going to make a difference by the grace of God, through the Spirit of God, and if God were to will it to be so that we could be a part of Him transforming and changing the lives of people,
[time=2121] that kind of activity takes place in the midst of those who surrender themselves, who give themselves,
[time=2129] who bask in and who are surrounded by the truth of God's Word.
[time=2137] The second thing that He's been putting on my heart, I'll just direct your attention to Romans 12.
[time=2142] Would you turn there?
[time=2144] Look with me at Romans, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, then comes Paul's letter to the church at Rome.
[time=2150] And in Romans 12, 10, he says this, be devoted to one another.
[time=2159] Says in Romans 12, 10, be devoted to one another in brotherly love.
[time=2166] Give preference to one another in honor.
[time=2173] And we need this kind of mindset.
[time=2176] We need this mentality.
[time=2181] You know what we have?
[time=2183] We have a level of devotion to each other.
[time=2186] There is a sense of unity.
[time=2188] There is a harmony amongst us here in this place that I'm very, very encouraged by.
[time=2196] There are times when I sense we still need some help in that arena.
[time=2202] There are times I sense when I still need some help in this arena, honoring you instead of me,
[time=2212] referring you instead of me, being more concerned about you than myself.
[time=2221] And as you read through the Scriptures, and we'll look at a few other passages here on this,
[time=2227] the New Testament is absolutely stacked with calls for you and I to be so very, very devoted to each other.
[time=2242] Let me ask you a question.
[time=2248] What is this place?
[time=2255] This building, this service that we're a part of, the ministries of this place, this is altogether called a what?
[time=2267] Somebody, church, a few bold individuals.
[time=2272] You're right.
[time=2274] This place is called a church.
[time=2278] It is an organism, not an organization.
[time=2281] It is alive.
[time=2282] It is the body of Christ.
[time=2283] It is the chosen tool of God, the only chosen tool of God to reach a lost and dying world.
[time=2290] This is called the church.
[time=2297] We'll take another step over here.
[time=2305] What are we?
[time=2308] This place is called the church.
[time=2311] What are we?
[time=2314] Body of Christ.
[time=2315] Oh, we're getting bolder.
[time=2317] Good job.
[time=2318] We're the body of Christ.
[time=2320] We're Christ followers.
[time=2322] We are people, those of us that know Him personally, who have surrendered our hearts and lives to Him, entered into a life-changing relationship with Him.
[time=2331] We are the body of Christ.
[time=2332] This place is called the church.
[time=2334] It's ministries and it's people following Christ.
[time=2338] And what are we doing?
[time=2347] Here's why I ask, what is this place?
[time=2350] See, what happens so many times and I'm going to tie all this to unity.
[time=2356] Stay with me.
[time=2357] What is this place?
[time=2359] See, if you're not careful, if you're not careful, if you and I don't exercise wisdom,
[time=2366] if we don't stay connected to this, this place, this service, these ministries, and I've heard it, okay?
[time=2375] Certainly out of no mouths in here, right?
[time=2379] But I've heard it and I see it and I bump into it.
[time=2382] The way that question gets answered at times when we stray from this.
[time=2387] This place, this service, these ministries become a product.
[time=2396] It's a product.
[time=2399] And if we're not careful and if we wander from this, what we're doing, excuse me, who you are,
[time=2406] that question begins to be answered while we're consumers.
[time=2411] And we're here to get our, say, our product, the bride of Christ, the chosen institution of God,
[time=2422] the only thing he labeled to reach a lost and dying world becomes a product, getting dished out,
[time=2430] hopefully in a way that'll keep the customer happy.
[time=2435] You with me?
[time=2437] And that leads to, what are we doing?
[time=2440] Now, it leads to a thing called playing church.
[time=2445] And that's about the extent of it.
[time=2448] Just a bunch of customers coming in and sitting in a room playing church,
[time=2455] hoping that the product is what, who likes, the people.
[time=2467] Now, I'm shooting straight with you.
[time=2469] I don't sense a whole lot of that around here these days.
[time=2475] I really don't.
[time=2478] But we had, we had best be so very, very careful because people, the stakes are so high.
[time=2485] And he has chosen us to bring hope and the message of life.
[time=2489] And you know what?
[time=2491] We're family.
[time=2492] We are the body of Christ.
[time=2495] We are family.
[time=2498] We are brothers.
[time=2499] We are sisters.
[time=2501] We are united together.
[time=2505] And family.
[time=2507] Spiritual family.
[time=2511] That means something.
[time=2513] I remember Kenny and Scott Price growing up in high school.
[time=2517] I had a buddy, Kenny.
[time=2518] He was my age.
[time=2519] Scottie was like four years younger.
[time=2522] And you know what?
[time=2523] Kenny didn't like Scottie that much.
[time=2525] But they had this, the Price family.
[time=2526] They were big.
[time=2527] See, I wasn't.
[time=2528] You might not have been.
[time=2529] But there were, there are some families that are really, really big on family.
[time=2534] You know what I mean?
[time=2535] And I never had any brothers and I never had any sisters.
[time=2539] I think the 12 pound thing had something to do with that.
[time=2542] But I was all taken by Kenny Price because Kenny Price had a little brother named Scottie
[time=2548] who was four years younger who he didn't even really like.
[time=2551] The guy, the little guy, bugged him incessantly.
[time=2553] But I'll tell you what, I watched it happen a dozen times if I saw it once.
[time=2558] If Kenny saw anybody, give Scottie any guff.
[time=2564] Whoa.
[time=2567] I mean it was serious stuff because they were family.
[time=2570] And you didn't say anything about Scottie Price.
[time=2574] You didn't touch Scottie Price.
[time=2576] You didn't mess with Scottie Price.
[time=2579] Because if you did his brother, right, you've all heard the story.
[time=2584] You've all seen the same thing.
[time=2587] Well, why don't we do that?
[time=2591] More often.
[time=2592] Is there any room in your heart or mind to grow in this unbelievably deep commitment to the
[time=2598] fact that we're family?
[time=2601] And you would never, you would always use tact and you would always be guided by love, but you would never.
[time=2609] You would never let anything go.
[time=2612] You wouldn't let anybody say any.
[time=2614] You would always guided by tact, always steered by love, but your commitment to him and your
[time=2620] love for us, you'd never let it.
[time=2625] You'd never let it pass.
[time=2626] And you certainly, right, you certainly would never, you'd certainly never say anything
[time=2632] yourself, right?
[time=2641] What about this place?
[time=2644] And there's an answer that I hope you and I can continue to grow toward.
[time=2649] I don't know that we can all say it.
[time=2651] I can, and it's not because you pay me.
[time=2654] It's because I've gotten to this point where I love everything about this place.
[time=2662] Do I prefer everything about this place?
[time=2668] Somebody want to venture, anybody here want to say that you think you know how I might answer that and you think I might answer yes?
[time=2676] Because I don't.
[time=2678] I don't prefer everything that goes on here.
[time=2682] Everything that happens here isn't necessarily to my taste.
[time=2687] How about you?
[time=2690] But I love you.
[time=2693] I love this place.
[time=2695] I love what God's doing here.
[time=2697] I love everything about Blackhawk.
[time=2699] I love everything about Christmas with Blackhawk.
[time=2702] I love everything about our worship service.
[time=2704] I love everything that comes out of this piano and that guitar and those trumpets.
[time=2712] I love everything about this place.
[time=2715] How about you?
[time=2718] Let me show you something.
[time=2719] We'll wrap it up here in a few minutes.
[time=2723] Keith, come on up here.
[time=2725] Corbin, you just kind of stumbled upon this the other day.
[time=2731] This is really cool.
[time=2733] Hey, sound guys, I'm going to give Pastor Keith this mic right here.
[time=2737] And I think Corbin brought his up.
[time=2743] Hello, doctor.
[time=2745] Good to see you.
[time=2747] Hey, um, came my mind.
[time=2750] I've always done this the other way.
[time=2751] So you have to come over here.
[time=2752] I'm going to get messed up.
[time=2753] And I'm going to take this away from you.
[time=2755] I'm a piece of work, aren't I?
[time=2757] Okay, Keith, oh, then there's no mics over there.
[time=2761] See, I'm a mess already.
[time=2763] Okay, Keith, come stand over here.
[time=2768] This is so cool.
[time=2769] We just stumbled upon this.
[time=2773] Here's a picture of unity for you.
[time=2777] You got preferences?
[time=2779] I've gotten to.
[time=2782] We're also different.
[time=2783] We all come from vastly diverse backgrounds, right?
[time=2789] And I want you just to remember this picture.
[time=2791] This is truly amazing.
[time=2793] First of all, Keith, Kelly, and Corbin, three Ks, isn't that cool?
[time=2804] Keith, Pastor Keith Moore, is in his 80s.
[time=2810] Just 80.
[time=2812] I didn't want to give you any more years.
[time=2813] Yeah, you can clap for that.
[time=2815] Hey, watch this.
[time=2818] Keith is in his 80s.
[time=2821] Kelly is in his 40s.
[time=2825] And Corbin is in his 20s.
[time=2830] Keith, Pastor Moore, has been in ministry for over 50 years.
[time=2836] How many exactly?
[time=2837] Keith, for 51 years, this man has given himself to the study of that book in the ministry
[time=2845] of the church and loving and caring for and leading people for 51 years.
[time=2852] You can clap about that, too.
[time=2859] We always give him a bad time, respectfully.
[time=2862] We can, kid, but we do it so very gently because we love him so much.
[time=2866] When Keith prays, he prays the King James.
[time=2873] You ever noticed that?
[time=2876] We all do the same.
[time=2877] We pray what we are familiar with.
[time=2879] We pray what we learned growing up.
[time=2882] We pray what we hid in our hearts.
[time=2885] And when Keith prays, he doesn't even know.
[time=2887] He just prays the King James.
[time=2889] 51 years of ministry, 80 years of age, 40 years of age.
[time=2895] 15 years of ministry.
[time=2901] And I didn't grow up with the King James.
[time=2904] I grew up with the NAS.
[time=2908] And when I pray, it sometimes comes out.
[time=2913] 51 years, 15 years, how many months, what?
[time=2918] No, seriously.
[time=2919] Oh, is it two years?
[time=2920] No, it has been two.
[time=2922] A year and seven months.
[time=2924] Twelve and seven is 19.
[time=2926] 19 months.
[time=2927] 51 years.
[time=2931] 19 months.
[time=2933] Yeah, I didn't clap for that, too.
[time=2938] And you grew up with the, what, the NIV?
[time=2942] In the NAS.
[time=2943] You can use the microphone if you want to.
[time=2945] All three.
[time=2946] All three, I think.
[time=2947] Yeah, okay.
[time=2948] King James, NAS, NIV, King James, 80 years of age, 40 years of age, 20 years of age.
[time=2957] And I love him.
[time=2960] I love this man so much.
[time=2962] And I am so grateful.
[time=2965] But in all my youthfulness and in all my stupidity at times, in all my wayward, young, quick, foolish.
[time=2975] Every once in a while, we'd get to sit down in my office and just talk.
[time=2980] And he speaks words of wisdom and he speaks words of caution and he speaks words of encouragement.
[time=2989] And I am so very grateful for this guy with his 23 years of life and his 15 months of ministry experience.
[time=3000] And God uses him every single week to minister to my heart to remind me what this is about
[time=3010] as he exercises his gifts and his talents.
[time=3017] Keith wears a coat and tie every Sunday.
[time=3022] And you can clap back that.
[time=3029] I wear a coat and tie every once in a while.
[time=3034] I don't think Corbin has a coat and tie.
[time=3037] So yeah, you can clap it up too.
[time=3043] And you know what is so healthy?
[time=3045] Now watch this.
[time=3046] You know what's so healthy about what just happened right there?
[time=3050] There are places filled with people like this who when this gets talked about and this gets
[time=3060] talked about, they're like really, really, I mean really bothered.
[time=3068] And if there's anybody here this morning who is really, really bothered?
[time=3072] You've missed a really big boat.
[time=3077] See, because now watch this.
[time=3080] Keith, just in a few words, tell us, okay, now when you stand over here at 80 years of age and 51 years and you look back at this guy, look at him over there.
[time=3092] When you see him and you watch him minister and you see his age, what do you appreciate about him?
[time=3101] What do you find yourself thinking God for when you see him with his tastes and his preferences?
[time=3108] Well, I think when I see him of what I was like when I was his age and what God's doing
[time=3114] through him at such a young age, I think it's marvelous.
[time=3118] And I know that God has a great future for Corbin in ministry as he serves the Lord.
[time=3125] Yeah.
[time=3126] And you have been in places, I'm sure, hold that mic up a little closer.
[time=3130] In places I'm sure where you have seen this end of things and the things that 23-year-olds do
[time=3137] and the styles that they prefer and the preferences that they have and the expression of all that,
[time=3143] you have been in places I'm sure where that has caused havoc.
[time=3147] Just an absolute criminal.
[time=3149] Real havoc and turmoil.
[time=3151] And what today would you say?
[time=3154] How would you encourage us?
[time=3156] How would you caution us?
[time=3157] What kind of a mindset would you encourage us to have from your vantage point as we continue to do our best to live in harmony?
[time=3166] Well, as I have served the Lord through the years, it's so important that we work together as a church.
[time=3174] And I would say one precious moment that I've found here, and I've worked in multiple staffs,
[time=3181] is to see the unity among the staff in this church, I think is overwhelming to me.
[time=3186] We meet on Tuesday morning for prayer every Tuesday, and to see that great circle of those
[time=3192] that are serving here, it's amazing and wonderful to see the camaraderie between them
[time=3198] and the prayer as we pray together.
[time=3200] And I'm encouraged by this because I know in some churches that's not true.
[time=3206] And I think here as a body of Christ, as we serve the Lord, I would encourage you.
[time=3212] You may not approve of every method that's done, but don't criticize the motive
[time=3220] because you don't know what's behind it.
[time=3223] But I've appreciated coming into this church, and the music has been different.
[time=3226] I'll have to tell you that.
[time=3228] The one I'm used to, because we were singing the old rugged cross and all the old hymns.
[time=3232] But I've appreciated what's going forth here in the words of these hymns
[time=3238] and what's being accomplished in this church for the glory of God.
[time=3242] I am encouraged in my ministry to see this, and I praise God for it.
[time=3247] [AMEN] Cool. Yeah.
[time=3249] Now, when you just briefly, I mean, share with the folks when you kind of look back the other way.
[time=3258] And when you see a guy like this, 80 years of age, 51 years of ministry,
[time=3264] styles, and preferences being what they are, what do you think?
[time=3268] How does that impact you, and what are the things that God puts on your heart when you see Him and are around Him and experience Him?
[time=3278] Most of our relationship has been probably more of an observation standpoint, because we only see each other about once a week.
[time=3285] But when I meet with Keith and get to talk to him probably weekly, the thing that I notice about him is just wisdom and experience.
[time=3294] And those things I lack a lot of times, and so I watch him be slow to speak.
[time=3301] And I watch him think about things before he says them, and I usually wind up putting my foot in my mouth.
[time=3307] And then to talk to him about all of his kids and grandkids, do you have 25?
[time=3313] 26.
[time=3315] And all of them are walking with the Lord.
[time=3317] All of his kids are, and all of his grandkids.
[time=3319] And I just think, wow, what a legacy to be as old as he is, and to have not only given to churches and ministries, but to be devoted to his family, and to raise up five godly children, and 26 godly grandchildren, and don't even have great-grandchildren?
[time=3334] Yeah, two.
[time=3335] And they're probably going to start walking with the Lord pretty soon.
[time=3337] Can they walk yet?
[time=3340] Got to walk first, then walk with the Lord.
[time=3344] Those are probably the two biggest things.
[time=3346] We need it.
[time=3347] We need that desperately.
[time=3354] And his willingness, and my willingness, here, just come over here, come here, come here, Cor.
[time=3358] I'm not being corny.
[time=3359] I just want to, there's a picture right here, because a lot of places in churches today, 80-year-olds, 20-year-olds, 40-year-olds, aren't postured this way.
[time=3373] That has given us a wonderful opportunity here, and we need to love, care for, be deeply devoted to each other, loving everything about this place.
[time=3385] Amen?
[time=3386] Hi.
[time=3387] You can sit down.
[time=3389] You stay here just for a second.
[time=3391] Watch.
[time=3392] Yeah.
[time=3393] [AMEN] Absolutely.
[time=3401] Praise God.
[time=3413] Now, now, you can stay standing.
[time=3416] You can stay standing, because we're going to go here and just sit, but watch this.
[time=3420] If he would will it to be so, and he were going to really make, like never before, a difference in the lives of those that we might get to touch, it's going to take a place so very devoted and immersed in and surrounded by the truth, a place that's deeply devoted
[time=3436] to each other, no matter what.
[time=3439] And here's the last picture I want to show you, and this is not not being funny here, with all due respect to Keith, and we've talked about this.
[time=3446] Keith knows that there will be a day, and he's looking forward to it in a way.
[time=3452] There will be a day when Keith Moore won't be here.
[time=3458] He'll be in a better place.
[time=3460] Amen, Keith?
[time=3461] [AMEN] So now watch this.
[time=3463] So then, this is a little scary.
[time=3466] So then I come down here.
[time=3470] Okay, Corb, come this way.
[time=3473] And then we need like a ten-year-old, really quick to just run up here.
[time=3477] Go.
[time=3478] Come on, buddy, right here.
[time=3479] Come up here.
[time=3480] Come on, run.
[time=3481] Stay next to Corbin there.
[time=3482] A little cook.
[time=3483] There you go.
[time=3484] Screw down some.
[time=3486] Now, what in the world is he going to bring to this?
[time=3494] To this?
[time=3495] Are you with me?
[time=3496] I mean, you think sometimes it's hard, you know, when some of this stuff comes out of the younger, okay, well, don't forget, folks, a day is coming.
[time=3506] When in the church faithful followers of Christ who are now a lot younger than you and me
[time=3514] will bring their passion and you know what it won't look like.
[time=3523] We got used to.
[time=3525] It won't look like what?
[time=3527] You with me?
[time=3529] Now here's the last thing.
[time=3532] Are you fully surrendered to the truth?
[time=3534] Are you fully surrendered to unity at all costs and are you thirdly, are you fully surrendered to pray?
[time=3542] If we don't get on our knees day in and day out, night after night and beg God for the
[time=3550] wisdom and strength to live like this, I don't think it's going to happen.
[time=3555] When I won't see him's gone, I will stand and proclaim that you are my God, I will worship
[time=3564] you.
[time=3565] In the midnight hour, I will worship you.
[time=3571] When I'm in the fire, I will worship you.
[time=3574] When I won't see him's gone, I will stand and proclaim that you are my God, that you
[time=3582] are my God.
[time=3583] If you are my God, that you are my God, I will worship you.
[time=3613] [BLANK_AUDIO]
