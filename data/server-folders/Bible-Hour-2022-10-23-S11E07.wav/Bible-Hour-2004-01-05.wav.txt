[time=0] [MUSIC - 83 seconds]
[time=106] Good morning. Welcome to Blackhawk. We've been looking forward to this morning a chance to come together once again.
[time=112] And to worship our God who is holy and honorable and worthy of praise.
[time=117] The God we serve is good and His love endures forever.
[time=121] Let's stand together and sing about this God whose love endures not just for today but for all time and for eternity.
[time=134] Thanks to the Lord, our God and King, His love endures forever.
[time=142] For He is good, He is above all things.
[time=146] His love endures forever. Sing praise. Sing praise.
[time=158] With a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. His love endures forever.
[time=165] For the life that's been reborn. His love endures forever.
[time=172] Sing praise.
[time=187] Forever God is faithful, forever God is strong, forever God is with us forever.
[time=201] And therefore forever.
[time=211] From the rising to the setting sun, His love endures forever.
[time=218] And by the grace of God we will carry on. His love endures forever.
[time=226] Sing praise. Sing praise.
[time=236] Sing praise.
[time=241] Forever God is faithful, forever God is strong, forever God is with us forever.
[time=275] Sing his love endures forever. His love endures forever.
[time=294] His love endures forever. His love endures forever. His love endures forever.
[time=307] Sing praise. Sing praise.
[time=323] Forever you are strong, forever you are with us forever.
[time=336] Forever and ever.
[time=340] Forever you are faithful, forever you are strong, forever you are with us forever and ever forever.
[time=366] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Blackhawk Ministries, and it is nice to be with you again.
[time=381] We're so thankful for this opportunity to share our service, our worship, and this Blackhawk family with you.
[time=390] I've been for the last couple of days trying to think of a word or even words that would describe adequately and in a meaningful way what you're about to see.
[time=404] This past Sunday as the family gathered, what took place was just powerful, is a word that comes to mind and so very encouraging.
[time=414] I use the word powerful because powerful is what you get when the Spirit of God decides to in a very special way show up when the anointing of the Spirit comes.
[time=428] And when he visits our efforts, be it preaching or our worship or the body gathered when he comes and when his touch, when his Spirit is on that, it is a powerful experience.
[time=444] And what took place this past Sunday morning was that, and I won't say too much, I'll just let you experience it.
[time=452] But I want you to know as well, it was very, very encouraging. We give people in this service you're about to watch.
[time=459] We give people an opportunity to take the realities of their life, the things that are broken, the things that are painful, the things that have been for them in recent days or months, even in recent years.
[time=475] The things, those circumstances, those relationships that have been so very difficult, heartbreaking, confusing.
[time=483] We give the people that came that day the opportunity to bring their brokenness to him, to the cross, to Jesus Christ, the one who brings healing.
[time=496] The relation it talks about, how he says, "I make all things new." In 2 Corinthians 5, he says, "What was old has passed away. Behold, new things have come."
[time=507] And it was so encouraging for me because to see so many people be willing to bring the very realities of their life so honestly, and you'll see as you watch, they do it with such honesty and they do it with such authenticity and they do it so willingly.
[time=525] They come and they bring their brokenness to him.
[time=529] And as I said and watched that, and as I participated in that myself, my heart was so encouraged. God is doing an amazing thing in the lives of the people who he has brought to this place.
[time=540] And I've got to tell you this again. You may watch this today, and you may, too, sense, even through the tape, you may sense the power and the Spirit of God at work in that place.
[time=553] What you see as encouraging as it might be to you as well, it is nothing like experiencing it in person.
[time=561] And if you don't have a church home, if there's not a place, a people that you can come and be with, we would love to have you come and be with us.
[time=572] Many of you have church homes, and you know that we're really thankful for that, and we encourage you to continue to go and build into that church home.
[time=580] Others of you, though, you need to come. You need to come and allow God to do his work in you in person with this amazing band of Christ followers that he's forming and building and growing here at Black Hawk.
[time=594] We'd love to have you with us. Watch this today with your heart wide open to what he would want to do in your own life with the brokenness that you have.
[time=603] Bring it to him and allow him to encourage you today and give you hope today like never before. Enjoy.
[time=612] Well, hey, let me, if I can, just invite every one of you in this room to just take a minute or two here to begin to think with me about something.
[time=621] The thing I'd like to invite you to consider this morning is the fact that in your life and in mine, and I don't care who you are, I don't care where you've been.
[time=631] Maybe you've known the Lord for a few months, maybe you've been walking with God for 30, 40 years, but every one of us has come to realize that there are some broken dreams in our lives.
[time=650] There were some things that you thought were going to go a certain way, and they didn't.
[time=657] There were some situations, there were some relationships, maybe a marriage, maybe a relationship with your kids.
[time=670] Maybe it was a relationship with a good, good friend or family member, and at one point in time it was good, and then something happened.
[time=684] And sin, sin did its thing, and today it's broken.
[time=694] Still hope for it, maybe, yeah. In other situations it may seem hopeless, maybe it was a baby that was lost.
[time=707] Could have been a divorce, could have been a job that you really, really liked, that today you don't have anymore.
[time=717] It may have been just kind of a general course of life, and you always thought it would kind of be like this, and today you sit here and in the honesty of your heart you realize it's not.
[time=732] Everybody on your way in today got a piece of broken pottery. Would you hold that? Would you please pick that up, and would you please hold on to that?
[time=743] And that little piece of broken pottery, you see that represents a broken dream, a broken expectation, a broken promise.
[time=755] And we want to invite you this morning. This will all kind of come to fruition next Sunday morning, and that's all I'll say about that, but for today we want to invite you to do this.
[time=767] Would you just take a pencil or a pen, just take something and just write on the back of that thing, one word, or just a brief phrase, just you're the only one that would know what it means.
[time=781] And whatever you write down there, that's you just in all honesty and sincerity before God saying, God, this, this right here, it just didn't go like I thought it would.
[time=793] And today I hurt, or today I'm confused, or today I just don't quite know what to do. I need your help.
[time=802] And in just a moment we're going to invite you to just slowly, you can kind of trickle, an initial wave, and then a few others of you, we're going to have people at the base of the stairs, and there'll be some in the back, and then there'll be some down in front.
[time=815] And they've just got some caulk guns, and you're going to go up to them, and they're just going to give you a little shot of adhesive, and then we're going to come to the one place where every broken dream,
[time=830] where every broken promise, where every broken life gets made new, and we're just going to invite you to attach it.
[time=843] And He who sits on the throne said, "Behold, I am making all things, say it with me, new."
[time=853] And He said, "Right, for these words are faithful and true. I am making all things new."
[time=862] Therefore, if any man Paul said to the church Corinth, therefore if any man is in Christ, He is a new creature. The old things passed away, behold, say it with me, new things have come.
[time=880] And so we want to invite you this morning to come. As you come, we're going to sing, and we would just invite you again, just kind of come and
[time=891] come periodically as you come. Would you sing? Don't allow your presence in an aisle, or a weight, and there'll be a weight, it's okay.
[time=900] You can come from this side, and you can come from the front, and you're welcome to come up on the stairs here, and fill in the back, and you can come from the sides.
[time=907] But would you sing? Would you sing songs of hope? Would you sing songs that remind us of this good God that we love and serve?
[time=916] And I'll just say this to you as well. You may even, as you come, find yourself next to someone who you know or who you don't know, who maybe just needs an encouraging word, a reminder, strength.
[time=933] And so be sensitive to that. Take that which is broken and come and bring it to the place where it all gets made new. And as we do, let's worship him together.
[time=963] [MUSIC]
[time=993] Take my life, take my life, and let it be consecrated, Lord, to thee. Take my moments and my days.
[time=1021] Let them flow in Jesus' praise. Take my hands and let them move, add the uncalled soul, die alone.
[time=1038] Take my feet and let them be, swift and beautiful for thee.
[time=1068] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=1107] Please sit beyond it in a land that is plentiful, where streams above and then flow, listen to your name.
[time=1124] Listen to your name when I'm found in the desert place, when I walk through the wilderness, listen to your name.
[time=1140] Every blessing, every blessing you pour out out, turn back to praise. When the darkness closes in, Lord, still I will stay.
[time=1158] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Blessed be your name. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Blessed be your glorious name.
[time=1180] Blessed be your name when the sun shining down on me, when the world's all as it should be. Blessed be your name.
[time=1198] Blessed be your name on the road marked with suffering, who was pain in the offering. Blessed be your name.
[time=1214] Every blessing you pour out out, turn back to praise. When the darkness closes in, Lord, still I will stay.
[time=1230] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Blessed be your name. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Blessed be your glorious name.
[time=1267] Blessed be your name. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Blessed be your glorious name.
[time=1284] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[time=1301] Blessed be your name. We give and take away. We give and take away. Our heart will choose to say.
[time=1316] Blessed be your name. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Blessed be your name. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[time=1350] Blessed be your glorious name.
[time=1359] [AMEN] That may have been very, very difficult. I think it was for many of you, and this is so very interesting to watch.
[time=1374] You come and bring that hurt or that disappointment to him. I know it was painful for you. It was hard for me.
[time=1384] It was hard to sit there. I saw about half of you, and I love you, and it's hard to see people hurt, but you know it's a good hurt when it's moving this way.
[time=1395] That makes sense. It's a real good hurt. Whoever you are and whatever it was, and I know a lot of it's really, really confusing.
[time=1406] And I know in some ways maybe it's been a while, and now this just kind of maybe brings it back up, but again if it's moving you here, that's okay.
[time=1418] And I was laughing with a friend in a good way just, and I want to thank you, kids.
[time=1429] I want to thank you 10-year-olds, and you 11-year-olds, and you 12-year-olds, and there could be some 40, 50, and 60-year-olds looking at you 10-year-olds going, you know?
[time=1445] What would they know of brokenness? What would they know of a dream not fulfilled?
[time=1456] And I understand that. They don't. They have no idea what's going to come.
[time=1463] But if they learn now to go here, amen? That's a good thing. That's a real good thing.
[time=1474] All right. Open your Bibles, if you would, to 1 Thessalonians, Chapter 2, 1 Thessalonians, Chapter 2, and we come to a story of two very different Eternities.
[time=1490] Two very different lives, two very different futures.
[time=1498] Two very different groups of people.
[time=1501] Hey, I've got a couple of friends, and I actually have more than two, but the two that I want to tell you about this morning will obviously remain nameless, but they represent some interesting dynamics.
[time=1519] I'll start with this one. There's one who I've gotten to know in just the last year, actually under a year.
[time=1527] And it was just under a year ago that this person came into this place, came in through these doors, sat in a pew in this room for the very first time in their life, in their mid-30s, they came to church.
[time=1546] You realize, don't you, that there are folks in that situation, you realize, right, that there are people who have never been to a gathering of Christ followers.
[time=1558] And this individual came in and set for the very first time, having never been in a church, having never heard the Bible, having never seen a gathering of Christ followers, seeing and lift up the truth of God's Word.
[time=1575] This person had never heard a message, had never seen people that were so seemingly wanting and thankful to be in a room of this size, and had never been, I mean, it was just a whole new deal.
[time=1590] And that day, that day, it all came together. God and His providence had brought this individual in through those doors for the first time, set them down, and it all just happened.
[time=1607] And within a couple of days, this individual came to full surrender, came to a knowledge of God, a realization of what God had done, and thoroughly and absolutely surrendered His life to Him.
[time=1621] And that next week, and the week after that, and the month after that, just continued to come and to grow and to learn, and relationships have been established.
[time=1633] And other ministry opportunities, this individual has been exposed to, and that heart and that life has been grown, and things are starting to happen.
[time=1643] It is amazing, one Sunday, boom, right there, God did His thing. And this person responds.
[time=1654] I got another friend. And I really do, I honestly consider this person a good friend, and they, this individual, and maybe you know somebody like this.
[time=1669] Maybe, maybe you're here and this is you.
[time=1673] But this individual, for I would say probably 15 years, I guess, has been floating in and floating out of this place.
[time=1688] And not just this place, but you see, God has in a very faithful way with this individual, God has revealed His truth to this person through the word, through relationships, through a number of different circumstances where He has shown Himself to be so very real.
[time=1711] And this individual sees it, and hears it, wrestles with it a bit, but has consistently, year after year after year, floated in and floated out, months will go by.
[time=1730] And then all of a sudden, boom, there that individual is, a few weeks ago by, boom, all of a sudden, I see it, and we talk periodically.
[time=1741] And I'm reading this week, right, as I'm getting ready for today, I'm reading, and I come across a quote, and I want to just read it to you.
[time=1748] I just had him put it up on the screen. I want you to just to realize that this is something that Paul himself identifies and sees in the life that God had given him.
[time=1759] And the people that Paul had interacted with. Watch what this one author says.
[time=1764] He says, "Since God first revealed it to mankind, the plan of redemption has been a bittersweet reality.
[time=1770] One finds sweetness in contemplating the bliss and glory of eternal life that awaits those who embrace the gospel.
[time=1779] By contrast, one finds only bitterness in the endless shame and punishment of eternal damnation that awaits those who reject the gospel."
[time=1792] That contrast is never more strikingly seen than when one compares people who have made the most of limited spiritual opportunity to people who have squandered great spiritual privilege.
[time=1808] Throughout redemptive history, the Jews have exemplified the latter reality.
[time=1814] On the other hand, the Thessalonians epitomized the former reality and believed God's truth after only a brief initial exposure to it.
[time=1825] The striking contrast is the object of the Apostle Paul's focus in 1 Thessalonians 2, 13 to 20. He distinguishes sharply between a people we can celebrate, the believing Thessalonians, and a people we will grieve for, the unbelieving Jews or the unbelieving individual in our case.
[time=1846] In just a short period of time, the Thessalonians readily chose the blessing of obedience to the gospel of God, whereas after centuries, don't forget that.
[time=1859] The Jewish nation had seen the faithfulness and hand of God for centuries, and they still, what's it say, stubbornly chose the judgment.
[time=1873] Whereas after centuries of revelation from God, the Jews stubbornly chose the judgment resulting from disobedience to the gospel.
[time=1882] Such opposite responses to God's truth and grace prompted Paul to sort out the reasons he rejoiced for the Thessalonians and sorrowed for the Jews.
[time=1896] Would you, out of respect and appreciation for God's Word, would you stand with me this morning as we read? I'll read and you follow along 1 Thessalonians, chapter 2 beginning in verse 13.
[time=1908] It says this, "For the reason we also constantly thank God, for this reason we also constantly thank God, that when you received the Word of God which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the Word of men, but for what it really is, the Word of God."
[time=1925] Which also performs its work in you who believe.
[time=1929] For you, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus that are in Judea.
[time=1935] For you also endured the same sufferings at the hands of your own countrymen, even as they did from the Jews, who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out.
[time=1948] They are not pleasing to God, but hostile to all men, hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved, with the result that they always fill up the measure of their sins.
[time=1962] But wrath has come upon them to the utmost.
[time=1969] Father, we come before you this morning and we open up the pages of your words, and our hope again, God, is that you would teach us, that you would remind us, God, that your Spirit would convict us, wherever we need to be nudged, wherever we need to be pushed.
[time=1984] God, we want to be a people, that you can celebrate, we want to be a people that would live our lives with the spiritual investment that you've made available to us.
[time=1995] God, that we would grab hold tightly and not lose the opportunity to know you and experience life as you intended it to be lived.
[time=2009] God, for those in the room this morning that don't know you, they don't have a relationship with you.
[time=2017] They may have glued a piece of tile to across this morning, but still to this point, they've not surrendered their heart and life to you.
[time=2026] And so because of that God today, they're here and they live outside of the blessing and joy and peace of knowing you.
[time=2035] And we pray, God, that as you move in their hearts and lives, that they would be receptive to you and to your work and to the Word of God.
[time=2043] And it's great power.
[time=2045] Thank you so very much for this privileged time.
[time=2049] May we give our hearts completely to what you have for us in your son's name, we pray.
[time=2055] [AMEN] You can be seated.
[time=2057] In our passage this morning, the Apostle Paul, as you read, expresses his gratitude, as he said, his constant thankfulness for the Thessalonians believers.
[time=2068] He had done this earlier.
[time=2069] You may remember in chapter 1, verse 2, you can turn back there and see verse 2 of chapter 1.
[time=2074] We give thanks to God always for all of you, making mention of you in our prayers.
[time=2079] He did it there in a general way, but here he gives us the reason.
[time=2083] Here he gets specific and he explains for his readers why he is so very, very thankful.
[time=2091] And in doing so, people, he reminds us that there are people we can celebrate.
[time=2099] There will be people, better said, whose choices we can be thankful for.
[time=2106] There are and there will be people we can rejoice with because of what they've chosen in response to God.
[time=2115] Let's look at this.
[time=2116] Number one, of people whose choices we can celebrate.
[time=2119] What is it about these people?
[time=2121] More specifically, what is it about their choices that can bring us, as it did Paul, to this point of celebration?
[time=2128] Number one, they receive God's Word.
[time=2133] They received at Thessalonica, and there are those still today who, when given the opportunity, they receive.
[time=2141] They take in.
[time=2143] They accept the Word of God.
[time=2146] Look at verse 13, for this reason we also constantly thank God that when you received the Word of God, which you heard from us,
[time=2154] you accepted it, not as the Word of men, but for what it really is, the Word of God, and we'll stop right there.
[time=2161] People, there are those in this room, and there are those watching the broadcast, and there are those that you know and I know who absolutely are wide open.
[time=2172] They have postured themselves, and they live their lives wide open to this book.
[time=2179] But the truth that exists here, to the words of God, these ancient truths ever knew, changing you and changing me.
[time=2188] There are people in your world and mine.
[time=2190] I see it all the time.
[time=2191] They are absolutely open to this.
[time=2195] They are hungry for it.
[time=2196] They need it.
[time=2197] They crave it.
[time=2198] They can't wait to get to hear it and take it in, because they have seen, they have seen what the psalmist had seen.
[time=2207] They had seen what you and I have seen, and I love what it says.
[time=2211] We've looked at it many times in the past.
[time=2213] Psalm 19.
[time=2214] There are people who are open to it.
[time=2215] There are people who crave it.
[time=2217] There are people who long to hear it and take it in, because there are some who have finally come to realize that in the midst of a culture and a world that offers so many options, the law of the Lord is perfect.
[time=2234] Psalm 19.
[time=2238] The law of the Lord is perfect, restoring the soul, and we need our souls restored.
[time=2243] The testimonies of the Lord are sure making wise the simple, and we need wisdom.
[time=2249] The precepts of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart, and our hearts need to rejoice.
[time=2256] The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.
[time=2260] The fear of the Lord is clean and during forever.
[time=2263] The judgments of the Lord are true.
[time=2267] They are righteous all together.
[time=2269] They are more desirable than gold.
[time=2271] Sweet are also than honey.
[time=2273] Moreover, by them, your servant, verse 11, is warned.
[time=2276] In keeping them, there is great reward.
[time=2280] There are a whole lot of people, many in this place this morning, and you figured that out.
[time=2284] God has revealed that to you, and you love this truth.
[time=2289] Many of us are open to it hungry for it, because in the end we realize, bottom line, these
[time=2296] are the words of God, not men.
[time=2299] And see, that's very important.
[time=2300] That would have been incredibly pertinent to this audience at Thessalonica.
[time=2305] Thessalonica, as a city, we talked about this early in our study, was strategically located.
[time=2311] And it was a place that attracted many, many people, many philosophers and religious teachers
[time=2318] proclaiming their own opinions and thoughts would make their way to Thessalonica.
[time=2323] And they would preach them, they would teach them, they would let it fly.
[time=2327] The streets were full of competing messages.
[time=2332] These Thessalonians had for certain, heard a wide range of human wisdom and eloquent
[time=2338] ramblings and cultural rhetoric.
[time=2340] But in contrast to all of that, when they heard the preaching of Paul, when they heard
[time=2347] the simple, honest, genuine proclamation of the truth, they gave them, they received
[time=2356] it, the text says.
[time=2358] They accepted it, and it changed them.
[time=2367] And you've got to know this morning how very thankful somebody like me is for the fact,
[time=2375] for the truth, that what it is that changes them, what it is that transforms them, what
[time=2381] it is about these words that is so special is that they're not mine.
[time=2389] Every week I sit there, I've told you before, every week I sit there before my foot touches one of these steps.
[time=2395] I just pray to God, and I say to myself, 1 Peter 4, 11, let him who speaks, speak as if
[time=2401] it were the very utterances of God.
[time=2404] Look at 1 Corinthians 2, it's important that we just take a minute and consider this truth.
[time=2411] The model that Paul leaves for us who speak, the model that he leaves for us who would attempt to stand and communicate these truths and the pressure and the discomfort at times
[time=2422] that comes with that.
[time=2423] Look what it says here in 1 Corinthians 2, it won't be on the screen, I don't think, just follow along in your Bibles or look on with somebody next to you.
[time=2429] 1 Corinthians 2 verses 1 to 5, listen to what Paul says as he recalls for the church in
[time=2435] Corinth how it is he came to them in reliance on the Holy Spirit.
[time=2439] And when I came to you verse 1, brethren, I did not come with superiority of speech or
[time=2447] of wisdom proclaiming to you the testimony of God, for I determined to know nothing among
[time=2453] you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[time=2458] That's it.
[time=2459] God is with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my message and my preaching
[time=2466] were not in persuasive words of wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power.
[time=2473] So that, why?
[time=2474] So that your faith, this is so important.
[time=2476] So that your faith would not rest on the wisdom of men but on the power of God.
[time=2485] It is the only, hear me, it is the only confidence I have.
[time=2494] There are times, there are moments, there are just little glimpses where I'll start to kind of lose sight of this.
[time=2502] There are times when driving in on a Sunday morning or sitting on that pew prior to standing here I think, my goodness, why are they here?
[time=2510] I have nothing to say, I don't know how to say, I'm not quite sure what, there are times
[time=2516] when I feel so inadequate to stand here and do what represent who?
[time=2524] To deliver, I mean, there are times when that way is heavy but it seems as if in those very
[time=2530] moments He will again and again remind me and I hope He's reminding you that all I'm
[time=2538] going to do is to do my best with His help to stand here with you and communicate and let His words, let His knowledge, let His power, let His Spirit do what it will do.
[time=2551] And the pressure, you know, it gets relieved a bit.
[time=2558] I'm so thankful that so many of you are so hungry for His words.
[time=2567] For His truth.
[time=2570] That's why we offer men's Bible stay.
[time=2572] That's why we offer power equipment, guys.
[time=2577] It's not just a program, it's not just some ministry thing we do, come on.
[time=2582] We offer power equipment on Thursday mornings at 6.30 and at 5.30 and Steve and Longbreak
[time=2590] and those who teach in that setting are now going through the book of Mark, verse by verse, written by section because men today need to be held up, encouraged by and reminded of
[time=2601] what is true and right.
[time=2603] And so we offer that.
[time=2604] That's why our women are about to on the 21st of this month begin a new study on Wednesdays
[time=2610] in the book of 2 Thessalonians.
[time=2612] They've already made their way through 1 Thessalonians and now they're at 2 Thessalonians while we wallow back here at chapter 2 but that's all right.
[time=2620] God uses that and He is inviting maybe some of you this morning, some of you gals to come
[time=2626] on a Wednesday morning and be a part of a Bible study, not a program but a chance for
[time=2632] you to open your life to the life-changing truth of His word.
[time=2636] It's why we do that.
[time=2637] It's why Mitch Crew is one of our teaching pastors on Wednesday nights at 6.45.
[time=2642] It's why over a hundred people come week after week to come and ground our midweek worship
[time=2648] service where Mitch opens up the scriptures and teaches verse by verse through the book of John right now because these ancient words are true because they have the power and the
[time=2662] ability like nothing else to affect change and bring realization to what is true and right
[time=2670] and good and that's why we do it.
[time=2674] How about you?
[time=2677] In our text this morning we see that these Thessalonians received and accepted God's Word.
[time=2683] They put themselves in a position whereby they took it in and are you?
[time=2690] Are you middle school, high school student?
[time=2693] Are you taking in the truth on a regular basis?
[time=2698] Young adults or young marrieds as you start this new future that's ahead of you, moms and dads, grandmas and grandpas, every one of you in this room, are you receiving it?
[time=2708] There's a difference between listening to it, right?
[time=2713] And receiving it, taking it in, accepting it, allowing it to change you.
[time=2722] I love how the verse continues.
[time=2723] Look with me back at verse 13, it says, "Receive the Word of God which you heard from us.
[time=2730] You accepted it not as the Word of men but for what it really is, the Word of God which also performs its work in you who believe.
[time=2740] People hate leaving me.
[time=2745] Please mom, let me stay, don't worry about it.
[time=2750] Listen to this now.
[time=2751] I don't want you to lose sight of this great truth.
[time=2753] The Scriptures, when you receive them, when you take them in, people, please, don't forget
[time=2761] this, the Scripture is absolutely packed with evidence of what takes place in your life
[time=2769] and mind when we take them in.
[time=2772] The Scriptures teach that the Word of God saves us, James 1, 18.
[time=2778] The Word of God sanctifies us.
[time=2781] They grow you, the Scriptures too, they grow you, they remind you, they admonish and correct
[time=2787] you, they counsel and guide you, they build you up, give you hope, bring success to your
[time=2793] life.
[time=2794] Joshua 1, they enlighten and warn you and they comfort you.
[time=2799] Anybody here need any of that?
[time=2801] I ask you again, anybody here need any of that?
[time=2805] Yeah.
[time=2807] Where are you going to find that?
[time=2810] All in one.
[time=2811] You're going to go find that at Wogg, you're going to go find that at some store, you're going to go buy that, you're going to go work for that.
[time=2817] Where in the world are you going to go lay hold of one thing that brings all of that to your life and to your heart and your soul?
[time=2824] There is no place, there is nothing but this.
[time=2830] And so you had better take it in, you had better receive it, you had better accept it
[time=2836] and put yourself, not just for 45, 50, 60 minutes on a Sunday morning in a position
[time=2842] to do so, that's good, we should be here, but you should throughout your week.
[time=2847] In light of what we talked about last week, we should be surrounding ourselves with this.
[time=2858] Paul goes on in verse 14 to show us the, that not only do some choose to receive the word, they also endure suffering.
[time=2866] There are people whose choices we can celebrate, they receive God's word and they endure suffering.
[time=2873] Look at verse 14 for you brethren, it says, "Became imitators of the churches of God
[time=2879] in Christ Jesus that are in Judea, for you also endured the same sufferings at the hands
[time=2885] of your own countrymen, even as they did from the Jews." We'll stop there.
[time=2890] It's amazing that in just this short period of time, remember Paul had come, the gospel
[time=2896] had been preached, he was there for a couple, two, three months, not long, but in just a short period of time, this body of believers in Thessalonica, this small, but brave and
[time=2909] courageous band of Christ followers, they had jumped completely in.
[time=2916] And you see in jumping completely in, they realized what many in our world today continue
[time=2925] to realize and that is when you are completely, and see we're going to have to stop here
[time=2931] just for a moment and work on some definitions, completely in.
[time=2942] They learned just early on after only a few months, that months that when you are completely
[time=2949] in, the persecution comes.
[time=2956] The torment and the difficulty begins to come at you.
[time=2961] That dawns on me this week as I'm thinking this through, something that should be so
[time=2967] very clear to every one of us that follows Christ here in this room as it relates to persecution, what should be so very clear to all of us is that we're not, are we?
[time=2986] Are we?
[time=2987] I mean, are we, okay, let me back up, do you and I face difficulty and trial in our life?
[time=2994] Yes, I do not mean to in any way diminish that, okay, I'm not.
[time=3000] There are things that you face, there are circumstances that I encounter, that there is pain and suffering if you will all over this place.
[time=3007] I just watched about 700 of them walk by.
[time=3011] So I am not saying that we don't in any way suffer hardship, okay?
[time=3015] What I am saying is let's define persecution and let's be really honest and let's just
[time=3021] be really clear that there are Christ followers in Asia today right now.
[time=3027] There are Christ followers in parts of Northern Africa.
[time=3030] There are Christ followers in the Sudan.
[time=3034] There are Christ followers just like you and me in parts of South America.
[time=3038] And today because they follow Christ, because they stand in their world and culture for
[time=3045] what they deeply believe, there are people like you and me in those places today who will be killed, who will be tortured, who will be kidnapped, who will be taken from their families because the light that they have inside them, the hope that they espouse, this
[time=3063] truth that they live out completely see it threatens the darkness.
[time=3071] And we know it's been happening since the very beginning, the darkness responds and does its best to push back the light.
[time=3083] Are we persecuted?
[time=3085] No, not really.
[time=3088] Are they persecuted in South America and Africa and China and parts of Asia, Sudan, yes.
[time=3095] And I just wrote this out, so just bear with me, why the enemy?
[time=3100] The enemy must concentrate his destructive and dark efforts where the light is most threatening.
[time=3109] You agree with that?
[time=3113] And in agreeing with that, you indict and I indict to a degree us because it would lead
[time=3125] any level headed individual to the realization that we must not be much of a what, of a threat.
[time=3133] And somehow, someway, I would pray, I would beg God to help us understand what that would
[time=3140] look like for you and I to be a people, not looking for a fight.
[time=3145] I don't mean that.
[time=3146] I just mean a people who are so completely in.
[time=3150] I just said it this way, if the Christian culture in a given place is standing with strength for what is right, pushing back the darkness with courage and sacrifice, proclaiming
[time=3159] teaching and obediently living out the truth.
[time=3162] If there are Christ followers living like revolutionaries, living like revolutionaries,
[time=3171] you know when you read Acts, I think that's what they were.
[time=3174] I think they were revolutionaries.
[time=3176] I think they looked at their life like a revolutionary would look at his or her life.
[time=3183] They weren't church shoppers.
[time=3187] They weren't somewhat regular attenders.
[time=3192] They weren't consumers.
[time=3195] They were revolutionaries that had given their lives and when Christ followers lived like
[time=3202] revolutionaries consumed with and committed to one thing above and beyond all else, honoring God if they are relentless in their pursuit of him, if they are relentless and undying in their love and commitment to each other, and if they are relentless, cannot be held back in their pursuit of those in need of the gospel, then I believe persecution will come.
[time=3223] I believe life would then begin to get for you and me in some way somehow.
[time=3227] I don't know exactly what it would look like, but I got to believe if we stood that strong,
[time=3233] if we pushed back that hard with his help, we might bump into a little resistance.
[time=3242] If there's no persecution, we must not be viewed as you answered well as much of a threat.
[time=3251] This passage also highlights a second group of people who we will in time grieve for.
[time=3261] There are those whose choices we will celebrate and there are those whose choices we will
[time=3267] grieve for, we will not celebrate for these.
[time=3272] We will grieve the choices that they made and they in the end, they make some really,
[time=3279] really poor ones.
[time=3282] And I'm going to invite you, if you would, to just come back.
[time=3286] And we will in a couple of weeks jump right back in here after Dr. Jennings is with us next week, we will come right back to this passage and we will dive in again and look
[time=3297] at these choices that some in that day and some of, don't miss this, some of you in
[time=3304] this room continue to make.
[time=3308] And if you're not careful and if you don't humble yourself and give yourself to some
[time=3317] wisdom and to what is right and true and good, then a day will come when we will, we will
[time=3326] be grieving for you.
[time=3331] Friday we did a, we had a, we had a funeral, we had a celebration service here for our
[time=3339] good friend Pete Smith.
[time=3343] And some of you knew Pete and some of you didn't, three, four years ago he came to a Christmas concert, I think it was the Living Christmas Tree and it was one of those years, I think it was 99 or 2000, there was a huge blizzard that last Sunday night and Pete
[time=3357] didn't know the Lord, but he loved his wife, he was a good man and he wasn't about to let
[time=3363] Mary come by herself, so he came and just told her he'd sit in the back and when it was over he'd take her home.
[time=3370] And that night Pete Smith surrendered his heart and life to the Lord and then for the
[time=3378] next three, four years, learned what it meant to follow Jesus Christ.
[time=3384] The last two years fought like a boy he fought hard and disease finally just took him and
[time=3391] the Lord was gracious to bring him home to be with him, but I say all that just to invite
[time=3397] you to continue to pray for Mary and the boys, Earl and Keith.
[time=3402] But I also say it to you just to remind you, and this is not meant to sound crass and I'm not being harsh here, but just to remind all of you, funerals do it for me.
[time=3410] I get reminded of the fact that you're going to die.
[time=3416] You're going to die and it may be today and it might be tomorrow, it could be next week, it could be 20, 30 years from now.
[time=3426] But life is a vapor, it's a hot breath on a cold night, it's here and it's gone and you, you have choices to make.
[time=3434] And you can even take death and put it over here and I would just say to those of you living in the absolute misery and futility of your independence to consider, would you
[time=3448] please, what life could be like when lived in relationship with the one who made you
[time=3454] and who loves you and who wants nothing more than to walk through life with you.
[time=3461] Try with me, would you, would you bow your heads and just close your eyes right where you're at?
[time=3465] Father, if there's anybody in this room this morning that we could encourage, that we could point toward faith, that we could sit down with and be able to help them understand
[time=3476] what it means to know and follow you.
[time=3480] God I pray you'd give us the opportunity to do so.
[time=3483] God I pray that they would be willing to talk to a friend that they trust, that they would be willing to come and allow us to point them in whatever direction we may need to point them in.
[time=3492] Father, we're so thankful that they're here.
[time=3495] And for those of us, God that know you, that live today in a surrendered relationship with
[time=3501] you, every one of us would readily and honestly admit we continue to need your help and guidance.
[time=3507] We need to continue to receive your truth.
[time=3510] We need to continue to endure suffering.
[time=3513] We need to continue to be willing to go out into this world, into that job, into that
[time=3519] family, into that situation, into that neighborhood that you've placed us in, and be the light
[time=3526] with love and grace and a spirit that wants nothing more than to be used of you, God,
[time=3534] to reach a lost and hurting world.
[time=3535] God give us the strength.
[time=3536] Bring us back again soon to a Bible study or a small group where we can continue to be
[time=3542] reminded of what is good and right and true.
[time=3545] Bring us back together again next week, if that be your will, and we'll look forward to it.
[time=3550] And all God's people said, amen.
