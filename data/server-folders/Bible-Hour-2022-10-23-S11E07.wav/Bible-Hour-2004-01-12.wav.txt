[time=0] [Ding]
[time=30] [MUSIC - 55 seconds]
[time=89] Well, it is so nice to be together again, and so sweet to sing praises to him,
[time=95] and we find ourselves this morning back here at the cross,
[time=101] and if you were here last week, you know, what a special, powerful time it was for us.
[time=107] And there's a picture there on the side screen that maybe would just remind you,
[time=113] those of you who were here, it was a powerful picture to see over 1,700 people come last week,
[time=120] and with their broken pieces of pottery, if you weren't here, everybody who came in last week got a broken piece of pottery.
[time=128] And on the back of that little broken piece of pottery, we invited folks to just share the heartache of their life,
[time=137] the broken dreams, if you will, the broken expectations, the relationships, the homes that had been torn apart,
[time=146] the job that got lost, the relationship that had been torn apart, whatever it was.
[time=155] And as we thought about it that day, all of us were readily willing to admit that there were things in our life
[time=161] that were not today as we had one day hoped they would be.
[time=168] And so we did what God's word calls us to do.
[time=171] We brought our hurt, and we brought our brokenness in the form of these little chips of pottery,
[time=177] and people just came by the hundreds, and they just attached them to this cross.
[time=182] And as the cross stood down there that day, it was a rough, rugged looking cross with a bunch of chipped, broken pieces of pottery just stuck, you know, all over the thing.
[time=193] And today it has reappeared.
[time=196] And Beth and others just did a great deal of work to just kind of symbolically, with grout,
[time=204] do what the spilled blood and broken body of our Lord did.
[time=210] And that is heal and make smooth, to heal and make new.
[time=217] Revelation 21, 2 Corinthians 5, we talked about it last week.
[time=222] Old things have passed, new things have come.
[time=228] And so this morning we want you to just those of you who were a part of this, those of you who were willing to bring your brokenness.
[time=234] You knew it then, but we just symbolically celebrated again today.
[time=239] There is one place that we can go.
[time=241] There is only one person we can bring.
[time=245] Those hurts and that brokenness too.
[time=247] And that is the Lord Jesus Christ, amen?
[time=250] And what He did on the cross, His blood smoothed, made new, and brought hope and forgiveness.
[time=263] And we are so grateful for that today.
[time=266] And I want you to listen as this song is sung.
[time=270] I want you to listen so very closely.
[time=272] I believe the words have been provided as you came in.
[time=276] There's a couple things that just grabbed my attention the first time I heard it.
[time=281] Maybe some of you in the room this morning can identify with this.
[time=284] Will my weakness for an hour make me suffer for a lifetime?
[time=293] Some of you have felt that.
[time=299] Some of you have faced that kind of pain and that kind of regret and that kind of sorrow.
[time=308] Is there any way to be made whole again?
[time=312] If I'm healed, renewed, and find forgiveness, find the strength I've never had,
[time=318] and my scars forever ruin all God's plan.
[time=323] And thank God that the answer to that is no.
[time=330] That the songwriter states that many of you have experienced, that you, God, you are strong enough.
[time=338] I finally found that you are pure enough to break me.
[time=341] Pour me out and start again, that you are brave enough to take one chance on me.
[time=347] So thank you for my chance to start again.
[time=351] And we would just encourage you again this morning, whoever you are, wherever you've been, whatever roads have been traveled, wholeness and newness of life can be found.
[time=362] A new life, a new hope can be experienced in the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=369] Listen and be encouraged as Aaron sings.
[time=377] As I rest against this cold hard wall, will you pass me by?
[time=390] Will you criticize me as I see and cry?
[time=398] I had fought so hard and thought that all my battles had been won.
[time=406] Only he defined the war has just begun.
[time=413] Is he not strong enough?
[time=417] Is he not pure enough to break me, pour me out and start again?
[time=429] Is he not brave enough to take one chance on me?
[time=437] Please can I have one chance to start again?
[time=446] Will my weakness for an hour make me suffer for a lifetime?
[time=461] Is there any way to be made whole again?
[time=468] And if I'm here renewed and fine forgive me, find the strength I've never had.
[time=477] Will my scars forever ruin all God's plans?
[time=484] Is he not strong enough?
[time=488] Is he not pure enough to break me, pour me out and start again?
[time=497] Is he not brave enough to take one chance on me?
[time=508] Please can I have one chance to start again?
[time=516] He took my life into his hands and turned it all around.
[time=524] And my most desperate circumstance is there I finally found.
[time=535] And if you are strong enough to break me, pour me out and start again?
[time=551] And if you are brave enough to take one chance on me?
[time=559] Will thank you for my chance to start again?
[time=589] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=600] And it is great to be able to be with you again.
[time=603] And I am so thankful today because I've got the special privilege of having my good friend, Dr. Al Jennings, with us here.
[time=611] Dr. Jennings is the founder and pastor at Summit City Christian Center
[time=617] and has become a very, very good friend of mine.
[time=620] And he's becoming an even better friend of the Black Hawk family.
[time=624] And we are so thankful for the ministry that God has in Al's life.
[time=628] They're at Summit City, but also the way God is using him to encourage us.
[time=632] He was with us this past week and you're going to see that service in just a little bit.
[time=638] But before we get to that, I just wanted you all to know.
[time=642] I get cards and letters and emails from you. I hear about how you're praying for me.
[time=648] And for us here at Black Hawk, I hear about how you appreciate what we do.
[time=652] And I just want you to know how thankful I am for this man and his friendship.
[time=658] He too has been a real encouragement to me.
[time=662] And I love what God is doing with him in this city and at that church.
[time=667] We got to go. Just a few weeks ago, I was on vacation.
[time=671] We get those every once in a while.
[time=673] And my family, my wife, Deborah, and our kids just decided to just go to church somewhere else besides Black Hawk.
[time=681] And first on our list was, you know, why don't we go and spend the day with the Jennings.
[time=686] And so we got a chance to be at Summit City.
[time=689] And what an amazing time it was. What an incredible family of people who honor and worship God in spirit and in truth.
[time=698] And it was so good to be there. And I just wanted Al, if he would, to just take a minute and tell you all a little bit about Summit City.
[time=706] And what God has been doing there, a little bit of their story, and some of what Al loves about that people that God has given him to lead and to love.
[time=715] Al, tell the people a little bit about that ministry at Summit City Christian Center.
[time=720] Okay, I'll be happy to do that. First of all, I want to just say to you that I really enter your television audience that I appreciate you and the friendship that we have is special.
[time=731] My wife Carla and I really love spending time with you in Canberra and our kids fellowship with your kids.
[time=736] And it's just something special that God is doing. And I consider you a covenant brother.
[time=741] [AMEN] And I just thank you for those kind words. And it's really rare where you have a man like this that will take time on his television broadcast to allow me to share about our ministry.
[time=758] And that's really, really special and it's really, really a privilege. So we started Summit City Christian Center in 1984.
[time=770] And my wife and I, we founded the church and we founded it on the teaching and the preaching of the Word of God.
[time=779] And our emphasis is to show people how they can take God's Word, apply it to their life, and become a success in every area of their life.
[time=792] In Joshua 1-8, the Scripture says, "This book of the law or the Word of God shall not depart out of your mouth, but you shall meditate in it day and night that you may observe to do according to all this written in it, for then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success."
[time=811] So based on that Scripture, our mission is to teach people how to win in life through the Word of God and touching others with the touch we receive from God.
[time=824] And the last part of that, touching others with the touch we receive from God, how we do that in our ministry is through our, what we call, touch groups where we have small groups that meet throughout the city, all different types of groups.
[time=840] Some of them are activity-based groups, some of them, their focus is the Word of God, but no matter what the activity, no matter what the title of the particular touch group, it's just a hook to reel people in and to touch unbelievers.
[time=859] I know that your focus, one of your focus is here at Blackhawk is to be able to touch with seekers and bring them in, and we're really going at it a couple of different ways.
[time=872] There's a lot of different methods, but we're all out about the same thing, out to do the same thing, and that is to touch people, to reach people and bring people to the Lord, which is what it's all about.
[time=883] Absolutely, and it is encouraging to get to see Dr. Jennings and that family respond to that call in the unique ways that God has called them to do it, and to see how we're doing it here, and to learn from each other, to be encouraged by each other.
[time=903] I can't tell you how much that means to us. Well, this past Sunday, like I said, Al came and delivered a message that God had put on his heart, and it was so very encouraging.
[time=916] It was penetrating. Al came and talked to us about how to live a worry-free life, worry, one of the most detrimental, one of the most discouraging things that we believe the enemy uses to distract people from living life.
[time=932] Successfully, living life in a way that truly honors God, and so as Al broke open the word, and we had the chance to be reminded about and taught about this thing called worry, and how it is we can truly and really cast all our cares upon him.
[time=951] It was for me personally something that I needed to hear. My wife needed to hear it. Our friends needed to hear it. This entire family benefited from what you're about to see.
[time=962] And now, before they view it, just share with the folks, maybe one thing that is they get ready to view this message that you'd want them to be thinking about, maybe open to that the Spirit of God might do in their hearts.
[time=974] Yeah, I want you to think about your life. I want to get into your life right now and think about something that may be troubling you, something you may be worried about, something that may keep you up late at night.
[time=989] Is it the children that you're worried about, or your finances, or your husband, or terrorism, or things going on in the world? What is it that has you maybe worrying?
[time=1003] Well, we want to show you from God's Word what the Word of God has to say about worry, what Jesus has to say about it, and what to do about it, because God's Word tells us not to worry, but it also tells us what to do with that worry.
[time=1023] God can handle anything you're dealing with and anything that you're going through. Amen.
[time=1032] I am so excited. I couldn't wait. I could hardly sleep. I love being with you, and I want to say that the respect we have for one another, it's mutual, the love we have, that's my covenant brother and my wife, Kala.
[time=1047] We'd like to get in that young married class, so they said it was just for zero to five years, and we've been there, what, six, seven? How many?
[time=1061] Twenty, twenty-one years old, Jesus. Who's counting? Well, anyway, we just, Carl and I just love us, some Kelly and Cabra Bird.
[time=1076] I mean, they're just wives hit it off, and we hit it off, and like I said, we can talk about anything and everything.
[time=1084] I know I'm special, not just because God says I am, but because of this man that God brought into my life and that he would want to have a friendship with me, I must be special, because that's a special guy.
[time=1098] And I know you appreciate it, don't you? Amen. I also want you to give his wife a hand. Not right now, but let me tell you something.
[time=1113] She got five kids. Amen. Now, pass his wife, and five kids, and the way that she supports her husband, I mean, one hundred percent, and that's special, and you don't find that every place.
[time=1131] So I think you ought to give her a hand as well.
[time=1140] And before I get into the word, I really want to do that. That's my comfort zone. I feel so comfortable with no tie, and I might get used to this.
[time=1155] But I want to say that from being here before, this is my second time being with you, I really just from my heart to yours, thank you for receiving me.
[time=1171] I mean, that may not seem like a big deal to you, but it means a lot that you will sit there and at least look like you listening to me.
[time=1181] But everybody has treated me so kind with so much warmth and acceptance, and that's just the way the body of Christ ought to be, the way that you are.
[time=1192] And just keep on being the way you are, because it's an awesome church, an awesome ministry, and I feel privileged that you would have me to come. Praise the Lord.
[time=1205] Well, we're going to get into the Word of God, and we've got a special message for you today that I could not wait to deliver to you.
[time=1215] And we're going to talk about something that may seem to be from Mars.
[time=1220] I know they sent something up to Mars, take some pictures and stuff.
[time=1224] This title may seem like it's weird, but it's possible to live a worry-free life.
[time=1234] And we're going to show you from God's Word how that you can live a worry-free life.
[time=1241] You know, how many of you, let me just take a little poll.
[time=1246] How many of you have ever worried about anything in your life?
[time=1251] I mean, you've never, okay, what about the rest of it?
[time=1255] You never, okay, but any, all of us, if we'd be honest, all of us have worried about something at one time or another.
[time=1263] And I was so glad I found out something years ago that helped me in my life and in my ministry how to live a care-free life.
[time=1273] The Bible also talks about it uses cares and worries many times interchangeably in the Bible.
[time=1281] And so we're going to look into the Scripture and show you how not to worry.
[time=1287] And first of all, we want to share with you what the Scripture says about worry in general and how that you don't have to worry.
[time=1297] The Scriptures instruct us not to worry. Turn to Matthew chapter 6.
[time=1307] We're going to be sharing from some different translations, but this is from the New King James version of the Bible.
[time=1316] In Matthew chapter 6, beginning in verse 25, therefore I say to you, do not worry about your life.
[time=1327] Boy, isn't that a word?
[time=1329] I mean, do you know that there are a lot of things that you could worry about?
[time=1334] There's a lot of things that people worry about, people worry about their children, people worry about their husband, people worry about their wife.
[time=1344] Some people worry about their job and whether or not they're going to be the next ones being laid off.
[time=1350] Some people worry about whether they're in laws will accept them when they get married.
[time=1355] Some people worry about whether somebody else cares for them or whether or not people will accept them.
[time=1363] Whether my church will accept me. People worry about all sorts of things.
[time=1369] Sometimes people worry about whether or not their husband is unfaithful.
[time=1375] So there's a lot of things. We have a lot of opportunities to worry.
[time=1380] But the Scripture tells us that we don't have to, no matter what it is, no matter how big or how small it is.
[time=1386] And the bottom line is that we have a Lord and Savior.
[time=1391] We have a Father God who loves us and cares for us so we can live a carefree life.
[time=1399] So hopefully we can get this across to you from the Word of God.
[time=1404] Again, verse 25, "Therefore I say to you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on.
[time=1414] Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing?
[time=1419] Look at the birds of the air for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them.
[time=1428] Are you not of more value than they?" Look, the Scripture tells us that we're more valuable than the birds.
[time=1437] That makes you wonder sometimes why some people like animal rights or animal rights friends like to equate people on the same level as an animal.
[time=1450] So they justify saving the whales and killing the babies.
[time=1456] Well, the Scripture says, "Are you of not more value than they?" The Scripture says that we are more valuable than birds.
[time=1467] Okay? So that's no knock on birds. God made the birds.
[time=1471] But we are made on a high class in whales.
[time=1476] See, we're made on a high class in birds. See, we're more valuable than they.
[time=1480] See, so the birds of the air, they don't sow or reap or gather into barns, but your heavenly Father takes care of them.
[time=1487] Are you not of more value than they?
[time=1492] Which of you by worrying can add one qubit to his stature?
[time=1501] Worry doesn't do you a bit of good.
[time=1504] Stop and think about it.
[time=1506] What one good thing has worrying ever brought about in your life?
[time=1515] Oh, don't tell me worry, doesn't do any good. All the things I worry about, they never happen.
[time=1527] You know many things that people worry about don't even happen anyway. Why worry about it?
[time=1533] But what good does it do? It doesn't do any good.
[time=1536] In fact, the Bible says that God never sleeps nor slumbers.
[time=1542] You know the Bible says that about God? He never sleeps nor slumbers.
[time=1545] So it's no use of me, no sense of me, stand up all night and both of us stand up.
[time=1552] God never sleeps nor slumbers. Let me give my words to him.
[time=1557] Let him take care of my words and I can go to sleep and he can stay up.
[time=1562] Some of you are going to sleep better after this.
[time=1567] I'm telling you because the Scripture gives us some very powerful truths about worry.
[time=1574] And the wonderful thing about God, one of the many wonderful things about God,
[time=1580] is that God will never require us to do something that we don't have the corresponding ability to do.
[time=1590] As the Scripture that you put up on the screen at the beginning of the service, if any man is in Christ, he is a new creation.
[time=1597] Old things have passed away, new things have come.
[time=1599] We've been made new creations. God has equipped us with the ability to give our worries to him.
[time=1608] He's given us the ability not to worry. It would be unjust for God to require us not to worry and we couldn't do it.
[time=1618] So, since God says that we don't have to worry, then we don't have to.
[time=1625] In fact, when God instructs us in his word to do something, now this is Jesus talking.
[time=1630] If you notice in your Bibles, this is in red letters. That means Jesus is talking.
[time=1635] And God doesn't give us like in the Old Testament when they talked about the Ten Commandments.
[time=1642] They're not the Ten Suggestions.
[time=1645] So, when God gives you instruction in his word, they're not optional.
[time=1651] You can do it if you want to. You will suffer the consequences if you don't.
[time=1655] But you're better off if you do it. And you're going to live a successful life.
[time=1659] If you do what God says, it's not a suggestion what God says. It is a command.
[time=1664] And God commands us not to worry. In fact, I'm going to show you a Scripture that might knock you off of your seat.
[time=1673] I'm going to show you a Scripture in a few moments that worry is listed in the same category as getting drunk.
[time=1683] Now, don't look at me in that tone of voice. I'm going to show you the Scripture.
[time=1688] Now, this is just me up here talking, but you don't have any obligation to accept that.
[time=1692] But I'm going to show you that in God's word.
[time=1694] No one would argue if I got up here and talked to you about the sins and all of the trouble that is associated with getting drunk.
[time=1702] You would say, "Oh, yes. That's right. Hey, man. Hallelujah. Glory to God. That's right."
[time=1710] But when we talk about worrying, we seem to accept that as a part of life, as everybody does it.
[time=1715] Well, everybody doesn't have to.
[time=1720] Now, which of you by worrying can add one cupid to his stature? So why do you worry about clothing?
[time=1732] Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They neither toil nor spin, and yet I said to you that even Solomon and all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
[time=1743] Now, if God so closed the grass of the field, which today is and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you or you of little faith?
[time=1754] Therefore, do not worry saying. Notice the word saying. Notice the progression.
[time=1762] It escalates from thinking about worry to saying it. In verse 25 it says, "Do not worry about your life."
[time=1772] Then it moves on to in verse 31, "Do not worry saying." Why is that?
[time=1781] Because Jesus said something that's very important. He said, "Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks."
[time=1791] Whatever you have in abundance, in other words, is eventually going to come out of your mouth.
[time=1796] And so if you have worry in your heart, it's going to come out of your mouth.
[time=1803] So at first, he said, "Do not worry about your life." But if you do worry, then you'll start saying, "Oh, what am I going to do about?"
[time=1812] "Oh, what's going to happen with the job?" You know, honey, they're starting to lay off. Yeah, I know I might be next.
[time=1819] You know, I hired in about the time, about 10 years ago, and it's my time, my time to go.
[time=1827] And I don't know what we're going to do. We're going to have all these bills, and the kids are in college, and I'm worried about the kids.
[time=1834] And the other people, I'm worried about my health. Oh, I'm worried about how our needs are going to be met.
[time=1842] And you start, you think that, and then eventually you'll start saying it.
[time=1848] Now, for after, verse 32, for after all these things, the Gentiles seek, for your Heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.
[time=1863] But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
[time=1871] In other words, God's going to take care of you when you put His kingdom first, and the Father, God is not, He is an awesome God, no doubt about it.
[time=1884] But He's also your Father.
[time=1888] A lot of people know God as the Almighty God, but they don't know Him as Father.
[time=1897] And all that we would get to know Him as Father, because the Father cares for us.
[time=1904] Even the little details of our life He cares about.
[time=1909] Can you say amen? Aren't you glad that He does?
[time=1914] The Father knows the things that you need in your life.
[time=1919] He knows your family needs provision.
[time=1922] He knows you need health in your body.
[time=1925] He knows what you need, and God has got it under control when you give it to Him.
[time=1932] Therefore, verse 34, do not worry about tomorrow.
[time=1936] For tomorrow we'll worry about its own things.
[time=1939] Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.
[time=1945] Worry, not only does the Scripture say not to do it, but our bodies are not designed to handle worry.
[time=1954] Worry is harmful to you, both physically and emotionally.
[time=1959] Even medical science has proven that worry can cause sickness and disease in your body.
[time=1965] Did you know that?
[time=1967] So it's not healthy for us to worry.
[time=1972] Let's look at Luke chapter 21.
[time=1976] This is the Scripture I promised to show you.
[time=1983] Does anybody get anything out of this this morning?
[time=1987] Well, holler at me every once in a while, let me know you're listening.
[time=1991] Let me know you're still alive.
[time=1999] Verse 34, Luke chapter 21, "But take heed to yourselves, lest your hearts be weighed down."
[time=2006] Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, somebody's saying, "Well, now hold on now." You're telling me not to worry.
[time=2012] How in the world is somebody going to do that?
[time=2014] I'm not finished yet.
[time=2016] Just hang on and evaluate it after I share everything with you, okay?
[time=2021] Because God not only tells us not to do something, but He also tells us how not to.
[time=2027] I love that about God.
[time=2028] He gives us the solution, tells us exactly what to do.
[time=2032] So hang on with me.
[time=2033] It is possible.
[time=2035] Everybody say it is possible not to worry.
[time=2041] Not because Pastor Jennings said it, but because Jesus said it.
[time=2048] My Bible says it.
[time=2051] My Bible says, "Do not worry." [AMEN] Take heed to yourselves, lest your hearts be weighed down with carousing drunkenness, drunkenness,
[time=2070] drunkenness.
[time=2071] Oh, I got stuck there.
[time=2074] And cares of this life and that they come on you unexpectedly.
[time=2080] Now, we're not going to talk about drunkenness, but look what is mentioned in the same breath
[time=2088] as drunkenness that cares of this life.
[time=2093] And not only that, the Scripture says your heart can be weighed down with these things.
[time=2101] Now, you don't need an expert to tell you how drunkenness can weigh your heart down and
[time=2108] the destruction that drunkenness will bring, but what about the destruction and the misery
[time=2115] and the trouble that worrying will do?
[time=2119] Your heart, I wonder if there's anybody here, your heart is weighed down with worry.
[time=2125] And I know because I'm a pastor, I deal with people all the time.
[time=2128] And people, there are people who have issues with worry.
[time=2132] Some of them, they cannot rest.
[time=2134] They cannot sleep because they're just worrying about things.
[time=2138] And listen, when you're worrying, it means that you're not trusting.
[time=2144] And God wants you to trust Him with your life, with your cares and your worries.
[time=2151] He doesn't want your heart to be weighed down with these things.
[time=2156] Not to worry is a decision.
[time=2161] It's an attitude.
[time=2162] You can decide.
[time=2163] You can make the decision that you're going to worry or not to.
[time=2167] You don't have to.
[time=2169] Just say no to worry.
[time=2171] Just say no to it.
[time=2173] I refuse to worry.
[time=2175] Because it's a passion, don't you?
[time=2177] Don't you have worries?
[time=2178] Listen, I have many opportunities to worry.
[time=2181] I have the same opportunities as you do.
[time=2184] In ministry, I not only have, I'm the head of my home.
[time=2188] I have a family that I'm responsible for.
[time=2191] I have a ministry.
[time=2192] I'm the CEO of a ministry.
[time=2196] I have a lot of things I could worry about.
[time=2199] But I decided not to.
[time=2202] Listen, let me tell you.
[time=2204] Let me just be real with you.
[time=2205] I have passed up some marvelous opportunities to worry.
[time=2212] I need some great opportunities to worry that have passed my way.
[time=2218] But I've learned to say pass a boo.
[time=2221] Pass on by.
[time=2224] I'm not going to accept it.
[time=2227] And sometimes, thank you, I will.
[time=2231] Sometimes people will bring things to me in ministry with a worry, some look on their face.
[time=2238] What are we going to do about this?
[time=2241] We're going to give it to the Lord.
[time=2242] That's what we're going to do.
[time=2244] Because ministry, see, Jesus said my yoke is easy.
[time=2250] And my burden is life.
[time=2251] I know that life have problems.
[time=2254] I'm not standing up here saying I don't have problems.
[time=2256] I have problems just like you.
[time=2258] But I don't worry about them.
[time=2262] They're going to be worked out because I'm going to give them to the Lord.
[time=2266] And you can do the same thing.
[time=2270] Because the Father cares for you.
[time=2274] And in ministry, it's so easy because I've decided that I'm going to give it to God.
[time=2282] And since I give it to God, I'm not going to receive the pressure.
[time=2286] And I talk to pastors.
[time=2288] They're worried about the ministry.
[time=2291] They're worried about the people.
[time=2293] And this and that.
[time=2296] But look, like television, we're on television.
[time=2298] I can worry about that.
[time=2300] Well, what if the money doesn't come in for television?
[time=2303] You know those people?
[time=2304] At the television station, we're on Fox.
[time=2306] You are on WPTA.
[time=2308] Do you know that just because we have wonderful praise and worship and that we love God here,
[time=2315] they still want money?
[time=2318] What's wrong with these people?
[time=2319] They want money.
[time=2321] They want it every week.
[time=2324] I mean, they send us a bill every month and they expect us to pay.
[time=2328] Rightfully so.
[time=2330] But do I worry about it?
[time=2332] Sometimes it doesn't look like the money's there.
[time=2337] But you know what?
[time=2338] I'm not worried about it.
[time=2339] Because I don't have to see myself on TV.
[time=2342] I'm on TV to get the word out to people.
[time=2346] And if God can't, the way I look at it, if God can't afford for the ministry to be on TV,
[time=2352] then he don't need it to be on.
[time=2354] We'll just go off there.
[time=2356] And I'll go on about my business, go to the coffee shop and still drink cappuccino and smile.
[time=2363] But some people, what would people think if you went off TV?
[time=2367] They would think that I went off TV.
[time=2370] I'm not worried about that.
[time=2372] You see, there's nothing to worry about.
[time=2374] Some people know what to do in their heart about spiritual issues, decisions they need to make,
[time=2380] but you know why?
[time=2381] Some people don't make them because they're worried about what Aunt Susie's going to say or what grandma's going to think.
[time=2389] Or what my best friend, whether or not she agrees with it or he agrees with it or not,
[time=2395] it doesn't matter.
[time=2396] You do what's right because it's right.
[time=2399] Regardless of somebody's opinion about it.
[time=2402] And that makes you free.
[time=2405] And one of the best things that can happen to you, I don't know if I told you this last year or not.
[time=2410] If I did, it's been a year.
[time=2413] One of the best things that can happen to you, and this will alleviate a lot of family pressure.
[time=2419] One of the best things that can happen to you is that your family thinks you're crazy.
[time=2425] See, then once they label you as crazy, you can do what you want.
[time=2432] Oh, that, you know, he's liable to do anything.
[time=2437] See, and you ought to be free from people pressure.
[time=2440] See, the way I look at it is God's ministry.
[time=2444] So he's taking care of it.
[time=2448] I'll lock the door.
[time=2449] I'm not going to beg people, and if you notice, if you ever watched our television broadcast, and I know that Pastor Kelly is the same way.
[time=2457] We're not begging for money.
[time=2459] Getting up there crying about, "Oh, if you don't send the money in."
[time=2466] I can't forget that stuff.
[time=2468] For what?
[time=2470] I mean, if God tells you to go on TV, he'll support it.
[time=2473] And if he doesn't support us, "Okay, Lord, if you want this broadcast, you better get
[time=2479] the money in, or we're going to go off, what you going to do about it?"
[time=2487] That's the same thing you do with your children.
[time=2490] Little Johnny acting up.
[time=2493] Give little Johnny to the Lord.
[time=2495] We're going to show you how to do that in a few moments.
[time=2497] Instead of you staying all night, God never sleeps with slumbers.
[time=2500] Let him deal with it.
[time=2501] Say, "Lord, I'm casting this care on you.
[time=2503] I'm casting little Johnny on you.
[time=2505] I know he's messing with the wrong crowd, but I'm not going to worry about that.
[time=2511] I'm giving little Johnny to you.
[time=2512] Now what you going to do about him?
[time=2514] Little Johnny is your problem now.
[time=2519] And that's not mind over matter.
[time=2521] There's scripture.
[time=2523] And I'm going to show you that in a few moments.
[time=2525] Now, another scripture.
[time=2530] Philippians 4-6, in case you're not convinced yet, the Amplified Bible, first part of verse
[time=2538] 6 says, "Something's wrong with that clock."
[time=2545] Do you ever notice that?
[time=2549] The pastor says, "It moves too fast."
[time=2558] Do not fret or have any anxiety.
[time=2564] You don't have to have anxiety attacks.
[time=2567] The scripture says, "Do not fret or have any anxiety about anything."
[time=2573] If you don't have any anxiety about anything, what does that leave you?
[time=2578] What does that leave you with?
[time=2581] How much anxiety does that leave you with?
[time=2584] Zero.
[time=2587] The new living translation says, "Do not worry or don't worry about anything.
[time=2593] Instead, pray about everything.
[time=2597] Tell God what you need and thank him for all he has done."
[time=2603] Oh, that's a good word for us.
[time=2609] Okay, okay, okay, okay, pastor.
[time=2612] So, I'm not supposed to worry.
[time=2614] All right.
[time=2615] So, what do I do with him?
[time=2617] I'm glad you asked that question.
[time=2619] What am I going to do with my worry?
[time=2624] We're going to teach you the prayer, a very powerful prayer.
[time=2627] If you learn how to pray this simple prayer, you can get rid of worries, once and for all.
[time=2634] It's the prayer of casting your care upon the Lord.
[time=2641] Let's look at 1 Peter chapter 5.
[time=2647] As we conclude this, let me give you what God says to do about your worries.
[time=2657] I'm going to read this out of the amplified Bible, and then we'll go to the message Bible.
[time=2663] Listen to this very carefully.
[time=2665] The Scripture says, "Casting the whole of your care.
[time=2670] All your anxieties.
[time=2673] All your worries.
[time=2675] All your concerns." Now, let me put a pen right here.
[time=2680] Notice this says all three times.
[time=2682] All your anxieties.
[time=2683] All your worries.
[time=2684] All your concerns.
[time=2686] That means you can't pray a prayer like this.
[time=2688] Oh, Lord, now, now, I've got this heavy load.
[time=2692] Now, I don't expect you to take all of them.
[time=2695] Lord, would you please just take half of them.
[time=2697] Take 50% of my load, and I can take the, I can carry the other 50%.
[time=2703] No, that's not scriptural.
[time=2705] The Scripture says, "The cast all." God, we're talking about, we're not talking about a man taking your cares.
[time=2712] Somebody who doesn't have the ability to do something about them.
[time=2715] It'll shut out.
[time=2716] The God who is more than enough.
[time=2718] God is more than able to handle all of your cares.
[time=2724] I mean, do you think that God can't handle them?
[time=2726] Do you think the God has bad days?
[time=2730] Maybe he's taking care of somebody's needs over in California, and he just got an overload.
[time=2737] Oh, don't you know?
[time=2738] I mean, like right after 9/11, you think God said, "Now, wait a minute.
[time=2741] World, please do not bring me anything.
[time=2744] I've got enough to deal with from 9/11." Once I get all that sorted out, and taking care of all those people's needs that lost their families and things, then I'll take care of you.
[time=2754] Can you just give me a break for a few minutes for a few days?
[time=2757] God does not like that.
[time=2758] God can't handle everybody's needs, everybody's worries, everybody's concerns in the whole world at the same time, because he's God.
[time=2768] Now, casting the whole of your care.
[time=2773] All your anxieties.
[time=2775] All your worries.
[time=2777] All your concerns.
[time=2779] See, casting, casting, that's a fisherman's term.
[time=2782] When a fisherman throws his line into the water, he casts.
[time=2785] In other words, he throws it to a point away from him.
[time=2791] See, so when you cast your care on God, you're throwing your care.
[time=2797] Everybody do this.
[time=2798] This won't make sure y'all are still awake.
[time=2801] Everybody's going to participate.
[time=2803] Everybody's on the drama team today.
[time=2805] Throw your cares on God.
[time=2807] Just throw them over on him now.
[time=2810] Casting the whole of your care.
[time=2814] All your anxieties.
[time=2816] All your worries.
[time=2818] All your concerns.
[time=2819] Once and for all on him, for he cares for you affectionately and cares about
[time=2827] you watchfully.
[time=2830] Isn't that good?
[time=2834] The message Bible says, "Live carefree before God.
[time=2838] He is most careful with you."
[time=2844] Now, some might say, aren't you being irresponsible?
[time=2849] Isn't that a cop-out?
[time=2851] Aren't you avoiding the situation?
[time=2854] No.
[time=2855] You're not irresponsible when you give your cares to God.
[time=2859] When you give your worries to God.
[time=2861] Because what you're doing, you're not ignoring what's going on.
[time=2866] You're not ignoring the situation.
[time=2868] But you're taking a situation which you're unable to do anything about and putting it into the hands of someone who has the ability to do something about it.
[time=2880] So through prayer, you're going to give the problem to God who is the only one that has
[time=2891] the problem to solve it.
[time=2895] And that, my friend, is not irresponsible.
[time=2897] That is the most responsible thing that you can do.
[time=2908] Here's something very important.
[time=2912] Before you can confidently take your cares to God, you must have the assurance that God
[time=2920] is trustworthy.
[time=2923] You've got to know from God's Word.
[time=2927] And God's Word is where we find out where we can be reassured that God is more than able
[time=2935] to handle your worries and your cares.
[time=2939] For example, let me mention some scriptures to you.
[time=2942] They're not on your screen, but I'm going to mention them to you and you can jot them down if you like.
[time=2947] These are some scriptures that remind you of God's care and concern for you.
[time=2955] And I encourage you, and I suggest to you strongly that before you just give your cares to God, that you, first of all, look into the scripture and find out scriptures
[time=2966] that talk about God's care and God's concern for you or scriptures that deal with what
[time=2977] you're praying about or what you're about to cast your care on God about.
[time=2984] For example, if it's about financial need, if you have cares about financial need, you can go to scriptures like Philippians 4 and 19, and my God shall supply all your need according to his riches and glory by Christ Jesus.
[time=2997] So you meditate on that, and that gives you assurance and confidence that God
[time=3004] is taking care of everything that you need.
[time=3007] You follow me?
[time=3008] Now, here's some scriptures about God's care and concern for you.
[time=3012] Romans 831 says, "If God is for us, who can be against us?"
[time=3019] Romans 421 tells us that God is, or that Abraham, referring to Abraham,
[time=3026] but we should be the same way, being fully convinced that what God had promised, he is able also to perform.
[time=3034] Psalm 34 verse 19 says, "Many evils confront the consistent
[time=3041] the consistently righteous." See, we're not exempt from problems.
[time=3046] Many evils confront us.
[time=3048] Many evils confront the consistently righteous, but the promise of God says, "But the Lord delivers him out of them all."
[time=3062] And then, Hebrews 13-5 talks about how God will never leave us or forsake us.
[time=3069] I love it out of the amplified.
[time=3071] The amplified does just that.
[time=3073] It amplifies the scripture.
[time=3075] And it says, Hebrews 13-5, it says, "For he God himself has said, I will not in any way fail you, nor give you up, nor leave you without support."
[time=3091] I'm going to say that again.
[time=3092] God himself has said, "I will not in any way fail you, nor give you up, nor leave
[time=3103] you without support.
[time=3104] I will not, I will not, I will not, the amplified mentions it three times.
[time=3110] I will not, in any degree, leave you helpless, nor forsake you, nor forsake,
[time=3118] nor let you down relax my hold on you, assuredly not."
[time=3126] So, by meditating on those scriptures, before you pray, you have assurance that God is able to handle what you're coming to him about,
[time=3137] what you're throwing on him.
[time=3141] Something else I want to mention, when you pray and are unloading on God,
[time=3147] do just that, just dump all of your worries on God.
[time=3151] Don't pray a little religious prayer like, "Oh Lord, I have these worries.
[time=3155] I give all my worries to you." Now, talk to God as your friend.
[time=3159] Talk to him like a friend.
[time=3162] Sometimes I go to the coffee shop and I overhear people.
[time=3165] They're talking and I'm in there studying and you can't help but hear them.
[time=3169] It's the table right next to you and they're talking about their worries about their husband and what he's doing and worried about this and they're talking to their friend and they just dump it on them.
[time=3181] You ever have somebody do that to you?
[time=3183] They just don't tell you, "Well, I'm having a bad day." They dump everything, all the gory details.
[time=3188] That's the way you do God.
[time=3190] When you come to God with your worries, say, "Lord, bring him your laundry list." I mean, be specific.
[time=3197] Bring him, detail it.
[time=3199] "Lord, I'm dealing with this. I'm dealing with this." This is instruction.
[time=3205] This is class this morning.
[time=3207] I want to show you, when I leave here, I want you to know exactly what to do.
[time=3210] Some of you got some work to do.
[time=3213] Get along with God.
[time=3214] I'm serious about this.
[time=3215] I'm serious.
[time=3216] I'm not just preaching a message.
[time=3218] I want to help your life.
[time=3220] I want to help those of you that are dealing with worry.
[time=3222] I really want you to overcome that thing because it says casting the whole of your care once and for all on him.
[time=3232] If you do that, God's got it.
[time=3235] If God's got it, that means you don't.
[time=3238] That makes you free.
[time=3240] What I want you to do, I want you to detail all of God.
[time=3243] Look, Lord, if you have to write it down, do it.
[time=3245] Just tell Lord to hear it is.
[time=3246] This is it.
[time=3247] This is my life as we speak.
[time=3250] I'm worried about all of this.
[time=3252] I'm giving it to you.
[time=3255] Like Pastor Jennings said, no, like your words says, I'm casting it over on you.
[time=3262] I'm trusting you now to deal with it for you care for me.
[time=3270] Now, by giving your cares to God in faith, you are trusting him to take care of you and
[time=3282] everything that concerns you.
[time=3287] Now, I'm basically finished, but I want to leave you with one illustration.
[time=3293] I need a strong man to come and help me.
[time=3296] I think I'm going to get somebody like six, seven that sits on the front row.
[time=3302] [AMEN] I want your pastor to come.
[time=3305] He's going to help me out with this.
[time=3310] Now, imagine I'm on my way to Black Hop this morning.
[time=3317] Instead of driving, I decide to walk.
[time=3320] And I'm going to take with me some sound equipment because I want to help Corbin out.
[time=3325] I want to get some musical instruments.
[time=3328] I'm going to even get some few pieces of sound equipment.
[time=3331] I'm going to bring my own podium so it makes me feel at home.
[time=3334] I'm going to get something I'm used to.
[time=3337] Well, I get all of that stuff and I tie it on my back.
[time=3343] I got a heavy load and I'm on my way to church.
[time=3347] I'm on my way to Black Hop.
[time=3350] I'm going down State Street with this big load.
[time=3355] Oh, man.
[time=3356] It looked like I can hardly make it.
[time=3358] I mean, beads of sweat is dripping off of my forehead.
[time=3363] And then Pastor Bird, he's coming along the street.
[time=3367] And he looks over.
[time=3368] He takes a second look.
[time=3369] He said, "Wait a minute.
[time=3370] That looks like Pastor Jennings." He's supposed to speak for me today.
[time=3374] What is that on his back?
[time=3376] What is he doing?
[time=3377] So he pulls over and his pickup truck.
[time=3379] And he says, "Pastor Jennings, what are you doing?" Oh, I thought I would help you out today.
[time=3384] I've got some sound equipment.
[time=3385] I've got some instruments.
[time=3387] I've got some stereo equipment.
[time=3389] I've got a podium.
[time=3391] Man, what are you doing with that?
[time=3393] Can I help you?
[time=3394] I said, "Oh, thank you." So he reaches over and he pulls all of that stuff off, man.
[time=3401] Come on.
[time=3402] I've got some more stuff you've got to get.
[time=3404] [laughter] Yeah, come on.
[time=3408] Get it all.
[time=3409] I've got a lot of stuff, man.
[time=3412] All right.
[time=3413] Now, okay.
[time=3414] Whew.
[time=3415] I'm so glad he helped me out with that.
[time=3417] Thank you so much.
[time=3419] In the Baptist Church, when I was growing up, we used to sing this song or else I would hear
[time=3429] it said.
[time=3430] I don't know if it was a song, but you'd hear this statement.
[time=3433] "Take your burdens to the Lord and leave them there."
[time=3439] I would see people come up to the altar and seem like they would give their burdens to
[time=3445] God, that's what they were supposed to do, but then they'd go back to their seat with them.
[time=3450] But anyway, look at me.
[time=3453] Now, he took it.
[time=3454] He put it in his pickup truck and he's on his way.
[time=3457] Okay?
[time=3458] Got a picture?
[time=3459] Now, here I go.
[time=3461] Here I go.
[time=3464] Thank you.
[time=3465] Thank you, Pastor Kelly.
[time=3470] I'm so glad you took that heavy load.
[time=3474] Why are you laughing?
[time=3477] Why should I be walking this way?
[time=3480] See, he's got it, and I don't.
[time=3484] I should be free.
[time=3487] Whew.
[time=3488] It's all for me, but I'm still acting like I have it.
[time=3490] That's what some of you do when you go to God with your worries.
[time=3493] Some of you are not really fully convinced of his faithfulness and his ability to take care of you.
[time=3499] But I encourage you to meditate on the promises of God and understand that God is more than able to handle every single worry, no matter how big or small, and care for you affectionately,
[time=3511] and care about you watchfully, and when you roll your cares on God, that means he has it.
[time=3520] Who has it?
[time=3523] Who doesn't?
[time=3526] That makes you F-R-E-E free.
[time=3531] Amen?
[time=3533] I'm over my time.
[time=3535] Pastor.
