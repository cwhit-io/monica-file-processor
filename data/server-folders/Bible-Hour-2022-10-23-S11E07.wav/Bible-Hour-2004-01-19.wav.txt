[time=0] [MUSIC - 92 seconds]
[time=94] And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us God from the evil one.
[time=100] [MUSIC - 202 seconds]
[time=306] Father, we come together this morning to bring you honor that is due you.
[time=312] Your name is glorious and your name is wonderful. Your name is above every other name.
[time=320] We recognize that this morning and we ask God that you would be pleased with the sacrifice of music
[time=328] and the sacrifice of praise that we bring to you.
[time=334] Can we all close and pray that prayer all the way through?
[time=340] Let's pray together our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be your name.
[time=346] By kingdom come, by will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[time=352] Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us for trespasses
[time=358] as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[time=368] For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever.
[time=374] [AMEN] [MUSIC - 160 seconds]
[time=558] It was a life changing experience. It's one of the most impactful, encouraging, disturbing, all at the same time, hope giving things I've ever seen.
[time=575] And I cannot begin to tell you, at least from my own heart, it's just one man's opinion, but I cannot begin to describe to you
[time=585] the potential impact and the opportunity that I believe God is bringing.
[time=593] This country, our city, as this picture, this picture that he paints and the way in which it's told, it is so very biblically accurate
[time=607] and it is so unbelievably powerful. And February 25th, it's coming. And we will talk more in the days to come about the part that we're hoping God will allow us to play in that here locally.
[time=623] But today I just wanted to, they're going to roll what is kind of an intro piece to the clip, and I'm going to just sit down and let them roll that.
[time=630] I'm going to come back up and tell you a few more things. Then we're going to watch the actual trailer to the film.
[time=636] And we just want you to begin to be more and more exposed to the incredible power of what God has put together here and the opportunity that we believe he's giving us.
[time=646] So just watch and we'll talk a little bit more here in a sec.
[time=666] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[time=692] When I say to you that it was life-changing, you know me, I wouldn't say that to you flippantly.
[time=715] And I mean that with all my heart. I have never in my life been in a situation like that. I've never been in a theatre with two, three hundred people, much less a room of 5,000.
[time=727] And at the conclusion of the film, we viewed kind of a rough cut. It's not even in its final form yet. They're still working to this day to get it completed.
[time=737] At the conclusion of it, I felt, I literally, and it just dawned on me, then I didn't think this during it, but at the end it dawns on me that I felt deep in my heart as if I had been watching this thing by myself.
[time=752] The entire time I was completely unaware of who was around me and what was going on around me within five minutes.
[time=764] The unfolding story, this gospel biblical account and how he brings this thing to life, it had just captivated me.
[time=774] And I didn't know what to think at times. I wasn't even quite sure what to say. You know how sometimes you have conversations with yourself as you watch something on a screen.
[time=782] You almost don't even know what to think. And I will tell you this. I won't say a lot, but I will tell you this, that I just found myself, and I wrote this in my note that some of you got, but I just said to myself, I just found myself saying it to him.
[time=796] Over and over and over again through the entirety of the picture, I just, all I could say was, I am so sorry.
[time=807] I am so very sorry that I did that to you, that you had to do this in order to have me.
[time=822] It is just so unbelievably powerful.
[time=828] It is incredibly, and you'll hear folks talk about this, and it's important that we just get on the same page here.
[time=835] It has received from the National Motion Picture Association an R rating.
[time=841] And you know that for some that will be an issue.
[time=845] For some, and hear me now, for some it should be an issue. Mel Gibson, who was there at the screening when we were there, and we got a chance to hear from him afterwards.
[time=855] And I've heard from Dr. Dobson as well, who has seen it I think a couple of times.
[time=860] They're both saying about 12 to 13 years of age, you know, and up is probably appropriate.
[time=867] But it's something that obviously you as parents will have to kind of contemplate and think through.
[time=873] It was the most graphic and disturbingly violent thing I've probably ever seen in my life.
[time=883] But you see what separates it from Hollywood, what separates it from what the industry usually, you know, typically puts out with the R rating.
[time=892] See, in this case the violence is in no way glorified.
[time=897] In no way is immorality championed, in no way is sin made to look, you know, that's what usually happens.
[time=904] In this case really I've heard it said before, and it's true the R rating really should just be for reality.
[time=912] And I think it's important that we remember that what he endured and what he faced, what he suffered and was willing to walk through was incredibly brutal.
[time=921] It was bloody. It was probably one of the worst things that's ever happened to a human being.
[time=931] And they just show it.
[time=935] And it is something that I would hope, again, wherever it's appropriate.
[time=941] You know, our hope is that we would just as a family, that we would as a community, that those of us that follow Christ and have surrendered our hearts and lives to Him
[time=950] would see this as an opportunity.
[time=953] And I believe it's true, I believe millions will come.
[time=956] Having seen it for myself, I believe thousands in this community will go.
[time=960] And I believe thousands of them that go will be stirred in their hearts and moved to ask questions.
[time=966] They will be challenged to wrestle with issues.
[time=970] And the question is, are you and I going to be personally ready with those that will take, with those that will invite?
[time=979] Will we be ready to have those conversations, to roll up our sleeves with them?
[time=984] And will we as a church be ready? Because they will, I believe, with all my heart, they will come through those doors after seeing something like this.
[time=992] And they will want to understand and know more about the truth.
[time=998] And so, as you watch this, this is a brief intro by Mel Gibson himself, he was fascinating.
[time=1005] He talked about the total absolute brokenness of his own life.
[time=1010] At the age of 35, right in the middle of the lethal weapon, surge at the peak, at the pinnacle of his career, he talked about a personal emptiness and brokenness.
[time=1023] He talked about the age of 17 to 35, where he just walked away from his faith and his relationship with Christ.
[time=1030] And how at the age of 35, at the absolute bottom of the moral, spiritual, personal barrel, when society viewed him at the absolute top, there was an emptiness.
[time=1043] And he said he just came back, bowed the knee of his heart, he said, bowed his heart to the Lord, and committed once again to live and walk with him in a way that would honor him.
[time=1052] And purposed in his heart to do something that would make a difference someday.
[time=1058] And so for the last 12 years, he said he'd been chewing on this and giving himself to this.
[time=1064] Nobody would make the film, he went to all the major studios, nobody wanted to touch it.
[time=1069] So he dropped about 30 million of his own dollars to pay for it and to bring it so the world could see the truth.
[time=1078] So watch this brief intro by him and then a trailer and we'll move on.
[time=1083] I'd like to take the opportunity to thank you for your support for my new film, The Passion of the Christ.
[time=1089] I know you're out there and your prayers and support have given me strength to face the challenges of actually getting this film out.
[time=1096] My hope is that it's message will change people's lives, remind them of the enormity of the sacrifice that was made for us all.
[time=1102] It's a story I believe in and it's a message the whole world needs to hear right now particularly I think.
[time=1132] [MUSIC - 93 seconds]
[time=1230] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, Senior Pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=1234] And I'm so thankful that you're with us again.
[time=1237] I want you to know as we move into our message here this week that today is some really, really serious stuff.
[time=1247] I mean, I guess it's always important anytime you open up God's Word.
[time=1251] But today as we come to our passage in this ongoing study of 1 Thessalonians, we come to a passage, a message that we actually started a couple of weeks ago.
[time=1263] And today we're going to conclude it and its subject matter is really, really important.
[time=1269] And I guess I just wanted to say to you, we've established a relationship in a way.
[time=1275] And I think a lot of you know that I care deeply for you and the spiritual journey that you're on.
[time=1282] And this passage that we come to today is for all of us an opportunity to stop and pause and consider again the very real fact
[time=1292] that there is this thing called eternity.
[time=1296] You and I are, in essence, immortal.
[time=1300] We will go on forever.
[time=1303] God's Word says it's true.
[time=1305] The question isn't will we go on forever?
[time=1308] We're going to. The question is where?
[time=1311] And today's message we've entitled two very different Eternities because, you know, in the end, that's how it's going to be.
[time=1319] There will be some who in the end will have chosen to surrender their hearts and lives to Him.
[time=1325] And they will be a people who have accepted the truth about God.
[time=1330] They've accepted the Word of God. They've given themselves to the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1336] There will be a people, Paul says, who we will celebrate.
[time=1341] And there will be some who we will grieve for.
[time=1345] There will be some in the end, and their eternity will be very, very different.
[time=1351] The Bible talks about it being eternal separation from God. It's a place called hell.
[time=1357] And sometimes we don't talk a lot about hell.
[time=1361] But it's important for you and I to just today come to terms with the fact again that that's the way it is.
[time=1367] There is a place called heaven, and there is a place called hell.
[time=1371] And the way in which somebody finds themselves in hell, the reason that that happens you'll see today is because certain choices get made.
[time=1385] Nobody sends you there.
[time=1388] We choose to reject certain things.
[time=1392] We choose to move away from certain gifts that have been made available.
[time=1397] We choose to move away from the forgiveness of sin and the life with him that he's offered.
[time=1405] And so I just, wherever you are on your journey today, I hope you will listen and open your heart to what God's Word has to say for you.
[time=1414] I also just wanted to ask you to do this.
[time=1416] If God's been at work in your life, through the ministry of Blackhawk or through the ministry of the Bible hour, he's been teaching you.
[time=1425] He's been growing you.
[time=1427] He's been doing things in your life, and you know it.
[time=1430] You're different today because of his work in you.
[time=1434] Maybe in your relationship with him, you've grown and discovered new truths about living in relationship with him.
[time=1441] Maybe you don't know him yet, but you sense him moving you toward faith.
[time=1446] Either way, would you shoot me an email?
[time=1449] My email address is right here on the screen, and I would just love to encourage our people, and especially the Bible hour team, as you would share your story of spiritual growth, him doing great things in your life.
[time=1463] We'd love to hear about it.
[time=1464] Would you just take a few minutes and share that with me?
[time=1467] I would love to pass it on and encourage those who give so much time and effort to this special, special ministry.
[time=1475] Thank you very much.
[time=1478] We'll open your Bibles, if you would, to 1 Thessalonians.
[time=1481] 1 Thessalonians chapter 2, and we're going to continue and conclude this morning a message we started two weeks ago, two very different Eternities.
[time=1491] Two very different Eternities, and let me start out this morning by just having you ask yourself a question.
[time=1499] Ask yourself this question today.
[time=1501] How does somebody end up in hell?
[time=1506] There's a house after a starter.
[time=1509] How does somebody end up in hell?
[time=1512] A very real place that the Bible specifically describes a place of eternal separation from God, a place of great fire, a place of great pain, a place of great misery.
[time=1528] Hell, eternally separated from God.
[time=1532] How is it that somebody ends up in hell?
[time=1538] I want you to think about that, and I want you to think about that, especially in light of our passage that we come back to this morning because in our passage people we get an answer to that question.
[time=1549] Would you in honor of God's word stand with me this morning as we read through again 1 Thessalonians chapter 2 verses 13 through 16.
[time=1557] It reads as follows, "For this reason," Paul, here writing to the church at Thessalonica, "for this reason we also constantly thank God, that when you receive the word of God which you heard from us, you accepted it, not as the word of men, but for what it really is, the word of God, which also performs its work in you who believe.
[time=1578] For you, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus that are in Judea, for you also endured the same sufferings at the hands of your own country, and even as they did from the Jews who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets and drove us out.
[time=1598] They are not pleasing to God, but hostile to all men, hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they might be saved with the result that they always, that they always fill up the measure of their sins, but wrath has come upon them to the utmost.
[time=1618] Father, we come before you, and we come again this morning before your word, believing your word to be so very powerful, so very right, so very true, and so very able God to change us, to grow us, to shape us, to warn us, to encourage us, to admonish us, to reveal new truth to us, God it sees into our lives, and it speaks to us so very personally.
[time=1646] And today, God, I pray, that your spirit and your word would do just that, speak to the hearts of those who come into this room today, change us wherever it is, God, that we need to go on our own spiritual journey with you, God, move us further in that direction.
[time=1665] In your son's name, we pray. Amen. You can be seated. Last time, two weeks ago, if you'll remember, as we broke down this passage, we realized that there were basically two groups of people that Paul refers to here.
[time=1679] Number one, there were people whose choices we could celebrate. There were people, in this case, the Thessalonians, and Paul says, in essence, that there are a group of people whose choices we could celebrate, and there was a reason for Paul's gratitude.
[time=1695] There was a reason that Paul could, and you and I can, in our world today with some, there's a reason we can celebrate some people.
[time=1705] There is a reason we can celebrate their choices, because their choices are worthy of celebration. We saw a couple there in the first part of that passage.
[time=1716] Number one, a reason why Paul celebrated the Thessalonians was they received God's word.
[time=1723] They received God's word. You may remember our discussion in our look at that. Verse 13, for this reason, we also constantly thank God that when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it.
[time=1738] Not as the word of men, but for what it really is, the word of God. You'll remember if you were here that there are some, there were some in this arena, and there are some in this arena today.
[time=1749] There are those of you here in this room, and you love taking it in. You have surrounded yourself with it. You read it. You meditate on it. You chew on it.
[time=1759] You listen to it. You sing it. I mean, you have done your best, and you're continuing in that effort to have your life be a life that is influenced, not necessarily so much by culture or opinion, but by the truth.
[time=1773] You receive it. You accept it. You take it in. You believe it, and it does its work in your life.
[time=1782] At the end of that section there, he goes on to talk about the work that it performs in them, the work that it performs in them, but for what it really is, the word of God, which also, end of 13, which also performs its work in you.
[time=1800] And we prayed that just a minute ago. We recognized before God that it does. It gives us hope. It brings success. It brings blessing.
[time=1807] It enlightens. It warns. It comforts. It renews. It does all of that.
[time=1813] We also saw two weeks ago that there was a second reason why Paul celebrated the Thessalonians, and there's a second reason why you and I can celebrate some in our midst, some of the choices.
[time=1826] How do they accept the word of God? But there was also the fact that some endured suffering, and you can write that down if you're catching up from a couple of weeks ago.
[time=1836] There are some who receive God's word, and that's worthy of celebrating. There are others that endure suffering, and we spent, look at verse 14, for you brethren became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus, for you also endured the same sufferings at the hands of your own country.
[time=1854] Last time we were here in this passage, we spent a great deal of time. You remember talking about literal physical persecution.
[time=1862] And how in this day and age, here in our world, this world that you and I live in here, in the everyday of you and I living out our faith, we were readily admitting the fact that we don't see a lot of what some see in this world today.
[time=1880] There are Christ followers in this world who today fear for their lives. There are small gatherings of Christ followers who today meet in secret.
[time=1891] It's really happening, it really goes on, but we don't see much of that. And the point was made two weeks ago that maybe we should see more of it,
[time=1903] because we were readily admitting the fact that oftentimes persecution comes when the enemy senses that there is a movement, when the enemy senses that there are a people whose light is about to shine really bright, he comes.
[time=1919] And so we talked a bit about the literal physical persecution. I want to just come back briefly though and just make sure we're on the same page because I don't mean in saying that, I don't mean in any way that you and I don't experience persecution.
[time=1936] I mean, legitimate, valid suffering. There were several circumstances that kind of came across my path in the last week or so that reminded me of this. You may be married to a spouse, you may have a husband, you may have a wife who absolutely hates your faith.
[time=1957] You may be a man or a woman trying to live out your relationship with Christ, you may be doing your best to follow him and honor him and you may live daily with somebody who cannot stand what you believe and how you live and what you're devoted to.
[time=1973] He or she may even be antagonistic to you. They may say things, they may do things, they may do their best to make life miserable for you because they are so opposed to what you believe.
[time=1990] And I know that's not torture, I know that's not kidnapping, I know that's not physical abuse, but I want to make sure we understand its persecution.
[time=2001] And you have to live with that, some of you. Others of you have family and friends and the holidays are not pleasant times for you. Some of you have brothers and sisters or aunts and uncles and they can't stand the way you live your life.
[time=2018] And they say it and they communicate and it might be in a quick jab here or there, it might be in all out family war.
[time=2027] But there are some here in the room this morning and you live with the punishment, you live with the persecution that comes from doing your best with his help to live out your faith in a setting where it gets absolutely scrutinized.
[time=2041] Absolutely persecuted, you get punished for being who you are.
[time=2049] I was getting gas this week over at Marsh. It's quite a place Marsh, have you checked that out yet?
[time=2060] I was getting gas over there and was just pumping away there and I look over and there's a guy pumping gas right across from me.
[time=2069] He was wrapping it up, I had just kind of started and he looked at me and I looked at him and kind of, you know, I think I just smiled and he was just kind of staring at me.
[time=2078] And then I could tell it was that Bible hour, look, which is okay, it's no big deal. I don't mind it. I'm really grateful for people who take the time to say anything, you know, something.
[time=2092] So he got in his car, he drives around the island, he comes back over next to me on this side and he stops and he gets out and he walks right up to me.
[time=2101] But pleasant guy, younger than me, dressed pretty well like young professional, maybe late 20s, early 30s.
[time=2110] And very matter of fact, very kindly almost comes up and says, "Hey, you're the guy that's on the Bible hour." And I said, "Yeah, I am."
[time=2120] And he said, "I bet a lot of people stop you and thank you for what you do. I bet a lot of people stop and voice their appreciation for your message and your ministry."
[time=2131] And I said, "Well, sometimes yeah, it's very, very encouraging and before I could get that out," he said, "I'm not one of them."
[time=2141] And he wasn't looking for a fight. I didn't feel physically threatened at all. But very matter of fact, he looked me right in the eye and he said, "I am not one of them."
[time=2153] He said, "I believe you to be rude, narrow-minded, and most importantly, I believe you to be wrong."
[time=2164] So I said, "Wow, it's cold out here, isn't it?"
[time=2176] You know, what do you say? I said, "Okay." And it was like eight degrees and I was dying and I think he was really getting cold too.
[time=2185] And I said, "Well, hey, thanks for..." And I wasn't being sarcastic and I didn't say it, you know, with any kind of combat. I just said, "Thanks for telling me."
[time=2194] And he said, "Well, you have a good day." And I said, "I'll sure try." And he turned around and just as a matter of fact, he got back in his car and off he went.
[time=2204] Now we can laugh about that, you know, and I understand that. And there's a part of me that shrugged it off.
[time=2210] There's a part of me that, and you know me, I'm a king-people pleaser so I didn't sleep for two days.
[time=2216] I wanted to figure out, if I could remember his license plate and track him down, I apologize.
[time=2221] But there's a part of that that just hurts too.
[time=2225] There's a part of that where you just, who in the world like somebody coming up to you and telling you, you're rude and you're wrong. And I don't buy it.
[time=2234] And it just reminds me, you know, I didn't get taken away and I didn't get hit and my family didn't lose me, but it's out there.
[time=2245] It's out there and we need to be a people who endure that well.
[time=2253] And Paul celebrates those who accepted the word and endured suffering.
[time=2259] As the passage continues though, there's a second group of people that he says we will in time grieve for.
[time=2267] Not celebrate, mind you, but there is a second group of people who we will in time grieve for or better said we will grieve the choices that they've made.
[time=2279] Why? What choices did they make or maybe better said what choices didn't they make?
[time=2287] Well, he explains that for us as the passage continues.
[time=2291] You see, there are some that reject God's word.
[time=2295] There were some that we celebrate who accepted it.
[time=2299] There are some who we will grieve for because number one, they rejected God's word.
[time=2305] Look at verse 15, who both killed, who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets and drove us out.
[time=2314] They are not pleasing to God.
[time=2318] We'll stop there.
[time=2320] You see the Lord Jesus, John chapter one says was the word.
[time=2324] Write that down.
[time=2326] John chapter one, you can read those first four or five verses.
[time=2329] You see there, John describing Jesus Christ as the word.
[time=2334] And we know that Jesus Christ was the word, that he brought the word, that he taught the word, that he proclaimed the word.
[time=2342] There's the word personified.
[time=2344] And we know from the history of this great book that the Old Testament prophets before him had done the same thing.
[time=2352] They had proclaimed and delivered God's word.
[time=2355] And the Jewish nation had rejected that word.
[time=2360] It was clear, it was persistent, it was offered again and again and again and again.
[time=2366] And they did not receive it.
[time=2370] Thessalonians accepted the Jews rejected, the word of God rejected.
[time=2376] This had been going on, this rejection of truth had been going on for generations.
[time=2382] Look at the screen with me, let's just look at a few, we could look at many.
[time=2387] These would just be a few examples of this kind of mindset, this kind of attitude, this kind of response to the word of God.
[time=2395] We'll go to 1 Kings, 1 Kings chapter 19, just look with me and then we're going to turn somewhere in just a minute.
[time=2403] 1 Kings 19, 9, then he came there to a cave and lodged there and behold, the word of the Lord came to him and he said to him, what are you doing there, Elijah?
[time=2419] And he said, I have been very zealous, God says, what are you doing here, Elijah?
[time=2425] And Elijah says, I have been very zealous for the Lord, the God of hosts, for the sons of Israel have forsaken your covenant, torn down your altars and killed your prophets with the sword.
[time=2438] And I alone am left and they seek my life to take it away.
[time=2442] Go over to 2 Chronicles, just a few books over, go to 2 Chronicles 24.
[time=2448] It says in 2 Chronicles 24, here we have the story of Zechariah, then the Spirit of God came on Zechariah, the son of Jehoida, the priest, and he stood above the people Zechariah did and said to them, here comes the word of God to the people, and he said to them, thus God has said, why do you transgress the commandments of the Lord and do not prosper?
[time=2471] Because he says you have forsaken the Lord, he has also forsaken you, so their response to the word, so they conspired against him, and at the command of the king they stoned in the death in the court of the house of the Lord.
[time=2486] Thus Joash the king did not remember the kindness which his father Jehoida had shown him. Go to Jeremiah, go to Jeremiah, Jeremiah chapter 26.
[time=2501] Here I believe we come to the story of Uriah, Jeremiah 26 verse 20. Indeed there was also a man who prophesied in the name of the Lord, Uriah, the son of Shemaiah, from Qirath Jareem, and he prophesied against this city and against this land, words similar to all those of Jeremiah, when King Jehoiah came, and all his mighty men, and all the officials,
[time=2529] heard his words, the word of God coming to them, when they heard his words, then the king sought to put him to death.
[time=2537] But Uriah heard it, and he was afraid and fled and went to Egypt, no big deal to Jehoiah Kim, then King Jehoiah Kim sent men to Egypt.
[time=2545] El Nathan, the son of Aukbor, and certain men with him went into Egypt, and they brought Uriah from Egypt, and led him to King Jehoiah Kim, who personally killed him, who slew him with a sword, and cast his dead body into the burial place of the common people.
[time=2564] And look what it says back in Hebrews. Hebrews in the New Testament back toward the back, but it looks back toward the Old Testament, especially in this passage, Hebrews 11, pick it up in verse 32.
[time=2578] Hebrews 11, verse 32, "And what more shall I say? For time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jepthah, of David, and Samuel, and of the prophets, who by faith conquered kingdoms, performed acts of righteousness, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions, quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight.
[time=2604] Women received back their dead by resurrection, and others were tortured, not accepting their release so that they might obtain a better resurrection, and others watched this, and others experienced mockings and scourgings.
[time=2618] Yes, also chains and imprisonment, they were stoned, they were sawn into, they were tempted, they were put to death with the sword, they went about in sheep skins and goat skins, being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated, men of whom the world was not worthy, wandering in deserts and mountains and caves and holes in the ground.
[time=2642] They rejected the word of God, they had no time for it, they had no interest in it, and then in the New Testament with Jesus they reject the ultimate word, and as I sit there and watch that movie this week, my oh my, to say they rejected him would just be understating it.
[time=2671] Somebody here in this room has been doing the very same thing, and I'm not going to slap you on the wrist, I'm not going to point you out, I don't know who you are, I just know there are people in this room, and you haven't killed him, you didn't kill him literally, but you know what, figuratively you're killing him.
[time=2694] You are killing him because you are rejecting what he did for you, and you are rejecting this word of truth, that you know down deep on your soul can give you life and guidance and direction and hope, but there are some in this room this morning and you are just for whatever reasons, and I kind of understand, but I kind of don't.
[time=2723] You are just so very committed, you are just so certain that somewhere out there on this road you're chasing down, somewhere out there you're going to find some fulfillment.
[time=2738] Somehow, outside the parameters of this you're going to find some way to have life the way you want it to be, and I sit in my office and I beg people, and I don't do it sarcastically and I don't do it combatively, I'll beg people, sitting there in my office, I'll be sitting in a booth at some restaurant, I've done it publicly from here, I just say to anybody on that road, just go ahead.
[time=2767] I mean go ahead and show me, bring to me, show me this road traveled outside the parameters of this, show me your road traveled outside the parameters of this and show me, come show me all the peace that it's brought you.
[time=2787] I just want to see it, and I'll leave you alone, and I'll shut up, show me all the fulfillment that it's brought your life, show me all the joy, show me all the meaningful fulfillment that it has brought to your life.
[time=2812] It's just not there, it's just not going to happen, nobody's ever going to take me up on it because it doesn't bring peace, it doesn't bring joy, it doesn't bring fulfillment.
[time=2828] These people rejected the Word of God and see some of you come into this room every week, some of you come every once in a while, some of you watch the broadcast every once in a while, and you hear the truth, he does for you what he did to the Jewish nation.
[time=2844] He presents the truth again and again and again, some of you have husbands or wives or even kids who speak, try to speak truth into your life.
[time=2855] You've got good friends and they are faithfully walking alongside you saying here, please consider this, and you have a choice to make.
[time=2869] You have a decision to think through.
[time=2873] Some reject the Word, and for them someday we'll grieve, others hinder the Gospel, let's keep going, last part of 1 Thessalonians 2, 15.
[time=2884] Some reject the Word, others hinder the Gospel who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets and drove us out, they are not pleasing to God but hostile to all men, hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved with the result,
[time=2901] but they always fill up the measure of their sins, we'll come back and hit that. Some hinder the Gospel, write that down.
[time=2906] You see, unlike the Thessalonians, the Jews tried desperately to keep the Gospel from spreading, they had rejected the Messiah, labeling Jesus a satanic counterfeit.
[time=2918] That came through in the movie this last week, stronger than in any setting I had ever seen that or considered that.
[time=2925] These people thought him to be, believed him to be, had convinced themselves that this guy was satanic.
[time=2934] The aggression and the energy with which they devoured him, beat him, tortured him, had him murdered, I mean, they were convinced that he was a satanic counterfeit.
[time=2946] And their animosity toward him and the truth leads to, as our text indicates, an open hostility toward all men.
[time=2953] These were not happy people. These were hard-hearted, small-hearted, angry people, and they refused.
[time=2962] They did in Paul's day, they did in our Lord Jesus Christ's day, and they still, due to this day, they refused to believe the Gospel.
[time=2972] They hated those who tried to share and proclaim it, and they went to great lengths to stop its progress, to hinder its progress, to shut it down.
[time=2984] A quick note on this, you know some people, possibly, who would fit into this camp.
[time=2991] I know several whose animosity is such that it's gone past just rejecting it.
[time=2999] Now they're going to do something about it. They are so against it, and they are so against me, and they are so against this.
[time=3008] You may not know somebody, but you know what? We see it. You and I, we see it on television.
[time=3014] You see it in the media. You listen to people in interviews, don't you?
[time=3019] We see it in the newspaper, and I understand just a quick word to you on this.
[time=3024] I understand that there's a part of us that just hears that, sees that, encounters that, and we want to kind of fight back.
[time=3031] We want to defend what is right and true, and there's a part of that response.
[time=3036] I think that's healthy. That has to be maintained, though, and always guided by love, but just remember this.
[time=3045] I had a conversation with an individual this past week that reminded me of this.
[time=3050] Just look at the TV screen. Just look at that article, or look at that person sitting across from you, and please don't forget.
[time=3060] Like that woman at the well in John 4.
[time=3064] Personally, down deep inside, they're thirsty. They're broken.
[time=3072] And I don't say that condescendingly. I don't say that in a patronizing. Don't forget.
[time=3078] Something has happened there, right? Something went wrong, and some, all these words come out, and just don't forget to pray for them.
[time=3087] Don't forget to extend kindness where you can. Put your gavel down.
[time=3093] Don't forget, but by the grace of God there goes you.
[time=3098] Be careful how we respond to those individuals. Paul goes on to conclude that those will grieve for not only rejected the word and hindered the gospel or tried to, but in so doing.
[time=3111] And this is where it gets pretty tragic and pretty personal all at the same time.
[time=3117] They bring condemnation upon themselves.
[time=3122] You can see there, verse 16, hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles, so that they may be saved with the result that they always fill up the measure of their sins, but wrath has come upon them to the utmost.
[time=3141] They bring condemnation upon themselves. Leon Morrison, his first Thessalonians commentary in reference to this phrase, always filling up the measure of their sin, says that literally means they always heap up their sins to the limit.
[time=3159] You ever think about that? There is a point at which people reach a limit with their sin, and God brings judgment. Genesis 15, 16 says for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.
[time=3178] You and I see it with our kids sometimes. I'll watch a certain pattern, right? I'll see some things happen. You'll hear some things get said.
[time=3188] A word might be spoken. A flag might go up. A little warning here. I might see it two, three, four times, right?
[time=3195] And there comes a point where it gets filled up and the hammer comes down.
[time=3205] Paul says there are some who will reach a limit with their sin, and God will bring judgment, and they will have by their choices brought condemnation upon themselves.
[time=3218] It's interesting at the end of verse 16, he speaks of judgment or the wrath of God in the past tense. It's in the heiress tense, in the Greek.
[time=3228] I see that, but wrath has come upon them to the utmost. Paul, it's so interesting. Paul is so certain that divine wrath would come that he expresses the concept as if it already had.
[time=3243] Now historically with the Jewish nation it had already happened. He could have been referring to the Babylonian invasion and subsequent exile in 586 BC.
[time=3255] It would, as it related to the Jewish nation, it would happen twenty years after Paul writes this, Jerusalem gets absolutely annihilated by Rome in 70 AD.
[time=3268] It had happened, it would happen, but don't miss this. I believe he primarily here, and this is so important for you and I to hear.
[time=3278] I believe he primarily here refers to the wrath and judgment that will come to all people, to anyone who rejects God.
[time=3289] Those who choose not to embrace the gift of life, those who choose not to embrace the forgiveness of sin made possible only in him.
[time=3302] This passage makes abundantly clear as we come back to our question and we started with this morning. Nobody sends you to hell.
[time=3316] How does somebody get to hell? How does somebody wind up spending eternity separated from God you choose to reject the gift of life?
[time=3326] You, because you've got it all figured out, or you've got this kind of going on over here, or whatever it might be, you reject the forgiveness of sin that comes only in a fully surrendered relationship with him.
[time=3340] And in so doing you choose separation from him. And Paul says there will be a people in time that you and I will celebrate.
[time=3354] And there will be a people in time who you and I will grieve for because of their choice. And God is just and he honors that choice.
[time=3366] Paul puppets in his deal. He gives you the freedom to choose. And our prayer and our hope is that every person in this room would be willing to humble himself or herself.
[time=3381] Now the knee of your heart and choose him, choose life. Don't reject his word. Don't hinder the gospel. Don't bring condemnation on yourself.
[time=3397] But accept it. Endure suffering. Walk in a relationship with him. And if we can help you in any way, shape or form, we will.
[time=3410] And again, this morning as we close and would you just close your eyes and bow your heads?
[time=3420] Can I just read this to you? And we'll go. If your heads bowed and your eyes closed, please listen to the words of the author of Hebrews.
[time=3430] It says in Hebrews 10, 26, some chilling sobering words, "For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins but a terrifying expectation of judgment and the fury of a fire which will consume the adversaries.
[time=3453] Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three. How much severe punishment do you think he will deserve, who has trampled underfoot,
[time=3470] the Son of God, and has regarded as unclean the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified and has insulted the spirit of grace?"
[time=3489] God, we know that you are so very faithful to again and again reveal to us your Word and the work of your Son.
[time=3499] And God, that we would as a people in this room, whoever we are, wherever we've been, wherever we might be on this journey, God, that we would not reject that Word and that work of your Son, but that we would accept it and live.
[time=3516] God, I pray that every seeking heart in this room would confide in a good trusted friend who they know could help them think these things through.
[time=3524] God, if there's no one, would they just come to us and allow us to talk with them and encourage them and help them think these things through?
[time=3533] Choices have to be made. And God, we long for a day where we can celebrate those who have chosen you. In your Son's name we pray. They all agreed and said, "Amen."
