[time=85] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird and welcome again to the Bible Hour.
[time=89] It is a real privilege today to be able to take just a few minutes and introduce you to somebody who's new to the team here at Blackhawk Ministries.
[time=98] It's actually not brand new. Sam Barfel has been on our staff and on our team since this past summer. Sam, Dr. Sam Barfel is the superintendent of Blackhawk Christian Schools and has been just a welcomed addition to what God is doing and to this team that he is building here at Blackhawk. I have, we have benefited already from his presence and I wanted you to just be able to put a name and a face together, but also I wanted you to be able to hear from Sam as it relates to a program that's being offered here on our site that we're really excited about.
[time=132] Blackhawk Ministries and Blackhawk Christian School has been able to partner with Huntington College in the offering of some continuing Ed adult education opportunities. And we felt like there might be many of you out there who would be interested in this and so I've asked Sam if he would come and just share with you about this opportunity that Huntington is bringing here to Northeast Fort Wayne.
[time=156] So Sam, thanks for being here and why don't you just tell the folks about that opportunity.
[time=160] Yeah, thanks Kelly. It's my pleasure to be able to talk about that.
[time=164] But the partnership between Huntington College and Blackhawk Ministries, Blackhawk Christian School is an exciting endeavor. Last fall we were able to start the first site meeting place for the Huntington College Excel program for adults and this is for a professional adults who are seeking a degree either an associate's degree or a bachelor's in business and they can come right here on the campus and earn an entire degree right here on the campus of Blackhawk Ministries, Blackhawk Christian School. Of course the Huntington College professors come here and the classes and all the work and all the books and everything takes place right here on the campus. What we want to announce today is an exciting new development. That is the starting of the second group or the second cluster of people to work through their degree and we have an information meeting scheduled for tomorrow night, Monday night February 9th at 6 p.m. right here in the campus of Blackhawk Ministries and the Huntington College folks will be here to explain the whole Excel program and what it's all about and how earning a degree will be within your reach right here in Fort Wayne at Blackhawk Ministries and then beginning on Monday night March 1st the registration for this new group will take place and then the very following week will be the first week of classes for this the second group of the Huntington College Excel program for adult education. So I invite you to call the number on the screen which is the program office of Huntington College and the Excel program and talk to a lady named Rhonda who will give you all the information that you need concerning this exciting program. So we're just pleased to be able to announce that and thanks for opportunity to talk about today Kelly. Absolutely thanks for sharing with the folks about it and let me just reiterate if I can we love what we get to do here at Blackhawk. We are so very committed to the truth and doing our best to proclaim it and explain it and share it and live it. We are also extremely committed to this community. We're so thankful for you the people that God has put around us and this is just another opportunity we feel like he has given us to do our best to extend to you things that we feel like would help and encourage you. So I hope you'll respond and thanks so much for being with us.

[time=492] Well, there's never any time for Judy. Never time to take a decent nap or go out to dinner with my friends.
[time=500] That's a laugh. What friends? And yes, my lifelong dream job growing up was, of course, to be a homemaker.
[time=508] Right. I just wish I had one week.
[time=512] Even one day where I could just be me.
[time=516] Not wife, not mother, just Judy.
[time=520] But here I am again with a full cart and an empty heart.
[time=524] Pretty poetic, huh?
[time=528] Just like last week. Just like next week. Just like every week for the rest of my life.
[time=534] All right.
[time=538] We're just about ready for you, ma'am.
[time=542] Thank you guys so much. All right. Thank you.
[time=546] Dude, that lady has way more than 15 items. I thought this was an express lady.
[time=550] All right. You have a great day now. Thanks. Bye-bye. Thank you. Bye-bye now.
[time=556] Sir?
[time=560] Hi, sir. How are you today? I'm fine. Thanks. Good.
[time=564] Dude, he is not fine. Paper plastic.
[time=568] Huh? I don't know. Um, plastic, I guess.
[time=574] Really, I don't even know how I am anymore.
[time=580] Well, you see, I've been so busy trying to take care of the kids and make sure they're all right that I really haven't had a chance to think of how I am.
[time=590] Ever since Melissa died, I've been struggling just to make sure the girls are okay.
[time=599] I never realized how much she did for our family.
[time=604] I didn't appreciate her enough either. I would now.
[time=609] How am I?
[time=612] Numb, I guess.
[time=615] How can I else I be? How should I be?
[time=619] How am I supposed to cope with this?
[time=622] How am I to deal with the pain of losing her and how my girls get through it?
[time=628] 32.
[time=631] He never thought this would happen to you, you know?
[time=634] And when it does, you feel like a freight train has just run over your life.
[time=639] How am I? I'm angry. I'm angry that I have to deal with this.
[time=644] I'm angry that things like this happen and especially that they're happening to me.
[time=651] Sir, are you okay?
[time=654] Oh, sorry. Yes, I'm fine. Thanks.
[time=656] All right, well, thank you. Have a great day.
[time=659] Dude, Oprah lost weight. That rocks.
[time=665] Hi, how are you?
[time=667] Oh, I'm great. Thanks for asking. How are you today?
[time=670] Fine, thanks.
[time=671] Now, she is fine.
[time=674] Paper plastic.
[time=676] Plastic, of course.
[time=680] Let's see. Married at 24, first kid at 27, second kid at 30,
[time=686] and a nice white picket fence around my country apple kitchen.
[time=691] That sound about right? Yeah.
[time=694] That's the timeline I was given as a child by my parents to complete.
[time=699] And did I? Masters at 24, Executive Director at 27,
[time=710] 14 hour workdays at 30, lonely at 35.
[time=717] Husbandless, kidless, friendless, lifeless.
[time=727] No, you see, I wasn't going to conform to the idea set out for me as a woman.
[time=733] No, I was going to prove that I was better than that.
[time=737] More successful as a person. And what have I proven?
[time=743] That committing your days to proving a point leaves you secluded
[time=749] while you're all alone watching your award-winning clock tick.
[time=754] Wondering, what was it all for?
[time=758] And if that nice engraved brass clock of status sitting on my mantle
[time=764] is a suitable replacement for love and children.
[time=772] Sure, the money I make is fabulous.
[time=776] Living alone has its perks, and I sure do have a lot of time to myself.
[time=781] But do you have any idea how quickly I would give it all up to be?
[time=787] Food shopping right now for a family who I then could go home and cook for?
[time=795] To have someone to smile at me before I go to bed when I don't have my makeup on.
[time=805] It's okay, though. I still have my nice clock and a wonderful meal to go home to.
[time=812] I'll buy my successful little self.
[time=817] Here you go, ma'am. Thank you so much. You have a super day now.
[time=821] Thanks so much. Oh, she gets a super day, huh?
[time=824] Cool. Hello, miss. Hello, sir. Are you having a good day today?
[time=829] I'm doing fine, I guess. Paper or plastic?
[time=833] Paper, of course, don't you know it's biodegradable?
[time=840] You'd think after all of life experiences and all the wisdom I've gathered over the years
[time=846] that people might want to listen to me sometimes.
[time=850] And now they just cast me aside.
[time=856] Why do people treat the elderly almost the same as they do children?
[time=863] Most of my generations passed on.
[time=870] The younger generations, they don't pay any attention to me.
[time=877] It's as if anything I have to say has no validity. Oh, I see the pain in the young folks.
[time=887] They say they're doing fine, but I know they're hurting inside.
[time=892] But would they listen to me? Would they take any advice I would have to offer?
[time=899] No. So I don't bother them.
[time=904] Yep, I just keep to myself and it makes me feel better to pretend that it's my choice
[time=913] to spend most of my days alone, and I celebrate it.
[time=922] Do you see the truth? I have no other choice.
[time=932] Alright, here you go, sir. You come back again and see me.
[time=935] Thank you, Biz. Thank you. Bye-bye.
[time=938] Hi. Dude, you're nice. Thanks. Paper or plastic?
[time=945] I'm tired of being an island.
[time=951] I'm through with life on my own.
[time=957] I build these walls of protection.
[time=963] Lord, I feel you taking them down so soften my heart, break open my life.
[time=974] Lord, take a torch to my ocean of ice and tear down the walls.
[time=983] Pry open the doors. Jesus hear me saying, I don't want to be an island anymore.
[time=997] So long, it's the road I've been walking.
[time=1010] Lord, I feel your footsteps coming after me.
[time=1016] I don't know why you never stopped trying to break through my defenses and set me free.
[time=1027] So soften my heart, break open my life.
[time=1033] Lord, take a torch to my ocean of ice and tear down the walls.
[time=1042] Pry open the doors. Jesus hear me saying, I don't want to be an island.
[time=1051] So soften my heart, break open my life.
[time=1057] Lord, take a torch to my ocean of ice and tear down the walls.
[time=1065] Pry open the doors. Jesus hear me saying, I don't want to be an island anymore.
[time=1077] Oh, no, no, no, no. And you hear me saying, I don't want to be an island anymore.
[time=1090] That's what I'm saying.
[time=1092] Lord, I know you hear me, I don't want to be an island.
[time=1101] Oh, this is what you've been waiting for.
[time=1111] I don't want to be an island anymore.
[time=1182] Oh, Lord, hear me saying, I don't want to be an island anymore.
[time=1187] Don't want to be an island.
[time=1200] I don't want to be an island anymore.
[time=1224] It's good to see you again.
[time=1226] We're so thankful for the opportunity to have you here.
[time=1229] Special word of welcome to those of you who are visiting.
[time=1232] It is an absolute pleasure for us, and we mean that.
[time=1235] Any chance we get to spend time like this with people new to Black Hawk.
[time=1240] We count it as a real treat, and we're hoping that today that you are feeling welcomed.
[time=1245] And we're so thankful that you're here.
[time=1247] We are so encouraged by what we've been learning from God's Word.
[time=1251] And I want to invite all of you this morning to open up again to 1 Thessalonians chapter 3.
[time=1256] We find ourselves having made our way to the third chapter.
[time=1259] In this book that Paul writes, the church at Thessalonica.
[time=1263] This is a series that we've entitled "changed" because as we continue to make our way through
[time=1270] 1 Thessalonians, verse by verse, we see that God is in the business of changing people.
[time=1277] He is in the business of changing this church here at Thessalonica.
[time=1280] He certainly changed the Apostle Paul.
[time=1283] We learned about that, and he continues to change you and I as we give ourselves to this great truth.
[time=1288] Let me ask you a question this morning, and bear with me on this.
[time=1292] You may not identify readily at first, but I hope I'll get to you as we progress through just a series of thoughts.
[time=1301] Let me ask you this.
[time=1302] What do you do if you're a pastor?
[time=1305] Pastor of a church and somebody in your church is right in the middle of marital disaster.
[time=1314] What do you do?
[time=1316] What do you think? What do you feel?
[time=1318] Somebody in your church is right in the midst of a relational implosion.
[time=1322] There's family crisis.
[time=1324] The carnage is great.
[time=1326] It's bloody.
[time=1328] It's messy.
[time=1329] I mean, there's all kinds of things going on.
[time=1331] How do you respond as a pastor?
[time=1334] What do you do if you're an elder?
[time=1336] Or a deacon?
[time=1338] Or an adult, sunny school, ABF teacher?
[time=1342] And you're in a local fellowship and somebody in that family is contemplating a sinful decision
[time=1348] that will scar and impact the lives of others for years, not to mention dishonor the great name of God.
[time=1355] What do you do?
[time=1356] How do you respond?
[time=1358] What is it that you should feel?
[time=1361] What do you do if you're a small group leader?
[time=1364] Or you help lead a small group.
[time=1366] You're responsible for a mentoring relationship or you're kind of running point on an accountability relationship
[time=1373] or you're a Sunday school teacher.
[time=1377] What do you do if you're one of those and somebody in your care is facing a life-altering career move,
[time=1383] an ongoing battle with addiction, or they've simply grown weary of fighting the good fight.
[time=1389] What do we do?
[time=1392] How do we approach these things?
[time=1396] As Paul's deep love for the Thessalonians spills out here at the beginning of chapter three, we find the answer to these questions.
[time=1405] You see, this is a passage.
[time=1406] This passage we come to this morning that allows us first and foremost to consider the heart of a shepherd.
[time=1415] The heart of a pastor, the heart of one who has been given the unspeakable privilege of caring for
[time=1423] and loving and giving guidance to those that God has put in their care.
[time=1428] And though we will in this discussion this morning and in the weeks that will come, though we will get to the things that he does this morning, I want you to be more focused initially at least
[time=1440] on the posture of the shepherd's heart, the posture of his heart, the attitude that he or she possesses.
[time=1451] And in honor of God's word would you stand with me this morning as we read through our passage, and as we ask God to give us wisdom and insight and guidance as we study it.
[time=1462] First Thessalonians chapter three, I'll read along.
[time=1464] Would you please just follow along prayerfully and thoughtfully.
[time=1469] Therefore, when we could endure it no longer, we thought it best to be left behind in Athens alone.
[time=1474] And we sent Timothy, our brother and God's fellow worker in the Gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you as to your faith so that no one would be disturbed by these afflictions.
[time=1487] For you yourselves know that we have been destined for this.
[time=1491] For indeed, when we were with you, we kept telling you in advance that we were going to suffer affliction,
[time=1497] and so it came to pass as you know.
[time=1500] For this reason when I could endure it no longer, I also sent to find out about your faith,
[time=1506] for fear that the tempter might have tempted you and our labor would be in vain.
[time=1512] But now that Timothy has come to us from you and has brought us good news of your faith and love and that you always think kindly of us longing to see us just as we also long to see you for this reason,
[time=1523] brethren, in all our distress and affliction we were comforted about you through your faith.
[time=1529] For now, we really live if you stand firm in the Lord.
[time=1534] For what thanks can we render to God for you in return for all the joy with which we rejoice
[time=1540] before our God on your account as we, night and day, keep praying most earnestly that we may see your face
[time=1550] and make complete what is lacking in your faith.
[time=1555] Pray with me, would you, Father, God, we come before you this morning of people so in need of your truth.
[time=1563] And, God, we pray that as we make our way through this passage and as you do what you always do,
[time=1570] God, you make truth come alive in our hearts.
[time=1573] God, that you would speak to each and every individual in this room.
[time=1577] God, that we would be convicted where we need to be convicted.
[time=1581] Remind it of truth forgotten wherever that's the case.
[time=1585] God, that those in the room this morning who are discovering for the very first time your truth.
[time=1590] God, that it would be so very clear.
[time=1593] God, that we would be changed because of our time together with you and these ancient words
[time=1600] that are still so ever true.
[time=1602] God, we ask it in your son's name, amen.
[time=1606] You can be seated.
[time=1609] And though I just ask you to sit, I'm going to have you stand here in just a minute because I want to just make sure that we understand
[time=1617] that as I begin to talk with you and share with you from God's word about the heart, the heart of a pastor,
[time=1624] the heart of a shepherd, oftentimes when I just say those words I can oftentimes see in your eyes.
[time=1631] Well, this one may not be, this one may not be for me.
[time=1635] And I just want to having looked at this and having studied this and having become somewhat familiar with, I think what is the essence of this truth that really, that couldn't be further from the truth.
[time=1646] This really is, I believe, for many of us in the room this morning.
[time=1650] Let me ask you this as we think about a shepherd's heart, one who would care for others spiritually.
[time=1656] If you stand this morning, if you're a pastor on staff here at Blackhawk, wherever you might be,
[time=1662] just stand and would you please remain standing if you're a pastor part-time or full-time thank you.
[time=1667] If you're an elder here at Blackhawk or a deacon or an ABF teacher, would you stand right where you're at and just remain standing?
[time=1679] If you lead a small group or you help lead a small group of any kind, if you are discipling somebody,
[time=1686] if you are spiritually mentoring somebody, if you are a Sunday school teacher of any age, would you please stand up?
[time=1694] Sunday school teachers, spiritual mentors, disciples, small group leaders.
[time=1700] If you're on volunteer staff with students, would you please stand up? If you give of your time to help give guidance
[time=1707] and relationship to those in middle school or high school or even college age, would you please stand up?
[time=1715] If you're a mom or a dad, would you please stand up?
[time=1721] There we go.
[time=1724] Now, there are some who are seated and that's okay. Let me say something to you who are seated.
[time=1729] This is not meant to single you out. The rest of you can go ahead and sit down in fact.
[time=1733] Those of you who are seated, you know what? Listen to me. One day you may be.
[time=1737] One day you just very well may be one of those who just stood in whatever capacity.
[time=1745] And those of you who were standing, please understand that the next 30 minutes or so is really about you and I
[time=1752] because you have been given, if you stood, you have been given an unspeakable privilege to provide spiritual care and love and guidance to real people whose lives are so very, very important.
[time=1769] So let us together, please take this very, very seriously.
[time=1774] How do you assess the heart of a shepherd? How do you gauge that?
[time=1779] How does one assess the heart of a shepherd? Let's look at our passage and we'll look in doing so at the heart of the Apostle Paul and we'll consider seven characteristics of a shepherd's heart.
[time=1790] The seven characteristics of a shepherd's heart, a true shepherd, a good shepherd.
[time=1795] Number one, write it down. You'll notice as we read through this passage, his affection.
[time=1800] Write it down. His affection for his people.
[time=1804] Let's look at chapter three, first part of verse one, it says, "Therefore, when we could endure it no longer."
[time=1811] I want you to just look at those words. Paul says, "When we could endure it no longer, we thought it best."
[time=1820] We thought it best to be left behind alone in Athens.
[time=1825] This is the essence people of a shepherd's heart. His affection for his people is such.
[time=1831] He loved them so much that he uses this word endured.
[time=1838] Just take quick note of that. That word endured in the original language.
[time=1842] That word entails an intense emotional physical pain. There was trauma involved.
[time=1849] You ever been there? Have you ever loved somebody so much?
[time=1855] The love that God had given you for them was so deep in your heart.
[time=1859] There was so much affection in you for them that you were here.
[time=1864] And for whatever reason, you know, they're over here.
[time=1868] And it might have been across town. It could have been across the country.
[time=1872] For whatever reason, you're apart. Paul, you know, had established the church here at Thessalonica.
[time=1877] He had grown to love these people. He had developed a relationship with these people.
[time=1881] They were his to care for, guide, and lead. And circumstances were such that Paul has separated from them.
[time=1888] Now he's been away from them for a few months, and his heart aches.
[time=1895] He's got such an affection for them.
[time=1900] You ever felt that? You ever been the recipient of that?
[time=1904] You know how good that feels to be loved that much.
[time=1909] He said, I can't end physically, emotionally. I can't endure it anymore. I love them so much.
[time=1920] My hope is twofold. My hope is that you as part of this family.
[time=1926] And I mean this. I hope that you as part of this family would sense from those who love and guide you.
[time=1932] I would hope that from our elders and our deacons and our pastoral staff, I hope that you sense that we love you that much.
[time=1942] And wherever we're lacking in that, I'm praying that God will fill us up and continue to grow us in that endeavor.
[time=1949] And I'm also hoping this, that you who stood this morning, you stood because you realize that God has given you charge over someone.
[time=1958] And God has given you this privilege of offering spiritual love and guidance and input.
[time=1966] And it will go nowhere. It will stay three inches deep. It will never, ever become what it could be.
[time=1974] Unless you continue to build in your heart an affection, a love for those that he's given you to care for.
[time=1985] His affection for his people. Look back at the passage, if you would, and see secondly his sacrifice for his people.
[time=1994] These two are very related. His sacrifice for his people says they're at the end of verse one.
[time=2002] He said we could endure it no longer. We thought it best to be left behind at Athens alone.
[time=2009] And we sent Timothy our brother and God's fellow worker in the gospel of Christ.
[time=2014] Don't miss that. His affection and love. It runs so deep he's willing to do without.
[time=2022] You see that? He'll pay a price. He'll sacrifice so they can get cared for.
[time=2029] See, if you understand what was going on with Paul and Timothy there, you realize that Paul in the circumstances he had found himself in,
[time=2036] he desperately needed Timothy. Timothy was his companion, his friend.
[time=2042] Timothy was one who helped care for him physically. Paul's not doing well.
[time=2046] Timothy plays this huge role in his life. There was great comfort that came in knowing that Timothy was there.
[time=2054] But you see, Paul looks back at Thessalonica. Paul realizes that these folks are going through it and he loves them so deeply.
[time=2062] He says you know what I'll do without. Timothy, you guys go back and you care for those people and you love those people.
[time=2069] And I'll stay here in Athens alone.
[time=2077] I know a little bit. And many on this team know a little bit about this.
[time=2086] I myself and many of the folks that I work with, we need to continue to learn about and give ourselves to appropriate levels of sacrifice.
[time=2095] But I know a little bit about this. There are times when at nine or ten or eleven o'clock at night, there are times when...
[time=2107] I'll just say when the phone rings. And I know your phone rings and I'm not the only one whose phone rings, but sometimes when my phone rings at ten or eleven or whatever, it's you.
[time=2124] And one of those marital disasters is happening. One of those relational implosions is right there, full screen, full color.
[time=2136] I can hear it.
[time=2140] There's times when on the other end of that phone is that relational chaos, that family situation that's just coming absolutely unwound.
[time=2154] And I can, with that phone to my ear, also turn and look at six other people who've been waiting all day for some pastoral care.
[time=2167] And there are times when, and hear me now, you know, there are times when, and my wife and most of our kids, they understand what God's called us to.
[time=2178] And they know that there will be times when I'll hang up that phone and put on a jacket and throw on some shoes and go.
[time=2188] And they also know that there are times when I won't.
[time=2192] There are times when I'll work diligently on the phone there to construct a plan B that would provide the care needed but also allow for certain things to continue on.
[time=2205] And I know that's a very subjective spot that I and others, even on our team, sometimes find ourselves in.
[time=2212] And we have to be careful how we choose there. We can't go save the world and lose our family.
[time=2219] And we can't just, in this that God has called us to, we can't just care for our family.
[time=2227] While those given to our care, flounders, so that's a very, very difficult thing, but you need to know.
[time=2235] And Paul makes it real clear that part of this calling, part of you and I, shepherding others, is there are times when we will sacrifice.
[time=2244] There are times when we'll do without what we really would have liked to have had.
[time=2249] And that's okay. Paul says that's part of the deal.
[time=2253] How willing are you within appropriate God honoring parameters.
[time=2259] How willing are you to sacrifice for the opportunity to go and care for, invest in and love and walk alongside another.
[time=2272] Paul says to Timothy and the rest of his team go, I'll stay here alone.
[time=2277] Go care for those people.
[time=2281] Thirdly, look at his compassion.
[time=2284] This is a compelling and extremely important point here.
[time=2288] His compassion for his people, a third characteristic of a shepherd's heart.
[time=2294] Chapter three, verse two.
[time=2296] And we sent Timothy our brother and God's fellow worker in the Gospel of Christ to strengthen and encourage you as to your faith so that no one would be disturbed by these afflictions.
[time=2308] For you yourselves know that we have been destined for this.
[time=2312] Verse four says, "For indeed, when we were with you, we kept telling you in advance that we were going to suffer affliction."
[time=2319] Meaning, we told you we would.
[time=2322] Me, Paul and you Thessalonians, it was going to happen.
[time=2327] And so it came to pass, as you know.
[time=2330] These people, he understands now because of what's been reported.
[time=2334] He knows that they're hurting.
[time=2335] He knows that they're facing it.
[time=2337] He knows they are in the midst of it.
[time=2339] And so he acts compassionately.
[time=2342] He responds and he sends Timothy to Steridzo.
[time=2346] Write these down if you want to.
[time=2348] Steridzo and Paracalato them.
[time=2351] He sends Timothy to strengthen and encourage them.
[time=2356] This is what the people needed.
[time=2359] They needed a pastor.
[time=2360] They needed a shepherd.
[time=2361] They needed somebody who was interested in their spiritual and personal lives to come back and Steridzo.
[time=2369] That's where we get our word steroid.
[time=2371] Strengthen them.
[time=2374] And someone to come along and Paracalato encourage them.
[time=2378] Let's look at this idea of strengthening.
[time=2380] You can write it down to strengthen Steridzo.
[time=2383] It means to firm up, to cover, to put a roof overhead, literally.
[time=2389] To come in and to give strength to, to firm up and to cover.
[time=2394] And you know what normal everyday Christ followers like you and I, we need to be strengthened sometimes.
[time=2402] Amen?
[time=2403] There are times when knowing what we know and having been where we've been still.
[time=2407] There are times when we need someone to come alongside and spiritually give us some steroid.
[time=2415] Build us back up, remind us of what's true.
[time=2419] And in reminding us of what's true, bring strength to our soul, perseverance to our spirit.
[time=2430] Good shepherds do this.
[time=2434] They stabilize and strengthen our faith.
[time=2437] And let me just, let me just cut to the chase here and let me just tell you, I won't, I won't, I won't make you guess.
[time=2445] I'll tell you how it is, a shepherd, Steridzo's strengthens those given to his or her care.
[time=2453] Just please don't miss this, they do it with this.
[time=2457] And please, I know that, and I'm not being, I'm not being facetious here.
[time=2462] I know that a smile helps and I know that, and I'm always going to tell you it's got to be in the context of relationship.
[time=2468] That's true.
[time=2470] All those things are true.
[time=2471] But the meat of it folks, I mean the gist of it is that if you are going to Steridzo, strengthen those in your care, you have got to do it in a practical and relevant way with this, the word of truth.
[time=2486] And if it's an eight-year-old, think it through and help them understand how these words of truth can make a difference in their life.
[time=2494] If it's a 16-year-old, try harder.
[time=2497] If it's a 25-year-old, keep that.
[time=2499] I mean whoever it is that we've been given care for, our strengthening ministry has got to be tied to this because this is where the answers to life are found.
[time=2512] This is where God's design for your life and mind is discovered.
[time=2518] And Paul said, "Timothy, get back there, and Steridzo, strengthen them."
[time=2524] And we know Timothy did, and Timothy was one who strengthened by the ministry of the word.
[time=2532] To encourage though, as well, these two come hand in hand, don't miss this, write this down.
[time=2537] Timothy goes back and he's Steridzo's and he paracalato.
[time=2542] He encourages them.
[time=2544] That word means to come alongside.
[time=2546] It means to motivate.
[time=2548] It means to inspire.
[time=2550] It is a relational term.
[time=2553] Encouragement here.
[time=2554] Strengthen and encourage.
[time=2557] Strengthen, build into them the truth and come alongside.
[time=2562] Don't miss that phrase right there.
[time=2564] I realize that there are times in the spiritual journey.
[time=2569] I realize there are times when you and I need to kind of so gently yet so forcefully come behind someone and say,
[time=2577] "Come on, get going." There's times where we need to lovingly come behind and prod.
[time=2586] There are times in the spiritual journey where sometimes we stand out in front and we kind of look back,
[time=2593] not in a condescending way.
[time=2595] But there are times when you and I are called to stand out in front and say to those who would follow, "Come this way and come now."
[time=2606] In this context, as these people are facing trial, Paul says to Timothy, "Go back and Steridzo them."
[time=2614] Strengthen them with this and encourage them.
[time=2618] If you wrote that definition down, please just underline, "Come alongside."
[time=2624] I just want you to kind of just picture somebody just doing this.
[time=2632] Just picture somebody just doing this.
[time=2636] How are you doing?
[time=2638] Just right there.
[time=2640] It's not boom and it's not reaching back and going, "Oh, come on." There are times when you and I, as shepherds, just have to be willing to just kind of come right up alongside right there.
[time=2651] It's not going so good, is it?
[time=2654] It's pretty hard.
[time=2656] Hard walk in these days, huh?
[time=2658] Well, I'm right here.
[time=2661] Let's think this through.
[time=2663] Let's take this, right, and then I'll just stay right here and I'll roll up these babies and we'll just walk.
[time=2673] But I'll stay right by your side.
[time=2678] Encouragement.
[time=2679] Para kalau.
[time=2683] I'll tell you what I could tell you story after story of times in my life.
[time=2688] Very personal, very painful, very difficult times when God used people to come alongside and paracalau me.
[time=2698] One, not so personal, but very, very meaningful, would be a time about, oh, maybe seven years ago or so.
[time=2708] I think I had been here in Fort Wayne for about a year, had been in ministry at that time for maybe about eight years or so already,
[time=2717] pastoring, and I had never, that's my surprise to some of you, but I had never done a funeral.
[time=2725] I had been in churches, I had served in certain positions and had been given a great deal of responsibility in several of them, and I had never done a funeral.
[time=2736] And I got to tell you a part of that, some of you know me, and I just have, and I don't know how you may think a pastor should have a better handle on this.
[time=2747] I got a hard time with death, and I'm working on that.
[time=2751] God's growing me in that arena. You know, some things happened, and I've always just struggled with dying.
[time=2760] But he's working on me, and he's growing me, and there were times in those first several years of ministry where literally I would like manipulate my way out of funerals,
[time=2771] because I just didn't want to do it.
[time=2774] But I got here, and I'm about a year or so into the stent here, and it just so happens that I've got to do one.
[time=2780] I think I might have called Bud to see if he wanted to do it.
[time=2783] I mean, I was looking for somebody, I was calling anybody, nobody could do the, nobody could, it was just going to be me.
[time=2789] I could tell it was God saying to me, it's time to do a funeral.
[time=2794] And that might not seem ominous to some of you, it scared me to death.
[time=2799] And there was a guy who worked here with us at that time, a wonderful, wonderful man named Gene Cheryl.
[time=2806] Gene still is a wonderful man, and a good friend.
[time=2809] And Gene was one of the sweetest, most encouraging, para-colle-owing guys I've ever met in my life.
[time=2815] And Gene, Gene could do a funeral.
[time=2817] Gene was a gifted man with a huge shepherd's heart, and I called him into my office.
[time=2822] It was literally that morning.
[time=2824] You know how when you don't want to do something, you just put it off?
[time=2826] Well, I knew this thing was coming, but I just, it was time almost to go to McCombensons.
[time=2832] And I called Gene, and I just spilled the whole thing there, and I told him.
[time=2837] And he said, "Hey." He said, "Hey, it's all right." He said, "We'll get this thing figured out.
[time=2846] Let me just tell you a few things." So he just told me a few things.
[time=2849] I got a decent mind, and I was kind of taking it in, and he just scribbled a few things out for me.
[time=2854] He drew a picture of the room where we were going, which he knew very well.
[time=2859] Explain to me how this thing needed to kind of unfold, and when I would go...
[time=2864] And I got most of it, but I didn't get all of it, and he could tell I didn't get all of it.
[time=2868] And he said, "You know what?
[time=2869] I'll go with you." I said, "Well, you got..." He said, "I'll cancel." So the guy cancels half his day.
[time=2876] He hops in my car and he drives to McCombensons.
[time=2878] And I still didn't understand how this was going to work, and then it dawned on me what he was going to do.
[time=2884] He talked me through that initial entry of getting down to the front, and greeting the family, and pausing at the casket.
[time=2893] And past then, I had forgotten everything he had told me.
[time=2897] And as I do that, as I will never forget it as long as I live.
[time=2902] And I'm not meaning to be disrespectful to that service.
[time=2905] So this is not meant to be funny.
[time=2907] It's just kind of cool how it worked out.
[time=2909] I go down, and I pause, and I go over, and I greet the family, and I walk back to the middle, and it's time for me to speak.
[time=2917] And I look up, and there's Gene.
[time=2920] He's in the back, very far back wall.
[time=2923] Everybody's in front of him, so nobody can see me.
[time=2926] And he starts to orchestrate the entire deal.
[time=2929] He's back, and he goes...
[time=2933] So I start to talk.
[time=2935] And I could do that, right?
[time=2937] I start to talk, and I start to share from my heart, and I kind of get to the talk, and all the way to the talk, he's going like this.
[time=2946] And he stands there, and then I get down with my talk, and I start to get nervous, and he goes...
[time=2951] And he does this right here.
[time=2955] So I go, "Oh, that's right." I'm supposed to say, "So he walks me back over." And then I kind of get done shaking hands, and I'm doing...
[time=2961] I'm like, "Help me, Gene." And he's like, "I'm back over here." Right here, and I talk again.
[time=2968] And he just guided me.
[time=2971] He just came right up, alongside me.
[time=2975] And he just put his arm around me.
[time=2977] And he says, "You know what? It's okay.
[time=2979] We'll just do this. We'll just do this together." Is in essence what he did.
[time=2984] And there are so many people in your care.
[time=2989] Eight-year-olds, those that are yours, and those that aren't students, small group members, folks in your class, people in this room.
[time=3000] And they are dying for somebody to walk up alongside them and say, "You know what?
[time=3007] It's a little confusing, isn't it? Let's just do it together." Paul says to Timothy, "Go and strengthen them. Strengthen them with the truth, and encourage them with your heart."
[time=3022] And I hope, and I pray to God, that he would continue to give us as pastors and leaders strength to have that kind of ministry and that kind of touch with you.
[time=3034] So that they will, and this is where it gets really interesting, so that they will not be disturbed.
[time=3040] Look back at the text.
[time=3042] Paul understands what's going on back here in Thessalonica.
[time=3045] He realizes the temptations that are coming.
[time=3048] He understands the crisis that they're facing.
[time=3051] So he sends Timothy and the crew back to Storizo and Pericalo to strengthen and encourage them
[time=3060] to strengthen and encourage you as to your faith what they believe so that no one would be disturbed by these afflictions.
[time=3071] Now this is really, really fascinating.
[time=3074] I was reminded of this again this week, a good friend of mine who helps me think these things through.
[time=3080] Came across it and shared it with me and I did some more digging on it myself.
[time=3085] It is a fascinating, fascinating truth. People don't miss this.
[time=3090] God desires that you would be strengthened and that you would be encouraged.
[time=3096] And he wants you to be strengthened with the truth and he wants folks to come alongside and encourage you with their heart because he doesn't want you disturbed.
[time=3105] The word in the Greek is, it's a verb, Sano, S-A-I-N-O.
[time=3110] Sano is the Greek verb and it means literally a dog wagging its tail.
[time=3118] A dog wagging its tail.
[time=3123] You're looking at me like I looked at the book when I first read it, but watch this.
[time=3127] Watch this. A dog, literally it means and paints the picture of a dog wagging its tail in the midst of that dog being fascinated, flattered or enticed.
[time=3142] And I don't know how many of you have dogs or have ever had a dog, but I got to think as soon as I start to paint this picture, you're going to go, oh, oh, I get it.
[time=3151] See, we got a dog. Her name is Izzy and Izzy is this wonderfully bright, incredibly strong German shepherd.
[time=3160] She is the murderer of skunks and ground squirrels.
[time=3164] She is a rabid, vicious animal who at the same time will lay on the floor in the living room while young children bounce on her like a pillow and she'll do nothing.
[time=3175] She is fabulous. She's very smart, very bright.
[time=3181] But I'll tell you what, when the bird family is hopping in the wagon and we're getting ready to leave and Izzy's got to stay, which she hates to stay, you know that about dogs, they want in.
[time=3192] But if it's a situation where she can't come in, she's going to stay, I'll put her over in the kennel, the big cage there, the cold, dark cage in the garage.
[time=3203] And she doesn't want to go into the cage in the garage, but I'll tell you what, if I go in the house and I come out with human food, anything human, it doesn't matter what it is, it could be like a dry piece of toast, she wouldn't care.
[time=3215] She just kind of knows what's our food and what's our food, and if you've got a piece of human food, now watch this.
[time=3222] And she's over at the far corner of the garage going, nope, not going in.
[time=3226] I'm going with you guys, and you go there to that kennel, right? And I open that door and I hold out that piece of human food.
[time=3234] You ever seen it? They kind of start to come, right? They start to come and the head kind of, aw, it sucks, you know, the head comes down, the head comes down, and that tail starts to wag.
[time=3248] Wag, aw, the tail, I shouldn't do that, sorry. The tail starts to wag. You've seen it, haven't you?
[time=3258] Tell me you've seen it, say yes. All right, because I'm feeling really stupid if you haven't.
[time=3265] You've seen it. And come on, now, think with me. That dog is about to go in the cage.
[time=3274] But she sees that food and she starts coming to me like, I'm her best friend, like, aw, you shouldn't have.
[time=3280] And that tail's wagging, and she takes it and walks in and then, boom.
[time=3287] There are people in this room right now, this morning.
[time=3298] And your tail is wagging. And you think, I mean, when you're basically convinced that that piece of human food is somehow going to give you life, that somehow it's going to taste good.
[time=3323] And that brief experience of it tasting good will somehow get you through the fact that that door is going to shut.
[time=3335] And Paul loved them so much, he says, Timothy, go back and strengthen them with this, which is what we try to do and what I hope you're trying to do with those you get to care for.
[time=3346] Paul says, strengthen them with this, and encourage them from your heart, paracaleto them, because I don't, he says, I don't want them disturbed.
[time=3356] I don't want them wagging their tails as they walk foolishly into bondage and destruction and to all that sin brings.
[time=3369] And I wish I could just, wish I could get with every one of you and just look you right in the eye and just beg you, just beg you to stop walking across that garage to stop wagging your tail.
[time=3386] It's a trick. It's not going to work. There's nothing there but a cold cage.
[time=3404] He loves them so much. His affection for his people is great. His sacrifice is personal, painful, and his compassion speaks right to the issue.
[time=3418] Can I just invite you to bow your heads, right where you're at? Please don't leave. Please allow God the opportunity as you respond to his truth in worship.
[time=3435] Give him the opportunity to continue to speak to your heart this morning. So many of us in the room have the privilege of caring for and coming alongside others.
[time=3447] And God, we pray that you would take this word that we've seen this morning.
[time=3454] These words that are so very true still, and God that you would change us, that you would grow us, for some we need to be better shepherds.
[time=3464] For others of us, God in the room this morning, we need to stop wagging our tail. We need to wise up to the trap of sin and its destructive nature.
[time=3476] And God, we pray that your Spirit, that the Spirit of God and the Word of God and the people of God would all working together.
[time=3487] That lives would be touched, that hearts would be opened, God that you would do your miraculous work.
[time=3494] Thank you, God, for loving us as much as you do, and for giving us times like this to be reminded of what is life-changing.
[time=3506] And if there's anybody here this morning, and you know you need help, you know you need some new direction, you know that your sin has separated you from God.
[time=3520] Then we pray this morning for you, and that you would speak to a trusted friend, that you would come and allow us the opportunity to dialogue with you.
[time=3529] That you wouldn't leave today or let the sun go down without having that spiritual conversation that you know you need to have.
[time=3538] God, thank you so very much for this time. In your son's name we pray. Amen.
[time=3568] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
