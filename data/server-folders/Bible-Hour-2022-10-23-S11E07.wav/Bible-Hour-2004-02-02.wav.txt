[time=439] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries and as always it's a privilege to get to be with you again we're so thankful that you've tuned in.
[time=448] We found out recently that the viewing audience of the Bible Hour is somewhere between 15 and 20,000 people each and every week and what an amazing thought that is for us to realize we get the privilege of bringing life-changing, eternity-altering truth to that many people week after week.
[time=470] We're really grateful for what this broadcast allows us to do.
[time=474] I met a guy a couple weeks ago here at Church.
[time=476] He had for several years just not come to Church.
[time=480] He had had a real difficult and painful experience in life and with a Church that he used to attend and had just been real confusing for him so he had just kind of chosen to sit it out.
[time=492] Well, on a Sunday morning, about a year and a half ago he came across the broadcast and God really spoke to his troubled heart and as he would get up Sunday after Sunday week after week, month after month, he just began to sense a new spirit in him, a new willingness to try it again that he came and he's been coming and we're so thankful to have him with this.
[time=516] I met a mother, a single mom with three kids who travels about 20, 30 miles every Sunday morning to come and be with us. She's been with us here for about three years now and she told me just last week that at the depth at the absolute bottom of her struggle in the midst of a period of time in her life where things were so very dark and confusing. She, on a Sunday morning, not being able to sleep, got up, turned on the TV and there we were.
[time=548] I know and we know here that what God does through us speaks to a lot of people and we're so thankful for those of you who are in the viewing audience.
[time=556] Many of you have home churches, we realize that and you know that we're thankful for that. A lot of you out there don't. We're it for you in some way and so I'm going to ask if you would in the weeks to come and we'll keep talking about this. On our website at blackhawkministries.org. On our website if you go there to our home page and if you and if you click on the Bible Hour link when you come to the Bible Hour page there'll be a box where it says Take Bible Hour Survey. We would love it if you would in the next hour or so, in the next day or so, even in this coming week, if you would please, if you're a Bible Hour viewer we would love to learn more about this family of ours. We'd love to learn more about you and so if you would go to the blackhawkministries.org site, click on Bible Hour and then go to this little box that says Take Bible Hour Survey. We would love to get to know you better. We'd love to know more about your life, we'd love to know more about your needs, we'd love to know more about your ways that we could help you, encourage you further.
[time=628] We realize the broadcast is something that you enjoy but God has been so good to us and there are so many resources here that we could make available to you and we would love to get to know you better. And so if you would do that it would mean a lot to us. Please visit the site, take the survey, it's a real easy survey to kind of just click your way through and we'll be so grateful. Thank you for being a part of this family some Sunday morning. Why don't you just come visit us. It's encouraging, I know, to see the broadcast. There's nothing like being here live and in person. We would love to get to put a name or the face.
[time=664] We'd love to have you here 9 o'clock and 10.45 on Sunday mornings. We hope to see you soon. I've been meditating on that word recently. In the heart even though it's a physical part of who we are there's a spiritual heart that the Bible talks about. It's a lot different. It's one of those things that you have to have faith to believe in again. And you say what is a heart?
[time=692] It's kind of hard to describe because it's not what sits inside a rib cage but it's kind of all of who we are and includes our mind and our will. So I was looking up this week some different passages that describe the heart and the Bible and looking at some different commentaries and this is what I came up with. Just listen to this list of different adjectives that describe the heart and let's see if we can put our minds around something that's intangible and really try to understand what it might be. It says that the heart is our desires. The heart is our affections and perceptions.
[time=736] It includes our thoughts and understanding.
[time=740] It's our reasoning. I like this one it says the heart is our imagination and the heart is our conscience, our intentions, our purpose, our will and even our attitudes make up the heart.
[time=756] The Bible says the heart melt.
[time=760] A heart can wail and doubt.
[time=764] A heart burns.
[time=768] A heart can instruct and meditate and trust.
[time=772] A heart leaps. It rejoices.
[time=776] It groans and it pounds. A heart grows faint and cries out. A heart yearns and thinks.
[time=788] The heart is a tablet.
[time=792] And a heart can hate.
[time=796] A heart can believe or it can doubt.
[time=800] A heart can have desire or it can ache.
[time=804] A heart can be veiled or unveiled.
[time=808] It can be responsive or unresponsive. A heart can be faithful or unfaithful.
[time=816] Left to our own, our heart is a lot of trouble.
[time=824] But when we give our heart, when we surrender our heart to this God who has created everything we see, we put it in his hands and he's trustworthy and I want to sing a song about that and if that's what you're feeling this morning and it's I am, that you just want to give all of that to him.
[time=840] Say, "God, I don't want my affections to be left to me.
[time=844] I want to give them to you. God, I don't want to be left with my own, because I know I'll screw them up." And I want to give my heart to you and sing this song and while we sing it, if you feel like it, maybe just as a symbol of what your heart is to put your hands on your physical heart and have that represent what we're singing about here.
[time=878] I want to give you my song and live for you alone every breath that I take every moment and way Lord, have your way Lord, I give you my heart and give you my soul I live for you alone every breath that I take
[time=916] every moment and way Lord, have your way in me
[time=936] [MUSIC] First it is my desire
[time=956] [MUSIC]
[time=975] All I have within me
[time=981] I give you praise
[time=987] All that I adore is in you
[time=997] [MUSIC]
[time=1076] [MUSIC]
[time=1124] Well, it's great to welcome you back to our study on First Thessalonians.
[time=1129] We find ourself at chapter three, and this morning we will continue in a message that we started last week entitled, "The Heart of a Shepherd." The heart of a shepherd.
[time=1139] The idea was that Paul here, as he kind of unfolds his great love for these people at Thessalonica.
[time=1146] He has had to leave Thessalonica, and he's been away from them for a while, but now his heart aches for them.
[time=1153] He knows that they are facing persecution and trial, and so being the shepherd that he is, his heart just begins to ache, and as he begins to kind of pour out his love for them and his writing here, we see seven characteristics.
[time=1168] The seven characteristics of a shepherd.
[time=1173] And as we said last week, don't feel like you've been left out necessarily, because if you're a Sunday school teacher, you've been given the opportunity to shepherd and care for those God has given you.
[time=1186] If you're a small group leader, if you head up an accountability group, if you're an elder or a deacon or an ABF teacher, if you're a discipler or a mentor, if you're a mom or a dad, God has given you the opportunity to be a shepherd.
[time=1204] And what we see here are seven characteristics of a shepherd's heart.
[time=1209] We started last week, and I'll just kind of run back through these real quickly.
[time=1213] We got through three of them, and what we saw, first of all, as the passage unfolds is his affection, his affection for his people.
[time=1223] A true shepherd has a great deal of affection for his people.
[time=1228] First Thessalonians 3-1, therefore, when we could endure it no longer, it was important for us to look at that word endure.
[time=1236] That word carries with it the fact that there was a physical challenge.
[time=1240] There was a physical discomfort.
[time=1243] He was having to endure being away from them.
[time=1247] He loved them so deeply.
[time=1249] He cared for them so much.
[time=1252] And you and I, as we have opportunities to lead and to love, to shepherd and guide, we see in this that we too must have hearts that are growing in our affection for those that God has given us.
[time=1266] We see this shepherd had an affection for his people, also secondly, and you can write this down if you're catching up today.
[time=1273] Secondly, we saw that there was great sacrifice.
[time=1275] We saw his sacrifice for his people.
[time=1278] This is what shepherds do.
[time=1280] They sacrifice at times in their attempt to love and to come alongside those they care for so much.
[time=1287] Therefore, when we could endure it no longer, we thought it best to be left behind at Athens alone.
[time=1293] And we sent Timothy, our brother, and God's fellow worker in the Gospel of Christ.
[time=1298] You see, Timothy, in his relationship with Paul, he played a role there with Paul.
[time=1303] Paul needed Timothy.
[time=1304] Timothy was his friend.
[time=1306] Timothy encouraged him.
[time=1307] Timothy walked along his side in ministry, but Paul's heart ached for the people back in Thessalonica.
[time=1315] He knew they had experienced persecution.
[time=1317] He just had to know how they were doing.
[time=1321] And so he lets go of something that was dear to him, Timothy, so Timothy can go and strengthen and encourage.
[time=1329] And Paul says, "You know what, it's okay.
[time=1331] I'll just stay here alone." And many times for you and I, that's the way it is.
[time=1336] Not all the time, but many times in our attempt to lead and love, to guide, to shepherd, we sacrifice.
[time=1344] We do without something in the effort to come alongside and love the way God's called us to.
[time=1351] Then we see his compassion.
[time=1354] Thirdly, you can write it down.
[time=1356] The heart of a shepherd is marked by his compassion for his people.
[time=1360] I already kind of said it just a few minutes ago.
[time=1363] Timothy was sent, look at verse two, to strengthen and encourage you as to your faith so that no one would be disturbed by these afflictions.
[time=1374] Paul says, "He shows great compassion for them and that as he finds himself here realizing the situation that they're in, he sends them the two things that any good shepherd knows, any good sheep needs in the midst of life.
[time=1393] They needed to be strengthened and encouraged.
[time=1397] Steridzo and Paracolero, we talked about it last week.
[time=1401] They needed to be strengthened with the Word of God and they needed to be loved.
[time=1407] They needed someone to Paracolero them, the arm around the shoulder coming alongside.
[time=1412] They strengthened with the Word.
[time=1413] They Paracolero encouraged with the heart.
[time=1416] I'm here for you.
[time=1418] I'm going to do my best as a shepherd to tell you what God's Word says and I will do my best as a shepherd to walk down that road with you so that you won't be disturbed.
[time=1426] Remember, say no.
[time=1429] The wagging of a dog's tail.
[time=1431] We talked about that last week.
[time=1433] I actually showed you that.
[time=1435] My wife watched the broadcast this morning and I'm never allowed to wag my tail again in public.
[time=1442] But that was the idea.
[time=1444] That's what a dog does.
[time=1445] A dog, when you offer him something, drops the head, starts walking towards you, wagging the tail because he thinks it's good.
[time=1455] And we talked about last week how oftentimes it's not good because the enemy brings things in your and I's line of sight and we start wagging our tails and we start walking that way and Paul's going, no, no, no.
[time=1467] I don't want them to do that, Timothy.
[time=1469] Go quick.
[time=1470] Strengthen them.
[time=1471] Encourage them so they won't be disturbed.
[time=1473] Say no.
[time=1474] The wagging of a dog's tail.
[time=1475] No, don't let that happen.
[time=1477] He says.
[time=1478] And that's what good shepherds do.
[time=1480] Well, let's read where we're going this morning.
[time=1482] In honor of God's Word, would you stand with me?
[time=1484] And we will read verses 5 through 10.
[time=1487] 1 Thessalonians chapter 3 verses 5 through 10.
[time=1491] And he continues on in our picture of a shepherd continues to develop.
[time=1495] Verse 5, "For this reason when I could endure it no longer, I also sent to find out about your faith for fear that the tempter might have tempted you and our labor would be in vain.
[time=1507] But now that Timothy has come to us from you and has brought us good news of your faith and love and that you always think kindly of us longing to see us just as we also long to see you for this reason, brethren, in all our distress and affliction, we were comforted about you through your faith.
[time=1526] For now we, I love this, for now we really live.
[time=1531] If you stand firm in the Lord, for what thanks can we render to God for you in return for all the joy with which we rejoiced before our God on your account as we night and day keep praying most earnestly that we may see your face and may complete what is lacking in your faith.
[time=1552] Oh God, please, as we give ourselves this morning to this passage and its great truth, God, I pray that every person in this room who has the opportunity to care for, every person in this room who has the privilege of loving and leading others, whether it's just a few or whether it's many, God, I pray that the principles that we see here would come alive in our hearts, that we would open our hearts in our minds to what you would have for us, God, that we could live out this truth and in so doing better love and care for those in ways whereby you would be honored, glorified, and lifted up in your son's name we pray. Amen.
[time=1595] Well, let's continue on. What do you say? And let me, as we do, let me illustrate our fourth point, the fourth characteristic of a shepherd's heart, his protectiveness toward his people, his protectiveness toward his people. I've told this story before, it's been a few years and I promise I'll only tell it once every three or four years but it's just so highlights the point. It was the fall of 1995 and my wife and I were visiting Fort Wayne trying to see if in fact this would be a place that we would want to spend the rest of our lives and my good friend, many of you know this, my very, very good friend for 20-some years, Russell Moore was the senior pastor at Blackhawk at the time.
[time=1639] We had been in ministry together for years back in California and so we were out visiting.
[time=1643] We took a break in our week to go see a movie, I think it was early fall '95 and we came out of the movie and it was raining, it had been raining and remember him telling me you know it never rains in the fall, I don't know what the deal is here with the rain and we got into the car and we start to pull out a cold water over there cold water regal sentiments and we're talking and he's a bit distracted and he pulls out in front of this guy, I mean just flat out not even close his fault not the guy's fault and the guy just popped the gasket and I actually look back and it was two guys in a pickup and as soon as it happened you know fate would have it that the light you know it always happens doesn't it, you mess up and then the light turns red and then you guys sit there and kind of deal with this person who's a bit irritated but this guy was a bit more than a bit irritated, he's honking his horn he's laying on his horn and he won't stop, he moves up right to our bumper and he lays on his horn and he will not stop blowing his horn and then we kind of look back and he's flipping us off out the window, just both of them, flipping us off, they're yelling you can tell, you can't hear them because they're like in their car but they're like yelling and they're angry and they're making these gestures and I'm laughing, I'm kind of scooch down in the back seat so all they see is my head right and Russ, he's kind of laughing I think the gals are like trying to get under the seat and we start to go on down St. Joe's Center, all the way down St. Joe's Center we're going back toward Hacienda where Russ and Heidi lived these guys won't, they won't stop, they keep yelling and screaming they pull up alongside this side, this guy hangs out the window flips us off, yells the most unbelievable obscenities you've ever heard I mean we just pulled out, right, it wasn't like we, but they just, they went over the edge and so then they'd stop and come behind and honk honk honk honk and they'd come over on this side and they'd pull over, they wouldn't just get up on side they'd pull over right next to the car and that guy would lean out his window and he would just absolutely just some of the most amazing stuff spewing out of his mouth and he's shaking his fist and they're both shaking their fist back seat and Russ is driving and we're just, we're kind of laughing and we turn on to Laymeyer and we come down by the anchor room and at the anchor room we stop the lights red, they start to get out of their car and I'm thinking okay no way what is going on here and then the light turns green and we take off and they get back in their car and as soon as we made that left hand turn onto Stelhorn it just clicked, it was like an it clicked with Russ and it clicked with me both at the same time that we're getting awfully close now to our home where our children are and then all of a sudden what had been kind of like weird and uncomfortable got really really really serious it just something happened, something just kind of came over me and him too and we pulled over right in front of the brick, big brick house with the indoor pool up on Stelhorn, circular drive I'll never forget as long as I live, we pull over and our wives are going okay guys what are and we're like hey just don't worry about it we're like all of a sudden feeling very star ski and hutchish and I know we got law enforcement guys in here so if I broke the law and doing this just reprimand me later but it just happened he just stopped the car, he didn't say anything to me, I didn't say anything to him and these guys pulled up right behind us and we both just, he said you're ready, I said yes and I just threw my door open and he threw his door open and we just ran back at this truck, he went to the driver's side and the window was down and before that kid knew it, Russ's whole torso is in the front cab of that truck with his hands clenched tightly around that kid's shirt collar and I don't know exactly what he was saying, I wouldn't want to quote him but I know his finger was on the kid's nose I just thought I would jump on the hood of the truck and I felt so cool and I just climbed up on this truck and I jumped on the hood of the truck and I get down on my knees and I'm looking right in the window at the passenger right and I'm just, I'm pounding my fist on the window and I'm telling him to knock it off that's all I was saying was just knock it off but I'm pounding my hand on the window and this poor kid, he slithers down in his seat and I'll remember this he just looks up and he hits the guy and he goes oh my gosh he's huge [laughter] and I'm like you better believe it, I'm your worst nightmare I'm pounding that window and Russ is shaking this kid did I go over the line now?
[time=1927] No I'm okay, all right good I got a policeman back there and I tell you Russ lets this kid go and I jump off that truck you've never seen a car get thrown into reverse so fast and they pull back into that driveway and they're just gone and Russ and I were walking back to the car and we're thinking we're going to get huge props from our wives, right?
[time=1951] They're like sitting in the car, oh get in would you just go oh my goodness oh my goodness what are you guys thinking?
[time=1959] We got in the car and we drove away that's what a shepherd does wait you didn't let me finish the sentence when you're going to mess with one of his kids when somebody he loves deeply when he feels as if they might be threatened when he feels as if something bad might happen he jumps on a hood he does she does whatever it takes and see Paul he's over here in Corinth now and he realizes that the enemy is very possibly about to be at work he knows persecutions taking place back in Thessalonica and Paul knows how the enemy works look at 2 Corinthians 11 let me just show this to you look at 2 Corinthians 11 3 I think it's going to be on the screen you can turn there if you'd like look at 2 Corinthians 11 3 in another letter to the church at Corinth Paul expresses this very same heart he shows us this very same attitude the shepherd in him is coming out he says but I am afraid you see it here but I am afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness your minds will be led astray from the simplicity and purity of devotion to Christ but I am afraid Paul says that as the serpent deceived Eve he might deceived you as well I wrote this down this week you can write it down if you'd like in the midst of difficulty in the midst this is true for you this is true for me this is true wherever I go in the midst of difficulty evil's deception leads to destruction in the midst of whatever difficulty you might be facing in the midst of whatever it is you might be encountering if it's tough if it's painful if it's confusing in the midst of difficulty evil's deception leads to destruction and as you're shepherd this morning I want to say this to you there's a lot of people in the room this morning and in a room this size you just know that there are some things that are transpiring and I want to just talk you through this ever so carefully in this room this morning for instance there are some marriages that aren't doing so well there are some marriages in this room this morning and you are absolutely on the verge of catastrophe you haven't communicated honestly or in a healthy fashion in years there's no intimacy you can cut the tension with a knife
[time=2133] in some cases this has been going on for years and hopelessness has set in and the destructive nature and the cycle of it all just has absolutely taken the two of you to opposite ends of the room you may be here this morning with a smile you may have come in the front doors and greeted and said hello but you know down deep in your heart that it's not good here's the deal watch how this works it's just what we just talked about see in the midst of that see I've got to say something this morning to you because in the midst of that evil wants to come right in there the enemy wants to come right into that situation and begin to whisper in your ear whoever you are forget about it go to the website click on the internet I mean and if it's not going to be the pornographic route well then just go the chat room route but see he begins to whisper in your ear forget about honoring God look where that's gotten you go and have that conversation even with that real life person not just the internet go linger there too long go talk to him go talk to her begin to change the way you dress look for affection elsewhere he whispers see in the midst of difficulty evil's deception always leads to destruction and Paul knew it and the shepherd in him comes out that protective nature steps up and he says oh oh oh oh oh stop stop stop we can't let that happen some of you students in the room today middle school students high school students you know what some of you are living in that home that I just described some of you hear it every morning and watch it every night as your mom and dad absolutely tear each other apart and it's killing you and you are so confused by it and you are so upset by it and on top of that then you go to school and somehow at school you know it's not going well either at school somehow you always seem to be on the outside looking in friends or or peers for whatever reason you know they don't accept you or they think or they look down on you they don't treat you kindly and so you feel alone at home while a mom and dad battle it out you feel alone at school while nobody really reaches out to you your grades are going down the toilet and as a 12 year old or a 14 year old there's that voice that comes in and says you know what just forget it who needs it go do whatever you've got to do to get accepted go do whatever you've got to do to make a friend go do something 16 year old to feel better about yourself and whatever it's going to be forget about honoring God look where that's gotten you in a good shepherds see a good shepherd knows that a good shepherd sees that and a good shepherds his whole whole whole time out wait wait wait wait wait no not a chance he kind of comes out there and you know and he kind of does this thing not going to happen no so you're not going to get him you're not going to get her and that good shepherd comes along and stir it's us strengthens with the truth and that good shepherd comes along and puts an arm literally along side and says we'll walk through it together because I don't want you wagging your tail and walking into that cage there are people in this room today you are on the verge of financial ruin it has absolutely gone south for you you are so in debt you can't even see straight and it's all about collapse I mean there's people in this room and the severity of the financial stress that you face today it's almost unthinkable and you feel so alone and you feel so humiliated and that voice comes along and says hey just do just do whatever you got to do steal it get it illegally and bezel it I mean do something and don't talk to me about honoring God that voice says because look we're honoring God has gotten you and so all of a sudden choices start to be contemplated and see we need good shepherds who are in relationship with their sheep who understand the realities of their lives who can come alongside and say you know what no no no no no first of all that's not true he is good and let me remind you of that and secondly you know what I'll just I'll just put my arm around you and we'll figure this thing out together and if you're here this morning and if any of those scenarios are remotely true of you and you're alone and you need some help you need some steroidzoeing and you need some para cola owing some some strengthening and some encouraging let us know we're doing our best to be close to you and in that effort we can see certain things but we can't see everything so you gotta have to let us know you're gonna have to raise a hand you're gonna have to say I need some help write us a note send us an email come talk to us after the service let us protect you let's keep going look at his joy look at his joy I love this part the fifth thing is we see his joy the joy that he has the deep joy in his heart that he experiences for his people look at verses 6 through 8 1 Thessalonians 3 the heart of a shepherd it continues on here in verse 6 it says but now that Timothy has come to us from you see Timothy now returns in the report as we've said before is a good one and it says now that Timothy has come to us from you and has brought us good news of your faith and love and that you always think kindly of us longing to see us just as we also long to see you for this reason brethren and all our distress and affliction we were comforted about you through your faith now we really live if you stand firm in the Lord his joy in his people he finds great joy he finds great satisfaction he finds reason for great excitement in his own spirit because of their spiritual growth because of their spiritual maturity because they're choosing well and walking a path that God intended them to walk they're enduring there look at the text just go back and look at verse 6 but now that Timothy has come to us from you and has brought us good news of your faith you can just write this down they were staying faithful
[time=2583] if life's always perfect for you you wouldn't really understand this but if you're somebody who faces difficulty if you're somebody who encounters trial
[time=2593] if you're somebody who knows what it's like to be in the midst of a storm you like me know how difficult sometimes it is to stay faithful to get up each day and have that time to get up and face each opportunity to see every encounter as a divine appointment to open your mouth when you should to continue to work with your kids to continue to be faithful at your job to continue to honor God in your mind to continue to be obedient with where you go and don't go I mean see sometimes it just gets difficult but they had stayed faithful and it brought them great joy they can look at the verse there has brought us good news of your faith and love they had continued to love you see in the midst of a storm whenever life gets challenging oftentimes in your life in mind that's the first thing to go we might we might give ourselves to this enduring thing but I'll tell you what loving in the midst of that boy sometimes that's the first thing that takes a hike and they had continued to love and when you and I get tired of loving oftentimes we'll turn to lust when you and I get tired of loving oftentimes we'll turn to whatever's gonna make us feel the best the quickest with the most minimal effort made on our behalf see sometimes when we get tired the sacrificial act of loving goes out the window and Paul is so grateful that they have stayed faithful that they have continued to love look down there at verse 8 for now we really live if you stand firm in the Lord and they had been that word in the Greek that phrase in the Greek standing firm you can just write this down it means in the vernacular of our day it just means not compromising not compromising people people again students please hear me on this young adults moms and dads this culture that we find ourselves in unlike any other culture prior to this it is it has absolutely turned up the volume and it has absolutely directed its focus and the message is at the moral and ethical level absolutely clear compromise compromise don't worry about it
[time=2747] you say you're this act like this morally and ethically and personally and relationally compromise do whatever you want to do don't let anybody tell you otherwise
[time=2761] and for a Christ follower today in this society it is an amazing opportunity that we have it's challenging at times to on the one hand walk this road of not compromising saying to yourself saying to your God saying to your family saying to your friends saying to this culture that you are in I am a follower of Jesus Christ and I am absolutely grateful for that and I am devoted to walking that path with as much strength and as much courage and as much love as he'll give me to walk that without getting judgmental without getting harsh without getting legalistic but being a people who will not compromise and to walk that road with a sense of grace and dignity these people were standing firm they weren't laying down don't lay down don't lay down stand up
[time=2827] do it gracefully and do it lovingly but people stand up understand more and more who he has called you to be and stand up and do it lovingly when you do when you do that I can't begin to tell you the joy that it brings my heart I can't begin to tell you how it thrills my soul it's hard for me to describe when I see you when I see you I don't see all of you but I see a lot of you making decisions in your life to stand up to not lay down I see you making relational decisions I see you making business decisions I see you making decisions here in the body of Christ and I see you making decisions out in the marketplace and it fires me up it makes me so so thankful and so grateful it fills my heart with joy and the others in this place who help me shepherd and lovingly it fires them up to it thrills their soul and I want you to make sure you hear this when you don't when you don't choose as you should and I see that too I see it every day I see it every week those scenarios I ran by you earlier I didn't just make those up that was just my last six days and when you choose wrong in the midst of that I want you to hear me it doesn't make us mad at you many of you have grown up in spiritual surroundings where when you messed up they got mad at you then make us mad it makes us sad my heart breaks for you my soul stirs in that sense and those of us that lead and those of us that love when you choose wrong it absolutely breaks our heart you know what it affects me ask my wife ask those that I work most closely with it affects me because we love you and if you need help you got to raise your hand you got to let us know you got to give us the opportunity to be good shepherds number six
[time=2971] we see his affection we see his sacrifice his compassion his protectiveness his great joy number six just briefly down you see in a good shepherd you see his gratitude for his people look at verse nine for what thanks can we render what thanks can we render to God for you and return for all the joy with which we rejoice before our God on your account you know if I had the time I would if there was a way I could walk around this room and just put my hand if if the other pastors on our staff if every elder if every I mean if there was a chance to just and maybe someday we'll just do it the more I talk about it here I'm just thinking well why can't we do it you know I would just love to be able to put our arms around you hope that doesn't make you nervous somebody said to the day that Kelly he's a bit too much on the huggy side I could just put my hand on your shoulder how's that I would love to be able to put my hand on your shoulder and look you in the eye and say I am so grateful for you whoever you are wherever you've been whatever roads you've been down whatever struggles you've endured or not endured I mean whoever you are that you're here and that we get the opportunity to come alongside you to strengthen you and encourage you so you won't be disturbed we're grateful for that I wish I could just look every one of you in the eye this morning and just say I'm so thankful for you and I pray to God that he'll continue to give you opportunity and continue to give us the chance to be in this together look at that last one number seven his intercession his intercession for his people his intercession for his people folks this is what a good shepherd he does all these things and there's others it's not just seven there's probably twenty these are the seven we see in this passage but I tell you what the seventh one is huge whoever you are this morning an elder a pastor a deacon a small group leader a women's ministry bible study facilitator a men's ministry small group I mean whoever you are if you have a mom a dad if God's given you a few to care for be reminded from what we see here in this passage that a good shepherd intercedes for praise for his or her sheep look at verse 10 I love this as we night and day you know when Paul says that you just you tend to believe him as we night and day praying most earnestly when you look at that phrase it was interesting this week when you look at that phrase in the Greek and the original language of the New Testament it's almost as if I mean I won't even get into it all with you but just trust me that that the way it's written I mean it means that he really really really really really deeply deeply deeply and really often like all the time prayed for them they meant that much to him he prayed for them earnestly diligently faithfully zealously do you are you God's given many of you some that he's asking you to shepherd and love and lead and and we end this look at this passage by him reminding you and I but night and day we would keep praying most earnestly that we may see your face and may complete what is lacking in your faith let me ask you to turn to Ephesians Ephesians 1 Ephesians chapter 1 the Corbin leaf Corbin would you come on up and just get ready here let's give you my heart that last song we sing let's get ready to sing that before we go Ephesians 1 can I ask you to stand would you just do that would you just stand let me read Ephesians 1 15 to you would you just stay here don't leave just be real quiet and would you just give me the would you give me the honor of doing here with you publicly what I do so often privately and that is to just pray for you and this is what I often pray for you and I just want you to listen and we love you every one of you so much and and there could be no greater experience for you in life that then that you would understand and that this would come to fruition in your life listen carefully to what Paul said about the people in Ephesus remember the people in Ephesus are the ones where when he left in Acts 20 he just wept at the beach he loved these people so much that as he leaves them on the boat he just falls apart and cries because the love that God had given him for them was so deep and rich and later he writes to them and he says this and I pray this for you this morning for this reason too for this reason I too having heard of the faith of Jesus Christ which exists among you and your love for all the saints I do not cease giving thanks for you while making mention of you in my prayers that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of glory may give to you each and every one of you in this room this morning a spirit of wisdom because God knows you need it God knows that you need to be wise in what you choose and in how you live and he would give to you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of him and you need to grow in that your knowledge of him and who he is and the way he's made you and how he's called you to live I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened not darkened not distanced but that they would be enlightened so that you will know what is the hope of his calling what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints and what is the surpassing greatness of his power toward you who believe and I pray that for you today and with your heads bowed and your eyes closed just know how deeply you're loved today and know too that many of you need help you need encouragement and I meant what I said earlier please give us the opportunity to love you as best we can Corbin with our eyes closed and our heads bowed would you just sing that for us just you and then when you're done would you invite us to sing it with you and I'll close this in prayer when you're done
[time=3424] though and have your way in me sing that sing that with him let's lift our voices to him Corbin leaders
[time=3439] Lord I give you my heart I give you my soul I give for you I don't every breath that I take every moment I'm awake Lord I have your own Lord I give Lord I give you my heart I give you my soul I give for you Lord I give for you Lord I'm awake Lord I have your way in me Father that's our prayer this morning that you would have your way and we know that for you to have your way God because of the way you've designed it we must choose and I pray God that we would that those in this room today that this week that we would choose you that we would walk with you that we would love you that we would give our hearts to you and that if we need help we would ask God thank you for the privilege of being together thank you for this look at a shepherd's heart and bring us back together again soon if that be your will
