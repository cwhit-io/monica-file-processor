[time=30] [MUSIC - 56 seconds]
[time=105] What else can I need to give it all for me and you?
[time=115] We will leave for we receive Your light return of thee.
[time=125] [MUSIC]
[time=133] So come let us raise this God of love.
[time=138] Come let us shout from mountain tops.
[time=143] Come let us save Your God's chosen one.
[time=148] Come all You sinners to Jesus Christ.
[time=153] Come let us raise this God of love.
[time=158] Come let us shout from mountain tops.
[time=163] Come all You save Your God's chosen one.
[time=168] Come all You sinners to Jesus Christ.
[time=177] OK, let's close our eyes and just get lost in the words.
[time=182] We praise You, Lord.
[time=184] Let's just sing to Him.
[time=187] We praise You, Lord.
[time=201] Our God of love.
[time=207] We praise You, Lord.
[time=222] Our God of love.
[time=240] Our God so loved the world that gave His one and only son, that whosoever would believe in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.
[time=252] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Blackhawk Ministries, and it is great as always to get to share this time with you.
[time=259] I am so thankful for the time that we had this past week during our worship services here at Blackhawk.
[time=265] It was phenomenal and what made it phenomenal is what always makes things phenomenal and that is kids, youth, the students here at Blackhawk.
[time=275] We had an absolute blast being led in worship this past Sunday, and you'll see some of that by our student ministry, and then we also had a real treat, and that is we got a chance to hear from the Blackhawk Christian School Audition Choir, and having the Blackhawk Christian School Choir just gives us a chance to tell you how very thankful we are for this ministry that has been a part of our church for years, Blackhawk Christian School.
[time=302] It is an amazing place filled with amazing people and a student body that we just love and care for deeply.
[time=309] And a good friend of mine, Mr. Sam Barfel, who you've met before, serves as our superintendent.
[time=315] He's a pastor on our staff and he gives oversight to the entire school, and I know Sunday was encouraging for Sam, and I just wanted to give him an opportunity to share with you some of what's on his heart, some of what he's thankful for.
[time=327] As he gets to give his life to ministry here at Blackhawk Christian School.
[time=332] So Sam, share with the folks a little bit of your thoughts on Sunday, and then your heart for the school.
[time=337] Thanks, Kelly.
[time=338] You will be able to see here in Bible Hour the Audition Choir Blackhawk Christian High School, and I was so moved Sunday to watch them perform and to hear them sing.
[time=348] One of the things that always moves me is to see the students that I get to hang out with every day, seven hours a day, 180 days a year, give their gifts and their abilities and their talents for the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=359] And so when I see high school students doing that, using their gifts and abilities, it moves me.
[time=364] But that requires just the tip of the iceberg of a student body, 750 strong here at Blackhawk Christian School, preschool through the 12th grade.
[time=372] They're just the tip of the iceberg of all of the students that we have and their hearts desire to live for God.
[time=377] And we have the joy and the pleasure and the privilege of helping give them an academic education based on a biblical foundation, helping them develop a biblical worldview so that they could go out and impact culture for Jesus Christ.
[time=391] I love the ministry of Blackhawk Christian School.
[time=393] I'm partial to it.
[time=394] I love it.
[time=395] I love those kids.
[time=396] And it was just a joy to see them sing and hear them sing, and you'll get that privilege just in a few minutes.
[time=400] Thanks, Kelly.
[time=401] Yeah, absolutely.
[time=402] Like Sam said, we absolutely love what God is doing here.
[time=406] We love what He's doing in our church, and we are so thankful for our school, if you would be, ever in the future interested in learning more about Blackhawk Christian School.
[time=415] Just visit us on our website.
[time=417] You can call us at the number there on the screen.
[time=420] We would love to help you in any way we can answer questions.
[time=423] Maybe God has Blackhawk Christian School in your future.
[time=427] We would love it if that were the case.
[time=429] Thanks so much for tuning in, and God bless.
[time=432] [MUSIC - 180 seconds]
[time=620] [APPLAUSE]
[time=635] [MUSIC - 37 seconds]
[time=674] Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen, amen, amen, amen, amen, amen.
[time=704] Amen, amen, amen, amen.
[time=714] [APPLAUSE]
[time=719] So, here we are.
[time=722] Look out point.
[time=724] Just the two of us.
[time=727] Jan is sure looks hot tonight, but she always looks hot.
[time=731] I can't believe I'm here with her.
[time=733] Look out point with Janis, queen of the prom head cheerleader, class vice president.
[time=739] And she even got her braces taken off.
[time=742] Huh, what a babe.
[time=745] Who would believe it?
[time=747] Maybe this is a dream.
[time=749] I need to pinch myself and see.
[time=752] Uh, lint.
[time=755] Stupid, stupid, stupid.
[time=759] You are so stupid.
[time=762] Well, I'm here.
[time=765] I should do something.
[time=767] Maybe I should ask her.
[time=769] No, this is the first date.
[time=772] I don't want to seem too aggressive, but I don't want her to think I'm a wimp either.
[time=777] She might like guys to be assertive.
[time=780] Yeah, show a little backbone, Kurt.
[time=783] Show her who the boss is.
[time=785] Go ahead, dude.
[time=787] Make your move.
[time=789] Janis?
[time=790] Yes?
[time=792] Uh, nice view, isn't it?
[time=795] I suppose.
[time=796] Well, you can see everything from up here.
[time=799] I guess that's why they call it look out point.
[time=803] Yeah, good name.
[time=805] Stupid, stupid, stupid.
[time=809] Strike two.
[time=810] All the guys will ask me about this tomorrow.
[time=812] And what will they say when I tell them?
[time=814] They'll all laugh at me.
[time=819] I wonder what she's thinking now.
[time=822] Probably the same thing I am.
[time=824] Stupid, stupid, stupid.
[time=828] What am I doing here?
[time=830] Why did I agree to this?
[time=833] We've had a wonderful evening, and I should have left it at that.
[time=838] But no, he said, let's go up to look out point.
[time=842] And I said, sure.
[time=844] The perfect end to the perfect evening.
[time=846] Me fighting him off.
[time=848] Gasping for air.
[time=850] Screaming for the police.
[time=852] Calm down, Janis.
[time=854] Don't get carried away.
[time=856] He's been a perfect gentleman all night.
[time=859] Why would he change into an animal up here?
[time=862] Because he's male, that's why.
[time=866] He asked me up here, didn't he?
[time=869] What kind of a guy would ask a girl to look out point?
[time=873] What kind of a girl would agree to go?
[time=877] Stupid, stupid, stupid.
[time=881] Watch your hands, buddy boy.
[time=885] You've got to watch their hands.
[time=887] Every second you've got to watch.
[time=890] First, I'll slip it around my shoulders, and within seconds he'll be mauling me.
[time=895] Stay alert.
[time=897] Stay focused.
[time=899] I wonder what's taking him so long to make his move.
[time=904] He will, and I'll have to be ready to somehow get out of it without looking bad.
[time=910] I wouldn't want him to tell his friends that I was well not.
[time=913] Cool, but I don't want him to tell his friends that I was easy either.
[time=920] I don't want him to tell his friends anything.
[time=923] I never should have come up here.
[time=927] Good Christian boy.
[time=929] That's what my mom called him.
[time=931] Nice call, mom. That's what you said about David Snyder, and he was all over me like an octopus before we ever pulled out of the driveway.
[time=941] With guys, it seems that being a Christian and behaving on a date just don't line up.
[time=951] That's it.
[time=952] I'm going to learn Karate.
[time=955] I shouldn't have brought her here.
[time=957] She's uncomfortable.
[time=959] I'm uncomfortable, but it's too late.
[time=962] We're here.
[time=964] How do I leave without looking like an idiot?
[time=968] She'll tell her friends I was a loser.
[time=971] I get her up to look out point, and we spent the whole time staring straight ahead.
[time=977] I need to stop thinking and just go for it.
[time=981] But what if she says no, or laughs at me, who I'd be traumatized for life?
[time=988] Man, what a position I put myself in.
[time=991] I can't win.
[time=993] He's not trying anything.
[time=996] Why hasn't he tried anything?
[time=999] Maybe he's not attracted to me.
[time=1003] That must be it.
[time=1005] He doesn't like me.
[time=1007] He must think I'm ugly or something.
[time=1011] Great.
[time=1013] Janice?
[time=1014] Yeah?
[time=1015] Did you enjoy yourself tonight?
[time=1017] I did.
[time=1019] Until now, where does he get off thinking I'm ugly?
[time=1023] He's mediocre at best.
[time=1026] How stuck up can a guy be?
[time=1028] He's got a lot of nerve.
[time=1032] Kurt, it's time to be a man.
[time=1035] It's time to take the bull by the horns and assert yourself.
[time=1039] I can't spend the rest of the night worrying about what Janice will think, or what my friends will say.
[time=1045] If she laughs or tells her friends, well, I'm ready to live with that.
[time=1051] Do it.
[time=1052] Make your move.
[time=1055] Janice?
[time=1056] Yeah?
[time=1058] Well, there's a lot of electricity in this car.
[time=1062] A lot of sexual voltage.
[time=1065] She got in here through her ears and what was said to her.
[time=1069] He got in here through his eyes and what he saw and what he was attracted to.
[time=1076] Sexually speaking, she's like a crockpot.
[time=1081] He's like a microwave.
[time=1086] She wants sex for intimacy.
[time=1091] He wants intimacy for sex.
[time=1096] There's a lot of electricity in this car.
[time=1099] What are you going to do with those sexual desires?
[time=1103] How about their backgrounds and what happened to them in their lives?
[time=1107] Before they got here, do you think they ever looked at the internet?
[time=1111] Think either one of them ever looked at the internet?
[time=1114] 40,000 porn sites.
[time=1116] 30% of all unsolicited emails are porn related.
[time=1121] Maybe he's looked at things he shouldn't see.
[time=1125] Maybe she's gone to chat rooms she shouldn't go to.
[time=1129] Porns a multi-billion dollar industry and it's $3 billion of it is on the internet alone.
[time=1135] But the problem there is what he's seen with his eyes.
[time=1138] The eyes are the lens of the human heart and what he's seen cannot be erased.
[time=1143] And words that she shared quite possibly in a chat room can't be taken back.
[time=1150] What about her? Do you think that she started dating when she was 12?
[time=1155] If she did, there's a 91% chance that she's going to have sex before she leaves high school.
[time=1161] It goes about 50%.
[time=1164] The next few years and it drops to 20% chance if she waited until she was 16.
[time=1169] What about movies and TV? Do you think they've ever seen movies or TV's?
[time=1173] Maybe hundreds of hours, maybe thousands of hours, TV shows and movies?
[time=1180] Well, that's run by an industry of the elite of 38% say of Hollywood's elite that they're concerned about how sex outside of marriage is portrayed on television or on film.
[time=1194] 38% contrast that with the rest of the United States who 83% are concerned about that very fact.
[time=1202] Do you think they've ever gone to church?
[time=1205] Well, 37% of all pastors say that they've done something sexually wrong, that their congregation would deem as inappropriate.
[time=1216] There's a lot of electricity in this car.
[time=1221] Here are the odds on how it's going to shake out.
[time=1225] There's 28% chance that either one of them think that viewing nudity is okay, 28% chance.
[time=1232] There's a 49% chance that they think that sexually fantasizing in their minds about someone who's not your spouse is okay, 49%.
[time=1242] There's a 35% chance that they think that having sex outside of marriage is okay, 35% chance.
[time=1251] There's a 49% chance that they think living together, if this all shakes out the way they're going, there's a 49% chance that they think living together will be okay, 49% chance.
[time=1262] And that, those last four categories, those odds are if they call themselves born again.
[time=1271] If not, you can almost double it on everyone.
[time=1276] So what's going to happen? There's a lot of electricity.
[time=1281] There's a lot of electricity, a lot of voltage.
[time=1284] After violating the trust that she values most, is he going to wonder why she never trusts him?
[time=1294] After gratifying his desires, is she going to wonder why he wants to conclude every time they're together with that same physical act?
[time=1305] Is her desire for intimacy going to fall short and be merely a tension, void of the relationship that she longs to have?
[time=1315] There's a lot of electrical voltage in this car, and what they need to know is their desires.
[time=1324] Their desires are not for their gratification, nor for their elimination, but for their transformation.
[time=1342] Thanks.
[time=1345] This is the series on 1 Thessalonians entitled "Changed." And we're now in the part of 1 Thessalonians chapter 4, where we get in the perinesis section, perinesis.
[time=1357] It means the practical advice.
[time=1360] If you want to turn there to 1 Thessalonians 4, we're going to read it together.
[time=1363] And Paul's talking about living a holy life, a changed life, which is all based on transforming our desires.
[time=1373] So, rabbis, when they teach, they would stand when they would read the Word of God, and then they would sit when they would comment on the Word of God.
[time=1381] So, the listeners and the students would know the difference.
[time=1384] So, to honor what we've been doing here in the series on 1 Thessalonians, could you please stand?
[time=1389] And we're going to read the text together.
[time=1394] Paul writes, "Finally, brothers, we instructed you how to live in order to please God, as in fact you are living."
[time=1401] Now, we ask and urge you in the Lord Jesus to do this more and more, for you know what instructions we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1410] It is God's will that you should be sanctified, that you should avoid sexual immorality, that each of you should learn to control his own body in a way that is holy and honorable,
[time=1424] not impassionate lust like the heathen who do not know God, and that in this matter no one should wrong his brother or take advantage of him.
[time=1433] The Lord will punish man for all such sins, as we have already told you and warned you.
[time=1441] For God did not call us to be impure, but to live a holy life.
[time=1446] Therefore, he who rejects this instruction does not reject man, but God who gives you his holy spirit.
[time=1458] You may be seated.
[time=1461] What we see in those first couple verses is that transformation, this is about transforming our desires.
[time=1466] Transformation begins by full surrender to a life that pleases God, and that transformation is a process.
[time=1474] He says at the end of verse one, do this more and more.
[time=1477] There will be a progression in what we're talking about today.
[time=1481] Desires are not for their gratification nor for their elimination, but for their transformation to God's desires.
[time=1489] Verse three, it is God's will, Greek word for will is the lema, that's God's desire, that you should be sanctified.
[time=1498] Sanctified and holy are the same word, ones the noun, ones the verb, means to be set aside, signified, purified, means to be transformed into the heart of God.
[time=1508] Holiness, sanctified, transformed, shaped into the heart of God.
[time=1515] And he tells you three ways. Paul tells you three ways that we're going to do this.
[time=1521] Leviticus 1144, this is a big deal.
[time=1524] "Be holy for I am holy," God said.
[time=1527] "I am the Lord your God, consecrate yourselves, set yourself aside, and be holy because I am holy."
[time=1534] It comes from God.
[time=1537] So first we see there in verse three, desires are not for their gratification.
[time=1542] He says avoid sexual immorality.
[time=1545] Very interesting that he says be holy and then the first topic is sex.
[time=1549] Well, it was a problem.
[time=1551] He says avoid sexual immorality.
[time=1553] Avoid means empty out.
[time=1555] Sexual immorality, the Greek word is pornia.
[time=1558] It means fornication before marriage, adultery during marriage, two things.
[time=1564] Fornication before marriage, adultery during marriage.
[time=1569] And that covers everything before marriage, everything.
[time=1574] Lusting, you name it.
[time=1577] Hebrews 13-4 says this.
[time=1580] Hebrews 13-4 says marriage should be honored by all and the marriage bed kept pure.
[time=1586] For God will judge the adultery and all the sexually immoral.
[time=1590] The marriage bed kept pure means no foreign substance.
[time=1594] You will never let enter in your sexual desires a substance other than the person
[time=1601] whom you eventually or are married to.
[time=1604] And this was a real problem in the Greek culture, especially in Thessalonica.
[time=1609] They had the cult called Kabbarus I've talked to you about.
[time=1612] And it was all about money and it was all about sex, even at religious sites.
[time=1617] Marriage, as you see back then, were arranged between 13 and 14-year-old girls and guys in their mid-20s.
[time=1623] So oftentimes they had never met.
[time=1626] And so it was expected that married men or soon-to-be married men would have sexual relations with prostitutes, female slaves, or mistresses outside of marriage.
[time=1638] One quote a few hundred years before Christ in this same culture.
[time=1642] It said mistresses we keep for our pleasure, concubines for our day-to-day physical well-being and wives to bear us legitimate children and to serve as trustworthy guardians over our households.
[time=1654] Lot hasn't changed in twenty-three hundred years.
[time=1657] A stoic philosopher Cato that lived the first century B.C.
[time=1663] praised men.
[time=1665] He praised men who gratified their sexual desires with the prostitute rather than with another man's wife.
[time=1671] So they bring kind of a distorted moral grid to the scene.
[time=1674] See, income for prostitution was substantial for the economy.
[time=1678] There were innkeepers and cook shop owners who made money by providing the sexual outlet, but it wasn't just with the Greek cultures, with the Jews as well.
[time=1686] In Judaism, if there was an adulterous offense, blame would go to the woman.
[time=1694] In John 8, when we see the woman caught an adultery, there's an absence of her supposed lover.
[time=1700] That's indicative of the scene of events.
[time=1702] They thought that women didn't have the moral fiber to uphold the law, and so they blamed them.
[time=1707] And in two thousand years, it hasn't changed much, has it?
[time=1711] You can go to any high school in America and a girl who sleeps around will be called, and you can fill in the blame.
[time=1719] You are filling in the blame.
[time=1721] A guy who sleeps around is called a stud.
[time=1725] And it hasn't changed.
[time=1726] It was so bad in the culture that Emperor of Rome, Augustus, instituted Julian laws in a failed attempt to reform sexual misconduct.
[time=1738] It didn't even work.
[time=1741] Avoid sexual immorality.
[time=1744] Empty out all pornia.
[time=1747] I brought an illustration because I think especially for men we need pictures today.
[time=1752] And so I got my first picture here.
[time=1756] That's an electrical transformer.
[time=1759] That's the flow of electricity.
[time=1762] I didn't know what a transformer did.
[time=1765] I thought it was just this box of energy.
[time=1768] I knew where there was one on my property at home, but I didn't know what it did.
[time=1772] Well, I learned something.
[time=1773] That a transformer, electrical transformer, has a purpose.
[time=1777] It's purpose is to either bring down the voltage that's coming into it for what's on the other side, so it's not too much for what's on the other side.
[time=1786] Kind of like your power needs to be brought down at your house for your doorbell.
[time=1790] So there's a transformer.
[time=1791] Does that make sense?
[time=1792] I don't know what I'm talking about, so I've got to make sure you're with me.
[time=1796] Or the voltage comes in and it steps it up.
[time=1801] So it's big enough for what's on the other side.
[time=1804] Are you with me? So a transformer can either step down or step up.
[time=1809] That's a primary coil.
[time=1812] That's where the voltage comes in that wraps around.
[time=1814] That's the core in the middle.
[time=1816] That's a magnetic field where the transformation process occurs.
[time=1820] And that's the secondary coil where it goes out.
[time=1823] I don't know anything.
[time=1829] So the question is, what about you?
[time=1835] Paul says sexual desires are not for our mere gratification.
[time=1841] And he says go for the transformation process, bring that voltage in,
[time=1847] and have that sexual immorality desire step down.
[time=1852] We need to step down transformer.
[time=1855] And so where are you in your life?
[time=1859] If you're not married yet, you know, maybe you're less than for girls in middle school and high school if you're a guy.
[time=1866] Not supposed to do it.
[time=1868] Maybe you're a girl and you want attention for yourself and you're wearing things maybe you shouldn't wear.
[time=1873] And the attention you want for your soul, you're getting on the outside.
[time=1876] And it's not what you're designed for.
[time=1879] Maybe you're married and you got an emotional connection with someone at work and you shouldn't have that emotional connection.
[time=1885] You need to step down.
[time=1887] Maybe you're visiting porn sites you shouldn't visit.
[time=1890] Maybe you're looking at magazines you shouldn't look at.
[time=1892] Maybe you're engaging in chat room conversations in which you should not engage.
[time=1897] Avoid.
[time=1899] Purnia.
[time=1900] Avoid.
[time=1901] Sexual immorality.
[time=1902] Desires are not for their gratification.
[time=1906] But Paul goes on to say that they're not just for their gratification.
[time=1910] They're not for their elimination either.
[time=1912] He says control your body.
[time=1915] Control your body.
[time=1916] It means to guide your body.
[time=1918] There's this great question around this phrase.
[time=1921] Control also means acquire.
[time=1924] And vessel, the word used for body here, also is used for wife.
[time=1930] So some scholars say, Paul is saying go acquire your wife.
[time=1935] Some say that he's saying about control your body.
[time=1939] That he means a body believer.
[time=1940] Some say he means the physical body.
[time=1942] In fact, there's cultural sayings that kind of indicate it.
[time=1945] It probably is talking about your physical body.
[time=1948] And it doesn't really matter which one or three it is because it's all the same point.
[time=1952] God designed you and he designed me to have sexual intimacy with one person and one person only
[time=1960] and intimacy of any kind with one person and one person only and that's the person we marry.
[time=1965] Genesis 2, 24.
[time=1968] Genesis 2, 24 says that a man's going to leave his family,
[time=1974] cleave to his wife, and they'll become one flesh, weave their lives together as one.
[time=1981] Leave, cleave, weave.
[time=1986] Doug Weiss, an author, calls what happens to a guy here the way God's designed it, sex glue.
[time=1993] Because what happens in a guy's brain when there's sexual intimacy is that chemicals come to his,
[time=2000] the part of his brain called the pre-optic neuron that's designed for risk and excitement.
[time=2005] And only during sexual intimacy does this become full.
[time=2008] Okay?
[time=2009] Well, God's designed it so that the eyes, the lens of the human heart, what a guy sees during that intimacy is woven to his heart and that's only, that happens in his brain.
[time=2020] He's going to see a picture when it happens in his brain and it's supposed to be the face of his wife.
[time=2025] Leave, cleave, weave.
[time=2027] Now you see the problem with sexual immorality, whatever lusting the guy's brought into the equation prior to marriage.
[time=2034] Whatever sexual activity he's brought into marriage prior, prior, prior to marriage.
[time=2039] Whatever he's done, poor Nia, outside of a relationship with his spouse has distorted that picture that God's designed for his wife.
[time=2049] I think God is a really cool God to do it that way.
[time=2053] And so Paul says control your body in a way that is wholly and honorable.
[time=2058] Not in passionate lust like the heathen who do not know God.
[time=2062] Isn't it interesting that the difference between us who would call ourselves fully surrendered and those who we would say are not is not our superior willpower but our intimacy with God.
[time=2077] Let me say that again.
[time=2079] The difference between the church, a believer, a fully surrendered person and those who are not is not superior willpower
[time=2088] but intimacy with God.
[time=2092] And Jesus says it's a heart condition. Out of your heart comes sexual immorality and adultery.
[time=2099] Anyone who is lust after woman in his heart has committed adultery with her in his heart.
[time=2106] It's an intimacy with God's situation. So can I bring up the transformer again?
[time=2111] We know that a transformer can step up or step down and we're stepping down, we're avoiding sexual immorality.
[time=2119] Emptying it out, right?
[time=2123] Sexual desires or any desires really but sexual desires today are not for my gratification.
[time=2129] Nor are they for my elimination, control your body comes up.
[time=2132] That voltage comes into the transformer and it gets stepped up for my wife or my future wife
[time=2139] or my future husband if I'm a woman on this side or my husband.
[time=2143] Does that make sense? The transformer brings down.
[time=2149] Sexual immorality brings up.
[time=2152] The control of my body guiding it towards that which it was made.
[time=2157] Well, not only desires are not for their gratification, not for their elimination, desires are for their transformation.
[time=2168] In verses 6 through 8 Paul takes a turn here and says you know what? It's not about you.
[time=2176] It never has been about you. It's about other people and it's about God.
[time=2183] And he takes his talk about a community, about loving others. Do not wrong your brother, he says.
[time=2190] Do not take advantage of your brother in this manner.
[time=2193] Let's look at 1 Corinthians 7 verses 2 through 5. He's taking this turn. It's not about you.
[time=2198] It's not about your selfish desires. It's not about getting them gratified.
[time=2201] And it's not that you've got some superior willpower and you can eliminate them.
[time=2206] They need to be transformed and here's the way it's supposed to be.
[time=2209] But since there is so much immorality each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband.
[time=2217] The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife. And all the guys said.
[time=2223] And likewise the wife to her husband. The wife's body does not belong to her alone, but also to her husband.
[time=2231] In the same way the husband's body does not belong to him alone, but also to his wife.
[time=2236] Do not deprive each other except by mutual consenting for a time so that you may devote yourselves to prayer.
[time=2242] That's intimacy. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self control.
[time=2249] That's how he's designed it. That your body's not even your own.
[time=2252] Paul also writes in 1 Corinthians 6 that you've been bought for a price. It's God's.
[time=2256] And don't take that temple the Holy Spirit in a situation it's not supposed to be in.
[time=2261] And then he warns that God punishes sexual immorality.
[time=2264] And our culture is such today that if I will go into what possible punishments are from God on sexual immorality
[time=2271] you be kind of turned off a little bit because how our culture has influenced you.
[time=2274] But let's just look at Galatians 5 19 through 21.
[time=2279] Galatians 5 19. The acts of the sinful nature are obvious. Sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery.
[time=2286] Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions.
[time=2294] Now are we covering everything here?
[time=2296] If you think you're doing okay on the sexual thing you've probably done these others.
[time=2300] Okay? Let's go on.
[time=2302] And envy, drunkenness, origins and the like.
[time=2305] I warn you as I did before that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God.
[time=2310] Oh my goodness.
[time=2312] Well yeah, we all deserve hell.
[time=2315] But I just want to tell you Kelly talked on this one time. He said it so well.
[time=2319] What he's saying there's live like this.
[time=2321] If your life is characterized and known by.
[time=2324] A heart that did not fully surrender and partially surrender.
[time=2328] One foot in one foot out and live life that way.
[time=2330] Well don't expect some miraculous deal at the judgment day.
[time=2334] All right?
[time=2335] But let me just say this.
[time=2337] If you have messed up.
[time=2339] If you are an adulterous relationship right now, if you have been.
[time=2343] If you're in high school and you've already broken the trust of intimacy.
[time=2349] Wherever you are.
[time=2352] If you're in homosexuality.
[time=2354] You are not too far from the grace of Jesus Christ.
[time=2362] The grace of Jesus Christ can reach any human being anywhere.
[time=2367] And all you need to do is fully surrender your life in an intimate relationship with him.
[time=2374] Receiving his forgiveness and his lordship for your life.
[time=2379] And you know what my dad told me one time.
[time=2381] He put his arm around me and says Mitch whatever you do in your marriage.
[time=2386] Whatever you do.
[time=2388] That really affects other people.
[time=2391] It affects your employees.
[time=2393] It affects your family.
[time=2396] And I think about this 1 Corinthians 7 passage.
[time=2400] He says Mitch you know if anybody gets a divorce.
[time=2404] A guy looks at that guy and says or that woman and says well they did it.
[time=2409] And when you look at the consequences of what 1 Corinthians 7 says.
[time=2413] If you're an adulterous affair with maybe another married person.
[time=2417] You're not just hurting that person.
[time=2420] You're hurting that person's spouse.
[time=2423] You're hurting that person's children.
[time=2428] You're hurting that person's extended family.
[time=2431] If they have when you're hurting that person's church.
[time=2433] And the consequence is just ripple out and go on and on and on.
[time=2437] The only reason you're in it if you really want to be honest is your selfish desires.
[time=2442] It's so rampant that people want to live together.
[time=2445] We're bumping it into it as pastors all the time.
[time=2447] 40% of people who live together.
[time=2451] This is a consequence of violating this trust.
[time=2454] 40% of the people who live together cease living together and never get married.
[time=2460] If they do get married they have a 50% more likely chance to get divorced.
[time=2466] 50% higher divorce rate.
[time=2469] Paul says it's not just about other people.
[time=2472] It's about God.
[time=2474] Verse 7.
[time=2476] "For God did not call us to be impure but to live a holy life.
[time=2479] Therefore he who rejects this instruction does not reject man but God who gives you his holy spirit."
[time=2486] And that's the key.
[time=2488] It's interesting you punishes but he warns first Paul made that clear.
[time=2491] See God calls us to be transformed with our lives, to be holy with our lives, to have our desires transformed to be God's desire with our body, soul and spirit.
[time=2500] Nobody here could go up to a flagpole on a wintery day in January and put your tongue up against it and walk away and not leave part of you there.
[time=2510] Right?
[time=2511] Well we do the same thing.
[time=2513] We kind of think that we can do that with sex.
[time=2516] That we can go and separate our bodies from our soul and our spirit but we're not.
[time=2522] We're leaving part of ourselves there.
[time=2525] A part that was never designed to be there outside of marriage.
[time=2530] The wise calls this three dimensional sex.
[time=2533] God's designed it for a husband and a wife to have body, soul, our mind's will and emotions and spirit fully connected in that process.
[time=2542] As part of my study for this sermon I read Oprah's February issue over magazine O.
[time=2548] How many people saw it?
[time=2550] Kelly are you looking?
[time=2552] Okay.
[time=2553] So they interviewed 37,000 people for Valentine's Day and they wanted to ask him about romance and sexual intimacy and the whole thing.
[time=2560] It was so interesting to learn that almost every woman says about her husband that it's just as stimulating to her.
[time=2571] To see the husband like do odd jobs around the house and take care of the kids than it is for a romantic candle like dinner and chocolate and gifts.
[time=2585] I've been vacuum in my house.
[time=2590] What's that?
[time=2591] I'll get it.
[time=2592] I'm super dad.
[time=2595] It's strange hours of the night, "Hey kids, let me help you get ready for school."
[time=2601] But the point is your body isn't your own if you're married.
[time=2607] And the whole idea is that you do for the other person what he or she wants with your life and with no strings attached.
[time=2614] And then Kelly Sermon said that today on the Bible hour with no strings attached.
[time=2617] If there's strings attached it's kind of like a car dealer who just wants to sell you a car but doesn't care at all about who you are.
[time=2624] You know what I mean?
[time=2626] And that's the way we treat our wives if we just say you know this is all about me getting there with you.
[time=2631] But it's all about when we're together and in sexual intimacy we do what we like for the other what the other person likes and then with our lives.
[time=2640] It's for the other person.
[time=2643] But it's because God gives us present tense the power of his Holy Spirit.
[time=2650] That's what makes us different.
[time=2653] Any religion in the world can give you principles.
[time=2656] Snap a rubber band every time you lust.
[time=2658] You know all that kind of stuff.
[time=2660] But you and I have the spirit of the living God.
[time=2666] That is so different.
[time=2669] Not religion, relationship.
[time=2671] It's based on our intimacy with him.
[time=2674] Galatians 516, so I say live by the spirit and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature.
[time=2683] Could he be any more clear?
[time=2686] And 2 Corinthians 3 18 says, "And we who with unveiled faces means that we fully surrendered and now see all reflect the Lord's glory, his character and presence, and are being transformed into his likeness with ever increasing glory.
[time=2703] Ever increasing revelation of the character and presence of his heart of who he is.
[time=2707] All based on my intimacy.
[time=2709] I'm being transformed into that.
[time=2711] And that comes from the Lord who is the spirit.
[time=2713] Paul writes that.
[time=2714] 2 Corinthians 3 18.
[time=2716] Let's go back to the transformer picture, guys.
[time=2720] Desires are not for our gratification, right?
[time=2723] Avoid sexual immorality.
[time=2725] Bring that into the transformer.
[time=2726] It gets stepped down.
[time=2727] Desires are not for our elimination.
[time=2729] Bring that voltage into the transformer.
[time=2731] It gets stepped up to control the body.
[time=2734] Guide it toward my spouse the way it's supposed to be guided or my future spouse.
[time=2739] This is what's so cool.
[time=2741] That's why I use this illustration.
[time=2743] The Holy Spirit is our transformer.
[time=2747] We come in intimacy with God and he transforms whatever that desire is.
[time=2751] See, we can't gratify every sexual desire at will.
[time=2757] You know, I was thinking that if a married couple had sex all the time, it's about one-half of one percent of their lives together.
[time=2765] One-half of one percent.
[time=2767] What about the rest of life?
[time=2770] You know, it's not for my gratification.
[time=2773] Avoid poor Nia.
[time=2775] It's not for the -- and that gets stepped down.
[time=2777] It's not for my -- it's not for the elimination.
[time=2779] I can't pretend I don't have him.
[time=2781] That becomes a very dangerous place.
[time=2783] In fact, 2 Corinthians 10-5 says don't pretend.
[time=2786] Don't have pretension about God.
[time=2788] Take every thought captive and give it to God.
[time=2790] We're going to get to that.
[time=2792] But it's not for the elimination.
[time=2794] I build up.
[time=2795] It steps up.
[time=2796] The Holy Spirit steps up.
[time=2797] My guidance of my body toward my spouse.
[time=2799] And he transforms me.
[time=2801] That magnetic field in the center, the Holy Spirit of God is the transformer.
[time=2806] And that's the other thing.
[time=2807] Principles and stuff like that.
[time=2808] It's okay to have tools and help you do that.
[time=2811] Like bouncing your eyes, guys, and stuff like that.
[time=2814] But you cannot do it alone.
[time=2817] You cannot do it on single-phase power.
[time=2821] You have to tap into three-phase power.
[time=2826] The community of the living God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[time=2829] That's the difference.
[time=2831] Sitting at a restaurant this week with a friend who's left his wife and children for another woman who's married.
[time=2841] And I said, "Man, if you can just help me on what will convince you, this wasn't our first meeting." I said, "You can help a couple thousand people on a Sunday and maybe twenty-five thousand who watch it the next week.
[time=2855] Why don't you just tell me?" Because I'm preaching on this.
[time=2858] He goes, "What passage are preaching on?" He's a believer.
[time=2860] And I told him, and we start talking a little bit about it.
[time=2864] And he says, "You know what, man?
[time=2866] I want to go back to my wife.
[time=2869] I know it's right.
[time=2871] In fact, I can almost see myself doing it.
[time=2875] But I can't.
[time=2877] It's so hard." And I kept coming back to these last couple verses of Paul writes.
[time=2884] I said, "You know what, man?" We talked about the consequences.
[time=2888] The consequences about a judge telling him when he's going to see his children or not.
[time=2893] The consequences of what he's doing to the other woman's children.
[time=2898] What he's doing to her husband.
[time=2900] What he's doing to his wife.
[time=2902] What's happening to their careers.
[time=2905] What's happening to their extended families.
[time=2907] We talked about that a lot.
[time=2908] And I said, "You know what, man?
[time=2910] You don't have to do this alone." And I came back to this last verse.
[time=2914] I said, "You know what?
[time=2916] You've got three things.
[time=2917] And this is the three things I'm going to give you today.
[time=2919] You've got the Spirit of God.
[time=2923] And you've got the people of God." And here's the deal.
[time=2927] Spirit of God.
[time=2928] What I'd like you to do, guys.
[time=2930] And women too.
[time=2932] Whenever you have that inappropriate thought, take it to God in confession immediately.
[time=2939] And tell him exactly what it is.
[time=2942] Don't just go, "No, be clear.
[time=2947] Say it to God in prayer.
[time=2950] Be authentic." That's what confession is.
[time=2952] Agree with God with what this is.
[time=2955] And then help him transform in obedience.
[time=2958] Ask him to help you to transform in obedience as he's the transformer.
[time=2961] Any thought like that towards your wife.
[time=2966] That's amazing.
[time=2967] David in the Psalms gets there with God.
[time=2969] Every Psalm starts, "Oh God, do this to my enemies.
[time=2972] Oh God, I feel like this." And at the end he says, "Oh God, you transform me." And that's all you're doing there.
[time=2979] And that is so powerful.
[time=2981] Quit trying to do it on your own.
[time=2983] And if you're in an adulterous affair or you're starting an emotional relationship, you shouldn't start.
[time=2988] Man, run like Joseph.
[time=2990] Get away from her.
[time=2993] And guys especially have tried this.
[time=2995] To make your life live with your prayers.
[time=2997] See women, see females at the soul or heart level.
[time=3001] Look at them in the eyes.
[time=3005] If you find yourself looking at a woman's body, don't look anymore.
[time=3010] But look them in the eyes.
[time=3011] Look them at the heart, the soul level.
[time=3013] It's what you're designed to do.
[time=3015] Quit trying to rip their bodies from their soul and their spirit.
[time=3019] Girls, you can help do that.
[time=3023] My brother gave a sermon on this.
[time=3025] And you know the guy's got the problem with the eyes.
[time=3028] So my brother says three things.
[time=3030] Don't wear something that's too tight.
[time=3032] Too short or too revealing.
[time=3035] Too tight, too short, too revealing.
[time=3042] First Peter, especially in church too.
[time=3045] First Peter 3 says that you're not designed for that.
[time=3048] You're not designed to show that to other people except your spouse.
[time=3052] You're designed to have the purity of your heart and your intimacy with God have that revealed with your life.
[time=3060] And if you're married.
[time=3062] I think if you're not married, I'd stay away from this as couples.
[time=3065] If you're married, I think you should pray together.
[time=3067] It's been really hard for me to implement that in my life because I don't know.
[time=3070] I don't have any problem speaking in front of large crowds.
[time=3073] I did auctions in front of big crowds and televised on ESPN.
[time=3076] I love all that.
[time=3077] But to be intimate with my wife alone in prayer and take that lead, that's really vulnerable.
[time=3082] But we've done it and it's been great for our intimacy together, our relationship together.
[time=3086] So couples should pray, married couples should pray audibly together.
[time=3089] Second, we have the word of God.
[time=3091] Were you given the First Sussonians passage on a laminated card when you walked in?
[time=3095] Guys, when you're tempted, quote scripture.
[time=3098] It's what Jesus did.
[time=3100] Quote scripture, power equipment here has ten different laminated cards that they're using for guys to use, quote scripture.
[time=3107] And women do the same thing.
[time=3109] And couples, married couples, study the Bible together.
[time=3112] That's intimacy.
[time=3113] See, Ephesians 5 thing coming.
[time=3116] And the people of God, authentic community.
[time=3119] Kelly and I were talking about this.
[time=3121] This is only as good as the authenticity that's brought to it.
[time=3124] But I believe with all my heart, I think women too, I'm going to focus in on the guys because I'm a guy.
[time=3129] I believe every single man should be in a relationship that's authentic with another man where he confesses what he confessed to God there under the Spirit of God.
[time=3137] Where he says, I am tempted to do this.
[time=3140] I am emotionally connected to her.
[time=3144] And that puts flesh on God.
[time=3146] And I've had a relationship like that with a guy for about 12 years.
[time=3150] We're not just talking about sexual temptation all the time.
[time=3152] But it's a place to do that.
[time=3154] And it's a safe place.
[time=3155] And getting that out, in many cases, is the difference of you going forward and mulling
[time=3161] that over as James I talks about and making that sin versus not making it sin.
[time=3167] Every guy needs that.
[time=3168] And every guy can get a brochure out in the foyer about the mentoring program that's available.
[time=3176] It's mad, mentor, accountability and discipleship.
[time=3179] We have the brochures at the men's table in the foyer.
[time=3182] I'm going to say it again.
[time=3183] Every man, 11, 12 years old, up, got to have a guy like that.
[time=3188] Women, I think you should too, have a woman like that.
[time=3191] But you need to determine how that works.
[time=3194] Transforming result, here's what happens.
[time=3196] Wives who respect their husbands.
[time=3198] It's what Paul writes in Ephesians 531.
[time=3200] They just want to be your knight in shining armor.
[time=3202] They just want to be respected.
[time=3204] And we realize that desires are not for our gratification nor their elimination but for their transformation, then that's what happens.
[time=3210] We make it about them.
[time=3211] We make it about God.
[time=3213] And we quit white knuckling selfishly, those desires to be gratified.
[time=3217] And then we have husbands who intimately love their wives.
[time=3220] Wives who respect their husbands and marriages and families and communities who love God.
[time=3225] I'm going to close with a story.
[time=3230] Aurelius lived in Milan, Italy several hundred years ago.
[time=3235] He was brilliant.
[time=3236] He was handsome.
[time=3238] He was educated.
[time=3239] He was persuasive.
[time=3241] He held the most envied professorship in the city.
[time=3246] Life wasn't easy.
[time=3247] He lost his father when he was a teenager.
[time=3250] He had a mistress for 15 years.
[time=3252] They had an illegitimate child together.
[time=3255] He was engaged to a young girl.
[time=3257] And that wedding at this moment we're going to come into his life was two years off.
[time=3261] So just like I talked about earlier, he's sleeping with another woman.
[time=3265] His mother, Monica, has been praying for him to fully surrender his life to Christ since he was a little boy.
[time=3272] And he's taken some time out of his busy schedule to meet with a guy who's a high-ranking government official in his city.
[time=3279] But this official, this man who's going to meet with Aurelius is fully surrendered to Christ.
[time=3285] And he starts to ask Aurelius, this man does about his journey and where he is, spiritual journey.
[time=3295] And the Aurelius responds, "During my university days at Carthage, I found myself in a hissing cauldron of lust.
[time=3302] I grew proud in the imagination of my heart." And he shares that with his visitor.
[time=3308] Then later alone he was thinking, "I am utterly depraved.
[time=3312] The mind alone is no match for the seduction of evil pleasure." And regarding his thought that full surrender to Christ meant total change from his misuse of sex.
[time=3323] He said what my friend said to me, "Part of me wants to?
[time=3326] Part of me is unable to." And Aurelius, while crying out to God over the sexual desires that were preventing him from
[time=3334] fully surrendering his life to Christ because he wanted him gratified.
[time=3337] He said they can't be eliminated.
[time=3339] I got to have him gratified.
[time=3340] He heard this small voice that sounded like a child's voice coming from next door.
[time=3345] And it said, "Take up and read.
[time=3350] Take up and read." And he has an open Bible on the table because he was studying the letters of the Apostle Paul.
[time=3361] And it's open to Romans 13 which says, "Let us behave decently as in the daytime,
[time=3369] not in orgies and droppingness, not in sexual immorality and debauchery, not in dissension and jealousy, and listen.
[time=3377] Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the sinful nature."
[time=3385] And at that moment, he got on his knees and he fully surrendered his life to Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.
[time=3393] And nine days later, having her prayers answered, his mother Monica died.
[time=3399] You see that person, you and I know, as Saint Augustine, the Archbishop of Hippo in the fourth century.
[time=3409] Augustine was one of the most influential men, not only in his lifetime, but to ever live.
[time=3417] Almost every sermon is influenced by the thinking of Saint Augustine.
[time=3422] Because for 44 years, he studied the Scriptures.
[time=3425] He's defended the Scriptures.
[time=3427] He's a great mind.
[time=3428] He's one of the greatest minds God ever created.
[time=3430] And sexual desires were his barrier to God.
[time=3434] But Augustine realized that sexual desires are not for his gratification nor their elimination, but for their transformation.
[time=3441] And it all happened.
[time=3442] This is what's so cool, and we'll close with this.
[time=3444] The Spirit of God, he heard a still small voice.
[time=3447] The Word of God, Romans, was sitting there open on his table.
[time=3450] And the people of God who came around him, his visitor, the government official, and his mother.
[time=3455] In church, that's what we have.
[time=3457] And that's why we're different.
[time=3459] And we can change the world with this concept.
[time=3463] Please stand and I'll pray.
[time=3470] And now God is one of the most difficult topics to talk about and discuss.
[time=3475] I just pray that as I prayed prior, alone with you, that it was your words, not mine.
[time=3481] And the God your transforming Holy Spirit was at work here today.
[time=3486] And I'm reminded that that's in the present tense.
[time=3489] Paul said, "He gives, God gives you the Holy Spirit, that three-face power tapping in the community of God, and God may be so in this place."
[time=3498] God, if someone's struggling with an emotional affair or a physical one, God helped that person run.
[time=3504] May that person go get help from a brother or sister in Christ and run.
[time=3509] God, for a high school student who's struggling or may be in a relationship that he shouldn't be in or she shouldn't be in, God help him to run.
[time=3517] And help him to run to their intimacy with you.
[time=3519] And God, by the Spirit of God, by the Word of God, and by the people of God, may we as a church experience transformation of our desires, God.
[time=3528] Not for their gratification nor their elimination, but for their transformation.
[time=3532] And may it be so in this place, in Jesus' name, amen.
