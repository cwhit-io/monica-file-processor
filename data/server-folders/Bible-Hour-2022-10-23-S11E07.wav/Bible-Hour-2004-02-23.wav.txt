[time=397] - Father, we pray this morning
[time=405] that you would dwell here in our midst.
[time=407] We want this house to be a house of prayer.
[time=412] We want everything we do this morning, the songs we sing and the conversations we have and the message that we listen to and absorb and learn from to all be a fragrant offering to you.
[time=425] May you be pleased with our sacrifices.
[time=428] May they be acceptable in your sight.
[time=431] We want to see your glory and we ask that you'd give us the strength to endure it.
[time=438] In Jesus name, amen.
[time=439] - Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=445] And it is good to be with you again.
[time=446] We're so thankful that you've tuned into the broadcast.
[time=449] And I want to tell you something as a Bible hour viewer, something that we've really appreciated and something we've enjoyed recently and that is the chance to hear from you.
[time=459] Several weeks ago, we mentioned to you that there is now a Bible hour survey that we're asking you to take.
[time=466] That survey is now available to you on our website at blackhawkministries.org.
[time=471] If you'll click on the Bible hour link, when you come to the Bible hour page, there's a little box over on the side that says, "Take survey." And we view you in the Bible hour audience as part of our family.
[time=483] Many of you we know have home churches, but many of you don't.
[time=487] And we want to do our best to get to know you better as if you were literally here.
[time=492] We want to understand you.
[time=494] We want to know about your needs.
[time=495] We want to know about ways in which we can come alongside you.
[time=499] We want to do our best to help you along on your spiritual journey.
[time=503] And so do us a favor, would you?
[time=505] It can be anonymous or you can give us your information.
[time=508] We would love for you to take the survey.
[time=510] Would you please go and do that?
[time=513] We would love to hear from you.
[time=514] If you don't have a computer, if you write into us at Blackhawk Ministries, we would be more than happy to send you a copy of the survey and then you can mail that back.
[time=524] But we would love to know more about you.
[time=526] We counted a joy to minister to you.
[time=529] And we want to do that in a better, more meaningful way.
[time=532] So let us hear from you.
[time=533] Take the Bible hour survey on our website and we'll look forward to hearing from you.
[time=538] Hey, today's message that you're going to hear is the first in a two-part message that we've entitled the will to chill.
[time=545] That's right, the will to chill.
[time=548] And here's the deal.
[time=549] If you ever in your life feel as if life is controlling you, instead of you controlling your life, if ever you feel as if the pace of your life is maybe a bit too fast, if ever you feel as if it's a bit too frantic, a bit too frenzied, if you like me at times feel as if there's so much going on, so many things pulling at you, so many places to go, so many things to do.
[time=577] Sometimes in the midst of that, you and I need to be willing to step back and consider the kind of life, the kind of living that God has called us to, because the Scriptures are really clear.
[time=589] And in our first Thessalonians passage that we come to today, he makes it abundantly clear that there is a way to live life, there is a way to give ourselves to this life that God has called us to.
[time=601] And frantic and frenzied and overcommitted isn't the way he wants it to get done.
[time=608] And so listen today, open your heart and open your mind to what the Word of God will have for you.
[time=614] You and I have got to be people who are willing to make difficult decisions at times and come back to a way of living, a simpler, more meaningful way of living that allows us to connect to him and to others in the way he designed us to.
[time=631] Please listen, open your heart to it.
[time=633] My hope and my prayers that you'll be encouraged as you do.
[time=663] Well, this morning, in our study of first Thessalonians,
[time=671] we will in just a minute or so get to a point in our passage where it talks about relationships and how very, very important it is that you and I be a people who give ourselves to relationships.
[time=683] And before we get really serious with that, we're going to just give you the opportunity to kind of have a light-hearted look at how that process for some of us can at times be a bit awkward or challenging.
[time=697] And I guess the way I'd want to set it up is to just say, I know those of you ladies in the room, all of you women, you seem to have the relationship building thing down a little bit better than sometimes us men do.
[time=713] And you know, bless your heart, guys.
[time=716] I know we try at times.
[time=717] It can be a little bit difficult, but today you're just going to see a real live example of how we can just kind of stay at it.
[time=724] And it's a comical, light-hearted look.
[time=727] So just kind of switching your minds now to light-hearted.
[time=730] A comical, light-hearted look, guys, at how we can get there.
[time=734] It's a little challenging at times, but we can get there.
[time=737] Ladies, just bear with us.
[time=739] It sometimes doesn't look like it does with you, but it looks like it does with us and we're trying.
[time=745] Well, anyway, just take a look and see what you think.
[time=749] Sorry, I'm late.
[time=751] That's OK.
[time=752] So, how's it going?
[time=755] Fine.
[time=756] You?
[time=757] Fine.
[time=759] How's Nancy?
[time=760] Fine.
[time=761] She's off on some garden walk this morning with the girls.
[time=765] Wow, a whole Saturday morning to yourself, huh?
[time=768] Yeah, I'll probably do some more work on the basement.
[time=772] How's Christine?
[time=773] Oh, she's fine.
[time=776] So what's on your agenda for today?
[time=779] I've got a window I need to get recocked.
[time=782] On the second story?
[time=783] Yeah.
[time=785] Uh-huh.
[time=786] Is there something wrong?
[time=792] No, why do you ask?
[time=795] Well, you sounded a little serious on the phone.
[time=797] I thought maybe there was some reason you wanted to meet for breakfast this morning.
[time=800] Well, now we can't have breakfast together anymore.
[time=802] No, no, we can meet for breakfast.
[time=803] What's wrong with a couple of guys having breakfast together?
[time=805] Nothing, nothing at all.
[time=808] Just seem a little on edge.
[time=811] That's all.
[time=812] Is there something you want to tell me, Sam?
[time=817] [LAUGHTER] No?
[time=821] Fine.
[time=824] Here.
[time=829] What's this?
[time=831] I don't get it.
[time=832] I'm returning your drill bits.
[time=834] I don't understand.
[time=837] You can't possibly be done with them.
[time=840] I don't need your drill bits anymore, Sam.
[time=844] Well, my drill bits aren't sharp enough for you.
[time=848] What is it?
[time=849] Thinking about buying some of my own?
[time=851] That's crazy talk.
[time=855] I saw you.
[time=862] What?
[time=863] I saw you in Stan's garage.
[time=865] I know what's going on.
[time=866] Right, wait a minute, Ron.
[time=867] You borrowed his ladder.
[time=869] Ron.
[time=871] Look, hey, don't try to deny it.
[time=873] I saw you walk over there, talk to Stan.
[time=876] He helped you carry it back to your house.
[time=878] Did you think you could get away with that?
[time=880] It's right across the street.
[time=882] I'm not blind.
[time=884] I'm trusting, but I am not blind.
[time=889] It was one time.
[time=893] That's very original.
[time=894] No, I needed to replace a paint in that window.
[time=897] I came by your house, but nobody was home.
[time=900] And by the way, where were you at 10 o'clock at night, huh?
[time=903] Well, I wasn't out borrowing someone else's ladder.
[time=906] On my way home, I saw Stan tinkering in his garage.
[time=913] I stopped.
[time=915] We talked.
[time=916] He was very understanding.
[time=920] And that makes it right.
[time=921] I was weak.
[time=922] He had what I needed.
[time=923] You couldn't have waited and called me the next morning.
[time=927] I thought we had something.
[time=928] We do, Ron.
[time=929] We do.
[time=930] You have no idea how that made me feel.
[time=934] I've got a perfectly good ladder sitting in my garage.
[time=936] I know, I know.
[time=937] You've borrowed it before, and if I recall, you said you liked it.
[time=942] I did.
[time=942] I mean, I do.
[time=944] I mean, his is aluminum.
[time=946] I know, yeah.
[time=947] Mine's fiberglass.
[time=950] Won't conduct electricity.
[time=951] It's commercial grade.
[time=952] Look, if it makes you feel any better, I didn't enjoy it.
[time=961] It doesn't even have one of those paint can't hold or things on it.
[time=966] It's pathetic.
[time=966] This is so ironic.
[time=972] You know, today, I was hoping that we could sit down and talk about taking the next step together.
[time=978] I've borrowed everything of yours.
[time=979] From your cord of a screwdriver to your ratchet set.
[time=983] But I just feel like we've hit a wall.
[time=986] I borrowed your weed, Trimmer.
[time=989] That's a three amp electric.
[time=991] It's not even gas powered.
[time=995] I'm ready for something more.
[time=999] Look, I want to borrow your mower.
[time=1008] The deer, she's brand new.
[time=1011] I know.
[time=1012] I want to borrow your brand new John Deere writing mower.
[time=1019] You're just messing with me now.
[time=1022] Look, I am not ashamed.
[time=1024] Damn.
[time=1025] You don't believe me.
[time=1026] No.
[time=1028] Ladies and gentlemen, I want to borrow this man's brand new John Deere writing mower.
[time=1034] Sit down.
[time=1034] I don't care what I mean.
[time=1035] I don't care anymore.
[time=1036] Come in.
[time=1037] Oh, gosh.
[time=1038] My mower-- I don't know what to say.
[time=1047] Say yes.
[time=1048] My heart wants to say yes, but my head
[time=1054] is causing me to hesitate.
[time=1057] Listen to your heart, Ron.
[time=1059] I've never let my mower to anybody.
[time=1064] I need to know if-- tell me something, Sam.
[time=1073] Where do you see us in five years?
[time=1074] Well, I'm not sure you're ready to hear this yet,
[time=1082] but in five years, I could see us recreating together.
[time=1087] Hey, don't say that unless you mean it, buddy.
[time=1089] No, I mean it.
[time=1090] You know, a movie with the girls.
[time=1092] A ballgame, just the two of us.
[time=1094] Golf.
[time=1095] Golf?
[time=1096] Yeah.
[time=1097] There's no distractions out in the links.
[time=1099] It's just you and me walking and talking.
[time=1103] It can take four hours.
[time=1106] Sometimes more.
[time=1109] Oh, well, I'm lightheaded.
[time=1113] Look, I've had other friends before, but this is serious.
[time=1122] I got to think about this.
[time=1123] Let it sink in a while here.
[time=1124] Where you going?
[time=1126] I can't eat.
[time=1129] I'm going to go home.
[time=1131] I'm going to tell Nancy about all this, and I'm going to sharpen the blades on my new lawnmower.
[time=1138] OK.
[time=1142] I guess I'll see you in about an hour then, huh?
[time=1146] I'll be there.
[time=1146] OK, wait.
[time=1151] Don't forget these.
[time=1152] Well, we'll keep at it, guys.
[time=1165] We'll keep plugging away on the relationship thing, and we'll see how it goes.
[time=1170] Hey, welcome to a continued look at this amazing book of First Thessalonians.
[time=1175] If you've been around, you know that we have been studying this book for a few months now, and we find ourselves today, plugging our way through chapter 4.
[time=1184] Open your Bibles, if you would, to First Thessalonians, chapter 4.
[time=1188] This is a study of this book that we have entitled changed.
[time=1192] And what an amazing thing it has been for us.
[time=1195] To see the change that God brought into the lives of those at Thessalonica, what an even more amazing thing for us.
[time=1202] And I want you to hear me say this.
[time=1204] For us here to get to see you changing, to hear the conversations that we have, to receive your notes or your emails, to know that God is at work, as He always is, through the truth of His Word, as it penetrates the lives and hearts of people, it is absolutely amazing.
[time=1221] And so very, very gratifying for us to see you changing through this study.
[time=1227] It is a treat.
[time=1229] First Thessalonians 4, 9 to 12.
[time=1235] Before we read it, let me ask you a few questions.
[time=1238] Let me try my best to just paint a picture that I hope most of you in the room this morning will be able to identify with.
[time=1244] My bet is that you will.
[time=1248] Isn't it true?
[time=1248] Isn't it true that life can so easily and so quickly
[time=1258] get so absolutely out of control?
[time=1264] Have you noticed that?
[time=1265] Have you seen that?
[time=1266] Have you experienced that?
[time=1268] Would you agree with that?
[time=1269] Isn't it true that life, your life, and mine can seemingly like that get so out of bounds,
[time=1281] so busy and so frantic and so packed and so loud
[time=1292] that it absolutely gets overwhelming?
[time=1295] For some of you here in the room this morning, it's happened for some of you in the room this morning, your life is over the edge.
[time=1301] And I know what it looks like.
[time=1305] I know how to identify it because I, like you,
[time=1311] have struggled and continue to struggle with the very same issue.
[time=1317] This is not something foreign to me.
[time=1319] It's not something that's foreign to any of us in this room, if we're all honest.
[time=1325] Life can get really, really out of control, schedules, obligations, involvements, practices in games, car pools, play dates, nights out, shopping, trips, business trips, social gatherings, vocational advancement, and all that comes with that, hobbies, television viewing, computer time, chat rooms, addictions, and even ministry involvement.
[time=1349] How do we do?
[time=1352] Did any of that resonate in your own heart, in your own life schedules, obligations, involvements, practices, games, car pools, play dates, nights out, shopping trips, business trips, social gatherings, vocational advancement, hobbies, television viewing, computer time, chat rooms, addictions, and yes, even spiritual activity can lead us to a life that is absolutely over the edge.
[time=1377] And in the midst of all that, in the midst of all that, watch what happens.
[time=1382] Intentional times.
[time=1385] Intentional proactive efforts on your part and mind to give ourselves to relationship building.
[time=1394] Intentional times of spiritual formation, you individually, giving thought and time and energy to Christ forming in you or spiritual formation as it relates to your family even, and the time needed for you to invest in that, see what happens is in the midst of life gone over the edge.
[time=1415] Intentional times of relationship building and spiritual formation and involvement in things that count, they go away.
[time=1429] They disappear off the screen as our life travels along
[time=1435] at breakneck speed in the fast lane of life.
[time=1445] You know, it wasn't always this way.
[time=1450] And this is not meant to be necessarily nostalgic.
[time=1453] It is a little bit, but just a look back, as I read through an article that a friend gave me recently, just a look back serves as a great reminder of the fact that you know what people it hasn't always been this bad.
[time=1469] It was amazing to read.
[time=1470] I absolutely just sat at my desk and laughed and even cried a little as I thought back on my own life
[time=1479] to hear this author who wrote the article say it.
[time=1481] It was quite interesting.
[time=1483] Listen, if you will.
[time=1484] This guy says, according to today's regulators, according to today's experts in bureaucrats, those of us who were kids in the '40s, '50s, and '60s,
[time=1496] probably should not have survived.
[time=1497] Raise your hand if you were a kid in the '40s, '50s, and '60s.
[time=1502] Keep it up, if you were a kid in the '40s, '50s, and '60s.
[time=1505] According to this guy, we all should have died.
[time=1508] You can put your hands down.
[time=1509] Listen, we had baby cribs.
[time=1511] Our baby cribs were covered with bright-colored, lead-based paint.
[time=1516] We had no child-proof lids on medicine bottles, doors, or cabinets, and when we rode our bikes, we wore no helmets.
[time=1526] As children, we rode in cars with no seatbelts, car seats, or airbags, riding unrestrained in the back of a pickup truck on a warm day was a special treat.
[time=1535] We drank water from garden hoses and not from bottles.
[time=1543] We ate cupcakes, bread, and butter, and drank soda pop with lots of sugar in it, and we were never overweight because we were always outside playing.
[time=1554] We shared one soft drink with four friends from one bottle, and no one actually died from this.
[time=1562] We would spend hours building our goats carts out of scraps, and then riding them down the hill only to find out we had forgotten the breaks.
[time=1572] After running into the wall or the bushes or the trees a few times, we learned to solve the problem.
[time=1581] We would leave home in the morning, go to school and play all afternoon as long as we were back when the street lights came on.
[time=1588] No one was able to reach us all day long.
[time=1591] No cell phones, no pagers, just dad's whistle.
[time=1598] Remember dad's whistle?
[time=1601] I can hear mine right now.
[time=1603] I can hear it in my ear.
[time=1605] The author says unthinkable that this would be this way.
[time=1611] We did not have PlayStation, Nintendo, or Xbox.
[time=1614] No video games at all, no 99 channels on cable, recorded movies, Tivo, surround sound, personal cell phones, personal computers, internet chat rooms, or DVDs in the car.
[time=1627] 200 teenagers just gasped.
[time=1634] When we needed something to do, we had friends, and we went and found them, and we played.
[time=1644] We played war, king of the hill, dodgeball, and sometimes the ball would hit us.
[time=1650] And it would really hurt.
[time=1652] We fell out of trees.
[time=1653] We got cut.
[time=1654] We broke bones and teeth, and there were no lawsuits from these accidents because they were.
[time=1658] Say it with me.
[time=1660] Accidents.
[time=1661] No one was to blame but us.
[time=1663] Remember accidents?
[time=1664] We had fights and punched each other and got mad and black and blue, and we learned to get over it.
[time=1670] We made up games using sticks, and we ate worms.
[time=1673] And although we were told it would happen, we didn't poke anybody's eye out, nor did the worms live inside us forever.
[time=1680] We rode bikes or walked to a friend's home and knocked on the door or rang the bell or just walked in and said, hi, back then, Pop Warner or Little League had tryouts, and not everyone made the team.
[time=1694] Those who didn't learned to deal with disappointment.
[time=1698] Some students weren't as smart as others, so they failed.
[time=1703] They were held back to repeat the same grade.
[time=1705] Tests at school were never adjusted for any reason.
[time=1709] Our actions were our own.
[time=1712] Consequences were expected, no one to hide behind the idea of a parent bailing us out if we broke a law was unheard of.
[time=1719] They actually sided with the law.
[time=1722] Imagine that.
[time=1723] How did we ever survive?
[time=1725] This generation has produced some of the best risk takers, problem solvers, and inventors ever.
[time=1731] The past 50 years have been an explosion of innovation and new ideas.
[time=1736] We had freedom, failure, success, and responsibility, and we learned how to deal with it all.
[time=1746] And I would just add, there was absolutely nothing like the sound of the ice cream guy coming around the corner, just rifling through my mom's change drawer, trying to get 20 cents, you know?
[time=1758] How's that sound to you today?
[time=1766] How's that sound, a simpler life?
[time=1770] How's that sound, a less frantic life?
[time=1779] Sounds good, doesn't it?
[time=1784] I would say it this way, a more meaningful life.
[time=1791] If anything about that kind of living resonates in your soul this morning, you will be blown away by our passage today.
[time=1799] Would you in honor of God's word stand as we look at 1 Thessalonians 4, verses 9 to 12?
[time=1807] And let me say this to you before we read as it relates to honoring God by our standing.
[time=1815] I had a great conversation recently with someone and just wanted to relay this to you.
[time=1819] We stand like this to honor God.
[time=1822] We believe it's a way that we can show reverence to Him.
[time=1828] Some people want to make reverence completely about things like this, standing.
[time=1835] Some people want to make reverence to be about stained glass.
[time=1838] Others want to make reverence to be about what you wear.
[time=1843] And I just want to remind all of us that though you stand here this morning and we appreciate that, and I believe God can be honored by gestures of this nature.
[time=1852] Reverence, my friends, is an issue of the heart.
[time=1857] And I really don't care what you wear and what glass there is or isn't or whether we stand or sit.
[time=1866] Know that you can be standing today dressed really nice with an absolutely irreverent heart.
[time=1876] And so be careful.
[time=1879] And we encourage you this morning as we stand, our hope is that we stand with a heart that longs to bring honor and glory to Him.
[time=1886] And we oftentimes see how the people of old would stand.
[time=1889] Sometimes they lay down on their faces because the word of God is that special.
[time=1895] And so collectively we do it.
[time=1896] But individually, don't forget.
[time=1899] These are issues of the heart.
[time=1901] It says in 1 Thessalonians 4, verses 9 to 12, "Now as to the love of the brethren, you have no need for anyone to write to you.
[time=1908] For you yourselves are taught by God to love one another.
[time=1912] For indeed you do practice it toward all the brethren who are in all Macedonia.
[time=1917] But we heard you, brethren, to excel still more.
[time=1923] And to make it your ambition to lead a quiet life and attend to your own business and work with your hands just as we commanded you so that you will behave properly toward outsiders and not be in any need." Pray with me, would you, Father, God, we come before you this morning.
[time=1946] And I believe most in the room today would want to come before you reverently with great respect, with great awe, with that sense of it being hard to even believe that we could come into your presence.
[time=1962] And yet, God, you invite us to, and so we come today.
[time=1964] We come into this place and we sing how it would be so, so good one day to be in your courts.
[time=1972] God, to sing your praises.
[time=1973] And we look forward to that day with great anticipation.
[time=1976] But God, in the meantime, we know we need direction.
[time=1979] In the meantime, God, we know we need your hand and we need your truth.
[time=1985] And we need our hearts and our minds and our lives to be taught again today by these ancient words that are ever true.
[time=1995] And so, God, we come before you and we ask that very thing that the Spirit of God and the Word of God would do its work in the people of God and that we would be reminded of things that we've possibly forgotten.
[time=2008] God, that we would be taught new truth in a way that would transform not only our minds, but the way we live our life.
[time=2014] God, that you would, in the midst of it all, be changing us and allowing us the privilege of honoring you in return.
[time=2021] We thank you.
[time=2023] We thank you for the opportunity to be in this place together and to open this book.
[time=2028] Grow us, please.
[time=2029] Change us.
[time=2031] In your son's name we pray, amen.
[time=2034] You can be seated.
[time=2037] So how can we refocus?
[time=2040] I mean, if it's a need in your life, I know it is in mind, how can we refocus and bring meaning back to a frenzied life?
[time=2049] Hey, just to make sure, okay?
[time=2050] Just to make sure on the application front that there's actually some people in the room that might possibly need some encouragement in this arena, if your life in any way at all you might describe as at times being a bit over the edge.
[time=2064] If in your life you sense you might could use a biblical reminder as to what a simple God-honoring life looks like.
[time=2071] Well, then just see your hand real quick.
[time=2073] Just make sure I'm not just talking to myself.
[time=2075] Okay, great, good.
[time=2076] Well, then get your pen out and here we go.
[time=2079] First Thessalonians 4, 9 to 12, we've called it the will to chill.
[time=2084] And here's where it begins.
[time=2085] Number one, if you and I are interested in a simple God-honoring life, Paul begins by, in essence, saying to you and I, love more.
[time=2095] Love more.
[time=2098] Now as to the love of the brethren, verse nine, you have no need for anyone to write to you for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another.
[time=2108] For indeed you do practice it toward all the brethren who are in all of Macedonia, but we urge you, brethren, to excel still more.
[time=2118] Watch how this goes.
[time=2120] You see in chapter four, verses one to eight were Mitch had us last week.
[time=2124] The message was really clear.
[time=2125] When it comes to living out our faith, when it comes to following Christ, there are some things, namely sexual immorality, that you don't want to do.
[time=2135] He takes us through those first eight verses in chapter four, and in essence says, don't do this.
[time=2141] This isn't what you were made for.
[time=2144] This isn't what brings honor to God.
[time=2146] Control your bodies.
[time=2148] Move your passions in a God-honoring direction.
[time=2151] Don't do this, he says.
[time=2154] And then he comes to verses nine through 12, and in essence says, in light of what we don't want you to do, hey, let's be really clear.
[time=2161] Here's what you should do.
[time=2163] Here is a good beginning.
[time=2164] Here is a God-honoring foundation.
[time=2167] Don't do that, do this.
[time=2168] Law, and he starts with love people.
[time=2171] Love them.
[time=2173] And he says, I know you're doing a pretty good job of it.
[time=2176] You're being loving to all the people in Macedonia.
[time=2180] You're a good church, and you've embraced this love thing, and I can say to you, this family here at Blackhawk, you're doing a pretty good job of this.
[time=2189] I see acts of love often around this place, and Paul says to them, I see you're doing okay, but excel still more.
[time=2198] You want to simplify life?
[time=2202] Maybe you can even already start to see how this starts to fit in.
[time=2204] You want to simplify life?
[time=2207] You want to begin to move back away from the cliff?
[time=2211] He says, begin to view, begin to live life, begin to see the opportunities to love more.
[time=2220] Do this.
[time=2223] Love each other.
[time=2224] Listen, sacrifice for each other.
[time=2228] Give to each other.
[time=2229] Serve each other.
[time=2231] Give preference to each other.
[time=2233] You want to start to simplify your life?
[time=2236] Do that.
[time=2237] Begin with a renewed commitment to others, and a drastically reduced commitment to you.
[time=2246] See, part of the frenzy, part of the life over the edge, part of the life out of control, I know, I've been there, is that we can get so consumed with me.
[time=2260] We can become so blinded, and so given to getting what I want, going where I want to go, having it all feel like I want it to feel sometimes at the very crux of life out of control is you and I in our selfish, self-centered, self-pleasing ambition.
[time=2282] And so as this simplified life begins to be painted, he begins with the truth that is so very important.
[time=2288] Love, love more, he says.
[time=2293] Hey, just real briefly, here's some things to write down.
[time=2296] And let's be real practical, okay?
[time=2298] Let's be real honest.
[time=2299] Let's just bring this to where you and I live.
[time=2302] Number one, love your children.
[time=2304] Write it down.
[time=2306] Many of you in the room this morning have them.
[time=2308] Some are young, some are students and teenagers, some are getting older.
[time=2313] But please write it down.
[time=2314] Please consider this this morning.
[time=2316] Love your children.
[time=2318] Don't neglect them, mom, dad, don't neglect them.
[time=2323] No, love them and love them still more, excel still more, invest in their lives.
[time=2329] Play with them, like really, play with them.
[time=2333] Build something with them, sing with them.
[time=2337] Read the Bible with them, laugh with them, play rough house with them, eat with them, put them to bed, read them a story.
[time=2345] Love your children, don't neglect them,
[time=2351] and please, let me just say this briefly, don't confuse indulging them, don't confuse spoiling them, don't confuse fixing all their problems with loving them, because the two are absolutely drastically different in their definition and in their result.
[time=2369] I can tell you that.
[time=2371] Love your kids.
[time=2376] And if you need some help, ask.
[time=2379] We'll help you.
[time=2380] Love your spouse.
[time=2388] Many of you in the room this morning have one.
[time=2390] Some of you in the room this morning are about to lose them.
[time=2397] Love your spouse, people.
[time=2400] You stood in an altar.
[time=2404] I don't know all the circumstances, but you know what, I don't need to.
[time=2409] You stood in an altar and you said I do.
[time=2411] You said you would.
[time=2415] I said I would, so do it.
[time=2417] And do it well, and do it with energy, and do it with hope, and do it with meaning.
[time=2423] And you say, hey, that's easy for you to say, you know what, it's not.
[time=2427] Every one of us in this room, my wife, me,
[time=2435] you, your spouse, whoever you are, it's not easy all the time.
[time=2439] Yes, there are days of absolute bliss.
[time=2443] Yes, there are seasons of absolute joy.
[time=2446] Yes, when you follow God and when you honor Him, and when you honor her or honor the spouse, yes, there are times when great blessing comes, but you know what, there are days when it's not fun.
[time=2458] There are days when her habits, or his quirks, or the things that are so very disappointing just continue.
[time=2465] And you know what, let me say this, I realize there are some in the room this morning, and you are facing circumstantially in your marriage, deal-breaking stuff.
[time=2474] There are some in the room this morning, and the law is being broken, or he's hitting you, or there's been unfaithfulness.
[time=2484] There are a few in the room this morning, and the issues are that severe, and yes, some things need to happen of a drastic nature.
[time=2494] You know what though, this is the honest truth people, and you know I love you, and you know I care for you.
[time=2500] Most of the racket I hear, most of the flags that get waived, most of the stuff that just starts to hit the fan, most of it isn't that severe.
[time=2511] Most of it has to do with you and I, being willing and ready to stay at it.
[time=2517] To love, not with the love that we can produce, but to as a fully surrendered follower of Christ, who has access to the power of God himself, through a yielded spirit that's willing to serve, and lay down its life, you and I have to keep doing that.
[time=2534] Day after day, after day, after day, and what gets so worrisome for me and others, is to hear from me at times, and from you it is so hard.
[time=2546] I just don't think, and four year old eyes are watching.
[time=2553] And third grade little girls are getting a picture painted of what I do and love really means, and middle school boys and girls, and high school students are watching love absolutely disintegrate because it's so hard, and I know it's hard, but God calls you and I to a love that's beyond what you and I can muster, and promises to give you and I the strength to offer that day after day, after day, after day.
[time=2584] And so I encourage you this morning, I know he does things that absolutely, not only drive you nuts on kind of a superficial level, but he may be doing things that deeply concern you.
[time=2601] She may be so very hard at times to let, you know what, stay at it.
[time=2606] I mean, as long as we're talking about these issues that fall under the parameter of things we've got to stay at.
[time=2613] If we're talking about this, this or this, okay, but most of the time, my experience is, we're talking about this stuff.
[time=2623] And he says to you and me this morning, excel still more.
[time=2628] Keep loving her, keep giving yourself to him, and if you need help, ask.
[time=2634] Love each other, love your children, love your spouse,
[time=2640] and love each other.
[time=2641] Sacrifice for each other, serve each other.
[time=2645] Says in 1 Peter 122, you can write it down, it won't be on the screen.
[time=2649] It says in 1 Peter 122, "Since you have in the body of Christ, "since you have an obedience to the truth purified your souls "for a sincere love of the brethren fervently." It says fervently love each other.
[time=2663] Your love for him should be fervent.
[time=2668] Your love for her should be passionate and ongoing and persistent and meaningful.
[time=2675] Our love for each other should be radical.
[time=2678] It should make no sense to the common everyday mind.
[time=2684] You should be, and I should be so willing and so ready and so wanting to excel still more to love fervently in the way we relate.
[time=2693] And I know that there are people in this room that are hard for you.
[time=2696] I know that there are people in this family that sometimes are difficult to love.
[time=2703] Says excel still more.
[time=2705] Give yourself to that process because this family, your family and this family have got to stay together.
[time=2716] You want to simplify your life, people begin
[time=2722] begin by loving more.
[time=2726] You know what's amazing, the time it takes for you and I to be good lovers of God and people.
[time=2733] There's nothing, that's a lot right there.
[time=2736] We don't have time for Xbox or whatever.
[time=2740] Number two, be still more.
[time=2744] This is hard for some of us in the room this morning.
[time=2748] Number one, love more.
[time=2749] You want to simplify your life in a God honoring way, be still more.
[time=2752] Look at verse 11, and make it your ambition, he says, to lead a quiet life.
[time=2760] Stop right there and make it your ambition to lead a quiet life.
[time=2766] This is a great reminder that though there is great urgency in following Christ and I believe there is, and even though the days are numbered for us to leave our lasting mark, Paul never commanded the Thessalonians.
[time=2779] The scriptures never command you and I to live lives filled with noisy, frenzy, frantic, fast-paced living.
[time=2786] And there are people in this room this morning and your life is characterized by that.
[time=2793] Your life is frenzied, your life is frantic, your life is fast-paced.
[time=2798] He says, what an interesting phrase, catch this, he says, make it your ambition.
[time=2806] The word in the Greek there is, philotometomai, philotometomai, make it your ambition.
[time=2815] It means zealously and tenaciously.
[time=2819] That means with great energy.
[time=2821] So he says, make it your ambition, you are to zealously and aggressively.
[time=2827] Lead a quiet life.
[time=2831] The word there in the Greek for quiet life is, Hescú, Hescúcazo, it means to be quiet, it means to be at peace, it means to be tranquil.
[time=2843] He says, make it your ambition, ambitiously.
[time=2849] Relax.
[time=2852] Chill.
[time=2855] Just take a deep spiritual and literal breath.
[time=2861] And in doing so, understand the opportunities
[time=2869] that that brings.
[time=2869] Strive eagerly, one author said, strive eagerly to lead peaceful, simple lives free of conflict, void of hostility.
[time=2878] That's right, Romans 12 says, you can write this down.
[time=2880] Romans 12 says, as far as it depends on you, be at what?
[time=2884] Be at peace with all men.
[time=2887] God's word again and again and again calls you and I to a peaceful, unified, harmonious, tranquil existence.
[time=2894] As far as it depends on you, Romans 12 says, be at peace with all men.
[time=2899] Now we can't control how other men or women would respond to our effort at peace.
[time=2905] They may not want to talk, they may not want to work at it, they may not want to reason, but you know what?
[time=2910] He says to you and I, go try.
[time=2912] Do everything within your power to be at peace because the conflict and the tension that comes with the conflict and the destruction that comes with the tension that has to do with the conflict, it's all bad.
[time=2925] Do what you can, he says, to be at peace.
[time=2932] You ever met someone who seems to thrive on relational tension?
[time=2936] Ever been around somebody like that?
[time=2939] You ever been with somebody who seems to always be in the middle of one relational crisis after another?
[time=2945] Just step back and look at their life.
[time=2947] I guarantee you that person's life is out of control.
[time=2952] I know because there have been times in my life
[time=2958] when that's been me.
[time=2961] How about you?
[time=2962] Embiciously, be still.
[time=2970] Question for you this morning.
[time=2971] When are you still?
[time=2977] I mean, like when in your day, when in your week do you get really, really quiet and really still before him?
[time=2987] Do you ever wish you heard less of this world and more of him?
[time=2991] Say amen if that's true.
[time=2994] Do you ever wish you had less static, more clarity?
[time=3000] Do you ever wish you had more God in your ear
[time=3007] and in your heart and less of them?
[time=3011] We have a TV at home, drives me nuts.
[time=3017] We nixed cable a couple of years ago so there's no cable and so we get a few stations now and then it just drives me nuts.
[time=3023] If it's like a, if it's a clear day past 8.30 at night we get like two stations and if it's cloudy on Thursday on the third week of the month we get one.
[time=3031] It just makes no sense.
[time=3033] Sometimes it's clear, sometimes it's staticy, it's never really clear and then sometimes the fuzz is vertical, sometimes it's just drives me, kids love it.
[time=3043] As long as the kids have volume and they can see Clifford, they're like, oh this is great, there's Clifford.
[time=3048] You know I want to see the ball flying through the air.
[time=3051] I want to see the five iron from 175 yards out.
[time=3054] I want to see the ball flight.
[time=3055] I can't see the ball flight, it drives me nuts.
[time=3058] See I need it to be clear.
[time=3061] I'll say that again.
[time=3066] I need it to be clear.
[time=3067] I mean to like feel connected and to enjoy the experience
[time=3074] and for it to be what it can be.
[time=3076] I see I need it to be really, really clear.
[time=3079] When does it get really, really clear for you?
[time=3083] Where do you go?
[time=3088] How much time do you give it?
[time=3090] When in your life do you just stop?
[time=3095] For once when do you just stop?
[time=3098] And listen or read or pray or sing?
[time=3106] You know what I found this week?
[time=3111] I've probably read through this, five hundred, I don't know.
[time=3117] I've read through this hundreds of times and it never hit me like it did today.
[time=3121] I believe there was something too, I really do.
[time=3125] I believe there was something to the Sabbath.
[time=3127] And watching the passion of the Christ again this past week, it just got me thinking about it.
[time=3133] I've been reading back through some of the gospel accounts.
[time=3136] All right and I just want you to look, go ahead and look at Luke 23 just for a moment.
[time=3142] And I admit this is one of those deals where it might not strike you like it struck me.
[time=3148] But when I read this this week, having studied our passage today in 1 Thessalonians 4, it bowled me over.
[time=3156] It was just such, and you know why I think it bowled me over?
[time=3159] You know why I think it hit me so hard because I so often violate this.
[time=3162] In Luke 23, 52, this man that's talking about Joseph
[time=3169] of Arimathea, this man went to Pilate
[time=3175] and asked for the body of Jesus.
[time=3177] Jesus has now been crucified, he's dead.
[time=3181] And he took it down and wrapped it in a linen cloth and laid him in a tomb cut into the rock where no one had ever lain.
[time=3189] It was the preparation day and the Sabbath was about to begin.
[time=3193] Now the women who had come with him out of Galilee followed and saw the tomb and how his body was laid, then they returned and prepared spices and perfumes.
[time=3204] Stop right there, okay, you get the picture.
[time=3206] These are the gals that have been there.
[time=3207] These are the gals that loved him so dearly.
[time=3209] These are the gals that had seen so much.
[time=3212] And in their great love and devotion to him, they prepare these spices and now they've seen where he's laid and with their great zeal and with their great commitment to him, I can only imagine they would have wanted to go and just do what they wanted to do.
[time=3226] And it was a good thing they wanted to do.
[time=3228] And it just hit me as I read it.
[time=3234] And on the Sabbath day, they what?
[time=3236] They rested according to the commandment.
[time=3241] Did they go and anoint the body?
[time=3244] Yes or no?
[time=3245] No.
[time=3247] But, here you go, chapter 24 verse one.
[time=3249] But on the first day of the week had early dawn, right?
[time=3254] They were ready to roll.
[time=3255] At early dawn, they came to the tomb bringing the spices which they had prepared.
[time=3260] Is that hitting you like it hit me?
[time=3264] We, we just, you and I, we just race a thousand miles an hour past opportunities like that every day, let alone every week.
[time=3275] These people were on to something.
[time=3277] I believe God was on to something when he said to you, "Hey, take a day and stop." Chill, relax, take a big spiritual breath.
[time=3292] Renew your heart and mind.
[time=3295] Be intentional toward people.
[time=3298] Give yourself the spiritual formation.
[time=3304] You want to simplify your life in a God-honoring way?
[time=3308] Love more.
[time=3310] Be still more.
[time=3314] And number three, gossip or talk less.
[time=3319] Let's just look at this real quick and then we'll come back to this next week.
[time=3324] Look at first Thessalonians chapter four and make it your ambition to lead a quiet life and attend to your own business.
[time=3333] Stop right there and attend to your own business.
[time=3338] This one is real straightforward.
[time=3341] When necessary and you know what most of the time it is,
[time=3349] keep your mouth closed.
[time=3351] Stay out of my, stay out of each other's business.
[time=3356] If you needed to know you would have been told, if you needed to pray, you would have been asked.
[time=3364] So many times we do such great service to this thing called unity when we start to talk about people and situations and events you have no business talking about.
[time=3379] And there's a great discussion here that we can have on you and I attending to our own business and then he gets to a fourth point where it talks about us being workers, us being faithful to our jobs and how all of it are loving more and are being still more and are talking less and are working hard, brings honor to God and really, really helps support another endeavor that Paul brings great importance to that you and I need to consider and we'll consider that next week, okay?
[time=3419] Why don't you stand and let's pray.
[time=3420] Would you bow with me, Father, Father in Heaven,
[time=3431] we are so grateful for this life that we've been given.
[time=3435] And for many of us, even this week, we've been reminded that it was the brutal death and sacrifice of your son that has given us this life and it is a life God that in all honesty at times we have abused.
[time=3450] We have been at times so irresponsible with this life,
[time=3456] with this precious gift of 24 hours.
[time=3460] And God, our prayer today is that we would be a people whose hearts and lives and schedules and minds and spirits would be open to a kind of living God, to a kind of relating, to a kind of serving, to an existence that would be simple enough to allow us to give ourselves to that which we need to be given to.
[time=3481] God and at the same time allow us to be appropriately productive and be appropriately able to provide and appropriately able to give ourselves to the opportunities God that we believe you've given us.
[time=3495] God, we need wisdom in the midst of this.
[time=3498] God, we need discernment and we pray you would grant it so that we could be a people who could move back toward a kind of living and a kind of choosing and a kind of relating that is meaningful, that is deep, not shallow, full of substance and most importantly, God, a kind of life that would reflect the kind of God that you are to an on-looking world.
[time=3523] God, please continue to grow us in this direction.
[time=3526] Bring us back again, God, if that be your will, and we'll thank you for it in your son's name and all the people agreed and said, amen.
[time=3534] (upbeat music)
