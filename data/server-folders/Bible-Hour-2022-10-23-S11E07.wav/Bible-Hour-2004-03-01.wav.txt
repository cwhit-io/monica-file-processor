[time=138] Oh God, you are good, and your name is worthy to be praised.
[time=142] Your name is worthy to be blessed.
[time=147] Lord, be pleased with the sacrifice, a praise that we bring this morning, with the songs that we sing.
[time=153] We don't want them to be merely words spoken from lips, but God, we want them to be messages from our hearts straight to yours.
[time=161] (upbeat music)
[time=168] God, you are good, and when all things seem to be stripped away, and it seems like we're left with nothing, and it comes down to just you and us.
[time=181] We want a bigger picture of you.
[time=183] We want a more solid foundation set in our minds so that we can stand on the rock.

[time=1365] Hey, open your Bibles if you would to 1 Thessalonians chapter 4.
[time=1369] 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 as we continue to make our way through this great book, the series that we have entitled changed, changed.
[time=1379] You know, the truth of the matter is so many of us still need to experience change.
[time=1385] I met recently with a guy who came to me for some counsel,
[time=1392] and as we said and talked, it began to be very, very clear.
[time=1396] I appreciated so much his openness and his honesty and his transparency.
[time=1400] As he shared with me the reality of his life that day, it began to be very clear very quickly that his life, his personal life,
[time=1409] his marriage, his wife and his two kids, his work situation, every arena of his life was completely and absolutely not of control.
[time=1421] He was losing it.
[time=1423] He was absolutely losing it.
[time=1427] He was on the verge of losing his job.
[time=1429] He was on the absolute verge of losing his family, his relationship with his wife, the relationship with the kids almost nonexistent.
[time=1439] His personal sphere, his relationships, all of it, absolutely a mess.
[time=1445] And he looked at me that day and he asked for help.
[time=1449] And depending upon the situation, you know, I don't always answer those questions the same way.
[time=1453] We might come at that from several different angles that day.
[time=1457] That day, I simply asked him to get out a piece of paper and a pen.
[time=1461] And I asked him if he would be willing to write down for me.
[time=1464] I told him it would be, you know, just a simple math equation.
[time=1469] And I asked him to write down how many hours he gives each week to certain things.
[time=1478] Because we do that with our hours each week, don't we?
[time=1481] We give them.
[time=1484] We control them, right?
[time=1486] The hours that you and I get are hours that God has given for us to do with what we will.
[time=1491] And so I asked him to write down how many hours a week he was giving to.
[time=1498] And I just went down a list, business travel.
[time=1501] You can write.
[time=1502] In fact, some of you in the room may want to do this exercise as we talk our way through this.
[time=1508] I know some of you in the room today may be need to.
[time=1513] I asked this individual to write down how many hours a week he gave to business travel.
[time=1518] How many hours a week he gave to office time?
[time=1521] How many hours a week he gave to meetings, presentations, and the preparation for those meetings and presentations?
[time=1528] I asked him to write down how many hours a week he gave to business breakfasts, business lunches and business dinners and business whatever's.
[time=1539] I asked him to write down how much time in a given week he would spend on the computer, both for personal use and business priorities.
[time=1546] I asked him to write down how many hours a week he gave to his hobby in the actual enjoyment of it or in the planning for it.
[time=1554] And then I asked him to write down how many hours a week he slept.
[time=1559] And he sat there across from me, just kind of scribbling furiously, thinking, pausing at times and writing things down the piece of paper.
[time=1566] Then I asked him to go ahead and add them up.
[time=1568] Now you and I know that in a given week God gives us how many hours, 100 and what?
[time=1573] Say a louder.
[time=1575] 168 hours is what we've been given each and every week, and as this guy said across from me with his life spiraling out of control,
[time=1585] as he calculated the total, it came to 171.
[time=1590] And we hadn't even talked about God, his wife, his kids or his ministry.
[time=1600] And you might want to do that.
[time=1603] You might want to sit down with your 168 hours.
[time=1608] And you may want to go ahead and just start there.
[time=1612] And I was able to say that to him and it was a loving, warm, very productive opportunity to roll up our sleeves together.
[time=1620] And maybe for you this morning a chance to sit down and say, "Okay, God, how many hours am I going to give to him, just me and him?
[time=1629] How many hours am I going to give to my spouse?
[time=1632] Hours am I going to give to her or to him to build into, appreciate love and come alongside this one that I'm sharing my life with?
[time=1641] How many hours are you going to give your kids?" And I don't mean at the table necessarily.
[time=1646] I mean in relationship with them.
[time=1649] How many hours are you going to give to ministry?
[time=1653] For those of you that know him, for those of you that live today in a fully surrendered relationship with him, he has called you to give back to those. He has called you to invest in the body of Christ.
[time=1663] He has called you with your special, unique talent and that special, unique gift that Mitch referred to earlier.
[time=1670] He has called you to come and give yourself to ministry.
[time=1675] How about we start there?
[time=1677] And so far we haven't gotten to business travel and business lunches and computer time and hobbies.
[time=1685] Something to consider.
[time=1687] Last week we found ourselves in 1 Thessalonians 4 verses 9 to 12 and we started a message that will end today entitled The Will to Chill.
[time=1696] The Will to Chill and we saw that biblically speaking, we saw that biblically as far as the Scriptures mandate,
[time=1704] we are called to simple living, meaningful living, not fast paced, not frantic, not frenzy, not over the edge, but calm.
[time=1714] Ordered, prioritized, living, look with me again at verses 9 to 12 of 1 Thessalonians 4.
[time=1723] And in honor of God's word, would you stand with me this morning as we read this?
[time=1729] Let me read it for you, beginning with verse 9.
[time=1731] Now as to the love of the brethren, Paul writes, you have no need for anyone to write to you, for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another.
[time=1740] For indeed you do practice it toward all the brethren who are in all Macedonia, but we urge you, brethren, to excel still more.
[time=1752] And to make it your ambition to lead a quiet life and attend to your own business and work with your hands just as we commanded you so that you will behave properly toward outsiders and not be in any need.
[time=1768] Pray with me, would you Father, God as we come to the pages of Scripture this morning as we open up your word that is able to penetrate and see deep into each and every life in this room, God I pray that we would be receptive to it.
[time=1783] God, whoever we are, wherever we've been, whatever part of the journey we find ourselves on this morning, that we would be humble enough and willing enough and teachable enough this morning to open our hearts and our minds to what you would have.
[time=1796] God, what we do with these lives that you've given us. God, what we do with these precious hours and minutes and moments each day, it means something.
[time=1807] And so many people are impacted by it.
[time=1812] God, paint a picture this morning so very clear for each of us to see and give us the courage, Father, give us the courage and strength to pursue that with your help and the help of others so that you can be glorified so that we can be who you've called us and made us to be.
[time=1831] In your son's name we pray. Amen. You can be seated.
[time=1835] So we asked the question last week, do you want to honor God? I mean, do you really want to honor Him? And do you really want to simplify? Are you interested in a more meaningful life?
[time=1846] Well, as the passage progressed and as we made our way through those first few verses beginning at verse 9, we saw that first of all, and you can write this down if you want to catch up on your notes from last week if you weren't here, we saw and I'll just review these first two briefly.
[time=1859] We saw first of all that a more meaningful life, a simplified life, a God-honoring life begins by loving more.
[time=1866] That's right, love more.
[time=1869] The point made here was really clear, busy, overextended, too many plates spinning up in the air, going in too many different directions.
[time=1882] Busy, overextended, time-strapped people don't love very well.
[time=1893] And we probably just need to chew on that just for a second here this morning.
[time=1899] Busy, overextended, frantic pace.
[time=1906] Go in here, go in there, always, always on the edge, pushing it to the limit, fast lane living.
[time=1916] Those people, and if you want to argue it with me, I'll argue it with you back, because we're right on this one.
[time=1925] You don't love very well.
[time=1929] You can't, the investment of love, the offering of a life takes time.
[time=1939] It takes time.
[time=1941] The God-honoring life is a life first and foremost marked by efforts to love still more.
[time=1947] You see it there at the end of verse 10, excel.
[time=1950] I know you've been loving, I know you've been making an effort, Paul says, excel still more.
[time=1957] Whatever it is, people.
[time=1959] Whatever it is you're doing with your lives, if really loving others, if really loving God, if really loving your spouse, if really loving your kids, isn't the first and foremost priority in your 168 hours, you're done.
[time=1978] You're heading for a wall and you'll hit it and it won't be pretty and lives will be affected.
[time=1988] I would encourage you today to go home and get out a piece of paper and sit down with a pen or a pencil and just begin to do a little self-assessment with your 168 hours and start with what you need to start with.
[time=2006] And then see what you've got left over.
[time=2009] You know what?
[time=2011] I'll bet you anything that if you sit down with a piece of paper and you begin to write down how many hours you need to spend with him each week, how many hours you need him meaning capital H, him.
[time=2023] If you begin to write down how many hours you need to spend with him or her, your spouse, if you begin to write down how many hours each week you should spend with investing and playing with, reading to prank, you know,
[time=2035] doing whatever it is you need to do with your children.
[time=2038] If you begin to write down how many hours a week you should give to ministry as you come alongside others and offer your gifts and your talents.
[time=2047] I bet you anything that when all of that's said and done, he's going to be willing and he's going to be ready and I know he's able to take whatever's left and allow you to go and do whatever else he's called you to do.
[time=2061] Whatever job you have, whatever means of provision he's given you, whatever else there is in your life, it'll be enough.
[time=2067] He'll take care of that.
[time=2069] On paper it might not look like, but he will.
[time=2073] But see, we've so abused that equation for so long.
[time=2076] We look at that and go, "I can't get it all done." If I give this to him and this to him and her and this to now, I bet he could do an amazing thing in your schedule.
[time=2089] I bet he could do an amazing work in your heart if you'd given the opportunity.
[time=2095] Secondly, we saw that simple living, God honoring, meaningful living comes as a result of being still.
[time=2102] Write that down.
[time=2103] Being still.
[time=2105] Simply stated, we're to ambitiously, zealously pursue peace and tranquility.
[time=2112] Look at 1 Thessalonians 4, 11 is where we saw this, the first part of verse 11.
[time=2117] And to make it your ambition, to lead a quiet life, stop right there, to make it your ambition, to lead a quiet life.
[time=2131] This basically addressed two different arenas of peaceful living, just write these two things down.
[time=2138] This speaks to number one, personal peace.
[time=2142] For some of you in the room this morning, and I have to admit, there were years and years of my life where I was like this.
[time=2148] In the last couple, two, three years it has radically changed, and I am forever grateful that he radically changed this in me.
[time=2155] Some of us who just have a really hard time with quiet.
[time=2162] There's something about the way we're wired.
[time=2165] We feel like we need the activity, we need the noise, we need the radio, we need the CD, we need people.
[time=2174] And there's a part of that that's good because there's a part of that.
[time=2177] That's how we're wired.
[time=2178] We're people, people.
[time=2180] We're people of activity.
[time=2182] That's okay, but you know what, no matter how you're wired, and I'm so glad I learned this, there are times we need to just be quiet.
[time=2192] Times of personal peace.
[time=2194] You write down Psalm 46.
[time=2196] Psalm 46, I believe it's verse 10.
[time=2199] It says cease striving.
[time=2203] To catch that, that phrase there in the Hebrew, it just means stop.
[time=2209] No, no, no, don't do that, and don't, no, stop, just stop.
[time=2214] It's like a dinner at the dinner table sometimes, you know, after about 20 minutes of absolute bedlam.
[time=2220] It's just stop, put your hands on your lap, don't talk.
[time=2225] And then they sit there and look at me and then I just eat because I just want to eat and quiet, you know?
[time=2231] But sometimes spiritually you just need to stop.
[time=2233] Just stop.
[time=2235] Get up, set the alarm.
[time=2238] Go get a cup of coffee.
[time=2240] Go sit in a corner.
[time=2242] Bring the word and be quiet.
[time=2246] Now part of this be still and no.
[time=2249] Part of what's implied there is you and I interacting with this.
[time=2253] You and I reading this.
[time=2255] You and I memorizing this.
[time=2256] You and I being quiet with this.
[time=2259] So you might make some noise like, you know, like I do in the early morning hours as I'm reading and thinking and praying.
[time=2265] But there is a time even in that setting where I'm just quiet.
[time=2269] And I just listen.
[time=2271] And you need to do that.
[time=2273] I don't care who you are, how old you are, how young you are.
[time=2281] Do it.
[time=2282] See striving Psalm 46 says, "Be still and know that I am God."
[time=2288] When do you get up each day?
[time=2290] When do you need to get up?
[time=2292] Or what time in your day do you need to set aside to have that kind of time with him?
[time=2297] Times of personal peace.
[time=2298] Here's the second take on that concept.
[time=2301] Times of relational peace.
[time=2303] And we talked about this last week, Romans 12.
[time=2305] As far as it depends on you, God's word is so very clear.
[time=2308] Be it peace with all men.
[time=2310] I don't care what they've done.
[time=2312] I don't care how badly they've hurt you.
[time=2315] You need to with the help of the Holy Spirit and maybe a good friend.
[time=2319] Do whatever you have to do to forgive, offer reconciliation and be at peace.
[time=2325] God's word says so as far as it depends on you.
[time=2328] Be at peace.
[time=2329] Don't be at strife.
[time=2330] Don't be at enemy.
[time=2331] Don't be at odds.
[time=2332] Don't be against.
[time=2334] God's word says you and I are to be a peaceful, quiet, tranquil people who
[time=2341] ambitiously pursue a quiet life.
[time=2346] You want to simplify your life?
[time=2349] Love more.
[time=2350] Be still more.
[time=2351] And then we got just barely.
[time=2352] We got to this third point last week and we'll finish up here today.
[time=2355] Gossip less.
[time=2359] Look at the next part of verse 11 in 1 Thessalonians 4.
[time=2363] And to make it your ambition to lead a quiet life.
[time=2366] And attend to your own business.
[time=2371] This one's real straightforward.
[time=2374] It's really, really clear.
[time=2376] Any sentence or question that begins with, hey, did you hear what happened to?
[time=2383] Or any sentence or question, any conversation that might begin with, hey, keep this between you and me, but what I heard was.
[time=2394] See any question or any sentence, any conversation that you and I might have that would begin with, I'm not sure.
[time=2402] But what I heard him say was, see, basically these things should never be uttered.
[time=2414] Bottom line, you and I have no business.
[time=2418] Having those words proceed from our mouths as it would relate to others.
[time=2426] That's where it's really clear, stay out of each other's business.
[time=2432] Stay out of each other's business.
[time=2434] You know what?
[time=2435] Get into my business if I'm in sin.
[time=2437] If I'm doing something I shouldn't do, if I'm conducting myself in a way I should not, if there's a sinful attitude that I'm harboring.
[time=2444] If there's things that you see in me, get in my business.
[time=2447] I need you in my business then.
[time=2450] Come and talk to me.
[time=2451] Come and lovingly confront me.
[time=2452] And I will you.
[time=2455] Even in that, you know what?
[time=2456] Be so very careful.
[time=2458] And when I do confide in you, honor that.
[time=2461] And when someone else confides in you, honor that and keep your mouth closed.
[time=2467] And don't ever talk about other people in a negative fashion.
[time=2472] Why would we do that?
[time=2473] What is it about us that at times, once so desperately, to in some way kind of
[time=2479] level the ground?
[time=2480] Why do we sometimes, with real evil?
[time=2482] I mean, we don't want to call it that, but it is that.
[time=2485] What is it about us sometimes?
[time=2486] We just want to bring some people down.
[time=2492] Well, it's sin.
[time=2494] It's pride.
[time=2495] It's arrogance.
[time=2500] If they wanted you to know about the crisis in their life, they would have told you.
[time=2504] And if they haven't, you must not need to know.
[time=2509] And you don't have to be in every loop.
[time=2511] You don't have to be in the know on every situation.
[time=2518] And by all means, he says to you and he says to me, keep your mouth closed.
[time=2523] Look at Proverbs 29.
[time=2525] You can look on the screen or you can turn there, write it down.
[time=2528] What a, what a poignant, powerful indictment and warning.
[time=2532] Proverbs 29, 20 gives us.
[time=2534] Do you see a man hasty in his words?
[time=2542] There is more hope for a fool than for him.
[time=2547] And I don't know if you know.
[time=2549] I mean, I think most of you might.
[time=2550] The Bible is really clear about the future of a fool.
[time=2553] The Bible is really clear about where a fool stands in the eyes of God.
[time=2557] It's not a good place to be.
[time=2559] And this says that the person, the woman or the man who opens his or her mouth too quickly, worse than a fool.
[time=2567] There's more hope for a fool than for a woman or a man who can't keep his or her mouth closed.
[time=2574] And I know what it's like.
[time=2576] I've, I've been at, and sometimes it's so very confusing and sometimes it's not really at all.
[time=2581] But I've been there.
[time=2582] I've been at the party.
[time=2583] I've been at the gathering.
[time=2584] I've been at the booth in the restaurant.
[time=2586] I've been there in the crowd of friends and, and sometimes because we want to be noticed, and sometimes because we want to be viewed a certain way.
[time=2593] Sometimes because of our pride, we just feel like we've got to just say something.
[time=2596] So we just start talking.
[time=2599] It just starts coming out.
[time=2601] Things that shouldn't come out.
[time=2606] And he says that's not good.
[time=2609] That's beyond foolishness.
[time=2614] So pray, be quiet, keep to yourself, live peacefully.
[time=2624] Attend to your own business.
[time=2626] As you read that, as you study that phrase in the Greek, again, there are two basic components to this phrase.
[time=2632] One speaks to this issue of meddling and gossiping.
[time=2635] Another part of the phrase speaks to gives a very clear directive.
[time=2639] And the very clear directive is found right there in the phrase.
[time=2643] And I don't want to ignore it.
[time=2644] I want to make sure you see it.
[time=2646] The very clear and very important directive is in the vernacular of our day.
[time=2651] Just do your job.
[time=2654] Attend to your own business.
[time=2656] What is it that God has in the midst of all that's going on around you?
[time=2661] In the midst of all that's happening around you.
[time=2663] What is it that you've been called to do?
[time=2667] Are you a mom?
[time=2668] Are you a business woman?
[time=2669] Are you a, are you a father?
[time=2671] Are you a dad?
[time=2672] I mean, just do what you're called to do.
[time=2676] And do it well.
[time=2679] And keep to yourself.
[time=2681] And live a quiet life.
[time=2684] And whatever you're calling, whatever your profession, whatever it is that he's given you to do, just do your job.
[time=2691] Why is it that some have to know everything about everyone?
[time=2697] Problems at the office, stay out of it.
[time=2702] I'll say it again.
[time=2703] Problems at the office, stay out of it.
[time=2706] If they need you in it, they'll ask.
[time=2709] Otherwise, just do your job and do it well.
[time=2714] Problems in a friend's marriage.
[time=2718] Pray.
[time=2720] Pray privately.
[time=2722] Don't make it a prayer request at an adjacent meeting.
[time=2727] Problems in a friend's marriage.
[time=2729] Pray.
[time=2730] Get on your knees in the morning.
[time=2731] Get on your knees at night.
[time=2732] Don't talk about it.
[time=2733] Don't insinuate about it.
[time=2735] Don't spread.
[time=2736] Just get on your knees and privately pray.
[time=2739] And if there's anything you can do to come alongside that struggling spouse, do it.
[time=2743] And do it quietly.
[time=2744] And do it humbly.
[time=2745] And do it faithfully.
[time=2748] Problems with another family's kids.
[time=2751] This one, this one I see too much of.
[time=2754] And you know what, to be honest with you, sometimes I see it too much in me.
[time=2757] What is it about us?
[time=2760] It's kind of a sick thing where sometimes with the family deal, we can almost see, like we can see a family over here and a kid or two maybe making some bad choices and it might even be kind of ugly.
[time=2773] And there's something about that that we kind of take hold of and we turn it and we kind of make it, turn it and twist it and use it to kind of make us look better.
[time=2785] Does that make any sense?
[time=2787] Why would we do that with our families?
[time=2790] Why would we do that with a body of believers that God has called to be unified?
[time=2796] Jesus said in John 17, I mean it was almost over, he's praying that high priestly prayer his life is about to come to an end and he prays for unity that we would be one.
[time=2807] And why would we take the decisions and the unfortunate circumstances of another and even a family and in any way try to articulate stuff or harbor attitudes or spread things that would...
[time=2825] Don't do it.
[time=2828] Go see how you can help.
[time=2831] Go offer an active service, get on your knees privately and pray.
[time=2836] Be kind.
[time=2838] Be available.
[time=2841] Attend to your own business.
[time=2844] Be careful with your mouth and do your job well.
[time=2849] And lastly, love more, be still more, gossip less and then lastly our fourth point as we see the passage come to an end.
[time=2858] Be responsible.
[time=2860] Be responsible versus 11 and 12, last part of 11.
[time=2864] 11 started with and to make it your ambition, delete a quiet life and attend to your own business and work with your hands.
[time=2872] Phrase here refers to employment and work with your hands just as we commanded you so that you will behave properly toward outsiders and not be in any need.
[time=2884] Obviously as Paul gets the report from Timothy on what was taking place in Thessalonica, obviously he had become aware of some who had grown lazy.
[time=2897] And I don't know all of you, I don't know if there are some in the room today who have grown lazy.
[time=2903] I don't know if there are some here in the room who have stopped providing.
[time=2911] But I tell you what, God's Word has something really, really clear to say to you this morning.
[time=2919] Paul obviously knew of some who had grown lazy. Some had likely convinced themselves that Christ's return was eminent and so they had concluded that their jobs were really useless.
[time=2931] Their labor and the provision that came with it was all of a sudden not that important but Paul says and no uncertain terms get back to work.
[time=2941] Work hard, work well. He reminds Timothy later of this very thing, go over just a couple of books to 1 Timothy 5 verse 8.
[time=2951] You go past 2 Thessalonians, go to 1 Timothy 5, 8. Paul speaks to this very issue and he says it in no uncertain terms.
[time=2960] I mean God's Word here is really, really clear and very penetrating. It says in verse 8 of 1 Timothy 5, but if anyone does not provide for his own.
[time=2973] And some have asked me what that word provide means and I tell them provide.
[time=2981] It means provide. Everybody clear on that? It means provide. Whatever the need is, provide.
[time=2992] Yeah, provide. For whatever the need is, anyone who doesn't provide for his own and especially for those of his household, see in those days there would have maybe have been the family we know in that day lived together.
[time=3009] They were much closer than we are today. They oftentimes wouldn't move far away.
[time=3013] So those who I got the opportunity to provide for that was a pretty big group but especially he now brings specific recognition to my household, to my spouse and to my children and all that they might need.
[time=3028] But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.
[time=3042] Okay, you're adjusting your glasses right now, aren't you? You're going, wait a minute. That didn't just say what I think it said.
[time=3048] Now you know what? It did. It said it. You are worse than an unbeliever.
[time=3058] You have denied the faith in essence. If you think, you cannot provide for those that God has given you to care for.
[time=3069] There is no greater act of selfishness. Now obviously there are situations where physically and mentally some can't, we understand that.
[time=3085] He's not speaking to those. He's obviously speaking to those who could, what, provide.
[time=3092] He said the same thing to the church at Thessalonica in his second letter to them. He addressed the same issue. Just go back a page or two. Go to 2 Thessalonians 3.
[time=3102] 2 Thessalonians 3, 10, 11 and 12. He speaks to the very same issue. Obviously some had grown undisciplined. Obviously some had grown lazy.
[time=3112] Some were not giving themselves to their employment in the way that God had designed and Paul reminds them in chapter 3 verse 10.
[time=3120] For even when we were with you, we used to give you this order. If anyone is not willing to work, then he is not to eat either.
[time=3129] For we hear that some among you are leading an undisciplined life doing no work at all but acting like busy bodies.
[time=3137] There's that mind your own business thing. See it? Not being disciplined, doing no work at all but acting like busy bodies.
[time=3147] Now such persons we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to work in quiet, here we go again, in quiet fashion and eat their own bread.
[time=3167] I don't know what your circumstance entails. I'm not sure why it is you're not providing.
[time=3173] But if you're here this morning and that's you, my hope and my prayers that you're listening to the Scriptures, not to me.
[time=3181] And that you would in your heart sense today how very important it is that you would give yourself to this.
[time=3188] It's a hard lesson to learn but one you've got to learn. And you know what? If we can help, I can't guarantee you a job tomorrow.
[time=3196] I don't know what it is exactly. We can help you discover but I'll tell you what, we're the body of Christ.
[time=3202] And our opportunity here is to walk through life together. And if you need some help and you want to work at it and you want to give yourself to that pursuit and you need the assistant, let us know.
[time=3212] Let somebody know who you know cares. Let us do our best to come alongside you. But you know what? You have got to, to quote Scripture, be willing to lead a disciplined life and do everything within your power.
[time=3224] And you know what? At some point we get to this point where I don't care what you were trained for.
[time=3232] I hear that sometime. I'm overqualified. I'm trained to do this and there aren't any opportunity. You know what? Go get a job.
[time=3243] Go get a job. I can take you right now to the corner of Maple Crest and Stellhorn. I'll have you a job in 30 minutes.
[time=3251] Get a job. Provide. Do everything within your power.
[time=3257] And if you need help, we'll walk down that road with you. This is not a slap on the wrist. I hope it's a loving reminder of what God's Word says.
[time=3267] Love more people. Be still more. Mind your own business. Talk less. Work hard. Have a job. Give yourself to it.
[time=3282] And here's the conclusion. I've been waiting for two weeks to get here and we're out of time. So I'm going to just say it quick.
[time=3288] But this is so cool. I absolutely love the way this thing ends. Here, I closed it too soon. How does it end? Look with me. This is amazing.
[time=3297] I love how he does this because, yes, this is about honoring God. That's true. But look at the application Paul gives it.
[time=3304] He goes through all that we just went through. And says in verse 12, "So that," why? "so that you can look," no, listen, "so that you will behave properly toward outsiders and not be in any need."
[time=3317] See, here's the tragedy of the guy I met with at the beginning of this message when I told you about his 171 hours.
[time=3325] Here's the tragedy of what so many of us who claim to be Christ followers, here's the tragedy of what we do.
[time=3333] This guy's life, professing Christ follower, was absolutely in the tank. I mean, it was out of control. It was spiraling toward absolute destruction.
[time=3345] And everybody in his family, and everybody at his job, and everybody in his neighborhood knew it.
[time=3352] And they, the on-looking world, see, they've been told for years, people, that we've got answers.
[time=3358] They've been told in no uncertain terms that these Christ followers have something special that we've been given in a relationship with Christ, a way to go through life in a way that makes sense.
[time=3371] We've told them there's hope in relationship with Him. We've told them there's promise and there's victory and there's life to be lived and look at us.
[time=3386] The moral of this passage is, "Hey, people, love more. Be still. Mind your own business and work hard because they're looking.
[time=3396] They're watching. And we have an opportunity to live life in a way, to love Him, to love our family, to give ourselves to what really matters.
[time=3406] We have this chance to live life in a way where an on-looking world can look in and go, "Oh, my goodness. It's really true.
[time=3416] There's something really unique there. There's something really special there."
[time=3423] And you and I would know that something unique, that something special is in us.
[time=3427] It's the power of God. It's the Spirit of God. It's the Word of God.
[time=3431] And our efforts to, with His help, live that out in a way that honors Him and others, and that is unique.
[time=3438] Fast paced, fast lane living, absolutely over the edge. There's nothing attractive about that at all.
[time=3445] They look at that and they smirk.
[time=3449] Whatever changes you need to make, whatever help you might need, let us know. Let a good friend know. Let your small group know. Let your class know.
[time=3460] But I would invite you this morning to consider these last two weeks, the will to chill, the will to just relax and live life, the way God has called us to, and if we can help, let us know.
[time=3473] Would you stand? Let's close this morning in a word of prayer.
[time=3481] Father, we come before you this morning, so many of us in the room today convicted and reminded of our tendency to treat this life, these hours, God that you've given us irresponsibly.
[time=3496] And God, I pray that you'd give each of us the courage and pray, God, that you would give each of us humble hearts to make whatever changes need to be made.
[time=3505] I wish we could just remain here for another hour and hear stories of those whose lives have been transformed. They're here. I know it. I see their faces in this room this morning.
[time=3515] And their lives have been transformed. Their families' lives have been transformed because of their willingness to slow down.
[time=3524] And God, I pray that you would do a work in us along those lines.
[time=3529] Thank you so much for the privilege of being together. We pray, God, that it's been pleasing to you, and if it's your will, you bring us back together soon. In your son's name, we pray. Amen.
