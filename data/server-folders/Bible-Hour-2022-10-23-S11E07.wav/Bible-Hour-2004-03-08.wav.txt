[time=953] That sure was a delicious meatloaf.
[time=955] Wow, that was good.
[time=957] That twirl of cheese in the center was a nice touch.
[time=960] You are a magician.
[time=962] Oh, my Jan.
[time=964] She's a cheese wiz, isn't she?
[time=966] Oh, thank you, thank you.
[time=967] You are too kind.
[time=968] I'm just so tickled that you all enjoyed it so very much.
[time=971] Yeah, we really did, Jan, but I'm not much of a cook like you are.
[time=975] I wish I had more time to devote to my culinary skills.
[time=978] Oh, now don't get down on yourself, Jean.
[time=980] They couldn't get by at the toll booth without you.
[time=983] That's right, Jean.
[time=984] Nobody keeps traffic moving like you do.
[time=986] Oh, honestly, honey.
[time=987] Yeah.
[time=988] All right.
[time=989] Well, big brother.
[time=990] Anything good on the tube tonight?
[time=991] Well, I don't know.
[time=992] Let's take a look, Jean.
[time=993] Okay.
[time=995] Oh, well, there's the history of disco.
[time=998] Oh, I love disco.
[time=1002] Oh, that's the way.
[time=1003] Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[time=1004] We got the Brady Bunch, the Brady Bunch marathon on Amy.
[time=1007] Oh, my gosh, I love the Brady Bunch.
[time=1008] I have such a crush on Brady.
[time=1010] Oh, my gosh.
[time=1011] I mean, I used to have a crush on Amy.
[time=1012] He was so very, very precious, wasn't he?
[time=1014] Oh, my gosh.
[time=1016] We love disco.
[time=1017] Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[time=1018] Have either one of you ever seen the movie "Armer Geddon" with Bruce Willis?
[time=1021] One of my favorites.
[time=1022] Oh, really?
[time=1023] Well, it's going to be on HBO in, oh, ten minutes and thirty-seven seconds.
[time=1027] Oh, there you go.
[time=1028] You know, I don't think we ever did see it, but I heard it was good.
[time=1031] What do you think, honey?
[time=1032] Should we watch it?
[time=1033] Well, it's a real toss-up between that and the history of disco, but let's watch "Armer Geddon." Okay.
[time=1040] Okay.
[time=1041] "Armer Geddon" it is.
[time=1042] It seems like a pretty happy movie after such a fun day, but what the hey, if you guys want to watch a movie about the end of the world, I guess I'm in.
[time=1049] Sure.
[time=1050] Is that what "Armer Geddon" means, the end of the world?
[time=1052] "Armer Geddon" is actually a Greek word that, well, it's made up of two Greek words.
[time=1056] First "Armer," which means goodbye, and second "Geddon," which means cruel world.
[time=1064] So translated into English, it's Greek for goodbye cruel world.
[time=1067] Wow.
[time=1068] How about that?
[time=1069] Isn't that impressive?
[time=1071] Dan, I had no idea your little brother was so smart.
[time=1073] Oh, that Dino, he got very high marks in school.
[time=1075] I guess so.
[time=1076] That's why he's the best librarian.
[time=1077] Head librarian.
[time=1078] Yeah, head librarian.
[time=1079] Head librarian.
[time=1080] Tell my veteran.
[time=1081] Yeah.
[time=1082] But I thought "Armer Geddon" was a Bible word.
[time=1084] You two go to church, don't you?
[time=1085] Don't you?
[time=1086] Isn't it a Bible word?
[time=1087] I sure do.
[time=1089] I think it is.
[time=1090] But there, it's called the rupture.
[time=1092] That's right.
[time=1093] Oh, honey.
[time=1094] No.
[time=1095] No, no, no.
[time=1096] I think you mean the rapture.
[time=1097] Rapture, yeah.
[time=1098] Oh, what did I say?
[time=1099] You said rupture.
[time=1100] I did.
[time=1101] But it was cute though.
[time=1102] Very cute.
[time=1103] Well, there you go.
[time=1104] Well, why don't you guys go grab your Bible and look it up.
[time=1105] Yeah, you've got to have a Bible when you go to church, don't you?
[time=1108] Sure.
[time=1109] You betcha.
[time=1110] Yeah, we do.
[time=1111] We got a Bible, don't we, honey?
[time=1112] That's right.
[time=1113] B-I-B-L-E.
[time=1114] Now that, that's the book for me.
[time=1117] For us.
[time=1118] Oh, honestly.
[time=1119] That should be the book for us.
[time=1121] We'll talk about it later.
[time=1124] Okay, honey.
[time=1125] I think you need to look in the book of relativity.
[time=1128] Relativity.
[time=1129] That's where the end of the world is discussed.
[time=1131] Oh, no, honey.
[time=1132] I think it's in the back of the Bible.
[time=1134] Oh, the back.
[time=1135] End of the world, back of the Bible.
[time=1136] Oh, yeah.
[time=1137] I knew that.
[time=1139] Yeah.
[time=1140] Oh, honey.
[time=1141] We've got to get a new Bible.
[time=1142] Oh, yeah.
[time=1143] They sure are.
[time=1144] Look at that.
[time=1145] What's she?
[time=1146] Rapsher.
[time=1149] They had Rapsher back in five old times.
[time=1152] Well, that's my favorite type of, our favorite style of music.
[time=1155] Let's show them.
[time=1156] Let's do it.
[time=1157] Let's show them.
[time=1158] Rapsher.
[time=1159] All right.
[time=1160] Stop.
[time=1161] Collaborate and listen.
[time=1162] I spent with the brand new music.
[time=1164] This is so bad.
[time=1165] Rapsher.
[time=1166] Little brother.
[time=1167] It's not rap music.
[time=1168] Rapsher.
[time=1169] Yeah.
[time=1170] That's when God.
[time=1171] Sucks us out of the fields and takes us up to heaven.
[time=1174] We're sucked.
[time=1175] What?
[time=1176] Right out of the field.
[time=1180] Yes.
[time=1181] You see, there are two men in the field, and one is sucked up, and the other is left behind
[time=1187] to do all the work.
[time=1188] One down.
[time=1189] Now, you see, the one that's left behind, he gets angry because he's left all alone to do all the work, angry, angry little pharma.
[time=1195] Okay.
[time=1196] Wait.
[time=1197] Who gets sucked out of the field?
[time=1198] And what if I'm in my toe booth and not in a field?
[time=1200] Are they going to make an announcement that everyone should go to a field?
[time=1204] I'm confused.
[time=1205] I don't think an announcement, necessarily, but there will be trumpet music.
[time=1210] Yeah.
[time=1211] Yes.
[time=1214] Right here.
[time=1215] Right here, as a matter of fact.
[time=1216] Yeah.
[time=1217] Oh, and I looked and I heard an eagle flying in mid-heaven, saying with a loud voice, whoa, whoa, whoa, to those who dwell on the earth because of the remaining blast of the trumpet, of the three angels who are about to sound.
[time=1229] There you go.
[time=1230] As well.
[time=1232] That was clear.
[time=1233] I didn't understand a word of what you just said.
[time=1235] I'm getting stressed out.
[time=1236] Okay.
[time=1237] All I want to know is how are we going to know when it's the end of the world?
[time=1240] Huh?
[time=1241] Wow.
[time=1242] Just tell me that there will be earthquakes, earthquakes, floods, and wars, lots of wars,
[time=1250] and rumors of wars, gas, gossipy sort of rumors, and rumors of weapons of masters.
[time=1256] Yes.
[time=1257] And then, horrible times, they will be simply awful.
[time=1260] You'll have to be sure to fill your pantry with lots of batteries and spam.
[time=1263] Oh, yes.
[time=1264] Just like we did for Y2K.
[time=1266] Okay.
[time=1267] So God wants us to buy batteries and spam.
[time=1269] You got that?
[time=1270] Batteries and spam.
[time=1271] And there will be another sign.
[time=1273] There will be a thousand year rain here.
[time=1277] Yeah.
[time=1278] That's right.
[time=1279] It's going to rain for about two years.
[time=1280] Rain for a thousand years.
[time=1281] Wait a minute.
[time=1283] Didn't that already happen in that Noah fella?
[time=1284] He was the only one to survive.
[time=1285] Good.
[time=1286] That's right.
[time=1287] That's why Dan and I are saving our nickels and dimes for a boat.
[time=1290] That's right.
[time=1291] We want to be ready.
[time=1292] Maybe God wants us to save up for a boat too.
[time=1294] What do you think?
[time=1295] Well, it's B.M.
[time=1296] Batteries, boats.
[time=1297] B.M.
[time=1298] Batteries.
[time=1299] Got it.
[time=1300] Well, it sure beats treading water for a thousand years.
[time=1301] That's right.
[time=1302] Yeah.
[time=1303] My swimming days are long past, long past.
[time=1304] Yeah.
[time=1305] Oh, and one more thing, we'll be able to see the seals from the bones.
[time=1309] Seal.
[time=1310] God says there will be seven seals.
[time=1312] That's right.
[time=1313] Yeah.
[time=1314] I love the seals.
[time=1315] We're going to do the trick where they balance the beach ball on their nose and then.
[time=1320] Yeah.
[time=1321] This is all very confusing to me and I'm starting to stress.
[time=1324] God has got to have a better plan for us than this, doesn't he?
[time=1329] Well.
[time=1330] Well, we're in a series on 1st Thessalonians and our topic today.
[time=1337] Four questions about the dead that will change the living.
[time=1339] How many people here raise your hand if you've lost someone close to you?
[time=1344] To death.
[time=1345] Keep them up.
[time=1347] Okay.
[time=1349] Me too.
[time=1350] It was May 17th, 1996 and I shared part of the story with you before.
[time=1358] I lost one of my best friends, Scott Brayton, in a tragic racing accident.
[time=1362] He had just won back to back pole positions at the Indy 500 and we used to talk about
[time=1368] every morning, but every other morning and there was no warning.
[time=1372] He was out test driving a car after he'd won the pole position and driven about 20 laps
[time=1378] and a faulty tire put him in at G-forces too high and it turned to the wall it turned
[time=1385] to for the human body to withstand and he died.
[time=1390] And I began from there a pursuit of some questions I had and there are basically four
[time=1399] questions and the four questions we're going to address today and what's very interesting is they must have been very similar to the same four questions that the Thessalonians
[time=1408] must have asked through Timothy to Paul because you'll see the movements of his communication
[time=1415] and it looks like he's answering these four questions.
[time=1417] Well, you know that I grew up in the church and that kind of had a big day of reckoning
[time=1429] and got on my knees on July 1st, 1992 and said, "God, I don't know what I'm saying but I want to make my business a ministry.
[time=1436] I've been holding that back from you and I don't know what that'll be.
[time=1440] Let's just go." Well, if you've grown up in the church or whenever you surrender your life to Christ,
[time=1447] you have a tendency, see this is the fundamental problem, period.
[time=1452] I had a professor in college who called it F-No Centrism.
[time=1455] I think that's when a group does it or a church does it oftentimes or egocentrism, it's when I say the whole world revolves around me and so that's what I bring to God, you know,
[time=1465] and if I surrender to Christ, let's call it his story, story synonymous for life, I have
[time=1476] a tendency to focus my whole life then on this, this connection.
[time=1485] And if the arrows are going to represent the intention of my heart, the arrows really,
[time=1491] it's all about what's in it for me.
[time=1495] That's just our fallen nature.
[time=1498] Well people outside the church have the same problem, my story, the world revolves around
[time=1505] me, and they get really, really good at this connection, E.I., Dr. Cruz.
[time=1522] And they get real, they get really good outside the church on this connection.
[time=1527] They know how to get things done and how to work with people, but again, the reality of the intention of their heart is that the arrows are always going back to my story.
[time=1538] What's in it for me?
[time=1540] What we're going to do is move through this topic today and through this scripture, and we're going to answer four questions about the dead that changed my living.
[time=1550] Four questions about the dead that I think Paul answers to change the Thessalonians living.
[time=1556] Four questions about the dead that I think the answers will change our living, and it's
[time=1562] about a different connection.
[time=1564] And so if you could please stand, Steve is going to read the passage for us.
[time=1570] First Thessalonians 4, 13 through 5, 11.
[time=1574] Brothers, we do not want you to be ignorant about those who fall asleep or to grieve like
[time=1580] the rest of men who have no hope.
[time=1584] We believe that Jesus died and rose again, and so we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in Him.
[time=1591] According to the Lord's own word, we tell you that we who are still alive, who are left till the coming of the Lord will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep, for
[time=1602] the Lord Himself will come down from heaven with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.
[time=1614] After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will be with the Lord forever.
[time=1626] Therefore encourage each other with these words.
[time=1629] Now brothers, about times and dates, we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.
[time=1638] While people are saying peace and safety, destruction will come on them suddenly as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.
[time=1648] But you brothers are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief.
[time=1652] You are all sons of the light and sons of the day.
[time=1655] We do not belong to the night or to the darkness.
[time=1658] So then let us not be like others who are asleep, but let us be alert and self-controlled.
[time=1664] For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night.
[time=1669] But since we belong to the day, let us be self-controlled, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet.
[time=1678] For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath, but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1685] He died for us so that whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with Him.
[time=1691] Therefore, encourage one another and build each other up just as in fact you are doing.
[time=1698] I commend you and I say to you again that last sentence, you, therefore encourage one
[time=1705] another and build each other up just as in fact you are doing.
[time=1711] [AMEN] So, just real quick to apply that to get steep going, I got real concerned about this connection
[time=1720] with my friend after he passed away, you know, and the four questions, the his story and
[time=1726] their story, and the four questions that I kept asking myself were where is he?
[time=1733] So one, where are believers when they die?
[time=1736] When am I going to see him again?
[time=1737] So two, when will we see them again?
[time=1739] And three, I know there is the return of Christ, when is all that happening?
[time=1743] When does he return?
[time=1745] And then fourth, and really most importantly, and this is the whole deal today, what do I do now?
[time=1750] What do we do now?
[time=1752] And so Steve is going to address that first question.
[time=1754] Where are the believers who died?
[time=1759] In Matthew 22, he said, "It is not the God of the dead, but of the living." In 2 Corinthians 5 Paul said, "He'd prefer to be away from the body and present with the Lord." So away from the body must mean you're with the Lord.
[time=1778] To live his Christ and die as gain, Paul said, "To depart is to be with Christ."
[time=1784] He said, "Well, I think sometimes we get a little hung up in it.
[time=1793] Because we have a real difficult time dealing with no time.
[time=1802] It's real hard for us.
[time=1804] We live in time, and we're trapped in time, and to think outside of time, I think it's
[time=1811] probably impossible for us.
[time=1813] We just work at it sometimes." You notice there in the opening verses there in 1 Thessalonians 4, 13, he says, "I don't want you to be ignorant.
[time=1821] I don't want you to grieve like others who have no hope." He doesn't say, "I don't want you to grieve." He says, "I don't want you to grieve like those other people who don't have hope." I watched my mom grieve.
[time=1833] I've watched all kinds of people grieve.
[time=1835] I've grieved, and the reality is you grieve differently.
[time=1838] We all grieve differently.
[time=1840] Some people cry a lot.
[time=1843] Some people get quieter.
[time=1844] Some people don't whistle.
[time=1847] Some people get more focused on one thing than they used to.
[time=1850] People grieve all kinds of ways.
[time=1852] He says this, "Don't be ignorant, and grieve like the people that have no hope."
[time=1859] I don't know what hopeless grief would feel like because I haven't experienced that.
[time=1866] But he says, "Grieve with hope." Hope about what?
[time=1871] Well, one of the things is that we know where eventually they're going to be.
[time=1877] I may not know where they are right now.
[time=1879] I may not understand what's going on.
[time=1881] You see, it's referred to as "sleep often" in the Bible.
[time=1884] Death is referred to as "sleep very often." Jairus' daughter there in Mark chapter 5, Jairus, who was the superintendent of the synagogue,
[time=1893] he was kind of the facilities and programming director at the synagogue.
[time=1899] Jairus' daughter was ill.
[time=1900] Remember he came to Jesus and said, "Would you please come heal my daughter?" And the way there, the woman with the discharge, it took time away.
[time=1910] And she apparently died.
[time=1912] The daughter died before Jesus got there.
[time=1915] And then Jesus got there.
[time=1916] He said, "Don't worry, she's just asleep." And he raised her up.
[time=1919] Yeah.
[time=1920] I came across Beerus Sodihati, he says that word for sleep, it refers to physical death like you're talking about.
[time=1925] It is never used for the soul.
[time=1928] Yes.
[time=1929] The soul lives on.
[time=1931] Well, another time that it's used is with Lazarus and Mitchell mentioned earlier, tell that story about four, will you?
[time=1938] Four days.
[time=1939] Oh yeah.
[time=1940] Lazarus, when he raises, I mean Jesus, when he raises Lazarus from the dead, you'll see in John 11 that he waits until the fourth day.
[time=1949] And there was a belief in Judaism that the spirit and the soul hovered over the grave
[time=1956] for three days.
[time=1959] And so, I had a southern professor who said it this way, Jesus was waiting, and the way
[time=1965] they would say it, Jesus was waiting until he moved from dead to Lazarus, moved from dead to good and dead before he came.
[time=1973] And so that's why it's probably why it's the fourth day.
[time=1977] If we don't know exactly where, and you know what, some churches, some denominations have actually applied a name to the place where the dead are waiting, like their souls are there resting.
[time=1987] The Bible doesn't really teach that, I don't think.
[time=1990] But I knew this.
[time=1991] What I don't understand about it, it's because of my limitations and my stuck in time.
[time=1997] So I asked Nancy this week, Nancy has a brother that's 39 years old, well, he was 39 when he died.
[time=2003] He died about 15 years ago.
[time=2008] And he was like a dad and a brother.
[time=2011] Her dad died when she was in the womb, and her big brother helped raise her.
[time=2016] And I mean, she was so close to him that it was incredible.
[time=2019] And when he died at 39, it just, it was devastating to her and to her mom.
[time=2023] Really hard.
[time=2024] I asked Nancy the other day.
[time=2025] I said, "How do you feel about Jerry?" She said, "What do you mean?" I said, "How do you feel right now about Jerry?
[time=2030] What would you say about your relationship with Jerry now?" She said, "I feel like he's alive, but he's not here."
[time=2040] I think that sums it up.
[time=2042] They're alive, folks, but they're not here.
[time=2046] And someday, we're going to be there with them.
[time=2052] So we're believers who died, like Steve said, they're with Christ.
[time=2056] When will we see them?
[time=2058] Either when we die or when Christ returns.
[time=2066] Let's read verses 15 through 18.
[time=2068] In verse 14, he said that he brings with Christ those who fall asleep.
[time=2072] And verse 15 says, "According to the Lord's own word, we tell you that we who are still alive who are left till the coming of the Lord, and that would be us right now, will certainly not proceed those who have fallen asleep." He's already brought them with Christ.
[time=2085] "For the Lord himself will come down from heaven and with a loud command and with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first." It means they'll stand up.
[time=2096] There they are.
[time=2097] We who are still alive and are left will be caught up together.
[time=2100] Caught up together is a term used.
[time=2103] Well, let me just go on.
[time=2105] Caught up together with them in the clouds.
[time=2107] Clouds is a concept of the Spirit of God all throughout the Bible.
[time=2110] The Spirit of God, clouds are imagery for that.
[time=2113] I'm not saying that he couldn't be in the clouds, that's possible too, but that is imagery throughout the Bible for the Spirit of God.
[time=2119] To meet the Lord in the air, and so will be with the Lord forever, therefore encourage
[time=2125] each other with these words.
[time=2127] So this is an encouragement.
[time=2129] So kind of that caught up together, the concept there that's going on is officials of a city would go meet dignitaries of a visiting city outside the city gates, and then they usher them in.
[time=2140] And that's what he's saying.
[time=2141] Jesus, that's what he's saying that'll happen when Jesus returns.
[time=2145] Jesus, right this down Luke 16, Jesus tells a really cool parable to shed a little light
[time=2151] on this.
[time=2152] I think it's in verse 22 where he talks about two guys dying and they go separate directions.
[time=2156] And the guy who believed in God, he goes to the bosom of Abraham.
[time=2162] He's ushered in by angels.
[time=2165] And that's a very good point.
[time=2166] See, Abraham's there.
[time=2169] And the guy who went, he's the same guy he was when he was here.
[time=2172] That's called subjective immortality.
[time=2176] Islam would believe that, Judaism would believe that, we believe that, most other religions believe in objective immortality.
[time=2184] Subjective immortality means that I'm Mitch on the other side, Steve is Steve on the other side.
[time=2190] Objective immortality is we can be anything.
[time=2192] The Bible doesn't teach that, so we don't believe that.
[time=2195] At the amount of transfiguration when Moses and Elijah showed up with Jesus, the disciples
[time=2201] said, "Ooh, Moses and Elijah, they knew they were." Right.
[time=2206] And then in 2 Peter 2.4, it kind of tells you the south side of this thing is that it says
[time=2213] that the demons and the evil angels, they're being held for judgment.
[time=2219] And so I want to share a story.
[time=2220] I was praying about how to get this into you and how to make this applicable to your life.
[time=2228] And God brought a pastor friend in my life this past week and he told me a story and I'm going to share it with you.
[time=2235] He had just given his life to Christ about two months ago, not two months from now, but
[time=2241] when he told me the story.
[time=2242] He said, "I had given my life to Christ about two months prior." He said, "I'm not proud to say it.
[time=2246] I was a bouncer in a bar and that's all I'm going to tell you about that place." And he said, "I had a history with a guy who had come in." And he said, "He kind of sucker punched me, you know, like we saw in the hockey thing all week." And he said, "We had a big fight and we had a history of that kind of a thing.
[time=2262] This guy was trouble and apparently was in drug trafficking and all kinds of stuff." Well, the guy comes in one night and he's drunk and he's got that history and he tells my pastor friend is just, you know, just barely big and tough and he says to the bouncer,
[time=2277] the drug trafficking guy says to the bouncer, he's an old drunk, you know, he says he's coming in and the bouncer, my pastor friend says back to him, says, "You're not coming in.
[time=2285] You're drunk.
[time=2286] We're not going to let you come in." And the guy goes, "You can't tell me what to do." And he pulls out a gun.
[time=2291] Well, my pastor friend had some military training in his background.
[time=2297] He was a tough guy and part of his background that wasn't military was you now have a decision.
[time=2303] You either need to defend yourself and shoot or you're going to be shot and killed.
[time=2309] And he defended himself and he shot the guy and he goes to the ground.
[time=2314] And he says, "Mitchell, he says you're talking about that to be absent from the bodies, to be with the Lord kind of thing," right?
[time=2321] And I said, "Yeah." He says, "Well, there's another side to that." And he said, "I didn't know if he was alive or dead and I kind of kicked the gun away and I look at the guy and I see in his eyes something that's burned in my mind for the
[time=2334] rest of my life." And he said, "I saw the torment begin of hell."
[time=2341] He said, "I've never seen that before.
[time=2343] I don't ever want to see it again." And he says, "It was at that moment as a two-month-old believer in Christ that I decided, I'm going to give my life to make sure that no one, no one has to see that."
[time=2360] And so kind of what we're moving here is that my pastor friend, he's seeing life through
[time=2366] a different set of eyes.
[time=2368] He's starting to see life through this connection and we're going to, through his story connecting with their story, and so we're going to go on.
[time=2377] Well, when is Christ returning to earth?
[time=2382] When you like that to be today, some days I would, other times I'm thinking, "Just like him, I want to wait for some people to come to know him."
[time=2393] We don't know when he's coming.
[time=2396] Second Peter three nights says, "That's why he's waiting." Pardon?
[time=2400] Second Peter three nights says, "That's why he's waiting." That's all men to come to repent.
[time=2405] Absolutely.
[time=2406] In Matthew chapter 24 and Mark 13, the disciples asked Jesus, they said, "You know, what are these things going to happen?" He just said to them, "The temple, there's not one rock, was going to stand on another
[time=2418] in the temple." And they said, "When's this going to happen?" He starts describing for them.
[time=2423] He first says, "Watch, be alert," and then he starts describing for them the signs of the end of the age.
[time=2429] A lot of those, you read through those in Mark chapter 13 and Matthew 24, and you'll
[time=2435] see that many of those could have already occurred.
[time=2440] And you'll see that maybe some of those are occurring, and it's possible some of those are in the future.
[time=2445] And the people that look at the book of the Revelation and see that as future events mostly, they'll say those are out there yet.
[time=2451] And some people look at the book of the Revelation and say, "That book is about some events that have already taken place, a lot of things, and there's some things that are going on now." I know this much.
[time=2462] I'm really confident that nobody's going to tell me when.
[time=2468] I know that for sure.
[time=2469] You can study forever, and you can follow every scholar that's ever tried to do it.
[time=2474] And I know you are not going to find out.
[time=2477] You may pick a day, they may tell you it's at some certain time, but I know you're not going to get there.
[time=2482] Why do I know it?
[time=2483] Because Jesus said to the disciples at the end of that discourse in Matthew 24 and in Mark 13, in verse 36, Matthew 24 he says, "No one knows about the day or hour, not even
[time=2496] the angels in heaven, nor the Son." He said, "I don't know, but only the Father." Folks, if he doesn't know, I'm not going to spend a whole lot of time trying to figure it out by looking at the Bible and figure those dates out.
[time=2511] If he doesn't know, I'm not going to know.
[time=2515] He didn't know anyhow.
[time=2516] I don't know if he knows now.
[time=2520] Eternity Now is a book John Brandenburg gave to me, John is my good friend, and he knew
[time=2526] I'd like this book.
[time=2528] It's a book by Peter Hyatt.
[time=2529] He's a pastor out in Golden, Colorado.
[time=2533] In this book he works through the book of the Revelation, and he treats the book of the Revelation as though it was a description about us living now for the Christ that's
[time=2546] revealed in there now, and it drives me to a different behavior when I think that way.
[time=2555] I've really, really enjoyed that book, and one of the quotes that I want to just give you from that book, it's so simple, it's so simple, but it's really profound.
[time=2565] When it comes to knowing when is this going to happen, because we are trapped in time and we can't think outside of it, I think this way sometimes.
[time=2575] I think Nancy and Jerry, when they meet in heaven, her brother Jerry, I don't think he's going to go, wow, where have you been?
[time=2581] I've been waiting a long time, he's not in time.
[time=2585] It's going to be, you know, like a thousand years like a day, a day like a thousand years.
[time=2590] Twinkle little bit of an eye says, I think it's going to be like this, isn't this great?
[time=2596] It's going to be present tense, and I'm looking forward to that, and this is what Hyatt says.
[time=2604] When it happens, it'll be like this, I'll experience being with Him and I'll go, this
[time=2611] is it, I'm home, this is it, I'm home, that's powerful.
[time=2621] So the three questions we've covered so far, were believers who died with Christ, when
[time=2627] will we see them either when we die and go into eternity on that side or when Christ returns,
[time=2633] when is Christ returning to earth, God's business, God knows?
[time=2638] And so finally, and most importantly, what do we do now?
[time=2642] What do we do now?
[time=2643] Let's read verses four through eleven there.
[time=2649] But you brothers are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief.
[time=2655] You are all sons of the light and sons of the day.
[time=2658] We do not belong to the night or to the darkness, so then let us not be like others who are asleep, it's a different concept there, it's like dead in their sin kind of a thing, not
[time=2668] alert to what's going on because you contrast it, see with what comes next, but let us be alert and self-controlled.
[time=2675] So we need to be alert and self-controlled.
[time=2677] For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk at night, isn't it interesting how that's usually the way it is.
[time=2685] But since we belong to the day, let us be self-controlled.
[time=2688] Living on faith and love is a breastplate in the hope of salvation as a helmet, he uses military imagery.
[time=2694] For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath, but to receive salvation through our Lord
[time=2700] Jesus Christ, he died for us so that whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together
[time=2706] with him, that is clear.
[time=2709] Therefore encourage one another again, he says, and build each other up just as in fact
[time=2715] you are doing.
[time=2716] So what should we do now?
[time=2718] Believe in him or be surprised, believe in him if you want to write it down or be surprised,
[time=2725] because it's interesting that if you're in Christ, it's not a surprise.
[time=2728] You've been living life according to the way he's designed you to live it, okay?
[time=2734] So it's going to be great, and you believe in him or be surprised, and you believe in him, through Paul says, "Faith, love, hope, the hope of salvation, uninterrupted life
[time=2749] with him." Very important, uninterrupted life with him.
[time=2753] And so Paul comes back to faith, love, and hope.
[time=2757] Remember the vision of our church, and what Paul said, if you want to turn there, just turn your page probably to 1-3 for Sussonians 1-3, we continually remember before our God
[time=2768] and Father, your work produced by faith, your labor prompted by love, and your hope
[time=2776] that's your endurance that's inspired by hope.
[time=2779] And then he goes down there in verses 9 and 10, and remember I talked about this being a loop in how he's telling you what the letter is about, and they tell that you've turned to God from idols, that's faith, to serve the living and true God, that's love.
[time=2797] And to wait for his son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, Jesus who rescues us from the coming wrath, that's hope.
[time=2805] And what's so awesome is if you go to verse 2-11, 2-12 actually, so why?
[time=2815] So now what's that all mean?
[time=2818] Encouraging, comforting, and urging you to live lives worthy of God who calls you into
[time=2824] his kingdom and glory.
[time=2826] And so we build each other's up, we build each other up because of this.
[time=2830] And so we see life through a whole different connection, because the problem has been the world revolves around me.
[time=2838] My relationship with God, the world revolves around what he's going to do for me.
[time=2842] That church didn't feed me, I didn't like their music, I left, it all revolves around me.
[time=2849] And that's the problem.
[time=2851] In Jesus and Paul and Peter, they all say again and again through Scripture, live life.
[time=2859] Building up others in Christ, make every thought, make every choice, make every feeling, make
[time=2866] every prayer about this.
[time=2870] About this connection, I'd like you to write this down, I'd like you to make these three circles and put my story, their story, his story, like I have, and I'd like you to shade that in, because I'm going to ask you to do something with this.
[time=2884] That changed my life.
[time=2888] The answers of these four questions about the dead changed my living.
[time=2893] I'm going to make every decision, I'm going to run every feeling through a gig when somebody
[time=2899] hurts me.
[time=2900] Well, okay, did that hurt me because am I helping their relationship with God?
[time=2903] I'm going to make every choice.
[time=2907] I'm going to have all my prayers be about this.
[time=2913] Why does God do it that way when you see the Passion movie, this?
[time=2918] Thank God he does, or you and I wouldn't be in.
[time=2924] We need to change the way we see this.
[time=2927] We got to change it.
[time=2929] Paul says pericaleo, encourage each other, he said it twice now and he's saying it all
[time=2935] throughout the letter.
[time=2937] He says it, Kelly talked about it, pericaleo, pericaleo to come alongside, calleo to call
[time=2945] or to invite every single person you and I lock eyes with to this, to that.
[time=2955] Believer or nonbeliever, my grid of my heart and everything that I do is going to be run
[time=2963] through this grid, pericaleo to come alongside, calleo to call or to invite their story to
[time=2970] his story.
[time=2972] If they're a believer, that's discipleship, if they're a nonbeliever, that is evangelism
[time=2978] and all of it's worship and this radically, radically changed my life.
[time=2985] Paul says, build each other's up Ephesians 4, 29, don't let any and wholesome talk come
[time=2991] out of your mouth.
[time=2992] Don't let it be about this.
[time=2995] So the opposite of that is build each other up according to their needs in Christ Jesus.
[time=3002] Don't tear them down.
[time=3003] Your spouse, your co-workers, your children, your church, everybody you come in contact with, pericaleo, pericaleo.
[time=3013] We don't have to know the answers to the first three questions, the where, when and when.
[time=3019] We don't have to know the answers to those questions.
[time=3021] It's fun to think about, I like studying it, I like what people say about it, I like what the Bible says, it draws me into thinking about it.
[time=3028] But I don't need the answers to the where, when and when questions.
[time=3032] But you really need the answer to the what question because it's about what you do now.
[time=3037] I've flown on a couple of times lately on the way to and from places I was going obviously and I'm with a guy and there's one guy that I met that was reading mere Christianity had his headphones on.
[time=3048] And I waited for a little bit and tapped on his tray and he takes his headphones off.
[time=3054] He goes, "Yeah." He said, "Mere Christianity, good book." I said, "It's a hard book, but it's a good book." He goes, "I am a girlfriend, I'm making me read it." He bought me three more of this guy's books.
[time=3063] He said, "I went to see that movie yesterday." I said, "Oh the passion?" He goes, "Yeah." He said, "I don't care what religion you are.
[time=3071] When you go into that movie, you come out, you're going to have some questions."
[time=3078] I said, "That's really good." So he went back to his book, put his headphones back on, he's reading away and I waited for a chapter break, I was really watching him, he's two seats away.
[time=3088] Finally he got to a chapter break and he kind of looks over to the next page and I tapped on his thing again.
[time=3093] He takes his thing off.
[time=3095] I got to share the whole gospel with the guy because it was real natural to ask him what
[time=3101] he felt like before he went to see that movie, what he felt like after you saw that movie.
[time=3106] You know what he said?
[time=3107] He said, "I felt like this." I felt like he was a great man and then after the movie, I thought, "Man, I got some questions.
[time=3114] I need to read the Bible." Now that's a great response to a movie.
[time=3119] Wouldn't Mel Gibson be happy to know there are a lot of people going around and saying, "I need to read the Bible." That's probably happening.
[time=3125] Okay, got to share the whole gospel with him.
[time=3127] You know what happened?
[time=3128] I've said this to you before, row in front of us, silence.
[time=3133] The lady across the aisle from him, by the time we're done, she's over there, she's got her head over his shoulder, looking at the bridge illustration herself.
[time=3141] You know why?
[time=3142] One simple reason.
[time=3143] I am more alert today than I used to be.
[time=3147] That guy showed up.
[time=3148] I flew to South Africa for 18 hours with a guy that drank four gin and tonics in the first half hour.
[time=3154] I didn't get to share the gospel with him, it wasn't me.
[time=3160] You know, I didn't have, I was alert, but that guy's heart wasn't ready.
[time=3167] He wasn't ready for any of that.
[time=3169] He was sleeping.
[time=3171] He did sleep a long way.
[time=3172] Anyhow, the point I'm trying to make is, the time and eternity questions that we have,
[time=3178] good questions, I hope they drive you to want to be different today.
[time=3184] That's the issue.
[time=3185] You want to be different today.
[time=3186] Be on guard, watch, be alert.
[time=3190] That's the fourth point.
[time=3191] Don't be deceived.
[time=3192] Jesus says, "Don't make it about all about you." That right there, ladies and gentlemen of the church, is a life of Pericaleo.
[time=3201] Right there.
[time=3202] That's what we're called to be.
[time=3203] Paul said that early on in the letter.
[time=3205] I want to close with this.
[time=3206] If you look at John 11, 25 and 26, Jesus just makes us really, really clear.
[time=3212] If you're really into this, you might want to jot down John 5, 24 and John 851.
[time=3218] Jesus is very clear in his preaching and teaching on this.
[time=3222] Jesus says to Martha, who usually gets a bum rap, but she's the one who runs out to him at this point.
[time=3226] Martha says, "I am the resurrection and the life." Hence, Paul 172 times in his letter says, "In Christ." That's what full surrender is.
[time=3238] "I am the resurrection and the life.
[time=3241] He who believes in me will live even though he dies." It's pretty clear in it.
[time=3246] Whoever lives and believes in me will never die.
[time=3251] That's how it is.
[time=3255] And I want to show you a life of Pericaleo, another one.
[time=3260] I had the opportunity this week to accidentally bump into somebody.
[time=3264] I think it was a divine appointment and it was Brian Marshall.
[time=3268] We've been praying for him at Common Ground.
[time=3269] Brian has two months to live.
[time=3273] He struggled for a few years with cancer and it's at the end.
[time=3277] And I said, "Brian, I've been praying for you and I just want to ask you some questions." And Ed said, "Well, I'm going to ask him some questions.
[time=3285] We're shooting it on film." I said, "What are you doing?" He says, "I'm doing my eulogy." I said, "Are you kidding me?" And he laughed.
[time=3291] He didn't want me to be uncomfortable.
[time=3293] And so Ed said I could stay and watch.
[time=3294] So I watched and Ed asked me when Ed was done with his question and says, "Mitch, I got any questions for him." I said, "I sure do." I want to know with a two-month warning what that does to your perspective on life.
[time=3306] And here's what he said.
[time=3312] I was an A+ personality type.
[time=3316] I wanted to retire at 55 and I'm an engineer.
[time=3320] I wanted to retire at 55 and I wanted to become a private consultant and I had this all worked out with the stock market and with 401(k)s and all this other stuff.
[time=3332] Well, we've all lived through the past three years in the stock market.
[time=3336] My 401(k) went down to 101(k) and some of the other stock holdings and some of the other things that I invested very heavily in and basically have dried up.
[time=3349] What I've done differently and what's changed my attitude about investment as a whole is
[time=3355] I've invested more in people.
[time=3358] I've taken particular stock of individuals at work, put an effort into at least plant
[time=3364] seeds and get them asking questions about, "Where are you going for eternity?"
[time=3371] It's led to some very interesting discussions.
[time=3373] When you get into engineers and intellectuals, it can be very challenging sometimes.
[time=3379] But family, friends, I've made it a point.
[time=3384] I can be the kind of person that doesn't ever have to go out in the evenings or meet with other couples or anything like that and we've made it a point to reach out to other families
[time=3395] and other friends and interact more, invest more in people.
[time=3400] I think as my focus has gone away from material things and become more tuned in to the needs
[time=3410] of people and to where people are at and where people are going, I've seen tremendous changes in my own attitude and my own life.
[time=3417] I would say that's where I put value at right now.
[time=3424] Paracaleo, and you know I'm reminded that the name of the Holy Spirit is Paraclete.
[time=3435] See this is the function of God, paraclete, paracaleo.
[time=3439] When you and I make life about this connection like Brian is, when you and I live like it
[time=3445] could happen at any moment like we're terminal, then this is what rises to the top, this connection.
[time=3452] Brian has a wife, Chris and two sons, Nick and James and we need to keep them in our prayers
[time=3458] and that's the life.
[time=3461] Paraclete, the Holy Spirit, paracaleo, so I'm going to pray here but here's what I want to ask you to do.
[time=3465] I want you to copy down this illustration on like a three by five card or something that you can see, something that you'll refer to frequently.
[time=3474] Before you take a phone call, before you write a letter, before you respond to an email,
[time=3480] before you encounter another human being, I want you to see that encounter through these
[time=3487] eyes, through Brian's eyes, I'm going to try to do the same, let's pray.
[time=3495] And now God make us a church who by the Holy Spirit, the paraclete becomes a life, a community
[time=3507] of lives, of paracaleo to come alongside and to call and to invite by faith, hope and love.
[time=3517] Every single person we encounter to life with you by grace through faith, forgiveness from
[time=3527] our Savior and our Lord.
[time=3531] Make it so in this place, God, and all God's people agreed and said amen.
[time=3561] [AMEN]
[time=3591] the Lord.
[time=3592] [AMEN - 2 seconds]
