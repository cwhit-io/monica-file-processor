[time=451] What a privilege to get to be with you all this morning.
[time=454] And hey, a little bit about the film itself.
[time=457] Let's just hit a few of the high points.
[time=460] I want to make sure we're clear on one thing.
[time=462] You have heard me say, and you'll probably hear me say it again.
[time=464] That the film, the Passion of the Christ, was probably one of the most powerful experiences I've ever been through.
[time=472] I say that again without hesitation, but I also want to remind all of us that the story that it portrays,
[time=479] the story of the passion found in here.
[time=482] I want to make sure we all understand that this is the most powerful thing in the world.
[time=490] The Word of God is the most powerful tool around.
[time=494] Hebrews talks about its ability to pierce and to divide and to see into your heart and mind.
[time=500] Please understand the scriptures are the most powerful experience you and I can ever have.
[time=506] This story that Mr. Gibson has captured so poignantly and the way it gets told,
[time=512] it was the most powerful experience I had ever had in that kind of a venue, in that kind of a situation.
[time=519] It looks like it's heading toward 300 million in ticket sales.
[time=524] How many in the room this morning have seen the film?
[time=527] Yeah, most of you.
[time=529] It looks like it has endured.
[time=531] I read an article yesterday that spoke to this.
[time=534] It looks like it has more than endured the anti-Semitic label that its critics early on tried to brand it with.
[time=542] The violence, a lot has been said about the violence, some have said it was too violent, that it went too far in depicting what it did.
[time=551] Those of you who have seen the movie know it's incredibly graphic and so very, very bloody.
[time=557] And I just want to remind you, you can have your opinion about that.
[time=561] That's okay.
[time=562] I just want to remind you of a passage that oftentimes we overlook in Isaiah 52 and I want to draw your mind back to the film and what you saw happen.
[time=570] It says in Isaiah 52, 14, many were amazed, Isaiah prophesying now with this event in mind.
[time=577] Many were amazed when they saw him beaten and bloodied, so disfigured one would scarcely know he was a person.
[time=587] Not beaten and bloodied, so disfigured one would scarcely know it was Jesus.
[time=593] Right? But so beaten and so bloodied, the Scriptures say that you wouldn't have even known he was a human.
[time=604] So too graphic, too bloody, too violent, you know, I'm not sure.
[time=608] He may have even backed off a bit.
[time=611] Scourgings and crucifixions were ugly endeavors.
[time=615] Anyway, it's an amazing gift, I believe, that God has given us.
[time=619] And you know what, some of the discussion I hear oftentimes about Mr. Gibson, just a word of caution to any of us.
[time=625] I have found myself on many occasions invited into discussions about his salvation.
[time=631] What do you think? Do you think Mel Gibson knows the Lord?
[time=634] Well, how in the world would I know?
[time=638] And how in the world would you?
[time=641] So be really, really careful.
[time=644] Before you and I go around talking about and engaging in discussions about whether somebody saved.
[time=651] I don't know if he is, I know I'm very grateful for his time and his effort, his investment in bringing the story of Scripture to light in a very amazing, very creative way.
[time=663] And so I think it suffices just to say thanks, you know, for the effort made, and to see what God has done with that effort is incredibly encouraging.
[time=671] Well, how are we going to meet the cast, as it were?
[time=674] Well, here's how we're going to proceed.
[time=676] Here's how we're going to kind of come at this.
[time=678] If you haven't seen the movie, I would encourage you to do so.
[time=681] How you handle that with your kids is completely up to you.
[time=684] I know some have chosen not to allow 11, 12, 13-year-olds to go.
[time=689] Kids, listen to your mom and dad, that's okay.
[time=692] Five years from now you can watch it on DVD.
[time=695] Some parents are taking their 11, 12, 13-year-old kids with them.
[time=701] That is completely up to you.
[time=703] I would just encourage you to think that through.
[time=705] And if you haven't seen the movie and you're able to, as we continue this discussion over the next four weeks, it would be good for you to have a frame of reference.
[time=714] So go.
[time=715] And also as a frame of reference, I would invite you to read through the Gospel account of what took place in those last several hours.
[time=722] Familiarize yourself with what the Scripture teaches.
[time=726] And then go and see it and then join us again next week as we make our way through.
[time=730] Each week we're going to follow a very simple five-point outline.
[time=734] All right, here's each week, all four weeks.
[time=736] Here's how this is going to unfold.
[time=738] Number one, we're going to take a look at that week's cast member, that week's individual.
[time=744] This week it is Mary and we will discuss this morning and look to God's Word as it relates to learning how to trust.
[time=751] Learning to trust.
[time=753] Next week we'll come to Peter.
[time=755] He is the cast member we'll look at and we will look at his life and his role in this passion of the Christ.
[time=762] And we will study and learn about learning from failure.
[time=767] Peter made a few mistakes along the way.
[time=771] Anybody here in the room ever failed?
[time=773] Could I see your hand?
[time=774] Okay, hands down. Anybody in the room ever really, really, really, really failed?
[time=780] Like bad. Can I see your hands?
[time=782] Oh, come on.
[time=785] Anyway, most of us have.
[time=787] I know I have.
[time=789] And there's some things we need to learn from the Word of God about dealing with failure.
[time=794] And Peter gives us an opportunity to do that.
[time=796] And the third week, it'll be a little bit of a darker side of this picture.
[time=801] The week there before Easter and we're going to consider learning how to resist temptation.
[time=806] The cast member will be evil itself.
[time=809] Satan, there are some things that we need to look at, some things you and I need to understand about resisting temptation.
[time=816] And then the last we praise God, we will get to celebrate the resurrection and the life of Jesus Christ, not his death.
[time=826] And we're going to learn about forgiveness.
[time=828] Jesus learning about forgiveness and we just look forward to being together on that Sunday, April 11th.
[time=836] So each week we'll get a cast member, then we'll look at their connection, their connection to this story.
[time=842] They each played different roles and we'll look at the connection that cast member has to the unfolding drama of the passion.
[time=849] Then we'll look at a character trait.
[time=851] We'll maybe just pick one of the most important character traits that we see evidenced in this individual.
[time=857] Some things that we can learn, some things that we can possibly take away from our study.
[time=862] I know there are and I can't wait for you to see them.
[time=865] The character trait, then fourthly the change.
[time=868] Interesting enough as you think about it, every one of these individuals went through a process as they went through this experience.
[time=875] They start here and they end here and it is really amazing to see what happens to them.
[time=882] In three cases, it's like really, really amazing and so very encouraging and exciting.
[time=889] In one case, again it's a little dark but it's something we need to look at.
[time=894] And then lastly a challenge.
[time=895] Each week we'll try and leave you with at least one thing that you could take home.
[time=899] A challenge for you personally, something that you and I could work on in the coming days as it relates to what we saw that Sunday in that individual's life.
[time=908] Why?
[time=909] Why are we doing all this?
[time=911] What's the point?
[time=912] What's the main purpose behind it?
[time=914] Well, if you know me at all, if you're part of this family, you know this to be true.
[time=918] If you've watched on the broadcast in the past, we just do our best to lovingly and yet forthrightly tell you the truth.
[time=927] And so I'm going to just tell you the truth here, just for a second.
[time=931] Why are we doing this?
[time=933] We are doing this most of all for one reason and one reason only and that is this Jesus of Nazareth, the person of Christ.
[time=944] If he's who he said he was and if he did all that he did and it appears that he did.
[time=951] If he accomplished all that he accomplished and if all of it was for the reason stated so that you and I could have life so that you and I could have forgiveness of sin so that you and I could have an eternity.
[time=962] If it's all true, then Jesus and what you, whoever you are, wherever you've been, wherever your journey has brought you, what you do with him, how you respond to him, the choice that you make ultimately as it relates to him.
[time=984] It's the most important decision you'll ever make. It is the central question in life. What have you done with Jesus?
[time=995] And he's a loving God who designed this whole thing in a way whereby he gives you an eye choice.
[time=1001] There are no puppets, there are no closed deals, I mean he gives you an eye, the ability and the opportunity to choose and choose you must.
[time=1013] And so we do our best here with his help in these four weeks and in the other 48 that we get to always do that same thing and that is preach Christ.
[time=1025] Do our best to communicate the truth about him and to give you the opportunity, whoever you are, to make your decision.
[time=1033] Well let's get to Mary. What do you say? Our first cast member, Mary. Mary, we read and learn about Mary for the very first time in Luke chapter 1.
[time=1042] Would you turn and open your Bibles to Luke chapter 1, Luke 1 verses 26 to 38. If you don't have a Bible, no problem, you could look on with somebody nearby.
[time=1052] I'm sure they wouldn't mind. Or you can follow along on the screens.
[time=1056] Luke chapter 1 verses 26 to 38 and as always in honor of God's word, would you stand with me this morning?
[time=1064] As I read, would you follow along?
[time=1072] Luke chapter 1 starting in verse 26. Now in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city in Galilee called Nazareth to a virgin.
[time=1081] Engaged to a man whose name was Joseph of the descendants of David, and the virgin's name was Mary.
[time=1088] And coming in, he said to her, "Greetings, favored one. The Lord is with you." But she was very perplexed at this statement and kept pondering what kind of salutation this was.
[time=1099] The angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.
[time=1104] And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name him Jesus, and he will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High.
[time=1113] And the Lord God will give him the throne of his father, David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever.
[time=1119] And his kingdom will have no end." And Mary said to the angel, "How can this be since I am a virgin?" And the angel answered and said to her, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you."
[time=1134] And for that reason, the Holy Child shall be called the Son of God.
[time=1138] And behold, even your relative Elizabeth has also conceived a son in her old age, and she who was called Baron is now in her sixth month.
[time=1147] For nothing will be impossible, as we just sang earlier.
[time=1152] For nothing will be impossible with God.
[time=1156] And Mary said, "Behold, the bond slave of the Lord, may it be done to me according to your word, and the angel departed from her."
[time=1167] Father, we pray as we open up your word this morning.
[time=1171] And as we open ourselves to its penetrating, and convicting, and reminding, and encouraging power,
[time=1180] God, we pray that we would be different because of our time with you and because of our exposure to it.
[time=1187] We thank you for it.
[time=1189] We're so grateful that these ancient words are still today ever true, and they're changing us.
[time=1195] They're growing us into the people that you want us to be.
[time=1198] God, thank you for the privilege that is ours of being together in this place this morning, and may the Spirit of God, and may the Word of God, and may the people of God bring great encouragement to our time here.
[time=1211] In your son's name we pray, amen.
[time=1214] You can be seated.
[time=1215] You know, we don't know much else about Mary's background from Scripture.
[time=1219] By comparing the gospel records, we discover that she had a sister named Salome, the mother of Zebedee's children.
[time=1226] Zebedee was the father of the apostles James and John. They were all simple fishermen, Matthew 4 would say.
[time=1233] Luke says Elizabeth, mother of John the Baptist, was a relative of Mary, and Luke's genealogy in Luke 3 refers to Mary's father as Eli.
[time=1243] Other than that, we know almost nothing about her.
[time=1246] Her early life was spent in Nazareth.
[time=1249] She was more than likely from a very poor family, and was no doubt hard-working.
[time=1254] It is obvious she was an exceptionally virtuous and godly young woman, and most scholars don't miss this.
[time=1261] Most scholars put her age at anywhere from 13 to 18 years at the time of Christ's birth.
[time=1271] More than likely 13, 14, 15 years old when the angel Gabriel comes in and completely and absolutely alters her life in two sentences.
[time=1283] One thing the Scripture is absolutely clear on. One thing that is really not even debatable by virtue of historical and textual proof.
[time=1291] She was a what? She was a virgin. That we know. She was pure. Chased.
[time=1301] Physically had never known a man sexually in any way, shape, or form, which obviously, please don't miss this.
[time=1308] Out of the gate brings huge implications. Yes to her moral stature, but even more than that,
[time=1314] the fact that she was a virgin brings unbelievable implication to what is really the foundation,
[time=1320] one of the fundamental tenets of our faith.
[time=1324] And that is that Jesus of Nazareth, who came, lived, died, and rose again so you and I could have life, was born of a virgin.
[time=1332] Joseph was not his father physically. Jesus was, say it with me, the son of God.
[time=1342] And the spirit shall come and overshadow you. Wow.
[time=1349] He's the son of God, which brings us to our next point. Her connection, her connection, Mary's connection to this amazing story.
[time=1357] She was righted down. If you're taking notes, she was the mother of Jesus.
[time=1362] She was the mother of Jesus. And at the risk of dwelling on the obvious, let's just camp here for a second,
[time=1368] because I don't know if you've actually taken the time lately to think this through like this.
[time=1373] And I don't just speak to you in the room who are mothers. I think you're going to have a special connection to this.
[time=1379] I think fathers, you could even identify with this as a parent, but just stop and let's just dwell on the obvious.
[time=1385] And I want you just to say it to yourself a few times, okay?
[time=1388] And I want you to think. Now, take your mind out of the theological realm for a moment and let's just get really practical.
[time=1395] She was his mother. She was his mother. And I'll say to you this way, there was a time in his life when she was mom.
[time=1412] I mean, just keep going on your mind. There was a time in her life when she was mommy.
[time=1421] Mary was the mother. She was the mom. She was the mommy to Jesus. Think about it.
[time=1433] She bore him. She raised him. She nursed and bathed him. She fed him and played with him.
[time=1439] She cuddled him and cleaned up his great knees. She taught him, prayed with him, laughed with him, and yelled for him to come home.
[time=1450] She was his mom. And there are so many implications that come with that.
[time=1457] But maybe I think the most powerful implication, the most powerful thing that you and I can take away from that is something we'll get to in just a minute here.
[time=1467] Let me, if I can, take us to our next point. And then we're going to come back and we're going to see how this mother of Jesus ties in so very powerfully.
[time=1477] Let's move on to her primary character trait. People marry the mother, the mom to Jesus. Please write this down.
[time=1485] Please understand this as best you can this morning, people. She was obedient.
[time=1492] Mary was obedient. She was a trusting obedient woman. She was human. She had her flaws. That's for sure because she was human, but she was so very obedient.
[time=1506] Let me give you a definition of obedient. Obedience to find this way. A trusting submission. Write this down.
[time=1514] A trusting submission that actively responds to him and his word. Obedience is a trusting submission. And what are you trusting in?
[time=1525] You're trusting in God. You're trusting in His goodness. You're trusting in His character. You're trusting in the fact that He's a good God who loves you more than you'll ever, ever imagine.
[time=1535] And whatever He brings, whatever He allows, you can trust Him because He's good, not bad. A trusting submission that actively responds to Him and His word.
[time=1546] And boy, did God reveal His word to her or what? Gabriel comes. And in that passage we just read, God's word, God's unfolding will for this young 13, 14 year old girl's life is revealed.
[time=1558] He lays it out there for her. And I'm talking, you know, life shattering, life will never be the same kind of stuff. Just boom, He just gives it to her.
[time=1569] And I love her response. You should, every one of you, should take note of her response. If you look back at that passage and as you read back through it again tonight, maybe you'll see that in essence there were two things that she said.
[time=1582] There were two ways in which she responded. That's it. Just two. First of all, she says about halfway through there. If you think back to it, she says, Mary said to the angel, verse 34, how can this be since I'm a virgin?
[time=1598] I mean, I can see it in my mind's eye. This is a good girl. And she's probably doing her best to hang in there in the midst of a personal visit from Gabriel.
[time=1608] And he says all this, and she's going like, wait a minute. You know, like not to be disrespectful, but how? You know, she asks, in essence, what you and I sometimes ask when something begins to unfold, like, wait a minute, what's going on here?
[time=1623] And then the angel responds. God's word and will is revealed more fully, and her response is, I'm in. There is no break in the passage. There is no two-day span where she requests an opportunity to think about it.
[time=1643] No, this young girl, this bondservant of God, asks her question and then immediately responds, I'm in. Be it done to me, according to your word, according to my wishes. No, according to my plan that I had for my life. No.
[time=1663] Be it done to me, she says, according to your word. Very interesting Greek word used in that response there in verse 38. You see that in verse 38, Mary said, behold, the bond slave of the Lord. Interesting Greek word there.
[time=1677] Do-loss, that word bond slave. It means do-loss. It was the lowest form of servant that there would have been in that culture and in that day. This individual, this do-loss, this bondservant was a slave.
[time=1691] Now, Mary obviously does not refer to slave there in the most negative of connotations. Her is a positive joy filled out. I'll do whatever you want.
[time=1703] I'll go wherever you want me to go. I'll be a part of whatever unfolding plan you reveal. Behold, God, your bondservant, your servant, your slave, you say it, you reveal it, and I'll do it. You see, here's the point, because she viewed herself.
[time=1722] This gal, this young woman, she viewed herself. Her view of herself when it got right down to it was that she saw herself as a servant, as a slave. And you know what people? Slaves, real slaves, real servants.
[time=1741] They do what they're asked to do. And the question comes back to you and the question comes back to me. And I'm really serious here. You need to just take a moment and think this through. So how do you view yourself?
[time=1758] Come on, be honest. I mean, be really, really honest with yourself. How do you, what are you? Who are you? What are you, a businessman? Are you a business woman? Are you a really smart person? What are you? Are you attractive? Are you fun?
[time=1778] I mean, how do you view yourself fundamentally? I mean, when it gets right down to it, because here's the deal, however you and I answer that, whatever it is, we view ourselves as that is, that is what will go into our responses when God says go, because God might say go and you and I might say, well, but wait, I'm a...
[time=1805] Mary saw herself as a servant. And because that was her fundamental picture of herself, her response was, I'm in. Be it done to me, according to your word.
[time=1822] Now, here's the most powerful part of her obedience. The character trait, obedience. Here's, in my opinion, as I read through this, as I consider this, as I watch how it all plays out, here's the most powerful part of her obedience.
[time=1834] And her trust, it continues. It is consistent, even in the midst of unspeakable heartache. Now, here's the point. Remember her being the mother, her being the mom of Jesus. Here's my point. She was his mother.
[time=1854] Her character trait is obedience, and her obedience and trust continues, even while her son has the life beaten out of him.
[time=1864] While her son is tortured mercilessly, while her son is whipped and mocked, she stands by in quiet trust with a deep and profound faith.
[time=1877] Was she hurting? Oh, my goodness. You think she was hurting? Yes or no? I think she was absolutely coming undone internally.
[time=1886] How about you? I mean, what has your response been? I mean, you and I could sit here all day and tell stories of ways in which we've risen to the occasion to defend those that we love and care for, especially our own.
[time=1904] And while that is done to him, she stands by in quiet trust. She never says that's it. Like you and I oftentimes do. She never says that's it, okay? That's enough. God, you went a little bit too far.
[time=1916] You've required a little bit too much of me. Okay, I mean, this right here, I mean, this situation, God, I'm out. I'm sorry. I tried. I'm out. I'm taking the remote back.
[time=1930] That picture just kind of came to my mind this morning, first hour thinking about this. You and I see in a relationship with him, we give him the remote.
[time=1937] Does that make sense? And we say, "I'm with you." And we give him the remote. And he goes, "Dwink." And we go, "Okay, I can do this." And so we start walking down this road and all of a sudden, boom and boom and oh, and you're going to change the channel.
[time=1954] Please." And he says, "No, this is going to be all right." And we get called down this road that wasn't at all what we had planned. It doesn't look at all like we had envisioned.
[time=1965] And he has the remote. And we walk by faith. And yet sometimes you and I just say, "Hey, you know what I'm sorry. I'm going to take that back and change it." Okay, now that's better.
[time=1978] See, and then what happens is we go, "Oh, well, well, maybe I'll just, maybe I'll just hold on to this." Right?
[time=1989] And we start living life holding on to the remote. And is that faith? Yes or no? No.
[time=1998] She never said, "Give me the remote." She never said, "That's it." She kept obeying. She kept trusting.
[time=2009] "Here I am, your servant. Be it done to me according to your word." Does that sound familiar to you?
[time=2018] "Be it done to me according to your word. Your will not mine be done." Does that sound familiar to any of you?
[time=2030] Who do we know who said something like that? Who? Where? In the where? In the garden.
[time=2039] "Father, may this cup pass from me? If not, your will, not my will, but yours be done." The thought struck me this week. I wonder where he got that.
[time=2050] I mean, I think he got it because he was Jesus, first of all. But I can't help but think that he grew up with a woman who lived like that, who thought that way.
[time=2062] Who said that at the age of 14? Not my will, but yours. Be it done to me according to your word.
[time=2072] Well, how did she change? How did she change? Well, you know what? Please write this down. She grew people. She grew.
[time=2082] Here's the point. And I'll show you in Scripture a great, great example of this. But let me just say this to you first. And I want you to hear this.
[time=2089] Life for Mary, as we see it unfold here, especially in the passion of the Christ, life was really, really hard and she kept obeying. She kept trusting.
[time=2100] She didn't get bitter or let her heart shrink as a result of her pain. Let me say that to you one more time.
[time=2106] She didn't get bitter or let her heart shrink as a result of her pain. She grew people. She stayed at it.
[time=2116] She had an opportunity. She had a choice to make. In the midst of unbelievable pain and maybe even some confusion.
[time=2124] She could continue to follow the voice that you and I know calls us to endure. It's this voice of love and comfort from a good God who has our best interest at heart.
[time=2134] Calling you and I to walk a road that he'll walk with us, that he's called us to face and see. And then there's this voice over here saying, are you kidding me?
[time=2143] And you hear it and I hear it and it sounds different and comes at us from different perspectives. But you and I know there's this voice that we hear.
[time=2150] And I'm sure the same voice you know she heard. Come on, that's enough.
[time=2154] Come on. He has abandoned you. It says, come on. You need some relief. Come on, it says.
[time=2162] Come on, back down this road. And we know that's a road that leads to a shrinking heart, a bitter spirit.
[time=2168] All that comes with disobedience and rebellion. And we know this road, though painful and confusing at times, has the potential to lead you and I to a heart that's bigger.
[time=2178] In a life that's freer because that's where obedience leads us. And she stayed at it. Look at Acts.
[time=2185] Look at Acts, chapter 1. Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts. This absolutely fired me up when I saw that. I mean, you know, I get a little fired up sometimes, I know.
[time=2196] And again, I realize I might get a little bit more fired up than you get fired up about certain things. But I'm hoping this really fires all of us up.
[time=2204] Because when I saw this again this last week, I was so encouraged. It meant so much to me. And it helped me kind of with this picture of Mary.
[time=2214] I hope it helps you. Look at Acts, Acts, before you look at Acts, before you look at that, don't look at the screens.
[time=2221] Look at me, don't look at the screens. Before you take him off the screens quick, before you look at that, just remember this, okay?
[time=2228] Christ, you know, he lives, he dies, he's crucified, he's risen again, he comes and shows himself to the twelve, he shows himself to the many, and then he ascends into heaven and he's gone.
[time=2239] And he looks them all in the eye before he goes. Remember, Matthew 28, he looks off this faithful band of Christ followers who were probably petrified.
[time=2250] He looks them all in the eyes and he says, "It's your turn. Go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them, and teaching them all that I have commanded."
[time=2261] And he charges them to go and change the then known world and he leaves and they're all by themselves.
[time=2270] And they go back several weeks later now, they're in Jerusalem, they're upstairs and they're huddled in this little room.
[time=2276] We know Pentecost is about to hit, the Holy Spirit is about to come with a unique blessing and ministry is about to begin in powerful ways, but I bring you back to this little room where this faithful band has gathered
[time=2290] and look who is in the midst of them.
[time=2294] These all with one mind were continually devoting themselves to prayer along with the women and Mary, the mother of Jesus and with his brothers.
[time=2307] She's still there, she's still at it.
[time=2312] She's there huddled with these people in this upper room, still faithful, still hopeful, still giving herself to the mission that God had given them.
[time=2322] And in my mind, when I read that, I kind of transitioned her in a way from mother of Jesus to Christ follower.
[time=2329] And there she is giving herself to the greatest endeavor of all.
[time=2333] And she didn't shrink up and die, she didn't get small, she didn't grow bitter, she didn't walk away and go, "You know what, God, you're not loving."
[time=2340] No, no, no, no, no, no, she grew.
[time=2343] She grew to this point where here she is, after his ascension, still giving herself to the ministry that God had given her.
[time=2351] How are you doing this morning? Here's your challenge. Here's your challenge.
[time=2356] The challenge I hope you would take away from this this morning, those of you that know him, those of you in the room this morning that live in a surrendered relationship with him.
[time=2364] I hope and I pray that you would be a people, young and old and in between, that would be willing to keep growing.
[time=2371] Many of you have faced difficulty in these last few weeks, in these last few months, many of you in this room today who know him, have been faced with life altering stuff.
[time=2382] There has been confusion, a bit of despair, there has been pain beyond what you ever, ever thought would come.
[time=2390] And the opportunity for you today is to keep growing, because in the midst of whatever it is you're facing, he still calls you and I to obey.
[time=2401] We're still called to trust. They're still life to be lived. They're still things to do. They're still places to go.
[time=2408] And he calls you and I to give ourselves to that obediently, no matter what.
[time=2415] Those of you in the room this morning that don't know him, those of you here that are still on that journey, you're searching today, trying to understand what a faith relationship with Jesus Christ looks like.
[time=2426] For you, I would encourage you as you leave this place today, to keep growing, and I don't mean in essence spiritually, but personally as you continue to ask questions, as you continue to have conversations with those that you trust, conversations that matter,
[time=2441] conversations that have eternity on the line.
[time=2445] My hope for you and our prayer for you is that you would keep coming forward, that you would keep moving down this road, that you would continue with humility to look at your life and to consider the truth of God's Word and open yourself to what he would have for you in a relationship with him.
[time=2466] Hey, you know what? It is one thing to talk about it.
[time=2471] And it's one thing to dialogue at the level of truth and concepts. It's another thing to actually see it.
[time=2481] And I want to invite you this morning to see it up close and personal with me.
[time=2487] This individual hasn't arrived. This is not a comparison to Mary. This is an opportunity for you, and I hope you'll just sit tight and just take a few minutes.
[time=2496] This is an opportunity for you to be encouraged from a real life, real person, real situation, where life got a little confusing.
[time=2505] And somebody had an opportunity to respond one way or the other. I want to introduce you to Sherry, would you come up to a good friend of ours, Sherry Merese.
[time=2514] Many of you in the room know Sherry Merese. Others of you don't.
[time=2519] And that's okay because now you get a chance to meet her. Hi, Sherry.
[time=2523] And let's come over here a little bit, Dino. Thanks. Sherry, have a seat there.
[time=2529] Sherry is a part of our family here at Blackhawk, a good, good friend of ours.
[time=2534] And a couple of years ago, I went through a situation that I'm going to let her tell you about.
[time=2539] But I just want to stand here and say to you all that as I had the privilege of watching her and her family go through what God brought their way,
[time=2549] I was, as many of us here at Blackhawk were, I was encouraged and I was reminded of what real trust and real obedience looks like.
[time=2558] Again, she's not perfect. She is one, though, who has tasted.
[time=2563] I think about what Mary experienced that night in her room. When all of a sudden something gets said, something gets done and it isn't quite what you thought it was going to be.
[time=2575] And you knew at that moment life would be different. And how are we going to respond?
[time=2580] Sherry is going to just share with you her story and how God has grown her the things that she has learned.
[time=2587] And then four of the crew, the Marisi crew are here, and they're going to come and close us out today with a song.
[time=2595] And she'll even tell you a little bit about that. So, Sherry, good to have you here.
[time=2600] Thank you. First of all, I'd like thank you for this opportunity to share today.
[time=2605] And like Kelly said, I'm not perfect, but I do know the one who is perfect.
[time=2610] And I don't have all the answers, but I, again, know the one who does.
[time=2615] If you hear last week, you remember Mitch talked about the three stories.
[time=2620] And today I would like to share just a part of my story and how God and His story has impacted me and helped me and encouraged me.
[time=2630] And I just pray that somehow that might help you in your story.
[time=2635] I was born in Ohio, and I moved to Fort Wayne to go to Parkview Nursing School.
[time=2643] While attending there, I started attending Blackhawk, and that's where I met my husband, Ed.
[time=2648] He was a Bible study teacher here, and we were married and blessed with seven children.
[time=2655] And Ed worked for UPS here in Fort Wayne for 25 years.
[time=2661] And we had a great life. Life was just gone super.
[time=2665] And we'll fast forward up to February 22, 2002. It was about 5.15.
[time=2674] We were talking on the phone, joking around. He was going to be on vacation the next week.
[time=2679] We were going to celebrate our 24th anniversary on Monday. This was a Friday.
[time=2684] We were making plans to go to the basketball game at Blackhawk.
[time=2689] It was senior night, and my son Philip was a senior, and was going to be honored for our city letter winner.
[time=2698] And so we were making plans about that. He was going to -- Ed was going to be home about 6.15.
[time=2703] And when 6.15 came, he wasn't around in 6.20, 6.25, not showing up.
[time=2709] This was not like Ed, so I knew something was going on.
[time=2713] So I called out at UPS and no answer. I tried on his cell phone, his pagers, voicemail, no answer.
[time=2721] And I could never remember a time that I couldn't get ahold of Ed, so I was concerned something had happened.
[time=2728] So I called a friend from UPS, and he went out to the center, and I had my oldest son, David, follow his travel path out to work just to make sure he hadn't had an accident.
[time=2741] They found Ed, and the EMS were called, and they worked on him for quite a while, and then took him to Lutheran Hospital.
[time=2750] And so they told me to meet at Lutheran. Friends of ours, Dave and Sherri Graham took Janice and I there.
[time=2757] I remember the ride there was just so long. It was only like 20 minutes, but it seemed like forever.
[time=2764] And they took me to a room, and it was only a couple minutes, but it again seemed like forever.
[time=2771] And the doctor came in and told me that sorry, Mrs. Mriesi, there was nothing we could do, your husband passed away.
[time=2779] So at that time, thinking about if someone would have asked me the same question that they asked me at 5.15, do you have faith and trust?
[time=2791] It really kind of took on a new, deeper, guttier meeting.
[time=2797] And I looked up trust in the dictionary, and these are kind of what it really came to mean to me in a deeper way at that time.
[time=2807] Put your faith in, believe in and know to be true, be convinced, depend upon, lean on, place your confidence in, look to, and rest assured.
[time=2823] And it's amazing how one second, your life is one way, and the next second is another way.
[time=2831] Kelly kind of asked me to ask how my feelings were at that time, and I felt helpless and weak and alone.
[time=2839] My mind was racing, feelings of panic, kind of like I'm feeling right now.
[time=2847] Thoughts of I can't do this, I don't want to do this, a great sense of sadness and loss.
[time=2854] And questions going through my mind, why was this happening to me?
[time=2859] Why is it happening now? He's only 46 years old. He was just given a clean bill of health 10 days before.
[time=2868] But starting then and continuing even now, there was some things I feel like God was showing me and helping me at that time to get through this.
[time=2879] And the first one was, be still and know that I am God, and this is found in Psalms 46-10.
[time=2887] I didn't understand at all what was going on at that time, and I questioned what was going on, but I had complete confidence that God was in control.
[time=2897] The second thing is, God alone is my rock and my salvation. He is my fortress. I will not be shaken.
[time=2909] At the time, I felt like Ed was my rock and my fortress, my strength, not completely, but a big part of it.
[time=2919] And I felt like my earth was shaken and I was shaken, but God, you know, he didn't say God and Ed were your rock and fortress. He said God alone.
[time=2932] The third one comes from Philippians 4, 4 through 7. And I remember feeling this on the rides of the hospital and when I found out about Ed, and also on the long walk down the corridor down to see Ed where he was.
[time=2948] There's a verse that says, "Pray, present your petitions, and the peace of God that passes all understanding will guard your heart and your mind."
[time=2961] And I remember feeling that, and there's no way to describe how you possibly can be feeling that way when you've just lost someone you deeply love.
[time=2971] And it's only because of God and the Holy Spirit that that comes to you.
[time=2977] Something else at that time I needed to do is embrace what was at that time, what is not what used to be.
[time=2985] And I needed to stand firm in that. I just lost my husband, my best friend. My children had just lost their father, a loving and godly father.
[time=2996] Our hopes and our dreams for the future were forever changed.
[time=3001] We had a new, normal, what might have been did not exist anymore.
[time=3007] We had just had a life-changing event, and I wanted to be life-defining and a positive and in not a negative way.
[time=3016] This kind of spurred me on to what I call going to the mother mode.
[time=3021] There was a verse that we had in a framed print in our house.
[time=3026] It was one of Ed's favorite verses, and he prayed it a lot.
[time=3030] Jeremiah 24-15, "As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord."
[time=3036] And I just remember begging God at that time, "Please God, help us to be something that is positive in our lives, positive in our kids' lives and our friends.
[time=3046] Don't let it make us become bitter, but better."
[time=3052] Last but not least, something I would like to mention that was a great help to me was a song that was written in the 1870s.
[time=3060] It was a favorite song of Ed's and mine, and we sang it at his funeral.
[time=3064] It was written by Horatio Spafford.
[time=3067] He was a prominent lawyer who lived in Chicago. He had four daughters.
[time=3072] He was active in his church there.
[time=3075] He was a friend of DL Moody, but a series of calamities started to affect him.
[time=3081] The Chicago fire wiped out all his real estate investments, and several other things happened to him.
[time=3089] Spafford decided to send his wife and his four daughters to Europe on a vacation.
[time=3095] Halfway across the ocean, their ship was hit by an English vessel in its sink in just a few minutes.
[time=3103] Spafford received a wire home from his wife, saying, "Saved alone," his daughter said all drowned.
[time=3111] Spafford immediately boarded a ship to join his wife, and when the ship passed the place, approximately where his daughter said, "went down."
[time=3121] He penned the words to the song, "It is well with my soul." This is a song of hope and a song of trust.
[time=3129] That same God who was with Mary many years ago and encouraged her was with Spafford in 1871.
[time=3137] He trusted God and God comforted him.
[time=3140] That same God was with me in 2002 in my family.
[time=3144] I trusted him. He encouraged me. He's here today in 2004 because I'm still struggling. I still miss my husband.
[time=3151] Immensely, it's not like everything's just fine, but also that same God is here for you today, that if you just trust him, he is there to comfort you.
[time=3162] I continue daily with my life story, and God is faithful to me and my family.
[time=3168] And even though I may encounter problems and grief and sorrow, illness, sickness, death, I have trust, hope and peace, and I can say that it is well with my soul.
[time=3180] Thank you.
[time=3182] [AMEN] For my children now, we'll sing Janice, and then Jessica, Melissa, and Philip.
[time=3210] When peace like a river, a tenderth my way.
[time=3223] When sorrows like sea, billows roll.
[time=3234] Whatever my life thou hast taught me to say.
[time=3245] It is well, it is well with my soul.
[time=3280] Oh, my sin, oh the bliss of this glorious thought.
[time=3292] Let my sin not impart but the whole.
[time=3304] It is nailed to his cross, so I bear it no more.
[time=3315] Praise the Lord, praise the Lord on my soul.
[time=3327] It is well, it is well with my soul.
[time=3351] And Lord hates the day, when the face shall be sight.
[time=3363] The clouds be rolled back as a scroll.
[time=3375] The shall shall be sound, and the Lord shall descend.
[time=3387] Even so, it is well with my soul.
[time=3399] It is well, it is well with my soul.
[time=3409] With my soul, it is well, it is well with my soul.
[time=3424] It is well, it is well with my soul.
[time=3456] [AMEN]
[time=3469] Praise God.
[time=3472] Why don't you all stand and let's pray together, please.
[time=3478] Father, we stand as a people who have been so powerfully reminded that in relationship with you and only, only in knowing you,
[time=3489] can it be well with our soul?
[time=3492] And we're so thankful for this family and others in this place like them who have faithfully walked that road of trust and obedience.
[time=3501] And God, as we learn from the life of Mary this morning, and as we see lived out here in this real life example, God, I pray that we would be a people willing to walk this road, willing to hold on to you, willing to hold tightly to each other, and to trust and obey.
[time=3518] And Father, we pray that as we leave this place, that in the way that we leave and in the way that we live, we would reflect this kind of commitment.
[time=3527] And God, thank you for your willingness to instill courage and strength.
[time=3531] Thank you for loving us like you do, and bring us back together again soon.
[time=3536] In your son's name we pray, amen.
[time=3539] (music playing)
