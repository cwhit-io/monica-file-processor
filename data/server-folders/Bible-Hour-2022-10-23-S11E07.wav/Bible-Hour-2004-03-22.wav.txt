[time=83] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, Senior Pastor here at Blackhawk Ministries.
[time=86] And we are so thankful for the amazing things that God is doing here at Blackhawk in recent months.
[time=92] It is so exciting to see His hand at work, and we know it's all because of Him, it's all because of His Spirit, it's all because of the Word of God, and what it does in the lives of people.
[time=102] We are anticipating an incredible day coming up on April 11th.
[time=108] It's called Easter.
[time=109] It's the greatest day of all.
[time=110] It is the Sunday that we look forward to more than any other Sunday in the entire year as we celebrate the resurrection of our Lord.
[time=119] And there are a lot of you who watch the Bible hour.
[time=121] Recent figures put it probably in the 15 to 20,000 people range,
[time=127] and many of you have church homes.
[time=129] We're so thankful that you're a part of those places, and we want you to continue to build into those places.
[time=135] That's a good thing.
[time=136] But there is another segment of you out there, and I just want to speak to you directly just for a few minutes here this morning.
[time=144] You don't go to church.
[time=145] This is your church.
[time=147] You tune in every week, and I want you to know how grateful we are for that.
[time=151] I view you as part of our family in essence.
[time=155] And with Easter coming, I just wanted to say something to you today.
[time=159] Would you please consider coming?
[time=162] We cannot tell you how thankful we would be
[time=168] and how excited we would be to have you with us.
[time=171] And we don't care who you are.
[time=172] We don't care where you've been.
[time=173] We don't care what you look like.
[time=174] We don't care how much money you make.
[time=176] We would just love for you.
[time=178] Those of you who have watched faithfully to finally come, set foot in this place and see what it's like to be surrounded by an amazing family, an incredible band of Christ followers who would love nothing more than for you to join us on Easter Sunday.
[time=193] We're also going to have a good Friday service at 1215 on Good Friday.
[time=197] We would love to have you there.
[time=198] But that Easter Sunday morning, I just want to say this to you.
[time=201] Would you please trust me on this?
[time=204] Would you please consider coming and being a part of that day with us?
[time=207] And come down afterwards and say hello and introduce yourself to us.
[time=211] We would love to have you here.
[time=213] Easter's coming.
[time=214] We can't wait and we hope that you'll join us.
[time=217] See you then.
[time=239] We just want love at the thought of you.
[time=248] The darkness gets way to the light for you.
[time=253] The Christ that you think is a spy, brand new.
[time=256] Hosanna, Lorelle, we worship you.
[time=263] For you are a joint and my soul on top.
[time=267] In a means, ruler of everything.
[time=270] Hosanna, Lorelle, we worship you.
[time=278] For your patience and kindness and flavor and mercy and honor and glory, because you are worthy.
[time=287] We can live without you.
[time=289] We can't breathe without you.
[time=291] We can sing without you.
[time=293] Hosanna, Lorelle, we worship you.
[time=295] No greater love in this world but you.
[time=299] No one can compare to the thing to do.
[time=303] Wherever you go, I will follow you.
[time=307] Hosanna, Lorelle, we worship you.
[time=315] We have great jobs to jump and finish your name.
[time=319] This house made a place that you'll pass away.
[time=323] For ever the test you will free the suit.
[time=327] Hosanna, Lorelle, we worship you.
[time=387] We love you, Hosanna, we praise you.
[time=393] Hosanna, you're worthy.
[time=401] Hosanna, we love you.
[time=405] We praise you, we love you.
[time=409] We love you, we need you.
[time=417] We love you.
[time=421] Hi, my name's Sam Barfell and I have the privilege of serving as the Superintendent of Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=433] And maybe you've heard about the last week of our life here at Black Hawk Christian as our boys varsity basketball team made it to the state championship game.
[time=439] And I couldn't have been prouder of all of our guys on the team and the coaching staff and the cheerleaders and all of the thousands of fans who made their trek down from Fort Wayne to Indianapolis to compete at Consequel Fieldhouse for the 1A state title game.
[time=453] And I couldn't have been prouder, but after the sting wore off of losing that game, a sense of accomplishment set in of the fact that we made it that far and our kids had that sense of accomplishment as well.
[time=466] And what a joy it was to be one of the first Christian schools to represent the Lord Jesus Christ at the state level in ISA.
[time=473] And so that was an exciting part of our life and I enjoy hanging out with the high school kids and seeing their accomplishment and being able to be a part of their lives in that way.
[time=482] But I also have the privilege of hanging out with some of the younger students as well.
[time=486] And right here with me I have some of our star kindergarten students, Sadie and Joe and Meredith and Jordan.
[time=492] And they are in our kindergarten program right here at Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=496] And I just wanted to tell you about an opportunity that's available next year in both our preschool and our kindergarten program at Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=503] We do still have openings for enrollment at Black Hawk Christian School in both preschool and kindergarten.
[time=508] And if you were interested in finding out information about that, please call 4937400 to get that information or logon blackhawkchristian.org.
[time=516] But I can just tell you there's a team of ladies who are qualified competent educators who just wrap their arms around these kids both literally and figuratively and love them, but also to teach them and train them both in an academic setting and in a spiritual setting.
[time=530] And that's what makes Black Hawk Christian School so unique and so distinct.
[time=533] And so I want to share that opportunity with you today and let you know that there are openings and please give us a call.
[time=538] We sure love the opportunity to sit down and share with you all the good things that God's doing right here at Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=544] Alleluia, Lord of glory, we insult you.
[time=549] Only sovereign, Alleluia, Alleluia.

[time=656] King of nations.
[time=658] Alleluia, Lord of glory, we insult you.
[time=664] Only sovereign, Alleluia, Amen.
[time=679] Father in Heaven.
[time=683] You shouldn't thrown above the circle of the earth, and you are the master and creator of all.
[time=695] May the songs we sing and the prayers we pray be a sweet smelling incense.
[time=703] May the words of our mouths and the meditations of our hearts be praised to you, oh Lord, our rock and our redeemer.
[time=714] And Christ, you sit and thrown down high.
[time=717] You are the great Messiah.
[time=721] Christ, you are the King of nations.
[time=723] Christ, you are the Lord of all glory.
[time=728] Christ, you are the only sovereign.
[time=732] Christ, you are the Amen.
[time=736] [AMEN]
[time=742] In 2 Timothy 2, kind of halfway down the page there,
[time=757] you can read it sometime.
[time=759] Paul, the mentor, is writing to the young mentor, Timothy, who's doing his best in ministry at Ephesus.
[time=768] And he's struggling though.
[time=769] I mean, there's things going wrong and there's conflict within the body.
[time=773] And so Paul's writing to Timothy and he's reminding Timothy about this thing called usefulness.
[time=779] And he's helping Timothy, kind of he's reminding Timothy how it is that as a young man in ministry, he can be useful to God, how he can be used of God to do good works, how he can contribute in a way that would make a difference.
[time=796] And the way that he does it, the word picture that Paul uses as he encourages this young guy is the picture of a vessel that actually uses that phrase there in the text.
[time=809] He talks about being a vessel, a clay pot.
[time=815] And in talking about it, he reminds Timothy and as we read it, we're reminded that these clay pots, this vase, I mean, however you want to word it, the bottom line was that it was used to bring life.
[time=829] It was used to bring relief.
[time=831] It was used to bring water to whether it was plants or people.
[time=836] The idea of a vessel, a good vessel, an honorable vessel is that it could be used of God.
[time=844] And so Paul, he paints this picture to Timothy and he says, "Be a good vessel.
[time=849] Be a good vessel that can be used of God to do good things." And you know what?
[time=854] And I might be speaking for a lot of people in the room this morning.
[time=857] I think there's a lot of people here who want to be, and I want to be, I want to be a good vessel.
[time=863] When I hear Paul encourage Timothy, I think, you know what?
[time=866] Me too.
[time=867] I mean, I want to help advance what's good.
[time=870] I mean, I want to think about Jesus and the woman at the well before, and he was all about having her discover living water.
[time=878] We know real water kind of got passed along through clay pots, living water, life-changing water comes through vessels.
[time=888] I want to be a vessel.
[time=890] How about you?
[time=892] Well, you know what?
[time=896] Sometimes I'll stop and I'll, as I think about that.
[time=900] Not all the time, but sometimes my mind will go to my past failures.
[time=905] Even some of my present ones.
[time=910] Sometimes I'll consider some of the choices that I've made.
[time=914] I'll think about some of the places I've gone.
[time=916] I'll think about some of the anger that's spewed, some of the pride that's been embraced.
[time=921] I think about some of the decisions that have been made.
[time=925] I think about some of the temptation that I've caved into.
[time=930] I think about relationships that have been violated.
[time=934] Sometimes I'll consider what I'm capable of.
[time=940] Sometimes I'll think about what I'm even struggling with, maybe even that day or at that moment.
[time=946] And there are times when, even though I want so badly to be used of him, and even though I understand what it means to be a good vessel, there are times when I don't feel like a good vessel.
[time=957] And maybe there are people in the room this morning and you've experienced failure and you know what it's like to have not measured up.
[time=964] And maybe like me sometimes you don't feel like you can really be used of God.
[time=969] Maybe like me sometimes you feel more like this.
[time=984] [MUSIC]
[time=991] Over and over will it never end?
[time=997] Picking myself up and falling again.
[time=1003] I look in the mirror and what do I see?
[time=1008] A picture of failure just staring at me.
[time=1013] But in you I see the face of forgiveness, eyes of compassion.
[time=1022] A picture of grace that you see me and you know me.
[time=1030] And yet you love me and you show me that no matter my place,
[time=1038] I'm never far from the face of forgiveness.
[time=1045] [MUSIC]
[time=1057] All I can see when I'm fixed on myself is a sinner who's wandered beyond your health.
[time=1067] Then your words of wisdom come rushing to me.
[time=1072] There's no condemnation for those who believe in you.
[time=1080] I see the face of forgiveness, eyes of compassion.
[time=1087] A picture of grace that you see me and you know me.
[time=1094] And yet you love me and you show me that no matter my place,
[time=1103] I'm never far from the face of forgiveness.
[time=1109] [MUSIC]
[time=1113] No matter what I've done, no matter who I've become.
[time=1124] Nothing can separate me from your boundless love.
[time=1131] In you I see the face of forgiveness, eyes of compassion.
[time=1145] A picture of grace that you see me and you know me.
[time=1152] And yet you love me and you show me that no matter my place,
[time=1160] I'm never far from the face of forgiveness.
[time=1168] No matter my place, I'm never far from the face of forgiveness.
[time=1183] [MUSIC]
[time=1198] Well thank you Joe.
[time=1199] What a powerful song, what a powerful truth.
[time=1202] Praise God for forgiveness, amen.
[time=1205] And the opportunity to move forward.
[time=1208] And what a joy it is to be able to welcome all of you this morning.
[time=1212] We're so thankful that you're here and we want to welcome you back to week two in a series that we've entitled Meet the Cast.
[time=1219] Meet the Cast, these four individuals that we see so actively involved in this unfolding drama of the Passion of the Christ.
[time=1227] I may need to just make an apology here.
[time=1230] There was a couple of phone calls and maybe a few notes this week.
[time=1233] And I hope none of you have felt this, but if you did my apologies.
[time=1237] I guess there were some who thought we were really bringing the cast.
[time=1241] Here to Fort Wayne for four weeks and we've been accused of deceit
[time=1247] and promotional, you know, wrongdoings.
[time=1251] And I just hope you understand our heart in that.
[time=1253] We tried to be really clear that we were just going to like study about the cast.
[time=1257] And we don't know Jim Caviesel or Mia Morgan Sturm or I don't even know who played evil.
[time=1263] But anyway, I guess some thought they were actually going to show up.
[time=1266] And so anyway, just understand our heart and our intent was to introduce you and/or further help you see those individuals in their biblical setting.
[time=1275] So welcome to Meet the Cast.
[time=1278] And this morning, our cast member is an individual who knew some things about failure.
[time=1283] He knew what it was like to fall short, to choose wrong, over right, to not measure up.
[time=1289] This morning we come to the one named Peter.
[time=1292] Peter.
[time=1293] "Cafos," as he was called by our Lord and his friends in the vernacular of that day.
[time=1300] "Cafos," and what a story Peter has.
[time=1303] Following our outline from last week, let's look.
[time=1306] First of all, Peter's connection.
[time=1308] If you're writing that down, the cast member is Peter.
[time=1311] The connection is that he was, excuse me, a disciple.
[time=1318] A disciple.
[time=1321] Peter was one of the twelve that lived with and ministered with and walked closely with Jesus himself.
[time=1331] I'll be all right.
[time=1332] I just yelled a little too loud and a little too long at the game.
[time=1336] Peter was one who lived and walked with Jesus for approximately three years, day in and day out.
[time=1344] I want you to think about that here as we start out.
[time=1347] This was an individual who knew the Lord Jesus Christ, who walked with him, who listened to him, who went everywhere with him.
[time=1357] If you'll see, if you'll take note up on the screen there, there's an asterisk next to disciple.
[time=1362] Many of you in the room probably know this.
[time=1364] Others of you, this might be new news to, but the fact of the matter was is that Peter wasn't just a disciple.
[time=1371] Peter was in fact one of the three.
[time=1374] Did you know that? There were twelve disciples, but as you read through the Gospels and as you see the relationship that our Lord had with these individuals played out, you come to realize very quickly that Peter, James and John were very, very special to him.
[time=1390] He loved all of them, but there was a special relationship that Jesus extended to Peter.
[time=1396] Peter had been allowed into a relational sphere of intimacy that the others had not.
[time=1402] He knew him, he walked with him, he lived with him, he saw him minister, but he knew him and the Lord knew Peter and there were experiences there and there was relationship built there that was really unique.
[time=1416] Now let's look back and let's see, open your Bibles to Matthew 4.
[time=1420] Let's go back to where it all began.
[time=1422] You can kind of find an account of this and all in most of the Gospels.
[time=1426] Let's turn to Matthew 4 this morning and let's see and look at where this special relationship between Peter and our Lord started.
[time=1434] Matthew 4, we'll start in verse 18 and in honor of God's Word, would you stand with me this morning and let me read this to you and then we'll move on.
[time=1446] It says in Matthew 4 18, "Now as Jesus was walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who was called Peter, and Andrew, his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen, and he said to them, 'Follow me and I will make you fishers of men.'" Immediately, verse 20, note that, immediately they left their nets and followed him.
[time=1474] Going on from there he saw two other brothers, James, the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother, in the boat with Zebedee, their father, mending their nets and he called them. Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.
[time=1490] Pray with me, would you father as we come to this study today and as we come to this look into this man's life and his heart, and his relationship with you, God I pray that every single person in this room would be willing to open our hearts, that we would open our minds that you would in a special way, God open our eyes to the life changing eternity altering truth of your word.
[time=1514] God, as we learn lessons from this man's failure, may we be so quick and so ready to identify with our own failure and see where it is, God, how it is that you would want us to respond, the road you would want us to walk, grow us, we pray, teach us, in your son's name we pray.
[time=1534] Amen. You can be seated. Couple of things.
[time=1538] Couple of things, thank you, Eric, that we should take note of here as you think about that Matthew 4 passage and you can just jot these down. I don't think that they'll come up on the screen, but you might want to jot him down. Number one, what does he tell them he's going to make them? He says come with me and I will make you what? What does he say? He says I'm going to make you fishers of men, see they were fishermen, they caught fish. He says no, you come with me.
[time=1566] Follow me and I will turn you into something else, but I want you to know you wouldn't see this, but I want you to see what I found as you look at the Greek.
[time=1574] I was talking with a friend this week who pointed this out to me when you look at the literal original translation. In the Greek that sentence would read like this, if we were literally translating it, it would read, follow me, I will make you to become fishers of men. And you may hear that and go, so what's the big deal? Well just think about it. He's saying follow me, not I will make you now fishers of men, literally in the Greek it means follow me and I will make you to become in time.
[time=1606] By virtue of the way it said it identifies the fact that there is a process. When the Lord calls us to follow him, when he calls us to do that he is calling us to a process, perfectionists in the room. This one's for you. It isn't something that happens.
[time=1626] It's not an event, it's a journey.
[time=1630] You with me? Full surrender salvation. You and I coming to this place where we draw a line in the sand we put a stake in the ground and we say I'm in, I believe, I give you my heart and my life. That is an event.
[time=1646] There is a time and place where you and I hopefully do that.
[time=1650] What he does with us from that point forward, how it is that he matures us, how it is that he grows us. This road called sanctification that following him is a process.
[time=1662] It is a spiritual journey, a road filled with many, an up and many, a down.
[time=1670] Lessons learned.
[time=1674] That's encouraging for me. I can't begin to tell you how encouraged I am.
[time=1678] Especially when I spend time with older believers.
[time=1682] It is so encouraging for me to hear it 41.
[time=1686] I'll hear somebody at 65 saying that they just learned something.
[time=1690] Does that help anybody out in here?
[time=1694] Or am I the only one that gets encouraged by that? It's great being around Steve Longbreak.
[time=1698] Not that he's old and he's not here to defend himself. So it's okay.
[time=1702] Steve's like, I don't know, going toward his mid-50s and he'll say it all the time. He'll say I wish I knew when I was 45.
[time=1710] I wish I knew at 48 what I learned at 52.
[time=1714] And I'm reminded by the Lord's words himself that it is a process and what a process it was for Peter.
[time=1726] What an amazing journey he found himself on.
[time=1730] Secondly, with that Matthew 4 passage in mind before we move on, just jot this down.
[time=1734] I want you to take note at how they responded. How did they respond?
[time=1738] And he said to them, follow me, and I will make you fishers of men. And they thought about it for a day.
[time=1746] Is that what your text says? They said, hey, you know what? We'll get back to you. No. Please take note that their response to follow him was immediate. And not just immediate, but look what it entailed. It says they left their nets.
[time=1762] You see that? Look at that. It says, it says immediately they left their nets and followed.
[time=1770] In the Greek, this phrase is recorded in the arised tense. It's the past tense. You say, who cares? Well, just stay with me on this. Whenever you see the arised tense in the Greek, it always denotes something past, but not just something past. It is an act done once and for all. It is a once and for all action. It's done here and that's that. It's over.
[time=1794] These guys immediately following, these guys immediately leaving their nets. Their nets, that was their livelihood. That's what they, that's what they used to do, right? You with me? They left what they used to do.
[time=1814] Left and they walked this way. Where are the nets at this point in time? Back there. And they are now walking a new path. They are now on a new journey and they have completely and they have absolutely, they have fully surrendered. That's why we always say fully surrendered. And I raised this to you this morning because I oftentimes find myself in conversations or I'll hear things that in a way concern me because I think sometimes this relationship with Christ, sometimes this spiritual journey that we invite you to. I think there are times when maybe some of us feel as if it's kind of a kind of a partial surrender thing. And see, it's not. He said, "Leave your nets and follow me." And I get a little concern sometimes because I'll hear people say this. I'll hear people kind of claim this and as they walk along, I can't help but notice, if I can say it this way, some nets kind of dragging behind if that makes sense. It's not the ticket.
[time=1886] He said, "Come follow me." Completely, absolutely, wholeheartedly, fully.
[time=1894] And they left their nets over here.
[time=1898] Everything. Yeah, even that.
[time=1902] And many in the room this morning as we say that you're thinking, "Yeah, but I don't know if I can. You know what you can." And in a moment we're going to get to some things about him that'll allow you to see that you really can leave it.
[time=1918] Well, that's what he did. That's what our friend Peter did. He followed Christ sometimes with great strength and conviction while at other times we see him stumble badly. He walks with Jesus literally. He sees miracle after miracle.
[time=1930] Here's the word of God spoken by the Son of God. He, he sees lives transformed, sinners turn to faith. He sees the broken healed, the proud rebuked. He sees it all. He takes it all in. He's revered by many. He's looked to and respected by the crowds and by the disciples themselves. And then Jesus, his friend, then Jesus, his Lord is arrested.
[time=1954] We see it in the pages of Scripture. You've seen it in the movie. Jesus is taken captive. The Son of Man comes to the last 12 hours of his earthly life. Jesus, the discipler who had given so much to Peter.
[time=1966] Jesus, the mentor who had deposited so many things into his life. Jesus, Messiah, comes to this place of torment and sacrifice and pain and the disciple, Peter.
[time=1978] Peter mean Kefos in the original language, meaning the what?
[time=1982] The rock in his Lord's greatest hour of earthly need and trial. The rock doesn't stand up. He bails. He's gone.
[time=2002] He folds like a tent. He doesn't step up. He steps away.
[time=2006] Fear and confusion. The one who said, "I will never leave you." The one who said, "I will never deny you." The one who in essence said, "I will never do that." Anybody in the room this morning identify with that?
[time=2026] "I will never do that." Did it.
[time=2034] He did it. He walks.
[time=2038] Boy, did he walk. Why? Well, here's the character trait for you. You can write it down, people.
[time=2046] You see, Peter, he struggled with this a lot and we'll talk about that. Peter was, and he was in this moment there in the courtyard as Jesus faced his accusers. He was fearful. Go ahead and write that down.
[time=2058] He was fearful. He was afraid. He was scared to death. I believe it's true. I believe he was petrified, unwilling to stand up and be counted. You think for a moment there in the garden that he's going to step up, right?
[time=2074] He grabs the sword. He walks that guy's ear off.
[time=2078] It looks like, "Okay, Peter's going to..." And then he just doesn't. There's an initial burst of courage and then there is just this immediate slide into utter failure. I think of Matthew 26.
[time=2094] Let's look at that together. Matthew 26.
[time=2098] Go to verse 69.
[time=2102] Matthew 26.
[time=2106] We'll pick it up in verse 69.
[time=2110] The Lord has been arrested. He has come before Caiaphas. He has faced his accusers.
[time=2118] The beating has already started. Now Peter, verse 69, was sitting outside in the courtyard and a servant girl came to him and said, "You too! You! You were with Jesus the Galilean." He denied it. Before them all saying, "I do not know what you were talking about." Verse 70, he denies it.
[time=2138] 71, when he had gone out to the gateway, another servant girl saw him and said to those who were there, "This man, this man right here was with Jesus of Nazareth." And again he denied it, this time with an oath.
[time=2154] First he denies it. Second time he denies it and he puts something on there. He puts an oath out there. It was a very big deal in those days. He makes an oath. He says, "I do not know him." It's what you would do if you wanted to really get serious with somebody and really make your point. I put an oath on it.
[time=2174] A little later, the bystanders came up and said to Peter, "Surely you too are one of them. For even the way you talk gives you away." Then he began to curse and swear, "I do not know the man." First he denies it. Then he puts an oath on it. Now he is so angry. Now he is so frazzled. He's cursing and swearing his denial.
[time=2202] You ever been that aggressive in your sin?
[time=2206] You ever been that aggressive in your denial? Have you ever just been so committed?
[time=2214] No committed to what was wrong that you just lost all sense and you end up fighting for it.
[time=2226] He did. He went that far and immediately a rooster crowed.
[time=2234] Wow. What must that have been like? To have been him at that moment.
[time=2242] And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said before a rooster crows you will deny me three times. And he went out and wept bitterly.
[time=2254] I believe he was afraid.
[time=2258] I think in the moment in the face of all that was transpiring I believe he was afraid. You believe he was afraid? Yes or no?
[time=2266] Yes, I believe he was afraid. I believe he was really really afraid.
[time=2270] You really afraid? Yes or no? Yes, I believe he was really afraid.
[time=2274] See what you and I have to see this morning is what is always behind the fear. There's a bigger issue here. There really is.
[time=2282] And whether it's Peter's fear, whether it's your fear or my fear, you see there is a root issue here.
[time=2290] There is something underneath the fear that is really, really ugly and really, really detrimental.
[time=2298] Let me illustrate it to you this way.
[time=2302] I think it's so cool. And you may see this with your kids.
[time=2306] Maybe you don't have kids, you got nieces and nephews. Maybe you've got grand kids and you see it with them. But you know what? It's so amazing to me how different kids are. And you get one or two or three or four or five going and you realize there's a few that are like her and then there are some that are like you. And it's so interesting.
[time=2326] I mean, it's all good. It's just so interesting to see how it plays out.
[time=2330] If you were to come into our home and get to know our family, you would see that Russell T.
[time=2334] are 12-year-old and Madison are 6-year-old. They're the two redheads.
[time=2338] They are extremely cautious. They are very, very, very careful. There is not a lot of risk taking with them. They like to hear the agenda.
[time=2350] We were in the car yesterday and Madison was already wanting me to lay out for her the details of our upcoming spring break trip. She wanted to know departure times. She needed to know arrival times. She wanted to know a packing schedule. And me being the organized wonder that I am had absolutely nothing to say to her. Madison and Russell, very cautious like their mother. I know that's a shock.
[time=2378] Now, on the other side, you got Wesley and Jake.
[time=2382] They were eight-year-old and Jake's the three-year-old, almost four.
[time=2386] And let me just tell you a little bit about Wesley. If Wesley were sitting here right now, and I said to Wes, I said, hey Wes, if she was sitting right there, I said, why don't you just run up there real quick, walk along the rail of the balcony, come over to the rail there, climb over, and I'm going to walk down the middle here and you just jump and I'll catch you. She would grin from ear to ear as I was saying it to her.
[time=2410] And as soon as I'm done, she would get up and she would run up those stairs and she would go right to that rail. There is not a ledge too high for her.
[time=2418] There is not a leap too far. She will do anything.
[time=2422] And I realized part of that and part of why she would do this, I mean, she might not really do that, but actually she might.
[time=2430] You know, she could. It wouldn't put it past her. But here's the deal.
[time=2434] Here's the deal. She would, and I want you to catch this, she would climb up on that rail right there. And I could stand right here and I would say, okay, sweetie, jump. And I want you to know, she would more than likely climb over that rail, balance herself and she would jump and she would have no concept of what about, you know, what was about to take place. She would have no thought as to what was at stake. She would have no realization really of the risk because all she really fundamentally would see and know is that who is standing right there? Her what?
[time=2474] Her father.
[time=2478] And I admit she has a warped view of me.
[time=2482] All right? I am not all she cracks me up to be. Okay, but having said that, let me say this to you. I would catch her.
[time=2490] You understand that? I would catch that little girl.
[time=2494] I would not get hurt. I would catch her and you know what? There's something about Wesley and there's something about her relationship with me. She knows it.
[time=2502] She has a really decent, really big view of her father.
[time=2510] Does that make sense?
[time=2514] There isn't anything she can say. There's no trial.
[time=2518] There's no struggle. There's no issue. There is nothing hurt, little eight-year-old mind that her dad can't handle.
[time=2530] And what is beneath your fear and mind so many times is a really, really weak view of God. You have and I have at times really diminished him because you and I as we say, okay, I'm leaving the nets and here I am, I'm going to follow Christ and we start going down this road and all of a sudden, boom, we hit this. Whatever circumstance this is, and we go, wait a minute, hold on, time out.
[time=2562] We're back to some of the stuff we talked about with Mary last week and to follow him and to love him and to trust him would mean that you and I would be willing to crawl up on the rail. Whatever this is and say, you know what God, you are so much bigger than this.
[time=2582] See, I can't tell you how many people I've sat with. I cannot begin to tell you how many people I've counseled with. I can't begin to tell you how many times my heart has been broken because people like you and I, they get to points like this and they may have even come through a few things to get here, but then they get here and they say no.
[time=2598] No.
[time=2602] You're not that big.
[time=2606] They climb off the rail and they walk back across the balcony and they come and they sit down and they say, not me. I'm not jumping.
[time=2616] How is your view of God?
[time=2620] And you know what, this wasn't a new struggle for Peter.
[time=2624] You don't have to turn there. I mean, you can if you'd like, but I'll just reference it for you this morning.
[time=2628] You can write this down, Matthew 14. Does that mean anything to anybody?
[time=2632] Matthew 14, this was not a new struggle to Peter, folks.
[time=2636] In Matthew 14, the disciples, they're all in this little boat and they're out in the middle and the winds come and the waves come and it gets dark and cloudy and the lightning thum. It's just like an absolute storm.
[time=2648] Am I jogging your memory? And all these disciples are all in this little boat and they're all absolutely getting ready to just cash it in. They're just sure that it's going to be over and all of a sudden Jesus comes. Their Lord comes walking on the water, remember? And in the midst of all the turmoil, all of a sudden, who's the first one to say, hey, we're going to be good? It's Peter and he goes, Lord, command me to come and I'll come to you and the Lord says, Peter, come and Peter crawls over the rail. And Dad's standing right down here underneath. Peter crawls over the rail and he jumps and it goes well there for a moment. He starts to walk on the water with his eyes. He brews 12 fixed on who? Fixed on Jesus, the author and perfecter of his faith.
[time=2700] And with his eyes fixed with his view in good condition he walks on water, then all of a sudden he gets a little afraid and he looks where and he begins to what?
[time=2712] And I would guess there are people in this room this morning who are sinking.
[time=2716] I believe there's probably even more folks in this room who remember what it's like to have sunk. That feeling that reality that takes over when our view of God begins to be diminished. When we begin to view ourselves, when we begin to focus on circumstantial evidence rather than how absolutely huge he is, how unbelievably big he is and how deeply he is committed to you.
[time=2756] Anybody here ever struggled with a small view of God?
[time=2760] Anyone here ever allowed fear to overshadow your faith?
[time=2764] Anybody here ever chose to run or give in instead of standing strong? Anybody here ever chosen happiness over holding on? Maybe somebody here has fallen.
[time=2776] Temptation has triumphed.
[time=2780] Maybe a weak view of God has led to a heart that today is full of remorse and shame. Maybe you're feeling like this.
[time=2788] Maybe there's somebody in the room this morning and you're feeling like this. You're feeling like a broken piece of pottery.
[time=2800] And you like me at times ask the question, is there any hope?
[time=2804] Can he really use me? Can I really be useful? Can anything meaningful or significant or God honoring ever come out of something so absolutely broken? Full of fault and failure.
[time=2820] Let me read you something.
[time=2824] Turn there if you would. Acts chapter 2.
[time=2828] I want you just to think about it. I want you to hear this.
[time=2832] I hope you've got a Bible if you don't look on. I want you to see what happens.
[time=2836] I want to answer that question for you. Can God use something like this? Can God use an utter failure like Peter who absolutely bailed? He absolutely stepped away. He did not respond in faithfulness and honor. No.
[time=2852] He turned and ran the other direction.
[time=2856] And yeah, look what happens. Go to Acts 2.
[time=2860] Look at verse 22.
[time=2864] Acts 2-22. All right, before you look at that, look up here. This is on the city streets of Jerusalem. This is just a few months after, at most, you know, maybe a few weeks have transpired since Christ has ascended.
[time=2880] And remember, he told them, he said, now you're it. I want you to go and make disciples. I want you to go and baptize. I want you to go and teach them all them, the world, all that I've commanded you.
[time=2892] And they huddle up in that room and we saw Mary there with them last week praying. And you know, and I know they were probably scared, but the Holy Spirit comes and brings the gift and all of a sudden, boom, they're ready to go.
[time=2904] And verse 22, men of Peter, Peter, you ready? Men of Israel, he says, he stands up on the block and it's time to be counted. Listen to these words, Jesus the Nazarene, a man attested to you by God with miracles and wonders and signs which God performed through him in your midst just as you yourselves know, this man delivered over by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God, you nailed to a cross by the hands of godless men and put him to death. But God raised him up again, putting an end to the agony of death since it was impossible for him to be held in its power.
[time=2944] Brethren, I may, verse 29, Brethren, I may, what's your Bible say?
[time=2948] Mine says confidently, this is Peter, people.
[time=2952] This is this right here saying as loud as he can to as many as would listen, I may confidently say to you regarding the patriarch David that he both died and was buried and his tomb is with us to this day and so because he was a prophet and knew that God had sworn to him with an oath to seat one of his descendants on his throne he looked ahead and spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that he was neither abandoned to Hades nor did his flesh suffer decay.
[time=2980] This Jesus God raised up, therefore 36, therefore let all the house of Israel know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.
[time=2996] He's not running now.
[time=3000] The view of God has been addressed. Now when they heard this they were pierced to the heart and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, brethren, what shall we do? Peter said to them repent and each of you be baptized. And look at verse 40 and with many others.
[time=3016] And with many other words he solemnly testified and kept on exhorting them saying be saved from this perverse generation so then those who had received his word were baptized and that day there were added about 3,000 souls.
[time=3032] How's he doing?
[time=3036] You know what you should do tonight? You should go home tonight and you should read 1 Peter and 2 Peter. It is not a long read.
[time=3044] You could do it in half an hour, 20 minutes. Just familiarize yourself with this utter failure.
[time=3052] Familiarize yourself with this guy who when the chips were down he just didn't have, he wouldn't step up.
[time=3060] Familiarize yourselves again with this picture of him denying the Lord. And then just pick up your Bible tonight. And before you go to bed read 1 Peter and 2 Peter and be absolutely in awe of what God did.
[time=3080] He took this scared coward and turned him in to an absolute, he gave him confidence. He gave him courage.
[time=3092] He changed him completely.
[time=3096] Do it. Would you read 1 Peter and 2 Peter?
[time=3100] And you know what else you need to do?
[time=3104] Here's a challenge for you. Confess your fear.
[time=3108] Please don't miss this. Write this down.
[time=3112] Here's a challenge for you. Confess your fear.
[time=3116] I say confess. You say, well wait a minute. You say confess.
[time=3120] That makes it sound like it's a sin. Well you know what?
[time=3124] It is. You and I are in sin.
[time=3128] When we embrace such a pathetic view of God that in the face of whatever trial or difficulty we may be encountering. We choose to back up instead of going forward.
[time=3144] It says in 2 Timothy 1. 2 Timothy 1 verses 7 and 8. I believe it's going to come on the screen for you. 2 Timothy 1 verses 7 and 8. For God has not given us a spirit of timidity.
[time=3160] Amen. For God has not given us a spirit of timidity.
[time=3164] But of power and love and discipline. Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord or of me as prisoner. But join with me in suffering for the gospel.
[time=3176] According to the power of God. People, you've got God.
[time=3180] People, you have got God.
[time=3184] Not me to jump to. You have got a heavenly Father who was waiting and willing and so able to catch you.
[time=3196] No matter where you've been, no matter what you've done he can bring forgiveness if you ask and he can build into you courage and a willingness to jump every single time.
[time=3208] Corbin and Joe, would you guys come back up?
[time=3212] Let me just encourage you that are out there this morning.
[time=3216] Whoever you are, walk away from your destructive lifestyle relationships, he'll be enough. Trust him.
[time=3224] Love your wife, men. Love your wife with tenacity and consistency. Don't worry about what she should do or what might happen if you fully give yourself to her. He'll catch you. Love her.
[time=3236] Live a distinctively God-honoring life.
[time=3240] Middle school students. Senior high students.
[time=3244] Young adults. Married. Moms, dads, grandparents.
[time=3248] Live a distinctively God-honoring life.
[time=3252] Don't be afraid. Speak up if you need to lovingly take a stand if that's what's necessary. Don't compromise.
[time=3260] And if you're here this morning and you're seeking, if you're here this morning and you're not yet in that life-changing relationship with our Lord Jesus Christ, can I just say this to you? You will never ever know. You will never ever know the peace and the comfort that my daughter knows in her heart.
[time=3280] That picture of her and me, if that meant something to you, understand you will only find that in life. You will only find that in the arms of your loving Heavenly Father who gave His Son so that you could have life. Listen, as Joe and Corbin close us with this song that they started us with, and I'll come back and close us here in just a minute.
[time=3306] Over and over, will it never end?
[time=3320] Picking myself up and falling again.
[time=3326] I look in the mirror, what do I see?
[time=3331] A picture of failure, just staring at me.
[time=3337] But in me, I see the face of forgiveness as of compassion.
[time=3346] A picture of grace, and you see me, and you know me.
[time=3353] And yet you love me, and you show hold me.
[time=3359] There's been no matter my place, I've never fought from the face of forgiveness.
[time=3389] Would you stand with me this morning?
[time=3392] And as Corbin continues to play, let me just ask you this, with your heads bowed and your eyes closed.
[time=3398] There may be many in the room today, and you know what it's like as I describe this broken piece of pottery.
[time=3407] You, like me, would long to be a vessel worthy of good use.
[time=3413] And isn't it encouraging today to be reminded that he picks up these broken pieces, you and me?
[time=3422] And he puts us back together in a sense, you know, we're never going to be all the way back, right?
[time=3428] But for now, this side of glory, he takes broken pieces and he allows them to be usable when you're willing
[time=3437] to, with grace and humility, admit your need.
[time=3442] And so this morning, if you need any help with that, let us know.
[time=3446] We'd love to talk with you.
[time=3449] How grateful I am that he uses broken pieces, and how grateful I am one day that it'll all get put back together.
[time=3458] Praise God. Amen.
[time=3460] Father, we thank you for this morning, and we pray, God, that we would learn from our failure.
[time=3467] God, maybe if there's one thing that we would take away from today, it would be God that the need that each of us
[time=3473] probably has to some degree, to expand and enrich and deepen our view of you.
[time=3480] And that happens as we understand you better, as we see you more clearly, and God, that is found in your word.
[time=3488] And so draw us to it every day.
[time=3490] God, continue to move us back to a place of devotion and time spent with you.
[time=3496] God, allow us to meet people and allow us to come into contact with those who would help us understand
[time=3502] and see you more fully.
[time=3505] God, as you grow our view of you, give us the courage to confess our sin, to confess our fear,
[time=3514] and to commit before you to move forward in obedience whatever that might look like.
[time=3520] God, we thank you for Kefas, for Peter, and how he stayed at it, and how you changed him.
[time=3530] God changed us. We pray. In your son's name we pray. Amen.
