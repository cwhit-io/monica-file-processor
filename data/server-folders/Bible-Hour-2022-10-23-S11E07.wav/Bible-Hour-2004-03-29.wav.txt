[time=299] Hi, I'm Mitch, teaching pastor at Blackhawk Ministries, and I want to thank you for joining us as we celebrate Resurrection Sunday, the resurrection of Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[time=310] And with me today is my very good friend, Jorge Tobo, and Jorge is part of our Spanish-speaking ministries here at Blackhawk.
[time=322] And to my Spanish-speaking friends, hi, I'm Mitch.
[time=326] Hi, I'm Mitch, teaching pastor at Blackhawk Ministries, and I would like to invite you to Blackhawk Ministries every Sunday.
[time=340] And at 1045, we have radios available for Spanish-speaking individuals who can listen to our sermons live as Jorge interprets them.
[time=369] I want to thank you for joining us. I want to thank you for joining us.
[time=378] So please, if you're a Spanish-speaking person, so support for what you want to do, please join us every Sunday at Blackhawk Ministries.
[time=390] Thank you for joining us for the healing and healing of Blackhawk Ministries.
[time=396] I want to thank you for joining us. I want to thank you for joining us for joining us.
[time=401] I want to thank you for joining us. I want to thank you for joining us for the healing and healing of Blackhawk Ministries.
[time=411] Thank you so much for joining us, and I'd like to just share a few other things with you.
[time=417] First of all, Kelly invited you last week, and I just want to invite you again.
[time=421] There's still time this morning to come to our Easter services, 9 a.m. and 1045, please come and join us.
[time=429] If you've been part of our family and you don't have a home church, we just love for you to come and celebrate this important date in our history and our tradition.
[time=441] Because the Apostle Paul writes in 1 Corinthians 15-17, "If Jesus didn't resurrect, then our belief is in vain,
[time=448] and we know that he resurrected from the dead, so come celebrate with us today." Secondly, I'd like to invite you to our upcoming Off the Map conference.
[time=459] It's an evangelism conference that is really outside the box.
[time=463] It will include interviews with three lost people.
[time=466] Speaking of Jim Henderson, the founder of Off the Map, and Brian McLaren, author of a new kind of Christian,
[time=473] you will not want to miss this. Just visit our website and follow the link to Off the Map.
[time=479] And finally, today's message is the third in a four-part series entitled Meet the Cast.
[time=486] It's a scriptural look at the Passion of the Christ.
[time=490] And you've heard Kelly's message on Mary, Peter, and today you'll hear my message on the Devil,
[time=498] and how we sin, and how he tempts us in three ways.
[time=504] And so this message is entitled Learning How to Resist Temptation.
[time=508] Thank you so much for joining us. Happy Easter, and have a wonderful day, and we hope to see you.
[time=514] If you come, please say hello.
[time=517] It causes us to come to him in his state of total humility.
[time=522] And he doesn't ask about something that is foreign to him because Christ, when he came to this earth,
[time=531] God himself, was so humble in the fact that he came at all, and in the fact that he took on flashing blood,
[time=544] was a humiliating state for him, and that he became obedient to the death that humans subscribe for him or prescribed.
[time=559] It's an amazing miracle every time that we sing or stand or breathe in the presence of God
[time=566] because we should be swallowed up in his holiness and his all-consuming fire.
[time=596] We should come ever true and pound by, not consumed by the fire around you.
[time=617] Don't forget to pour and laugh, fall and flesh out through the blood of Jesus Christ,
[time=636] freely I have come to heal before the highest stone.
[time=649] I have been humbled at a ration that that I could ever hold to you, the Lord of all creativity.
[time=679] Without a flame, feel free in your side, holy, as you're in, with confidence to the place of me.
[time=708] We should pour and pound, fall and flesh out through the blood of Jesus Christ, freely I have come to heal before the highest stone.
[time=737] I have been humbled at a ration, not that I could ever hold to you, the Lord of all.
[time=788] We should pour and pound, fall and flesh out through the blood of Jesus Christ,
[time=817] freely I have come.
[time=835] God, thank you for the freedom that we have to approach your throne.
[time=846] Your word says about us that once you are enemies in your minds because of your evil behavior.
[time=855] But now God has reconciled you by Christ's physical body through death to present you holy in his sight without blemishing free from accusation.
[time=877] [AMEN]
[time=884] I'm Mitch, I'm a teaching pastor, I volunteer here full-time to teach and do a thing called Common Ground and to help with evangelism and outreach.
[time=898] And today you're here on the series of Meet the Cast, where the cast member is the devil.
[time=906] And I was kind of prepared in the preparation for this week for a little extra temptation.
[time=911] And first is my four-year-old daughter lied in front of the witnesses of the other family for the first time ever.
[time=921] My five-and-a-half-month-old girl totally in my care alone, my custody fell off our bed because she's learned a role while I was in the closet.
[time=933] And I bumped my head real hard, so I tell you what, if we ever do this again, Kelly gets the devil and I get Jesus.
[time=941] All right.
[time=943] I'd like you to imagine that you're a pastor.
[time=948] And let's just say you're a pastor at a Midwestern church and spring break is coming and you're going to drive your five kids and your wife to Florida.
[time=959] And so you get your, let's just say, silver, Yukon, you get it serviced and you load everybody up and your head south.
[time=968] A little less than two hours into the trip, your oldest son, let's say, plugs his portable computer into the power source and the rear of the vehicle.
[time=976] And all of a sudden the vehicle goes, and comes to a stop.
[time=982] But let's say you're not just an average Midwestern pastor, you're big and strong, you're, say, six-seven.
[time=988] And you got muscles, you know, and you can pull that thing over to the shoulder and have no problems.
[time=993] And let's just say you got an on-star button and you press that.
[time=997] And after 45 minutes, the local car dealership around Indianapolis comes and takes your family away and leaves you.
[time=1003] Let's just say, you know, you're the pastor there.
[time=1005] You have two hours to think about it all.
[time=1010] Let's just say then the tow truck comes and gets the car and you're the pastor and it's your car and you come back to the dealership.
[time=1015] And you wait another two and a half hours changing diapers and dealing with your five children and your wife and waiting for the chief technician to come out and tell you this.
[time=1025] I have good news and bad news.
[time=1028] Well, being a six-seven strong pastor, you want to hear the bad news first.
[time=1034] Give me the bad news.
[time=1036] The chief technician responds, you're out of gas.
[time=1041] [ Laughter ]
[time=1048] Don't worry, it gets better.
[time=1055] [ Laughter ] To which the senior, I'm sorry, to which the pastor, I didn't do that on purpose.
[time=1063] To which the pastor responds, no, no, no, he's a mechanical man, not.
[time=1070] To which he responds, no, no, no, you don't understand, Mr. Mechanic.
[time=1073] The car went, hmm.
[time=1076] To which the chief mechanic says, pastor, that's what a car does when it's out of gas.
[time=1082] [ Laughter ] And the pastor said, but wait a minute.
[time=1088] [ Laughter ] The gas gauge wasn't quite fully to the left of E.
[time=1095] [ Laughter ] And the miles too empty said 45.
[time=1102] To which the technician responds, that's kind of the good news.
[time=1106] Your gas gauge is broken.
[time=1108] [ Laughter ] And so I want to ask you today, I got so many things going.
[time=1118] What's your greatest temptation?
[time=1124] And what have you done to resist it?
[time=1127] Because for some, the great temptation is to push things to the limit and take them as far as they would possibly go
[time=1133] and run that gas tank and just see what would happen.
[time=1137] But here's the point.
[time=1139] Whatever that temptation is, you and I, every single person in this room, we have broken gas gauges.
[time=1149] And I want to illustrate that.
[time=1150] So Tim, you want to come on up, buddy?
[time=1153] I got a helper here.
[time=1155] Tim Howard is a fifth grader.
[time=1158] Let's see what we got going on here.
[time=1161] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[time=1162] I got to check the balance of the ball.
[time=1163] Okay, it's good.
[time=1164] Oh, oh, oh, you're supposed to be ready.
[time=1166] Okay, here we go.
[time=1167] Tim, you ready?
[time=1169] Temptation is temptation to sin.
[time=1172] Sin is any life apart from God.
[time=1176] An attempt at any life apart from God.
[time=1179] It's desiring life apart from God.
[time=1181] And we all have broken gas gauges.
[time=1183] So Tim, you're 11 and you're a fifth grader and you got a sister.
[time=1187] She's pretty good basketball, right?
[time=1189] Yeah.
[time=1190] I just want to see what you would do.
[time=1193] And can you beat her?
[time=1195] Yeah.
[time=1196] All right, so you can beat your sister.
[time=1198] Okay, here's what I want you to do.
[time=1199] I just want you to shoot and make it.
[time=1203] Nice.
[time=1204] Oh, I need a rebounder.
[time=1206] Yeah, there we go.
[time=1207] Oh, one more thing.
[time=1208] You're the opposing team.
[time=1210] You know, it's final four week.
[time=1212] How many people watch final four?
[time=1214] How many people going to watch it Monday night?
[time=1216] Yeah, I'm thinking about giving up myself.
[time=1218] All right, so you're the opposing team.
[time=1221] So you got to make some noise.
[time=1223] All right, I'll go ahead and shoot again, Tim.
[time=1226] Oh, that is pathetic.
[time=1228] Did you go to the state championship?
[time=1230] Give it all you got.
[time=1231] Here we go.
[time=1232] Nice.
[time=1233] Oh, I need some help, Dean.
[time=1236] Thank you.
[time=1237] All right, let's do it again.
[time=1239] Guys, you need to be louder.
[time=1240] You're a little too close.
[time=1242] All right.
[time=1243] Go.
[time=1244] Oh.
[time=1246] What happened?
[time=1247] He missed.
[time=1248] And that's the most frequent picture of sin in the Bible is we have broken gas gauges so no matter what we do.
[time=1258] Whether we try to hit a hole in one, whether we try to hit a hundred mile an hour fastball, whatever it is, a serve in tennis, we will never get it right all the time.
[time=1267] We have broken gas gauges.
[time=1268] We missed the mark.
[time=1270] The first way we sinned.
[time=1271] Second way we sinned, don't shoot yet, is.
[time=1275] Okay, go ahead and shoot, guys.
[time=1280] Oh, I'll let you get that.
[time=1282] Okay.
[time=1283] He missed, right?
[time=1285] Tell him you made it.
[time=1287] I made it.
[time=1289] With, with, with convince, you know, like, I made it.
[time=1292] I made it.
[time=1293] Oh.
[time=1294] That's good.
[time=1296] That's the second way we sinned.
[time=1299] Is that we miss, but we tell everybody we made it.
[time=1302] We twist the wrong to make it right.
[time=1306] We justify.
[time=1307] Well, there's a third way.
[time=1309] All right.
[time=1310] There's a third way.
[time=1311] And that would be just kind of missing on purpose.
[time=1313] It's called a gnome breaking the law.
[time=1316] So you guys go ahead and yell.
[time=1317] Go ahead and yell.
[time=1318] You're the opposing team.
[time=1319] And you miss it.
[time=1323] Now, what do you guys yell when he does that?
[time=1330] You guys are good.
[time=1331] This is fun.
[time=1332] Oh, don't worry.
[time=1333] I'll get it.
[time=1334] All right.
[time=1335] So I changed the order and so did you today.
[time=1338] All right.
[time=1339] So that's a third way.
[time=1340] We, we, we, you missed it on purpose, right?
[time=1342] All right.
[time=1343] Oh, there's one more way.
[time=1351] All right.
[time=1352] You ready?
[time=1353] Okay, guys, yell.
[time=1354] All right.
[time=1355] Shoot it.
[time=1356] Here we go.
[time=1357] You're not yelling loud enough.
[time=1358] You yell louder.
[time=1359] Shoot.
[time=1360] Okay.
[time=1361] It's all right.
[time=1362] Go ahead.
[time=1363] All right.
[time=1364] Ready?
[time=1365] All right.
[time=1368] That's the fourth way.
[time=1369] We leave good undone.
[time=1371] We don't even shoot at all.
[time=1374] And in this illustration, you're the devil.
[time=1378] You're supposed to laugh.
[time=1379] Nobody laughed.
[time=1380] Just laugh and make me feel good.
[time=1381] In this illustration, you're the devil.
[time=1387] That's not convincing.
[time=1388] In this illustration, you're the devil.
[time=1391] All right.
[time=1392] Hey, let's give Tim Howard a round of applause for helping me out.
[time=1395] Thanks, buddy.
[time=1397] And that's our cast member today is the devil or Satan.
[time=1404] In Hebrew, it's Satan.
[time=1407] In Greek, it's the devil.
[time=1409] Diabolos means to throw through.
[time=1413] Actually, through, throw.
[time=1415] He's designed to throw you off.
[time=1417] He's designed to do whatever you did.
[time=1419] He's designed to throw you off of hitting the mark.
[time=1423] And his target is your heart, your mind, your emotions.
[time=1426] Your will, your spirit.
[time=1428] Because it's with your mind, you think, you believe.
[time=1431] It's with your emotions that you have affection.
[time=1434] It's with your will that you choose, make decisions.
[time=1437] And it's with your spirit that you pray vertically to God.
[time=1442] And so temptation, he's a tempter.
[time=1445] He's the adversary.
[time=1446] He's the enemy.
[time=1447] Temptation is enticement to desire any life apart from God.
[time=1455] And there's this triangle of temptation toward the heart.
[time=1460] It's a pride versus humility issue that the devil does.
[time=1464] And we're going to look at that in Genesis 3.
[time=1466] So if you could please stand.
[time=1469] This is the first time he comes on to the scene.
[time=1472] There's conjecture on how he got there.
[time=1474] You have to kind of run with a few texts in Scripture to say, "How did he get there and what happened?" But he's there.
[time=1482] And before we get there, God has just given life.
[time=1487] And God said, "Hey, you got this whole earth, Adam.
[time=1492] You got the whole thing.
[time=1493] Why don't you name the animals?
[time=1495] Be fruitful and multiply." And he says, "You know, just do it together.
[time=1501] We're going to grow in our relationship as you do this." "Oh, but Adam, there's one tree.
[time=1506] It's called the knowledge of good and evil.
[time=1508] Don't eat of that tree.
[time=1509] You can eat of any tree in the garden.
[time=1512] They're good stuff.
[time=1513] But just don't eat of that one, all right?
[time=1515] You got a choice." And so here's what happens.
[time=1517] Genesis 3.
[time=1518] Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the Lord God had made.
[time=1523] It's crafty.
[time=1524] He said to the woman, "Did God really say you must not eat from any tree in the garden?" Kind of placing doubt there, right?
[time=1532] That's not what he said, is it?
[time=1534] The woman said to the serpent, "We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden, but God did say you must not eat from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die." See, Adam told her and he probably threw in the, must not touch it.
[time=1549] Verse 4, "You will not surely die to seek." The serpent said to the woman, "For God knows when you eat of it, your eyes will be open, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil." And look at this, when the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food, we're going to look at that, pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it.
[time=1580] And she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate it, and then the eyes of both of them were open, gilt, and they realized they were naked, shame, so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.
[time=1593] And you know how it goes.
[time=1595] God comes, and out of fear they hide.
[time=1599] You may be seated.
[time=1603] And maybe today, whatever that great, what is that great temptation that you're facing?
[time=1609] What is it, and what have you done about it?
[time=1612] We're going to look at Satan and who he is, and how he tempts in three ways.
[time=1617] And I just want you to know, if you do have your Bibles open, drop down there to verse 3, 15, and we know that there's curses, but there's not curses for man, there's consequences for man.
[time=1626] And then God says this in verse 3, 15 in Genesis, and I will put enmity between you and the woman, talking to the serpent, and between your offspring and hers.
[time=1636] He will crush your head and you will strike his heel.
[time=1639] How many people saw the movie, The Passion of the Christ?
[time=1641] And you saw that deal where that happened?
[time=1643] That's imagery, it's poetic license, literary license, for the cross.
[time=1648] Because it's the cross where Jesus' heel is grasped at or bruised because that's kind of what seems like victory for the devil.
[time=1658] But we know that that's the victory for God, for Christ, is His death on a cross.
[time=1664] And so what we see here, see Eve hadn't sinned yet, so her gas gauge isn't broken.
[time=1672] And we see three gifts.
[time=1673] I'm going to ask you to write three separate columns of three things, three separate columns of three things.
[time=1680] So just leave space on your notes.
[time=1681] And the first column is gifts.
[time=1684] And so Eve takes gifts, and she's deceived, and she's doubt is cast in her mind of God, and she begins to desire the gifts apart from God and that sin.
[time=1696] What's to rely on the gifts, not the giver?
[time=1698] And here's the three gifts, time.
[time=1701] Go vertically, write in vertical columns.
[time=1704] Time, talent, I mean, I'm sorry, no, don't do it that way, we normally say it, treasures, do treasures, and then talent.
[time=1712] So God gives time, He breathes life into them in His image and says, "You got life." And He gives them treasures, He says, "You got the whole earth." And then He gives them talent, He says, "Rule over it." And let's grow in our relationship together.
[time=1728] But what happens is at that first sin, sin and death enter the world.
[time=1737] And it's double-mindedness, the Bible calls it, a divided mind, partial surrender.
[time=1744] One foot on one team, and one foot on the other.
[time=1749] Can you imagine that?
[time=1751] You'd have to be a referee to do that, right?
[time=1753] That was funny too.
[time=1754] Will you please laugh?
[time=1755] Okay. One foot on one team and one foot on the other, a divided mind.
[time=1760] From that point on, from the first sin and from death, there's a gap.
[time=1766] There's a gap.
[time=1767] And the Genesis goes on to say, "Every inclination of the human heart is toward that gap, is toward evil." And so what we see is the gift of time, I'm going to give you the second column, and that's called the gap.
[time=1781] So we have the gift, and now we have the gap.
[time=1784] And the gap becomes this.
[time=1785] Time is the gift.
[time=1787] The gap becomes selfish pleasure.
[time=1791] I'm going to use the time for me.
[time=1795] The gift of treasures.
[time=1797] That becomes the gap of selfish power.
[time=1801] I'm going to be in control of this deal now, apart from God.
[time=1806] And the gift of talent becomes the gap.
[time=1809] Write this down of selfish prestige.
[time=1813] Selfish prestige.
[time=1815] So let me just do that one more time.
[time=1816] The gift of time is now the gap of selfish pleasure.
[time=1818] We call it in 1 John 2 16, the desire of the flesh.
[time=1822] I'm going to eat what I'm going to drink, what I'm going to do sexually.
[time=1826] Anything like that with time.
[time=1829] Gift of the treasures becomes the gap of selfish power.
[time=1832] Desire of the eyes.
[time=1834] Eve saw that it was good for food.
[time=1836] Gift of time, now the gap of selfish pleasure.
[time=1839] It was pleasing to the eye.
[time=1840] Gift of treasures, now the gap of selfish power.
[time=1844] Desire of the eyes.
[time=1845] And then the gift of talent, now as the gap of selfish prestige.
[time=1849] The pride of life.
[time=1850] And so with your temptation, I want you to think right now.
[time=1853] What's my greatest temptation?
[time=1855] What have I done to resist it?
[time=1856] And how have I misused the gift for the gap?
[time=1861] Second, we see the connection of Satan to Jesus.
[time=1865] Jesus is the enemy.
[time=1867] He's the enemy.
[time=1868] It's what his name means.
[time=1869] And so let's fast forward about 4,000 years.
[time=1872] And if you want to turn to Luke 4, I'm going to summarize it.
[time=1875] Luke 4, it's the temptation of Jesus.
[time=1882] And so he's going to come at Jesus.
[time=1884] The enemy is the same exact way he comes at you.
[time=1886] The same exact way he came at Eve.
[time=1888] And he says, it's interesting.
[time=1891] Very interesting.
[time=1892] He tempted him for 40 days, not just one shot here at the end.
[time=1895] And it says, the spirit of God is with Jesus.
[time=1898] And then here's what happens.
[time=1899] Jesus is really, really hungry, obviously.
[time=1902] And the devil comes up and he says, I'm going to tempt you with a gift of time.
[time=1906] And I want you to focus on that gap in selfish pleasure and let's sin.
[time=1912] And he says, turn the stone to bread.
[time=1915] Pleasure yourself, selfishly.
[time=1918] And Jesus goes back to the Old Testament.
[time=1920] The Deuteronomy 8, 3, and he says, you know what?
[time=1922] Man does not live by bread alone but on, this is in Matthew now.
[time=1926] He adds this phrase, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.
[time=1932] Oh.
[time=1934] So Jesus says that gift is to be given back to God.
[time=1939] Not for my selfish pleasure, but to God.
[time=1943] And I want you to have a giver column, that's your third column.
[time=1949] And look what he does here, he says, the word.
[time=1951] So put word.
[time=1952] It's the word of God.
[time=1954] God spoke man into existence.
[time=1956] Life comes from God.
[time=1958] We learn about the life of God through the word of God.
[time=1961] And Jesus is the word of God.
[time=1963] A good illustration of this would be Joseph and David.
[time=1967] Both had sexual temptation.
[time=1969] The desire of the flesh.
[time=1971] Pleasure from the gift of time.
[time=1974] Joseph is seduced by Potiphar's wife again and again and again.
[time=1977] And finally what's he do when she really gets ahold of him?
[time=1979] He runs.
[time=1981] All right?
[time=1983] David, time when kings go out to war.
[time=1987] He says, I'm going to hang back.
[time=1989] Just kind of have some selfish pleasure.
[time=1992] And he sees the best she'd be taken aback.
[time=1994] He says, I want her.
[time=1996] And sin and death enter his household in a way that had not quite manifested itself before.
[time=2001] So the time, the gift of time is not to be used in the gap of selfish pleasure.
[time=2006] But to be given back to God, the giver, that's what that column is.
[time=2010] The third column, the giver, through the word.
[time=2013] So now Satan comes at him again and he tempts him the same way.
[time=2016] He tempts even.
[time=2017] He says, the gift of the treasures, I want to tempt you to get in that gap of selfish power,
[time=2023] the desire, the eyes.
[time=2024] And he shows them all the kingdoms of the world.
[time=2026] Cosmos, world.
[time=2028] Two definitions.
[time=2029] The one here and the writers of scripture use again and again and again in this kind of context is that which is opposed to God.
[time=2037] Not the entire universe.
[time=2038] There's other times when it means that.
[time=2040] But here in this kind of context, in Jesus calls him the prince of the world, doesn't mean he has control of this world.
[time=2046] God.
[time=2047] God is in control.
[time=2048] All right?
[time=2049] Not the devil.
[time=2050] So he's prince of this world, that which is opposed to God.
[time=2054] And Jesus says, no.
[time=2056] He quotes scripture again.
[time=2058] Deuteronomy 6, 13 and he says, no.
[time=2060] The gift of the treasures, the eyes were given to worship God.
[time=2065] So put worship in there in that column.
[time=2069] Give the treasures back to God.
[time=2071] Amazing story.
[time=2073] The woman who anointed Jesus.
[time=2075] Remember, she has a perfume on and it's worth a year's wages.
[time=2079] And she breaks it and she pours it on it.
[time=2082] And Jesus says this is a good thing and Judas says, that's a bad thing.
[time=2088] That could have been given to the poor.
[time=2090] Don't you and I do that all the time?
[time=2092] We think a church built too big of a building or anything.
[time=2094] We do that all the time.
[time=2095] But Jesus says, no, this is a good thing.
[time=2097] She took everything she had a year's wages and she just dumped it on me.
[time=2100] Money had no control over her.
[time=2102] She just did it.
[time=2103] She worshiped me with everything.
[time=2105] And we know, John helps us out here, that Judas had his hand in the till.
[time=2109] He kept track of the money and was using it for his own purposes.
[time=2113] And Matthew, in Matthew 26, tells you about that anointing, about that woman given everything she had a year's wages.
[time=2119] And then he tells you immediately afterwards, oh, and then there's Judas who sold Jesus out for 30 pieces of silver.
[time=2126] And you say, how much is that?
[time=2129] Well, it's about four months' wages.
[time=2132] Matthew's making an extreme contrast between someone who worships God with everything
[time=2139] and someone who worships the everything instead of God.
[time=2142] And so Judas, I have here one of the 30 pieces of silver, possibly.
[time=2146] This is one of the pieces of silver from that day.
[time=2150] And I got to thinking about it.
[time=2151] It's on the screen there.
[time=2152] That's Caesar.
[time=2154] Judas wasn't going to use this money that he sells Jesus out to give to the temple, because you can't give this kind of money in the temple.
[time=2162] And it's funny, he got it from the leaders of the temple.
[time=2165] Judas has some selfish motives.
[time=2167] Judas loved money and the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.
[time=2171] And you say, who would do that?
[time=2173] Who would sell out the God of the universe for four months' wages?
[time=2178] Me.
[time=2180] I've done it for a lot less.
[time=2183] A lot less.
[time=2185] And Matthew gives us an unbelievable picture, a contrast of someone who worships God with all your treasures, gives it back to God versus someone who wants to worship the treasures.
[time=2194] Well, third, Satan tempts Jesus and he says, you know, take that gift of talent.
[time=2201] And man, let's do the gap of selfish prestige, the desire pride of life for you to go wise and say, look at me and the devil does something I really don't like.
[time=2210] He takes him up to the highest point of the temple.
[time=2212] It's probably the southeast corner overlooking the Kidron Valley where all the sacrifices of Passover, the blood would run through there.
[time=2219] And that's the bridge that Jesus is going to cross after he's arrested to go for his trial.
[time=2226] And he's looking at that and Jesus knows what that's all about.
[time=2229] And I really think there's an underlying thing here, Satan said, don't do that.
[time=2235] Do it this way, just throw yourself down and here's what bothers me.
[time=2238] He quotes Scripture, the devil quotes Scripture, Psalm 91.
[time=2242] And he quotes it and it's a Scripture about how God protects people who trust him.
[time=2248] And he's saying, no, test him.
[time=2251] Let's just see, test him through opposition of what you know is right, not through obedience.
[time=2258] And it comes from a quote in Leviticus Deuteronomy 6, 16, which is a reference to Exodus 17.
[time=2265] Interesting enough, the Israelites are with Moses.
[time=2267] They're in the desert of sin.
[time=2269] It's kind of interesting.
[time=2270] And they decide to test God on him providing water when they were thirsty.
[time=2275] And he was going to provide it anyway.
[time=2277] And so they test him for his opposition, not through their obedience.
[time=2280] And Jesus says, no what?
[time=2283] Don't put the Lord your God to a test, he quotes Scripture again.
[time=2287] And he says, trust God with your talent.
[time=2290] Give it back to God.
[time=2291] And that's what I want you to write in that bottom of that third column is trust.
[time=2298] Fear the Lord's the beginning of wisdom.
[time=2303] Proverbs 3, 5, and 6 says, trust in the Lord with how much of your heart?
[time=2307] Oh, see in your temptation, in my temptation, we are doing the divided mind.
[time=2313] We have broken gaskages, and we want one foot on one team and one foot on the other.
[time=2318] See, if you're not in the kingdom of God, if you haven't fully surrounded your life, this is you and Satan's trying to keep you out.
[time=2326] If you're in, he's just trying to neutralize you.
[time=2328] That's what he's doing.
[time=2330] And it's really interesting that at the end of this temptation, it says that the devil left him, left Jesus until an opportune time.
[time=2338] And I really think that Mel might be right with what he was doing there in the movie, that that opportune time might be the garden of Gethsemane.
[time=2346] Because Jesus talks again and again three times about temptation.
[time=2350] He's being tempted, tempted to not want to do the cross thing, maybe.
[time=2357] But theologians say he's probably a greater temptation to not have whatever that brokenness is in the community of God that happens at the cross of Christ as he pays for the sin of God.
[time=2367] He says he pays for the sin of the world.
[time=2370] And he's probably there being tempted.
[time=2373] But Hebrews 4 says that we have a high priest who is tempted in every way, the triangle of temptation that comes from the evil one, and he did not sin.
[time=2386] Illustration, Nicodemus was a Pharisee.
[time=2389] Nicodemus was proud about his prestige and proud about the talents God had given him and proud about his birthright.
[time=2395] And he comes to Jesus in the middle of the night and he says, "Jesus, there's something missing in my soul."
[time=2401] And Jesus says you need to be born again, you need to fully surrender, you need to get out of that divided mind.
[time=2406] And fully surrender to God.
[time=2409] Well, there was another Pharisee, he was the high priest.
[time=2413] And his name was Caiaphas.
[time=2415] And Caiaphas loved the same deal.
[time=2418] In fact, Caiaphas loved it so much that he prophesied in John 11, 49 and 50, he says, "You know what, it'd be better for this one Jesus to die than for me to lose what I got going on here."
[time=2431] You know what he had going on?
[time=2433] Remember when Jesus overturned the money changers in the temple?
[time=2437] Remember when he did that?
[time=2438] They were charged at exorbitant rates, exchange rates, because they only allowed the Jewish coins.
[time=2442] You couldn't get in with the silver coin of Caesar.
[time=2445] Okay? And so they were charging these huge exchange rates.
[time=2449] They were just killing people who were trying to come and worship God.
[time=2452] Jesus flips it over.
[time=2454] Caiaphas don't like that.
[time=2456] You know what else Caiaphas did?
[time=2458] Half a million people would come to Jerusalem for Passover, from all over the world.
[time=2464] And they would need a sacrifice, what would all happen within a few hour period, they would need a sacrifice of an unblemished lamb.
[time=2472] Guess who owned the unblemished lamb business?
[time=2476] Guess who they bought it from because they didn't want to have lambs being carried.
[time=2480] They didn't want to be rejected.
[time=2481] They didn't want to travel that way with them.
[time=2482] Caiaphas sold a quarter of a million lambs.
[time=2487] He was getting a rake off of that.
[time=2490] And Caiaphas says, "No, it's talents for me.
[time=2493] I like the gap better." And so in your temptation, how about it?
[time=2499] You've got a gift of time.
[time=2503] Are you misusing it?
[time=2505] Is there pressure coming you from the devil to misuse that in selfish pleasure?
[time=2512] Jesus says, "The Word of God." That's the answer.
[time=2519] How about the gift of treasures?
[time=2524] Are you misusing that in that temptation?
[time=2528] Has selfish power, a desire for that?
[time=2531] Jesus says, "Worship God." That's what your eyes are for, the eyes of the heart.
[time=2538] And how about that temptation as he comes at you?
[time=2543] What are you doing with that gift of talent that he gave you?
[time=2550] Are you tempted for that desire of selfish prestige?
[time=2554] Look at me, I'm smart.
[time=2556] I got talent.
[time=2558] Jesus says, "Trust God with that." And so we see the character trait of Satan is evil.
[time=2567] He wants evil is life apart from God, and that's what he wants.
[time=2571] He wants evil.
[time=2573] And he says, "Take that gift of time and forget it and go into the gap of selfish power."
[time=2579] Because you've got a broken gas gauge, you don't know any better, you've got a divided mind.
[time=2582] Take that gift of treasures and go for selfish power.
[time=2586] Did I say power before?
[time=2587] Selfish pleasure.
[time=2588] Gift of treasures, go to the gap of selfish power.
[time=2590] Gift of talent, go to the gap of selfish prestige.
[time=2593] Less to the flesh, less to the eyes, pride of life.
[time=2595] And he does it in three ways.
[time=2597] He's ADD.
[time=2598] He does it all in the subtlety of partial surrender.
[time=2601] He's very subtle.
[time=2602] You wouldn't believe how subtle he's been with me this week.
[time=2605] On the doubt, he's tried to cast in my mind.
[time=2607] But he's ADD if you want to write this down.
[time=2610] He accuses.
[time=2611] It's Revelation 12, 10.
[time=2614] He deceives.
[time=2616] He masquerades as an angel of light.
[time=2618] He looks really good.
[time=2619] And you know what it looks really good?
[time=2620] It's like when we go fishing, we've got a bait that looks really, really, really good, right?
[time=2624] This is 2 Corinthians 11, 14.
[time=2626] And it looks really, really good to the fish.
[time=2629] So he accuses, he deceives with that bait.
[time=2633] See, we know what right and wrong is.
[time=2635] Adam and Eve knew what right and wrong was.
[time=2638] Decede is not knowing what right and wrong is.
[time=2640] We know that going into the deal.
[time=2642] Even with our broken gas gauge, we can get that.
[time=2644] And we'll see that in a little bit on how we get that.
[time=2647] But...
[time=2649] See, that's what they think happened, theologians think happened.
[time=2652] They think that the knowledge of good and evil, that's now me going to determine what's right and wrong on my own.
[time=2659] And that's what happens in the garden with the broken gas gauge.
[time=2662] And I'm going to determine what's right and wrong on my own.
[time=2665] Not from the Word of God, not from the Spirit of God, not from the people of God.
[time=2668] I'm going to do it on my own.
[time=2670] And judges closes with the fact that every man did what he thought was right.
[time=2675] Bad stuff.
[time=2677] So anyways, there's that deceit, there's that bait, and then he destroys.
[time=2681] A-D-D, he destroys.
[time=2683] Accuses, deceives, destroys.
[time=2684] 1 Peter 5, 8 through 10.
[time=2686] Because in every single bait, there's a what?
[time=2690] Hook.
[time=2692] And fish bite, my dad always told me, because they're either hungry or angry.
[time=2697] And you're in my temptation that we're trying to resist.
[time=2702] It's probably a result of us being hungry or angry from hiding in our sin.
[time=2708] And evil is to cause us to sin any attempt at any life apart from God in the gap of partial surrender.
[time=2716] So Jesus comes on to the scene.
[time=2718] He is tempted in every way.
[time=2720] And he fills that gap.
[time=2722] And this is the change that we see.
[time=2725] He's defeated.
[time=2727] Satan is defeated.
[time=2731] Hebrews 2, 14.
[time=2733] This is incredible.
[time=2735] Hebrews 2, 14.
[time=2740] Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity.
[time=2744] So that by his death, this is Jesus, he might destroy him who holds the power of death.
[time=2751] That is the devil.
[time=2753] And free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death, in their sin, in their partial surrender.
[time=2761] He's defeated it.
[time=2763] The gifts have been given back to the giver.
[time=2766] And the gap is filled by the giver.
[time=2769] Jesus Christ is Lord.
[time=2771] The Acts 10, 38 records that he went on and he healed all who were under the power of the devil.
[time=2777] And in my temptation, I need to know that evil, Satan, the devil is defeated and that Jesus
[time=2785] Christ is Lord.
[time=2786] And nobody can make me go into that sin.
[time=2789] Nobody can make me not be able to resist that temptation.
[time=2792] And that's what we see, the challenge.
[time=2797] And the challenge is to resist the temptation.
[time=2802] Resist the temptation.
[time=2803] How do I do that?
[time=2804] Well, I look at Jesus.
[time=2806] You know, in my life, I succumbed to all of it.
[time=2811] I lived ten years trying to win the great American dream.
[time=2815] And I wanted to be a billionaire.
[time=2817] There was this article in the Indianapolis Star about it.
[time=2820] And I was mad because they said millionaire.
[time=2823] I was like 18 or when they did it.
[time=2825] It really made me mad because they said billionaire.
[time=2828] And I was going to do it this way.
[time=2829] I was going to prove that, you know what?
[time=2832] When I'm all done, I'm going to let them know I was a Christian.
[time=2837] But I'm going to get rich, divided in mine, playing on two teams.
[time=2844] Nothing wrong with having some resources and God blessing you.
[time=2847] Everything wrong with worshipping them and losing your own soul.
[time=2851] And so I go ten years.
[time=2855] And I earn a lot of money.
[time=2859] And then I lost it all.
[time=2865] And I got on my knees and I said, "God, after a very bad day,"
[time=2871] I said, "Let's try it a different way.
[time=2874] I'm giving it all back to you.
[time=2877] Now show me what you want done." And these are the three things that I've experienced in my life.
[time=2884] See, I think with your temptation you got a gun to the conclusion that I did.
[time=2888] And that is that God will satisfy every one of those desires.
[time=2893] That it's not in the temptation.
[time=2895] It's not in what you're trying to resist.
[time=2897] God, in Christ, fulfills those desires.
[time=2901] 1, 45, 16 says, "God opens His hand and He satisfies the desires of every living thing."
[time=2907] Philippians 4, 19 says, "God, in Christ, will meet all of your needs." And so here's the three things.
[time=2913] First is this, your time, the gift of time.
[time=2917] You've got to fully surrender it to Christ.
[time=2920] This is an eye pack that I don't know how to use, but it looks good when I carry it around.
[time=2925] And so your calendar, I want you to write it down, your calendar.
[time=2929] I want you to make time and fully surrender your time to God.
[time=2932] Not an hour a week, not just 15 minutes in the morning, but 168 hours a week of your life.
[time=2939] Give it to God and see what happens.
[time=2945] And get in the Word of God with the Bible.
[time=2949] That's your offense.
[time=2950] Your defense is run for this desire of the flesh.
[time=2954] Run!
[time=2955] Joseph ran!
[time=2957] If you're attracted to a girl and you shouldn't be attracted to her, run!
[time=2960] If you're attracted to a guy and you're going to destroy marriage and you shouldn't be attracted, run!
[time=2965] If you're attracted to alcohol, get out of the bar, get out of the liquor section.
[time=2969] If you're attracted to drugs, get out of where they sell it.
[time=2972] Run!
[time=2973] Starve the addiction.
[time=2977] Second, the desire of the eyes, fully surrender the gift of treasures to Christ of a picture here of a checking account.
[time=2986] Give all your resources to God.
[time=2991] Not 10%, 100%.
[time=2995] It's Satan who said, "King to 10." Just do it then.
[time=3001] God's designed it so that we give it all back to Christ.
[time=3004] I don't mean you got to write a check to the Black Hawk Ministries for everything you own and go cash out.
[time=3008] I mean that you honor God with everything that comes under your stewardship and you take those eyes and you worship God with your car.
[time=3015] And you worship God with your house.
[time=3017] And you worship God with everything that you have.
[time=3020] You worship God, and that changed my life when I saw a deal as worshiping God.
[time=3029] And then finally, that desire of taking that gift of talent and to keep it for myself, I got a business card here.
[time=3039] Take that talent and surrender it fully to Christ, get out of double-mindedness, get out of partial surrender.
[time=3048] And the defense is to rid your heart of the thirst for the selfish ambition to use that for you.
[time=3056] The offense is give it to God.
[time=3058] And guess what, I don't mean this.
[time=3060] I don't mean get on some committee at church.
[time=3063] I don't mean just a few minutes or a call on the pastor and say, "Oh yeah, I just did my ministry today." I don't mean coming.
[time=3069] I don't mean that.
[time=3070] I mean all of your life fully surrender it to Christ.
[time=3076] Everything I have, every gift I have, I'm going to use it to glorify Him, not Me.
[time=3084] Give your talents to God.
[time=3086] This changed my life.
[time=3087] And you know what?
[time=3088] It's relationship, not religion.
[time=3089] And you know what?
[time=3090] It's brought me here.
[time=3092] It's brought me to a place of common ground where I get to see people who are taught.
[time=3097] People who are trapped in the gap.
[time=3100] And the addiction of evil in their sin.
[time=3104] And I get to watch their divided minds become fully surrendered to Christ.
[time=3112] That's what He did with me.
[time=3114] I tried to use all those for myself.
[time=3116] And the more I would give Him to God, the more He changed my life.
[time=3119] And I want you to know this.
[time=3121] Partial surrender leads to death because if you got one foot out of bounds, you're out
[time=3127] of bounds.
[time=3128] Don't trust that broken gauge.
[time=3131] Is Satan that good that he's worth spending eternity with in hell?
[time=3136] Fully surrender.
[time=3138] Both feed in.
[time=3140] All of your time.
[time=3141] All of your treasures.
[time=3143] All of your talent.
[time=3144] And the Word of God.
[time=3146] And worshiping God.
[time=3148] And trusting God.
[time=3149] Fully surrender it back to Him.
[time=3151] And receive forgiveness of your sin.
[time=3154] And the power of the Holy Spirit to be Lord of your life.
[time=3157] Because full surrender to Christ leads to life.
[time=3161] Jesus said you can't serve two masters.
[time=3165] You can only serve one.
[time=3168] Don't trust that broken gas gauge.
[time=3171] Fully surrender your life to Christ.
[time=3172] I'm asking the team to come up.
[time=3176] And what really changed my life is when I began to see Christ in every moment.
[time=3184] See Christ in an encounter with every person.
[time=3188] See Christ anytime you wrote a check.
[time=3191] See Christ anytime you did a deal.
[time=3195] See Christ with the eyes of your heart and absolutely every second of every day.
[time=3201] And can you imagine if I brought Tim up here and I said okay Tim I want you to start firing away.
[time=3206] But I want you to turn your eyes over here and I want your body to go with it.
[time=3210] And I want you to go ahead and start trying to knock him down best you can't do it.
[time=3213] Yet that's exactly how I tried to live my life.
[time=3216] And that's exactly how the devil wants you to live your life.
[time=3218] And he is defeated.
[time=3220] He has no power over you in Christ.
[time=3227] And so I'm asking you right now as the team sings to fully surrender your life to Christ.
[time=3236] To get out of the gap of selfish pleasure, power and prestige that comes from a proud heart.
[time=3243] Because the gap has been filled by the kiffer of Jesus Christ and the cross.
[time=3249] And he resurrected to prove that he is who he said he was.
[time=3253] And so will you now get out of the double-mindedness of partial surrender and will you fully surrender your life to Jesus Christ.
[time=3263] Not just as Savior.
[time=3266] For forgiveness from the penalty of your sin.
[time=3269] But as Lord.
[time=3271] For freedom.
[time=3273] From the power of sin.
[time=3275] Look in your heart.
[time=3277] Expose and confess that double-mindedness to God and fully surrender your life as you turn your eyes on Jesus.
[time=3307] And the things of earth will go straight in.
[time=3321] In the light of his glory and blood.
[time=3333] Turn your eyes upon Jesus.
[time=3343] Look full in his wonderful flame.
[time=3354] And the things of earth will go straight in.
[time=3366] In the light of his glory and blood.
[time=3385] That's what happened to me.
[time=3388] As I would focus my eyes on Jesus.
[time=3391] This building my own kingdom on this earth started getting strangely dim.
[time=3398] And I said I gotta be about sharing full surrender with the world.
[time=3404] Because they're missing it.
[time=3406] Your desire for whatever your temptation is is only filled by the one who fills the cap.
[time=3414] And that's Jesus Christ.
[time=3416] And I'm gonna give my life till the day I go to the other side to making sure that everyone knows about full surrender to Christ.
[time=3427] And wherever you are in your life, whether you say I've never drawn that line of sand, I've never put that stake in the ground, or you've been in the church for years, full surrender is it.
[time=3440] It's it.
[time=3443] And so if you're on a journey here and you've been visiting us through the series, I'm begging you to come back Easter Sunday.
[time=3449] And if you want to right now, you can talk to one of us, you can fully surrender your life to Christ today and be free.
[time=3459] You can do it in your home at night, on knees by your bed.
[time=3464] You can do it next Sunday.
[time=3467] But I think it's Satan that'll always be telling you, do it, but do it tomorrow.
[time=3475] Let's pray.
[time=3479] Now, God, we love you.
[time=3481] And we turn the eyes of our heart on you, recognizing God that you fulfill the desire of every living thing, that the gift of time is not for the gap of selfish pleasure.
[time=3493] But for you to the Word, and that the gift of treasures, God, is not for selfish power, the lust of the eyes, but it's to worship you.
[time=3508] And that this gift of talent isn't for some selfish prestige, pride of life deal, but it's to entrusted all to you.
[time=3519] God, make us a place, make us the salt, make us the light, and be the beacon of full surrender to you.
[time=3526] We love you.
[time=3527] We praise you for your perfect life, your death, and your resurrection, and the fact that you are here right now.
[time=3535] In Jesus' mighty name, we pray these things that all God's people said.
[time=3539] [AMEN]
