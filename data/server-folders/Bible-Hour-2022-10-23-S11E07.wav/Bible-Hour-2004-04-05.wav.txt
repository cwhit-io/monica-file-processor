[time=73] [MUSIC] Where to stand [MUSIC] Who told the ocean
[time=85] [MUSIC] This far
[time=92] [MUSIC] Showed the moon [MUSIC] To leave me [MUSIC] Can capture falling stars
[time=109] [MUSIC] My red deer

[time=147] [MUSIC] Fell in the same God [MUSIC] In orbit
[time=158] [MUSIC] The morning
[time=164] [MUSIC] And the city
[time=170] [MUSIC] That hold me when I'm broken
[time=177] [MUSIC] To bring me victory
[time=185] [MUSIC] My red team
[time=191] [MUSIC] I know
[time=197] [MUSIC] Knits
[time=203] [MUSIC] Tests your eyes
[time=209] [MUSIC] But then he cries out [MUSIC] My red team [MUSIC] He lives [MUSIC] My shame
[time=229] [MUSIC] Forever [MUSIC] That the pavement
[time=240] [MUSIC] Was a precious night
[time=246] [MUSIC] But now he's alive [MUSIC] Wave
[time=259] [MUSIC] A redeemer
[time=265] [MUSIC] I know
[time=271] [MUSIC] Knits [MUSIC] Tests your eyes
[time=282] [MUSIC] But then he cries out [MUSIC] My red team [MUSIC] I know [MUSIC] Knits [MUSIC] My red team [MUSIC] I know [MUSIC] I know [MUSIC] My red team [MUSIC] Because he lives [MUSIC] Knits [MUSIC] The town is empty [MUSIC] I know
[time=332] [MUSIC] Knits [MUSIC] My red team [MUSIC] Knits
[time=347] [MUSIC] Knits You know, it's really amazing in a room this size with this many people.
[time=357] One thing that we're absolutely convinced of is that you all, though we're here in this room together, everybody comes from a different vantage point.
[time=367] There are so many in the room today, and yet we each come into this setting from a different reality.
[time=373] Does that make sense?
[time=374] I mean, there are some in the room today, and you come into this place fully surrendered, and you know him.
[time=380] You don't just know about him, you know him.
[time=383] And you're life with him today.
[time=386] This walk of faith that you share with him today, right now, it's absolutely full of joy and blessing and answered prayer, and the greatest day of all.
[time=397] And so you come into this place and your heart is full.
[time=400] Others of you come and you're hurting.
[time=402] You know him.
[time=403] You have a relationship with him, but the circumstances that he's allowed, the situation you find yourself in today, it is really testing your patience.
[time=417] It is stretching your faith.
[time=420] And truth be told, maybe even coming today for you was possibly someone of a struggle.
[time=426] Others of you.
[time=428] And you know, if you know us at all, you know we respect you, this third group.
[time=433] You're searching.
[time=435] You're seeking.
[time=437] You really haven't come to that point where you've drawn that line in the sand and the stake in the ground.
[time=443] You may know about him, but truth be told today so far.
[time=447] You don't know him personally.
[time=451] Maybe you can.
[time=452] I'm sure most of you can.
[time=454] Identify with these three and the things that they would say and the statements that they would make and the questions that they would ask.
[time=463] I love the smell of Easter lilies.
[time=469] What a special day.
[time=471] I am so thankful that I have this amazing church where I can come week after week to worship God and reflect on his love and be surrounded by such a devoted group of believers.
[time=484] The Lord has really blessed my life and he continues to amaze me with something new almost every single day.
[time=492] Now, that's not to say that every day is a bed of roses for me.
[time=496] But even during trials, God helps me to remain joyful and thankful and to grow and to get to be here today to celebrate Jesus' resurrection.
[time=509] Well, there's just no place else I'd rather be.
[time=513] I just barely made it here today.
[time=522] Actually, it was a pure struggle to get myself up for this.
[time=527] Don't get me wrong, part of me wants to be here, especially today.
[time=531] I want to meet with God.
[time=535] I need to meet with God, but an even bigger part of me has absolutely no desire for any of this right now.
[time=544] Life isn't going so well for me right now.
[time=551] My mom is sick.
[time=554] She's real sick.
[time=556] And my husband, well, he's been working late a lot lately.
[time=561] And my job, well, I've never felt so overwhelmed.
[time=566] And I'm lonely and exhausted and I'm just waiting for relief from all of this.
[time=574] You know, part of me feels like I'm being punished for my past or something like I deserve all of this.
[time=580] And then the other part of me knows that that is not how God works and that he can't deliver me and that my faith is just being tested, but I find myself believing lies instead of God knows that I just want to run and hide.
[time=597] But I'm here.
[time=599] I'm here today.
[time=601] I'm just hoping, praying, needing God to help me.
[time=607] Knowing that he can, I know he can.
[time=611] My wife started attending here about the middle of last summer
[time=620] and she finally succeeded in dragging me along with her about a month ago.
[time=625] But you know what?
[time=626] I just don't know if I buy all this Christianity stuff.
[time=629] I mean, come on.
[time=630] Miracles, resurrections, son of God, all seems a little bit out there if you ask me.
[time=636] Now, I'm a spiritual kind of guy.
[time=639] I definitely believe there's a higher power out there, but I just don't know about all this stuff, you know.
[time=647] I like listening to the preachers.
[time=649] They're good guys.
[time=650] They're good.
[time=652] I tell you one thing.
[time=653] They sure seem convinced that all this stuff is true.
[time=657] As a matter of fact, about everybody I run into around here seem convinced of that.
[time=662] I guess it could technically all be true.
[time=667] I mean, what if Jesus really was the son of God?
[time=673] And what if all that stuff was in the Bible?
[time=675] What if all that stuff really happened?
[time=678] That would be a pretty important question.
[time=682] Somehow, I'm going to need to find the answer to that one.
[time=690] And so we come into this room.
[time=692] And we gather from all stages and from all parts of the journey.
[time=698] And wherever you are in the midst of that, whatever the reality of your life is, what a privilege to have you here surrendered.
[time=707] Some struggling, others still seeking.
[time=710] And what a joy that we can, those of us that know him, that we can come into a place like this and worship.
[time=717] And we can worship a Lord that has risen.
[time=721] And we can open up the pages of Scripture, ancient words.
[time=725] They're still as true as they've ever been.
[time=727] And they continue to change us.
[time=729] We're so thankful for the chance to do this with you today on this greatest of days.
[time=747] [MUSIC] We wrote into town the other day [MUSIC] Just me and my daddy [MUSIC] He said I'd finally reach that age [MUSIC] And I could ride next to him on a horse [MUSIC] That of course was not quite as wide [MUSIC] We heard a crowd of people shouting [MUSIC] And so we stuck to find out why [MUSIC] And there was that man [MUSIC] That my dad said he loved [MUSIC] But today there was fear in his eyes [MUSIC] So I said, Daddy, why are they screaming [MUSIC] Why are the faces of some of them being made [MUSIC] Why is he dressed in that bright purple robe [MUSIC] I bet that crown hurts him more than he shows [MUSIC] Oh, Daddy, please, can't you do something [MUSIC] He loves as though he's gone a cry [MUSIC] He said he was stronger than all of those guys [MUSIC] Daddy, please, tell me why [MUSIC] Why does everyone want him to die [MUSIC] And later that day the sky broke out of me [MUSIC] And Daddy said I should go inside [MUSIC] Somehow he knew things would get stolen [MUSIC] Boy, was he right [MUSIC] But I could not keep from wondering [MUSIC] If there was something he had to hide [MUSIC] So after he left I had to find out [MUSIC] I was not afraid of getting lost [MUSIC] So I followed the crowds to a hill [MUSIC] Where I knew men had been killed [MUSIC] Then I heard a voice come from the cross [MUSIC] And it said, Father, why are they screaming [MUSIC] Why are the faces of some of them be men [MUSIC] Why are they casting their lats for my robe [MUSIC] This crown of thorns hurts me more than it shows [MUSIC] Oh, Father, please, can't you do something [MUSIC] I know that you must hear my cry [MUSIC] I thought I could handle a cross of this size [MUSIC] Father, remind me why [MUSIC] Why does everyone want me to die [MUSIC] Oh, when will I understand why [MUSIC] My precious son, I hear them screaming [MUSIC] And I'm watching the face of the enemy be men [MUSIC] Soon I will clothe you in robes of my own [MUSIC] Jesus, this hurts me much more than you know [MUSIC] But this dark hour, I must do nothing [MUSIC] Though I've heard your unbearable cry [MUSIC] The power in your blood destroys all of the lies [MUSIC] Soon you'll see past their unmerciful eyes [MUSIC] Look there below, see the child [MUSIC] Trembling by her father's sight [MUSIC] Now I can tell you why [MUSIC] She is why you must die â™ª
[time=1113] Well, we want to welcome you this morning to the fourth and final installment to this series that we have entitled "Meet the Cast."
[time=1123] And what have four weeks it's been? Before we move on this morning, I do want to tell you this by way of announcement.
[time=1130] At the conclusion of this series, we're going to take a couple, two, three weeks and give ourselves to some further study of first Thessalonians.
[time=1139] To wrap that up, we're going to have a Sunday completely devoted to reminding you, the Black Hawk family, of our biblical mission and vision.
[time=1148] And we're going to give another Sunday, the first one in May, to our global ministries team to kind of teach and inform you about Black Hawk's opportunity worldwide, as well as here in the States and even here in Fort Wayne.
[time=1165] But then the following week, we begin a new series. And I just want to tell you about it briefly this morning, because I think many of you here might want to just have it in mind.
[time=1174] A lot of you have come recently in the last four to six weeks, and I guess I just want to invite you to stick around, because in about three weeks we'll begin a series entitled "For Better or For Worse."
[time=1186] God's design for marriage and family. And I won't speak for any of you, but I would guess in a room this size, there are some possibly who may have some questions about marriage.
[time=1201] There may be some in the room today who have experienced marital tension. There may be some in the room today, and this idea of living with another human being, lovingly, graciously, living with somebody of the opposite sex being married and doing that in a way that honors God.
[time=1221] I would bet there are a few in the room who have had some struggles with that, maybe even in recent days. I bet there might be a few in the room who have struggled at times or wondered what in the world we're supposed to do as we try and honor God's design and the raising of our kids.
[time=1241] God's design for marriage and family. See, that's the beautiful thing, folks. I know that there really are a lot of you in the room who have struggled with all the above, myself included.
[time=1252] And what an absolute relief to know that though it's challenging and though you and I face difficulties in the midst of those family situations, God's design is not hidden from us.
[time=1266] And the reason that we struggle and the reason it gets nasty and the reason it starts to go south and the reason there's tension is because you and I don't follow God's design when it comes to marriage and family.
[time=1283] And I need your prayers. I need your prayers big time. I'm going to stand here and try and explain God's word to you about family.
[time=1292] And like my oldest one's like 12. So I've got nothing figured out. I've just got this. Amen?
[time=1301] And so we invite you to stick around in a few weeks. We'll begin for better or for worse. God's design for marriage and family.
[time=1309] Well, as I mentioned today, we conclude meet the cast. We started the series about four weeks ago somewhat simultaneously as Mel Gibson's movie The Passion of the Christ hit the screens.
[time=1320] The movie has given many of us the opportunity to revisit this unspeakable sacrifice made by the Son of God on our behalf.
[time=1329] And as all of you know by now, the movie has its critics. There are some who have claimed that it is anti-Semitic.
[time=1336] There are others even in evangelical circles who have claimed it to be too graphic and too violent.
[time=1341] There are some who would claim it to be inaccurate in its depiction of what took place.
[time=1346] Andy Rooney seems to think that Mel Gibson has acted financially opportunistic in that he is making a profit on the death and resurrection of our Lord.
[time=1357] $350 million in ticket sales. It recently opened worldwide and experts are claiming that within a week it will hit the $500 million mark.
[time=1371] Say what you will about the film. All right. There's one thing about it that absolutely fires me up.
[time=1379] There is one thing that I have seen happen again and again. I could tell you story after story after personal stories.
[time=1387] In counters and situations where this has happened and I've been personally aware of it.
[time=1392] And you've probably seen it as well. There are many things that have come from the movie.
[time=1396] One thing that absolutely lights my jets is that millions of people have gone to see it and millions of people have left the theater and gone home and as quickly as they could picked this up.
[time=1408] Because their hearts have been stirred and their minds have been challenged and they want to know what really happened.
[time=1418] Some have picked the, some have gone and borrowed these from Christ-following friends.
[time=1424] Some have dug into the back of their closets and found these, blown the dust off the cover and sat down with them for the very first time in years.
[time=1433] Others have gone into Christian bookstores and purchased new ones, but the bottom line is they have entered the biblical discussion regarding Jesus Christ.
[time=1442] Some for the very first time and that is, in my opinion, absolutely phenomenal.
[time=1448] You know what? It's more than, it's more than phenomenal.
[time=1452] You know what it can be? It can be life changing.
[time=1456] This. Life changing. Not the movie. All right.
[time=1463] I mean, I'm fine with the movie. I am. I hope Mel Gibson makes a billion dollars and you can quote me.
[time=1470] I don't, I'm fine with. I hope he, I hope he wins multiple Academy Awards. It's okay with me.
[time=1476] I appreciate what he's done, but you know what? I believe, in my opinion, the greatest achievement is that in portraying the truth,
[time=1485] it has led people again to consider the truth.
[time=1489] And when you get millions and millions of people considering the truth,
[time=1495] Jesus said in the Gospels, and the truth shall set you what?
[time=1501] You got a chain in your hand? Hold it up.
[time=1504] Everybody was supposed to have been given a chain.
[time=1507] Hold them up. We sound like one big bell choir. Look at us. All right, good. All right, now stop.
[time=1518] I said, oh, just kidding. I feel like I'm at home there for a second.
[time=1522] I said, we'll get back to this. Jesus said the truth shall set you, say it again.
[time=1530] Free. Free. We'll come back to this.
[time=1534] So what do the Scriptures say? If, in fact, it draws us back to the truth.
[time=1538] What do the Scriptures say happened on that hill called Golgotha?
[time=1543] Let's revisit that briefly before we get to the single greatest event in all of history.
[time=1549] Before we talk about him being alive, we must recognize his sacrificial death,
[time=1555] and we could go to a number of places in God's Word.
[time=1558] Turn with me to Isaiah, chapter 53, where the prophet hundreds and hundreds of years before,
[time=1564] foretold exactly what would take place on that hill called Golgotha.
[time=1569] Isaiah 53 will start in verse 4. It says there in verse 4,
[time=1576] Book of Isaiah, 53rd chapter, "Surely our griefs he himself bore,
[time=1583] and our sorrows he carried, yet we ourselves esteemed him stricken, smitten of God and afflicted."
[time=1590] He goes on in verse 5 to say, "But he was pierced through for our transgressions.
[time=1596] He was crushed for our iniquities, chastening for our well-being fell upon him,
[time=1605] and by his scourging." I've always thought that was interesting.
[time=1610] Not by his death, not by his crucifixion, but here, inspired by the Holy Spirit,
[time=1616] the prophet uses this phrase, and by his scourging, we are healed.
[time=1623] All of us, like sheep, have gone astray.
[time=1628] It's true, right?
[time=1630] Anybody here want to raise your hand and say, "No, not me"?
[time=1634] Go ahead. I'll give you a second. I didn't think so.
[time=1637] It's true, isn't it? All of us, like sheep, sheep, an adjective that comes to mind,
[time=1643] sheep are told are the dumbest animals in the world.
[time=1652] And you and I, we do some dumb things, don't we?
[time=1659] Like dumb sheep. Isaiah says every one of us, all of us have gone astray.
[time=1667] Each has turned to his own way, but the Lord has caused, what's it say?
[time=1672] The iniquity, please, be reminded this morning that iniquity, that's what happens when you wander.
[time=1678] That's what happens when, like, dumb sheep, we think we know best.
[time=1682] That's what happens when you and I go walking down this path and that path when he has called you and I to this one, see, that's what it leads to sin.
[time=1693] And the iniquity of all of our wandering sheep, he says, the Lord has caused the iniquity of us all to fall on him.
[time=1704] And that's what happened on that hill that Friday.
[time=1708] He came, he lived, he loved, he taught, he healed, he brought comfort, insight, and wisdom.
[time=1713] But the truth, but he was despised, he was despised by the religious.
[time=1718] He was plotted against, eventually arrested, falsely accused, beaten, scourged within an inch of his life,
[time=1724] crucified and then killed, pierced through, crushed, as the prophet said.
[time=1731] And we know he allowed it all because we know it was ordained of God, predetermined,
[time=1739] that he would give his son and that his death, his sacrifice, was to be the covering for our sins.
[time=1747] He had to die, the justice of God demanded, that sin be covered.
[time=1755] The justice of God demanded that a sacrifice be made.
[time=1760] And so the ultimate sacrifice is made in the Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ Himself goes and is pierced through.
[time=1768] To cover your iniquity in mind.
[time=1772] Please, don't miss this.
[time=1777] If dying though, okay, as thankful as we are for what he did there in the cross, as needed as it was for our salvation,
[time=1787] that his body would be crushed, that his blood would be spilled.
[time=1792] If all he did was die, if somehow, some way, that were the end of the story.
[time=1800] If all he did was hang on that cross and die that Friday evening,
[time=1807] then in the words of that Mountain Dew commercial, we're hosed.
[time=1813] And I mean it.
[time=1815] We are absolutely hopeless.
[time=1820] Do you understand that?
[time=1822] Paul understood it.
[time=1824] And he says it really, really clear.
[time=1827] Look at 1 Corinthians 15.
[time=1830] Look at 1 Corinthians 15 verse 17.
[time=1834] And if Christ, you see it there?
[time=1836] And if Christ Paul writing to the Church of Corinth, and if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless.
[time=1845] You are still in your sins.
[time=1849] It goes on in verse 18 to say, "Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
[time=1857] If we have hoped in Christ in this life only we are of all men most to be pitied."
[time=1863] You know what?
[time=1864] We're fools, Paul says.
[time=1868] If Christ has not been raised, if all he did was die, the whole thing is a scam.
[time=1877] All of this, absolutely senseless.
[time=1881] Your faith in mine, absolutely worthless.
[time=1886] We might as well be home in bed.
[time=1890] We might as well be doing whatever it is you and I would be doing if we didn't know him.
[time=1894] I mean, the whole thing is shot if the resurrection doesn't take place.
[time=1901] And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless.
[time=1905] Without the resurrection we have no faith, we have no hope, we have no victory, no record of truth.
[time=1909] You know what?
[time=1910] This is a novel if he didn't come back to life.
[time=1917] Without the resurrection death and sin, when you and I lose forever.
[time=1923] So needless to say, the resurrection, my friends, is huge.
[time=1930] The resurrection is absolutely enormous.
[time=1935] It is at the core of biblical Christianity.
[time=1939] It is what brings veracity and substance to our faith.
[time=1942] And it is the single most important piece of evidence in the case for faith.
[time=1949] And I know there are many in the room today, and you've been with us for a few weeks, and you continue to compile the evidence, and you continue to think through the claims of Christ.
[time=1960] And you continue to wrestle with this issue of faith.
[time=1964] And I'm telling you, you have come today to the central issue, the resurrection of our Lord.
[time=1972] So it would make sense, it being that big.
[time=1975] It would make sense that for 2,000 years, the skeptics and the critics have been absolutely in vain,
[time=1983] I believe, trying their best to explain it away.
[time=1987] They've written books, they've put together studies.
[time=1990] I mean, these are really, really smart men and women.
[time=1994] And they have for hundreds and hundreds of years attempted to explain the resurrection away.
[time=2000] So as to dismantle your faith and mind.
[time=2004] And I want to today, in the time we have remaining, to just hit on three very, very important truths,
[time=2011] three very, very important facts.
[time=2014] Truths and facts that have been assailed for hundreds and hundreds of years, it will amaze you.
[time=2019] Some said, and some still say, number one, you can write this down, that he didn't really die.
[time=2025] Do you know that?
[time=2027] There are scholars today.
[time=2030] There are volumes and volumes of literature and books written that would tell you that he didn't really die.
[time=2038] That going through what he went through and experiencing what he experienced, that in the end really he just passed out.
[time=2046] That in the end he nodded off and the cool breeze of the tomb revived him.
[time=2055] Alexander Matharel is the world's most renowned historian, archeological, medical expert on the death,
[time=2063] the historical death of Jesus of Nazareth, the crucifixion of the historical figure, Jesus of Nazareth that took place outside the gates of Jerusalem.
[time=2073] And in an interview with Lee Strobel, the author of A Case for Christ and A Case for Faith.
[time=2078] In an interview with Strobel, Strobel is an interesting guy, a former atheist, editor at the Chicago Tribune of their legal section, who for years and years and years didn't even refuse to believe in the very existence of God.
[time=2093] His wife came to faith and through her changed life and his own personal investigation of the facts.
[time=2103] He was a bright, bright, bright man and he took years and years to study and dig through all the evidence that he could find.
[time=2110] And as he sifted through the evidence and as he saw his wife changed before his eyes.
[time=2115] In 1981 he gave his life to Jesus Christ.
[time=2118] And he writes a book called A Case for Christ and in this book you find this interview, which I'm going to just share some excerpts from with you today with Alexander Matharel.
[time=2128] And Strobel begins to ask him about the realistic historical approach to the scourging and crucifixion.
[time=2135] Tell me I said, "What was the scourging like?" Matharel's eyes never left mine.
[time=2141] Roman scourgings were known to be terribly brutal.
[time=2143] They usually consisted of 39 lashes but frequently were a lot more than that, depending on the mood of the soldier applying the blows.
[time=2150] The soldier would use a whip of braided leather.
[time=2154] Braided leather thongs with metal balls woven into them.
[time=2157] When the whip would strike the flesh, these balls would cause deep bruises or contusions, which would break open with further blows.
[time=2165] And the whip also had pieces of sharp bone and metal as well, which would cut the flesh severely.
[time=2171] The back would be so shredded that part of the spine was sometimes exposed by the deep, deep cuts.
[time=2178] The whipping would have gone all the way from the shoulders down to the back, the buttocks and the back of the legs as well.
[time=2184] It was absolutely terrible.
[time=2188] One physician who has studied Roman beatings said as the flogging continued, the lacerations would tear into the underlying skeletal muscles and produce quivering ribbons of bleeding flesh.
[time=2199] A third century historian by the name of Eusebius described a flogging by saying, "The sufferers veins were laid bare, and the very muscles, sinews and bowels of the victim were open to exposure."
[time=2210] We know that many people would die, Matharelle continued, from this kind of beating,
[time=2216] before they ever got to the crucifixion.
[time=2219] At the least, the victim would experience tremendous pain and go into hypovolemic shock.
[time=2225] Matharelle had thrown in a medical term I didn't know.
[time=2228] "What does hypovolemic shock mean?" I asked.
[time=2230] Hypo means low.
[time=2232] Vol refers to volume, and emic means blood.
[time=2235] So hypovolemic shock means the person is suffering the effects of losing a large amount of blood.
[time=2242] With the heart races to try to pump blood that isn't there.
[time=2246] Second, the blood pressure drops causing fainting or collapse.
[time=2249] Third, the kidneys stop producing urine to maintain what volume is left.
[time=2253] And fourth, the person becomes very thirsty.
[time=2256] As the body craves fluids to replace the lost blood volume.
[time=2261] Later we read that Jesus said, "I am..." what?
[time=2265] Thirsty.
[time=2267] At which point a sip of vinegar was offered to him.
[time=2270] Because of the terrible effects of this beating, there is no question.
[time=2274] Matharelle concludes that Jesus was already in serious to critical condition even before the nails were ever driven through his hands and feet.
[time=2282] "What happened?" I asked when he would arrive at the side of the crucifixion.
[time=2286] Well, he would have been laid down and his hands would have been nailed in the outstretched position to the horizontal beam.
[time=2293] The Romans used spikes that were five to seven inches long and tapered to a sharp point.
[time=2297] "They were driven through the wrists," Matharelle said, pointing about an inch or so below his left palm.
[time=2304] "Hold it." I interrupted.
[time=2306] I thought the nails pierced his palms.
[time=2308] That's where all the paintings show.
[time=2310] In fact, it's become a standard symbol representing the crucifixion.
[time=2314] Through the wrists, Matharelle repeated.
[time=2317] This was a solid position that would lock the hand.
[time=2320] If the nail had been driven through the palms, his weight would have caused the skin to tear and he would have fallen off the cross, so the nails went through the wrists and it's important to understand that the nail would go through the place where the median nerve runs.
[time=2335] This is the largest nerve going out to the hand and it would be crushed by the nail that was being pounded in.
[time=2343] The pain was absolutely unbearable.
[time=2345] He continued. I thought this was fascinating.
[time=2347] In fact, the pain was literally beyond words to describe.
[time=2352] They had to invent a new word, excruciating.
[time=2356] Literally, excruciating means out of the cross.
[time=2361] Think of that.
[time=2362] They needed to create a new word because there was nothing in the language that could describe the intense anguish caused during the crucifixion.
[time=2371] At this point, Jesus was hoisted as the crossbar was attached to the vertical stake and the nails were driven through Jesus' feet.
[time=2378] Again, the nerves in His feet would have been crushed and there would have been a similar type of pain.
[time=2383] What stresses would this process have put on His body, I asked?
[time=2388] Well, first of all, His arms would have immediately been stretched probably about six inches in length
[time=2394] and both shoulders would have become dislocated.
[time=2397] You can determine this with simple mathematical equations.
[time=2401] This, I might add, fulfilled the Old Testament prophecy in Psalm 22, which foretold the crucifixion hundreds of years before it took place and says, "My bones are out of what?" Joint.
[time=2416] Once a person is hanging in the vertical position, he replied, "Crucifixion is essentially an agonizingly slow death by asphyxiation." The reason is that the stresses on the muscles and diaphragm put the chest into the inhaled position.
[time=2431] Basically, in order to exhale, the individual must push up on his feet so the tension on the muscles would be eased for a moment and doing so, the nail would tear through the foot, eventually locking up against the tarsal bones.
[time=2445] After managing to exhale, the person would then be able to relax down and take another breath in.
[time=2451] Again, he'd have to push himself up to exhale, scraping his bloodied back against the coarse wood of the cross.
[time=2457] This would go on and on until complete exhaustion would take over and the person wouldn't be able to push up and breathe anymore.
[time=2465] As the person slows down his breathing, he goes into what is called respiratory acidosis.
[time=2471] The carbon dioxide in the blood is dissolved as carbonic acid, causing the acidity of the blood to increase.
[time=2477] This eventually leads to an irregular heartbeat.
[time=2479] In fact, with his heart beating erratically, Jesus would have known that he was at the moment of death,
[time=2485] which is when he was able to say, "Lord, into your hands I commit my spirit," and then he died of a massive cardiac arrest.
[time=2493] Having heard from an expert who has spent his life studying the real thing,
[time=2503] how many of you saw the movie?
[time=2505] So let me ask you, how accurate do you feel like Gibson was?
[time=2511] And I just got to ask, is there like anybody in the room who would think that he just passed out?
[time=2521] But really, really smart people for a long, long time, because they are so against the truth.
[time=2529] Happy trying to get you and I to believe that the cool breeze of a tomb woke him up.
[time=2539] Others will say he really didn't exit the tomb on his own.
[time=2543] They'll say and they have for hundreds of years that his body was stolen.
[time=2547] Have you heard that? That's right.
[time=2549] They will say that the disciples, this brave and fearless band,
[time=2555] were going down to the end with him, right?
[time=2559] Some would say that the disciples attacked a Roman cohort of over a hundred soldiers and physically opened the sealed tomb and stole the body, the dead body, and took it somewhere where it was never found.
[time=2574] The Bible gives you and I a much different picture.
[time=2579] The Bible would say the scriptures would teach that he really came back to life.
[time=2583] He really exited the tomb on his own. Look at John chapter 20.
[time=2587] Go to John chapter 20.
[time=2590] It says in John chapter 20, now we'll pick it up in verse 1.
[time=2595] It says in John chapter 20 verse 1, "Now on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene came early to the tomb while it was still dark and saw the stone already taken away from the tomb.
[time=2607] So she ran and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved and said to them, "They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, we do not know where they have laid him." It says in verse 3, "So Peter and the other disciples went forth and they were going to the tomb." In verse 4 it says, "The two were running together and the other disciple ran ahead faster than Peter." A lot of it was kind of interesting. John is writing this. And who's the other disciple? John. He's kind of bragging on his speed, I think.
[time=2639] The two were running together and the other disciple ran ahead faster.
[time=2643] He had to throw in that faster word. Faster than Peter.
[time=2646] And John came to the tomb first and stooping and looking in, he saw the linen wrappings lying there. They would have wrapped the corpse in linen wrappings, right? He sees the linen wrappings lying there, but he did not go in. John, the cautious one, right? He looks in, he's not going in, but raise your hand if you know who is going in.
[time=2666] Next verse. And so Simon Peter also came following him and entered the tomb and he saw the linen wrappings lying there and the face cloth, which had been on his head, on the Lord's head, not lying with the linen wrappings, but rolled up in a place by itself.
[time=2682] Do you think the disciples would have done that? If they could have gotten through the hundred soldiers and if they could have opened the sealed tomb and if they were going to steal a corpse wrapped in linen, would they have stopped, paused, unwrapped the body, taken the head covering off, folded it in?
[time=2702] So the other disciple who had first come to the tomb then also entered and he saw and what?
[time=2710] Believed. For as yet they did not understand the Scripture, then he must rise again from the dead.
[time=2718] Goes on in verse 10, so the disciples went away again to their own homes, but Mary was standing outside the tomb weeping and so as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb and she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head and one at the feet where the body of Jesus had been lying. You see over here they did a great job this week of just kind of building what would have dimensionally and visually looked somewhat like this bed of Christ. And you can see it sitting right over here and it was empty and they see she sees the bed and the angels sitting at the head and at the feet and they said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?" She said to them, "Because they have taken away my Lord and I do not know where they have laid him." When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there and did not know that it was Jesus.
[time=2770] Jesus said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking supposing him to be the gardener?" She said to him, "Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him and I will take him away." And I love this. Jesus said to her, what? What did he do? He called her by what?
[time=2786] Name. What must it be like to have Jesus, the Son of God, know you by name and call you by name. And she had heard him call her name so many times that as soon as he says her name boom. She turned and said to him in Hebrew, "Robonai." "Robonai" which means teacher.
[time=2810] He wrote a Matthew 28. Matthew 2811 says in Matthew 2811, "Now while they were on their way home some of the guard that had been at the tomb came into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened.
[time=2826] And when they had assembled with the elders and consulted together they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers and said, "You are to say his disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep. And if this should come to the governor's ears we will win him over and keep you out of trouble because if they had fallen asleep they would have been executed.
[time=2850] And they took the money and did as they had been instructed. And this story was widely spread among the Jews and is to this day.
[time=2862] That a bunch of fishermen came and took on a praetorian guard, rolled a stone back, unwrapped a dead body, folded a headcloth in the corner and took them away to a place we never know.
[time=2876] And I just got to remind you this, okay? I mean if there's any part of that that like starting to make sense for you and you're kind of starting to go and now that might have happened. Let me just remind you that every one of them, every one of these disciples died for their faith. Every one of them was martyred.
[time=2896] These men were crucified.
[time=2900] These men were beheaded. These men were tortured and beaten. And you're telling me they would have done that knowing that the whole thing was a was a sham?
[time=2912] Who's going to do that?
[time=2916] Answer? Nobody.
[time=2920] And you know what else he did?
[time=2924] He really died. He really exited the tomb and he really appeared to many. Like the first Corinthians.
[time=2932] First Corinthians, back to first Corinthians 15.
[time=2936] First Corinthians 15. Verse 1 says, "Now I make known to you, brethren, the gospel, which I preach to you. Which also you received and which also you stand." And Paul goes on in verse 2 and says, "By which also you were saved. If you hold fast the word which I preach to you unless you believed in vain." And in verse 3 he says, "For I delivered to you as a first importance what I also received. That Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures.
[time=2964] And that he was buried. And that he was raised on the third day according to the scriptures. And that he appeared to us to Peter. If you look in Mark 16 I believe.
[time=2980] I'll just throw this out to you. I think it's so cool. In Mark 16 and in a few other places when the angels are telling folks to go and tell, who's the first guy they always say to go tell first? Peter.
[time=2996] Who do you think felt the worst? Of all the disciples.
[time=3000] Who? And I just like I appreciate like the Lord's sensitivity, I think to him. It's always like we go tell Peter.
[time=3008] Make sure Peter knows that he appeared to Kefus then to the 12. After that he appeared to more than 500 brethren at one time, most of whom remain until now. But some have fallen asleep.
[time=3020] Then he appeared to James then to all the apostles.
[time=3024] And last of all as to one untimely born he appeared to me also. He appeared to Mary Magdalene in John 20 to the other women in Matthew 28 to Cleopas and another disciple on the road to Emmaus in Luke 24 to the 11 disciples and others in Luke 24 33 to 10 apostles and others with Thomas absent in John 20 to Thomas and the other apostles in John 20 26 to 7 apostles in John 21 to the disciples again in Matthew 28 16 and he was with the apostles at the amount of all of this before his salvation in Luke 24 50 and Acts 1 4 to 9. He appears to Peter. Peter alone mentions his personal encounters with the risen Lord. You can write this down Acts 2 32 Acts 3 15 Acts 10 41 He appears to Paul. He appears to the 12. He appears to Peter.
[time=3076] You know what? He appeared to me.
[time=3080] Not in the same way. And I know he has appeared to many of you. It was September 1983 Sunday evening service back row right side Grace Community Church Dr.
[time=3092] John MacArthur teaching Roman 7 Oh wretched man that I am who will save me from this body of sin. And I fully surrendered my heart and life to him at the age of 20. And you know what?
[time=3104] He appeared. He showed up in that moment. He changed me. He entered my life. And I look out into this room this morning and I could just run person after person after person right by you here today. And they would testify to you that he has appeared. That he has shown up. That he is alive and active. And you know what? This morning as we conclude we've got to ask the question you've got to ask the question. I'm hoping you're thinking it. Why?
[time=3136] So why does he do it all? Why go through it all? Why go through and suffer the humiliation and the beating and the death? Why be forsaken by the Father? And if you were going to write one thing down today here's the one thing I would want you to write down. If you were going to walk away with one truth here's the truth I would want you to walk away with today.
[time=3156] And that is that the answer to the question why? Why go through it all?
[time=3160] Why endure it all? Because our sin needed to be forgiven. Why?
[time=3168] Why do it so that our sin could be forgiven? Hold your chain quietly in your hand. Would you look at that chain? People, let me just remind you of something. Most of you in the room don't need to be reminded of this today but the chain represents sin. And you know what sin does? Sin does. What change do? Sin captures us. Sin condemns us. Change. You know they imprison us and they bring us into bondage.
[time=3200] It destroys us and there are many many in the room today and you know exactly what I'm talking about. You know exactly what it was like to be under the power of bondage. To be under the power of sin. You remember what it was like to have the chains of sin wrapped around your life. Some of you in the room today they're still there. And before we go today I got to ask you one question. How are you going to break free from this? What are you going to do?
[time=3232] What is it that you're going to somehow accomplish that's going to somehow erase the power of these that are wrapped around your heart? And you know they're wrapped. If they're wrapped around your heart and you're here today you know it. What are you going to do? You know what?
[time=3252] You can't do a thing.
[time=3256] He really died. He really rose from the tomb. He really came back to life. He really appeared to many.
[time=3264] And as Corbin begins to play this song I just want to make sure you understand that in response to that you and I really must respond.
[time=3276] We really must respond to him.
[time=3280] We got to respond to this empty bed because it really happened.
[time=3288] And it's why he did it. He did it so that you and I could be freed from the bondage of sin.
[time=3296] And I want to give you an opportunity this morning. I know we're going a few minutes long but it's Easter. It's alright.
[time=3304] Listen, there are some in the room today. We're going to give you an opportunity to respond. And there are some in the room today. And you are his. You have fully surrendered your heart and life to him.
[time=3316] And you sit here today and you are so grateful that you are no longer held prisoner by this.
[time=3324] Do you experience sin? Yes. Do you struggle with sin? Yes.
[time=3328] But you know him. And in that relationship with him you know you have been freed from its power. And so this morning we want to give you the fully surrendered an opportunity to come.
[time=3340] I'd love for you just to look at that empty bed. I'd love for you to just consider these truths that we've looked at. And in a moment of sheer gratitude. I'm just going to invite you to stand up as you sing the song that Corbin wrote. He wrote it specifically for this series.
[time=3356] And what a great truth it proclaims. And as we sing it I'm just going to invite you to come down. There's some receptacles here in the front.
[time=3364] There's a few in the back and some up and just drop these chains in because you're free.
[time=3372] Others of you here today watch this. Others of you here. You are you know him. You've surrendered your heart and life. But right now today in your life and I don't know the exact situation but you are under an onslaught of temptation.
[time=3388] The enemy is doing his very best to have you back in these.
[time=3396] And you may this morning though you could absolutely come and drop yours in the receptacle as well. You may want to take this and find a good friend who loves you. Maybe he or she is standing right next to you. Maybe they're across the room and you can go find them if you want to. But if you're under temptation you can go and you can give this to them. It's part of being in the body of Christ. You see we bear up with each other. We hold each other up.
[time=3424] We paracolao. We come alongside. And you may just want to give this to them and say would you please pray with me? Would you please pray for me?
[time=3432] Would you call me like nine times this week? Because I need your help. Just one more group.
[time=3440] And I say this to you this morning you know me. You know us. I say this to you with the utmost of respect. But there's a third group in here and I'm going to ask you. I mean unless you'd like to talk this morning which we will Steve and Mitch and I will be right down here.
[time=3456] But if you're going to walk away this morning and not have put that stake in the ground. If you're going to walk away this morning not knowing him not coming to him seeking the forgiveness which he is so willingly offered. If you're going to walk out of here today still searching and going to ask you to keep this. Because this it's still there.
[time=3484] The power of sin is still in your life.
[time=3488] And I don't say that disrespectfully and I'm not slapping you on the wrist. I'm just saying to be free of this you've got to come to him. And so if you'd like to come to him you can come talk to us and we'll talk that through with you.
[time=3504] If you want to hang on to it and leave come back keep asking stay on the journey. But if you know him and you want to come drop it in as an act of gratitude come do it and if you want to share it with a friend and ask for their prayers do it.
[time=3520] But let's just stand and let Corbin kind of start us off and as he does he'll ask you to join him here in just a minute. But listen to the words and you respond in whatever way you need to.
[time=3532] (Music)
