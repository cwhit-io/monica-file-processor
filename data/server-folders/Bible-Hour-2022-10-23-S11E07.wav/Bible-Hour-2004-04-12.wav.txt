[time=626] O, the wonder of His heavenly touch,
[time=633] fill this sorrow, fill this sorrow, our world of history.
[time=642] How it reaches deep and deep, restoring by the soul, and making the ever whole.
[time=656] [MUSIC - 1 seconds] (upbeat music)
[time=688] [MUSIC - 152 seconds]
[time=841] Thank you for the hearts and the minds that are open to your Word. We ask Father that we receive your teaching and that we embrace it and walk throughout the week with it.
[time=856] Heavenly Father, we ask for your blessing upon this group of people as we proceed with the day in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=868] I tell you what, I know it's the week after Easter, but maybe we could just do what we did last week again. Why don't you just repeat after me and we'll just say it this way.
[time=880] He's still alive. Say that back. Christ has risen. And someday, so will we. That's all right to do that again. Amen. So good to have you here and so thankful for the opportunity.
[time=897] To be together again and to have the privilege. And I hope you always, I know we are always struck by the privilege of opening this book.
[time=910] You understand that? First Peter 3, it tells us who teach. It says, "Let him who teaches speak as if it were the very utterances of God."
[time=923] Wow. What an amazing gift. What an amazing opportunity he gives us to not just speak it, but to be in a place like this where we can take it in and allow it to do what only God's Word does.
[time=942] It changes us. It transforms us. And for that, we're really grateful. Hey, next week we are going to take a Sunday and we're really looking forward to it.
[time=953] The message, the talk that we're going to have next week will center around the mission of Blackhawk. If you want to be reminded, and I hope you do, every once in a while, it's good to be reminded biblically why we do what we do here.
[time=967] If you're interested in knowing what it is we're about, if you have an interest in learning more about what it is we value and why.
[time=974] If you want to kind of just get an insight look into the heart of this place and these people come next week as we revisit our vision and our mission.
[time=983] The following week, which is the first Sunday in May, will have an entire Sunday morning dedicated to global ministry.
[time=990] Our work, our opportunity that God allows us to work in ministry here in Fort Wayne, here in the States, and also across the world.
[time=999] It's going to be a really, really good morning and a great insight opportunity for all of you to see what's going on with Blackhawk and our ministries across the world.
[time=1009] And then the next Sunday, May 9th, Mother's Day, we begin a seven week series entitled For Better, For Worse.
[time=1015] God's design for marriage and family, and we will do our very best with His help to really address biblically the issues that you and I face today in marriage.
[time=1028] The challenges that we face in parenting and God's design for family.
[time=1033] It promises to be not because of those who will bring it, but because of the source of it.
[time=1040] It promises to be life changing and we're looking forward to that.
[time=1044] But this morning, we are going to come back and we are going to revisit a series that we began some 20 weeks ago, I think.
[time=1051] If you'll remember, if you've been around here, you know that we have been studying verse by verse, passage by passage, this great book of 1 Thessalonians.
[time=1059] Would you get your Bibles out and would you open up to 1 Thessalonians?
[time=1063] And what Mitch and I miss this is Mitchell Cruz, Dr. Mitchell Cruz, for those of you that don't know him, and for those of you visiting today, we have the privilege of possessing here at Blackhawk what we call a teaching team.
[time=1078] Sometimes that means that different ones of us will teach, sometimes it means that we teach together.
[time=1084] Mitch is part of that team as is Steve Longbreak and we are thankful to get to come back to this first Thessalonians study, and today we're going to do our best to wrap it up.
[time=1095] And we're going to wrap it up in a way that I think is really, really interesting because the apostle Paul ends his letter to the church at Thessalonica.
[time=1104] He ends the letter much in the same way that he began the letter.
[time=1109] And I want to take you back just for a minute, can we go back to the very beginning of 1 Thessalonians, 1 Thessalonians chapter 1, because you'll see in verse 3, three phrases.
[time=1120] And back months ago when we first studied this passage, we took an entire morning and looked at these phrases, and I want to just bring those three phrases back to the forefront of your hearts and minds this morning.
[time=1133] These are three very descriptive phrases. These are three phrases that Paul uses to describe what was going on in the family of God, in the church there at Thessalonica.
[time=1144] These are three phrases I would long for us to be described as.
[time=1150] These are three truths that I would love to have and long to have present in my own life. These are three very important principles.
[time=1159] And as Paul, who has received a really encouraging report from Timothy, Paul planted the church at Thessalonica, some great work was done.
[time=1169] There was this church that was started, there were those who responded to the gospel. Paul works with them, Paul disciples them, Paul builds into them, but then Paul has to leave.
[time=1180] And so now he's curious as to how they have progressed in their faith, so he sends Timothy back and Timothy comes back to Paul with a really, really good report.
[time=1189] And you see that, begin to come out in 1 Thessalonians chapter 1 and watch for, look at these three phrases that Paul uses.
[time=1196] He says in verse 2, "We give thanks to God always for all of you, making mention of you in our prayers. Constantly, here we go.
[time=1204] Constantly bearing in mind your work of faith, your labor of love, and your steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the presence of our God and Father."
[time=1221] There you have it, three very important phrases for you and I to just kind of get familiar with all over again here this morning.
[time=1230] Let's just look at those three briefly, just so we're all on the same page.
[time=1233] He says he's grateful that they possessed a faith that works. If you're taking notes today, just write this down.
[time=1239] People, he was so encouraged because the faith that they proclaimed, what they said they were, what they personally and publicly professed, they said they believed.
[time=1254] They said they were in relationship with Christ and he was so grateful and he still is today when what you and I say is what you and I do.
[time=1268] Their faith had works. Were they saved by their works? No.
[time=1274] You and I are not saved by our works. Our works, what we do, how we speak, how we live, how we conduct and carry ourselves, gives evidence to what's inside here.
[time=1287] And their faith was working and they were also loving, a love that labors.
[time=1295] See, in Thessalonica, there was a potpourri of religions, of pagan religions, and so Paul saying, "Hey, look, I want to show you a faith that really, really works."
[time=1306] And in their culture, they had a cult, primarily it was called "caborous" and it was all about fulfilling your desires.
[time=1314] It was a harbor town and it's where desires got filled and it was all about making money because they made a lot of money in their economy from it.
[time=1321] And so a love that labors it is in stark contrast to the life that these people were being called from.
[time=1330] The church at Thessalonica is getting called out of a culture.
[time=1335] We're fulfilling your every sexual desire, even in worship, homosexuality, all that is there and available just walking down the street.
[time=1349] And see, that's very interesting because we say today, you know, today it's a lot different.
[time=1355] We have the internet and you can get anything you want in our culture on the internet.
[time=1358] You can fulfill any sexual desire.
[time=1360] You can see any kind of sin you want on the internet.
[time=1363] Well, it's the same there.
[time=1364] It was live and it was readily available.
[time=1367] And Paul says, "There's a stark contrast to that." And that's a love that labors, a gape, that kapas.
[time=1376] The concept here is self-sacrificial love that actually serves another human being based on his or her needs in God.
[time=1390] And that is a huge contrast to what that culture is hearing.
[time=1395] It's a huge contrast to what we hear today.
[time=1399] And if a faith that doesn't work is like an obstacle in that flow of God to me and then me horizontally out to others.
[time=1408] Well, a love, a love that doesn't labor is a love that wants to take love from God and just keep it for myself and not serve other people.
[time=1416] So a love or that lust in their culture would be selfish.
[time=1423] Not self-sacrificial, but selfish.
[time=1427] A faith that had no works would be an obstacle.
[time=1431] A love that did not labor would be selfish, lust, and a hope that endures the third thing.
[time=1438] He was so grateful that they possessed a hope that endured a steadfastness of hope, as it says in the NAS.
[time=1447] Look at chapter 1, verse 9.
[time=1449] Look at chapter 1, verses 9 and 10. He refers to that here. He says in verse 9, "For they themselves report about us what kind of a reception we had with you and how you turned to God from idols to serve a living in true God."
[time=1464] And verse 10, "And to wait for what?
[time=1469] To wait for His Son from heaven whom He raised from the dead, that is Jesus who rescues us from the wrath to come."
[time=1478] You see, the problem is so many times you and I, so many times in this culture of ours, you and I look to so many other things to rescue us from whatever pain, whatever tension, whatever pressure we might be feeling.
[time=1494] They were a people who had early in their faith learned to wait on Him.
[time=1500] They were willing to look forward to the long-term satisfaction that would be theirs.
[time=1507] Regardless of what might transpire in the immediate, they were a people who had learned already to have a hope that endured to wait on Him.
[time=1517] Long-term satisfaction versus immediate gratification, immediate short-term now make me feel good now.
[time=1525] I want to feel better now kind of thinking.
[time=1530] And He was so grateful that their faith really had works, that their love really labored and that their hope was a hope that endured.
[time=1540] A hope that doesn't endure, a hope that doesn't endure is really just wishful thinking, really just wishful thinking.
[time=1550] He takes these three things and Mitch is going to show you how he just kind of threw out the entire book.
[time=1558] He revisits these three concepts and then watch how he ends it.
[time=1563] That's where we're going. You're really going to be encouraged.
[time=1566] This was a letter not written with chapter and verses that happened in the 1200s where the Archbishop of Canterbury, Stephen Langton put chapters and verses to the letter.
[time=1575] But it's a letter that would be written to churches in Thessalonica and it would circulate from house to house and they would read it aloud in times of worship in its entirety.
[time=1583] Okay, so Paul opens up with that opening and Thanksgiving section in the first chapter and he says it's about these three things.
[time=1590] It's about a faith that works, it's about a love that labors and it's about a hope that endures.
[time=1594] How do we know that? Timothy told them they're struggling with these things.
[time=1598] They're struggling, man. They come out of a pagan culture where you can worship anything and it's all about the economy and it's a hard thing because they want to make money.
[time=1606] And they come out of a culture that has that lust thing going on and a love that labors, that's foreign to them and they're being radically different than the culture.
[time=1615] And they're really confused about what's going to happen on the return of Christ.
[time=1620] And some of them aren't even working and we just need your help on those things. And so Paul says that.
[time=1624] And like Kelly said, in the end of that Thanksgiving section he comes to verse 9 and he says, "I heard how you turned to God from idols." That's faith.
[time=1634] How you serve a living and true God, that's love, that labors.
[time=1639] And to wait for his son, that's hope that endures.
[time=1643] And so in chapter 1 he says that. Chapter 2 he kind of tells his story and we talked about that. Chapter 3,
[time=1649] it's real hard on a faith that works. Chapter 4, really clear, a love that labors.
[time=1656] And chapter 5 in the first 11 verses, really, really clear about a hope that endures.
[time=1662] And so he closes the letter, I think, recapping this.
[time=1668] And so if you want to look at verses 12 and 13 we're going to look first at a faith that works.
[time=1674] A faith that works. But we request of you brethren that you appreciate those who diligently labor among you
[time=1683] and have charge over you in the Lord and give you instruction.
[time=1688] See the church grew in homes.
[time=1693] And these are probably the people who opened their homes and who were invested and taught.
[time=1700] So that's probably who he's talking about. And that you esteem them.
[time=1703] So you only appreciate them, you esteem them very highly in love because of their work of faith that works.
[time=1712] And then third, live in peace with one another. So write these three things down that Paul says.
[time=1717] He says, "Appreciate, esteem, live at peace. Appreciate, esteem, live at peace or reconciled with those who are serving."
[time=1730] Here's the deal. Everybody has faith.
[time=1734] We are designed to have faith. Faith is not just mental assent, it's not saying, "Oh, I believe that to be true."
[time=1741] Faith is a commitment or a trust of my entire inner being of my entire life.
[time=1747] Real simple acronym is for saking all I trust him.
[time=1752] For saking all I trust him. Can you remember the new one we learned this morning?
[time=1758] No. Okay. So for saking all I trust him.
[time=1762] Everybody's designed to have it because if I don't trust God, whom am I trusting?
[time=1769] Me. And that's really, really dangerous because you know, since sin has entered the world, we all have broken gas gauges.
[time=1780] It'll come around.
[time=1790] It'll come back. I thought it was coming around Thursday after the elder meeting, I almost ran out of gas.
[time=1795] I was on my way to gas station saying, "Oh, please God, I didn't mean anything by it." It was such a good illustration.
[time=1802] So anyway, if you do run out of gas sometime, call me.
[time=1805] You've got plenty of gas cards. I've got lots of gas cards for you.
[time=1811] So anyway, James writes, "Faith, this vertical distrust in God without works,
[time=1821] flesh it out with other people, appreciate, esteem, live at peace, is dead. It has the spirit of life ripped right from it." And see, the way God's designed it is that it would be this way.
[time=1836] And we fight that and that culture fought that.
[time=1840] See, in God's economy, the pathway up is down.
[time=1844] In God's economy, the pathway up is down. But ever since the sin in the garden,
[time=1850] we have that gap and we're all saying, "I've got to be right. I've got to be best.
[time=1854] I've got to be tops. I've got to be first. I've got to have the most. I've got to be a control."
[time=1861] And Paul says, "Let me tell you about a faith that works because when you realize that he's King, that Christ is King and Christ is Lord and Christ is CEO now of my life,
[time=1872] then all that pressure is removed and I'm free to not lord it over other people,
[time=1879] but to appreciate esteem, live at peace, live in reconciliation."
[time=1886] And really, what he's saying here is that a faith that works is a faith that has deeds of love.
[time=1897] And these are actions. These are some love activity that he is now going to describe for you,
[time=1911] that you and I can see right here in the text that we've got to look at, that you and I must consider you and I have got to if we're going to be a people.
[time=1921] If our faith is going to work, we're going to have to get better at esteeming.
[time=1925] We're going to have to get better at appreciating. We're going to have to get better at living in peace.
[time=1930] If our love is going to be a love that labors, he says there are some things that come with that.
[time=1937] There are some practices. There is some love activity, if you will, that you and I as a family.
[time=1944] These people, he was wanting to make sure they understood this is what that will look like.
[time=1949] Get your pens ready. Here we go. He says in verse 14, "We urge you." That word there urges from paracalado. There's that word again.
[time=1957] "We come alongside you and we point you toward what is right. We urge you," brethren.
[time=1963] "Admonish the unruly. Encourage the faint hearted.
[time=1968] Help the weak. Be patient with everyone. See that no one repays another with evil for evil,
[time=1975] but always seek after that which is good for one another and for all people."
[time=1981] All right. You ready? Here's what a love that labors looks like.
[time=1986] Number one, write it down. Admonish the unruly.
[time=1990] Admonish the unruly. Can I just point this out before we dive in here?
[time=1995] Can you just look back at the text with me or just look at the verse on the screen?
[time=1999] "We urge you," what's that next word saying? Please say it loud.
[time=2003] Brethren. Brethren, it doesn't say we urge you senior pastor.
[time=2008] It doesn't say we urge you paid staff.
[time=2012] It doesn't say we urge you, those of you who feel like you're mature enough and able to do this. No, it says we urge you, brethren.
[time=2022] Those of you that know him, those of you that call this place home, those of you that comprise this family, all of us are called to a love that labors and all of us are called to have it look like this.
[time=2037] It's not just my job.
[time=2041] It's not just his job. It's not just the job of our staff.
[time=2044] No, it is our opportunity and privilege.
[time=2048] Two, here we go. Admonish the unruly. Who are the unruly?
[time=2052] Here you go. Anyone with an actively rebellious attitude.
[time=2059] I don't know if a face just popped into your mind or if your heart just felt convicted.
[time=2066] Anyone with an actively rebellious attitude.
[time=2070] The word in the Greek was often used with military terms, and it had to do with those who were not performing his or her duties.
[time=2076] They were insubordinate and divisive.
[time=2079] The unruly are those whose hearts are bitter, whose demeanor is angry, and in general give off an unsubmissive spirit.
[time=2087] These are the unruly. Anyone with an actively rebellious attitude.
[time=2092] Rebellious from God, rebellious from my spouse, rebellious from my parents, rebellious from authority.
[time=2103] And what in the world are we to do? Paul says we are to admonish them.
[time=2108] You know what the word admonish means? It means to bring them face to face with what is right.
[time=2115] It's going to take you and I swallowing deep, taking a big breath and going out on a limb that sometimes is a bit scary to go out on, but you and I are called, all of us, the brethren, to bring them face to face with what is right.
[time=2127] To warn them, to confront them, catch this here.
[time=2130] To lovingly. To lovingly. This is not a slap in the face.
[time=2135] This is not a finger wagging in their nose saying shame on you.
[time=2139] This is a loving alert that serious consequences are coming.
[time=2144] If the current rebellion or sin doesn't cease.
[time=2148] And please hear this. In Acts 20 you can write this down.
[time=2151] In Acts 2031 Paul said as he was leaving his dear friends at Ephesus,
[time=2157] he says night and day, Acts 2031. Night and day for a period of three years.
[time=2162] I did not cease to admonish you with, anybody know what it says?
[time=2166] With what? With tears.
[time=2170] Okay, just remember that.
[time=2173] When you and I, because we love somebody enough, because we care enough about their lives, because we care enough about the body, when you're willing, and I'm willing to go and admonish, to bring them face to face with what is true.
[time=2186] Paul says that's done with tears.
[time=2189] See, you got to ask yourself the question this morning.
[time=2192] Somebody else's unruliness, somebody else's rebellious attitude, does it make you sad or does it make you mad?
[time=2204] Because if in your admonishment, there aren't any tears, so to speak.
[time=2211] If your admonishment looks more like a finger wagging in somebody's face, if your admonishment or mind comes off more as a shame on you, and we've missed the boat, this is a loving stake in the ground.
[time=2224] I'm on my knees begging you to do what is right.
[time=2228] Because if you don't, brother, or if you don't, sister, the consequences are going to come, the rocks going to go on the pond, and the ripples are going to go.
[time=2238] And so I'm begging you, admonishment says.
[time=2243] Because I'm sad, your sin saddens me.
[time=2249] If your sin angers me, I got to be careful.
[time=2252] In Galatians 6 1, Paul says that, you know, kind of that tears deal is that I go recognizing that I could commit the same exact sin.
[time=2262] Yep, absolutely.
[time=2265] It's a humble realization, but by the grace of God, there go I.
[time=2271] You want your love to be a love that labors?
[time=2274] You, you have to.
[time=2276] You and I get to together admonish, lovingly alert the unruly.
[time=2282] We also need to encourage, keep going in the text.
[time=2284] We also need to encourage the faint-hearted.
[time=2287] Encourage the faint-hearted, whereas the unruly are always pushing the envelope of God-honoring behavior.
[time=2294] The faint-hearted are those who lack boldness and readiness to live out their faith.
[time=2299] They fear change, they want a safe, secure, and predictable Christian life.
[time=2304] They oftentimes know what the right thing to do is they just are, afraid to do it.
[time=2309] They lack the strength and energy to step out on the limb of obedience, and it says to encourage them.
[time=2316] Speak truth into their life.
[time=2318] Come alongside and speak confidence and comfort into the life of another.
[time=2323] Bring a timely biblical reminder.
[time=2325] There are times when I find myself.
[time=2327] There are times when I know Mitchell finds himself.
[time=2330] There are times when, you know, every pastor and staff member on our team can tell you
[time=2336] where we find ourselves coming alongside those saying things like this.
[time=2340] You know what?
[time=2341] You can.
[time=2342] You can trust the Lord with your heart and your needs.
[time=2346] Go love your wife.
[time=2349] I can tell you of times in a restaurant booth or in my office where I have looked across at a man whose heart was hurting, who felt a sense of fear, who was uncertain as to how it might turn out.
[time=2361] When you just kind of put a stake in, you say, "You know what, my friend?
[time=2364] God will." I believe in my heart he will, and you need to as well.
[time=2368] He will take care of your heart.
[time=2369] He will meet your needs.
[time=2371] Go love her.
[time=2373] Go give yourself to her.
[time=2375] Go sacrifice for her and keep doing it.
[time=2380] There are times when any pastor on our staff, myself included, could relate to you stories of looking across the table at one and saying, "You know what?
[time=2389] You can trust him.
[time=2390] You really can.
[time=2391] Tell the truth.
[time=2394] Go speak the truth.
[time=2396] You need to.
[time=2397] It's got to be said.
[time=2398] I know you're afraid.
[time=2399] I know you've built him it inside.
[time=2401] But he's bigger than that.
[time=2403] You can trust him.
[time=2404] Go tell the truth.
[time=2405] You can trust him for the right words I've said to others.
[time=2409] You can trust him for the right words at the right time.
[time=2413] Go have that spiritual conversation with that seeking friend who needs to hear words of truth in life.
[time=2420] Go ahead.
[time=2425] Help.
[time=2426] It says, "Help the weak.
[time=2427] You want to have a love that labors?" Admonish the unruly.
[time=2431] Encourage the faint-hearted.
[time=2433] Before we get to help the weak, Mitch and I were talking earlier about how often times in the church people we've got those two flip-flopped.
[time=2441] You know what?
[time=2442] Too many times.
[time=2443] We encourage the unruly and we admonish the faint-hearted.
[time=2449] And that's not how it's to be.
[time=2452] God says that you and I, we are to admonish.
[time=2455] Wave flags.
[time=2457] Put them in the ground.
[time=2458] Sound the alerts for those with a rebellious attitude.
[time=2462] And we are to come alongside and speak words of encouragement into those who are timid.
[time=2469] Look at this next one.
[time=2470] Help the weak.
[time=2471] I love this.
[time=2472] This was so interesting to look into this week.
[time=2475] You want to have a love that labors?
[time=2477] Paul says, "Help the weak." The weak.
[time=2481] Who are the weak?
[time=2482] Here you go.
[time=2483] Those struggling with their faith.
[time=2489] And especially those who are susceptible to sin in light of their struggle.
[time=2494] These are oftentimes young or new believers still dangerously close to their old life.
[time=2501] And God's word says, "Paul says to this church at Thessalonica." And God says to you and I today, "Help them." You know what the word "help" is that he uses there?
[time=2511] It's really, really cool.
[time=2512] It means, the word is "enteco." A-n-t-e-c-h-o.
[time=2516] Enteco, the Greek word there means to hold on to, to clutch tightly.
[time=2522] You know what it means?
[time=2523] It means that you and I, we know people.
[time=2525] And because of who they are and because of how they're wired, because of whatever past they may have had, because of whatever situation they may find themselves in.
[time=2533] There are people in your life and mind.
[time=2535] And the enemy is over here saying, "Go, go, go." Go back and see you and I to oftentimes act like you're getting pulled.
[time=2546] See, oftentimes you and I, we stand over here.
[time=2551] We know him.
[time=2552] I mean, this is a person in your life.
[time=2555] This is a person in your family.
[time=2557] This is somebody who's part of the body of Christ.
[time=2560] And too many times, you and I, we stand over here and go, "Oh my, I better pray.
[time=2568] Oh Lord, please don't help him." That's not bad to stop and pray, but you know what "enteco" means?
[time=2575] Enteco says this, "Not a chance.
[time=2579] You're not getting him." And we hold him.
[time=2583] I mean, literally figuratively.
[time=2585] We go over and we say, "You know what?
[time=2587] I love you too much." And I know that you're susceptible to that.
[time=2589] "I'm going to enteco you." And we just go, "You're not going that way." You just come right here.
[time=2595] It's just like every week.
[time=2597] Yeah.
[time=2598] So hold on to firmly.
[time=2601] And I, well, I was just thinking, most people like this in this situation really want you to do that.
[time=2609] And they're going to have things come out of their mouth and things that they do that will say, "No, it looks like they want that, but they're dying for you to do that." Yeah.
[time=2617] Dying for you to do that inside.
[time=2618] And I mean literally do this, or figuratively.
[time=2622] But the point is that we don't stand over there and say, "Gee, I hope it turns out all right."
[time=2628] You know, if you want a labor that loves you, enteco, you go and you hold on to them.
[time=2633] It's amazing how few people are willing to do that.
[time=2636] There have been a few times, you know, and I wonder why.
[time=2639] I sometimes wonder why it's only been a few times, but there have been a few times in the 17 years of ministry
[time=2647] that I've been involved in.
[time=2649] There have been a few times where I have just literally at my shepherding wit's end.
[time=2656] I've just gone to the, I've just gone to the guy's house.
[time=2661] I've run out of words.
[time=2663] I've run out of admonition.
[time=2665] There have been times, I don't know if you've ever been there.
[time=2668] But there have been times where I've literally just gone and physically stood there.
[time=2675] And said, "You're not going." Now it helps that I'm six, seven, and yeah, but still the point is sometimes, you know, what would it be like if you and I just went and said, "You know what?
[time=2692] You're not going." Now, I realize, too, that there's a part of that where people have choices to make.
[time=2699] And I know that you and I can't save the world, and we can't stop everybody from their sin.
[time=2704] But in each and every situation, what would it be like if you and I were willing to hold on to firmly, to clutch tightly?
[time=2714] Those dangerously close to their old life.
[time=2718] Then he says, you want to have a love that labors?
[time=2721] Be patient with everyone.
[time=2724] Be patient, he says, with everyone.
[time=2727] Now, we're going to set this one up by looking at the word that he uses there in the Greek when he says, "Be patient." The word is macro-thumeo.
[time=2734] Macro-thumeo.
[time=2736] To stay, watch this.
[time=2738] To stay persistent with those who fail.
[time=2744] To stay persistent.
[time=2746] To stay at it with those who fail.
[time=2749] There are those in everyone.
[time=2751] Meaning, there are those in my life, and I'm sure there are those in yours.
[time=2754] I know there are those in our church, and they continue to come up short.
[time=2759] They continue to choose compromise over commitment.
[time=2763] They've been taught.
[time=2764] They've been invested in.
[time=2766] They've been discipled, and they just keep struggling.
[time=2771] And I was thinking about it just last night.
[time=2774] What did Paul thank God for in Romans 2?
[time=2776] I'll tell you what I thank God for this.
[time=2778] Whenever I read that in Romans 2, I thank God for this.
[time=2781] Paul says in Romans 2, how the kindness and the patience of God leads us to repentance.
[time=2788] I am so thankful that God, macro-thumeoed me.
[time=2797] Anybody here in the room thankful that God was patient with you?
[time=2803] Anybody here in the room feel right now as we say it, what it must have been like for him to watch you fail again and again and again.
[time=2813] And whether we're talking about his patience in your salvation or whether we're talking about his patience in your sanctification.
[time=2823] He is a God who continues to extend to you and me this kindness, this patience.
[time=2829] And so Paul says, be patient.
[time=2831] You and I say with who, he says with everybody.
[time=2836] Who you giving up on?
[time=2839] Who have you thrown the towel in on recently?
[time=2842] And why?
[time=2844] I understand.
[time=2845] There are times when certain, okay, this is a small category of folks though.
[time=2852] There are times when certain choices get made and we go, whoa.
[time=2856] Okay, you're over there now.
[time=2859] But that's a small category.
[time=2864] He says be patient, long-suffering.
[time=2871] And then he closes it by saying don't repay evil with evil.
[time=2874] You see that there in the text?
[time=2875] See that no one repays another with evil for evil, but always seek after that which is
[time=2882] good for one another and for all people.
[time=2886] Somebody asked me, what does that mean?
[time=2887] Don't repay evil with evil.
[time=2889] I said it means don't repay evil with evil.
[time=2893] This one's not hard.
[time=2895] Not a lot of Greek help on this one, all right?
[time=2898] This just means when somebody does you wrong, when somebody mistreats you, when somebody
[time=2905] exercises evil against you, don't pay them back.
[time=2910] And put a period right there.
[time=2912] No comma.
[time=2913] Just boom.
[time=2914] Don't pay them back.
[time=2917] Now my sinful nature, the sinful part of me that says it's here, it's in me.
[time=2926] I fight it daily and I'll tell you what, that's the natural response, yeah?
[time=2932] Somebody does you wrong, somebody does me wrong, whether it's in my home, whether it's here in our church, whether it's out on the road.
[time=2939] Somebody does evil to you, you just want to boom, fire back.
[time=2944] Make it right, but you don't make it right and I don't make it right.
[time=2947] We just make it more what?
[time=2948] We just make it more wrong.
[time=2951] Imagine, would you just imagine for a moment what he might do with a room full of people
[time=2957] this size, who if in every relational situation where it's going south, where evil's being
[time=2963] perpetrated against you, you and I just made it our policy.
[time=2968] Boom, evil hits.
[time=2970] Okay, how can I repay him or her with good?
[time=2975] How can I exercise kindness?
[time=2977] How can I be encouraging?
[time=2979] How can I extend myself even further?
[time=2982] Now, there are times yes when that interchange has to stop.
[time=2987] But again, that's a small percentage and there's a road he usually allows us to travel where reciprocating with good can take place, admonish the unruly, encourage the faint hearted,
[time=3003] help the weak, be patient with everyone and don't repay evil with evil, a labor of love.
[time=3013] And then he closes out the passage and closes up the book with a look here at a hope that
[time=3019] endures verses 16 to 24.
[time=3021] A hope that endures, hope is not wishful thinking, hope is confident assurance.
[time=3027] Endures, hoop a meno that means to be in or to be under meno, the abiding in Christ.
[time=3034] I'm in him and that's where hope comes from.
[time=3037] That's where confident assurance comes from and that's where verse 16 rejoices always.
[time=3043] That's where that comes from, it's from Christ.
[time=3046] Still, I mourn with those who mourn, but I rejoice always.
[time=3050] Not happiness, not happy, happy and happen.
[time=3054] Come from the same root word that means for the moment.
[time=3056] This is joy that you have in your soul, in your heart because you are in Christ.
[time=3062] So rejoice always.
[time=3063] Verse 17, pray without ceasing.
[time=3066] Without ceasing, the Greek adverb there is like a hacking cough.
[time=3070] It doesn't mean that I'm going to be on my knees beside my bed for my entire life.
[time=3075] What it means is that with my life, I have that connection in my heart to God's heart with my soul.
[time=3083] And it means, yes, I will never let prayer leave my life.
[time=3088] I will always pray alone.
[time=3091] I will always pray with my spouse.
[time=3093] I will always pray with my family.
[time=3095] I will always pray in the church because that is where the hope comes from.
[time=3101] [AMEN] And then finally he says, in everything, give thanks for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus.
[time=3108] Give thanks.
[time=3110] You ever notice how the same two people could look, I mean two different people could look at the same situation
[time=3116] and one could rejoice and one couldn't.
[time=3119] One could bring prayer to the table and one couldn't be disconnected from God.
[time=3124] One could bring a thankful attitude to the situation and one can bring an unthankful attitude.
[time=3130] You know, just like if your car runs out of gas.
[time=3133] You need to be thankful that you have a car.
[time=3136] [AMEN] With a broken gauge.
[time=3142] If your kid comes home or your child comes home and here she says something or tells her about a decision they made
[time=3149] it isn't the way you would have done it.
[time=3151] Be thankful you have the child.
[time=3153] When something happens at your house, you know, oh, not again.
[time=3156] Be thankful you have the home.
[time=3159] You don't want to pay taxes.
[time=3160] Be thankful you have the income.
[time=3161] You know, it just goes on and on and on.
[time=3163] And look at this common thread.
[time=3165] Rejoice always.
[time=3168] Pray without ceasing always.
[time=3172] In all things, give thanks.
[time=3176] Uninterrupted abiding in Christ, the power of the Holy Spirit in you brings joy.
[time=3185] He brings prayer and brings thanks.
[time=3190] And you know why?
[time=3193] Because a faith that works.
[time=3195] God is faithful.
[time=3198] A labor that loves God is loved.
[time=3201] And a hope that endures to Paul writes in 1 Timothy 1, 1.
[time=3205] Jesus Christ is our hope.
[time=3210] And so it goes on and says don't quench that spirit in you.
[time=3213] Stop the preaching discern, abstain from every form of evil.
[time=3218] It says any appearance of evil in the King James.
[time=3222] And he says now may the God of peace himself sanctify you.
[time=3225] He's actually molding and shaping me to give me that hope that endures.
[time=3232] And be preserved complete without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ because God is faithful.
[time=3239] [AMEN - 1 seconds] You know, at the most difficult time in my mother's life, and she's had a lot of trauma, was about
[time=3250] when Meghan was, my oldest daughter was about six.
[time=3254] And to kind of teach Meghan on how we're going to go through this difficult circumstances together,
[time=3261] set up circumstances together, we're not going to give thanks for the circumstances.
[time=3264] We're going to give thanks to God in the circumstances.
[time=3267] And so I said Meghan, I just want to teach you this Bible.
[time=3270] It's old enough.
[time=3271] I think you can remember this bill passage and it's rejoice always.
[time=3274] Pray without ceasing.
[time=3276] And all thanks give thanks.
[time=3279] And we were at an auction in Orlando, Florida, and she was there with us because the auction was at Disney World.
[time=3285] And my mom was with us and she was staying with us.
[time=3288] And Meghan want to prove to me that she had memorized these verses.
[time=3292] And so she brought me this.
[time=3293] I've carried it in my Bible ever since, but we've gotten so many things that have been carrying in my Bible
[time=3299] that just to kind of preserve them, notes from you, I've just had to keep them in a different place.
[time=3304] And there it was.
[time=3306] But here's why I'm telling you this.
[time=3308] This is a precious commodity to me.
[time=3312] But she practiced it with my mom, who was going through the most traumatic experience of her life.
[time=3318] And my mom came out to me after Meghan had done this and she said, "I've memorized that because I've determined that in these circumstances I can rejoice always.
[time=3328] I can pray without ceasing.
[time=3330] And in all things I can give thanks." And that's what a hope that endures does.
[time=3337] It's contagious.
[time=3338] [AMEN] Every single one of these things that we've shared with you as a vertical component, that we get it from God and a horizontal component, that we release it to others.
[time=3348] [AMEN - 4 seconds] Hey, would you stand with us as we close?
[time=3355] Let me just say this to you before we go.
[time=3357] Listen, I think it's very important, especially in light of what Mitch just shared.
[time=3361] And it is something that it may sound real simple to you, please.
[time=3365] Don't leave before you go.
[time=3367] Wait, catch this.
[time=3368] In this culture of ours, in this world of ours, people, we have been programmed.
[time=3374] We have been told.
[time=3375] It has been yelled.
[time=3376] It has been screamed.
[time=3377] It has been broadcast.
[time=3379] They have tried to get it into our minds every way they can.
[time=3384] They have tried to convince you and I that joy is circumstantial.
[time=3391] My friends, joy is not circumstantial.
[time=3396] Joy comes in knowing Him.
[time=3398] Joy, a deep abiding sense of peace comes in knowing Him.
[time=3404] Joy comes in being in prayer.
[time=3407] Joy comes in being in relationship with Him.
[time=3410] Joy comes in a grateful heart.
[time=3412] No matter the circumstance.
[time=3415] And that's not just like theory.
[time=3417] That really can happen when you know Him.
[time=3422] You don't know Him.
[time=3423] It won't happen.
[time=3425] You don't know Him.
[time=3426] You won't be joyful.
[time=3428] Circumstances will absolutely flatten you.
[time=3433] But when you know Him, when you're fully surrendered to Him, the amazing truth is that joy is not circumstantial.
[time=3441] It comes in knowing Him.
[time=3443] Let's pray.
[time=3444] God, as we leave this place today, we pray, God, that you would take this truth.
[time=3449] God, and those of us in the room here today that know you.
[time=3452] That have a relationship with you.
[time=3454] God, I pray that you would take this truth.
[time=3457] And that you would change us today and tomorrow and this week.
[time=3461] God, that we would interact with people differently.
[time=3464] That our love at home with our spouse.
[time=3467] That our love with our children.
[time=3470] That our love extended to those we work with.
[time=3472] God, our love toward those in our lives.
[time=3475] God, that it would be a love that labors.
[time=3479] And God, that we would have a hope that endures.
[time=3483] And God, we thank you for that hope.
[time=3485] And we commit to you again, God, to go to leave this place to follow you with all of our hearts and to come back again, Lord willing.
[time=3493] To be encouraged, to be taught again, to be reminded again of who you are.
[time=3497] Thank you for your Word.
[time=3498] Thank you for your Spirit.
[time=3500] God, thank you for your people.
[time=3503] And may we continue to just bring honor and glory to you, a God who is worthy of our praise.
[time=3510] We thank you.
[time=3511] We love you.
[time=3512] God, in your son's name we pray.
[time=3513] [AMEN]
