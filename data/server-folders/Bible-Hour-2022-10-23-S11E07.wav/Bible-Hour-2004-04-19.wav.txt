[time=0] (bells ringing)
[time=30] (upbeat music)
[time=82] - Hi, my name's Kelly and I have the privilege of serving as pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries, and I'm so thankful that you've tuned in to the broadcast again.
[time=91] Hey, it's late April, moving toward May, which means it's time each and every year for me to be donning my, well, I don't know if they can get a shot of this, my Los Angeles Laker gear.
[time=105] Some would say I may be underdressed, but again, April, May, June, it being MBA, playoff season, me and my purple and gold, it's that time of year.
[time=116] So, I'm so thankful for the opportunity to share with you today on the broadcast what I think is gonna be, I think from most of you, very, very encouraging truth.
[time=128] A lot of people ask me about Black Hawk and what we're really about, why it is we do what we do.
[time=136] They'll sometimes wanna know, hey, Pastor Kelly, what is it about Black Hawk that makes it unique or tell me about your mission?
[time=144] I mean, why do you all do what you do at Black Hawk?
[time=147] I think a lot of times folks sense that there's real purpose in what we do and you know what, they're right.
[time=155] There really is and I would just invite you today to open your mind and to open your hearts.
[time=161] Many of you have churches that you're a part of.
[time=165] Again, we're so thankful for that.
[time=167] Others of you are looking for a place to belong and I would guess that what you'll hear today from God's word, what you'll see as we met last week and as we were able to present this message, I think it's really, really interesting stuff.
[time=184] I think it's stuff worth giving your life to.
[time=186] That's why I do what I do.
[time=188] And I would guess that for many of you, it will be very, not only encouraging, but for many of you even inviting.
[time=195] And so I can't wait for you to see it.
[time=196] I can't wait for you to catch the heart behind Black Hawk and I hope you enjoy it.
[time=203] I also wanna let you know this.
[time=204] You'll see the information here on the screen, but starting next week on May 9th, Mother's Day, we begin what many of us here at Black Hawk feel like is going to be an absolutely significant series, a series much needed in the lives of our people, a series much needed more than likely in your life.
[time=226] I know it's needed in mind.
[time=228] We are going to do a seven week series entitled, For Better, For Worse, God's Design for Marriage and Family.
[time=237] For Better, For Worse, God's Design for Marriage and Family.
[time=240] Let me ask you this.
[time=242] How's your marriage?
[time=243] How is it?
[time=245] I mean, really.
[time=246] How's your relationship with your husband?
[time=249] How's your relationship these days with your wife?
[time=252] And while we're asking questions, how's it going with your kids?
[time=257] In your relationship with him or your relationship with her, in your relationship with the family, are things getting better?
[time=265] Are you growing and your understanding of how it is you can honor God and each other?
[time=270] Is there greater degrees of harmony, greater levels of peace?
[time=274] Is there a greater sense of intimacy?
[time=276] Or are things going in the other direction?
[time=279] I don't know how many times, just this week, I've pumped into people, had conversations, gotten emails.
[time=288] So much of it has to do with the battles that we're facing, with the issues that we're encountering in the marriage and family arena.
[time=297] So we just decided, that's it.
[time=299] We're going to give seven, who knows?
[time=301] Maybe eight, nine, 10 weeks to a study from God's Word on marriage and family.
[time=306] And we would love for you to come and be a part of it.
[time=309] And you know what?
[time=310] I bet you know some people who would benefit from a look into God's Word.
[time=315] He designed it.
[time=316] He's the one that created it.
[time=317] He's the one that put it together.
[time=319] He put down the blueprints for marriage and family.
[time=324] And so many of us, myself included at times.
[time=326] We live life.
[time=328] We conduct ourselves in marriage and family without really, really looking at that plan, without becoming very, very familiar with his design.
[time=340] And with him, the designer, so please come.
[time=343] May 9th, for better, for worse.
[time=346] God's design for marriage and family.
[time=347] Bring some friends, bring yourselves and join us.
[time=351] We'll look forward to having you with us and we'll look forward to seeing what God's going to do in your family and in your marriage and in mine.
[time=358] Thanks.
[time=359] Hey, this morning, what we're going to do is just dedicate the morning to kind of a midstream reminder on why it is we do what we do.
[time=370] Oftentimes, people will ask me, hey, what are you guys about really over at Black Hawk?
[time=375] I mean, what is it that you're really, really trying to accomplish?
[time=378] And that's a really, really easy question for me to answer.
[time=382] And we just take a couple Sundays a year and please don't view it as filler.
[time=388] This is not a throwaway day.
[time=390] This is a very, very important day, especially for those of us that call Black Hawk home because what we're going to talk about today, the truth that we're going to consider today is in essence kind of what you've signed up for.
[time=405] I mean, if you call this place home, if this is family, then we are together giving ourselves to something very, very important.
[time=414] And I take it, we take it very, very seriously.
[time=418] Jesus, when he was, he had come, he had lived, he had been crucified, he had gone into the tomb, he had been raised three days later, now he had appeared to many and now he's getting ready to leave.
[time=428] He's going to go back to the Father and he's going to leave this small but faithful band of Christ followers, he's going to leave them and he's going to charge them with the changing of the then known world.
[time=444] That was their opportunity.
[time=446] That was the task that he leaves them with.
[time=450] They get to be the first Christ followers to begin to share, preach, proclaim and live out their faith in a lost and dying world and in doing so, God uses this faithful band to change the then known world and that changing of the world hasn't stopped.
[time=471] We continue today to have the privilege of engaging in that very same endeavor.
[time=476] Look in your Bibles at Matthew 28.
[time=478] This won't be on the screen, I don't think, but look with me, Matthew 28.
[time=484] If you don't have a Bible, that's all right.
[time=485] Just look on with someone nearby or just listen real close.
[time=489] It says in Matthew 28, very last passage recorded here in the book of Matthew.
[time=495] But the 11 disciples, verse 16, Matthew 28, 16,
[time=501] but the 11 disciples proceeded to Galilee to the mountain which Jesus had designated when they saw him, they worshiped him, but some were doubtful and Jesus came up and spoke to them saying, all authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.
[time=518] Go, here you go, these two verses captured all right here.
[time=522] Go therefore, verse 19, go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[time=532] He says to these disciples, this faith that you've embraced, this relationship that you have entered into with me, go and share that, go and proclaim that, go and live that out and in doing so, others will come to know me, go he says and baptize them.
[time=550] Once they've come to know me, baptize them and then he says in verse 20, teaching them.
[time=555] Don't stop it just, don't stop it just going
[time=561] and proclaiming and them responding and you baptizing them.
[time=566] Don't stop there, he says no, then verse 20, very important, he continues then he says teach them.
[time=572] Teaching them all to observe all that I commanded you and you and I, many in the room this morning, know the makeup of these 11 and they were a good band of guys and they were pretty faithful, but boy, they'd been through a lot in recent months and a lot in recent weeks and days even, right?
[time=595] And you can imagine, I think they probably understood the gravity of what he was saying.
[time=600] I think they began to realize he was leaving and he was charging them, you and I and he was charging them with this unbelievable opportunity
[time=614] and so I love how he adds there at the end and low.
[time=617] Hey, don't worry, it'll be all right.
[time=620] I am with you always, even to the end of the age
[time=628] and so here at Black Hawk from this church is very beginning people in a trailer across the street some 30 plus years ago with a young pastor by the name of David Jeremiah.
[time=642] From the very beginning of this place and God's work here at Black Hawk, it has all been based on, it has always been based on, it is based on and forever as long as we have the opportunity to lead and love.
[time=657] It will be connected to what this book says and in this book, in these ancient words, we see it right there, that this is why, this is why I get up every day.
[time=670] I get up every day of my life, hopefully in an effort to bring honor and glory to him and to give myself to this great commission.
[time=678] And at Black Hawk, we just say it a little bit differently than you read it in the text, but it is the exact same thing.
[time=687] We are trying with his help to come alongside and help seeking people.
[time=691] Find front end, verse 19.
[time=695] We're trying with everything we have.
[time=697] We're gonna put as many resources and as many people and as much prayer and as much effort.
[time=703] We're gonna throw as much ministry as we can into this process of trying to help.
[time=709] We know he saves them, but he has for some reason allowed you and I the privilege of participation in that.
[time=716] And so we're gonna do our best to help them find.
[time=719] But that's not all we're gonna do because if that's all we ever did, nobody would ever grow, nobody would ever mature, nobody would ever get discipled.
[time=726] We're gonna also throw a lot of time and a lot of effort and a lot of resources and a lot of ministry toward helping them know, having found him what it means to follow him, to be a follower of Christ.
[time=741] We're trying to help seekers find and follow Christ and by virtue of just that statement, you would realize that following Christ, the end product, if you will.
[time=751] And we believe that's what honors God.
[time=754] We believe that's what he desires to see those who would grow to be Christ followers, fully surrendered Christ followers.
[time=762] If that's the end product, then it would beg the question, what does a follower of Christ look like?
[time=769] If we're to be prayerfully and passionately about, if we're to be a church who's trying to help seekers find and follow Christ, then how will we know when we've got one?
[time=780] How will you and I know when we're growing in that endeavor,
[time=786] what does a follower of Christ, a fully surrendered Christ follower look like?
[time=792] How do they live?
[time=793] How do they act?
[time=794] How do they speak?
[time=795] How do they respond?
[time=798] And this is the question that we bring to the table, so to speak this morning.
[time=803] And we are so thankful that God's word speaks so very clearly to this question.
[time=808] As leadership here at Black Hawk over the last several years, we've sensed him being very faithful to kind of define for us through the scriptures, what a follower of Christ looks like.
[time=819] And we've come to, as we've studied and prayerfully considered the scriptures, five, we call them our five Es.
[time=828] And then those of you that are kind of a verse to lists, please hang in there with us this morning.
[time=833] These five Es are so much more than words that start with E.
[time=837] These are five truths.
[time=840] These are five biblical principles that you and I are called to live our lives by.
[time=846] And so these five things are very, very important.
[time=848] This morning is an opportunity for you, whoever you are, for however long you've known him, this would be for those who do know him.
[time=856] And whether you've known him for three weeks or whether you've known him for 30 years, it's an opportunity for you and I to come to the pages of scripture and say, "How am I doing?" And my effort and my desire to follow him fully, how am I doing?
[time=870] Because we believe that when you and I are given to that humbly and sacrificially and wholeheartedly, God uses that activity.
[time=882] God uses that to help others find and follow.
[time=886] And so we wanna give ourselves to these five things.
[time=888] All right, get out something to write with.
[time=890] And we're gonna look at the text and we're gonna have some fun as we go.
[time=894] Number one, first E here at Blackhawk, that you and I need to be giving ourselves to, that you and I need to be surrendered to, that you and I need to understand mentally and spiritually is an E that we'll call exaltation.
[time=908] Write that down, exaltation.
[time=909] It says there in Romans 12.1, you can open up your Bibles and turn there if you'd like.
[time=914] You can read it from the screen, Romans 12.1.
[time=916] Paul says, "I urge you therefore, brethren, paracolado." I come alongside and I point this out to you by the mercies of God to present your bodies, your mind and your heart and your arms and your legs and your feet and your hands, to present all of yourselves a living and holy sacrifice acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship.
[time=943] Whenever you hear exaltation around here, the first phrase that comes to my mind, the first phrase I want to come to your mind is the phrase a life of worship, a life of worship.
[time=955] This verse speaks to an entire life surrendered to him.
[time=960] Our worship extends beyond the 70 minutes or 75 sometimes.
[time=965] On Sunday mornings, to every arena of life and our willingness to offer him in those arenas, a living and holy sacrifice, people, following Christ, you want to ask yourself this morning, how am I doing in my endeavor to become a fully surrendered follower of Jesus Christ?
[time=984] How is it going in the exaltation arena?
[time=988] Your life, all of it, being an act of worship and offering to him.
[time=996] Let's just look at a few scenarios.
[time=999] Kristen, would you come up, please, and Jared and where's Abby and PT, you guys come on up here?
[time=1006] Once you guys stand there at the end of the table
[time=1012] down there a little bit, Jay right in the middle here and Kristin down at the end of that, there you go.
[time=1017] This is, come down at this end a little bit there.
[time=1021] Everybody say hi to Kristin, say hi, Kristin.
[time=1024] And let's just think about living a life of worship and we'll just identify some different, you're all in this room and you all represent different stages of life and we're not going to hit everybody here but we'll just try, okay.
[time=1038] This is Kristin, this is Simone.
[time=1041] Everybody say hi to Simone, six months old.
[time=1045] And now what we're going to do here is just kind of depict the life of, and I'm not trying to stereotype all ladies in the room by any means, but this is what some of you in the room have to deal with.
[time=1060] I mean sometimes it just gets towards Maddie.
[time=1062] Come on up here Maddie, Maddie, there you go.
[time=1065] Maddie, I want you to stand over here.
[time=1067] Everybody say hi Maddie, you can wave back.
[time=1070] There you go, you staying here next to her, right there.
[time=1072] Okay, that's good.
[time=1074] And we've got that and we've got that and I think we're good there.
[time=1079] Now we've got, oh I forgot one more thing here.
[time=1082] Come on up here, there we go.
[time=1085] Watch this.
[time=1088] Thanks Stacy.
[time=1089] This is Quincy, right?
[time=1090] All right, come on Quincy.
[time=1092] There we go.
[time=1093] (audience laughs) There we go.
[time=1096] All right, you hold on to Quincy there Kristin, there you go.
[time=1099] All right, oh it's so funny.
[time=1101] Oh it's just kidding.
[time=1104] Quincy's a good dog, and now here's the deal, watch this.
[time=1107] This is, okay, hang on there, right there.
[time=1112] And then we've got, and then we've got Mr. Entrepreneur, Mr. Businessman here.
[time=1119] And there's a lot that comes with his world.
[time=1123] We got the cell phone and we've got the palm, pilot, pocket, whatever PD, whatever they call those things.
[time=1131] We got the briefcase here, throw that on over there Jay.
[time=1134] Good job, put that on.
[time=1137] And we got that, okay.
[time=1140] You got your sound.
[time=1141] And then we've got the default God of this century.
[time=1148] Right here, it's a wallet, it's cash.
[time=1152] And that's what, that goes right there.
[time=1155] And then we've got, how old are you guys?
[time=1158] 16, 17, 15, 16 and 18, PT, Abby, say hi to PT and Abby.
[time=1163] And then you guys just turn around like this, and this is a high school aged couple,
[time=1174] a boy and a girl in their teens, in high school, in this culture, in this society, in this internet, MTV video age of ours.
[time=1187] Right here, okay, now watch.
[time=1192] It says in, not only Romans 12, but it says in 1 Corinthians 10, 31.
[time=1199] If you'll look on the screen, it says that in all of life, whether then you eat or drink, all right?
[time=1204] Whatever you do, pretty much cover it all, right?
[time=1208] Whether you eat or drink, whatever you do, God's word says, do all to the glory of God.
[time=1215] And then it also says in Hebrews, in Hebrews chapter 12,
[time=1221] let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us and let us run with endurance, the race that is set before us.
[time=1232] How are we gonna do that?
[time=1233] How are we gonna glorify God in everything we do?
[time=1237] How are we gonna run this race that God has set before us with endurance and hope?
[time=1242] How are we gonna be a people, young, old, in between businessmen, moms, couples, living lives of worship by fixing our eyes.
[time=1252] And if ever there was a day when you and I would need to do this, it would be today to fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith.
[time=1264] Now watch, see here's what happens though.
[time=1266] What happens is, and there's a lot of ladies in this room this morning who are identifying already with this picture, what happens sometimes is the head goes down, the eyes go down because this little precious, little precious Simone right here, this can get to be a little taxing at times.
[time=1289] She doesn't always cooperate.
[time=1292] And then, Maddie, I want you to tug on Miss Kristin's, like you do with mom sometimes.
[time=1295] There you go, tug like, like you wanna, yeah, yeah, you do that, see, yeah, that goes on.
[time=1299] And then this, this is, you know, this isn't every night, but this is, you know, you're trying to have that be some nights and she's crying and she's tugging in that house, it's just getting really, really dirty and the eyes are down and then this gets run every once in a while.
[time=1312] And then it just gets, it just gets a little overwhelming.
[time=1316] You know what?
[time=1317] Oh, and then he needs to be walked.
[time=1319] Or he needs to be cleaned up after.
[time=1322] And she's off at whatever she's off at.
[time=1324] And so, even though she promised she would pick the stuff up, it doesn't, you know, she.
[time=1330] Do I have an amen from any moms in here?
[time=1332] Okay, now watch this, it gets kind of serious though here.
[time=1335] Hang with me.
[time=1336] With the eyes down, as much as we can laugh at this, all of this day after day after day after day after day.
[time=1344] Can begin to inject words like chaos,
[time=1353] despair with the eyes down, this gal,
[time=1359] can quickly begin to lose hope.
[time=1362] You know what?
[time=1364] I've heard it said, and you've maybe said these words oftentimes a phrase that comes out of this mouth in the midst of all of this.
[time=1373] I mean, it can even get to the point where you hear things like, I don't like my life.
[time=1377] And I don't mean suicidal, I just mean we get to points where we just, it's just so much.
[time=1384] I don't like my life and the eyes are down.
[time=1388] Over here, we get a guy or a gal, a businessman or woman.
[time=1394] And I'm telling you, we got, we got files galore in this briefcase because there's presentations to make.
[time=1400] I'm telling you, there's clients to pitch.
[time=1402] I'm telling you, there are places to go and there are things to accomplish.
[time=1407] And not only are there files in here, but we're spending, you know, hours and hours each day with this thing ringing right here.
[time=1414] It goes off all the time and the conversations are being had and the files are growing and the information's being inserted into the pocket deal and all the people are there and all the notes and all the addresses and all that you can talk on it and you can email on it and you can make appointments with it.
[time=1431] And it's all about trying to get more of, with the eyes down, this.
[time=1437] Growing this, growing this kingdom, little K, you with me?
[time=1443] And people begin to be pawns and teams and employees
[time=1449] begin to get controlled and manipulated because this guy or gal is so given to this because the eyes are down and life's about him and advancing him and staying on top of them.
[time=1466] It's power, it's control, it's profit.
[time=1468] I'm telling you, he or she is absolutely given to this.
[time=1474] You wanna find out, just get in his way and watch what he does to you.
[time=1480] Down here with eyes down, we have a high school couple
[time=1490] and I'm here to tell you people, it's harder for them
[time=1497] than it was for me.
[time=1499] The things that they see, the stuff that they come across,
[time=1505] the messages that get absolutely blared into their ears, minds and hearts, the opportunities that present themselves.
[time=1513] And that's just them individually.
[time=1515] Now you've kinda got a relationship going on here.
[time=1519] And what this culture, what this society, I mean let's just be straight, what the enemy tells them they should do, experience and take part in in their relationship, all of which is absolutely contrary to what God has called them to.
[time=1539] With their heads down, with their eyes fixed on themselves and they're fun and they're pleasure.
[time=1546] Boy, I tell you, these guys, not these two kids specifically
[time=1552] but this picture, I'm here to tell you people, they are getting slaughtered daily in this culture of ours.
[time=1563] And so God's word says, you know what?
[time=1565] Either situation.
[time=1567] Let's come back down here to mom.
[time=1569] See what can really happen is that the eyes can come up and even though, right watch, even though she still cries and she still tugs on her on her sweater and even though there's still a how and food to make and a dog, all that hasn't gone anywhere.
[time=1586] But with her eyes fixed on Jesus, with her relationship with Him growing, not shrinking, with her heart completely given to Him, all of this becomes, watch this, an opportunity, she begins to view in her mind an opportunity to worship.
[time=1605] She gets to, you know what she gets to do?
[time=1608] She gets to model the joy of serving.
[time=1613] She gets to model the joy of giving herself to others
[time=1619] and it's an act of worship and it's not easy and it doesn't all just all of a sudden become like, you know, no big, no, it's still very challenging.
[time=1627] But her hand is raised, her eyes are up.
[time=1630] This guy right here, all of a sudden watch this, just in one pose, the whole thing changes.
[time=1636] All of a sudden, he still got the briefcase, all right?
[time=1639] He's still going to the meeting and he's still pitching his deal because God's giving him a gift and God's giving him a company or God's giving him an opportunity and so he's gonna stay up late as late as he should and prepare for those meetings.
[time=1650] He's gonna answer the phone calls.
[time=1652] He's gonna enter the data.
[time=1653] He's gonna, you know what?
[time=1654] He's even gonna make some money.
[time=1656] But what he has done just by virtue of his eyes now being fixed, he's changed his entire posture and now he's about the kingdom, big K.
[time=1668] And now the people in his world aren't there to be controlled.
[time=1672] The people in his world aren't there to be stepped on.
[time=1675] The people in his world, the team that works for him, they're not there to make him rich, no.
[time=1681] They're there for him to invest in.
[time=1684] They're there for him to help grow and challenge.
[time=1687] This actually comes over here.
[time=1693] Now, life of worship.
[time=1700] A life of worship, now you know what?
[time=1701] These two with their heads up and their eyes fixed.
[time=1705] This is really cool.
[time=1707] They can still, they can still enjoy high school kids.
[time=1712] Listen, they can still enjoy being together.
[time=1717] They can still, you know what?
[time=1718] They can enjoy a really godly, god honoring relationship.
[time=1723] They can serve God together.
[time=1726] They can be a part of the body of Christ together.
[time=1729] They can, because of what God's word says, honor each other physically instead of violating each other physically.
[time=1738] They can have God honoring fun.
[time=1742] They can have a deep and friendship.
[time=1744] They can serve God.
[time=1745] They can bring honor to God.
[time=1746] By the way, they conduct themselves at 1030 on Friday nights when the movie's over and it can all be very hands up.
[time=1753] It can all be very God honoring.
[time=1756] It doesn't have to get negative.
[time=1759] It doesn't have to get disobedient.
[time=1761] It doesn't have to lead to compromise and a life full of regret.
[time=1766] A life of worship.
[time=1771] Say that back to me.
[time=1772] A life of worship, say it back.
[time=1773] Again.
[time=1776] It's not 70 minutes.
[time=1779] It's every single day in whatever arena you're in.
[time=1784] A willingness to say, you know what God, I'm gonna do this for you.
[time=1788] All right, give these guys a hand.
[time=1791] You guys can have a seat.
[time=1792] (audience applauding) Thank you very much.
[time=1796] Nexty, hope you're taking notes.
[time=1800] Hope you're writing some of this stuff down.
[time=1803] Nexty is evangelism.
[time=1806] Actually, Jay, why don't you stay here and grab your Bible.
[time=1809] There you go.
[time=1810] Grab your Bible then stay here.
[time=1811] Tom, why don't you come on up.
[time=1812] Here's the deal with evangelism.
[time=1813] Look at that first Peter 3.15.
[time=1815] But sanctify, you can turn there if you'd like.
[time=1818] But sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts always being ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you, yet with gentleness and reverence.
[time=1831] Repeat that last line with me.
[time=1833] Actually read it with me, yet with gentleness and reverence.
[time=1838] Every encounter, a divine appointment.
[time=1841] When you hear exaltation around here, I think a life of worship.
[time=1845] When you hear evangelism, I think every encounter, a divine appointment.
[time=1850] You see it right there.
[time=1851] We commit to view each and every encounter as divine.
[time=1856] And regardless of the encounter's duration, be it brief or the beginning of a redemptive friendship, we long, do you?
[time=1863] We long to point each and every person toward Christ.
[time=1869] Every encounter, a divine appointment.
[time=1872] Now here's the deal.
[time=1874] There are those in this world of ours, and there are those in your life and mine, and they have not come to a place of faith in Christ as of yet.
[time=1883] We call them all kinds of things.
[time=1886] It's just who they are.
[time=1888] They just haven't come to that point yet where they've drawn that line in the sand and put that stake in the ground and said, "I believe, Lord, I'm yours." Some are skeptical.
[time=1899] Some just, they're just not convinced, and they've just kind of got this slightly built up wall going and they're just skeptical.
[time=1910] Some are genuinely searching.
[time=1913] Some are seeking.
[time=1915] Some are very open to conversation and relationship, and they're not quite there yet, but they're looking.
[time=1923] And others, you know what?
[time=1924] Remember the chains that we had a few weeks ago?
[time=1927] Others are just absolutely wrapped up tight in their sin.
[time=1934] Their hearts aren't softening.
[time=1937] In fact, probably truth be told, their hearts are hardening, and they are really committed to their sin.
[time=1943] And you and I have the opportunity to interact with,
[time=1949] come alongside, befriend, give time and effort and prayer toward all three groups.
[time=1956] We've got believers.
[time=1957] We've got those who have drawn that line.
[time=1959] We've got those who have given themselves completely to Christ.
[time=1963] And as believers, we know that these folks are deeply embedded in the heart of God.
[time=1970] God longs for them to come to faith.
[time=1973] We've got an approach problem though at times.
[time=1977] Just real quick Mitch and Brent Imer, next week you're gonna talk a lot about, I'll take that.
[time=1984] They're gonna talk a lot about this E, and we'll just show you a quick picture here.
[time=1987] Sometimes the approach is all wrong, yet with gentleness and reverence.
[time=1994] And yet sometimes we come at this guy with, see this looks like a big mallet.
[time=2000] All right, I know it is a mallet, but today we're gonna pretend like it's a gavel.
[time=2004] Are you with me?
[time=2006] A gavel.
[time=2008] Who swings a gavel?
[time=2010] A judge, and a judge swings a gavel, and he's pronouncing what?
[time=2015] Judgment.
[time=2018] And so many, we might not like try to do it, but too many times this is how we come off.
[time=2024] Too many times this is the message this guy gets.
[time=2028] Shame on you.
[time=2030] Well here's the problem with that.
[time=2033] Okay, last I checked, it was pretty recent too.
[time=2037] God's word said that conviction, conviction, the judgment of one spirit was the job of the Holy Who.
[time=2047] Holy Spirit.
[time=2050] See, conviction isn't your job.
[time=2053] Judgment's not for us to pass.
[time=2057] Them beginning to feel uncomfortable or uneasy, which happens with their sin.
[time=2062] That's not your responsibility.
[time=2065] It's the Holy Spirit's responsibility.
[time=2067] And so an approach like this is to be replaced, God's word says, we're to extend not a gavel, but a hand.
[time=2077] And you know, extending a hand could look a lot of different ways, but the bottom line is watch this with the truth of God's heart right in here.
[time=2085] And a smile on our face, because this is a life-changing opportunity.
[time=2090] We get to extend not only the truth of God's word, 'cause this is what draws them to Him, but ourselves right here, not there, right there.
[time=2100] Gentleness with reverence, with respect.
[time=2106] First Peter 3 says, good job, have a seat, thanks.
[time=2110] Next E, write this one down, encouragement.
[time=2113] Oops, Tom, don't go away, sorry.
[time=2115] Encouragement, encouragement, look with me.
[time=2118] And if one can overpower Him who is alone, raise your hand if you agree with that statement.
[time=2124] Raise your hand if you agree with the statement that on your own you can become easily overpowered.
[time=2130] Raise your hand, you agree with that?
[time=2133] All right, good.
[time=2134] And one, and if one can overpower Him who is alone, two can resist Him, accord of three strands is not quickly torn apart.
[time=2143] What a great verse, Ecclesiastes 4, 12.
[time=2146] But here's the problem.
[time=2149] Hey, Tom, would you put this on there for me if you would.
[time=2152] The problem is, is that so many times you and I want to approach life.
[time=2158] So many times there are those of us in the room who want to approach Christian living, this living out of our relationship with Him alone.
[time=2166] You see, 'cause we're convinced that we're tough enough.
[time=2168] Here, you can put that on.
[time=2170] Won't mess up your hair.
[time=2171] We are convinced that we're tough.
[time=2177] We're convinced that we're able.
[time=2179] We're convinced that we've got all the things that we need.
[time=2182] We've got Bible knowledge.
[time=2184] We've got 10, 15 years of a growing faith.
[time=2186] We've got all kinds of insights.
[time=2188] We can, we think, pretty much tackle anything that comes our way.
[time=2194] We are going to go out and we are going to do battle.
[time=2196] We are Rambo Christian.
[time=2199] Watch out.
[time=2201] Alone.
[time=2204] Not going to sit around some living room with eight other people talking about how I'm struggling with a reoccurring sin.
[time=2212] Not going to do it.
[time=2212] Don't need them.
[time=2214] I Rambo.
[time=2215] Not going to sit around and admit to people week after week that I need their help.
[time=2223] Raising my kids because I'm Rambo.
[time=2227] I can do it.
[time=2228] Interesting thing.
[time=2231] When you study the armor of God, in the New Testament there, it's an amazing picture of how when we cover ourselves with the armor of God, the sort of truth and the breastplate of righteousness and the hell.
[time=2246] It's an amazing picture of this warrior ready for spiritual battle, right?
[time=2252] And in no way are we trying to signify or identify a weakness in that, right?
[time=2260] Corbin and I were talking this week about this and he mentioned that he had had a conversation with a friend and they had kind of just noticed that if we were going to, step out there a little bit there, big guy, if we were going to just make an observation about the armor of God, if there was one part of the body anatomy that's not covered it would be the what, the back.
[time=2284] Question for you this morning.
[time=2288] You Rambo do it yourself type.
[time=2291] Who's got your back?
[time=2293] Answer, if you're alone, answer, nobody.
[time=2300] Boom, you're dead.
[time=2302] Don't fall.
[time=2304] See, here's the thing, Kristen and Jared, come on back up, hold that there.
[time=2311] I'm all right.
[time=2312] I think God's all right with the, I'm all right with you going to battle.
[time=2317] I'm all right with you, you know what, it is a battle and I'm okay with you having all the garb and the helmet and the breastplate.
[time=2323] That's a good thing.
[time=2324] You ought to be ready to fight the good fight, amen?
[time=2328] But you cannot, you guys come in here back, back to back kind of like a dare you go.
[time=2333] You cannot walk that road alone.
[time=2337] Somebody has got to have turned.
[time=2340] Somebody has got to have your back.
[time=2343] All right?
[time=2344] Does that make sense?
[time=2348] If you try and walk that road alone, you will get killed.
[time=2353] In fact, I learned in between services that this is actually how they fought.
[time=2358] That when the lines would break down and it was time for hand-to-hand combat, they would literally get back just like this.
[time=2368] And I got you and you got me and we're going to walk through this together and I'm going to encourage you with your parenting and I'm going to be someone that you can confide in with that reoccurring sin and we're going to come alongside you as you try and keep up with life.
[time=2383] You know what, we're going to do that together.
[time=2385] Authentic living in biblical community.
[time=2389] Real life, real life change happens best in settings that promote intimacy, honesty and accountability, places where we experience the joy of knowing and being known, loving and being loved.
[time=2403] Not alone with family.
[time=2406] How you doing?
[time=2408] Followers of Christ, fully surrendered.
[time=2411] Followers of Christ are growing in exaltation, living lives of worship.
[time=2417] They're growing in how they view every encounter as a divine appointment.
[time=2421] They're growing in authentic living in biblical community.
[time=2426] All right, give these guys a hand, you can have a seat.
[time=2428] (audience applauding) All right, next, equipping, equipping.
[time=2439] Thank you.
[time=2441] Let's do this, we'll mix it up a little bit here.
[time=2445] I need, let me get two couples.
[time=2449] Shocks, you want to help me out here?
[time=2451] And the Smiths, Curtis and Jesse.
[time=2452] I saw you guys coming up here.
[time=2454] I didn't even ask these guys that I could do this.
[time=2455] I just said it in front of a thousand people.
[time=2457] So what are they going to do, like say no.
[time=2459] So you guys come up here and have a seat, Smiths and shocks.
[time=2462] Sit there, oh, bring your Bibles.
[time=2463] If, oh, did you bring, oh, never mind, I want to ask you.
[time=2465] If you've got, it's an awkward thing there.
[time=2468] Did you bring Bibles?
[time=2469] Got you.
[time=2470] Bring your Bibles up here, good job.
[time=2472] Good to see you, Shocks, Smiths.
[time=2474] Thanks for coming up.
[time=2475] Appreciate the purple and gold there, Curtis.
[time=2478] Fellow Laker fan, have a seat there on the pew.
[time=2482] This is equipping, all right?
[time=2486] You guys are all sitting in a what?
[time=2488] Pew, right?
[time=2489] Here we got a pew, right here.
[time=2490] Just like on a normal Sunday morning.
[time=2492] We got ourselves a pew.
[time=2493] And the cool thing about equipping here at Blackhawk is this, it's two, it's two fold, all right?
[time=2498] It's a coin with two sides.
[time=2500] Watch, watch with me here.
[time=2502] He gave some as apostles and some as prophets and we believe the apostles and prophets, biblical apostles and prophets, those offices are no longer filled.
[time=2513] They were at one time, now they're not, but he has maintained evangelists and pastor teachers.
[time=2519] He has given apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastor teachers for the equipping of the saints for the work of service to the building up of the body of Christ.
[time=2530] Here you go, equipping.
[time=2531] Here's what I want you to think.
[time=2533] Clearly taught, hopefully it's clear.
[time=2536] Clearly taught to uniquely serve.
[time=2542] Here at Blackhawk this reminds us of two very important truths.
[time=2546] We as leaders must faithfully equip Christ followers so they can in turn exercise their unique gifts while equipping and serving others.
[time=2556] So here's your pew, here's your four Christ followers.
[time=2559] They come, I want you to notice a couple of things about these four, some obvious things.
[time=2566] First of all, they're here, all right?
[time=2571] They got up.
[time=2573] You with me?
[time=2577] They're here.
[time=2580] And this is not a pastor lecture.
[time=2582] This is not, I don't got a ruler.
[time=2583] I'm not looking for the back of your hand, all right?
[time=2586] I'm just reminding us that if Hebrews 10 says, "Do not forsake the gathering." We need to be together.
[time=2596] We need to, you and I need to be in places where the Word of God gets invested, where the Word of God gets deposited into your life.
[time=2604] And it's here on Sunday mornings.
[time=2605] It's power equipment, guys.
[time=2607] On Thursdays, ladies, it's precepts.
[time=2608] On Wednesdays, it's common ground.
[time=2611] With Pastor Mitch on Wednesday nights, it's everywhere you go in this place.
[time=2616] We are doing our best to take this and make a deposit into your life.
[time=2620] And hopefully, it's encouraging and sometimes it feels convicting.
[time=2624] And other times, it really begins to make sense, but it's the truth of God's Word going into your heart and life and changing you.
[time=2631] And that's an awesome, awesome thing.
[time=2634] Why would you miss that?
[time=2635] I'll let that one just kind of hang out there for a second.
[time=2642] Why would you not be here?
[time=2646] Now, 12-o-5 comes and I pray or we sing a last song and it's time to go.
[time=2653] So you guys just get up and just start walking out that aisle right there.
[time=2657] Good job, just start to walk out there.
[time=2659] And that's what you and I do.
[time=2661] Oftentimes, center aisle just right down the center.
[time=2663] There you go.
[time=2665] And then I'm gonna say, okay, stop right there.
[time=2666] Oh, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[time=2668] Here's the deal.
[time=2669] You can look back at me.
[time=2670] I gotta ask them.
[time=2673] But see, I gotta ask all of you too.
[time=2675] Okay, you've just done this.
[time=2678] Okay, where are you going?
[time=2679] And what are you gonna do?
[time=2683] And too many times we get up and we walk out this aisle and through those doors.
[time=2689] And the next thing we do with the greatest endeavor of all
[time=2695] is just come back here and sit back in the pew.
[time=2698] Well, but you know what?
[time=2700] God's Word says it really differently and I'm just gonna read it to you, okay?
[time=2704] He's gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as pastors and teachers.
[time=2709] What am I, what, what do, I get a check every two weeks from this place that I am so incredibly grateful for.
[time=2718] Others on this team, you know, we're paid to come and give our lives to the greatest endeavor of all.
[time=2724] And that verse says that it's our job to equip you to do the what?
[time=2729] Say it, please, to do the work of service.
[time=2735] Okay, you four, come here.
[time=2736] Here's what I want you to do.
[time=2737] Hold out your arm, Curtis.
[time=2739] There you go, bow right there and then stand over on that end of the stage.
[time=2742] Thanks, Jess.
[time=2743] Here you go.
[time=2744] And I want you to stand right like that and stand right here behind here.
[time=2749] And then I just want you guys to take this town.
[time=2751] Thanks, Kevin.
[time=2753] There you go, Karen.
[time=2755] Kevin, you go to the end down there.
[time=2757] Karen, you stand right here.
[time=2758] All right.
[time=2760] So here we go.
[time=2762] Not leaving.
[time=2764] I mean, they're going to leave, but they're going to leave ready to serve.
[time=2768] See, Kevin's going to go and he's going to check out and do whatever he can with the technical arena.
[time=2773] And then, you know, Karen might just have a heart for kids and she might want to help change diapers.
[time=2779] She might want to help lead a third grade class.
[time=2781] She could have a heart for helping with students.
[time=2784] Jessie might have the gift of hospitality, which I think you do, by the way.
[time=2790] She may want to help with food service.
[time=2791] She may want to help with coming alongside the handicap and the special ed special needs.
[time=2797] I mean, there's all kinds of things.
[time=2799] Curtis might want to use this teaching gift, and which I think you may have as well.
[time=2805] Curtis may want to help with the Bible study.
[time=2807] Curtis may want to lead a class.
[time=2808] I mean, there's all kinds of opportunities, but you can't just walk out the door.
[time=2815] You've got to get your towel because that's part of the deal in the body of Christ.
[time=2822] Amen?
[time=2823] Equipping, uniquely, clearly taught to uniquely serve.
[time=2828] You've got to serve.
[time=2831] And we've got to uniquely, clearly teach.
[time=2834] So we'll keep doing our best.
[time=2836] You need to do your best.
[time=2837] Give these guys a hand.
[time=2838] I'll take the towels.
[time=2839] Yep, you bet.
[time=2842] All right, Corbin, come on up.
[time=2844] Come on up.
[time=2845] Lastly, lastly, write this down.
[time=2849] Excellent stewardship.
[time=2851] We couldn't find a creative word that started with E.
[time=2853] So we just said, excellent stewardship.
[time=2856] Please write this down.
[time=2857] Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
[time=2865] Giving T three.
[time=2866] Here's what we want you to catch.
[time=2868] T three.
[time=2869] Scriptures encourages us to invest in heavenly treasure by sacrificially giving back to Him.
[time=2878] Our time.
[time=2879] Right there.
[time=2886] Our time.
[time=2887] Our talent.
[time=2890] Corbin's sitting there at the piano.
[time=2892] It's got talent.
[time=2895] His talent happens to be playing the piano.
[time=2898] Singing into that mic.
[time=2899] Your talent happens to be what?
[time=2901] Give it.
[time=2903] A lot of it.
[time=2905] Sacrificially, you and I giving our time, our talent, and our treasure.
[time=2910] That's right.
[time=2911] And I'm so thankful that this family continues to do that.
[time=2915] Will you please continue to do that?
[time=2917] Give sacrificially of your time, your talent, and your treasure.
[time=2923] That's what fully surrendered.
[time=2925] That's what Christ followers do.
[time=2928] Exaltation, evangelism, encouragement, equipping, excellent stewardship.
[time=2936] Would you write those five things down?
[time=2938] You know what?
[time=2939] You can go to the website today, and you can click on Black Hawk's mission, and you can just print that page out, and you could this week individually.
[time=2948] You could this week as a couple or a family.
[time=2950] You could this week in your small group.
[time=2953] You could say, hey, what do we need to work on?
[time=2956] What do we need to grow in?
[time=2958] There might be one of those five or two or three of those five where you feel like God's really been growing you.
[time=2963] You made this morning look at one of these five and go, wow, I need your help, God.
[time=2967] So would you do that?
[time=2970] Would you this week with a close friend or as a family or as a small group?
[time=2976] Would you give yourself to one of those ease, growing in it, reading about it, studying those passages, praying for each other?
[time=2985] It's not just a list of five words that start with E, people.
[time=2991] It's biblical truth that was given to shape and form your life and mine.
[time=2995] And when you give yourself to that, and I give myself to that, he is glorified, and others are invited into the process of finding him and then knowing what it means to follow.
[time=3006] Would you now just respond to him?
[time=3011] It's Corbin and the team leads us in worship.
[time=3013] Would you just lift your voices in praise and thanksgiving that he has given us this kind of opportunity, that kind of road to walk, praise God, and let's worship him together now.
