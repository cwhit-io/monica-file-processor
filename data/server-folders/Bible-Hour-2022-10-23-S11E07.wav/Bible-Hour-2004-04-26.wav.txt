[time=381] - Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Blackhawk Ministries.
[time=385] And it is great to be with you again. We're thankful that you've tuned in.
[time=389] I've got to tell you, I've got a friend of mine. And he is a huge Ohio State Buckeye fan. I mean, the guy is absolutely fanatically given to the whole Ohio State, red and white, or crimson and cream, or white, whatever they are. He's just huge Ohio State guy, right? And he said to me recently, we've known each other for a while now, he said to me recently that for years and years and years, he thought Archie Griffith, the athletic director at Ohio State, he thought Archie Griffith had the best job in the world.
[time=421] And then he started hanging around me, he said.
[time=425] And when he started hanging around me, and he saw the people that I got to work with, when he saw the kind of things that I got to be involved in, day in and day out, when he saw what God was doing at Blackhawk, when he realized what my days and sometimes nights were taken up with, when he got a good glimpse at this world that I get to live in, and the people I get to work with, and the things that we get to give ourselves to. He said, you know what, I changed my mind. You, he said, Kelly Bird, you have the greatest job in the world. And you know what, he's right. I really do. I want you to know how grateful I am for this job. I can't believe they call it a job. I can't believe what I get to do with my life. And I tell you what, even more than that, I am so very thankful for the team of people that I get to do it with.
[time=473] I mean, that's what really thrills my soul.
[time=477] Pastoral staff of guys here. I mean, I'm just one of many.
[time=481] And there is a team of guys here that God has assembled, and they are an amazing group of guys, and they are deeply devoted, fully surrendered to him. They are, are every day and night giving their gifts and their talents and their hearts to the people of this church. They are an amazing group, and my relationship with them, and the opportunity that I get to spend my life with them is an absolute privilege. And I just wanted to ask you this.
[time=509] Would you pray for us this week as God continues to bring more and more people to Black Hawk, and as our opportunities and our responsibilities before him increase, there's sometimes where I just feel like I need to have as many people praying for us as I could possibly get. So I'm asking you, would you pray for our team this week? Would you pray for us if you know us individually? Pray for us by name. If you don't know us individually, would you just pray for the pastoral staff at Black Hawk Ministries this week that God would give us strength, that God would give us wisdom, that He would protect us from the schemes of the enemy, that He would give us with our families and our friends, the kind of growing relationships that we need. Would you just lift us up before the father?
[time=557] I would really, really appreciate it, and I know they would do well. Thank you for doing that. I also want to just remind you that today, May 9th, Mother's Day, by the way, Happy Mother's Day to those of you moms who are tuning in. Beginning today, we will start a seven to ten week series entitled For Better, For Worse, God's Design for Marriage and Family. And I just want to tell you, we believe deep in our, deep in our hearts that He's going to do something really special in these next seven to ten weeks. I don't know how you're doing today in your marriage. Not sure what kind of a husband you are. Not sure what kind of a wife you are. I wonder what kind of parenting challenges you're facing. I wonder what kind of parenting fears you live with.
[time=605] Many of you are just starting out on the parenting walk.
[time=609] Others of you have been at it for a while, but you know, no matter where you are on the marriage or family spectrum, God's Word gives us clear direction. God's Word is what gives us a foundation.
[time=621] God's Word is what gives us the opportunity to be the husbands and to be the wives and to be the parents that He's called us to be.
[time=629] And I know I, for one, I need help. It is a constant and growing challenge in my own life. And so I can't wait for these next several weeks and want to invite you personally to come and think it through and check it out. See what God might have for you in the days and weeks to come. I hope to get to meet you. I hope you'll come and see us. And I can't wait to see what He teaches us as it relates to marriage and family. God bless you.
[time=657] Hope to see you soon.
[time=675] You are.
[time=691] Lord, I come to you in broken country.

[time=1785] (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) If I have one hope this morning is that we're able to reconcile this idea of who I am designed to be with a definition of missions because we're going to talk about that in a second, a very unclear thing sometimes with where we're going as a family as it relates to missions in the world and where we're going to go from here.
[time=1827] The missions I have found in visiting churches and some of the church consulting that I've done is probably the least understood ministry of a church. If you gather people together and say what do, what's the youth ministry about here? Or what is children's ministry or the preaching ministry? You go into any aspect of that. You all probably can get pretty close to the goal, the purpose, the idea of that.
[time=1851] So missions is so easily kind of shoved in a corner or compartmentalized. It's easy to say, you know what? That's for those people who can't live in America. I mean they're just so spiritual and they're just out there and they just have to go somewhere to live in a hut just to get away from everything.
[time=1867] Or you can say, well missions, I know what that is, that is feeding the poor here in Fort Wayne, or it is campus ministry, or it is unreached people groups.
[time=1875] We tend to mission people, of which I'll put myself in that category, tend to be pretty zealous people. They put a box around it and they say, this is what it is, period. Let's not debate this too much further if you don't mind.
[time=1887] Really, it's not an either or, but it is a both and as we look at this. If we look at Mark 12, verses 28 through 31, and we start at this, who am I designed to be? Starting at verse 28, one of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating,
[time=1904] noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer. He asked him, of all the commandments, which is the most important? The most important one answered Jesus is this,
[time=1912] hero Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one, love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind and with all your strength.
[time=1920] The second is this, love your neighbor as yourself. There is no commandment greater than these. Those two commandments, love God, love your neighbor, love those who don't know him.
[time=1931] I would suggest cannot be really ripped apart. They can't be pulled apart. God desires worship. God desires a relationship with him, not because he's some sort of egotist,
[time=1943] not because he enjoys seeing us bow down to him. He does it because he realizes that as we grow closer to him, we become more fulfilled.
[time=1951] We understand him better. We understand what our lives are going to be to do as we go from this point.
[time=1957] A few years ago, I was in Pasadena, California at the U.S. Center for World Missions and arrived in LA, drove up to Pasadena, went to classes, went back to the hotel, went back to the center the next day, classes there all day,
[time=1971] and came out of the classroom about four o'clock in the afternoon, and somebody, while I had been in that class, had dropped a mountain about 200 yards from the center,
[time=1981] which I hadn't seen the previous two days. The smoke and the fog and all the pollution and all that had been there. For two days, I've been walking around this campus and didn't realize we were in a mountain. I mean, I'm not claiming.
[time=1991] I can tell you where Uzbekistan is, but I can't tell you that there should be mountains in California, I guess. But 200 yards from this classroom stood this mountain.
[time=1999] And to me, that is what worship does. It clears the fog away. It clears the smog away. And we can see as God is sitting there more clearly.
[time=2008] John Piper in his book, Let the Nations Be Glad, brings worship and missions together in this way.
[time=2014] He says, "Missions is not the ultimate goal of the church. Worship is. Missions exist because worship doesn't. Worship is ultimate, not missions because God is ultimate, not man.
[time=2026] When this age is over and the countless millions of the redeemed fall on their faces before the throne of God, missions will be no more.
[time=2033] It is a temporary necessity. But worship abides forever. Worship, therefore, is the fuel and goal in missions.
[time=2040] It is the goal of the missions because in missions we simply aim to bring the nations into the white-hot enjoyment of God's glory.
[time=2048] What is missions? It starts with our worship of Him.
[time=2053] So the idea there is, I think, it comes from God. He creates us in His image is that we become like that whom we worship.
[time=2064] So if I worship Jesus Christ with all of my heart and I love Him with all of my heart, then I'm going to reflect Him and be a living stone.
[time=2072] Wherever I go, reflecting the living stone, capital S, Jesus Christ. So who am I designed to be? A living stone.
[time=2080] The image of God fully surrendered in Christ. And Peter showed us that with his life when Jesus said, "You know what? I'm changing your name."
[time=2088] We're going to be called Rocky now.
[time=2091] Well, who am I designed to be? Determines what I'm designed to do. Look in verse 5.
[time=2099] You also like living stones. This is who you are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood.
[time=2107] And here's what priests do. So we're a living stone, we're a priesthood of all believers.
[time=2111] Every single person who's ever fully surrendered his or her life to Christ is a priest for Christ.
[time=2117] And here's what you do, and I'll explain that. You offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
[time=2124] So just as the stone is a living stone, that's what it is, that's who it is, who we are, is thrown into the kingdom waters.
[time=2133] That's what we do. We enter the kingdom waters. Write that down. We enter the kingdom waters, and we do one thing.
[time=2143] We connect, and we connect two things. This is what a priest did. We connect with God, and we connect him with others.
[time=2152] That's the duty, that's what a priest does. He's the connection to God, and the connection to man.
[time=2161] And so by entering the kingdom waters, just like that stone, when it connects with that water, I'm connecting with God.
[time=2169] I'm connecting with others, because it's who I am. That's what I do.
[time=2174] And see a priest, this idea of spiritual sacrifices, what Peter's saying is that the people he's writing to have Jewish backgrounds,
[time=2180] and they know that what a priest did is he's, it was a bloody business, it was almost like a butcher.
[time=2185] We sacrifice animals, and do all day long they would do that, and why are they sacrificing animals for what purpose?
[time=2192] For sin. For sin.
[time=2197] And Peter's saying, you know what? Because of Jesus Christ, and dying on a cross, and his shed blood, and he proved to what he said he was
[time=2204] by resurrecting from the dead, and provided his spirit to live through us, we connect with him.
[time=2210] When we enter these kingdom waters, when we know who we are, and we know that we're designed to enter the kingdom waters, that's what we do,
[time=2217] we connect with God through the May you read the Bible, the prayer, and we connect them with others through serving them.
[time=2225] Write that down, serving them. That's how we connect them with others through serving them.
[time=2230] And so if you're a mom, you know what? And you're in Christ, you're fully stranded in them, it's who you are, you're a living stone.
[time=2239] You enter those kingdom waters when you connect God to your children.
[time=2244] You're a dad, you're a living stone, and you enter the kingdom waters, and you're fully stranded in Christ.
[time=2253] You connect God with others when you rear your children in his Word.
[time=2261] You're a business person, and you own a business, and you're a living stone, you're fully stranded in Christ, and you enter the kingdom waters.
[time=2268] When you do a good deal for somebody, with your peers, with your vendors, with your superiors, whatever it is, you are connecting people with God.
[time=2283] That's what you're designed to do.
[time=2285] If you're a student, you go to school, and you're a living stone, and you enter those kingdom waters, you, and you go to school,
[time=2297] you connect your peers, you connect your teachers, you can't, whoever it is, with God, spiritual sacrifice, the priesthood of all believers.
[time=2306] You're a pastor, you enter the kingdom waters, because you're who you are, you're a living stone, you enter the kingdom waters, it's what you do.
[time=2315] You connect him with others by serving them, it's the way it is.
[time=2322] In Matthew 28, if you want to turn there, it's going to come on the screen.
[time=2325] In Matthew 28, verses 16 through 20, we see Peter, he's there among the disciples.
[time=2331] And it says, "Then the eleven disciples, minus Judas, went to Galilee to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
[time=2339] When they saw him, they worshiped him." See that?
[time=2342] There it is, Corbin.
[time=2343] There it is, Brent.
[time=2344] But some doubt it, then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
[time=2352] I am the living stone, capital S. Therefore go." And there's a strong argument that in Greek it says, "As you are going, make disciples of all nations, all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit."
[time=2369] Let's make man in our image. There it is again.
[time=2372] And teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you, and surely I am with you always to the very end of the age.
[time=2380] And that is what Peter did with his life.
[time=2383] You can read Acts 1 through 12, you want to look through it sometime this week.
[time=2386] It shows Peter's life of doing this, of entering the kingdom waters and connecting people with God.
[time=2392] Because he was a living stone, he was fully surrendered to Jesus Christ.
[time=2396] And he writes this in 1 Peter 3.15, the same letter he says, "But in your heart set apart Christ as Lord, that's who you are.
[time=2404] Love God with all your heart.
[time=2406] And always be prepared. They're inextricably linked.
[time=2409] Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asked you to give the reason for the hope that you have.
[time=2414] But do this with gentleness and respect.
[time=2417] Peter was a living stone, found his identity in Christ.
[time=2421] Peter was designed to enter the kingdom waters and connect with God and connect him with others.
[time=2429] Who am I designed to be a worshipper?
[time=2433] What am I designed to do?
[time=2435] This verse that we just looked at in Matthew 28 is called the Great Commission.
[time=2441] It is the keystone to mission programs around this world.
[time=2446] And at the same time as much as I love this charge, I'm not a big fan of how this has become sort of the only verse when we look at missions.
[time=2455] It is easy to make it look like missions is an afterthought to Jesus.
[time=2461] He goes through his ministry years, he dies, is resurrected, comes to this point, and then sort of slaps his hand on his forehead and goes, "I forgot something."
[time=2471] You've got to go out there and start talking to people.
[time=2476] It's almost this last minute sort of dump of information that comes across when a lot of people talk about missions.
[time=2484] When in actuality, this whole book is about missions.
[time=2487] If you go back to Genesis 12, verse 3, it's the first time we see something called the Abrahamic Covenant.
[time=2495] And as we look at what I'm designed to do, what I want to share just in a couple minutes here is why we're designed to do it and how we're designed to do it.
[time=2503] Genesis 12, 3 says, "I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse, and all the peoples on earth will be blessed through you."
[time=2512] This idea of we are a blessed people, not because we're like the best or because he just wants to do it, but that there is a reason behind that blessing is called the Abrahamic Covenant.
[time=2524] It has two segments to it, "I will bless you, you will bless others." We are blessed to be a blessing.
[time=2532] Be do go.
[time=2534] Four thousand years ago, when God put this plan together, actually as you go through the Bible, as you go through the Scripture, you'll see the nation of Israel, you'll see individuals, you'll see others who know this.
[time=2549] They know that this is a principle and a truth that they are to follow, and yet it is very difficult to do. It's difficult for us to do.
[time=2557] This culture that we live in, it's almost impossible to take a blessing solely at the value that is given to us for the sole purpose we believe to become a blessing to others.
[time=2567] And I'll give you a good example. There's a lot of churches that I've been to that the service may end Psalm 67 verse 1 is read.
[time=2576] May God be gracious to us and bless us and make his face to shine upon us. Amen, you can go.
[time=2582] That kind of a closing to a service. When really, if you read 67 one through three, and this happens all the way through Scripture, may God be gracious to us and bless us, may he make his face to shine upon us.
[time=2593] That your ways may be known on the earth, your salvation among the nations, may the people's praise you, O God, may all the people's praise you.
[time=2600] It was God's plan from the beginning and it was yet so simple and yet it's so difficult to live. It's difficult as we receive our time, treasure and talents from God to then take those and give them back as a blessing to connect, to act as a priest between God and our neighbors, our friends, those who are around us.
[time=2620] Livingstone is who I am. I'm designed to enter the kingdom waters and connect God with others just as Brent mentioned. And, you know, I was getting ready to preach this passage, the Matthew 28 16 to 20, the Great Commission passage at my church at county line.
[time=2639] And I came across this scholar who said, yeah, that's the Great Commission. You read Acts and they did it. It's done. They reached all the nations.
[time=2647] I found the guy wasn't alone in thinking that. So once my uncle who mentored me and there's other believers that might have had a little bit of that kind of background in their studies and they're listening this conversation, I said, hey, I want to know.
[time=2660] I'm going to stand up in front of a church Sunday and say, I changed my life for this and I'm not going to do that if I can't tell them that the Bible says that they're supposed to do the same.
[time=2673] And the guy is listening to say, yeah, this kind of acts as it was done.
[time=2678] My uncle, no one that they're listening and wanting to communicate effectively with me and being part of that church said, kind of winks at me and he smiles and he says, you know, Mitchell, I think you've got to be careful with who you give this challenge to us.
[time=2692] I said, what do you mean? He said, you know, smiles again. He said, think about who Jesus said that to whom he said it. Who were they?
[time=2704] He said, these were people who left everything, sacrificed everything to follow Jesus Christ. They would go anywhere and leave anything for him.
[time=2718] That's who that great commission's for.
[time=2722] I want to tell you today, there are no exemptions. If who you are is a living stone, then what you do is connect people to God end of story.
[time=2733] And if you don't connect people to God everywhere you go, don't call yourself a living stone because that, my friends, is for you and it's for me.
[time=2744] Who we are, a living stone, what we do that determines what we do. We get tossed into the waters and we connect with the waters just like we connect with the waters.
[time=2755] We connect with God and we connect them with others. And that determines where we go.
[time=2760] And the answer to that right at end, where is my design to go? Wherever he places me, write that down. Where am I designed to go? Wherever he places me.
[time=2772] And if you want to turn to Acts 1-8, it's going to come on the screens.
[time=2780] Jesus has died, he's resurrected, he's appeared 10 or 11 times depending how you count it. This is the 10th or 11th.
[time=2787] And he says this, he's getting ready to ascend to heaven and he says to those guys, he says, "But you, you living stones, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you.
[time=2795] That's who you are. And you will be my witnesses. That's what you'll do, martyr for witness. It's people who gave their lives, who sacrificed everything to connect people to God."
[time=2806] In Jerusalem, this is a ripple effect. In Jerusalem, in Judea, in Samaria, and how does he say it?
[time=2819] To the ends of the earth. To the ends of the earth. To saying in that culture that means Rome.
[time=2826] It's that interesting. And what that phrase becomes is the outline for Acts.
[time=2834] And you go through Acts and it shows the disciples, those who were living stones, connecting people with God, spiritual acts of worship, of sacrifice, like a priest in Jerusalem first.
[time=2847] Then Acts takes you in Judea. And then Acts takes you in Samaria. And then Acts ends with Paul and Rome.
[time=2854] So they did it. But it's not done. And so you and I have to ask, what's my ripple effect going to be?
[time=2863] Where has he placed me? What's my ripple effect include? Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, to the ends of the earth.
[time=2872] And you know what? Peter went. We see in Acts 1 through 12. Peter went wherever God sent him.
[time=2880] And he writes this letter about 64 AD. And Nero, the emperor of Rome, is starting to torch Christians at parties.
[time=2888] And he even created a fire and framed Christians for setting it. And said they did that and used it to build sentiment against Christians.
[time=2896] And in the midst of all this, Peter is saying, you know what? Just continue to be the living stone.
[time=2901] Continue to connect people to Jesus Christ. And go wherever you go. Do it. Wherever he places you.
[time=2912] And it's interesting. The disciple who tried to be worthy of Christ's whole life.
[time=2919] He always had these sayings when Jesus would say something. He wanted to prove that he was worthy.
[time=2925] He went to the cross and feeling unworthy. Unworthy of his Savior was crucified on the cross.
[time=2934] Tradition tells us that Peter said, hang me upside down. Because I'm not worthy of Jesus Christ.
[time=2941] He's the living stone, the capital S. I'm just a living stone, little S.
[time=2947] And that's all he's asking us to do is to go wherever he leads us, the ripple effect.
[time=2952] It's based on who we are living stone. What we do connecting with him and connecting him with others.
[time=2957] And where we go, that ripple effect. And Bill Bright says if we all would just do it, we all would just do it.
[time=2963] If we all would just be who we're supposed to be and do what we're supposed to do, then it would go where it's supposed to go.
[time=2970] Because it's only two to the 34th power. Two times two times two.
[time=2974] If I would just tell Brent, Brent would just impact the life of another. And they would just impact the life of another.
[time=2979] It's 34th. It's all a father out. It has to go. And the whole world will know.
[time=2984] Wouldn't it be cool if we were part of that? Wouldn't it be cool if we took Peter and Jesus at their word and said,
[time=2991] "I'll give my life. I'll be a living stone. I'll do whatever he asked me to do. I'll go wherever he asked me to go.
[time=2997] Wouldn't it be cool if we were black?" I could say, "Yeah, we're a part of that." That's what life is about. Don't you think? Am I nuts?
[time=3005] In a good way. I love you.
[time=3010] If I might go in on it, I don't think so.
[time=3014] What do you think?
[time=3017] We support 44 missionaries, and that's important. That's a big deal. I take that very seriously about where we're going.
[time=3028] But I'm probably more concerned about the 2000.
[time=3034] And more concerned maybe sounds a little strong for those who really love the 44. I love the 44, but they're calling it strong.
[time=3045] If there was not a Black Hawk someday, they would still be on the field.
[time=3051] But as we look at who we're designed to be as worshipers and the blessings that we've received to become so that we can be a blessing to others,
[time=3059] so that we can connect to this world, to me that is the critical part of who we are as a family, as a body of believers.
[time=3066] So that's going to be the focus. If I was going to actually put legs on this thing in terms of a very personal standpoint, we're going to create opportunities in the months and years ahead of how we can plug into our Jerusalem, Fort Wayne,
[time=3078] how we can be a more a part of the ministries of this city as we reach out to those who need to know who he is,
[time=3085] as we reach out to our Judea, Indiana, Samaria, the U.S., and to the ends of the earth.
[time=3091] There are those in this room. I spoke at a church not too long ago who said, "You know, our goal is to send 50 missionaries out in the next 10 years."
[time=3099] And they said, "Well, we think that we can get 25 of them just in sort of the age brackets that we're looking at here,
[time=3105] but we're going to have to look at the sixth graders and the fifth graders and the fourth graders as we kind of stretch this thing out to how we're going to get to our 50." And I think that as we look at our children, our teens, our adults,
[time=3117] as we look at the opportunities that we're going to give, I'm excited about where we're going to go in the future.
[time=3123] So who we are to be, what that makes us into, and then where we're to go, is absolutely where we're taking this.
[time=3133] One of my favorite verses is Acts 13, 36. I want to end with this because, at least on my part, because this is really a prayer for me.
[time=3142] For when David had served God's purpose in his own generation, he fell asleep.
[time=3146] I'll stop reading because my kids point out that it talks about body decay and other things after that.
[time=3151] But this idea of this call in our life, this idea that we were planted here, we served God's purpose, and then we fell asleep.
[time=3159] What more can you ask for? How can you do more than that as a believer?
[time=3164] So I'm excited about the future, not to take this to too much of a pure ministry standpoint, but I'm hoping in the months and years ahead that you'll see.
[time=3173] Someday we're going to be known as a missions church, and what that means is exactly what we've talked about here today.
[time=3180] Jerusalem, it's neighbor link, it's our surface Saturdays, it's the friendship class, it's all the things that happen here and in this community, and you can sign up for that.
[time=3190] And Judea, things we do in Indiana and Samaria, the things we do in the United States, the student ministry's team, they're going to New York, and then the remotest parts of the earth, the ends of the earth, they're even going to the Dominican Republic, all kinds of things for you to become part of.
[time=3209] And be do go, it's aligned with our missionaries, proper those 44 who are sent out, but the big question is what about you?
[time=3217] You've got to ask yourself, what's my ripple effect and I want to end with a story about Bob?
[time=3224] John Orberg a pastor shares this story in his book, I believe if you want to hit water you've got to get out of the boat.
[time=3231] And he tells a story about Bob who I think was a new believer seeking, but I'm pretty sure he was a new believer, and Bob goes to a leader of a parachurch ministry.
[time=3240] And I think it was in Washington DC and he said, "Hey is it true in this new thing I'm a part of that if you pray, it happens."
[time=3248] And the guy said, didn't want to discourage them, he said, "Well yeah, it's in the heart of Christ is how that works." And he said, "Okay, I want to pray for someplace." And the guy says, "What do you want to pray for, Bob?" And Bob says, "Africa." The guy says, "Well Africa is a big place, let's narrow it down to country."
[time=3263] He goes, "Alright, Kenya, have you ever been to Kenya?" No.
[time=3267] Related to anybody in Kenya? No. Do you know anybody in Kenya, Bob? No.
[time=3272] Alright, Bob I know you and I want you to pray for Kenya for six months, and Bob I know you well.
[time=3278] So as an incentive for you to do it every day for six months, I'm going to pay you $500.
[time=3283] Alright, so Bob starts praying. A few months into this deal Bob's not thinking about it, but he is praying every day.
[time=3290] And he's at a dinner party and a dinner party's work when he's sitting at a table and they're asking everybody, "What do they do? Who are you? What do you do? Where do you go?"
[time=3296] A lady says, "I'm from Kenya." Bob goes, "What? I'm from Kenya. Really?" Bob asked her all these questions about Kenya. She says, "Bob, have you ever been to Kenya?" No.
[time=3305] Bob, you're related to somebody in Kenya? No. Bob, you know anybody in Kenya? No.
[time=3309] Bob, why don't you come over? I get pharmaceutical supplies and medical supplies to people who otherwise wouldn't have it. Bob goes.
[time=3317] Why Bob's there? He sees this big need and it's not being met and he comes back and he writes a letter to pharmaceutical companies and he says,
[time=3324] "Hey, I know you got extra stuff. Why don't you send it to Kenya, this place? They need it. Bad."
[time=3330] Bob gets a phone call and he says, "Hello? Is this Bob? Yeah." Bob, guess what?
[time=3337] When you went back, did you write a letter or something? He goes, "Yeah?" She said, "We got a million dollars worth of medical supplies." Bob,
[time=3344] and we're going to have a big party in your honor. You want to come over? It's okay. Bob goes back to Kenya.
[time=3351] They're having a party in his honor. Guess who comes to President of Kenya? This is true. President of Kenya is there.
[time=3357] And says, "Hey, Bob, want to come to the Presidential Palace?" Sure.
[time=3362] Bob goes through the Presidential Palace and he's showing them around. President's showing them around. Bob goes, "Hey, that looks a little funny. What are those guys?" Those are political prisoners.
[time=3371] "Ah, you ought to let him go, man." They walk through him. Bob goes home. Bob's phone rings.
[time=3377] When he gets home, picks up the phone and says, "Is this Bob? Yes. This is United States State Department, Bob.
[time=3384] Were you recently in Kenya? Yes. Were you in the Presidential Palace? Yes. Did you speak to the President? Yes.
[time=3391] Did you see political prisoners? Yes. Did you tell the President anything about those political prisoners?"
[time=3398] "Yeah, he told me I let him go." Bob, we've been working on that for several years and what you've done in a few minutes,
[time=3404] we just want to thank you on behalf of your country.
[time=3408] True story, a couple days later. Phone rings. Oh, is this Bob? Yeah.
[time=3416] This is President of Kenya. I'm redirecting my whole cabinet. I want you to come over and pray with me and help me decide who to pick. All because, be do-go. Bob said I'm going to be a living stone.
[time=3433] I'm going to pray. I'm going to connect with God and try to connect God with others.
[time=3436] That's what I'm going to do. Just the way the stone hits those waters.
[time=3441] I'm just going to let him determine where my ripple effect is, where it goes from here.
[time=3446] I want to be cool. If every one of you here would do what I ask you to do now, to take that stone and let it be a reminder to pray every day, God, who have you designed me to be?
[time=3458] What have you designed me to do? I know it's a living stone. I know it's connecting people to you, but you probably got a unique design for me to do that and God, where do you want me to go?
[time=3466] So could you please stand? And I'm going to start that prayer for you.
[time=3470] It might be six hours, and he might tell you. It might be six days, it might be six months.
[time=3476] But he's going to tell you, that's for sure. So let's pray.
[time=3481] And now, God, I'm reminded as Peter says, you know, do this through Jesus Christ.
[time=3489] Wherever you go, I am with you, Jesus said.
[time=3493] And God, now we ask, please, help us to be living stones, help us to do the work of a priest, God,
[time=3505] to enter the kingdom waters, to connect with you and to connect people to you.
[time=3510] And God, may you tell us where you want us to go, place us, God, wherever you want us to go.
[time=3515] Let us know what our ripple effect is and what it's going to be.
[time=3518] Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, remotest parts of the earth, our homes, our cars,
[time=3527] Fort Wayne, Indiana, the United States, all over the world.
[time=3531] May it be so in this place, God. We love you and we praise you.
[time=3534] And all God's people agreed and said, amen.
