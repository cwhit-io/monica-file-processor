[time=60] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Blackhawk and it is great to be with you again.
[time=85] This morning's broadcast is going to be the first installment in what will most likely be a seven to ten week series that we've entitled for better, for worse, God's design
[time=96] for marriage and family.
[time=98] And week one, what you're about to see is a discussion we had a study that we did this last week on really life before marriage and how that plays into life after marriage.
[time=112] Let me say it to you like this.
[time=113] A couple of weeks ago, I was driving in the car with my oldest son, 12 years old.
[time=118] And I know that hundreds of you, a lot of you out there have had these conversations and then some, but you got to bear with me because for me, I'm just starting to have some of these.
[time=129] Well, he asked me, he said, "Hey dad, so when am I going to start dating?" And it just absolutely filled my mind with all kinds of discussions and answers and,
[time=141] oh my goodness, and here we go into not only this discussion, but some years of life here
[time=148] that we'll be filled with, not only discussions with his dad, but decisions and choices that
[time=154] he's going to make on his own.
[time=157] And so it really got me thinking about, and we, in what you're about to see, we really have given some time and thought to what does God's words say about the relationship between
[time=168] a man and a woman prior to marriage?
[time=172] What is God's design?
[time=174] Not just his design for marriage and family, what's God's design morally, let's say?
[time=180] What is God's moral and relational design for us as we approach the marriage relationship?
[time=186] What are the things that we should practice?
[time=190] And what are some things we shouldn't?
[time=193] And I hope as you watch this today, maybe you're a young person, maybe you've got friends, maybe you're a parent and you've got some kids coming up, I mean, wherever you are on the age continuum, I hope as you watch this today, that you'll open your heart and your mind to what God would have for you.
[time=208] I believe God's words really clear.
[time=210] I believe God's design for relationship prior to marriage is one word, and that word is purity.
[time=216] And so I'd like to just encourage you to think that through, and more than you thinking it through, would you open your heart and mind to the truth of the Scriptures and see what, in fact, God has for us as He kind of lays this plan out for the road that we're
[time=231] to walk as we approach this thing called marriage.
[time=235] Hey, I also want to invite you to check out our website.
[time=238] I am so unbelievably thankful for the work our people do on our BlackhawkMinistries.org
[time=244] website.
[time=245] You just need to, on a regular basis, visit the site.
[time=248] There are so many things going on around this place, and in these ministries, you'll just want to keep up with it.
[time=254] One of the things I'd love to draw your attention to, if you go to the home page, you'll see at the bottom there on the left, the link, picture of a red car, and it says, "Blackhawk Ministries Car Show." It's our second annual car show, June 6th, right here on campus following the services
[time=270] that morning.
[time=271] We'll be filling the parking lot with classic cars and hot rods and muscle cars and all
[time=277] kinds of stuff.
[time=278] Mitch, Mitch is going to be pretty proud of the whole muscle car thing there, hot rod, lingo.
[time=284] Sometimes it goes on the whole car thing, but anyway, you'll love it.
[time=288] Lots of food, a lot of people, and a lot of cars.
[time=292] You can bring your car and enter it, or you can just come and enjoy the cars and the food and the fellowship.
[time=298] We'll look forward to meeting you.
[time=299] Make sure you click on the car show link and find out more about it, and we hope to see you soon.
[time=305] God bless.

[time=562] (audience applauds) (gentle piano music)
[time=592] (gentle piano music) - Well, this is where it officially begins.
[time=608] Right here in a room like this, and oftentimes in my own experience, right here in this room, is where it officially begins, usually on a Saturday afternoon, sometimes on a Saturday evening, every once in a while on a Friday, but this is the place, and the flowers are usually arranged, the candles have been lit, friends and family are in their places, and it is time for a wedding.
[time=636] And a wedding, you know, it is an amazing thing.
[time=641] So much excitement and hype.
[time=643] He and his buddies usually come from back there at that door, they come down.
[time=648] Sometimes pale-faced, sometimes snickering and laughing, always with sweaty palms, and they're not quite sure what's gonna happen, but they're ready.
[time=656] I hook up with them, and we will kind of looking dapper, aren't we?
[time=661] We will walk over here to the side center aisle, because it is at the center aisle where all the activity and excitement really begins.
[time=669] That familiar music is played, and the gals come down the aisle.
[time=676] Hair all done up, flowers nice and pretty, sparkles in their hair.
[time=684] And you know what's amazing?
[time=684] The friends always come down the aisle, they're laughing or they're crying, or sometimes they're cracking jokes.
[time=690] You know, these folks typically have been through a lot together.
[time=694] And so they come down the aisle, they take their places, and pose for pictures, and the guys are all in place.
[time=706] All right guys, ladies are all in place, and then the big moment arrives.
[time=712] The doors open, the music begins, and here comes the bride.
[time=716] The mom usually stands, others follow.
[time=720] You're welcome to stand this morning, you've been at weddings before.
[time=723] And here they come.
[time=725] Here comes dad and the bride.
[time=727] And my goodness, you know, the thoughts that he's thinking, the feelings that he has, sometimes it's pride and excitement, but times I'm sure it's worry, but nonetheless they come down the aisle, dad and the bride.
[time=740] And you know what I got to admit?
[time=741] This is a time, this moment right here, where actually you can be seated, thanks.
[time=747] I've got to admit to you that this is a moment that's always met with a variety of different feelings.
[time=753] There are times when his look and her look, right there when that music was playing, there's times that absolutely melts me, really does.
[time=764] There's times when the look in their eyes just absolutely screams, wow, we made it.
[time=770] And more so than we made it, isn't God good?
[time=774] Their eyes say, isn't God good?
[time=778] Look what God has done.
[time=780] Look where he has brought us.
[time=782] There's times when that's what the body language and the eyes say, and you know what?
[time=787] There are times when that's not what the eyes and the body language say.
[time=793] There are times when the eyes and the body language say, well, here goes.
[time=802] I know we're probably not ready, but we'll give it a shot here.
[time=809] I suppose we'll be okay.
[time=812] Well, a song or two gets sung.
[time=815] A message is given.
[time=818] Biblical principles are revisited.
[time=820] And vows of commitment, why don't you two face there?
[time=823] I'll take the, actually I'll throw those to you.
[time=825] Vows of commitment are given.
[time=828] Vows of fidelity, vows of devotion are made before God and those gathered, this man and this woman, they commit to love each other, to love God and to follow him.
[time=839] While they're pronounced and introduced as husband and wife, I'll take that back.
[time=844] There you go, you guys can turn and face.
[time=846] They get publicly introduced for the very first time and off they go.
[time=851] They head out the aisle.
[time=853] Mothers and fathers cry happily.
[time=855] And their friends follow behind.
[time=860] Maybe it's a congratulatory handshake.
[time=863] Maybe it's a high five.
[time=865] Maybe it's a good friend from college still wiping tears.
[time=869] And off the friends go and the couple, they pause.
[time=873] That's right, for that one shot, the photographer catches boom right there of the happy couple.
[time=879] The happy couple, right?
[time=885] Full of joy and anticipation.
[time=889] Full of excitement to go out through those doors and to face this whole new world together.
[time=897] And it really is, I mean by and large and it really should be fundamentally, right?
[time=901] A joyous occasion.
[time=904] And it really should be fundamentally, a joyous future.
[time=909] But I got a question for you today.
[time=912] Why so many times does all of this,
[time=919] why so many times does all of this, why so many times do we go from that and all of the joy and excitement of this, let me see those.
[time=931] And this is not meant to be funny, in the slightest.
[time=935] I think most of you who are married in the room will understand why, why do we go to this?
[time=944] What happens?
[time=948] That takes so many people from this place of joyous anticipation to real, real heartache.
[time=961] Well, I am so thankful, I'm not thankful for what happens, I'm just so thankful that, and you know what, nobody's immune to this, nobody.
[time=971] And I'm so thankful that God has given us His word.
[time=974] I'm so thankful that God has.
[time=976] You see the signs for better, for worse, but the best part of our series title is God's design for marriage and family.
[time=984] Because there is a way that we can honor Him.
[time=986] There is a way that we can experience a joyous future together.
[time=992] And we're so thankful that you're here.
[time=993] And we invite you today and in the weeks to come, to come and join the discussion as we look to the scriptures at God's design.
[time=1000] Well, as the lights come up, I'll throw these back to you, Luke, as the lights come up.
[time=1005] And you've got your Bibles, I hope.
[time=1008] Why don't you open those Bibles up to Hebrews chapter 13, thanks, young man.
[time=1013] Thank you, Laura.
[time=1016] Hebrews chapter 13, just put your finger in there.
[time=1019] At Hebrews chapter 13, and we will get there in just a moment.
[time=1022] For better, for worse, God's design,
[time=1028] for marriage and family.
[time=1030] So what happens?
[time=1031] How do we go from flowers and smiles to resentment and anger?
[time=1036] How do we go from I do to I wish I hadn't?
[time=1040] And maybe the more important question is this, is there hope?
[time=1044] I mean, really people, is there hope?
[time=1046] And I want to say this to everybody in the room this morning, and I realize we have a number of different audiences here.
[time=1051] I want to say to those of you who aren't married yet, you know what, despite what you see, despite what culture shows you, despite the declining numbers, despite the statistics that get thrown in front of your face and in front of your lives, day after day after day.
[time=1067] Let me just tell you, those of you who aren't married yet, you know what, there is hope.
[time=1071] There is hope.
[time=1073] There's hope, and you know what, it's right here.
[time=1075] It's not Dr. Phil, and it's not Ladies Home Journal.
[time=1078] It's this right here.
[time=1080] Dr. Phil's not a bad guy.
[time=1084] Ladies Home Journal, you know, it's a great magazine with lots of great pictures of flowers and soup recipes, but they're not going to give you and I hope.
[time=1093] It's not going to communicate to you and I the design of the one who put it all together in the first place.
[time=1101] Those of you who aren't married, listen to me, there is hope.
[time=1105] You can marry and you can grow to love and you can stay married and you can stay in that relationship and it can get better and better and better as the years go by.
[time=1115] Those of you who are newly married.
[time=1117] You know what, you may be in the first couple of months, in the first couple of years, you may be already experiencing some of the waves, some of the storms that come.
[time=1127] I want to remind you, those of you newly married, you know what, there's hope.
[time=1131] There is a road you can travel.
[time=1133] There is a place that you can go, where you can become a God-honoring wife-honoring husband, where you can be a God-honoring husband-honoring wife.
[time=1144] And it's right here.
[time=1145] The hope for you, the road to walk, begins right here with God's design.
[time=1149] And those of you veteran couples, veteran couples.
[time=1152] Somebody once said a veteran couple is anybody who's been married and has on either side forgotten a birthday anniversary, slept on the couch more than five times or looks nothing like their high school graduation picture.
[time=1165] All right?
[time=1166] So if you've done any of the above, you're a veteran couple.
[time=1170] Hey veteran couples, guess what?
[time=1172] There's hope.
[time=1174] And we can go from laughter to reality.
[time=1180] I know there's a lot of you in this room and it's not going so well.
[time=1183] I mean, truth be told, it's not going so well.
[time=1189] If real intimacy and real relationship and deep trust and a growing friendship and the joy of living life together is what he designed and he did, there are many in the room today.
[time=1203] And it's not for you today what he designed and I want to remind you that there is hope right here.
[time=1212] And that's why, again, I told you a few weeks ago, I started initially when I thought about the series to feel a great deal of pressure, 'cause what do I know?
[time=1221] And I'm just, I'm trying my best just like many of you to love my wife and to love my kids and to honor God's design and marriage and family, but I have got a lot to learn.
[time=1233] And then I realized it didn't take, you don't need an expert up here, you just need somebody who's going to faithfully try and direct you to what is good, right and true about marriage and family.
[time=1244] And here it is and we will do our very best in the weeks to come to help you understand that picture more clearly.
[time=1251] So there is hope, but just for a few minutes, let's do this, let's consider this morning where the drift from God's design begins.
[time=1261] Can I see hands for those of you in the room, and I mean this, you don't have to raise your hand if you don't really believe this, but if you're here today and you believe that God really has in some form laid out for us a design for marriage and family, let me see you raise your hand.
[time=1279] Okay, great, hands down.
[time=1280] Let me see you raise your hand if you would state today that you are of the opinion that more often than not, many of us in the room drift from that design.
[time=1290] Can I see the hands?
[time=1291] Okay, let's just take a minute.
[time=1293] It isn't always the case, but let's just take a minute and look and see where that drift from God's design begins, which isn't really a look at marriage, but watch this, actually it is a look at life before marriage.
[time=1308] I understand sometimes the drift occurs after.
[time=1313] Oftentimes, the drift from God's design begins to take place before the Saturday afternoon.
[time=1322] Do you understand?
[time=1324] You see, what happens is back here, back when we're just kind of hanging out, back when we're dating, back when we're being together, spending time doing the movies and the friends and the party.
[time=1334] See back here, what happens so many times is that we begin to make decisions, really, really important decisions.
[time=1343] We begin to make decisions physically.
[time=1349] We begin to do things.
[time=1353] We begin to practice a lifestyle prior to the Saturday afternoon at two with the family and the flowers and the friends that the ceremony and your name at the bottom of the paper doesn't change.
[time=1369] Does that make sense?
[time=1372] And it is amazing to me how many really clear-headed, smart, bright people think that it's going to.
[time=1378] I see it all the time.
[time=1379] I see people doing things, practicing things here prior to the altar.
[time=1386] Physically, morally, emotionally, they begin to go down roads.
[time=1391] And those patterns begin to be ingrained.
[time=1395] And that lifestyle begins to be practiced.
[time=1399] And then they get to hear and somehow they think this, this, this, a guy in a hang with a, is going to change it.
[time=1409] And you know what?
[time=1411] It doesn't.
[time=1413] Because who you are here and what you practice here and the roads you go down here.
[time=1419] Now, can you change that?
[time=1421] Yes, but it doesn't get changed Saturday at two.
[time=1424] And so we've got to go.
[time=1428] God, just take a step back for a moment this morning.
[time=1430] And as we consider God's design for marriage, let's take a look at God's design for life prior to marriage.
[time=1437] And let's ask the question, what happens?
[time=1440] Can we do that?
[time=1440] What happens prior to marriage that leads to an unhealthy relationship after marriage?
[time=1447] Three things, we practice lust instead of love.
[time=1452] We practice isolation instead of community.
[time=1456] And we give ourselves to culture following instead of Christ following.
[time=1462] Let's go back to number one.
[time=1464] Get out your pens.
[time=1465] Let's write a few things down.
[time=1466] What do you say?
[time=1467] What happens prior to marriage that leads to an unhealthy relationship after marriage?
[time=1473] Number one, we practice lust instead of love.
[time=1476] You see in the moral, let's move to the moral arena here.
[time=1480] In the moral arena, we sometimes practice a self-gratifying taking, a self-gratifying taking instead of a God honoring, others honoring, waiting.
[time=1493] You with me?
[time=1496] We move away from his moral design of selfless, others centered agape, agape love, sacrificial love,
[time=1506] purity and I will hold you up and I will honor you kind of love.
[time=1510] We move away from that to impurity and selfish self-gratifying I will bring you down lust.
[time=1520] We go from I will hold you up agape, God's design.
[time=1524] So I will bring you down 'cause I will take, I will not honor God or you in wait, I will take and in the process bring you down.
[time=1534] Love versus lust.
[time=1536] Well, let's back up a little bit here.
[time=1539] What is God's design morally prior to marriage?
[time=1543] What is God's design?
[time=1545] How has God mapped that out for us?
[time=1548] What is that to look like?
[time=1550] Our road to the altar, our relationship is men and women as people growing in their love and affection for each other.
[time=1558] What is God's design?
[time=1559] How should I approach marriage morally?
[time=1562] And you know what?
[time=1564] Our discussion today, oh boy, I tell you, 15 years ago, I would say that this discussion would be for those 16 and older, right?
[time=1574] Today, boy, it's just not the case, is it?
[time=1581] There are 11 and 12-year-olds in this room today.
[time=1586] There are 10-year-olds in this room today and in light of what they're seeing, in light of what they're hearing, in light of the images and the pictures and the messages that are getting absolutely thrown in front of their little impressionable hearts and minds today in this culture of ours.
[time=1604] You know what?
[time=1606] You all better listen.
[time=1607] 10-year-olds, 12-year-olds, 14, 15, 16, 18, 25, 34,
[time=1614] everybody better pay attention to see what God's word has to say about his moral design prior to marriage.
[time=1623] We'll start in Hebrews.
[time=1624] Would you go there?
[time=1625] Hebrews, chapter 13, back toward the back of your New Testament.
[time=1630] Make your way back there to Hebrews.
[time=1633] To go to James, you went too far.
[time=1638] Just before the book of James, Hebrews, chapter 13, verse four, here we go.
[time=1644] Marriage, Hebrews 13, four, is to be held in honor among all and the marriage bed is to be undefiled.
[time=1655] For fornicators and adulterers, God will judge.
[time=1660] Marriage is to be held in honor among all
[time=1666] and the marriage bed is to be undefiled.
[time=1670] Now, as you would study that verse and look at that verse in the original language, especially, yes, it would give emphasis to, all right?
[time=1679] It would give emphasis to, and I'm gonna be as kid-friendly as I can today, it would give emphasis that verse would give emphasis to the final act, the ultimate end of the intimacy process.
[time=1694] That's clear.
[time=1695] It was interesting this week for me as I was reading and studying and taking some stuff in.
[time=1700] I found myself listening to an old friend, Chuck Swindall.
[time=1704] Maybe you listened to Chuck Swindall every once in a while.
[time=1706] He has a way of saying things so very practically, and so it helps me immensely.
[time=1711] And he just made the simple point that though he would, in Hebrews 13, four, yes, give credence to the fact that as far as the way the verse breaks down exegetically, it would seem to give emphasis to this final act.
[time=1727] It was interesting for Swindall to note how the marriage bed and its activity typically contains a lot more than just the final act.
[time=1737] Are you with me?
[time=1738] And he did a great job of painting a picture of the marriage bed.
[time=1743] Culturally, what would happen in that day?
[time=1745] What happens in this day, your day in mind?
[time=1748] And he painted a picture of the marriage bed and the physical intimacy and the physical joy and the physical God-given pleasure of all that transpires in that place, at that time, on that night.
[time=1764] Yes, it culminates here with a final act, but that phrase, the marriage bed, when you and I just look at that practically contains so much more than just that one final step.
[time=1778] Go to Ephesians chapter five.
[time=1784] Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, go to Ephesians five.
[time=1790] What is God's moral design for life prior to marriage?
[time=1795] Therefore, be imitators, it says.
[time=1799] Ephesians chapter five, verse one, therefore be imitators of God.
[time=1805] Look at verse three, but immorality or any impurity.
[time=1810] There it is again, immorality, that word in the Greek indicating that final act of physical intimacy or any impurity.
[time=1821] Ephesians five, three, but immorality or any impurity.
[time=1828] You name it, not just the final act.
[time=1832] You name it, any impurity or greed must not even be named among you as is proper among saints and there must be no filthiness and silly talk or course jesting, which are not fitting, but rather giving of thanks.
[time=1846] For this you know with certainty that no immoral or impure person or covetous man who was an idolater has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.
[time=1857] Go back to Hebrews 12, you were just there.
[time=1861] Go back to Hebrews 12.
[time=1862] This verse has always been for me personally in this arena and in others in my life.
[time=1869] A wonderful penetrating, convicting challenge.
[time=1872] Hebrews chapter 12, it says in verse one, therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us and let us run with endurance, the race that is set before us.
[time=1892] You bring that verse into the arena of God's moral design and boy the picture begins to get clearer and clearer.
[time=1899] Not only am I to lay aside the sin, that which is clearly spoken to, but even those things that might lead me to sin.
[time=1909] And this is where you know we get to an arena where you're just gonna have to be whoever you are.
[time=1916] You're just gonna have to be honest with yourself.
[time=1918] There are things in the physical relay, there are things in that moral arena that might not necessarily be biblically mandated
[time=1931] as sin, but I'll tell you what, Hebrews 12 says, if they are things that even lead to sin, lay 'em aside, put 'em away.
[time=1942] That verb in the Greek means to tear off and to burn, to get rid of.
[time=1948] Go to 1 Thessalonians 4.
[time=1953] We were here just a few weeks ago in our study on 1 Thessalonians.
[time=1957] Go to 1 Thessalonians 4, verses three to seven.
[time=1961] What is God's moral design?
[time=1965] For life and relationship prior to marriage, it says here, for this is verse three, for this is the will of God.
[time=1973] You see it there on the screen.
[time=1975] For this is the will of God.
[time=1977] Your sanctification, see, God's will is that you and I would be men and women in relationship together.
[time=1984] If this is the arena we're gonna talk about.
[time=1986] His will is that you would be sanctified, that you would together, both of you, be growing in your relationship with him, growing in your fully surrendered life with him, growing in your character, growing in integrity, growing in your love for him.
[time=2006] All of that is sanctification.
[time=2008] That's God's will.
[time=2011] That you would be as a couple growing in that direction.
[time=2014] Well, what does that look like?
[time=2016] And what does that look like specifically in this arena?
[time=2018] Well, here you go, that is, that you abstain from sexual immorality, and that each of you know how to possess his own body or vessel in sanctification and honor, not in lustful passion like the Gentiles who don't even know God.
[time=2041] This says to you and I this morning that it is his will that in this moral arena, especially prior to marriage, but we could even talk about after marriage as well, but this morning we're talking about this arena.
[time=2052] And in this arena he says, no, no, abstain from it, flee, run from it.
[time=2058] Control, possess your own body, not in lustful passion like those who don't know God.
[time=2067] He uses two very, very descriptive words, folks.
[time=2072] And that no man, verse six, you see that?
[time=2074] And that no man transgresses.
[time=2077] You see that?
[time=2078] And that no man transgresses.
[time=2080] That verb, that word, excuse me, transgress in the Greek, carries with the idea of a line, almost like a property line, okay?
[time=2089] Watch this, people, a line has been drawn.
[time=2093] And it's a good line.
[time=2096] See, it gets so frustrating sometimes as I deal with people, as I wrestle with these things in my own life.
[time=2103] To be honest with you, sometimes these lines that God has drawn, we wanna make 'em out to be bad lines.
[time=2110] And it's not a bad line, it's a good line.
[time=2114] 'Cause he's a good God and he designed this and he really loves you and he wants for you and he wants for me his best.
[time=2123] So there's been a line drawn and God drew it and it says no trespassing.
[time=2130] This is not for you over here yet.
[time=2134] And to transgress in the Greek, it means to step over.
[time=2140] It means to see the sign, it means to read what it says,
[time=2146] it means to hear with your ears that you shouldn't go in
[time=2152] and it means to go over the line.
[time=2156] And then he uses this next phrase that no man would transgress and defraud.
[time=2162] You know what the word defraud means?
[time=2165] In transgressing, we step over the line and defrauding, having stepped over the line and I'll be as careful as I can here.
[time=2173] We begin to take touch, feel, taste.
[time=2176] We begin to take for ourselves that which isn't ours.
[time=2183] We begin to take, see, there's this consistent theme through all of this, we begin to take for our own selfish gratification, for our own thrill, for our own pleasure, when we transgress, we step over a good line that he drew and in stepping over it, we take things that were never ours in the first place to have in that setting.
[time=2207] The last part of verse six gets pretty serious.
[time=2212] Don't transgress and defraud your brother in the matter because the Lord is the avenger in all these things, just as we also told you before and solemnly warned you.
[time=2224] It's a good line.
[time=2228] You need to think about that for a little bit this morning.
[time=2232] Culture wants see, this culture of ours and the enemy has done a really good job of communicating to you and I
[time=2241] that whatever we want, whatever is going to make us happy, whatever is going to make us feel good, we should have, and here's the real kicker and we should have it win, say it.
[time=2252] Now, you know what, it's what's on the other side of this line is really, really good.
[time=2261] God designed it to be good and it's really thrilling and it's really satisfying and it's really exciting.
[time=2270] And he says, you can have it, but see, we say in our culture and society now, and you know what, yeah, I know it's good and I want it now.
[time=2278] And God just says, you know what, there's a line right here.
[time=2280] And you can bucket and you can fight against me on this and you can violate it and you can transgress, step over it and you can defraud and take that which isn't yours, but you know what, it's not going to work 'cause it isn't the way I designed it.
[time=2294] Go to first Corinthians six.
[time=2301] First Corinthians six, I promise you, I promise you every time I stand up here, time speeds up.
[time=2310] First Corinthians six, 18.
[time=2314] First Corinthians six, 18, flee immorality.
[time=2318] There you go again, flee it, stay from it.
[time=2321] Do it Joseph, right, run, run, run, run, run, run, flee, get on your shoes and go.
[time=2330] He wants to go there, no, run, she wants, no, run, get out of there, flee immorality.
[time=2337] In the Greek that has an exclamation point, it means it, it means get out.
[time=2344] Every other sin, here's why, every other sin that a man commits is outside the body, but the immoral man sins against his own body.
[time=2356] Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God and that you are not your own?
[time=2365] Let me read this to you, I have for years felt this,
[time=2371] but I could never say it, just right.
[time=2374] I have for years kind of seen this in my own life to be honest with you and in the lives of others who have at times in their past or present gone down roads, they shouldn't have gone down in this moral sexual arena.
[time=2389] I've seen it, I've kind of observed it, but I've never been able to capture it just like this guy does.
[time=2394] So let me just read this to you, as it relates to the seriousness of sin, sin that is against our body and our soul.
[time=2406] Listen to what he says, every other sin that a man commits is outside the body, but the immoral man sins against his own body.
[time=2413] I believe he is saying that although sexual sin is not necessarily the worst sin, it is the most unique in its character.
[time=2422] You see, it rises from within the body, bent on personal gratification.
[time=2427] It drives like no other impulse and when fulfilled affects the body like no other sin.
[time=2433] Here it is, it has a way sexual sin does of internally destroying the person
[time=2442] in a way that no other sin has because sexual intimacy is the deepest uniting of two persons, it's misuse corrupts on the deepest human and spiritual level.
[time=2455] That is not a psychological analysis but a divinely revealed fact.
[time=2461] Sexual sin is far more destructive, far more internally destructive than alcohol,
[time=2471] far more destructive than drugs, far more destructive than crime.
[time=2475] Should we do alcohol sins, drugs sins, crime sins?
[time=2480] No.
[time=2480] And do they have their own set of ramifications?
[time=2483] Absolutely.
[time=2484] There is something about sexual sin that strikes deep into the soul
[time=2494] and being of an individual.
[time=2501] Let me show you this.
[time=2502] First Timothy, we'll end with this one.
[time=2505] First Timothy 5-1, watch this.
[time=2511] He says, Paul says to Timothy, "Do not sharply rebuke an older man "but rather appeal to him as a father." To the younger, Paul's teaching Timothy how they should be dealing with each other in relationship within the church, right?
[time=2526] To the younger men, treat them as brothers.
[time=2530] And it goes on in verse two.
[time=2531] Do we have verse two?
[time=2533] Maybe I just gave you verse one.
[time=2534] It says, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[time=2538] Do not sharply rebuke an older man but rather appeal to him as a father to the younger men as brothers.
[time=2545] The older women treat them as mothers and the younger women as sisters in all purity.
[time=2553] You see that?
[time=2556] Young men.
[time=2559] You are to, you're sitting there going, wait a minute.
[time=2562] Are you telling me I'm supposed to treat my date like my sister?
[time=2565] Yes, I am.
[time=2568] And all kidding aside, there's a lot of you young men in this room and I know, I know if somebody was gonna bring harm to your sister, you'd stand up.
[time=2580] Young men, it says, treat young women as sisters in all purity.
[time=2590] You know what, people, prior to marriage?
[time=2592] Okay, that's not everything but that's just a first quick glance, okay?
[time=2597] We could go on literally for hours painting this picture of God's moral design prior to marriage.
[time=2607] And just in 15 minutes, you know, it is absolutely clear to me and I hope it is to you that God's design prior to marriage in the moral arena is absolute purity.
[time=2625] Not sort of, not kind of, not almost,
[time=2631] but absolute purity.
[time=2634] The more I read and the more I study and the more I observe and the more I live this life and the more I face all that you face and see all that you see and the more I give my heart and life to this, the more I am of the opinion and conviction that the only person in the world that you are to experience physical intimacy with is your husband or your wife, period, that's it.
[time=2659] Proverbs 5, 15 to 18, write it down.
[time=2665] I love it because we can share it in a setting like this, one of the most kid-friendly verses on this subject.
[time=2671] You'll ever find, those of you who are tracking with me will really, really, I believe, understand and be impacted by this.
[time=2678] Look at Proverbs 5, it says in Proverbs 5, verse 15, drink water from your own cistern.
[time=2688] How's that?
[time=2691] You thirsty?
[time=2695] That's a good thing.
[time=2696] God made you to be thirsty and He made you, He designed it to work like this.
[time=2701] Drink water from your own cistern.
[time=2707] And fresh water from your own well.
[time=2710] I love how He says it.
[time=2712] Should your springs be dispersed abroad?
[time=2716] Yes or no?
[time=2717] No, streams of water in the streets?
[time=2720] No, let them be yours alone and not for strangers with you.
[time=2726] Let your fountain be blessed.
[time=2729] Proverbs 5, 18 brings into this discussion the idea of blessing.
[time=2736] There are ways in which you and I can be blessed.
[time=2738] There are ways in which we won't be.
[time=2741] It says let your fountain be blessed and rejoice, here you go, in the wife.
[time=2746] Go back to 15, please, PowerPoint.
[time=2750] Go back to 15 and rejoice in the wife.
[time=2753] Look what it says in 15.
[time=2754] Drink water from your own cistern.
[time=2757] Go back to 18, own cistern and rejoice in the wife.
[time=2762] You with me?
[time=2765] Of your youth.
[time=2766] It's so clear.
[time=2769] He has put together quite a design and it is absolutely full of joy and pleasure and excitement.
[time=2778] It's the way He made it.
[time=2779] And He designed for you and I to experience it with one person.
[time=2783] Your husband or your wife.
[time=2787] It is a sacred union designed for a sacred relationship.
[time=2794] And please, just to reiterate it and not trying to beat a dead horse, I don't think it's dead yet, so I'm gonna keep beating it.
[time=2801] God, God designed it, people.
[time=2804] MTV didn't design it.
[time=2806] Hollywood didn't design it.
[time=2812] Okay, they're trying to redesign it, right?
[time=2816] But they didn't design it.
[time=2818] And we have got to be so very careful and so very clued into the fact that this is how He designed it.
[time=2826] And it is an old fashioned and it isn't boring.
[time=2830] It's not stale.
[time=2833] It's not dull.
[time=2834] It is absolutely wonderful because He designed it and He's a good God.
[time=2842] Never put diesel fuel in your tank accidentally.
[time=2847] Now I have had gas issues, that's true.
[time=2851] But I've never done that.
[time=2853] But I've heard about what that looks like.
[time=2856] Really, anybody ever seen that?
[time=2857] Anybody ever seen diesel fuel put into a normal gasoline tank?
[time=2860] What happens?
[time=2861] The engine gets what?
[time=2864] Fried.
[time=2865] Doesn't work, spits out white smoke, card jerks won't go, eventually dies.
[time=2872] 'Cause the engine was designed for something else.
[time=2877] But oh no, we're gonna do this.
[time=2882] I think the part that concerns me, one of the things that concerns me the most, a couple things here.
[time=2888] You know what, there's consequences.
[time=2889] He designed it, he drew the line.
[time=2893] He gives you an ample opportunity to humbly and willingly follow that with great anticipation for what will come.
[time=2900] But if we don't, there are consequences.
[time=2902] There are spiritual consequences.
[time=2904] Everybody in this room who's ever gone down that road knows the guilt.
[time=2910] You know, you know what it feels like to that next day, down deep in your soul, go.
[time=2918] That wasn't the deal.
[time=2924] Yeah, people in this room know what it feels like.
[time=2929] Some of you don't even know him yet.
[time=2932] There are some in the room today and you haven't fully surrendered your life to him.
[time=2937] But you're here and maybe this was last week or maybe this was five years ago.
[time=2941] You know that at that moment there was this kind of what you would call kind of a weird feeling.
[time=2947] I would call it conviction and you didn't quite know what to call it and you didn't quite know what to make of it.
[time=2953] But there was something down deep inside of you.
[time=2955] If you're honest, it said that doesn't seem right.
[time=2959] There's consequences.
[time=2963] There's physical consequences.
[time=2966] It's called disease and we won't even get into all that this morning.
[time=2970] Here's a big one.
[time=2971] Relational consequences, people, kids, students, young adults, I'm begging you to hear me on this.
[time=2978] If you practice lust before, why do you think you won't after?
[time=2985] 96% of those who practice immorality prior to marriage
[time=2996] end up in moral failure or some kind of moral crisis.
[time=3001] If this is who we're gonna be, if this is what we're gonna practice, if this is what we're gonna try and justify, the Saturday morning at two doesn't change anything.
[time=3012] In a year, two, three years later, you know what, it's gonna come up.
[time=3015] Now, thank God.
[time=3018] And I mean that.
[time=3020] Thank God that when it does, wherever it comes up, whatever the fallout is, thank God, he's a God of forgiveness, amen?
[time=3028] Thank God, he's a God of grace, amen?
[time=3031] Thank God, he's a God of new beginnings, right?
[time=3033] The other thing I wanted to mention
[time=3039] is that I think a lot of times that this physical dilemma, this moral challenge that so many face, I was just me now, okay?
[time=3049] It's just personal opinion.
[time=3050] I think a lot of it has to do with the way we date.
[time=3055] I'm not too big on dating anymore.
[time=3060] And I got a lot of thoughts on that.
[time=3063] But just having dated, having dated, you know, in my days and having watched so many date, I mean, the way we date, it's just starting to bug me.
[time=3079] And you're going, oh, just 'cause you got kids going, you're right, it is because I've got kids growing up.
[time=3084] I'm getting tired of watching young men and women try each other on physically and emotionally and spiritually.
[time=3097] I'm getting weary of seeing young men and women as if they're walking through a coat rack, picking one up, trying one on, putting it back.
[time=3110] Picking one up, trying one on, putting it back.
[time=3113] Picking one up, oh, this one went a little further.
[time=3117] I said a little bit more, I did a little bit more, experienced a little bit more.
[time=3121] Ah, I'm done, back on the rack.
[time=3124] And the one getting put back on the rack and the one moving on to the next right, equally is damaging.
[time=3136] See, I believe God's design in the moral arena prior to marriage is purity, absolute purity.
[time=3145] And what happens is in the dating relationship, like it or not, the physical gets brought to the forefront.
[time=3152] It happens again and it, Christ following couples, seeking, I don't care who you are, when you start spending time together, this is where it gravitates toward, the physical.
[time=3162] Am I right or am I wrong?
[time=3164] I'm right on that one, okay, thanks.
[time=3167] And what gets shoved to the side?
[time=3169] See, this becomes the focus.
[time=3171] And what gets shoved to the side is friendship building, relationship building, time, lots of it with family and friends, understanding personalities and what the certain needs are and learning how to deal with conflict and learning how to deal with resolving, I mean, all the things that will be needed for the rest of their lives gets pushed over here to the side.
[time=3193] And we'll read a book when we get married.
[time=3196] And meantime, we're in the basement, we're in the car, we're at the apartment, we're at the park.
[time=3202] I mean, and we might be struggling and trying to fight against it or we might just be saying whatever, but this is at the forefront.
[time=3209] I say, take this and move it to the side.
[time=3214] Take the physical, all of it and take it right over here and plan it right here and come back and revisit it that night.
[time=3225] And you know what?
[time=3227] I think it'll be just fine.
[time=3229] Anybody here I'll tell you, I think you'll be just fine because if you've been in the next six to 12 to 18 months, building a friendship, building a relationship, spending time with people, living in accountability, understanding what ministry looks like, understanding personality, I mean, if you spend some life together instead of some nights together, wow, what a great picture.
[time=3255] My wife and I, when we started dating,
[time=3262] and boy, we had learned some hard lessons prior to meeting each other.
[time=3270] So we just knew, we knew where that went and so we just, my wife and I, back 17 years ago, said we're gonna hold hands.
[time=3278] That's it.
[time=3280] We're just gonna hold hands.
[time=3283] I was really attracted to her.
[time=3285] I think she was somewhat attracted to me.
[time=3287] I shouldn't speak for her.
[time=3288] And we had a lot of fun together and we said, you know what?
[time=3293] We're just gonna hold hands.
[time=3294] And then as, you know, three months turned into seven or eight and we kind of got an idea where this thing was going.
[time=3299] Then we just said, you know what?
[time=3301] Until we get to a point where we know that we are just going to hold hands and so we just held hands until we got engaged.
[time=3307] And some of you might sit there and go, wow.
[time=3312] You just held hands until you got engaged.
[time=3315] Great job.
[time=3316] Well, I'm here to tell you, we undershot that a little bit.
[time=3322] And call me what you will.
[time=3325] That's okay.
[time=3326] You can call me, whatever you wanna call me.
[time=3327] We should have just gone ahead and gone the extra mile.
[time=3330] 'Cause guess how we did after engagement.
[time=3335] Not so good.
[time=3336] And I'm just here to tell you, once you start, okay?
[time=3342] I know I'm gonna sound like dad here, but it's okay.
[time=3344] I'm a dad.
[time=3345] Once you start the intimacy process, you're going to finish.
[time=3353] It's just a matter of when.
[time=3355] And there are so much to be gained and so much to be gleaned and so much to be experienced.
[time=3362] And if you're here today and you've gone down some road, you shouldn't have gone down.
[time=3365] If you are in clear violation of God's design, some folks ask me, hey, should we live together?
[time=3370] No.
[time=3371] You shouldn't live together.
[time=3374] Would living together in your mind somehow honor this design that God's word has laid out for us this morning?
[time=3381] You say to me, well, we're not gonna, you know what?
[time=3383] Don't kid yourself.
[time=3385] Of course you're going to.
[time=3387] Jake comes to me and says, Dad, can I go to the pond?
[time=3389] And I say, yeah, Jake, go to the pond.
[time=3390] And I don't say to Jake, take your life jacket.
[time=3393] Jake's gonna go to the pond, walk on the dock and jump in the pond and he's gonna die.
[time=3398] He's just gonna do it.
[time=3400] 'Cause I know him.
[time=3401] He's just gonna jump in the pond.
[time=3403] And if I don't give him the jacket, he's dead.
[time=3406] It's just gonna happen.
[time=3409] Ephesians five, next week, guys, we'll get to the five marks of a godly husband.
[time=3413] One of those guys is that he protects his wife or his wife to be from sin.
[time=3419] As a guy committed to her best interest, as a guy committed to the spiritual health of that relationship, he's not gonna do anything that would put her in danger.
[time=3429] Should you live together?
[time=3430] No, of course not.
[time=3433] Is everything else but, and another question
[time=3440] that often comes, and you know what?
[time=3441] Not just from 16-year-olds.
[time=3442] Is everything but the final act?
[time=3445] Okay, no, it's not.
[time=3448] Everything else but isn't okay.
[time=3451] You are to know and experience one other person, intimately and physically in your life.
[time=3459] And that person is your husband or your wife, that night in that room.
[time=3464] Hebrews three, four, don't defile that.
[time=3469] And if you have, you know what, good news.
[time=3472] He's a God of forgiveness.
[time=3473] Grace can be extended.
[time=3475] You can draw some new lines.
[time=3477] You can get some help.
[time=3478] Next week we'll talk about the second thing.
[time=3480] Relational isolation.
[time=3482] 'Cause oftentimes we just separate ourselves as couples.
[time=3487] And you need to be with people in community for the accountability that comes for these new lines that maybe you need to draw.
[time=3494] Come back and be with us, okay?
[time=3495] We'll just stand and let's pray together.
[time=3497] God as we leave this morning, we thank you so very much for the truth of your word, and we thank you God for this beautiful thing called marriage.
[time=3506] God, those that are moving in that direction, I pray that these truths would help them get there in a way that would honor you.
[time=3514] And God as we spend time in the weeks to come, looking at the marriage relationship and parenting, God prepare our hearts, bring us back and God bring just the right people to hear just the right message at just the right time.
[time=3527] And we will give honor and glory to you.
[time=3529] In your son's name we pray, amen.
[time=3534] (upbeat music)
