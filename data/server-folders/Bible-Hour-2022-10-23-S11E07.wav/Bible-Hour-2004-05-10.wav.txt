[time=30] (dramatic music) (upbeat music)
[time=60] (upbeat music) - We continue this morning in our series
[time=87] for better or for worse.
[time=89] God's design for marriage and family.
[time=92] And I want you to just kind of sit back and take this in, what you're about to see.
[time=97] I would guess for most of you married in the room, this probably will hit somewhere close to home.
[time=104] You've probably been here.
[time=105] You've probably had this conversation.
[time=108] Important though to just kind of take it in this morning as we continue to look at God's word and what He would want for you and I as husbands and wives.
[time=116] Just watch and listen.
[time=120] - Oh hey, did I tell you that Jim and his boss asked me to play golf after work on Thursday so I won't be home for dinner.
[time=126] I'll just grab something at the clubhouse.
[time=128] I shouldn't be any later than 8.30, quarter or nine.
[time=132] Is that gonna be okay?
[time=134] - And if I say it isn't?
[time=135] - What?
[time=138] It's a business thing.
[time=140] Do you have something else planned?
[time=142] - Why are you asking for my permission?
[time=144] Sounds like your plans are already set.
[time=146] So what does it matter if I had something else in mind?
[time=149] - Did you?
[time=150] - No, but I could have.
[time=154] Look, we agreed to discuss evening plans before they were fine.
[time=158] - Do you want me to cancel?
[time=160] - No, don't do that.
[time=162] - Okay then.
[time=164] I'll have more details tomorrow.
[time=165] Jim and I have a 6 a.m. meeting before we meet with that big client.
[time=169] Man, it's after 11.
[time=174] I'm looking at five hours sleep.
[time=176] You ready to hit the hay?
[time=179] (sighs) Is everything okay?
[time=185] Look, if you're mad about the golf thing, I can cancel it.
[time=188] You just say the word.
[time=190] - Yeah, right.
[time=191] - Oh, it's no big deal.
[time=192] If you're that upset about it, we can play it another night other than Thursday, Wednesday or Tuesday, okay?
[time=198] It's not about the golf thing, is it?
[time=204] What is it?
[time=209] Look, I don't have time for 20 questions tonight.
[time=214] Why don't we just get to the crux of the problem and you tell me where I've screwed up again.
[time=219] I've got a huge day tomorrow and not a lot of sleep between now and then.
[time=224] - And that's my problem?
[time=227] Look, you're the one that sits in front of the TV watching every police drama and teen sex show on the WB.
[time=232] You're the one that goes out to mow the grass and ends up yacking with the neighbors for three hours.
[time=237] - And you're the one that gets caught up in all the sports magazines.
[time=241] - Here we go again.
[time=245] Because you never seem to get it.
[time=247] We rehash these same problems over and over and over.
[time=250] - Yeah, at 11 o'clock.
[time=252] The night before I have a huge meeting, it's like you punished me twice over.
[time=256] First you yell at me for 45 minutes.
[time=259] Get me all riled up so that I can't sleep.
[time=261] I might as well just get up for the day and go into the office.
[time=264] - Why not?
[time=265] It's where you seem to want to be 24/7.
[time=267] Anyway.
[time=268] - Oh, well now we're getting somewhere.
[time=270] This is about how much I work, isn't it?
[time=273] I know your playbook.
[time=275] Let me see.
[time=275] I work too much.
[time=278] Don't spend enough time with the kids.
[time=280] Oh, you'd like to have a vacation.
[time=282] You feel like a single mom, et cetera, right now.
[time=284] Can I go to sleep?
[time=285] - Yeah, go to sleep.
[time=287] Go right ahead.
[time=288] I'd hate to wreck your day tomorrow.
[time=290] Never mind that I too have an early morning and a lot on my plate, but you would have no idea.
[time=296] You have no idea what it is I do every day to keep this house running, to keep the kids focused, fed, shut it around and so on.
[time=304] Oh my goodness, you're like an ostrich with your head in the sand.
[time=308] If you don't see it, it doesn't exist.
[time=310] Food miraculously appears on the table.
[time=315] Your clothes are magically cleaned, folded and put away.
[time=318] The bills are paid on time.
[time=319] - Yeah, yeah, with the money I bring home for working so long, you know, we're just keep going around in that big circle we've gone in for years.
[time=326] - Yes, because you don't listen.
[time=329] You don't hear me and you certainly don't change.
[time=332] What were the two things I ask you to do this weekend?
[time=337] - I don't even know.
[time=341] - The van.
[time=345] I told you it was making funny noises.
[time=347] You were gonna drive it to see what was wrong.
[time=349] - This is about the van.
[time=351] Look, I can look at it in the morning.
[time=356] It's no big deal.
[time=357] - No big deal.
[time=358] No big deal to you.
[time=360] The big deal is again, you don't hear me.
[time=364] I reminded you eight times.
[time=367] I'm sure you're gonna do it tomorrow, but that's beside the point.
[time=370] You said you were gonna do it this weekend.
[time=373] An Emily science project, that was the other thing.
[time=376] She wanted to go to the library this weekend to start on the research and you promised to take her.
[time=381] I reminded you Thursday, Friday and yesterday.
[time=385] Oh, but other things just crept in on you and you conveniently forgot, which means I have to take her tomorrow is if I don't already have enough to do.
[time=393] And the golf thing Thursday, over and over and over, you do this to me.
[time=399] You make plans without consulting me.
[time=401] This just happened two weeks ago and here we are again.
[time=405] Looks like my Thursday's shot too.
[time=408] - Are you done or is there more?
[time=415] - You haven't heard a thing I've said, have you?
[time=417] - Oh yeah, I heard it all loud and clear.
[time=420] I'll talk to Emily in the morning.
[time=424] You drive my car so I can listen to the van.
[time=427] I'll cancel golf on Thursday, okay?
[time=429] - You haven't heard a thing.
[time=431] - Midnight, four hours sleep if I'm lucky.
[time=440] Who am I kidding?
[time=445] I might as well just to get a shower and go to the office.
[time=448] - For better or for worse, God's designed for marriage and family.
[time=455] And if he goes and cancels the golf, who ends up looking like the idiot?
[time=461] Well, we'll answer that question later.
[time=466] Hey, I wanted to just real quick, before we jump into our topic this morning, which is God honoring husbands and husbands who honor God and husbands who honor their wives.
[time=482] I want to just, if we could, just go back to our discussion last week.
[time=485] It was just one more thing I wanted to try and communicate before we moved on from our discussion.
[time=491] If you were here last week, that we spent some time looking at God's design for marriage, but really we took a week to kind of look at God's design for us prior to marriage.
[time=501] And we looked at God's moral design as we asked ourselves, I think some very important questions.
[time=508] We made some very important statements.
[time=509] One of them was this, who we are as couples, what begins to take place especially early on in marriage?
[time=517] A lot of it, not all of it, but a lot of it has to do with what we were doing prior to marriage.
[time=522] The things that we practice, the things that we gave ourselves to, the way that we were thinking, the way that we were choosing, the world that we were living in, prior to that Saturday afternoon at two with all the family and friends and flowers, that has a lot to do with who we are as a couple, especially in those early years.
[time=542] Last week, we just kind of got, we got into one point and that was that when we practice lust instead of love, prior to marriage, when we practice lust instead of love, we often practice lust instead of love after.
[time=558] And we looked closely at God's moral design.
[time=562] What is intended by God for a man and a woman prior to marriage?
[time=568] And if you missed it, I would encourage you to get the CD or the tape or the DVD.
[time=573] Secondly, I wanted to say this, and one and two kind of play into three.
[time=577] Secondly, what happens before marriage that's of real concern, and I think very, very much against what God's word lays out for us, is that I see couples and not just 15, 16, 17 year olds.
[time=590] I oftentimes see young adults and even older adults practicing isolation instead of community.
[time=599] Isolation instead of community.
[time=602] It's amazing to me how strong, how the strong attraction between a guy and a gal can turn previously bright level headed people, social people, fun loving people, life of the party type people, even, all of a sudden, they become absolute hermits.
[time=619] You ever noticed that?
[time=620] You ever seen a couple kind of hook up and get together and then before you know it, they've kind of dropped off the face of the earth.
[time=625] Nobody sees him, nobody's around him, everybody kind of wonders.
[time=628] What happened to Donnie and Sally?
[time=631] Well, look at Ecclesiastes 4.12.
[time=634] Let's just be reminded here, before we move on this morning to husbands, I just want to make this point.
[time=639] God's word makes it so clear.
[time=641] Ecclesiastes 4.12.
[time=643] You can look it up there in your Old Testament.
[time=645] You can look on the screen if you don't have a Bible this morning, it says, and if one can overpower him, who is alone, two can resist him.
[time=652] A chord of three strands is not quickly torn apart.
[time=662] People, it's very, very important for us to understand this morning that God made you, God designed you.
[time=670] We're talking about God's design for marriage.
[time=672] Wait a minute, back up.
[time=673] God designed you, and God designed me.
[time=676] We were made, the Bible says, in whose image?
[time=679] Whose image, in God's image?
[time=681] We have been created, you and I.
[time=683] We have been designed in God's image.
[time=685] God is a God of community.
[time=687] God, God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit, the three of them tightly wound.
[time=691] He is a God of relationship, and God designed you, and He designed me not to live alone.
[time=699] He didn't make us to live out there on the edge.
[time=702] He made us to live together.
[time=704] The New Testament speaks to this again and again and again.
[time=709] Jesus lays out for us, as do the apostles later, the beauty of the one and others.
[time=714] The one and others, listen to this.
[time=717] Just be reminded of this this morning.
[time=720] We have been individually, and yes, even as couples.
[time=723] We have been designed by God for the one and others.
[time=726] We are told in the scriptures to encourage each other, to support each other, confront each other when necessary, pray for each other, bear each other's burdens, watch out for each other, serve each other, exhort each other, warn each other, come alongside each other, and build each other up.
[time=744] It's called loving each other.
[time=746] But the problem is this, so you can't get loved on.
[time=750] You can't get warned, you can't get encouraged, you can't get prayed for, you can't get supported.
[time=756] If you're what, if you're alone, if somehow you've postured yourself separated from
[time=765] this family that God designed you to live with and in.
[time=769] When I see it happen often, I see it happen often with couples.
[time=776] And if you're looking at, and if you're desiring, if it's deep in your heart, to have a marriage that on the other side of the ceremony honors God, a marriage that's growing, a marriage that's healthy, a marriage that's all that God intended it to be, if that's what your desire is, then understand prior to marriage, the way not only you conduct yourself morally, but the way you posture yourself with the people in your life, the way you conduct yourself and connect yourself to the community that God has placed in your life, the accountability that comes with the community, the relationship and friendship that comes from those who love you and know you, your willingness to be connected to them, not isolated from them, but connected to them, goes a long way in developing in your heart and mind healthy God honoring patterns for life after the ceremony.
[time=836] It's interesting, I'd say 90 to 95% of the time, whenever I come in contact with a couple who they were here one day, and again, this could be teenagers, this could be young adults at 90 to 95% of the time, when there's this couple and they were here one day and now all of a sudden they're gone, you're going like, where did they go?
[time=862] You ever seen that, 90 to 95% of the time, they're gone because of what we talked about last week.
[time=871] Oftentimes their distance, oftentimes their departure from the scene is guilt and shame, because they know in their hearts that the way in which they've been conducting themselves isn't at all what God designed, and so they remove themselves from those who would say something, those who would care about them, those who would love them enough to confront them, those who would function as the body of Christ.
[time=900] See, they just come over here.
[time=902] Now all of a sudden nobody really knows where we are, nobody really knows what we're doing, nobody really isn't, you know, my grandpa and my dad, I mean, I heard it from both of them, and I know it's a little corny, but it's really a good picture.
[time=918] You've heard the analogy of the charcoal briquettes that you would use for a, you know, when you're gonna grill out the, you pour the Kingsford in the bottom of the Weber kettle, right?
[time=930] I know we all use gas now, but in the good old days, right?
[time=934] Remember that, and you'd spray the Kingsford on there or whatever it was, and you take that match and poof.
[time=942] And you had them all kind of cool, they were all stacked up in kind of a pyramid type deal, right?
[time=945] And the edges of all the little black charcoal briquettes would start to get what, white, yeah.
[time=952] And then after a while, they'd go from being white to like getting kind of red.
[time=955] And then before you know it, 15, 20 minutes later, you've got yourself this towering inferno.
[time=960] I mean, it's hot, and then it's like you're excited like me, 'cause it's time to eat.
[time=967] It's time to put the meat on, because those things are absolutely blazing.
[time=971] They're all stacked in there together, right?
[time=973] And then you take one, you just take a tong, you know, tongs, and you reach, and then you just take one, and you just take that one, you put it over here at the other end, and let it go.
[time=982] And when you put it over here, it was hot, light around the edges, a little red in the middle, right?
[time=987] You let that thing sit there for about a half hour, and what happens to it?
[time=990] The other, the others continue to blaze.
[time=993] The others continue, here's the point, to function as they were designed to.
[time=998] You take one of those babies out of there, put it over here in an a half hour, it's what?
[time=1002] It's out, it's gone, it's done.
[time=1005] Even if you hit it, it just falls apart, unravels.
[time=1010] Sound familiar?
[time=1012] See, that's what happens to you and I, when we attempt to live life alone in isolation.
[time=1017] We need each other.
[time=1020] And hey, on the relationship front, we're gonna say this, and then we'll move on.
[time=1024] On the relationship front, if you ask me, one of the groups of people that really, really needs to be careful, I mean, I know society's doing this, and I know cultures going this way, one group that really needs to be careful, and how it is we conduct ourselves, and how it is we choose and decide, and how it is we lead, especially with our young people, is a group of us called parents.
[time=1052] Just a reminder to you, that 15-year-old, 14-year-old of yours, that 16, 17-year-old of yours, and that guy or gal that they seem to, you know, they weren't made by God, they weren't designed by God to be together alone in isolation now.
[time=1075] I see that commercial, maybe you've seen the commercial on TV lately, and I know there's a part of the commercial that it's kind of cute.
[time=1087] I understand that, I'm okay with it being kind of cute.
[time=1089] It catches my attention 'cause we're talking about these things, it's the dad who takes the son out on the date with his girlfriend, it's like the kid's first date, he's like 14, 15 can't drive, so the dad's driving him around, have you seen that?
[time=1102] Yeah, and he goes and does, it's kind of a cool dad son thing, and then the guy gets back home and the kid comes in and spits a smile and walks upstairs, and the mom says, did he kiss her?
[time=1114] Well, okay, fine, you know, and that cute, you know,
[time=1120] well, just be careful, I'm just saying be careful, I'm not drawing lines for you, I'm just saying be careful with our young people as to what situations we not only encourage, but even provide, you know, I just would encourage you as parents to do everything you can to maintain relationship with your kids, to maintain involvement with your kids, to do everything you can to provide settings where they can enjoy themselves and their friends, and especially when we get into the guy gal thing, enjoying their friends with others, not pushing them down to the basement, not allowing for three to four, you know, just be really, really careful.
[time=1165] Isolation isn't what God designed, He designed community.
[time=1171] Okay, let's move on.
[time=1173] Let's move on this morning to God honoring husbands.
[time=1178] God honoring husbands.
[time=1182] What about husbands, huh?
[time=1186] We are quite a, we are quite a crew, aren't we, ladies?
[time=1191] God honoring husbands, husbands and wives, men and women, quite a contradiction in some ways.
[time=1202] And I think if I were just going to, and I'm sure if you were gonna try and summarize us, men and women, one of the words that just comes to the absolute top of the list is that we are so very, what, different.
[time=1217] We are really, really different, aren't we?
[time=1222] Are we different?
[time=1224] We're really, really different.
[time=1225] You don't have to go past just thinking about that, that man or that woman, and maybe that, you know, your wife, your husband, your spouse, I mean, if you just think about your own situation, you can probably begin to just rattle off differences that are in some situations mind-boggling.
[time=1240] My wife and I, we just talked about it this week, and we had fun, you know, talking about it, but there's times that gets kind of annoying, I know, for her, take food.
[time=1250] All right, we'll take food.
[time=1252] This is just my wife and I talk in this week.
[time=1254] She likes her food, if we're just going food in general, she likes her food green and crunchy.
[time=1261] I like my food beige and creamy.
[time=1263] Do you with me on that?
[time=1267] And that's really, really different.
[time=1269] But she likes it green and crunchy, I like it beige and creamy, music.
[time=1273] She likes her music background music.
[time=1276] She likes her music to be background and soothing.
[time=1279] I like my music to be in your face, I like it to rattle your sternum, right there?
[time=1284] I like it when my sternum kind of thumps with the bass.
[time=1287] It's just, if it's physically affecting my body, then we're at a good place there.
[time=1293] Television, she will go to great lengths, she will sacrifice, she will work hard to be able to periodically watch PBS.
[time=1301] I myself would much prefer a guy say it with me, E-S-P-N.
[time=1306] A good time, how do you define a good time?
[time=1308] Between you and your spouse.
[time=1309] A good time, my wife's idea of a really good time would be a small number of close friends.
[time=1314] The key word there in her situation would be small.
[time=1317] And that's just the way she is.
[time=1318] She's just really energized by and really enjoys just small, very small, quiet gatherings of really good friends.
[time=1325] My idea of a good time would be 67 of my best friends.
[time=1331] All in the same room, with E-S-P-N going, loud sternum rattling music and bass, creamy food at the buffet.
[time=1337] I mean, could that be any better?
[time=1339] Oh my goodness, oh man, thank you guys.
[time=1344] Bunch of young men up there.
[time=1346] That's the first time you guys have ever clapped for me.
[time=1350] I want you to know that.
[time=1352] I am so thankful.
[time=1353] Now I know how to get to your heart.
[time=1355] You know, she, we had this battle the other day at the thermostat.
[time=1359] Eric, and she sets the AC at 74.
[time=1362] What?
[time=1366] I told, I said, that's not air conditioning.
[time=1367] That's air warming.
[time=1369] I mean, I couldn't think of anything more uncomfortable than to walk into a house to an AC system set at 74.
[time=1375] But we're just, we're just really, really different, aren't we?
[time=1380] Hey, I got this this week.
[time=1381] Don't put it up yet.
[time=1382] Here's a list for you.
[time=1384] This is great.
[time=1384] And I want to say before I read the list, I really am serious.
[time=1387] We have a lot of creative women in our midst.
[time=1389] Please, ladies, somebody write down a list like this.
[time=1393] And I will read it.
[time=1394] I mean, this list, we're going to have some fun, you know, as guys reading this list.
[time=1398] But I bet there's a couple of ladies out there who could submit a list of rules for gals.
[time=1404] These are a newly published list of, somebody finally sat down and wrote some rules out for the guys to communicate to that special woman in his or her life.
[time=1413] Here we go.
[time=1414] New list, guys, the guys rules.
[time=1416] Okay, ladies, Sunday sports.
[time=1418] It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides.
[time=1421] Let it be.
[time=1421] It will always be there.
[time=1424] Shopping is not a sport.
[time=1427] Rule number two.
[time=1428] And no, we are never going to think of it that way.
[time=1429] Number three, crying is blackmail.
[time=1432] [LAUGHTER] Now, come on, be honest, it is.
[time=1438] I know sometimes you're really hurt, but come on.
[time=1442] It's blackmail sometimes.
[time=1444] Ask-- oh, this is very important.
[time=1445] Here we go, very practical.
[time=1446] Ask for what you want.
[time=1448] Let us be clear on this one.
[time=1449] Subtle hints do not work.
[time=1450] Strong hints do not work.
[time=1451] Obvious hints do not work.
[time=1453] Just say it.
[time=1456] Oh, oh.
[time=1460] Oh, this is so good.
[time=1462] I laughed so hard.
[time=1463] Lori was at her desk wondering what in the world was going on in my office.
[time=1467] I was just cracking up.
[time=1468] Anything we said six months ago is inadmissible in an argument.
[time=1472] In fact, all comments become null and void after seven minutes.
[time=1476] Oh, seven days.
[time=1477] I'm sorry.
[time=1478] Seven days.
[time=1479] Oh, my goodness.
[time=1480] Christopher Columbus didn't need directions, and neither do we.
[time=1483] Amen?
[time=1483] When we have to go, oh, this is good.
[time=1489] When we have to go somewhere, absolutely, anything you wear is fine.
[time=1492] Really?
[time=1494] Oh, if we ask what is wrong, and you say nothing,
[time=1501] we will act like nothing is wrong.
[time=1503] We know you're lying, but it's just easier that way.
[time=1508] Oh, oh, this is-- and this is the classic right here.
[time=1514] If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of the ways makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.
[time=1520] Oh, my goodness.
[time=1524] Ladies, thank you for reading this.
[time=1525] Yes, I know.
[time=1526] This means we have to sleep on the couch tonight.
[time=1528] But did you know men don't really mind that?
[time=1530] It's like camping.
[time=1534] Oh, wow.
[time=1539] So, ladies, somebody come up with a new list,
[time=1545] and I promise we'll read it.
[time=1547] But here's the-- we can laugh about all that, because it's all so, so very true.
[time=1552] But here's the deal.
[time=1553] The differences oftentimes people reveal deficiencies in us.
[time=1563] We are really different.
[time=1566] And because we're so different, sometimes it just goes to show how much we need each other.
[time=1573] The differences between men and women leave us incomplete as it relates to full marital potential.
[time=1578] I mean, let me just say it to you this way, this guy in the couch today.
[time=1581] I mean, I could really, really identify with him.
[time=1584] But much more so in the first five years, every once in a while, you know, still today, but especially early on.
[time=1592] For instance, when I say the differences between men and women leave us incomplete as it relates to full marital potential, see, I was a horrible listener when we first got married.
[time=1605] I stunk.
[time=1607] I did not listen.
[time=1609] I had an agenda.
[time=1612] My world and this world I had invited her into was pretty much about me.
[time=1617] And I didn't listen, and most arguments ended up being her fault.
[time=1625] I was a really bad listener.
[time=1628] Today, 17 years later, with someone who is a very gifted
[time=1634] listener, who has been patient most of the time, who has been loving and kind, you know, most of the time who God has used.
[time=1642] Today, I'm a better listener.
[time=1644] I'm not a perfect listener.
[time=1646] But my listening skills, my listening capacity, compared to what it was, 17 years ago, absolutely astonishing.
[time=1654] You would nominate me for listener of the year if you had a picture of where I was.
[time=1659] God does that.
[time=1661] He takes these things in us, and he strengthens us, and he grows us, because so oftentimes the ones that we're with have strengths in areas where we're weak.
[time=1671] She was initially when we first met in the early years of marriage she would tell you today.
[time=1676] She was very pessimistic.
[time=1679] That can be hard in a relationship.
[time=1681] She grew up with that.
[time=1683] It's all she knew.
[time=1684] It was pessimism.
[time=1685] The glass was not half empty with her.
[time=1687] It was-- it was-- it was broke.
[time=1690] There was nothing in it.
[time=1692] And today, she would tell you, you know, God has used His Word and God has used others.
[time=1699] She, you know, she marries Mr. Happy.
[time=1701] And she's made huge progress there.
[time=1706] He does that with our differences.
[time=1709] Now, let me say this as I talk about full marital potential.
[time=1713] Let me say this to you, and there's a lot of you in the room who this applies to.
[time=1718] Let me say this as it relates to those not married.
[time=1722] I don't know what God has for all of you, relationally.
[time=1726] He may in the end have you flying solo.
[time=1729] He may in the end have you on your own.
[time=1731] He may in the end have you not married when it's all said and done.
[time=1735] And the most-- listen here-- and the most powerful kingdom impact that you could possibly have may be you in relationship with Him using and exercising all of your spiritual gifts with the added time opportunities and resources that come with not being married.
[time=1753] Please, hang on to this.
[time=1755] Marriage and kids is not the goal.
[time=1760] I know that it can become the goal.
[time=1763] And I understand why it may become the goal.
[time=1768] But be lovingly, gently reminded this morning that it is not the goal.
[time=1774] The goal is that He has called you and I to make a kingdom difference here.
[time=1779] The goal is He has called you and I with these few short years that we have.
[time=1784] You know, our lifetimes are a blip on this screen of eternity with this little bit of time that He's provided.
[time=1792] He has called you and I to fundamentally, aside from and beyond, marriage and kids, be fully surrendered followers of Christ, who has living stones, as Mitch and Brent talked about a few weeks ago, as living stones are willing to be thrown into the ministry kingdom waters of the local church, so that others, by God's grace and through God's effort, others may come to faith in Him.
[time=1819] And He allows us to be a part of that amazing endeavor and that you and I being a part of that.
[time=1825] That's the goal.
[time=1826] I may do that.
[time=1828] I may, Kelly, I may do that with limited time, opportunities and resources.
[time=1835] And by saying limited, I'm not knocking my wife, my kids, my family and all that comes with that.
[time=1840] I'm just being honest and realistic.
[time=1842] That means that there is limited time.
[time=1846] That's why Paul said what he said in 1 Corinthians 7.
[time=1848] You should read it sometime.
[time=1850] Being on your own, if that's in fact what God's called you to, it's not the end of the world.
[time=1856] In fact, Paul says in 1 Corinthians 7, it gives you ample opportunity to do that which God has called us to do.
[time=1863] I may do it with limited time.
[time=1865] You may do it with expanded time, opportunities and resources through the joys of life without marriage.
[time=1871] Either way, impacting our world for Christ is the goal.
[time=1876] So keep your hearts and your minds and your eyes open.
[time=1881] I don't know what God has for you.
[time=1883] It's good for you who are not married to listen to these things.
[time=1887] Someday you may be married, but you know what?
[time=1889] Someday you may not be, but you'll have married friends who you can encourage with the truth of God's design.
[time=1894] So let's look at God's design for these two very different individuals.
[time=1900] Men and women, God's design for marriage.
[time=1903] And that begins with his design for a husband.
[time=1906] Would you turn to Ephesians chapter 5?
[time=1909] Ephesians chapter 5 verses 25 to 31.
[time=1915] And in honor of God's word, would you stand with me this morning as we read this Ephesians 5, 25 to 31.
[time=1925] Here we go.
[time=1926] It says, "Husbands, love your wives.
[time=1928] Just as Christ also loved the church and gave himself up for her so that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, that he might present to himself the church, his bride, in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she would be holy and blameless." So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies.
[time=1953] He who loves his own wife loves himself for no one, verse 29.
[time=1957] Ever hated his own flesh but nourishes it and cherishes it.
[time=1963] Just as Christ also does the church because we are members of his body for this reason.
[time=1970] A man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife and the two shall become one flesh.
[time=1979] God, as we stand here this morning in this room and as we open our hearts and our minds, God, to the transforming, renewing power of the Scriptures.
[time=1991] We pray, God, that you would take this truth.
[time=1994] And in that powerful way that only you can pull off, God, that you would take this truth and that you would inject it into our lives, our minds, our relationships, our choices, God, that this truth would permeate every part of us.
[time=2011] As husbands and as wives, God, in that we would be humble enough and willing enough and ready enough to be changed by you, by your spirit and by your word.
[time=2024] Please keep your hand on this discussion, on these things that we would consider.
[time=2031] And we'll thank you for it in your son's name.
[time=2033] We pray. Amen. You can have a seat.
[time=2040] We had the privilege this week and I mean it.
[time=2044] It was a privilege.
[time=2046] Death is always a sad.
[time=2049] There's oftentimes things about death that obviously bring great sadness when the one who has passed away is a fully surrendered follower of Christ.
[time=2060] There also comes with death, a great rejoicing, a great celebration,
[time=2066] a celebration in where that person is today at that moment and a celebration of his or her life.
[time=2072] And this week around here we got to celebrate quite a life.
[time=2076] Brian Marshall went to be with the Lord a few days ago and we had
[time=2082] the joy this week of celebrating his life here together at the church.
[time=2087] Many came and I was so thankful for what I saw and what I heard.
[time=2093] Chris, Brian's wife, his sons, Nick and James, God has blessed
[time=2101] them.
[time=2102] God gave him a great gift in Brian.
[time=2105] He passed away at the age of 40 after a long fight with cancer.
[time=2110] And in those 40 years though, just to hear again the stories and to sense how God used Brian to encourage and challenge so many.
[time=2120] It was truly amazing.
[time=2122] In the midst of all of that, I came across and it was actually on the bulletin that morning at the memorial service.
[time=2129] Something that I think a friend had.
[time=2131] I don't know Kevin Carlstrom.
[time=2133] I believe he's a friend of Brian's.
[time=2135] And at some point in this journey, Kevin recorded some thoughts about what it meant to be a real man.
[time=2142] And these were printed on the bulletin.
[time=2144] I just kept them for myself and I'll probably hang on to this for a while.
[time=2149] Says this, I'll read it to you.
[time=2150] You can follow along.
[time=2151] It says, "I used to think I knew what it meant to be a man.
[time=2154] A man is big, strong, tough, brave and independent.
[time=2158] To some extent, that's true.
[time=2160] I have discovered a real man is much more than that.
[time=2164] A real man is intelligent, righteous, honest, selfless and courageous.
[time=2169] It is hard to be a real man.
[time=2172] A real man is intelligent, righteous, honest, selfless and courageous.
[time=2178] It is hard to be a real man.
[time=2181] It is lonely being a real man.
[time=2183] It means putting your needs last.
[time=2186] No matter how great your needs are.
[time=2188] It means taking care of others.
[time=2190] When you deserve to have others take care of you.
[time=2193] It means being a leader.
[time=2194] When you aren't sure you can find your way, it means being brave when those around you are frightened.
[time=2200] It means taking the right path, not the easy path.
[time=2205] If you are like me and you are in this room today and you are a
[time=2212] man, you read those words and something really deep inside of you.
[time=2216] That is it.
[time=2219] That captures in such a tremendous way the essence of who I
[time=2225] really down deep inside.
[time=2227] You cut away all the garbage down deep inside.
[time=2230] That is who I want to be.
[time=2232] But like every other man in this room, if I am going to be honest with you this morning, being that is really, really challenging.
[time=2242] And that statement has nothing to do with my wife.
[time=2245] It is just challenging because I am me.
[time=2250] It is challenging because I battle daily with the enemy.
[time=2256] But if you are here today and there is something about that that is inviting, there is something about that that you want to pursue.
[time=2263] I would invite you to turn with me as we have to Ephesians 5 because here in the pages of Scripture he lays out for us.
[time=2270] A five step kind of a five point outline that paints a picture for you.
[time=2276] A picture watch me now.
[time=2277] A picture that you can follow.
[time=2279] A picture that you can give yourself to.
[time=2282] Five amazing truths right here in 25 to 30 that allow for you and
[time=2288] I am meant to understand what a God honoring wife honoring husband really looks like.
[time=2296] And it starts there.
[time=2297] I hope you have your pens.
[time=2298] I hope you have something to write on.
[time=2300] There are, for better or for worse, gods designed for marriage and family notebooks for you out at the resource table if you want to stop and get one later.
[time=2309] You may want to write some things down in the next seven or eight weeks.
[time=2312] Let's begin today by looking at Ephesians 5 and a God honoring husband.
[time=2316] God honoring husbands number one sacrifice for their wives.
[time=2320] Write it down.
[time=2321] God honoring husbands make it a habit they are known for.
[time=2324] They are characterized by being men who sacrifice for their wives.
[time=2331] Husbands verse 25 love your wives just as.
[time=2336] Now guys, sometimes we go through this pretty quickly.
[time=2339] Today I'm going to ask you to slow down a little bit.
[time=2341] Look at that verse.
[time=2342] Husbands love your wives just as.
[time=2345] Just as.
[time=2353] Christ.
[time=2358] Also loved the church and gave himself up for her.
[time=2365] Now there's a picture I want you to see.
[time=2367] I'm going to call for it in just a minute here.
[time=2369] First I want to read you something.
[time=2371] As I read I really want you to listen and I really want you to picture what I'm reading.
[time=2377] And then I'm going to have you look at a picture with me.
[time=2381] Came across this in a book this week by John Piper.
[time=2385] Under the title giving marriage it's deepest meaning he writes this.
[time=2389] God's designed for marriage in the Bible pictures the husband loving his wife the way Christ loves his people and the wife responding to her husband the way Christ's people should respond to him.
[time=2402] This picture was in God's mind when he sent Christ into the world.
[time=2407] Christ came for his bride and died for her to display the way
[time=2413] marriage was meant to be.
[time=2415] See often times we don't connect marriage as frequently as we probably should to this issue of Christ and what he came and did.
[time=2424] We just celebrated a whole season a few weeks ago of what Christ came and did.
[time=2430] We just had the opportunity to see hundreds and hundreds of people come through this place who had seen a movie about what Christ did what he came to do and how he did it.
[time=2441] And in the midst of that rarely do we make this connection that in the mind of God before it all ever began.
[time=2447] He has this picture of Christ coming for his bride and dying for
[time=2453] her to display the way marriage was meant to be.
[time=2457] The point of the analogy is how Jesus loved her to the point of death and did not cast her away.
[time=2464] Piper goes on since this was in God's mind from the beginning.
[time=2468] It was also in Christ's mind when he faced death.
[time=2472] He knew that among the many effects of his suffering was this making the deepest meaning of marriage plain for all.
[time=2479] All of his sufferings were meant to be a message especially to husbands and here's the message.
[time=2486] This is how every husband should love his wife.
[time=2492] Now that paints a picture and here is a picture for you on the screen and guys this is not to dramatize it.
[time=2499] Guys this is not to somehow emotionalize it.
[time=2502] This is not to in any way do anything for you other than to
[time=2509] provide you a real picture.
[time=2513] I didn't say it.
[time=2515] I didn't extrapolate that this is what the Scripture says.
[time=2519] Your love for her is to look like.
[time=2523] Your willingness, your readiness to go down whatever road you need to go down, to give up whatever you would need to give up, to suffer whatever you might need to suffer.
[time=2537] To face whoever you might need to face.
[time=2541] To lay down your life as many times as you might need to lay it down for her because that's the way God designed it.
[time=2552] And that's the kind of love he called you to.
[time=2557] But rarely when we're talking to men about the way we love our wives do we sit and stare at a picture like that.
[time=2566] And you say to me well hey you know what I'm not Jesus.
[time=2569] Well join the crowd.
[time=2572] I'm not either.
[time=2574] And Jesus doesn't, well he addresses this.
[time=2577] Listen Piper continues.
[time=2580] Husbands are not Christ but they are called to be like him.
[time=2585] His specific point of likeness is the husband's readiness to sacrifice for his wife's good without threatening her, without manipulating her, without ignoring her, without neglecting her.
[time=2599] This includes suffering to protect her from any outside forces that would harm her as well as suffering disappointments or abuses even from her.
[time=2608] Guys the bottom line is that a God honoring wife honoring husband will be characterized by self-sacrificing love.
[time=2618] He loves that God honoring husband.
[time=2622] He loves, he loves her more.
[time=2626] And when I was a kid I don't know how old I was.
[time=2629] I was pretty young.
[time=2630] I was just thinking about it this morning.
[time=2632] I have these foggy memories of like really, I don't know about you but I can think back to really, really early days and my mom or my dad kind of leaning over my bed.
[time=2642] Maybe they'd be laying next to me at night or maybe we'd be in the car going somewhere.
[time=2646] And it's really silly I know but they'd say I love, you know, I love you or we love you and I'd say I love you.
[time=2652] And one of them would say well we love you more.
[time=2655] And I'd say no, no, I love you more.
[time=2657] You know and we'd be yelling back and forth from the, from the seat to the front seat, you know.
[time=2662] I love you more, no we love you more.
[time=2664] You know the God honoring husband, it's like he just kind of determines in his mind he's going to love her more.
[time=2673] He's going to love her more.
[time=2675] And you know what guys because you love her more, because you're that committed to her.
[time=2682] Because it means that much to you that you would honor God and honor her.
[time=2688] He works hard to grow that God honoring husband does.
[time=2691] He works hard to grow in his understanding.
[time=2694] This is all very related.
[time=2696] It's very hard to grow in his understanding of her.
[time=2700] Now you and I know that there's comedians out there on the circuit who make a living.
[time=2705] And we laugh at them a lot, you know.
[time=2707] All the jokes about how women, you know, you just can't, you can't understand them.
[time=2713] You know, they make no sense.
[time=2716] Air conditioning at seventy, I mean it's just, it's out there.
[time=2720] And we sometimes kind of buy into it and have a good laugh.
[time=2723] But we need to realize and be reminded this morning that that's an absolute lie.
[time=2728] And not only can they be understood, but God, but God commands
[time=2734] you as a man.
[time=2735] He calls you and I as husbands to understand them.
[time=2740] Look at 1 Peter.
[time=2741] Go back to the back of your New Testament.
[time=2744] Go to past 1 and 2 Thessalonians, 1 and 2 Timothy.
[time=2748] So you go back to 1 Peter, 1 Peter chapter 3.
[time=2753] We'll look at the first six verses in just a week or two,
[time=2760] as we talk to ladies' wives about God's design for you as a wife.
[time=2765] Today we come and look at 1 Peter 3-7 where it says, "You husbands, in the same way, live with your wives in an understanding way, as with someone weaker." Doesn't necessarily mean that you're weak.
[time=2782] I mean there is a physical fragility there that, you know, would be obvious in terms of the differences between men and women.
[time=2789] But again, as with, as with someone weaker, live with her in an understanding way, be gentle with her as you would with something that required gentleness.
[time=2802] In the way that you would deal with a piece of pottery, in the way that you would deal with a small infant, in the way that you would handle and talk to and deal with anything that required you to be, be that way, he says with her.
[time=2818] Live with her in an understanding way, gently, as with someone weaker
[time=2824] since she is a woman, and show her honor as a fellow heir,
[time=2831] spiritually quality right there as a fellow heir of the grace of life, so that your prayers will not be hindered.
[time=2839] You know what? You can, guys. You can understand her.
[time=2845] It is not impossible. It might take some time.
[time=2849] It might take a few questions.
[time=2852] I know there was a point in our life where I, you know, a line got drawn and a stake got put in the ground and I said, "Okay, I've caused a lot of heartache. I've caused a lot of hurt.
[time=2861] There's been a lot of damage done because of my unwillingness to understand." And so as we began to work at that together, I realized that in order to really understand and really connect with what was going on inside her mind and her heart, I realized quickly that I was probably going to have to ask some questions, that I was probably going to have to have her go back through some scenarios with me, that we were going to have to have some conversations where she would allow me the chance to kind of catch up, because granted, there are some things I just didn't get.
[time=2896] There were some things I just didn't know.
[time=2898] There are some things that as men we just don't readily connect with.
[time=2901] And I got to say this at this point, ladies, part of what has made it a healthy process, not a perfect process, but a healthier process for us, is that not only did I kind of draw a line and say, "I'm going to be a man who attempts to understand more clearly." She drew a line and said, "Okay, I'm giving up the ghost on this thing where I look at him and I just want him to understand without me saying anything." Does that make sense?
[time=2927] We just don't. We don't understand. We can understand, but we're going to need your help to understand.
[time=2935] And that takes time. You know what? Here's a point just to hang on to real quick today.
[time=2939] That process right there, saying issue comes up.
[time=2943] There's been some conflict, and I want to understand better so I can respond the way I should correct what I might need to correct.
[time=2952] For me to understand her, I realized going through this, that what was before a five-minute conversation that would usually end heated
[time=2961] would now need to be about a 20-minute conversation that might end in a healthy state.
[time=2967] By that means I'd have to give 15 more minutes.
[time=2973] And so many of us in this room today, we've got so many places to be, so many people to see, so many things to do.
[time=2981] Are you kidding me? 15 more minutes?
[time=2985] Sometimes it was a half hour. Sometimes we'd cancel stuff because we were in the process of understanding.
[time=2995] Because it meant a whole lot to her, and I realized as we went, it meant a whole lot to me.
[time=3002] And you know what? The more you understand, the more you will be willing to sacrifice.
[time=3009] Ephesians 5, 25, a God-honoring husband's sacrifices.
[time=3013] Hey guys, write a few things down.
[time=3016] Just food for thought. We can say that, but let me ask you this guy.
[time=3021] What? What are you going to sacrifice?
[time=3024] What is it that a God-honoring wife-honoring husband will periodically let go of in an effort to communicate, and evidence is real love for her?
[time=3036] What will you sacrifice? I just wrote a few things down.
[time=3041] There will be times when to honor God in her, you'll have opportunity to sacrifice fun or recreation of some kind.
[time=3054] It doesn't mean that you sacrifice it all the time.
[time=3057] It doesn't mean that the God-honoring husband, wife-honoring husband, never has fun and never recreates. No, I didn't say that.
[time=3065] There are times when you'll be given the opportunity to sacrifice some things.
[time=3070] For the sake of coming alongside, being with, talking to, helping, whatever the situation is calling for, loving your wife.
[time=3079] Sometimes they'll sacrifice fun or recreation. Sometimes they'll sacrifice free time.
[time=3084] Book reading, TV watching, hobbies that you go out and work on in the garage.
[time=3089] Sometimes that can be sacrificed. Put aside for the sake of, time spent with, time talking with, time understanding, time enjoying.
[time=3099] Her, loving her. Here's one. Income. Income.
[time=3104] Sometimes the God-honoring husband, wife-honoring husband will actually sacrifice cash.
[time=3109] What do I mean by that? Well, what I don't mean by that is that you would, in an effort to love your wife well, lose your job. No. No.
[time=3118] God wants you too. She wants you too. We all, everybody needs you to be a guy that works hard at his job and provides for his wife and family if you've got one. That's not what I mean.
[time=3131] What I mean though is this, you and I know that in the midst of providing for her, in the midst of going and earning a living, opportunities come for you to make more.
[time=3140] And sometimes those opportunities for you to make more are good opportunities.
[time=3145] God-honoring opportunities. And there's a way to engage yourself in those opportunities for more that doesn't violate her and/or them.
[time=3153] But many, many times the opportunity for you to engage in opportunities that might bring more do violate her and/or them.
[time=3165] And then the question becomes somebody to find providing for my family.
[time=3174] And are you willing to sacrifice fun and recreation, free time, income?
[time=3182] Here's one. Sleep. And we could spend a thousand different scenarios here.
[time=3187] I mean, it might be an infant in the home. It might be teenagers in the home.
[time=3192] I mean, it could even be later in life with opportunities that she's been given to maybe go and do.
[time=3197] Are you willing? Would you actually give up sleep?
[time=3201] I mean, this guy was killing me this morning. He stands up in his bathrobe, right?
[time=3206] And he says to her, you know, in the midst of all that was going on here, because I don't have the time for 20 questions.
[time=3219] You don't? Really? And you have the time for what?
[time=3230] What are you willing in that moment, in those different scenarios?
[time=3236] What are you willing to give up? And nobody's saying you have to give it all up.
[time=3241] We're just asking you again if the priority is such that she represents for you the greatest opportunity God's given you on this earth to love, care for, and come alongside.
[time=3253] In the pursuit of that, what will you periodically at times be willing to let go of?
[time=3258] Here's one more for you. Reputation. Reputation.
[time=3263] That's right. We were laughing about this the night because there were times so many times when it didn't go well at all.
[time=3272] It still creeps up, but we can laugh about it a little bit easier, at least at our house these days.
[time=3278] What I mean by reputation is this, there are times when, as guys, as men,
[time=3284] there are times when you have opportunities, guys, to go and do something, whatever it is you like to go and do.
[time=3291] Usually as men, we've got a couple, two or three guys we like to go and do that with, whatever that might be.
[time=3296] That might be a game that might be around a golf that might be some hot, could be a concert, could be anything.
[time=3301] And you know what? There isn't anything inherently wrong or evil about men getting together and going and having a good time.
[time=3307] It's okay. But what happens is that patterns are developed and the thought process is such as that
[time=3313] when sometimes the ask is made, the guys are flashing the tickets and they're saying, "Hey, come on, let's go."
[time=3319] You know, and if my wife were here, I mean, we could kind of role play this for you.
[time=3323] I could have like four guys down there with like four tickets and she could be here and I could be here and they could say, "Hey, come on, let's go." And I could go, "Whoa, how am I going to do this right here?
[time=3335] How's this going to work?" And see, sometimes we have fun with this.
[time=3340] And then sometimes it's really serious though, because there are times when, if I'm going to, because in my heart I felt like it was a really good move.
[time=3349] If in my heart I felt like all things considered, I probably should stick around this time
[time=3357] and make an investment of time and energy and effort and relationship.
[time=3364] If this time this really would be the most loving sacrificial thing I could do.
[time=3370] And I do it, sometimes what happens with the four guys down here waving the tickets,
[time=3376] they're going like, "What's wrong with you?" And see, we laugh like that.
[time=3382] But see, it's not really funny because there's nothing wrong with me.
[time=3390] And there are times when, again, especially if healthy patterns have been established here, there's times when I can think that through and say, "All right, I'll be right there." And come back and get a few things, you know, talk through.
[time=3403] And again, if healthy patterns are in place, this doesn't have to be ugly.
[time=3408] But so many times this is ugly here, because healthy patterns aren't in place.
[time=3412] And we're doing this kind of trying to be back and forth and, you know, "I'll go with them." And then you can go and do this, kind of, "I'll scratch your back." You know, and that's just not how marriage was designed.
[time=3425] But if I say, "I'm going to sit tight," often times the reputation, you know, "Oh, he's this," or "Oh, he's that," are you kind of knowing your mind that they might be thinking?
[time=3435] And my encouragement to every one of us as men trying to be God-honoring, trying to be wife-honoring men is, "Would you be willing to sacrifice?"
[time=3446] Maybe even reputation with some guys in an effort to lovingly, sacrificially, persistently and deeply come alongside and love your wife.
[time=3457] He sacrifices for her again and again and again and again.
[time=3464] And we'll get to point number two next week.
[time=3466] He spiritually shepherds his wife and his family.
[time=3470] Come back and join us for that discussion.
[time=3473] Stand and let's pray.
[time=3480] Father, we pray now that as we leave this place, God, that you would go with us.
[time=3484] God, that your Word and your Spirit and your people.
[time=3487] The Word of God, the Spirit of God and the people of God.
[time=3490] God, that we would avail ourselves, open ourselves to your work and our lives through those means.
[time=3496] God, we are so grateful for your Word and we pray, God, that even as we leave this place today that we'll stay engaged with your Word, as the days go by, as the hours go by, God, that we would be a people who would inundate ourselves,
[time=3510] our minds and our hearts with your truth.
[time=3513] Maybe even these truths, that this week we would read through and think through and contemplate these things that we've seen today again and again and again.
[time=3522] God, grow us please as husbands and bring us back together again soon.
[time=3529] If that be your will and your son's name, we pray. Amen.
