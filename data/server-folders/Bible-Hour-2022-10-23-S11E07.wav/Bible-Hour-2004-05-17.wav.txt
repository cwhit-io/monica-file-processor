[time=180] (dramatic music)
[time=210] (dramatic music) (dramatic music)
[time=300] (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (audience applauding) - Hi, I'm Mitch, and this is Kelly, and we just wanna thank you again for joining us and tuning in on the Bible Hour presentation of Black Hawk Ministries, where we just get to be part of what God's doing in people's lives, and we just love it.
[time=320] - Absolutely love it, and I love getting to do what I do.
[time=324] With this guy, it's an absolute blessing.
[time=326] He and Steve Longbreak, our other teaching pastor.
[time=329] It's quite a group that God's brought together, them and our entire team.
[time=334] A few weeks ago, many of you prayed for our whole staff, and I wanna thank you for doing that.
[time=339] In recent weeks of Black Hawk, we have embarked on an amazing journey, a series that we've entitled for better, for worse, and from what you're saying, from the things that we're hearing from you, it would seem as if God's designed for marriage and family, and our best attempts to try and communicate that, it seems like it's hit a good nerve, a lot of response, a lot of feedback, more tapes and CDs and DVDs going out than we've ever seen, and we're really thankful, because we really believe in God's design for marriage and family.
[time=371] What you're about to see is kind of a part two on the husband's role in this thing called marriage, and you know guys, God has designed it in such a way, and Ephesians five is where we'll go again to look at this design.
[time=385] He's designed it in a way whereby we can really honor him and really, really honor our wives in the way that we relate to them, and so our hope is that you'll continue to open your heart and be challenged by what you hear and what you see in the Word of God.
[time=403] - Yeah, we're gonna talk about how a husband can honor God and honor his wife, according to what Paul writes, as Kelly said, in Ephesians five, and I just feel like I should say, there ought to be this little scroll that goes along the bottom of the screen that says, warning the views that you're about to see and hear are those of God through the Bible and the Apostle Paul, and sometimes those two giving them, not lived out by the speakers, we're trying.
[time=433] - So we're in that boat with you and this is a message from two guys trying to live out the same faith with the same God, with a spouse that you are, and hope God ministers to you through this.
[time=447] - Yeah, and hey, about the sunglasses, about the sunglasses, we can't even begin to tell you what's going on right here.
[time=455] It's an absolute mystery, and you're gonna have to tune, stop bouncing so much.
[time=459] You're gonna have to tune in next week to see what all this is about, but I promise you, you will absolutely love it.
[time=465] So we'll see you next week, and God bless.
[time=467] - That's it, we're still here.
[time=469] (laughing) [MUSIC - 92 seconds]
[time=586] (gentle piano music) [MUSIC - 292 seconds]
[time=892] Worthy is the land, worthy is the land, worthy is the land, worthy is the land, worthy is the land.
[time=946] Oh God, thank you for loving me.
[time=954] When on the cross you may history, born you die for me forever.
[time=964] My praise will go to thee, O God.
[time=970] Thank you for choosing me to be your child and there your day.
[time=979] O Jesus, I will never cease to sing your prayer.
[time=989] How I have been, how I have been, how I have been, how I have been, how I have been.
[time=1032] Oh God, thank you for loving me.
[time=1037] When on the cross you may history, born you die for me forever.
[time=1047] My praise will go to thee, O God.
[time=1053] Thank you for choosing me to be your child and there your day.
[time=1063] O Jesus, I will never cease to sing your prayer.
[time=1072] Oh God, thank you for loving me.
[time=1080] When on the cross you may history, born you die for me forever.
[time=1089] My praise will go to thee, O God.
[time=1095] For choosing me to be your child and there your day.
[time=1104] O Jesus, I will never cease to sing your prayer.
[time=1112] Thank you for loving me.
[time=1117] Thank you for loving me, thank you for loving me.
[time=1143] Thank you for loving me.
[time=1153] Hey welcome back to the ongoing study that we began a couple weeks ago for Better for Worse.
[time=1160] God's designed for marriage and family and last week just having the opportunity to start talking about the differences between men and women.
[time=1170] We've got some real comedians in our midst. I've got a number of emails I chose a couple just to share with you this morning on the differences between men and women.
[time=1179] Here's a control panel.
[time=1182] Oh my goodness, there's a control panel.
[time=1188] Hey ladies, that's a compliment, all right.
[time=1191] We are celebrating your diversity, we are celebrating the unique and wonderful way that God made you.
[time=1198] Look how much time he spent.
[time=1200] I mean with us it's pretty simple.
[time=1203] Oh my goodness, it's just classic.
[time=1206] Same guy sent in another one.
[time=1208] Mission, go to Gap by a pair of pants.
[time=1211] The blue line is the male.
[time=1213] The blue line is the male's journey to buy the pair of pants.
[time=1219] And the male, it takes a total of six minutes and it cost him 33 bucks.
[time=1225] Yeah.
[time=1228] Oh, don't raise your hands, that's not you.
[time=1230] You would go.
[time=1232] You know, no.
[time=1234] Don't even get me going on you.
[time=1236] The gals, they would go more than red line to get to the Gap for a total of three hours and 26 minutes and $876.
[time=1249] Oh, one gal wrote in this week.
[time=1251] Hey, on the whole guys' rules, she wrote some ladies' rules.
[time=1254] Hey, shopping is to a sport, Kelly.
[time=1257] And not only is it a sport but a competitive one at that.
[time=1260] This means if we come home and have spent $200 but bought $400 worth of stuff,
[time=1266] we have excelled in our favorite sport and you need to share in our victory.
[time=1272] Ladies, do I hear an amen?
[time=1275] She writes down, "Sometimes we don't expect you to understand or give us advice.
[time=1281] We just want you to listen, understand, give advice, listen.
[time=1285] Other times we expect you to do all three.
[time=1287] Please figure out before we start talking which of these it is and respond accordingly."
[time=1293] What do you think, ladies?
[time=1296] I think it would help if she told us which one.
[time=1298] I know it would help, it would be very helpful.
[time=1300] But we're supposed to understand these things.
[time=1302] I like this one she wrote in.
[time=1303] We needed help, guys.
[time=1305] We needed help in conceiving the kids and we sure need help raising them.
[time=1309] FYI, go ask your mom is not helpful.
[time=1315] Well, anyway, a lot of fun but a lot of serious discussion as well.
[time=1322] As we began to look at this issue of husbands that honor God and honor their wives,
[time=1328] we were taken to a text in Ephesians 5 and Mitch is going to remind us of what that said
[time=1335] and then just review real briefly for us where we were last week in point number one.
[time=1341] And in honor of God's word, would you stand?
[time=1343] Thank you very much.
[time=1349] Ephesians 5, 25 says, "Husbands, love your wives.
[time=1354] Justice Christ also loved the church and gave himself up for her.
[time=1359] That he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word.
[time=1365] That he might present himself the church in all her glory having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing,
[time=1372] but that she should be holy and blameless." So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies.
[time=1382] He loves his own wife, loves himself for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes
[time=1389] and cherishes it.
[time=1391] Justice Christ also does the church because we are members of his body.
[time=1398] For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife,
[time=1404] and the two shall become one flesh.
[time=1408] Let's pray.
[time=1410] God, I just pray that it may be so in this place.
[time=1414] We may be salt and we may be light to a lost and hurting world.
[time=1418] And God, I just pray that you'll touch the heart of every single person here to be more like you.
[time=1425] In Jesus' mighty name we pray.
[time=1428] [AMEN] May be seated.
[time=1432] And Kelly kicked us off last week by telling us that a husband, a God-outering husband,
[time=1441] honors God and his wife by sacrificing for his wife.
[time=1447] And he gave us a picture, a picture that was embedded in the minds of men because I ran into a lot of conversations about that last week of Jesus on the cross depicted from the
[time=1459] movie The Passion.
[time=1461] And that's it.
[time=1462] That's the image.
[time=1464] Everything we say today will flow from that because it flows from him.
[time=1470] And it's the humility of God in Christ that we as husbands and as men are designed to bring
[time=1479] into the home and into the marriage to reveal who God is to our wives like that,
[time=1487] who Jesus Christ is to our wives in our marriage.
[time=1493] And so today we're going to, everything flows from that.
[time=1497] And Kelly's going to kick us off with point two.
[time=1501] So not only does the God-honoring wife-honoring husband sacrifice for his wife,
[time=1507] willing to do whatever he has to do, go wherever he has to go, give up whatever he may have to give up in order to extend love toward her.
[time=1516] And only does he sacrifice for his wife.
[time=1519] He spiritually shepherds her.
[time=1523] God's words is very clear.
[time=1525] Look with me at Ephesians 5.
[time=1527] It says there in verse 26 so that he might, 25 says, "Love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her so that he might sanctify her." That word of the Greek means to spiritually set apart to spiritually be the agent of
[time=1544] both.
[time=1545] We understand the spirit of God is what grows us.
[time=1547] The God-honoring wife-honoring husband is willing to be used of God in that endeavor to spiritually grow, encourage, and nurture his wife so that he might
[time=1559] sanctify her having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word.
[time=1565] Hey, husbands, God's word is really clear to you and me this morning.
[time=1570] We are held responsible by God for not only the spiritual climate of our homes,
[time=1576] but the spiritual health of our wives.
[time=1579] We are to lovingly lead and spiritually shepherd them.
[time=1585] Well, how?
[time=1587] Let's just cut to the chase.
[time=1589] And it's important that we kind of just bring some flesh to this principle because oftentimes when we stand here or you hear others talking about spiritually leading your wife, a lot of times, guys just go way off the deep end on that.
[time=1604] They begin to picture podiums and lecterns in the kitchen and bibles opened and kids with notebooks and wives saying, "Please, could you repeat that point again?" No.
[time=1615] That is not what this is about essentially.
[time=1619] Essentially, guys, this is about you coming alongside your wife and encouraging
[time=1625] her spiritually as the one who by God has been given the responsibility to do so.
[time=1631] Some questions for you.
[time=1633] Guys, are you the one in the home making sure that you as a couple are a part of a Bible study on a regular basis?
[time=1643] Are you as her spiritual shepherd and the one who carries that privileged opportunity?
[time=1649] Are you the one, guys, that is making sure that you as a couple are involved in a class or a home group where she and you together are receiving instruction in the word of God?
[time=1660] You know, every week out here in the foyer and even online, constantly, you can pick up what's known as our small group curriculum, Bob Purdy, one of our pastors.
[time=1669] Every week provides a series of discussion questions that is kind of aimed at small
[time=1675] groups, but you could as a husband with your wife kind of in a sense have your own little small, you could pick up that sheet of paper every Sunday.
[time=1684] The questions are designed to kind of relate to that week's message, and it gives you a chance for some further study and some further dialogue and some further Q and A on what was discussed that morning.
[time=1697] Guys, you could take that home three, four times a week at night before bed say, "Hey, can we spend some time going through our questions tonight?"
[time=1710] Are you willing most nights, maybe every, but are you willing most nights to
[time=1717] pray with, and let me ask it this way.
[time=1719] Guys, husbands in the room, are you willing most nights to pray with your kids if you have them?
[time=1724] Would you raise your hands?
[time=1725] Guys, if you're willing to pray with your kids, raise your hand.
[time=1728] Real high, real high.
[time=1730] Hands down, and I won't have you raise them again on this next one, but are you willing to pray then maybe a half hour, hour later or so?
[time=1738] Are you willing to pray with her?
[time=1744] We do a real disconnect there.
[time=1749] We will pray to the cows come home with Jimmy, Sally, and Becky, you know,
[time=1755] but when it comes to her and the two of us in that room and a five, ten,
[time=1762] fifteen minute time where, you know what?
[time=1764] Again, sometimes we go places with that picture of praying with my wife.
[time=1768] You know, I've learned even just in recent years.
[time=1771] Mitch has learned some things and has shared it with me and others.
[time=1774] I mean, we're just talking about you looking at her in the ice and saying, "How was your day?" Guys, can you say that?
[time=1783] How was your day?
[time=1787] And then she gets a chance to tell you about her day.
[time=1792] The good, the bad, the ugly, the fun, the interesting.
[time=1798] Oh, she'll tell you.
[time=1800] That's how -- and that wasn't meant to be a joke.
[time=1802] I'm sorry.
[time=1803] That's how they're wired.
[time=1805] And you're willing this in mind.
[time=1807] Wow, we're stepping out here.
[time=1808] How was your day?
[time=1812] Well, here's one.
[time=1813] Maybe five minutes later after she tells you about her day and in telling you about her day, you begin to realize there's some things you could pray for.
[time=1820] Hey, what do you got coming tomorrow?
[time=1824] Can you say that?
[time=1825] What do you have coming tomorrow?
[time=1827] How was your day?
[time=1828] What do you have coming tomorrow?
[time=1830] Let's pray.
[time=1833] This is not real heady stuff, guys.
[time=1836] But it's meaningful.
[time=1839] Really, really meaningful.
[time=1841] Can I just see a show of hands from women if that sounds good to you?
[time=1846] That sounds nice.
[time=1847] Raise your hand if you would like that.
[time=1848] Raise your hands high so you can see.
[time=1851] Yeah.
[time=1852] Okay.
[time=1853] Yeah.
[time=1854] Sounds great.
[time=1855] I know.
[time=1856] A lot of times one of the things we hear, one of the things I hear from my own wife, a lot of times the things I hear from couples who are just working their way through crisis is so many times she feels so misunderstood or sometimes she just feels detached.
[time=1872] He doesn't know what's going on in my life, she'll say.
[time=1877] Mitch pointed this out this week.
[time=1879] Would you know more about her?
[time=1885] If each night you asked her, how was your day?
[time=1890] What do you got coming tomorrow?
[time=1893] How can I pray?
[time=1895] Wow.
[time=1896] It's like really, really simple but really, really profound.
[time=1902] Husbands, who made sure you got here this morning?
[time=1905] I mean, really.
[time=1906] Who was the energy behind the morning?
[time=1908] Who was the one that really, and who was the one that consistently makes sure that you're
[time=1914] going to be here fulfilling Hebrews 10, 24, and 25?
[time=1918] Who's the one in your marriage that brings the most energy and effort to making sure that
[time=1924] you guys are here with the family of God and the Word of God and the Spirit of God?
[time=1931] We mentioned last hour, one of the greatest spiritual gifts guys that you can bring to your marriage.
[time=1937] One of the ways that you can spiritually lead the most is to, and I was talking with a
[time=1943] gal this week who pointed this out to me.
[time=1945] He said one of the greatest gifts her husband gives her spiritually is his own walk with
[time=1951] the Lord.
[time=1953] Guys, are you intimately and consistently and faithfully and passionately pursuing him?
[time=1960] Because when you do, it encourages her.
[time=1963] It gives her a sense of trust.
[time=1970] We loveingly lead her, sacrificially give ourselves to her, spiritually invest and shepherd her.
[time=1978] And just so we're all clear, there's a phrase for that.
[time=1982] Look back in our text, go to Ephesians 5, just go up a couple verses, wives, verse 22, wives, be subject to your own husbands.
[time=1990] Note in verse 21, it says be subject to each other.
[time=1994] There's a mutual submission we share as Christ followers.
[time=1997] As it works itself out in this relationship, wives, be subject to your own husbands.
[time=2002] As to the Lord, for the husband is the head of the wife.
[time=2007] It's called a headship.
[time=2009] For the husband is the head of the wife.
[time=2012] As Christ also is the head of the church, he himself being the savior of the body.
[time=2018] And I want to just make sure, see, headship gets a bad rap.
[time=2021] The phrase itself gets so misconstrued.
[time=2025] And headship kind of gets painted as this domineering, controlling thing.
[time=2029] Ladies, be reminded, guys as well, what we've been describing so far.
[time=2034] This man who would go to the wall for you, this guy who would sacrifice anything and everything for you.
[time=2040] This guy who would be willing to be your spiritual, safe place, your harbor, your shepherd, the one who watches out for you.
[time=2048] That's called headship and you all just three minutes ago raised your hands really, really quick.
[time=2056] Because you really, really know down deep inside, that's what you long for.
[time=2061] And that's headship.
[time=2063] And that's a good thing, guys, because we're supposed to be like him.
[time=2068] Loving, gentle, kind, purposeful, sacrificial, spiritually shepherding.
[time=2073] What did you say first hour about the word head, headship in the text?
[time=2078] The word heads also used for source of a river.
[time=2082] And so this concept is not hierarchical, but it's being the source of Christ in my marriage to my wife,
[time=2089] to being the source of his sacrifice, the source of his shepherding, the source of his humility, the source of Christ in my relationship with my wife.
[time=2098] It's more on my knees and less or none of Lording it over.
[time=2103] It's a great picture.
[time=2105] Guys, husbands, a God-honoring husband sacrifices for his wife spiritually shepherds his wife.
[time=2114] And thirdly, as the text, as the passage progresses, we see that he protects his wife from sin.
[time=2122] If you read verse 27, it says that he might present to himself the church in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing,
[time=2132] but that she should be holy and blameless.
[time=2135] All Christ's work for the church to be holy and blameless, we learn that in verse 4.
[time=2140] We've got to remember the context of everything that's said up into this point in the letter, and this is Christ's work.
[time=2147] And so once again, Paul's saying be like Christ husbands with your wives in your marriages.
[time=2154] Be like him, and I'm going to give you some do's and some don'ts.
[time=2159] And the do is embrace her sin struggles as your own.
[time=2165] Embrace her sin struggles as your own.
[time=2169] Christ took my sin and your sin and paid for it fully.
[time=2174] But we have a tendency in our marriages that when there's a little sin or there's a little anger and there's a little tension, but also we want to separate it and say well look at you, that's your problem.
[time=2183] No, no, no, no, no, no. The two have come together and have become one flesh.
[time=2187] That's your problem husband.
[time=2189] Embrace it as your own.
[time=2191] Now don't do this, don't try to fix it.
[time=2195] So here's what happens.
[time=2196] Her tone gets a little louder and she's getting a little sharper and she's not saying fix me.
[time=2203] She's saying feel what I feel.
[time=2207] So I'm going to write that down, feel not fix.
[time=2211] And so when that happens you want to kind of resist the temptation of what we're going to talk about next,
[time=2218] to provoke her to sin, and you just want to kind of hit the pause button on what's going on inside of you
[time=2224] and allow the Holy Spirit to take control of you and you want to say I understand how you feel.
[time=2232] Maybe grab her hand.
[time=2234] Or maybe say I don't understand how you feel, tell me.
[time=2237] But you want to feel what she's feeling, that's what she wants, not fix her.
[time=2243] And then finally don't, don't provoke her to sin.
[time=2247] Oh you can't embrace her sin struggle by the way unless you have relational proximity.
[time=2253] And that doesn't mean so much geographic proximity, that's a heart connection.
[time=2259] Are you intimate with her? Have you done these first two things that we've looked at in the four points?
[time=2265] So don't provoke her to sin.
[time=2268] And I'm going to tell you three things, not to do, to provoke her to sin.
[time=2273] I'm going to give you three antidotes for each one of those.
[time=2276] And it's going to be CBA, Continental Basketball Association like the Fort Wayne Fury was.
[time=2281] CBA, all right, and the first thing not to do, to not provoke her to sin, don't be critical.
[time=2291] Don't provoke her to sin by being critical.
[time=2293] See guys, her sin, her temptation to sin is usually based on us.
[time=2300] How we're handling the relationship or not handling the relationship.
[time=2304] And so we have a tendency when the tone gets up, we want to be critical.
[time=2309] Susan and I were discussing about whether or not and where to put this mirror in our new house about seven years ago.
[time=2318] And Susan had gotten a designer, was very talented, involved in where that mirror should go and what that mirror should look like.
[time=2325] And Susan got that designer involved in all of our house because she had admitted that that wasn't something she was good at.
[time=2331] But now all of a sudden, in the foyer of our home, she has an opinion on where the mirror should go and how it should look.
[time=2337] And I wanted to articulate to her something like this, you are not a designer, you told me that, and you're not really into decorating.
[time=2348] And now all of a sudden you have an opinion on where it should go and what it should look like, but how it should hang and how they should hang it.
[time=2355] I wanted to say that.
[time=2357] And instead, I said something to the effect of that included the word "stupid."
[time=2366] Directed towards her.
[time=2370] And what I was doing was being critical.
[time=2374] But here's what we should do.
[time=2376] We should take that thought and give it to the spirit of God that Paul has written all through this letter up to this point, who is at work in me.
[time=2385] And I take that critical thought and I take that critical spirit and I give it to him.
[time=2391] And then it only takes a few seconds.
[time=2394] And then instead of being critical, write this C word down, the antidote.
[time=2398] I'm complimentary.
[time=2400] See, here's the deal.
[time=2401] I'm complimentary.
[time=2402] Look just over the page on Ephesians 4, 26, and 27.
[time=2409] Be angry, you're going to get angry with your spouse, but don't sin.
[time=2414] Don't be critical.
[time=2416] Don't let the sun go down on your anger.
[time=2418] And listen to this, verse 27, "Do not give the devil an opportunity or a foothold.
[time=2425] Do not provoke her to sin by being critical.
[time=2429] Be complimentary." And he goes on, look at verse 29, "Let no unwholesome talk come out of your mouth, but only that which is good for building up others according to their needs in Christ Jesus."
[time=2446] Their story, connecting to His story, that's the basis.
[time=2457] I ask my girls all the time, if wholesome talk is building up someone else's needs in Christ, what would unwholesome talk be?
[time=2465] Bringing them down, being critical.
[time=2469] Don't do it.
[time=2470] Don't provoke your wife to sin by being critical.
[time=2478] Don't wait 10 minutes, 10 days, 10 months, 10 years.
[time=2482] Forgive her instantly in the anger.
[time=2486] Give it to the Holy Spirit.
[time=2487] Let him transform it from critical to being complimentary.
[time=2491] Second, the "be" is don't provoke her to sin by being busy, being busy.
[time=2497] Many of you husbands were out there being busy doing really good things.
[time=2502] Some are kingdom building things.
[time=2504] Sometimes it's just a career where I want to make some money and move up the corporate ladder and get better and better.
[time=2508] And I remember where I was.
[time=2509] I was sitting at my desk and I knew that I could be there.
[time=2513] It kind of came to this point in my life where I knew, you know what?
[time=2516] I could sit here all the time.
[time=2518] When I leave, I still have stuff to do.
[time=2520] I can do another deal, develop another strategy.
[time=2524] Then I realized, "You know what? I could be gone all the time." And I went through a season where I practically did this.
[time=2529] I could be literally gone all the time because there's always another deal.
[time=2535] And I felt convicted by the Spirit of God and I said, "God, I don't think you want me to do this to my wife and my child at that time that I have neglected."
[time=2546] And I realized that by being busy, I was robbing myself of the antidote and that is believe in God.
[time=2554] Write that down.
[time=2555] Believe in God.
[time=2556] See, I can trust God and you can trust God that if you love and honor your wife, he will love and honor you in your career.
[time=2565] There's a direct correlation.
[time=2567] There's a relationship with your wife to the performance and the character in your career.
[time=2572] Proverbs 23, 4 and 5, you want to write it down.
[time=2575] Proverbs 23, 4 and 5 says, "You know what? Don't wear yourself out trying to get rich.
[time=2581] Money gets wings and it flies away anyway.
[time=2585] Don't do it.
[time=2587] Believe in God." Now I realize that Susan in the busyness of life likes it when I call her.
[time=2594] I didn't know that until recently because she's kind of task oriented.
[time=2598] I got things to do during the day, but I found out that she likes me calling her during the day.
[time=2602] It's not a big deal, but just calling her.
[time=2604] I let her know I'm thinking about her.
[time=2605] Very simple.
[time=2606] You might want to do it.
[time=2607] And then the "A" is don't want to provoke her to sin not by being critical, but be complimentary.
[time=2612] Not only by being busy, but believing in God, trusting him in your career.
[time=2617] But by being absent, absent.
[time=2621] This is more of an emotional absence.
[time=2625] Josh McDowell says that kids and wives, the toughest thing they have to deal with, isn't when you're absent from the home, but it's when you're in the home and you're absent emotionally.
[time=2636] They don't know how to deal with that.
[time=2638] That's terrible.
[time=2639] This doesn't work.
[time=2640] It's not God's design.
[time=2641] Instead, we need to be available.
[time=2644] Write it down.
[time=2645] Available.
[time=2647] I thought I believed this until the three years where I got my master's in doctorate and was available to my wife and my children and other people, and now I will fight for that.
[time=2657] It has radically changed my life.
[time=2659] Availability to your wife and to your children.
[time=2663] And I found out, as I looked at this, I said, "You know what?
[time=2667] Don't be critical.
[time=2668] Don't provoke her to sin by being critical.
[time=2670] Be complimentary of her.
[time=2671] Use the Holy Spirit's power.
[time=2673] Don't provoke her to sin by being busy.
[time=2675] Believe in God.
[time=2676] Don't provoke her to sin by being absent.
[time=2679] Be available.
[time=2681] You know what the deal is there?
[time=2682] The tension is, is it going to be about me or is it going to be about God and others?
[time=2685] Am I going to be selfish or am I going to be selfless?
[time=2687] Am I going to be like Christ or am I going to be like my fallenness?" Because that's not real.
[time=2692] Again, that's a great point and that's not real hard to figure out, guys.
[time=2696] It's really pretty easy for us as men, as husbands.
[time=2702] If we just look at that list, he just took you through.
[time=2704] Why are we critical?
[time=2706] Why do we choose to get so busy?
[time=2708] Why in the end do we choose to be absent?
[time=2710] Because marriage is work at times.
[time=2717] Parenting is work at times because loving another fallen human being and them loving us and this whole selfless agape thing that God's called us to.
[time=2728] It's work.
[time=2729] It's a challenge.
[time=2730] It's a challenge and it's work that brings great joy.
[time=2733] That's true.
[time=2734] But when we go over here and can find this or that when we come over here and can be filled up with this or that, I mean all of a sudden when you look, why is a guy critical, busy and absent?
[time=2744] Because he's over here taking care of himself.
[time=2749] And that, as Mitch started out today, in the picture of Christ on the screen, that is the absolute antithesis.
[time=2755] It's the absolute opposite of what we're called to.
[time=2761] God honoring husband sacrifices for his wife.
[time=2765] He spiritually shepherds his wife.
[time=2768] He protects his wife from sin.
[time=2770] And then write this one down.
[time=2772] That God honoring husband nourishes his wife faithfully.
[time=2775] He nourishes his wife faithfully.
[time=2779] It's an interesting and very, very important word, this concept of nourishing.
[time=2784] Go back to Ephesians 5.
[time=2786] It says there in 29.
[time=2790] For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it.
[time=2796] Just as Christ also does the church.
[time=2799] Christ nourishes and cherishes his bride.
[time=2804] Guys, we are to as well.
[time=2806] The word nourish, you can write this down.
[time=2808] It means to offer paternal involvement.
[time=2811] That's right, paternal involvement. To give the proper attention and feeding.
[time=2816] To supply anything and everything needed internally.
[time=2820] This word nourish husbands.
[time=2822] This has to do with our willingness to come alongside her and offer her things that she needs internally.
[time=2829] Cherish.
[time=2830] The next word, Mitch, will get to that.
[time=2832] That has more of an external emphasis.
[time=2834] To nourish is to offer involvement.
[time=2836] To give the proper attention and feeding. To supply anything and everything needed internally for her heart's growth and health.
[time=2846] Now the paternal thing there, it's a very interesting Greek word.
[time=2849] And the best we could kind of come up as we talked about this was kind of just a picture of this.
[time=2854] And I'll speak for myself and if you can relate, fine, I bet most of you can.
[time=2859] When Jake comes screaming into the house from outside crying his eyes out.
[time=2871] Just an absolute blubbering mess.
[time=2874] Something horrible has happened.
[time=2876] And the tears are streaming down his cheeks and he's sprinting down our hallway.
[time=2881] And all he wants to do is know where I am so he can find me and tell me what happened.
[time=2886] When that scene unfolds, I'll tell you what?
[time=2890] Because of the paternal nourishing thing that God's placed in me as a dad, I cannot wait.
[time=2898] I mean, I hear it and I try to get out of what I'm doing and I'll catch his eyes as he's coming down the hallway.
[time=2903] And oftentimes I'll just kind of slide in there, right?
[time=2907] Right there.
[time=2908] Dude, what happened?
[time=2910] And he'll stand there right in front of me and he'll put his hands on my shoulders and say, "Dad, you don't believe what have you did to me.
[time=2918] You don't know or something." [laughter] But he just...
[time=2923] See this?
[time=2925] What can I do?
[time=2927] How can I help?
[time=2929] Did she really?
[time=2931] Oh my goodness.
[time=2932] Come here and hug.
[time=2934] Now what are we going to do?
[time=2935] You know, maybe it's a bruised knee and I wipe it off with some.
[time=2939] See this right here?
[time=2942] But I'll tell you what?
[time=2945] Your wife or mine comes home from a really, really, really hard day or a really, really challenging interaction with maybe a real difficult friend or something's gone south in her world.
[time=2962] And she comes into our bedroom or she comes into yours, you know, and begins to kind of unload that?
[time=2974] Is that us?
[time=2979] Boy, not often enough.
[time=2981] I'll speak for me.
[time=2984] I'll do this with a four-year-old, but when my wife has a need, when she's confused, when she's hurting, when she's upset and I know this could end up, you know, this could be another half hour or so.
[time=2999] What's your posture?
[time=3002] And are you willingly ready to offer this nourishing?
[time=3007] I'll be here for you. We can talk this through. I'm not going to fix you. I'm going to listen.
[time=3015] Internally, lovingly, being able to get on your knees, roll up your sleeves and say, "How can I help?"
[time=3022] God honoring husbands nourish their wives. They also cherish.
[time=3026] Nourish is external, as Kelly said. Cherish is -- I mean, internal. Cherish is external. Literally means to warm.
[time=3034] So, Craig and Sarah, could you come up here, please?
[time=3038] And here we go. I got an illustration here. Cherish means literally to warm.
[time=3044] To warm her body, it's an external concept, but it's bigger than that. Craig, you want to hold that?
[time=3052] Wow. And you want to put that on, Sarah? And there's this concept, it's in Romans 13, 14, about putting on Christ.
[time=3061] Clothing yourself with Christ. It says in Colossians 3, 14, to put on or clothe yourself with love.
[time=3071] And here's what I want -- can you kind of like get behind her like you put it on her there? Okay.
[time=3075] So, this is what we're called to do, to cherish is to put Christ on her, to value her, to warm her body with love, with Christ.
[time=3086] And I like to think of it this way. What we talked about kind of all the way up until this point is sort of an intimate -- in our home kind of a thing.
[time=3094] But what about when we're in public? What about when others are around? How do we treat our wives?
[time=3098] Man, don't ever make the mistake of being critical toward her in public, but put Christ on her, put on her love, warm her life with Christ.
[time=3111] A wise man told me one time, if whenever you share a negative with your wife and she can't handle it, it's emotionally devastating to her.
[time=3120] It's because you've never really nurtured her and cherished her and warmed her by clothing her with words of affirming love in Christ, clothing her with Christ, clothing her with love in word and indeed in this heart connection we've talked about.
[time=3137] And write this down, Proverbs 31, 10, says an excellent wife who can find. She is -- this is a valuable coat. She's much more valuable than anything.
[time=3153] And this coat, it says jewels. She's more valuable than anything. That's what we're designed to do, to cherish her wife, to put that value, to warm her by clothing her with Christ.
[time=3167] And we want to make her men our number one earthly pursuit, because that's what's best for our kids. This is the illustration most used in the Bible for the kingdom of God is marriage because it's all about intimacy.
[time=3180] Intimacy with God in Christ that I bring to her and clothe her with that by cherishing her in the relationship. Thanks, guys. Let's give him a hand for helping us out.
[time=3190] Oh, the coat, the coat.
[time=3197] Yeah. Hey, Corb. What I'd like to do is we've been convicted. Holy Spirit prompted both Kelly and me, and we'd just like to invite you if you're a husband.
[time=3210] Could you please just come forward? We want to close today by praying with you. If you're a husband or you're about to be a husband and you're engaged and we just want every single one of you to just come down here, we're going to pray with you because we think that this is really
[time=3225] just right down here. Come on down close, guys. Where the rubber meets the road, if we're not going to humble ourselves and pray together publicly here, how do we expect that we're going to live in our homes and our cars and in our careers, wherever we go with our wife?
[time=3240] We just want to ask God by His Spirit to work in us, just keep coming in to reveal who He is through us, to our wives, because if we don't do it there, it's just for not.
[time=3258] So keep coming. If you're a husband, if you're engaged, if you're going to be a husband, come up here, guys.
[time=3264] We want to take this time just to ask God through His Holy Spirit, through His power, to be Christ in us and through us. Just keep coming.
[time=3275] What a great sight, huh? Hey, guys, as you're standing down here, just look around, would you? Just look at the guy next to you and look at the guy behind you.
[time=3284] And just realize, I was reading this week studying for this continued family series, you realize that culture is disintegrating before our eyes.
[time=3295] And biblically, as we study the way God intended this all to work, so much of that destruction is due to the destruction and demise of the family.
[time=3305] When the family goes, when the family disintegrates, when the family falls apart, showed us culture.
[time=3313] And God's Word says to you men standing right here, that those families, and especially those wives that He has given you, are yours to love, to care for, to walk beside, to sacrifice for.
[time=3327] Hey, if you would, guys, just bow your heads. Maybe put your hand on the back of one nearby, and let's just together, shall we? Can we just together hold each other up?
[time=3339] And ladies, I would just invite you from where you're sitting. I know this is quite a sight, and I know it must in some ways encourage you.
[time=3346] Others of you I know are sitting there in the midst of maybe difficult times. Maybe you're still kind of holding out a little hope, maybe you've given up.
[time=3360] But we know that through the power of God's Word, through the power of God's Spirit, men can be changed.
[time=3371] I'm an example of that. And there are men here standing on this stage, and they can be changed. God can grow them into the men, husbands and fathers that He called them to be.
[time=3384] And so, God, we know you hear our prayers, and we know that this morning as we gather here as men, husbands, wanting to love our wives more meaningfully.
[time=3396] We know, God, that the ability and strength to do that is only found in you. And so, we humble ourselves publicly and, more importantly, God privately, in the depths of our souls, we say to you again, "God, I want to love my wife, and I want to love her well, and I want to love her faithfully.
[time=3416] And God, would you please help me? Would you send the right people at just the right time? God, in just the right way to continue to encourage me and grow me?
[time=3426] Am I understanding not only of you, but of her? And God allow my sacrificial efforts to be more faithful? God allow my shepherding to be more purposeful?
[time=3437] God allow my willingness to stand in the gap and protect her from the evil, and God give that effort strength, and would you give me wisdom to know how to nourish and cherish her in a way that lifts her up and doesn't tear her down?
[time=3457] God, I pray for these men. Mitch, why don't you close us?
[time=3467] And now, God, may we just reveal who you are to our wives, not being critical but being complimentary, not being too busy but believing in you, not being absent but being available.
[time=3486] As we sacrifice, as we shepherd, as we protect our wives from sin, and as we nourish and cherish, we love you, God, and we thank you for who you are.
[time=3499] May it be so, in this place, in these hearts. And I pray for the wives, God, I pray for them to just be clay in your hands as well, to go alongside and to be an encouraging partner in this process,
[time=3515] not to lord it over, not to say, "Hey, you didn't do that so well today," but in a loving way to communicate clearly and to be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to become angry.
[time=3527] In Jesus' mighty name, we pray these things, and all God's people said. Amen.
[time=3545] [BLANK_AUDIO]
