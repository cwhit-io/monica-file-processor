[time=30] (upbeat music)
[time=60] (upbeat music) - This morning we are going to focus our time
[time=84] in a very unique special way on the person of God, on who He is.
[time=93] And He says many, many things about Himself in His Word.
[time=97] I'd like to take just a moment to read you one.
[time=102] And this is from the book of Isaiah.
[time=104] He says, "Thus says God the Lord, who created the heavens and stretched them out, who spread out the earth and its offspring, who gives breath to the people on it and spirit to those who walk in it.
[time=122] I am the Lord, I have called you in righteousness.
[time=125] I will also hold you by the hand and watch over you.
[time=130] I will appoint you as a covenant to the people, as a light to the nations, to open blind eyes, to bring out prisoners from the dungeon, and those who dwell in darkness from the prison.
[time=142] I am the Lord, that is my name.
[time=145] I will not give my glory to another, nor my praise to graven images.
[time=151] Behold, the former things have come to pass.
[time=155] Now I declare new things.
[time=159] Before they spring forth, I proclaim them to you." And we've invited Barb Imer, a regular tender here, part of the Blackhawk family who's a gifted writer and who uses that gift for God's glory to come and share something with you.
[time=178] Give your attention to Barb now, if you would.
[time=180] - Thank you, Bob.
[time=182] I've just been asked to briefly address the topic, what has God been saying to me?
[time=186] And sometimes you go through dry periods in your life where God doesn't seem to be speaking very much, but lately God's been real talkative and he's been sharing quite a few things, so I'm just gonna narrow it down and share a couple of those with you.
[time=198] God's saying, I am everything.
[time=200] You are a flower quickly fading to quote a popular Christian song right now.
[time=205] But I love you anyway with an everlasting love.
[time=208] God's saying, the verse in Romans eight about working all things together for good, for those who are loved and called according to his purpose, he's saying, I meant that.
[time=218] But he's also saying that the working together for good can be incredibly painful in my life and in your life.
[time=226] So just hang in there.
[time=227] God's saying, I love you, even when you don't feel it, even when God seems a million miles away, he's there, his love is eternal and constant.
[time=238] And this past month I was helping over at the grade school and a verse popped into my head.
[time=242] You know how sometimes you'll just kind of get this insight and I didn't know where it was and I looked it up and it's from Job 13.
[time=249] And Job is speaking to, I think his friends at the time and he's saying, even though he slays me, yet I will trust him.
[time=257] And God has me that, even if I slay you, will you trust me?
[time=260] And I'm not sure what that slang is all about.
[time=262] I'm not sure I want to dove too deeply into that, but basically he's just saying, am I trustworthy, Barb?
[time=267] And I thought about it and he is because God is good all the time, as we say.
[time=273] And he's also always in control.
[time=275] So if I really believe those two things about him, then I can trust him.
[time=279] I'm not saying that I've perfected that yet, but I'm saying that as I grow closer to him and understand his character more, that trust becomes more permanent.
[time=289] And I guess I'd just like to ask you today, what is God saying to you?
[time=292] - And that's the question we want to ask this morning.
[time=299] God is a God who is the same yesterday today in forever.
[time=302] But at the same time, he reveals parts of himself to us throughout our lifetime.
[time=309] And it's almost like a new discovery each time.
[time=311] And perhaps God has been saying something to you these past couple days or weeks.
[time=316] And we want to give you the opportunity this morning to write him down.
[time=319] We stuck in your bulletin, a card that has that question.
[time=323] What's God saying to me?
[time=324] It says, "He's saying and we leave you space to write." So grab the pencil in the pew rack or a pen or pencil that you might have brought.
[time=332] And just take a few minutes as we sing through these songs to write down a word or a phrase about what God has been teaching you, about who he is.
[time=341] And then a little later, we're going to collect them.
[time=344] And we want to show them on the screen so that we can all learn together what God is teaching us.
[time=350] So as we sing this morning with the writing and thinking and asking God to reveal to you what he's teaching you, we just kind of want for these first couple songs to just have the freedom to sit or stand.
[time=361] However you feel, if you know what to write down, write it down right away and then stand up and sing with us or if you need some time to just sit and think and pray, just feel free to remain seated.
[time=372] And we'll just kind of do whatever you feel like the Lord wants you to do at this time.
[time=377] Let me pray for us as we start that our minds and thoughts would be fixed on him.
[time=383] Father God, you are awesome and you are far above every title that we can give you.
[time=393] You are the same yesterday today and forever.
[time=399] And God, we know that you teach us day by day to learn a little bit more about who you are.
[time=406] God, would you please open our eyes today and show us more of who you are and how we should live in response to that?
[time=417] And God, would you help us to put the pieces together?
[time=421] Sometimes when you teach us, it can be confusing and it takes us a while to catch up because you are so awesome and intelligent.
[time=431] And Lord, I just pray that you're by your spirit, that you would bring clarity to our minds and our hearts today as we worship you for who you are.
[time=439] [AMEN] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 140 seconds]
[time=590] Isn't that again You alone?
[time=592] [MUSIC - 16 seconds]
[time=611] - Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries, and thank you so much for tuning in again.
[time=618] We're thankful that you've joined us for the broadcast.
[time=621] We are so looking forward to these next several weeks as we continue in this series that we've started entitled, For Better, For Worse, God's Design for Marriage and Family.
[time=633] And what you're going to see today, I promise you, will be a real treat.
[time=638] Last week, Steve Longbreak, one of our teaching pastors, came and shared with the Black Hawk family.
[time=646] His unique perspective from God's word and from his own life, Steve will today, I think, really challenge you and give you the opportunity to think through some marriage and family issues from the 20 plus years of family and marriage life that he's experienced.
[time=667] We're so thankful for Steve.
[time=669] So thankful for his 24 years of service here at Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=674] And now in these last couple of years, Steve has transitioned into being a teaching pastor for us.
[time=680] He is the wise old sage on our pastoral staff.
[time=685] All the years that God has given him, all the experiences, many of which, or several of which you'll hear about today, all the experiences that God has brought him through.
[time=695] It's all developed in Steve, a real sense of wisdom, a real sense of who God is and how God works.
[time=703] And he would be the first to tell you that he doesn't have it all figured out.
[time=706] But boy, we are really, really thankful for him around here.
[time=710] And what you'll hear today, I believe, will really challenge and stretch your heart.
[time=716] And so I hope that you're looking forward to it.
[time=719] I also want to mention to you today, June 6th.
[time=722] As you're viewing this broadcast, it's June 6th.
[time=725] And today at Black Hawk, one service at 1045.
[time=729] And we call it Family Sunday.
[time=731] Just one service, 1045.
[time=733] There isn't any childcare except for the real little ones.
[time=737] So all the kids come in.
[time=739] There's balloons, we have a great time.
[time=742] Mitch and I are going to bring a message aimed specifically at our kids.
[time=746] And it's going to be about being a God honoring kid.
[time=750] It's about obeying your mother and your father.
[time=753] And we are going to have a great time speaking to and dialoguing with the kids about what it's like to honor God and honor mom and dad.
[time=761] The worship's going to be really, really special.
[time=765] And we'd love to have you come.
[time=766] One service, 1045 today.
[time=768] And then afterwards, stick around for lunch.
[time=770] We're having our second annual Black Hawk Ministries car show.
[time=774] The lot is going to be filled with all kinds of cars and a lot of great people.
[time=779] From Black Hawk and the surrounding community, we would love to have you.
[time=782] So come and join us today at 1045 Family Sunday, one service in the car show and lunch afterwards.
[time=788] We hope you'll come and join us.
[time=790] See you there.
[time=792] [MUSIC]
[time=795] It's all staying together.
[time=796] [MUSIC]
[time=804] Much more worthy than I know.
[time=808] And I cannot imagine just some glory as you are.
[time=815] And I cannot begin to tell how deep will love you bring.
[time=821] Lord, my years have heard of you, and now my eyes have seen.
[time=829] You're worthy, you're worthy, you're worthy, you're worthy.
[time=838] You're worthy to be praised forever and a name.
[time=844] You're worthy, you're worthy, you're worthy.
[time=851] You're worthy to be praised forever and a name.
[time=860] Glory, I get glory.
[time=862] Glory, I get glory to the one who saved my soul.
[time=869] You found me and you freed me from the shame that was my own.
[time=875] And I cannot begin to tell how merciful you've been.
[time=882] Lord, my years have heard of you, and now my eyes have seen.
[time=887] You're worthy, you're worthy, you're worthy.
[time=899] You're worthy to be praised forever and a name.
[time=905] You're worthy, you're worthy, you're worthy.
[time=911] You're worthy to be praised forever and a name.
[time=920] You're worthy, you're worthy, you're worthy.
[time=926] You're worthy to be praised forever and a name.
[time=932] You're worthy, you're worthy, you're worthy.
[time=937] You're worthy for, you're worthy to be praised forever and a name.
[time=953] I exalt me, I exalt me, I exalt me, oh Lord, oh Lord,
[time=1005] I exalt me, I exalt me, I exalt me, oh Lord, you're worthy, you're worthy,
[time=1035] you're worthy, you're worthy to be praised forever and a name.
[time=1044] You're worthy, you're worthy, you're worthy, you're worthy to be praised forever and a name.
[time=1088] He is worthy, he is.
[time=1091] Thanks Corbin and Josh and Ken.
[time=1093] We don't talk about Ken much up there on the percussion, he's really good.
[time=1098] I hear the musicians in round here talk about him.
[time=1106] That was kind of an unplugged deal today, huh Corbin?
[time=1109] Sort of an unplugged worship.
[time=1111] That was good, really good.
[time=1116] You know, in the song previous to that last one that we sang, it says he gives and takes
[time=1125] away, he gives and takes away.
[time=1131] My heart will choose to say, "Blessed be the name of the Lord."
[time=1138] It's not always easy, is it?
[time=1141] He tells us in James 1 when you consider it pure joy when trials come.
[time=1147] You're to consider it joy.
[time=1150] Blessed is his name, no matter what the circumstances are, whether the vineyard is really rich with grapes or not, he's still God and he deserves our praise.
[time=1162] And that's true in our marriages, it's really true in our marriages.
[time=1168] No matter how things are going.
[time=1170] The bottom line is, he deserves our obedience and our desire to bring him pleasure.
[time=1180] A lot of times it's hard, it's really hard.
[time=1185] It's hard for me to be obedient to this because being obedient to what he teaches me here
[time=1191] doesn't always bring pleasure to me and so it gets hard sometimes.
[time=1198] In the last few weeks, Kelly's been talking about marriage and emphasizing the husband's
[time=1205] role and I'm kind of kind of wrap that part up today.
[time=1208] I get to beat husbands up today too.
[time=1214] He taught us before marriage to maintain purity.
[time=1220] You know what?
[time=1221] The burden's on the men there too.
[time=1222] I tell students, I've been saying it for years, girls.
[time=1227] When he says I love you, when he says I love you, often that guy may mean I lust for you.
[time=1238] And you better have a really good ear and listen for the difference.
[time=1243] If he says I love you, what that means is I'm going to look for the opportunities to
[time=1249] help you stay pure.
[time=1252] That's what love is.
[time=1253] I'm going to look for the opportunities to do things for you to have life be enjoyable for you, for you to have no regrets.
[time=1261] That's what love is.
[time=1264] And often what he's really saying is I lust and girls, you need to hear the difference.
[time=1272] And guys, you need to say it differently and mean it differently.
[time=1276] And that's what Kelly taught us in the week about building up to marriage.
[time=1281] You know, dating, dating's a weird thing.
[time=1286] The Bible doesn't tell us how to date.
[time=1287] It doesn't even tell us that we should date.
[time=1289] It doesn't say anything about dating.
[time=1291] Our culture has taken on dating as preparatory relation building time for marriage.
[time=1299] But the Bible doesn't do that.
[time=1301] And cultures for years haven't done it that way, for centuries and centuries and other cultures.
[time=1307] Many cultures have had arranged marriages.
[time=1310] That's been most prevalent over most of time.
[time=1314] And probably a good thing.
[time=1315] Now the Bible doesn't tell us that we should do that, so I can't say that's what we should be doing.
[time=1320] But the advantages to that have been pretty clear.
[time=1324] I know a lot of families that have counseled their son or their daughter not to marry someone.
[time=1332] And everybody in the family may love this person so much that they don't want what's
[time=1338] down the road in a relationship with that person.
[time=1341] And yet that son or daughter will ignore that counsel from people that love them all the time.
[time=1346] And they'll date the people that they like or that bring them some pleasure now.
[time=1352] And we have a whole system designed around that.
[time=1355] I've been kind of jokingly saying, and it's really interesting to me, God designed us
[time=1361] to procreate in our teens.
[time=1365] We're able to do that.
[time=1366] And we say, now don't do that until now, it's like 28 people are waiting until they get
[time=1372] married to 28.
[time=1373] And we say, now you just hold off on that one.
[time=1376] We keep our children, children maybe too long.
[time=1381] It's possible that people were ready and are designed to be ready to work, earn a living,
[time=1387] be responsible for themselves maybe a little earlier.
[time=1390] Maybe these rebellious teenage years are because they're not supposed to be under our roof depending on us during those times.
[time=1397] That's a possibility.
[time=1399] But we have this dating system, we're stuck with it, so I'm going to live with it.
[time=1405] But guys and young women maintain purity beforehand.
[time=1410] And I'd encourage you to follow the advice of the people who love you most.
[time=1417] Grandparents, aunts and uncles, and moms and dads.
[time=1423] And then Kelly taught us that husbands should sacrifice, shepherd, protect, nurture and
[time=1430] cherish their wives.
[time=1432] Now listen again, man, sacrifice, shepherd, protect, nourish and cherish.
[time=1440] You do that really well and her submission part won't be real hard.
[time=1448] And we should be like that.
[time=1449] That's Ephesians 6.
[time=1450] It's clear.
[time=1451] Ephesians 5.
[time=1452] It's clear.
[time=1453] That's the kind of husband that we're supposed to be.
[time=1457] Have a nephew who spoke at his grandmother's funeral not long ago.
[time=1464] You're going to hear me refer to my three marriages a few times this morning.
[time=1469] I've had three marriages to two women.
[time=1472] I had two marriages to one woman, seventeen years of a bad husband and then five years
[time=1479] of a good husband.
[time=1481] Two different marriages, really.
[time=1483] And then I've had six years of marriage with my present wife Nancy, Renee Died eight years
[time=1489] ago.
[time=1492] And so as I refer to my marriages all throughout this sermon, I'm going to talk about some good times that I've had and some really bad times that I had because I was a bad husband.
[time=1503] Well my first wife's mother died a few weeks ago and we went down to do the funeral.
[time=1510] One of the things that she'd asked for, she asked that her grandchildren would say something at the funeral about her.
[time=1518] And they each did.
[time=1519] And one of my nephews stood up and he said, when I was getting ready to get married a
[time=1525] little over a year ago, grandma had been married 57 years so I asked her for some advice.
[time=1532] I said, "What do you want to tell me about marriage?" And in all her wisdom, 57 years of marriage, she boiled it down to three words.
[time=1541] She said to him, "Zach, stick it out."
[time=1547] Pretty good, isn't it?
[time=1549] Stick it out.
[time=1550] There are going to be some really hard times that come.
[time=1553] Sometimes it's your spouse that causes them, sometimes you cause them, sometimes some circumstances
[time=1559] from without coming cause all kinds of stress and pressure.
[time=1562] She said, "Stick it out." A friend of mine this week gave me a devotional that Dave Jeremiah does, a turning point.
[time=1570] And it was May 18th, it was this one, it says, "On her golden wedding anniversary, a grandmother
[time=1577] revealed the secret of her long and happy marriage.
[time=1582] On my wedding day, I decided to choose ten of my husband's faults, which for the sake
[time=1591] of our marriage I would overlook," she explained.
[time=1597] A guest asked her to name some of the faults.
[time=1601] To tell the truth, she said, "I never did get around to listing them, but whenever my
[time=1607] husband did something that made me hopping mad, I would say to myself, 'Lucky for him,
[time=1615] that's one of the ten.'"
[time=1621] That's good.
[time=1622] Women, are you looking for the opportunities to forgive your husband?
[time=1627] You should be.
[time=1628] Kelly will emphasize more of that later as he talks about what the Bible has to say to
[time=1634] wives.
[time=1636] Stick it out.
[time=1638] Be forgiving.
[time=1639] It's interesting.
[time=1640] Nancy told me the same thing this week when I asked her.
[time=1642] I said, "What do you think is the most important thing you need to remember in being married and having a good marriage?" She said, "Be forgiving." I think she has to do that a lot.
[time=1652] That's why it came to her mind a lot.
[time=1656] What is marriage?
[time=1659] You know, marriage is a sacred, sacred relationship.
[time=1666] It's so sacred that often God refers to himself and his relationship with his chosen
[time=1672] people as though that were a marriage.
[time=1675] Christ, the husband, the church, the bride, there again, God, the father, and the relationship
[time=1682] with his chosen people, Israel, the whole book of Ozeas about that, about them wondering a boy and him buying them back, purchasing us as well.
[time=1692] Marriage is a sacred, sacred event.
[time=1696] Now we don't necessarily treat it like that all the time.
[time=1701] One of the things I've noticed is the Bible doesn't say who should marry people, and it doesn't say what the marriage ceremony is supposed to be like.
[time=1709] Cultures have done that differently over time.
[time=1711] They do it still today.
[time=1712] I mean, in the United States, a justice of the peace can marry you, a judge can marry
[time=1718] you, a sea captain can marry you, a pastor, a preacher can marry you, a girl came up to me after the first service and said her sister got married by a bartender not long ago, who got online and got ordained or licensed to marry.
[time=1735] That doesn't sound very sacred, does it?
[time=1738] You see, it's not the ceremony that's sacred.
[time=1741] It's the relationship that's sacred, no matter how the ceremony took place.
[time=1745] God has principles for us to live by that allow us to give us the opportunity to express
[time=1752] our love for Him in our relationship with our spouse and with our children.
[time=1758] Incredible opportunity, but it's hard.
[time=1763] It's not complicated as far as understanding what it is we're supposed to do.
[time=1768] It's very simple, but it's hard.
[time=1773] He said in Genesis 2 that a husband and a man and woman were going to leave their father and mother and cleave to their wife, the husband was going to cleave to his wife and the two shall become one.
[time=1785] In Ephesians 5 it says that's an unbelievable mystery, the two becoming one.
[time=1789] In premarital counseling I've often said to people, not only are you becoming one, but hopefully over the course of your life you'll become one-er and one-er.
[time=1799] Keith and Catherine are more like now than they were when they got married.
[time=1802] He took on a lot of her good qualities, thank goodness.
[time=1805] It's really true though, isn't it?
[time=1807] They find people that have been married together and they've had Christ in common and they pursue Him and they become more and more and more alike and they're thinking, shouldn't they?
[time=1818] If your mind's being renewed with His principles and you're applying His principles, shouldn't a husband and wife become more alike?
[time=1824] You know, all Christians should become more and more alike when it comes to obedience and understanding His principles.
[time=1832] It gets a little scary though, sometimes they start to look more and more alike.
[time=1837] They eat the same things all the time, that's why.
[time=1844] In Malachi 2 it says, "Has not the Lord made them one in flesh and spirit they are His."
[time=1850] I like that verse.
[time=1852] "Has not the Lord made them one when the two become one, supernaturally they become one
[time=1858] and they are His in spirit and in flesh they're His."
[time=1864] Do you see yourself that way?
[time=1866] Do you honestly think of your marriage relationship as the two of you becoming more and more one
[time=1872] and His together as one?
[time=1876] That's big.
[time=1880] I don't think that way unless I read Malachi.
[time=1883] I don't think that way unless I read Ephesians 5 and Colossians 3.
[time=1888] I don't think that way because my natural way of thinking is to just bring pleasure to me and I get real manipulative and slick about how to pull that off in a marriage.
[time=1899] I did that for 17 years.
[time=1902] I regret that.
[time=1906] Six of those years I lived in Columbus, Ohio.
[time=1909] I worked in a Christian school and then 11 of those 17 I was here with you and I worked
[time=1915] here and most people wouldn't have said our marriage was bad.
[time=1919] I wasn't beating her, we were eating well.
[time=1923] I wasn't abusive.
[time=1926] I just didn't love her the way God told me I should love her.
[time=1932] Now really I didn't understand it all.
[time=1935] In my humanity I was trying to apply principles and do things but I really didn't have a clear understanding about that because my mind was blocked with my own selfish desires.
[time=1946] I was deceiving myself into thinking that if I got the list done that Renee wanted me to do over here then I'd be free to do the things that I wanted to do.
[time=1955] So I worked hard at getting her list done and I tried to do expressions of love for her
[time=1961] by doing things for her but I wasn't loving her.
[time=1967] And then a couple things happened, 17 years down my marriage.
[time=1972] One that happened was Russell standing up here preaching and he said to the men, I was sitting right down there, he said go home today and ask your wife if you've been pursuing her.
[time=1987] And I sat there thinking I don't want to ask that.
[time=1991] About the same time Denny Howard taught us the five love languages.
[time=1997] The first time I'd heard about that it's a book.
[time=2001] And I really thought through have I been pursuing Renee, no I hadn't been pursuing her.
[time=2007] I've been pursuing satisfying her so I could do what I wanted to do.
[time=2014] That's what I've been in pursuit of.
[time=2018] And I've done that in some really stupid ways.
[time=2021] When we really understood and I started to think about how she liked to be loved versus how I like to be loved we both did some stupid things.
[time=2028] She kept loving me the way she liked to be loved.
[time=2032] She kept sending me cards, not send them to me.
[time=2035] She'd write things and give me cards and because she really likes words, those five love languages.
[time=2041] Denny you may have to help me here I'll try to get them right.
[time=2044] Words of encouragement is a big one, written and spoken both.
[time=2049] Some people like tangible gifts, they really like gifts, that's me, I like presents.
[time=2055] Some people like acts of service, when you serve them you do something for them they feel loved when you do that.
[time=2062] For some people it's time.
[time=2065] They really just need your time.
[time=2068] Sometimes it's just listening.
[time=2070] What did I leave out Denny?
[time=2072] Touch, that's me, I shouldn't forget that.
[time=2076] Some people really love to be touched, physically touched, I like that.
[time=2080] Gifts and touch, that's me.
[time=2084] She kept giving me these cards and I'd read them and I'd tell her that I liked them and I did and I was thankful for them I was and I loved her for doing it but pretty soon that she'd find them in the trash because they didn't mean a whole lot to me, they just for
[time=2100] a moment they did, okay?
[time=2102] I'd buy her gifts, I'd come home and I'd buy her something so that I could get to do what I wanted to do.
[time=2107] I'd buy her something and she didn't like gifts, as a matter of fact it frustrated her that I spent the money on the presents.
[time=2116] She wanted my time, my ear, okay, and she wanted me to talk to her and she wanted words
[time=2125] of encouragement, both verbally and on paper and I learned that from Denny and so we started
[time=2131] to do that and you know what, me pursuing her, her way, the way she loved to be loved,
[time=2140] and I started to actively do that.
[time=2143] Our marriage changed and for five years we had a magnificent marriage.
[time=2149] It culminated in the best year of our marriage, the year she was sick we had an incredible
[time=2155] amount of intimacy, not much physical intimacy other than me hugging her but my goodness
[time=2162] were we intimate in our relationship and we had some laughs too, we had some real good
[time=2168] laughs.
[time=2169] I've probably experienced ten years of wonderful marriage in that one year of her illness.
[time=2175] We really enjoyed the time together and then by God's grace after a couple years I got
[time=2181] to do marriage again and I've been able to continue pursuing this woman in different
[time=2189] ways, some similar, some different and Nancy responds to that and loves me and like I said
[time=2197] she forgives.
[time=2200] Nancy is a servant, she has the gift of helps, she has the gift of hospitality, she's a real
[time=2206] servant and our marriage is rich and deep and we have a spiritual relationship that's
[time=2212] really rich and deep and I was talking about intimacy with Renee, I've been able to enjoy that with Nancy because we're both focused on being intimate with him and as we move toward intimacy with him and we do that together, it's incredible what can happen in a marriage.
[time=2228] This week she's been reading Sir Night of the Splendid Way to Me and I don't really
[time=2236] like to be read to you all that much.
[time=2240] Renee liked to read the newspaper to me, Nancy likes to read this book now, she's read some other things to me too and it's, you know what, it's incredible, now think about it,
[time=2251] how much does that cost?
[time=2253] She's reading a book to me, we don't have to go somewhere but she's been reading about Sir Constant the Night and he's on the splendid way, the lit way, the lighted path, a path
[time=2268] toward Christ, a path that is full of life and spiritual vitality and periodically in
[time=2275] each chapter something from the outside comes in or you go off the path or the path gets
[time=2281] an obstacle but something comes into the play that would be a real stumbling block in life.
[time=2290] But this book's about how you can move around, move through, get over, moving toward him.
[time=2296] And when we do that together, when we do that together as a husband and a wife, our relationship
[time=2303] just gets richer and richer and richer.
[time=2307] I'm a blessed man, I've had three marriages and two have been really good.
[time=2313] Well, how is it supposed to be lived out?
[time=2316] If that's what it's supposed to be like, a sacred relationship, a type of Christ and
[time=2323] the church, if that's what it's supposed to be like, how do we do that?
[time=2329] It's so fascinating when you read the Bible, it is so simple.
[time=2333] He says the same things in several places.
[time=2335] In Colossians chapter 3, let's look at that together.
[time=2338] Colossians chapter 3 verses 18 to 21.
[time=2344] He says, "Wives, submit to your husbands as is fitting in the Lord.
[time=2351] Husbands love your wives and do not be harsh with them.
[time=2356] Then obey your parents in everything for this pleases the Lord.
[time=2361] Fathers do not embiter your children, or they will become discouraged." The NIV translators, at the top of this section in the Bible, they say rules for Christian
[time=2372] households.
[time=2373] Wouldn't you think there'd be a long list?
[time=2377] I mean, if you think about all the rules that you think would be in place for Christian households, you think, wow, there's a big list.
[time=2385] What God did through Paul, when he wrote to the Colossians, was he made it very, very
[time=2392] simple, just really, really profound.
[time=2399] Husbands, you respond to a wife that submits to you, nah, that's not it.
[time=2405] You love your wife no matter what she's doing.
[time=2412] If you submit to husbands, I just want to say to all of you men, I believe, submitting to us should be easy.
[time=2421] Submitting to us should be easy.
[time=2423] It should not be hard.
[time=2427] Loving wives should be easy.
[time=2430] Should not be hard.
[time=2431] But that's not always the case, is it?
[time=2435] Well why in the world do you suppose he would give us such simple, a simple list of rules for Christian households?
[time=2442] I've thought about that for four weeks, five weeks now.
[time=2445] Why God, why didn't you spell it out more clearly?
[time=2452] Well the truth of it is, this gets fleshed out differently in every single household.
[time=2459] We are each uniquely created.
[time=2463] My loving, my wife, is different than you loving your wife, but loving her we must.
[time=2476] In Ephesians, he has the same kind of list.
[time=2479] He says, "Submit love till children to obey." The only difference there in Colossians chapter three, when it comes to fathers and children,
[time=2489] the Bible says that we're not too embittered our children, they're in Colossians, that we shouldn't make them bitter.
[time=2495] We should not be so harsh dads that we drive them to anger and bitterness.
[time=2502] We need to be gentle and loving, firm yes, harsh no.
[time=2508] That's how you embittered children.
[time=2511] It's different in Ephesians.
[time=2513] He says we shouldn't exasperate, frustrate our children.
[time=2517] We need to make things clear and not waffle all the time.
[time=2523] Nothing harder for kids than parents who change the rules all the time.
[time=2529] The rules need to be few enough and simple enough that we can keep them and enforce them.
[time=2538] Well, for the first 17 years, I loved me.
[time=2545] I pretended to love her.
[time=2547] I did the things that I was supposed to do.
[time=2549] As a matter of fact, people in Blackhawk would have probably thought, "Yeah, he's doing a good job.
[time=2553] They're together all the time.
[time=2555] They're serving in the church." And on a scale of one to ten, I don't even know where to put our marriage in those first 17 years.
[time=2565] But when I started to love him through my marriage, when I started to express my love
[time=2573] for him, through my relationship to my wife, when I was looking for the opportunities
[time=2579] to bring pleasure to my Lord God, through my relationship with my wife, when I started
[time=2585] to pursue her the way she liked to be loved, when I loved him and loved her instead of loving
[time=2591] me first, things really changed.
[time=2598] And most people probably couldn't tell the difference, but we could tell a big difference.
[time=2605] She always knew when it was about me, "I don't care how many things I did on Saturday.
[time=2610] I don't care if it took eight hours to do her list, and I only got to spend one hour on the things I wanted to do.
[time=2616] When it was about me getting to do what I wanted to do, she knew it."
[time=2626] When I started to love him by loving her, she knew that too, and it got good.
[time=2636] And Nancy and I have been able to experience that together too for these six years, as the two of us are one, and we worship him in spirit and truth, we become oneer, and the
[time=2646] joy in our marriage gets deeper and richer.
[time=2651] It's a spiritual, sacred relationship.
[time=2658] Now how about you people that have been married seven times?
[time=2662] How about you people that haven't been married at all?
[time=2664] What's all this about?
[time=2665] Paul says in 1 Corinthians 7, first of all, say to the single people.
[time=2669] In 1 Corinthians 7, he lifts up singleness, and he says, "If you can be single, be
[time=2676] single, so that you can give more time to serving me, because a married person with a family has divided interests, and they cannot give the time that you've been giving, and
[time=2687] that you can give as a single person." So he lifts up.
[time=2689] Paul says, "If you can, if you're able, be single." Now we also know that when God created man, he said, "It's not good for man to be alone," and he gave Eve to Adam as to help me.
[time=2700] So we know those things are both true, but I want to tell you, if you're able to be single, Paul says in 1 Corinthians 7, "Be single and serve him with the extra time that you have."
[time=2712] For those of you that have been married several times, start today to do marriage God's way.
[time=2721] You cannot do anything about the past, but you can do something about today.
[time=2726] Start today doing marriage God's way.
[time=2733] I talked about sea captains and judges marrying people.
[time=2738] I always wonder what kind of premarital counseling those folks get.
[time=2744] Premarital counseling, it takes a lot of forms.
[time=2747] A lot of people offer some personality profile testing to take place, and I've done that
[time=2754] with a lot of people, and sometimes you find out that they are really different from each other, and you can help them understand some of those differences as they look forward to being married, and they can plan ahead.
[time=2768] Sometimes they're a lot alike, but believe me, there are still a lot of differences, and you need to get geared up for those.
[time=2776] The personality profiling can be really helpful.
[time=2779] For instance, in my case, it would have really been good for Renee to clearly understand that
[time=2786] I'm spontaneous every day all day, and to plan something is kind of foreign to me.
[time=2794] Renee planned everything.
[time=2796] She was in charge of the wedding.
[time=2798] I was in charge of the honeymoon.
[time=2801] The wedding was really well planned.
[time=2803] Everything went really smoothly.
[time=2804] We got in the car for our honeymoon, and we started to head out of Columbus, and she said, "Where are we going?" And I said, "North." She said, "No, I mean, where are we stopping?" I said, "Well, the first place that has a vacancy," because I was really excited about this trip.
[time=2820] We were going to go north, and then we were going to go east.
[time=2823] When we spent half our money, we were going to turn around and go west and south, come
[time=2829] back home.
[time=2832] Some people are laughing, but some are sitting here going, "What an idiot."
[time=2838] That's what she thought.
[time=2840] We ended up having a great time, but that's a really good example of how different we really were in personality.
[time=2849] It's really good to know those things about yourself, and it doesn't mean you can't have a great marriage together.
[time=2856] It just simply means that you're going to have to work at understanding your partner and to love your partner the way they like to be loved.
[time=2863] You need to understand who they are and what it is they like.
[time=2867] With Nancy, I had the honeymoon thing down by the time you know, 22 years of marriage, and then a couple years single, and then when Nancy and I went away, I planned this really elaborate honeymoon, and I made sure she was in the loop to plan it instead of me going, so we went down to St. John in the Virgin Islands, and we had the best time.
[time=2887] One of the things I noticed about both the honeymoon, though, it's not how much money you have or where you go, it's who you're with.
[time=2897] It's really who you're with.
[time=2899] Nancy and I could have done the same honeymoon I did before and it would have been fine.
[time=2902] Renee and I could have gone to St. John, it would have been fine because we loved each other, and we were really enjoying getting to know each other in new ways.
[time=2912] Wouldn't it be interesting if we could do personality profiles and match people up perfectly with the person that really fits their profile?
[time=2920] How many of you think that would be an opposite person?
[time=2925] You don't have to raise your hand, but you have opinions about that.
[time=2928] What I've observed over the years is they both fail, and they both succeed.
[time=2933] It really doesn't have anything to do with that because the truth is, no matter who you're designed to be, as you yield to him and you become more like Christ, you love and yield
[time=2945] to your spouse and their differences in you.
[time=2948] When both people are deferring to the other, it's a rich time.
[time=2954] If only one is deferring, you can still have success, just harder.
[time=2962] Well, how's this different than any other relationship in your life?
[time=2969] Why is this husband and wife thing different?
[time=2971] I looked at it and I thought, what is it that God's really calling us to do?
[time=2975] Look at Philippians 2 with me, Philippians chapter 2, Philippians 2 1 says, "If you have
[time=2983] any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from His love."
[time=2990] Philippians 2 verse 1, "If any fellowship with the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion,
[time=3004] then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in Spirit
[time=3010] and purpose.
[time=3012] Do nothing out of selfish ambition, stop.
[time=3016] Do nothing out of selfish ambition." In this case, we're not talking about husbands and wives, God says, "Here's the standard for Christian living.
[time=3026] The first commandment is, 'Love me with all your heart, mind, soul, and strength, and the second one is likened unto it.
[time=3031] Love your neighbor as yourself.
[time=3034] Do nothing for anybody, for yourself.
[time=3037] Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better
[time=3047] than yourselves." Same word as that James 1 word I was talking about, when it says, "Consider it pure joy, my brethren, when you face trials of many kinds." Here he says, "In humility, okay, here's the deal.
[time=3060] If I want to have a right relationship with you, and if I want to have a right relationship with my spouse," step number one is to humble myself before the living God and say, "Oh,
[time=3071] your God, I'll do it your way." In humility, I bow before God, and I start to consider others as more important than
[time=3082] myself.
[time=3083] And I stop doing things out of selfishness and in vain conceit.
[time=3088] You know, that's not popular today.
[time=3091] That's not popular.
[time=3093] We teach our young people that they're number one.
[time=3097] We have a lot of cheers that say that.
[time=3099] I've often thought, wouldn't it be interesting if the whole sports scene was about enjoying the game and finding out how you could best match everybody up so you'd have the most competitive game.
[time=3110] So when one school comes to town, they come in and you say, "Who's your best player?" Well, let's put them against each other.
[time=3115] Who's number two?
[time=3116] Well, let's put him on our team because number, let's put them on your team and we'll just kind of swap.
[time=3122] We have the most competitive, wouldn't it be fun if every game came down to the last minute instead of some blowouts.
[time=3128] But we're teaching people all the time in all kinds of arenas to, in order to build self-confidence, we say, "You're number one." There's not a whole lot of humility being taught today.
[time=3139] And in the church, we need to be teaching it.
[time=3143] He says, "Make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in the spirit.
[time=3150] You're nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility, consider others better than yourselves.
[time=3155] Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others.
[time=3160] If I'm looking to your interest, it's pretty easy because I go home at night and you're not there.
[time=3168] It's a lot easier with you.
[time=3171] When I'm looking out for the interests of my wife and my children, it's much harder.
[time=3176] I go home and I'm tired and they have needs." But he says, "In humility, I need a bow before him and love her and not exasperate my children
[time=3189] and not embit her my children." And that takes some hard work.
[time=3194] Well, if I'm supposed to love her, I thought, "I've never really thought about 1 Corinthians
[time=3201] 13 in light of me loving my wife." Isn't that crazy?
[time=3206] The love chapter.
[time=3209] Let's look at it.
[time=3210] 1 Corinthians 13 verses 4 through 7.
[time=3221] "Okay, Steve, if you're going to love Nancy the way Christ loves the church, then you will
[time=3229] be patient, love is patient."
[time=3236] That must not mean me sitting in the car, banging my foot on the floor, waiting out there anxiously
[time=3243] and angrily.
[time=3244] I don't think that's what patience is.
[time=3247] Now that's been true in both my marriages.
[time=3252] They go slower than I do.
[time=3254] You know what else?
[time=3255] They're more thorough than I am.
[time=3257] I drop anything to be on time.
[time=3259] They may do a couple important things before they come out to the car.
[time=3264] Love is patient.
[time=3266] Sounds like a little thing.
[time=3268] Those are big things.
[time=3269] You add all those up, all those foot tapping, anxious, angry, waiting moments that they perceive.
[time=3277] They add up.
[time=3280] Love is kind.
[time=3284] Are you as kind to your family as you are to other people?
[time=3289] Some people are more kind to the brothers and sisters in Christ that they bump into a church.
[time=3294] They go out of the way.
[time=3295] They serve.
[time=3296] They help.
[time=3297] They do than they are at home.
[time=3298] A lot of men have a chair at home.
[time=3302] I do.
[time=3303] I like to get in it.
[time=3310] This kindness means I have to get out of the chair.
[time=3317] It does not envy.
[time=3318] It does not boast.
[time=3319] It is not proud.
[time=3321] It is not self-seeking.
[time=3322] It is not easily angered.
[time=3324] It keeps no record of wrongs.
[time=3328] Men and women, are you still bringing up what happened seven years ago that you said you forgave them for?
[time=3336] Does it still come up when you get frustrated and angry?
[time=3338] If you have been hanging onto a record book that is maybe just mental, it will keep you
[time=3344] from having the marriage that God wants you to have.
[time=3346] Men you need to love your wives, keeping no record of wrongs.
[time=3351] That forgiveness issue has another element to it.
[time=3354] You can forget things.
[time=3365] It says love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.
[time=3373] Do you spend time rejoicing together in the truth?
[time=3379] When Nancy's reading "Sir Night of the Splendid Way to Me," it moves us toward Him in truth
[time=3388] because there's truth written in that book.
[time=3391] If we're in this book and I'm reading to her and I'm leading her and we pray together,
[time=3398] then I am loving her, rejoicing with her in the truth.
[time=3406] It's incredible what happens to marriages when we begin to love each other the way He
[time=3413] tells us to love each other, making choices to do that.
[time=3419] It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.
[time=3426] Men, have you been pursuing your wife?
[time=3436] Have you been loving her the way she needs to be loved, the way she likes to be loved?
[time=3444] Have you been loving her with this list of words that you see there in 1 Corinthians 13?
[time=3452] If you do, she'll submit to that.
[time=3458] It's not hard to submit to that.
[time=3462] And the ones that don't submit to that because they're selfishly ambitious and wanting their own routine, it's just for a while, and then you get to be with Him.
[time=3476] But men, God's called us to love our wives.
[time=3483] Please do it.
[time=3486] Our Father in Heaven, we bow down because you're God.
[time=3495] We understand that you want us to do family your way.
[time=3505] And God, we really do know that the benefits are there, but our humanity, our selfishness,
[time=3512] our flesh get in the way, and we yield to that, and we deceive ourselves, and we manipulate
[time=3520] people.
[time=3521] Please forgive us.
[time=3523] And God, please enlighten us and help us to do marriage your way.
[time=3528] Please help us.
[time=3529] In Jesus' name I pray.
[time=3530] [AMEN]
