[time=56] [MUSIC]
[time=85] >> As we think about a Sunday like this when we're all together in one room is the opportunity to worship and to sing praise and to give thanks to God for who he is, amen.
[time=96] And when we get to do that, I mean it's always sweet to get to do it in those two services on Sunday and even that Wednesday night crowd at Common Ground, it's always good, but to do it together in one room is a real real treat.
[time=109] So we just want to invite you this morning to lift your voices to absolutely hold nothing back. I think this first song starts out. I will give you all my worship.
[time=120] I will give you you and I saying to him that we will give him everything that we have. And so this morning as you sing, young old in between, if you're new around this place, you've been here for 30 years either way, would you just this morning with one voice give him everything that you have.
[time=138] And let's honor him. And let's give him all of our worship this morning. Amen. Let's do it, Corbin.
[time=144] Let's stand together.
[time=174] I will worship.
[time=188] I will pray to you.
[time=203] I will see you.
[time=223] I will give you all my worship.
[time=243] I will go down.
[time=258] Hail you, as he came.
[time=261] Oh, I will serve you.
[time=265] Give everything.
[time=268] I will give you everything.
[time=287] I will give you all my worship.
[time=299] Give love.
[time=300] I want you worship.
[time=303] Give love.
[time=305] I will give you everything.
[time=310] Give all my worship.
[time=313] I will give you all my praise.
[time=318] Give love.
[time=319] I want you worship.
[time=322] Give love.
[time=324] I will be all my praise.
[time=352] Give love.
[time=357] Let's have the guys start out.
[time=362] You are holy.
[time=374] You are worthy.
[time=379] I will follow.
[time=383] I will listen.
[time=387] I will love you.
[time=392] All of my name.
[time=397] I will sing and sing and worship.
[time=401] Give love.
[time=447] You are holy.
[time=452] You are worthy.

[time=1133] Father, we come to you this morning to praise you and to lift your name on high.
[time=1139] You are worthy of our praise and you are worthy of us gathering together and lifting our voices.
[time=1146] May we please this morning as your children gather and may you be honored and glorified by all that takes place here today.
[time=1154] In Christ Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

[time=1548] [MUSIC]
[time=2000] Wow.
[time=2002] Well, here we are back to reality.
[time=2005] A whole room full of imperfect people.
[time=2007] Amen?
[time=2008] But boy, it's funny to think about it.
[time=2010] Sometimes you and I, we have those thoughts.
[time=2012] We have those pictures of what we wish it would be like.
[time=2015] But one thing I'm really thankful for is that God's Word gives us, as we've been looking for these last several weeks, God's Word gives us His design on marriage and family.
[time=2025] There is a way we can go at it.
[time=2027] There's a way we can pursue it.
[time=2029] Not perfectly, but He gives us away.
[time=2031] And we've been working on that here the last several weeks.
[time=2034] Next week, we're going to jump back in and talk to wives.
[time=2037] And for a couple of weeks, and then the next two weeks after that, we're going to come back and finish up the series talking about parenting.
[time=2044] God's design for parenting those last two weeks.
[time=2048] So hang with us.
[time=2049] We're enjoying this series called "For Better For Worse." God's design for marriage and family.
[time=2055] Well, hey, Mitch, come on up and join me.
[time=2057] We are going to do our best this morning to talk to the kids.
[time=2061] And here's how we're going to do it.
[time=2062] And parents, just please, don't sweat the crying and the yelling.
[time=2066] We invited you to bring the kids so we know what's coming.
[time=2069] We're going to ask all the kids.
[time=2071] You know, four-year-olds and up.
[time=2075] If you'd be willing to, kids, we're going to ask you to come sit quietly right down here.
[time=2079] We're going to have you on the stage.
[time=2082] We're going to have you up here.
[time=2083] Back up a little bit there, Mitch.
[time=2084] We'll make some room for them.
[time=2085] Come on, kids.
[time=2086] And hey, you know what?
[time=2087] I want to say this.
[time=2088] Listen up.
[time=2089] As the kids are coming down, we haven't done it like this in the past.
[time=2094] But I thought today we could.
[time=2095] Come on, kids.
[time=2096] Have a seat up here.
[time=2097] You know what?
[time=2098] If you're in middle school, if you're a sixth, seventh, eighth grader, and hey, watch this.
[time=2104] Everybody have a seat.
[time=2106] Good job, kids.
[time=2107] Come on up here and have a seat.
[time=2109] If you're a sixth, seventh, eighth grader, and watch this, even if you're in high school, today we're going to talk about children obeying your parents.
[time=2119] And this message that we're going to give you here is applicable to all kids.
[time=2125] It's applicable to every kid in this room, even the 16, 17, 18-year-olds.
[time=2130] And so I want to invite even our students to come down for this reason.
[time=2135] Number one, it's going to be good for you to hear.
[time=2138] But you know what?
[time=2139] Students, ninth graders, eleventh graders, you know, tenth, twelfth, you know what?
[time=2143] These kids right here, they would think it just to be awesome if one of you would come and sit by them.
[time=2149] If one of you would show them that you're as willing and open to hearing this message as they are.
[time=2155] So I'll tell you what, six, seventh, eighth graders, ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth, come on down and have a seat here with this crew.
[time=2164] And hey, all you kids, all you kids down here and all the students coming down, just look up this way, okay?
[time=2170] Come on, kids, come around here in the front.
[time=2172] We got lots of room.
[time=2173] Danielle, you can bring them right over here.
[time=2175] We got lots of room.
[time=2176] I'm completely trapped.
[time=2178] I cannot go anywhere.
[time=2179] Hi, Michaela.
[time=2180] We got lots of room.
[time=2182] Come on down here in the front aisle if you can, okay?
[time=2184] Connie, you want to raise your hand?
[time=2186] Ms. Tedda's right down here.
[time=2188] Connie, I'll take care of a few.
[time=2190] Come on, kids, right down here.
[time=2192] Thank you.
[time=2193] Six, seventh, eighth graders.
[time=2195] Feel free to jump in here with a couple of little kids and help us with a little crowd control.
[time=2200] This is awesome.
[time=2202] What a great sight.
[time=2203] We got lots of room, everybody, right here in the middle.
[time=2205] Olivia, you can go over there, baby.
[time=2207] That's good, right there, sweetie.
[time=2209] Come on, high schoolers, middle schoolers, right over here in the middle, or feel free to jump in with a little kid.
[time=2215] Thank you so much.
[time=2218] Come on in here.
[time=2219] You can go up this center, this aisle over here.
[time=2221] You guys can come over here.
[time=2223] Hey, lots of room over here in the middle aisle.
[time=2225] Oh, that's awesome.
[time=2226] You guys can come over here.
[time=2227] Lots of room over here.
[time=2228] Come on, kids, have a seat.
[time=2229] Are you all sisters?
[time=2230] Okay, no piano playing over here.
[time=2231] That's beautiful.
[time=2233] But you can sit there.
[time=2234] No problem.
[time=2235] Come on, have a seat, gang.
[time=2236] Don't touch any of the stuff back there.
[time=2238] Come on over here.
[time=2239] There's still room over here.
[time=2241] Oh, look, we got this gang back here.
[time=2244] Hey, gang.
[time=2245] What's up, brother?
[time=2247] Give me five.
[time=2250] No?
[time=2251] Denied.
[time=2252] Oh, yeah.
[time=2253] All right.
[time=2255] Okay, kids, we're just going to talk to you now, okay?
[time=2260] Listen up.
[time=2261] I need all the kids, all your attention over here.
[time=2264] I need you guys to sit down quietly.
[time=2266] Hey, high school guys over there, help with the crowd control over here.
[time=2270] Again, a little bit, okay?
[time=2272] Protect all musical instruments.
[time=2274] With your lives.
[time=2276] Hey, kids, it's great to have you up here.
[time=2278] I want to just invite you to listen very, very carefully.
[time=2281] This won't take long, but we really do want you to listen to what God's word has to say.
[time=2285] Pastor Mitch, take it away.
[time=2287] All right, today we're going to talk about what the D-Day Boys fought for.
[time=2293] And that's freedom, not freedom to be a perfect family like you saw in the drama, but freedom
[time=2299] to be a family as God intended.
[time=2302] And today we're going to talk about children who honor God, and we're going to call it the posture of obedience.
[time=2309] The posture of obedience.
[time=2310] So here's what I like to show you.
[time=2311] Kelsey, you want to stand up?
[time=2313] What happened?
[time=2314] Oh, who knows?
[time=2316] All right.
[time=2318] We got balloons gone.
[time=2320] Oh, sweet.
[time=2324] See, we can bring our BB gun in Mitch this week now and get these things down.
[time=2328] Exactly what they told us not to do.
[time=2331] All right, this is my daughter Kelsey.
[time=2334] She's 10.
[time=2335] We were talking about it.
[time=2336] We're not sure.
[time=2337] We think when Kelsey was three or four, she got spanked for the first time.
[time=2343] And I cried when I spanked her older sister for the first time.
[time=2347] I had to go in a room and hide.
[time=2349] But Kelsey was so good.
[time=2351] And we really don't spank.
[time=2352] We're kind of talk about it today and let there's absolute willful disobedience.
[time=2358] To obey means to listen.
[time=2361] To listen.
[time=2362] Everybody say that.
[time=2363] To listen.
[time=2364] Obey means to listen.
[time=2367] All right.
[time=2368] So Kelsey did something bad in her grandmother's home on a Sunday afternoon.
[time=2372] She's three or four.
[time=2374] And I said Kelsey, tell your grandmother that you are sorry.
[time=2380] And Kelsey turned her feet that way.
[time=2383] Turn your feet that way.
[time=2385] Folded her hands or arms.
[time=2389] And made a face.
[time=2391] Everybody see that face?
[time=2396] And said.
[time=2397] No.
[time=2398] Say what she say?
[time=2405] No.
[time=2407] It's all right.
[time=2411] We wanted balloons up here.
[time=2413] We did.
[time=2414] Which is exactly what I was refraining from doing is blowing a gasket.
[time=2419] All right.
[time=2420] So she does that.
[time=2421] And I said Kelsey, tell your grandmother you're sorry.
[time=2425] And Kelsey turned her feet that way.
[time=2427] She folded her arms.
[time=2428] She made the face.
[time=2429] Everybody the face.
[time=2431] And Kelsey said what?
[time=2434] No.
[time=2435] That's the posture of disobedience.
[time=2439] And so I spanked Kelsey.
[time=2442] And she was three years old.
[time=2444] And I sat her down.
[time=2446] She wouldn't say, I'm sorry.
[time=2448] You remember that?
[time=2449] I'm spanking her and she goes, no.
[time=2451] I spank her.
[time=2452] She goes, no.
[time=2453] I spanked her.
[time=2455] She goes, stop.
[time=2456] Let her do it.
[time=2457] Let her get it out.
[time=2461] And I sat her down and I gave Kelsey this sermon.
[time=2464] No, I didn't.
[time=2467] And here's what the Bible says.
[time=2468] Here's what the Apostle Paul wrote.
[time=2471] Children obey, which means what?
[time=2474] To listen to your parents in the Lord for this is right.
[time=2479] Honor your father and mother, which is the first commandment.
[time=2483] See, it's one of the 10 commandments with a promise that it may be well with you and that you may live long on the earth.
[time=2492] Obedience.
[time=2493] Kids that honor God.
[time=2496] Obay their parents.
[time=2498] And instead of Kelsey having her feet turn that way and her arms folded and her face saying, no.
[time=2505] This is the posture of obedience.
[time=2508] Feet towards me.
[time=2510] Hands kind of open, palms up, ready to obey and to listen.
[time=2514] Face really, really happy and joyful.
[time=2518] I just love your dad.
[time=2520] And Kelsey's going to talk about the first step there.
[time=2523] Three things.
[time=2524] All right, here you go, kids.
[time=2525] You ready?
[time=2526] Three things about obedience.
[time=2528] Junior hires.
[time=2529] High schoolers.
[time=2530] Little ones.
[time=2531] Everybody.
[time=2532] Three things.
[time=2533] Really simple today.
[time=2535] And you know what I bet mom and dad, I bet there might be some application here for you and me too.
[time=2540] So listen in.
[time=2541] Kids.
[time=2542] Number one.
[time=2543] Here's the first, here's the first thing.
[time=2545] Children that honor God.
[time=2546] There's three things about obedience that you've got to remember.
[time=2549] Hey gang, here's the first one.
[time=2551] God honoring obedience is immediate.
[time=2555] You hear me?
[time=2556] It's immediate.
[time=2557] See those feet walking up there?
[time=2559] Everybody see the screens?
[time=2561] See those feet?
[time=2562] They're walking.
[time=2563] They're moving.
[time=2564] Listen, kids, we honor God when we obey.
[time=2570] You meet every snap your fingers.
[time=2572] Every snap your fingers.
[time=2574] Everybody snap.
[time=2575] We honor God when we obey right away.
[time=2579] Right now.
[time=2580] Like that.
[time=2581] Watch this.
[time=2582] Hey, kids, remember Jonah?
[time=2583] I want to read this to you on the screen.
[time=2585] Jonah in the Bible.
[time=2586] Remember the big fish?
[time=2587] Swallowed Jonah.
[time=2588] Remember that story?
[time=2589] Jonah is a great example, you guys.
[time=2592] So pastor?
[time=2593] If somebody, what's that?
[time=2594] If you disobey God, you get swallowed by a fish.
[time=2596] Right?
[time=2597] I know.
[time=2598] It's scary.
[time=2599] The word of the Lord.
[time=2600] Watch.
[time=2601] Gosh, you're sick.
[time=2605] There's little kids up here, man.
[time=2607] The word of the Lord came to Jonah, the son of Amatai, saying, "Watch this, kids.
[time=2613] Arise, go to Nineveh, the great city, and cry or preach against it for their wickedness
[time=2621] has come up before me." But Jonah, here you go, kids.
[time=2626] Look.
[time=2628] But Jonah rose up to flee or run to Tarshees from the presence of the Lord.
[time=2633] So he went down to Japa, found a ship which was going to Tarshees, paid the fair, and went down into it to go with them to Tarshees.
[time=2642] Kids, here's the deal.
[time=2643] Listen, God said to Jonah, "Go to Nineveh." God had something he wanted Jonah to do in Nineveh.
[time=2650] God said to Jonah, "Go to Nineveh." Jonah said, "You know what?
[time=2656] I don't want to go to Nineveh." He didn't obey God immediately.
[time=2660] Now for you guys, listen.
[time=2662] It might be like this.
[time=2666] Hey Matthew.
[time=2666] Sit on the couch right there.
[time=2668] Okay?
[time=2668] Sit on the couch.
[time=2670] Scoot over here, sweetie.
[time=2670] Sit on the couch, man.
[time=2672] Hey kids.
[time=2672] Watch this.
[time=2674] Go stand over there.
[time=2674] Oh, well don't hurt anybody.
[time=2676] Hey kids.
[time=2676] Matthew.
[time=2678] But thank you for playing video games.
[time=2678] You did that quick, man.
[time=2681] Matthew.
[time=2682] Hey kids.
[time=2683] Matthew right here is playing video games, alright?
[time=2686] And this is his mom over here.
[time=2687] Oh, his mom is really right over there.
[time=2689] But Mitch.
[time=2690] You seem like his mom.
[time=2691] Yeah.
[time=2692] You pretend like you're his mom.
[time=2693] Yeah.
[time=2694] You pretend like you're his mom.
[time=2695] Yeah.
[time=2696] You pretend like you're his mom.
[time=2697] And say, "Matthew, come to dinner." Okay, Matthew.
[time=2699] Now you're going to show all these kids the wrong way to do it, okay?
[time=2702] Real obedience is immediate.
[time=2704] It's like every like this.
[time=2706] Right there.
[time=2707] Boom.
[time=2708] Grace is immediate.
[time=2709] So mom says, "Matthew, it's time to come to dinner." Go.
[time=2712] Am I making spinach and meatloaf?
[time=2713] Spinach and meatloaf, yes.
[time=2716] Matthew, it's time for dinner.
[time=2723] Matthew.
[time=2724] Hi ho.
[time=2727] You see that?
[time=2728] Everybody.
[time=2729] I mean, hey kids.
[time=2730] It might be, "Would you please go clean up your room?" It might be, "It's time for dinner.
[time=2736] Come sit down." Kids, it could be, "Hey, everybody get in the car.
[time=2740] It's time to go to wherever we're going." Whatever it is, when mom says it or when dad says it, God's Word says our obedience has
[time=2748] to be, everybody's snap, has to be immediate.
[time=2752] All right.
[time=2753] Now, one more time.
[time=2754] Ask them to come to dinner.
[time=2755] Watch this gang.
[time=2756] Watch how Matthew responds now.
[time=2758] Matthew, please come to dinner.
[time=2761] Now you go.
[time=2764] Okay, good, good, good, good, good, great, give Matthew a big hand.
[time=2771] Good job, Matthew.
[time=2774] Hey, number one, godly obedience, everybody.
[time=2780] Moms and dads, too.
[time=2781] When God says to do something, kids, listen up, it's immediate right away.
[time=2788] Now listen to this.
[time=2789] Mr. Mitch.
[time=2790] Pastor Mitch is going to tell you the second thing about godly obedience.
[time=2793] Listen up.
[time=2794] Listen, so Jonah turned his feet the wrong way.
[time=2798] God says, "Make your feet go this way." Your mom says, "Come to dinner this way," and you turn your feet the opposite way.
[time=2804] You don't want to do that, all right?
[time=2806] Second thing we're going to talk about is we obey our parents by obeying completely.
[time=2814] And this is going to be a picture of our hands.
[time=2816] Just everybody look at your hands.
[time=2818] All right?
[time=2819] Look at your hands.
[time=2820] It's with our hands that we pick up everything in our room.
[time=2827] It's with our hands that we do all of our homework.
[time=2833] It's with our hands that we sweep out the entire garage.
[time=2838] It's with our hands that we obey completely.
[time=2842] And there's a story in Numbers 20 that I hope will come on the screen of when Moses,
[time=2848] was told by God, he says, "Take that rod in your hands, and you and your brother Aaron
[time=2854] assemble the congregation just like we're assembled here today, and speak to the rock before two million people's eyes that it may yield its water."
[time=2865] So he's supposed to go up to the rock, Moses will go up to the rock with his feet and go up to the rock and say, "Rock, how about some water?" And what to say there, "You shall thus bring forth water for them out of the rock and let the congregation and their be strength." Pretty simple idea.
[time=2882] You're in the desert, right?
[time=2883] Water is important, right?
[time=2885] So what's he do?
[time=2886] So Moses took the rod from before the Lord just as he had commanded him.
[time=2891] He's obeying.
[time=2892] And Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly before the rock, and he said to them, "Listen, now you rebel.
[time=2898] Shall we bring forth water for you out of this rock?" And Moses lifted up his hand and struck the rock twice.
[time=2905] Boom!
[time=2907] Uh-oh.
[time=2908] Where there's rod.
[time=2909] And water came forth abundantly.
[time=2910] Interesting that God comes through anyway, there, isn't that?
[time=2913] And the congregation and their be strength.
[time=2915] Now let me ask you something.
[time=2916] Listen, listen.
[time=2917] Did Moses obey completely the way God asked him to?
[time=2923] Commanded him.
[time=2924] What?
[time=2925] I got a yes?
[time=2926] Anybody else?
[time=2927] No.
[time=2928] Why?
[time=2929] So Moses to do what to the rock?
[time=2933] Talk to it.
[time=2934] Just speak to the rock.
[time=2936] But Moses took his hands, the hands that we take to obey completely, and he disobeyed.
[time=2942] He didn't obey completely because when he got to the rock, he hit it twice, bam, bam!
[time=2949] And two million people and God saw Moses disobey.
[time=2959] And Moses had significant consequences.
[time=2961] He was not allowed to go to the Promised Land where they were headed just because of that disobedience because he did not obey God completely with his hands.
[time=2975] Third thing.
[time=2976] Listen up, gang.
[time=2977] Hey, it's great to have all.
[time=2978] Hey, all you kids, listen.
[time=2979] Thank you so much for coming down here.
[time=2980] All your high school students, thank you.
[time=2982] It means a lot to us.
[time=2984] Middle school students.
[time=2985] Listen.
[time=2986] One last thing.
[time=2987] God honoring obedience is immediate.
[time=2991] It is complete and it is joyful.
[time=2994] It's going to be right there on the screen.
[time=2996] Joyful.
[time=2997] Look at the picture, gang.
[time=2998] See the gallop on the screen?
[time=3000] You see that face right there?
[time=3002] Look at that face.
[time=3003] And now keep that face up there and let's look at Jonah.
[time=3006] Jonah gives us another bad example.
[time=3008] Way to go, Jonah, of both obedience.
[time=3011] Jonah.
[time=3012] God had told Jonah to go and preach to Nineveh.
[time=3015] He finally obeyed him.
[time=3017] He went and preached to Nineveh.
[time=3019] A lot of people came to faith and then we see this in Jonah 4-1.
[time=3023] But it greatly displeased Jonah and he became angry.
[time=3030] You see that?
[time=3031] God said to Jonah, go do this.
[time=3034] Now watch, kids.
[time=3035] He went and did it finally, but he did it with a really bad attitude.
[time=3042] Really bad attitude.
[time=3043] Hey kids, look at this girl's face.
[time=3046] When mom or dad says, hey, it's time to come to dinner.
[time=3050] When mom or dad says, hey, would you please clean up the garage?
[time=3054] When mom or dad says, hey, would you please clean up your room or would you please come with me over here or would you help me in the backyard?
[time=3063] I want all you kids to look up here.
[time=3065] In fact, do this.
[time=3067] All the kids stand up.
[time=3071] And I want all of you kids to face your mom and dad.
[time=3076] Everybody face out that way.
[time=3078] Okay, listen now.
[time=3080] All you kids, all you middle schoolers, all you high schoolers, everybody, all of you,
[time=3086] look out in the audience and face your mom and dad.
[time=3090] Now, and I mean this, I'm not being silly here.
[time=3093] I want you to put a smile on your face.
[time=3096] Look at your mom and dad and smile really big.
[time=3099] And with a really big smile, are you listening?
[time=3102] I want you to say, yes, mom, one, two, three, say it.
[time=3108] Yes, mom.
[time=3109] Okay, parents, were they smiling?
[time=3111] Were they smiling?
[time=3112] Okay, try it again, big smiles, kids.
[time=3115] I want you to say on three, okay, dad, one, two, three.
[time=3119] Okay, dad.
[time=3121] Now, stop and look at me.
[time=3123] Look over here.
[time=3124] Hey, kids.
[time=3125] You know what, sometimes when God asks your mom and dad to do things and when God asks
[time=3131] me and Pastor Mitch to do things, you know what, sometimes we don't want to.
[time=3137] Right, mom and dad?
[time=3140] Sometimes we don't feel like it, right, mom and dad?
[time=3144] But what God's word, gang, is teaching us this morning, is that real obedience, it's complete, it's immediate, and you know what, it has a good attitude.
[time=3153] It smiles even when it might not feel like smile, and it says, okay, God, I'll do it.
[time=3160] And that's what we have to learn this morning.
[time=3163] Listen real carefully to Pastor Mitch, okay, he's going to wrap this up.
[time=3166] Listen, gang.
[time=3167] Can you sit down and seek help?
[time=3168] Have a seat, look up here.
[time=3169] You stand up.
[time=3170] No, okay.
[time=3171] All right, here's how we started.
[time=3174] The posture of disobedience, show him the face, not listening to dad, all right?
[time=3180] Here's the deal.
[time=3181] All right, now we talked about the posture of obedience, feet like Jonah, unlike Jonah,
[time=3188] where God asks you or your parents ask you to put them immediately with your feet, immediately
[time=3194] with your feet, completely with your hands, everybody do this with your hands, completely
[time=3200] with your hands, and joyfully with your face, smiles.
[time=3207] Now let me just tell you something, with Jesus, go ahead and keep your hands out and your smiles on.
[time=3213] With Jesus, all of this flows from the inside out, it flows from your heart.
[time=3219] And here's what happens.
[time=3220] Verse 4, moms and dads, goes on to say, fathers, don't provoke your children to anger, but
[time=3227] use instruction and discipline with them, okay?
[time=3233] So we don't do this, parents.
[time=3235] I told you blah, blah, blah, blah.
[time=3238] We model.
[time=3240] They need to see us model this relationship with God.
[time=3245] And so Kelsey, who has a smile on her face, the feet toward me in the hands, immediate, complete, joyful, sees a dad or a mom, feet towards God, immediate obedience toward God.
[time=3259] He's up and willing to obey completely, and a joyful attitude on the face, all of which
[time=3266] flows from the heart.
[time=3268] See our job as parents is to get ourselves out of a job.
[time=3272] And Hebrews 12, if you want to jot it down, parents, read Hebrews 12, it talks about our face fixed on Jesus.
[time=3279] Goes on later to talk about our hands, obedient to Him, and our feet obedient to Him.
[time=3286] Because here's what happened, parents, if they see, if children see us having feet that obey immediately, having hands that obey completely, having a face that all flows from the heart of humility toward God that obeys joyfully, then this is what happens.
[time=3300] Stay here, joyful face, feet towards me, ends up.
[time=3303] Here's what happens.
[time=3304] Stay there.
[time=3307] She learns our children learn how to do that with God.
[time=3314] See when we parent correctly and we surrender our lives to God, obeying with our feet immediately,
[time=3320] our hands completely, our face joyfully, and they catch this.
[time=3324] This is caught more than taught.
[time=3327] And then our job as parents is to get ourselves out of a job.
[time=3330] Because if we don't do this, if we don't use discipline, if we don't instruct, God disciplines those He loves, He instructs us.
[time=3336] If we don't, we're making a big problem for children's ministry workers.
[time=3340] We're making a big problem for teachers in the schools.
[time=3343] We're making a big problem someday when they're adults, but our job is this, and when they see that model, then they honor God.
[time=3353] And here's our benchmark, kids, here's our benchmark, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus
[time=3360] Christ's heart was obedient to the Father, Philippians 2 says, so obedient it says that
[time=3367] He nailed His feet to the cross.
[time=3370] Now let's hands to the cross with a joyful face and a heart that said, Father forgive
[time=3377] them for they know not what they do.
[time=3381] And that's our benchmark and that's our model, Jesus Christ, for feet who obey, for hands
[time=3388] that obey completely, feet immediately, hands complete in a face that obeys joyfully is
[time=3394] Jesus.
[time=3395] [AMEN] Hey kids, would you all stand up real quietly?
[time=3398] Would you stand up right where you're at?
[time=3402] And would you guys, all of you kids and all of you students, would you just bow your heads?
[time=3406] Would you just bow your heads right where you are, okay?
[time=3409] Just bow your heads.
[time=3410] Everybody bow your heads and close your eyes.
[time=3413] And we want to pray for you today.
[time=3415] We prayed for, we prayed for husbands a couple weeks ago and we want to pray for, we want to pray for kids today.
[time=3424] And I just want to invite all of you here in the room.
[time=3427] You may want to, you may want to slip up and stand next to one.
[time=3430] You can if you'd like to.
[time=3433] Everybody bow your heads and close your eyes and we want to pray for you.
[time=3437] And I want to just point this out to you and the audience today.
[time=3440] On the inside of your bulletin, there's a flyer, there's an insert that says, our kids need prayer.
[time=3445] We asked, here are the needs from their heart, right there on this flyer, on this insert,
[time=3451] are the specific requests that our students gave.
[time=3456] They're asking you and I to pray for them.
[time=3458] And these things right here are the real things that our students asked you and I to pray for.
[time=3465] And so I just want to lift this up and invite you as a family to pray for our students.
[time=3470] And let me, if I can, just now pray for all these kids.
[time=3473] Kids, would you all bow your heads and close your eyes?
[time=3476] There you go.
[time=3477] And let's pray for these kids, shall we, Father, Father in Heaven, we're so thankful for these lives that stand here in the front of this room.
[time=3485] We're so very thankful for the opportunity, the privileged God, that you've given us to love them and to invest in them.
[time=3492] And God, we pray that you'd give us wisdom to do that well.
[time=3496] God, as Mitch said, a lot of this rest with us, as adults, our willingness to live surrendered lives, our willingness to obey immediately, completely, and with a really good attitude.
[time=3508] God, I pray that you would give every mom and dad, every aunt and uncle, every grandma and grandpa and grandma in the room, give us God the courage to live life like that.
[time=3519] So that these little ones and these middle school students and these high school students can see consistency in what we're asking from them, God, that they could see that in our
[time=3529] lives each and every day.
[time=3531] Thank you so very much for this opportunity.
[time=3535] We love you, Lord.
[time=3536] In your son's name we pray, amen.
