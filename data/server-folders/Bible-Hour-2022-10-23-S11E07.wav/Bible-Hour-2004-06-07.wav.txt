[time=91] - Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries, and we're so thankful to have this time with you again.
[time=97] Thank you for tuning in.
[time=98] I am joined today by some good friends, and I am so looking forward to the opportunity for you to get to know them better.
[time=107] We'll do this more in the future, kind of introducing more and more of our team here at Black Hawk.
[time=111] To those of you who really are a part of our family.
[time=114] And today I'm joined by Corbin Miller, who is our worship pastor and Beth Armstrong, who is our visual arts coordinator.
[time=123] The one who oversees all of what takes place visually here.
[time=127] And I ask these two to join me because as many of you know, we care a lot about these 70 minutes that we get on a Sunday morning.
[time=137] This time of corporate worship, it means a lot to us and we try very hard to be diligent and faithful, to do that in a way that would honor God.
[time=146] Obviously the role that I play, the role that Mitch and Steve play as teaching pastors, we try our best to bring the scriptures to life.
[time=155] We try to teach and preach and proclaim the truth as best we can.
[time=160] But there are others like Corbin and Beth who play a role in that as well.
[time=165] Most of you sense that and see that, but I just wanted to make sure you maybe you could get today an insight into how it happens and more importantly why it happens.
[time=174] And so Corbin, let me just start with you.
[time=177] Share with the people just why it is that we spend so much time and make such an effort.
[time=184] Why does it mean so much to us that musically we would try and support the message in those 70 minutes?
[time=190] There's a lot that goes into the musical side of that.
[time=193] Why do we work so hard at that?
[time=195] And what do you enjoy about being able to be a part of that process?
[time=200] - I think the reason that we work so hard is because what we do is unique to the relationship with God in a little bit different way than what you do.
[time=211] I see your role as being one where you get to teach and communicate God's heart that he's expressed through his word to his people.
[time=218] And then after that, you know, later on in the week or later on that day or whatever, people have the opportunity to respond to that word.
[time=226] What we get to do in 30 minutes or so is to get a picture of who God is from scripture and from songs written about him and then to respond immediately with devotion and adoration and exaltation and lifting our voices.
[time=241] And it's this really intimate communication tool that we can use through music to sing corporately to our God.
[time=248] - That's cool.
[time=249] And you enjoy it, don't you?
[time=251] - I do.
[time=252] - How long have you been doing it?
[time=254] - Here at Black Hawk.
[time=254] - Just a little over two years.
[time=256] So I still feel real new at it.
[time=258] And, but I'm enjoying the process and learning a ton myself about how to do that the best way possible to lead others to that place of communication with God.
[time=269] - And you've got a great team of people around you, don't you?
[time=271] - Oh yeah.
[time=271] - Yeah.
[time=272] - Unbelievable.
[time=273] I couldn't do it without them, that's for sure.
[time=275] - And I don't know what, I don't know what you all think, but I've told Corbin this before.
[time=278] I think in some ways, I feel like we're almost over blessed on the musical front, be it vocal or instrumental.
[time=286] God just seems to have given us an amazing pool of people with huge hearts and great talent.
[time=292] - Yep. - It's so encouraging to see them use that to support this worship effort.
[time=298] - All volunteering their time and giving them their hearts.
[time=301] - Absolutely.
[time=302] So I'm doing our best, you know, I'm doing my best to teach and communicate.
[time=306] Corbin and this amazing team comes in musically in that artistic form supports it.
[time=312] But then we've got Beth and her team and what they do visually, all the set designs that you see, all the different colors, all the different staging, the lighting, all of that.
[time=323] There's a lot of effort put into that.
[time=325] And sometimes people ask me and I'll just kind of pose the question to Beth, why Beth do we work so hard at that?
[time=332] What is it about the visual arts and the worship setting?
[time=337] Why would we put so much time and effort and resource towards supporting our effort visually?
[time=344] What about that is important?
[time=346] - Well, I think just like in everything that people are different and just like people learn differently, some through hearing, some through seeing that people connect with God in different ways.
[time=357] And as a programming team, I think we try really hard to use all the tools that we have to include elements that are gonna help everybody to engage in worship.
[time=367] And so we just do our best to help them do that.
[time=372] So visually if it's like lighting changes to create a mood or set pieces that kind of promote a theme or video or images that kind of create word pictures for people, it just kind of enhances what's already going on in the worship service.
[time=389] And I think it can help some of those people who are more visual.
[time=392] - Yeah, so some would connect visually, not everybody in the room.
[time=397] Some are gonna connect, yeah, and that's good.
[time=399] Some are gonna connect musically.
[time=400] Some connect to the spoken word, but there's a whole audience out there who visually are helped when we create images and settings that draw them into what we're doing.
[time=411] We thought we could just maybe share with you all kind of an instance, an actual situation where this happened.
[time=417] I was doing my part.
[time=418] I was studying God's word preparing to teach it, came across a passage in Malachi that talks about how brokenhearted God was by the fact that his people were not bringing him all that they had, the offerings, the sacrifice that they were bringing.
[time=435] It wasn't in any way, shape, or form, a real representation of what was in them.
[time=442] They were in a sense ripping God off by bringing him lame and blind and broken lambs and sacrifices.
[time=449] And so I was talking to Corbin about that in my office and we began to dialogue about how we wanted our people here at Blackhawk to know what it would mean to really bring him our all.
[time=461] So he leaves my office, disappears to wherever he disappears to when he thinks about these things.
[time=467] And he comes back in a few days and tell them what God had done in your heart there.
[time=472] - A couple of phrases that Kelly had said really stuck out to me.
[time=475] One of the phrases that he used when he was describing this to me was, you know, it's kind of an all or none deal.
[time=481] Either you bring it all or you just leave it because God doesn't want your lame and your broken and your poor.
[time=486] And so I latched onto that phrase and just started playing around with some chords and fashioning some lyrics around that phrase and a song kind of poured out one afternoon.
[time=496] - Tell him, sing it for him or just play it for him and we'll give him a taste at it.
[time=500] (guitar music) [MUSIC - 38 seconds]
[time=546] - And that's kind of the catchphrase then.
[time=547] - Yeah, so he's singing that for me.
[time=549] I'm going, wow, he wrote that.
[time=551] He taught it to our band and our choir and our vocalists and we were able to then actually bring it to one of our worship services.
[time=557] You've heard the song now, oftentimes.
[time=559] Well then Beth, she brings her gift and talent to the mix.
[time=564] She hears the song, she begins to think that through and play it again, Corbin, as Corbin's playing it, Beth's listening and then she brings to that Sunday morning setting these pictures.
[time=577] This is kind of a PowerPoint presentation.
[time=580] Pictures that capture the essence of the truth of the song visually and you're gonna see it here this morning on a clip and as you see it, we'll say goodbye and we'll just say to you how thankful we are for the chance to do this, for this family of which you're a part of.
[time=599] We're so grateful that you tune in and we hope you'll be encouraged.
[time=604] [MUSIC]
[time=608] - Well five weeks ago, we began a series
[time=622] that we entitled for better or for worse.
[time=625] God's designed for marriage and family.
[time=628] And the response from you, the family here at Black Hawk and the response from the Bible Hour television audience has been overwhelming.
[time=638] The cards, the notes, the emails, the letters, the hallway, conversations, all of it has been even more than we ever anticipated.
[time=648] From sexual purity and relational health prior to marriage, which was in those first couple of weeks to the role of the husband and his call to lovingly lead his wife and family to where we were last week in children and the divine design of immediate, complete and joyful obedience, all of it together up until this point has, I believe, caused many of us to stand up and take notice.
[time=676] Many of you in this room have responded and you've responded because I believe something deep down in your soul is stirred when you come face to face with that which is true and right about marriage and family.
[time=689] I think many of you in the room did I know what I know and believe in my heart and that is that a healthy God honoring marriage, a healthy God honoring family when we are able to with his help and because of his strength which he provides when we're able to give ourselves to a healthy God honoring home, that is what lies at the core of not only a healthy church, not only a healthy biblical community, that is a God honoring home, a God honoring family, that's at the core of a healthy society.
[time=720] And you and I know that the state of our society, the state of our culture today in many respects is due to what is not happening.
[time=733] In marriage and family.
[time=735] And our lives and in the lives of those across the world.
[time=739] And so we have been stirred, reminded.
[time=743] And many who have heard these messages have been convicted because it's because what is true about marriage and family, what is true about God's design, what is true about the marital relationship and what is true about the way the home is to function and look.
[time=761] And where so many find themselves today in this society and maybe even here in this room, you see the truth about God's design for marriage and family and the reality of where so many find themselves today, see many have been convicted because what this space in the middle represents is a growing chasm of compromise, a growing separation between his design and how we are.
[time=791] Due to the sin and rebellion and man's attempt to redesign and fix what didn't need fixing.
[time=801] And that attempt to redesign that's been going on for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years as people have responded against God's design for marriage and family.
[time=816] One of my fears early on in this series, one of my fears and even thinking through this series and I'll just admit that to you as I've continued to kind of get on my knees and ask for his help and his guidance and his insight.
[time=830] I have to admit the fear has somewhat subsided but I got to tell you that at the beginning of this, one of my fears was that I know because of my studies, I know because of what I've read, I know because of what I've been taught but God's design for marriage and family people is so absolutely counterculture.
[time=849] It is so contrary.
[time=852] When I stand here or Steve or Mitch or somebody else would stand here and talk about God's design for a man.
[time=859] God's design for a wife honoring husband.
[time=863] The picture that I know God's word is going to paint is absolutely counter, it's absolutely contrary to what you and I would be being told today.
[time=875] Makes up a real man.
[time=876] You see, when we talk about marriage, when we talk about parenting, which we will in the next few weeks, when we talk about this design of God's for wives as we will today, see it as absolutely foreign, we have been you and I, we have been so inundated, we have been so affected by our minds and our thinking and our opinions and our perspectives have been so tainted at times by culture instead of the truth that there was this little fear in me.
[time=909] That as we would proclaim what is true and right, somehow you and I would cringe.
[time=914] And I'm so very thankful that so many of you and even myself as I've given myself to this study, there's been less and less cringing and there has been more and more rejoicing.
[time=928] We've been challenged and I believe we will continue to be but we, so many of us in the room today are realizing that God's design is right and God's design is true and God gave us the design because God loves us and He wants our lives and our marriages and our families and our homes to have everything He intended and it's only gonna happen when we do it His way.
[time=952] So in God's design, what have we said so far?
[time=957] In God's design, we said first of all husbands, husbands love their wives, they love them sacrificially, that was the bottom line.
[time=968] We looked at Ephesians chapter five and we realized that the love of a husband for his wife is tireless, it is faithful and it is sacrificial and he loves her tirelessly and faithfully and sacrificially in the spiritual arena, in the emotional arena, in the physical arena, he exists to do whatever he can to love, meaningfully give himself to and care for this woman, this gift that God has given him.
[time=996] Somebody last week, I think it was, came up and gave me a, I was a friend who came up and gave me something to read and I read it this week and just thought I'd share it with you.
[time=1007] For all you guys, just a reiteration of that Hebrews,
[time=1013] Ephesians five kind of love, it's a story and a publication and it goes like this recently.
[time=1019] I heard a story which really struck home, apparently a woman was driving her husband's classic BMW for a special appointment downtown.
[time=1027] The car had been his life and joy, he spent hours finding original replacement parts, tuning the engine, fixing minor dentists, waxing the car, he worked on it a little bit every single Saturday and many evenings and the car was an absolute beauty.
[time=1042] As she drove the car that day, suddenly someone changed lanes and nearly pulled into her.
[time=1046] To avoid crashing, she swerved to the right just as a big truck drove up beside her, she demolished the bumper, put a crease along the entire passenger side door and dented the fender of her husband's classic car.
[time=1061] What would he say?
[time=1064] How could he ever forgive her?
[time=1066] If she had only been a little bit more careful, these were her thoughts.
[time=1071] Shortly a policeman arrived to take an accident report, she got out her driver's license and reached into the glove compartment to get the insurance papers entitled to her surprise there was another smaller envelope inside the glove compartment with her name on it.
[time=1085] The writing was her husband's, a fearful sweat suddenly hit her.
[time=1092] What would it say?
[time=1094] He had often warned her about driving more carefully, she opened the letter and began to read it.
[time=1098] Dear Lori, it started.
[time=1100] If you are reading this, you have likely had an accident.
[time=1104] (audience laughing) Don't worry, it went on.
[time=1111] I trust that you're reading this means that you are all right and that is what really matters to me.
[time=1121] Don't worry about the car, Lori, it's only metal, rubber and plastic.
[time=1127] You are what really matters.
[time=1130] I love you, James.
[time=1132] What a husband.
[time=1137] He strengthened his wife's love and admiration for him and his marriage with a sacrificial note and the article concludes as their room for a note in your glove box.
[time=1147] See in God's design, men, we sacrifice all
[time=1153] to do whatever we can to communicate to her our deep and abiding love for her.
[time=1160] In God's design, children, we looked at this last week, what a great morning we had.
[time=1165] In God's design, children obey their parents.
[time=1168] Four-year-old children, 14-year-old children, seven-year-olds and 17-year-olds, 10-year-olds and 20-year-olds.
[time=1177] Children obey their parents and biblical obedience.
[time=1181] We saw a mint that obedience is immediate.
[time=1184] It is complete and it is full of joy.
[time=1186] In God's design, husbands love their wives, children obey their parents and in God's design this morning, we look at what the Scriptures say to wives.
[time=1198] And wives, what the word of God says is that in God's design, wives submit to their husbands.
[time=1205] That's right.
[time=1207] God's original intent and God's design for marriage is that you as a wife would be willing to live in submission with your husband.
[time=1217] Follow this along, would you please, carefully, please take note as equally valued and mutually honored beings in the sight of God.
[time=1228] The God-honoring wife, she willingly chooses to allow him small-age to lead.
[time=1235] She willingly chooses to allow him to lead.
[time=1238] The God-honoring wife, she shows respect and she defers to him small-age in the day-to-day of life.
[time=1246] Unless, of course, he small-age is asking her to sin to be engaged in sinful activity at which point she would defer to him, capital H-I-M.
[time=1260] You see, the God-honoring wife who wants nothing more than to follow God's design, purposes in her heart to follow and come along with him.
[time=1269] Small-age, not as a doormat, not as a wimp, not without speaking the truth and love if necessary and not without seeking godly counsel at times, but nonetheless she's willing to come along to central Florida, across town, to whatever it might be, to whatever it might look like because she is an obedient, trusting child of him, H, capital H-I-M.
[time=1297] The God-honoring wife trusts his design first
[time=1304] and then lives with him small-age as a helper.
[time=1308] In kindness, respect and humility, period.
[time=1313] And then lives with him as a helper.
[time=1317] In kindness, I'll say that again, in kindness, in respect and humility.
[time=1323] It's interesting to note if you go back to the beginning of all of this, which I'm gonna invite you to do now, turn to Genesis chapter two.
[time=1332] As you go back to the very beginning of God's design for all of life and mankind, in this arena of the husband and wife, we see some very helpful words recorded for us in Genesis chapter two.
[time=1345] It's interesting to note there at the end of that quote, she was given to the man by God as a helper.
[time=1351] As a helper, ladies, that word, helper, the thought of it, the picture of it.
[time=1355] Many times can conjure up all kinds of pictures and all kinds of feelings.
[time=1361] Let's look and see where that came from.
[time=1362] Genesis chapter two, verses 15 through 18.
[time=1367] And in honor of God's word, would you stand with me and can we just read this?
[time=1372] I'll read and you follow along.
[time=1374] Genesis chapter two, verses 15 to 18.
[time=1376] Then the Lord God took the man who at this point in the story is alone, right?
[time=1382] Then the Lord God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to cultivate it and keep it.
[time=1390] The Lord God commanded the man saying, "From any tree of the garden you may eat freely, "but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, "you shall not eat.
[time=1401] "For in the day that you eat from it, "you will surely die." God draws a line.
[time=1407] God begins to enforce his design.
[time=1411] And he says this to the who, to the man.
[time=1414] He says this to Adam.
[time=1417] And he's very, very clear with Adam.
[time=1421] What will happen?
[time=1422] And the responsibility that God is giving him.
[time=1425] To honor and protect this command.
[time=1429] Well, then he goes on, look at verse 18.
[time=1431] Then the Lord God said, as he looks at the situation, as he observes this man in the garden and all that he was doing, God says it is not good.
[time=1441] Then the Lord God said, it is not good for the man to be alone.
[time=1446] I will make him a helper, suitable for him.
[time=1451] Would you pray with me?
[time=1453] Father, God, as we come to these words here in the Scriptures, God, as we come to this study of a God-honoring wife who is willing to not only honor and follow you, but her husband as well.
[time=1466] God, I pray that you would, your spirit would, that your word would reach deep into the hearts of every woman, every wife, every man and husband in this room.
[time=1476] God, that we would collectively together open ourselves up.
[time=1481] Maybe at levels.
[time=1483] Maybe at depths that for years and years have remained closed.
[time=1488] God, that your spirit would do a unique work in each and every life in this room.
[time=1495] And God, that for those who are here married, for those who are wives in our midst, God, that you would in a special way, bring a clarity of thought, a revelation of truth.
[time=1507] God, that they would today see, maybe for the first time, the beginnings of what this picture is really supposed to entail, what it's supposed to really look like.
[time=1517] Not because I said it, but because God, you recorded it.
[time=1520] You designed it, and it's a good design because you're a good God whose love for us surpasses anything we could ever imagine.
[time=1529] And so God, do your work.
[time=1531] Change us and transform us and allow us to understand better God, you've called us to live in your son's name, we pray.
[time=1540] [AMEN] You can be seated.
[time=1542] Hey, I think it's worth pointing out there and that Genesis 2 passage that we just looked at.
[time=1549] And I would say this to guys, and I would say this to the ladies.
[time=1552] Don't miss this.
[time=1553] God looks at the situation, folks.
[time=1557] He looks at the situation and God's assessment of this man placed into the garden is that it's not good.
[time=1567] God's assessment of this guy.
[time=1569] God's assessment of Adam's situation is that it's not going well.
[time=1573] He needed help.
[time=1575] He wasn't complete.
[time=1578] It was beginning to be clearly noted that he needed more than he had.
[time=1585] He wasn't gonna make it.
[time=1586] And so in God's design, God brings a helper.
[time=1591] God brings a complete err.
[time=1595] Who needed help?
[time=1596] Who needed help, guys?
[time=1600] Man.
[time=1601] Man, king of the jungle, George, right?
[time=1605] Place there to be the significant overseer of all that lived.
[time=1609] It wasn't gonna go so well.
[time=1613] We needed help.
[time=1617] And so God gave a helper.
[time=1621] It's not gonna be on the screen, I don't think, but that same chapter, look at verse 21.
[time=1626] So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man and he slept.
[time=1632] Then he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh at that place, and the Lord God fashioned into a woman, the rib which he had taken from the man and brought her to the man.
[time=1645] Don't want you to look at that.
[time=1648] Ladies, I don't know how you feel about the word helper.
[time=1654] I don't know how you feel necessarily about this whole interaction there in Genesis two, but I want you to notice something.
[time=1659] He didn't just snap his fingers and come up with something.
[time=1663] He could have, 'cause he's God, he could have just gone, boom, woman.
[time=1670] But I want you to note, and the Hebrew, it really brings it out.
[time=1674] The Lord God fashioned into a woman.
[time=1679] In the words of scripture, he fashioned her.
[time=1681] It means he sculpted her.
[time=1684] He paid attention to the lines.
[time=1686] He worked at it.
[time=1687] He created a work of art, mentally, emotionally, physically and spiritually.
[time=1693] She was and is today a masterpiece that God graciously gave to one who was in need, that God graciously still today gives to those of us who are still in need, needing to be completed, needing to be helped 'cause we needed.
[time=1713] Guys, in all honesty, you know, I would encourage you to take a minute right here and think about what she brings.
[time=1722] The kind of help that your wife offers.
[time=1727] I know if I just stop and think about it for a few minutes, which I did this week, several things came to my mind.
[time=1734] Many things came to my mind.
[time=1736] I think about my own wife and these 17 years and what she, by God's grace and with His help, brings to the relationship and to the situation of our life.
[time=1748] She brings intuition.
[time=1749] She brings an intuition that I cannot understand to this day how she understands and foresees and has a sense for things that are coming or that are happening.
[time=1762] It's amazing and much needed.
[time=1764] She brings clarity.
[time=1765] She brings timely wisdom.
[time=1767] She brings the sensitivity of heart.
[time=1769] She brings insight.
[time=1770] She brings quiet strength.
[time=1772] Sometimes it's a loud strength, but nonetheless, it's strength.
[time=1777] She brings perspective.
[time=1781] And you know why I need it so desperately because I'm not always right.
[time=1785] Newsflash.
[time=1787] I'm not, I'm not always right.
[time=1792] I'm wrong so many times.
[time=1794] And there are times when I even, I even really, really, really think and throw.
[time=1800] I mean, there's times I really, really, really get my, my arms around this deal and whether it's a kid thing or whether it's a future thing or whether it's a relationship.
[time=1808] I mean, there's times I really, really dial in on this thing and I know that I've got this thing right and this is where we're going.
[time=1817] And there's times where that quiet strength, there's times when that intuition, there's times where that ability to bring clarity just kind of says kind of overnight, not over in the corner.
[time=1831] 'Cause that's not where she lives with me.
[time=1834] 'Cause we're mutually honored and mutually valued and we're in this together and there's times we're right behind my side.
[time=1841] I hear the whisper in my ear, you're wrong.
[time=1844] Or, wait a minute, let's think about this.
[time=1855] See, we need it desperately.
[time=1857] And I would just hope that as a woman, I would hope that as a wife, as you, I don't know how good a job I just did of painting that picture, but I would certainly hope that that wouldn't leave you feeling demeaned or diminished in any sense.
[time=1873] And I realize a lot of that has to do with how
[time=1879] I respond to the, hey, wait a minute, you know?
[time=1885] And you know, I realize he may not respond.
[time=1888] Well, I know I don't all the time.
[time=1891] But nonetheless, as we begin to see this role, as we begin to see this picture painted, I hope you're realizing from the very beginning that you were not an afterthought.
[time=1902] Stu Weber says it so well.
[time=1905] In his book, "Tender Warrior," which I would highly recommend, Stu Weber and his book, "Tender Warrior." He says, "This helper, ladies." He says, "Don't, please don't be bothered by this." He says, "Help her is a majestic term.
[time=1918] A woman is a lifesaver.
[time=1920] A helper, suitable or corresponding to the man." That's another way of saying she's no duplicate.
[time=1927] She's not the same, not a clone.
[time=1929] A woman is not a man with redesigned plumbing.
[time=1932] There's no redundancy here.
[time=1933] She is woman.
[time=1934] She is glorious.
[time=1935] She is beautiful.
[time=1937] She is creative and she is different.
[time=1939] Adam didn't need a buddy.
[time=1941] He didn't need a fishing partner or another guy to race elephants with.
[time=1945] Man needed a woman.
[time=1949] And she is the all important rest of the story.
[time=1954] And so as we begin to see his design unfolding, we see that in God's design, she follows.
[time=1962] She's willing to offer herself.
[time=1964] She helps.
[time=1966] She trusts.
[time=1967] She submits.
[time=1968] She lovingly brings all that God has gifted her with and God has gifted her with much.
[time=1974] And she willingly brings all that God has gifted her with to help one who was in need and is still in need today.
[time=1982] So if that's the design, I mean in a nutshell,
[time=1991] if that's the design and if that's from God
[time=1998] and if that's how God intended for this thing to work well, you know, then why is it that in the heart and soul of every wife in this room, there is this kind of innate, down deep inside sense that that is one of the scariest, most unsettling endeavors you've ever heard of.
[time=2021] I mean, if in fact, that's the loving God's design
[time=2027] for the way this is to function, why is it so unsettling?
[time=2032] Why for so many in the room today is it such a scary endeavor?
[time=2036] And you know what?
[time=2037] Not just scary, not just a scary unsettling endeavor, but why this?
[time=2041] Why?
[time=2042] And let's say we'll be honest here.
[time=2044] We'll just kind of have a little honest communication here.
[time=2046] There's no wrist slapping involved.
[time=2049] There's no shame on you here at all.
[time=2051] We're just gonna say the truth, okay?
[time=2053] Not only is it scary unsettling, but why as a wife, if you're honest, down deep inside of you, do you often sense this compulsion, this tendency to really, if truth be told, do the exact opposite of trust.
[time=2071] Do the exact opposite of follow.
[time=2073] Do the exact opposite of submit.
[time=2076] Why is that?
[time=2077] If it's his design and he's as good as he is, and we know that, why the fear and why the unsettled spirit and why even the just flat out, you know what, I don't wanna do that.
[time=2090] In fact, I wanna do the opposite.
[time=2093] Many of you in the room know the answer to that.
[time=2100] Others of you in the room may be helped a bit, encouraged somewhat by the insight that the scriptures bring to that very question.
[time=2108] And for the answer, we gotta turn just a page over to Genesis chapter three.
[time=2112] Go to Genesis chapter three, we're gonna pick it up in verse four, in verses one, two and three, Eve, the wife, Eve, the woman has encountered the enemy himself.
[time=2125] Satan himself has taken the form of a crafty worm, a serpent is what he's called, and they are there in the garden having a discussion in which the serpent is beginning to tempt Eve with the first temptation, the temptation to eat from the tree that God said to Adam.
[time=2143] Adam has obviously now passed that on to Eve, and God said, don't do it, and hear the serpent and Eve are having this discussion in which he's tempting her to go ahead and step over that line.
[time=2156] The serpent said, verse four to the woman, you surely will not die.
[time=2163] The serpent says to the woman the same thing he says to you and I today, you gotta be kidding me, he says to you.
[time=2170] He whispers that in your ear, he whispers that into your soul, he says to you and to me on these issues of divine clarity, you gotta be kidding me.
[time=2180] He says to you and me, you believe that?
[time=2182] You think God's gonna do that to you?
[time=2185] You think God's gonna allow that to happen?
[time=2188] Come on, come on, he says.
[time=2191] The serpent said to the woman, you surely will not die, for God knows that in the day you eat from it, your eyes, he says to the wife, your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.
[time=2207] All God's vision, all God's power, all that God, you can have it.
[time=2213] He says, just eat it.
[time=2215] And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one wise, she took from its fruit and she ate.
[time=2229] And then the biggest, really the biggest tragedy is revealed.
[time=2234] The worst thing about this passage,
[time=2241] so many times we read this passage and we say, oh shame on Eve, look what she did.
[time=2247] She brought sin into the world.
[time=2251] Ah, that woman, well you know what,
[time=2257] Eve made a really bad choice.
[time=2259] Eve crossed over a line that she should not have, and she did it willingly, and she did it knowingly, and she did it willfully.
[time=2269] But the thing about it that's absolutely heartbreaking
[time=2275] is the rest of that verse.
[time=2276] She took from its fruit and ate and she gave also to her husband, and we've talked about this before, who was, what's it say, who was where?
[time=2289] Cross the garden somewhere, did she have to go get him?
[time=2293] Did she have to go get him?
[time=2296] No.
[time=2297] He was right where?
[time=2300] It was right there.
[time=2301] Watching, listening, observing, the absolute demise and debacle of his wife.
[time=2311] And he didn't lift a fist.
[time=2314] He didn't raise his voice.
[time=2316] He didn't do a thing.
[time=2318] He was, you know what he was guys?
[time=2322] He was what you and I are.
[time=2324] So many times when we're not quite sure what to do, when we're a little afraid of how to act, when we haven't got it all figured out.
[time=2334] You know, he did there what you and I so oftentimes do in the midst of crisis.
[time=2341] He said what?
[time=2343] Nothing.
[time=2344] It's called the silence of Adam.
[time=2348] And it lives with you and I today, men.
[time=2352] It's part of what we struggle with.
[time=2356] It's part of what we face.
[time=2358] And his sin, the sin of his silence was as gross and as abominable as her overt rebellion.
[time=2366] The ball was dropped equally, but she did sin.
[time=2374] You want to know why you cringe, gals?
[time=2380] Why does the hair on the back of some women's neck stand up?
[time=2383] Why does the notion of submitting, helping and following a husband evokes such anger and hostility and some?
[time=2389] Not all, I realize, but in so many.
[time=2392] Why?
[time=2393] Number one, you can write this down, the curse.
[time=2395] Look at verse 16.
[time=2396] We were just there in Genesis three, four to seven.
[time=2400] Look at verse 16.
[time=2401] Here's the result.
[time=2402] God says to the woman.
[time=2403] He said, "I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth.
[time=2406] In pain, you will bring forth children." And you're thinking, "Wait a minute, that could have been done painless.
[time=2414] That could have been done easily." Yeah, I guess so.
[time=2420] But here's the real kicker.
[time=2423] "In pain, you will bring forth children, yet your desire will be for your husband and he will rule over you." That phrase in the Hebrew there, "Your desire will be for your husband." That's not physical, that's not a sexual thing.
[time=2438] That phrase there in the Hebrew clearly relates to this idea of rule.
[time=2444] It clearly speaks to this issue of control.
[time=2447] It definitely, biblically and exegetically, no matter how you slice it, that phrase, that part of the curse says you will, for the rest of your days as a wife, want to be in control.
[time=2461] I have to, every day of my life,
[time=2469] battle the silence of Adam.
[time=2471] Every husband in this room, every day of his life,
[time=2477] has to battle and needs to battle aggressively.
[time=2480] Our proneness to silence, not leading,
[time=2486] not loving, not stepping forward.
[time=2488] Every wife in this room will, for the rest of your days, battle with, wanting to control your husband.
[time=2496] Why do so many cringe number one?
[time=2502] You can just write it down, the curse.
[time=2504] Secondly, I'll just say this to you and then we'll move on.
[time=2507] This is all still under kind of introduction.
[time=2510] Secondly, biblical submission is cringed at, mocked, and oftentimes abandoned due to the wholesale acceptance by some of culture's main message to women.
[time=2521] A second reason why so many respond so negatively,
[time=2527] and with anger and with such malice toward this idea of biblical submission is that there has been kind of this wholesale acceptance of culture's main and ongoing and consistent message to wives, to women, and that message is this.
[time=2543] Here you go, kind of brought into it, just to not just kind of clarify it here in a few words.
[time=2548] Here's the message of culture to women today.
[time=2551] You deserve to be happy.
[time=2554] You deserve to be happy and you deserve to experience the life you want.
[time=2561] And do whatever you've got to do, say whatever you've got to say, act, however you need to act, go wherever you need to go, because dog gone it, you deserve to be happy and you deserve the life you want.
[time=2575] Happy, happy as defined by you.
[time=2580] So then many wives will turn and point at him,
[time=2587] little h, me, other guys in this room.
[time=2590] Many wives will then turn and point to him, full of, watch this now, and I can speak to this, okay?
[time=2597] I'm the poster boy of the average guy.
[time=2600] Full of failure, full of faults.
[time=2605] Absolutely, the list is long of the things that don't get done, the things that don't get said, the things that don't get communicated, the things that are not conveyed, that should be, that need to be.
[time=2617] She turns and she points at him with all of his faults and failures and says, you expect me to follow and trust and submit to and come alongside and help kindly him?
[time=2628] You expect me to give myself to that?
[time=2634] No, no, no, she says, not gonna do it.
[time=2642] See, if I did that, I wouldn't be happy.
[time=2646] It's how it goes.
[time=2648] If I did that, I wouldn't be happy.
[time=2650] I wouldn't be having a good time and I would jeopardize the plans that I have for the way I want my life to look.
[time=2657] And by the way, they'll say back to you, what if he screws up?
[time=2661] What if I did trust him?
[time=2663] What if I did give myself to him?
[time=2665] What if I did and give to him my heart and my feelings and my willingness to come along and what if he messes it up?
[time=2673] No, no, no, no, she says, I'm going to maintain some unusually large amounts of control.
[time=2682] Because I deserve to be happy and I deserve the life I want.
[time=2685] And so there are some, not all, but there are some who step then out of God's design
[time=2695] and subtly begin to open themselves to the temptations and schemes of the enemy.
[time=2702] 'Cause that's how God designed it.
[time=2707] Ladies, men, kids, a good friend of mine oftentimes says this and reminds me of it.
[time=2716] The whole submission picture, whoever we're talking to, the whole submission, God's intent with this principle of submission again and again and again, it is to protect us.
[time=2729] It is to keep us within the sphere of what he has designed and what he has allowed and what he will do.
[time=2735] And the author, Calvin Miller says it so well, read this and read this carefully.
[time=2742] Would you, Calvin Miller says this, Satan never gains advantage when we are submissive.
[time=2747] Stop right there.
[time=2748] I want you to just read that and think about that and look at that.
[time=2751] Satan, people, Satan never gains.
[time=2754] He can't.
[time=2756] It's the way he gets his advantage when you and I are unwilling to submit.
[time=2763] When we step out of the parameter world that God has provided us with, when we step out of it, he goes, okay, now I got one on her own.
[time=2774] I've got one on his own, here I go.
[time=2776] And you watch him gain advantage.
[time=2779] Satan never gains advantage when we are submissive.
[time=2782] Our surrender gives God a chance to fight for us.
[time=2787] Are we not forever touched by our Lord's submission
[time=2793] to the cross?
[time=2798] When we see striving, we find ourselves, when we see striving, when we see controlling, when we see manipulating, when we see doing our own thing, when we see striving, we find ourselves in a position to watch God act.
[time=2815] And at the end, that's so powerful.
[time=2821] And at the end of our controlling ways with a humble admission of our helplessness, we meet a more than capable God who has our best in mind.
[time=2837] And I know because of what I deal with, I know because of what I see, I know because of what I interact with on a regular basis that that last sentence is so important because so many times, especially with wives, they come to points, they come to places of desperation, they come to these arenas where it has really, really been hard, it has really been scary, it has really been unsettling for a long, long time, and they begin to slowly but surely step out of those parameters and they become convinced that he's not capable.
[time=2876] And the fact of the matter is that we live
[time=2882] in a relationship with a God who is capable of protecting and guiding and bringing meaning and life in ways you and I would never, ever guess.
[time=2894] That quote reminds me, that quote actually,
[time=2900] I believe was born out of 1 Peter 2, would you turn there?
[time=2902] You can't think these thoughts people, you can't go down this line of thinking and reasoning without going to the example of our Lord in 1 Peter 2 verses 21 to 23.
[time=2916] Please, please open your heart this morning to what the truth would say, the picture, the truth would paint for you today in whatever situation you might be and look at 1 Peter 2 21 to 23 for you have been called, this is you and me, for we as believers, Christ followers have been called for this purpose since Christ also suffered for you leaving you an example.
[time=2944] It's the only place in the New Testament where the Lord it says leaves you and I an example in the one place that scripture says he leaves an example for you and I, the one place it has to do with submission and godly suffering, leaving you an example for you to follow in his steps.
[time=2964] He who committed no sin nor was any deceit found in his mouth and while being reviled, while they did all that they did to him, while they beat him, while they mocked him, while they spit on him, while they crucified him, while being reviled he did not revile in return.
[time=2982] While suffering he uttered no threats, none.
[time=2987] But here it is, but kept entrusting himself to him
[time=2993] who judges righteously, who in the end will take care of it all, who is in the end and who is now more than capable of keeping his arms around you.
[time=3005] And so I wanna show you wives today, this picture
[time=3012] and before you respond or before you think my goodness, what's he doing?
[time=3017] Let me just explain this to you.
[time=3019] You see this is a picture I showed the husbands a few weeks ago, it was a powerful moment that morning as men all over this room began to look and see a real picture of real love.
[time=3029] I showed it to the husbands to illustrate the lengths to which we should go to humbly and sacrificially love our wives because Ephesians 5 said husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church.
[time=3042] Not sorta like he did, but do it like he did.
[time=3047] And so we looked in amazement at this picture.
[time=3052] And as men I said to you, this is the lengths to which we should go.
[time=3056] You're getting weary, look at that picture.
[time=3061] It's not always reciprocated, look at that picture.
[time=3064] I show it to you wives today.
[time=3071] And it has absolutely nothing to do with what you should endure.
[time=3077] This isn't about being beaten, this isn't about being mistreated.
[time=3081] Please don't even go there.
[time=3083] I show it to you wives today because submission and trusting and following is sometimes a very scary, very unsettling, terrifying journey.
[time=3097] But you, like our Lord, have a God, have a Father who is more than capable.
[time=3106] More than you could ever conjure up, more than you could ever imagine.
[time=3112] And I'll tell you what, if Christ's submission had anything to do with little H?
[time=3121] I mean, just think about it, just for a moment.
[time=3123] If Christ's submission had anything at all to do with the centurion, if it had anything at all to do with the high priest or the Pharisees, if Christ's submission had anything to do at all with any relationship horizontally, well, he's running for the hills.
[time=3138] I mean, he even said in the garden, no, please God, if there's a way I can get around this or away from this, let it happen.
[time=3145] And God said, no, we're gonna go through it.
[time=3147] And you're gonna go through whatever it's gonna feel like, whatever it's gonna taste like, whatever it's going to entail, we're gonna go through it together.
[time=3155] I will hold you up.
[time=3157] And he submits himself to one very, very capable of seeing him through it.
[time=3169] And God's designed for wives is that they would live with a submissive spirit in relationship to their husbands.
[time=3180] And so let's turn to God's word, as we always do around here.
[time=3185] Let's look at the scriptures.
[time=3186] And let's turn there now, we'll get there next week, but I want you to look with me at first Peter chapter three verses one to six.
[time=3194] This is so significant because don't miss this.
[time=3196] First Peter, first Peter three, verses one to six, God's designed for wives.
[time=3201] This, most of you are just kind of realizing this right now as we, as you look at your Bibles.
[time=3206] This is the next passage.
[time=3209] He gives us this example.
[time=3212] He lays out for us, listen, listen.
[time=3215] He lays out for us this model of godly suffering at the end of first Peter two and then right out of the gate in chapter three, verse one, in the same way, you wives.
[time=3227] And then look at verse seven.
[time=3230] You husbands in the same way, lays it out for us.
[time=3235] Not a coincidence, no, not at all,
[time=3241] but instead God's designed.
[time=3243] And here in these first six verses, his design for a godly wife, a god-honoring wife who in honoring God honors her husband, her submission is first pure.
[time=3254] Let's read it first.
[time=3255] In the same way, you wives.
[time=3259] Be submissive to your own husbands so that even if any of them, the husband, so that even if any of them are disobedient to the word, raise your hand this morning.
[time=3269] If you're a husband in this room who has been, who is now and who may in the future at some point in time, be disobedient to the word.
[time=3277] Raise your hand, keep them up.
[time=3279] If you're a husband in this room and you've been disobedient to the word, raise your hand, every husband in this room has his hand raised.
[time=3288] Okay, thanks.
[time=3289] That's all of us.
[time=3292] So that's all of you, wives.
[time=3296] If any of them, wives, are disobedient to the word,
[time=3303] they may be one, W-O-N, they may be one back, they may be one over without a word.
[time=3310] That's right.
[time=3311] Without a word, your thing in my goodness, how in the world am I gonna win 'em back over, without a word, by the behavior of their wives.
[time=3323] As they, the husband, observes your, the wife,
[time=3332] your chaste and respectful, your pure and respectful behavior, your adornment must not merely be external, braiding the hair and wearing gold jewelry or putting on dresses, but let it be, that which is attractive about you, that which is pretty about you, that which is beautiful about you, but let it be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in the sight of God, for in this way in former times the holy women also, who hoped in their husbands, no, who hoped in God, used to adorn themselves, being submissive to their own husbands, just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him Lord.
[time=3376] The translation there would be dear one, ladies,
[time=3382] not I, I, sir, not Lord, what do you want me to do today, sir, not what do you have lined up for me today?
[time=3389] Oh husband, oh mighty, no, she called him Lord, which translated would have meant dear one.
[time=3400] And you have become her children, this is so powerful, and you have become her children, if you do what is right without being frightened by any fear, wives, women, do not think for a moment, that God is somehow oblivious to the unsettled,
[time=3423] fearful sense that might exist in you, and you're following this as you attempt to live out his design, he knows that, and he says, don't be frightened, because I am, remember, I am more than capable of giving you all that you would need, holding you as tightly as I would need to hold you, in order to see you through this and have you honor my design.
[time=3449] The God-honoring wife, her submission is pure, her submission is respectful, it is internally beautiful, this is where we'll go next week, and it is gentle, it should be gentle and quiet, it is pure, respectful, internally beautiful, and it is gentle and quiet, and that is where we'll go next week as we come back together and continue this look at the God-honoring wife.
[time=3475] Would you stand with me and let's pray as we close?
[time=3483] Pray with me, would you Father, we say it every week and we mean it from the bottom of our heart, God, we are so grateful for your word, for these ancient words, for this holy scripture, set apart from all other God, because it is not only true, but God, it pierces, it divides, it sinks deep into our hearts and souls, and it reveals to us things that only you and your spirit and your word could reveal, things that need to change, things that must be adjusted, God's sin that should be confessed and repented of, God, your word to us as husbands, your word to us as kids, your word to us as wives, God speaks deep into our hearts, and as we prayed earlier, God, I would reiterate to you now that there would be in each and every heart in this room an openness, a level of willingness and humility that maybe hasn't been there for years.
[time=3540] (silence)
