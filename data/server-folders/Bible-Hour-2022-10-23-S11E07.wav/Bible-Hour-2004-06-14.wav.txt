[time=60] (upbeat music) - Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here
[time=86] at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=87] And I just wanted to tell you, before we get going today, how thankful I am for this place and for these people, this amazing team that I get to be a part of and this incredible family that I have the privilege of serving, Black Hawk is a very, very special place.
[time=103] And I wanna just remind you who are out there in the viewing audience, whoever you are, wherever your life has taken you, wherever you've been, whatever you find yourself in the midst of, I just wanna remind you today that Black Hawk is a place that is a safe place to hear a life-changing, I'll oftentimes say, dangerous message.
[time=127] It's a safe place to hear a life-changing, eternity-altering message.
[time=132] Black Hawk's a place full of people who haven't forgotten for a moment what it's like to be on the outside looking in, people who haven't forgotten at all, what it's like to struggle and wrestle with the issues of life.
[time=146] And it's because of a fully surrendered relationship with him, it's because of what Jesus Christ has provided us on the cross and in our relationship with him.
[time=157] It's because of him that we have hope, it's because of him that we have meaning.
[time=162] And this place is full of people who are growing and they're understanding of that and so ready and willing to help others who will come understand and see that very same truth.
[time=174] And so again, I just want to extend an invitation to you whoever you are and we mean that, whoever you are.
[time=181] You come and you be a part of what God is doing here.
[time=184] Let us have the privilege of meeting you and getting to know you and allow us the privilege of introducing you to the one person in the world who can really change your life.
[time=197] And that's Jesus Christ.
[time=199] We have for the last 10 weeks almost been engaged in a study from God's word that we've entitled for better for worse, God's design for marriage and family.
[time=209] And what you'll see today is the second part of a message that we started last week on the God honoring wife, the wife that is truly willing in her heart and life to follow God's design in her marriage.
[time=222] We know that there are wives out there and some of you are married to husbands that honor God and obey God and love you well.
[time=230] And there are also wives out there and you find yourself in situations where it's not as nice, where it's not as peaceful, where it's not as calm.
[time=239] And first Peter three says at the beginning, it says wives be submissive to your husbands so that if any of them are disobedient to the word, and we know that there are many of us out there as husbands who aren't always obedient.
[time=255] And so this passage we'll look at today wives.
[time=259] It helps you understand more clearly how you can, even with a disobedient husband, conduct yourself and live your life and carry yourself in that relationship in a God honoring husband honoring fashion.
[time=275] And I hope you're encouraged.
[time=276] And I just wanna let you know next week and for the next two weeks, we're gonna conclude our marriage and family series with a couple of messages on parenting.
[time=286] And I cannot begin to tell you how as I look at my own life and my own family and as I look at the lives and the families that God has placed around me, when I go to the store, when I go to the mall, when I live my life in this very same world that you live your life in, I cannot begin to tell you how my heart breaks for kids.
[time=308] This culture, this society of ours, it needs parents.
[time=313] And it needs God honoring parents who are willing to engage with their kids and parent their children and be moms and dads that are willing to do that in a way that honors God and in a way that shows genuine love for their kids.
[time=329] And there's so much confusion about that today.
[time=331] So let's come together and let's look at God's word as we always do, God's designed for parenting.
[time=338] That's in the next two weeks.
[time=339] I hope today wives and husbands, but especially wives.
[time=342] I hope today you'll listen and see what God's word has for you.
[time=346] Hope you'll be encouraged and challenged to in your life and marriage follow his design.
[time=351] Thanks, we hope to see you soon.
[time=353] God bless.
[time=354] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 187 seconds]
[time=549] - Father, we thank you for the beautiful day outside.
[time=568] We thank you for the hearts and the minds that are open here today, Lord.
[time=573] We ask you to bless this gathering as we receive our lesson today.
[time=577] We ask these things in your son, Jesus' name, amen.
[time=580] (gentle music) - Welcome back to our series that we began weeks ago.
[time=588] It is a series that we entitled For Better, For Worse, God's Design, For Marriage and Family.
[time=596] For Better, For Worse, God's Design, For Marriage and Family.
[time=600] And what we've seen and learned so far, what we've been reminded of is that God designed marriage, that God designed family.
[time=612] We have seen and we have been reminded that Hollywood didn't.
[time=617] Madison Avenue didn't.
[time=621] Reality television didn't.
[time=625] They have all tried in many ways to redefine it, but the fact of the matter is, and what brings great hope and joy to your heart and mind, is that God designed marriage.
[time=637] God designed family.
[time=639] And there is a way that we can give ourselves to it.
[time=642] There is a way that we can come under his design with humility and trust in him and give ourselves to each other.
[time=650] And he'll honor it, he'll bless it, he really does.
[time=653] And there is a way that we can move away from it.
[time=657] There is a way that we can see that design and in our sin and rebellion and pride, we can move away from the design and the marriage breaks down and the family breaks down and the home breaks down and in the end culture begins to break down because as we've seen, God's design is clear.
[time=676] The family, the home is at the center of it all.
[time=680] And so we have done our best.
[time=684] I've tried my best each and every week to bring to you not my opinion and not my take, but what God's word says to husbands, what God's word says to children, what God's word says to wives.
[time=698] And in the next two weeks, we'll come back and continue the series and talk about God's design for parents.
[time=705] God's design for parenting, what should our parenting look like?
[time=709] What kind of investment should we be making into the hearts and lives of these kids that God has given us?
[time=714] But today we'll come back, today we'll come back to what we started last week, God honoring wives.
[time=720] Here's what we've seen so far.
[time=721] In God's design, we'll go back to husbands.
[time=724] In God's design, we looked at Ephesians five and guys, you should be looking at Ephesians five every day, reading through those few four, five, six verses where it says that husbands love their wives sacrificially.
[time=737] Men, that's a tireless, faithful effort.
[time=740] It is something that we don't, though we would tend to in our humanness, grow weary of it, it's something we continue to give her day after day, week after week, month after month.
[time=752] We love her tirelessly, sacrificially, faithfully, doing everything we can, giving up whatever we may have to give up to come alongside and love, meet her need and care for her.
[time=765] Husbands love their wives sacrificially.
[time=768] In God's design, we've seen that children, young children, teenage children, older children to the degree that we're able to, we obey our parents, God says.
[time=779] And our obedience is to be immediate.
[time=783] Not in a few minutes, not tomorrow and not next week, but no, God's word says that as children, our obedience is to be immediate.
[time=792] It is to be thorough or complete, whatever has been asked of us, we do it completely.
[time=801] And then we see as children in God's design, our obedience is to be joyful.
[time=806] We do it quickly, we do it thoroughly with a smile in our hearts, maybe even a smile on our face, because that's what honors God.
[time=814] Wives, in God's design, we began to see last week, if you weren't with us last week, I would invite you to pick up a CD, a tape or maybe a DVD and kind of catch up.
[time=824] We laid last week, kind of a biblical backdrop, a foundation to this notion that in God's design, He has called you as wives, to live in relationship with your husbands with a submissive spirit.
[time=836] God's word says wives submit to your husbands.
[time=840] Now husbands, real quick, before we move on husbands, let me remind you of something absolutely crucial to any study of submission.
[time=850] And what I'd wanna remind you of is that it would, it would be so very important, as we study, and as we talk about it, as we dialogue with wives about submission husbands, it would be so important for you to understand the role you play and the opportunity you have to model submission because of your personal submission to Christ.
[time=877] Look at Ephesians, if you will, I don't know that this will be on the screen, if you just look real quick, look at Ephesians, Galatians, Ephesians 5, Ephesians 5, 22 says wives be subject to your own husbands
[time=897] as to the Lord, for the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, He Himself being the savior of the body.
[time=905] But as the church, husbands included, but as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives ought to be to their husbands in everything.
[time=916] Gentlemen, husbands, you're growing faithful submission to Him, you're humble following of Him, coupled with your tireless sacrifice and love for her, paves the way for her submission.
[time=932] Your submission, you're following, you're trusting Him, helps her to submit to follow and trust you.
[time=941] So, that being said, what does the submission
[time=949] of a God-honoring wife look like?
[time=952] I want you to turn with me, if you would, to 1 Peter chapter three, we got there at the end of our time last week, we'll pick it up this morning and work our way through this passage, 1 Peter chapter three, verses one to six, to God-honoring, a husband-honoring wife, would you stand with me, please, in honor of God's word, and let me read this for you, it says in the same way, you wives, be submissive to your own husbands, so that even if any of them are disobedient to the word, and every guy in the room last week raised his hand, saying, I have a tendency to be disobedient to the word, so that if any of them are disobedient to the word, they may be one, W-O-N, one back without a word by the behavior of their wives, as they, the husband, observes your, the wife, your chaste and respectful behavior, your adornment, that which is beautiful about you, that which is attractive about you, must not be merely external, braiding the hair and wearing gold jewelry or putting on dresses, but let it be that which is beautiful about you, but let it be the hidden person of the heart, with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious, he says.
[time=1036] Precious in the sight of God, for in this way in former times the holy women, also who hoped in who, who hoped in God, used to adorn themselves being submissive to their own husbands, just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him Lord, translated, dear one.
[time=1055] You have become her children if you do what is right without being frightened by any fear.
[time=1062] Would you pray with me?
[time=1064] Oh, Father God, we come before you this morning, so many in this room and so many wives, women who desire, I believe, deep in their hearts, to bottom line be the women God, the wives that you've called them to be, and yet we know on this side of heaven, God we know in the midst of this twisted, perverse, crooked world that we live in, God in the midst of our own sinfulness.
[time=1090] Your design at times, that which you've called us to God,
[time=1096] we at times tend to move in opposite directions.
[time=1100] And as the passage says there at the end, God as it relates to wives so many times, that movement away from what you've designed for them, God is born out of fear and uncertainty.
[time=1112] God an unsettled heart that just can't figure out how in the world this design of yours is gonna work.
[time=1119] And so God today I pray that beyond anything I might say
[time=1125] that your word would do, what only your word can do, God and that it would not only penetrate and convict our hearts, but God that it would bring great strength and courage and hope.
[time=1137] 'Cause your design is true, your design is right.
[time=1140] God your plan for us as husbands and for those in the room who are wives, for us as children, God when we give ourselves to what you designed, we know you're ready to bless and honor that effort.
[time=1154] And so God I pray that you and your spirit and your word would do a work in us today in your son's name.
[time=1160] We pray, amen.
[time=1163] You can be seated.
[time=1164] Let's come back to first Peter three.
[time=1166] We learned something here ladies here in the text about the submissive spirit of a God honoring wife.
[time=1173] Number one, write this down.
[time=1174] Her submission it says is pure.
[time=1177] Number one, her submission is characterized as pure.
[time=1182] Look at the first two verses there.
[time=1183] In the same way you wives, be submissive to your own husband so that even if any of them are disobedient to the word, they may be one without a word by the behavior keyword, by the behavior of their wives, by your behavior, as they the husband observes your chaste is what it says in the NASB or your pure and respectful behavior.
[time=1210] You see in our text this morning, her submission is seen in what the passage calls her pure behavior.
[time=1218] Behavior that is clean.
[time=1220] Behavior that is set apart.
[time=1224] Behavior that is washed.
[time=1227] Does that sound like a word to you?
[time=1231] Set apart, washed, clean.
[time=1235] Is there a word coming to mind?
[time=1238] That my friends is a biblical definition of the word what?
[time=1242] Holy.
[time=1244] For in this way verse five in the former times the holy women.
[time=1253] Behavior is a huge component here of these first couple of verses.
[time=1259] And we see that her, the God honoring wife, her behavior is clean.
[time=1264] What is behavior?
[time=1265] I just wrote a few things down for you there.
[time=1267] The word in the Greek refers to her conduct, her actions, her words, her thoughts and her attitudes,
[time=1275] her conduct actions, words, thoughts and attitudes are clean.
[time=1282] They're set apart, they're washed.
[time=1284] Toward God, yes, her actions, her behavior is pure.
[time=1289] Toward God, yes.
[time=1290] And others, yes, but most importantly, in the context here of 1 Peter 3, toward him.
[time=1296] There is a purity in the way she conducts herself with him, little H, her husband.
[time=1301] In the places that she goes and the things that she does and the stuff that she says and the things that she harbors and there is a commitment to purity.
[time=1311] And that comes out in her behavior and he observes that pure behavior.
[time=1318] God doesn't win him back, ladies, through your immoral actions.
[time=1324] God doesn't win him back through your promiscuous behavior or your sinful, prideful attitude or your compromising conduct.
[time=1338] Now the word of God in this passage begs the question, how far will you go?
[time=1342] And I'll ask you this morning, wives here in the room, how far will you go?
[time=1347] How much help will you ask for?
[time=1349] In order to prioritize and pursue personal holiness.
[time=1356] I mean, really, how willing would you be this morning?
[time=1365] Wives in the room to recognize and identify how helpful it will be, how used of God it can be in your life and in the life of that relationship for you to go to whatever lengths you've got to go to, for you to ask for whatever help you may need to ask for.
[time=1383] In order to pursue and build into your life with God's help and the encouragement of others, an uncompromising life.
[time=1393] An uncompromising heart.
[time=1395] Pure behavior.
[time=1399] The God-honoring husband, honoring wife.
[time=1405] Her submission is pure.
[time=1406] Number two, her submission is respectful.
[time=1409] As he observes back to the text, you see it there again, as he is won over without a word by the behavior of his wife, as he observes your chaste, pure and respectful behavior.
[time=1424] You see, godly submission, okay, and we can stay in the arena of the wife, all right, but we can also come right back over here to the arena of the husband.
[time=1433] We can come over here to the arena of the kid for all of us, godly submission.
[time=1438] Whether we're talking about a husband, wife, deal, whether we're talking about a police officer, whether we're talking about a coach, whether we're talking about a teacher, whether we're talking about an older person.
[time=1449] See, at the very basis, at the very crux, of real God-honoring submission is this thing called respect.
[time=1458] I treat you respectfully because of who you are,
[time=1464] because of the position, okay, because of the position that you hold.
[time=1469] I'm not in this discussion necessarily talking about the person that you are, the decisions that you make, the way that you handle yourself, 'cause I might have some issues there.
[time=1484] But nonetheless, because of the position that you hold, godly submission extends itself in a respectful, kind behavior.
[time=1493] My kids, I mean, that's just the first thing that comes to my mind.
[time=1496] My own kids, a couple of the older ones now.
[time=1499] Many of you have seen this for years.
[time=1501] Others of you like me are beginning to encounter it.
[time=1504] One of them can come home, and I can hear them talking about their teacher, or I can hear them talking about their coach.
[time=1512] And I know, 'cause I've been a coach, and I've been a teacher, and I know because coaches and teachers are human.
[time=1519] And I know, as I hear them kind of relay what happened, there's times where I can kind of see the scenario in my mind and go, "No, that coach, that teacher, they did the right thing, that was good." There's times when I can just kind of pick up on based upon things that are said, I can kind of sense in me.
[time=1536] I wonder if she maybe had a bad day, or I wonder if he was a little frustrated.
[time=1542] And I can in my mind, because I'm human, sometimes spot other humans, humanness.
[time=1551] And I can see how it affects one of my kids.
[time=1554] And so that next day when he or she is heading back into that classroom, that next day when he or she is heading back into practice, what do I say?
[time=1563] What do you say?
[time=1564] I would hope all of us are saying the same thing here.
[time=1567] We'll talk about this next week in parenting, but what are we saying to our kids who have had that kind of encounter with a flawed human coach or teacher?
[time=1575] Show them what?
[time=1577] Respect.
[time=1578] I don't care if he missed it.
[time=1582] I understand it, it has caused you some trouble, but you know what fundamentally, pot 'em line, she's your teacher.
[time=1590] You are to extend to her, you are to show to him kindness, and graciousness, and respect, and he or she might say back to me, but dad, why?
[time=1601] And I say, because you're supposed to, because that's God's design, because that's what God has commanded.
[time=1612] Now extending to him, your husband,
[time=1618] your respectful, kind, and gracious behavior,
[time=1624] and hang on here, wives, don't do a disconnect right there.
[time=1628] Some of you might be tempted to say on the one hand, okay, you're talking about coaches and teachers, fine-kelling with you.
[time=1634] Okay, now you're talking about my husband.
[time=1636] You know, it's the same thing.
[time=1639] Positions, not necessarily people, positions, God ordained, a good God who loves you and me, and has put this, God says to extend kindness, and graciousness, and respect, and extending that to your husband isn't based, ladies.
[time=1658] It isn't based on his performance, or if he's currently making you happy.
[time=1665] You do it because you do it for the same reason you tell your 12-year-old to go back into that classroom and participate and cooperate, because that's the right thing to do.
[time=1682] No, I've had many a wife look right back at me and say, "Well, you know what? I don't respect him." See, they go back to the person, they look at me and they say, "I don't respect him.
[time=1693] "How in the world can you ask me to extend him respect "when I don't respect him as a person?" They say to me, "That would be insincere." They say to me, "That would be phony." And the best I can say to them is, "You know what? I believe it would be obedient of you." Easy, not necessarily.
[time=1717] Challenging, most often.
[time=1720] But none the less, and you know what?
[time=1722] There are things we can do to address the person.
[time=1724] There are times when truth needs to be spoken in love, and you can do that respectfully as well.
[time=1730] But in the day-to-day of life, no, God says we are to extend.
[time=1734] You as a wife to extend the graciousness, and kindness, and respect, do the position.
[time=1741] God-honoring, husband-honoring wives.
[time=1749] Their submission is pure, and their submission is respectful.
[time=1754] And thirdly, write this down.
[time=1756] Godly submission on the part of a wife is internally beautiful.
[time=1761] It is internally beautiful.
[time=1764] Let's go back to our text.
[time=1766] First Peter 3, we'll pick it up in verse 3, it says there, "Your adornment, ladies, that which is beautiful about you, that which is pretty, that which is inviting." He says, "Your adornment must not be merely external, braiding the hair and wearing gold jewelry or putting on dresses, but let it be the hidden person of the heart, a hidden woman of the heart with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit." Doesn't say gentle and quiet personality, does it?
[time=1803] It says gentle and quiet spirit.
[time=1807] Many of you don't have gentle and quiet personalities.
[time=1810] It's all right.
[time=1811] It's what God made you.
[time=1813] Some do, it's not the point.
[time=1815] This isn't a personality issue.
[time=1817] This is a spirit, hard issue.
[time=1824] The imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, this is great, which is precious, which is precious in the sight of God.
[time=1832] Let me try and say it to you this way.
[time=1836] The Scriptures teach that the God-honoring, husband-honoring wife really, really wants to be beautiful for her husband.
[time=1845] That's really clear.
[time=1848] She desires to be attractive to him.
[time=1851] She desires to be inviting, even exciting, to him and only him.
[time=1857] Now, see, here's the deal.
[time=1860] And we've got to talk about this.
[time=1861] We've got to periodically just lay our cards on the table and make sure that biblically and honestly and personally, we're doing our best as a family to think and talk these things through.
[time=1871] See, I don't need, and other men don't need you to be attractive or inviting to us.
[time=1882] We don't need that.
[time=1886] We need you to be beautiful and attractive and inviting to your husband and only your husband.
[time=1896] See how that works?
[time=1900] With me or with other men, be really, really plain.
[time=1908] Be really, really neutral.
[time=1911] With other men, God's Word would say to you
[time=1917] as a woman, leave a lot for the imagination and allow us to be accountable for our imaginations.
[time=1926] Somebody said it like this once.
[time=1930] They said the women should be sneaky.
[time=1933] And I liked how I described it.
[time=1935] They should hide their beauty.
[time=1938] Hide your beauty from us.
[time=1944] Save it for him alone.
[time=1945] Leave us in the dark.
[time=1947] We don't need to see your beauty.
[time=1949] Your bodies are for him to see, not us.
[time=1953] And you might be sitting out there going, well, you know, hey, gee whiz, I'm 16.
[time=1959] I don't have him yet.
[time=1961] I'm 18, I'm 22, I'm 30.
[time=1965] I don't have him yet.
[time=1966] And to that, I would say, you know, I'm not quite sure how that's going to go, but until then, if in fact then come, save it.
[time=1975] Save it all.
[time=1978] I mean, literally, save yourself for him and externally, save the modeling of it, save the showing of it, save it all for him.
[time=1993] Because that's the way God designed it.
[time=1997] I know it's not the way culture says it.
[time=2002] And I know young ladies and even moms, everywhere you go, culture says show it.
[time=2008] Show as much of it as you can.
[time=2011] And we're here today just to be reminded of the powerful truth of God's word that says, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't, don't show it.
[time=2022] "Don't, save it, it's for him and him alone." Guys, is there a part that we play in this?
[time=2031] Sure there is.
[time=2032] Guys, don't be on the lookout for additional beauty.
[time=2035] Don't put yourself in situations.
[time=2039] Do your very best to visually and mentally and emotionally and literally stay away from the opportunities to view somebody else's beauty.
[time=2051] And adhere to the words of Solomon who said Ecclesiastes, take great joy.
[time=2056] Be absorbed in, be overwhelmed by the life of your youth.
[time=2060] Period.
[time=2063] She's the only one you're to enjoy.
[time=2066] She's the only one whose beauty you're to see.
[time=2069] And these are things we need to think about.
[time=2074] These are things we need to consider.
[time=2076] Hey wives, you know what he did here.
[time=2080] It's a pretty amazing thing.
[time=2081] What God has done for you ladies in this passage is redefine beauty.
[time=2086] He has redefined beauty.
[time=2089] Because what is beauty?
[time=2090] Anyway, ladies, is Brittany?
[time=2093] Beauty?
[time=2094] Is Pamela?
[time=2096] Is that, what's beauty?
[time=2097] Is it Gwyneth?
[time=2099] Is it Nicole?
[time=2101] Is it whoever's on the cover?
[time=2102] I mean, what is beautiful?
[time=2105] What is attractive?
[time=2107] What is inviting?
[time=2109] And God does us a great favor here.
[time=2111] He reminds us of his definition of what that's really about.
[time=2117] And it's so much more.
[time=2120] So much more than a magazine cover.
[time=2123] Look at what it says there.
[time=2124] Your adornment must not be verse three merely external, braiding the hair and wearing gold jewelry or putting on dresses, but let it be the hidden person of the heart.
[time=2136] With the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit.
[time=2140] Ladies, your submission, please don't miss this.
[time=2143] Your submission to your husband is strengthened and your relationship with him is deepened when you dress up your heart.
[time=2153] When you dress up your heart, you get really attractive, believe me, and you get really inviting to him when you do an extreme makeover on your soul.
[time=2167] Not adding inches or removing inches or lifting skin,
[time=2176] but giving time and heart and devotion to the growing of your spirit, your relationship with him, capital H, I am.
[time=2187] And maybe this just brings it to the, maybe we can just ask your question.
[time=2194] That kind of brings it into the realm of real practical everyday living, okay?
[time=2197] Ladies, I think I wrote it down like this.
[time=2200] How much time do you spend?
[time=2203] I'm really asking too, so think about this.
[time=2205] How much time do you spend?
[time=2208] How much energy do you extend?
[time=2210] How much planning do you do?
[time=2213] How much thought do you give to how you look externally?
[time=2220] And are you giving equal or more amounts of time, money, energy, planning, thought to what your heart looks like?
[time=2231] To what's going on in your spirit?
[time=2235] I mean, if you just listed those out, if we just got out of pen and paper and said, okay, hours spent, time spent, money spent, thought given to my spiritual heart development with my God versus the conditioning and physique of my body, my hair, my skin, whatever.
[time=2254] Now, gotta be real careful here.
[time=2258] Wouldn't want anybody in the room saying, okay, so what you're saying, Kelly is, I'm supposed to let it all go physically.
[time=2264] And just, no, no, the text even, even says your adornment, verse three, your adornment must not be merely external.
[time=2274] Do you see that?
[time=2276] It can be external.
[time=2278] I mean, God's word says in 1 Corinthians that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2284] And God would want you as a woman to take very good care of your body.
[time=2288] You should be healthy.
[time=2290] You should be nutritious.
[time=2291] You should be exercising.
[time=2293] You should be doing everything you can to take care of this body God has given you.
[time=2298] It's not a husband speaking.
[time=2300] That's not some male talking.
[time=2301] I mean, that's just basic biblical truth.
[time=2304] We all are to do that.
[time=2307] The problem comes when you become obsessed with what your hair looks like.
[time=2311] You become obsessed with what your body looks like.
[time=2314] You become obsessed with presenting your hair and body in a way that is inappropriate.
[time=2320] Come over here to the heart.
[time=2326] Come over here to your walk with him and invest some time and invest some energy and invest some money and invest some devotion to that.
[time=2337] The God-honoring whiffs, wife spends that much effort and more spiritually growing and developing her heart because a beautiful growing heart is precious.
[time=2350] See what it says there?
[time=2351] It's precious in the sight of God.
[time=2353] What else would you want to be?
[time=2361] Would you want to be anything else other than precious in the sight of God?
[time=2366] And if you're about to answer that another way, we'll stop, you're in trouble.
[time=2373] What else would you want to be?
[time=2375] Other than precious in the sight of God.
[time=2379] Proverbs 31 speaks to this, Proverbs 31, 25.
[time=2387] You can see it right there.
[time=2388] You want to talk about clothing?
[time=2390] You want to talk about what you put on?
[time=2391] Proverbs 31, 25 says strength and dignity are her clothing.
[time=2396] And she smiles, I love this.
[time=2399] She, back to 1 Peter 3 at the end there, she's not afraid of the future.
[time=2404] She smiles at the future.
[time=2405] Strength and dignity are her clothing.
[time=2408] And then look what it says in verse 30.
[time=2410] It says in Proverbs 31, 30, charm is deceitful and beauty is vain, beauty is fleeting, beauty, external beauty, it's here and it's gone, but a woman who fears the Lord, internal beauty, developing the gentle and quiet spirit, the pure submission, the respectful behavior, a woman who fears the Lord, she shall be praised.
[time=2437] Her submission is pure, her submission is respectful,
[time=2444] her submission is internally beautiful.
[time=2447] And fourthly, her submission is gentle and quiet.
[time=2451] It's a gentle and quiet spirit.
[time=2454] Ladies, I'll just say this, a pure life, here you go, a pure life that graciously with kindness extends respect while giving time and effort to a growing heart becomes gentler, becomes quieter as the days and weeks and the months go by.
[time=2478] Titus chapter two, Titus chapter two,
[time=2485] verses three, four and five, I'm gonna have 'em pull that up and I'm gonna just leave it on the screen and I'm gonna invite a friend of mine to come up, I've invited Karen Beck.
[time=2499] Karen, would you come up?
[time=2499] Karen Beck is a, Karen and Tim are a part of our family here at Blackhawk, have been for going on about 15 years and they both have been involved in various arenas of ministry, there you go, my friend.
[time=2514] They both have been involved in a number of different arenas of ministry, Tim and Karen together, hosting and leading crown financial groups and Karen has been for, oh I guess maybe 20 years or so in a very, very pivotal way, in a very significant way, she has been used of God to help disciple, come alongside counsel, spend time with and invest in women.
[time=2538] She has led and taught Bible studies, she's been a part of small groups and she has one on one with many a wife in this church, in the city God has really given her a heart for that and I just wanted to, as we kind of wind up here, I wanted, had asked her to just come and share a few thoughts on submission.
[time=2558] We've spent two weeks on it but you've just kind of heard from me and I've done my best and I've tried to be accurate with what God's word has said but thought maybe it would be helpful as well to hear from one who not only has taught it but one of the things I appreciate about Karen is that she does her best to live it, she's not perfect, she hasn't arrived, she and Tim would both tell you, their marriage is very much still in process but I'm grateful when I see people staying at it and so it was originally just gonna be concluding remarks last night, I thought you know what, why don't you just throw in a few words too on this gentle and quiet spirit principle.
[time=2594] I think there's some things there she can share with you that would I think be, I believe would be encouraging and so Karen share with them a little bit about that and then just share some concluding remarks before we pray for our wives today on this issue.
[time=2609] - Well first of all, I think seeing that up on the screen it's a little humbling and it's a little freeing to say, yes I am the older woman.
[time=2619] - I am the older one.
[time=2621] And you know when Tim said, I do to me at the age of 18, he sure didn't know what he was saying, I do too.
[time=2630] And I think of that gentle and quiet spirit and so often as women we just say, you know, that's just not my personality, I mean that's not me, I wasn't born that way, I don't wanna be that way but that is, it's a Christ quality, it's a fruit of the spirit.
[time=2648] It's, Jesus was described as he came into Jerusalem and that triumphal entry on Palm Sunday as a gentle and humble writing on a donkey.
[time=2659] He asked us to be yoked with him and learn from him because he was gentle and humble and we would find rest for our souls.
[time=2669] And so it's encouraging to me because as I think of pure and I think of respectful and I think of internally beautiful and gentle and quiet, I know that in my flesh, none of that is me.
[time=2682] But the way that gentle is described in the Greek, it's power under control.
[time=2689] The picture that is often used to describe that term is, is it's a wild stallion that has been broken and trained and able to move and work at the command of his master.
[time=2704] No less powerful, no less able to do what he was born to do but trained and gentle power under control.
[time=2715] So when I think of that, it's encouraging to me
[time=2722] to think that God's the one that does that work in me.
[time=2725] When I submit my heart and my life to the Lord, the Holy Spirit comes to live in me, he begins to make me more like himself.
[time=2734] And I need his help.
[time=2736] I need his help every day to be that kind of person.
[time=2739] Is it because I live with a difficult man?
[time=2742] No, I have a wonderful husband but I've got a sin nature and I've got a rebel heart and sometimes I just strain under that place of being submissive and being the woman that God has asked me to be.
[time=2754] And so it's a joy to work with women and we do a little bit of crying together and we do a lot of praying together because we want to be the woman that God intended us to be.
[time=2765] So what does gentle look like?
[time=2767] When your husband walks in at night and he's weary and he's frustrated and he walks maybe right by you and he goes and he sits down in that chair, you don't say, well, yeah, I'd like to sit down on that chair too, I've been with four kids all day.
[time=2781] I mean, you think you're tired, let me tell you about tired.
[time=2785] - You're not supposed to say that?
[time=2787] - No.
[time=2788] (audience laughs) - When he wants to take you to dinner and he's going to take you to pizza and you wanted to go to Asafusa.
[time=2797] - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[time=2799] - Yeah, you're grateful, you're grateful that he would think of you, that he would think to take you to dinner, that he would think to relieve you from cooking.
[time=2809] When he has tickets to the game and you'd rather go to the movie, you're grateful.
[time=2816] When he's thinking about how he'd like to spend Saturday and you had another idea, you gently respond.
[time=2826] You consider him over yourself.
[time=2830] Gentleness gets acted out in all sorts of ways.
[time=2833] It doesn't mean you don't speak.
[time=2835] A woman that has a heart for God gets to speak the truth in love.
[time=2841] She gets to respond in ways to her husband and share her heart.
[time=2846] But she's thinking of him and she's preferring him.
[time=2850] And as you think of submissive, you know, God ordained structures of order for all of us.
[time=2858] The son was submissive to the father.
[time=2862] We're to be submissive to governing authorities, to our pastors, to our leaders, to our employers.
[time=2871] And as wives, God's called us to be submissive to our husbands, to come underneath their leadership.
[time=2878] Some of us can say, you know, well, my husband doesn't lead.
[time=2884] There's nothing to submit to.
[time=2886] But he's in a role, like Kelly said, and God's called us to come underneath that.
[time=2892] Two people can't be the boss.
[time=2895] Two people can't have the last word.
[time=2897] Two people can't make all the decisions.
[time=2901] Ultimately, as you dialogue over things, you have to come under the leadership of your husband.
[time=2908] And it's a good thing.
[time=2910] It's a good thing because God says so.
[time=2911] When I was thinking about, what does this picture look like?
[time=2917] Well, first of all, gentleness is something that's born in a place of adversity.
[time=2922] It's not something that just we just naturally do.
[time=2925] Because it's a fruit of the spirit, God grows it in some difficult places.
[time=2930] And I was thinking about this movie that was made a couple years ago, as good as it gets with Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt.
[time=2936] And here's Jack Nicholson, a quirky, eccentric, old, single guy.
[time=2943] He's a writer, and he walks down to this restaurant in Manhattan every morning to have his breakfast.
[time=2949] And nobody wants to wait on him because he's nasty, and he's rude, and he's just weird and picky, and he brings his own silverware wrapped up in plastic, and he puts it on the table and he orders the same thing, and all the waitresses are standing back in their station, and nobody wants to wait on him.
[time=2972] But Helen Hunt, single mom of a little boy, she goes over there, and she waits on him day after day, after day, and she's kind, and she's cheerful, and she humors him, and she helps him.
[time=2988] And ultimately, a relationship, a funny kind of relationship happens between the two of them, and he asks her to take this little trip with him, and she's excited because she has not been out for five years, and she buys a dress and she packs her bag, and she meets him at dinner that night with her new dress on, and he says, "What kind of dress is that?
[time=3015] "Is that a house dress?" He says, "What is that house dress?" "What is that house dress?" "What is that house dress?" And she looks at him, and she's just finally, she just is beside her, okay.
[time=3026] "I'll be Jack, you'll be Helen.
[time=3028] "What is that, a house dress?" "Say something nice." "Come on, come on, say something nice." And he kind of doesn't know what to say, and he kind of looks around, and he fumbles over his words, but he doesn't say anything, and then she says it again to him.
[time=3043] "Say something nice." "You don't say something nice, I'm leaving, I'm out of here." So he looks at her and he says, "You make me want to be a better man." And she stands there and she's speechless, and she said, "That's the nicest thing "anyone has ever said.
[time=3062] "You make me want to be a better man." And that's what I love about this prescription that God has given us as wives.
[time=3070] You know, he gives us the potential of changing the dynamic of a marriage through our behavior, through our attitude, through our conduct, through the condition of our heart and how we respond.
[time=3084] He doesn't say to a husband, "Husbands, if you love your wives, "you have the potential of winning a disobedient wife." But he says to women, "If you submit, "and you respond with respect and purity and gentleness "and a quiet demeanor, "you have the potential of winning your husband." - Wow, that's powerful.
[time=3114] The rest of that verse says, "Older women likewise "are to be reverent in their behavior, "not malicious gossips nor enslaved to much wine, "teaching what is good, "so that they may encourage the young women "to love their husbands, to love their children, "to be sensible, pure workers at home, "kind, being subject to their own husbands, "so that the word of God will not be dishonored." Well, Corbin, could you come up and could you just play a little of all or none?
[time=3146] And you just hang on here, Karen, I'm gonna ask, as Corbin plays, I'm gonna ask all of you, if you would, to bow your heads and close your eyes.
[time=3156] And I'm gonna ask you wives, if you want to.
[time=3159] You don't have to, but if you're a wife in the room today and you know in your heart that you need some help, you need some encouragement, I'm gonna ask you to stand, right where you're at.
[time=3171] Everybody's heads bowed, everybody's eyes closed.
[time=3174] Just gonna ask you wives in the room to stand, if, in fact, you would desire to be prayed for and to be lifted up, I'm gonna ask Karen to do that in just a minute.
[time=3184] I know, as you stand, that there are many in the room today and you can just stand whenever you're ready.
[time=3192] I know that there are many who stand this morning and you're standing because you would say with one loud voice, "I need God's help.
[time=3200] "I need His strength and courage." Many of you in the room would say, "I believe His design to be true."
[time=3209] Others of you maybe would stand with hearts that are real heavy because you know the way that you have conducted yourself.
[time=3217] It hasn't been pure, it hasn't been respectful.
[time=3219] You have focused on things other than your spirit
[time=3225] and things haven't been too gentle or too quiet.
[time=3231] And so we just wanna give you the opportunity today
[time=3238] to kind of make a fresh start.
[time=3240] And I meant what I said earlier, we're willing to help Karen and others in our women's ministry.
[time=3246] Good, godly women who are in the struggle with you are there to come alongside and encourage, pray with you, move you in a new direction that you know and I know your heart needs to first be humble.
[time=3266] And so if Corbin, if you just sing that first verse for us, could you do that?
[time=3272] The song talks about bringing everything to him and making a sacrifice of a whole heart.
[time=3279] Just listen as he sings it and then I'm gonna ask Karen to pray here in just a minute.
[time=3283] [MUSIC - 54 seconds]
[time=3352] (gentle piano music) God we confess to you that what we bring is, is just our sinful, weary, struggling self.
[time=3370] Lord we don't have all the answers and we know
[time=3378] and we confess to you God that we have missed the mark.
[time=3381] So many times as wives.
[time=3383] And so we come now and we ask you again, God, for your help, your help to be the kind of woman
[time=3394] that you've called us to be.
[time=3397] You tell us an excellent wife who can find.
[time=3400] The heart of her husband trusts in her, she doesn't good not evil all the days of his life.
[time=3407] And Lord we wanna be that kind of woman, a woman that would be trustworthy, a woman that would steward well the resources that you've given us, a woman that would submit, first of all to you and then to what you teach us to do.
[time=3423] God would you mold us and make us after your will and would you, would you grow in us a submissive heart and teach us to be gentle and kind and pure
[time=3440] and reverent.
[time=3442] And in that just grow a beautiful spirit in each of us.
[time=3449] And I pray Father for those women that are living in difficult marriages, pray you would encourage their hearts Lord, help them to capture a picture again of what you've ordained for them and who you are as their helper.
[time=3462] I pray for those of us Lord that get selfish, that we would just renew again our hearts desire before you to live, to prefer our husbands,
[time=3479] to adapt to him, to follow him well.
[time=3484] I pray for the young women here Lord that don't have a husband.
[time=3489] I pray Father that you would grow in them these heart attitudes that would ready them in the places that you take them, whether it's going to be marriage or just life in the community, that it would be such a beacon of hope and light to others as they see the hidden person of their heart.
[time=3507] Oh God, grow us as your women.
[time=3510] Would you be honored?
[time=3512] Would you be glorified?
[time=3514] Would your word be held up in such a way and be so attractive because of how we give ourselves to marriage that others would come to know you because of that.
[time=3527] We love you Lord Jesus and we just thank you for the privilege of getting to be your daughters.
[time=3532] In your name I pray, amen.
