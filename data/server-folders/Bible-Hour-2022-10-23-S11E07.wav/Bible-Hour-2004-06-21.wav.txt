[time=90] - Lifting people's eyes from the Earthbound vision to the grander vision, is the very stuff of leadership.
[time=98] - 4,700 BCL, cross-section.
[time=101] - You better lay awake nights figuring out how you can go up another level in your leadership.
[time=106] Romans 12, 8 leaders, step up when times are hard.
[time=110] - A center's locked.
[time=113] - Run hard, run fast.
[time=115] Don't ever lower your bias for action.
[time=118] - Run. (upbeat music) - You be the immovable one.
[time=125] No matter how high the pain level gets, you be the steadfast one.
[time=131] You remind yourself that what you're doing is not in vain.
[time=136] (upbeat music)
[time=148] (upbeat music) - I came to this conference with questions
[time=160] and I'm walking away with answers to even questions I didn't even know I had.
[time=165] (upbeat music) - I'm able to bring a lot of my people
[time=178] to the satellite location.
[time=180] And then we have an opportunity to develop a lot of good relationships with the local pastors.
[time=185] - So many of our staff and so many of our leaders, our volunteer leaders can be a part of it.
[time=191] - You feel like you're very much a part of it, that you're present there.
[time=195] - The saturation of teaching during that time just kind of gives you a blast off into the next year.
[time=200] - If you want to know how to select people, you need to be able to answer this question.
[time=208] How much of someone can you change?
[time=210] - If you've got a burning passion for other people, it shows.
[time=215] - The key is to break free from the bonds of conventional thinking.
[time=219] - God could be working on some laymen sitting right there that nobody ever heard of, but who has the character and call of God upon their life.
[time=228] - Pour it on, share the knowledge with them, share your network with them, share your compassion with them, and then take note of what you're doing right.
[time=237] - Jesus did not feed 5,000 men.
[time=240] He took the food and handed it to the 12, and the 12 fed 5,000.
[time=246] - Think of teaming up with other bright, high capacity, energetic bias for acts and kinds of people.
[time=253] Think of sitting around tables with them, a drawing of power and creativity from the spirit of God.
[time=259] Think of putting your best thoughts and ideas toward the objective of changing people's lives in eternity.
[time=267] [MUSIC - 9 seconds]
[time=279] - Think of the stakes and the risks and the thrill of getting that right.

[time=293] (audience applauds) - Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, Senior Pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries,
[time=303] and I can't begin to tell you how excited we are for the 2004 Leadership Summit.
[time=309] What you just saw, that piece right there, begins to paint a picture for you of what you will encounter as you come and give yourself to a two and a half day experience where your leadership skills can be sharpened, where your understanding of leadership and how it works can be grown.
[time=327] And I would just encourage you to do whatever you can to come and be with us.
[time=331] We're so privileged to be able to host a regional site here on our campus.
[time=337] And whether you're trying to do a better job of leading at home, whether you're trying to do a better job of leading in the marketplace, at your business, you may be leading a church or a specific ministry, either way, the conference promises to be for you and for me a growing, stretching opportunity.
[time=356] And so I would invite you to come and be a part of it.
[time=359] We're gonna have live worship with Corbin and our team here, live via satellite coverage from the main conference hub over in Chicago at Willow Creek.
[time=369] And I would love to have you join us and the hundreds of folks who will come here those two and a half days to be reminded and encouraged about leading in the way that God has called us to lead.
[time=380] Visit our website at blackhawkministries.org.
[time=384] And when you go to our website, you'll find a link to the Willow Creek Leadership Summit registration and all your questions can get answered there.
[time=393] I hope you'll come.
[time=394] It would be great to spend those two and a half days in August together.
[time=399] Hey, what you're gonna see today is part one of what will be a two part series on God's design for parenting.
[time=407] And I don't normally say this.
[time=411] I don't normally talk about my messages very much at all.
[time=415] If you know me, you know that to be true.
[time=418] But what took place last Sunday as we began to discuss this issue of honoring God and honoring our kids with our parenting was I think just really, really special.
[time=430] And it wasn't that I was special and it certainly wasn't my words.
[time=435] It was the Spirit of God.
[time=436] And I think a subject matter that is so very near and dear to his heart, all of that coupled with the fact that people today, we really, really need good parents.
[time=448] I know the kids need some work.
[time=450] I know decisions and choices get made on their part, but you know what?
[time=453] You and I in the midst of this culture today and all that we face have got to make some decisions on the kind of parents we're going to be.
[time=463] And so I would encourage you today, if ever you've watched the broadcast with an open heart and an open mind to what God and his spirit and his word might have to say to you, I hope it's today.
[time=477] And I hope you'll allow the Spirit of God to speak to you.
[time=480] And if there's anything we can do to help, having watched this, having thought these things through, if there's anything we can do to encourage you on your parenting journey, please contact us.
[time=494] You know you can always contact me.
[time=496] You can get my name and email address at our website.
[time=500] If you've got questions, ask them.
[time=502] If you've got comments, share them.
[time=504] If you just want to encourage us, please do so.
[time=508] But know how thankful we are for the opportunity to bring this message today to you.
[time=514] And God bless you as you continue to follow him.
[time=517] God bless you if you're on a journey to get to know him.
[time=521] And God bless you as you continue on your parenting journey.
[time=526] My prayer in our hope is that not only you'll be blessed but that your kids would be blessed in the days to come.
[time=535] Hope to see you soon.
[time=536] - You know, I think it was last summer that I was at a golf course with my son who was involved in a tournament.
[time=546] I'm pretty sure it was last summer.
[time=548] And I saw something there at the golf course that sad to say is much, much too common in this world of ours.
[time=556] I think it was at the turn.
[time=558] The ninth hole had been completed and this group of boys were making their way to the 10th tee and several of us parents had gone into the pro shop to buy some snacks, some nutrition, sorry, some nutrition for the kids while they began to take off on the back nine.
[time=573] And at the tee box there on number 10 with the parents coming with the snacks, this dad approaches his son on the 10th tee with people standing around with the snack he had purchased.
[time=587] I don't think the kid had had a good ninth and eighth and seventh hole.
[time=591] It wasn't in a good mood and the dad brings the hot dog to the kid and the kid stands there in front of 20, 30 people and says to the dad, that's not what I wanted.
[time=604] Well, now he's got our attention and he stands there and he chews his dad up one side and down the other, culminating his verbal tirade with, "I want it skittles." He turns around and slams his club on the ground,
[time=622] takes the hot dog and throws it in the garbage can and the dad turns tail and walks back and takes his place behind the ropes.
[time=635] It was in the grocery store a year or so ago.
[time=639] Late one night turned the corner, rushing down to find a few things to get to take home and there I encounter a gal with her three kids, two in the cart, one outside the cart.
[time=650] Now listen, I have no idea the day that this girl had had.
[time=654] I have no idea what her situation in life was.
[time=659] And so I don't in any way bring judgment with these words.
[time=663] I just as I observe and reminded of what so many times can happen.
[time=669] You see the one on the ground had reached up for a peanut butter and had brought down about 12 with them.
[time=675] And as soon as those things hit the ground she immediately wax them right across the back of the head and it wasn't a tap.
[time=684] But here was the amazing thing.
[time=687] Here was the part that just breaks your heart because see as soon as she whacked them on the back of the head, the two in the cart and him all three of them simultaneously took cover.
[time=696] And you got the clear impression that they had been smacked before and probably knew that it wasn't just gonna be one.
[time=709] You know, I don't even have to talk about other people though.
[time=715] See, I can just talk about me.
[time=721] And the list is long, you know, of my own failures.
[time=725] And my ongoing challenges to be the dad, to be the parent that God's called me to be.
[time=729] I remember years ago I think our oldest was about three.
[time=733] And one night I went up to say good night to him late.
[time=737] It had been a busy season, right?
[time=739] You and I know what that's about.
[time=740] Lot of things going on, lot of people to see, lot of places to go, a lot of meetings to be had.
[time=746] And he laid there on his pillow and he looked up at me and went in very serious tone, asked me, he said, "Dad, do you have a bed at your office?" And I didn't laugh.
[time=762] You and I know that whether we're talking about us
[time=768] or whether we're talking about this culture that we live in, we need help parenting.
[time=775] We need a lot of help.
[time=778] We need direction and we need guidance.
[time=780] And so with humility of heart, I hope, and with a great sense of anticipation, we come to these last two weeks of this series and we are, I hope willing, I know I have been this last week to just open my heart and I hope you will today as well, to God's design for parenting.
[time=799] How is it that we can give ourselves to the pursuit of being God honoring parents?
[time=805] We've looked at husbands, we've looked at children, we've looked at wives, and this morning we come to the text in Deuteronomy chapter 6 and we will look at parents.
[time=814] In God's design, here's what we've seen so far.
[time=817] In God's design, husbands love their wives sacrificially.
[time=822] You see, in God's design, children obey their parents immediately, completely and joyfully.
[time=830] In God's design, wives bring themselves to the relationship with their husbands, with a submissive spirit, a willingness to come alongside and offer what only she can offer, and in God's design, people, we see it so very clearly this morning.
[time=847] Parents deposit God's truth, write it down.
[time=851] Parents deposit God's truth into the hearts and lives of their children, and that's where we will begin.
[time=858] Number one, God honoring parents deposit the truth into their children Deuteronomy chapter 6, verses 6 to 9, this is where it begins, let's look at it together.
[time=868] Will you stand in honor of God's word as we read this, Deuteronomy 6, 6 to 9, says these words which I am commanding you today shall be on your heart, and you shall teach them diligently to your sons, and you shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up, and you shall bind them, these words of mine, you shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontals on your forehead, and you shall write them on the door posts of your house and on your gates.
[time=905] Father God, in heaven we come before you this morning, many of us in the room needing a reminder of how it is we as parents need to posture ourselves and present ourselves and give ourselves to our children, and God what it is over and above everything else that we should be giving them, depositing, and investing into their hearts and lives, and God we know that there are conflicting ideas here, society would say that this needs to be invested in them, culture would say give them that.
[time=944] God we see today that your word is so very clear that what they need is the truth in us and from us, and we pray God today that you would open our hearts in new ways, grow us please in that direction we pray.
[time=958] And your son's name, amen.
[time=962] You can be seated.
[time=963] God honoring parents deposit the truth into their children.
[time=970] As you read Deuteronomy six, six to nine, as I read it this week, I couldn't help but kind of say it this way, it almost seems as if God assumes some things about your parenting and mine, it almost would seem as if God assumes that there are some things that are a reality for you.
[time=988] It's as if he's assuming that there are some, not only realities in you but some practices, some habits, some patterns that you and I would be as parents given to.
[time=998] Let's look at what we see there in the text, Deuteronomy six, six to nine.
[time=1002] The first thing we see God assuming is that his word is in you.
[time=1008] And so we ask you this morning, his parents, is it?
[time=1011] Is his word in you?
[time=1013] Look what it says, Deuteronomy six, verse six, it says, these words, the words of God, which I am commanding you today shall be on your heart.
[time=1025] On your heart, there isn't a phrase he could have used
[time=1033] to describe a more deeply invested, deeply planted truth.
[time=1038] We're talking about the truth of God's word being something that you as a parent would interact with so much, that you would read it so much, that you would memorize it so often, that it would be such a part of your daily and nightly life
[time=1058] that the word of God would literally be in you.
[time=1064] Familiar to you, close to you.
[time=1067] All of that coming with this phrase in your, on your heart.
[time=1072] God assumes that his word is in you.
[time=1075] Is it?
[time=1078] And are you taking every opportunity?
[time=1081] Are you asking for help when needed?
[time=1084] Are you doing all that you can with his help because of these precious gifts that he has given us?
[time=1091] And because of this call to deposit that truth into their hearts and lives, are you beginning this process by having that very same truth deeply ingrained in you?
[time=1102] Seems as if that's the beginning.
[time=1106] He goes on in verse seven and he says, you shall teach them these words of mind that are deeply ingrained in you.
[time=1113] You shall teach them, note the word he uses there diligently.
[time=1118] Diligently, he assumes that his word is being taught.
[time=1123] He assumes his word is in you and he assumes that you and I as parents are teaching his word.
[time=1129] Now hold on here, don't go running for the hills on me because I've used this or because God's word uses this phrase, teaching people.
[time=1137] You do it all the time.
[time=1138] You teach them to tie their shoes.
[time=1140] You teach them to use the restroom.
[time=1142] You teach them how to clean their room.
[time=1145] You teach them to mow the lawn.
[time=1147] You're teaching them all the time.
[time=1149] Don't have this now, all of a sudden, be something you can't do.
[time=1154] You can do that.
[time=1157] You can send him and her or him
[time=1163] or him and him and her and her and her.
[time=1166] You can send them to the room to get the Bible story book and you can gather around the floor in the living room and you can take 15 to 20 minutes and read them a Bible story.
[time=1179] And as you read them, the Bible story, you can ask them some questions about what you just read and you can ask your four-year-old some questions and you can ask your 12-year-old some questions and at the end of the story and at the end of the questions.
[time=1198] Now, see that right there for many of you, myself included, see that's hard work.
[time=1205] Five kids, four kids, six kids, two kids, one kid on the floor in the living room with a Bible story book and we're gonna go for about 15 minutes of calm and tension and interaction.
[time=1220] Oh my goodness.
[time=1222] When we first started to try and do that, I would say it took two to three weeks before we ever got to the story.
[time=1231] No, I'm serious because see that's parenting because you're teaching them that there's times when you sit down and you're quiet and you listen and especially with God's word and they don't naturally go that way so you have to teach them.
[time=1248] So there was a good two, three weeks of teaching and instructing and disciplining just so we could get to the story.
[time=1256] Now, two, three years into this deal, we're working at it still, but I tell you what, people, it's not rocket science.
[time=1261] He assumes the word of God is in you and he assumes that you and his apparent do whatever you have to do.
[time=1268] Take whatever time you might have to take, put aside whatever you might have to put aside to sit down on the floor and get a book and read 'em a story, ask 'em questions and then say, hey, why don't we pray?
[time=1282] And you, why don't you pray for grandma?
[time=1286] Why don't you pray for our friend down the street and why don't you pray for what we just learned?
[time=1290] Let's pray.
[time=1291] You want you to hold our hands and let's see, that's not because what I just described has nothing to do with the fact that I'm a pastor, I'm just a dad trying to pass on truth with a Bible story book and a bunch of kids and it's one of the sweetest endeavors God's word says you and I could ever give ourselves to.
[time=1316] But not only, not only is the word in us and not only are we diligently trying to teach it, it says, well, look at verse seven again, you shall teach them diligently these words to your sons and your daughters and shall talk of them, watch this, shall talk of them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way and when you lie down and when you rise up.
[time=1337] See that, there's the Bible time at night after dinner for the 20 minutes where we talk about the truth and read the story and ask the questions and try to pray together and do all that without absolutely blowing up.
[time=1352] And then there's tomorrow, see?
[time=1355] There's tomorrow when we get up and there's tomorrow when we go to school and there's tomorrow when we come home and there's the friend's dad that got sick and died and there's the situation at school that doesn't make sense and there's the argument that they heard between mom and dad and there's the conflict with the little sister that they're having and there's life and see as parents, we have it in us and we try and teach it and then having taught it, we do our best to apply it.
[time=1391] In every situation we can possibly get our hands on.
[time=1395] We connect it to the everyday of life and if I was gonna whittle that down for you and just try and say it really simply see you and I should get really good and we should on a very regular basis be saying this to our kids in the midst of whatever the situation, hey buddy, come here.
[time=1416] Okay, let's remember what does God's words say about that?
[time=1422] Remember we talked about it over here or maybe we didn't talk about it over here and maybe this moment with that friend doing what he or she is doing and this five minute conversation is a chance for me to expose him or her to new truth but the idea is always being willing and ready to say to them, hey, what does God's word say?
[time=1449] Let's look at it and let's connect what is true and right and good to the realities of your life when you rise up, when you lie down, when you walk along the way, we are doing our best to bring scripture and what is right to those situations.
[time=1467] He assumes his word is in you, he assumes his word is being taught, he assumes his word is being applied or connected to the everyday of life and then I love verses eight and nine.
[time=1480] I would love for every one of you to take a creative read.
[time=1484] For every one of you to look at verses eight and nine and say, I wonder how I could do that in my life, in my world today because you see in verse eight it says, you shall bind them as a sign on your hand and they shall be as frontals on your forehead.
[time=1499] See, they would in that day literally attach words from the law to a piece of paper, so to speak, that would be tied to their wrists and up to their hands.
[time=1510] They would, the priests would wear these kinds of headpieces that would have the strings hanging down and attached to the strings hanging in front of their eyes were small words and sayings from the Torah, from the Scriptures and everywhere they went the word was right in front of them and they put it on their door posts and they wrote them on their gates.
[time=1533] His word is everywhere in your life.
[time=1538] What are your kids watching?
[time=1544] What are your kids listening to?
[time=1546] What are you talking to your kids about?
[time=1548] What's going on in the car as you make the trip to here?
[time=1552] What's going on at night before you go to bed?
[time=1555] What are they hearing and seeing in the morning when they get up?
[time=1558] I sense in my heart these days, the word of God leading me to do everything I can, not with rigidity and not with the legalistic kind of harsh rules type atmosphere, but no!
[time=1572] With a heart that's excited about, see, rigidness and legalism comes when the word isn't where, when the word isn't in you, back to point one, people who are just trying to do this to have their kids look good, see when the word's not in you, what comes out of you is stale and cold and rigid.
[time=1594] When the word of God is in you, when you're meeting with him and walking with him and listening to him, then what you give to them and the stuff that you do DVDs and the stuff that you listen to CDs and the conversations that you have and the posters that you make and the things that go on in that house and the atmosphere of their room.
[time=1614] See, when you lead and love them toward all of that, being about what's true and right as much as you can.
[time=1620] And it's in you, it comes out good.
[time=1626] Comes out genuine, it comes out authentic.
[time=1634] Why does he command parents to deposit truth into their children?
[time=1640] And you can go to the golf course and see this
[time=1646] and you and I can go to the grocery store and see this.
[time=1649] We can look into our own lives and see it.
[time=1652] You can also come right here to the text and see that the reason God calls you and I as parents to deposit truth into the lives and the hearts of our kids is blessing, peace and life can be theirs.
[time=1668] And ours.
[time=1671] But see, God promises blessing, peace and life to those who hold faithfully.
[time=1679] Listen carefully and take in his commandments, his word, the scriptures, just in that very same passage.
[time=1686] Look at Deuteronomy 6.10.
[time=1688] Having said all that he said in six to nine, he says in six to 10 then when you do that, it shall come about when the Lord your God brings you into the land which he swore to your father's Abraham, Isaac and Jacob to give you, to give you great and splendid cities which you did not build and houses full of all good things which you did not fill and hewn cisterns which you did not dig vineyards and olive trees which you did not plant and you having done this, you will eat and be satisfied.
[time=1724] Why does God command parents to deposit truth into the lives and hearts of their children?
[time=1731] Blessing, peace and life.
[time=1733] Look at Psalm 19, 7 to 11.
[time=1740] Psalm 19, 7 to 11.
[time=1743] You wanna know why you and I should deposit truth into the hearts and lives of our kids, why it should be in us, why we should teach it, why we should work so hard to apply it to the everyday of their life, why it should be everywhere in their young little worlds 'cause the law of the Lord is perfect, restoring the soul.
[time=1763] The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.
[time=1768] The precepts of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart, the commandment of the Lord is pure enlightening the eyes, the fear of the Lord is clean and during forever the judgments, all of these phrases referring back to the word of God.
[time=1783] The judgments of the Lord are true, they are righteous all together, they are more desirable than gold, more desirable than gold.
[time=1792] Yes, then much fine gold, sweeter also than honey in the drippings of the honeycomb, moreover by them you are servant, moreover by them you are son, moreover by them your daughter is warned in keeping them.
[time=1808] There's great reward.
[time=1809] You might wanna just write that down, you know what, when the word of God gets deposited into the heart and life of another, souls get restored, I'm just going back through the passage.
[time=1821] You see, souls get restored, the simple gain wisdom, hearts are made joyful, eyes are opened, materialism is diminished, wandering fools are warned.
[time=1836] Why does God command parents to deposit the truth of God's word into the hearts and lies of their kids, blessing, peace and life?
[time=1845] Or, or, and this is what's so heartbreaking to see, day in and day out in my world and I know probably yours as well, rebellion, pride and heartache.
[time=1859] If you don't do it, if you don't make the deposit, if you're not willing to make the investment in Deuteronomy 8.11, just a page over.
[time=1868] Deuteronomy 8.11 through 14 says, "Beware that you do not forget the Lord your God by not keeping his commandments and his ordinances and his statutes which I am commanding you today.
[time=1881] Otherwise when you have eaten and are satisfied and have built good houses and lived in them and when your herds and your flocks multiply and your silver and gold multiply and all that you have multiplies, then your heart will become proud and you will forget the Lord your God who brought you out from the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery." Verse 17 says, "Otherwise you may say in your heart, my power and the strength of my hand made me this wealth." Look at 19, it shall come about if you ever forget the Lord your God and go after other gods and serve them and worship them.
[time=1915] I testify against you today that you will surely perish.
[time=1921] Like the nations that the Lord makes to perish before you so you shall perish because you would not listen to the voice of the Lord your God that told you to deposit this truth into the hearts and lives of your kids when they rise up, when they lie down and in and throughout their day.
[time=1941] You know what I like, I like pictures.
[time=1944] They help me, pictures, illustrations help me learn.
[time=1948] And as I'm thinking about this, what we've been talking about here, I'm reminded of an illustration I saw years ago and I've seen it a few times since.
[time=1958] And this is not my illustration.
[time=1959] I want to just say that upfront.
[time=1961] Many of you in the room may have seen this over the years, but this my friends is an illustration of what can happen.
[time=1968] When a God-honoring parent does, what a God-honoring parent's supposed to do.
[time=1975] And this is an illustration of what can happen when a parent chooses not to be God-honoring.
[time=1982] This is an illustration used by a guy named Bruce Wilkinson.
[time=1988] You may have heard his name before in recent years, the author of the prayer of J. Bess.
[time=1992] 20 years ago, I saw on a videotape, Dr. Wilkinson give this example of the three chairs.
[time=1998] Years and years ago, he was here at Blackhawk and did this across the street when church used to meet in the gym.
[time=2006] But here's how this works.
[time=2008] This is just an illustration of all we just said.
[time=2010] Go to Joshua, if you will.
[time=2012] Joshua chapter 24, because you see in Joshua 24, verse 15, it says this.
[time=2019] Joshua says, "Now therefore, fear the Lord "and serve Him in sincerity and truth "and put away the gods, "which your fathers served beyond the river and in Egypt.
[time=2030] "And serve the Lord," Joshua said.
[time=2032] Then he goes on in verse 15 to say, and I love this.
[time=2035] He says, "If it is disagreeable in your sight "to serve the Lord, "if doing this the way that God's called you to do it, "if serving the Lord is something "you're not so sure you want to do, "if you've got a better plan than going do it," he says.
[time=2051] If it's disagreeable in your sight, choose for yourselves today whom you will serve, whether the gods which your fathers serve, which were beyond the river or the gods of the Amorites and whose land you are living.
[time=2062] But, but ask for me, read it with me.
[time=2065] As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.
[time=2070] You know what?
[time=2071] Put Joshua right here.
[time=2073] Chair number one.
[time=2074] As for me and my house, we'll serve the Lord.
[time=2080] And as you look at Joshua's life, you realize he did just that.
[time=2085] He served the Lord.
[time=2087] He served the Lord faithfully.
[time=2089] He served the Lord sincerely.
[time=2092] He knew the Lord, he knew God and personally experienced the miracles of God.
[time=2098] Right there, Joshua, chair one.
[time=2102] As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.
[time=2105] As that passage continues, look down at verse 31, it says in Joshua 24, 31, "Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua "and all the days of the elders who survived Joshua "and had known all the deeds of the Lord "which he had done for Israel." Here we have the next generation, the one that came after Joshua.
[time=2126] They're referred to as the elders.
[time=2128] And as you kind of dissect that text, what you find is that they knew the Lord and they had heard about the works of the Lord.
[time=2137] Joshua knew the Lord and experienced personally the works of the Lord.
[time=2143] This next generation comes, the elders, the generation after.
[time=2147] They knew the Lord had heard about the works of the Lord.
[time=2152] Chair two, then it goes on and we hear about this third chair,
[time=2159] this next generation and to see them, you turn to judges, turn to judges, chapter two.
[time=2165] Just a few pages over, I would suspect in your Bible and there you'll find in judges two, seven, the people serve the Lord all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders who survived Joshua who had seen all the great work of the Lord which he had done for Israel.
[time=2180] Then it says in verse eight, judges two, verse eight and they buried him, the son of none, Joshua died, the servant of the Lord died at the age of 110 and they buried him in the territory of his inheritance in Timnath, Harris and the hill country of Ephraim north of Mount Gash.
[time=2199] Here you go, this is amazing.
[time=2202] Judges two, 10, all that generation, all that generation also were gathered to their fathers.
[time=2210] They died, this generation gathered in heaven before God to their fathers and there arose another generation after whom, after them who did not know the Lord.
[time=2222] And to me that's heartbreaking but people,
[time=2228] that's not the most unbelievably tragic thing in my opinion, the most unbelievably tragic thing in my opinion is the next sentence.
[time=2235] They didn't know the Lord but they didn't even know
[time=2241] of the work nor yet the work which he had done for Israel.
[time=2245] Here's the deal, chair three,
[time=2251] they don't know the Lord.
[time=2253] Their grandfather is who, Joshua.
[time=2260] They don't know the Lord but to me what's almost more mind-boggling is they didn't, they hadn't even heard the stories.
[time=2269] They didn't know about, they didn't know about Jericho.
[time=2274] They didn't know about the trumpets blasting and the people marching in the walls falling down and God delivering the city.
[time=2283] They didn't know about the river parting so the folks could enter the holy land.
[time=2289] They didn't know about the sun and the moon standing still.
[time=2291] They didn't know anything.
[time=2293] They didn't know the Lord and they didn't even know about the works of God.
[time=2301] Wow.
[time=2304] You know what you might want to put here.
[time=2307] If you're writing this down you can, you don't even have to write it.
[time=2310] You'll probably remember at this right here, you can just put a word right here.
[time=2313] The word right here is committed.
[time=2316] Chair one, committed.
[time=2319] We don't talk about that word a lot these days.
[time=2321] Maybe we should talk more about it.
[time=2323] See Chair one, Joshua just said you know what people?
[time=2325] As for me and my house we're gonna serve the Lord.
[time=2328] This chair, the folks that sit here, they're just flat out committed.
[time=2333] They're just gonna give themselves to what is right.
[time=2335] They're just gonna follow Christ no matter what.
[time=2338] Perspective, priority wise, they are just completely and thoroughly given to him.
[time=2342] They are committed and they like it and it's hard sometimes and it sometimes isn't popular and it sometimes costs them but they are as men and women, they are as parents, committed to him.
[time=2357] New the Lord and in that knowing him experienced personally his works, you know what happens here?
[time=2363] It's an amazing thing.
[time=2364] I've seen it.
[time=2365] I've lived it.
[time=2367] Others of you in the room have lived it.
[time=2369] What happens here is that we start out here, I mean we start out here, right?
[time=2376] I mean it's all I knew.
[time=2378] It's all I'd ever seen.
[time=2381] And so there's this sense where I kind of start committed but then gradually it doesn't happen real quick.
[time=2387] But gradually I move from here to kind of here
[time=2393] to kind of here and then I'm 17, 18, 19, 20 and then I'm kind of here and then a little bit of time goes by and I'm kind of back.
[time=2403] But then a little bit of time goes by and I'm kind of not.
[time=2407] And I'm kind of back and I'm kind of not.
[time=2410] And then after a while you know what, I'm just not compromised right here.
[time=2416] This is commitment.
[time=2419] As for me in my house, you know what?
[time=2421] It doesn't matter what.
[time=2422] We're gonna serve him.
[time=2424] We're gonna give ourselves to what is true and right and good.
[time=2427] We will serve him.
[time=2429] I know him but I really don't know much about him.
[time=2432] I've lived this but now as life progresses, compromise slowly but surely sets in which then these folks have kids.
[time=2441] These folks right here, they have kids.
[time=2445] They have their family.
[time=2446] And this gets interesting and sad and see these kids,
[time=2452] they've kind of watched all that.
[time=2457] I've seen all that, I've taken in all of that.
[time=2460] It doesn't look so good.
[time=2464] And what leads and what this leads to in the lives of these third chair, next generation folks many times is you can just write it down, conflict.
[time=2473] These kids are conflicted.
[time=2476] You'll hear him say about this one that they can't find themselves.
[time=2480] You know what?
[time=2481] This guy, this guy knows who he is.
[time=2483] No problems here.
[time=2485] It's for me and my house, we're gonna serve him.
[time=2487] This one over here just can't seem to get it together.
[time=2491] Just can't seem to figure it out, conflicted because of the compromise which used to be committed.
[time=2500] You could put names to this.
[time=2506] You could put down there in chair one, Abraham.
[time=2510] You could put Abraham right here.
[time=2512] Abraham was committed, did Abraham have his issues?
[time=2515] Sure he did, but bottom line when it was all said and done, Abraham knew the Lord, Abraham was committed.
[time=2521] He had a son by the name of what?
[time=2523] Isaac, and if you've studied the life of Isaac and if you haven't, you probably should.
[time=2528] But when you look at the life of Isaac, you realize that in time, Isaac became a man of compromise.
[time=2533] Made some bad decisions.
[time=2536] And he had a son whose name was what?
[time=2542] Jacob.
[time=2543] Jacob who wrestled with God, confused.
[time=2549] Conflicted, confused calamity.
[time=2558] It's an amazing thing.
[time=2562] You know, when you look at this, even just in this story of Joshua and those that came after him, even in the story of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, in a moment we'll look at David, Solomon and Raya Bohem.
[time=2579] But here's the deal, you know what?
[time=2580] First chair people, they value something.
[time=2585] What do you think it is?
[time=2587] Over and above everything else.
[time=2589] I mean, shy of God and his truth, chair one people value something over and above everything else, chair one people value people.
[time=2601] Think about it.
[time=2604] Think about those chair one folks that you know.
[time=2606] I mean, all they really care about, all they ever seem to want to do is help people.
[time=2611] They want to serve people.
[time=2615] They're about people because you see, they know him and they know he said, love me with all your heart.
[time=2621] And beyond that, just make sure you love who?
[time=2624] People, and so they love people and want to serve people and want to give themselves to people.
[time=2630] It's interesting as this kind of leads to this
[time=2638] and this compromise, these folks, they value getting ahead.
[time=2645] That's what chair twos, mostly are about.
[time=2650] They want to get ahead, see, they value vacations and they value cars and they value homes and they value possessions.
[time=2659] These folks value people over and above everything else, hands down.
[time=2663] These folks tend to, tend to value possession, prominence, prestige.
[time=2670] These guys are always looking back at their dads going buy a new car.
[time=2677] I'm sick of seeing you drive that whole thing around.
[time=2682] The dad's always looking back going, it's all right.
[time=2686] It gets me where I'm going.
[time=2688] Chair one values people.
[time=2693] These folks here tend to in their compromise, value possessions.
[time=2699] And I'll tell you what, you sit in this chair and you see enough of that, you watch enough of that.
[time=2704] You see that modeled.
[time=2708] And basically what you begin to value is the next pleasure in your life.
[time=2715] And we've gone from people to possessions to pleasure.
[time=2722] Maybe say it to yourself this way or you can write this down.
[time=2728] Chair one people, as for me in my house, we'll serve the Lord, they know Him.
[time=2733] They're committed to Him.
[time=2734] They're not perfect, but there's a genuine sense where they want to be His.
[time=2738] These folks love people and use things.
[time=2743] Guess what these folks do?
[time=2747] They love things and use who, people.
[time=2753] Which, you see enough of that?
[time=2761] You sit there and have enough of that modeled.
[time=2764] You sit there and have enough of this passed on.
[time=2769] Guess what these folks love?
[time=2771] Absolutely nothing but themselves.
[time=2782] David, put David right here, King David.
[time=2790] David was given by Saul.
[time=2793] Watch this, David is given by Saul a physical kingdom.
[time=2799] But see David, a man after whose heart?
[time=2802] A man after whose heart?
[time=2804] God's own heart.
[time=2805] David takes this physical kingdom that Saul had given to him and David with God's help creates a spiritual kingdom.
[time=2813] Because see David loved God.
[time=2815] And did David have his issues?
[time=2817] You bet.
[time=2818] His heart was God and in the end he develops a spiritual kingdom that he passes on to his son, and here's what?
[time=2826] Solomon.
[time=2827] And as you read the story of Solomon and the kingdom that God had given him passed on from his father David, Solomon takes what was now a spiritual kingdom and in time, because his chair is marked by compromise,
[time=2842] what was a spiritual kingdom now becomes again a physical kingdom.
[time=2848] Oh, what a kingdom it was.
[time=2851] But it was physical and he passes on one of the most unbelievable failures.
[time=2858] The nation of Israel ever knew.
[time=2861] A kid named Rehoboam, Solomon passes on now this physical kingdom that now in Rehoboam's hands becomes absolutely nothing.
[time=2870] It is a debacle.
[time=2872] It is a travesty.
[time=2873] The kingdom is destroyed.
[time=2881] And here's the problem.
[time=2885] Here's the challenge.
[time=2889] These two look a lot alike.
[time=2895] Does that make sense?
[time=2897] I mean if you grew up here, if you learned all this at an early age, these two can tend to externally look an awful lot alike.
[time=2909] In fact, this one, this chair to guy or gal, this chair to mom or dad, they can sometimes rattle off all the books of the Bible faster than they can.
[time=2920] They can sometimes say it backwards.
[time=2922] They can sing it.
[time=2923] They can list it.
[time=2924] They can talk about it.
[time=2926] They've heard it all before and they somehow kind of have a way of presenting themselves in a way that almost looks better.
[time=2939] And it really creates some interesting scenarios.
[time=2943] I sat in my office and laughed watching Wilkinson do this.
[time=2947] I won't do it justice, but I'll try.
[time=2950] The ride to church.
[time=2954] The ride to church, chair two, mom and dad, right?
[time=2958] They're going to church.
[time=2960] And on the drive to church, they argue the entire time.
[time=2965] He is absolutely at her and she is absolutely at him.
[time=2968] They've had a typical horrible week.
[time=2971] The relationship hasn't been close.
[time=2974] The Word of God hasn't been deposited, but they're going to church and they're arguing the whole way there.
[time=2979] And these guys, they're arguing the whole way there too because they have great models on arguing.
[time=2986] And so they argue all the way to church as well.
[time=2988] But see then, chair two gets to church.
[time=2991] And as soon as he gets to church, boom, he's out of the car.
[time=2995] He's going to come over here and let her out for the first time all week.
[time=2999] He hasn't opened a door once.
[time=3002] But Sunday morning he opens the door.
[time=3004] They're still arguing and his quick word to her is just be quiet and grab my arm.
[time=3008] Thank you. Hi, how are you?
[time=3010] And there she is on his arm.
[time=3012] Hey, stop it. Quit it. Just stay in here.
[time=3014] Hi. Yeah, God bless you. Good to see you.
[time=3017] It's good to be in the house of the Lord, isn't it?
[time=3019] And they come in and they take their place in the pew.
[time=3023] And I thought this was really interesting.
[time=3025] He can sit down and she can sit down next to him and they can sit down on that side of him.
[time=3029] And then that day, for whatever reason, the pastor asks him to share his story,
[time=3036] to give a testimony of God's work and his life.
[time=3039] And sure enough, he's up and he's ready and he grabs his Bible and he comes over this chair two guy, you see.
[time=3047] And he grabs his Bible and he stands there behind the lectern and he looks out at the people and he says, "What a privilege it is to share with you today my testimony.
[time=3057] God saved me at the age of 10 from a life of sin, completely transformed me and I have been thankful ever since that day.
[time=3064] This word of his, the Bible, is the most important book in my life.
[time=3069] And I am so grateful for the life that he has given me, for the family, that he's bestowed upon me, and would invite any of you here today to give your life and heart to him so you too can know the peace and the joy that I myself have.
[time=3083] You know what I mean?
[time=3087] And then he prays this long, really eloquent, share two prayer
[time=3094] because he's heard it all and he's seen it all.
[time=3098] And he's praying this long prayer and Sally and Jimmy are sitting there going.
[time=3103] [ Laughter ]
[time=3113] Watch this.
[time=3116] Chair one, testimony.
[time=3120] Here's a chair one story.
[time=3129] Well, I'm humbled and thankful for the opportunity.
[time=3133] Pastor asked me to share with you what God's been doing.
[time=3139] And when he asked me that I just felt compelled to share with you from my heart today
[time=3145] what he taught me and reminded me of this morning in my time with him.
[time=3155] Did you catch that?
[time=3159] This morning in my time with him.
[time=3165] Twenty years ago at the age of ten, God saved me.
[time=3168] No, I'm serious.
[time=3171] See, the chair two person, the only story they really have to tell is one of conversion.
[time=3177] Chair one talks about communion, my life and walk with my God.
[time=3186] And you see enough of this.
[time=3188] You hear enough of this.
[time=3190] You have enough of this model for you.
[time=3192] And guess what?
[time=3196] You don't have a testimony.
[time=3199] You don't have a story because you're so conflicted and you're so confused.
[time=3206] And slowly but surely your heart has just grown further and further and further away from him.
[time=3214] See, the sad thing is, is that over here in chair one, as for me in my house, we will serve the Lord, a mother, a father, an individual who is committed.
[time=3224] See, this person masks in the joy of relationship with God.
[time=3233] And what happens to the second chair person whose life now has become marked by compromise in the pursuit of prestige.
[time=3240] See, this person has a responsibility to God.
[time=3247] We move from a relationship with God to a sense of responsibility to really in the end.
[time=3256] Rejection of God.
[time=3259] Right here.
[time=3261] And it always just boggles my mind and breaks my heart.
[time=3264] It breaks my heart more than it boggles my mind because you know what happens over here in chair three.
[time=3268] They're over here on the edge.
[time=3271] I mean, they're about to absolutely drop off the cliff.
[time=3275] And they seem to be, I mean, on the journey here and even here.
[time=3279] They're always kind of yelling back, "Hey, you're so old-fashioned.
[time=3284] You're so, you're down there on the end.
[time=3287] You're so uptight.
[time=3290] You're so not cool.
[time=3293] You're so behind.
[time=3296] You know, what's your deal anyway?"
[time=3303] He says in Deuteronomy 8, "If you forget the Lord your God and if you don't adhere to the
[time=3310] words that He has spoken, surely, surely you will."
[time=3317] It says perish.
[time=3321] Gone.
[time=3323] Maybe gone literally, but so many times gone spiritually.
[time=3331] And so you've got to ask yourself today, what chair are you in?
[time=3338] Joshua, it's for me in my house we will serve the Lord.
[time=3342] He knew the Lord and experienced the works of the Lord because He had a relationship with
[time=3348] Him.
[time=3349] Those that came after Joshua knew about Him, heard about the stories, in the end have a responsibility to God.
[time=3356] And if you are here, and see, that's my fear.
[time=3362] Of all this up here, this right here, it's my fear for me, right there.
[time=3373] Because if you don't get this figured out, if you don't repent, if you don't get on your
[time=3380] knees and say, "Oh my goodness, look what's happened to me.
[time=3384] Look where I'm going.
[time=3386] Look how I think.
[time=3387] Look at how I choose.
[time=3389] If you don't get that figured out." See, somebody's always watching.
[time=3399] And somebody's always learning.
[time=3401] Somebody's heart and mind is always being shaped.
[time=3405] And so God says to you and me, "Repent from disbelief and rejection.
[time=3410] Repent from your compromise and come and be old fashioned.
[time=3421] Come and be uncool.
[time=3423] Whatever you want to call it, come and know me and serve me and experience firsthand communion
[time=3432] with me, a relationship." See, this is full surrender.
[time=3436] This is partial surrender.
[time=3440] This is, actually might be broken now, but it's not in good shape.
[time=3448] So where are you?
[time=3450] As a mom and a dad, "Hey, better yet, why don't you ask your kids where you are?"
[time=3459] See what they might have to say and understand that if you're here or here, there's hope.
[time=3465] You can sit in this chair.
[time=3467] It's up to you.
[time=3469] As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.
[time=3473] The Word of God will be in me.
[time=3475] I will teach it diligently as best I can.
[time=3479] I will apply it to their hearts and lives in whatever situation I can kind of come up to and put my arms around.
[time=3487] And it will be everywhere.
[time=3489] It will be the Word of God will be everywhere.
[time=3491] Because depositing the truth of God, their hearts and lives brings blessing, life and peace.
[time=3499] Let's stand and pray.
[time=3503] Father, we come before you this morning so very thankful for your Word and the story of Joshua
[time=3510] and his household that chose to serve you.
[time=3512] And we can, many of us in this room, think of first chair people.
[time=3517] We love and respect. Some in the room today might be thinking of first chair people who they've maybe in some way disrespected.
[time=3526] And maybe today God brings a new perspective.
[time=3529] God, I pray that as parents, as grandparents, as mothers and fathers, God with such a precious gift.
[time=3547] [BLANK_AUDIO]
