[time=87] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 199 seconds]
[time=291] - Your deal.
[time=305] - Watch and learn.
[time=307] - Okay, Mr. Card genius.
[time=309] We're ready.
[time=310] What should we play next?
[time=311] - How about Rummy?
[time=313] - Okay.
[time=314] - Hey, how'd you learn how to shuffle like that anyway?
[time=316] I forget.
[time=317] - What did that talk me?
[time=318] - He did?
[time=319] That's funny.
[time=320] I never really remember him.
[time=321] No one had a shuffle really well.
[time=323] - That was a neat thing about growing up.
[time=325] Dad always did different things with each of us.
[time=327] - Yeah, I guess you're right.
[time=328] He did always take time to help me with my science projects and take me to the library.
[time=334] You two were never really into your academics as much as I was.
[time=338] - Well, Emily, not all of us were born with brains of an academic genius.
[time=342] - That's true.
[time=343] - Yeah, that was the neat thing about Dad.
[time=346] He always embraced our individual gifts.
[time=349] Like for me, I will always remember playing golf with him.
[time=352] - Well, you are our family's Tiger Woods.
[time=355] - Well, thank you.
[time=356] - Hey, do you guys remember when we were really little?
[time=360] - And mom and dad would argue a lot at night.
[time=362] - No, I don't really remember any of that.
[time=365] - You must've been too young.
[time=366] - Well, I remember.
[time=368] They used to wait until we were asleep, or at least I thought we were.
[time=374] And then they would start arguing about money and their jobs and stuff like that.
[time=379] - Yeah, then at one point, I think I was seven.
[time=383] Well, you would've been four.
[time=385] Pretty much stopped.
[time=386] - Didn't we move to Florida when I was four?
[time=390] - Yeah, we did.
[time=392] And did you know that almost didn't happen?
[time=394] - No, why?
[time=395] - Yeah, I know.
[time=397] Dad got a job down there, and mom refused to go with him for a while.
[time=402] I can still remember the moving truck pulling in and mom and dad were still arguing on whether or not we were actually going to go.
[time=408] - Well, I'm glad mom finally decided to go.
[time=410] Living in Florida was awesome.
[time=412] - Yeah, I seriously think that was a turning point for mom and dad.
[time=415] After the move, when we started going to church down there, I don't remember them fighting nearly as much, or as often, and besides, Dad and I got to play golf down there year round.
[time=428] - You know what, you're right.
[time=430] After we moved to Florida, they did seem a lot happier, didn't they?
[time=433] - But you know, it's because we started going to church of the family, and mom and dad got involved with that small group with other parents.
[time=440] - Yeah, of course that's why.
[time=443] But I'll tell you, I cannot imagine mom and dad not being happy.
[time=446] They seem like best friends to me.
[time=448] - They are.
[time=449] But it must have been rough for mom to leave her family
[time=455] and move to Florida, ma'am.
[time=457] - Oh, you know, mom.
[time=458] She's so strong and supportive of Dad.
[time=462] - Yeah, I hope I can find a wife just like mom.
[time=466] - Aw, Brad, that is so sweet.
[time=469] - I know, aren't I adorable?
[time=472] - Mom is great, I agree.
[time=474] - Well, aren't my brothers a bunch of mushy men?
[time=478] - Jim.
[time=479] - Honey, I just want you to know that I'm so thankful for you.
[time=486] For you being so supportive of me, even when it wasn't easy for you.
[time=492] - Well, I'm thankful that we've endured together through the hard times.
[time=496] Look at this beautiful family that we've created with God because of it.
[time=502] - Well, I hope our next 30 years are as blessed as our first.
[time=507] - Well, we do want to welcome you this morning.
[time=514] It's so good to have you with us.
[time=516] And we are, if you're joining us for the first time, you're catching us at the tail end of what has been an incredible 10-week series that we entitled for better for worse.
[time=525] God's design for marriage and family.
[time=528] And we have, if you can think back 10 weeks or so, we have tracked this couple from their wedding day, all the way to the porch swing that you just saw.
[time=537] And we have watched them wrestle with tackle and have to deal with all kinds of issues, issues that not only they faced fictitiously, but the very same issues that you and I face each and every day, as we attempt to give ourselves to this thing called marriage and family.
[time=556] We've learned a lot.
[time=557] I would encourage you to visit the Black Hawk to go table out in the foyer there.
[time=562] You can get a CD, a DVD, some tapes.
[time=565] Grab the whole 10 weeks if you need to, but God has done some amazing things.
[time=569] He has reminded us of some great truth.
[time=572] He has shown us some new things that have been challenging and encouraging for many of us.
[time=577] And I wanna just real briefly, if I can, take you back to a slide that we've gone back to each and every week, just kind of a review slide as to the things we've seen so far in God's design.
[time=588] In God's design, men, we saw on Ephesians 5 that husbands love their wives sacrificially.
[time=594] We were reminded there that our love for our wife is to mirror that of Christ's love for us.
[time=602] And He gave up everything for us.
[time=605] He went to the cross for us.
[time=607] He endured pain for us.
[time=609] He did everything He could do to meet our need.
[time=613] And as husbands, God's word says to you and I that we are to love our wives that very same way.
[time=619] No matter what, we are to be tireless in our efforts of love and devotion and sacrifice toward her.
[time=630] In God's design, husbands love their wives sacrificially children.
[time=635] Children, we saw that in God's design, we are to obey our parents immediately, completely, and joyfully.
[time=645] It says they're in Ephesians 6.
[time=647] Children, obey your parents in the Lord for this is right.
[time=652] And it doesn't say that you're to obey them on their good days.
[time=657] It says you're to obey them each and every day.
[time=661] Husbands are to love their wives sacrificially.
[time=664] Children, we saw in God's design are to obey and extend respect to their mother and father.
[time=671] Wives, we saw in 1 Peter chapter three that God's design for you is that you would live with a spirit of submission with your husband.
[time=680] And we were able to kind of debunk what has been in modern society.
[time=686] We were able to kind of take a look at this idea of submission, something that they have trashed, something that they have kind of run down.
[time=693] And we were able to see as a family that's submission when approached from a godly perspective as a really, really sweet opportunity for you as a woman.
[time=702] It's not always easy.
[time=704] Sometimes it's faith stretching, but it's a great opportunity for you as a woman to come alongside and offer the input, offer the respect, offer the trust, offer the relationship that God has called you to give to Him.
[time=720] And He sometimes is difficult to live with.
[time=722] He sometimes is hard to trust.
[time=725] He sometimes doesn't always handle life or the kids or you the way that He should.
[time=731] And except for situations of blatant sin, which sometimes He might call you into, except for that which you are to turn and walk away from.
[time=743] God says He'll be enough for you.
[time=745] Trust God, give yourself to Him.
[time=748] Somebody contacted me this week and felt like I had been completely out of bounds in our teaching on that, that I had somehow insinuated or somehow implied that a woman should subject herself to beating.
[time=763] And I just wanna remind you, and I tried to remind the gal that we had said on several occasions that submission, godly submission never would extend itself to physical harm.
[time=776] It never would extend itself towards spiritual sin and it never extends itself to physical harm.
[time=781] We would never, ever encourage a woman to go that direction.
[time=786] In God's design, husbands love their wives, children obey their parents, wives live with a spirit of submission and then moms and dads come together and we began last week to look at God honoring parents.
[time=800] And the first thing we looked at was how God honoring parents.
[time=803] In God's design, they deposit truth.
[time=806] God honoring moms and dads deposit truth, the truth, the truth of God's word, into the hearts and lives of their children.
[time=816] And there were some things in Deuteronomy six that we saw and I'll just kinda go back through them quickly for you this morning.
[time=821] There were some principles there in Deuteronomy six that we pulled out and it seems as if God just would be kind of assuming that you and I as parents in this effort to give ourselves in a God honoring way to our children, it seems as if these were the things that he assumes you and I would be absolutely and completely given to.
[time=842] He assumes that his word is in you.
[time=846] He's assuming that as a mom or a dad that we're doing whatever we have to do, taking whatever steps we might need to take to have the word of God deposited in us.
[time=855] Maybe that's a men's Bible study.
[time=860] Maybe that's a couple's home group, maybe it's an ABF.
[time=863] But he's assuming, mom and dad, that you're going to great lengths to have the word of God deposited into you.
[time=870] He assumes that you're then taking that word and teaching it diligently, Deuteronomy six said, teaching it diligently, explaining it carefully.
[time=881] When you wake up and when you go to bed and when you walk here and there, Deuteronomy six says he assumes that you're teaching it and not only teaching it but then he assumes you're applying it, coming alongside them in their lives and helping them connect these situations that they're facing to the truth of God's perfect word, the word that he intended for them to have so it could guide them through all those things that they're facing.
[time=911] He assumes it's in you, he assumes you're teaching it, he assumes you're connecting it to the everyday of their life.
[time=918] He assumes that because you're mom or dad and you're making the decisions that the word of God he assumes it's everywhere in your world, everywhere in their world as it relates to what you watch, as it relates to what you listen to, as it relates to what goes on in the car, as it relates to what's in the house.
[time=937] I mean, he just assumes that you're doing all that you can to in the midst of a culture that wants to inundate them with absolute garbage, he's assuming that you're bringing the truth of scripture and the scripture itself into, we got fire issues all over the place, don't we?
[time=955] We got things burning, first hour I blew out a fire on the backstage, we appreciate the patriotic effort though.
[time=962] There are some things that God assumes.
[time=965] Number one, last week we saw God honoring parents
[time=971] to posit God's truth into the hearts and lives of their kids, number two, get out your pins, here we go, second part today, God honoring parents bring discipline to their children's hearts and lives.
[time=983] God honoring parents bring discipline to their children's hearts and lives, I got a note a few weeks ago from a friend explaining a new discipline method, there are so many discipline methods out there and this I thought was very interesting, he was going on and on about this new discipline method that he had discovered and it seemed to be very effective, he talked about how when his seven year old son would begin to misbehave, he now took his son for a ride, he described taking his son for a car ride and how each and every time now when they would go on a car ride, when they got back, the son's behavior would be unbelievably adjusted and how the car rides were becoming more and more infrequent, less and less needed and then he sent actually a picture of the car ride.
[time=1033] With him there and you see the speed track, you see the radar, jug gun coming in at 99 miles an hour, my goodness, so we're going to try that at our home, I know soon.
[time=1047] God's word has some amazing things to say about discipline,
[time=1055] probably, oh you might want to debate it, but one of the most classic of all texts and one of the most insightful passages you'll ever read about discipline you find in Hebrews 12.
[time=1068] And would you stand this morning with me in honor of God's word as I read to you Hebrews 12 verses five to 11 and then we'll just pray and ask God to open our hearts and eyes and our souls to the truth that he would have for you and I this morning in the parenting arena.
[time=1086] It says and have you and you have forgotten Hebrews 12 five and you have forgotten the exhortation which is addressed to you as sons.
[time=1096] My son do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord nor faint when you are reproved by him for those whom the Lord loves he disciplines and he scourges every son whom he receives.
[time=1110] It is for discipline that you endure.
[time=1112] God deals with you as with sons for what son is there?
[time=1116] Whom his father does not discipline, but if you are without discipline of which all have become partakers then you are illegitimate.
[time=1124] Children and not sons, furthermore verse nine, we had earthly fathers to discipline us and we respected them.
[time=1133] Shall we not much rather be subject to the father of spirits and live?
[time=1138] For they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them, but he disciplines us for our good so that we may share his holiness.
[time=1149] And then here's verse 11, all discipline.
[time=1152] The discipline that God brings, the discipline that a parent brings, the discipline that a teacher brings, the discipline that a coach brings, all discipline for the moment seems not to be joyful but sorrowful yet to those who have been trained by it afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness.
[time=1176] Pray with me, would you father, we come before you this morning with this arena of parenting and making a deposit God into their lives and we know as parents, we know as grandparents, we know as aunts and uncles, we know as those who someday might be parents, we know God that a deposit is made.
[time=1202] One way or the other God, we know that our lives and our choices, God in the things that we do and don't do God, it is a deposit that is made into their impressionable hearts and minds and God we pray that you would teach and grow us so that we could make a deposit that would honor you.
[time=1223] God that we could invest in them, our hearts and our lives in such a way God that they could gain a picture of you.
[time=1233] And God for those who are just beginning on the parenting journey, I pray these would be times of new insights and the hope that comes with a future of opportunity.
[time=1245] God for those who have been down the road, may it be a time of reminder, possibly a time of repentance.
[time=1253] And God may we see and come face to face again today with the fact that there is always with you the opportunity for a new beginning.
[time=1262] God we thank you for your word and the truth that it brings.
[time=1267] Open our hearts to it today and your son's name we pray.
[time=1270] [AMEN] You can be seated.
[time=1273] Here's a definition for you this morning.
[time=1274] If you're taking notes, you can write this down to discipline.
[time=1277] Discipline is to instruct.
[time=1279] It is to educate and enforce proper rules, regulations or expectations.
[time=1285] It lovingly, I would add that word lovingly.
[time=1288] It lovingly brings correction.
[time=1291] Godly discipline, the discipline of a mom or a dad that's seeking to honor God.
[time=1296] It lovingly brings correction, admonishment, chastisement, encouragement and punishment, all for the purpose of future usefulness.
[time=1307] You want your son or daughter to be useful in the future.
[time=1311] You want your son or daughter to experience spiritual usefulness.
[time=1315] You want them to experience literal usefulness in the everyday of life.
[time=1319] God's word says bring discipline to their little hearts and lives.
[time=1326] God honoring parents, bring discipline to the hearts and lives of their kids and they do this in a number of different ways.
[time=1333] We'll kind of focus our attention on three of those ways this morning.
[time=1337] If you're taking notes, write this down.
[time=1339] They bring discipline through routine.
[time=1342] God honoring parents, bring discipline into the hearts and lives of their kids through routine.
[time=1348] At the very beginning of it all is when this deposit of routine can begin.
[time=1354] Just think with me for a moment about a newborn baby.
[time=1358] There are some things we know about a newborn baby.
[time=1361] A newborn baby is cute, a newborn baby is cuddly, a newborn baby is oftentimes an answer to prayer.
[time=1368] There are so many wonderful, sweet things about a newborn baby.
[time=1374] You know that and I know that.
[time=1376] They are an absolute gift but we also know from a theological and spiritual perspective that though they are cute cuddly and oftentimes celebrated, they are at the core of their little being.
[time=1392] What?
[time=1392] Sinful.
[time=1394] Sinful and sinful at that point not because of necessarily choices they've made.
[time=1400] They're just sinful at that point 'cause they're human and they carry with them at the core of their being the same thing you and I carry at the core of our being and that is our sin nature.
[time=1411] Newborn babies, sinful and not only sinful
[time=1417] from the get go but absolutely without any frame of reference on how to choose what is right or good or true or God honoring.
[time=1428] They don't have a clue and they're bent and if you've had kids you know this.
[time=1435] In times you see they're bent.
[time=1437] In times at 12 months, 18 months, 24 months you begin to see that left to themselves their sinful nature finds expression and choices that they make.
[time=1450] And so God gives these little cute cuddly, sinful beings, parents, he gives them parents to help move them away from their sin nature
[time=1465] by teaching them how to choose what is right and good and true and God honoring.
[time=1472] See he gives them parents to help them move away from their sin nature by teaching them when to choose what is right and true and God honoring.
[time=1483] By teaching them why to choose what is good and true and right and God honoring.
[time=1491] See he gives them parents to help them move away from their sin nature and obviously the spirit of God participates in that endeavor as well but on the parenting front he gives them moms and dads to teach them what happens when you don't choose what is right and good and God honoring.
[time=1513] See our God is a God of order people.
[time=1516] Our God is a God of order.
[time=1519] God is not confused.
[time=1522] God is not scattered.
[time=1525] God is not here and there.
[time=1528] God is not worn out.
[time=1529] God is a God of order and we have been made in his image and he gives moms and dads to bring appropriate order
[time=1543] into the hearts and lives of these little ones who end up growing into big ones.
[time=1548] See parents teach that there are parameters.
[time=1551] God honoring parents teach that there are lines.
[time=1555] Lines that God has drawn.
[time=1559] I've started doing something in the last six months
[time=1565] with our little Evie who's now two but I've done with every one of our kids when they were about two and you know you might think I'm nuts, you may think I'm demented.
[time=1576] Most people think a lot of things about me so I'll just go ahead and share it with you but I've just found it to be really, really important.
[time=1583] See the last few months I've been taking Evie down to the end of the driveway.
[time=1587] 'Cause I really, really love Evie.
[time=1592] And I take Evie down to the end of our driveway and our driveway is rock and then when the rock ends it's asphalt and that's not the driveway anymore that's the street.
[time=1602] And not at our place, there's cars moving up and down that street often.
[time=1607] Sometimes rapidly.
[time=1608] And so I'll take Evie out there just her and I and I'll kind of kneel down there at the end of the driveway with her and I'll sneeze there with her on the rock and I'll have a smile on my face and I'll point to the rocks and I'll say that's good Evie and she'll say yeah that's good dad and I'll hug her.
[time=1626] And I'll say the rock right here, the dry was good.
[time=1629] And then I'll take her out over the rock and go on to the black asphalt and my expressional change.
[time=1636] And I'll get a very stern look on my face and it'll be very serious.
[time=1642] And I'll take my finger and I'll look in her eyes and I'll say Evie this right here, this is not good, this is bad.
[time=1648] And she'll look at the asphalt and she'll kind of look at me like what are you talking about?
[time=1652] And then I'll take her hand and I'll spank, I'll swat her right on her hand and it'll kind of hurt and then I'll just look right down at that black asphalt and say Evie this is not good, this is no.
[time=1665] And then I'll take her back to the rock and I'll bend back down and I'll have this big smile on my face and now she's completely confused and I'll hug her and I'll say this is good.
[time=1677] And I'll do that about three times.
[time=1681] Her little hand will be a little pink and we'll go walking back to the house and I'm sure the first time she's walking back to the house thinking this guy has lost it.
[time=1689] But you walk to the end of our driveway, you walk to the end of any driveway with any of my kids and they'll stop and they've been doing that since they were about two and a half because I want so desperately to teach them that disobedience hurts.
[time=1717] It's really, really painful.
[time=1720] That's what God says and that's what His word portrays, that disobedience hurts.
[time=1728] And I'm okay helping her realize that with a stinging little wrist 'cause I would rather her not feel that with a car going 50.
[time=1740] See God honoring parents, they help from a very young age establish parameters and they help them see that there are lines, that there are boundaries put in place by a good God to be obeyed.
[time=1755] And the way kids learn to obey God is when they learn from a very, very early age to obey you.
[time=1763] See, that's how they learn to obey God when they learn to obey you, their parent.
[time=1774] Ephesians 6-1, children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right.
[time=1780] And so they bring this discipline, they bring this teaching through what I'll just call the routine of obedience, the routine of obedience.
[time=1791] You see what you do as a mom or a dad with the routine of obedience is see you interact with them in a way and you're in relationship with them in a way that says to them from a very early age it's time to go to bed.
[time=1808] It's time to wake up.
[time=1815] It's time to play with your toys.
[time=1819] Actually, you know what?
[time=1820] It's time to share your toys.
[time=1823] And not only is it time to play with them and share them with a friend, but hey, you know what?
[time=1829] Now it's time to pick them up.
[time=1834] See, that's what moms and dads do.
[time=1836] They interact and live in relationship with their kids, especially early on saying, you know what?
[time=1840] It's time, it's time to clean your room.
[time=1845] It's time to get off the computer.
[time=1848] It's time to, now we're getting older.
[time=1852] It's time to come home.
[time=1853] And that's not done rigidly and it doesn't have to be done
[time=1859] with a bad attitude, it can be done lovingly and kindly, but see, that's what moms and dads, see it's time to do this.
[time=1867] Or we can listen to modern secular thought
[time=1874] and we can read the books on modern parenting techniques and we can leave that behind and we can leave the decision-making out of our hands and we can say to them, and I'm not poking fun at anybody here, okay?
[time=1889] If I'm poking fun at anybody, I'm poking fun at me because I can find myself at times doing this.
[time=1895] Hey, do you wanna go to bed?
[time=1899] Oh, God, please.
[time=1901] Do you wanna go to bed?
[time=1903] Would it be okay if you shared your, would it be alright if you shared your toys?
[time=1909] Yeah?
[time=1910] Do you, oh, do you wanna go?
[time=1912] Do you wanna go on a walk?
[time=1915] Do you wanna, do you want now we're getting a little older?
[time=1918] Do you wanna, do you wanna come home now?
[time=1921] Oh, no, okay, well what?
[time=1922] And see, here's what happens because they're just little kids, especially back here at the early stages.
[time=1932] Do you wanna, do you, would you like to?
[time=1934] How about if we, see, they don't know what to do with that.
[time=1938] Because he's not supposed to figure all that out, you are.
[time=1952] It's time!
[time=1954] And again, that can be communicated lovingly
[time=1961] and that can be communicated in, it doesn't have to be a strong, harsh, mean thing.
[time=1967] But it's gotta be communicated.
[time=1971] And you know what else in that I just thought of it was that in God's design, when he asks you and I to do things, when God asks you and I, when God says to you, and God says to me, grown adults, when he says, hey, it's time to obey the government and pay your taxes.
[time=1995] When he says to you or me, hey, it's time to treat that difficult person with respect.
[time=2002] When he says to you or me, hey, it's time, you adult, you, hey, it's time to be honest.
[time=2011] Does he, does he expect you and I, when does he expect you and I to do that?
[time=2016] Now or later?
[time=2020] And if we choose later with God, as he comes to you and I and says, hey, it's time, if we as adults choose later, we get into what?
[time=2031] Trouble.
[time=2033] Because that's the way it is.
[time=2041] Without discipline and parameters, without the routine of obedience, we give kids too many choices.
[time=2046] Oh my goodness, and then we start doing this.
[time=2049] Then the choice thing gets a little confusing and then we get real frustrated, so we start saying, look, if you'll go to sleep, I'll give you a cookie.
[time=2058] If you clean up your room, I'll let you watch the video.
[time=2067] We begin to negotiate with four, five, and six, and seven, and eight, nine, and ten, and twelve, or any more.
[time=2074] Sixteen, seventeen-year-olds, which teaches them from the very beginning one thing that obedience is optional.
[time=2082] I may want the cookie, I may not.
[time=2087] I think I'll stay up.
[time=2090] When it should be done.
[time=2097] The teeth should be brushed, and the bed should be gotten into, and the room should get cleaned up, and the toy should be shared, because you asked them to, because you're their parent, and God gave them to you to help move them away from their sinful nature by teaching them the routine of obedience.
[time=2120] Somebody said it this way, if you're not going to require them at age two, three, four, five, if you're not going to require them to go to bed now, pick up their toys when asked, finish their dinner in an appropriate amount of time, or look people in the eye and say, thank you, why would you at fourteen, fifteen, sixteen?
[time=2145] Require them to be home by ten, be kind to younger siblings, stay away from drugs and promiscuous behavior, and think for a moment that they will.
[time=2158] Why would you expect, you're saying, wait a minute, now you're equating eating, you're equating finishing their peas, with their moral behavior?
[time=2172] Yeah.
[time=2177] Yeah, see, it begins with the peas.
[time=2182] It begins with the room.
[time=2184] It begins with it's time to sit still.
[time=2187] Well, due to the sinful nature,
[time=2193] the requiring of obedience will at times need reinforcement.
[time=2198] And in God's design, He says, do not neglect the paddle.
[time=2204] We bring discipline through routine, we bring discipline through, you can write this down, it's the second R through the rod, as the scriptures refer to it.
[time=2216] An instrument, an instrument of correction, an instrument of warning.
[time=2226] We had a great discussion at staff this week, we got some older guys on our staff, I won't mention any names or anything, but I heard some stories, I learned about switches, some of you 50 and overs, you know about switches, I heard stories of dads walking out in the backyard with pocket knives and cutting off branches and skin in the leaves, and I was just shaking thinking about it.
[time=2255] And it might be a switch, it might be a paddle, it might be a spoon, it might be a belt, it could be a number of different things, but what this is about is a God-ordained method of correction.
[time=2268] A painful reminder of what is true and right and good.
[time=2274] A biblical reinforcement that disobedience hurts and much, much, much better for you to feel the hurt of this instrument.
[time=2286] Now and be corrected then become a 21-year-old who needs a spanking.
[time=2296] We got a lot of those running around today, 21-22-year-olds who need to be paddled because it hasn't been removed from them.
[time=2310] Look at what the Bible says, Proverbs 13-24.
[time=2313] Proverbs 13-24 says "He who withholds his rod hates his son, but he who loves him, disciplines him diligently go on to Proverbs 15.
[time=2326] Now 19, discipline your son while there is hope and do not desire his death.
[time=2331] There the Scripture clearly insinuates that we put their lives at stake.
[time=2338] When we're not willing to take the time and make the effort to discipline them, in this case with the rod, lovingly and consistently, Proverbs 22-15 says foolishness, every one of you who has ever had kids.
[time=2354] You know this is true.
[time=2355] Foolishness is bound up.
[time=2357] There's that sinful nature that we were born with.
[time=2360] It is bound up in the heart of a child.
[time=2362] The rod of discipline will remove it far from him.
[time=2367] Goes on in Proverbs 23-13 to say do not hold back discipline from the child, although you strike him with the rod he will not die.
[time=2379] See again modern secular thought, the books that you and I would read.
[time=2383] They would say to you, oh no, no, no, no.
[time=2386] You don't want to do that.
[time=2388] You do that and you'll lose them.
[time=2392] You do that and they'll hate you.
[time=2394] No, no, no.
[time=2395] God's word says you don't do that.
[time=2397] You'll lose them.
[time=2399] Foolishness and sin will eat them for lunch.
[time=2405] They'll be okay.
[time=2408] If you do it right, and we'll talk about that in a moment.
[time=2412] Proverbs 29-15 says there the rod and reproof give wisdom.
[time=2420] The rod and reproof give wisdom, but a child who gets his own way brings shame and embarrassment
[time=2430] and humiliation to his mother or father.
[time=2436] And you have been in the grocery store and you have seen it with your own eyes.
[time=2441] And you have been in the hallway of your own home.
[time=2444] And you have seen it with your own eyes.
[time=2447] When you haven't done what God's word calls you to do, when you think you can talk it through with them, when you think you can reason with them, when you think that you can negotiate with them, when you think you can ground them for two weeks at an early age, which really just in the end exasperates them further.
[time=2464] And when you have neglected the one form that God chose to articulate, you have seen what it develops, you have seen what it brings.
[time=2479] They need it.
[time=2481] And God's word calls you and I to give it to them lovingly.
[time=2484] It's not a beating, it's not a whipping, it's not a humiliation, it is a loving correction.
[time=2490] What do I mean by that?
[time=2492] You know what?
[time=2494] And I'm still in process on this.
[time=2496] I'm still learning, I'm still growing, I still make mistakes, but I'll tell you what, you should never do it angry.
[time=2503] There are times in my world where I'll have to say, "Hey, you know what?
[time=2508] Why don't you go have a seat on my bed?" And I say that really calmly.
[time=2515] And Belgo, sit on my bed and then I'll go sit down and talk to Kevrin.
[time=2519] I'll do this right now.
[time=2523] She'll say, "Do you think I should or do you think we should just wait?" And sometimes I'll just say, "You know, I think I should just wait because I'm really, really hot." And the last thing that that little life needs in an effort to be corrected and loved is a really hot out of control, "Dad, no, they need a quiet calm understanding
[time=2552] of the situation.
[time=2553] Dad, who's going to sit on the end of the bed and say, "Hey, do you realize what happened?" I mean, let's just real briefly talk this through.
[time=2562] You were asked this.
[time=2564] You did this.
[time=2566] That's disobedient.
[time=2570] And we know because of what God's word tells us that disobedience is always what?
[time=2575] And they look at me and they say hurts.
[time=2580] And so then, you know, I'll administer the punishment, the correction.
[time=2587] And you know, and if you're curious, you know, that administering of it, that gets to be less and less and less as the years go by when you're faithful to give yourself to the process as the years go by.
[time=2600] And then when it's done, you know, we get a big hug.
[time=2604] And then we pray.
[time=2607] And then we go back to the scene of the crime.
[time=2611] And before we go off to play, or before we go off to meet the buddy, before we go off and do whatever it is, we're going to go off and do.
[time=2618] We go back to the scene of the crime.
[time=2620] And whatever didn't get done right gets done right.
[time=2624] Just to go through the motion, yes, of doing the right thing.
[time=2630] And whether that's a two-year-old, and we go back to the four-year-old and we kneel down with the blocks and we say, now, give, you know, it could be just that.
[time=2641] But we always go back and do it right.
[time=2644] And it ends with a hug, it ends with a prayer.
[time=2648] And it's not done in anger.
[time=2652] Yelling isn't discipline.
[time=2656] Volume doesn't soften hearts.
[time=2661] It hardens them.
[time=2669] We've been called to bring discipline through the routine of obedience through the rod, and then, lastly, through relationship.
[time=2677] Dean, you want to come up and set up that easel forming?
[time=2682] Through the routine of obedience through the rod, and then, lastly, just write this down through relationship.
[time=2690] And we could talk a lot about the relationship thing, but I want to just say this to you.
[time=2695] On the relationship thing, could your son or daughter, I mean, the ones that could articulate it, could they say with absolute confidence
[time=2708] that there is absolutely nothing they could do?
[time=2713] Nowhere they could go.
[time=2715] Could they say about you and your love for them, that they know in their heart that there isn't anything they could become or any place they could go, that there isn't anything that could separate them from your love?
[time=2735] That might sound familiar to you, that's Romans 8, into the chapter where it talks about the love of God and how nothing can separate us from it.
[time=2744] Doesn't mean there's not discipline, doesn't mean there's not consequences, doesn't mean there aren't rough days.
[time=2750] But that, I think, is the essence.
[time=2752] In my opinion, that's the essence of relationship.
[time=2754] Does he or she know that?
[time=2759] Let me show this to you.
[time=2761] Came across this years ago and just, you got an insert, you can fill this in if you want to, or you can just watch.
[time=2768] Here is how they tell us to do it today in modern parenting philosophy.
[time=2776] They say, and it's like a funnel, they say on the parenting funnel that you want a really, really big circle at the bottom, they say, give that child a lot of, you can fill it in.
[time=2791] Freedom, and we're talking about zero to eight.
[time=2796] They say, whatever you do, you know, give that kid a lot of freedom.
[time=2801] You know, let him roam.
[time=2803] They say, don't squelch, you can fill it in.
[time=2805] Don't squelch his or her creativity.
[time=2808] Don't diminish their personality.
[time=2811] Don't restrict their expression.
[time=2814] Whatever you do, don't oppress their spirit.
[time=2818] Modern parenting philosophy says, we want them what?
[time=2822] We want that kid happy.
[time=2826] So give him freedom.
[time=2828] And in the end, you know what?
[time=2830] If you do that, they'll be your buddy.
[time=2837] Well, here's the bad news.
[time=2840] When the circle's really, really, really big, and you're following them around all day, asking them what they want to do, they learn who's in control.
[time=2850] And when they respond negatively to that, when they're four years old or five years old, we call that, you can fill it in, we call that what?
[time=2860] Cute, oh, isn't that cute?
[time=2863] You know, he's just four, he's just five.
[time=2866] Problem is, they don't stay four and five.
[time=2870] They turn into 16-year-olds.
[time=2873] And with the huge circle and the lack of discipline and the total freedom, what was cute at four later becomes tragic,
[time=2884] even life-altering.
[time=2890] Guaranteed.
[time=2893] It was cute when they were four.
[time=2895] Now they're 16 making choices.
[time=2898] And then all of a sudden mom and dad go, "Oh, wait, this was a bad idea." And boom!
[time=2904] Tighten the circle.
[time=2905] Now we're gonna, what?
[time=2908] Control.
[time=2909] Oh, yeah, and what were those three things they were talking about at church?
[time=2913] We need some routine.
[time=2914] Where's that rod?
[time=2916] And we'll have a little bit of relationship, you know?
[time=2918] Boom, boom, boom.
[time=2921] Fact of the matter is, at 16, it's not hopeless.
[time=2924] By any stretch, it's just really late in the game.
[time=2927] To start bringing the control and the routine and the rod probably can't do the rod, then.
[time=2936] And then you're gonna have to really work on the relationship.
[time=2940] What you wanna do is just flip-flop that.
[time=2943] All right?
[time=2944] I won't even draw it.
[time=2945] Just flip-flop it.
[time=2947] You know what God calls you to?
[time=2950] God calls you to a really tight circle at the beginning, right?
[time=2954] That moves up toward what?
[time=2959] Freedom, right there.
[time=2962] He says, you know what?
[time=2963] Control, yeah, we hate the word.
[time=2965] Control 'em.
[time=2967] Lovingly, passionately, with purpose, bring the three Rs into their life from the very beginning.
[time=2975] Bring discipline, bring time, bring the energy, bring the effort.
[time=2980] Do everything you have to do to give yourself to those three Rs from zero to eight.
[time=2984] You're going, well, my goodness, Kelly, that's gonna take a lot of time.
[time=2991] Absolutely.
[time=2994] A ton of time and a ton of energy and a ton of work from zero to eight provide a foundation that will allow for freedom later.
[time=3004] See, you control early on.
[time=3005] You can fill this in.
[time=3006] You can control early on.
[time=3008] You can even then begin doing a few years' coach, which turns into a few years later counseling, which in the end, oh man, I cannot wait for this day when with my grown kids I can have community.
[time=3023] Rich relationship, spiritual and literal.
[time=3029] And you know what?
[time=3030] Somewhere between community and counselor?
[time=3033] We talked about this.
[time=3034] Probably somewhere in there is where real friendship begins.
[time=3039] Real people, real friendship doesn't happen down here.
[time=3045] God didn't give them to you to be their buddy.
[time=3048] Initially, He gave them to you to lovingly move them away from their sin nature.
[time=3054] Band, come on up if you would.
[time=3057] Lovingly move them away from their sin nature and teach them and take whatever amount of time it takes to teach them and love them and invest in them.
[time=3068] Not only the Word of God, but the discipline, the loving corrective discipline of God.
[time=3077] Hey, you may have lots of questions we'd love to try our best to come alongside you and answer them however we can.
[time=3084] You may have questions about the series.
[time=3086] You may have questions about this issue of parenting.
[time=3089] Please let us know if we can help and encourage you in any way.
[time=3093] Before we leave this morning though, you are going to absolutely be amazed at this tribute that our team has put together.
[time=3100] As we conclude the series on marriage and family, there are many in our midst who have stayed at it.
[time=3107] They're not perfect, they haven't arrived, but they've stayed faithful and they have endured and they have come to a point where we can today celebrate what God has done.
[time=3116] And so be encouraged as you listen to this song and as you see these faces, people who have over the years been faithful to the commitment that they've made to love and care for and come alongside.
[time=3130] Praise God for them and we hope you're encouraged.
[time=3155] [MUSIC - 292 seconds]
[time=3448] (audience applauding) - Man, that fires me up.
[time=3451] Oh.
[time=3452] (audience applauding) For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife and the two will become one flesh, so they are no longer two but one.
[time=3464] Therefore what God has joined together let man not separate.
[time=3468] [AMEN] Would you stand up and would you just join me in a closing word of prayer?
[time=3474] God, we thank you for that faithful cloud of witnesses that marches out there in front of so many of us, and we know they're not perfect, and we know they've had their days.
[time=3486] But God, we are so grateful that they are today together.
[time=3490] And in being together, they're a testimony, God, of not only their own commitment, but God, your great love and the strength that only you provide.
[time=3501] And so please, God, continue to be at work in our hearts and lives with our marriages and our families.
[time=3507] God, we recognize that you designed it, so God, please give us the strength and courage to follow that design, where we need help.
[time=3515] God, give us the courage and the humility to ask for it, and God, allow us to, if it be your will, come together again soon to enjoy this sweet fellowship.
[time=3526] Thank you for what you're doing in the lives of this church.
[time=3529] Thank you for what you've done today and all the people agreed and said, "Amen.
[time=3534] God bless you.
[time=3535] We'll see you soon."
