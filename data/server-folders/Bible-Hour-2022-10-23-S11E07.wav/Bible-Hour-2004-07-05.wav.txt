[time=30] (upbeat music)
[time=60] (upbeat music) - Good morning, and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=85] It's great to have you here.
[time=86] My name's Steve.
[time=87] I'm one of the teaching pastors here at Black Hawk.
[time=90] And a couple things I'd like to encourage you to attend.
[time=93] On August 12th, 13th, and the 14th, we will be a satellite host for the Willow Creek Association Leadership Summit.
[time=102] It's a great time.
[time=103] And you ought to consider signing up and participating with us in that satellite conference.
[time=109] It's gonna be a great time, great speakers.
[time=111] Lots of time for you to interact with people here as well.
[time=114] And then on the 15th, the Sunday of that weekend, we'll be hosting a baptismal outdoors at the Stillwater Camp.
[time=122] And that's a great time.
[time=124] We get to baptize several people.
[time=126] It's a great event, and we'd encourage you to participate with us.
[time=129] That's August 15th, Sunday afternoon.
[time=132] Well, this morning, we get a chance to look into the word and see what it has to say about what we might be doing that God would see as contemptible offerings.
[time=146] In Malachi 1, Malachi goes after the people for God and says that they've been offering some things up to God that don't honor him, that don't show him the respect that is due him.
[time=159] So today, we're gonna look at what might be happening in our church that would reflect that same kind of bad attitude.
[time=165] What might our prayer life be like?
[time=167] What might our life of obedience be like?
[time=169] What might our service life be like, our giving life?
[time=173] What might be contemptible offerings to God that we get in ruts and things that we're doing something for him?
[time=178] So stay with us, will you, and learn from God's word what it has to say about us giving him sacrifices that are a sweet aroma to him.
[time=187] - That give reason for you not to be welcomed
[time=193] in his presence.
[time=194] (gentle music)
[time=205] (gentle music) But the fact is, if you know him,
[time=215] if you know Jesus Christ, if you know the one whose blood covers our unwelcomedness, you become welcomed in God's presence.
[time=224] And it's such a gift, such an honor.
[time=233] And it's only through his blood.
[time=236] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 420 seconds]
[time=671] - Thank you, King Jesus, we praise you this morning.
[time=674] Thank you for becoming sin in our place.
[time=679] Thank you for the sweet communion we have with you and your father and the Holy Spirit.
[time=686] We recognize that it's only through your blood and we say thank you.
[time=691] [AMEN] (gentle music)
[time=701] (gentle music)
[time=731] (gentle music) - We'd like to encourage you to think about
[time=744] looking up the number in the front of your phone book of your congressman and let them know what you believe marriage should be.
[time=753] It's not that we're now getting on a political stump here
[time=760] as a church, we don't do that very often.
[time=763] But we would like to encourage you if God lays it on your heart to communicate what's really true because what he says here's true.
[time=773] And if enough people in our country believe that that's true, the government is supposed to represent what the people in our country believe and you can encourage them to do that.
[time=787] Phone numbers are under government section in the phone book.
[time=791] You can find them there.
[time=793] U.S. congressman, U.S. senators.
[time=795] This morning I was sitting down here in the first pew
[time=802] and my friend Mark came from the back, came down and he was kind of dancing around this one because he, I think he thought he was gonna hurt my feelings.
[time=811] He said, man, I didn't know that was you up here.
[time=814] I was trying to figure out who that was because you know, you're going bald.
[time=817] And I said, going bald, thank you.
[time=823] I felt like, man, that's a real, he's telling me I'm growing some back or something.
[time=829] I've been like that for a long time.
[time=832] That's part of who I am.
[time=835] What I'm like physically, it's part of who I am.
[time=841] It's part of what I have to offer, God.
[time=846] And we really need to get excited about who he designed us to be individually.
[time=855] And offer back to him who he designed us to be, including our physical characteristics.
[time=864] Now there's some that he didn't design in us that we've kind of messed up.
[time=868] You know, we need to straighten those out.
[time=870] But what he designed in us, we need to offer back.
[time=876] I'm not here this morning to accuse or to charge you with anything.
[time=880] I hope the Holy Spirit does that in your heart today.
[time=884] But I don't have people in mind as I go through this passage of Scripture and Malachi that we're going to look at.
[time=890] We read an elders meeting and one of our elders read a minor prophet passage to us about bad sacrifices.
[time=900] And we listened to that and we thought, well, that's something we need to talk about in church.
[time=908] And so Kelly said that, and I said, I'd like to do that.
[time=913] I have the gift of confrontation, you know?
[time=915] And it's in there somewhere.
[time=918] It's in Romans or 1 Corinthians or somewhere.
[time=921] And this passage in Malachi is very confrontational.
[time=927] Malachi existed and wrote this between 450 and 430 BC.
[time=935] That's about 75 years after the temple had been rebuilt following the exile.
[time=942] And so offerings are being given up to the priests first and then the priests would offer the offerings to God.
[time=951] And people would bring in their lambs and they'd have a meat offering before God.
[time=960] And Malachi, as a spokesperson for God, was speaking to a people that a man named Craig blazing describes as this in the Bible knowledge commentary.
[time=971] He says the people were like this.
[time=973] The people's hope in God's covenant promises had been dimmed.
[time=980] As evidenced by there, listen to this,
[time=987] intermarriages with pagans marrying unbelievers, divorces and general moral ambivalence.
[time=999] 440 BC, 2004 AD, things don't change much.
[time=1010] That's who we are when we're not walking in Christ.
[time=1018] Ambivalence toward morality.
[time=1022] In Malachi, chapter one, Malachi, a spokesperson for God,
[time=1031] speaks these words.
[time=1035] In verse six, he says, "A son honors his father
[time=1041] and a servant, his master.
[time=1046] If I am a father, God says, where is the honor do me?
[time=1050] If I am a master, where is the respect do me?" Says the Lord almighty.
[time=1057] It is you, O priests, who show contempt for my name.
[time=1061] Hebrew word for honor can also be translated glory.
[time=1065] Where's the glory do me?
[time=1067] If I'm God, where is the glory that's do me?
[time=1072] If I'm God, respect can also be translated fear.
[time=1076] Where's the fear?
[time=1078] Do you come to me in fear and trembling because I'm other than you, I'm God, I'm perfect.
[time=1084] And then, you know, in those days, their relationship with God was directly dependent on their sacrificial system.
[time=1093] The covenant that God made with them was I will bless you and you will keep my commandments and you will abide by the sacrificial system that I put in place.
[time=1103] And they'd done that some of the time.
[time=1107] Most of the minor prophets, though, are clearly preaching to the people, the nation of Israel.
[time=1113] You aren't doing it the way God says you ought to be doing it.
[time=1116] And Malachi says, where is the respect?
[time=1121] Where is the honor that's do the Lord almighty?
[time=1126] I know something about that now.
[time=1133] I know more about that now than I did when my mom and dad were trying to tell me to honor and respect them.
[time=1141] I really didn't think that the choices I made
[time=1147] really reflected on them as much as I think the choices my kids make reflect on me.
[time=1156] I get it now.
[time=1158] I know why they were concerned about it.
[time=1164] And that's just a little bit like what we're talking about when we talk about bringing honor and respect to the Lord almighty.
[time=1173] My dad and mom, I think too many times,
[time=1179] they might have been concerned about how I looked, bringing honor and respect to them.
[time=1184] Maybe that was a little overdone, but I do understand something.
[time=1188] If they wanted me to look a certain way, then honoring and respecting them would have been looking that way.
[time=1195] Now God's a lot more interested in what's going on in my heart
[time=1202] than what I look like.
[time=1203] And I've tried over the years.
[time=1205] I mean, if you've ever seen art children, you can see that they look a lot different than I do.
[time=1209] The clothing and that kind of stuff, that's become less of an issue to me.
[time=1215] But what's going on in your heart?
[time=1216] Do you respect and honor him?
[time=1221] I understand that fear, respect word.
[time=1225] I had that with my dad and mom.
[time=1227] And honor, showing them paying them tribute by behaving properly.
[time=1232] I understand that now.
[time=1234] Dad, I think probably the time he felt most honored was a time that you probably wouldn't guess.
[time=1240] My brother and I, and my sisters, we got some accolades in school for this and that.
[time=1245] We did some things in church.
[time=1246] But I think the proudest my dad ever seemed was the day he came home from the steel foundry and said that those guys, his peers at the steel foundry, thought my brother and I were good workers, hard workers.
[time=1258] It really honored him that we worked hard.
[time=1263] It really showed respect to him when we worked hard.
[time=1268] And he felt proud and I think it was a healthy pride.
[time=1271] And sometimes I feel that now in our children.
[time=1280] It feels good.
[time=1281] And I want to respond to my God, the Lord almighty with offerings
[time=1291] that will show him the respect and honor that he's due.
[time=1297] Don't you?
[time=1298] That's what this is about today.
[time=1301] It's a warning Malachi is going to go on and he's going to warn the people, and I believe God through his Holy Spirit and his word will warn you today too.
[time=1312] And I don't have you in mind, like I said up front.
[time=1316] I really don't have individuals in mind.
[time=1318] You know what?
[time=1321] I spend so much time responding to this myself.
[time=1322] I can't think about you very much.
[time=1324] Verse six, B, it says.
[time=1330] But you ask how have we shown contempt for your name?
[time=1338] You place defiled food on my altar.
[time=1341] But you ask, how have we defiled you?
[time=1344] By saying that the Lord's table is contemptible.
[time=1349] When you bring blind animals for sacrifice, is that not wrong?
[time=1355] When you sacrifice crippled or diseased animals, is that not wrong?
[time=1362] God had said clearly that you should bring the first in your flock.
[time=1367] The best, the prime, and they were bringing blind, diseased,
[time=1376] and crippled animals, and the priests were offering them up as sacrifices.
[time=1381] Then I like this sentence.
[time=1384] It says, try offering them to your governor.
[time=1388] What would you offer today if President Bush,
[time=1394] how many of our people would be here today if President Bush were here instead of me?
[time=1400] Try offering those to your governor, he says.
[time=1408] They were still under Persian rule at that time.
[time=1412] There was a governor there, and they showed more honor and respect to the governor than they did the Lord Almighty when they brought their sacrifices to maintain relationship with him.
[time=1424] Yeah.
[time=1425] I don't want to beat this up too much,
[time=1435] but how would we look?
[time=1437] How clean would we be?
[time=1442] What would our attitudes be like?
[time=1453] Now, I worry about these.
[time=1454] It says, would he be pleased with you?
[time=1457] Would the governor be pleased?
[time=1458] Would he accept you?
[time=1459] Says the Lord Almighty?
[time=1460] Well, what might these offerings be today?
[time=1466] I just spent the last six weeks thinking about this and asking people.
[time=1471] What might these contemptible offerings be today?
[time=1475] If God, through the minor prophets, is warning me,
[time=1482] what might my contemptible offerings be today?
[time=1486] And so I have a few here.
[time=1488] I'm sure I haven't covered them all, but maybe these will kind of prick your conscience a little bit and cause you to think.
[time=1496] What might they be?
[time=1498] Well, a lot of people that I asked said, prayer might be a contemptible offering.
[time=1504] Jesus said that too.
[time=1508] Prayer might be a contemptible offering.
[time=1512] First of all, in all of these, it may be that they're contemptible because they're nonexistent.
[time=1519] Maybe you don't spend much time praying.
[time=1522] Where is it is, this very morning, my mind was racing on what I was gonna do today.
[time=1529] Now, it's not that I haven't been spending some time praying about this, but it was, I was up for 45 minutes.
[time=1536] And then I said, good morning, Lord.
[time=1538] And when I said, good morning, Lord, this morning, after being up for 45 minutes, I thought, he's been here all 45.
[time=1544] Why didn't you say it the first minute, you know what I mean?
[time=1546] He's been here, but I have a tendency to get focused on the things that I do in my prayer life, sometimes can be nonexistent or not begin when it should begin, not continue when it should continue.
[time=1558] Sometimes it's ritualistic, sometimes it's repetitious,
[time=1567] same words.
[time=1570] Sometimes it's public and it's wrong then.
[time=1575] Now, sometimes public prayer is very appropriate, my heart's ripe, sometimes I might be, I remember a lady one time told me at church, she said, I just love the way you pray.
[time=1584] This is years and years and years ago.
[time=1587] And it made me think, oh, maybe I'm a really good prayer.
[time=1590] And anything can puff you up and be a contemptible offering.
[time=1596] If it's conversation with God, it's genuine, it's from your heart to his and back.
[time=1603] Then it's really good, but it might be ritualistic.
[time=1609] Jesus said, Matthew six, five through eight, let's look at that together.
[time=1615] Matthew six says, and when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites for they love to pray, standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men.
[time=1624] I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full.
[time=1631] But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your father who is unseen.
[time=1636] Then your father who sees what is done in secret will reward you.
[time=1641] And when you pray, do not keep one babbling like pagans for they think they will be heard because of their many words.
[time=1649] Do not be like them for your father knows what you need before you ask him.
[time=1655] In an ongoing relationship with the father, in a never ending conversation with the father, when my heart's tuned in and I'm in communication with the father, he knows before I ask it, but I still need to ask it.
[time=1673] Prayer life can be a contemptible offering.
[time=1681] And you know what?
[time=1684] Nobody knows that.
[time=1685] Nobody can tell, just because you're praying public doesn't mean it's bad.
[time=1690] He goes on to say in Matthew 6, 9 through 13,
[time=1698] this is how you should pray.
[time=1700] Our father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
[time=1704] Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[time=1708] Give us today our daily bread.
[time=1711] Forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors and lead us not to temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.
[time=1719] Now, I thought, I know he doesn't want me
[time=1726] to say those same words over and over again, and that'd be all my prayer life.
[time=1730] So there must be something about those words, and I thought, well, when I looked at it, I thought it's about God, it's about his kingdom, and it's about our being dependent on him.
[time=1744] Our prayer life ought to recognize who he is, communicate to him who he is.
[time=1750] Our prayer life ought to recognize the fact that his kingdom has come.
[time=1756] Jesus said, the kingdom is now.
[time=1758] We're living in the kingdom.
[time=1762] And then thirdly, my prayers need to emphasize
[time=1769] my utter dependence on him.
[time=1774] Your kingdom come, your will be done.
[time=1776] Give me my daily bread.
[time=1778] Forgive me, please, as I forgive others.
[time=1780] I'm dependent on you.
[time=1781] You know, mealtime prayers, if those are your only prayers,
[time=1787] and you say the same words all the time, you're missing out on a great opportunity to have a communication with God, and it might be a contemptible offering.
[time=1796] Prayer.
[time=1803] That's one way that we might offer something to God that's contemptible.
[time=1806] Second thing I jotted down was,
[time=1812] our giving might be a contemptible offering.
[time=1815] It might be non-existent, like the prayer.
[time=1819] That would be contemptible.
[time=1821] That we're not giving anything financially back to building the kingdom.
[time=1827] It might be ritualistic.
[time=1830] It might be repetitious.
[time=1832] It might be public, just like prayer.
[time=1835] That might be contemptible to God.
[time=1836] Try to teach our children to turn the envelope over
[time=1842] when you put it in the plate.
[time=1843] That'll keep you a little humble.
[time=1845] It might be too little.
[time=1852] Second Corinthians chapter nine.
[time=1856] Paul's teaching the Corinthians about giving.
[time=1859] I love this passage.
[time=1861] 'Cause there's a tension in it that doesn't go away.
[time=1864] God didn't say 3%, 7%, 10%, 18%, 23%.
[time=1869] What he did in the Old Testament was, he taught him a lot about giving, and a lot of the giving add up, a lot of people think it's about 33% of their income that they gave.
[time=1878] But in the New Testament, because it's by grace that we're saved, and our relationship with him isn't dependent on our offerings, we don't know how much we're supposed to give.
[time=1890] And it gets pretty confusing sometimes.
[time=1892] Remember once in a while, I wish he'd just say 73% or whatever the number would be.
[time=1896] Make it a little easier than I wouldn't feel a heat.
[time=1898] Might be too little.
[time=1902] You know, second Corinthians nine says that we should be giving generously.
[time=1904] Remember this, whoever sows, this is about giving generously, sows sparingly, will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously.
[time=1914] God wants us to be generous in our giving.
[time=1918] That shows up in other places.
[time=1919] First Timothy chapter six, he says the same thing.
[time=1921] Command those who are richness present world, to give generously, be generous and willing to share what God's given them.
[time=1931] Might be too little.
[time=1935] If you feel conviction because it's too little, give more.
[time=1939] If you feel conviction because it's too little, look for the opportunities.
[time=1944] When you hear about a need, it doesn't need to be just what you put in the offering plate.
[time=1948] When you hear about a need, give toward it.
[time=1951] See if God relieves you of that tension that you feel that pressure that you're feeling.
[time=1956] Hopefully you're feeling it.
[time=1957] If the Holy Spirit's dwelling in you and you're not walking in his light, then you should be feeling that tension.
[time=1964] Maybe it's too little.
[time=1968] Maybe you need to give more generously.
[time=1970] Or maybe you're giving reluctantly or under compulsion
[time=1976] because that's what it says next.
[time=1978] Each man should give what he's decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion for God loves a cheerful giver.
[time=1986] Sometimes when I'm teaching on this like right now, I feel sometimes like I'm jabbing you, trying to get you to give more and so out of reluctance and compulsion, I'm pushing you toward giving more.
[time=2001] I don't wanna do that because God says we shouldn't give that way.
[time=2005] We should give generously and cheerfully.
[time=2008] You know what?
[time=2010] Sometimes you're not cheerful because you're not giving enough.
[time=2015] Nancy and I have a little deal that we do.
[time=2021] When something comes up and one of us wants to give to it, we're gonna give to it.
[time=2025] If either one of us wants to give to it, we're going to give.
[time=2028] Now how much?
[time=2029] I have a tendency to give more because I don't pay the bills.
[time=2035] She will have a tendency to be more conservative usually, but sometimes it really reverses and she wants to give more than I do.
[time=2040] But this is what we do.
[time=2041] We both put a number down, how much you wanna give, and then we bring 'em to the table and we give 'em the middle.
[time=2047] And you know what?
[time=2050] It becomes cheerful.
[time=2052] It's fun to give that way.
[time=2055] It can be that you feel pressured
[time=2061] and you're compelled to give when you don't want to, or you and your spouse haven't worked it out, get rid of that.
[time=2068] Give whatever you can give cheerfully.
[time=2071] If it's less, give less.
[time=2074] If it means more to bring cheer to giving, give more.
[time=2078] I've heard people talk about their offering to God, their financial offering,
[time=2089] and include things like school tuition in that.
[time=2094] 'Cause it's a Christian school.
[time=2096] And I've tried to be faithful to say, I don't think that's appropriate.
[time=2099] I don't even think, to be honest with ya, I don't think our building programs should be included in that, in my own heart, for me.
[time=2108] To be honest with ya, a lot of what I give in the plate is to pay for the electricity and the air conditioning and the comfort that I like in here.
[time=2116] Now I don't even really even see that as offering.
[time=2119] That's kinda my membership.
[time=2124] And I'm telling you about what goes on in my heart.
[time=2127] I love to give more to Black Hawks offering plates
[time=2135] and to other people who are doing ministry when I know that that money's being used to reach people for Christ and grow people in Christ.
[time=2143] And that, to me, is an offering to him.
[time=2146] Now he doesn't need my money to do that, but I need to participate in that.
[time=2155] The third area that I thought might be a contemptible offering that I wanted to warn you about because I felt warned about it was this area of obedience.
[time=2167] It might be that obedience is non-existent in your life.
[time=2174] That's a problem, that's contemptible.
[time=2178] It might be that your obedience is ritualistic, repetitious, and public.
[time=2185] And you're totally different somewhere else.
[time=2188] That's a problem.
[time=2189] That's a contemptible offering.
[time=2190] It might be that our obedience is to the letter of the law
[time=2197] rather than in response to a relationship
[time=2203] because I've been saved by the blood of Christ.
[time=2209] If I do the letter of the law, there are several passages that don't spell out the letters and they get real awkward.
[time=2220] And 1 Corinthians 8 and Romans 14 teaches about those.
[time=2226] Paul says now about disputable matters, let me tell you about those.
[time=2229] The only way you can deal with disputable matters, folks, that will call you to obedience is if you are walking in faith led by the spirit and being given wisdom from above so you can be discerning to know when to do it and when not to do it.
[time=2247] There are times in all of the disputable matters that I cannot do it.
[time=2251] You know the passages, I might cause a brother to sin if they think it's sin, but they do what I'm free to do.
[time=2259] There are times I cannot do it.
[time=2260] The other times I can do it.
[time=2262] Now if I'm looking for the letter of the law, I can never live in there.
[time=2266] It's totally.
[time=2267] The letter of the law is not obedience.
[time=2271] The letter of the law is obedience in the clearly stated observable laws of God, but there are lots of disputable matters in great areas where I've got to walk by faith and be willing to try to discern that.
[time=2285] And you know what?
[time=2286] Again, there's a tension there, it's like the giving thing, it doesn't go away.
[time=2290] I'd rather have the list, I'll never forget.
[time=2294] We were, Josh was in high school and when he and Steph were growing up, after about, I don't know, eighth grade or so you started choosing your own church involvement, I let them decide what stuff they were going to go to and what they weren't going to go to.
[time=2308] I was real worried that because we were in the Christian school and the church that their religion and their Christianity would be just mine and so I was letting them make choices.
[time=2317] And Josh would choose some things not to do.
[time=2320] For instance, we had see you at the poll out here, one day to pray around the flagpole and man, gobs the kids from the school came to that and they prayed and I'm looking all over and he's not there and later I said, "You didn't go to see you at the poll." And then he goes, "No, I didn't." I said, "Man, that really disappointed me." I said, "He just, he was mad." He goes, "Dad, you told me I could choose "to do the things that I said, yeah, it's okay.
[time=2348] "You can choose.
[time=2349] "I'm not gonna tell you to be at see you at the poll.
[time=2351] "I'm just gonna tell you, when I'm disappointed "that you don't go." And I can be honest and say I'm disappointed that you wouldn't choose to do that or you wouldn't choose to go to this or I'm gonna tell you the truth.
[time=2364] He said, "If you just make a list "and tell me the things that you want me to do "because he really wanted to please me "but he wanted to be easy." He didn't want it to cost him anything.
[time=2375] He wanted to be real easy.
[time=2377] God wants us.
[time=2381] He gives us freedom to make choices.
[time=2383] And we honor him and you know what?
[time=2385] Sometimes we honor him by not doing it and sometimes we honor him by doing the very same thing.
[time=2392] Hard, teaching.
[time=2395] But that is a pure offering.
[time=2398] Dependent on him, utterly dependent and in prayer with him and making choices based on how the Holy Spirit's moving you and in harmony with everything that's in the Word of God.
[time=2411] (congregation murmurs) My obedience can be really contemptible through disobedience or the way I do it where it can be a real sweet aroma to God.
[time=2424] In Mark 1230 he said, "The greatest commandment "is love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind, soul "and strength that's the greatest commandment." Loving him that way.
[time=2434] Through my obedience I can express my love.
[time=2440] Jesus said, "Oh, you want to express your love for me?
[time=2443] "Keep my commandments." First John's all about that.
[time=2450] First Corinthians eight and Romans 14 do not give me
[time=2458] license to do whatever I want to do.
[time=2460] But they tell me about the power available to me in the Holy Spirit, to make proper choices, discerning choices about when I'm going to mislead people and when I'll lead people correctly.
[time=2473] And I can love him that way.
[time=2478] I can offer myself to him that way.
[time=2480] So can you.
[time=2481] Fourthly, we could have some contemptible acts of service.
[time=2488] For instance, in Mark 1231 he said,
[time=2496] "The greatest, second greatest commandment is like the first "when he says to love your neighbor as yourself.
[time=2502] "There's no commandment greater than these." Love your neighbor.
[time=2506] Who's your neighbor?
[time=2507] When you're sitting by some of them right now, they're your neighbor this morning.
[time=2512] You've got some neighbors in your neighborhood.
[time=2515] You have some neighbors at work.
[time=2517] Contemptable offerings might be the person who choose, you know what, I'm about evangelism.
[time=2524] I'm gonna do all of my service outside the church.
[time=2527] Another person might say, I have the gift of teaching.
[time=2531] I'm gonna do all of my equipping inside the church.
[time=2536] I think God wants us to serve him, both in and outside the church.
[time=2542] I think a contemptible offering would be me defining
[time=2549] who it is that I'm gonna have relationship with allowing, rather than allowing God to bring people into my life, that I'm gonna have relationship with here and out there.
[time=2560] It might be nonexistent, you might not be serving at all.
[time=2566] If you're not serving inside and outside the church, start.
[time=2571] You can take network.
[time=2575] That's a course that we offer to help you discover what you're passionate about and how you can serve.
[time=2579] We'll help you find a place to serve.
[time=2581] Every single person ought to be serving inside the church and outside the church, both.
[time=2587] God has called us to reach the lost where the tools that he uses.
[time=2591] When we serve him outside, we build relationships with them.
[time=2595] Hopefully they'll say, why are you different?
[time=2597] Why do you have hope?
[time=2599] And we'll be prepared to give an answer.
[time=2601] First Peter three says, we need to be ready.
[time=2603] And hopefully we're serving in the church.
[time=2607] First Corinthians 12, Romans 12 says you have a spiritual gift, a gift to build up the body of Christ.
[time=2614] Not just the body in Black Hawk, but partly the body in Black Hawk, the body in Fort Wayne, the body in Indiana, the body around the world.
[time=2623] I wanna warn you, I really believe that it can be a contemptible offering if we narrowly define how we're going to serve and then get satisfied with that.
[time=2636] We need to be available when God brings opportunity into our life to serve him uniquely that way for that season.
[time=2645] I was thinking about who the examples are.
[time=2649] A lot of you came to my mind.
[time=2651] But Greg and Lee Deeson stand out to me as people who serve, they don't have time for much frivolity.
[time=2661] They are serving outside the church.
[time=2663] They have relationships going with people that don't go to church all the time.
[time=2668] For the years I've known them, you can ask them any time.
[time=2670] Who is it that you're relating to now that's not in the church?
[time=2673] They'll tell you the names.
[time=2674] They'll tell you the events they've been involved in together.
[time=2676] They'll tell you what they've done in their neighborhood with their friends.
[time=2680] And you know, they serve here in the church all the time building up the body.
[time=2684] I commend Greg and Lee.
[time=2687] Been great examples to me.
[time=2690] This makes me feel really guilty.
[time=2697] I read through Malachi and I look at how Jesus says we're supposed to pray and I see how we're supposed to obey and serve and give.
[time=2706] And at the end of that whole thing, I feel really guilty.
[time=2708] I've been feeling guilty for weeks here.
[time=2711] But that tug and pull that God has with me
[time=2717] is where I think he wants me for the rest of my life.
[time=2721] The tension that I feel, that I hope you're feeling today.
[time=2725] Not tension that my words, but if Malachi's words, if Jesus' words in Matthew have pricked your heart, the Bible says it is a living sword.
[time=2737] It's alive.
[time=2738] This thing can prick your heart.
[time=2739] It can divide your soul and your spirit.
[time=2742] It can help you discern and understand the thoughts and attitudes of your own heart.
[time=2748] It should bring conviction.
[time=2750] It's been convicting me.
[time=2753] Let's look at verses nine through 14.
[time=2755] Now implore God to be gracious to us.
[time=2761] That's what we oughta do.
[time=2763] Big God for grace.
[time=2765] And we know what they didn't even know.
[time=2768] Through the blood of Christ, he has been gracious.
[time=2772] With such offerings from your hands, will he accept you, says the Lord almighty?
[time=2780] Oh, that one of you would shut the temple doors.
[time=2784] Wow, get that again.
[time=2786] Now think about that again.
[time=2787] Malachi's saying, the place would be better off if you'd slam the door shut, rather than bringing these contemptible offerings that you've been bringing and satisfying yourself.
[time=2798] You haven't been satisfying God, but you've been satisfying yourself.
[time=2802] So shut the doors.
[time=2803] Have a good friend in my other Bible I wrote.
[time=2808] Don't sing the songs.
[time=2810] What a great way for us to participate with these people and all of us, praying to God in song.
[time=2816] That's what I consider that.
[time=2818] We're in communication with God.
[time=2819] We're praying to him.
[time=2821] We're praising him.
[time=2822] We're worshiping him.
[time=2824] And if we're doing that for our own sake, shut the doors.
[time=2829] If coming here on Sunday morning and us singing some songs and praying and listening to a message, satisfies your need to have fulfilled your Christian life, you've fulfilled your responsibility by showing up at church on a Sunday morning.
[time=2845] If that's what's going on around here, shut the doors.
[time=2847] We don't need to gather for that.
[time=2854] We're better off not gathering.
[time=2855] Now, if we're coming in here, bringing real offerings, bringing our heart, keep them open.
[time=2866] Oh, that one of you would shut the temple door so that you would not light useless fires on my altar.
[time=2875] Useless fires are fires that burn up contemptible offerings.
[time=2883] I'm not pleased with you, says the Lord almighty,
[time=2890] and I will accept no offering from your hands.
[time=2892] My name will be great among the nations from the rising to the setting of the sun.
[time=2897] In every place, incense and pure offerings will be brought to my name because my name will be great among the nations, says the Lord almighty.
[time=2906] There's a reality, no matter what we do, he is going to be God.
[time=2911] But, he says, you profane it by saying of the Lord's table,
[time=2920] it is defiled and of its food, it is contemptible.
[time=2923] And you say, what a burden, what a burden.
[time=2928] And you sniff at it contemptuously, says the Lord almighty.
[time=2931] When you bring injured, crippled or diseased animals and offer them as sacrifices, should I accept them from your hands, says the Lord, cursed is the cheat who has an acceptable male in his flock and vows to give it, but then sacrifices a blemished animal to the Lord.
[time=2952] For I am a great king, says the Lord almighty, and my name is to be feared among the nations.
[time=2959] Guilty, yeah.
[time=2963] Afraid, yeah, I am.
[time=2967] What should I do?
[time=2972] If that's convicting and it is, then what should I do?
[time=2981] Let's go back to a couple other Old Testament minor prophets.
[time=2984] Back to Joel.
[time=2985] In Joel chapter two, verse 12,
[time=2992] Joel says, even now declares the Lord, return to me with all your heart, with fasting and weeping and mourning.
[time=2999] Some of you need to return to the Lord with all your heart, with fasting and weeping and mourning.
[time=3005] You need to rend your heart, tear your heart into.
[time=3008] Let him break it, be contrite.
[time=3011] Rend your heart and not your garments.
[time=3014] They had a habit of tearing their garment in public.
[time=3018] Jews would, when something bad went wrong or when they were discovered and sinned, they would rip their garment.
[time=3023] And Joel says, rip your heart, not your garment in public.
[time=3027] Return to the Lord your God for he is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love.
[time=3035] And he relents from sending calamity.
[time=3037] Who knows?
[time=3039] He may turn and have pity and leave behind a blessing.
[time=3043] Grain offerings and drink offerings for the Lord your God.
[time=3046] Rend your heart.
[time=3047] You know what?
[time=3048] I know.
[time=3049] Joel had to say, who knows what's gonna happen?
[time=3052] I know what's gonna happen.
[time=3053] God's promises are clear.
[time=3055] Rend your heart, come to him with a broken heart
[time=3061] and the circumstances in your life may not change one bit, but you will.
[time=3068] And again in Micah, chapter six, Micah chapter six, verse one.
[time=3073] He says, listen to what the Lord says.
[time=3080] Stand up, plead your case before the mountains.
[time=3083] Let the hills hear what you have to say.
[time=3085] Hero mountains, the Lord's accusation.
[time=3088] Listen, you everlasting foundations of the earth.
[time=3091] For the Lord has a case against his people.
[time=3094] He is lodging a charge against Israel.
[time=3096] My people, what have I done to you?
[time=3098] How have I burdened you?
[time=3100] Answer me.
[time=3102] I brought you up out of Egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery.
[time=3105] I sent Moses to lead you and also Aaron and Miriam.
[time=3110] My people remember that Balak, king of Moab, counseled.
[time=3113] And what Balam, son of Bior, answered.
[time=3116] Remember your journey from Chatem to Gilgal that you may know the righteous acts of the Lord with what shall I come before the Lord.
[time=3126] And bow down before the exalted God.
[time=3128] Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves a year old, will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams?
[time=3136] Is that what I need to do?
[time=3137] Increase the numbers of my offerings?
[time=3140] No.
[time=3140] With 10,000 rivers of oil?
[time=3143] No.
[time=3144] Shall I offer my first born for my transgression?
[time=3148] Stephanie, you ready for that one?
[time=3150] The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul.
[time=3156] He has showed you, oh man, what is good?
[time=3159] And what does the Lord require of you to act justly and love mercy and walk humbly with a rent heart with your God?
[time=3169] That's what he wants from us.
[time=3176] Romans 12 says that we are living sacrifices,
[time=3185] holy and pleasing to God, which is our spiritual form of worship.
[time=3188] He doesn't want us to be conformed to the patterns of this world anymore.
[time=3191] Be transformed by renewing our mind.
[time=3194] Then we can be the living sacrifice that he's called us to be, not contemptible.
[time=3199] The living sacrifice that he's called us to be.
[time=3201] Well, how can you do that?
[time=3208] Yield to his spirit.
[time=3209] By his power, you can do that.
[time=3213] Corbin's going to come and play a song for us.
[time=3216] When he's finished, you're dismissed.
[time=3220] We won't be having prayer.
[time=3220] I won't stand up and say you're dismissed.
[time=3222] When the song's over, you're free to lead.
[time=3224] [MUSIC - 368 seconds]
