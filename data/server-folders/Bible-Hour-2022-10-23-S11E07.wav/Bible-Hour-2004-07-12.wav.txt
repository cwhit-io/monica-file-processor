[time=272] [MUSIC]
[time=284] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries, and it is great to be together again.
[time=291] We are, believe it or not, heading toward the end of July.
[time=295] Summer is quickly coming to an end, just about another four, five weeks to go.
[time=302] And then, you know, we'll start talking about school.
[time=304] But what a summer it's been.
[time=306] We have so enjoyed the opportunities that God continues to bring us here at Black Hawk.
[time=312] We just finished a couple of weeks ago what was a 10-week series entitled "For Better For Worse,
[time=319] God's Design for Marriage and Family." And what we saw take place, and some of the people that we met, some of the stories of God's work in the lives of husbands and wives and families,
[time=331] it was truly, as it always is, when you see God at work, it was truly remarkable.
[time=337] And we are so thankful for what He continues to do and are so very thankful for the chance to today begin a new series.
[time=345] You will see week one in what will be a six-week look at the Old Testament prophet whose name was Elijah.
[time=354] We will be studying the ups and the downs of Elijah's life in ministry.
[time=359] What an amazing man, a man who was willing to stand in the midst of a fading, declining, compromising culture.
[time=369] And be the man God called him to be. Speak the words that God called him to speak and stand behind it with a life of integrity and devotion to God.
[time=379] It's entitled "One Can Make a Difference." And our hope is that as you watch it today and in the weeks to come that you, whoever you are, whatever stage in life you're at,
[time=391] wherever it is, you are in your journey and walk with the Lord if you know Him. Our hope is that you would be reminded today that you can make a difference.
[time=400] You really can. You can make a difference in your family. You can make a difference in your workplace.
[time=406] You can make a difference in your neighborhood. You see you fully surrendered to the person of our Lord.
[time=414] Jesus Christ, you can. His power through you can make an amazing difference.
[time=420] And Elijah fully surrendered.
[time=423] Oh my goodness, he made a huge difference and we can't wait to just kind of jump into this study and unfold from the pages of Scripture what God did with him.
[time=433] So we hope you'll enjoy it.
[time=435] Hey, just a reminder to you, we have a ministry here at Blackhawk called Blackhawk to Go.
[time=440] That's right, Blackhawk to Go and we want to make it available to you who watch via the Bible hour.
[time=446] All the things that you hear, all the messages that take place here on Sunday mornings, all of its taped.
[time=452] And these are available to you through the Blackhawk to Go ministry.
[time=456] You can order your CDs. You can order your cassette tapes. You can order DVDs. You can order videos.
[time=462] Whatever might meet your need, individual sermons or an entire sermon series, all of its available to you at Blackhawk to Go.
[time=470] You can come by on a Sunday and actually place your order out in the foyer or you can visit our website at blackhawkministries.org
[time=479] and go to recent messages and there, make your selections.
[time=484] So our hope is that what we're teaching and what we're trying to communicate, we hope it can make a difference.
[time=490] Not only on Sunday morning here in this room, but also maybe during the week in your life as you listen to it in your car or at your home
[time=498] or as you watch it on your screen later, our hope is that it will encourage you.
[time=503] Help further equip you with the life-changing truth of God's Word.
[time=508] Hey, thank you for tuning in. Our hope is that today you'll be encouraged to open your heart and mind to what God might have for you.
[time=515] And we'll thank him in advance for what he'll do in your life.
[time=519] God bless. Have a great week.
[time=521] Regan, coming up.
[time=523] One of the things we'd like to do at Common Ground just about every Wednesday night is share a story
[time=529] because a story is a slice of life.
[time=532] And we're called to be the life of the gospel, not just words, but the power of the Spirit of Christ in us to reach other people
[time=542] and to share a story of her life with you today, a life of full surrender, is Regan Harder.
[time=548] Could you please welcome her?
[time=550] (Applause) You know, a lot of people ask us what's full surrender?
[time=558] Well, full surrender is all of life surrendered back to the one who's drawing me, who created me, and that's Jesus Christ.
[time=565] And every one of us in our life and our story of full surrender has a past, a present, and a future.
[time=571] And I've asked Regan to, at first here, share with us a little bit about her past.
[time=576] My husband and I, and our two boys, well, one boy, I guess, we moved up here to Fort Wayne from Indianapolis about a year and a half ago.
[time=586] We came through the Black Hawk Doors August 13th of last year, so we're coming up on a year.
[time=594] And I had, my husband had a psychiatrist.
[time=598] We had lots of problems in Indianapolis who suggested she start going to church.
[time=603] My mother-in-law had a stepdaughter who goes here and said that she attended Common Ground on Wednesday nights, and maybe we should try it.
[time=610] And we walked in, and there was a couple people in the lobby, and we had asked if there was a service here, and Laura Cox came up to us.
[time=620] And we said, "Is there a service here?" And she said, "Yeah, it's upstairs." And had she not been there, we never would have found it, and we probably just would have left.
[time=628] But she took us upstairs, and Mitch walked in, and he said that he had been prompted to not give a three-point sermon, and he needed to hear from everybody.
[time=641] And a bunch of people raise their hands telling tragic things that were going on their lives.
[time=646] And I kept nudging my husband, telling him, he said, "He's talking about you." And he goes, "I'm not singing anything." So he went on with the rest of the service, and we waited for Mitch about half an hour.
[time=659] He was talking to somebody, and he came out, and he said, "I hear you're new," and we said, "Yeah." And that night I fully surrendered my life, and it's been different ever since.
[time=670] We were walking out to the parking lot, and my husband said, "Do you feel any different?" I said, "Well, yeah, you know, you wouldn't believe it, but I do, and I have a piece, and I feel like a ton of weight has been lifted off my shoulders."
[time=682] And we had a lot of things still coming ahead of us, but I learned to turn all of that over to God, and my husband surrendered the next week.
[time=693] Isn't that awesome?
[time=695] [APPLAUSE]
[time=702] Well, too often, outside the Evangelical Church, we are perceived as salvation only being a part of our past, but it isn't.
[time=715] It's about our present.
[time=717] And why don't you talk a little bit now about presently what you're going through?
[time=722] My husband was an attorney in Indianapolis, and he got addicted to cocaine.
[time=731] He ended up acquiring three different counties where he had gotten numerous criminal charges.
[time=739] He was sentenced in February in Marion County, and he got a nine-year suspended sentence, and he got probation and community service for six years.
[time=750] And we were thankful that that happened, and Common Ground prayed for us, and God made it so that he was on probation for six years.
[time=759] He had a case in Hamilton County.
[time=761] He got a year probation and community service.
[time=765] In his last case, he was sentenced on June 1st in Huntington County, and it was one of the lightest of the charges that he had, and he was sentenced to a year to do six months.
[time=777] So currently, he is in the Wells County Jail.
[time=782] I called Laura Cox, and I told her what happened, and everybody was just shocked because we were kind of expecting probation, and she has been unbelievable.
[time=797] And she came over and brought us dinner, and she was there, I think, until 11 o'clock talking, and the next day, we had to move.
[time=806] My boys and I, we had to move, because we couldn't afford the house that we were in.
[time=810] And Laura called me, and she had been talking to somebody from church, and she said, "I have a house that's been empty for a year, and I'll rent it to her."
[time=820] And we went and looked at it, and it was small, and I kind of had to take it anyway.
[time=829] Reminding me of the first house Susan and I lived in when we were married, it was really pretty.
[time=834] Yeah, well, I wasn't really too happy about it, but Laura and a bunch of people from, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[time=844] Well, I mean, it was just a lot different, and we weren't used to living in that small of a house.
[time=849] So anyway, Laura and a bunch of people from church came over and we painted it, and they really turned it into a home for us, and it was, and we rented a lot of places.
[time=859] And they really turned it into a home for us, and all of the love and the work that was put into it, it's really wonderful, and it's so safe and secure to live there.
[time=869] And we have gotten so much love and support and encouragement and prayers from people at Common Ground and people that we don't even know.
[time=876] And it has been amazing to see the way God has been working through so many different people, and we're really thankful for our Black Hawk family, because I don't know what we would do without them.
[time=887] Hey, would you join me in praying for Regan?
[time=893] God, I just thank you for this story, for this life and the life of Troy, fully surrendered to you, past since, present, future.
[time=910] God, I just pray that the body of Common Ground, the body of Black Hawk, would continue to be the body of Christ in their lives, for a little Elijah and a little Caleb, and that you continue to lead them in their life of full surrender.
[time=927] In Jesus' name, amen. But we're going to sing a song, Hallelujah, what a Savior. And each person in this room right now has a story.
[time=941] And your story has a past, and Jesus not only saves us from the penalty of our past sin, he saves us, and each one of us has this, it's all we can live in, the present.
[time=955] Jesus saves us from the power of sin in our lives.
[time=960] And then one day, as the song says in the future, he'll save us on the other side from the presence of sin.
[time=968] You see, Jesus Christ is a Savior who is alive.
[time=974] And 10,000 miles from here, you'll hear him say it again and again, there is an empty tomb that proves that he is who he says he is, and he's here right now.
[time=984] And he's living his life as a Savior through those who have fully surrendered to him.
[time=989] So here's what I want to ask you to do.
[time=991] As you sing the song, Hallelujah, what a Savior.
[time=995] I'd like you to just surrender to him right now what you're holding back.
[time=1000] It might be an addiction, it might be just subtle religious pride.
[time=1009] It might be a fight with the spouse, it might be a bad relationship, it might be something that's sexually impure.
[time=1017] Whatever that is, I offer you right now, just like Regan, just like Troy, just like me, fully surrender that.
[time=1024] Hallelujah, what a Savior.
[time=1028] Well, we come this morning to a new study, about a six-week study, it looks like, on the Old Testament prophet Elijah, Elijah.
[time=1039] And I love the story of Elijah.
[time=1041] You can turn in your Bibles back to 1 Kings.
[time=1043] We'll get there in just a moment.
[time=1045] 1 Kings chapter 16 is where we'll begin.
[time=1048] But I am really looking forward to, have really enjoyed in the last few weeks preparing for this study of the prophet Elijah.
[time=1057] And there's some reasons why I'm so looking forward to it.
[time=1060] There's some reasons why I've so enjoyed the study already.
[time=1063] There's some things about Elijah that I think many of you in the room can identify with, I know I can.
[time=1069] One of them is this, and I love this about him.
[time=1072] There are some things about Elijah.
[time=1074] There are some choices that Elijah made.
[time=1076] There are some things that Elijah did.
[time=1078] There are some situations where he handled himself, where he responded to God in a really stellar way, where he really came through.
[time=1091] He did the right thing.
[time=1093] And with real courage and with real boldness, he was willing to stand in a difficult situation here or there and be the individual that God had called him to be.
[time=1104] And I know that many of you in the room, no matter what the scene may have been, there are many in the room that you can identify with what it's like to have made the good choice, to have done the right thing, to have responded to God obediently.
[time=1120] It's a great place to be.
[time=1121] It's a wonderful experience.
[time=1125] But you see, Elijah was also a guy who made some bad decisions.
[time=1131] Elijah, as you will see, was a prophet who loved God deeply, but there were just some times.
[time=1136] There were some scenarios where he just didn't respond the way he should have.
[time=1144] And see, I know what that's like.
[time=1148] And I think there's a lot of people in this room who know what that's like as well.
[time=1153] All of us, probably to some degree, can look back on stellar times in our life and walk with him where he was really good to us.
[time=1163] And we responded appropriately and we can also look back at decisions that were made in seasons of life where it just wasn't real stellar.
[time=1173] And we see all of that and more in the pages of Scripture as we look at this prophet named Elijah.
[time=1182] And you know, there's one other thing I want to say about him, but I think so very important.
[time=1186] It really is the theme of our study.
[time=1188] I would love for you to write this down.
[time=1190] I would love for this to kind of be a beginning statement to this look that we'll take together.
[time=1196] One of the other things I really, really appreciate about Elijah is this people.
[time=1201] He was one man.
[time=1208] He's just one man.
[time=1212] He was one man in the midst of and in the face of an entire nation.
[time=1219] He was one man in the face of great evil and compromise.
[time=1224] He was one individual who in situations that will absolutely boggle your mind was willing to do what God called him to do.
[time=1237] And you see, I'm looking out at a room this morning full of one man, one woman, one student, one grandma, one grandma.
[time=1250] You know, this room is full of individuals and God has placed every one of you.
[time=1256] Don't miss this.
[time=1257] God has placed every one of us in our own world, in our own sphere of influence, in our own sphere of relationship.
[time=1266] God has placed every one of us in the perfect place that he wants you and I to be.
[time=1271] And he gives you and I individually the opportunity and privilege to make a difference.
[time=1277] And we see in Elijah one man who was bold enough and brave enough and courageous enough to stand.
[time=1288] And he made a difference. And you, my friend, whoever you are, whatever season of life you're in, whether it's a high school hallway,
[time=1298] whether it's a marketplace situation, whether it's just your home, he calls you and I to make a difference.
[time=1306] And we'll see as this study unfolds, we'll see in the life of this man, in the good times and the bad,
[time=1313] how in his commitment and devotion to the one true God, God allowed him and he will allow you and I to make a difference.
[time=1322] Well, some introductory thoughts for it before we jump into the text.
[time=1325] In the Old Testament, as we make our way to the study of Elijah, we see that following Solomon's glorious reign,
[time=1332] the kingdom of Israel split and fell into utter decay and confusion.
[time=1337] You see, king after king after king had led God's people further and further away from Jehovah,
[time=1344] the God who had delivered them, the God they once followed and worshiped.
[time=1350] See, the nation of Israel wanted a king. Remember that?
[time=1353] For so long, God had tried to keep them simply to himself.
[time=1357] God had tried to communicate in so many different ways that he was their king and that he was who they could follow.
[time=1365] But no, they wanted the other nations had kings.
[time=1369] The other nations had guides with big castles until we won a king, they said.
[time=1375] And they whined about it and they complained about it enough so God finally said, "Fine, have a king." And he gave them a few and king after king after king led them further and further away from what was true and right and good.
[time=1390] Some 58 years later, the nation of Israel, remember now, just quick history for you, quick update for you.
[time=1398] The nation of Israel, God's chosen people, God's chosen nation.
[time=1405] It was the nation and community of people that God had said would be his people to make a difference in the face of all these other nations,
[time=1414] all these other people. You see, his nation, the people of Israel, his plan was that they would live a distinct life,
[time=1423] that they would lead a devoted life to him, that they're allegiance and love for God and their willingness to honor what was right and true and good
[time=1431] would be so in contrast to the outlying nations that they couldn't help but look and say, "Oh my goodness, these people must be real.
[time=1442] This God of theirs must be the one true God." And so that was his intent but again and again and again and again.
[time=1452] They fall to compromise and sin and rebellion and watch this some 58 years later now.
[time=1459] The nation of Israel is unrecognizable, so compromised, so sinful, so disobedient and so distant from the Lord.
[time=1471] And as we come to the story of Elijah, Ahab, A-H-A-B, Ahab has become king and has married a foreign princess who has a hatred of God
[time=1483] and a violent and evil passion to make Baal, to make Baal worship, not Jehovah God worship, no, Baal, this Canaanite religion that had prospered over the years,
[time=1497] she comes and she chooses to make Baal worship the national religion.
[time=1502] God's priests have been killed, false temples erected and defiant altars and temple prostitution now abound.
[time=1510] The moral, spiritual and personal climate is growing darker and darker and darker.
[time=1517] And you know what God's people needed?
[time=1521] God's people needed a reminder.
[time=1526] You ever need a reminder?
[time=1530] You ever need a reminder in your life?
[time=1532] You ever need God to come along or God through someone else to come along and kind of wave a flag in your face?
[time=1540] You ever need a wake-up call?
[time=1543] God's people here in this day at this time needed a reminder.
[time=1550] I get them all the time. I tell you lately, many of you know that we had the privilege and I used the word purposely.
[time=1557] It was a privilege. It was a real joy to have my dad visiting with us over the Father's Day weekend.
[time=1565] And most of you know because I've shared with most of you the story of my dad.
[time=1570] And my mom and our family's breakup and all that transpired and all that transpired as most of you know led to a lot of years.
[time=1578] Separation and heartache and attitude on my part and his.
[time=1585] It's been very, very, very difficult. We've been through a great deal.
[time=1589] But by God's grace and with God's help over the last five, six years or so things have been by and large restored.
[time=1597] We actually talk on the phone once, twice, three times a month.
[time=1601] We keep up with each other and I genuinely enjoy and appreciate what that renewed relationship has brought.
[time=1608] I'm very thankful for the reception you all gave him, the way you made him feel at home and the kindness that you extended.
[time=1615] Somebody asked me a few days after he left how it went.
[time=1620] And you know it was somebody that I could shoot straight with.
[time=1625] You know sometimes you don't want to just shoot straight and say it all to everybody who asks but I could say it all to this friend.
[time=1633] And I was just able to tell him that it went okay.
[time=1640] That it was okay.
[time=1642] That I really enjoyed getting to be with him and look forward to being with him again in the future.
[time=1649] That I was really thankful for the fact that my kids now have an opportunity to get to know him.
[time=1655] And there's a lot of good things to get to know and enjoy and they are.
[time=1660] But I was just able to share with him that one of the hardest things was just sometimes when we'd be driving someplace
[time=1667] or sometimes late at night sitting around the table, there just didn't seem to be a whole lot to talk about.
[time=1675] Because we just don't talk about certain things.
[time=1679] Because that's how that is.
[time=1683] The relationships somewhat restored but you know some things, at least for us right now, some things you just don't get back.
[time=1694] And he's made it clear and again I can respect and appreciate that but I really like to talk as most of you know.
[time=1703] And there would be so many things I would love to discuss but we just don't discuss them.
[time=1709] And I think about my kids and how much I enjoy talking with my kids and even as they get older how much I appreciate the opportunities
[time=1716] to hear what's going on in their hearts and to share with them honestly from the depths of my life.
[time=1722] And it was just for me that week it was just a great reminder of what happens.
[time=1729] When you leave your family, when you make decisions, yes God is a God of grace and yes God is a God of forgiveness
[time=1737] and yes even those relationships can be restored but you know some things are just never the same.
[time=1744] And it was a great reminder to me.
[time=1751] And maybe there are things that you come across, maybe there are situations he brings to your life that remind you
[time=1758] of what is right and true and good.
[time=1760] Sometimes I need one, sometimes you may need one and you know what?
[time=1763] When you look back at the unfolding story of biblical history you realize it's always been that way.
[time=1769] It always has. There have always been times when the people of God have wandered from the truth of God
[time=1775] and in doing so have needed a reminder from God oftentimes from the mouth of a man of God.
[time=1782] A man willing to stand in the midst of an increasing compromise and godlessness and say to a people what are you doing?
[time=1792] Hey wait a minute, time out where are you going?
[time=1796] A man or a woman willing to in whatever situation it might be to stand in with courage and boldness and love for God
[time=1804] and love for them and say whoa, don't do that, come back, stop.
[time=1815] Have you forgotten who he is?
[time=1818] Have you forgotten what he's done?
[time=1820] Have you forgotten what it is he's called you to?
[time=1826] And we come in our study here of Elijah to a man who was willing to do that very thing.
[time=1832] And what a situation it was that God brought him to.
[time=1837] Would you read it with me?
[time=1838] Would you stand in honor of God's word and could we read together?
[time=1841] 1 Kings 16, we're going to start at verse 29 and we're going to go to verse 6.
[time=1848] We're going to go to verse 6 of chapter 17.
[time=1853] It says in 1 Kings 16, verse 29, now Ahab the son of Omri became king over Israel.
[time=1861] In the 38th year of Asa king of Judah and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel and Samaria for 22 years.
[time=1870] Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the Lord more than all who were before him.
[time=1877] You know you can stop right there just for a moment, let me read to you from verse 25, just a few lines back.
[time=1883] Omri, listen to this.
[time=1886] Omri did evil in the sight of the Lord and acted more wickedly than all who were before him.
[time=1892] Ahab now son of Omri, verse 30, did evil in the sight of the Lord more than all who were before him.
[time=1899] It's getting worse.
[time=1902] And it came about as though it had been a trivial thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nabat.
[time=1909] Jeroboam had done unbelievably wicked and evil things in the sight of God.
[time=1914] And as if that had been trivial, the scripture says Ahab does the same.
[time=1921] He marries Jezebel, the daughter of Ephbael, king of the Sedonians, and went to serve Baal and worshiped him.
[time=1928] So he erected an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he built in Samaria.
[time=1934] Ahab also made the Asherah, and we'll come back to that in just a moment.
[time=1939] Ahab also made the Asherah.
[time=1943] Thus Ahab did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel and all the kings of Israel who were before him.
[time=1948] In his days he held the Bethelite, built Jericho.
[time=1953] He laid its foundations with the loss of Abraham, his firstborn, and set up its gates with the loss of his youngest son, Segub.
[time=1961] According to the word of the Lord, which he spoke by Joshua, which was spoke by Joshua the son of none,
[time=1968] just note there briefly he rebuilt Jericho.
[time=1972] Let me just ask you to make sure we're on the same page.
[time=1975] Why did Jericho need rebuilding?
[time=1977] Who had destroyed Jericho?
[time=1981] The Lord God had destroyed Jericho.
[time=1984] The Lord God had brought judgment on Jericho.
[time=1987] Jericho was destroyed because God wanted it destroyed.
[time=1992] But Ahab's going to rebuild it.
[time=1997] Chapter 17 verse 1, now Elijah, the Tishbite, who was of the settlers of Gilead, said to Ahab.
[time=2005] Now here's Elijah, in the presence of Ahab, and he says to Ahab, "As the Lord the God of Israel lives,
[time=2013] before whom I stand, surely there shall be neither do nor reign these years except by my word."
[time=2023] And the word of the Lord came to him saying, "Go away from here and turn eastward and hide yourself by the brook shareth,
[time=2029] which is east of the Jordan, it shall be that you will drink of the brook, and I have commanded the ravens to provide for you there."
[time=2036] So he went and did according to the word of the Lord, for he went and lived by the brook shareth, which is east of the Jordan, and the ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning, and bread and meat in the evening, and he would drink from the brook.
[time=2051] I'll stop you right there, and let me just say this one thing to you, and then we'll pray and move on.
[time=2057] Anybody know what the God of Baal was the God of?
[time=2063] This is so interesting.
[time=2065] See, God, and sometimes I laugh, it's not like it's really funny, but sometimes I look at how God orchestrates things,
[time=2073] and I just can't help but say, "Wow, what a God, what a mind." He sends Elijah to say to Ahab that until I give the word, it's not going to what?
[time=2084] I mean, you're not even going to get any due.
[time=2088] No rain, and I represent the true God of Israel.
[time=2094] And you're over here trying to represent this guy, this thing called Baal.
[time=2097] You know what Baal was the God of?
[time=2101] Rain.
[time=2105] This God that they had thrown all their marbles in with.
[time=2108] This God that they were following and worshiping away from God, this Baal, this Canaanite deity was, among other things, the God of Rain.
[time=2121] And so the stage is set, and the battle rages, and we get this incredible story of the one true God and Baal, the God of Rain.
[time=2133] And with me, Father, we stand before you in awe of so many things, so thankful again for the salvation that you bring, so thankful for your word, and this look that we get into the real life story of a prophet, a man who was willing to stand and speak, Elijah.
[time=2155] And God, we pray that as we look at His story, and then as we look at the unfolding story of this day, at this time, here in First Kings, God that you would teach us, that you would remind us, God that you would grow us, that you would show us new things,
[time=2171] that you would remind us of old truths that may be in some way we've wandered from, but God that we would be changed because of our look here into your word, and we ask it in your son's name.
[time=2182] Amen. You can be seated. So literally out of nowhere, a man appears with unbelievable boldness and a clear, uncompromising message from God, Elijah, the prophet, and he comes in the midst of a people that were spiritually fading.
[time=2200] Does any of this sound familiar to you? He comes to a culture that was spiritually fading and completely immersed in the prevailing culture of that day.
[time=2211] Elijah stands to proclaim that Jehovah God, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob was the one true God.
[time=2220] The one true God deserving of and demanding, in fact, their allegiance and their devotion and their worship.
[time=2228] So I want to go back to the passage and do what we always do with the Old Testament narratives, and that is learn from and see into the historical picture.
[time=2237] There's lots to see. There's lots to learn. There are things that we can glean from what took place right there, but we will also, as well as seeing into the historical picture, kind of bring that truth into the reality of your day, your life and mind, and make hopefully some practical application as well.
[time=2256] So number one, write this down. We're just going to jump in. You can write this down as your first point, our first stop along the way through this passage.
[time=2264] Write it down. Unchecked ungodliness just gets worse. Unchecked ungodliness just gets worse.
[time=2279] I want to read to you the first few verses that I just read to you a few minutes ago, and I'm going to read it to you this time from the translation called The Message by Eugene Peterson, a very helpful, very insightful translation of the Scriptures.
[time=2295] It is a translation that allows you and I with some contextual consistency and clarity to kind of hear the same words, kind of in the vernacular of our day, if that makes sense.
[time=2306] I want to read to you. I want you to have kind of a better, fuller picture of what this situation, what this climate was like.
[time=2316] Where was it that Elijah walked in? What was it that he was facing? What was going on with Ahab? I mean, what did it really look like?
[time=2326] How bad had it gotten? Eugene Peterson gives us some insight. Look with me at 1 Kings 16, 29 through the end of the chapter.
[time=2336] It says, Ahab, son of Omri, became king of Israel in the 38th year of Asa king of Judah. Ahab, son of Omri was king over Israel for 22 years.
[time=2346] He ruled from Samaria. Ahab, son of Omri, did even more open evil before God than anyone yet.
[time=2354] He was a new champion in evil. He took evil to a new plane. You see, it wasn't enough. He goes on. It wasn't enough for him to copy the sins of Jeroboam, son of Nabat.
[time=2367] No, he went all out, first by marrying Jezebel, daughter of Ethbio, king of the Sedonians, and then by serving and worshiping the God Baal.
[time=2380] He built a temple for Baal in Samaria and then furnished it with an altar for Baal.
[time=2387] People, do you realize, most of you I think, do you realize what a big deal the temple of God was?
[time=2395] Do you realize how important that was to God? Do you realize how sacred and holy and instrumental the temple of God was for his people in that day?
[time=2405] He went to great lengths to guard its building and direct its culmination. I mean, the temple was huge.
[time=2415] It's where he met with his people. Do you realize how many times God said don't marry somebody from another nation?
[time=2427] And yet here we see Ahab. He's just moving down this road. He marries Jezebel. He builds another temple.
[time=2436] Worse, he went on and built a shrine to the sacred whore, Ashera. Here you begin to get some insight into Ashera.
[time=2447] Not only her background and what the goddess Ashera was about, she was about prostitution, she was about immorality, she was about deviant, deviant, dark stuff.
[time=2460] And what we see brought into the scene are Ashera poles, and we'll delve into that a little bit, not much, but a little bit later.
[time=2471] But he even goes there. He builds a shrine to Ashera where all kinds of just sick stuff would take place in this new temple.
[time=2481] He made the God of Israel angrier than all the previous kings of Israel put together.
[time=2488] And it was under Ahab's rule that Heil of Bethel re-fortified Jericho, but at a terrible cost, he ritually sacrificed his firstborn son, Abraham, at the laying of the foundation, and his youngest son, Segub, at the setting of the gates.
[time=2509] This is exactly what Joshua's son of none said would happen.
[time=2518] So now, now we're killing kids on the altars of the false gods.
[time=2528] And I'm really, really wanting everybody in this room to understand the progression of this thing, that unchecked ungodliness just keeps going.
[time=2543] Now, you're sitting here going, "No, wait a minute, Kelly, are you actually sitting here saying that you're worried that somebody in this room might ritually sacrifice their boy?"
[time=2557] Literally? No, not really. Figuratively?
[time=2567] Oh, yeah, it's happening. It's happening all the time.
[time=2573] See, all the time it's going on. Kids are getting sacrificed on altars. It's not a real altar.
[time=2582] Oh, but it's an altar that you and I are capable of building.
[time=2589] It's a pursuit in life that you and I are capable of pursuing.
[time=2594] It is a goal. It is an objective. It is very, very possible for you in this room this morning that you're alive progressively would if unchecked get to a point where you know what?
[time=2606] You're sacrificing everything you've got for whatever it is you think you're going to get on the other side of that line.
[time=2617] So, yeah, I'm really concerned about you. I'm really concerned about me.
[time=2623] And we need to understand the progression. Watch this. Note the progression. He married an unbeliever. Can we just stop right there?
[time=2632] He married an unbeliever.
[time=2637] This was the beginning.
[time=2640] After marrying an unbeliever, he added not only another altar, but another whole temple and gradually destroys the old altars to Jehovah.
[time=2650] Then he brings in ashara poles.
[time=2654] These kinds of poles have made a comeback lately in certain segments of our society.
[time=2661] And what goes on today at these poles is the same thing that was going on back then.
[time=2669] And he brings that and that activity into the temple and moves his people toward forms of worship that included illicit, unbelievably immoral acts.
[time=2683] And if that weren't enough, then we see it progressed down to Haile, who murders his own sons, literally, on the altars sacrificing them to bail at the rebuilding of Jericho.
[time=2695] Make no mistake, people, they lived in and so do we see it's not a whole lot different.
[time=2701] Sometimes we think it's gotten so much worse today, right? It's not a whole lot different.
[time=2705] They lived in and we live in, make no mistake, an incredibly evil world.
[time=2714] Have you had any opportunity to kind of preview the upcoming fall TV schedule?
[time=2724] Anybody? Anybody here about ABC's new show, "Wife Swapping"? No? Yeah, it's coming.
[time=2734] Heard about the new show, "Desperate Housewives" where all kinds of, I mean, you know, I'm not even going to get into it all.
[time=2741] Read the paper, watch TV for 15 minutes, see what's coming, see what new lines are going to be crossed, see what it is that's going to be shown.
[time=2753] I was talking to a good friend this week, he has a 13-year-old daughter.
[time=2757] I was thinking back to when I was 13. When I was 13, I realized I came from a certain segment of people, okay, so I realized that when you were 13, it might have been a lot different than from me when I was 13.
[time=2767] When I was 13, when I was 13, we were thinking about cigarettes. We were wondering if cigarettes might be something we might want to sneak out to.
[time=2775] We were thinking about coming in late. When I was 13, I mean, that was really pushing the envelope.
[time=2782] My good friend tells me that they've had to, with their 13-year-old daughter, just kind of try a whole new approach.
[time=2789] She's involved in some travel teams. She plays volleyball and basketball and they've just decided, you know what, we're just going to go with her.
[time=2795] Every once in a while, they would have sent her on a weekend trip with the team and their parents by herself, now no longer are they doing that.
[time=2803] And in fact, just two weeks ago, on their way back from a trip, the young gal says from the backseat, Dad Mom, thank you so much for coming with me.
[time=2812] They said, "Sure, sweetie. Happy to do it." She says, "Well, yeah, I know, but if you hadn't, well then the girl that I would have stayed with."
[time=2822] You see her and all the other girls were up till 4 watching grown-up movies in the hotel, 13-year-olds till 4 in the morning.
[time=2839] You know, and it hits him and it hits me again like a ton of bricks, that it's a really, really, really dark world.
[time=2848] And here's the point, I can stand here and say to you, "Hey folks, it's really, really dark and it's getting really, really darker and you can nod your heads and go, "Wow, that's true," but you know what?
[time=2858] We need a voice.
[time=2862] Your voice.
[time=2864] My voice.
[time=2866] See, a voice is needed in your children's life.
[time=2870] A voice of direction, a voice of truth, a voice of loving relationship that steers and loves and guides.
[time=2877] See, there's a voice, a voice, one man, you, one woman, you, one individual, me, willing to stand in the midst of unchecked ungodliness that's just going to get worse.
[time=2891] And God says to Elijah, "Go, and you stand there and you look that guy in the eye and you say, "No, no, no, no, this is going to stop."
[time=2904] Unchecked, ungodliness just gets worse.
[time=2907] How's it going with you?
[time=2913] Would you be willing today, as Mitch encouraged you earlier, to check it?
[time=2919] Whatever little thing might be there, whatever little act of disobedience, whatever attitude might be present, whatever illicit thought might be there, whatever it is in your life.
[time=2931] And you know, and today it might just be this.
[time=2936] But you see, left unchecked, whatever this is, I promise you, next week it'll be this.
[time=2945] And the following week this, and see then about a year from now you wake up and you go, "Oh my goodness, how did I get here?"
[time=2955] And so whatever it might be, would you be willing to agree with God that left unchecked, it's going to get worse, so don't let it get worse, get on your knees.
[time=2965] Go to a friend, sit with your spouse.
[time=2968] I mean, wherever you have to go and say, "You know what, this isn't right, and I want to make it right because I don't want to give the enemy a foothold."
[time=2978] Identify the drift, confess the sin, ask for help, take action, cling to what is good, if not the progression is inevitable and it will get worse.
[time=2992] Ahab, Jezebel, and Hiel, and his two dead sons are a strong, vivid, biblical example of that very thing.
[time=3005] Secondly, write this down.
[time=3008] Bad company does corrupt good intentions.
[time=3016] And all you 15 overs, don't quit writing, don't sit there and think, "Okay, this is the one the kids need to hear." No, everybody write it down.
[time=3023] Because it's always true.
[time=3026] Bad company does corrupt good intentions.
[time=3030] Let me ask you a question.
[time=3032] Should you be kind to those far from God?
[time=3040] It's not rhetorical, I'm asking you.
[time=3043] Thank you.
[time=3044] Should you be gracious to those who are far from God?
[time=3048] Yeah.
[time=3049] Should you pray for them?
[time=3050] Yeah.
[time=3051] Should you be willing to invite them to church?
[time=3053] Should you befriend them?
[time=3055] Should you be willing to come alongside them and serve them in some way to help them?
[time=3059] Yes or no?
[time=3063] Should you partner with them?
[time=3071] Should you be joined with them?
[time=3077] Should you share your trust with them?
[time=3086] Should you give yourself to them financially?
[time=3096] Should you partner with them?
[time=3101] 2 Corinthians 4, just turn there if you would.
[time=3107] As you read 2 Corinthians 4, 2 Corinthians 6, verses 14 through 18, you'll think that Paul
[time=3116] maybe had in mind the very passage, the very situation, the very circumstance we've been
[time=3122] reading from in 1 Kings.
[time=3124] Look what Paul says to the church at Corinth in 2 Corinthians 6.
[time=3129] It says in verse 14, he says, "Do not be bound together, unequally yoked."
[time=3137] Is what it says in the older translations, "Do not be bound together with unbelievers."
[time=3144] For what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness?
[time=3148] Or what fellowship has light with darkness?
[time=3151] Or what harmony has Christ with Beel?
[time=3154] A rendition of the very God we've been studying back here, this Canaanite thing called Beel.
[time=3159] Same thing here.
[time=3160] What harmony has Christ with Beel?
[time=3163] Or what has a believer in common with an unbeliever?
[time=3166] Or what agreement has the temple of God with idols?
[time=3171] For we are the temple of the living God.
[time=3174] Just as God said, "I will dwell in them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people, therefore come out from their midst." Right?
[time=3185] Careful here now.
[time=3186] As far as being joined, as far as being partnered, as far as giving your heart, as far as giving
[time=3193] your trust, as far as giving your body, come out, he says, from them.
[time=3199] And be separate.
[time=3200] Doesn't say don't be gracious to them.
[time=3202] Doesn't say don't invite them to church.
[time=3204] Doesn't say don't serve them if they have a need.
[time=3206] But we're talking about a partnership.
[time=3211] "And do not touch what is unclean, and I will welcome you, and I will be a father to you, and you shall be sons and daughters to me," says the Lord Almighty.
[time=3224] God told the Israelite men, "Do not marry someone from another nation."
[time=3232] The Israelite men again, and again, and again, when in married, women from other nations who didn't know God, who didn't love God, who didn't share the belief.
[time=3241] And it was absolutely again, and again, and again, Jezebel and Ahab included catastrophic.
[time=3248] And you know what, people?
[time=3250] On this one, and you know what, I rarely do I stand here in front of you and kind of play
[time=3256] the paternal, you know, "Let me tell you like it is" role, but I'm going to tell you like it is today.
[time=3264] Because you can come and sit with me in my office if you'd like, and you can see it with
[time=3270] your own eyes.
[time=3272] It doesn't work.
[time=3275] Single men, single women in this room that don't, don't get married.
[time=3283] Don't get married if it means, if it means compromising on this one, I am begging you.
[time=3292] Stand alone with God for a time and let Him help you figure that out, but do not compromise
[time=3298] this one.
[time=3301] Don't join yourself.
[time=3303] Don't give your heart.
[time=3304] Don't partner your life with someone who doesn't love Him deeply.
[time=3312] It is absolutely again, and again, and again catastrophic.
[time=3319] It doesn't work.
[time=3323] Ninety-nine point five percent of the time.
[time=3326] Are there some success stories?
[time=3329] There are.
[time=3330] Are there some gals who got married to a guy who didn't know God and threw her?
[time=3336] There's a few success stories now and then.
[time=3339] I am begging you, don't roll those dice.
[time=3346] Businessmen and women, I'm begging you, don't part, don't put everything on the line.
[time=3356] Don't partner in such a way as to put it all on the line with someone who doesn't have
[time=3362] a like-minded love for respect and willingness to follow God that you do.
[time=3368] High school students, 16, 17, 14, 18, you know, students in this place, you know, I'm just
[time=3376] going to tell you, don't do it.
[time=3378] Should you be kind to them?
[time=3380] Absolutely.
[time=3381] Should you be willing to be used of God to point them toward Christ?
[time=3385] Absolutely.
[time=3386] But do not partner.
[time=3387] Do not give your heart.
[time=3389] Do not give your time and your energy and your commitment.
[time=3392] Do not partner with someone who's going to just by virtue of who they are.
[time=3399] And we hope that God would move in that.
[time=3401] We hope that God might lead them to faith.
[time=3403] We and God can do that in a number of different ways and he might even use you to some extent but do not give yourself and your heart and your nights and your activity and your choices.
[time=3416] Do not partner.
[time=3418] No, be used of Him.
[time=3421] Be used of Him from a safe God-honoring distance that says, "This is who I am and I'll be gracious
[time=3429] and I'll be kind and I might even invite you to come with me and I'll even come serve if you've got needs but you know what, I will not partner with you."
[time=3440] Bad company does corrupt good intentions and unchecked ungodliness does get worse.
[time=3448] There's so much to learn and so much to see and I can't wait to have you back next week
[time=3455] and we'll just keep plugging along and seeing what it is we can learn from a man who was
[time=3461] willing to stand, a man who was willing to speak.
[time=3465] And you know what?
[time=3466] We're going to learn some things.
[time=3467] Maybe we already have this morning from one whose life had regressed.
[time=3475] Ahab has some things to teach us and we'll see his story unfold as well.
[time=3483] Come back again next week, bring a friend, invite someone to join you and we will together
[time=3489] look into even further, look into this life of Elijah and to his story and learn some
[time=3495] things that just may encourage you and me to be the man or to be the woman that God wants
[time=3501] us to be to make a difference in a world that really, really needs it.
[time=3506] Would you stand with me and we'll pray and we'll be on our way.
[time=3510] Father, thank you so very much for what really is a privilege and we don't take it lightly.
[time=3516] God, we know that there are people in places today right now that's very minute across the world who they would give anything.
[time=3523] Really, they would give anything to be able to sing a song, or read a verse, or be with
[time=3532] other believers.
[time=3533] God, there are some today who live in such persecution and torment we wouldn't even understand.
[time=3541] And so, God, we don't take for granted the privilege of this fellowship and this time together.
[time=3547] And God, we pray that as we leave this place because of your spirit and because of your word, God that we would be different, maybe specifically, God that we would leave this place, men and women, students, moms and dads, grandmothers and grandfathers, maybe a little bit more willing to trust you, to stand in places that might be hard to stand, to say
[time=3569] things that might be hard to say, but God to do it, and to do it lovingly, but to do
[time=3576] it faithfully because we know you want to make a difference in a cultured God that has been unchecked.
