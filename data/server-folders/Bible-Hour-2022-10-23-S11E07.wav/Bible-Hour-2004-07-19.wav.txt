[time=60] (upbeat music) - About three weeks ago, I got the privilege to go
[time=84] to the Dominican Republic with a team from our student ministries, and one of the biggest challenges that we were facing as a team was the language barrier in realizing that we couldn't communicate with hardly anyone that we were gonna see.
[time=98] And in looking over that challenge, I just was thinking to myself, like what was something that I could do to overcome that barrier?
[time=107] And I decided to learn some songs in Spanish so that we could sing with the kids and relate to them on that level.
[time=114] So we just kinda wanted to share with you a glimpse of what that was like to sing with them in Spanish, and listen to them sing with us 'cause they knew what we were saying.
[time=123] And so we're gonna play some slides for you and sing you one of the songs that we sang, so I hope you enjoy it.

[time=364] (audience applauds)
[time=381] - Hi, I'm Mitch, teaching pastor at Black Hawk Ministries, and I wanna thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour this morning.
[time=388] You're gonna hear the second in the series of Elijah by Kelly, and I think you're gonna be moved.
[time=395] We were, I took notes on my iPad, and he's gonna talk about a lessons that we can learn from Elijah's life on how standing for God is not always popular.
[time=407] Maybe not even in the home or in the car, or especially in the workplace.
[time=413] And then second, that God works in uncommon ways, oftentimes, to move us.
[time=421] And it's really worth listening to this message.
[time=424] You might wanna grab a cup of coffee and sit down and enjoy this and allow God to just move in your heart, in your mind, in your will, in your emotions, and in your spirit.
[time=435] And I'd like you to invite you to come to church this morning.
[time=438] I'll be preaching the third part in our series on Elijah and the message is entitled Hide and Seek.
[time=443] So if you come this morning, please come up front and say hello to me and let me put a face with the name.
[time=449] And I also wanna invite you to Common Ground.
[time=451] Takes place every Wednesday night.
[time=453] It's a separate worship service.
[time=455] It's acoustic worship.
[time=456] It begins at 6.45 and runs till 8.15 p.m.
[time=460] Runs consistently with our Awana program, which will begin this fall.
[time=464] That's a ministry for kids in elementary school.
[time=468] And we also have simple suppers that will begin here in a few weeks when the school season starts at 5.45 and they'll run till 6.45.
[time=477] And also we have an AA meeting from 5.30 to about 6.45.
[time=482] And we just invite you to come.
[time=485] Invite you to come to Common Ground and enjoy a smaller community, a smaller church setting and authentic community where we know we have Common Ground in our sin and also in the grace only offered in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.
[time=502] Thank you so much for joining us.
[time=504] And we'd also like to invite you to our Stillwater baptism service August 15th.
[time=510] It's a Sunday night at 4 p.m.
[time=512] About 4 or 500 of us will go out there and enjoy hearing the stories of changed lives.
[time=519] - And New York City policemen, several New York residents, a Middle Eastern vendor at, I think it was a hot dog vendor.
[time=526] And then people from these countries from California.
[time=530] (congregation laughing) From Ireland, Slovenia, Greece, South Africa, Puerto Rico, Ethiopia, Korea, Israel, Romania, the Dominican, Australia, Norway, Africa and Italy.
[time=546] And those are just the ones that we know of for sure.
[time=550] And we kind of debrief those.
[time=551] Isn't that amazing?
[time=552] Like we get to go, we get to be the Lord to somebody from halfway around the world in New York City.
[time=561] And it's just a great thing.
[time=564] And so we're gonna sing this song kind of as a closing commitment that our mission field isn't in New York and isn't in the Dominican and it isn't somewhere else, but it's right here every day.
[time=574] (upbeat music)
[time=582] [MUSIC - 16 seconds]
[time=602] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 175 seconds]
[time=785] One more time.
[time=787] [MUSIC - 11 seconds]
[time=829] - God is so good and one thing, just thank you for all the support prayerfully and financially that you gave our mission teams over those two weeks.
[time=840] It was truly a family trip.
[time=842] And then one more thing if you could pray for, there's two big trips going on this week.
[time=848] Tom Cashin and the RAF trip team left this morning with I think 140 kids.
[time=852] Many of them are still searching for Jesus and tomorrow Ken Wester is leading a trip to Michigan with about 50 or 60 kids.
[time=861] Some of them don't know, haven't found Jesus yet.
[time=864] And so two more mission trips this week.
[time=866] Pray for those if you think about it.
[time=868] And let me just pray for Kelly and the message this morning.
[time=870] Father, thank you so much for this family here at BlackHuck and thank you for the grounding in God's word and thank you that Kelly and the elders and the other teachers they teach it.
[time=884] And that they hold out the word of life and they speak it boldly.
[time=892] And I pray this morning just for your spirit to fill Kelly with the words that teach us and to fill us with ears and hearts to listen.
[time=900] Make us humble and make us moldable today in your hands.
[time=905] As we hear your word and apply it to our life.
[time=910] Lord, we love you.
[time=912] And we thank you for the opportunity to serve and to do all of this in the name that is above all names.
[time=920] Jesus, amen.
[time=923] As they're setting the stakes,
[time=934] let me just say this to you before we lose that moment there.
[time=939] And I'll just share from my heart to yours.
[time=942] There's so many things that run through my mind when I see all those pictures.
[time=948] Little kids and the Dominican families and huts.
[time=954] Moms and kids and individuals on the streets of New York City.
[time=961] And what runs through my mind is this.
[time=965] And many of you have been to those places.
[time=969] And those places and those people are, they're here.
[time=972] And left to themselves, they have no hope.
[time=979] None.
[time=983] They're gonna get eaten alive.
[time=987] And the only hope they have is the church.
[time=993] That's it.
[time=998] It's the only hope that one of those little kids in the Dominican has.
[time=1002] It's the only hope that a family in New York City has.
[time=1004] It's the only hope that a Muslim refugee here in Fort Wayne has is that someday maybe a fully surrendered follower of Jesus Christ would care enough about them, give themselves to the Lord in such a way that they could be used to make a difference.
[time=1025] And so if you're ever wondering why we do this, this isn't about playing church.
[time=1032] This isn't about 70 minutes on a Sunday morning.
[time=1036] No, we do what we do because we're the only hope they have.
[time=1040] And so as you and I continue to make our way down this road, please be reminded why we do it.
[time=1047] And what a privilege these kids have had and what a privilege you and I have to try and be like Elijah who we're gonna study again today, somebody who was willing to in the face of a deteriorating culture, stand and speak and live and in so doing make a difference.
[time=1066] [AMEN] Father, we come before you this morning, prayerful and hopeful that your word would do what only your word can.
[time=1073] God, that it would remind us and teach us.
[time=1078] God, that it would point us in new directions.
[time=1081] God, that it would show us again things that maybe we've forgotten.
[time=1084] God, please transform us today because of our time with you.
[time=1090] In your son's name we pray.
[time=1092] [AMEN] Thanks, Brennan.
[time=1096] Thank all of you.
[time=1097] Thanks for being here today and what a privilege it is to get to study God's word together.
[time=1104] So thankful again for Rick and for the team that was just up here and I'll just reiterate what I said earlier, if people remember on the music front, on the worship front, it will always be changing.
[time=1116] It will never stay the same and as long as the songs get sung, right?
[time=1121] As long as the truth is proclaimed, amen?
[time=1124] As long as we continue to give young musicians and artists the opportunity and the settings to express their gifts, bring it on, amen?
[time=1134] I'm so thankful for you and for this place and that we're a body that's mindful of those things.
[time=1141] Hey, turn in your Bibles if you would to First Kings, chapter 17.
[time=1145] First and second Chronicles, first and second Kings.
[time=1149] First and second Kings, first and second Chronicles, sorry.
[time=1154] If you're back there looking around, don't listen to me.
[time=1157] First Kings, chapter 17, chapter one, verse one, all the way down through 16 is where we're gonna go this morning.
[time=1164] And what a great start we had last week to this study of Elijah and what a prophet, what a prophet he was, a great willingness to be used of God in a time where things were really going south, a willingness to stand and speak and live, a willingness to respond to God's call in a situation that would have been very, very challenging, very, very unsettling and yet there he was, willing in the midst of Ahab's reign, King Ahab, we met him last week.
[time=1196] In the midst of Ahab's reign, a godless reign, a reign that was moving, a kingdom that was moving in a situation that was moving further and further and further away from God's truth and what was right, he calls Elijah to come and to speak and Elijah does.
[time=1216] And what a message he brought and what lessons we can learn as we watch this story unfold.
[time=1222] Would you stand with me in honor of God's word and allow me just to read through these first 16 verses and then we'll jump in together.
[time=1231] Now Elijah, the Tishpite who was of the settlers of Gilead, said to Ahab, as the Lord the God of Israel lives, before whom I stand surely there will be neither do nor reign these years except by my word.
[time=1247] God calls Elijah to come before this crazy, maniacal king who was moving further and further away from God's truth and declare to him that the very thing they counted on to live, reign, and the very thing attributed to their God bale, he was the God of fertility, he was the God of reign.
[time=1267] That very thing God says through Elijah, no more, no reign, no do until I say so.
[time=1277] The word of the Lord came to him saying, go away, verse three, having confronted Ahab.
[time=1283] God says to Elijah, go away from here and turn eastward and hide yourself by the Brooks Shareeth, which is east of the Jordan.
[time=1290] It shall be that you will drink of the brook and I have commanded the Ravens to provide for you there.
[time=1296] So he went and did according to the word of the Lord for he went and lived by the Brooks Shareeth, which is east of the Jordan.
[time=1303] The Ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning and bread and meat in the evening and he would drink from the brook.
[time=1309] Verse seven, it says it happened after a while that the brook dried up because there was no rain in the land.
[time=1316] And then the word of the Lord came to him saying, arise, go to Zarifath, which belongs to Sidon and stay there.
[time=1324] Behold, I have commanded a widow there to provide for you.
[time=1327] So he arose and went to Zarifath and when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks and he called to her and said, please, get me a little water in a jar that I may drink.
[time=1340] As she was going to get it, he called to her and said, please, as well, bring me a piece of bread in your hand.
[time=1347] But she said as the Lord, your God lives, I have no bread.
[time=1352] Only a handful of flour in the bowl and a little oil in the jar.
[time=1357] And behold, I am gathering a few sticks that I may go in and prepare for me and my son that we may eat it and die.
[time=1364] Then Elijah said to her, do not fear, go.
[time=1370] Do as you have said, but make me a little bread cake from it first and bring it out to me.
[time=1375] And afterward you may make one for yourself and for your son.
[time=1379] For thus says the Lord God of Israel, the bowl of flour shall not be exhausted, nor shall the jar of oil be empty until the day that the Lord sends rain on the face of the earth.
[time=1393] So she went and did according to the word of Elijah and she and her household ate for how many days?
[time=1399] Many.
[time=1401] The bowl of flour was not exhausted nor did the jar of oil become empty according to the word of the Lord which he spoke through Elijah.
[time=1411] Would you bow your head and pray with me this morning, Father, as we read this passage, we are reminded again, God, that your ways are not our ways.
[time=1423] God always, your thoughts are not our thoughts.
[time=1426] God, the way in which you move.
[time=1429] God, the things that you ask us to do, God, the places that you send us, the message that you give us to deliver.
[time=1435] God, sometimes it doesn't seem to make sense.
[time=1438] Sometimes God, in our humanness, we get confused.
[time=1441] But, oh, God, today, would you, as we study this passage and as we see this story, continue to unfold, God, would you reach deep into our lives, into every situation, God, that you need access to, God, and help shape us and mold us into the people who would be willing to respond to you no matter what.
[time=1463] God, as confusing as it might be, as stretching as it might be.
[time=1468] God, we pray today that your word, as it penetrates our hearts and lives and every circumstance therein.
[time=1475] God, that it would not return void, that it would do its work, that we would be changed, that others would be pointed toward what is right.
[time=1483] And we'll thank you for it.
[time=1486] And your son, Jesus, his name, amen.
[time=1491] You can be seated.
[time=1492] Well, hey, number one, if you're taking notes, why don't you write this down?
[time=1497] Because this is really, really true.
[time=1499] When you think about the opportunity, God gave Elijah, and when you think about the opportunity that God gives you and I to make a difference in whatever circumstance we find ourselves in, part of making a difference oftentimes will lead you and I to have to stand up, to have to speak up.
[time=1516] Part of the situation is, part of the way the deal works out is that we oftentimes have to live out our faith in a certain way, and sometimes write this down.
[time=1527] Sometimes living, standing, and speaking for God isn't always popular.
[time=1534] Sometimes the call that he has placed on your life to be who he has called you to be in whatever circumstance he has you in, just like the circumstance he had Elijah in, sometimes as you live it out, sometimes as you speak it, sometimes as you stand up for what's right.
[time=1553] Sometimes that's not very easy.
[time=1556] Sometimes it brings to your life and sometimes it brings to the circumstance of your day challenges, because sometimes it just isn't popular.
[time=1566] Sometimes when you stand up for what's right, sometimes when you really live for him people, you thought were your friends turned their backs on you.
[time=1575] Maybe someone in the room this morning has experienced that.
[time=1580] Sometimes when you stand up for what's right, sometimes when you speak up and don't allow what is wrong to go on a dress, sometimes boyfriends break up with you.
[time=1590] Sometimes a spouse will begin to view you differently.
[time=1596] When all of a sudden you care about and are willing to stand up for what is good and right and true.
[time=1604] Sometimes fellow employees will turn what used to be warm shoulder.
[time=1609] Now sometimes fellow employees will turn a cold shoulder because all of a sudden you're standing for appropriately and with tact and with a degree of appropriateness, but still nonetheless all of a sudden you know what?
[time=1623] You're not laughing at what they're laughing at.
[time=1625] You're not engaging in what they're engaging in.
[time=1628] And all of a sudden your willingness to stand causes them to grow cold toward you.
[time=1635] Sometimes when you stand up for what's right, the popular crowd starts to look down on you.
[time=1644] Now see right there when I said that many of you in the room immediately felt as if my words were aimed at students.
[time=1651] But you know what, those words weren't just aimed at students because you know what people?
[time=1658] There was this thing in me when I was 14 I wanted really, really bad to be light.
[time=1664] There was this thing in most of us in the room today that when we were 14, 15 years ago, we wanted really, really bad to be with the associated with the connected to the in crowd.
[time=1677] And truth be told at age 41, at age 52, at age 37,
[time=1685] whatever your age is guess what?
[time=1687] It hasn't really changed.
[time=1689] It looks a little different, but yet this morning
[time=1695] if you're 14, 15, 13, 12, you know what?
[time=1698] Sometimes when you do what's right in your world, the popular crowd begins to look differently at you.
[time=1705] And the same things going on with grown adults still wanting to be light, still wanting to be in, still wanting to be accepted and still being given the opportunity to do, stand, speak what's right.
[time=1727] Sometimes those who watch you, as you try to do what's right, don't like it.
[time=1733] And sometimes they tell you about it.
[time=1735] I've told you many times of the encounters that I myself have had.
[time=1740] I can think back to many a note, many an email who's thinking about it this week.
[time=1745] I remember several years ago, a note that showed up handwritten by an individual who described me as they were a Bible hour viewer and they described me as arrogant, over, opinionated and by the way boring.
[time=1760] This person said and they were, they went on in the note to say how they were really, really wishing I would just keep my, my opinions to myself that my opinions were offensive and I was boring.
[time=1775] They didn't know if they had mentioned that.
[time=1778] But people write these things.
[time=1779] People say these things.
[time=1780] People respond sometimes these ways.
[time=1783] Few years ago I had a man come right down here, right down in front and you know, so I'm walking, so I'm walking down the aisle.
[time=1792] There was a line of people and you know, and you can see, I can see after a few years at this, it's interesting.
[time=1797] You can kind of see on the face of an individual as they're making their way down.
[time=1802] You can almost just from their face tell if it's going to be a pleasant conversation or maybe it might be an uncomfortable conversation and he had that look.
[time=1810] It was not going to be fun.
[time=1812] And so he waited in line and then very tactfully not in a loud way didn't make a big scene but let me know that he, how did he say it?
[time=1821] He told me he wished he could put an end to me and this sham of a ministry.
[time=1826] I got a little nervous when he talked about bringing an end to me.
[time=1830] I wasn't quite sure what he meant by that.
[time=1832] He didn't seem dangerous but he was really, really passionate and then come to find out, you know how you always do.
[time=1837] You ask a few questions and then you realize that he had a relative who we were trying to deal with.
[time=1843] He had a relative, somebody he cared for.
[time=1845] This guy was far from God and upset at the way some things had been handled, upset at the way, some things had been said, not understanding some of our intentions.
[time=1857] And man, he came in here that one day just firing both barrels.
[time=1860] See, sometimes people do that when you stand up and just try your best and you don't always do it perfectly.
[time=1868] I've told you many times about the first church I ever served in.
[time=1872] Most of you know the story.
[time=1874] 26 years old had no idea really what I was doing.
[time=1877] Just trying my best to do what was right.
[time=1879] Took a stand in a deacon meeting one night on a moral situation with one of the sons of one of the deacons and wouldn't budge.
[time=1890] And then showed up that next Sunday morning to preach and all the deacons were in my office, lined up along the side of the wall there and they let me know that morning that I was fired and that I should have all my things cleaned out by the next afternoon.
[time=1907] And so that was it.
[time=1911] I was done.
[time=1912] My wife was two, three months pregnant.
[time=1914] Didn't know what we were going to do, where we were going to go.
[time=1917] Came back that next day, cleaned out my office within a week.
[time=1921] I was waiting tables.
[time=1922] Did that for a while.
[time=1924] Eventually there I was waiting tables with my wife and newborn son in the booth in the corner leaving me big tips hoping we could somehow, you know, get it all figured out.
[time=1933] Sometimes that happens to you and to me.
[time=1938] And you know what, it didn't just happen to you and me.
[time=1942] That has happened from the very beginning.
[time=1944] Look at Jeremiah 19.
[time=1947] You want to turn your Bibles to Canada, Jeremiah, chapter 19, we'll pick it up in verse 14.
[time=1952] The fact that sometimes it's really unpopular to stand for him, speak for him, live for him.
[time=1959] This is not a new concept.
[time=1960] In Jeremiah 19, it says, then Jeremiah came from Tofeth where the Lord had sent him to prophesy and he stood in the court of the Lord's house and said to all the people, verse 15.
[time=1972] Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, behold, I am about to bring on this city and all its towns, the entire calamity that I have declared against it because they have stiffened their necks so as not to heed my words.
[time=1988] First verse in chapter 20 says, when Pashoor the priest, the son of Imer who was chief officer in the house of the Lord heard Jeremiah prophesying these things, Pashoor had Jeremiah the prophet beaten and put him in the stocks that were at the upper Benjamin gate, which was by the house of the Lord.
[time=2010] And this wasn't the only time this happened to Jeremiah.
[time=2015] One time they dug a pit and threw him in it.
[time=2018] Another time they physically attacked him.
[time=2021] You can think about Daniel in the Old Testament.
[time=2024] Daniel was just a 15 year old boy.
[time=2026] All he did was get kidnapped by Nebuchadnezzar, brought away to a far off land called Babylon, removed from his family, removed from all he knew.
[time=2036] And at the age of 15, Daniel simply devoted himself, purposed in his heart to follow and give himself completely to his God.
[time=2046] And he ate the things that God had told him to eat, even when the captors had tried to have him eat something else, he worshiped and served and gave himself to his God and God honored that.
[time=2059] Later in his stay there, he changes allegiance.
[time=2062] Nebuchadnezzar is gone and then King Darius is there.
[time=2065] Now Daniel is a grown young man and in Daniel's devotion to God and Daniel's willingness to stand and speak and live for him.
[time=2075] One thing he wasn't gonna let go of was he was gonna pray.
[time=2078] Every day he was gonna pause and pray to his God.
[time=2081] And those around Darius grew jealous
[time=2088] of the way Daniel was making his way through the ranks respected by those that he worked with, respected by those who saw him live his life and so they, if you're familiar with the story at all, you know, they made up a new law that said you couldn't pray to that God and Daniel kept praying and they threw him in the lion's den.
[time=2110] And God was with him and brought him through it.
[time=2115] Look at Acts chapter seven.
[time=2117] Sometimes speaking for God isn't popular.
[time=2122] In Acts seven we see Stephen reminding the stiff neck Jewish religious leaders of that day of their sinfulness, of how they had rejected Christ and how their fathers had rejected what was true and right for generations and having given them the talk that he gave them, it says in Acts 754, now when they heard this, they were cut to the quick and they began gnashing their teeth at him.
[time=2148] It's what happens sometimes when people living in rebellion, when people living in ways they know down deep inside, they shouldn't still when they hear the truth oftentimes the initial reaction is violent.
[time=2161] They began gnashing their teeth at him, but being full of the Holy Spirit, it says in verse 55, he gazed intently into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.
[time=2173] And he said, "Behold, I see the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God." But they cried out with a loud voice and covered their ears and rushed at him with one impulse.
[time=2185] When they had driven him out of the city, they began stoning him and the witnesses laid aside their robes at the feet of a young man named Saul who would later fully surrender his life to Christ and have his name changed to Paul.
[time=2199] And then the passage goes on.
[time=2202] They went on stoning Stephen as he called on the Lord and said, "Lord Jesus received my spirit." Been falling on his knees, he cried out with a loud voice, "Lord, do not hold this sin against them." Having said this, he fell asleep.
[time=2221] You know what?
[time=2222] We see the same thing in our story of Elijah.
[time=2225] You see it all through scriptures, but go back now.
[time=2228] Go back to first Kings.
[time=2230] And you don't see it immediately there in chapter 17, but you know what?
[time=2234] If you go a page over to chapter 18, you go over to first Kings 18, verse seven.
[time=2242] You see Elijah having a conversation with a man called Obadiah.
[time=2247] And in the conversation with Obadiah, you realize how unpopular the confrontation with Ahab had been.
[time=2256] You don't really see it there in the text in 17, but a chapter later in 18, you realize, oh my goodness, this thing really caused a stir.
[time=2263] Look what it says now, as Obadiah was on the way, behold Elijah met him and he recognized him.
[time=2270] Obadiah recognized Elijah and fell on his face and says, "Is this you Elijah, my master?" He said to him, "It is I, go say to your master, behold, Elijah is here." See, Obadiah ran the house.
[time=2284] Obadiah oversaw the estate of Ahab.
[time=2287] And even though Ahab had gone where he had gone, Obadiah had remained faithful to God.
[time=2294] And so now Elijah is saying to Obadiah, go get Ahab, tell him I'm here.
[time=2301] And so here's Obadiah's response.
[time=2303] He said, "What sin have I committed "that you are giving your servant "into the hand of Ahab to put me to death?
[time=2310] "As the Lord your God lives, watch this.
[time=2312] "There is no nation or kingdom where my master Ahab "has not sent to search for you.
[time=2320] "And when they said to him, he is not here, "he made the kingdom or nation swear "that they could not find you.
[time=2327] "And now you're saying, go say to your master, "behold, Elijah is here.
[time=2332] "It will come about when I leave you, "but the spirit of the Lord will carry you, "or I do not know.
[time=2338] "So when I come and tell Ahab and he cannot find you, "he will kill me.
[time=2342] "Although I, your servant, have feared the Lord "from my youth." Ahab had initiated a worldwide search.
[time=2355] He wanted Elijah's head because Elijah was willing
[time=2362] to stand and speak and live for God in that moment and in that situation that God had called him to.
[time=2370] Now let me ask you a question this morning.
[time=2374] And you just be really, really honest with yourself.
[time=2380] I assume you, I assume you are most of the time.
[time=2385] At least I would hope that you would be.
[time=2388] Let me ask you this, what right thing should you be doing but you're not today?
[time=2398] What right thing should you be saying but you're not?
[time=2405] Because you're afraid.
[time=2408] You're not quite sure where it will lead.
[time=2410] You're not quite sure what it might bring.
[time=2412] You're not quite sure how they would view you.
[time=2419] What right thing is that you should be doing but you're not and would you today be willing to speak?
[time=2425] Would you, maybe today in light of what you're seeing here in the scriptures, be willing to stand and live for him for what is right even if it costs you?
[time=2437] And let's just be real, let's just continue on the honest train of thought and let's just be really clear about that word cost.
[time=2449] Because people you know and I know that whatever it might cost you today to do what is right, to say what is right in comparison to what it has cost others, hey, most importantly in comparison to what it cost him who gave his life for you so you could live this life in a way that is right, no comparison.
[time=2472] It might cost you a little financially, it might cost you a little relationally, it might cost you personally, but would you be willing to pay that price in an effort to honor him?
[time=2487] Let's look at something else here.
[time=2494] You can write this down number two.
[time=2495] As the story of Elijah unfolds, we realize that God provides in uncommon ways in uncommon places, that God provides in uncommon ways
[time=2507] and in uncommon places, and I'll tell you this, there are people in this room this morning who have seen enough of life.
[time=2514] There are those in the room this morning who have walked this road of faith a long, long time.
[time=2520] There are those in the room this morning and you know that this is true.
[time=2524] I know you and I know that you know this is so very true.
[time=2530] Our God is the great provider.
[time=2533] Our God is the great shepherd and I know that there are those of you here in this room this morning and you could speak to, you could testify to the fact that though sometimes it doesn't come when you thought it was going to, and though sometimes it didn't happen in the way that you would have anticipated, it he provides for our needs.
[time=2553] And watch what he does here.
[time=2558] In 1 Kings 17, if you go back to chapter 17, we see God providing in uncommon ways, in uncommon places.
[time=2567] 1 Kings 17 verses two to nine.
[time=2572] 1 Kings 17 verses two to nine, watch this now.
[time=2576] The word of the Lord came to him.
[time=2579] He has confronted Ahab and now the word of the Lord comes immediately to him saying, "Go away from here and turn eastward, Elijah." Okay?
[time=2587] "And hide yourself by the brook, Sharith, which is east of the Jordan.
[time=2591] It shall be that you will drink of the brook and Elijah's going, okay, okay, that's good.
[time=2597] I can do that.
[time=2597] And I have commanded the ravens to provide for you there.
[time=2602] I have commanded the birds to bring you what you need." So he went and did according to the word of the Lord, for he went and lived by the brook, Sharith, which is east of the Jordan and the ravens.
[time=2616] The birds brought in bread and meat in the morning.
[time=2619] And the birds brought in bread and meat in the evening, and he would drink from the brook.
[time=2624] Well, it happened after a while the brook dried up because there was no rain in the land and the word of the Lord came to him saying, "Okay, I met your need there.
[time=2631] Now watch this.
[time=2632] Arise and go to Zaraphath, which belongs to Sidon and stay there.
[time=2636] Behold, I have commanded a widow.
[time=2639] I have commanded a widow there to provide for you.
[time=2649] So you put yourself, just for a moment, you put yourself in Elijah's sandals, okay?
[time=2654] You put on his tunic.
[time=2655] And just for a moment, realize that at a time of great need, at a time of physical need, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob says to you, "You go and I'm gonna have birds fly in meat to you.
[time=2671] You can drink from the brook and I'm gonna have ravens bring you your breakfast and I'm gonna have ravens bring you your dinner." And then the brook's gonna dry up and there's not gonna be any more water.
[time=2683] So I've gotta move you over here to Zaraphath where a widow in that day, little historical input here for you, in that day, the widow, the widow's like, the widow's down here.
[time=2695] See, the widow's below the bottom wrong.
[time=2698] You see, in that day, it would have been the husband who provided everything.
[time=2702] And without the husband, she has nothing.
[time=2706] And she has a son and she has absolutely nothing.
[time=2711] The widow was the, what she said there in the passage about I'm gonna go make the cake and he and I are gonna eat it.
[time=2716] Then we're gonna die.
[time=2717] That was true.
[time=2719] They were the first to expire.
[time=2721] They were the poor.
[time=2723] They were the homeless.
[time=2724] They were nothing.
[time=2725] So you're a legend.
[time=2727] God says, "Okay, I'm gonna bring, I'm gonna have birds fly in meat for you.
[time=2731] And then I'm gonna send you over here and you're gonna be provided for by a widow." And you got a note.
[time=2739] I mean, you just got to go back through the passage and you just got to make a note of his response.
[time=2744] When God said, "Go to the brook and I'm gonna fly in birds with meat." What did he do?
[time=2750] He went.
[time=2752] He didn't negotiate.
[time=2754] He didn't say, "Wait a minute.
[time=2756] No, you look right there in the passage." He went.
[time=2758] When God said, "I'm gonna take you over here to zerafath when that's all dried up and the widow's gonna provide for you." He went immediately.
[time=2766] Now, I've sensed this all week long
[time=2774] and I just wanna say it to you this morning this way.
[time=2777] I know, I believe that today.
[time=2779] But God has brought, obviously, God has brought whoever's here today, God brought you.
[time=2786] And I believe that today as we've, as he,
[time=2792] and I've just tried to do my part as we've prepared for this, I just believe in my heart that today he was gonna bring people into this room and that there would be many in the room today who would have as Elijah had.
[time=2809] And as I have, I believe today he's brought some people into this room who have needs.
[time=2817] I believe that there are people in this room today who have serious needs.
[time=2825] I believe he had that orchestrated long ago.
[time=2831] There are people in this room today and truth be told you have real marriage or family needs.
[time=2841] Truth be told and maybe it's kind of new data or maybe it's been there for a long, long time but the fact of the matter is that what's going on in your marriage is absolutely other than what God has designed.
[time=2859] Truth be told, I believe there are people in this room today and what is going on with your family.
[time=2865] What's going on in your home has maybe reached a new level of frustration and hurt.
[time=2872] I believe there are people in this room this morning with life and death needs.
[time=2876] There may be some here who got a report back this week, there may be some here who heard things from your doctor or specialist that you never thought you'd hear.
[time=2886] But I believe there's people in this room and life and death are on the line.
[time=2891] There are those in the room and you're facing still and you're battling still but you feel like you're losing the fight with addiction.
[time=2900] There are some of you in this room who have employment/provide for your family needs.
[time=2909] There are some in here whose kids are choosing life apart from God.
[time=2917] You have kids choosing life apart from God needs and you're not quite sure what to do and you can't seem to find the book that gives you all the answers for what he or she is doing or where he or she is going.
[time=2934] There are some in the room and you have needs in the ongoing private sin arena.
[time=2940] In that ongoing private sin and failure arena,
[time=2949] you have needs, a need for deliverance and a need for strength and courage.
[time=2955] And I wanna invite you this morning to do something
[time=2961] and I don't want you to be ashamed of it and I don't want you to be worried about it because you know what we say, we're a family here and we don't just say that.
[time=2971] We really, really mean that and this morning I wanna give you an opportunity to maybe be reminded of some things that you need to be reminded of.
[time=2980] This morning I wanna just give you a word from the Lord, a word from the Scriptures that I think really speaks to what you and I are going through and I'm gonna ask you to do this.
[time=2993] You know what, if you've got a need this morning, I mean, it's really confusing for you.
[time=2999] It's really difficult for you.
[time=3002] You're not quite sure how you're gonna handle this one.
[time=3004] You're not quite sure where the relief's gonna come from.
[time=3008] You're not quite sure what he's up to and you are very, very this morning.
[time=3011] Truth be told in the bottom of your heart you're really troubled and you need some help.
[time=3018] I wanna just encourage you and here's what I'm gonna ask you to do.
[time=3024] I'm gonna open to Matthew chapter six, verse 25 and I'm gonna ask everybody in this room right now to bow your heads and close your eyes.
[time=3032] Would you do that in honor of this moment here?
[time=3034] Would you just bow your heads and would you close your eyes?
[time=3037] And with every head bowed and every eye closed,
[time=3043] I'm gonna ask you to do something if you have a need today and you're not ashamed to admit it.
[time=3053] You would just like to be encouraged.
[time=3057] I'm gonna ask you if you would just quietly stand.
[time=3060] Right where you're at.
[time=3062] Nobody needs to look around and nobody needs to exercise curiosity but I'll tell you what, if you've got a need today?
[time=3072] Physical, emotional, relational.
[time=3075] If you've got a spiritual need, if you need assurance of your salvation, if you have questions that you just feel deep in your heart need to be answered.
[time=3086] If there's things going on at home, if there's stuff going on with an addiction, if there's things going on with your kids, if you've got a need, stand up.
[time=3094] And you're sitting there thinking, well my goodness, what are they gonna think of me?
[time=3099] These people sitting nearby, they're gonna see me or feel me stand up.
[time=3104] What would they think?
[time=3105] You know what they'll think?
[time=3106] They'll think you have a need.
[time=3111] And let me just remind you that I'm standing right now.
[time=3115] I'm just standing with you, 'cause I've got a few.
[time=3122] And you know what I'm gonna read here to you.
[time=3127] I'm gonna read God's Word to you.
[time=3130] I'm gonna remind those of you who stand with me today here in this moment.
[time=3134] I'm gonna remind you of what is true.
[time=3137] And I'm gonna just pray as I read.
[time=3138] I'm gonna ask those of you who are seated.
[time=3141] You obviously today are at a point where you feel as if, you sense as if, for now God is meeting your needs.
[time=3148] And that's a great place to be and I'm thankful in that sense that you're seated.
[time=3152] Would you pray for those who stand nearby?
[time=3157] And let me, if I could just read this to those of you who are standing.
[time=3160] It says in Matthew six verse 24, and I just pray the Spirit of God wouldn't take these words and allow them to live with strength in your heart.
[time=3171] It says in Matthew six 25 for this reason,
[time=3177] I say to you, those of you standing here today, I say to you, do not be worried about your life as to what you will eat or what you will drink, nor for your body as to what you will put on, is not life more than food and the body more than clothing.
[time=3192] He says to you and I this morning, he says remember, he says look at the birds of the air that they do not sow nor reap nor gather into barns and yet your heavenly father feeds them.
[time=3202] Are you not worth much more than they?
[time=3205] And let me just answer that rhetorical question for those of you standing this morning.
[time=3210] You are worth so much more to him than a bird in the sky.
[time=3215] And who of you by being worried can add a single hour
[time=3221] to his life or change a single circumstance therein?
[time=3225] And why are you worried about clothing, clothing meaning the physical arena of your life?
[time=3233] Observe how the lilies of the field grow.
[time=3237] They do not toil nor do they spin, yet I say to you that not even Solomon and all his glory clothed himself like one of these, but if God so clothes the grass of the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, will he not much more clothe you?
[time=3253] You of little faith, don't worry then, saying what will we eat or what will we drink or what will we wear for clothing?
[time=3263] For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things for your heavenly father knows that you need all these things, but here you go to those of you who stand today in humble dependence upon him in need of his touch, in need of his relief, in need of his guidance and his love and his timely provision.
[time=3284] Listen, seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things that you need
[time=3294] will be added to you in his time, in his place.
[time=3298] He may bring the birds in, he may lead you to a widow.
[time=3304] God's word says to you standing today, these things will be added to you, so do not verse 34, so do not worry about tomorrow where tomorrow will care for itself.
[time=3315] Each day has enough trouble of its own.
[time=3318] Now watch this, I'm gonna ask the rest of you
[time=3327] in this room, if you would at this time, stand.
[time=3330] And everybody, just so if you would remain with your heads bowed and your eyes closed, I'm gonna ask Brennan, if he'd come up to the piano and if he'd just play a little bit underneath us here because I wanna just paint this picture for you, if I could.
[time=3345] What you all just did, don't miss this, what you all just did, those of you who were seated, you all just in that moment right there, you all just paracalaude, you all just came alongside, and there are some in the room this morning and those who stood next to you, you know them and you may know what their need is, but you may not.
[time=3370] And with honest hearts, not out of curiosity,
[time=3378] but out of a desire to truly come alongside and encourage you may have the opportunity to even today, offer them your hand, offer them your heart, offer them some time.
[time=3392] As we paracalaude, we stand next to and we offer comfort and truth.
[time=3399] We come alongside those in need.
[time=3403] God sent the ravens and the widow to Elijah.
[time=3408] You know what I believe?
[time=3409] I believe he's gonna send somebody to you.
[time=3411] He may have already sent that someone.
[time=3415] You may today meet that someone.
[time=3418] This message today may have been your raven, but I wanna give you one more opportunity than that is this.
[time=3427] I'm gonna dismiss this here in just a moment and I'm gonna ask any elder, I'm gonna ask any staff member in the room to just make their way down to the front quietly and you know what, there may be a friend, there may be a family member, there may be somebody nearby who you know today, you can share your burden with.
[time=3448] And you may be able to share that as the days go by, but this is a family and we do love you.
[time=3456] And so if today instead of leaving, you'd like to come forward and just pray, just pray with somebody from our staff, somebody from our elder team.
[time=3464] We would love nothing more.
[time=3467] You come and you can say as much as you want, you can say nothing at all, we can just put an arm around you and lift you up to him 'cause we care for you.
[time=3476] But he is the great provider and people, he will meet that need and we would love nothing more than to be used of him to help encourage you in that direction.
[time=3487] And so God, we leave this place, having been reminded of the challenge that comes with standing for what is true.
[time=3495] But God, we believe you're enough to give us the courage to do that.
[time=3498] God, we've been reminded this morning of the fact that we have needs.
[time=3503] And sometimes those needs, they go deep into the realities of our lives and sometimes God, they bring great confusion and strife.
[time=3512] And God, we can't shoulder all of that alone, we weren't designed by you to do that.
[time=3519] And so God, thank you for those who paracolleto, those who come alongside.
[time=3524] And they put their arms around us and they whisper words of truth and hope, they befriend and they spend time, even they pray with us.
[time=3534] And so God is those who are gonna leave, leave and is those who wanna come and be prayed for, make their way down.
[time=3540] We thank you for this time.
[time=3542] We love you and we're so grateful for your truth and for the story of Elijah.
[time=3547] Help us to make a difference like he did in your son's name, we pray.
[time=3551] [AMEN]
[time=3559] (upbeat music)
