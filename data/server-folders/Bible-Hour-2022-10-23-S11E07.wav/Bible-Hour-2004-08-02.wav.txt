[time=70] >> Then your glory came, and there's a side to you.
[time=85] [MUSIC - 210 seconds]
[time=325] >> These pages are absolutely filled with God showing up in different ways.
[time=339] He comes in a pillar of fire to guide the Israelites.
[time=342] He comes in a cloud.
[time=343] He comes in a whisper.
[time=345] He parts the Red Sea.
[time=346] He comes in a burning bush.
[time=348] Just countless, countless circumstances of God showing up in big and small ways.
[time=353] And then when you get to the gospels, you see God showing up in the biggest way of all.
[time=357] When he humbly came as one of us to be a servant.
[time=362] I don't know any other way for him to show up that'd be bigger than that.
[time=366] And then went to a cross and sacrificed himself.
[time=373] I think that's worthy of our worship.
[time=384] [MUSIC]
[time=396] >> Your blood speaks a better word than all the empty claims I've heard upon this earth.
[time=407] It speaks righteousness for me.
[time=410] It stands in my defense.
[time=413] Jesus, it's your blood.
[time=416] [MUSIC]
[time=420] >> Your blood speaks a better word than all the empty claims I've heard upon this earth.
[time=431] It speaks righteousness for me.
[time=434] It stands in my defense.
[time=450] What can make us whole again?
[time=463] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[time=470] Washes pure as the, welcome as the friends of God.
[time=481] Nothing but your blood.
[time=484] Nothing but your blood, King Jesus.
[time=489] [MUSIC]
[time=499] >> Understand with us.
[time=501] Let's say your cross.
[time=504] Your cross testifies in grace.
[time=509] Tails of the Father's heart to make a way for us.
[time=515] Not boldly we approach.
[time=518] Not earth the confidence.
[time=521] It's only by your blood.
[time=528] What can wash away our sins?
[time=534] What can make us whole again?
[time=540] Nothing but the blood.
[time=543] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[time=550] What can wash us pure as the, welcome as the friends of God.
[time=564] Nothing but your blood.
[time=567] What can wash away our sins?
[time=582] What can make us whole again?
[time=588] Nothing but the blood.
[time=602] What can wash us pure as the, welcome as the friends of God.
[time=612] Nothing but your blood, nothing but your blood, King Jesus.
[time=623] How great is our God?
[time=654] Sing with me, how great is our God?
[time=660] How great is our God?
[time=678] Sing with me, how great is our God?
[time=693] How great is our God?
[time=720] Oftentimes when you read the Psalms, you'll hear the Psalmist crying out to God for deliverance
[time=731] or help or intervention in some situation.
[time=735] Oftentimes the crying out to God will come in the form of a very personal passionate plea, a question if you will.
[time=744] A question that I know I've asked before and I would guess many of you have as well.
[time=750] And the question goes something like this, the question goes God in heaven, where are you?
[time=756] Jehovah, why are you silent in this situation when I need to hear your voice?
[time=763] Sometimes the question may even just sound like this, God, when are you going to show up?
[time=770] I was talking to my daughter Wesley the other day, she's eight years old, and she asked me, she said, "Daddy, why is it that people get sick all the time?
[time=778] Why is it that they go to the hospital?" And she said, "Daddy, how come sometimes they don't come home from the hospital?" You know what she was asking me in her own way, she was wondering kind of out loud why it seemed to her that God didn't show up.
[time=792] She's got this really big heart that just wants everybody happy, healed, and healthy.
[time=797] And so I did my best to explain to this little eight-year-old heart the culminating effect of Christmas, good Friday, and Easter.
[time=805] That in the end, you know what I said, sweetie? He really showed up. He already did.
[time=811] And the fact that he came and did what he did, the fact that he came and suffered and died, the fact that he rose again,
[time=818] the fact that he showed up in the way that he did means that everybody who's ever trusted him now has their broken heart healed, their sick body made new.
[time=828] I have the unspeakable privilege of sharing with her that sometimes he shows up in the form of a cure and they get better.
[time=837] Sometimes he shows up in the form of death and they get better.
[time=842] But most importantly, I had the opportunity to tell her about our God, our God, a God that when it mattered most came.
[time=853] When evil and all that comes with evil, Herod and his efforts to kill all the babies, the Roman soldiers and the spiteful Jewish leaders,
[time=863] the evil of our day, no matter what evil has thrown at him, I got to tell her he's a God who showed up.
[time=871] And he came and because he came, we have hope and life.
[time=876] And sometimes people get better and sometimes people die, but because he's God and because he's a God who shows up in the end, it's all right.
[time=887] What a huge talk that was for her and I.
[time=890] What a huge concept for her to begin to wrestle with.
[time=894] And I just hope and pray that someday she'll come to fully understand the truth of it all.
[time=899] And you know what? I almost left it at that.
[time=902] I mean, I almost just walked away right there, but I couldn't help myself.
[time=906] I had to tell her one more story about a day when God showed up.
[time=913] I told her about a prophet whose faith was really strong, whom God had sent to a people in culture that had turned really evil.
[time=921] These people, God's own chosen people, had forgotten God and turned to other gods, other idols and other forms of worship and it was time.
[time=931] For them to be reminded that Jehovah God, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and Jacob was still there.
[time=939] He was still present and still very willing and able to show up.
[time=944] So I told her about the prophet Elijah and how he waited on Mount Carmel as the 450 prophets of Baal,
[time=953] waited for their God to cast down fire on their ceremonial altars.
[time=959] I told her how Elijah waited as they screamed and wailed and prayed to this Baal that they were sure would come.
[time=967] They were sure he would show up, but he didn't.
[time=972] False gods never do.
[time=975] And then I told her what Elijah did, how he stepped forward and prayed out to the God of Heaven.
[time=981] He praised begging God to strike the altar he had prepared, not only with wood, stones and a ceremonial calf, but with gallons and gallons of water.
[time=990] He begs God to light from Heaven above the soaking wet altar and to show in doing so, all who would doubt.
[time=999] All who had forgotten that he was the one true God.
[time=1003] Elijah, I told her, he begged God to show up and the best part was, I got to tell my daughter that he did.
[time=1012] That in the end, God showed up in a big, big way.
[time=1021] At the time of the sacrifice, the prophet Elijah stepped forward and prayed, "O Lord, God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel."
[time=1032] Anything known today that you are God of Israel and that I am your servant and have done all these things in your command.
[time=1040] Answer me, O Lord, answer me so these people will know that you, O Lord, are God and that you are turning their hearts back again.
[time=1049] [MUSIC]
[time=1060] Well, we come this morning to what many have called the greatest showdown of all.
[time=1067] It is probably the great showdown and as we come back to our study of the prophet Elijah, we come to chapter 18
[time=1076] and a situation, a scenario that is absolutely jaw-dropping.
[time=1083] It is so very significant. It is so very important.
[time=1087] And I cannot wait for you and me together to kind of unfold this truth and see what God has for us.
[time=1094] Before we jump in there, though, I want to share something with you and then I want to read a verse to you and then we're going to pray and get going.
[time=1100] I was watching TV the other day and there is, on ESPN, they have a thing called, "This is not, please hear me now.
[time=1114] It's not a public endorsement of this. This is just, I was watching it." And there's something about it that kind of caught my attention.
[time=1121] There is, on ESPN these days, a thing called the World Series of Poker cards.
[time=1126] There, I said it. Okay, I feel better.
[time=1129] Well, so I'm watching these guys play poker on TV and boy, tell you, do they play poker.
[time=1136] Hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[time=1139] I mean, again, I'm not endorsing this, I'm just telling you that the tables are stacked with chips.
[time=1145] And you got these guys and some of these gals and they're playing poker and it's called Texas Hold 'em, no limit, Texas Hold 'em.
[time=1153] And so as I'm watching this, and I've seen it a few times, there is a point in the action that really, really gets really, really interesting.
[time=1161] There's a phrase that gets said.
[time=1164] When the cards get dealt out and the guys are looking at their hands and some guy thinks he's got a really, really good hand, he'll say this phrase.
[time=1173] And when the phrase gets said, you can like hear a pin drop.
[time=1178] I mean, you can cut the tension with a knife. I mean, it's a phrase that when it gets said, it's like, oh my goodness, everybody pays attention.
[time=1187] Because you see this guy, he's got a couple cards, he thinks they're going to be real good, and so he takes all of his chips, all of his chips.
[time=1196] Sometimes it's like mountains of chips and he just takes them all and he shoves them out into the middle of the table and he says, all in.
[time=1207] And he's just going, no, are you kidding me?
[time=1213] I mean, the courage and the boldness and the tenacity and I mean, he put them all in.
[time=1224] Now, again, I don't so much endorse the putting in of all the chips.
[time=1228] You just have to hear me and most of you know me and you know where I'm going, that there's something about all in.
[time=1235] That's really, really inviting.
[time=1239] There's something about, you know what?
[time=1242] I'm going to step up here.
[time=1244] And not so much because of my hand, not so much because I might have a straight, but more so because of the hope that lives within me.
[time=1253] More so because of the God that I serve, more so because of who he is and what he's made available to me.
[time=1260] I am going to, in the midst of this life that he's placed me and I am going to go all in.
[time=1270] And see, we talk about that and I talk about that and we kind of, we throw phrases like that back and forth, but you know what?
[time=1277] I've realized as the years kind of keep going by in my own life that rarely, listen, rarely is it really the case.
[time=1294] And we come today to one who in his moment decided to get all in.
[time=1301] And not only did he decide to go all in, but he calls the people to the same kind of action.
[time=1310] He calls the people to the same kind of decision.
[time=1315] And would you stand with me and would you let me read this to you?
[time=1320] As we begin this morning, because you see in 1 Kings chapter 18, we're going to get back to this passage in just a moment.
[time=1327] We're going to just start right here for now in 1 Kings chapter 18, verse 21.
[time=1331] It says, Elijah came near to all the people.
[time=1335] You see that?
[time=1336] It says in 1 Kings 18, 21, Elijah, he came near to all the people.
[time=1342] And I wish, you know, I can kind of, I wish I could get near to all of you.
[time=1346] I can come over here and I will, I'll come over here and I'll get near to you folks right here.
[time=1350] Because I want to say this to you people right here.
[time=1353] I want to say to all you right, I want to get as close to you as I can.
[time=1356] And I want you to be as close to me as I can.
[time=1359] And you know what?
[time=1360] I want to come over here and I want to get close.
[time=1362] If I could walk up in the balcony, I would.
[time=1364] But because I know you love me and I love you and because you know we're in this together, I want us to be near.
[time=1370] So I'm just going to stand right here with you.
[time=1373] And I want to be close because I want us to hear this.
[time=1379] I want us to say this.
[time=1380] I want us to feel this together.
[time=1382] So I stand right here with you.
[time=1385] And I just, I direct your attention right there.
[time=1389] And having come near, Elijah came near to all the people and said, "How long will you hesitate between two opinions?"
[time=1397] And I'll ask you, okay, I'll go ahead and I'll ask you.
[time=1402] And I'm going to give you an opportunity to ask me in just a moment.
[time=1407] But I ask every one of you in the room this morning, for some of you it's appropriate, for some of you that you may not fit.
[time=1415] But I say to you the same words that he said to them that day, "How long will you hesitate?"
[time=1421] Your translation might say, "Waver." It's a Hebrew word that means to come up lame.
[time=1427] How long are you going to walk through the Christian life with a limp?
[time=1432] It says, "How long are you going to walk in an unbalanced way?" It's not how God designed you to walk.
[time=1440] "How long?" he says, "Will you?" "Whoever you are, whatever it is you're facing, how long?" He says, "Will you hesitate? Will you waver? Will you walk lame?"
[time=1454] Stuck in between two opinions.
[time=1458] You know what that means, don't you?
[time=1461] You know what that means, don't you? You and I, we know what that means.
[time=1464] We know that in every day of life there is this way and there is his way.
[time=1473] And so he finally he just steps up and he just says to all these people, "Hey, how long will you waver?"
[time=1480] You.
[time=1482] How long will you hesitate between two opinions?
[time=1485] If the Lord is God, he says, "Follow him."
[time=1491] Let's just go ahead and draw a lot of lines in the sand, put some stakes in the ground and just say, "You know what? I'm going to follow. If God is God, if the Lord is God, follow him.
[time=1500] If Baal is God, if money is God, if wealth is God, if pleasure is God, if work is God,
[time=1508] then go ahead, follow it.
[time=1511] But how about we make a decision? How about we really, really choose?" He says.
[time=1519] And I thought this was so interesting.
[time=1521] Came near to all the people, said, "How long will you hesitate between two opinions?
[time=1525] If the Lord is God, follow him. But if Baal, follow him, but the people did not answer him a word."
[time=1537] Have you ever spoken with someone?
[time=1541] Have you ever been in a situation with somebody who was really, really over the edge?
[time=1546] Heart, really, heart, spirit, really calloused.
[time=1551] Have you ever been in that situation where you've presented them with what is right?
[time=1554] You've maybe even given them some choices and they're so far gone, they look you back with a glazed look and they say what?
[time=1562] Nothing.
[time=1566] These people were gone.
[time=1570] And so a voice steps up and says, "You know what people today?
[time=1575] I'm inviting you to choose." And so today, us being near as one, we do our best today.
[time=1585] I just do my best today to bring you what God's word says.
[time=1588] And hopefully, there is in it for you and me today the chance to decide, to stop walking lame and walk with power, walk with purpose, walk with direction,
[time=1602] walk with peace, not guilt, hope, not shame.
[time=1607] Let's pray.
[time=1609] God, as we come today to the unfolding story of this prophet Elijah,
[time=1615] and as we come upon this scene and we begin to consider these truths, God, that you've brought,
[time=1621] to our attention today.
[time=1623] God, I pray that our hearts would be open.
[time=1625] I pray that our hearts would be really, really, really open.
[time=1630] And God, that we would allow your spirit and your word to do what only they can do, that we would be transformed.
[time=1636] God, that we would be convicted.
[time=1638] God, that we would be encouraged.
[time=1642] That we would be different because of our willingness to open ourselves to what your truth says.
[time=1650] And we'll thank you for it in your son's name.
[time=1652] We pray.
[time=1653] [AMEN] You can be seated.
[time=1659] And let me just recap if I can for you where we've been several weeks ago.
[time=1663] We started into this study of Elijah.
[time=1666] We saw back a few chapters before that Elijah, the Tish Bite, was called by God to confront a king who had gone astray.
[time=1673] The king's name was Ahab, and Ahab had, because of his choices, Ahab had, because of his life,
[time=1680] because of where he had gone, because of the compromise, and his soul, Ahab, had taken the whole nation of Israel down the wrong road.
[time=1688] Full of compromise, this nation of Israel, once God's beacon of light had now become, as we said, a few weeks ago unrecognizable.
[time=1697] Jezebel, his wife, was on an absolute torch streak to make sure that Baal worship became
[time=1704] the national religion.
[time=1705] She's having the prophets killed.
[time=1707] She is an absolute zealot for evil.
[time=1713] And between Jezebel and Ahab and all that had transpired, Israel finds itself in quite a
[time=1720] whole.
[time=1721] And so God brings Elijah to proclaim and to announce to Ahab that it wasn't going to reign.
[time=1727] There wasn't even going to be any dew on the ground until he said so.
[time=1731] And so as we pick the story back up this morning, the drought has lasted for about three years.
[time=1736] Ahab, as we saw last week, in the Obadiah section there, Ahab has been hunting down Elijah,
[time=1743] looking for Elijah.
[time=1746] Jezebel has been killing, as I said, the prophets.
[time=1749] God's been kind of hiding Elijah, so to speak.
[time=1752] But now you know what, now it's time to confront this thing head on.
[time=1757] People are wondering about God, how is this thing going to end?
[time=1760] Is he still there?
[time=1761] Has he retained his power?
[time=1762] What about Baal?
[time=1764] You know, they're asking all kinds of questions.
[time=1766] Will God show up?
[time=1772] And so let's take a look.
[time=1773] Come with me to 1 Kings, chapter 18.
[time=1777] And we're going to begin this morning in verse 17.
[time=1780] And what I'm going to do this morning, there won't be a lot on the screens today.
[time=1783] I'm just going to read through this with you.
[time=1785] We're going to allow the Word of God to do what it does so well, and that is speak for itself.
[time=1790] And if you'll allow me the privilege of just kind of taking you through this unfolding drama,
[time=1796] and as we go, I'll just share a few things.
[time=1799] But I would really invite you this morning to read along, to listen, and to see what God's Word has to say.
[time=1805] In verse 17, we'll pick it up, Ahab and Elijah are now in the same place.
[time=1811] They've come together, and it says, when Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, "Is this you?
[time=1816] You troubleer of Israel." And he said, "I have not troubled Israel." Elijah responding, "I have not troubled Israel, but you and your Father's house have."
[time=1829] You and your Father's house have troubled Israel.
[time=1833] And how is it that Ahab and his Father's house have brought Israel to this place of great despair
[time=1839] and trouble, because you have forsaken the commandments of the Lord.
[time=1844] And you have followed the bales.
[time=1846] People, look at that sentence again.
[time=1848] You will see that sentence.
[time=1849] You will see those very words.
[time=1851] You will see and catch that concept again and again and again as our study today continues.
[time=1858] Somebody had forsaken, somebody had traded, somebody had walked away from the commandments of God.
[time=1868] And Elijah says, "This is why you have trouble.
[time=1871] You have forsaken the Word of God, and you have followed," it says the bales.
[time=1878] Now then, send and gather.
[time=1879] Here we go.
[time=1880] Now then, Elijah says, "Send and gather to me all."
[time=1886] Make a note there, underline that.
[time=1887] Not some of, not most of, no, Elijah says, "Go ahead and get the entire nation together."
[time=1896] Send for all of Israel at Mount Carmel, together with 450 prophets of Baal and 450 prophets of the Asherah,
[time=1905] who eat at Jezebel's table.
[time=1911] Now I know we just got started, but I've got to say something here about the whole Word of God thing.
[time=1916] And I've got to say it to you and I've got to say it to me.
[time=1920] And I'll just say it to you real simply, and we'll move on.
[time=1924] People, He forsook.
[time=1928] He traded.
[time=1931] He took this instead of that.
[time=1933] He forsook the Word of God.
[time=1936] He walked away from what God had said to do.
[time=1940] He ignored the truth.
[time=1946] Why do you do that?
[time=1951] Psalm 19, you can turn there if you'd like.
[time=1954] Let me just read it to you if you don't want to turn there.
[time=1956] I want to just remind you about God's Word.
[time=1959] Why does a guy forsake the Word of God?
[time=1961] Why would someone like you or me walk away from what had been articulated by God himself
[time=1969] for my own good?
[time=1971] It says in Psalm 19 verse 7, the law of the Lord is perfect.
[time=1976] Restoring the soul.
[time=1977] You're going to walk away from that?
[time=1979] The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.
[time=1983] What, you're going to disregard.
[time=1985] You're going to disregard perfection and surety.
[time=1988] The precepts of the Lord are right.
[time=1990] Not wrong, right.
[time=1992] Rejoicing the heart.
[time=1994] You're going to forsake your heart being rejoi-the commandment of the Lord is pure enlightening
[time=2000] the eyes.
[time=2001] The fear of the Lord, another phrase for the Scriptures.
[time=2004] The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever.
[time=2009] The judgments of the Lord are true.
[time=2011] They are righteous altogether.
[time=2013] And on top of all that, verse 11, moreover by them your servant is warned.
[time=2019] And in keeping them there is great reward and in forsaking them, walking away from them,
[time=2026] there is great tragedy.
[time=2035] Don't walk away from.
[time=2037] Don't ignore.
[time=2040] People don't forsake the commandments of the Lord because the day that you do, the day that I do,
[time=2046] where we begin then to follow the bales.
[time=2049] Whatever the bales might look like in your life or mine today.
[time=2054] And the other thing I want to just say there is this.
[time=2058] Verse 19, "Now then he said, 'Send and gather to me all Israel.'"
[time=2064] Sometimes, you know what, in your world, sometimes in my world, your world might look a little
[time=2070] different than my world.
[time=2072] It certainly was the case here in this prophet's life.
[time=2076] Sometimes we get to points where God prompts us and moves us and we have the opportunity
[time=2083] to just say in an appropriate way, sometimes it might have to get a little gutsy, sometimes you might get a little bold, but sometimes in certain situations it's time to just say that's it.
[time=2097] I'm going to buy God's grace and with His help, that's it.
[time=2101] I'm going to stand up and I'm going to say something.
[time=2105] Sometimes it's just time to gather the entire nation and stand up.
[time=2112] One voice on the top of a mountain and say, "You know what, that's it."
[time=2119] With all due respect, but with greater respect for Him, we're going to deal with this.
[time=2124] That could be my voice, my best to be the voice that God's called me to be.
[time=2128] That might be in your home, that might be in your workplace, that might be behind a pulpit.
[time=2133] That could be in any number of different situations and circumstances, but sometimes God calls
[time=2139] you and me to stand up.
[time=2141] And boy does He stand up here.
[time=2144] He's seen a lot.
[time=2145] He's been through a lot already.
[time=2147] He's heard all the verbiage.
[time=2148] Now it's like, boom, that's it.
[time=2149] Here we go.
[time=2153] And boy do we go.
[time=2155] Keep going there.
[time=2156] Look at verse 20.
[time=2158] Says, "So Ahab sent a message among all the sons of Israel and brought the prophets together at Mount Carmel.
[time=2164] Elijah came near to all the people and said, "How long will you hesitate between two opinions?"
[time=2171] I don't know how you'd do this.
[time=2172] I'm pretty visual.
[time=2173] I've always said, if Mel Gibson makes another movie, I hope it's this.
[time=2178] I think this would be absolutely classic on the big screen.
[time=2183] Are you kidding me?
[time=2184] Visualize this.
[time=2187] It's just Him.
[time=2191] It's just the God.
[time=2192] It's just Elijah and the nation and the mountain and the wacko king and his wife who's trying
[time=2200] to kill all the, and for 850 prophets who are about to go nutsaw.
[time=2208] And him.
[time=2209] And he stands wherever he stood.
[time=2211] However he, you know, I often wondered in the Bible how they did sound, but we won't get into that.
[time=2216] But it would appear as if everybody heard him.
[time=2219] How long will you hesitate?
[time=2222] Lord has God followed him.
[time=2223] If Baal followed him, but the people did not answer him a word, then Elijah said to the people, "I alone am left a prophet of the Lord," but Baal's prophets are 450 men.
[time=2234] Now let them give us two oxen and let them choose one ox for themselves and cut it up and place it on the wood, but put no fire under it.
[time=2242] And I will prepare the other oxen laid on the wood and I will not put a fire under it.
[time=2247] Then you call on the name of your God, and I will call on the name of the Lord and the God who answers by fire, he is God.
[time=2256] And all the people said, that is a good idea.
[time=2262] Now don't skip over that too quick.
[time=2266] All the people said what?
[time=2267] All the people said that's a good idea.
[time=2269] All the people two verses ago didn't say a thing.
[time=2273] Remember?
[time=2274] He looked all the people in the eye and said, "What are you going to choose?
[time=2279] You're going to follow God, you're going to follow Baal," and all these people who were way over the cliff down the road and disobedience and rebellion didn't say a word.
[time=2287] Now all of a sudden a voice steps up.
[time=2290] All of a sudden truth is beginning to percolate back toward the top.
[time=2295] All of a sudden somebody's saying something.
[time=2297] You ever been there?
[time=2298] You ever been over the edge?
[time=2299] Really cold, hard-hearted?
[time=2300] All of a sudden you start hearing stuff that begins to sound familiar and you go, "Whoa!"
[time=2307] You don't say much the first time, but the second time or third time it starts to...
[time=2312] Well now all of a sudden they've got something to say.
[time=2316] That's a good idea, they say.
[time=2322] I love how he sets the whole thing up.
[time=2325] Can I just tell you?
[time=2326] Maybe it's the...
[time=2328] I might be the athlete in me.
[time=2330] It could be the competitor.
[time=2331] I don't know.
[time=2332] I just love the way he sets the whole thing up.
[time=2334] You're going to do this.
[time=2335] I'm going to do that.
[time=2336] I've got to tell you.
[time=2337] It's made me think a little bit about the way I do what I do, the way I...
[time=2347] I mean the way I counsel people for instance.
[time=2351] I'm not saying I'm going to go here tomorrow, but I just got to tell you there's times when I read through this.
[time=2356] I go, "You know what I might be doing this all wrong because you know what I do?" Whether we're in a booth at a restaurant, whether we're in my office across the street, whether we're having some hallway conversation.
[time=2365] My tendency when I come across people who are thinking about doing this, who are thinking about going there.
[time=2371] See, I think it's my personality.
[time=2373] I think it's the way God wired me.
[time=2375] But what I do is I beg them not to.
[time=2379] I plead with them, not to.
[time=2382] I talk with them for hours.
[time=2385] I do everything within my power to meet with them, to speak with them, to write them.
[time=2389] I do whatever I can do.
[time=2390] Sometimes I literally, and I have.
[time=2393] I have literally at times gotten on my knees in meetings and begged, and I want to like hold on to their shirt and not let them leave.
[time=2403] Because I don't, you know what I mean?
[time=2407] And I don't think that's all wrong or all bad, but I read this and I think, "You know what, maybe I'm going to come at this a new way."
[time=2414] And maybe there's some truth to say, "Hey, you know what, you're thinking about doing that, huh?"
[time=2422] Okay, go do it.
[time=2426] You go do that, and I'll go do this.
[time=2432] Let me give you a camcorder to take with you.
[time=2436] I think these things sometimes.
[time=2438] I'll give you a camcorder, a little tape recorder, all right?
[time=2441] And I just, you go ahead and go.
[time=2443] And let's come back together in about two years, and you bring all your pictures.
[time=2447] And you bring all your footage.
[time=2450] And we'll see how it turns out.
[time=2454] It's part of me that likes the idea of him just saying to these folks, "Hey, you know what, enough's enough.
[time=2460] You're going to go chase bail, go chase him."
[time=2466] Somewhere in there, there's probably a good balance.
[time=2472] But somewhere in here, I sense God saying to you and to me, that comes a point when enough is enough.
[time=2482] I'm going to let you go chase.
[time=2484] I'm going to go let you, I'm going to let you go serve.
[time=2486] I'm going to let you go follow what you're going to go follow.
[time=2490] And I'll see you on the other side.
[time=2497] Well, now we come to verse 25.
[time=2501] And boy, I'll tell you folks, this thing is about to take off.
[time=2505] These next 20 verses or so are just amazing what begins to unfold.
[time=2512] And this would be if we were watching a movie, folks.
[time=2515] I mean, this would be, and I know we're kind of early into the deal here, but this would be like the beginning of the climactic scene.
[time=2521] I mean, this is it.
[time=2523] This is better than Waterloo. This is better than the okay corral.
[time=2527] This is better than anything you've ever seen, anything you've ever read.
[time=2532] This is the showdown of all showdowns.
[time=2535] And in verse 25, it begins.
[time=2537] But I want to do something here.
[time=2540] I was talking with a friend this week, and he had even written some things down and shared with me this concept.
[time=2547] And it really, really made sense to me.
[time=2550] And I want to try this with you.
[time=2552] And here we are at verse 25. This thing is about to absolutely explode.
[time=2556] I mean, the tensions building, the base, you know, is coming in, the music is kind of getting hot, and all of a sudden this thing is going to explode into this unbelievable scene of God answering the call.
[time=2568] But before we do that, it's kind of like a movie.
[time=2571] Maybe you've seen this before where you've been watching a movie.
[time=2574] Maybe you've been watching a television show.
[time=2577] And in the movie, again, somewhat early on, maybe you've seen it where at the beginning of this, what's obviously going to be a very climactic and very big and very significant scene, the director just kind of stops.
[time=2589] And all of a sudden, what was about to happen kind of goes to black, and then all of a sudden you realize he's taking you where.
[time=2598] He's taking you back.
[time=2601] And all of a sudden, now the scene's different.
[time=2604] Time might even be different. It could be two weeks prior. It could be two years prior.
[time=2608] But oftentimes, you'll see a director do that to kind of help you and I answer the question,
[time=2614] the question I want you and I to answer here, which is this, how in the world did we get here?
[time=2622] What happened?
[time=2624] What has transpired?
[time=2626] What has gone on that has led us to this point?
[time=2630] Because this is obviously going to happen. And this is obviously huge, bigger than anything we've ever seen.
[time=2636] But how in the world did we get here?
[time=2640] And so this morning, I want to invite you to kind of just take a step back.
[time=2644] We're going to go back to the prequel, if you will. We're going to go back a few years.
[time=2648] And I want to show you, through the pages of Scripture, what was done, what was chosen, what was said,
[time=2654] the direction that people went, that led us to this place in 1 Kings 18 and the greatest showdown of all.
[time=2662] And to do that, we've got to kind of go back to a guy named David.
[time=2670] At the beginning was this king who God loved and honored named David.
[time=2676] We see David's kingdom was blessed of God.
[time=2682] First and second Samuel, you can read through there and get that whole picture of how that developed.
[time=2687] David was a mighty king.
[time=2689] Finally, the nation of Israel had a true monarch that unified all the people under the one true God, Jehovah.
[time=2696] David hands the kingdom over to his beloved son Solomon.
[time=2701] And actually, when you look at, excuse me, when you look at 1 Kings, oh, chapters two, chapters three, a little bit of chapter four.
[time=2711] And you can write that down if you'd like.
[time=2713] When you look at 1 Kings, 2 and 3, you realize that Solomon really had a pretty good start.
[time=2719] He gets out of the gate with some strength and some resolve.
[time=2723] We see the blessing of God upon him.
[time=2725] We're told that Solomon showed his love for the Lord by walking according to the statutes of his father,
[time=2731] the statutes and ordinances of God.
[time=2733] We hear that God grants Solomon wisdom and we hear of his wisdom and how he was recognized throughout the world
[time=2741] as a discerning and wise leader, how he brought about some of the greatest prosperity the world had ever seen,
[time=2748] how he built a temple for God many years spent in the construction of this perfect temple that would be a beacon of light
[time=2756] representing the uniqueness and the power and the majesty of God, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
[time=2766] We see Solomon worshiping God.
[time=2769] And then in 1 Kings, chapter nine, you can turn there if you'd like, you can write that down.
[time=2774] In 1 Kings, chapter nine, we see that God appears to Solomon a second time.
[time=2780] It's following the dedication of the temple and God says to Solomon, "I have heard the prayer and plea you have made before me.
[time=2785] I have consecrated this temple which you have built by putting my name there forever.
[time=2790] My eyes and my heart will always be there as for you if you walk before me an integrity of heart
[time=2796] and uprightness as David your father did and do all that I command and observe my decrees and laws.
[time=2802] I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever as I promised David your father when I said you shall never fail
[time=2809] to have a man on the throne of Israel." Then God gives Solomon a solemn warning, "But if you or your sons turn away from me
[time=2818] if you forsake me and do not observe the commands and decrees I have given you and go off to serve other gods
[time=2826] and worship them, then I will cut off Israel from the land I have given them." And we'll reject this temple that I have consecrated from my name.
[time=2835] Israel will then become a byword. In other words unrecognizable and an object of ridicule among all peoples.
[time=2845] And you know what? If you take the time and I would encourage you to do so.
[time=2849] If you took the time this week to read through First Kings, as you continue through the narrative there,
[time=2855] you see that things went pretty well for Solomon.
[time=2859] His wisdom was renowned, his kingdom grew and prospered to unbelievable heights.
[time=2864] He maintained this worshipful spirit.
[time=2869] However, hang on here.
[time=2874] However, we do know that he married Pharaoh's daughter.
[time=2887] He married... he did all this, and he did all this really, really, really well.
[time=2896] But he married Pharaoh's daughter, just a little thing.
[time=2906] I mean, all this is huge.
[time=2910] All the wisdom and all the leadership and all the prosperity and all the blessing.
[time=2915] He's just a little... just a little thing right here.
[time=2920] He's married Pharaoh's daughter.
[time=2925] And in chapter 10 of First Kings, you can see it there in verse 23.
[time=2937] Watch this.
[time=2939] King Solomon was greater in riches and wisdom than all other kings on the earth.
[time=2944] The whole world.
[time=2947] Don't miss that.
[time=2950] How are you doing if you're Solomon?
[time=2954] The whole world sought an audience with Solomon.
[time=2962] To hear the wisdom God had put in his heart, year after year, everyone who came brought a gift, articles of silver, gold, robes, weapons, spices, horses and mules, probably women as well.
[time=2973] Solomon accumulated chariots and horses and had 1400 chariots and 12,000 horses,
[time=2981] which he kept in the chariot cities.
[time=2983] This thing was so big he had cities for chariots.
[time=2987] And he also kept them with him in Jerusalem.
[time=2989] The king made silver.
[time=2991] Mark that down.
[time=2992] We'll get back to that in a second.
[time=2993] The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones and cedar as plentiful as sycamore fig trees in the foothills.
[time=3002] Solomon's horses were imported from Egypt.
[time=3006] Make a note there.
[time=3007] Solomon's horses were imported from Egypt.
[time=3010] And from Q, the royal merchants purchased them from Q.
[time=3013] They imported a chariot from Egypt for 600 shekels of silver and a horse for 150.
[time=3019] They also exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and of the Oramians.
[time=3024] And it continues, chapter 11, verse 1.
[time=3026] King Solomon however loved many foreign women.
[time=3030] Besides Pharaoh's daughter, Moabite women, Ammonite women, Edomite women, Sedonians and Hittites.
[time=3039] It's just, remember it's just one little, it's just one little thing there.
[time=3046] It's just one little deal that never stays real.
[time=3053] Little does it.
[time=3058] They were from nations about from which the Lord had told the Israelites.
[time=3061] You must not intermarry with them because they will surely turn your hearts after their gods.
[time=3066] But we're told that Solomon held fast to them in love.
[time=3070] And he had, as the scriptures say, 700 wives of royal birth and 300 concubines.
[time=3080] His wives did indeed lead him astray as Solomon grew old.
[time=3084] His wives turned his heart after other gods and his heart was not fully devoted to the Lord,
[time=3090] his God, as the heart of David his father had been.
[time=3096] Interesting isn't it that David's described that way?
[time=3103] That's another, that's another message home.
[time=3108] He followed, man, this just gets mind-boggling. He followed Ashera.
[time=3113] That's the prostitute goddess there. He followed Ashera, the goddess of the Sedonians.
[time=3118] And Molak, it's the one you sacrificed your kids to.
[time=3123] This is Solomon.
[time=3128] It's just a little.
[time=3130] It's no big deal.
[time=3135] Molak, the detestable God of the Ammonites, we then read the sad commentary of verse 6 of chapter 11.
[time=3143] So Solomon did evil in the eyes of the Lord and did not follow the Lord completely as David his father had done.
[time=3158] See, it starts really very subtly, doesn't it?
[time=3165] And now I'm talking to you and me.
[time=3171] Now I'm not talking about Elijah, or excuse me, Solomon.
[time=3175] Now I'm just talking to you.
[time=3178] It starts very subtly, doesn't it?
[time=3182] And you know, here's the thing, it usually doesn't start subtly in an arena that we're not very, very, very aware of.
[time=3193] What typically starts so very subtly is so many times in an arena that we're very, very familiar with.
[time=3201] So many times, stories like these, stories like yours and stories like mine.
[time=3208] We're not dealing with things that we were ignorant to.
[time=3212] 95% of the time, it's not like we got caught off guard, if you know what I mean.
[time=3218] I'm the same is true here.
[time=3223] There was a law, this will boggle your mind.
[time=3228] The most veteran Bible scholar in this room, whoever you are, it's not me.
[time=3236] Your mind is about to get bottled.
[time=3239] And those of you who wouldn't consider yourself scholars like myself, I mean you're just going to be left shaking your head going,
[time=3245] "Oh my goodness, when I show you what I'm about to show you."
[time=3251] Solomon was very aware of a law that had been written in the book of Deuteronomy.
[time=3259] Solomon was the wisest man in the world, and there wasn't much that Solomon didn't know.
[time=3265] But if you want to bet that there was one thing that Solomon did know, I'll tell you what it was, Solomon knew the law.
[time=3274] Solomon would have known exactly what it said in Deuteronomy.
[time=3278] You see, Solomon would have been very, very familiar with what God had said in Deuteronomy.
[time=3285] And I'm going to read this for you.
[time=3287] In fact, I'm going to ask you to stand right now if you would, and we're going to close here.
[time=3291] I'm going to leave you hanging on the showdown, you're going to have to come back next week and catch the end of the most amazing scene you've ever seen.
[time=3301] But I want to just show you this.
[time=3303] In Deuteronomy, you see God provides the law.
[time=3307] In Deuteronomy, God gives people a direction to follow.
[time=3311] And He gives them direction in Deuteronomy in a number of different arenas of life.
[time=3316] One of the arenas that God addresses in Deuteronomy was how the king, because he knew the king would come, the earthly king that the people would want, he knew the king would come.
[time=3325] So in Deuteronomy 17, he begins to lay out what that king should do, how that king should live,
[time=3331] how that king should choose, what that king should value, what he should do and not do.
[time=3338] And if there was anybody on the face of the earth who knew Deuteronomy 17 at this time,
[time=3344] it would have been Solomon.
[time=3346] So with all that having been said, would you just direct your attention to the screen and let's read together what was written years and years and hundreds of years before
[time=3358] in preparation for a king.
[time=3360] Here we go.
[time=3361] Moreover, he shall not multiply, go ahead, say it, for himself.
[time=3368] Nor shall he cause the people to return to, go ahead, to multiply what?
[time=3373] Since the Lord has said to you, you shall never again return that way.
[time=3380] You've got to be kidding me.
[time=3381] He shall not multiply, go ahead, say it, for himself or else in his heart he will turn what?
[time=3388] Nor shall he greatly increase what?
[time=3393] He told him, he said, don't do this.
[time=3404] And it'll get so bad that I'll just tell you now hundreds of years before.
[time=3410] Don't do the horses.
[time=3413] Don't do the wives and don't do the silver.
[time=3416] And I know you and you know me pretty much.
[time=3424] And you and I have got to be very, very careful with our horses and our silver and our wives.
[time=3435] And so here we are, I'm near to you, you're near to me and we're in this together.
[time=3440] And we see in this story, in this look, and you know what folks, this is just the beginning
[time=3446] of the look back.
[time=3447] We've got a ways to go to finally get back to Mount Carmel and we'll get there next week.
[time=3453] But it's not pretty.
[time=3457] And Elijah said to Ahab, you have brought trouble because you have forsaken.
[time=3462] You have traded the Word of God.
[time=3468] Let's bow our heads and pray.
[time=3470] Father, as we consider this great truth, convicting truth, humbling truth.
[time=3476] And as each of us in this room, God realizes how very susceptible we are to those arenas
[time=3483] of our life that are not a mystery.
[time=3487] I mean we really see it pretty clearly and yet God just a little bit there or a little bit over here, God, and off we go down a road of compromise.
[time=3499] And we want to be a people God that can make a difference.
[time=3501] God, we want to be a people that would be holy and blameless.
[time=3504] God, we want to be a people that would be really truly surrendered and devoted to you
[time=3510] with all of our hearts, not part of our hearts or half of our hearts or just compartments of our hearts, God, we would long to be a people, men and women, moms and dads, leaders, truly
[time=3525] devoted to you.
[time=3526] And so God, take this truth and God with your spirit do a work in us in whatever needs to be done, God do it.
[time=3535] And we'll thank you for it and we'll look forward, if it be your will, to being back together again soon, and all the people agreed and said, "Hey, man."
