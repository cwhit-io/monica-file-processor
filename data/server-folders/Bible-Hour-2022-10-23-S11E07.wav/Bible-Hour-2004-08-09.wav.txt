[time=57] (upbeat music)
[time=87] - Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries and it is great to be with you again.
[time=92] It's been a couple of weeks since we've had the opportunity to talk with you like this.
[time=97] And so I've been looking forward to having a few minutes to share with you all some of the very exciting things that God is doing here, some of the things that I continue to along with this team here, things that we get to be a part of that we're so encouraged by.
[time=112] Number one, let me just tell you this.
[time=114] I am, today I'm wearing, as you can see, my Black Hawk Christian school t-shirt.
[time=119] I'm wearing it today just in celebration of the fact that in a week we will be back in session.
[time=125] School begins in just a few days and we will have close to a thousand students all over this campus from preschool all the way up through the new senior class of 2005.
[time=138] We are so looking forward to the life and the energy that all of those students bring.
[time=143] And I'm so thankful for Dr. Sam Barfel and his team, Tom Hopewell, Jeff Kowatch, Steve Wild, and all of the faculty and administration that make such an enormous deposit of truth and love into the lives of all of these students.
[time=159] We are so thankful for the school and its years and years and years of service.
[time=165] If you're interested at all in Black Hawk Christian school would like some information about our school, please visit the website.
[time=173] They're at the bottom of the screen.
[time=174] You can also call the phone number that's listed there.
[time=177] They would love to talk with you and help you in any way with your educational questions or needs.
[time=184] Let me also say this to you if I can.
[time=187] I was talking with folks just this past Sunday and I was having the same conversation with some people the week before and you know what?
[time=195] I have this conversation week after week, month after month, I am continually meeting people who come to our church and have the privilege and thrill of being exposed to what God is doing here and meeting the people here and I get to meet them and we talk and I say to them, how did you get here?
[time=216] And inevitably, like 95% of the time, the people that I'm meeting who are so thankful for the chance to be here are here because somebody asked them to come.
[time=229] May have been a co-worker, may have been a neighbor, may have been a family member, but people here are so excited about and so thankful for what they see God doing.
[time=236] They're asking others if they'd like to come and you know what, a lot of folks really would like to come and so I have just kind of made a commitment in my heart to periodically say to those of you who don't have church homes.
[time=251] Many of you have a place that you go and worship every week.
[time=254] You have a church family that you're a part of and our hope is that you would continue to go and be a part of that family.
[time=261] But we know that there are hundreds, probably thousands of you out there and you don't have a church home other than this.
[time=269] We're your church.
[time=271] Me and Mitchell and Steve, we're your teaching pastors.
[time=275] This is in essence your family here on the television screen and so I wanna just ask you this.
[time=281] With the beginning of a new ministry season, would you be willing to think about?
[time=285] Would you be willing to pray about coming and visiting, live and in person?
[time=290] I mean the TV's a pretty decent medium I know but you know what, there's nothing like being together and we would love to meet you.
[time=296] We would love to know your name.
[time=299] We would love to be able to fold you in to an amazing family, a band of Christ followers who were not perfect and we've still got a lot to learn but we couldn't think of anything better than to learn those things and grow in those ways with you.
[time=316] And so think about it.
[time=317] We would love to have you if you're in driving distance and you can make the trip nine o'clock, Sunday mornings and 10.45 on Sundays and then don't forget Wednesday evening, a great worship service that we call Common Ground.
[time=331] 6.45 to about eight led by Dr. Mitchell Cruz.
[time=335] Bottom line, we would love to see you transition from the television screen to live and in person and the opportunity and the privilege that would be ours of coming alongside you in your life.
[time=348] Take me up on it.
[time=349] We'd love to see you if you come make sure you come down front afterwards and say hello so I can greet you and we'll just pray about it and you do as well and we'll look forward to having you here soon.
[time=361] Have a great week.
[time=369] [MUSIC - 51 seconds]
[time=425] from wife's prescribed to find old bread. Jesus convinced my destiny. Don't power of hell no scheme of man. Can't ever cluck me from his hand. To his return, your calls be called.
[time=453] Here in the power of Christ, I'll stand. No power of hell no scheme of man. Can't ever cluck me from his hand.
[time=470] To his return, your calls be called. Here in the power of Christ, I'll stand.
[time=487] And if you would, please turn to 1 Kings chapter 18. We are going to jump right back in part two of the great showdown.
[time=495] As we said last week, I tell you, Waterloo, the okay corral, big homing. There isn't a battle. There isn't a showdown you've ever read about or seen that can hold a candle to what we see developing before our eyes in 1 Kings chapter 18.
[time=511] 1 Kings chapter 18. Let's just kind of reset the stage. Okay. And to do that, let's read verses 20 through 24. And in honor of God's word, would you stand with me this morning as we read?
[time=524] As I read and you follow along, the challenge has been set. The gauntlet laid down. Elijah has called the prophets of Baal and Ahab to Mount Carmel.
[time=536] And he wants to get this thing settled once and for all. We pick it up in verse 20. So Ahab sent a message among all the sons of Israel and brought the prophets together at Mount Carmel.
[time=546] Elijah came near to all the people and said, how long will you hesitate between two opinions? If the Lord is God, follow him. But if Baal inferred there is God, follow him.
[time=560] But the people did not answer him a word. Then Elijah said to the people, I alone am left a prophet of the Lord. We know that to be true because we know Jezebel has killed Ahab's wife, Ahab's zealous, insane wife has killed, has murdered all the prophets of God.
[time=580] He says, I alone, I alone am left a prophet of the Lord, but Baal's prophets are 450 men. Now let them give us two oxen and let them choose one ox for themselves and cut it up and place it on the wood, but put no fire under it.
[time=595] And I will prepare the other ox and lay it on the wood and I will not put a fire under it. Then you call on the name of your God.
[time=603] And I will call on the name of the Lord and the God who answers by fire, He is God. And all the people said that is a good idea.
[time=619] Would you pray with me Father as we come to this passage today? Our prayer is that we would be those of us that need to be. God that we would be convicted.
[time=630] God that hardened hearts might get softened a bit. God that wandering souls might begin to find their way home. God that students of your word who are desiring to grow deeper.
[time=643] In a more, in a fuller sense God gaining understanding of what your word says and what it means. God that that could transpire. God that every person in this room today.
[time=656] Whatever the need might be God that your word and your spirit that works through your word would do great things. Life transforming eternity altering things in us today.
[time=670] God we open our hearts and our eyes and our lives to it. And we pray God that we would be different today because of it. In your son's name we pray. Amen.
[time=682] You can be seated. So why is one man one singular prophet on top of a mountain getting ready to square off by himself against a compromised and desperate king 450 zealous prophets of Baal and the entire nation of Israel?
[time=700] This classic confrontation is about to explode and last week we decided to press pause. Last week right on the verge right on the cliff of this climactic scene we decided to step back like they often do in a movie.
[time=718] And we stepped back some sixty years to retrace the steps and the decisions of those who had led God's people down this current path of rebellious wandering and sin.
[time=729] At this moment of good versus evil at this moment of climactic confrontation we asked the question hey how did we get here?
[time=743] And in asking that question last week I thought about it during this week and I would say that chances are this morning there's somebody sitting in one of these seats and you might in your own life your life being what it is today.
[time=760] There may be somebody here in this room saying how in the world did I get here?
[time=771] Here maybe in this building or maybe here meaning the circumstance of your life but either way I would guess that there are probably some in the room this morning and you're asking how in the world has my life come to this.
[time=783] It is out of control. My sin and despair feel overwhelming sometimes suffocating the ripple effect of my rebellion is killing me, my family, my friends, my relationships are dwindling, my spirit is shrinking, my heart is hardening, how did this happen?
[time=804] Somebody in this room this morning is probably asking that very question and you know what last week as we searched the scriptures we found an answer for Israel.
[time=815] We were able to kind of through a study of the book of First Kings basically find out that for Israel the answer to how in the world did we get here unrecognizable as a nation lost in rebellion and sin on top of this mountain partnering
[time=833] with 450 wacko prophets of some false God we saw for them that the answer was found back at the beginning some 60 years before in a king named Solomon and won one very bad decision.
[time=859] In the face and in the midst of unbelievable blessing and prosperity in the midst of great blessing by God we see Solomon make one very bad decision because God had said again and again and again do not marry
[time=876] non God following God the God of Abraham Isaac and Jake do not marry non God following women don't marry from other nations.
[time=889] And he had said it to them again and again and again I want you to be a distinct and holy nation I want you to be a city on a hill I want you to be different.
[time=898] Don't intermarry on the spiritual front it's nothing against other races it's not against foreigners it was about the fact that they were God's people they were God followers and he says don't mess that up and Solomon
[time=914] Mary's Pharaoh's daughter that was his one deal what's yours you got one of those you got that one choice that you've made you got that one decision that you kind of caved into you have you got that one thing
[time=942] over here you see for Solomon in first Kings 10 and 11 we saw that that one wife turned into 700 wives and 300 concubines a thousand women that he gave himself to and called upon and and we saw also that horses were multiplied
[time=969] and purchased on trips back into Egypt and that silver was stockpiled and hoarded to the point where it was as the text said it was silver was as common as rocks
[time=982] so how had they slid so far off track you can write this down Deuteronomy 17 16 17 and 18 this is where we ended last week let's just be reminded how did they get there how had it gotten so bad
[time=998] well you know what hundreds of years before God had said in his word God had said when the king comes into office God knew this would happen here's what he's supposed to do and here's what he's not supposed to do he had laid it all out
[time=1011] moreover he shall not this king multiply horses for himself nor shall he cause the people to return to Egypt to multiply horses since the Lord has said to you you shall never again return that way
[time=1025] he shall not multiply wives for himself or else his heart will turn away nor shall he greatly increase silver and gold for himself we didn't go to 18 last week
[time=1038] but I was talking with one of our elders this week who pointed out the next verse and oh my goodness it just gets more sad it just gets kind of like more sad more discouraging
[time=1048] now it shall come about when he sits on the throne of his kingdom he shall write for himself a copy of this law on a scroll in the presence of the Levitical priests
[time=1064] he didn't just know it he he he wrote it the first day on the throne he got the pen and the scroll he wrote it on he wrote this out I will not do that I will not
[time=1076] and off he went here's something for you to write down how does it happen how did I get here how did they get there a personal neglect of scripture
[time=1088] will always lead to ruin people a personal neglect of God's word you and I neglecting to read it you and I neglecting to meditate on it you and I neglecting to sing it
[time=1100] you and I neglecting to listen to me you and I neglecting the word of God being absolutely dispensed absolutely inundated on us you and I neglecting this will always lead to ruin
[time=1118] of some form some kind some shape and I told you last week Solomon was just the beginning you know what it's true the ruin just continued following Solomon the deceit and sin and rebellion
[time=1132] the slide away from holy living was simply expedited and king after king after king does more and more evil in the side of God Jeroboam Raya Boam
[time=1146] Abajam Basha Omri the list goes on and on and Israel grows further and further away from their God and in time we come to this story we've come to here in this six week study in time we come to Ahab
[time=1161] and in light of what I just told you there in light of what we just saw you see Ahab takes on a whole new dark meaning because as bad as it had got as bad as it got with Solomon
[time=1177] the silver and the wives and the horses and the compromise and how we saw last week he had turned away from God it got worse with Jeroboam and worse with Raya Boam and worse than that with Abajam and then Basha comes along and oh my goodness all kinds of new evil and then we read
[time=1198] in our study here in first king 1630 what did we see a few weeks ago about Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the Lord more more than all who were before him
[time=1220] how had they slid so far well that progression that you and I just kind of made our way through tells us something we talked about three weeks ago you can write it down unchecked ungodliness
[time=1238] that's how you've gotten where you are whoever you are whatever that might be like whatever circumstance you find yourself in if you find yourself today sitting here in the depths of your heart going my goodness how did it get this dark
[time=1259] unchecked ungodliness personal neglect of scripture well guess what this unchecked ungodliness is about to get checked
[time=1273] and oh man he checks it he checks it big he really really checks it you ready you ready here we go hang on verse Kings 18 25 so Elijah said to the prophets of Baal choose one ox for yourselves and prepare it first
[time=1296] for you are many and call on the name of your God but put no fire under it then they took the ox which was given them and they prepared it and called on the name of Baal from morning which would have been about seven or eight until noon which would have been about one our time so to speak
[time=1312] and from seven in the morning for hours for four to five hours straight they say oh Baal all these prophets in one loud voice oh Baal answer us but there was no voice and no one answered and they leap they begin to jump about the altar which they had made
[time=1332] and it came about at noon that Elijah mocked them I'm always trying to help my kids you know learn how to not talk trash in competition now biblically it's okay so I'm realizing that there are times you know biblically where you can just look at the enemy and say what in the world are you
[time=1351] I think it's kind of funny myself but it came about it noon that Elijah mocked them and he said hey call out with a loud voice not that voice no no call out with a loud voice he says for he is a God either he is occupied or gone aside or is on a journey or perhaps he is asleep and needs to be awakened
[time=1378] I just I love this about Elijah see if it's me and I'm on Mount Carmel and it's 450 in the nation of Israel and a crazed king against me and I've let them go for I'm over behind my rock huddled with my head down I'll go oh God please get me through this
[time=1394] He's like up on top of his rock he's like right there he's going hey it's not working
[time=1406] yeah louder maybe he's just giving it to him so he talks some serious biblical trash and they cry since they cry verse 20 so they cried out with a loud voice and cut themselves according to their custom was swords and lances until the blood didn't trickle no it was gushing out on them
[time=1434] and when midday was passed they they raved they prophesied and wailed until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice
[time=1445] people it's nighttime it's five six o'clock they've been at it since seven they've been wailing and jumping and raving and prophesying and begging and screaming for their God
[time=1457] for hours and hours and hours but there was no voice no one answered and no one paid attention
[time=1467] Baal didn't answer the call and remember we said this last week in that video with me and my daughter
[time=1480] no miss this he never does people false gods never come through never they never get it done they never really meet the need they never bring the fullness satisfactions never found
[time=1503] and you know what I realized I realized today that there's most of you in this room don't have a little wooden grave an image that you've got on your little bed stand next to your bed that you light a little match to and say a little prayer to it's got little beads and some
[time=1517] hey why are coming most of you don't have that most of you don't have some kind of thing molded or shaped on your fireplace manel that your whole family bows down to because they worship a fall that doesn't happen a lot today
[time=1534] but I'll tell you I'll tell you what does happen a lot today is that we can begin to worship false gods little g three things there could be many three things just come to mind
[time=1552] possessions people pleasure you can write it down possessions people pleasure and see God said to them and God says to you and I love you I've given myself to you I want to live in relationship with you worship me
[time=1575] and yet so many times you and I and let me define worship for you okay you get a pen out write this down here you go you're worth you worship you worship what you ultimately prioritize don't miss that you worship what you ultimately prioritize
[time=1594] I can feel heads spinning right here in the room as I can feel your minds just kicking in you you see what I see you're struck by what I'm struck by when I say that see you worship you say when I worship God I go to no no no you worship what you ultimately prioritize you worship what you ultimately sacrifice for you worship what you desire
[time=1622] what do you desire more than anything you answer that and you answer the question what it is or who it is that you worship and to worship anything other than him it's called idolatry
[time=1644] possessions some think still after all the stories that have been told after all the situations gone awry after all the tragedies and things that we've witnessed some still think that you can own enough have enough make enough
[time=1664] and really really really in the end finally be full content satisfied some think that there is a person sometimes it can be a boyfriend sometimes it can be a girlfriend sometimes it can be a spouse sometimes we get to thinking that really all we need is him
[time=1683] little age all we need is her and we ultimately prioritize him or her we ultimately sacrifice we begin to worship people sometimes especially in this world it's pleasure
[time=1696] my goodness it's everywhere and in our quest for that which truly satisfied satisfies gods over here saying oh please oh please oh please come to me come and worship me come and live with me and over here
[time=1712] society and this current cultures is no no no no no that's so intangible that's so nebulous just click here just click here just buy this just go in that place and just just do that and be full
[time=1734] you most of you know and I certainly know that as we go down the possession or the people or the pleasure route one two three four years sometimes five six seven sometimes ten years sometimes my goodness twenty years later
[time=1751] we end up with just absolutely broken empty people who haven't found it not even close because we know all that to be a lie false gods never come through
[time=1771] let's go on to verse thirty then Elijah said then Elijah said to all the people come near to me you think after seeing all they had seen all day long they might have been interested you bet so all the people came near to him and he repaired the altar of the Lord which had been torn down obviously the text here
[time=1790] infers that there had been an altar at this spot originally dedicated to God a place originally at some time in days gone by where folks had gathered to worship the true God while he comes back to this place he repairs the altar of the Lord which had been torn down Elijah took twelve stones according to the
[time=1808] number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob to whom the word of the Lord had come saying Israel shall be your name so with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord and he made a trench watch this now
[time=1819] see he's getting bold I love this about him he's getting really bold and courageous he makes a trench around the altar large enough to hold two measures of seed then he arranged the wood and cut the ox in pieces and laid it on the wood just visually just see that
[time=1839] visually see him digging a trench and visually see him tearing this ox apart cutting it the way he would cut it and he said fill four pitchers with water and pour it on the burn offering and on the wood
[time=1856] and he said do it a second time and they did it a second time and he said do it a third time and they did it a third time and the water flowed around the altar and he also then came back and fills the trench around the altar
[time=1868] with water see he's not going to get to the other side of this deal and have anybody say oh you tricked us there was kind of a little mirror thing going on there no no no he's feeling it
[time=1885] and he knows deep in his heart that is God that he loves and has worshiped and has faithfully staked he knows he's going to show up and he wants to make sure that what he shows up to is the situation that only God could deal with
[time=1911] and at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice the Elijah the prophet came near and said oh Lord the God of Abraham Isaac and Israel today let it be known you are God in Israel and that I am your servant and I have done all these things that your word answer me oh Lord answer me that this people may know that you oh Lord are God and that you have turned there say it
[time=1940] people people what is it always about with God is it about your appearance answer me is it about your external activity not primarily no God has always been is and always will be concerned about your heart
[time=1963] about what's really going on in here and Elijah knew that and Elijah said God let him know that you are turning their hearts back again then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt offerings and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench
[time=1987] wow it's like bam one time as if God was saying I have been waiting for 60 years I have patiently watched your foolish destructive hearts at work I have patiently with a long suffering attitude watched you make a mockery of what I've given you and what I've called you to so boom right there
[time=2016] I say to you and I show to you and I declare to you that I am still God and these these these these things this stuff this garbage over here these these bleeding to death guys laying on the ground and this bit isn't
[time=2037] I am still God still unique all powerful and the only true God man I wish I could have seen it
[time=2058] the response when all the people saw it when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said the Lord he is God the Lord he is God that was the issue right
[time=2075] that was the issue right that that is still the issue right still the issue who's God who's big G and who's little G I mean really
[time=2094] and my mind just goes back to how this whole thing started hey he said hey come near remember
[time=2101] who are you going to follow remember why are you wavering how long will you hesitate between two opinions
[time=2113] and he goes through the whole challenge and they go through the whole setting up of the altar and you go through the whole day of these guys wailing and
[time=2120] dancing and cutting themselves and then Elijah comes and he praises prayer and boom and boom they're out
[time=2132] I mean just visualize it go ahead just for a second
[time=2138] can I talk down here I guess I can I mean I'm not I'm not even trying to make you laugh I just want you to see me down on my face
[time=2151] it's like it's it's this posture that that we hear him talk so much about and it's this posture that we see people who saw what they saw and experienced what they experienced
[time=2168] with the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob oftentimes it and in this case it just leaves them like they can't even look up they're just down on their face and they're going
[time=2180] whoa wait a minute the Lord is God and I'm reading that this week and I'm thinking oh my goodness I'm thinking what will it what will it take to get you on your face
[time=2206] of you in this room you you haven't you haven't admitted it yet
[time=2216] some in this room this morning you haven't you haven't said it you haven't believed it you haven't surrendered your heart and life to him see some of you and by virtue of that some of you in this room are bowing down to a little G
[time=2232] what what's it going to take for you whoever you are to put you on your face and admit that he is God
[time=2247] I know that if you're his and I know that if he's calling you to himself I know he will stop at nothing so my hope would be for you but this is all it would take
[time=2258] that this journey that you've traveled that these things that you've been learning that this truth that you've been digesting my hope is that you would today say you know what truly the Lord is God and I want to be his
[time=2275] others of you in the room you've admitted it there are many in the room and he did whatever he did in your life and you got down on your face so to speak or maybe you literally did and you admitted it
[time=2287] you gave yourself to him you declared what is true and right that he is God and you are not and I would just ask you today then are you then are you living like it
[time=2303] if you've already admitted that he's got are you living like it and I'll just use I'll just use this as an as an example and then this just let me do a little let me do a little hypothetical okay but I just in my mind this week I'm imagining say we get kind of transported back to the mountain
[time=2320] and we're on Carmel and we got to see this whole thing shake out we got to see the God of the universe show up we got to see God after 60 years of patience say boom here I am
[time=2336] then okay let's say right after that he looks at you and I and he says hey you know what I want you to do I want you to sing can we sing can we worship and we lift up praise let's sing God says to you and I on Mount Carmel after watching all that he just did well you know what I would do guess what I would do what would I do I would sing
[time=2364] oh my goodness I would sing do you know how I would sing I wouldn't sing like this
[time=2382] oh I would sing I would sing from the bottom of my heart unashamedly and unabashedly in praise and worship to my God if we were back there and he just did what he did and he said hey forget this thing let's serve
[time=2403] if he said let's serve what do you think I'd do I'd serve I'd go find a place to serve I'd go give myself I'd go invest truth I'd go deposit love something I would go and do whatever because I just look what I just saw look what I just got valid me look what just happened
[time=2425] the questions of life just got answered there's no more nebulousness there's no more lack of clarity no no no if he's gonna say sing I'm gonna sing if he's gonna say serve I'm gonna serve he says love I'm gonna go love
[time=2440] so you can kind of take my hypothesis my hypothetical deal there and go well yeah but we didn't do that well but you know what he didn't he's not blasting dead oxen on altars and blowing up stacks of wood today no he's not but you know what he's doing
[time=2462] still water today I was thinking this week what's like for me personally what would be a direct equal I wouldn't lose one ounce of power or clarity if I compare these if I took the altar on Mount Carmel and what God boom did right there
[time=2481] and what that reveal and evidence what would be a modern day thing for me that was just as powerful and just as cool and just as revealing of who he is and what he does and him being worthy of my praise come to the lake today and listen to over 40 stories of life transformation
[time=2505] amen there's nothing like it you go see and then it just comes back to the false God thing the false God thing doesn't produce that the false God thing doesn't produce what you and I are gonna hear today at 430 at that lake
[time=2523] he is a living God he is the true God he is the only God and as him and him alone the changes and transforms lives and when you and I see that when you and I experience that
[time=2535] oh my goodness you want me to sing I'll sing you want me to serve I'll serve you want me to love all love you want me to give I'll give
[time=2550] and by the way don't forget that when it was all said and done it rained
[time=2562] the rains came just like he said it would you can look at there in verse 41 now Elijah said to Ahab get go up I love it Elijah is now telling Ahab what to do
[time=2577] now Elijah said they have go up eat and drink for there is the sound of the roar of a heavy shower so Ahab went up to eat and drink but Elijah went up to the top of Carmel and he crouched down on the earth
[time=2589] and put his face between his knees he said to his servant go up now look toward the sea so he went up and looked and said there is nothing and he said go back seven times can you put yourself in Elijah's sandals
[time=2602] he's really hoping this thing's going to happen I forgot about verse 40 sorry when all the people fell on their faces and said the Lord he is God the Lord he is God then Elijah said to them sees the prophets I don't want to miss that
[time=2617] sees the prophets of Baal just like Deuteronomy 13 said Deuteronomy 13 as God lays out the law describes specifically what is to be done with a false prophet 2 Peter 2 12 talks about what is to be people false you don't want to be a false prophet
[time=2642] you don't want to say you represent God when you don't and Deuteronomy 13 under the law which is what these folks functioned under it was very clear kill him
[time=2655] Elijah said to them sees the prophets of Baal do not let one of them escape so they seized them and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishan and slew them there
[time=2669] He said to have go and he looks and it's not coming and he says go back seven times verse 44 it came about at the seventh time that he said behold a cloud as small as a man's hand is coming up from the sea and he said that's it go up
[time=2683] say to Ahab prepare your chariot and go down so that the heavy shower does not stop you in a little while the sky grew black with clouds and wind and there was a heavy shower
[time=2696] and Ahab rode and went to Jezreel then the hand of the Lord was on Elijah and he girded up his loins and out ran Ahab to Jezreel
[time=2709] I'm going to invite the band to come on back up and I want to just say to you one more time here this morning people
[time=2717] God, God wins God wins every time in the end God wins and what we've seen here today is one man who was willing
[time=2735] and God calls you and I to be willing to stand up and be a voice to stand up and live fully surrendered to stand up when compromised might be all around you
[time=2746] the slide may be happening right before your eyes towards what is wrong and untrue God says you and I are to stand
[time=2756] and to be a voice of what is true and right and to trust him that at the right time and at the right place in just the right setting he's going to show up
[time=2769] and show up he did and in showing up folks we get just affirmed all over again that our God is an awesome God that our God is real that our God is true
[time=2782] and so it gives us the opportunity today to stand and proclaim to sing like he would want you to sing to from the depths of your heart offer him worship and spirit and in truth
[time=2795] and so we're going to do that I'll come up and close this one we're done but please respond to your God in a way that would evidence your gratitude that he's the God who in the end wins

[time=3019] and together we sing

[time=3121] praise the Lord oh my soul forever, magnify your great name forever Lord praise the Lord oh my soul
[time=3150] forever, forever, magnify your great name forever
[time=3169] and let me just say this to you before I let you go forever he has been faithful and he will be but I gotta say this to you on this side all right on this side of it all on this side of heaven
[time=3190] there's going to come a point when it's going to be over see if you go back to Genesis at the very beginning you will see in those first few chapters gradual hardening of hearts and increased compromise
[time=3208] and the compromise and the hardening of hearts goes on and on and on and he is patient he is patient he is patient and then in Genesis 6 there's this thing called the flood and he says that's it
[time=3224] and he destroys it all except for a faithful family floated on a boat really happened and then he says now let's get going and let's be the people I've called you to be
[time=3236] let's be distinct and holy let's be a light to nations that are watching and so off they go and hearts get hardened and compromised and creases and then it's just this pattern
[time=3252] and every once in a while you know his patience it just kind of wanes and whether it's Ahab and Elijah on Mount Carmel and boom after 60 years you can go back to Exodus and the wandering and the wilderness and the complaining and the complaining
[time=3269] and finally they're the ground opens up and boom swallows them and it's like there's just this pattern then on and on later in the story Assyria comes and takes the nation captive
[time=3281] God says when are you going to get it right and I've been patient well now here comes Assyria and boom take it into captivity torture beat and murder and then they get out
[time=3295] and says come on let's go and hardened hearts and compromised sets in and Babylon comes and boom captivity
[time=3307] then he's quiet for a while towards the end of the Old Testament and then in the intertestamental period there's about a 400 year gap there where we don't hear much but then oh boy does he show up in the form of a baby
[time=3321] he comes he shows up he says okay here we go I'm gonna give you life and I'm gonna give you forgiveness I'm gonna give you a hope
[time=3331] and he came as a baby and he grew and he preached what was true and right and he was murdered and he died and he rose again to give you an eye those who would have faith a relationship with him and then he said this is really important
[time=3347] and then he said I'll come back one more time one more time and I'll be patient and I'll be along suffering and I'll keep working with it but hey this is it
[time=3369] and Jesus himself by his own words we know that we are in the last days and he's gonna come back one last time and that's it
[time=3383] so I don't know what it's gonna take for you to get on your face and admit that he is God and you're not but I certainly want to give you the opportunity so would you bow your heads and let me just pray this prayer
[time=3398] and if you feel led in your heart to just voice these words in your own spirit to him proclaim this to be what is true about what you're wanting to communicate and say to him today then God's Word says you can enter into that relationship
[time=3413] with him if you would just say quietly privately in your own heart oh God I know that I am a sinner I know that my sin separates me from you and oh God I want to today say thank you for the gift
[time=3433] for the sacrifice of your son who came and lived and died and rose again so that I could have life and forgiveness and oh God I get on my face today
[time=3448] and I admit that you are God and I am in desperate need not only of your forgiveness but God your Lordship you are leading in my life and so God today
[time=3464] August 15 2004 I fully surrender my heart and life to you and I trust God that you will grow me I trust God that you will hold on to me and that you will someday bring me home
[time=3484] and God for the others in the room today who have prayed that prayer said those things communicated that truth to you the others here who are fully surrendered and know you God I pray that today we will leave this place encouraged
[time=3500] because in the end we're on the right side as we stand with Elijah and wait on a true and living God God thank you for this time we are so grateful for the privilege of worship
[time=3512] for the honor of being able to open up your word and God we pray that you would go with us from this place give us courage to be the people you've called us to be to live like those who have seen and experienced you
[time=3526] powerful mighty God that you are and if you prayed that prayer today if you're here today and you fully surrendered your heart and life to him let us know
[time=3538] write us a note come down front tell the friend you came with father we love what you do we look forward to celebrating new life today at the lake be with us as we go and they all agreed wholeheartedly and said amen
