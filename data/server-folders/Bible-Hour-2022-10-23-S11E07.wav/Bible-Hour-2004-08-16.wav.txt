[time=30] [MUSIC - 240 seconds]
[time=300] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries, and I was with a friend this last week, and we were talking about the things we enjoy in life and the things we enjoy about ministry.
[time=327] And this friend of mine asked me a very pointed question, he said to me, he said, Kelly, he said, what do you enjoy most about what you get to do in your life?
[time=338] We had already talked about family, and so he was kind of asking me to speak specifically to the things I have the privilege of being involved in on the ministry front.
[time=349] What do I enjoy most about the ministry opportunities I get, and I don't have to think about that very long.
[time=358] I mean, my answer to that's really quick, the thing I enjoy most and the thing I am so grateful for that God allows me and so many others around here to be a part of on a regular basis is we get to see people's lives changed.
[time=374] And I don't know if that sounds significant to you, I don't know if as you hear me say that, I don't know how that impacts you, I would hope that in your life, as well as mine, that a changed life, a transformed heart.
[time=392] I mean, a soul, a whole person who was here at one point, and now because of the transforming work of God, they have come to a place of full surrender, they have come to know Him personally, they have come to a life that now has hope and promise and forgiveness and people.
[time=410] I'm just telling you that the chance to be a part of that is the most amazing thing you can ever witness.
[time=418] And I tell you what, there was maybe three or four weeks ago, this came to the forefront again, I mean, I got to experience it firsthand, we were concluding a service and giving folks the chance to come down and just pray.
[time=433] Whatever the need might be, whatever the circumstance might be that they were facing, we just said, "Wonnie, you come down and let us pray with you."
[time=441] Well, this gal, she comes out of her seat, she walks right down the aisle, comes right to him, he sticks her hand out, shakes my hand and says, "Pastor Kelly, I just want to meet you, I want to say thank you, and I want you to know what a difference this place has made in my life."
[time=456] I said, "Well, tell me about that." She said, "Well, the long and short of it is this." It was about three years ago, she said, "When we started me and my kids began to watch the Bible hour. We were in a situation where we weren't able to go to church and so we watched the Bible hour, you all became our church."
[time=475] She said, "It was several months ago that my husband came home and told me that he didn't want to be married to me anymore, didn't want to be with our kids, wanted to be gone."
[time=486] And he left, he left me and he left my kids and we found ourselves absolutely alone, nowhere to go, no one to really confide in.
[time=496] And she says, "I just want you to know how much it's meant to us that we have you all at Blackhawk."
[time=502] And I said, "Wow, you have no idea how much that means. Thank you for sharing that with us."
[time=508] And I kind of thought that was the end of the conversation.
[time=510] She mentioned that she lived out of town, she watched the Bible hour in a location that was a good 45 minutes to an hour outside of Fort Wayne.
[time=519] And so I was almost ready to say goodbye to her and she says, "Well, but I also want you to know that we're here now. We moved to Fort Wayne."
[time=526] She said, "Just a few weeks ago and it's so good to be here, so good to have a new home, so nice to be meeting new people."
[time=532] And I said, "You moved to Fort Wayne." She said, "Yeah." I said, "Why? What brought you here?"
[time=539] And she looked at me kind of incredulously, kind of like baffled by my question.
[time=544] She said, "Why? Well, we came here because of you all, because of Blackhawk, because of this place. We didn't know where else to go."
[time=553] And I was just absolutely, again, amazed. I suppose maybe I shouldn't have been.
[time=561] Maybe you think after you see God do what he does so many times, you stop being amazed, but I just keep finding myself amazed at what he does.
[time=569] And how he brought this gal and her two kids, he found her a job here in Fort Wayne.
[time=574] And they came, found a place to live, and now they're a part of this family in the process of being connected to this place and its people and its ministry.
[time=584] And I am so grateful that we get to do what we do. And we would love to come alongside you in whatever way we can.
[time=591] Would you let us know? Email me at the email address you see there at the bottom of the screen.
[time=596] If there's things we can pray for, let us pray for you. If there's things that we can do specifically, let us try.
[time=601] If you'd like to come on and meet us on a Sunday morning live and in person, we'd love to have you here.
[time=606] We are so thankful for the ministry God gives us through the broadcast and so thankful for your ongoing support.
[time=613] Have a great week. We'll see you soon.

[time=908] [MUSIC - 10 seconds]
[time=923] - It's nice to know you're his, amen?
[time=927] And at day and age where so many struggle so deeply with trust and being loved and that loved staying consistent and secure it is a wonderful thing to celebrate.
[time=941] And what a way to start out our morning and what a privilege it is for us to come back to not only the word of God, but our study of Elijah.
[time=951] We have been for the last five, six weeks studying the life of and the ministry of Elijah, the Tishbite, who we met back a few chapters ago.
[time=959] But today we come to First Kings 19.
[time=962] And what a privilege it is to be there.
[time=965] Would you open your Bibles and just join me there at First Kings 19.
[time=970] And before we get going, let me just say this.
[time=972] This morning's message, our time together this morning, our look into the word of God, I think has great application for everyone.
[time=981] I was reminded of this in a conversation.
[time=984] I don't think I overheard it.
[time=986] I think I was just around it.
[time=988] I will forget exactly where I was.
[time=990] But somebody mentioned to somebody else that so-and-so had control issues.
[time=997] Somebody was being described as a person who has control issues.
[time=1001] And I thought, you know, it's an interesting thing that we've done with this word control.
[time=1005] We've made like a whole segment of people who have control issues as my thought was, I wanted to interject, but I didn't, you know.
[time=1012] And it was like, and you have what kind of issues?
[time=1017] People remember that at the root of Adam and Eve taking the fruit and eating it was the issue of what?
[time=1026] Control.
[time=1028] At the very root of your sin and mind is this thought.
[time=1031] And it's been this way since the garden.
[time=1033] At the very root of it all.
[time=1034] And it really plays into what we look at here today.
[time=1037] The very root of it all is the idea.
[time=1040] It's the question, who is going to be in control of your life?
[time=1044] Who is going to ultimately lead and guide?
[time=1046] Who is it that's going to really call the shots?
[time=1051] Who's going to unfold at all?
[time=1052] I mean, who's going to be the one running point?
[time=1056] Is it going to be you?
[time=1058] Or is it going to be him?
[time=1061] And so understand this morning that I speak to a room full of control freaks.
[time=1065] We're all in that boat.
[time=1067] It might look a little different with you than it does with me.
[time=1071] But control the willingness or the unwillingness to take the issues
[time=1077] of our life and kind of open up our hands and say there, you take it.
[time=1084] Or the tendency in you or I to kind of close those fists and hold these things to ourselves.
[time=1091] This is something I would hope and want every one of you to consider this morning.
[time=1096] And this morning is going to kind of unfold like this.
[time=1098] I want to talk to you from First Kings a little bit about initially what it is that sparks so much of the control issues that
[time=1109] you and I wrestle with.
[time=1111] And when you break it down, what really rests at the root of these issues is a thing called expectations.
[time=1119] Our expectations.
[time=1120] And I want to show you here in First King.
[time=1122] It's amazing.
[time=1123] In First Kings 18, which is where we were last week, at the end of First Kings 18, you and I get a really clear look into the expectations that Elijah possessed.
[time=1137] And his expectations, I don't think would be a whole lot different than your expectations would be or my expectations would be in this given circumstance.
[time=1146] Let's look at our expectations.
[time=1148] Let's look at Elijah's expectations.
[time=1150] Go back to First Kings 18.
[time=1152] We'll pick it up in verse 36.
[time=1154] At the time of the offering, this is where we were last week of the evening sacrifice, Elijah the prophet came near and said, "Oh Lord, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, today let it be known that you are God and Israel and that I am your servant and I have done all these things at your word.
[time=1171] Answer me, O Lord.
[time=1172] Answer me that this people may know that you, O Lord, are God and that you have turned their heart back again than the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt offering and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench and when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces and they said, "The Lord, He is God.
[time=1193] The Lord, He is God." And Elijah's got to be thinking to himself.
[time=1198] Elijah's got to be feeling inside.
[time=1200] Now, this is more like it.
[time=1205] I mean, this has been a long road.
[time=1207] This has been 50 to 60 years of rebellion and sin and wandering.
[time=1212] Now, he's got to be thinking inside.
[time=1214] This is what I'm talking about.
[time=1220] And Elijah said to them, "Seize the prophets of Baal.
[time=1223] Do not let one of them escape, so they seize them." And Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishan and he slew them there.
[time=1232] See, Elijah, you got to understand Elijah comes to this moment.
[time=1236] I mean, not only the great showdown on Mount Carmel, but these hours, these moments following when God had shown up, you got to realize where the guy has been.
[time=1246] You got to realize what he has experienced.
[time=1248] You have to realize this role that God had called him to.
[time=1251] And his great genuine love for the kingdom of God, for the people of Israel and his desire to see them come all the way back.
[time=1261] And he's got to be feeling at this point in time that this thing is really, really going well.
[time=1267] And after all Ahab was there, Ahab saw it.
[time=1271] The rain comes and they race down the mountain.
[time=1275] I would guess expectations in full bloom for a complete and total victory.
[time=1282] You have them just like he had them and I've got them as well.
[time=1286] We expect things.
[time=1288] We would hope for things.
[time=1290] We would almost sometimes even assume things.
[time=1293] I mean, because God is who God is and because of the way he's made us and because of this life that we live, there's just times where we just expect that this would happen.
[time=1302] We have expectations of judgment or justice to come to those who would violate God's law.
[time=1308] We have expectations of health and happiness, healthy kids and healthy lives and positive test results.
[time=1318] We expect blessing from God as we pursue him faithfully or somewhat faithfully, you know?
[time=1325] We expect financial blessing and relational blessing.
[time=1328] We begin to expect and count on employment and the security that employment brings.
[time=1333] We expect fidelity from our spouse.
[time=1336] We sometimes begin to even expect ministry success.
[time=1343] We begin to deep down in our hearts even as parents expect.
[time=1347] The kids will grow up to honor and follow God because we did this and we did that and we taught them this and we modeled that and we even expect safety on an evening trip to the grocery store.
[time=1364] Well, people, guess what?
[time=1366] Our expectations, and I know this isn't news to anybody,
[time=1372] but let's just go ahead and say it like this.
[time=1374] Our expectations and Elijah's expectations.
[time=1380] They oftentimes meet up with God's reality.
[time=1386] You see, expectation oftentimes bumps into God's reality.
[time=1391] And I'm telling you God's reality for our friend Elijah, it was quite different.
[time=1398] And I'm sure, I'm sure what he had been anticipating.
[time=1404] Look at 1 Kings 19 verses 1 and 2, here we see the intersection between great expectations on Elijah's part and the reality that God in his providence decides to unfold.
[time=1419] And let's read it together.
[time=1420] Would you stand with me in honor of God's Word and can we together 1 Kings 19 verses 1 to 2 all read and you follow along.
[time=1429] It says, now Ahab told Jezebel, all that Elijah had done.
[time=1434] Stop there just to point it out.
[time=1436] I know it's somewhat obvious, but just be reminded today, she didn't show up at Mount Carmel.
[time=1442] For whatever reason, we're never told Jezebel is a no show at the great showdown.
[time=1448] Ahab goes, the 450 prophets of Baal go, the 400 prophets of Bachera though and Jezebel, they stay back at the palace.
[time=1457] So here comes Ahab down the hill, the rain has come, the 450 prophets of Baal are dead, laying there in the brook Kishan.
[time=1468] And now Ahab told Jezebel, all that Elijah had done and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword, then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah saying, so may the gods do to me.
[time=1480] And even more, if I do not make your life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time, hey Elijah, you know what?
[time=1488] I'm going to kill you.
[time=1496] How much is going, wait a minute.
[time=1499] You've got to be kidding me.
[time=1502] She's going to, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[time=1505] God, God, wait, time out.
[time=1510] They wandered from you, they rebelled in their sin, they tore down your altars, they did the Baal thing, they put up the ash repoles, you call me, I do what you ask, I confront them.
[time=1521] There's no rain, we go through this whole journey.
[time=1523] I invited them out of Carmel, they all come, I stand on the rock, I talk trash to the prophets.
[time=1530] The oxen gets cut up, the altar gets built, boom, you come down.
[time=1534] I mean this thing's happening.
[time=1537] I mean we're almost there.
[time=1543] She's going to kill me.
[time=1553] And maybe to some degree you understand today, that tension, the confusion and the heartache that comes when your expectation of how this thing should go doesn't match up with God's unfolding reality.
[time=1572] Father, we stand before you this morning wanting to see interest at God in our hearts, wanting to know what it is you have for us this morning, what it is your word would teach us, show us some in the room for the very first time, others got a timely reminder of maybe a truth forgotten.
[time=1591] But God either way we are so grateful for this opportunity.
[time=1595] Would your spirit please, O God, and your word, please O God, just sink deep into our thoughts and our minds God renewing us, transforming us and changing us like it always does.
[time=1609] In your son's name we pray, amen.
[time=1612] You can be seated.
[time=1615] Expectation, meeting up against God's reality.
[time=1619] Sometimes you must have been feeling it pretty deep.
[time=1622] And you know when you look at the scriptures you realize there are other situations, there are story after story of situations where human expectation, not even that the expectation is wrong, but just kind of what you or I or individuals would be thinking or planning for or looking toward.
[time=1639] There are story after story of how expectations meet up against an unfolding providential reality that sometimes is so very different.
[time=1649] You can't help but think of Job.
[time=1651] In Job chapter 1 this won't be on the screen.
[time=1654] You can turn there if you'd like.
[time=1656] The book of Job comes just before the book of Psalms.
[time=1661] And we see in Job chapter 1 an amazing collision between expectation and God's reality.
[time=1667] You think Elijah was feeling a bit confused.
[time=1670] Do you think Elijah was feeling like, oh my goodness God, wait a minute, we were almost there.
[time=1674] What are you doing?
[time=1675] Job it says in chapter 1 verse 13 it says now on the day when his sons, Job's sons and his daughters, Job's a good man.
[time=1682] Job loves God.
[time=1684] Job has followed God faithfully.
[time=1687] But you see the enemy Satan believes he can get Job to turn against God and so what God allows to unfold, not what God authors, but what God allows to unfold.
[time=1697] God's reality intersects here with Job's expectations.
[time=1704] Now on the day when his sons and his daughters, verse 13, chapter 1.
[time=1709] We're eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house.
[time=1712] A messenger came to Job and said the oxen were plowing and the donkey speeding beside them and the Sabaeans attacked and took them.
[time=1719] They also slew the servants with the edge of the sword and I alone have escaped to tell you.
[time=1725] While he was still speaking another also came and said the fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them and I alone have escaped to tell you and while he was still speaking another also came and said the Chaldeans.
[time=1740] We're talking about a matter of minutes here.
[time=1742] Here's number three coming.
[time=1744] The Chaldeans formed three bands, Job and made a raid on the camels and took them and slew the servants with the edge of the sword and I alone have escaped to tell you.
[time=1755] Everything he owned was now gone but there's one more message to them while he was still speaking another also came and said your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house and behold a great wind came from across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house and it fell on the young people and they died.
[time=1777] And I alone have escaped to tell you.
[time=1785] You see God's reality and he's a good God.
[time=1789] He's not a bad God.
[time=1791] He understands things and sees things and orchestrates things and brings things to pass that you and I have no idea.
[time=1798] We have no clue.
[time=1799] We have no understanding of how it all comes together but in that day to day of life you see this reality begins to be unfolded.
[time=1808] And I'll tell you what in this case with our friend Elijah back in 1 Kings 19 it's safe to say Jezebel's not on her face.
[time=1818] Declaring the greatness of God.
[time=1820] Jezebel's heart has not softened.
[time=1822] Her spirit has not turned.
[time=1826] And so guess how that impacts Elijah.
[time=1830] Our expectation impacts Elijah the same way it impacts you and I so many times.
[time=1835] Our expectation in God's reality so many times brings about our disappointment.
[time=1840] You can write that down.
[time=1842] Our disappointment.
[time=1845] I want you to look at what it says in 1 Kings 19 3 it says and he was afraid and arose and ran for his life and came to Beersheba
[time=1856] which belongs to Judah and left his servant there but he himself when a day's journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a juniper tree and he requested for himself that he might die and said it is enough now oh Lord take my life for I am not
[time=1874] better than my fathers.
[time=1876] This is the same guy who just a little while ago is standing on a rock taking on an entire army of bail prophets ready to kill
[time=1887] them single-handedly with his own sword.
[time=1891] Same guy who stood there on that mountain and witnessed the miracle and the power of God.
[time=1896] Same guy who was used of God to absolutely begin to turn the tide in a stream that had gone really, really, really wrong.
[time=1909] The guy had been used mightily.
[time=1911] Now he's running for his life under a bush asking God to take
[time=1917] his life.
[time=1919] And I want to just say something about this word afraid and he was afraid.
[time=1925] A friend of mine this week invited me to do some study on that word to look it up with respect to the original word there used in the Hebrew its meanings its usages and it's very, I think it's a very good study for all of us to just be mindful of.
[time=1940] Please understand that the word afraid there in the Hebrew probably in this case would be better said or better translated
[time=1951] deeply, deeply disappointed.
[time=1956] Some might want to use the word depressed.
[time=1959] The idea in the Hebrew when I looked up the word it talked about a heaviness, a heaviness of heart that comes with or is connected to great disappointment personally.
[time=1972] And it really makes sense.
[time=1975] Can you imagine how disappointed can you imagine how discouraged can you imagine how depressed this guy must have been I mean in his mind's eye according to him Elijah I mean we almost made it.
[time=1990] But God now you're doing this thing with Jezebel and now she's going to kill me so you know what I quit.
[time=1998] I'm not going to get up today.
[time=2001] I'm sleeping in our disappointment.
[time=2009] I mean I don't get it God.
[time=2012] They wandered, they sinned, they rebelled, they tore down your altars.
[time=2016] I did my part.
[time=2017] I fought the prophets.
[time=2018] You showed up.
[time=2019] The whole nation's going oh my goodness God is God.
[time=2023] All I needed.
[time=2025] All I need here God from you is this crazy woman to repent and
[time=2033] we're home free but no no no she's going to kill me.
[time=2040] You know who it reminds me of?
[time=2044] I mean aside from myself at times you know who it reminds me of Jonah.
[time=2050] Remember the story of Jonah some of you probably do others of you maybe going Jonah who Jonah was a prophet that God called to deliver a message of repentance and salvation to a city called Nineveh.
[time=2066] And see God wanted Nineveh.
[time=2068] God had a heart for these folks in Nineveh who had wandered really really far away sound familiar and so he sends Jonah says Jonah I want you to go to Nineveh and preach and Jonah doesn't want to go to Nineveh.
[time=2080] See Jonah like you and I struggled with control.
[time=2083] Jonah wanted to do with his life what Jonah wanted to do.
[time=2087] And Jonah didn't like the people in Nineveh because the people in Nineveh were really really evil.
[time=2092] They were really really against God.
[time=2094] They had wandered really really far away.
[time=2098] And Jonah and his righteous indignation he wanted them to pay so he doesn't want to go to Nineveh so he goes to Tarshish.
[time=2106] Jonah boat and God says I see you.
[time=2112] And God brings the storm and the guys on the boat they kind of freak out and they find him and they go who are you and he goes this is all my fault and they go great they toss him over the side and the storm subsides and the big fish comes and swallows him up and he ends up down in the belly of the big fish with all the other things that are in the belly of the big fish going man this is not good.
[time=2135] And God I should have done what you call me to do so he gets on his knees in the belly of the fish and says oh God please forgive me and I'll go and the fish burps him up out on the shore.
[time=2148] There's people sitting in here this morning right now hearing this for the first time going come on show me show me it's actually in Jonah it's an amazing story and he goes to Nineveh right and he preaches in Nineveh he declares the truth in Nineveh and Nineveh repents and the king repents and I mean
[time=2169] it's wholesale revival I mean the whole place just falls on their knees and God's plan unfolds and what God wanted in
[time=2179] the end happens and Jonah's not happy because it wasn't what Jonah wanted and we pick it up and Jonah 4 be on the screen there Jonah 4 verse 1 but it greatly displeased Jonah and he became angry Jonah had his expectations you ever you ever
[time=2198] had any Jonah had his expectations God had his unfolding
[time=2205] reality what was going to happen and when the two met Jonah
[time=2211] didn't like it really really disappointed pretty pretty depressed says he became angry in verse 2 it says he prayed to the Lord and said please Lord was not this what I said while I was still in my own country therefore in order to forestall this I fled to Tarshish for I knew that you are a gracious and compassionate God slow to anger and abundant in loving kindness and one who relents concerning calamity therefore now oh Lord please take my life from me for death is better to me than life leave it there look at that last line for death you hear what he's saying there I'd rather hold
[time=2255] on to my agenda I'd rather hold on to my expectation I would
[time=2262] rather hold on to my demand that my life looked like this that this happened and that happened and this come I would rather do that he says I'd rather die than follow and trust
[time=2277] you then he goes on in verse 4 the Lord said hey by the way you
[time=2285] have good reason to be angry answer answer no I mean when we get
[time=2301] right down to it do you and I ever have any really good reason to be angry at the unfolding reality of God's sovereignty answer
[time=2315] no well this is where it gets really really interesting I mean
[time=2326] waiting all week to get to this point right here our expectation Elijah's expectation expectation so oftentimes meet up against God's reality when God's reality begins to be played out so many times our response to that is this great sense of disappointment oh God where are you oh God why are you doing this oh God no no no not that God's great love for you and I and his great love and commitment to
[time=2359] Elijah you know it like it compels him to just keep working with us and it compels him to keep it through a process normally kind of revealing what it is he's doing what it is he's up to
[time=2373] write this down number four God's provision through God's plan in God's time our expectation God's reality the disappointment that sometimes comes leads us so many times to a realization of how small we are and how big he is and how
[time=2391] we should have we should have really just kept our mouth shot and kept following you see God's provision through God's plan in God's time come with me to the text look at 1 Kings 19 we're going to pick it up in verse 7 he laid down there go to 5 he laid down and slept under a juniper tree and behold there was an angel touching him and the angel said to him arise and eat God's providing physical nourishment there then he looked and behold there was at his head a bread cake baked on hot stones in a jar of water so he ate and drank and laid down again the angel for 7 the angel of the Lord came again a second time and touched him and said arise eat because the journey is too great for you it's going on a journey you know where he's going this is really really amazing so he arose and ate and drank and went in the strength of that food 40 days and 40 nights to Horeb the mountain of God Horeb otherwise known as Mount Sinai hey folks this is big you realize as I mean if you just go back through here you know if you go back through what's already happened at this point there's one there's one guy and only one guy so far who got the invite to Mount Sinai God's holy mountain that guy was who Moses so now our friend Elijah finds himself an amazing company and God leads him through the desert 40 that sound familiar 40 days and 40 nights and he brings him to Sinai God's holy mountain then he came there verse 9 then he came there to a cave and lodged there and behold the word of the Lord came to him and he said to him what are you doing here Elijah now I want to make sure you understand as you read that again as you study that in the original text as you look into not only the hammer but even how the sentence is structured when you really take a close look at this which it's important to do I want to kind of say to you how this more than likely sounded because this was not a question of anger Elijah what are you doing here wasn't that no and it wasn't and it wasn't a question of surprise it wasn't like Elijah what are you doing here alright it wasn't that you know what it was like it was like I don't know if you can identify with this but I can remember my dad sometimes asking me a question and I knew he knew the answer does that make sense kind of a Elijah tell me something why are you here like he knew the answer or like he really knew what he hoped he would hear and here's this God here's this thankful God who loves this guy struggling I mean this guy is deep in the darkness he's really really struggling and so God goes to great lengths to bring him to himself on his mountain and he says Elijah why are you here and here we see Elijah's heart here we see you know what if the white knuckle grip you know is control and if the open hand is okay I give God you take over well what we got here folks is a really really white set of knuckles because I'm going to read this to you now his response I'm going to read it to you and I'm going to stay consistent in my voice with how the Hebrew would actually read God says to him hey Elijah my friend why are you here Elijah says I'll tell you why I'm here you know why I'm here I have been very zealous for the Lord the God of hosts for the sons of Israel have forsaken your covenant torn down your altars and killed your prophets with the sword and I alone am left and they seek my life now to take it away I mean he's you with me it's like what's going on God I mean I did my part I stood and did what you asked me to do and it's not unfolding the way I would have anticipated so you want to know why I'm here I'm here because I did all this stuff and it's still not like I want it and I'm discouraged and I'm confused the God says okay all right let's do it this way he said go forth verse 11 he said go forth and stand on the mountain don't don't miss this now stand on the mountain before who before the Lord in the midst of his depression in the midst of his discouragement in the midst of a white knuckle approach that is not to date at least at this point I mean we're not letting go yet God's gonna offer him his presence God's gonna say in essence no matter what's been going down no matter the confusion you might be feeling no matter how dark it's gotten you know what I want you to come out here and stand before me and behold the Lord was passing the Lord was passing by and a great and strong wind was rending the mountains and breaking in pieces the rocks before the Lord but the Lord was not in the wind it's kind of how the Lord used to this is an interesting transition here it really is because you know what back in here oh it wasn't the only way okay back here prior to this point the Lord was in the wind the Lord was in the miraculous the Lord so many times back here so he was in the big and it says he wasn't in the wind and after the wind an earthquake but the Lord was not in the earthquake and after the earthquake a fire had the Lord been in the fire recently to go back a page but he wasn't in the fire and after the fire watch this a sound of a gentle blowing this still small voice in the gentle whisper and when Elijah heard it he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entrance of the cave and behold a voice here we go and behold a voice came to him and said okay now Elijah what are you doing here and Elijah said you know what God thanks in the end I guess I'm here because I just want to be with you sorry for holding on to that stuff for so long is that what he said no you know what the text is amazing here we go back to the same verbiage said the same way in the depths of his depression and discouragement God has provided for him bread cakes and and drink God has given him rest God has given him him he's offered him himself and he says why are you here I have been very zealous for the Lord I told you the God of hosts for the sons of Israel have forsaken your covenant torn down your altars and killed your prophets with the sword and I alone am left and they seek my life now to take it away and then I just want you to read I'll kind of save my commentary
[time=2923] and hope that you just pick up the the shift all right I'm hoping you kind of just as we read this because this is sometimes how it goes you know what this is oftentimes how it goes so the Lord said to him okay Lord said to him all right go return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus and when you have arrived you shall anoint Hazael king over Aram and Jehu the son of Nimchi you shall anoint king over Israel and Elisha the son of Shafat of Abel Mehola you shall appoint as prophet read these next three words with me out loud in your place you see that now we know in the chapters that that come after this we know that Elijah didn't go away we know that Elijah was in no way removed to some shelf in a back room okay and we know that actually Elisha and Elijah become friends and I think in that friendship you would see that Elisha brings great encouragement to Elijah our discouraged one but do not miss the strength and the power of what we see going on here he says okay you go and then he says this in essence and this is what just blew me away this week okay so you know what you go I mean if that's why you're here and we're still we're still doing that let me just tell you okay watch this let me just tell you what I've got in store this thing that you've been discouraged about this plan that you're convinced has gone awry you know this this this feeling of depression and darkness that you're in the midst of because I didn't close the deal because your expectation didn't meet up with my unveiled reality and here's the thing about God you know what he could have said to Elijah verse 17 which we're about to read he could have said verse 17 to Elijah back right when Jezebel's messenger came and said to Elijah he's gonna kill you and all of the fear came up and all of the uncertainty welled up and all of the discouragement well God but no you see God he allows us you and I to go through this process at the end of which so many times you and I see again and again and again what Elijah sees here God's provision through God's plan in God's time watch this oh yeah John here at the end it shall come about the one who escapes from the sword of Hasael Jehu shall put to death and the one who escapes from the sword of Jehu Elisha shall put to death and oh yeah one last thing I will leave seven thousand in Israel the text would actually read I have left God had left seven thousand in Israel all of whom the knees of these people have not bowed to bail and every mouth that has not kissed him you see that Elijah thought he was all what he
[time=3133] was all all what say louder see Elijah thought he was all alone see Elijah thought he had the whole thing in view see Elijah and you and me sometimes think that we have got the thing pretty well dissected and seeing poor Elijah's mind he's going wait a minute I can see this thing and we came here and we came here and we came here and God you didn't close the deal and you not closing the deal has now brought great discouragement to my heart God what are you doing and God invites him to come and in the midst of attention enjoy his presence and Elijah says you know what this thing finished what my discouragement lifted well questioned this morning do you want his presence in your life or his stamp on your agenda do you want him or your expectations I'll tell you what in Exodus 32 it's amazing to
[time=3197] read back there Exodus 32 Exodus 33 the people of God in customary fashion grow impatient with God and they build a golden calf remember they build a golden calf and they worship it Moses is up on Mount Sinai this very mountain and he comes back and oh my goodness God pops a gasket God says that's it I've had it with these people and Moses begs God to just relent you know and so there's this amazing interchange between Moses and God and God finally says okay you can read it Exodus 32 Exodus 33 God finally says okay I'm going to let your people I'm going to let the people go I'm going to let the people go into the into the land that I've provided and I'm going to even send an angel with you but I'll stay here and Moses goes whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa wait a second what did you say you're going to stay here and we're going to go to the land and Moses says hey you know what I'd rather not I would rather in the midst of whatever it is we're going to face in the midst of whatever it is we're going to have to end I would rather be in your what presence whatever is going to come let it come however my expectations may not meet your unfolding reality fine you know what I want to be with you because I know in the end that your provision is good and your time is perfect and it is a reminder to you and me this morning that in whatever it is we might encounter in whatever situation it is you might face that we should be a people as discouraged against it might get as dark as it might get as heavy as the soul might feel that if the options are a white knuckled I'm not going to let go until you do this thing my way or a relinquishing of that control and a welcoming of God's presence and a willingness watch this to really not lip service really trust him really live dependently on him it's a reminder today to every one of us that there is life
[time=3345] in trial there is life in dependence there is life in his presence and that's something you and I need to hold on to would you stand with me and can we pray as we leave and let me just ask you as you stand if you would bow your heads and just close your eyes and I'm just going to I'm going to ask Corbin if you would just come and play and give you an opportunity to this morning you know what you may need some help you just might need an arm around your shoulder and someone willing to pray with you you may have really white knuckles this morning and you might just need to let go of some things and we won't figure it all out here today but I'll tell you what I'm going to ask our elders and those of you on staff here to just kind of make your way down here toward the front at the end and I mean this anybody up in the balcony down here in front young old in between anybody that would appreciate the opportunity to just pray with someone to an essence just say to God you know what this load is getting really really heavy I don't understand why God has allowed what he has allowed and my spirit is heavy and my soul feels dark and I and I want to give that I want to give all of it to him I want him to sustain me and I want him to carry me and I want to know what it's like to live and breathe again you come on down as I pray and as we close Corbin will just keep playing for a little bit and you just come on down and allow us the privilege of praying with you just putting an arm around you and saying you know what let's go to him and so Father as we leave may we leave today reminded of how very important it is that we live our lives and make our choices God and posture ourselves in such a way as to experience your provision not when we want it and not how we would maybe have planned it all out but God that we would be a people whose posture would indicate a willingness to trust you to follow you to get up each day to eat what we need to eat go to work where we need to work be faithful to things God you've called us to believing and trusting all along that in your time and in your place your perfect will will be revealed God we thank you for the privilege of praying with those that we love and know we thank you for the privilege of praying with those that we might even meet for the first time today but God if there's a heavy heart in the room allow them the joy of fellowship and the privilege of having an arm around them who loves them and cares for them God do your work in the hearts and lives of people today and we'll thank you for it and they all agreed and said amen
[time=3563] you
