[time=154] - Let's sing this next part as a covenant between you and the Lord.
[time=161] Let's forgive all of you everything.
[time=164] [MUSIC - 134 seconds]
[time=303] - Hi, my name's Sam Barfell, and I have the privilege of serving as a superintendent of Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=308] And one of the most fundamental foundational things we try and do as a Christian school, in Christian school educations, helping our students develop what we call a biblical worldview.
[time=318] And we integrate the truth of scripture into every academic discipline.
[time=322] That's our heartbeat, that's our mission, that's our purpose.
[time=325] And to that end, we are hosting a very dynamic event coming this September 17th and 18th of Friday night all day Saturday conference that we're calling World View Weekend.
[time=335] And we'll be featuring some of the most well-known worldview thinkers and worldview teachers in America who'll be right here at Black Hawk Christian School, Black Hawk Ministries for this two-day event.
[time=346] I wanna invite you to watch this clip of other worldview weekends across the country to get a little bit of feel of what it's like.
[time=353] (upbeat music) - You shall know the truth, you shall discover the truth to say you're free.
[time=360] - Post 9/11, we've seen a tremendous increase in the interest of World View Weekend.
[time=365] (upbeat music) - And the more you know about this book, the more you'll know about God, and the more spiritual and material you'll become.
[time=376] - It's not uncommon now for World View Weekens to be held in two cities at one time during one weekend.
[time=383] Our World View Weekens have been filled to capacity.
[time=386] We've added a team track to all of our World View Weekens and we invite the teens to leave the general session for three to four of the breakout sessions we have designed just for teenagers.
[time=394] In many of our cities such as Phoenix, Arizona, Richmond, Virginia, Wichita, Kansas, St. Paul, Minneapolis, Jackson, Mississippi, and Des Moines, Iowa, the team tracks have been filled to capacity.
[time=407] - I'll tell you something.
[time=408] When our young people realize that there's a God who loves them unconditionally is passionate about his relationship with them, they will respond.
[time=417] - Minneapolis, St. Paul recently we had 2,000 people attend our World View Weekend and of that 2,800 were teenagers.
[time=424] That kind of growth that has led to us training in a giving year anywhere from 25,000 to 30,000 adults and teens in a 12 month period.
[time=433] - And those of us who come to World View Weekens, those of us who read our Bibles, those of us who take the time to go to internet websites and read books, we will be prepared and we will see a harvest for the next generation.
[time=448] (upbeat music) - So the World View Weekens are growing rapidly, the need is there and the interest is ever increasing and you can make a World View Weekend a reality in your city.
[time=462] All it takes is one committed person to make it happen.
[time=468] I would like to personally invite you to attend World View Weekend right here in Fort Wayne, Indiana at Black Hawk Christian School, Black Hawk Ministries on Friday night, September 17th and all day Saturday, September 18th, just in a few short weeks.
[time=480] If you're interested in attending World View Weekend, you could log on to worldviewweekend.com, go to the Fort Wayne event link and get all the information you need there or actually purchase your ticket or you can call right here at Black Hawk Ministries by dialing 493-7400.

[time=500] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 315 seconds]
[time=824] My life is in your hands.
[time=862] [APPLAUSE]
[time=868] Hi, I'm Mitch.
[time=870] I'm a teaching pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries, and this is Kelly, our senior pastor, and Steve Longbrake, our senior teaching pastor.
[time=882] You mean like old?
[time=883] Yeah, that's what I meant.
[time=885] There's an age joke.
[time=887] We have a very unique senior pastor who would allow the perspective and felt convicted by God to allow the perspective of Scripture to come from three voices in the teaching setting.
[time=899] You know, you want to thank him for that?
[time=904] I love you.
[time=905] I love you too.
[time=907] And today where we just realized this rug is crooked, and it must have been driving him nuts.
[time=914] I just realized Mitch likes things in place.
[time=919] Yeah, and this rug is crooked, and it's been driving.
[time=922] I just know it's been driving you nuts the whole morning.
[time=924] Go ahead anyway.
[time=926] And all the perfectionists said, amen, that's right.
[time=931] I'm afraid to step beyond it.
[time=935] We're recapping about a seven week, I think this is our eighth week on the life of Elijah, and we're recapping the series today, the prophet Elijah who did some magnificent things recorded in the book of First Kings.
[time=947] And today we're going to look back at Elijah's legacy.
[time=952] And I really think the big idea here is the Lord's servant, because as we looked back, we said, what's the writer of First King telling us?
[time=961] What's the writer of these words trying to communicate to us?
[time=965] In Hebrew there's not italics, there's nothing like that.
[time=969] So what they want to emphasize, what the writer would like to emphasize is what is written again and again and again.
[time=978] And in fact, he opens up First Kings by saying, well, let me just read it, First King 17-1.
[time=985] And it says, this is Elijah speaking, as the Lord the God of Israel lives, whom I serve.
[time=996] As the Lord the God of Israel lives, whom I serve.
[time=1003] And I really think the writer's telling us, I'm now going to show you what we believe are three characteristics of someone who
[time=1013] serves a living and vibrant, alive personal God of the universe.
[time=1020] And these three characteristics that we'll see, I'm going to tell you up front.
[time=1025] First thing we see with Elijah's life is that Elijah prayed.
[time=1029] Write that down, Elijah prayed.
[time=1034] And the second thing we see is that Elijah didn't just pray, Elijah obeyed, write that down, Elijah obeyed.
[time=1045] And then the third thing is, it's kind of a byproduct and we'll get to that.
[time=1050] Elijah connected others to God because he prayed, because he obeyed,
[time=1057] Elijah connected others to God.
[time=1059] And it's very interesting what we think the writer of First Kings is trying to communicate.
[time=1064] There are three groups of people that tend to be the focus of his life.
[time=1070] And it makes you step back and as you read it again and again and again, you want to say, are those three groups of people really important to God?
[time=1080] If I'm going to serve God, should my life look like these three characteristics and apply to those three groups of people?
[time=1087] We think so.
[time=1088] So write this down, these three groups of people and then we'll unpack it.
[time=1092] The least, Elijah prayed, Elijah obeyed, Elijah connected the least to God.
[time=1100] Second, the lost, Elijah prayed about, Elijah obeyed regarding Elijah connected,
[time=1108] the lost to God.
[time=1111] And then his legacy, disciples, Elijah prayed about Elijah obeyed, Elijah connected,
[time=1121] disciples or his legacy to God.
[time=1124] And Kelly's going to kick us off on Elijah prayed for the least.
[time=1129] Elijah prayed the first characteristic we're going to look at and I want you just to write down as it relates to the least.
[time=1138] These would be the hurting people.
[time=1140] These would be the people without.
[time=1142] These would be the downtrodden.
[time=1143] These would be the folks in Elijah's situation.
[time=1147] It is this widow that God tells him to go to in zerafath for you and for me.
[time=1153] I don't know.
[time=1154] I don't know who it would be.
[time=1155] Who would that be for you in your life?
[time=1159] And I got some people in my mind.
[time=1162] There's some folks who I'm aware of who would kind of fall into that category.
[time=1167] I want you to have those individuals in your mind as you think about this.
[time=1171] Watch how he prayed for and conducted himself with the least.
[time=1176] And the first thing we want to show you here is 1 Kings 17-8.
[time=1179] You can look in your Bible or you can read along on the screen.
[time=1182] This is a very significant verse because of how it starts.
[time=1186] 1 Kings 17-8 says the word then the word of the Lord came to him saying.
[time=1192] Then the word of the Lord came to him saying arise, go to zerafath, which belongs to Sidon.
[time=1198] And stay there.
[time=1199] Behold, I have commanded a widow there to provide for you.
[time=1204] I want you to stop right there and just think about this for a moment.
[time=1207] As it relates to Elijah's prayer life, as it relates to the way he communicates with God,
[time=1214] we oftentimes think of praying as us sitting down and saying some things to him.
[time=1219] Understand, that's an awfully big part of it.
[time=1222] But part of praying too is being an individual who because of the way you live in relationship
[time=1228] with the Lord, because of the way you conduct yourself with him, because of the way you posture yourself with him again and again and again throughout the day.
[time=1237] You're one who listens to God.
[time=1242] Paul says pray without what?
[time=1244] Ceasing.
[time=1245] We learn in that text there, just that text alone.
[time=1248] The pray without ceasing text, that prayer can be, should be really.
[time=1252] It's an attitude.
[time=1253] It's a mindset.
[time=1254] It's a way you and I live our lives before him.
[time=1258] Always with an ear to what he might be saying, always with an ear to where he might be leading,
[time=1265] always with an ear to where he might be stopping.
[time=1270] But you see that phrase, chapter 17, 8, then the word of the Lord came to him saying, then the word of the Lord came to him saying, you see that again and again and again and again throughout 1 Kings 16, 17, 18, 19, you read it for yourself, you'll see it.
[time=1286] Then the word of the Lord came to him saying, and guess what Elijah's doing and guess what
[time=1292] you and I don't do so many times.
[time=1296] He's listening and I know that that's hard.
[time=1301] And I know that takes practice and I know it takes continued effort for you and I both
[time=1309] to posture ourselves in such a way, to live to get up in the morning and go through the
[time=1315] day.
[time=1317] Listening.
[time=1318] I went to visit my great-grandma a couple years ago.
[time=1321] I get up real early.
[time=1322] She gets up earlier than I do.
[time=1324] This is grandpa Joe.
[time=1325] Remember grandpa Joe?
[time=1326] This is grandpa Joe's wife and she would be up before I was a Bible in hand out in her recliner.
[time=1332] She took a nap at 10 every day.
[time=1334] She's 92 years old.
[time=1336] She took a nap at 10 every day.
[time=1338] I'd walk out there about 9.45.
[time=1340] She'd have her Bible open.
[time=1342] She'd be praying and she'd be talking to herself and to God and I just would like take this in.
[time=1348] She'd wake up and get ready and serve lunch and then we'd serve lunch and I'd sit down and eat lunch and she kind of slapped me and she'd say, "Wait." And she'd get her Bible and she'd open it up and she'd say, "Read this.
[time=1356] She want me to read a passage at lunch." And then she wanted to pray.
[time=1359] She doesn't call it praying.
[time=1360] She calls it talking to God.
[time=1362] I'll talk to him about that.
[time=1364] She'll say to you when you ask her to pray.
[time=1367] "You know, I was talking to God this morning," she'll say.
[time=1370] In the afternoon she repeats the deal.
[time=1373] Bible opened.
[time=1374] They're in the recliner.
[time=1375] At dinner she repeats the deal.
[time=1376] Before she goes to bed she repeats the deal.
[time=1381] And so when she says to me these days, "I was talking to God, it's like I believe her." She really does and you and I have to, we have to posture ourselves in such a way again
[time=1392] and again and again throughout our day and in the midst of our lives to listen.
[time=1398] Wow, Elijah not only listened, not only listened and prayed about the least, Elijah prayed
[time=1408] and he listened about the lost.
[time=1411] Name of the people of Mount Carmel and his connection to those people was through Ahab.
[time=1416] Ahab was wondering, providing poor leadership and the people were lost.
[time=1421] And so it says in 1 Kings 17-1 and 1 Kings 18-1 that the word of the Lord came to Elijah
[time=1428] and he's listening and then he gets in front of those people.
[time=1433] At 1 Kings 18-36 it's going to come on the screen.
[time=1436] And this is at the big showdown, right?
[time=1439] It's at the big showdown at Mount Carmel.
[time=1441] It's getting pretty exciting.
[time=1443] And what does Elijah do when he gets all those people together?
[time=1448] He prays, says at the time of sacrifice the prophet Elijah, step forward and pray.
[time=1457] O Lord God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel a personal God.
[time=1461] Let it be known today that you are God and Israel and that I am your servant, servant,
[time=1467] and have done all these things at your command.
[time=1471] Answer me O Lord, answer me so these people will know that you O Lord are God
[time=1478] and that you are turning their hearts back again.
[time=1486] I read that and I say okay, am I praying for a lost person that God would turn his heart back again?
[time=1497] Are you praying for a lost person that God would turn his heart back to him?
[time=1507] You know, to see the relevance this has to the heart of God.
[time=1512] In John 17 Jesus is getting ready to go the cross and he does this last prayer
[time=1518] that his disciples would actually be listening to and he raises his face and his hands toward heaven and you know who he prays for, besides them, do you know who he prays for?
[time=1528] You and me because at that moment Jesus prayed a prayer that echoes throughout the canyons of time
[time=1536] for every single person who will walk on this side and he prayed that you, he prayed for me
[time=1543] that we would know him and turn our hearts back to him.
[time=1549] There's a guy here today who took something that wasn't his and the moment he took that victim of that crime
[time=1559] prayed that that man's heart would be turned back to God.
[time=1564] Well he wasn't the only one, that man's mother, the mother of the person who's here today
[time=1570] prayed for him many years prior and continued to pray that his heart would be turned to God.
[time=1576] And a year ago in God's story and God's plan and God's sovereignty I just happened to be at the right place at the right time
[time=1583] and that man prayed to fully surrender his heart to God.
[time=1588] So will you join the prayer of Jesus and the example of Elijah and pray that a lost person would have his heart turned to God?
[time=1603] Do you pray like that? You'll be really strange.
[time=1608] Had a guy come and speak a graduation one year, his name's Steve and he pointed his bent finger out there
[time=1616] and he said be strange to those graduates.
[time=1620] He's referring to 1 Peter chapter 2, the Bible says that we're a chosen people, we're a royal priesthood,
[time=1626] we're a holy nation, we're a people belonging to God and he's called us out of darkness and we're given the privilege of proclaiming the praises of him who's done that into marvelous light.
[time=1639] And if you get really into that you get strange because the next few verses in 1 Peter say
[time=1647] be strangers and aliens in this world.
[time=1652] Elijah was weird.
[time=1656] Elisha that he passes on his legacy too is weird.
[time=1661] Not weird when it comes to thinking about who God's going to really honor, not weird forever, but weird walking on this earth.
[time=1671] He was strange.
[time=1673] And God talked to him and he listened to God and he passed on the legacy that God wanted him to pass on to Elisha.
[time=1682] If you listen to Kelly, it's possible that Elijah, the legacy was passed on right then
[time=1688] because Elijah was running away and scared and afraid.
[time=1692] God said where are you?
[time=1693] What are you doing here when he was hiding in the cave?
[time=1695] He gave him an answer.
[time=1696] Later God whispers to him and says what are you doing here?
[time=1699] And he gives him the same answer and then he says go pass on your legacy to Elisha.
[time=1704] Let's look at that.
[time=1705] 1 Kings chapter 19 verse 16.
[time=1710] It says also anoint Jehu, son of Nimshi.
[time=1712] This is God responding to Elijah when he's been hiding in the cave.
[time=1717] Over Israel and anoint Elisha, son of Shephat, from Abel Maholah to succeed you as prophet.
[time=1728] God chose to pass on what Elijah had been doing, what God had been doing actually through Elijah to Elisha.
[time=1739] If you really pray, if you're one of those people like Kelly was describing as this grandmother,
[time=1748] if you really pray, if you're really in conversation with God, if you're really God-conscious throughout your day,
[time=1755] you're going to be a bit strange to the people in this world.
[time=1759] You won't be conformed to the patterns of this world.
[time=1762] You'll be in the process of transformation, your mind being renewed.
[time=1766] And I hope at my funeral, they say God's legacy was passed on through him to people.
[time=1778] I should mention too real quick, I forgot to mention it earlier.
[time=1781] He prayed, he prayed for the least.
[time=1783] As Mitch told you just a few minutes ago, he prayed for the lost.
[time=1787] He prayed for and is sensitive to his legacy.
[time=1790] Back in 17, he prayed for the least.
[time=1792] Not only was he sensitive and listening to God, but in 17, it came about after these things.
[time=1798] The son of the woman, the mistress of the house, the son became sick and his sickness was so severe that there was no breath left in him.
[time=1806] So she said to Elijah, this is the widow.
[time=1808] So she said to Elijah, "What do I have to do with you, O man of God?
[time=1812] You have come to me to bring my iniquity to remembrance and to put my son to death." He said to her, Elijah says to her, "Give me your son." Then he took him from her bosom and carried him up to the upper room where he was living and laid him on his own bed.
[time=1827] And he called, here you go, and he called in the face of tragedy, where do you go?
[time=1831] In the face of difficulty, what's the first thing you give yourself to?
[time=1834] When things don't go like you thought they were going to go, what's the very first thing you feel compelled to do?
[time=1843] The very first thing he does, again with the least, here in mind, this poor boy's dead.
[time=1849] He calls to the Lord and said, "Oh, Lord my God, have you also brought calamity to the widow with whom I am staying by causing her son to die?"
[time=1857] Then he stretched himself upon the child three times and called to the Lord and said, "Oh, Lord my God, I pray you let this child's life return to him."
[time=1866] And the Lord heard the voice of Elijah and the life of the child return to him and he revived.
[time=1873] It's amazing.
[time=1875] And you and I need to be reminded of that.
[time=1878] His love for, his heart for the least causes him to pray for him, to pray for the mother.
[time=1886] This mother, this boy was the only thing the mother had.
[time=1888] This boy would be in time the only way she would ever have any income, ever have anything to eat, and now he's gone.
[time=1895] And Elijah's heart goes out to the least and he prays and he begs God.
[time=1902] So he prayed.
[time=1903] So Elijah prayed, first characteristic of a servant's heart.
[time=1908] Somebody serves the living God of the universe is that he prays.
[time=1912] He prayed for the least.
[time=1914] In this case, it's the widow.
[time=1916] He prayed for the lost, the lost people of Mount Carmel.
[time=1920] He prayed for his legacy, Elisha, and so you and I have to ask.
[time=1927] What's his name?
[time=1932] Of the least I'm praying for.
[time=1935] What's her name?
[time=1937] The lost I'm praying for.
[time=1940] What's his legacy?
[time=1943] What's his name?
[time=1945] And whom am I investing my life?
[time=1950] Got to ask.
[time=1952] But an interesting thing happens.
[time=1954] When we pray, God shapes our hearts to be like his.
[time=1959] And he gives us an opportunity as we listen to him to go make our muscles move with our prayers.
[time=1967] And that's obedience.
[time=1969] And so what we see with Elijah now is that Elijah prayed, but Elijah also obeyed.
[time=1973] He made his muscles move with his prayers.
[time=1976] And he went where God told him to go.
[time=1978] The writer makes it so clear.
[time=1980] You're going to see.
[time=1981] He did what God told him to do.
[time=1982] And he said what God told him to say.
[time=1984] And Kelly's going to show us first to the least.
[time=1987] To the least.
[time=1988] This is how we see Elijah's obedience.
[time=1990] Go back to chapter 17 there in verse 8.
[time=1992] We've seen that.
[time=1993] Then the word of the Lord came to him saying, "Arise, go to zeraphath." Right?
[time=1999] And I'll just have you stop there again.
[time=2002] God comes to Elijah.
[time=2004] And God speaks to Elijah.
[time=2006] And God says to Elijah, "Go to the widow's house at zeraphath."
[time=2014] So now I just want to ask you, before we go any further, I just want to ask you to just think back on the last couple of days.
[time=2019] Would you do that?
[time=2021] I want you just to think back on the last couple of weeks.
[time=2024] Maybe just the last month or so.
[time=2027] And many of you in the room today, students and young adults, moms and dads, grandmas and grandpas.
[time=2032] There are many in the room today and you live in a relationship with him.
[time=2036] And it may not be grandma Jackson-ish, but you're working at it.
[time=2041] And you're spending time with him and you're inundating your heart and your mind with the scriptures.
[time=2046] And you're spending time with him and you're listening to stuff that helps.
[time=2051] And I just got to ask you, have you felt a nudge?
[time=2056] In the last few days or weeks, I mean, have you sensed that all God kind of sang to you in his own way through his word or through his spirit, through the word of God, through the spirit of God, or through the people of God?
[time=2069] Hey.
[time=2072] Have you felt or sensed anything like that?
[time=2075] I would really like you to go and do this.
[time=2082] See, if you're not walking with him and if you're not sensitive to him and if your ear's not to the spiritual ground, so to speak, you know, sometimes we miss that.
[time=2093] But God said to Elijah, go and Elijah went.
[time=2097] And not only did he go, but he did what God called him to do.
[time=2101] He even said what God called him to say.
[time=2104] And you know what?
[time=2105] Many times as you and I go, many times as we obediently do, often times God also asks you and I,
[time=2111] to speak.
[time=2113] And I want you to see what it says here.
[time=2115] If you go to 17, verse 10, it says, so he went.
[time=2119] Verse 8, he says, go.
[time=2121] And in verse 10, we see that he went.
[time=2123] And then look at verse 14.
[time=2125] 1 Kings 17, 14, "For thus says the Lord God of Israel, the bowl of flowers shall not be exhausted."
[time=2133] I'll stop right there and just catch you up for those of you new to the study.
[time=2136] Elijah asks the woman to go and make him something to eat.
[time=2141] This poor widow had nothing.
[time=2143] She had a little bit of flower left in her jar and she had a little bit of oil left in her can.
[time=2148] And that was it.
[time=2150] And so she's going, what are you talking about?
[time=2153] Go make you something to eat.
[time=2155] But it's what God had called him to do.
[time=2157] And so he asks the woman to make him something to eat.
[time=2160] She questions it and he says, well, wait a minute.
[time=2163] Understand this.
[time=2165] For thus says the Lord God of Israel, the bowl of flowers shall not be exhausted, nor shall
[time=2171] the jar of oil be empty until the day that the Lord sends rain on the face of the earth.
[time=2180] You know what people?
[time=2182] I can sort of speak for you on this because I just know that there are many in the room who have this opportunity.
[time=2188] I know for me, I can tell you daily, I have the absolute unspeakable privilege of looking
[time=2194] fellow Christ followers just like you in the eye who are struggling, who are confused.
[time=2201] They're not getting what's going on.
[time=2203] They wouldn't have done it this way.
[time=2205] Their hearts are heavy.
[time=2206] Their hope is dimming.
[time=2209] And I get this privilege of looking other Christ followers right in the eye and saying, hey, you know what, no, no trial has overtaken you.
[time=2218] Come here.
[time=2219] Hold on to me.
[time=2220] Let me hold your hand.
[time=2221] Look at me.
[time=2222] Believe this.
[time=2223] Know that this is true.
[time=2226] See you and I get the privilege of speaking hope and courage into the lives of others.
[time=2230] No trial has overtaken you, but such as this common to man and God is faithful who will
[time=2236] not allow you to be tempted or tried beyond what you are able, but with the temptation
[time=2242] or trial will provide the way of escape also so that you will be able to endure it.
[time=2249] You will be able to endure it.
[time=2251] You can by God's grace and with His strength we get to say this to people.
[time=2257] You can do the jar of flour, it's not going to run out.
[time=2261] The jar of oil, it's going to still be there because He's a good God and He's not going to hang you out to dry.
[time=2268] And though it might be confusing, let's keep walking together.
[time=2272] See, He obeyed.
[time=2275] He prayed for the least.
[time=2276] He obeyed as it related to the least.
[time=2279] He went and did what He was supposed to do.
[time=2284] And I want you and me to be a kind of people that would do the very same thing with the least in our lives.
[time=2289] We were talking earlier, it was interesting that Elijah listened before he spoke in these
[time=2295] situations.
[time=2296] And it's so important when we go with the Spirit of God and by the power of the Spirit of God that we listen before we speak.
[time=2303] And that's what we see with the lost.
[time=2305] Now when he obeyed regarding God's promptings to the least, he obeyed regarding God's promptings to the lost.
[time=2311] And in 1 Kings 17-1, 1 Kings 18-1, God says the Elijah, go, go to Ahab, that's his link
[time=2319] to the lost people.
[time=2320] And he says I'll send rain on the land.
[time=2322] And there it is.
[time=2323] Verse 2 in each situation, I think so, Elijah went.
[time=2328] So Elijah went.
[time=2331] And he said what God wanted him to say in the midst of Mount Carmel, in the midst of all that, Elijah went before the people and said how long will you waver between two opinions?
[time=2341] One foot in and one foot out.
[time=2343] If the Lord is God, follow Him, but if Baal is God, follow Him.
[time=2350] And we just got to ask, what's his name?
[time=2356] What's her name?
[time=2358] I'm praying for the loss that his or her heart would be turned to God.
[time=2364] And God's saying go, go to that person.
[time=2369] So you think he is?
[time=2373] I really think he is.
[time=2375] He did with Elijah.
[time=2377] I got convicted on this several years ago, and I prayed okay, God, if you think my story fits just right with somebody else, God, whatever it is, if I have the answers for someone who asks, just bring him into my life and I start praying that prayer one week.
[time=2391] That week, that exact week, a Muslim, a Buddhist, and an atheist all called me about spiritual
[time=2399] matters.
[time=2400] I challenge you today to start praying about a lost person.
[time=2407] My name, or if you don't have one, pray the prayer I did.
[time=2410] But God's going to say something to you.
[time=2414] He's going to say go, do, listen, say, make your muscles move with your prayers.
[time=2420] What do you want to do?
[time=2422] It's not just the least, it's not just the lost, it's our legacy.
[time=2426] If you're like me, you're thinking, yeah, but that's Elijah.
[time=2431] I mean, that's a prophet.
[time=2435] That's Elisha received the blessing from God to prophesy and to do miracles.
[time=2443] If you're like me, I sit here and I think, well, man, that's not me.
[time=2449] I can't do that.
[time=2451] James really helps us out there.
[time=2453] He's teaching us about prayer in chapter five in the book of James, and in chapter five
[time=2459] he says, and Elijah, a man just like us, prayed, and it didn't rain for three and a half years.
[time=2469] You know that flour and oil lasted for three and a half years?
[time=2472] Until it rained.
[time=2475] A man just like us was a vessel being used by God because he prayed, and then he went.
[time=2487] He did what God told him to do.
[time=2489] In 1 Kings 19, 19, it says exactly that.
[time=2495] So Elijah went from there and found Elisha, son of Shifat.
[time=2501] He was plowing with 12 yoke of oxen, and he himself was driving the 12th pair.
[time=2507] Elijah went up to him and threw his cloak around him.
[time=2512] Elisha then left his oxen and ran after Elijah.
[time=2515] Let me kiss my father and mother, goodbye.
[time=2517] He said, and then I will come with you.
[time=2519] Go back, Elijah replied.
[time=2521] What have I done to you?
[time=2523] So Elisha left him and went back.
[time=2525] He took his yoke of oxen, slaughtered them.
[time=2527] He burned the plowing equipment, took the meat and gave it to the people, and they ate.
[time=2531] Then he set out to follow Elijah and became his attendant.
[time=2537] He put the cloak on him.
[time=2538] That was a real common practice.
[time=2541] You would pass on your legacy.
[time=2543] You would empower the next generation with authority by putting your cloak over them.
[time=2548] And prophets did them when they passed on authority to their students.
[time=2553] And Elijah did that with Elisha.
[time=2555] God told him to.
[time=2556] And I was thinking, you know, it doesn't say one thing in here about what Elijah was thinking.
[time=2562] But you know what?
[time=2563] When you pass the cloak on, you're saying, I guess I'm finishing your beginning.
[time=2571] He's admitting he knows that his time is limited, yet he did it.
[time=2578] He just went and obeyed.
[time=2580] And I love this stuff that Elisha did.
[time=2582] I don't know what was going on in Elisha's heart for preparation, but I love his response, don't you?
[time=2588] He slaughters the oxen.
[time=2590] Now, he's a rich guy.
[time=2591] There are 12 teams of oxen out there working their land.
[time=2596] And he slaughters two of the oxen and burns them with the yoke.
[time=2601] What an exclamation point on the reality.
[time=2604] This is the end of my time plowing.
[time=2608] I'm going to serve God.
[time=2610] Elijah obeyed God and he went on to pass his gods, by God's authority, pass God's legacy
[time=2621] on.
[time=2622] I was with the God on Friday.
[time=2624] You know, I mentioned a little bit ago about being strange.
[time=2627] This guy's been conforming to the patterns of this world for years.
[time=2631] He took his mom and dad's business of $750,000 or so, and he's built that into a three corporation
[time=2639] business that's really worth about 15, maybe 20 million.
[time=2644] He's feeling all kinds of heat about that.
[time=2647] And I said this to him.
[time=2648] I said, you know what I can sense in you?
[time=2650] You're still trying to control it all.
[time=2653] You haven't received the legacy that God passes on to believers.
[time=2659] The truth is, you need to embrace the unknown, the adventure that God's called you to has
[time=2666] some unknown to it out there.
[time=2668] Some of it is a byproduct, not saying you can't work hard to make a good living, but you don't need to control the product.
[time=2677] You need to love God, serve him, work hard, and accept, embrace the byproduct of that,
[time=2683] which is whatever money you end up with.
[time=2685] The guy goes, you're right.
[time=2688] You know, we have the privilege of being that legacy like Elisha was.
[time=2695] Elijah prayed, talked to God, and then when God said go, he went, and when God said speak,
[time=2704] he spoke.
[time=2707] Well, Elijah prayed about the lost, about the least, about his legacy.
[time=2716] Elijah obeyed, he made his muscles move with his prayers about the least, about the lost,
[time=2722] about his legacy.
[time=2724] And as a byproduct of that, what transpired is that Elijah connected others to God.
[time=2733] And what we're going to see here is what they said.
[time=2735] It's interesting, the writer of First Kings says, oh, and here's what they said.
[time=2740] And the first is the least, the widow.
[time=2743] The widow now who has watched Elijah come, God told Elijah to go to the widow, he came.
[time=2748] She has watched as the flower didn't run out.
[time=2754] She has seen some things, some amazing things, transpiring.
[time=2758] Then the sun gets sick, then Elijah takes the sun up, prays to God, God give the boy his life back, the God revives the boy, and we pick it up in verse 23, Elijah took the child and brought him down from the upper room into the house and gave him to his mother.
[time=2773] Can you imagine what that must have been like?
[time=2775] And Elijah said, see, your son is alive.
[time=2779] Then the woman said to Elijah, now I know, now I know that you are a man of God and that
[time=2785] the word of the Lord in your mouth is truth.
[time=2790] People real simply, when we pray, when we are mindful of what God wants, when we listen
[time=2796] to him, when we go to him, when in going to him, he nudges us and moves us this way and
[time=2802] when we're willing to go, when we pray and obey and we do that wholeheartedly, they
[time=2808] see it, they observe it, they're impacted by it.
[time=2813] It makes a difference oftentimes eternally in their lives.
[time=2819] I can't begin to tell you how encouraged I am in recent months around here as we have partnered with and just kind of come alongside a ministry here that we support called neighbor
[time=2829] link.
[time=2830] I cannot begin to tell you how I see this being played out again and again and again.
[time=2835] Neighbor link Fort Wayne.org.
[time=2840] It's an amazing opportunity.
[time=2842] It's so simple.
[time=2844] People can go to neighbor link Fort Wayne.org and they can post on that site needs.
[time=2849] I need help.
[time=2851] I'm not doing so well.
[time=2853] I need my yard mode.
[time=2854] I need my house painted.
[time=2856] I need my roof fixed.
[time=2858] I need groceries.
[time=2859] I mean, all kinds of needs get posted on this site and then we're able to, having prayed
[time=2867] and having made ourselves open to obedience, we get to go and my goodness how people have
[time=2873] been going.
[time=2875] You get to go to that site and sign up and say, I'll help and you get to pick up a paint brush.
[time=2881] You get to pick up a saw.
[time=2882] A man a lawn mower.
[time=2883] I mean, you get to go and roll up your sleeves and serve.
[time=2890] Pray and obey and then you know what happens?
[time=2893] It is incredible to hear the stories and they're coming in faster and faster now.
[time=2899] People who have been in light of that ministry now connected, further connected.
[time=2903] Some for the first time others further connected to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2910] Every after story of unbelievable, unspeakable thanks for the things that have been done.
[time=2917] Whole new opportunities, whole new relationships opened up or further because of a people's
[time=2923] willingness to pray, obey and in the process have the opportunity to connect others to God especially in this case the least.
[time=2931] It's an amazing privilege.
[time=2933] See the least in Elijah's life found provision.
[time=2936] We haven't written in the present tense because I believe if you pray and you obey, God's promptings about the least, that the least in your life will find provision.
[time=2944] And then second, the lost find salvation.
[time=2948] Here's what the people of Mount Carmel said, it's 1 Kings 1839.
[time=2952] When all the people saw this, they fell prostrate and cried, the Lord he is God, the Lord he
[time=2958] is God.
[time=2959] And I got to tell you about a week ago, maybe it's two weeks ago, I heard 53 stories of people who said as a still water baptism, the Lord he is God and you know what each one of those 53 had in their lives, somebody who prayed for them and somebody who obeyed God's promptings for them.
[time=2975] And that's the kingdom of God that he's called us to do.
[time=2979] You and me, that's it, servants of God and the lost find salvation.
[time=2989] Elisha's name, E-L-I-S-H-A, you know, the legacy passed on, Elisha's name means my God
[time=2998] is salvation.
[time=3001] Every time somebody said his name, they were proclaiming the truth that God is salvation.
[time=3010] Remember there in 1 Kings 19-21 where we read it, it said he set out to follow Elijah
[time=3016] and became his attendant.
[time=3019] Well, that's the purpose that God had for him at that time.
[time=3025] He attended to Elijah and he was faithful to do that.
[time=3036] When Moses died, the Bible says, and Moses, servant of the Lord died.
[time=3041] And then it says, and Joshua, son of none, servant of Moses went on to serve.
[time=3048] At the end of his lifetime, the Bible says, and Joshua, servant of the Lord died.
[time=3056] There's a time that our legacy means that we serve another person.
[time=3061] God has us under the authority of another person where to help make them be successful.
[time=3068] If you have real purpose in your life, you can serve.
[time=3073] Elijah served for 50 to 60, between 50 and 60 years, Elisha served several kings, but
[time=3081] he served God and spoke the truth to all those kings.
[time=3085] That guy that I was talking about, that I was with last Friday, I said, "What do you
[time=3092] want your legacy to be?" I mean, when they're standing there at their funeral, what do you want them to say?
[time=3099] And he parlayed 750 grand into 15 million, he said, "No."
[time=3106] I said, "Well, is that what you're giving your life to?" He said, "Yes." Elijah and Elisha were willing to serve because they had purpose.
[time=3122] Their purpose was to build the Kingdom of God, and we get the privilege of being the heirs,
[time=3133] and now we get to pass on the inheritance.
[time=3137] Don't you want them to raise their hand at your funeral and say, "He invested in me forever."
[time=3146] I do, and Elisha's words to Elijah was, "I want a double portion of that before you
[time=3156] go." And he's not saying, "I want to be twice as effective as you are." He's saying, "I want to be considered your firstborn son." The firstborn son would get twice this year, and it says in Deuteronomy that that's the strength of the legacy passed on from the Father to the Son.
[time=3172] And so that's what's happening, the strength of the legacy of Elijah is getting passed on to Elisha to live out the legacy.
[time=3179] Well, serving of God, praise three groups, what's their names?
[time=3185] The least, the lost, legacy, discipleship.
[time=3191] We obey.
[time=3192] Elijah obeyed his muscles move with his prayers regarding the least, lost, and his legacy.
[time=3199] And then the byproduct of that was Elijah connected others to God, the least found provision,
[time=3208] the lost, found salvation, and his legacy found purpose.
[time=3216] And you know what happens when others get connected to God.
[time=3218] You know what happens when we pray and we obey and we go to the least, the lost, and our legacy, we find God.
[time=3227] Philip Hianci and sole survivors interviewing Henry now and who left Notre Dame theology
[time=3233] and Harvard theology and went to give his life to the physically and mentally challenged in Toronto.
[time=3239] And Yancei says, "Oh, that's so great.
[time=3242] That's so great, Henry, that you took the spirit of God.
[time=3246] You took God to those people who are mentally physically challenged." And he said, "No." Now he stops.
[time=3253] Yancei admits it and says, "No." I went to the least to find God.
[time=3259] Psalm 34, 18 says, "God is close to those who are crushed in spirit."
[time=3267] He saved those.
[time=3268] He's close to the brokenhearted.
[time=3269] He saves those who are crushed in spirit.
[time=3273] I was asking my friend Andy this week, "Well, I tell him what we're going to talk about." And I said, "Andy, so let me just ask you.
[time=3279] Is your life?
[time=3280] You're a believer.
[time=3281] You're a servant of God.
[time=3282] You're in the marketplace.
[time=3283] He says, "Your life look like this.
[time=3286] Do you pray for the least, the lost, your legacy?
[time=3290] Do you obey God's promptings and make your muscles move with your prayers about the least, about the lost, about your legacy?
[time=3296] Is your life characterizing known by the least, the lost, and your legacy being connected to God?" And he said, "Inadequate, inadequate, inadequate."
[time=3308] That's the right answer.
[time=3309] And that is the first step.
[time=3311] Yes it is.
[time=3312] And we want to give you an opportunity.
[time=3316] Most of you probably like the three of us feel inadequate, and maybe the way that we're approaching that, the way that you and I might be giving ourselves to that.
[time=3323] So here's your opportunity for the week.
[time=3326] Would love for you to write it down, we're going to let you go with this.
[time=3328] We would invite you this week for the next seven days.
[time=3332] We'll come back again next Sunday, one service, member 1045 right here.
[time=3336] And we will come back and we will hope and we will pray that in these seven days that you would, along with us, be willing to do this.
[time=3343] Would you be willing to identify maybe one individual or one family that would come into
[time=3349] the category of the least?
[time=3353] Who do you know?
[time=3356] Who has God brought across your screen?
[time=3359] And you know right now that they would be that individual or that family.
[time=3364] Something has happened.
[time=3365] Something has transpired and they are without.
[time=3369] And would you be willing to pray for them this week?
[time=3373] And would you also, this is going to take a little bit of time.
[time=3375] You may have to set the alarm, you know, 10, 15 minutes earlier, I don't know.
[time=3380] You may have to take a little bit more time at night.
[time=3382] You may have to take a little bit more time out of your lunch break.
[time=3385] Would you be willing this week to pray for somebody who's far from God?
[time=3390] Somebody who doesn't know him, somebody who you know because of your relationship with them.
[time=3395] You know that they don't know the Lord.
[time=3397] They may know about him, but you know what they need desperately is to walk in those
[time=3403] steps of full surrender to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3405] And when was the last time you took a week and prayed?
[time=3409] God please do a work in his or her life.
[time=3412] God, if you'd let me be a part of that, please let me.
[time=3416] But pray for the least and pray for the lost and who is it in your life?
[time=3421] This is a great thing for you and I to think about, whoever you are, who is it that God is giving you the chance to deposit truth and love and life into.
[time=3430] Who's that younger man?
[time=3432] Who's that person who hasn't walked with the Lord maybe as long as you have and you're getting to build a relationship and friendship with them?
[time=3438] Who is the individual or individuals that you're going to have the opportunity to leave a legacy with them?
[time=3444] Would you pray for them this week?
[time=3448] We're challenging you this morning.
[time=3449] We're inviting you to a wonderful endeavor to spend seven days praying for those three folks and see what God does with it.
[time=3457] See how God changes you.
[time=3459] See how God changes us in the process.
[time=3462] Let's stand and we'll close in a word of prayer.
[time=3466] Father, we thank you for the time this morning, the opportunity and privilege God to come into
[time=3472] this place, so many of us here today, of forgiven people who have been by your grace
[time=3478] and through your mercy granted the opportunity, God, of knowing you and living in a relationship
[time=3485] with you.
[time=3486] And God, as we leave this place today and as we think about Elijah and the way he lived his life, God, the way he responded to you, God, I pray that every one of us would leave encouraged and challenged as it relates to the way that we would posture ourselves with
[time=3502] you, God, the way that we would conduct ourselves in prayer, in communication, in listening with
[time=3508] you, God, that we would be a praying, listening people, determined and given in our hearts
[time=3518] to doing whatever we would have to do, making whatever changes we would have to make, to spend that kind of time with you, sharing our hearts with you, listening as you share your
[time=3529] heart with us, God, that we would be a praying people, and God that we would be obedient, willing to go, willing to do, willing to speak, God, give us the strength.
[time=3540] We beg you today, we plead with you today, give us the strength and courage to be that kind of people, and we'll thank you for it in your son's name we pray, amen.
[time=3559] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
