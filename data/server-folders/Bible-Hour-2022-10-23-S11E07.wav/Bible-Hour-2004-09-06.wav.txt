[time=281] â™ª
[time=309] We are also thankful to have our Bible hour audience right here on this camera, right here, which is kind of a new thing.
[time=315] We're going to say hi to our Bible hour audience and do our weekly hello to them live here in the service.
[time=321] So we're saying hello to the Bible hour audience as well.
[time=324] And we want you in the Bible hour viewing audience to know that next week, beginning September 19th,
[time=331] is a brand new series that we've entitled "Navigating the Storms of Life." You know and I know that this life is full of decisions and choices that we have to make regarding finances,
[time=343] and family, and friends, and our future.
[time=347] And the book of Proverbs is a book in God's Word that speaks to that very issue.
[time=352] And so we would love for you to come and be with us.
[time=355] These folks are here today and we would love to have you here with us next week as we open up God's Word
[time=361] and begin to see how it is we can navigate the storms of life.
[time=365] That's what we're entitling the series, "Navigating the Storms of Life." We hope that you can come and be with us.
[time=370] We'd love to meet you and it would be great to have you here with us.
[time=373] We hope to see you here soon.
[time=395] Still, I will worship you.
[time=398] I will worship you.

[time=849] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[time=854] Blessed be the name of the Lord in yesterday.
[time=861] Blessed be your name.
[time=866] Give and take away.
[time=871] But we will choose to say.
[time=874] Blessed be your name.
[time=880] Father, we will choose this day to serve you to bless your name.
[time=894] Though you give and you take away,
[time=900] it's only for a moment.
[time=903] This life is a vapor, and it lasts only briefly.
[time=908] And so, God, we just pray that you would be our source of strength.
[time=913] When we bless, God would you show us where you're at in the midst of the good
[time=922] and in the midst of the bad, and help us to never neglect you, or neglect the praise that's due your name, Father.
[time=932] You may be seated.
[time=960] Father, we will choose this day to serve you in the midst of the good and in the midst
[time=974] of the good and in the midst of the bad,
[time=980] and in the midst of the good and in the midst of the bad,
[time=1000] and in the midst of the good and in the midst of the good and in the midst of the bad,
[time=1042] and in the midst of the good and in the midst of the bad,
[time=1081] and in the midst of the bad,
[time=1101] and in the midst of the good and in the midst of the good and in the midst of the good and
[time=1121] in the midst of the good and in the midst of the bad,
[time=1144] and in the midst of the good and in the midst of the good and in the midst of the good and
[time=1203] midst of the bad,
[time=1223] and in the midst of the good and in the midst of the good and in the midst of the good and
[time=1223] [REPETITIVE CONTENT - 455 seconds] and in the midst of the good and in the midst of the good and in the midst of the good and...
[time=1704] of the good and in the midst of the good and in the midst of
[time=1725] the good and in the midst of the good and in the midst of the good and in the midst
[time=1947] that's the answer, the person of Jesus Christ and that's the truth and it's as relevant
[time=1956] and powerful and true today as it's ever been, the message of faith in Christ, the gospel
[time=1962] message of salvation, redemption and new life is as transformational today as it was 2,000
[time=1970] years ago and see here's the kicker, alright folks here's the deal, God don't miss this,
[time=1978] God has entrusted this timeless truth, you see God in His providence has given this life
[time=1984] altering, sin conquering, potentially world changing message to one institution, one holy
[time=1997] and set apart messenger, you see in God's providence and plan He has left the hope of
[time=2005] the world in the hands of, in the heart and feet of the church, the church, one answer
[time=2017] the person of Jesus Christ and one possessor of that answer, His church, not religion,
[time=2025] no, He has left the hope of the world in the hands and feet and hearts of Christ following
[time=2031] God honoring believers. In our study in recent days in the Old Testament we saw that there
[time=2037] was a time when He had hoped Israel, His chosen people would have been that distinct set apart
[time=2044] messenger, He tried again and again and again to call them to an opportunity to be a light
[time=2050] in a very dark world, He had hoped that His people would have in time come to the place where they were willing to be used of Him, willing to stand for what was right, willing to obey Him at all costs and we saw in our study of the Old Testament in recent weeks
[time=2066] they again and again and again shrunk back from, moved away from, compromised and lost
[time=2075] that opportunity so we see Him turning to the church in this new day, in this new covenant
[time=2081] and saying to the church, you know what He says to Peter, the gates of hell will not prevail against it and go into all the world. He calls you an eye to be the church, local gatherings
[time=2092] made up of passionate, fully surrendered followers of Christ who long to live out their faith,
[time=2098] share their faith and see that faith, change their friends, their families, their cities,
[time=2104] their states, their nations and their world and it's really important that you sit here
[time=2111] this morning and you at least be willing in your own heart to admit that, that, that
[time=2118] is possible, that that is His plan, you are, you are who He looks at and what you do, those
[time=2128] of you that know Him, those of you that live today in a fully surrendered relationship with Him, your willingness to respond, your willingness to be the church, my willingness to be a part of that with you, it can change you, it can change your neighbor, it can change
[time=2145] your block, it can change the city, it can change this state and this isn't just like
[time=2153] pie in the sky stuff, no, it really, that's how He designed it to change the world because
[time=2161] there's just one answer, one answer for it all, the person of Christ and just one God ordained messenger, the church, so it stands to reason for the world to be reached, for
[time=2172] the neighbor to find hope, for the five-year-old to have a future, for the broken home to finally be restored, for addictions to be broken, for loneliness to find security, for terror to be replaced with truth, the church must prevail, you and I, the church must stand and
[time=2188] by His grace and for His glory push back the darkness.
[time=2193] Now, most of you in the room this morning hear that and think to yourself, you know what?
[time=2199] That's really true.
[time=2201] Most of you in the room this morning sit here and say, "That's how it should be." But it's surprising, you really would be surprised, I think a few of you would be shocked at how many people still don't quite understand then how that works, how that's supposed
[time=2216] to be played out.
[time=2219] And let me just help you a little bit with that if I can this morning.
[time=2222] Let me, for some of you, give you some new teaching on that, for others of you this morning, let me just try and give you a timely reminder.
[time=2229] Look at Ephesians chapter 4, "The church is the hope of the world.
[time=2234] God has chosen to allow you and I Christ following God-honoring believers to be the messengers
[time=2241] of life-change and altered eternities."
[time=2247] How does that flesh itself out?
[time=2247] What does that look like?
[time=2249] Well, Paul, in his letter to the church at Ephesus, in the first three chapters our men are studying Ephesians now in our power equipment men's Bible study.
[time=2259] That's on Thursday mornings at 6.30 and Thursday evenings at 5.30.
[time=2263] I'm going to jump ahead.
[time=2264] They just started.
[time=2265] I'm going to jump ahead to chapter 4 because in chapter 4 he begins to really talk about and explain how it is where to live out our faith.
[time=2274] First three chapters of Ephesians gives us a real clear picture of our position in Christ, all that comes with knowing him, positionally then 4, 5, and 6 talk about the practice of
[time=2285] our faith and he starts with this divinely appointed institution.
[time=2289] He starts with the church and it says in Ephesians 4, 11 and he gave and he gave some
[time=2295] as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as pastors and teachers.
[time=2304] That would be me.
[time=2307] He gave the church certain individuals who give their lives to preaching and leading and
[time=2316] shepherding the church.
[time=2322] Verse 12 says, "For the equipping of the saints." He gave some as pastors and teachers for the equipping of the saints for the work of service
[time=2330] to the building up of the body of Christ.
[time=2337] And you would be surprised today at how many people still think that it is for the church.
[time=2348] Enough to walk through these doors, find a good seat, open your Bible, take some notes, be encouraged, be grown somewhat even in your faith, walk out through those doors and on
[time=2361] with the rest of their week, on with the rest of their life because the guy they think who gets the check will do the work of the ministry or the guys who get the checks or the team
[time=2374] that gets the checks.
[time=2379] See the tragedy is, people we've talked about this before, we see it even more so today.
[time=2384] Consumerism, the consumer mentality, it hasn't just crept into the church.
[time=2390] No, no, no, no, it is running rampant in the church today.
[time=2396] There are so many still.
[time=2399] Some even here, I would suspect, who think that the work of the ministry, all the things
[time=2405] that need to get done, all the kids that need to be served, all the students who need to get led, all the songs that need to get sung, all the work projects that need to get done,
[time=2415] all the leading, all the disciples, somehow there's this mentality, they'll do it.
[time=2420] But you see, God's Word today gives us a clear reminder that it's not for us to do.
[time=2428] It's for you to do, and you're sitting there thinking, "Well, he's not talking to me."
[time=2434] No, I am, I'm talking to you, no, no, no, I'm talking to you.
[time=2440] It is for you to do.
[time=2443] See it is for me to plant my tail in my chair, so I'm 20 to 25 hours a week, and study and
[time=2452] read and pray and dig and think and listen and put together and beg God for help and insight
[time=2460] so that I can, with some semblance of integrity, stand up here before you and try my best with
[time=2466] His help to equip you so that you can do the work of service.
[time=2477] And He gave some as pastors and teachers for the equipping of the saints, for the work of service to the building up of the body of Christ.
[time=2485] Write these three things down.
[time=2490] God tells us this morning as we think about this world and our opportunity to reach it,
[time=2496] these friends and our opportunity to extend a hand to them, these needs and our opportunity
[time=2504] to meet them.
[time=2505] God says, "Does the church be equipped?" Write that down, would you?
[time=2509] Be equipped.
[time=2513] I've already kind of shared with you what that entails on my part, and I still have to work that you know what people, 20 to 25 hours in a chair with my door closed, not
[time=2524] having conversations, not being with people, that is hard work for me.
[time=2530] My ears are amazing.
[time=2532] I can hear conversations 12 offices away.
[time=2537] I'm so you can ask anybody, and it just kills me.
[time=2540] I just want to be where people are talking and laughing and doing what they're doing.
[time=2546] But I've got to sit in a chair, because God says that you deserve that.
[time=2553] The Word of God brought to you in a way whereby you can be encouraged, challenged and equipped.
[time=2558] You're to be equipped.
[time=2559] It's a great word.
[time=2560] Write this down.
[time=2561] The Word in the Greek equipped means, too, that you should use that word to refer to the setting of a broken bone, the setting of a broken bone, a bone that's broken, that needs to be made right, a bone that's not what it's supposed to be.
[time=2572] It needs to be made whole, a bone that's disfigured, there needs to be a cast, there needs to be
[time=2579] a sling, there needs to be an operation to set the bone so it can do what it was supposed
[time=2585] to do.
[time=2586] And most of you in the room this morning, I'm sure, would agree that we come into this place, all of us with a degree of brokenness.
[time=2594] And it is the Word of God that equips, it is the Word of God that sets, it is the Word of God that makes complete.
[time=2602] I am, too, and Mitch is, too, and Steve, we are to prepare to do that.
[time=2606] You are to listen.
[time=2610] Part of being equipped implies that you're here.
[time=2613] Let's start there.
[time=2614] I'm not going to slap anybody on the wrist, it's not time for a lecture on church attendance.
[time=2620] I'm just going to, well, just say part of being equipped would imply that you're here.
[time=2625] Not because good Christians are always there, but because that would be the desire of your heart to be equipped, to be used of God, to reach your block, your city, your state,
[time=2635] your nation, your world.
[time=2641] It requires activity, it requires notes, it requires listening to a tape, it requires
[time=2647] taking it in on a Sunday, it requires you spending time in that same passage, in that same word, Monday, and Tuesday, and Wednesday, and Thursday, and allowing the Spirit of God and the Word of God to do what only it can do, reach into your heart and life, and change you, equipping you.
[time=2668] God's Word says in Ephesians 4, "Be equipped.
[time=2671] I play my part, you play your part, so that you can serve."
[time=2678] God's Word says here in Ephesians 4 that you are to be equipped and you are to be serving.
[time=2684] That's right.
[time=2686] We talk about equipping here, it's one of our five E's.
[time=2688] We say you clearly taught to uniquely serve, clearly taught to uniquely serve.
[time=2696] It's what the body of Christ does people.
[time=2699] They serve, they extend themselves, they roll up their sleeves, and they give themselves,
[time=2705] because something's been given to them.
[time=2708] Paul applauded the efforts of the church at Thessalonica, says in 1 Thessalonians 1, we
[time=2714] saw this in our study of 1 Thessalonians, says in 1 Thessalonians 1, verses 2 and 3.
[time=2720] It'll come up on the screen here for you.
[time=2722] We give thanks to God always for all of you, making mention of you in our prayers, constantly bearing in mind your work of faith and your labor of love, instead fastness of hope in
[time=2735] our Lord Jesus Christ, in the presence of our God and Father.
[time=2739] Look how Paul said it to the church at Corinth in 1 Corinthians 12, speaking to this very issue, he says, "For even as the body is one and yet has many members, all of us play
[time=2751] a different part, all of us have been given a different opportunity.
[time=2755] There's so much to be done, and you, and you, and you, and you, and you, and we have been uniquely gifted to go and give ourselves, and all the members of the body, though they
[time=2765] are many, are one body, so also is Christ.
[time=2768] It goes on in verse 14 to say, "For the body is not one member, but many." And then it gives an interesting analogy in verse 15, it goes on and says, "If the foot says, 'Because I am not a hand, I am not a part of the body,' it is not for this reason, any the less a part of the body.
[time=2783] And if the ear says, 'Because I am not an eye, I am not a part of the body,' it is not for this reason, any the less a part of the body.
[time=2791] If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be?
[time=2794] If the whole were hearing, where would the sense of smell be?
[time=2798] But now God has placed the members, each one of them in the body, just as he desired,
[time=2806] just as he desired.
[time=2811] You giving, not just getting.
[time=2815] You delivering, in essence the one product, the one thing that represents the answer to
[time=2823] a lost and dying world.
[time=2826] You being willing, not to be a consumer, but a deliverer of that which is true and right.
[time=2833] I'll tell you what, we need a lot of help in that arena.
[time=2837] You've been hearing us for weeks talk about the children's ministry situation.
[time=2841] It's true there is a need there.
[time=2843] We need help with kids, we need help with students, we need help with neighbor link, we have an opportunity we told you about earlier to go and serve those outside these four walls.
[time=2853] And we're very committed to doing that.
[time=2855] We need to take care of those inside these four walls, but there are serving opportunities.
[time=2860] You want to sing?
[time=2861] Come sing.
[time=2862] You want to play?
[time=2863] Come play.
[time=2864] You want to do video?
[time=2865] Come do video.
[time=2866] You want to greet?
[time=2867] Go greet.
[time=2868] You want to go out in the parking lot and greet.
[time=2869] We need your help.
[time=2870] You want to count?
[time=2871] We'll let you count.
[time=2872] Our help in the office will let you are the church and God calls you to be equipped so
[time=2879] you can do the work of service.
[time=2883] Do you know how hard it was for me this morning?
[time=2886] Most of you who know me would know how hard it is for me to stand out through those doors this morning and watch with my own eyes, saw it with my own eyes and I've seen it before.
[time=2895] To see people drive up, walk in through these doors, take their kids up to a class that isn't
[time=2901] opened, walk right back down through those doors into their car and drive away.
[time=2908] And for six weeks I've been asking for 25 people.
[time=2920] There's over 2,000 people in this place, many of whom shouldn't be the 25.
[time=2930] There's 25 of you though, who should have been?
[time=2934] And schedules may need to be altered, that's true.
[time=2938] Sacrifices may need to be made, that's true.
[time=2944] And you can just put the kids aside for us.
[time=2945] We need help with student ministries.
[time=2948] People, these kids, whether they're 7 or 17, are facing a world that we've got to do the
[time=2956] best we can do, to love, invest in them and prepare them for what's ahead.
[time=2965] And so I don't know, I just leave it with the Lord to do in your heart what I believe
[time=2971] the Lord can do in your heart.
[time=2973] There are some of you here who should have and still can help, color a picture, help
[time=2980] teach a story, help sing a song.
[time=2982] Others of you need to help a 16 year old think through by leading a small group the issues of adolescents.
[time=2989] Some of you can help in other arenas, but that's how God designed it.
[time=2994] For the church to be equipped, for the church to be serving, so that the church can be strong.
[time=3000] See that last thing there, Ephesians 4, 11, 12, for the equipping of the saints, for the
[time=3006] work of service to the building up of the body of Christ.
[time=3010] You see that last phrase there, it's kind of a causatory thing.
[time=3013] When you are, when I sit myself in the chair for 20 to 25 hours a week and with integrity come before you and bring you something from the Word of God that you can take and digest and the Spirit can work new things in you with.
[time=3025] And you come and you listen and you come and you take it in and you come and we both then on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday continue from the Word of God to be equipped.
[time=3034] See when we're equipping and then you're going and you're serving, when those two things
[time=3040] happen in the Greek here, as you look at this passage, it's clear that the equipping of the saints and the working of service leads to the building up of the body.
[time=3050] That phrase there talks about the church becoming strong.
[time=3053] And guess what people in today's culture in this world, the church needs to be strong.
[time=3059] But I can't make it strong by myself.
[time=3063] The people that get checks can't make it strong, you have to make it strong by doing the work
[time=3072] of service.
[time=3075] And that's just how he designed it, that's just how he planned it.
[time=3079] And you know what?
[time=3080] I couldn't think, I can't think of anything.
[time=3083] I would rather be a part of, I can't think of anything I'd rather give myself to because in the midst of all of that, whether it's with a 5-year-old or a 17-year-old or in the technical arena or in preparing food or in helping in the office or teaching a Bible study, we
[time=3099] get to invite people to the one answer that exists in all this world, the person of Jesus
[time=3106] Christ.
[time=3106] We get to say in essence, "Come and find hope, come and find life."
[time=3112] And Joy and Corbin are going to come now and sing and please don't leave, just take a few minutes here as we close up and let me just invite you as they bring this last offering
[time=3125] of worship to our God and to you this morning.
[time=3127] I just pray that you would today as you listen, that you would, A, number one, think in your
[time=3134] heart, you know, are you doing what you can do?
[time=3138] Are you in essence being the church?
[time=3140] It's what the world needs.
[time=3141] The world today needs us to be the church so that the one answer, faith in Christ, can
[time=3147] be powerfully proclaimed.
[time=3150] And then as she sings, just be so very thankful that this is the message we get to bring, that this is the truth that we get to deliver, that in Jesus Christ there is not only great
[time=3161] hope for today, but oh my goodness, the promise of eternity.
[time=3165] We encourage it as you listen.
[time=3179] We can wound it soon, lost to have to die, raise your hair, and love is passing by.
[time=3200] Come to Jesus, come to Jesus, come to Jesus, come to Jesus, and live.
[time=3217] Now your burdens lifted and carried far away, and precious blood is washed away this day.
[time=3230] So sing to Jesus, sing to Jesus, sing to Jesus, and live.
[time=3252] Like a new one, baby, don't be afraid to cry, and remember when you walk sometimes we fall.
[time=3267] So fall on Jesus, fall on Jesus, fall on Jesus, and live.
[time=3281] Sometimes the way is lonely and steep and filled with pain.
[time=3292] So if your sky is dark and pours the rain, then cry to Jesus, cry to Jesus, cry to Jesus,
[time=3308] and live.
[time=3318] Oh, and when the love spills over, and music fails tonight, when you can't contain your
[time=3332] joy inside, then dance for Jesus, dance for Jesus, dance for Jesus.
[time=3349] And with your final heartbeat, kiss the world goodbye, then go in peace and laugh on glory
[time=3369] and fly to Jesus, fly to Jesus, fly to Jesus, and live, fly to Jesus, fly to Jesus, fly
[time=3397] to Jesus, and live.
[time=3407] Amen, would you stand and pray with me as we go, Father?
[time=3421] That is the message that you have entrusted to us, the message of life in Jesus.
[time=3427] And God, we know that it's true, and we know there are so many.
[time=3432] There are so many who have yet to embrace that truth.
[time=3438] And we know them, and we live with them, and we work with them.
[time=3443] And because we know what it's like to have lived without that, because we know what it's like to have been lost, God, I pray that we would, as the church, be the church, and carry
[time=3454] that message in humility, carry that message with courage, God that we would carry that message boldly into those you bring across our path into this world, God that you've placed
[time=3465] us in.
[time=3466] Father, we thank you.
[time=3468] We think of those today who lost loved ones.
[time=3473] We think of those who gave their lives.
[time=3477] September 11, three years ago, we think of the impact that still continues to have in the hearts and lives and families of so many.
[time=3485] Our mind goes across the sea today, to families in Russia still trying to cope with the utter
[time=3491] devastation and loss of family and friends.
[time=3497] God as brutal acts of terror continue to take place, God give us the strength to respond
[time=3503] with acts of loving kindness, acts of service, a service and a love God based in our relationship
[time=3511] with you and our belief that for some reason you've given us the privileged opportunity
[time=3517] to reach into that very world and make a difference for you.
[time=3522] And so God strengthen us for that task and we'll look forward to it in your son's name we pray.
[time=3527] [AMEN]
[time=3541] Thank you.
[time=3571] of the Lord.
[time=3573] [AMEN - 28 seconds]
