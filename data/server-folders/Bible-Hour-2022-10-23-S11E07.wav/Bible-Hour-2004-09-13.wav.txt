[time=382] (audience applauding) - Hi, my name's Kelly Bird, and I have the privilege of serving as the pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries.
[time=392] And I want to welcome you to the Bible Hour.
[time=394] What a great privilege it is.
[time=396] You may be joining us for the first time here on the broadcast, or you may be part of the family.
[time=402] Either way, we are so thankful that we get to come and spend this time with you again this week.
[time=407] We just started a brand new series.
[time=409] You're gonna see the first installment of what will be an eight week series entitled "Navigating Through the Storms of Life." And this is going to be a careful look at the topic of the wisdom of God.
[time=423] You and I do in our very best with His help to find and understand the wisdom of God as we face all these different situations and circumstances that you and I both know life brings our way.
[time=437] And when you talk about God's wisdom, and when you talk about the ability to face all that life brings and make decisions and choices that honor Him, you can't help but think about the book of Proverbs.
[time=449] And that's where we will begin this series, and that's where we will spend these next eight weeks kind of an overview of God's wisdom found in the book of Proverbs.
[time=458] And the book of Proverbs says that the beginning of wisdom, the beginning of you and I being able to, with His help, make choices that will get us through life.
[time=470] God's Word says in Proverbs the beginning of that.
[time=473] The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the Lord.
[time=477] I want you to think about that just for a minute.
[time=480] The fear of the Lord, it says in Proverbs 1-7 is the beginning of wisdom.
[time=487] Fear, it's an interesting word.
[time=489] It doesn't mean that you and I would be necessarily or primarily afraid of God like He was going to hit us or something.
[time=496] No, that word in the Hebrew fear there meant a deep sense of awe and a deep and passionate sense of respect.
[time=504] There would be this great sense that He being God is so much bigger, so much greater, so much wiser, so much more than we are that we would look at Him and in our awe and reverence be willing and ready and quick to learn from Him.
[time=524] They said that when Michael Jordan would walk into a room, better yet when he would walk into practice, there have been countless stories told.
[time=535] Whether it was a rookie or whether it was a seasoned veteran, that there may have been debate going on about this or that.
[time=543] There may have been discussion taking place about why they were playing the way they were playing as a team or what went wrong in the last minute of the last game, but the story has been told again and again that when Michael Jordan would walk into the room, when he would enter the practice facility, when he would speak, when he would address the team, when he would make a comment to a teammate, they listened because it was Mike and because he was who he was and because he had accomplished what he had accomplished and because it was known by every single person on Earth that there wasn't anybody better.
[time=583] And so when he led and when he spoke, when he pointed this out, when he made a correction, they listened.
[time=591] And though Michael Jordan in the basketball realm is a decent illustration, he doesn't even compare to the greatness and the otherness of our God and it is with God, the Scriptures teaches that you and I get to begin to understand and glean what is wise.
[time=609] There are so many things out there, so many avenues whereby you and I are being told that wisdom is available.
[time=617] God's word says it begins with him and our respect of him, so I invite you to join us today and in the weeks to come, as we better understand how it is we're going to make our way through this life with the wisdom of God which begins with a respect for God.
[time=633] We hope you'll tune in, we hope you'll come by and see us.
[time=636] We'd love to meet you more than anything else.
[time=638] I hope you'll open your heart to the truth that God will have for you today.
[time=642] Hope to see you soon.
[time=644] Lord of Lords, you are Lord of Lords, you are King of Kings, you are Nightingah, Lord of everything, you're Emmanuel, you're the Great I Am, you're the Prince of Peace, you is the Lamb, you're the Living God, you're my saving grace, you will reign forever, you are ancient of things, you are Alpha Omega, beginning and end.
[time=678] You're my Savior, the Staya, regular and friend, you're my Prince of Peace, and I will live my life for you.
[time=690] You're my Prince of Peace, and I will live my life for you.
[time=699] [AMEN] (Applause)
[time=710] Fear of the Lord.
[time=714] Fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.
[time=717] But fools.
[time=718] Fools.
[time=719] Dispise wisdom and discipline.
[time=721] Blessed is he who trusts in the Lord.
[time=724] He holds victory in store for the upright.
[time=727] He is a shield.
[time=728] A shield.
[time=729] To those whose walk is blameless.
[time=731] Blameless.
[time=732] My son.
[time=733] Do not forget my teaching.
[time=735] But keep my commands in your heart.
[time=737] Trust in the Lord with all of your heart.
[time=739] And lay not on your own.
[time=741] Understanding.
[time=742] In all of your ways.
[time=743] Acknowledge him.
[time=744] And he will make your.
[time=746] Pass straight.
[time=748] Above all else.
[time=749] Guard your heart.
[time=751] For it is the wellspring of life.
[time=753] When words.
[time=754] Words.
[time=755] Many sin is not absent.
[time=757] But he who holds his tongue is wise.
[time=759] Make plans by seeking advice.
[time=762] Blessed is he who trusts in the Lord.
[time=765] Of what uses money in the hands of a fool.
[time=768] He who is generous to others lends to the Lord.
[time=772] He who loves a quarrel loves sin.
[time=774] Every fool is quick to quarrel.
[time=777] A cheerful heart is good medicine.
[time=780] A friend loves at all times.
[time=782] He who gives to the poor will lack nothing.
[time=785] Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves.
[time=789] Do not withhold discipline from a child.
[time=791] Punish him with the rod and save his soul from death.
[time=795] A discerning man keeps wisdom in view.
[time=798] The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.
[time=801] Blessed are those who keep my ways.
[time=803] Blessed are those who listen to me.
[time=805] Those who seek me find me.
[time=807] Blessed is he who trusts in the Lord.
[time=810] For the Lord will be your confidence.
[time=813] He will keep your foot from being snared.
[time=815] Your foot will not stumble.
[time=817] When you lie down you will not be afraid.
[time=820] Have no fear.
[time=822] Do not forsake my teaching.
[time=824] Keep my commands and you will live.
[time=826] Listen my son and accept what I say.
[time=829] Do not forsake wisdom.
[time=831] Blessed is he who trusts in the Lord.
[time=841] I want to say welcome to all of you who are here this morning.
[time=844] My name is Kelly.
[time=845] For those of you who I don't know I have the privilege of serving as pastor here at Blackhawk.
[time=851] To my left is my good friend and another one of our teaching pastors Dr. Mitchell Cruz.
[time=856] We are so thankful to get to have this opportunity with you this morning as we begin a new series.
[time=862] Before we do that I wanted to say a couple of things real quick.
[time=865] Number one I want to thank Pastor Rafael Colom, Lisa Wright, Barb Ballschmidt and Lori Bland
[time=871] for their tireless effort in recent weeks in getting these classes open.
[time=876] Would you guys please thank that team.
[time=879] What an amazing team we have of people who love your kids passionately and they have worked so hard
[time=890] and gone so far above and beyond.
[time=893] It's not even funny.
[time=895] I'm so grateful for them and the work that they've given.
[time=898] I also want to just make sure I mentioned to all of you ladies that each one, reach one autumn tea is coming up I believe next Saturday from nine to eleven thirty.
[time=908] You'll really want to be a part of that.
[time=910] Ladies go out to the table today on your way out if you haven't already and sign up for that.
[time=915] A great great opportunity for you to bring a friend.
[time=918] Stephen Maria Gardner will be leading in special music and Maria will also be sharing from her heart
[time=925] the secrets of grace.
[time=927] The secrets of grace that God has brought to her life through loss, grief and difficult times.
[time=934] And you'll be blessed and encouraged because of your time there with them.
[time=939] Saturday morning September 25th, nine to eleven thirty right here in the worship center for you.
[time=945] So make sure you sign up for that.
[time=949] Well somebody, somebody says something or does something mean malicious or hurtful
[time=958] and you're ready to fire back.
[time=962] What should you do?
[time=965] You're lonely in your marriage angry and very dissatisfied and suddenly a meter get better acquainted with another woman who stirs something deep in your soul that hasn't been stirred in years.
[time=978] What should you do?
[time=981] You get the chance to make a little extra money, a little extra cash, some extra cash that would really, really help.
[time=990] And all it's going to take is a slightly dishonest decision that no one will ever know about.
[time=997] I mean come on, what are you going to do?
[time=1001] How will you choose?
[time=1003] You've been offered a job that would require you to move away from family, from friends and all that you've known most of your life.
[time=1010] What should you do?
[time=1013] Your twelve to eighteen month old is starting to exercise their own will.
[time=1019] Defying your requests to finish eating, stop hitting or even come here.
[time=1025] He or she is saying no more loudly and throwing fits with increasing frequency.
[time=1032] What is a mom or dad going to do?
[time=1037] You're a high school or middle school student and it seems like the only group of students that pay attention to you,
[time=1043] the only ones that are halfway nice to you are the ones who will more than likely lead you into a lot of trouble.
[time=1050] So it feels like you either have no friends or the wrong friends.
[time=1054] What should you do?
[time=1057] Your oldest child is five and it's time to go to school.
[time=1061] What kind of school will you send him to?
[time=1064] Christian school, public school, home school, life is full of choices.
[time=1071] You see, conflict, literally, con means together.
[time=1078] Flicked is from the Latin flagra means to strike together, to strike together.
[time=1083] It's literally two objects trying to occupy the same space at the same time.
[time=1090] And sometimes conflict is good.
[time=1093] Lifting weights build your body.
[time=1095] Sometimes conflict is bad, but in any event, conflict brings a choice.
[time=1100] And if we're going to navigate through the storms of life, through the conflicts of life,
[time=1106] we're going to be dealt opportunities to make a choice.
[time=1110] And those choices are either going to be wise or they're going to be foolish.
[time=1116] And so we have the book of Proverbs, written by Solomon, who is king of Israel.
[time=1121] And Solomon in 1 Kings 3, God comes and says, Solomon, you can have whatever you want.
[time=1127] And Solomon says, you know, I'm paraphrasing, you know that this is this life and these
[time=1133] people, they're full of conflict.
[time=1138] And you know what?
[time=1139] I'm going to need wisdom in order to give them good choices.
[time=1145] Would you please give me wisdom?
[time=1147] Help me to discern in the conflict.
[time=1150] And it says, God gave him wisdom.
[time=1152] And so Solomon wrote about a thousand of these that we have in Proverbs.
[time=1157] He wrote more.
[time=1158] There about a thousand of these that we have in Proverbs, these sayings.
[time=1161] And Proverbs means generally true most of the time.
[time=1165] Generally true most of the time.
[time=1167] So generally true most of the time, this is going to work because we live in conflict, because we live in a fallen world, because sinful people have a ripple effect.
[time=1176] Sometimes it's not going to work.
[time=1178] Example, train up a child in the way he should go and he will not depart from it.
[time=1186] Well, sometimes they do.
[time=1187] Right?
[time=1189] But it doesn't mean we shouldn't train up a child in the way he should go in a relationship with God.
[time=1195] So conflict, the storms of life bring choices.
[time=1199] And our choices are either going to be wise or foolish.
[time=1204] Wisdom, write this down, wisdom is applying God's righteousness or God's heart with street
[time=1211] smarts, applying God's heart or God's heart righteousness with street smarts, applying
[time=1218] those two things together, applying literally means to make sticky.
[time=1222] So how in the world are we going to stick God's mind, God's heart, God's righteousness
[time=1228] to our fallen situations?
[time=1236] And as we jump into this study of wisdom, as we jump into this study of the book of Proverbs,
[time=1244] there is a theme that is established at the very beginning of the book.
[time=1249] And I want to draw your attention to it.
[time=1251] If you would turn to Proverbs chapter 1 verse 7, what we see in Proverbs chapter 1 verse 7, we see again and again and again in this great book, in this collection of wise sayings.
[time=1265] And what we see there in Proverbs chapter 1 verse 7 really is a theme.
[time=1269] It really is a great truth that kind of underlines the entire book.
[time=1274] Again and again, you see Solomon coming back to this notion of the fear of the Lord being the beginning of knowledge.
[time=1281] I want you to look at that with me, it says there the fear of the Lord, Proverbs 1-7, the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, fools despise wisdom and instruction.
[time=1294] Why don't you read that with me out loud, let's do it again.
[time=1299] The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, fools despise wisdom and instruction.
[time=1308] And I want you to miss that.
[time=1310] I want you this morning to begin some of you for the very first time maybe to have a working
[time=1316] understanding and definition of what that means.
[time=1319] You see it's the overarching theme of this entire book and it is one of life's spiritual lessons that you and I must learn.
[time=1328] Let's talk about it just for a moment.
[time=1331] What is this idea of fear?
[time=1334] God's word says to you and I today that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.
[time=1343] Having come to know him, we must possess a deep reverence for him.
[time=1348] If you want to take notes this morning on this idea of this overarching theme and the fear of the Lord being the beginning of knowledge under fear, just write that down, a deep reverence
[time=1360] for him.
[time=1361] To fear the Lord is to be in awe of him.
[time=1366] Let me say that to you again.
[time=1369] To fear the Lord is to be in awe of him.
[time=1374] It's not that he's going to hurt you, no, it is a submissive fear and passionate respect
[time=1381] that lives daily with the realization that he is completely other.
[time=1387] He is completely bigger.
[time=1396] You with me?
[time=1399] Now people, these are words and these are phrases.
[time=1402] We sometimes throw around kind of lightly and I want you this morning to kind of maybe grab on to this in a new way.
[time=1410] See your readiness and mind, our preparedness to face this life, making choices that will
[time=1418] allow us to move through it in a way that honors God.
[time=1421] It all begins with our view of him.
[time=1427] Solomon says here in one seven, the beginning of it all is the fear of the Lord.
[time=1432] This deep reverential respect is passionate, unbending, submissive fear that realizes who
[time=1446] he is and we won't grow in knowledge, we won't gain in understanding, we won't find wisdom
[time=1454] unless our view of him, unless our understanding of him is marked by this kind of awe and fear.
[time=1462] Do you understand that?
[time=1466] If he's just one of many opinions, then who cares?
[time=1475] I mean he's either it or he's just one of many.
[time=1478] If he's just one of many gods, why would I fully surrender my heart and life to him?
[time=1483] If his word is no different than any other writings, why should I listen?
[time=1489] But you see, when I come to the place of admission that he is the one true God, that his word
[time=1495] is the one true word, worthy of my love and devotion, my praise, my awe and my honor,
[time=1502] see when I come to that place everything changes.
[time=1507] And if you were going to conclude kind of wrap up Proverbs chapter 1 verse 7, I would
[time=1513] say it to you this way, don't be foolish.
[time=1517] Be wise.
[time=1520] Don't be a fool.
[time=1523] Be one marked by characterized by wisdom.
[time=1528] And that's what this book gives us now.
[time=1529] We'd be here for five years if we went through this book one verse at a time.
[time=1534] And the great thing about Proverbs is back towards the end, I think picking up around chapter 22, you find a very unique section of Proverbs called the 30 sayings of the wise.
[time=1547] And Mitch is going to tell you a little bit about that.
[time=1549] That's going to kind of form the foundation of our study, those 30 sayings in the weeks to come.
[time=1555] See conflicts of life, the storms of life bring choices.
[time=1559] And our choices are going to be either wise or they're going to be foolish.
[time=1563] See Solomon wanted to pass the wisdom on to the people and about 3,000 years later, not
[time=1570] much has changed in our nature so they're really relevant for us today.
[time=1574] And you know, we got to be careful because left ourselves were foolish.
[time=1579] Just picture yourself, it's your favorite fast food restaurant and you get this big two
[time=1588] patties, a half pound of beef and you got the cheese kind of dripping off of it.
[time=1596] Maybe that's the grease, okay?
[time=1598] And you got the fries, right?
[time=1602] Can there be bacon on the burger?
[time=1603] Let's put bacon on the burger.
[time=1605] There you go.
[time=1607] But with no onion, no.
[time=1609] And we have the fries and we got a big hot fudge malt.
[time=1618] And we supersized it all.
[time=1621] And we sit in front of it and we fold our hands and we say, oh God, please bless this food to my body's nourishment.
[time=1631] That's what we do.
[time=1635] Wisdom deals with what's sitting in front of us, making wise choices about that tension.
[time=1640] That would be recreational eating.
[time=1642] And I think we should do that especially on Sundays, okay?
[time=1646] And this, oh God, please help me win the lottery, oh God, please help me win the lottery.
[time=1656] But you never buy a ticket.
[time=1660] Anybody would tell you, if you want to win the lottery, you need to buy a ticket.
[time=1663] I am not telling you to buy a lottery ticket.
[time=1665] I want you to know that.
[time=1666] That's an illustration that shows us how left to ourselves we are just foolish.
[time=1670] And so we need these 30 sayings of the wise.
[time=1673] So if you turn your Bibles to Proverbs 22, verse 17, we're going to look at today the
[time=1680] introduction to the 30 sayings of the wise.
[time=1685] And it's really cool because he's going to say, listen, listen to the sayings of the wise.
[time=1695] Learn the sayings of the wise.
[time=1700] So write that down.
[time=1701] Listen to the sayings of the wise.
[time=1706] I'll write this down.
[time=1708] But lean on God.
[time=1711] See, not the sayings of the wise, don't lean on the sayings of the wise, don't lean on
[time=1717] your understanding of the sayings of the wise.
[time=1719] They are a means to lean, to trust God.
[time=1726] And if you don't get that, that's where it breaks down by definition.
[time=1730] And so what we're going to study over the next seven weeks, we're going to see how the 30 sayings of the wise, there are sayings in there that apply to finances.
[time=1737] Listen, learn, but lean on God when it comes to finances.
[time=1740] We're going to look at friends, listen, learn, but lean on God when it comes to these sayings about your friends, about your family, about faith, about fools, about failure, about your
[time=1751] future.
[time=1752] Listen to the sayings.
[time=1754] Learn the sayings, but lean on God.
[time=1760] And Kelly's going to unpack it there in verse 17, listen to the sayings.
[time=1765] Here we go, the first three verses, an introduction to the 30 sayings of the wise and three very important verses, three very important truths as we start our study this morning.
[time=1777] Number one, we hope that you will in the next eight weeks, we hope that you will even after that be somebody who listens to the sayings, who listens to what's true, who inclines your
[time=1790] ear to wisdom, verse 17, incline your ear and hear the words of the wise and apply your
[time=1799] mind to my knowledge.
[time=1802] People you know what I would encourage you to pick up the book of Proverbs this week and begin to read through it.
[time=1807] You will see as I did this past week that again and again and again from Proverbs 1 all the way back through 31, you see it, you see it again and again and again, three, four, five,
[time=1819] six times per page, incline your ear, he says, take heed to my words, he says, listen to
[time=1828] my words, incline your ear again and again and again.
[time=1834] And I want to invite you this morning, Mitch and I want to just extend an invitation to you.
[time=1839] We hope that you do this maybe all the time, but maybe with these next several weeks in view, we can just say it to you this way.
[time=1845] Maybe you would be willing, maybe you're ready today.
[time=1852] I don't know all of you, but I know some of you and I know the circumstances that you face.
[time=1858] I know the situations that you're in.
[time=1861] I know some of the decisions that you're having to make and I would invite you, we would stand
[time=1869] here today and beg you to, in the next seven weeks, listen, listen to what's true, listen
[time=1881] to what's wise, listen to what God's Word will have for you, pay attention, sit somewhere
[time=1888] else, pick a new seat maybe, come in next Sunday and sit somewhere new and get a new
[time=1894] vantage point, but kind of draw a line in the sand and put a stake in the ground and
[time=1900] incline your ear in a way you never have before.
[time=1906] Be here, open your hearts and minds to the wisdom and direction of God.
[time=1910] Many of you in the room need it.
[time=1914] And as you read through Proverbs, what we see there in 22, 17, we see elsewhere and we
[time=1921] see all kinds of issues.
[time=1924] We see listening tied to all kinds of issues.
[time=1929] We see listening tied to finances, we see listening tied to our future and future issues.
[time=1935] We see listening connected to family and its health.
[time=1940] We take you to Proverbs 5 though and show you an issue that it addresses there where
[time=1946] your willingness and mind to listen is so very important.
[time=1953] It says in Proverbs 5, 1, "My son, give attention to my wisdom," there you go, "encline your
[time=1960] ear to my understanding." And then in verse 7 it says, "Now then my sons listen to me and do not depart from the
[time=1970] words of my mouth.
[time=1972] Keep your way far from her and do not go near the door of her house or you will give your
[time=1979] vigor to others and your years to the cruel one and strangers will be filled with your
[time=1985] strength and your hard-earned goods will go to the house of an alien and you groan at your final end when your flesh and your body are consumed and you say, "How?
[time=1997] How is it that I've gotten to this place?
[time=2000] How have I hated instruction and my heart spurned reproof?" Here you go.
[time=2006] Answer, "I have not listened to the voice of my teachers nor inclined my ear to my instructors."
[time=2020] I'm reminded of John, John 10.25, I believe it will be on the screen.
[time=2027] John 10.25 says, "Jesus answered them, 'I told you and you do not believe.'"
[time=2033] The works that I do in my father's name, these testify to me.
[time=2037] And in 26 he says, "But you do not believe because you are not of my sheep."
[time=2043] Here you go.
[time=2044] My sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me.
[time=2053] Listening there, listening there in that case, listed as one of the specific characteristics
[time=2060] of those that know him, those that follow him.
[time=2065] If you know him, you listen to him.
[time=2069] Listening.
[time=2070] It's very, very important, right?
[time=2074] I mean, I can just take you into the everyday of my own home.
[time=2077] You could take me into the everyday of your own home.
[time=2080] We go through a routine like this often where I might say something like this.
[time=2084] I might be talking to my son, my oldest son.
[time=2086] It could be one of my older daughters and I might say, "Hey, you know what?
[time=2089] When you're done with that, I need you to take the garbage out to the street."
[time=2095] And I'll notice, as you often notice, that they may not have caught that.
[time=2099] So what we'll oftentimes do is say, "Hey, stop.
[time=2103] First of all, look at me.
[time=2107] Are we looking at me?" All right.
[time=2109] Now stop what you're doing, right?
[time=2112] And when you're done doing what you're doing right now, I'd like you to take the garbage down to the end of the driveway.
[time=2120] And I'll say, "Did you hear me?" And they'll say, "Yes." And I'll say, "Say it back to me." Well, when I'm done doing this, you want me to take the garbage down in the driveway.
[time=2132] And you know what?
[time=2133] Most of the time it goes pretty well.
[time=2136] Sometimes it doesn't.
[time=2139] And I'll have to come back and I'll inevitably say, "What did I say?"
[time=2149] And oftentimes what went kind of haywire there is they weren't really listening.
[time=2157] And you and I, we get held accountable to the degree to which we listen.
[time=2165] Remember our theme verse, Proverbs 1-7, just a few minutes ago.
[time=2169] You haven't forgotten it yet, have you?
[time=2172] Fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.
[time=2175] Interesting, that first phrase there, the fear of the Lord.
[time=2181] People don't forget this.
[time=2182] Respectful, I'm in awe of you, God kind of heart.
[time=2187] It's soft, it listens, it's soft.
[time=2193] Fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.
[time=2197] That's a soft heart that's in awe of God.
[time=2201] And in that posture, it listens.
[time=2206] You might say, "Hey Mitch, I've heard you say that fear not is the most frequent command written in the Bible, fear not, fear not." And then we get to Proverbs and it says, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, so what's the deal?" And it's real simple, fear of the Lord is trust.
[time=2221] Fear not is, don't distrust God.
[time=2225] You know what I say, don't be afraid, fear not, don't distrust God and fear of the Lord is trusting God.
[time=2230] Fear not is a slave like fear, a fear that God will stay.
[time=2237] Fear of the Lord is a son to father like fear, fear that he will go away.
[time=2243] And so if we have a soft heart and we listen, what we're going to see next is that we learn.
[time=2248] We learn.
[time=2250] So look at verse 18, chapter 22, verse 18, "For it will be pleasant if you keep them within you." This is a military picture.
[time=2257] "If you keep them within you, within is the core of your belly, that they may be ready on your lips, idea, unless they get in, they're not coming out.
[time=2269] Don't just think you're going to hear these things and all of a sudden your life will be changed.
[time=2273] You have to do something to learn these things, okay?
[time=2280] Let's look at Proverbs 2, verses 1 through 5, Proverbs 2 verses 1 through 5.
[time=2286] We're going to see something here and we're going to learn it, okay?
[time=2291] My son, if you receive my sayings and treasure my commandments within you, make your ear
[time=2298] attentive to wisdom, incline your heart to understanding.
[time=2304] For if you cry for discernment and lift up your voice for understanding, if you seek her as silver and search for her as for hidden treasures, then you will discern the fear
[time=2316] of the Lord and discover the knowledge of God, for the Lord gives wisdom and from his
[time=2322] mouth come knowledge and understanding, "Oh, we got a loop.
[time=2326] What's the fear of the Lord, the fear of the Lord's beginning of knowledge?" But I loop back around after I read this and I come back to the fear of the Lord.
[time=2336] So let's just learn a little bit about that loop, all right?
[time=2339] We're going to do an illustration and we're going to use the three ways that we learn
[time=2346] to learn this, okay?
[time=2348] And what are the three ways we learn?
[time=2350] We learn by hearing, by seeing and by doing.
[time=2355] You guys are good.
[time=2357] See, but it all begins.
[time=2358] We just learn with the fear of the Lord.
[time=2364] We got a cycle here that we're going to talk about and I'll just put a cross here.
[time=2367] It's kind of our picture where it all begins of the fear of the Lord.
[time=2370] That's where it all begins to get in the cycle.
[time=2373] And we learn that wisdom, we're in Proverbs 2, that we're supposed to lend our what to
[time=2381] wisdom, bend our ear to wisdom.
[time=2383] So I learn first hour, I can't draw an ear.
[time=2386] Why don't you draw this with me, by the way, okay?
[time=2388] So that's an ear, something like that, okay?
[time=2393] Ear and wisdom, let's link the two, all right?
[time=2395] Let's link the two.
[time=2399] Remember that you're dumb if you don't have wisdom.
[time=2405] See wisdom, wisp, wisp is like whisper and dumb, dumb, okay?
[time=2409] Whisper that you're, this is somebody whispering that you're dumb if you don't have wisdom.
[time=2413] And we're hearing that with our ears, right?
[time=2415] Are you with me?
[time=2416] All right.
[time=2417] So, then it says, in chapter 2, it says, "Understanding," it says, you know, soften your
[time=2427] heart and climb your heart to understanding.
[time=2432] So what I'm going to do is I'm going to draw a guy standing, understanding, under the understanding,
[time=2439] okay?
[time=2440] And I'm going to draw a big heart on him.
[time=2443] So you guys do that, draw a big heart, I'm going to make him happy, and he's under understanding,
[time=2449] okay?
[time=2450] Does that make sense?
[time=2452] And what's in your heart is what you do with your life, right?
[time=2459] So what's he doing?
[time=2460] He's standing under understanding, right?
[time=2462] And he's got a big heart, so we're supposed to incline our heart to understanding.
[time=2466] Our ear to wisdom, there's a voice whispering that you're dumb if you don't have wisdom,
[time=2473] okay?
[time=2474] And we apply our heart and climb our heart to understanding the man standing, understanding.
[time=2478] So then it says, what's the last part of learning we haven't used yet?
[time=2484] Eyes, it says, seek for knowledge, go looking for the knowledge, seek it out, and you'll
[time=2490] discover it.
[time=2492] And so what I want to do is I'm going to draw a guy standing on the ledge.
[time=2498] He's on a gnoll that's right on the edge, gnoll edge, knowledge.
[time=2507] It's got to be a little out there, or you can't remember it.
[time=2510] Give that guy some arms, man.
[time=2512] Okay, hold it.
[time=2513] But we're emphasizing the eyes.
[time=2515] He looks like a tadpole.
[time=2518] So I put big eyes on him, okay?
[time=2521] So I put big eyes on him, and we learn that when we see this knowledge that we're looking for, we discover the fear of the Lord.
[time=2528] But we also have learned in Proverbs that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, that the cycle goes both ways, and when I have knowledge, knowledge is experiencing the facts of God.
[time=2538] I want to write that down.
[time=2540] Knowledge is experiencing the facts of God.
[time=2542] Understanding would be comprehending the facts, comprehending God.
[time=2548] Experiencing God, comprehending God, or these sayings, wisdom is applying the facts, making
[time=2557] them sticky, making the relationship with God sticky to my simple life.
[time=2561] And when I do that, I will find the fear of the Lord.
[time=2563] Maybe it's a cycle, Proverbs 9, 10 says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.
[time=2569] Well my uncle taught me the 30 sayings when my life was a mess, it was one of the first things he ever taught me, and he said, Mitchell, if you don't learn them, you'll never be able
[time=2580] to apply them to your life.
[time=2582] And so I've been doing stuff like this with the Bible my whole life, and what we're going to do is offer you an opportunity the next seven weeks to have some catchy sayings that
[time=2593] go with each of the 30 sayings.
[time=2595] So maybe have some images or some illustrations for you to remember them and to learn them.
[time=2599] We're going to ask you every week to learn them so that you can apply them to your life.
[time=2607] Proverbs 22, 17, incline your ear and hear, listen to the sayings.
[time=2615] Mitchell just talked to you about verse 18 for it will be pleasant if you keep them within you that they may be ready on your lips.
[time=2623] Learn the sayings so that number 19 so that your trust may be in the Lord.
[time=2632] I have taught you today even you so that your trust may be in the Lord.
[time=2640] What a great truth.
[time=2643] The life changing concept, what an amazing thing for you and I, that we hear the phrase
[time=2650] often, that we've read about it, that we sing about it.
[time=2655] What an amazing truth for you and I to consider this morning.
[time=2658] Our trust, our willingness to lean into or on him.
[time=2664] Look at Proverbs chapter three.
[time=2668] Solomon talks about this concept of leaning on him, trusting on or in him, often throughout
[time=2674] the book.
[time=2675] Maybe the best known passage is the passage we find in Proverbs three, five and six.
[time=2680] And I want to take you here because I want to remind you of what is so absolutely fundamental
[time=2686] to you and I really trusting you and I really leaning on him.
[time=2692] As you see it says there in Proverbs three, five and six, trust in the Lord with all your heart.
[time=2700] And do not lean on your own understanding.
[time=2704] In all your ways acknowledge him and he will make your paths straight.
[time=2710] Let me take you back up there to verse five.
[time=2713] You see having listened and having learned, you have the opportunity to trust him with,
[time=2720] what does your Bible say, with how much of your heart say it out loud?
[time=2726] All.
[time=2727] See people I'm convinced it really goes, it really goes amiss right there.
[time=2737] Our hearts get kind of divided.
[time=2742] Our affections begin to go in a number of different directions.
[time=2749] And we say the phrase often and we're not going to stop saying the phrase and we're going to keep doing our very best to help you understand the phrase fully surrendered.
[time=2762] Completely his, a heart that is all in.
[time=2770] Trust in the Lord it says with all your heart.
[time=2774] And speaking of lean, lean not on your own understanding.
[time=2781] You could read verse five as I can read verse five and say trust in the Lord with all your heart and don't lean on your own understanding.
[time=2789] You and I can say okay that sounds good, how do I, how do I actually do that?
[time=2793] Well here you go.
[time=2794] In all your ways acknowledge him, you understand what that means.
[time=2801] In everything that you do, everywhere that you go, in every meeting you walk into, every
[time=2810] phone conversation you're about to have, every choice you make at home, every interaction
[time=2816] with your spouse, in all of your ways.
[time=2821] 24/7 living in the presence of God, being willing and ready to choose, speak, decide,
[time=2831] conduct myself, all with the mindset of, in all your ways acknowledge him, God this is for you, God what do you want me to do, God how would you have me handle this, God please
[time=2842] help me know which way to move.
[time=2847] In all of your ways acknowledge him and he will make your paths straight when your heart
[time=2855] is completely his.
[time=2861] You know one of the tragic things, one of the most tragic things in my opinion in all
[time=2869] of scripture is that the guy who wrote Proverbs 3, 5 and 6, say his name out loud, Solomon,
[time=2876] go back to first Kings if you would, we were just, we were just here a few weeks ago in our study of Elijah, but if you go back to first Kings, go back to first Kings 11, says
[time=2890] in first Kings 11, 6, it says Solomon did what was evil, amazing.
[time=2901] Solomon did what was evil in the sight of the Lord and did not follow the Lord, what
[time=2908] does it say, fully, fully, as David his father had done.
[time=2916] See Solomon's heart wasn't completely there, and so he built a high place for Chimosh,
[time=2925] the detestable idol of Moab on the mountain which is east of Jerusalem and for Molek, the detestable idol of the sons of Amon, thus also he did for all his foreign wives who
[time=2937] burned incense and sacrificed to their gods.
[time=2941] Now the Lord was angry with Solomon because his heart was turned away, because his heart
[time=2951] was turned away from the Lord, the God of Israel who had appeared to him twice.
[time=2960] Hey, remember our theme verse, Proverbs 1, 7, "Fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[time=2969] knowledge, fools despise wisdom and instruction."
[time=2977] Proud hearts trust themselves, remember that, proud hearts trust themselves listening, learning
[time=2988] hearts lean into, lean on trust, the wisdom of God.
[time=2996] Now I was just standing down here this morning as we sang, and I was struck again as I often
[time=3004] am struck as I get the privilege of sharing these times together with you, and I can look
[time=3010] around the room and I just, I'm always thankful for this, I hope you know this.
[time=3017] I look around this room and again, some of you I know, but others of you I don't know, but I know this, I know that there are people in this room this morning and you are so grateful
[time=3029] for the life that you have with him.
[time=3032] It is going so well, you are learning and taking truth in at a record pace and his hand
[time=3041] is on your life and in some ways it couldn't be better, and there are others of you here
[time=3047] absolutely on your last breath.
[time=3052] You are just, you are just a few feet away from what feels like to you from just jumping
[time=3059] off the track.
[time=3063] There are some in here who are so discouraged, there are others in here who are so thankful
[time=3070] in this room right here, you and I are facing the storms of life and some may be in quiet
[time=3076] waters but you know the storms will come again.
[time=3080] But as we face the conflict of this world and this culture, as the enemy brings the
[time=3086] wind and the force of all that he brings, we have to be wise.
[time=3095] You and I have got to make good choices, watch this footage just for a second.
[time=3099] You know wow, what a week to be talking about the storms of life and I would invite you as you watch this to not necessarily see trees and buildings and streets flooded but the
[time=3111] lives, your life and mine and the attack, the pressure, the unbelievable energy brought
[time=3122] by the enemy in an attempt to destroy and damage you and I.
[time=3128] How will we choose as we face the storms of life?
[time=3158] And 2000 years ago, God comes in the flesh.
[time=3173] God's heart, God's life gets sticky and comes to a man's body.
[time=3179] And Jesus Christ stands on the mountainside and talks about 20,000 people and he gives what we know today is the greatest speech ever told the Sermon on the mountain, Matthew 5, 6 and 7, and Jesus concludes with something that if you grew up in the church, you grew up singing the song.
[time=3193] The wise man when these storms come built his house upon the rock, the foolish man built
[time=3202] his house on the sand.
[time=3205] If you go to Palestine, you'll know in every contractor knew this back then and they know it today that if you don't go down about 10 feet, you won't get through the sand on the surface to the bedrock on which you would build your home.
[time=3219] And storms would come out of nowhere and then when they would come and when the Jordan River Valley would flood, if you built your house on the rock, you'd still be there.
[time=3228] But if you never dug down, like everybody knew to that rock and you built your house on the sand, it was like the movie and mummy, the movie mummy where the ground just starts going up.
[time=3239] Remember, it just kind of goes out and everything starts falling into it.
[time=3241] That's the way it was.
[time=3244] And Jesus says storms of conflict and life are going to come.
[time=3251] Be wise and build your house on the rock, which was also a term for the temple.
[time=3259] Isn't that interesting?
[time=3261] Also a term for the temple.
[time=3262] He's saying lean on God.
[time=3265] Listen, Jesus says, learn these things and lean on the God of the universe and you will
[time=3272] be wise.
[time=3275] But don't, if you want to build your house on the sand, you're going to be foolish.
[time=3279] The storms of life bring us conflict.
[time=3282] Every conflict has a choice.
[time=3284] Are we going to choose to be wise or are we going to choose foolishness?
[time=3287] 90 times, Proverbs talks about the heart, comes down to the fear of the Lord, the falsely surrendered heart.
[time=3295] Am I going to surrender my heart to God and listen, learn and lean on Him?
[time=3300] Or am I going to just be foolish and build my life's foundation on a sand that's going to go away when these storms of conflict come?
[time=3308] Why don't you stand and can we have that Proverbs 1-7 back up on the screen?
[time=3315] As you stand, let's just together, out loud, let's just read it one more time, okay?
[time=3319] Let's keep this truth with us as we leave this week.
[time=3323] Read it with me.
[time=3324] The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, fools, despised wisdom and instruction.
[time=3332] With your heads bowed and your eyes closed, let me just remind you of this.
[time=3337] The tragedy of Solomon and on the upside, the promise of Proverbs 3, 5 and 6 people is
[time=3345] a heart that is fully his.
[time=3351] And you don't need me to stand here and tell you, but I'll say it.
[time=3358] If you're here this morning and you're a 15, 16, 17-year-old young man or young woman and
[time=3364] your heart's not fully his, then you stand in the way of the enemy's assault and his
[time=3376] desire will be to absolutely clean your clock, to literally, spiritually tear you limb from
[time=3389] limb with the lies and the deception that is so prevalent today.
[time=3395] If you're 15, 16, 17, 18, you know what?
[time=3398] If you're 30, 35, 40, 45 out in the business world, if you're a mom at home with kids,
[time=3405] if you're a young adult trying to make your way as a young professional, it doesn't matter where you are in this world today, in this culture, if you attempt to do that without
[time=3416] fully surrendering and giving your heart to him so that your understanding gets nullified
[time=3425] and you're able to acknowledge him so he can make your paths straight.
[time=3434] There is so much truth there and I would ask you today, whatever age, bracket you're in,
[time=3441] whatever daily circumstance you face, if you want to gain wisdom, if you want to make
[time=3448] it through this life in relationship with him and in a way that would honor him, your
[time=3454] heart has got to be fully his.
[time=3459] And so Father, may it be so in this place and may it be so in the lives of those who are here, may each and every one of us commit to come back again next week, but also commit
[time=3470] to live each day between then and now, fully given, completely surrendered to you, God
[time=3478] willing to trust you with all of our hearts, with every arena of our life so that you can
[time=3486] make our paths straight and may we grow, God, may we gain in our understanding of you,
[time=3495] may we grow in our reverence, may we grow in our awe of you, may there develop in each
[time=3502] of us, God a passionate and deep respect for you over and above all else, because you
[time=3509] are over and above all else.
[time=3513] So God, that when we see you that way, when we think of you that way, when we approach you that way, God that we would listen to what you have to say, learn from what's been
[time=3526] said so that we can again and again and again lean on you.
[time=3533] Father, bring us back together again, if that be your will and thank you so very much for
[time=3539] the truth of your word and the power that it has got change us and grow us in the days
[time=3545] to come in your name we pray and all the people agreed and said amen.
[time=3569] .
[time=3599] A loving kindness, acts of service, a service and a love God based in our relationship with
[time=3614] you and our belief that for some reason you've given
