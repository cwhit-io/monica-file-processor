[time=101] - Father, you are the king, and we want to proclaim that this morning as a body of believers and people who acknowledge your rulership and your reign.
[time=114] We ask that you would fill this place with your presence.
[time=118] Or did we see a glimpse of your face and a picture of your glory this morning?
[time=123] We pray these things in Christ Jesus, the king's name.
[time=128] [AMEN] You may be seated.

[time=509] - The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.
[time=517] The fools despise wisdom and instruction.
[time=519] - Train up a child in the way he should go.
[time=521] Even when he is old, he will not depart from it.
[time=524] If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat.
[time=526] And if he is thirsty, give him water to drink.
[time=529] - Trust in the Lord with all your heart and do not lean on your own understanding.
[time=533] - Take my instruction and not silver and knowledge rather than choices cold.
[time=538] - The gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.
[time=543] [upbeat music]
[time=571] - Well, welcome back this morning to our ongoing series that we've entitled "Navigating Through the Storms of Life" and it is all about an eight-week span where we are trying our best to understand God's wisdom, to understand how it is that you and I, facing all that we face, encountering all that we encounter, facing all the decisions and choices that you and I face, how are we going to choose?
[time=596] How are we going to make our way through this life in a way that truly reflects God's design?
[time=602] Well, we've answered that by saying the thing we need first and foremost, over and above all else, is you and I need to be wise.
[time=610] You and I need to understand how it is God would have us choose and the best way to do that is to, as we do each and every week, come into this place, open up the Word of God and see what, in fact, it has for us.
[time=624] So I'm thankful that you're here, thankful that we could spend this time together.
[time=629] I want to remind you, as we start, that last week in our initial look at this, we came up with what really is the theme verse.
[time=638] It is the verse that really kind of captures the essence of all of the book of Proverbs.
[time=644] There is so much there, but we see this theme verse in Proverbs 1-7, we see it repeated again and again and again throughout the book, and I want to remind you this morning before we jump back into our study of the essence of that truth, the essence of that verse, Proverbs 1-7, would you, in honor of God's word, would you stand with us this morning?
[time=666] Would you stand and let me, in fact, why don't you just read it out loud with me?
[time=672] We'll just read it together, Proverbs 1-7, read it together, here we go.
[time=677] The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.
[time=681] Fools despise wisdom and instruction.
[time=684] Let's do that again.
[time=685] The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.
[time=689] Fools despise wisdom and instruction.
[time=693] Let me just remind you, before we start, that verse right there, people, that is where, that is where this begins.
[time=703] Your ability to, and mine, our ability to acquire wisdom, our ability to look into the Scriptures, look into the Word of God and glean from it, life-changing truth.
[time=717] The ability you and I have to be transformed to live and think and choose like this, but then to come in contact with that, which is true and right and good, and begin to then live and think and choose like this, that transformational process begins.
[time=736] God's word says, Proverbs 1-7, when you and I come to a place of fear.
[time=743] Now remember, it's not a fear that's afraid, he's gonna hit you.
[time=749] No, no, no, it is a deep reverence, right?
[time=754] A passionate, deeply held respect that looks at him and acknowledges him and sees him for what he really is.
[time=764] He is the one and only true God.
[time=768] He is above all else, he is beyond all else, he is bigger, greater, more awesome, he is omniscient, he is omnipresent, he is omnipotent, he is the most powerful, most faithful God of all creation.
[time=782] He is God and you and I aren't.
[time=789] And when you and I come to grips with that, when you and I come to terms with that, when you and I approach times like this, with that as a mindset, and that as a posture, Corbin's been helping us with some postures, this posture of fearing the Lord, this posture of, oh God, I need your help and your God and I'm not.
[time=815] I just envision for me personally, when I sense that and when that truth hits home to me, there's just the sense where my head kind of goes down and my hand kind of goes up.
[time=832] Does that make sense?
[time=833] Why don't you buy your heads and close your eyes?
[time=835] Join me in that posture if you feel led to, just a hand up and a head down because God, you are God and your holiness and your righteousness and your goodness and your greatness and your love.
[time=853] God, it is so other and in you, there is great truth.
[time=859] God in you, there is life.
[time=863] And God, we are but frail, sinful creatures.
[time=867] And yet you allow us to come into your presence, God, you allow us to come to your words so our hands are raised and our heads are bowed.
[time=875] And God, with this posture, we come before you this morning, begging you once again to make your word, God, to make your truth live and penetrate deep into the very corners of our being.
[time=891] God, so that we could gain and obtain wisdom.
[time=895] We thank you for the privilege of that pursuit.
[time=900] And God, we thank you for your great love and mercy.
[time=903] And your son's name, we pray, amen.
[time=908] You can be seated.
[time=909] Proverbs and this study of wisdom
[time=916] and today we come to how it is you and I would handle our finances.
[time=919] Let me read a quote to you from Richard Halverson.
[time=921] Richard Halverson said this, Jesus Christ said more about money than about any other single thing because when it comes to a man's real nature, money is of first importance.
[time=933] Money is an exact index to a man's true character.
[time=938] All through scripture, there is an intimate correlation between the development of a man's character and how he handles his money.
[time=947] God's word has a lot to say people about money, how we view it, how we treat it, the priority it takes in our life.
[time=955] C.S. Lewis used a few less words to make just as powerful a statement.
[time=961] You can read it right there.
[time=962] He who has God and everything has no more than he who has God alone.
[time=973] He who has God and everything.
[time=975] He who has God in all the riches.
[time=977] He who has God and all the stuff.
[time=980] He who has God and all the toys and all the trips has no more than he who has God alone.
[time=990] What an amazing truth.
[time=995] Hey, do me a favor, would you?
[time=1001] Just reach into your pocket right now or reach into your purse.
[time=1004] Just do it quietly and once you pull out a dollar, you got an extra, you got a spare buck, you got 50 cents, you got some change in your pocket.
[time=1016] Go ahead, just empty out your change.
[time=1019] You got a few quarters, maybe a couple of dimes.
[time=1021] I know, I know, you gave it all in the offering, right?
[time=1024] Go ahead, just quietly, get out a dollar bill or two, you know, just a little extra.
[time=1030] Just that stuff, you don't really, really need.
[time=1032] You know what I mean?
[time=1033] If you got a 20 right now and your wife's looking at you, put it back.
[time=1036] All right, but just go ahead.
[time=1039] I'd like each of you, if you could, each of you individually to have some money in your hands right now.
[time=1047] Dimes, pennies, nickels, doesn't matter.
[time=1050] Give the kids something to hold on to.
[time=1052] Thank you.
[time=1054] I'd like you to hold on to that money.
[time=1059] I'd like you to hold on to that dollar bill or that $5 bill or those quarters, dimes and nickels, hold on to that.
[time=1064] And then I'd like you just to kind of follow along with me here.
[time=1067] Look at me, look at your money, look at the screens, just kind of keep it going here.
[time=1072] And I want to draw your attention to the screens.
[time=1073] Here are some things, some biblical statistics, if you will, that I want you to understand as it relates to money.
[time=1080] Watch this, just over 15% of all recorded scripture.
[time=1085] You look at that Bible sitting there next to you.
[time=1089] Over, just over 15% of all of it has to do with money, how you would handle it, how you would view it, how you would approach it.
[time=1098] Next, in the entire biblical record, there are twice as many verses referring to money, how you view it, how you handle it, how you'd spend it.
[time=1110] Then there are to faith and prayer combined.
[time=1116] More on money than on faith and prayer put together, keep going, look at that dollar bill in your hand.
[time=1123] Look at that, look at those coins.
[time=1126] Go ahead, look at it real quick.
[time=1127] In all of God's word, back to the screen, He says more about money than both heaven and hell.
[time=1137] I mean, this is God talking, right?
[time=1139] This is God teaching, these are the pages of scripture you think you'd have a lot to say about heaven and hell while He does, but guess what?
[time=1146] He's got more to say about money and how you view it and how you handle it.
[time=1152] In the scriptures, He says more about how we are to view and handle money, how to view and handle money than any other single issue of all the issues that there are, that you and I need help on how to handle it and how to view it.
[time=1168] Not one of them does He speak more to, more frequently or more often than the way you and I are to view and handle money.
[time=1177] Look at the very scriptures themselves, Matthew 6 picking it up in verse 19, hold onto that money now.
[time=1184] You got your money?
[time=1186] Look at that money just for a moment and then read with me, look at where it says here, "Do not store up for yourselves." You see it there, do not store up for yourselves, treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but store up for yourselves treasures, investments in heaven, spiritual things, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in or steal and it says in Matthew 6 21, for where your treasure is, for where your treasure is there, your heart will be also.
[time=1224] Jesus says clearly here in Matthew 6, that the direction of our financial affections is the truest reflection of our spiritual heart posture.
[time=1236] The way we handle and approach and view money is the truest reflection of our spiritual condition.
[time=1244] You say and I say, our hearts are fully his, well then our spending and our sacrificial giving and our approach to money will either validate that statement or negate it.
[time=1260] I say to you this morning, I love God.
[time=1262] Well then you better look at my visa bill.
[time=1267] 'Cause I can say that and you can say that,
[time=1274] but God's word simply says, look at where you spend your treasure.
[time=1280] Where to be it says there in Matthew 6 investing in heavenly treasure and my visa bill and your checkbook should indicate that.
[time=1293] Look at Luke, Luke 19, you hold on to that money?
[time=1300] I want you to, hold on to that money.
[time=1302] Look at that money.
[time=1303] What do you got there, dollar bill?
[time=1304] You got a five spot.
[time=1306] You got a few quarters and some dimes.
[time=1308] God's word has a lot to say about how you and I would handle and approach and view that which is in your hands right now.
[time=1316] Look at Luke 19, verse one.
[time=1319] Luke 19, verse one, he entered Jericho and was passing through and there was a man called and there was a man called by the name of Zacchaeus.
[time=1328] He was a chief tax collector and he was rich.
[time=1334] He'd been doing this tax collecting thing for a while and there had been times as you will soon see that he hadn't been always honest and upright.
[time=1344] In fact, he had gotten rich doing it his way.
[time=1349] Zacchaeus was trying to see who Jesus was and was unable because of the crowd for he was small in stature.
[time=1356] Zacchaeus was a wee little man.
[time=1359] You remember the story, the song that we sang as kids.
[time=1362] A wee little man was he.
[time=1364] So he ran ahead, verse four.
[time=1366] He ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree in order to see him.
[time=1371] For he was about to pass through that way.
[time=1373] When Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, "Zacchaeus, hurry and come down.
[time=1380] "For today I must stay at your house." And that day and that culture, that would have been an absolute statement of personal intimacy and closeness, of rich relationship, the sharing of a meal.
[time=1395] And he says it for all to hear.
[time=1398] And he hurried and came down and received him gladly when they, the crowds, when they saw it, they all began to grumble, saying, "He has gone to be the guest of a man who is a sinner." And he was that, wasn't he?
[time=1412] Verse eight, Zacchaeus stopped and said to the Lord, "Behold, Lord, somewhere in this dialogue, "somewhere in this encounter." He looks and says, "Okay, that's it." He stops and says to the Lord, "Behold, Lord, "half of all I own, half of my possessions "I will give to the poor.
[time=1430] "And if I have defrauded anyone of anything, "which he knew and the Lord knew he had, "everybody in that town knew he had, "if I have defrauded anyone of anything, "I will give back four times as much." Now watch this.
[time=1443] And Jesus said to him today, salvation has come to this house because he too is a son of Abraham.
[time=1453] Let me ask you this, people.
[time=1457] How important is our handling of money?
[time=1459] How spiritually telling is our attitude toward money.
[time=1463] When Zacchaeus said he wouldn't give half of his money to the poor and pay back four times over those he had cheated.
[time=1471] Jesus didn't say good idea.
[time=1473] Did you catch that?
[time=1477] Jesus didn't look at him and say, "Zacchaeus, you know, that's a really fine gesture." No, when Zacchaeus said, "Half of all I own, "I give to the poor and everybody have defrauded, "I'll pay back four times over." Jesus said today, salvation has come to this house.
[time=1496] This is amazing.
[time=1502] Jesus judged, Jesus assessed the reality of this man's salvation based on his willingness.
[time=1511] Better said his cheerful eagerness to part with his money for the glory of God and the good of others.
[time=1520] What do you got in your hand there?
[time=1523] You got a buck, you got some coins.
[time=1525] I want you to trust me on this.
[time=1528] We'll come back to this, okay, but just trust me on this.
[time=1529] I want you to take them in your hands right now, everybody, and just kind of hold that out in front of you.
[time=1533] Whatever it is, hang on, just say.
[time=1535] Do what I do, not just what I say, is that right?
[time=1544] All right, here you go, out in front, everybody.
[time=1547] Okay, I just want you to, whatever it is, coins, paper, okay, just drop it.
[time=1551] All right, just drop it.
[time=1556] And let it be.
[time=1560] Let it go.
[time=1562] Okay, we'll come back to that.
[time=1566] Oh, there's some more.
[time=1568] Somebody's feeling guilty back there.
[time=1570] (congregation laughing) Last second drop.
[time=1573] Going once, going twice, anybody?
[time=1578] There you go.
[time=1579] Money.
[time=1582] People, the way we view it, how we spend it, the priority importance we allow it to have in our lives, it is very, very important.
[time=1590] And God's Word says a lot about it.
[time=1592] So let's go back to the book of Proverbs.
[time=1594] Join me back there in the Old Testament, just past the book of Psalms, which if you open your Bibles halfway, you usually open up to Psalms.
[time=1602] Go to Proverbs, chapter 22.
[time=1606] It's in Proverbs 22 that we find these 30 sayings of the wise.
[time=1611] Talked about that last week.
[time=1613] We don't have time to go through the entire book of Proverbs, but what a great thing, the book, almost a book within the book.
[time=1619] A segment of the book of Proverbs entitled The 30 Sayings of the Wise, from which we will find all kinds of insight for many of the issues we face in life today, obviously talking about the way in which we would handle our finances.
[time=1632] Today we're gonna see three things.
[time=1634] And you can write these down as we start, and then we're gonna come back and hit each one of them.
[time=1638] We will see that in God's book of wisdom here, there are some things he has to say about the way we handle finances.
[time=1644] Number one, how we are to be kind to those without.
[time=1648] How we are to be kind to those who don't have much.
[time=1653] We'll also look at how important it is, according to the scriptures, according to the 30 sayings of the wise, to be content people.
[time=1660] You and I would be content with what we've been given and avoid the chase.
[time=1667] Avoid the race, if you will.
[time=1669] This unbelievable chase that so many,
[time=1676] maybe even in this room, so many in our culture today, are captivated by this assault on possessions and earnings and this craving to have more and bigger and better.
[time=1692] Proverbs teaches us today to be content and to be gracious, to be kind, to be content and to be gracious and give from the top.
[time=1702] Let's go back to number one.
[time=1704] Be kind to those without Proverbs chapter 22 verses 22 and 23, are you there?
[time=1711] Let's look at that.
[time=1713] Be kind, he says, to those without.
[time=1715] Says in verse 22, do not rob the poor because he is poor or crush the afflicted at the gate for the Lord will plead their case and take the life, that's right, and take the life of those who rob them.
[time=1734] Do not rob the poor, he says, because he is poor or crush the afflicted.
[time=1740] Interesting in the Hebrew, that word there do not, that phrase do not rob, although that would literally apply to coming up to someone and taking their money from them in an aggressive nature.
[time=1752] It also has to do with taking advantage of them.
[time=1756] Robbery by a more subtle means, if you will.
[time=1760] God's word says to you in either this morning, don't you dare take advantage of somebody who is weak.
[time=1766] Don't you dare take from someone who doesn't have
[time=1773] for your own gain and for your own benefit.
[time=1775] Do not take from, do not take advantage of, don't steal from those who are without.
[time=1784] And then he goes on to say, or crush the afflicted at the gate in the Hebrew, that verb there, that word would kind of have to do almost with, I mean, yes, it could imply a physical crushing, but you know what, it meant more than that was, be nice to them.
[time=1804] Don't crush them, they're spirit.
[time=1808] Don't be rude, don't be mean.
[time=1811] Don't be aggressive toward them, don't crush them.
[time=1815] They would gather there at the city gates, don't rob the poor or crush the afflicted at the gate.
[time=1821] God has a heart, boy does God have a heart.
[time=1828] And God's word says so much about this.
[time=1831] Look at 1 Samuel 2, write this down, 1 Samuel 2, verses 7 and 8, 1 Samuel 2, verses 7 and 8, it says there, I believe it'll be on the screen, you can turn there if you'd like.
[time=1844] 1 Samuel 2, verses 7 and 8 says the Lord makes the poor, the Lord makes the rich, the Lord makes poor and rich.
[time=1852] He brings low, he also exalts, he raises the poor from the dust, he does.
[time=1859] He lifts the needy from the ash heap.
[time=1863] It's where many of them would gather at the ash heap.
[time=1867] He lifts the needy from the ash heap to make them sit with nobles and inherit a seat of honor.
[time=1875] The Lord makes poor and rich, he brings low, he also exalts, he raises the poor from the dust.
[time=1884] Question for you today.
[time=1890] Why so many times in the past have you and I had such critical, harsh or just plain mean thoughts toward a poor person?
[time=1902] Why is that?
[time=1906] Why is it when you've been walking down the street in Chicago or when you've been walking down the street in some large metropolitan city or maybe even here in good old hometown Midwest USA?
[time=1920] Why is it when somebody who's dirty?
[time=1924] Why is it when someone who's unshaven?
[time=1929] Physically they've got a stench.
[time=1933] Emotionally it may even be clear they have some issues.
[time=1937] And they wave their styrofoam cup in your face.
[time=1940] Why is it so many times that the response, the immediate and sometimes intense response in me is so ugly and so harsh and so cruel.
[time=1955] Why do I so oftentimes immediately?
[time=1958] You know what?
[time=1959] They walk into this place every week.
[time=1961] I don't personally deal with them as often as other individuals
[time=1967] on our staff do who do a wonderful job by and large, but even they would tell you that week after a week, when they come in through these doors and they share their stories and their need for some help.
[time=1979] Or when you and I bump into them out in the streets, why time after time is my initial response, why don't you get a job?
[time=1990] Why don't you just get a job?
[time=1997] I can't tell you how many times in my mind, I just wanted to say, you know what?
[time=2002] I'll take you to Maple Crest and Stellhorn and I'll find a job for you in 30 minutes.
[time=2008] Go get a job 'cause I've got one.
[time=2015] Why don't you?
[time=2018] Maybe you've never thought that.
[time=2023] Maybe you've never said that.
[time=2025] I'm embarrassed to say I have.
[time=2032] There have been times I've been more gracious.
[time=2033] There have been times I've been more compassionate.
[time=2036] Or you power up mental in your mind and think, you know, I'm not gonna give him a dime because all he's gonna do with that dime is go buy some more booze or go buy some more drugs or go buy some more whatever's.
[time=2048] No, I worked hard for my money.
[time=2051] I earned my money.
[time=2052] I'm the one who got my money.
[time=2055] You go earn some yourself.
[time=2058] Get a job and get out of my way and we kind of do all that sometimes, either emotionally or literally.
[time=2066] And I've noticed something about me.
[time=2070] I've seen it in others too.
[time=2071] Rarely will we lock what?
[time=2073] Eyes.
[time=2075] We don't even want to engage 'cause we're so much better.
[time=2081] Why do we do that?
[time=2085] My mind goes to Deuteronomy.
[time=2091] There's a word that would answer the question why you and I do that.
[time=2096] Instead of telling you the word, I'll just read to you about it.
[time=2099] Deuteronomy eight, we'll pick it up in verse 11.
[time=2102] Says, "Beware that you do not forget the Lord your God." Here is, here are some amazing words to the people of Israel as God attempts to have them reflect.
[time=2114] Beware that you do not forget the Lord your God by not keeping his commandments and his ordinances and his statutes, which I am commanding you today.
[time=2123] Otherwise, when you have eaten and are satisfied and have built good houses and lived in them, and when your herds and your flocks multiply and your silver and gold multiply and all that you have multiplies, in other words, you've got money to spend at Scots, then your heart will become what?
[time=2147] Go ahead, say it louder.
[time=2151] Then your heart will become proud and you will forget the Lord your God who brought you out from the land of Egypt out of the house of slavery.
[time=2159] He led you through the great and terrible wilderness with its fiery serpents and scorpions and thirsty ground where there was no water.
[time=2166] He brought water for you out of the rock of Flint and the wilderness.
[time=2170] He fed you manna which your fathers did not know that he might humble you and that he might test you to do good for you in the end.
[time=2178] Otherwise, you may say in your heart, my power and the strength of my hand made me this wealth.
[time=2184] But you shall remember the Lord your God for it is he who is giving you power to make wealth, that he may confirm his covenant which he swore to your fathers as it is this day.
[time=2199] Our text here in Proverbs 22 people says lose the pride.
[time=2209] Lose your arrogance, but by the grace of God there goes who?
[time=2214] I, Proverbs 22, don't take advantage.
[time=2222] Verse 22, don't treat them poorly.
[time=2234] And don't forget if you do, the Lord will deal with you.
[time=2239] And let me just say this to you before we move on.
[time=2244] As I'm reading back there through Deuteronomy, right?
[time=2248] Follow me here.
[time=2249] As I'm reading back there through Deuteronomy and I'm realizing how God dealt with the people of Israel, how good he was to them, how patient he was with them, how long suffering he was with them, he was, wasn't he?
[time=2261] Wasn't he?
[time=2263] Well, you know what I'm reminded of?
[time=2265] I'm reminded of how loving and patient and long suffering he was with me.
[time=2271] Go to Romans chapter two.
[time=2276] Let me point this out to you.
[time=2280] Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Romans.
[time=2285] When you're thinking about how you're gonna respond, when you're thinking about how you're gonna treat them, when you're thinking about how you're going to posture yourself with those who are so sick and dirty and ugly and smelly and poor and annoying Romans two, one.
[time=2300] Just listen.
[time=2301] Therefore you have no, it says therefore you have no excuse.
[time=2305] Every one of you, Paul here, writing to the church at Romans about God's relationship with them, every one of you who passes judgment, for in that which you judge another you condemn yourself for you who judge practice the same things.
[time=2320] And we know that the judgment of God rightly falls upon those who practice such things.
[time=2325] But do you suppose this, oh man, when you pass judgment on those who practice such things and do the same yourself that you will escape the judgment of God, or do you think, watch this, or do you think lightly of the riches of his kindness and tolerance and patience, not knowing that the kindness
[time=2349] of God leads you to repentance.
[time=2353] Do you see that?
[time=2355] What might your kind word?
[time=2360] What might your tolerant deed?
[time=2362] What might your sweet spirit of patience and long suffering with this person who you don't even know?
[time=2370] And as if, I mean, as if a job would straighten out all
[time=2377] that has gone south and his or her life from the day they were born.
[time=2382] You have no idea where they've lived, but you know what, your kindness, God's kindness toward me, led me to repentance.
[time=2391] Your kindness towards them could lead them in a number of different places, one of which could be repentance.
[time=2400] Hey, be nice.
[time=2407] Be kind to those without.
[time=2409] And be content, number two, write that down.
[time=2414] And be content with what you've been given.
[time=2417] Be so very, very content with what you've been given.
[time=2423] Be content and avoid the chase.
[time=2428] We'll go on to Proverbs 23, still within the 30 sayings of the wise, we find in Proverbs 23, verse four and five, this great truth, it says there, do not weary yourself.
[time=2439] Oh, please listen, do not weary yourself to gain wealth.
[time=2446] Seize from your consideration of it.
[time=2451] When you set your eyes on it, it is gone.
[time=2453] For wealth certainly makes itself wings, like an eagle that flies toward the heavens.
[time=2462] Do not weary yourself to gain wealth, he says.
[time=2467] I pull this note out of my files, received it a while ago,
[time=2473] one husband and father wrote these words as he sat alone and I'll emphasize that word alone.
[time=2481] The husband and father wrote these words as he sat alone at a tiny table in his one bedroom apartment at the age of 53 cut off from his wife, kids and grandchildren.
[time=2494] And he says this, Kelly, he writes, the sad truth of the matter is
[time=2504] that it was always easier for me to make money than it was to love and be with my family.
[time=2510] Loving my family required humility and personal sacrifice
[time=2517] while growing my company's plural and my name required growing levels of greed, pride, aggression and adrenaline.
[time=2527] I chose greed and pride in the end and in the process crushed the precious spirits of my wife and three kids.
[time=2537] They were forgiving and patient for a time, for a long time actually, but now after 25 years of broken promises, broken trust, shattered dreams and a life full of luxury, pleasure and monumental accomplishments, I have nothing.
[time=2553] And then he just says it again, just one word in a period, underlined, bold caps, nothing.
[time=2561] The market, partners with even greater levels of greed
[time=2567] and pride than I and two really bad decisions have left me an hourly employee working retail.
[time=2576] My wife and kids are gone with no room left in their hearts for my pathetic games and empty words and I'm reminded as I sit here of the great King Solomon's final assessment of all he had acquired.
[time=2590] And behold, he said in Ecclesiastes 2.11,
[time=2598] all was vanity and striving after wind.
[time=2606] Did you ever chase wind?
[time=2609] Did you think about it just for a minute?
[time=2614] How you doing?
[time=2615] Did you get it?
[time=2618] Did you find it?
[time=2620] Did you capture it?
[time=2621] Did you hold on to it?
[time=2622] Did you get close?
[time=2624] No.
[time=2625] All was vanity and striving after wind and there was no profit under the sun.
[time=2631] This gentleman concludes in the end, it was all useless, a chase that led to senseless emptiness in a life I could never retrieve.
[time=2643] People, our text here in Proverbs 23 says, "Do not weary yourself." You see it there?
[time=2650] Do not weary yourself to gain wealth.
[time=2653] Can I say it to you this way?
[time=2654] Let's try it this way, what do you say?
[time=2657] Let's just flip-flop that, okay?
[time=2659] I mean, that's the negative, okay?
[time=2661] That's the warning, that's the admonition.
[time=2663] Don't weary yourself trying to get rich.
[time=2668] Let's just flip-flop it, because it's implied and also supported throughout scripture that you and I, let's try this one on.
[time=2677] You and I are to get, how about if we got tired, how about if you and I got weary pursuing him?
[time=2684] How about if you came to the end of your week absolutely worn out?
[time=2692] 'Cause you'd been fighting sin so hard and so passionately and so long.
[time=2697] How about we get to the end of the week and you're absolutely wiped out you've been loving her so much?
[time=2705] Giving yourself to her day after day, night after night.
[time=2710] You've been loving them, moms and dads.
[time=2714] What have we got to the end of the week?
[time=2715] And it wasn't the chase of more cash.
[time=2718] It wasn't the pursuit of better trips, but it was the life and the energy and the love and the sacrifice you gave to him and to her and to them.
[time=2730] And it's Saturday night and you are done.
[time=2735] Can't even keep your eyes open.
[time=2737] My wife and I played tennis the other night
[time=2743] for two and a half hours.
[time=2745] First time I'd played tennis in like 10 years.
[time=2747] So I decided to play two and a half hours in one night.
[time=2750] And we played with some friends and they even had an instructor there who worked us like a rented mule.
[time=2757] I mean, it was not even funny.
[time=2760] I mean, we were dead.
[time=2762] We were dead tired.
[time=2764] We got home that night.
[time=2765] Getting out of bed the next morning was comical.
[time=2769] You would have been in stitches just watching us get it.
[time=2773] I mean, even still today.
[time=2776] But you know why?
[time=2777] There was something sweet about being tired.
[time=2782] Does that make sense?
[time=2784] I don't work out as much as I should.
[time=2788] When you really do it, right?
[time=2789] I mean, when you really just go ahead and step out there and work yourself to the bone and your dragon yourself and there's something about that that for me kind of feels like, wow, that's good.
[time=2799] It's good to feel tired.
[time=2801] I'd love for you to feel weary.
[time=2806] I'd love to feel tired 'cause I've been pursuing him, helping with homework, maybe a little laundry, maybe some long conversations with a son or a daughter that need to be had.
[time=2820] But I've been talking to people all day, I say to myself.
[time=2823] I've been talking to people all day.
[time=2826] I don't wanna come home, you know what?
[time=2828] Deal with it, Kelly.
[time=2830] There's an eight-year-old girl in there who needs someone to talk to her for about a half hour, probably, about some things that are all of a sudden pretty confusing in her world.
[time=2839] We need to have Bible time that night.
[time=2843] Gather the kids around, read a story, ask some questions, ask some things out, pray for our family.
[time=2848] A science project can use some attention.
[time=2850] Few sack of lunches might could be made.
[time=2853] Some spelling words need to be gone over.
[time=2855] And a personal late-night time of worship that you wouldn't dream of missing, because tomorrow you're gonna get up and do what?
[time=2866] Same thing, all over again.
[time=2869] Be kind, people, to those without.
[time=2875] And be content as it relates to the chase, the pursuit of, as Solomon would say, nothing but emptiness.
[time=2884] Thirdly, write this down, be gracious.
[time=2888] Be gracious and give from or off the top.
[time=2891] Be gracious in the way that you give.
[time=2893] We're gonna kind of digress a bit outside the 30 sayings and actually go back to Proverbs chapter three, where we see this issue addressed.
[time=2902] Will you go back there with me, Proverbs three?
[time=2903] We oftentimes think of Proverbs three, five, and six.
[time=2906] I wanna invite you to come down to Proverbs three, nine, and 10.
[time=2910] Be gracious, God's word says, in the way that you give.
[time=2913] It says in Proverbs three, nine, honor the Lord from your wealth and from the first of all your produce, from the first of all your produce, so that your barns will be filled with plenty and your vats will overflow with new wine.
[time=2932] Was reading about this idea of a first fruits offering
[time=2938] this week as I read through a book by Randy Alcorn.
[time=2942] The basic idea of this is this, folks.
[time=2944] This was an agrarian culture, three times a year in the Jewish custom they would bring what was called first fruits offerings.
[time=2952] First fruits offerings, three times a year, they'd bring them in.
[time=2957] We're talking about grain, we're talking about wine, we're talking about honey, we're talking about wheat, all of their produce.
[time=2963] You see, these would be the things that would represent for so many of these people their income, they would grow and harvest these things, then sell these things in order to live.
[time=2973] And three times a year, they took the best of what they had grown and the first.
[time=2979] I mean, they had been working and working and working and waiting and waiting and waiting and now it was time.
[time=2984] Here comes the harvest, here comes the crop and boom, right off the top, more than likely at a time of personal need because they've been waiting.
[time=2993] They carve out the best and they carve out the first
[time=2999] right from the get go and say here God, it's yours.
[time=3003] Two reasons, number one, because we are so unbelievably unspeakably grateful, we are a grateful people for a God like you whose love and faithfulness and patience has been so evident, so because of our gratitude we give.
[time=3018] First, right off the top, first fruits, there you go, the very best of the bunch.
[time=3023] And we also give, not only out of gratitude,
[time=3030] but because we trust you.
[time=3031] 'Cause yes, oh, by the way, we do need more of the crop to come and we do need the rest of this to hold up and we're gonna give you the best and we're gonna give you the first and we're also gonna trust that you will sustain us and meet our needs.
[time=3047] Here's the key to the whole concept, ready?
[time=3052] In the heart of these people who would come with these first fruits offering, was the notion that because he was God, he deserved their very best, not their residue, not their leftover stuff at the bottom of the bend.
[time=3074] You with me?
[time=3076] What do you give him?
[time=3081] What do you give him in this arena?
[time=3088] Many of you in this place give on a regular basis.
[time=3092] You write checks and you don't write 'em to me.
[time=3097] Please be reminded of that giving, financial giving in this arena we've talked about.
[time=3102] This isn't about Black Hawk, it's not about me.
[time=3105] You're not giving it to me, you're not giving it to us, you're giving it to him.
[time=3108] What do you give him?
[time=3111] I'll just ask you that this morning.
[time=3112] Do you give him the first portion?
[time=3121] Do you give him that sacrificial chunk right off the top?
[time=3125] You're going, wait a minute, Kelly, you're killing me 'cause I've only got this much and I hear you 'cause I think the way you think.
[time=3131] I've got this figured out, God, I need this much to live.
[time=3136] And if I ride out of the gate, I mean, if I carve out this chunk that's the best and represents a sacrificial offering and I give it to you first here, first of the week, first of the month, let's say.
[time=3150] Well, if I do that, well, then I know, 'cause I know, 'cause we know, right?
[time=3157] 'Cause we're very smart people.
[time=3158] We know that if we do that, we're just not gonna have enough at the end.
[time=3164] So I know you're great and awesome and all, but I can't, you know, you're just gonna have to wait 'til the 30th and I'll give you what I got, what?
[time=3179] Left over.
[time=3179] And that, some of you scholars will catch me on this.
[time=3190] I might not have the names right.
[time=3192] Mitch, maybe you can help me.
[time=3193] Hophne and Finneas, that sound familiar?
[time=3196] Hophne and Finneas, Eli's sons, right?
[time=3201] In charge of the temple, you read about it.
[time=3204] On 1 Samuel 2, I believe, they decided to do that.
[time=3208] They decided to take the best meat that would come.
[time=3212] Remember, and pull it aside and have it for themselves.
[time=3216] And there was this whole long process, they were just ripping people off, but more than ripping people off, they were ripping who off, and he took their lives.
[time=3224] He took their lives.
[time=3228] He's a gracious God, but he's a jealous God.
[time=3234] And he longs for you and I to give to him our best.
[time=3237] Do you give God leftovers?
[time=3239] Or do you gratefully give him the best, right off the top?
[time=3243] If I asked every one of you in this room this morning, if you were grateful for what God had done in your life, if I asked every one of you here that knows him, if you were really, really, really, really, really grateful for the mercy that he has extended, for the grace that he has given, for the life that he has offered, many of you in the room would answer what?
[time=3265] Say it, are you grateful what?
[time=3267] Yes.
[time=3268] And I read a quote, I cannot for the life of me find out where I got it from.
[time=3275] I lost the actual, it sounds like me, I know.
[time=3278] I lost the actual article, but I got it here.
[time=3282] And I wrote it down.
[time=3284] And see, I would say yes too.
[time=3285] If you asked me am I grateful, I would say yes.
[time=3287] The article in this one quote had to do with sometimes how empty that response can become.
[time=3293] And it said this, genuine gratitude must move beyond the sincere but empty word to the gracious act or loving deed.
[time=3304] You grateful?
[time=3308] Live like it.
[time=3310] Serve like it.
[time=3314] Sing like it.
[time=3318] You know what, give.
[time=3319] Give like it.
[time=3321] 'Cause he deserves it.
[time=3324] And he deserves your best and mine right off the top.
[time=3328] Again and again and again.
[time=3330] As it relates to wisdom and the handling of Ramani,
[time=3338] be kind, be content, be gracious.
[time=3341] You know the 53 year old guy
[time=3347] whose note I read to you earlier, he missed all three.
[time=3352] That's where that ends up.
[time=3356] He wasn't kind, he wasn't content.
[time=3358] And he hardly ever gave a dime.
[time=3361] 'Cause it was all about what he was going to accumulate.
[time=3365] And can I please, as we close, remind you of what C.S. Lewis said.
[time=3370] They'll throw that quote up for you again.
[time=3371] You can just read it one more time.
[time=3372] Go ahead.
[time=3376] He who has God in everything has no more than he who has God, what?
[time=3383] Alone.
[time=3385] Hey, would you stand with me this morning as we close?
[time=3389] And I'll say this to you.
[time=3390] The money that's there on the ground.
[time=3395] You know what?
[time=3396] We're just gonna give us an opportunity as a family.
[time=3400] If you need it, go ahead and pick it back up.
[time=3402] If not, we're gonna collect it all.
[time=3405] We're just gonna scoop it all up and we are going to just in a very small okay in comparison to the things that we can do, we are gonna just extend the small act of kindness and we're gonna donate all the money.
[time=3417] First hour, folks do the same thing and we're just gonna give all this money to the rescue mission and just extend some kindness.
[time=3424] (audience applauds) And if you wanna drop some more on the way out, feel free, pray with me, would you?
[time=3435] Oh, and before you do that, there are some books.
[time=3438] How to read Proverbs and then an introduction and commentary to Proverbs by Derek Kydner.
[time=3444] A couple of books I've been using, we've made them available for you out in the Resource Center.
[time=3448] You might wanna go by and purchase some further study in Proverbs if you wanna kind of continue at your own pace with us.
[time=3455] Father, we come before you this morning so very grateful again for the joy and privilege that is ours to be here in this room together.
[time=3465] And now God, the privilege that is ours to go out, to go to work, to go home, to go out and live out our faith God in a fully surrendered fashion.
[time=3476] And God, may we as we leave talk about these truths with each other, with our friends, with our children, when we get up and when we lie down as we walk along the way, God, may we take these truths and further study and further read and further memorize and further plant the truth of your word into the very reaches of our hearts and souls.
[time=3501] God, thank you for these people.
[time=3503] Thank you for the opportunities that you've put before us.
[time=3506] God, strengthen us to be the people you've called us to be, to be Christ followers, fully surrendered, wanting nothing more than to be used of you, to change our world.
[time=3519] And we'll ask you to do that, God, to change us and to transform us so that we can help you do that very same thing in the lives of others.
[time=3529] Bring us back together again soon, if that be your will and your son's name.
[time=3533] And they all agreed and said, "Amen." [MUSIC - 23 seconds]
[time=3564] (audience applauds)
