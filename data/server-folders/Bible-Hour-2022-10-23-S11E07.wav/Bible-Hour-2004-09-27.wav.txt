[time=30] [MUSIC - 210 seconds]
[time=250] >> Hi, I'm Kelly Bird,
[time=269] senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries, and I want to welcome you again to our broadcast.
[time=274] It is great to have you with us.
[time=276] You are going to see today the second installation in our ongoing series that we've entitled "Navigating Through the Storms of Life."
[time=284] Navigating Through the Storms of Life, this is our look at and our study from the book of Proverbs.
[time=290] And we've gone to the book of Proverbs because it's in Proverbs where you and I can find the one thing that you and I need.
[time=298] To make decisions and to make choices and to make our way through this life and all that it brings in a way that honors God.
[time=306] And that one thing that you and I need is wisdom.
[time=309] And so we are enjoying this look, learning from it, growing from it, being challenged by it.
[time=315] And today we come to the topic of friendship, how you and I handle our friends.
[time=321] And the book of Proverbs talks about friends and says basically this, that friends influence you.
[time=328] I know they influence me.
[time=330] And I want you to think about that before you hear the message this morning.
[time=333] Think about the influence that friends have had.
[time=336] Now here in Proverbs friends is defined basically in a sense by those that you would spend time with, those that you would listen to,
[time=343] those that you would hang out with, those who you would go here with.
[time=348] These aren't necessarily your best and closest friends though it would include that.
[time=353] But just in my own life thinking about the people who I've hung out with, the people that I've spent time with,
[time=360] I can go back to my youth and I can come all the way through adulthood and I can realize that friends have influenced me greatly.
[time=368] There were friends I had that influenced me toward drugs as a teenager struggling to figure out what to do with my life.
[time=377] There were other friends who influenced me toward inappropriate behavior.
[time=382] There have been friends in my life who have influenced what I wear.
[time=385] There have been friends who have influenced teams I've liked in the sports arena.
[time=390] There have been friends who have influenced me and how I wear my hair there are friends who have influenced me and what I like to eat.
[time=398] I mean if you just stop and think about your life and when I think about mine friends, people I hang with, folks we spend time with,
[time=407] they have influenced us from the very get go.
[time=411] And God's Word says you know what, you better be careful, you better be wise in who you give yourself to, who you spend that time with.
[time=419] And I would just ask you today, whoever you are, whatever stage of life you find yourself in, listen today to what God's Word says to you.
[time=429] Be very, very careful who you spend time with because God's Word's really clear.
[time=436] Those who you spend time with will influence you.
[time=440] You will become like them and they will lead you to a certain end.
[time=445] Our hope is that you would, my hope is that I would begin to exercise greater amounts of wisdom and give myself to and spend time with those people who are interested in and given to the same things that I am,
[time=457] trying to better live my life and make my way through life in a God honoring way.
[time=464] Listen today, I pray that God's Word and the Spirit of God would encourage you and remind you as you consider how it is you handle your friendships.
[time=476] Oh, here He comes, riding on a path, shining like the sun.
[time=493] After truth and all, in your own, in your own, in your own, in your own, in your own, in your own.
[time=509] Out of time till salvation comes.
[time=539] These are the days of the harvest, the fields are as white in your world.
[time=566] Still we are the voice in the desert crying, preparing the way of the Lord.
[time=577] Riding on the clouds, shining like the sun.
[time=582] Out of that cold, lift your voice, near a chilly, out of time till salvation comes.
[time=601] These are the days of the season, the dry bones be coming as flesh.
[time=610] And these are the days of your servant, David rebuilding a temple of praise.
[time=619] These are the days of the harvest, the fields are as white in your own.
[time=628] And we are the laborers in your opinion declaring the word of the Lord.
[time=639] Riding on the clouds, shining like the sun.
[time=644] Out of that cold, lift your voice, near a chilly, out of time till salvation comes.
[time=763] Out of that cold, lift your voice, near a chilly, out of time till salvation comes, near a chilly, out of time till salvation comes.
[time=793] Out of that cold, lift your voice, near a chilly, out of time till salvation comes.
[time=958] Well, you're not a team player, and you're certainly quick to judge others.
[time=966] Well, you know what they say about paybacks, Eddie. It's time for you to go.
[time=971] Eddie, you just really weren't much of a friend.
[time=989] Eddie, from the start, I thought you were going to be an awesome asset because you're so strong.
[time=998] But then you wouldn't even help me collect firewood.
[time=1000] You sealed your own fate, buddy.
[time=1011] You have a ball. Cano that erupts way more than I like. My mama told me not to be friends with mean boys. Peace out, dude.
[time=1019] Eddie, you don't cook, you don't clean, and where I come from, you're basically useless.
[time=1039] Out here, it's survival of the fittest.
[time=1043] Vicki, the next trip I want you to take is the one home.
[time=1048] Eddie, you're way too arrogant. You've made too many friends, not enough, or too many enemies, not enough friends.
[time=1064] And, I mean, come on. The bandana on mustache. Who do you think you are, Hulk Hogan?
[time=1070] I'm not so sure what I'm doing here. I think I took the wrong flight out of Atlanta.
[time=1084] I'm on an island, so if any of you know where this is, come and rescue me.
[time=1090] Otherwise, I'll just vote for Eddie.
[time=1094] Okay. When the votes are counted, the decision is final. The person with the most votes will be asked to leave tribal council immediately. I'll now tally the votes.
[time=1109] One vote for Eddie.
[time=1115] One vote for Eddie, one vote for Vicki.
[time=1123] Two votes, Eddie, one vote, Vicki.
[time=1136] And the first person voted off the survivor, Blackhawk, is Eddie. Eddie, would you bring me your torch, please?
[time=1154] Sorry, Eddie. The tribe has spoken.
[time=1157] Well, looks like you all have some bonding to do. Take your torches and head on back to camp.
[time=1170] The peer of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge. Fool's despised wisdom and instruction.
[time=1180] Train up a child in the way he should go. Even when he is old, he will not depart from it.
[time=1185] If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat. And if he is thirsty, give him water to drink.
[time=1190] Trust in the Lord with all your heart and do not lean on your own understanding.
[time=1193] Take my instruction and not silver in knowledge rather than choices gold.
[time=1199] A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.
[time=1210] [MUSIC]
[time=1220] Well, survivor, Blackhawk, you've got to have to stay tuned on that one.
[time=1237] This crew, quite a crew, quite a crew they are. They're going to be following us through the remaining weeks of our series.
[time=1243] And we'll see how that thing transpires. I want to welcome you today to our ongoing study.
[time=1249] We've entitled "Navigating Through the Storms of Life." And what this really is is an opportunity for you and I
[time=1255] to look to the Word of God for direction and guidance as we face all the myriad of issues that this life throws at us.
[time=1264] We would want to, I would want too many of you in this room would want to face those issues, choose in the midst of that
[time=1270] in a way that would be God honoring, in a way that would lead us to blessing and not ruin.
[time=1276] Choosing in a way that would lead us to God's best instead of that which comes when we choose other than him.
[time=1283] And so what a great, great opportunity for us as we have for the last couple of weeks looked at some of the issues we face in life.
[time=1290] Last week it was finances. Today we come to friendships.
[time=1294] Friendships, how it is we handle, how it is we approach, how it is we live this life and choose in the midst of our friendships.
[time=1303] Think about friends for a minute, would you? Think about the friends you've got in your life. Think about the friends that you've had
[time=1309] maybe over the years. Just think about that for a minute, get a few names and faces maybe in mind.
[time=1315] You know what, there's a lot we can say about friendships, there's a lot we can say about those friends that you and I have.
[time=1321] One of the things that is absolutely true is that friends influence you.
[time=1330] Friends have an amazing capacity.
[time=1333] Now when we say friends, understand today that we're working with a definition that would go something like this.
[time=1339] These are the folks that you spend the most time with.
[time=1342] These are the people that you go places with. These are the folks that you talk with.
[time=1346] These are the people that to varying degrees you share your life with.
[time=1350] You hang with these folks. You talk to these folks. You spend time with them.
[time=1356] And the bottom line is, and if you just think about it for a moment like I did this week, friends influence you.
[time=1364] They really do. They influence what you wear.
[time=1368] They influence what you watch. Hey, did you see this? You ought to watch and it was really good.
[time=1374] So next Wednesday at 9, there you are turning it on.
[time=1378] They influence what you wear. They influence what you watch. They influence the way you talk.
[time=1383] Certain phrases that you use, certain ways of speaking, you pick up from those who you spend time with.
[time=1390] What you wear, what you watch, how you talk, what you play.
[time=1394] You know what, truth be told, I never played golf before I moved Indiana.
[time=1398] Many of you know today I love golf. I didn't play golf before I moved Indiana and started spending time with guys that played golf.
[time=1408] They influence our spiritual pursuits.
[time=1412] Hey, are you going to sign up for that Bible study?
[time=1416] Hey, do you want to come be a part of our small group?
[time=1421] Our parenting, the way we parent our children is influenced by our friends, our finances,
[time=1427] the way we wear our hair, the places we go on vacations, even what we eat.
[time=1435] I've had friends for years influencing me in that direction.
[time=1439] I eat raw fish now because somebody got me turned on to sushi.
[time=1444] I mean, they influence so much of your life. Think about it.
[time=1451] They even influence what we value, right?
[time=1455] And they even influence how we make decisions.
[time=1458] So you know what, if you're here this morning and you're a middle school or a high school student, you need to listen to what God's Word says to you about the friendships that you forged.
[time=1468] But you know what, if you're a 35, 45, 55 year old adult, let me just tell you this, from the conversations I end up having inevitably with 45, 55 year old adults, the times I spend with some of them in my office,
[time=1485] the conversations I have with them over a booth at a restaurant, the emails I go back and forth with them on,
[time=1491] you know what, you'd all better listen as well.
[time=1497] Because it's not just high schoolers and it's not just middle schoolers that continue to forge friendships that sometimes lead to trouble.
[time=1506] Friendships, how we handle them, how we approach them, God's Word is very clear, Proverbs and our 30 sayings of the wise here in the midst of Proverbs has some very strong,
[time=1516] very clear words of direction and warning regarding who you and I should spend large amounts of time with.
[time=1524] And the way the book of Proverbs comes at it, it mainly kind of gives emphasis to those that we shouldn't be with.
[time=1534] It mainly talks about those that we should steer clear from.
[time=1539] And I want to just do my best to explain to you and share with you this morning four.
[time=1544] Four types of people, four categories of individuals that the Word of God sets forth
[time=1551] that you and I don't need to be friends with.
[time=1556] Got your pins, something to write on here we go.
[time=1559] God's Word says that for you and I to experience all that he has for us, God's Word says that for you and I in order to experience the blessing and the God honoring direction that he would want for our lives,
[time=1570] we need to not get close to number one, the angry.
[time=1576] God's Word says steer clear from the angry, look at Proverbs 22, we'll pick it up in verse 24.
[time=1584] Says in Proverbs 22, 24, do not associate with a man given to anger.
[time=1589] For the purpose of our study here obviously where it says man we would say individual, man or woman, don't associate with the one given to anger or go with a hot tempered man.
[time=1600] Or what? Or you will one learn his ways and secondly it says you will find a snare for yourself.
[time=1608] Do not associate with a man given to anger or go with a hot tempered man.
[time=1614] Question for you this morning, who are the angry?
[time=1619] Or maybe better asked why are people angry?
[time=1625] A lot of ways you can answer that, a lot of different directions we could go in.
[time=1629] For the purpose of our discussion this morning, let me just say it to you this way.
[time=1632] You know what, this applies for kids, this applies for students, this applies for adults, this applies for grandma and grandpa.
[time=1638] This applies across the human board, all right?
[time=1641] Here you go, anger has to do with anger shows up, anger is a result of someone who hasn't gotten what they want.
[time=1652] Let me just say that to you again so you can all regardless of your age think that through.
[time=1657] You and I get angry when we don't get what we want.
[time=1663] And that could be a popsicle, right?
[time=1667] Or that could be a spouse that behaves the way we think they should.
[time=1672] See that could be a toy that didn't get shared or that could be a situation at work that didn't go the way you think it should have gone.
[time=1684] You see, anger is the result of us not getting what we want.
[time=1689] And it begins to show itself in all kinds of different ways.
[time=1693] Angry people are oftentimes resentful and bitter people, their anger is often characterized by harsh words and/or a mean and belligerent spirit, belligerent meaning you know what they like to fight.
[time=1705] They'll fight with you any time, any place, they'll throw their words at you, they'll throw their feeling at you, they'll throw their emotion at you, harsh words and/or a mean and belligerent spirit.
[time=1719] Sometimes this anger is active, sometimes it's very visible, sometimes it's right out there for everybody to see.
[time=1727] And you know what, sometimes in just as deadly a way it's kind of a passive deal.
[time=1733] Kind of an indifference that doesn't yell or rant and rave, it just basically says in its quietness, I don't care about you.
[time=1744] Angry people, oftentimes anger shows up in the form of manipulation, oftentimes it shows up in the form of abusive controlling speech or activity, but there's always a common thread with anger, it strikes out.
[time=1756] It gets back at you and me, it puts us in our place.
[time=1765] A lot of different words for anger in the Old Testament text, look at Proverbs 12, 26.
[time=1771] Proverbs 12, 26 says the righteous is a guide to his neighbor, but the way of the wicked, here wicked being synonymous with anger, the way of the wicked leads them astray.
[time=1785] Evil people, angry people, lead others astray, they lead adults astray, they lead students astray, they lead those dating.
[time=1793] One of the scariest things I see in the line of work I'm in is when a couple is thinking about getting married and I see this young lady with this young man and he's an angry young man.
[time=1806] And you can see it, you can notice it, you can see it in the way they relate, you can see it in the things that he does, you can see it in the way that he conducts himself in a conversation.
[time=1816] There's some things going on in here and it's not good, and so oftentimes she gets blinded, so oftentimes she's hopeful it will change, so oftentimes she believes that she can change that in him.
[time=1831] And when you come up close to that, when you get engaged to that, when you form a union with that, when you become friends with that, back to our first verse there, Proverbs 22, 24 and 25, you will verse 25, you will learn his ways and it says find a snare for yourself.
[time=1853] Deadly ground, deadly mistake, A, verse 25, A, you'll become like him, you realize that, don't you?
[time=1863] And maybe you've seen that in your own life, time spent with an angry individual, time spent being with them, time spent listening to them, time spent going with them, time spent around them, and before you know it, you've got an edge.
[time=1879] That's what God's word says will happen, verse 25, you will learn his ways and find a snare for yourself.
[time=1886] Many of you understand that phraseology, others of you might not, this is how they hunted in that day, still in some places they do hunt that way.
[time=1894] A net is laid on the pathway where the animal or the beast would be known to walk, the net would be laid covered with branches and debris, the net connected to the pulleys and the ropes that would go up to the trees, and as soon as the enemy,
[time=1908] as soon as the beast, the hunted animal put his or her feet on the net, boom, they're gathered up by the net, left to hang there until the hunter would come and slice the animal's throat and allow it to bleed to death.
[time=1925] God's word says that when you befriend, when you give yourself to an angry one, that's where that leads.
[time=1937] And I haven't been at this forever, but I've been at this long enough, folks, to tell you, that's where that leads.
[time=1950] Solomon says here, God says to us in the Word of God here through Solomon's pen, don't get close to the angry.
[time=1958] He also says stay away from the lazy, that's right, stay away from the lazy, look at Proverbs 23, we'll pick it up in verse 29.
[time=1967] Proverbs 23, 29 says this, who has woe, hardship, you know, hard times, who has sorrow, who has contentions, who has complaining, who has wounds without cause, who has redness of eyes, those who linger long over wine.
[time=1985] Those who go to taste mixed wine, do not look on the wine, it says when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup, when it goes down smoothly.
[time=1997] It says in verse 32, at the last it bites like a serpent and stings like a viper.
[time=2006] This passage speaks to, this passage is not in any way a discrediting of wine.
[time=2014] No, the issue here is one who has too much wine.
[time=2017] This is the one who has too much time on his or her hands because they sit over the wine too long.
[time=2026] This passage speaks to the slothful, the idol, the direction less.
[time=2032] Maybe you know somebody like this.
[time=2035] Maybe you're like this.
[time=2038] This passage speaks to those who sit too much, they play too much, they sleep too much, they eat and drink too much and refuse to, in the doing, refuse to give themselves to substantive pursuits.
[time=2055] Translated things that matter, endeavors that count, see they get missed because this person is directionless and idle.
[time=2068] Proverbs has a lot to say about this, Proverbs 6, verses 6 through 11.
[time=2072] Many of you have seen this before, look at the screen with me, it says go to the ant, oh sluggard, sluggard would be the lazy, sluggard would be the idol, the sluggard would be the directionless.
[time=2083] God's word says to that individual, go to the ant, oh sluggard, observe her ways and be wise.
[time=2090] Which, having no chief, officer or ruler, prepares her food in the summer and gathers her provision in the harvest.
[time=2099] How long will you lie down, oh sluggard, when will you arise from your sleep?
[time=2106] A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands and your poverty will come in like a vagabond and your need like an armed man.
[time=2118] It says in Proverbs 13, you can write that down, turn there if you'd like.
[time=2123] Proverbs 13, 4 says the soul of the sluggard craves and gets nothing.
[time=2130] The soul of the sluggard craves and gets nothing but the soul of the diligent, there's your opposite right there, diligent.
[time=2137] Stay in at it, hard working, not directionless but purposeful.
[time=2145] The soul of the sluggard craves and gets nothing but the soul of the diligent is made fat.
[time=2151] You know what, people, you and I need people, you and I need people, we need friends in our lives who get up each day.
[time=2158] You know what, we need people in our lives who get up early each day to make the most of their days because that will rub off.
[time=2168] You and I need people in our lives, we need friends who will challenge and encourage us by their involvement in things that matter.
[time=2177] I mean they may be doing this and they may be doing that but does it really matter?
[time=2181] Are those substantive pursuits or are these things that they're doing just in the end a waste of time?
[time=2190] See you and I need friends who lovingly push us to move toward or take new ground spiritually.
[time=2197] You have somebody in your life that does that.
[time=2200] Do you have somebody in your life who lovingly pushes you and encourages you to take new ground spiritually?
[time=2208] To learn new things, to read new stuff, to go deeper into the truths of God's Word.
[time=2214] Do you have people in your life who actually not only will challenge you to do that but help you move down that road?
[time=2220] Those are the friends God's Word says you and I need.
[time=2224] Do you have friends who would lovingly push you and move you toward new ground physically?
[time=2230] And the way you handle and treat your own body relationally and the way that you give yourself to others.
[time=2237] You see people friends, here's the bottom line, friends influence us.
[time=2243] They do every single day, they always have and they always will.
[time=2247] So the question for this one is this where or in what direction better said?
[time=2252] In what direction is a lazy idol friend going to influence you?
[time=2258] Answer, God's Word says the lazy idol friend will more than likely influence you toward the couch.
[time=2266] Toward the refrigerator, toward the bottle, towards a useless meaningless waste of time.
[time=2278] A directionless existence is where they lead when instead we should view every day, every moment and every breath as precious.
[time=2292] Time, right? Time, time we will never get back.
[time=2297] You realize that right? Somebody once said life is like a tape and I agree with them.
[time=2302] They said life is like a tape and the start button has been pressed and you don't get to push rewind.
[time=2311] And you have no access to the pause button. No, it just goes and the stop button isn't in your hands, is it?
[time=2321] And so as the moments go by, as the hours go by, as the days go by, time will never get back.
[time=2329] It is the person of wisdom that grabs hold of every moment and desires in his or her heart to live a purposeful life,
[time=2341] to give themselves to things of substance and to move away from the life of the slugger,
[time=2349] who sleeps a little here and slumbers a little there and folds his or her hands a little over here.
[time=2358] God's word says stay away from, don't get close to the angry, don't get close to the lazy and don't get close to number three, write it down to the evil.
[time=2369] To the evil, go to Proverbs 24.
[time=2374] Proverbs 24 verses 1 and 2, and there's something specific here about the relationship to the evil individual that he kind of brings to the forefront that we'll focus on here just for a moment.
[time=2384] Look at Proverbs 24, 1 and 2, it says do not be envious of evil men nor desire to be with them.
[time=2394] I won't ask you to raise your hand, I'll just ask you honestly to consider that this morning.
[time=2398] Anybody in the room ever been envious of the evil?
[time=2404] You ever been envious of all that guy had?
[time=2411] All she possessed, all they seemed to have at their disposal?
[time=2418] It says do not be envious of the evil men nor desire to be with them for their minds devise violence and their lips talk of trouble.
[time=2426] Now evil here in this context, it's important for you and I to remember this, important for you and I to see this.
[time=2431] Evil here in this context has specifically to do with the godless individual who is clearly opposed to what you know and I know is right and true and god honoring.
[time=2442] These people are by virtue of how they think these folks are, by virtue of how they choose.
[time=2446] They are blatantly and clearly anti-truth.
[time=2451] But that doesn't mean that these people are the ones that walk around in dark black capes with Ouija boards under their arms, dark makeup, letting evil horrible words flow out of them.
[time=2466] Those would be considered in this, they would be a part of this grouping, but no, it could just be you.
[time=2473] It could be me, it could be anybody whose mindset at any given time is anti-truth.
[time=2485] These are the evil, the godless who are opposed to what is right and true and good.
[time=2491] And sometimes that looks really, really bad and sometimes that looks almost kind of normal, which is why you and I have to be so very discerning as to who it is.
[time=2502] We give ourselves to.
[time=2504] That's why you and I need wisdom in the process of making friends.
[time=2510] Don't befriend them, it says.
[time=2511] Don't enter into partnerships with them.
[time=2513] Don't open your heart and your mind to their influence and power.
[time=2516] Look at Proverbs 3, it will come on the screen.
[time=2519] Proverbs 3, 31 to 33 says this, do not envy a man of violence and do not choose any of his ways.
[time=2525] For the devious are an abomination to the Lord, but he is intimate with the upright.
[time=2532] Then it says in verse 33, it says the curse of the Lord is on the house of the wicked, the curse of the Lord.
[time=2540] So you don't want any part of that.
[time=2542] You don't want to be near that.
[time=2543] You don't want to be up close to that.
[time=2544] You want to be a long, long way away from that.
[time=2547] The curse of the Lord is on the house of the wicked, but he blesses the dwelling of the righteous.
[time=2554] And then you can write this down, Psalm 37 verses 1 and 2.
[time=2558] Psalm 37 verses 1 and 2 says, do not fret because of evil doers, be not envious toward wrong doers.
[time=2567] For they will wither quickly, remember this.
[time=2570] They will wither quickly like the grass and fade like the green herb.
[time=2577] Here one minute gone the next, then it says in verse 35, you can see it there, verse 35, Psalm 37.
[time=2585] I have seen a wicked, violent man spreading himself like a luxuriant tree in its native soil.
[time=2591] That's how it looks, doesn't it?
[time=2593] Sometimes they just kind of spread themselves out, like here I am.
[time=2599] God's word says be careful, then he passed away, and lo he was no more.
[time=2604] I sought for him, but he could not be found.
[time=2608] Mark the blameless man, mark the blameless man, and behold the upright.
[time=2614] For the man of peace will have a posterity, but transgressors will be altogether destroyed.
[time=2622] The posterity of the wicked will be cut off.
[time=2629] And you know usually that's how it works, the one attempting to honor God and be content with what God has provided is so many times enticed, seduced, and lured away from contentment
[time=2640] by the prosperity, the luxury, and the excitement of life that they see lived
[time=2649] on the lives of those that are wicked.
[time=2653] Proverbs 13.20.
[time=2656] Proverbs 13.20 says this.
[time=2659] It says, "He who walks with wise men," we could kind of summarize the whole talk this morning right here.
[time=2664] You see that on the screen?
[time=2665] "He who walks with wise men will be wise, but the companion of fools will suffer harm."
[time=2677] And that's just the flat-out truth.
[time=2682] I was reading this week, let me read this to you.
[time=2684] This means that we can enhance our chances.
[time=2687] Listen, this means we can enhance our chances of growing in a God-honoring direction
[time=2693] by choosing the right people with whom we become friends.
[time=2697] If we want to develop sober judgment, if we want to develop sober judgment, anybody in the room this morning want to develop sober judgment, well then we should choose friends renowned, known for making wise decisions.
[time=2711] If we want to strengthen our convictions, sound good?
[time=2715] If we want to strengthen our convictions, we should pick people with reputations for standing up for what they believe.
[time=2722] If we wish we were kinder, nicer people, we should spend more time with those who treat others with gentleness and grace.
[time=2730] If we want to walk more closely with God, we should put ourselves under the influences of people who make spiritual disciplines a priority.
[time=2739] Choosing the right friends is like putting together our own spiritual development team.
[time=2744] It will greatly enhance our efforts in moving forward on the right path.
[time=2749] But, don't miss this, but the converse is also true.
[time=2754] Foolish friends can ruin us.
[time=2757] Their folly can seat deep into our lives and taint our desires and goals.
[time=2763] Their faulty moral compass can steer us off course.
[time=2768] Their distortions of truth can undermine our understanding of God and His ways.
[time=2777] That's how that happens and that's why it says in 1 Corinthians 15, 33, write that down, 1 Corinthians 15, 33, do not be misled.
[time=2789] Bad company, what?
[time=2792] Bad company corrupts, it just does.
[time=2796] Bad company corrupts good character.
[time=2800] Your grandma may have told you that, your daddy may have told you that.
[time=2804] Somebody may be telling you that today, you know what? It's true.
[time=2809] And I want you to know how that verse begins.
[time=2811] 1 Corinthians 15, 33, do not be deceived or do not be misled.
[time=2818] Who? Answer me this, who's the deceiver? Answer, Satan.
[time=2825] Who's the great misleading? Satan, the enemy.
[time=2829] And don't you know, you gotta know, don't you know that he understands how this works?
[time=2834] And he is going through with everything he has, attempt to mislead you, to deceive you,
[time=2840] to think that you know what, he's just a decent guy.
[time=2843] He's just been a little bit of time with him, it's not that big a deal.
[time=2848] I'm just dating him, mom, I'm not like gonna marry him, you know?
[time=2853] Or honey, come on, just give me a break, they're just, I mean, they're just some good guys and it's just kind of fun to be with them and it's really gonna be okay, don't worry about it.
[time=2868] He wants nothing more than to deceive you, 12-year-old, 15-year-old, 40-year-old,
[time=2875] because the truth of the matter is bad company corrupts and that is exactly what he wants
[time=2883] to see happen in your life and mine.
[time=2886] God's Word says stay away from the angry, don't become friends, don't become close with,
[time=2894] don't share your heart and life with the lazy, move away from the evil.
[time=2899] And lastly, he says, don't be close to, don't become friends with the rebellious,
[time=2905] write that down, the rebellious, those who are rebels, look at Proverbs chapter 12.
[time=2914] Proverbs chapter 12, verse one, you see it right there, whoever loves discipline,
[time=2920] who ever loves discipline, loves knowledge.
[time=2925] But he who hates reproof is what?
[time=2930] Say it louder, we don't get to say that word very often, right?
[time=2933] But you can say it because I told you you could, say it louder one more time, go.
[time=2937] Stupid.
[time=2939] And you get in the Bible, so now you can just kind of say it in this conversation and we can just say it with all the emotion and energy it deserves, you know what, you're stupid.
[time=2949] I don't like saying that to you.
[time=2954] And I don't like it when you have to say it back to me, but that's the truth.
[time=2957] You're stupid.
[time=2959] If somehow you see all of this, if somehow you get exposed to all of this, this truth that just
[time=2969] so clearly shows you that this plus this equals this.
[time=2976] And so after it's all said and done, if what you're going to do is come to the table and say, you know what, I don't want to be instructed.
[time=2982] I don't want reproof.
[time=2984] I don't want the parameters of God honoring living.
[time=2987] I don't want it.
[time=2991] Then A, this is all going to happen, and B, the bottom line on you and me when that's our
[time=2997] heart, when that's our response is that we're just playing what?
[time=3001] Stupid.
[time=3003] The rebellious, who are these people?
[time=3006] These are the prideful, self-centered individuals who seem to find great enjoyment in going
[time=3012] against the God honoring grain.
[time=3015] You know anybody like that?
[time=3017] They seem to take great pride in going against the grain of obedience.
[time=3023] It's like this, if spiritual health and God honoring living looks like this, they do that.
[time=3032] If God honoring living, if God honoring living means the answer is yes, they say, what?
[time=3041] No.
[time=3043] If positive, spiritual movement calls them to move in their walk with Him, here they just
[time=3051] are going to go there.
[time=3055] Because there's this spirit of rebellion in them that they've fostered.
[time=3059] And as if they enjoy a bad reputation, they choose rebellion.
[time=3064] And I know I've said it or inferred it earlier in our talk here, but let me just say it to you again and write this down and hang on to this.
[time=3072] What does the rebel hate?
[time=3074] What is it that the rebellious abhor?
[time=3076] What the rebellious hate, and then they teach you and I to hate, and watch this, they
[time=3083] friends influence you, and when you befriend a rebel, and when you spend time with a rebel,
[time=3090] they begin to influence you and teach you to hate these two things as well.
[time=3096] Because a rebel hates instruction and a rebel hates spiritual discipline.
[time=3102] They hate it.
[time=3103] They despise it.
[time=3107] And it's absolutely heartbreaking because of where that leads Proverbs 13.
[time=3112] Proverbs 13, 18, poverty and shame.
[time=3117] These aren't just words that he throws out here.
[time=3119] This is the truth, people.
[time=3121] Poverty and shame will come to him who neglects discipline.
[time=3126] But he who regards reproof will be honored.
[time=3132] He who loves instruction.
[time=3134] He who loves the spiritual disciplines.
[time=3138] They're not perfect at it, but they're open to it.
[time=3140] They crave it.
[time=3141] They want to be who God's called them to be.
[time=3145] God says that person.
[time=3146] Proverbs 13, 18 is honored.
[time=3151] We'll go back to the beginning of Proverbs.
[time=3154] Way back here in chapter 1, we saw this spelled out for us at the very onset of our study.
[time=3160] Proverbs 1, 22 with the rebellious in mind.
[time=3164] Look at what it says.
[time=3166] How long Proverbs 1, 22, how long oh naive 1, how long oh rebellious 1.
[time=3174] How long will you love being simple minded?
[time=3178] And scoffers delight themselves in scoffing.
[time=3182] And fools hate knowledge.
[time=3186] scoffers delight themselves in scoffing.
[time=3189] You know what that means?
[time=3191] A rebel scoffs.
[time=3194] A rebel says, a rebel says, where are you going?
[time=3197] The church?
[time=3199] Where are you going?
[time=3203] Are you going to youth group?
[time=3204] What is that?
[time=3208] Why don't you grow up and get a real life?
[time=3211] Hey, what are you doing over there?
[time=3212] What are you but spending time in your Bible?
[time=3216] Scoffing.
[time=3218] It's the heart of a rebel.
[time=3223] Okay, verse 30.
[time=3224] They would not accept my counsel.
[time=3226] They spurned all my reproof, so they shall eat of the fruit of their own way and be satiated,
[time=3233] covered with their own devices.
[time=3235] For the waywardness of the naive will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them.
[time=3247] So people I know today is a very simple four points.
[time=3253] It's really a very basic topic, but it reaches deep into the everyday of your life in mind.
[time=3259] Let me just say it to you this way.
[time=3261] Wise friends will, if we just take all that we've seen, if you take all the verses that we've looked up,
[time=3267] if you take this whole discussion and you kind of just summarize it in one concluding statement.
[time=3272] Here's the truth.
[time=3273] Wise friends will help you.
[time=3279] They will help grow you.
[time=3280] They will help mature you.
[time=3282] They will help solidify you.
[time=3284] Wise friends will help move you in a direction that honors God and brings blessing and the best that God has for you to your life.
[time=3294] Angry friends, lazy friends, evil friends, rebellious friends will not only influence you but ruin you.
[time=3303] Wise friends will help you.
[time=3305] The others will ruin you.
[time=3308] And I don't want you to forget something.
[time=3311] I don't want you to forget that while the angry, lazy, evil and rebellious aren't to be embraced as intimate friends,
[time=3318] don't forget this people, they are in need.
[time=3322] See, it's really important that we just stop for a moment and just recognize that there are angry and rebellious and lazy and angry people in this room.
[time=3334] There's an angry, rebellious, lazy person on the stage.
[time=3342] See, I can be -- I know this is talking about those characterized by that, see, but I can be prone to these things.
[time=3349] You catch me on the wrong day at the wrong time and you can see these four things, evidenced in the way I sometimes can respond to you as well.
[time=3362] Now, I don't believe I am and I never want to be characterized by these things in my life.
[time=3369] And I don't want that for you.
[time=3373] But don't forget that those that are, they're broken.
[time=3382] Something went wrong.
[time=3385] Something happened.
[time=3388] It's like that woman at the well in John 4, we always say it, they're thirsty.
[time=3395] And shame on you and shame on me.
[time=3398] If ever in our appropriate -- now, this is a fine line, watch this.
[time=3403] See, we have to appropriately distance ourselves to be in line with what God's word teaches.
[time=3410] I can't become intimate friends with him, but what can I do?
[time=3416] Can I pray for him?
[time=3418] Can I do everything I can within an appropriate distance to encourage him towards what is right and good and true you bet?
[time=3425] Can I invite friends of mine to gather and pray for him?
[time=3429] I mean, it's so very important that we, on the one hand today, folks, as you view your world of friendships, that you honor what God's word says and don't become friends with those he says not to become friends with.
[time=3439] But the whole counsel of God's word would remind you and I that they are broken, that they need help, help that only he can bring, and he uses us to point people from an appropriate distance in God honoring directions.
[time=3457] Well, I'm going to ask Corbin and the team to come up and let me just say this to you as we close. Some of you might be sitting here thinking, "Hey, you know what, Kelly, I appreciate the whole thing on the friends that are that way, but you know what, my husband is that way."
[time=3474] Or my wife is that way.
[time=3476] Does this mean I get a free pass?
[time=3479] I mean, basically, what you're saying is we're not supposed to be with those folks, my spouse is that way, so can I go?
[time=3484] Well, no, not necessarily. That's not how that works.
[time=3489] But I will tell you this, there is plenty of room for you in that relationship and marriage to do your very best to lovingly offer a biblical admonition, to lovingly offer him or her a reminder of who it is God's called them to be.
[time=3508] It's way within bounds for you and I to end those relationships to our very best to seek wise counsel as to how we should live with and conduct ourselves and those difficult, difficult relationships.
[time=3522] But no, this is not a green light for you to check out.
[time=3526] And as hard as it might get, please hear me on this. As hard as it might get, the more difficult it becomes, the more I would invite you to ask for help, for wisdom to know how to live with and give yourself to someone who may be characterized by those things.
