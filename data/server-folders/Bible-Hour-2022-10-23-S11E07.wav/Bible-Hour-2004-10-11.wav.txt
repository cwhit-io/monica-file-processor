[time=30] [MUSIC - 160 seconds]
[time=200] Hey, I want to just talk to you for a moment before Marty comes and sings, and I want to just talk to you about something that we're going to talk about a little bit later in our morning.
[time=209] And that is the fact that part of you and I living out our faith.
[time=215] Part of you and I doing what God sometimes calls us to do entails and requires that at times we have you and I have scary sometimes challenging conversations with those that we love.
[time=229] What I mean by that is this, you know and I know that there are times when those that you love people that we care a great deal for.
[time=237] They begin to make choices and they begin to go down roads and they begin to kind of experience a pattern of living that moves them in very, very dangerous directions, takes them into very, very scary, spiritual, personal territory.
[time=252] And so there are times when we have to do our best to go to lunch or have them come by the house or sometimes even go to theirs.
[time=264] I've been there many a time, you've been there, I'm sure many a time, and sometimes it's very, very scary.
[time=271] But I want you to be reminded this morning of how very important it is, what an amazing situation, what an amazing position God places you and I in as members of the body of Christ.
[time=281] And if we're willing to really love Him and love them that much, then there are times when we have to go and speak.
[time=291] There are times when we have to go and plead.
[time=295] Sometimes we have to go and beg.
[time=298] But if we love Him and we love them that much, we will.
[time=303] You and I know, I've stayed across many a restaurant table and taken a deep breath because there was so much at stake.
[time=311] And you and I know how challenging that can be.
[time=314] It's part of what God's called us to though and so as Marty sings this morning, listen.
[time=319] Listen to the words, identify with that calling and commit in your heart maybe anew today to be somebody who's willing to go that far to say what needs to be said to love that much.
[time=349] Father, hear my prayer.
[time=354] I need the perfect words, words that He will hear and know they're straight from you.
[time=362] I don't know what to say.
[time=365] I only know what hurts to see my only friend so they fade away, so maybe this time I'll speak the words of life.
[time=378] With your fire in my eyes.
[time=383] But that old familiar fear is tearing at my works.
[time=389] What I'm so afraid of, 'cause here I go again.
[time=394] Talking 'bout the rain and mulling all the things that won't live fast today.
[time=402] And as a dance around the truth, time is not his friend.
[time=408] And this might be my last chance to tell him that you love him, but here I go again.
[time=419] Here I go again.
[time=427] Lord, you love him so. You gave your only son if he will just believe.
[time=435] He will never die, but how then will he know what he has never heard.
[time=443] Lord, he has never seen mirrored in my life, so maybe this time I'll speak the words of life.
[time=454] With your fire in my eyes.
[time=458] But that old familiar fear is tearing at my works.
[time=464] What I'm so afraid of, 'cause here I go again.
[time=469] I'm talking 'bout the rain and mulling all the things that won't live fast today.
[time=476] And as a dance around the truth, time is not his friend.
[time=482] And this might be my last chance to tell him that you love him, so here I go again.
[time=492] Here I go, here I go.
[time=522] I'm talking 'bout the rain and mulling all the things that won't live fast today.
[time=532] And as a dance around the truth, time is not his friend.
[time=542] I'm talking 'bout the rain and mulling all the things that won't live fast today.
[time=550] And as a dance around the truth, time is not his friend.
[time=556] And this might be my last chance to tell him that you love him.
[time=574] You love him, you love him.
[time=588] What am I so afraid of, what am I so afraid of, what am I so afraid of, what am I so afraid of, what am I so afraid of, what am I so afraid of, what am I so afraid of, what am I so afraid of, how then will he know, what he has never heard.
[time=613] The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, fools despise wisdom and instruction.
[time=618] Train up a child in the way he should go, even when he is old, he will not depart from it.
[time=623] If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat, and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink.
[time=628] Trust in the Lord with all your heart and do not lean on your own understanding.
[time=632] Take my instruction and not silver and knowledge rather than choices gold.
[time=637] A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.
[time=667] Well, we do want to welcome you back this morning to our study of the Book of Proverbs.
[time=677] So thankful for what we've seen so far in these recent weeks and so very thankful that for you and I, as we do our best to navigate through the storms of life, that's the title we've given the series, and as you and I do our best with his help to navigate through these storms of life,
[time=696] these circumstances and situations that you and I oftentimes find ourselves in.
[time=702] Be it with friends, be it at work, be it at home, be it in the quietness and privacy of our own heart and soul.
[time=710] Wherever it takes place, we are so grateful that we can turn to God's Word, that we can come together in a study like this of God's Word, specifically the Book of Proverbs where we find such great truth, such great wisdom, such great understanding and insight from God Himself.
[time=727] In recent weeks, we've talked about how to handle our finances, how we handle our friends, how we handle family.
[time=733] Today we come to this issue of the way in which we handle our faith.
[time=739] The way in which we handle our faith.
[time=741] Question for you this morning.
[time=742] Think about this with me if you would.
[time=744] Question, when is our faith most compelling?
[time=748] You and I, those of us in the room this morning, that know Him, have a relationship with Him.
[time=753] When is our faith most compelling to others?
[time=757] When is our faith most contagious to those that He would put around us?
[time=762] When is our faith most powerful in what it represents and what it communicates?
[time=767] When is our faith most recognizable?
[time=769] When is our faith most God honoring?
[time=772] Question for you this morning.
[time=774] When is your faith at its best?
[time=778] Answer, when you live it out.
[time=785] When you live it out.
[time=788] When what we say, when what we choose in the day to day, when the activity of our lives is consistent with our statements of faith.
[time=798] When I am a follower of Christ matches up with Christ following living.
[time=810] Then and there our faith gets real powerful.
[time=813] Then and there our faith is very, very compelling.
[time=817] James talked about this in chapter 2.
[time=819] James chapter 2 verses 14 through 17.
[time=822] You can turn there, you can write that down, you can follow along on the screen.
[time=826] James said, in James chapter 2, he asks a question.
[time=831] He says, what use is it, my brethren?
[time=833] If someone says, right, what we proclaim, what we say, what we profess, what use is it?
[time=839] If somebody says they have faith, but he has no works, can that faith save him?
[time=848] What do you think?
[time=849] Don't answer.
[time=850] Think about it.
[time=851] Some of you know the answer.
[time=853] Others of you, maybe you're thinking this through for the first time.
[time=856] Can that faith, the faith without works, can that faith save you?
[time=861] Well, he gives an example here.
[time=862] If a brother or sister is without clothing and in need of daily food, and one of you says to them, go in peace.
[time=870] Be warmed and be filled.
[time=872] In other words, you just give them a bunch of talk.
[time=875] And yet you do not give them what is necessary for their body.
[time=879] What use is that?
[time=881] James 2 17, even so, faith.
[time=884] If it has no works is dead being by itself.
[time=891] You don't get faith by doing works.
[time=894] No real faith produces works.
[time=899] Faith is validated.
[time=901] What's validated mean?
[time=903] Shown to be real.
[time=905] You see, real true saving faith is shown to be real when it produces real genuine regular, not perfect, but real genuine regular activity consistent with godliness.
[time=920] Spiritual activity consistent with one's profession.
[time=924] And this morning, I'd like you to join me back in the book of Proverbs as we identify three very practical ways in which our faith can be lived.
[time=934] Hundreds and hundreds of ways our faith can be lived out.
[time=939] This morning, we'll look at three.
[time=940] All right, just going to try our best to give you three ways that you and I can have a faith that is compelling and contagious and powerful and God honoring when we live it out in these arenas.
[time=954] Three, here we go.
[time=955] Number one, write it down.
[time=956] If you're taking notes, God's word tells us to live out our faith.
[time=959] Show others that it's real by number one, working hard.
[time=965] Working hard.
[time=966] I would add to that, working well.
[time=969] Working well.
[time=970] Working hard and working well.
[time=972] Our faith has lived out when we work hard and well.
[time=975] Proverbs 22, 29 says, "Do you see a man skilled?" Very important word there.
[time=981] "Do you see a man skilled in his work?" He will.
[time=985] That one will.
[time=986] That man will stand before kings.
[time=988] He will not stand before obscure man, this one who is skilled in his work.
[time=995] Well, when you look at that phrase in the Hebrew, the original language there of the Old Testament, you see that that word skilled means this.
[time=1003] One who has honed.
[time=1005] One who has sharpened.
[time=1007] One who has honed his or her craft.
[time=1010] The one who has worked hard to improve his or her craft.
[time=1015] This is talking about the one who is diligent in his or her work.
[time=1019] Disciplined in his or her work.
[time=1021] Determined in his or her work.
[time=1024] The one who is skilled is the one who has worked hard to hone and refine the craft.
[time=1030] The teacher.
[time=1031] People.
[time=1032] The garbage collector.
[time=1035] The administrative assistant.
[time=1037] The financial planner.
[time=1038] The landscaper.
[time=1039] The banker.
[time=1040] The supervisor.
[time=1041] The doctor.
[time=1042] The teller.
[time=1043] The nurse.
[time=1044] The government official.
[time=1045] The computer programmer or street sweeper.
[time=1048] It doesn't matter what you do.
[time=1050] God's word says do it well.
[time=1054] Be skilled at it.
[time=1058] And I want to just pause there for a moment.
[time=1060] I'm surprised.
[time=1061] I really am still.
[time=1062] I mean we've talked about this enough and I maybe we just need to keep talking about it and keep reading it and keep encouraging you with it.
[time=1069] Just bumping into people and I get the distinct sense from some that they're almost.
[time=1074] I feel like there's this issue about you know what you do.
[time=1077] I'll bump into folks or we'll talk and when it comes to what they do.
[time=1081] You know because it's not this or because it's not that or because they don't live here or because they don't.
[time=1086] You know what?
[time=1087] It doesn't matter.
[time=1092] What matters is that wherever you are and wherever God's placed you and whatever it is he's given you to do.
[time=1098] Between eight and five or seven and three or third shift, second shift.
[time=1106] You know whatever you do God says you have a chance as a follower of Christ to do it well.
[time=1114] And in doing it well here's the cool thing.
[time=1116] In doing it well and being disciplined at your work bringing honor and great glory to him.
[time=1122] That's right 1 Corinthians 1031.
[time=1124] You can turn there you can write that down 1 Corinthians 1031 32 and 33.
[time=1131] Look what happens when you and I work well for instance.
[time=1134] Whether then you eat or drink right?
[time=1136] Whether you're eating or drinking or whatever you do.
[time=1139] Do all to the glory of God.
[time=1142] Give no offense either to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God.
[time=1148] By not doing it to the glory of God you would give offense.
[time=1150] He says don't give offense just as I also please all men and all things.
[time=1155] Not seeking my own prophet but the prophet of the many so that they may be saved.
[time=1161] There's even evangelistic activity that takes place in the midst of you and I working well.
[time=1167] Working hard being diligent being determined no matter what you do.
[time=1173] You get to live out your faith bring great great glory to God.
[time=1179] When you bring no offense to those who watch you work especially those who still consider.
[time=1185] Especially those who are still wondering what it is about you that makes you so unique.
[time=1192] One more thing to keep in mind on the working hard working well front.
[time=1198] I'm reminded of the movie "Remember the Titans" and Denzel Washington is standing out in front of the bus.
[time=1205] He's not ready to go off the training camp and he's got the two who are trying to make some kind of statement and he kind of puts them in their place then he gets up real close to their face.
[time=1214] Do you remember? Gets up real close. He says one last thing boys.
[time=1217] Now remember what does he say? Who's your daddy? Who's your daddy?
[time=1222] Well I want you to remember this morning something Christ's follower in the workplace.
[time=1227] Who's your boss? Think about it.
[time=1233] Biblically speaking this morning be reminded who is your boss?
[time=1239] And I hope your mind is not going to a picture of him or her or whoever the guy might be
[time=1247] because Colossians 3. Colossians 3 would be a great reminder for you and I this morning.
[time=1253] Look at that would you? Just a great reminder. Colossians chapter 3 verses 23 to 25.
[time=1263] Just after Philippians it says in Colossians 3 23 says whatever you do do your work heartily.
[time=1269] Whatever you do do your work heartily. That means in the Greek it means from the soul right?
[time=1275] Now come on what do you do? What's your job? Where are you each day?
[time=1280] Whatever you do wherever you are whatever it entails God's words says number one do it heartily.
[time=1288] From the soul man I love this here we go are you ready for another day?
[time=1293] Thank you God for the chance to bring glory to you as I give a discipline determined effort.
[time=1302] It's probably not your typical scene on Monday morning driving to work right?
[time=1305] Well think about it says heartily as for the Lord rather than for men.
[time=1310] Why? Knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward way past the paycheck.
[time=1315] Knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance.
[time=1319] It is the Lord Christ whom you serve. Who's your boss?
[time=1325] The Lord Jesus Christ and I don't care if you're managing a fund somewhere.
[time=1330] I don't care if you're picking up garbage. Praise God for both of you.
[time=1336] And know that you can bring great great glory to him and live out your faith in a compelling way when you do it for him.
[time=1345] Amen?
[time=1347] Secondly back to the book of Proverbs. Secondly God's Word says here as we look through Proverbs God's Word says that you can live out your faith by speaking well.
[time=1359] By speaking well look at Proverbs 23. Proverbs 23 verses 15 and 16.
[time=1367] My son if your heart is wise I can see myself saying this maybe you can as well to a son or daughter.
[time=1374] My son if your heart is wise my own heart also will be glad and my inmost being way down deep inside of me will rejoice when your lips speak what is right.
[time=1388] It's great truth and that isn't there.
[time=1392] It's great truth that when wisdom when remember what we've learned so far when wisdom fills the heart great truth is spoken.
[time=1403] When wisdom is kept far from the heart when wisdom is neglected perverse things of folly lies and inconsistencies come out.
[time=1415] Now I'm going to ask you this morning to bear with me on this.
[time=1418] I'm going to take a liberty here that I don't normally take okay.
[time=1422] Because as you read that verse and as you hear me talk about speaking well those of you who are familiar at all with God's Word would know that there are a myriad of places we could go this morning.
[time=1433] To talk about and teach about the tongue the words that we say and not only what they communicate to others but what they even say about us in the condition of our hearts.
[time=1444] But I've just felt compelled lately and there's a there's an indirect connection here usually I'm not much for indirect connections when we're teaching God's Word.
[time=1454] But this morning I felt prompted to just share with you some things indirectly about your voice and mine and the opportunity that we as believers have to speak on November 2nd.
[time=1470] November 2nd is a very very important day in the life of this country of ours.
[time=1476] And I believe that it is related to what we see here I believe that wisdom shows itself in the way you and I speak not only to our wives or our husbands or our kids but even in the way we would speak as it relates to a vote.
[time=1489] And I don't want to prolong this I just want to take a couple of minutes and say basically two things.
[time=1494] Number one I want to say to all of you this I want to say to you vote.
[time=1499] And that might just sound like commonplace to many of you but I'm aware of the fact that for others of you you need you need the kick you need the nudge you might need the reminder.
[time=1510] Thousands and thousands of people have given their lives my friends so that we could live in a country that's free so that we could on November 2nd exercise our voice.
[time=1522] Exercise the right that we've been given because of those who have offered and sacrificed so much to speak.
[time=1529] And so first of all I just want to make a general plea to everybody no matter what color, party, red or blue, republican, democrat, elephant, dummy, forget that for a moment I just want to ask you to vote.
[time=1543] I believe it's a privilege and I believe it's a right.
[time=1547] Now as far as how you vote let me just say this most of you know that I'm very very uncomfortable with I don't make it a practice.
[time=1556] I won't make it a practice I seldom if ever mix politics and the pulpit.
[time=1563] I don't believe for a heartbeat that that's what this is for don't believe this is for politics.
[time=1569] I think this is for the teaching of God's Word.
[time=1574] And I don't really have much to say to you about how you vote as it relates to the economy, jobs, the Taliban, health care.
[time=1586] I mean we could talk about it and I would have some things to say to you but I don't feel at all compelled to start creating a list of check boxes that you and I need to consistently follow as it relates to those things.
[time=1598] But there is one issue that I feel very very strongly about.
[time=1604] One issue that I would hope you would consider as you step into that booth and cast your vote.
[time=1613] And again regardless of your party affiliation and it's an issue that I think transcends politics.
[time=1621] Politics politicians have tried to make it political but it is in the end I believe biblical and universally true and that one issue that I hope you'll consider is the sanctity of life.
[time=1636] The preciousness of life. I believe God's Word teaches throughout the Psalms and other places that life is formed, life is formed in the womb.
[time=1647] That at the point of conception there is a clear distinction, a clear presence of life, God given life and I believe to end that life no matter the circumstance is murder.
[time=1663] And I believe God's Word teaches that.
[time=1666] And I've heard all the arguments and I've read all the pamphlets and I've heard all the debates and you know what I think bottom line we've just we've had too many kids.
[time=1674] I've seen too many ultrasounds my friends, it's a life.
[time=1680] It is a life from the very moment it begins and please on the other circumstances you know I heard it again last week in the debate.
[time=1690] I read it in the paper again this week talking about cases of rape, cases of incest.
[time=1696] And as unspeakable and as deplorable as those acts of violence are I would I would beg you may be here this morning you may have experienced that.
[time=1708] You may have friends or family that have found themselves in that situation as awful and as evil as that stuff is.
[time=1715] I would with great respect plead with you to realize that our God is bigger than that.
[time=1724] And that no matter that no matter the circumstance that the Word of God is true the Spirit of God is powerful the people of God can extend hands.
[time=1734] There are options that can be pursued and a home can be found for a little one and you know what healing can be found for a heart.
[time=1743] And so I just encourage you to vote your values and I hope if you know him that your values are connected to this.
[time=1752] Amen? All right.
[time=1756] So use the opportunity that God has provided us to cast your vote and to use your voice and speak and speak well.
[time=1764] Speak with wisdom and insight.
[time=1766] Number three moving along thank you for allowing me the slight digression fighting for the captives or pursuing the missing.
[time=1774] We get to live out here it is folks this is what Marty is saying about this morning.
[time=1777] We get to live out our faith by pursuing those who are missing.
[time=1783] Fighting for the captives write them both down.
[time=1786] There's something about those phrases you see people in your life and mind have found themselves or put themselves in situations where they're walking down roads that lead the danger and death and destruction.
[time=1797] And God says that part of you and I living on our faith is our willingness and our readiness to go after them.
[time=1805] Lovingly tactfully yes but nonetheless at times aggressively and passionately look at Proverbs 24.
[time=1816] Proverbs 24 I want you to note the verbiage I want you to note how it's written this is this is clearly a call to action.
[time=1824] Proverbs 24 verse 11 deliver he's telling you to deliver those who are being taken away to death.
[time=1834] And those who are staggering to slaughter you hold them back.
[time=1841] You catch the this is not a passive response to you catch the active response he's calling you and I to deliver those who are being taken away to death.
[time=1850] Those who are staggering to slaughter oh hold them back and if you say what I didn't see anybody staggering to slaughter.
[time=1860] He says if you say see we did not know this does he not consider it who weighs the hearts he knows your heart he knows what you saw he knows what you were aware of he knows what you turned away from.
[time=1873] And does he not know it who keeps your soul and will he not render to man according to his work.
[time=1880] God's word says right there in that verse to you and I he'll deal with you he'll he will hold you accountable for the back that you turned.
[time=1888] For the lunch that you didn't have for the words that you didn't speak.
[time=1894] These two verses here place a great weight of responsibility and opportunity and privilege in your lap in mind and we've got to give this some thought here today.
[time=1906] We've got to give this some thought.
[time=1910] You know some people you know some people as do I and they are at you know him you can picture them right now.
[time=1917] They may be sitting here in this room with you today they may be at home watching TV they may be halfway across the country or world but you know some people and they are absolutely walking straight toward the cliff.
[time=1933] Actually some are running and the text gives us great insight here these people are in trouble and the text gives us great insight.
[time=1943] Not only are they walking but verse 11 says they're being look at verse 11 it says that deliver those who are being taken away.
[time=1952] Something's got a hold of them something has come over them and you and I know what that something is better yet you and I know who that someone is people the enemy.
[time=1962] This passage reminds you and I today that the enemy is engaged in the daily battle of your life and mind.
[time=1971] He knows.
[time=1977] You say he knows what.
[time=1979] You know what he knows.
[time=1981] See he's not as smart as God but he's really really smart and for some reason there's this level of insight that he has and he knows you.
[time=1990] See he knows let's see here.
[time=1992] He knows how good your marriage could be.
[time=1997] He knows that.
[time=1998] He knows what a testimony it would be.
[time=2000] He knows what a powerful picture it could be.
[time=2003] See he knows that if you really let go of your pride and if you really humbled yourself really and if you really gave yourself to unconditional pursuit of him or her see he knows how good your marriage can be so he's doing everything within his power.
[time=2019] Throwing everything at you he's got in his arsenal to have your marriage crumble or to have your marriage at least be less than what it could be because he knows if he gets that accomplished.
[time=2032] He has lessened the kingdom effort.
[time=2034] See he knows.
[time=2037] He knows about you businessman.
[time=2040] He knows about you businesswoman and see he knows what an impact you could have in the marketplace.
[time=2047] He knows that if you really got your eyes off the gold if you really got your eyes off the silver if you really got your eyes off the bottom line to a point and fix your gaze on him and begin to live your life working hard and diligently and in a determined way giving
[time=2065] yourself to your business which is great he's given you the gifts and tools to do that but if you did that coupled with this huge and growing heart for people.
[time=2074] And for those in the marketplace who you may encounter see he knows if you do that boy he's in trouble so now he throws all he's got at you.
[time=2083] Day after day after day the onslaught of materialism and greed see he knows high school student in the room this morning college student see he knows that you're the next generation of the church.
[time=2100] He knows that your lives in 5 to 10 years from now will be the lives giving guidance to his bride.
[time=2108] And so 12 year olds through 18 year olds he is going to do everything he can to ruin you.
[time=2118] He knows all of this.
[time=2123] And because he knows all of it first Peter 5 8 you can write that down in your notes if you'd like to because he knows all of that first Peter 5 8 says listen he prowls around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour.
[time=2139] He prowls around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour he is engaged people in the daily battle of your life.
[time=2148] Hey question for you when does a lion roar before or after the kill answer say it louder.
[time=2165] Yeah is a lion going to roar before the kill as he sneaks up as a lion going to roar then yes or no no a lion roars when after the kill first Peter says he's roaring.
[time=2182] There's a great imagery there you know what it says he just got somebody and he's coming after you.
[time=2190] And he's been getting them for years and he keeps roaring and he's coming after me.
[time=2199] A lot of ways we could go here this morning let me just say this I want to say this to 20 to 30 year olds.
[time=2206] I could talk to 30 to 40 year olds I could talk to everybody this morning let me just focus in for a moment and let me just say this to 20 to 30 year olds.
[time=2216] If you're 20 to 30 years of age in this room and you might be married you might be married with kids you might not be married no big deal.
[time=2223] Let me just say this to you and let me say it to you as clearly and as seriously as I can 20 to 30 year olds the generation behind you is getting slaughtered.
[time=2239] They're getting absolutely tagged daily. See I hear too much I see too much it just keeps coming stories keep coming situations keep unfolding crises keep hitting.
[time=2256] 20 to 30 year olds listen to me the generation behind you I'm not saying you're not getting hit I'm just telling you the generation behind you is getting slaughtered.
[time=2264] Sexual promiscuity has never been higher commitment levels among that same age range 12 to 18 years of age commitment levels have never been lower teenage addictions and disorders have never been more prevalent.
[time=2281] The family which is at the root of this thing is in probably the worst shape it's ever been in and and and and and access to the evil ones life threatening schemes has never been easier or more available.
[time=2299] I wrote it down it's kind of a crude analogy but it's like spiritual satanic tea ball I'm serious it's what it feels like to me as I watch it you've seen tea ball games haven't you?
[time=2309] The ball just gets set up on the tee and the kid walks up and just takes a whack at it.
[time=2314] It's not hard to hit it I mean the older they get especially they just kill the thing it just sitting right there and I feel like 12 to 18 year olds are getting set up on a tee and the enemy's coming day after day just absolutely teeing off on them.
[time=2334] And they need help and I'll get to parents in a second but guess what 20 to 30 year olds guess why I mentioned you because guess who a 14 year old will listen to more readily and more quickly than almost anybody.
[time=2351] A cool 24 year old cool a Christ following 26 year old who's not perfect but they're in the Christ following game and they haven't tossed all the values and they haven't chucked all the morals they're still in the fight
[time=2370] and they still care about what's good and right and true 12 year olds through 18 year olds if connected with those folks wow.
[time=2381] So 20 to 30 year olds you know what we need your help students need your help today they need your wisdom.
[time=2388] I know those parents of 24 year olds going oh my goodness who's wisdom.
[time=2396] You're 24 year old wisdom his or her life and experience his or her commitment to Christ we've got a student ministry team that would love to talk to you.
[time=2406] They need help they need relevant 20 to 30 year olds who are genuinely in the Christ following game genuinely committed to the truth of God's Word not perfect but willing and you know what else they need.
[time=2417] These 12 to 18 year olds they need parents my friends not buddies they need moms and dads not best friends they need parents who won't just cut them loose on the internet.
[time=2434] Come on people you got to keep up on this you got to keep up on this you got to love them enough to know where they're going and not just out of the house but in the house.
[time=2446] They need parents who won't cut them loose on the internet or with a cell phone they need parents in other words they need parents who will actually exercise discernment in what is going on what is taking place.
[time=2461] And to do that lovingly and to do it in the context of a relationship see any parents who will go out to breakfast with them they need moms and dads who will go to lunch or dinner with them.
[time=2472] They need parents who will sit in a room late at night and talk a little and listen what a lot.
[time=2481] Parents who will lovingly say no to PG 13 or R rated movies absolutely packed with illicit promiscuous garbage.
[time=2496] You understand a PG 13 movie right ten years ago it was rated what are it's just soft it's just soft are and it's garbage and I'm I may not be making a lot of friends this morning.
[time=2510] We may have some 14 15 16 year olds going come on pastor you're killing me.
[time=2515] No no no he's killing you and you know what I'm not down on students.
[time=2522] You know me you know I love kids I love students I here's the thing I don't expect a 14 year old to be able to handle all of it.
[time=2531] He's not mentally or physically or spiritually capable at 14 to handle what you used to 20 years ago have to walk into a video store into a back room and rent.
[time=2544] But what are you cutting them loose on what are you you and I have got to be you and I have to continue to hone and refine think and reconsider pray and seek wisdom from God.
[time=2558] Radio stations that pump out nothing but sexual innuendo and new ideas to the young and impressionable.
[time=2568] They need help they need love they need guidance they need relationship and they need parameters and whether it's 12 to 18 or 20 to 30 or 40 to 50.
[time=2579] There are some who need help in the form of a reminder and there are some who need more than a reminder some you and I would understand in this dilemma need redemption.
[time=2594] Some don't know him for some their unregenerate choices simply reveal an unregenerate heart and we get the privilege of trying our best with his help to come alongside.
[time=2608] They need the forgiving saving redeeming life giving work of Christ and you know what the verbiage in our Proverbs passage reminds me of Paul.
[time=2619] The verbiage in our Proverbs passage deliver those who are being taken away hold them back those who are staggering.
[time=2628] Reminds me of what Paul said in 2 Corinthians 5 20 you can write that down you can turn there if you'd like.
[time=2636] I love the way he says it because it shows you his heart and it shows you how seriously he takes it.
[time=2641] 2 Corinthians 5 20 says therefore we are those in the family of God Christ followers we are ambassadors for Christ as though God were and he is making an appeal through us.
[time=2654] God didn't have to make an appeal through us God didn't have to use us God didn't have to bring us into this endeavor but he did.
[time=2661] God could have appealed just directly and we know that God does appeal directly but he also chooses to use you and I.
[time=2673] As though God were making an appeal through us and he is we Paul says we beg you.
[time=2679] He says to the folks that he's thinking about as we beg you oh please be reconciled to God.
[time=2692] On your behalf we beg you on behalf of Christ be reconciled to God be reconciled to God so many times the way it looks is this.
[time=2706] And I want to just sometimes visually it helps to just see it and I want to capture visually the essence of what we're saying here.
[time=2712] Corbin helped me out first hours he here Corbin are you here now Caleb coming up here real quick would you please bud.
[time=2718] Here's what I want you to see this Caleb come stand right here at the edge of this at the edge of this rug and I want you to face the edge of this rug.
[time=2725] See what happens is is that you have friends and I have friends we know people who are either Christ followers who are living in a pattern of disobedience.
[time=2732] And they're making all the wrong choices going all the wrong places doing all the wrong things and it's not good.
[time=2739] Or we've got somebody who hasn't come to faith in Christ yet.
[time=2743] Either way though they start to kind of slowly walk toward and I know at the end of this rug is a cliff.
[time=2751] And it's not a 12 footer all right it's a 200 footer and there's rocks at the bottom and they're done.
[time=2758] I mean done meaning I mean if this is a person far from God and they choose to walk over the cliff you and I know that means eternal separation from God it's called hell.
[time=2769] For a disobedient believer we know that if they get this far and choose this much then there's going to be all kinds of circumstances and all kinds of situations that God will allow to come in and that's not a good place to be.
[time=2781] Well what we oftentimes do I won't really speak for you I'll kind of just speak for me but I'm sure you can identify oftentimes they slowly begin to walk down this road.
[time=2791] And we kind of as they slowly walk we tend to kind of go you who and stop for a second Caleb and look at me and I'm saying hey you don't want to go there and you might want to consider a little bit of this but hope you caught that.
[time=2803] And he keeps walking and you're going oh my goodness he's still going and we kind of do the hey you know yeah you don't want to go there and they kind of keep walking and we say oh God please help him we don't want him to walk off the
[time=2816] and he walks off the edge of the cliff.
[time=2821] And he chose to it's true but see I want you to catch the verbiage I want you to catch the heart of the text go back over here and keep walking because that's what I've done too many times.
[time=2832] It was interesting last night we were talking about this at home we did kind of a Bible time right there in the living room which we often do and last night I thought you know what I'll read these verses to them and we'll talk about it and do what we often do we act it out.
[time=2847] So I told Russell to open up the fireplace it's kind of a sick analogy sorry.
[time=2854] I told him there was a fire going and I told him to open up the doors to the fireplace and I said Jake stand over here and I said now Jakey boy I want you to walk toward the fire.
[time=2864] And he's like oh alright so he starts walking toward the fire.
[time=2867] Now Russell T and Wesley and Maddie all had a chance to kind of act this out and I said now in light of the text in light of the verses that we read and those who are staggering to slaughter oh hold them back start walking.
[time=2883] And each of the three older kids when it was their time I'd say okay go and they would and all three of them just went whoa.
[time=2893] Right there.
[time=2896] You may you may get past me.
[time=2900] Me you may get over the edge of that cliff but you are not going to get over the edge of that cliff unless you go through me.
[time=2909] I kind of thought they would because it says stay there I kind of thought hold them back I kind of thought hey just walk back this way come on let's go you know I kind of thought that.
[time=2918] But it was interesting as Jake would walk each one of them just kind of ran and said whoa.
[time=2925] Because they love Jake.
[time=2927] I love him enough thanks Caleb and you love and you love him enough and I love him enough and we've got to be a people who are willing to go that far as the song said and you know what I am so grateful.
[time=2947] And I know I am so thankful that I get to be a part of a place like this part of a family like this with people who care that much because that that right there that's going on that that happens often.
[time=2962] I don't think that happens as often as it should and if that's encouragement or or reminder to you let it be that but I am so thankful that we get to be a part of that there was students and moms and dads and families and single adults
[time=2976] and senior adults and preschool through 12th grade with the poor with the rich with those in between with the red the yellow the black the brown and the white.
[time=2987] We get to be a part of the greatest endeavor of all. Oh he said oh hold them back.
[time=2995] Go stand in front and offer them the words of life offer them the words of truth.
[time=3001] Live out in front of them your faith in a way that is consistent with what you're inviting them toward and we will see them stagger no more.
[time=3012] We will see them freed from the impulses of evil we will get to see them washed and cleansed and made new.
[time=3021] And you know what I tell you a couple months ago and we want to show it to you this morning a couple months ago we had the privilege of watching 55 of our family.
[time=3035] Our family now because they've come to know Christ we get to watch 55 folks at the lake just a couple months ago come and stand before you and say I have fully surrendered my heart and life to Christ.
[time=3048] We get the privilege of seeing young and old and those in between be baptized a profession of their faith a faith that came when they surrendered their heart and life and in the process were set free captives no more.
[time=3064] And it is the most amazing picture to date in the years that God has given me of ministry this is the most amazing picture to me.
[time=3074] And I never weary of seeing it and as you watch it this morning I pray that your heart will be encouraged you may be a Christ follower here today.
[time=3083] And you may remember the day that you came to faith and rejoice all over again you may still be searching here today.
[time=3090] And as you watch you may be inclined to take another step forward toward trust and faith and redemption.
[time=3098] Watch it be encouraged and be reminded of what a wonderful awesome great God we serve he is the one who gives life and freedom.
[time=3109] I'll be back in just a moment.
[time=3120] Four years ago I hit rock bottom of my life my selfishness and my pride just got in the way.
[time=3133] And I believe truly that God hated me and I believe that for so many years.
[time=3149] I never thought I was working off for Jesus to be saving.
[time=3154] I now look to Christ for significance, contentment, security and control.
[time=3160] Your burdens lifted and carried far away and precious blood is washed away this day.
[time=3171] So sing to Jesus sing to Jesus.
[time=3177] Just in the last year I realized that I can't live what God under in life and not be a voice rendered.
[time=3184] I'm going to publicly ask His forgiveness for ignoring Him for 27 years.
[time=3190] I wanted to fully surrender myself because I was so appreciative of what He had done for me.
[time=3214] God kept on asking me when are you going to turn back to me?
[time=3221] Sometimes the way is lonely and steep and filled with pain.
[time=3228] So if your sky is dark and pause the rain then cry to Jesus.
[time=3243] Here's my life, here's my marriage, here's my kids, here's my family.
[time=3251] Take it all.
[time=3252] And that's been part of the journey for me.
[time=3254] It's just to lay down my life and give God the shame and the sin and the pain.
[time=3260] And just watch Him turn into something really beautiful for His Kingdom.
[time=3264] Oh when the love spills over and music fails tonight.
[time=3272] And when you can't contain your joy inside, then dance for Jesus.
[time=3281] Dance for Jesus, dance for Jesus.
[time=3286] I literally could not be standing here if it wasn't for Christ.
[time=3290] I can't express what it means to me to tell you that Jesus Christ is my Savior.
[time=3320] And it's a privilege as your pastor and friend.
[time=3336] To baptize you, the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[time=3349] I love you Jesus.
[time=3351] [AMEN] It's nothing better.
[time=3354] [AMEN] And let me have you stand if you would.
[time=3357] And as you stand, I want to invite a special, special friend.
[time=3360] It's an understatement.
[time=3362] Someone who I love a great deal and I'm so thankful for.
[time=3364] I want to introduce you to, and why don't you just give a real warm Blackhawk welcome to my mother.
[time=3369] My mom, Gail Bird is here.
[time=3377] Hello there.
[time=3379] We'll see you.
[time=3382] Here she is.
[time=3385] Twelve pounds, ten ounces, right there.
[time=3388] Unbelievable.
[time=3391] She is heroic.
[time=3393] We are so thankful that I know we are a Blackhawk, and you know I am so grateful for what we just saw.
[time=3399] [AMEN] We get to be a part of helping seekers find and then know what it means to follow Christ.
[time=3405] And we get to do that here in Fort Wayne and we get to do that all over the world as well.
[time=3410] And we're celebrating in our home the fact that my mom is heading, she's heading all over the world again.
[time=3417] She's done this before.
[time=3419] I think there were five, six years that she spent in Kazakhstan helping teach English in some very interesting, underdeveloped situations.
[time=3427] She is a brave woman and she loves doing what she does.
[time=3430] She came home for a while and she's been stateside for several years.
[time=3434] Personally, I think she's bored.
[time=3436] And she needs some excitement.
[time=3438] And so she's got it.
[time=3441] She is heading off to teach English.
[time=3443] Catch this.
[time=3444] In Kabul, Afghanistan.
[time=3447] And we are so thankful for the group of folks that she has met.
[time=3451] [APPLAUSE]
[time=3458] I thought maybe she could go to Jamaica or something.
[time=3462] But now she wants to go visit the Taliban.
[time=3465] So she's going to go to Kabul in the next month or so here and begin a process of teaching English.
[time=3470] In some very interesting situations, one of which may include the new Afghan government.
[time=3476] And so our prayers, the bird families, prayers are going to be with Grandma Gail.
[time=3480] And I would just love it if you would pray with me today and maybe commit to just keep her in your prayers
[time=3486] as she heads off to a new adventure at age 60.
[time=3490] What are you?
[time=3491] You don't know.
[time=3493] I don't either.
[time=3495] Sorry.
[time=3496] Let's pray and then we'll go.
[time=3499] God, thanks for a wonderful morning.
[time=3501] And we thank you so very much for the lives that continue to be touched by your word and your people and your spirit.
[time=3509] Thanks for the faces and the lives that we saw on the screen and thank you for this life right here.
[time=3513] Thank you for my mom and for her love for you and her desire to be used of you.
[time=3518] And we pray you'd give her strength and courage as she faces whatever she might face.
[time=3524] And God, go before her and prepare the hearts of those who she will befriend and reach out to.
[time=3531] Thank you for this family.
[time=3532] God, here at Blackhawk, give us strength and courage, God, to keep doing what we do and to do it well, God, as unto you.
[time=3540] In your son's name we pray.
[time=3542] All the people agreed and said, "Amen."
