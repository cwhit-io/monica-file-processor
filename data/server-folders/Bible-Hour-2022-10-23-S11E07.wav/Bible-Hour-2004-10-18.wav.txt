[time=208] - Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries and it is great to have you with us again.
[time=214] We're so thankful that you've tuned in.
[time=216] I wanna tell you this morning as we get going here that you're about to see a message that this past Sunday, Pastor Steve Longbreak and myself, I had the privilege of bringing to our family that was gathered together on that Sunday morning.
[time=231] I wanna tell you something about the message before you hear it.
[time=235] It's interesting for me as I find myself in situations where I'm talking to groups of people, be it here at Black Hawk or elsewhere.
[time=244] Whenever a message is confrontational in nature, whenever a message, whenever the passage that you might be studying kind of carries with it, the obvious implication that the listener might have some things to think about or consider.
[time=262] Oftentimes, we, I think in our human nature, have a kind of a reflex nature to begin to think about people in our lives who need to hear the message.
[time=272] Does that make sense?
[time=273] I can sometimes see people elbowing people who are sitting next to them, like, "Hey, are you listening, you need to hear this?" I sometimes, when I hear a message or when I'm studying and I come across a convicting truth, I'll think about who I know that needs to hear that.
[time=291] And oftentimes, I need to hear that.
[time=295] And I just wanna remind you today, I wanna just in a real nice way, invite you to listen to what is said today.
[time=303] As we talk about the nature and the characteristics of a fool, Proverbs has a lot to say about this.
[time=311] And as we describe for you what God's word says about the characteristics or nature of a fool, I just wanna invite you before you start applying this truth to other people.
[time=321] Make sure today that in the honesty and integrity of your heart, you listen and you allow the spirit of God and the word of God to penetrate your heart and do whatever work it might need to do.
[time=334] We're so thankful for you and we're so glad that you tune in each and every week.
[time=339] And I'm so hopeful that as we continue to do our best to teach God's word, especially with messages like this that you will allow God's word to change you and to grow you, you and I don't have to be fools.
[time=354] Sometimes I am and as we went through this message and as I studied for it, I just felt the spirit of God and the word of God convicting me again and again.
[time=363] And so I hope this morning you listen, I hope you'll allow it just to apply to you and thank you so very much for the privilege you give us and allowing us to bring this to you each and every week.
[time=374] Have a great week, God bless.
[time=377] - Do you do?
[time=378] - Well, I'm in a band and I travel all over the place and we play nothing too big, you know, a few state fairs here and there and a few other things like that, you know, something kind of small.
[time=389] - Hey, so cool!
[time=390] - Yeah, it's fun, I miss the guys.
[time=393] I play guitar, I play lead.
[time=395] - Good job.
[time=396] How does he really know, what do you do?
[time=398] - Why, I don't do anything now.
[time=400] - I mean, nothing.
[time=401] - Nothing?
[time=402] - No, no, not really.
[time=403] - How?
[time=405] How do you manage that?
[time=407] - My grandmother died two years ago and just left me a huge trust fund.
[time=413] - Oh, must be nice.
[time=414] - Yeah, and I think you don't have to do anything.
[time=416] - Do you need more friends?
[time=418] - No, so why don't, I don't do anything.
[time=420] No, I dropped out of school and I'm just, I want to get on the show because I really want to be on TV.
[time=425] - So you don't really need to win money?
[time=428] - No, not really.
[time=430] But I want to.
[time=431] - Yeah.
[time=433] - I think it's a fire going.
[time=433] - Here's your dinner, mate.
[time=435] - Wait, get back, get back.
[time=436] - Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.
[time=437] - Hey, what is that?
[time=439] - I don't know, I just found it in the fire.
[time=443] - Oh my gosh, okay, okay.
[time=445] Who's got the snacks and where they come from?
[time=447] - I'm serious, I found it, I found it here in the fire.
[time=451] - Where can I get mine?
[time=453] - Okay, well, where did it come?
[time=454] It was not there when we left.
[time=455] - Who was the first one over here?
[time=456] - It's not allowed.
[time=457] You were over here first.
[time=458] - Yeah, wait a minute.
[time=460] You left to bring some back.
[time=462] - That's right here.
[time=463] - That's right, that's right.
[time=464] - Six and I went back there.
[time=465] - Well, you guys, I didn't bring that.
[time=466] - You were the only one that was over here.
[time=468] - No, no, it wasn't me.
[time=469] - It was not there when we left.
[time=472] - There were all the bars FedExed in here or something.
[time=474] What's it even?
[time=475] - I don't know what a shared egg, come on.
[time=477] - I'm sharing it here.
[time=478] - Whatever.
[time=479] - Breathe on me.
[time=481] - It was her?
[time=482] - It was her, yes it was.
[time=484] - So, can you believe she had that granola bar?
[time=486] - I know, I mean, for Pete's sake, she's either she is just eating it right there, almost in front of us, practically, and we can smell it on her breath.
[time=493] I mean, we're all starving out here, it's not like everybody likes to eat rice in the world.
[time=496] - Rice.
[time=497] - Mmm.
[time=498] - Okay, it was my granola bar.
[time=501] Of course, I ate it.
[time=503] I'm starving out here, come on.
[time=505] All they've given us to eat is rice, it's just pathetic.
[time=508] I never knew it was gonna be like this, this horrible.
[time=511] And no, I wouldn't have shared, even if I had like 10 of them.
[time=514] I can't believe these, they could nive, they talk behind your back, it's just horrible.
[time=522] Appreciate it, another granola bar.
[time=525] (clock ticking) - Well, welcome to tribal council.
[time=551] - Hi, Jen. - Hi, Jen.
[time=552] Well, as you know tonight, we have a survivor first.
[time=554] Vicki just became ill, back at camp, she's resting.
[time=558] We've decided, and we've agreed among ourselves, and we're gonna give her a little break for this evening.
[time=561] We've got her vote recorded, and she'll hopefully be back with us tomorrow.
[time=565] Other than that, how are things going back at the new smaller tribe?
[time=569] - Well, pretty good, Jeff, but I'm struggling with hunger here.
[time=572] - You have me too.
[time=573] - You've all been out here for a while now, would you say that this experience has been easier or harder than you thought it would be?
[time=580] - No, I would say that it's been easier, actually, than I expected.
[time=585] - Barb, you're rolling your eyes, what's up?
[time=587] - Yeah, well, of course it's easier for some people when they smuggle food onto the island, and then they don't share it with anybody.
[time=592] - I did not do that.
[time=594] - You most definitely did.
[time=595] - Sorry, my friend, my friend.
[time=597] - Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, well.
[time=600] Looks like we've got a little discrepancy over who broke the rules here.
[time=603] - Well, there's not many of us who would be foolish enough to break the rules, Jeff.
[time=609] - Miranda, something you wanna add?
[time=612] - I did not bring food onto the island, and anybody that thinks I did is just an idiot, besides, whether I get voted off tonight or tomorrow, whenever.
[time=621] Jeff, I'm gonna have a limo meet me at the airport.
[time=626] - Very impressive. - Well, okay.
[time=628] Cecily, what are you gonna base your vote on tonight?
[time=631] - Well, Jeff, tonight, I'm voting for the fool who opens her mouth without thinking.
[time=636] - Tex, what about you?
[time=639] - I'm voting for the person who thought of their stomach before mine, after all.
[time=642] Mine is more important.
[time=644] - Okay.
[time=645] Well, with that said, let's get right to the voting.
[time=647] Miranda, you're up first.
[time=648] - Tonight, I am boat not Cecily.
[time=660] She thinks that the show is all about her, well, guess what it's not.
[time=664] It's all about me.
[time=669] Miranda, this vote is your own fault.
[time=674] It was foolish of you to talk about all your money, and bring a granola bar and not share it with everybody.
[time=680] Not a wise decision.
[time=681] - Miranda, ring a ding ding for all your money.
[time=692] Obviously, you don't need any more.
[time=699] - Breaking the rules and getting caught.
[time=703] - Miranda, you are busted.
[time=708] - I cannot believe that you would bring food on
[time=719] and not share it with us.
[time=721] I mean, we're hungry, too.
[time=723] I want a granola bar.
[time=730] I was talking it over with the producers over a game of Go Fish, and it appears that nobody owns this island currently.
[time=743] So through this special television offer, you can get it exclusively for five easy payments of 1.8 giga dollars.
[time=751] In the meantime, I'm gonna up the resale value a little by voting off Miranda.
[time=759] (audience laughing) Okay, when the votes are read, the decision is final.
[time=765] The person with the most votes will be asked to leave tribal council immediately.
[time=769] I'll now tally the votes.
[time=770] Miranda, two votes, Miranda, three votes, Miranda.
[time=789] And the second person voted off survivor Blackhawk is Miranda.
[time=794] Miranda, would you bring me your torch, please?
[time=799] The tribe has spoken.
[time=803] Oh, hey, Miranda, have a granola bar.
[time=807] (audience laughing) Well, we've got a very busy day tomorrow.
[time=814] Let's get back to camp and get some rest.
[time=817] (audience applauding) The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.
[time=830] Fools despise wisdom and instruction.
[time=832] Train up a child in the way he should go.
[time=834] Even when he is old, he will not depart from it.
[time=837] If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat.
[time=839] And if he is thirsty, give him water to drink.
[time=842] Trust in the Lord with all your heart and do not lean on your own understanding.
[time=846] Take my instruction and not silver and knowledge rather than choice as gold.
[time=851] A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.
[time=856] (upbeat music)
[time=876] (upbeat music) - Well, it's great to be able to be here again today
[time=889] and to be continuing in our ongoing study that we've entitled "Navigating Through the Storms of Life." Every one of you in this room knows that the everyday of life brings situations to you and I that we have to deal with.
[time=905] Situations and circumstance where we're called upon to choose, to make decisions.
[time=910] It comes every single day.
[time=913] You and I having to make wise choices in order to move and navigate through life in a way that would honor God.
[time=922] And we have looked to in this study, we have looked to the Book of Proverbs, this amazing collection of wise sayings, this incredible book found in the Old Testament.
[time=932] And so far in our study have talked about and looked to the scriptures as it relates to the way we handle our friends, the way we handle our families, the way we handle finances.
[time=945] Last week we looked at how it is we handle or live out our faith.
[time=948] And this morning, Steve Longbreak has joined me here on stage.
[time=952] Steve is one of our teaching pastors and together we are going to today deal with this issue of how to handle a fool.
[time=960] How to handle, what does God's word say about handling a fool?
[time=963] How to handle a fool and not become one?
[time=969] There are some things that we shouldn't do with fools and we're going to tell you about one of those things.
[time=975] And then there is a description of a fool that God's word gives us and we're going to give you three of those today.
[time=982] But first of all, for the sake of our study and discussion this morning, let's just establish if we can a working definition.
[time=989] If you've got your pens, you may want to write this down.
[time=991] A working definition of what it means biblically when we hear the phrase fool used, what does that mean?
[time=998] Well, here we go.
[time=999] A fool is one who pursues a course contrary to the dictates of wisdom.
[time=1006] It's an individual who chooses who decides to go down a certain road to choose a certain course in life contrary to the dictates of wisdom.
[time=1017] Whereas wisdom found right here in the word of God.
[time=1021] It's somebody who chooses to go the other way.
[time=1024] One who, now, and what's usually behind that choice is this, one who chooses his or her own inclinations and desires.
[time=1033] It's very important that you see that.
[time=1035] It is a foolish person who looks at this and says, "No thanks, I will choose my own feelings, "my own inclinations, my own leanings, "my own desires." See what I feel and what I sense gets lifted up above that, which is true and right.
[time=1056] And when you do that, when I do that,
[time=1062] God's word says I am being a fool.
[time=1066] A foolish person is one who chooses his or her own inclinations and desires over truth and sound judgment.
[time=1076] Fools see themselves as the ultimate final authority.
[time=1081] Fools disregard this.
[time=1084] They disregard what is true.
[time=1088] Steve, as you read through that definition, what do you see there?
[time=1091] And then take us on into our first point of the morning.
[time=1095] - One of the things I noted when I saw that definition was that it's not hard to do that.
[time=1102] It just comes naturally.
[time=1107] It's my fallen condition that causes me to be a fool.
[time=1112] And for years I've been teaching in government class,
[time=1118] helping people understand that our nature
[time=1125] is not something we ever have to work at.
[time=1128] What we need to work at is renewing our minds so that we won't do what comes naturally.
[time=1137] I'm a fool, I'm foolish when I choose a path or an action that's contrary to God's revelation.
[time=1146] God has revealed himself to us in two basic ways.
[time=1152] And for a lot of years in England and the United States,
[time=1159] law schools began with this discussion.
[time=1165] God has revealed himself to us in his word, his revealed law through the prophets, through the apostles, through Jesus himself.
[time=1180] God has provided for us information that we needed to be other than what comes naturally in that way.
[time=1187] And he's also revealed himself to us in nature.
[time=1191] Remember, Romans 1 says men are without excuse because God has revealed in his own creation the reality that he exists, and everybody should see that and then seek after him.
[time=1201] Men are without excuse.
[time=1203] Well, just look at one of the ways that he's revealed himself to us in nature, and I've used this one for years.
[time=1211] We don't ever come up to a cliff and jump off expecting gravity to not take its natural course.
[time=1222] We don't ever pass laws that mandate that men and women have to fly for the rest of their lives.
[time=1228] Not allowed to walk.
[time=1229] Because we know in his natural revelation
[time=1235] that there are natural consequences to foolish choices that are contrary to what he's revealed to us in nature over and over again.
[time=1244] He's done the same thing with his word.
[time=1250] He's revealed to us words that can help us understand bad choices that we would make.
[time=1258] That would be contrary to his wisdom.
[time=1261] And yet we do that all the time.
[time=1264] How foolish.
[time=1266] First of all, I want to say that we're starting by saying
[time=1272] that we don't want you to waste the truth on fools.
[time=1277] Now, we're not saying never share the truth with anybody.
[time=1281] Obviously, there are people that you're going to share truth with and they've been ignoring the supernatural revelation of God and they need to hear the truth.
[time=1293] Unbelievers that need to hear the truth.
[time=1295] There are believers in your life that are foolishly acting out their own wishes rather than adhering to the word of God and what he's revealed to them.
[time=1306] And it's not that you never share the truth with them, but there comes a time the Proverbs say.
[time=1311] When we are investing too much time and it's time for us to draw a line and say, we're finished with that.
[time=1319] We'll move on to those who have ears to hear.
[time=1322] It's a hard thing, you guys.
[time=1324] This is a hard teaching, but it's true.
[time=1327] Look at Proverbs, chapter 23, verse nine.
[time=1335] The N.I.B. says, "Do not speak to a fool, for he will scorn the wisdom of your words." This word for fool is a fool is, we translate three different words, fool in Proverbs.
[time=1347] This one means doll, closed-minded, thick-headed and stubborn.
[time=1352] That was my mom and dad for years,
[time=1360] I don't know what the deal is there.
[time=1362] (congregation laughing) It's me now, I see it in me all the time.
[time=1367] Doll, closed-minded, thick-headed and stubborn.
[time=1372] And it says, that kind of person, don't waste your words on them.
[time=1377] If they continue to reveal to you that that's who they are, after you have invested in them, this is the key, invest in unbelievers and believers.
[time=1390] Invest so much that you grow to love them where your treasure is, there will your heart follow also.
[time=1397] Invest so much treasure, your time, whatever it is, that you love them, that you don't ever want to stop.
[time=1403] But then be willing to, that's what this is about.
[time=1408] Be willing to, because they have revealed that they are stubborn, they're thick-headed, they don't deserve to hear any longer from you.
[time=1417] Somebody else might move into their life.
[time=1421] Secondly, Proverbs 24-7 says, wisdom is too high for a fool in the assembly at the gate, he has nothing to say.
[time=1430] Wisdom is too high for a fool.
[time=1431] That fool is the person who is arrogant, hardened, flippant, as well as stubborn, doll, closed-minded and thick-headed.
[time=1442] It's really hard to discern when those people are those people.
[time=1447] You got to trust on the Holy Spirit of God to help you.
[time=1450] But I want to tell you this again.
[time=1452] Invest in people, invest in them, and don't be wanting to get rid of them.
[time=1460] Be willing to stop wasting truth on them.
[time=1465] Like some married couples, some relatives who are unbelievers, some friends who are in sin, you need to be willing to do that.
[time=1474] Well, just quickly, the Bible says that we need to confront people specifically and specifically, so we need to know Matthew 18 really well.
[time=1484] We need to know about not judging Matthew chapter seven.
[time=1486] We need to know 1 Corinthians chapter five very well in order to know when to stop this stuff and how to go through the process of doing it.
[time=1493] We need to know Galatians six, so that we do it in love, not the way it's natural for me to do it.
[time=1499] And if you want to, early in the process, invest some more so that you don't want to, then be willing to.
[time=1507] - Steve mentioned something first hour, I just think, I think it bears repeating.
[time=1511] He mentioned how this kind of truth, I mean, this teaching right here that you're hearing, it really does have, I think, strong implication on the way we do pastoral care, the way we do pastoral counseling.
[time=1525] And he said it well, why don't you just say it again, the things we've learned about that over the years?
[time=1531] - Yeah, one of the things that I've noticed over the years, especially when it comes to marital counseling is that there aren't many people that come in that really want to hear how to change.
[time=1541] They just want you to listen long enough that they can go home and tell mom that they did the counseling thing.
[time=1547] And a guy told me a long time ago, he said continue counseling with people who do what you've asked them to do in the previous session.
[time=1558] Because if they don't have ears to hear, you're wasting your time and you need to spend your time with the people that have ears to hear.
[time=1567] I'll tell you the truth, I've watched it.
[time=1569] Our senior pastors, I have watched them die trying to help all the people that have needs in our church over the years.
[time=1577] And you know what, guess what?
[time=1578] The numbers are going up and the circumstances are getting more difficult all the time.
[time=1584] You need to pray for Kelly and Bob Purdy and the other guys, everybody that's doing that.
[time=1588] But we need to be willing to stop it.
[time=1594] That's one thing that we're not to do.
[time=1597] We're not to waste truth on a foolish person.
[time=1600] Here are three things that would just paint a picture.
[time=1604] A biblical portrait, if you will, of what a fool looks like, okay?
[time=1607] Here you go, three things.
[time=1609] Number one, the Bible says the fool is quick to anger.
[time=1613] Fools, my friends, are, according to the scriptures, quick to become angry.
[time=1620] Look at Proverbs 14, 29.
[time=1623] Proverbs 14, 29 says, "He who is slow to anger has great understanding." Now, see, there's a wise individual.
[time=1631] He who is slow to anger has great understanding, but he who is quick-tempered, he who gets mad really fast, exalts folly, promotes folly, exemplifies folly, holds up that which is wrong.
[time=1651] Ecclesiastes 7-9, you can write that down.
[time=1654] It'll come on the screen as well.
[time=1656] Ecclesiastes 7-9 gives you and I a great warning.
[time=1659] Do not be eager.
[time=1661] Do not be quick.
[time=1663] Do not be eager in your heart to be angry for anger resides in the bosom of fools.
[time=1672] Hey, plainly stated, folks, fools have a short fuse.
[time=1680] You're a fool and I'm a fool if I'm known to or am struggling with a short fuse.
[time=1688] And you know what quick-tempered,
[time=1695] quickly-engered people do?
[time=1698] Do you know what it is they produce?
[time=1701] Most of you do.
[time=1703] You know what it is?
[time=1705] Been an individual who is quick to become angry.
[time=1707] You know what comes from that?
[time=1709] Do you know what that produces?
[time=1712] It produces again and again and again destruction.
[time=1717] Destruction of hearts, destruction of souls, destruction of relationships, the destruction of family.
[time=1726] It destroys the spirit.
[time=1728] Not only of those who receive it, but in time of those who deliver it.
[time=1735] And there are many in the room this morning and you have lived with that.
[time=1740] You have been on the receiving end of angry words, maybe most of your life.
[time=1747] And the condition of your heart and soul this morning bears evidence to what transpires when angry words are spewed, spoken and delivered.
[time=1762] You know this week I just did a study.
[time=1765] I just began to make my way through the scriptures.
[time=1767] I just began to look at different individuals recorded for us in the scriptures who were angry, who responded in anger, who were quick to anger.
[time=1779] And as you begin to read about these individuals and as you begin to see what it was, they produced.
[time=1784] It's absolutely eye-opening, absolutely heartbreaking.
[time=1789] I mean, you can go anywhere you want.
[time=1790] You can go to Matthew 2, you can write that down.
[time=1792] Matthew 2, 16.
[time=1794] You can go to Matthew 2, 16 and see Herod who was King when Jesus was born.
[time=1799] And Herod had a deal he cut with the magi, with the wise men, they were supposed to come back to him and tell him what they had seen.
[time=1807] Well, when they saw what they had seen, they didn't go back to him.
[time=1810] And it says there in Matthew 2 that he was angry, says that he was enraged and immediately quick-tempered.
[time=1817] Immediately, the edict is delivered to have all the male babies, all male babies under the age of two slaughtered.
[time=1827] See, that's what comes with a quick temper.
[time=1831] That's what comes with anger unleashed.
[time=1834] Destruction, you can go back to the beginning.
[time=1836] You can write down Genesis.
[time=1838] And in fact, I want you to read this with me.
[time=1840] Write down Genesis 4.
[time=1842] Go back to the beginning, the very first book of the Bible, Genesis chapter 4, one of our first experiences, as far as the scriptures go, with an angry heart.
[time=1853] Genesis 4, look at verse 5.
[time=1857] It says in Genesis 4, actually if you go up to verse 4,
[time=1866] Abel, this is Cain and Abel, sons of Adam and Eve.
[time=1871] Abel on his part also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of their fat portions.
[time=1878] And the Lord had regard for Abel and his offering.
[time=1882] But for Cain and for his offering, he had God had no regard.
[time=1888] So Cain, Cain became very what?
[time=1892] So Cain became very angry and his countenance fell.
[time=1897] Then the Lord said to Cain, why are you angry?
[time=1900] And why has your countenance fallen?
[time=1903] If you do well, will not your countenance be lifted up?
[time=1907] And if you do not do well, sin, there you go, it's always there connected to the anger.
[time=1913] Sin is crouching at the door and its desire is for you, but you must master it.
[time=1921] He said to Cain and he says to you and he says to me this morning, you have got to with God's help, master your anger.
[time=1933] Sin crouches at the door and it wants you.
[time=1938] And through your anger released, it's gonna get you and others.
[time=1943] Cain told Abel his brother and it came about when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and killed him.
[time=1954] Anger unleashed.
[time=1957] Uzziah, second chronicles 26, you can write it down.
[time=1963] Second chronicles 26, Uzziah got proud and haughty in spirit, walked into the temple, into the inner part of the temple to make incense sacrifice.
[time=1974] He wasn't supposed to go in the temple, that far in the temple.
[time=1978] That was only for the consecrated priests, the sons of Aaron, and so they came to Uzziah and said, Uzziah, get out of there, you're not supposed to be in there.
[time=1986] And it made him mad, see, he was so high and mighty, he didn't want folks telling him what to do.
[time=1991] So he got enraged, it says there, and second chronicles 26.
[time=1996] And the moment that he got enraged and fired back at them, God strikes him with leprosy.
[time=2002] And he dies a lonely, painful death.
[time=2006] And go to Nebuchadnezzar and Daniel three, write that down.
[time=2010] Daniel three, Nebuchadnezzar.
[time=2012] Nebuchadnezzar, so full of himself, he demands that these three young boys, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, would bow when they hear the music, bow to the idol, bow to the statue of Nebuchadnezzar, they won't bow, and he is angry.
[time=2026] And in his anger and in his rage, orders them to be thrown into the furnace and killed.
[time=2031] See everywhere you look, everywhere you go, here in the Bible, and in your life and mine as well, anger is followed by destruction, anger is followed by evil, sin is crouching at the door, and it's not what God has for you and I, it's not what God has called you to.
[time=2052] Look at James, go back to the back of your New Testament, go back to James chapter one.
[time=2057] Let's just be reminded again this morning of what it is God has called you and I to, as it relates to how quickly or slowly we would become angry.
[time=2067] Look at James chapter one verse 19, James chapter one verses 19 and 20, it says this you know, this you know my beloved brethren, but everyone must be quick to hear, you're gonna be quick, be quick to listen.
[time=2087] Everyone it says must be quick to hear, slow to speak and slow to anger for the anger of man does not achieve, does not produce, it does not bring about the righteousness of God.
[time=2102] God is an honored, God isn't lifted up, truth isn't exalted when you and I choose and respond with anger.
[time=2113] Now I'm gonna tell you three things here, okay?
[time=2115] We wanna be very practical.
[time=2116] How do you move through this?
[time=2117] How would you hear?
[time=2118] Like me see, I sometimes I struggle with this.
[time=2122] So how would you and I practically speaking kind of become people who would by and large not be characterized by being quick to anger?
[time=2131] Number one, I would invite you today to memorize, to hide this truth in your heart.
[time=2139] I'd write it down right now, James 1, 19 to 20.
[time=2143] And I am encouraging you today to memorize those two verses, to put it on a card, to put it in your car, to put it in your purse, to take it with you on your laptop, to do whatever you would have to do to every single day have that truth right in front of your eyes, because the truth people of God's word and the power of God's word is such that when you really hide it in your heart and when you really say it prayerfully and genuinely, again and again and again, it does something to you.
[time=2176] I would encourage you to hide that truth in your heart.
[time=2178] Secondly, now it gets real interesting.
[time=2180] It gets very humbling sometimes when you and I are pursuing repentance.
[time=2185] I would invite you to talk to one or two or three very good friends who you trust and who you know love you.
[time=2191] You know they love you and you trust them and you would be willing to say to them, you know what I have a problem with this?
[time=2200] I'm too angry and it comes out too much and it comes out too quick and I'm destroying people in my life and I don't want to do that.
[time=2210] Would you pray for me?
[time=2211] Would you pray for me in the morning?
[time=2212] Would you pray for me at noon?
[time=2215] Would you pray for me all week, maybe all month?
[time=2218] In fact, I'll just tell you when to stop.
[time=2220] Would you pray for me all the time?
[time=2223] I would invite you to do that.
[time=2227] I've done that.
[time=2228] It's a very humbling thing but so very important to hide it in your heart and to have those who would be really willing to genuinely lift you up specifically as it relates to that issue.
[time=2240] Thirdly, here you go and see this would be thirdly, this would be contrary to what you might read in a book.
[time=2246] It may be contrary to what you might hear in an office somewhere because some folks want to tell you that the best way to deal with your anger is to do a thing they call venting.
[time=2256] Ever heard of that?
[time=2257] Some would tell you to get a bat and go beat the tar out of a pillow somewhere and yell at it and scream at it and then go absolutely stark raving mad.
[time=2266] Just beat the heck out of a mattress or a pillow.
[time=2270] Watch it, that was really close right there.
[time=2272] Should I calm down?
[time=2277] Yeah.
[time=2278] Man, sorry.
[time=2285] (audience laughing) And when he's that person, I feel like my dad, it's like this old, old wife's age, just spoke and you go, oh my gosh.
[time=2293] You know, my experience has been with people who practice venting, they get really good at what?
[time=2301] Venting, it's bogus people, it's bunk, it's garbage.
[time=2306] You don't need to practice venting, you need to practice self-control and my third practical little step for you would be this.
[time=2316] And this is not, I mean, here how I say this, if you're in the midst of it and you feel it welling up, I would like to invite you today to walk away, to walk to the other side of the room, to walk out to the garage, to go outside and take a walk, to remember this verse on that walk, to call that friend on your cell phone real quick who's praying for you, right?
[time=2341] But to in the midst of that, don't open your mouth, leave, don't leave, don't leave her for good, I'm not saying that, and don't leave them hanging, no, I'm just talking about for the moment, get a grip, walk away, don't open your mouth
[time=2362] and let that evil spew out.
[time=2364] Thirdly, there's other marks
[time=2371] of a foolish person.
[time=2372] - Yeah, this one's named right at me.
[time=2375] I will say, you know what he just said, all that stuff, it's Proverbs 29.11, he didn't make it up.
[time=2380] - Yep.
[time=2381] - It's Proverbs 29.11, a fool gives full vent to his anger, a wise man holds it back.
[time=2389] - Yeah. - Yeah.
[time=2391] - N-A-S, 29.11 Proverbs.
[time=2394] Well now, I know why he gave me this one.
[time=2397] Kelly, he assigned this point and he never once said anything to me about it being for me, but it's for me.
[time=2404] How to handle a fool and not become one.
[time=2411] Well, first of all, what we need to know is they talk too much, they talk too much.
[time=2416] Proverbs 10, 8, 10, and 14.
[time=2422] Let's look at those together.
[time=2424] Proverbs chapter 10 says, the wise in heart accept commands, but a chattering fool in IV, babbler N-A-S comes to ruin.
[time=2437] That person I talked about a little bit earlier,
[time=2446] the doll closed-minded, thick-headed, stubborn, arrogant, hardened, flippant person, that fool, you can spot them because they often chatter and babble.
[time=2456] Needless talk fills their life, the Bible says.
[time=2462] The next proverb, 10, 10.
[time=2466] He who winks maliciously causes grief and a chattering fool, or babbler again, comes to ruin, ruin again.
[time=2478] 14, wise men store up knowledge, but the mouth of a fool, and that's the same word, babbler, chatterer, invites ruin.
[time=2490] Notice that in all three of those cases, it's the chatterer, the babbler, and the consequence is ruin.
[time=2498] Not just for them, people all around them.
[time=2509] I've been around folks that talk because they're nervous.
[time=2514] That's probably not what we're talking about here, although even if you're a nervous talker, you need to think about that.
[time=2522] We're talking about the person here that they have their own opinions, they have their own philosophy, they've learned it from all kinds of sources, and they chatter, and they babble, and they espouse their own thing, and they talk to people, this is interesting, they're closed-minded about being open-minded.
[time=2539] They'll tell you all the time
[time=2545] that you need to be more open-minded, you need to be more tolerant, and they're the least tolerant people of us.
[time=2553] We people who believe in an absolute revelation from God about what's right and wrong, and they'll chatter and babble about that stuff forever.
[time=2563] There are consequences to that.
[time=2566] Ecclesiastes 10 says, let's look at that.
[time=2569] Words from a wise man's mouth are gracious, but a fool is consumed by his own lips.
[time=2575] Notice the difference there, words and lips.
[time=2578] Let's go on, verse 13.
[time=2580] At the beginning of his words are folly.
[time=2583] At the end, they are wicked madness, verse 14.
[time=2587] And the fool multiplies words.
[time=2592] One of the things I learned there is, the wise man has words to say that have meaning.
[time=2599] The fool has lips that move, and sounds that come out.
[time=2609] You guys, I'm always the first one in the group that wants to answer the question.
[time=2616] I sit in staff meetings sometimes, and I think I'm waiting a long time.
[time=2622] And nobody's answering yet, and they're all kind of being patient, and I can't stand it anymore, and I've got to just, and then I have to do it again in the middle and again at the end.
[time=2631] They all know it.
[time=2632] That's why he gave me this one right here.
[time=2634] (congregation laughing) It's not true.
[time=2637] It's sort of true.
[time=2640] (congregation laughing) Guys, when you open the door, you got to get ready for whatever's gonna come in.
[time=2645] You know what I mean?
[time=2647] It is true.
[time=2648] I know it's true.
[time=2649] It was true.
[time=2650] My mom told me from the, my mom kept saying, and she still says this today, "Steve, don't be you all the time." (congregation laughing) That's what this is about.
[time=2665] This is about me becoming the man whose name is written on a rock that only God knows when I get renewed in this.
[time=2675] I won't be a chatterer and a babbler.
[time=2678] When I speak what he has been teaching me.
[time=2681] Look at Proverbs 29-20.
[time=2685] Do you see a man who speaks in haste?
[time=2691] That's me.
[time=2691] There is more hope for a fool than for him.
[time=2695] Don't be a hasty speaker.
[time=2698] One way not to talk too much.
[time=2706] Listen to others first.
[time=2709] Greatest management principle I was ever taught in my life.
[time=2711] A guy taught me in Columbus when I was 25 years old.
[time=2714] He said, "Everybody that reports to you, "get with them as often as you can, "alone and listen to them the first half "of the conversation." I have done that.
[time=2727] There you go.
[time=2728] (congregation laughing) Listen to others.
[time=2734] Secondly, listen to the words you're going to say before you say them.
[time=2740] One way not to talk too much, be quiet.
[time=2747] Sometimes I find with people who talk a lot
[time=2756] me being one of them, I talk a lot.
[time=2764] And I don't mean here.
[time=2765] And people who know me know that they'll kid with me about it and we'll joke about it.
[time=2772] But it's actually been something I felt convicted about in the last several months in this season of my life that I'm in.
[time=2782] You should see my cell phone bill.
[time=2785] And part of that's me trying to be a good leader or a good pastor.
[time=2790] But I'll tell you what part of it is this.
[time=2792] And if this fits where, if not, then I guess it's just me, but some people who talk a lot, they find meaning and they find belonging and they find significance in talking.
[time=2808] When real meaning and real belonging and real significance
[time=2814] is to be found primarily in who?
[time=2816] Him.
[time=2820] And so I've been trying in my own life.
[time=2823] I've done a little thing with my phone and my car.
[time=2827] It used to turn on automatically when I turned the ignition on.
[time=2830] And off I'd go, just babble in a way.
[time=2833] How many phones have you been through since you've been here today?
[time=2835] A few.
[time=2836] But now I've got it so it doesn't turn on automatically.
[time=2840] And I'll be driving down the road and realize it's not lit up and go, oh my goodness, I got, oh wait.
[time=2849] Why don't I just take these 15 minutes and just be quiet and listen?
[time=2855] Which is hard for me, but I'm getting better at it.
[time=2861] Why don't I just listen to something that's gonna focus me and remind me and encourage, why don't I just shut up and listen?
[time=2870] See, 'cause we live in a world absolutely inundated with noise.
[time=2875] Noise is all over you, it's all around me.
[time=2879] And I believe he's calling some of us to be quiet more often and listen more intently.
[time=2886] Last one and we'll close.
[time=2889] Listen, don't miss this.
[time=2890] Fools hate instruction.
[time=2894] If you're a fool, if you're characterized, as you look at your life, as you're realizing more and more so that you're marked by these foolish characteristics, this will be one that you would be able to readily identify.
[time=2909] If you're struggling with foolishness in this season of your life, this would be something that you could see.
[time=2916] Proverbs 15, five says that fools despise the discipline and instruction of their fathers.
[time=2922] Proverbs 1, seven, the theme verse of our entire study.
[time=2926] Proverbs 1, seven, you remember what it says?
[time=2929] It says the beginning of, remember the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.
[time=2933] Fools despise wisdom and instruction.
[time=2936] There isn't a stronger word for hate in all of the Hebrew language than this word used for despise.
[time=2943] Fools despise being instructed.
[time=2948] They hate being taught.
[time=2951] Why?
[time=2954] Why is that?
[time=2956] Why do some people hate instruction so much?
[time=2961] Why are some fools so postured against listening and learning?
[time=2966] Well, you know why?
[time=2967] 'Cause fools are so very prideful.
[time=2972] You see, for the fool, life is just about him or her.
[time=2976] It is all about him or her.
[time=2979] You see, a fool is so very lazy and so very selfish and so extremely prideful.
[time=2989] And if they expose themselves really to instruction or sound teaching or wisdom, it puts them in a very untenable position because they, number one, they begin to feel the expectation of others and/or of God to move in a better direction and they don't wanna do that because that's gonna require work.
[time=3009] And that's gonna require discipline and self-control and they hate that stuff because they just wanna be happy
[time=3018] and do their own thing.
[time=3020] They also feel, in the midst of instruction, they'll also feel conviction, which they hate as well because they wanna feel good about themselves and their own agenda and their own desires and their own longings and their own plans and their own evils.
[time=3035] And I would invite you this morning.
[time=3040] Would you write this down?
[time=3041] I do this every once in a while.
[time=3043] I don't know what you do with it but I certainly hope you would be faithful to do this.
[time=3048] Would you write down Proverbs chapter four, verses one to eight?
[time=3052] Here I am, I'm giving you an assignment.
[time=3055] Steve said, give 'em an assignment and if they do it, great, if they don't move on.
[time=3059] So I'm giving you an assignment and I'm asking you to read Proverbs chapter four verses one to eight.
[time=3066] Read it to yourself, read it to your spouse, read it to your kids.
[time=3070] Sometime today before the sun goes down, why don't you just look and see in those eight verses, Proverbs four, one to eight, how very, very important it is to be somebody who would long for and go toward instruction, not move away from it.
[time=3089] Somebody's been asking you to be in a small group for months and you keep saying no.
[time=3094] Somebody wants to be in an accountability relationship with you and you keep saying no.
[time=3098] Somebody keeps inviting you to come to church on a regular basis to hear the instruction from God and you just keep saying no.
[time=3107] I would invite all of you to read Proverbs four verses one to eight and there you'll see a picture of what it looks like to really hunger after and be given to instruction and the wisdom and the life that comes with it.
[time=3121] You can't do this.
[time=3123] You hear me?
[time=3123] You can't do it.
[time=3126] You cannot avoid being a fool.
[time=3130] You cannot stop appropriate relationship.
[time=3134] You can't appropriately stop relationship, I should say, with a fool.
[time=3139] You can't do this.
[time=3140] Only he can do this in you.
[time=3145] If we start thinking that we can make a list of how to avoid being the foolish talker, the foolish angry person, the foolish person who doesn't want instruction, the foolish person who continues to go on with relationships that they shouldn't continue.
[time=3161] If we think we can just make a list and start being disciplined and we just won't do it, we'll have success for a little bit, like you have in a lot of things in your life.
[time=3169] But the reality is mysteriously, incredibly, God empowers us to do all of that by his spirit.
[time=3179] I mean, do you get that?
[time=3182] We can be the person opposite everything we talked about there today, by his power.
[time=3188] If you don't know him as your savior, if you haven't come into relationship with God and gotten on your knees and surrendered your life to him and said, I need a savior, please forgive me, come into my life.
[time=3199] If you haven't done that, forget it.
[time=3201] You can't do any of this unless it's by his spirit.
[time=3204] If you do know him, but you're still trying to do it your way, forget it.
[time=3211] Yielding to him, renewing your mind with his words
[time=3218] and his ways, because you really believe in your heart that his ways aren't your ways, his thoughts aren't your thoughts, you can only get them from him, if you really believe that, then you're on the road to a spirit-led life where self-control is exercised by him in you.
[time=3242] Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.
[time=3251] It's his fruit, not yours.
[time=3252] You yield to him and he bears a yield in you.
[time=3259] Let's pray, you want to pray?
[time=3263] - Yeah, hey, you know what?
[time=3264] In fact, would you all just stand?
[time=3266] Hey, Corbin, could you come up here?
[time=3268] I'm kind of putting him on the spot.
[time=3270] He wasn't planning on this.
[time=3271] I don't know, do we have enough musicians to do sing to the Lord again?
[time=3273] What's that?
[time=3276] Maybe?
[time=3279] If you're here and you're a musician, come on up.
[time=3281] I just want us to sing this song as we go.
[time=3285] We were singing it earlier, and you know what?
[time=3286] I just thought, you know what?
[time=3287] We should sing this song a little louder, and we should sing this song a little better, and we should sing this song before we leave today with a little bit more heart.
[time=3294] Please don't leave.
[time=3296] We have so much to be thankful for, and the words of this song so captured, I know my gratitude today for him, and it is by his grace and through his power that we even have a chance to give ourselves to this kind of living.
[time=3308] So I'm just gonna ask if the folks who ever can come up can come up, and Corbin, if you just lead us through maybe that song, that verse, and the chorus especially, and I wanna ask you, and we'll make it our prayer as we go.
[time=3320] Sing it.
[time=3321] Sing it from the bottom of your heart, and sing it with a heart of joy and gratitude today, because he is an amazing, amazing God who has given us his son, and in his son, not only the forgiveness of sin, but the strength to live wisely.
[time=3336] Amen, let's sing it to him this morning.
[time=3339] Go ahead, Mark, we'll hear you again.
[time=3344] Okay, good deal.
[time=3345] (upbeat music)
[time=3351] [MUSIC - 136 seconds]
[time=3491] [AMEN]
[time=3501] (audience applauding) Father God, we sing that song to you this morning.
[time=3507] And we look forward to that day when the redeemed will be with you.
[time=3511] Father God, until that day, give each of us that know you.
[time=3515] The strength, and courage, and wisdom God to live life not as fools, but as those given completely and humbly to you.
[time=3524] God, do whatever you might need to do.
[time=3526] Teach us whatever might need to be taught.
[time=3528] Bring people into our lives, God, that would help us move in the right direction.
[time=3533] And thank you so very much for your word this morning and the power that it has.
[time=3537] Change us, God, continue to grow us in your son's name we pray.
[time=3541] [AMEN]
[time=3563] (audience applauding)
