[time=330] [APPLAUSE]
[time=332] [MUSIC - 2 seconds] Well, hi again, everybody.
[time=338] Thank you for being here with us.
[time=340] We're so thankful for the opportunity to bring this broadcast to you each and every week.
[time=346] I'm so thankful as are the other guys and gals on our team for the emails and the notes that we receive from so many of you in the Bible our audience.
[time=357] You're encouraging words and your stories of life change consistently leave us so very thankful for what we get to be a part of in bringing this broadcast and this ministry to you each and every week.
[time=371] So thank you.
[time=372] Thank you for thinking enough of us to keep us in the loop, so to speak, on what God's doing in your life.
[time=379] I want to say this to you this morning about the message you're about to see.
[time=383] This is one of those messages that just doesn't really need a lot of introduction.
[time=388] I don't want to say a lot to you this morning.
[time=390] I just want to give you the chance to hopefully open your heart and open your mind and take in what God might have for you.
[time=396] But I will say this to you.
[time=398] God's word is really clear, people, to you and to me.
[time=403] It's really clear when it comes to issues such as telling the truth.
[time=410] When it comes to issues such as honoring God's design for the sexual-physical relationship.
[time=419] God's words really clear when it comes to issues of abuse, especially as it relates to addictions.
[time=427] And so this morning we find ourselves bringing a message to you that has to do with these three principles, sex, lies and addictions.
[time=439] And I pray and hope that whoever you are, wherever you've been, whatever you find yourself in the midst of, that you would today right now ask the Spirit of God to do a work in you.
[time=453] As you listen and as you wrestle with these truths, that you would ask the Spirit of God right now to do a work in you that would continue to change you and grow you and remind you and convict you and help you.
[time=467] In any of these arenas where you might need encouragement or reminders today.
[time=473] So listen, see what he might want to do and know how very grateful we are for the chance to do this with you.
[time=480] And listen, please, if you need help, if you need encouragement, if you need accountability, if you need some direction on any of these fronts, you know where we are.
[time=490] Shoot us an email, we'd love to help out. There are resources that God's made available to us and we would love to make them available to you as you continue on your journey.
[time=501] And boy, just know how thankful we are to get to walk down roads like this with you. God bless you. Have a great week.

[time=675] The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.
[time=681] Fools despise wisdom and instruction.
[time=683] Train up a child in the way he should go.
[time=685] Even when he is old, he will not depart from it.
[time=688] If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat.
[time=691] And if he is thirsty, give him water to drink.
[time=693] Trust in the Lord with all your heart and do not lean on your own understanding.
[time=697] Take my instruction and not silver and knowledge rather than choices gold.
[time=703] A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.
[time=718] â™ª
[time=734] Well, good morning.
[time=736] And the one thing, you know, the title is the storms, navigating the storms of life,
[time=743] the conflict of life, the trouble of life.
[time=746] One thing that we all have in common is the weather.
[time=749] In fact, it's been said, have you heard this, that if you don't like the weather in Indiana, just stick around for a while?
[time=755] Have you heard that?
[time=757] Well, we have this thing in Indiana that I learned as a kid
[time=763] that when there's a storm watch, that's different than when there's a storm warning.
[time=771] Have I got that? In a watch, the conditions are favorable that it may be the storm could come.
[time=779] But if there's a warning, someone has seen the storm.
[time=785] But it's not like that way in California.
[time=790] He is so, he's so right.
[time=793] You got to realize nine years ago when we first moved here.
[time=796] I'd never heard of a storm watch, never heard of a storm warning, never heard of storms, basically, because all we do out there is sit around, watch the Lakers and the Raiders in 75 degree sunny weather.
[time=808] So there's no understanding at all, right, when we moved here of weather.
[time=813] None.
[time=814] We do have earthquakes, that's true.
[time=816] Thank you, Dr. Longbreak, for pointing that out.
[time=819] We do have earthquakes.
[time=821] We might fall into the middle of the earth, but we're not going to, you know, have a bad storm.
[time=825] So when we moved here, we were at the house and the screen, the TV screen would, you know, come on, thunderstorm, watch or thunderstorm.
[time=832] It didn't matter if it said watch or warning.
[time=834] We didn't know about it.
[time=836] We didn't care about it because we were completely unaware.
[time=839] Well, in the early days, when we first got here, there were some folks who cared about us and wanted to make sure our transition was good.
[time=845] And so I remember early on, one guy calling, when the TV screen said, I think it was tornado warning, and, you know, we're there.
[time=854] The music's playing.
[time=855] The kids are dancing.
[time=856] We're having fun.
[time=857] It's a big deal.
[time=858] It's been on the screen for an hour, you know.
[time=861] And this voice, I pick up the phone, hey, birds, and this is my buddy.
[time=865] He says, are you in the basement?
[time=868] Are you in the basement?
[time=869] I said, no, I'm not in the basement.
[time=871] I'm out here on the cordless in the driveway playing with my kids.
[time=874] Oh, no.
[time=875] He educated me there real quick.
[time=878] He helped me right there that day.
[time=880] Understand the difference between a warning and a watch.
[time=885] And there's a really, really big difference, as Mitch said, when it's a warning, it's coming.
[time=893] And you'd better be ready.
[time=895] So what about you?
[time=898] What do you do when there's that storm warning?
[time=903] What would you do if you saw this?
[time=910] I'm Curtis Smith, live in the 21 Alive Weather Center with severe weather to tell you about this morning.
[time=915] We have a number of very strong fronts in the Midwest today.
[time=918] The first is a warm front, providing a lot of warm, moist air, and then two cold fronts coming in.
[time=924] The first is going to go through today and give us some very strong thunderstorms.
[time=927] The second cold front, and this is extremely unusual, will come in tonight and keep that chance of very strong thunderstorms in the forecast for the foreseeable future.
[time=936] This is an event we usually do not see.
[time=938] Constant storms and the National Weather Service has responded with a very rare event here.
[time=943] A severe thunderstorm warning for the entire region.
[time=946] All sides point to the fact that these storms will remain quite strong and they are not going to go away any time soon.
[time=952] There are no indications that the storms will be weakening.
[time=956] Coming up in sports, Dean will have highlights of both the Raiders and Lakers getting crushed.
[time=961] Right now, back to you.
[time=964] [laughter] Wow.
[time=971] Did somebody clap back there?
[time=973] [laughter] I sure see these people out.
[time=977] [laughter] With great affection.
[time=980] Weathering the storm of failure.
[time=984] Today as we go through the 30 sayings otherwise in our series on the Book of Proverbs,
[time=990] navigating through these storms of life, today we are going to talk about weathering the storm of failure because listen, we have a warning.
[time=1000] It's not a watch.
[time=1002] We have a warning.
[time=1004] In fact, Jesus said it this way, John 1633.
[time=1011] Jesus said, "I've told you these things so that in me you may have peace."
[time=1017] Because in this world you might have trouble.
[time=1023] It doesn't say that, does it?
[time=1026] In this world you will have trouble.
[time=1031] But take heart, I have overcome the world.
[time=1034] There's a warning.
[time=1035] The pressure system is here.
[time=1038] Where are you going to find your peace?
[time=1043] The pressure system is here.
[time=1046] Where are you going to find your peace?
[time=1051] See the first emperor of Rome, Augustus, had built this altar of peace.
[time=1056] And he said that peace was attained and maintained by military might.
[time=1064] And Jesus' listeners know about that.
[time=1067] And they hear Jesus say something radically different.
[time=1070] There's a warning.
[time=1072] Not a watch.
[time=1073] There's a warning.
[time=1076] The pressure system is here.
[time=1079] Where are you going to find your peace?
[time=1081] Because finding peace in the wrong place, that's failure.
[time=1086] And today we're going to see that failure is often times experienced in three arenas.
[time=1092] We're going to talk about today.
[time=1094] Failure is often times experienced in three arenas.
[time=1097] And we're going to see first that failure is experienced in the arena of sex.
[time=1104] So I'd like you to stand with me and we'll read the first passage here today.
[time=1109] Proverbs 23 verses 26 through 28.
[time=1117] Give me your heart, my son, and let your eyes delight in my ways.
[time=1123] For a harlot is a deep pit, and an adulterous woman is a narrow well.
[time=1132] Surely she lurks as a robber and increases the faithless among men.
[time=1140] And now, God, we offer this time to you.
[time=1143] May your Holy Spirit permeate the heart of every single human being, hearing this message.
[time=1152] And God made the words be yours, not ours.
[time=1154] And Jesus' mighty name, we pray.
[time=1156] [AMEN] You may be seated.
[time=1159] So failures often experience in the arena of sex, and we get this warning.
[time=1165] The warning is, look there in the first verse, give me your heart and let your eyes delight
[time=1175] in my ways.
[time=1177] The warning is, let's bring it up on the screen, the warning is wayward eyes, wayward eyes.
[time=1186] See, we're designed to have our eyes fixed on God, and when it comes to the topic of sex on our spouse, or if you're single, on your eventual spouse.
[time=1198] And so the warning is, watch the eyes.
[time=1204] Watch the eyes.
[time=1208] And it's been that way all through Scripture.
[time=1211] It says that Judah saw the woman he thought was a harlot, and he proceeded.
[time=1219] It says that David saw the woman taking a bath, and he proceeded.
[time=1228] And women don't get off the hook.
[time=1229] It says that Potiphar's wife saw that Joseph was handsome, and she pursued him.
[time=1237] And Jesus says that the eyes and the heart are inextricably linked.
[time=1246] You might want to write that down, but I can't spell inextricably.
[time=1251] The eyes and the heart are inextricably linked.
[time=1256] Jesus says in the Sermon on the Mount that the eyes are really the lens for the human heart.
[time=1263] The eyes take pictures of images, and these images are in your heart, and they're never
[time=1269] really taken away.
[time=1271] They're always there.
[time=1274] And so wayward eyes kind of comes in two fronts.
[time=1276] First of all, Solomon's talking to a son, and he's saying, "Hey, don't have wayward
[time=1282] eyes.
[time=1284] Don't undress the women you see.
[time=1288] Don't look at those images." But there's another kind of wayward eyes, and that's the woman's wayward eyes.
[time=1301] And that's the woman's wayward eyes that looks at a man with hooks in her eyes.
[time=1308] That communicates clearly a long linger, and that's when the warning signs ought to
[time=1315] go up on both accounts.
[time=1319] Because in that pressure system, if you find your peace somewhere other than God, you're
[time=1326] going to experience failure.
[time=1329] And it's interesting.
[time=1331] You can go in all these accounts in the Bible, and you can even look right here on what the consequence of this warning is.
[time=1338] And Solomon's really clear, and he says that a harlot, that's an unfaithful single woman,
[time=1346] is a deep pit.
[time=1348] An adulterous woman, an unfaithful married woman, is a narrow well.
[time=1354] And surely she lurks as a robber and increases the faithless among men.
[time=1362] A deep pit is empty.
[time=1365] That's the picture.
[time=1367] You go down this warning road of this pressure system, and you experience this failure.
[time=1375] You will have an emptiness in your soul.
[time=1380] He says a narrow well.
[time=1382] In our lifetimes, wells have been, health departments have mandated that they be bigger
[time=1388] in diameter than they have been.
[time=1390] Because a narrow well doesn't last.
[time=1395] And so that's what it's saying.
[time=1396] Kelly and I were talking about this impracticality.
[time=1400] And I said, Kelly, do you know anybody who left their spouses and got, and I didn't have
[time=1406] to finish the sentence?
[time=1408] And he says, and got married and are happy?
[time=1411] No, not one.
[time=1414] And it's because it's rooted in sin.
[time=1417] And the thousands of people I dealt with in the collector car world, I saw this all the time, I only know of one or two who actually got married, who left their spouses for each other because of wayward eyes and actually got married.
[time=1430] And I question whether they were happy.
[time=1434] And the problem is, is there's this dissatisfaction of the soul.
[time=1438] Our eyes were meant for our spouse and for God, just like Solomon writes here.
[time=1445] But when we have wayward eyes, and when a guy starts looking at women in the wrong way, and women start looking back with their eyes in the wrong way, there's going to be dissatisfaction and emptiness of the soul.
[time=1459] It's going to be a pit, it's going to be a narrow well, because it will not satisfy.
[time=1466] And look at what Proverbs 27, 20 says, I think it's Proverbs 27, 20.
[time=1476] Death and destruction are never satisfied, and neither are the eyes of man.
[time=1486] So you go down that pathway and experience failure with wayward eyes.
[time=1491] The warning is wayward eyes, because they're inextricably linked to the human heart.
[time=1498] And you are going to have a dissatisfaction in your soul, because your eyes will never
[time=1505] be satisfied by something apart from God.
[time=1511] Weathering the storm of failure, warning number one, when it comes to sex, watch out
[time=1519] for wayward eyes.
[time=1521] The consequence is dissatisfaction of the soul.
[time=1525] The pressure is here, it's a warning.
[time=1529] Where are you going to find your peace?
[time=1536] It's so interesting listening to you say it this hour, I didn't even think about this last hour, but this discussion of water and wells and satisfaction and God and those who
[time=1546] are thirsty, you and me.
[time=1549] My mind went to Jeremiah 2, I'll just read this to you, Jeremiah 2, 12, be appalled, go heavens at this and shudder, be very desolate, declares the Lord, why?
[time=1561] Why is God so grieved?
[time=1564] It says in verse 13, "For my people have committed two evils.
[time=1567] They have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and dug for themselves cisterns, wells,
[time=1578] within wells that hold no water."
[time=1588] It just doesn't work.
[time=1592] Finding peace in the wrong place, failure, I love that definition.
[time=1596] And secondly, we see as we go through the book of Proverbs that failure is oftentimes experienced in the arena of lies.
[time=1602] Write that down this morning, failure oftentimes experienced in the arena of lives.
[time=1606] You see, failure comes when we don't tell the truth.
[time=1612] See if you can detect a theme here as I read through a couple of these passages for you.
[time=1617] Turn to Proverbs 19, Proverbs 19, verses 5 and 9, see if you can't pick up a theme
[time=1624] being established.
[time=1625] It says in Proverbs 19, verse 5, "A false witness, a liar, will not go unpunished, and
[time=1632] he who tells lies will not escape." It says in verse 9 of chapter 19, "A false witness, a liar, will not go unpunished,
[time=1644] and he who tells lies will perish." Go to Proverbs 21, just skip over a few pages, the Proverbs 21, 28, it says in Proverbs 21,
[time=1657] 28, "A false witness, a liar, will perish." But the man who listens to the truth will speak forever.
[time=1668] I want you to think with me if you would for a moment here about the life of a liar.
[time=1674] The life of one who is given to speaking what isn't true again and again and again.
[time=1681] Think about it, with me, liars in the end don't have friends.
[time=1686] You see, liars lose their friends because their friends get tired of being lied to.
[time=1691] Liars don't have friends, liars don't keep jobs.
[time=1696] Liars lose the respect of their spouse and children, liars lose integrity, and gain a bad reputation.
[time=1702] They cheat, they steal, they conceal, they deceive, manipulate, twist, and destroy all
[time=1708] of it to further the what?
[time=1711] The lie.
[time=1714] Because you see, once it starts, it just kind of keeps going.
[time=1718] And so many times without repentance there, so many times without a drastic change as the lie keeps going, the concealing and the deceiving and the manipulating has to continue
[time=1728] as well.
[time=1729] Look at Proverbs 12.
[time=1734] This won't be on the screen, just turn there, if you will, Proverbs 12, 19 and 22.
[time=1744] Look at what God's word has to say about the lying tongue, about lying lips, about the
[time=1750] person given to falsehood.
[time=1752] Proverbs 12, 19 says, "Truthful lips will be established forever, but a lying tongue
[time=1760] is only for a moment." Look at verse 22, "Lying lips," here it gets real serious, "Lying lips are an abomination
[time=1770] to the Lord, but those who deal faithfully are His delight."
[time=1776] We kind of stumbled upon this first hour, Mitch and I both, just really struck by verse 19.
[time=1781] Go back there and look at that.
[time=1782] "Truthful lips will be established forever, but a lying tongue is only for a moment." Only for a moment.
[time=1788] What's that mean?
[time=1789] Well, you know you've been there.
[time=1790] I've been there.
[time=1792] Whether as a kid, whether as a teenager, or whether as an adult.
[time=1797] See the circumstance starts to play out, you realize where it's going and you know if you tell the truth, it might get really uncomfortable.
[time=1805] I mean if you tell her you didn't steal the cookie and then she believes that you didn't
[time=1811] steal the cookie, then you're not going to get in trouble for stealing the cookie.
[time=1815] So right there in the moment you say, "I didn't steal the cookie." And she goes, "Oh, good." And in your heart you go, "Whoo, relief, okay, okay, okay."
[time=1826] Wait, wait, wait, relief for good?
[time=1830] Relief for good?
[time=1831] No, because then she walked down the hall and she asked your brother, "Where did Jimmy
[time=1837] get the cookie?" And Jimmy says, "Well, he stole it." And then your moment, right, is gone.
[time=1847] I feel so convicted, and this came up last, this came up last hour to just hit me as he
[time=1853] was talking and reading the Word of God and describing it.
[time=1856] But I went back to the first time, and maybe you could think of this for you, the first time I ever lied.
[time=1864] And I was, I think about five.
[time=1867] And I had done something on the bathroom floor, not what you're thinking of, I broke the tile or something, and I can picture it, plain as day in my mind.
[time=1875] I can see the square and it's gone, and I remember my mom asked me, "My mom is a perfectionist.
[time=1882] My mom is alert." My mom said, "Michael, did you break the tile on the floor?"
[time=1890] No, I'm the only child, I'm the only one in the house.
[time=1897] And you know, I felt so relieved at the moment, but the way I'm wired, when I left that scene,
[time=1904] I was sick to my stomach until I came and confessed the truth about 25 years later.
[time=1915] I love your soft heart.
[time=1918] All right, here's the, here's the warning, okay?
[time=1923] Storm's coming.
[time=1924] It's here.
[time=1925] Here's the warning online.
[time=1926] You ready?
[time=1927] Write this down.
[time=1928] Avoid the X factor.
[time=1929] Let's explain this to you in just a minute here.
[time=1931] Avoid, this is really good, avoid the X factor, all right?
[time=1937] Okay, here's the X factor.
[time=1939] Let's suppose, here's how we'll do this.
[time=1942] Mitch, go over there to the piano and play a song.
[time=1945] Just knock one of those babies out, one of your best.
[time=1947] Suppose I had asked Mitch to play a new song, "One, two, three, four." There he goes, keep going, keep going.
[time=1958] Okay, thanks.
[time=1960] Were you going to start singing there?
[time=1962] All right, so there, Mitch played a song.
[time=1964] Let's say what I did was I asked Mitch to play a song in a setting like this, and then a week later I was in a different setting, and I said to those folks in that different setting, "Oh, you wouldn't have believed it." Last week we were in church, and I asked Mitch Cruz to play a song, and he was phenomenal.
[time=1979] And the problem with that is, I mean, you'd have thought the guy had lessons his whole life, I mean, he just played this piece that hugged the whole place in utter awe.
[time=1988] I mean, he was incredible.
[time=1990] And all the folks in that setting are going, "Wow, well, here's the X factor."
[time=1998] And I bet there are a lot of people in this room, myself included, who have trouble with
[time=2004] this.
[time=2005] Watch this.
[time=2006] Here's the X factor.
[time=2007] The X factor is this.
[time=2008] Here's how I want you to see this.
[time=2011] The truth plus something, what's it called, exaggerating.
[time=2020] The truth, here's what I want you to remember, the truth plus something, anything, or the
[time=2026] truth minus something, anything, even just that little thing that you just kind of slid
[time=2033] out the back.
[time=2034] Is the truth plus something, or the truth minus something does not equal the what?
[time=2044] It's just not the truth.
[time=2048] It didn't happen that way.
[time=2050] He didn't say it that way.
[time=2054] It's, and see, we call it exaggerating.
[time=2057] It's a what?
[time=2058] It's a lie.
[time=2061] Those of you like me who struggle with exaggeration at times, raise your hand.
[time=2065] See?
[time=2066] You're all liars.
[time=2067] Oh, come on.
[time=2069] No, seriously, we do that.
[time=2071] We take what is sin, and we give it different words, and then it's not sin.
[time=2075] It's just exaggerating.
[time=2079] The truth plus anything, or the truth minus anything, is not the truth.
[time=2086] Two things for you this week, and you can write these down.
[time=2088] Two things for you to work on.
[time=2090] Two things for you to think about.
[time=2091] Two things for you.
[time=2092] Every one of you can just engage in this little, these two, these two things.
[time=2096] Number one, I want you this week to really give it an effort.
[time=2100] I mean, today, as you leave this place, I mean, write it down somewhere or talk about it as a family, or, you know, make a note, send it to your accountability partner.
[time=2108] I mean, really work at this, this week.
[time=2110] Okay.
[time=2111] Here you go.
[time=2112] Practice telling the truth only.
[time=2114] I mean, really, really think about it.
[time=2116] Really, really be mindful of it.
[time=2118] Just tell the truth and only, what do you say on the stand when you take the stand on the court?
[time=2124] They say, raise your right hand.
[time=2125] I promise to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
[time=2130] That's our motto for the week.
[time=2133] You and me, right?
[time=2134] I'm going to do this with you.
[time=2136] I am going to tell the truth.
[time=2138] I am not going to add the truth.
[time=2140] I am not going to subtract from the truth.
[time=2144] In every situation that you're in, would you be willing today to commit to practice
[time=2151] telling the truth only?
[time=2155] Okay.
[time=2156] Secondly, and I want to say this to parents, parents of, you know, parents with kids of
[time=2163] all ages, obviously, but let me just say this to you specifically, let me kind of narrow it down a bit today and you'll see why.
[time=2170] Parents of those two to 12 years of age.
[time=2173] You're a parent and you've got some kids or a kid, two to 12 years of age.
[time=2178] You don't need me to stand here and remind you that in that age range is where liars
[time=2187] are brought up.
[time=2190] It's where gluttons are brought up.
[time=2193] It's where materialistic people are, I mean, it all happens.
[time=2197] This is no news to you.
[time=2200] So I'm asking you as parents on the lying front, especially between the ages of 2 and 12, would
[time=2207] you commit again to deliver your most serious and severe discipline, to bring your most
[time=2214] serious and severe consequences for not telling the truth?
[time=2222] Because if they learn at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 that somehow it can be fudged, somehow
[time=2228] it can be altered, somehow it can be skewed.
[time=2232] It can be called exaggerating instead of lying.
[time=2234] If they learn these things, then they're in trouble.
[time=2241] And so I'm asking you as parents to recommit along with me, to when you see it, when you run into it, when it happens in the biggies and in the small ones, to be willing to sit
[time=2252] with your kids, those, especially those who you can communicate with, and having delivered the physical discipline to also look them in their eyes and begin to dialogue with them
[time=2264] about how very, very important it is that we just tell the truth only.
[time=2272] Not the truth plus, not the truth minus, because that doesn't equal the truth.
[time=2281] The warning of sex, wayward eyes, the consequence is dissatisfaction of the soul.
[time=2288] In that presser system of the storm, wherever you find peace, the eyes were forgotten, the eyes were for your spouse, lies, the X factor, the added truth, you subtracted the truth.
[time=2301] The consequence of a lie is dissatisfaction of the soul.
[time=2306] Let me add this real quick to that, okay?
[time=2308] Let me just say this to you, I want everyone to be to just track with me on this real quick.
[time=2311] On the consequence there, you see it, same as the first one, dissatisfaction of the soul.
[time=2315] Guess what the lying individual feels.
[time=2319] Guess what the lying individual feels who has lost their money, lost their family, lost their job, their reputation, their friends, and their future.
[time=2326] You know what they feel?
[time=2327] They feel empty.
[time=2329] They have nothing.
[time=2333] Any consequence, the dissatisfaction of the soul at the deepest, most important level of their heart and life, they are dissatisfied, alone, and disgraced.
[time=2346] The presser system is here.
[time=2351] Where will you find your peace?
[time=2353] Failure is finding peace in the wrong location.
[time=2359] The third arena where we often find failure, according to Proverbs, is addictions.
[time=2366] Write it down, it's addictions.
[time=2368] Turn to Proverbs 23, 29 through 35, Proverbs 23, 29 through 35, who has woe, who has sorrow,
[time=2383] who has contention, what's contention, trouble, or storms.
[time=2391] Who has complaining, who has wounds without cause, who has redness of eyes, those who linger
[time=2401] with their eyes, those who linger long over wine, those who go to taste mixed wine.
[time=2410] See they would mix the wine in Palestine.
[time=2412] The rabbinical mixture was one part wine mix to three parts water.
[time=2417] You would literally drown in it before you would get drunk.
[time=2420] So how could you get drunk on mixed wine?
[time=2426] Change the mixture.
[time=2427] Pastor, how did you know that?
[time=2430] No, I'm just saying well, it's just easy math, right?
[time=2435] Change the mixture.
[time=2436] That's right, I'll be quiet now.
[time=2444] This is, do not look on the wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup, when it goes down smoothly.
[time=2451] At the last it bites like a serpent and stings like a viper.
[time=2456] Your eyes will see strange things.
[time=2458] Is anybody reminiscing here a little bit?
[time=2461] And your mind, don't raise your hand, and your mind will utter perverse things.
[time=2466] Your life is coming into my mind, and you will be like one who lies down in the middle of the sea, or like one who lies down on the top of a mast.
[time=2475] Dad, they struck me, but I did not become ill.
[time=2480] They beat me, but I did not know it.
[time=2483] When shall I awake?
[time=2485] I will seek another drink.
[time=2490] So the warning is substance abuse, write that down.
[time=2495] The warning is substance abuse, what's that?
[time=2501] You and I have been created as agents of surrender.
[time=2508] Surrender says I can't, you can, write that down.
[time=2512] Surrender says I can't, you can.
[time=2517] I can't be satisfied.
[time=2520] You can satisfy me.
[time=2523] And so, Blaze Pascal, the mathematician and philosopher, almost 400 years ago, said, you
[time=2531] have that box, he called it a vacuum.
[time=2535] And it was designed to say I can't, you can, to surrender your will to God.
[time=2543] Yet we put things as poor substitutes and that substance abuse in the surrender box.
[time=2551] Now it might not just be wine.
[time=2554] It might be food because I found that I've never accidentally eaten anything.
[time=2563] And maybe you can justify it.
[time=2566] There are studies and I have copies of them, more chocolate is actually good for you and makes your brain waves go and makes you a smarter, a wiser, a more energetic person.
[time=2574] You'll burn more calories when you work out and you'll build the kingdom of God.
[time=2581] I don't want to talk about it, but it might be Diet Pepsi.
[time=2585] Maybe the first thing, when you get up in the morning and you go to work out, you want to hear that and you want to kind of smell and feel that fizz and have that nice taste with no calories go down in your system.
[time=2595] But the irony of it is, you know a guy sick when he can smell Diet Pepsi and if you can
[time=2602] identify with that, you're sick too.
[time=2606] Smelling Diet Pepsi, oh my goodness.
[time=2609] The irony is that Diet Pepsi, because of caffeine, makes you hungry.
[time=2614] Is that amazing?
[time=2617] Diet Pepsi, because of caffeine, makes you thirsty.
[time=2621] And so the more I put in the surrender box, I can't, you can, and surrender my will to an object, a gift, rather than the giver, the more the consequence, and that's going
[time=2632] to come up, I experience is the more dissatisfied I am in my soul.
[time=2638] You might put golf in there.
[time=2639] There's nothing wrong with golf, Pastor.
[time=2644] The only thing would be is if you've put that in the box for God in your surrender box,
[time=2650] and it's keeping you from building the kingdom, it's keeping you from healthy relationships, it's keeping you from the Word of God, the people of God, the Spirit of God, you know, it might be food, it might be wine, it might be an illegal substance, it might be work.
[time=2668] Could be ministry.
[time=2669] It might be ministry.
[time=2671] Whatever you've put in that surrender box, I challenge you today to identify that and
[time=2677] reclaim the surrender box for God.
[time=2680] So what I've done when I work out, I've put working out in that box, I work out now to worship music, I'll either watch worship music, or I'll try to read the Bible, if I'm doing like the EFX, I'll read my Bible during that time.
[time=2693] If I run outside, I try to listen to worship music, if I'm inside, I try to watch a DVD, I just try to build God in my surrender box all the time and not let anything, any substance
[time=2705] abuse take its place.
[time=2707] Lastly, we'll do this.
[time=2710] Pull out a credit card, if you've got one.
[time=2714] Now credit cards aren't bad.
[time=2717] We need these to function most of the time in our marketplace, it's pretty hard to not
[time=2725] have one and function in our marketplace.
[time=2728] It's the abuse of this that's the problem.
[time=2733] Look at this little piece of plastic, what size is it?
[time=2736] A few inches by a few inches, surrendering my life to that.
[time=2744] And see that sin, anything in the surrender box, I can't, you can, other than God, is sin.
[time=2755] And sin is like this credit card and what we do with it.
[time=2760] It takes us farther than we wanted to go, kept us longer than we wanted to stay and
[time=2768] cost us more than we wanted to pay.
[time=2772] And the consequence, again and again and again, is dissatisfaction of the soul.
[time=2780] It takes us farther than we wanted to go, kept us longer than we wanted to stay and
[time=2788] cost us more than we wanted to pay, that's sin.
[time=2796] Putting anything else in the surrender box is substance abuse.
[time=2800] And again and again and again, we're going to be dissatisfied in our souls.
[time=2807] The Bible says, Proverbs just said, you'll wake up and you'll say, where can I get another fix?
[time=2813] But my favorite verse, the antidote to this.
[time=2816] One of my favorite verses in all of scripture is Psalm 145, 16, write it down, David said
[time=2822] this, David who knew a lot about sex, who knew a lot about lies, who knew a little bit
[time=2828] about addictions, said, God, you open your hand and you satisfy the desire of every living
[time=2838] thing.
[time=2841] God, you open your hand and you satisfy the desire of every living thing.
[time=2852] We were designed to surrender agents, put God in the surrender box.
[time=2861] Let me take you back where we started, okay?
[time=2864] Stay with us here.
[time=2865] John 16, it's where this whole talk this morning began because Jesus said the storms are coming.
[time=2873] It's not maybe, it's not wait and see.
[time=2876] He said, no, no, no, John 1633, you saw it right there on the screen.
[time=2880] I have told you these things so that in me, in me, in me, he said, no other box.
[time=2886] But he said, in me, you will have peace.
[time=2889] In this world, you will have trouble.
[time=2895] The screen's going to go red, the warning's going to come, the storm's going to hit.
[time=2901] And where are you going to seek peace and shelter?
[time=2904] Watch this, Proverbs 24-10, we're going to end with this, Proverbs 24-10, then we're
[time=2910] going to worship God this morning.
[time=2911] We're going to respond to the message today in worship.
[time=2914] Watch this, Proverbs 24-10, now think about it, the storm is hitting, you're in the midst
[time=2920] of the struggle.
[time=2922] The opportunities are there, the temptations are real life.
[time=2927] And Proverbs 24-10 says, if you are slack, you see that word there?
[time=2932] If you are slack in the day of distress, your strength is limited.
[time=2937] That word slack in the Hebrew, write this down, that word slack in the original language means a hands-off, relaxed, lacking intensity, kind of approach.
[time=2950] And we've talked about this before, people, this life of following Him, this opportunity
[time=2957] that He's given you an eye to live God-honoring lives.
[time=2960] It is a battle, it is a fight, the enemy's very real.
[time=2964] These three things will ruin your life and mind.
[time=2969] And if you think for a moment that you can be out in the driveway playing with the kids when a tornado warning has been delivered, I guess Proverbs would say that you're a fool.
[time=2983] No, no, no, he says you and I have to be willing in these three areas to not take a slack approach
[time=2990] but to stop at absolutely nothing, to go to whatever length you may need to go to, to
[time=2997] ask for whatever degree of help you may need to ask for, to submit yourself to whatever levels of accountability you may need to submit yourself to.
[time=3008] Believers here in the room today, those of you who have surrendered your heart and life to Christ, would you look at Romans 6 with me?
[time=3014] I want to send you out today with this as a thought.
[time=3019] Romans 6, look at Romans 6, every one of you that knows the Lord, every one of you like me who is trying His are her best to in the midst of these kinds of storms, in the midst of this type of temptation, follow Him faithfully.
[time=3032] Here's what I want you to think about this week as you leave.
[time=3034] Romans 6, look at verse 12, I want you to sense how willing and ready He is to help you, yes, but I want you to sense that He puts some responsibility on you and I as well.
[time=3047] Says Romans 6, 12, therefore do not, look, He says to you, don't let sin reign in your
[time=3054] rule, in your mortal body, so that you obey its lusts, well, how can I not let sin reign?
[time=3061] Well, don't go on presenting the members of your body to sin as instruments of unrighteousness,
[time=3068] but do the opposite.
[time=3070] Present yourselves the members of your body, your hands and your feet and your eyes and your stomach and your mouth.
[time=3077] Present yourselves to God as those alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.
[time=3084] Here's the point, sex lies addiction in every one of those arena, folks, those of you that
[time=3090] know Him, it requires you and I literally going there.
[time=3097] You have to drive by His house.
[time=3101] You have to click on the mouse.
[time=3105] You have to linger with the physically we're doing things with our bodies and the members of our bodies that bring the storm closer, stop, ask for whatever help you need, seek
[time=3121] whatever levels of accountability you might benefit from, share the struggle with a good friend, but don't go there, don't click on there, don't call her, don't, don't present
[time=3133] the members, take your ears and your eyes and your soul and your feet out of the equation.
[time=3142] And you know like I know that sometimes you need help doing that.
[time=3147] And that's where your humility in mind comes in where we have to say, "You know what?
[time=3151] I need help.
[time=3153] I don't want to go there.
[time=3155] I don't want to see that.
[time=3156] I don't want to have those conversations.
[time=3158] I don't want to click." So, help me.
[time=3161] The Word of God and the Spirit of God and yes, even the people of God can help you do that.
[time=3168] Those of you here who don't know Him, those of you here in the room and you have not come
[time=3174] to the point, I'm going to tell you what Steve told you last week.
[time=3178] You can't battle this in and of your own strength and might.
[time=3184] It's just not going to work.
[time=3186] You're going to get your clock cleaned.
[time=3188] You're going to get your life ruined.
[time=3189] You're going to get a dissatisfied soul day in and day out unless you come to the place
[time=3197] where you surrender fully.
[time=3200] Every component and part of your life to Him because it's only in Him that your sins
[time=3206] are forgiven, it's only in Him that life can be found, it's only in Him that the Spirit of God can come and dwell and give you an eye, the strength and the ability to wage this kind of war against an enemy who wants you and I destroyed.
[time=3221] And so for the believer this morning we beg you, Romans 6, 12 and 13, stop at nothing to
[time=3227] take your members, your body out of the equation, the equation that leads to death.
[time=3233] Those of you that don't know Him this morning, we'd like to invite you today.
[time=3237] Maybe today you need to make that decision.
[time=3241] And so as we sing this morning, I'm going to ask Corbin and the band to come and as we sing, please don't leave.
[time=3248] Use this as an opportunity to respond to God.
[time=3251] And if you'd like to pray about something, if you'd like to talk with us about what it means to fully surrender, if there's some things we've talked about today that in all honesty and with real humility you know you need some help with and you want to start that out by just praying about it with maybe Mitch or myself or some of the guys on our team who will be available.
[time=3272] How we sing, no big deal, it's okay, you can just come down and we'll pray.
[time=3277] Just some folks that love you.
[time=3281] Some folks that have walked where you walk have felt what you feel and would love nothing more than to put our arms around you and do what we can to help.
[time=3290] So if you need to know Him today, let us talk you through that.
[time=3294] If you need some prayer to keep fighting the battle, let us pray and come alongside, we'll
[time=3300] be down here, let me invite you to stand and let's just sing, let's worship our God in spirit and in truth.
[time=3307] Let's do that together.
[time=3330] Let's sing, let's sing, let's sing, let's sing, let's sing, let's sing, let's sing
[time=3400] Jesus, be the center, be in my source, be in my light, Jesus, Jesus, be the center
[time=3430] Be my home, be my soul, Jesus, be the fire in my heart, be the fire in my heart, be the
[time=3449] fire in my heart, be the fire in my heart, be the fire in my heart, be the fire in my
[time=3476] heart, be my friend, be my God, Jesus, be the fire, be the fire in my heart, be the
[time=3494] fire in my heart, be the fire in my heart, be the way in my heart, be the way in my
[time=3521] heart, be the fire in my heart, be the fire in my heart, be the fire in my heart, be the
[time=3601] [BLANK_AUDIO]
