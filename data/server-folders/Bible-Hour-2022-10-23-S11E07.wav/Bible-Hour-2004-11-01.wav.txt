[time=30] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=90] To provide my every need, you were there when I was lonely, you were there in all my pain, gliding my footsteps, a shelter from the rain, and it was you who made my life complete.
[time=119] [MUSIC]
[time=122] You are to me, my everything, and that is why I sing.
[time=132] [MUSIC]
[time=163] If you weren't there, you are the joy of my salvation, you're the peace in my story.
[time=177] Your loving arms protect me, they shelter me from heart, you are alpha and omega, the beginning and the end.
[time=195] My strong tower, my dearest and best friend, and with you who made my life complete.
[time=214] You are to me, my everything, and that is why I sing.
[time=224] Jesus, I love you because you care, I couldn't imagine if you weren't there, Jesus, I love you because you care for me, I don't know what I would do without you.
[time=250] [MUSIC - 60 seconds]
[time=325] Jesus, I love you, I love you, Jesus, I love you, I love you.
[time=376] [MUSIC]
[time=388] Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, senior pastor here at Blackhawk Ministries, and I am so grateful for the chance to share with you today, actually one of my kind of more private hobbies, most of you see me preaching each week, but little did you know that I'm actually kind of a sound technician expert.
[time=406] And these are just some of my toys that I like to play around with, this is my TAS Chem SX-1 unit right here that does a lot of the editing, and over there, that's our SyncMaster 172 in monitor, see, I just read and stuff off the thing that I have no idea what I'm talking about, and I'm rarely even in this room, but I wanted to just take the opportunity to let you know that there are so many people, so many guys and gals who man stations just like this,
[time=435] who give their expertise and their time and their involvement in the sound arena, in the video arena, musically, visually, we've got some technical folks that are just absolutely second to none.
[time=448] And those are the people that help bring the Bible hour to you each and every week, they are also the folks that bring us our in-house stuff each weekend as we gather to worship, and they do a wonderful job of that each and every week of the year, but that team is really looking forward to something that I'm really looking forward to, and I know many of you are as well.
[time=470] That's right, it's that time of year, again, to begin to think about and plan for and even pray for our 28th annual celebration of Christmas here at Blackhawk Ministries.
[time=481] We call it Christmas with Blackhawk, and this year is going to be just a phenomenal celebration of this timeless story of Christ's birth.
[time=491] I have already heard much of the music, I'm familiar with the dramatic touch that's going to be brought from the kids to the adults, from the music to the drama, some of the staging that's going to take place this year, you will not believe.
[time=506] And I am so thankful that we get the chance to bring this incredible story of truth to this incredible community once again.
[time=514] On the website that you'll see at the bottom of our screen, you can go to that website or you can call the phone number that you see, either place you can go and get ticket information.
[time=524] We're sure that thousands will come, they always do, and we want to make sure that you, in our Bible Hour audience, get your tickets as quickly as possible.
[time=533] And you know what, not just for you, but why don't you think about who it is in your world, where you work, where you live, some folks that you know, who is it that you could maybe pick up a couple of extra tickets for and invite them to come with you this year.
[time=547] Give them the opportunity, along with you, to hear this incredible message of birth and life and forgiveness and hope. What an amazing time it will be.
[time=557] We are so very looking forward to it, and we would ask that you would join us in praying that God would do an amazing thing as we gather those first two weekends of December to celebrate Christmas here at Black Hawk.
[time=570] Thank you so very much for tuning in. Thank you for your prayers. God bless you, and have a great week.
[time=576] Well, hey, guys. Hi, Jeff. Hi, Jeffy. Well, Barb, Leo, it's down to you, too.
[time=583] Now, you guys have been through a lot together, but one of you is about to be named "Soul Survivor" and win $1 million.
[time=590] Now, your future is in the hands of your fellow tribe members, and it's all up to them. Barb, how do you feel?
[time=599] Well, I'm feeling pretty good, actually. I'm really excited to be here with Leo. You know, we've had an alliance since the beginning, and we both stayed true to our word, so, yeah, I'm looking forward to it.
[time=610] Leo, what about you? How do you feel? I'm feeling kind of tired, a little sweaty, a little stinky, but kind of lonely, too, without everybody else around, but I can't imagine a better person to be here at the end with than Barb.
[time=625] Good, good. She makes a great, hissing cockroach casserole, second to none. Thanks.
[time=633] All right, all right. Barb, what do you think is going to happen here?
[time=638] Well, you know, when I first came into this game, I had no idea I would make it this far. I mean, I'm really glad to be here, but as far as the future and what's going to happen, well, I'm just glad it's not up to me.
[time=650] Leo, what about you? What's up in your future? Well, I'm always trying to plan for the future, Jeff. That's why I formed an alliance with Barb early on, so she was a hard worker, thought that would be a good place to start.
[time=662] As far as million dollars go, I mean, man, sure is a lot of money, but talk to the producers, and it looks like there's been quite a few sales calls on the island, so if the sale goes well, you know, the commission will be pretty good. I think I'll be doing all right here.
[time=676] All right, well, as you know, your fellow tribe members' votes have been counted.
[time=682] Now, remember, this time you want to see your name written on that ballot. Are you too ready to know your future?
[time=689] Yeah, I think so. Okay. Let's roll the video.
[time=698] The person that I'm going to give the million dollars to is the person that convinced me to give my haircut.
[time=706] You know, that gave me the confidence to get out, get a job, and I feel like a new person. I feel like a million bucks, so the million bucks is yours. Go for it.
[time=727] I'm going for the person that had the brains in this operation. This person had a great strategy.
[time=732] Came in here, looked like the fool, but all the time, he was the one with the brains. Nobody suspected him. Nobody thought he was a threat.
[time=741] Leo, the money is all yours.
[time=746] It's still scary.
[time=754] The person I'm voting for tonight is the one I feel is more deserving of the money.
[time=760] Leo, you have a band already. You can make it big any time.
[time=764] So, Barb, I want you to get the money because you stuck through it and you're a great team player.
[time=772] The person I am voting for is Barb. I want Barb to win because she is just such a wonderful person.
[time=782] She was always a team player, always nice to others, and she was a really, really hard worker. She was a big contributor to everybody.
[time=791] So, Barb, I hope you get the money. After all this is over, let's do lunch.
[time=805] Barb, I couldn't vote for you. You and I were never in alliance together and you really weren't much of a friend.
[time=812] I'm giving my vote to Leo. He was cunning, smart, wise. He was nobody's fool.
[time=829] The person I'm voting for tonight deserves the million dollars and I'm going to tell you why.
[time=836] They were a smart little cookie. They worked their little tails off. When the go and got tough, they got tougher.
[time=843] They outwit, outlast, outplay, and they're going to win the million bucks. Thanks to me.
[time=852] Well, well, well. I counted two votes for Barb and two votes for you, Leo. As you can see, we didn't show you who texts and Cecily voted for.
[time=862] I've got their votes right here. When I read these votes, the decision is final.
[time=867] The person with the most votes will be declared sole survivor and will walk away with one million dollars.
[time=879] And the winner of survivor Blackhawk is...
[time=882] The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, fools despise wisdom and instruction.
[time=888] Train up a child in the way he should go. Even when he is old, he will not depart from it.
[time=893] If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat, and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink.
[time=898] Trust in the Lord with all your heart and do not lean on your own understanding.
[time=902] Take my instruction and not silver in knowledge rather than choice his goal.
[time=908] A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.
[time=932] [MUSIC]
[time=940] Well, today we come to the end of our eight-week journey through the Book of Proverbs and what a journey it has been.
[time=949] Over the last two months' worth of Sundays, we have taken a very close and personal look at some of the vital, everyday issues of life.
[time=958] Our families, our friendships, our finances, our faith, even our failures.
[time=964] And we've asked the all-important question, what does God in his wisdom have to say about each?
[time=973] Proverbs is where we've turned this great, great book of wisdom.
[time=977] And what we have in essence done as we've looked at the Book of Proverbs is ask the question, how can we approach?
[time=984] How can we approach? How can we handle? How can we engage?
[time=988] Those of us that know him and are doing our very best with his help to follow him, how can we engage in this life endeavor?
[time=997] How can we approach family, friendships, finances, faith, and failure in a way that honors God, in a way that honors God's wise design?
[time=1008] And I wish you could have over the last eight weeks read the emails that I have read.
[time=1013] I wish you could have or hear some of the conversations that I have had the privilege of participating in.
[time=1020] I wish you could read the letters. I wish you could just sense. Some of you might.
[time=1025] Some of you may have some of the same conversations. I have been so amazed and so encouraged.
[time=1030] At the way God has used this series, the way he has used our study, our best effort at this with his help,
[time=1036] to reach deep into the hearts and lives of many and bring drastic life-altering change.
[time=1043] I don't normally say this from the front, but I would really encourage you if you are here today
[time=1049] and you've missed a few weeks of the eight, if you've got a friend or family member who could use some encouragement,
[time=1057] some timely reminders possibly. In the area of life and wisdom, you might want to just order a set today.
[time=1064] You might want to go to the Black Hawk to Go table and just order your own set all eight weeks.
[time=1070] It's available in CD, DVD, video cassette. It would probably be a worthwhile investment
[time=1076] so that they could enjoy or so that you could even maybe catch up on where we've been these last couple of months.
[time=1084] Well, today we're actually going to conclude the series with one last discussion.
[time=1090] One last topic that the Book of Proverbs speaks too often, a topic that will affect each and every person
[time=1097] in this room this morning, a topic that is both unavoidable, a topic that is so very urgent.
[time=1105] Today we look to the Scriptures to discuss and better understand our spiritual future, our future.
[time=1115] I don't know who won the million bucks in the drama right there, but I'll tell you what, whoever did, their physical future was about to be immediately impacted.
[time=1126] This morning I would like to invite you to take that discussion a little bit further and I would like you to be willing today to consider something that each and every one of us has to consider, and that is our spiritual future.
[time=1140] When did yours change? Do you remember?
[time=1145] When did your spiritual future, when did you and the issue of eternity, when did that get clear for you?
[time=1156] When did your spiritual future change, or maybe I should ask this morning for some in the room, has it?
[time=1165] Has it changed? Most of you know my story. Most of you in the room know that at the age of 20,
[time=1172] as a very confused, very bitter, very angry young man who had been through a great deal
[time=1178] and had since then made a lot of really bad choices.
[time=1182] At the age of 20, because of the work of the Spirit of God, as he drew me to himself, at the age of 20,
[time=1190] I fully surrendered, fully submitted my heart and my life to him.
[time=1197] I was 20 years old, it was 21 years ago, September 1983.
[time=1204] I fully surrendered my heart and life to him and in so doing my future, my spiritual future was changed.
[time=1212] Why do I always say that? Why do I always say my heart and my life?
[time=1217] Because it's so very important to understand the dynamic of what's going on there.
[time=1221] See, my heart, I can't speak for you, but I know I can speak for me. My heart was a mess.
[time=1227] My heart needed help. My heart at the time was empty, bitter and in search of anything that would numb the pain,
[time=1235] or just distract it from the pain of a father who had left and a childhood of religion and hypocrisy and confusion.
[time=1245] My life at that time or my life prior, just prior to that night, was marked by a morality, basketball and substances.
[time=1254] And if you were here last week, you'll understand this, and the absolute total abuse of all three.
[time=1261] Because my surrender box, if you were here last week, you know what we mean.
[time=1266] My surrender box, I had placed those things in my box of surrender.
[time=1272] When I was given, I was completely devoted to. I was fully surrendered to those things.
[time=1279] And my life bore witness to the fact.
[time=1283] My heart was in trouble, empty and bitter. My life, my life was out of control. I was tired.
[time=1290] You say, "How could you be tired? You were twenty." Well, you know what? If you've ever lived that life, you know exactly what I mean.
[time=1298] I was weary at the age of twenty, burdened by guilt and shame.
[time=1304] And my life, it seemed meaningless. It did.
[time=1310] I came to the realization at that time in my life that I had no future.
[time=1316] None. You understand what I mean there?
[time=1320] See, when you live each day to ease the pain, you don't live for the future. You live for the weekend.
[time=1327] It's about all she wrote. It's about as far as it goes.
[time=1332] You live for the next fix. You live for the next event that somehow is going to distract your heart from the emptiness that it feels.
[time=1341] Had no future. I had no hope, just a hangover.
[time=1346] Nothing to look forward to, just a growing list of regret and shame.
[time=1350] And then after a series of divinely orchestrated, amazing events, I found myself in church on a Sunday night in September 1983,
[time=1360] listening to John MacArthur preach through Romans 7, where it says, "O wicked man that I am, who will save me from this body of death."
[time=1370] And after months and months of searching and asking and conversing and listening, I surrendered my heart and my life to him.
[time=1380] And I want to tell you something. I was thinking about it again this week.
[time=1384] And it's amazing looking back at this.
[time=1387] That moment, my head was, I've told you before, my head was bowed on the wood rail there on the top of the pew, right?
[time=1395] I just leaned forward and put my head, my forehead right there on that pew, the wood right there.
[time=1400] And I gave him everything.
[time=1403] And in that moment of supernatural regeneration, when the Spirit of God came, and in that moment saved me,
[time=1412] there were some things that almost immediately came clear.
[time=1418] And I've shared a few of those with you before. One of them was I would never be in ministry.
[time=1423] And I wouldn't go so well.
[time=1426] There was another realization that I had.
[time=1429] And I remembered it this week as I thought about this.
[time=1432] For the first time and as long as I could remember, I realized in that moment that I had a future to look forward to.
[time=1442] I realized in that moment that I finally had something to live for.
[time=1448] And it utterly and deeply changed me.
[time=1452] With forgiveness of sin and a life now devoted to following Him, there came meaning and the reality of eternity.
[time=1461] Are you kidding me? I had lived for a handful of years.
[time=1466] I didn't think about eternity.
[time=1469] I thought about the sin that I was absolutely engrossed in.
[time=1476] It covered every part of me.
[time=1480] Now I was free.
[time=1482] And I could now see clearly where I was going, and I could also see in much clearer fashion where I had been.
[time=1489] And I want to talk to you today. I want the Word of God to speak to you today about two futures.
[time=1495] Because there are two.
[time=1498] When it's all said and done, at the end of the day, there are two realities as it relates
[time=1505] to your future in mind.
[time=1507] The one I looked back at as I considered where I had been is what we'll call a future found in sin.
[time=1513] You can write that down this morning.
[time=1515] A future found in sin. The Bible speaks to this.
[time=1519] The Bible speaks clearly to this. Look at Proverbs. The book of Proverbs speaks clearly to this.
[time=1523] Proverbs 23, 17 and 18. A future found in sin.
[time=1528] It says, "Do not let your heart envy sinners. Do not let your heart envy sinners but live in the fear of the Lord.
[time=1538] But live in the fear of the Lord always. Surely there is a future and your hope will not be cut off.
[time=1545] Do not let your heart, it says, envy sinners.
[time=1551] People understand this morning that when sin is envied.
[time=1556] Think about that just for a moment because that's really how it works.
[time=1559] I mean, you may not have said it that way but when sin is envied.
[time=1564] When the activity of sin, with all that comes with sin, no matter how you dress it up, you know, when that is what you're after, when that is what you're pursuing, be it the sin or the sinners.
[time=1576] When sin is what is envied, when disobedience to the design God has given us,
[time=1583] and more of it is pursued, understand what the Word of God is saying here.
[time=1588] Hope and peace and contentment is diminished, right?
[time=1595] Or is it increased? I mean, if somebody here's got a different story, please tell me.
[time=1600] If somebody here has envied sin like I have in the past, if somebody here has run after it, if somebody here in this room has embraced it, if somebody here in this room has given themselves to the pursuit of sin and it hasn't diminished your hope, your contentment or your peace, please let me know.
[time=1620] Because you know what, in 20 years of doing this, I've never met one.
[time=1626] Not one.
[time=1631] Somebody once said there is nothing more destructive or detrimental.
[time=1634] Nothing more destructive or detrimental to the pursuit of a peaceful heart than a heart full of growing sin and shame with nowhere to go.
[time=1645] A heart full of sin and shame with nowhere to go. Nothing more destructive.
[time=1650] Nothing more detrimental to the pursuit of a peaceful heart.
[time=1653] Hope is cut off.
[time=1658] 23, 18, surely there is a future and your hope will not be cut off.
[time=1662] It will be cut off. Look at Proverbs 24.
[time=1665] If that's the future, you choose Proverbs 24, 19 and 20.
[time=1670] Do not fret because of evil doers.
[time=1674] Translation there. Don't get all worked up thinking you're missing out on something.
[time=1679] Some of you parents are dealing with this.
[time=1686] They see it, you know, they see it. They see what's going on.
[time=1689] They hear what's taking place. They kind of catch wind.
[time=1693] You know, and sometimes they want to go and do and be apart and you say, gee whiz, you want to do all you can to help them understand.
[time=1700] Don't fret because of evil doers.
[time=1703] Don't think for a moment you're missing out on anything significant
[time=1709] or be envious of the wicked for there will be no future for the evil man.
[time=1718] You can't be said any clearer folks. There will be no future.
[time=1724] As far as desirable futures, as far as peaceful futures, as far as futures filled with contentment and meaning there will be no future for the evil man, the lamp of the wicked will be put out.
[time=1740] Here the Scriptures get very direct as to what the future of the wicked will look like. And just real quick, who are the wicked?
[time=1749] It's such a harsh term. It's such a serious term.
[time=1753] Sometimes folks might sit back and say, well, I'm not wicked.
[time=1759] You know, I'm just this. And I'm just that.
[time=1763] By all means, I'm not wicked.
[time=1766] Well, let's not play semantics. Let's just get on the same page here this morning.
[time=1771] Are we getting? I mean, we're here or we're here?
[time=1776] Surrender box. We're fully submitted and fully surrendered to him.
[time=1782] Or we're not. And if we're not, something has taken his place and that is sin.
[time=1788] So we're either fully submitted to our Savior, we're either fully submitted to Christ, or we're fully submitted to sin.
[time=1797] It's just one or the other.
[time=1802] And that is the definition of wicked. That is the definition of evil.
[time=1807] That is the definition of simple. I mean, whatever word you want to put in there, the lamp of the wicked will be put out.
[time=1816] Lamp, interesting phrase there.
[time=1818] Oftentimes in biblical literature, you'll see this phrase lamp, and it has to do with or it pictures the life, the vitality and life of the individual, the heart and soul of the person.
[time=1830] And here it says, "For there will be no future for the evil man.
[time=1834] The lamp of the wicked will be put out." When the lamp is put out, when there is no more light,
[time=1840] that means that person then is resigned to live in what?
[time=1845] Darkness.
[time=1847] It's anonymous with sin, evil and separation from God.
[time=1853] You know, one of the most graphic, one of the most graphic depictions, or descriptions of a future rooted in sin.
[time=1864] It's found in Job 18. We want you to turn there.
[time=1867] If you have your Bibles, turn back to just before the book of Psalms, you'll come to Job.
[time=1871] And I want you to go to Job 18. Would you do that?
[time=1876] Job 18, we're going to pick it up in verse 5, and we're going to read a little ways here, so stay with me. I want you to, as we read, just open your heart and open your mind to a very vivid description of what it looks like when this is the future one chooses.
[time=1892] When this is the road one chooses to walk down, when this is the direction of life that one
[time=1898] gives him or herself to, here is where that leads.
[time=1903] Job 18, verse 5, "Indeed the light," there you go again.
[time=1907] "Indeed the light of the wicked goes out, and the flame of his fire gives no light.
[time=1913] The light in his tent is darkened, and his lamp goes out above him.
[time=1917] His vigorous stride," stop right there. His vigorous stride, eyes up here just for a moment.
[time=1922] You would understand that, right?
[time=1925] You would understand vigorous stride.
[time=1927] That's the kind of stride you and I make when we initially embark upon our sinful endeavor, because initially, right?
[time=1936] I mean, initially it's all going to be okay, right?
[time=1938] Initially it's going to bring satisfaction, right?
[time=1940] Initially it's going to make you feel good.
[time=1943] Initially it's going to bring a sense of relief, right?
[time=1945] So boom, off we go in our vigorous stride toward that which does not fulfill.
[time=1955] His vigorous stride is shortened, and his own scheme brings him down,
[time=1961] for he is thrown into the net by his own feet, and he steps on the webbing.
[time=1965] A snare seizes him by the heel, and a trap snaps shut on him.
[time=1968] A noose for him is hidden in the ground, and a trap for him on the path.
[time=1972] All around, terrors frighten him, and hairy him at every step.
[time=1976] His strength is famished, and calamity is ready at his side.
[time=1980] His skin is devoured by disease, the first born of death devours his limbs.
[time=1986] He is torn from the security of his tent, and they march him before the king of terrors.
[time=1994] There dwells in his tent nothing of his.
[time=1997] Brimstone is scattered on his habitation.
[time=1999] His roots are dried below, and his branches cut off above.
[time=2005] Memory of him perishes from the earth, and he has no name abroad.
[time=2009] He is driven from light into darkness, and chased from the inhabited world.
[time=2014] He has no offspring or posterity among his people, nor any survivor where he sojourned.
[time=2020] Those in the west are appalled at his fate, and those in the east are seized with horror.
[time=2025] Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked.
[time=2035] This is the bottom line, the end of the story, and this is the place of him.
[time=2043] Who what?
[time=2044] Read it.
[time=2045] Who does not know God.
[time=2052] Well that's one future, my friends, and it's very real.
[time=2058] It's very true.
[time=2060] It's very dark, and it is the end of the road for the one who has placed his future in sin.
[time=2070] For me personally it was the future that I had been delivered and rescued from.
[time=2075] And remember, that's where I was headed, not due to the fact that I drank too much, or was promiscuous.
[time=2081] See that was going to be my future because I didn't know the Lord.
[time=2087] I hadn't believed the gospel.
[time=2090] I had not submitted my heart and life to him.
[time=2095] When I did, I learned that there was another future.
[time=2099] Number two, write it down, please this morning.
[time=2102] A future found, not in sin, but a future found in him.
[time=2109] A future found in him.
[time=2113] And what a difference, look at Proverbs, go back to Proverbs 24.
[time=2118] It says in Proverbs 24, 13 and 14, "My son, my son eat honey for it is good."
[time=2125] Yes, the honey from the comb is sweet to your taste.
[time=2130] And know this, know that wisdom is thus for your soul.
[time=2134] It's sweet to the taste.
[time=2137] It's good.
[time=2138] Know that wisdom is thus for your soul, if you find it, then there will be, then there will be a future.
[time=2145] And your hope will not be cut off.
[time=2153] See at that point of full surrender, I had found, know that wisdom is thus for your soul.
[time=2157] If you find it, then there will be a future.
[time=2159] I had found wisdom.
[time=2160] How had I found wisdom?
[time=2162] How had I found knowledge?
[time=2164] Proverbs 1, 7, remember the very beginning of this study?
[time=2168] We said there was a verse that was just kind of the overarching theme of the whole thing.
[time=2172] Proverbs 1, 7, the what?
[time=2174] The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.
[time=2177] See, I had found the Lord.
[time=2178] I had developed a healthy fear of the Lord in developing a healthy fear of the Lord.
[time=2184] In coming to know the Lord, I had found wisdom.
[time=2191] And in finding wisdom, Proverbs 24 says, I gained a future.
[time=2198] What an amazing future.
[time=2201] What a hopeful future.
[time=2205] People, I want you to stop and think about it just for a moment this morning.
[time=2208] If you know him this morning, if you have fully submitted, fully surrendered, fully given yourself to him, please be reminded, I'm going to help you here in a few minutes.
[time=2216] I'm going to help remind you of the kind of future that you have.
[time=2221] Because sometimes we get a little foggy on it.
[time=2224] Sometimes it gets a little sketchy.
[time=2225] Sometimes we need to be reminded of this future that we have in him.
[time=2231] And I don't want this this morning to just be a simple discussion between heaven and hell.
[time=2237] I mean, it could be.
[time=2239] It would be a truthful discussion if that's all we said today.
[time=2243] And sometimes I feel as if we might need to, and maybe we will teach a little bit more on those two realities in the days to come.
[time=2251] I mean, we could summarize it that way.
[time=2253] We're talking about the difference between heaven, eternity with him, and hell.
[time=2261] Eternity separated from him.
[time=2265] Both very real.
[time=2267] Both very, very true.
[time=2271] But I want to move beyond that just for a moment this morning.
[time=2275] I mean, we could go back and forth on the comparisons.
[time=2278] We could talk about this amazing future that a believer has in heaven.
[time=2283] We can talk about the constant pain avoided, the constant flame avoided, the gnashing of teeth,
[time=2291] the eternal separation from God, the pain and horror and terror of being in the presence of the evil one.
[time=2300] It's all very real.
[time=2302] This morning, I would like to remind you of what an amazing, hopeful future there is for those of us that know him.
[time=2311] For those of us that have surrendered our hearts and lives to him.
[time=2315] Let's do it this way.
[time=2317] A future found in him is A, and I want you to get your pens out and just write these four.
[time=2323] I think we're only going to have time for about four.
[time=2325] There's about 28, but we'll do our best to get through the list here.
[time=2329] It's an amazing time I had over the last few days just looking through the Scriptures and just seeing for myself all over again the kind of future that's been provided.
[time=2340] The promise of a certain kind of future.
[time=2343] Here you go, write this down.
[time=2344] A future found in him is a sealed future.
[time=2354] Ephesians 1, write that down, Ephesians 1 verses 13 and 14.
[time=2359] Let me talk to you this morning just for a moment about your future, how it is sealed.
[time=2364] In him it says Ephesians 1, Paul writing the church at Ephesus and explaining to them, teaching them about their spiritual position.
[time=2374] They're standing with God.
[time=2376] In him you also, after listening to the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation,
[time=2382] having also believed, having come to faith in him, having fully submitted and surrendered yourself to him, right?
[time=2389] Having also believed you were sealed in him with the Holy Spirit of Promise.
[time=2396] The Holy Spirit of Promise who is given to you and I as believers as a pledge of our inheritance, our future,
[time=2405] were the view to the redemption of God's own possession to the praise of His glory, sealed.
[time=2416] It's interesting to read about how they would send very important documents in that day.
[time=2422] That's where this imagery comes from, this idea of being sealed.
[time=2425] Listen, here's how it would work.
[time=2427] When the integrity of a document had to be protected, when this letter or this edict or this judgment had to get to here,
[time=2438] when it had to go from Thessalonica all the way over here to Ephesus.
[time=2442] Well, the tribunal or the governor or whoever here, because he just absolutely, no questions asked.
[time=2449] The integrity of this edict or document had to be protected.
[time=2453] It had to get there, he would seal it, and he would give it to the guards and they would carry it,
[time=2459] and that seal, that seal of the governor was the sign that it was not to be opened.
[time=2463] It was not to be tampered with.
[time=2465] It was not to be altered, sealed.
[time=2471] Don't mess with it.
[time=2473] Don't fool with it.
[time=2475] What is said here and delivered here, done, sealed.
[time=2481] It brought with it the idea of security and preservation.
[time=2489] That document was going to be secure and preserved.
[time=2496] We went Friday as a family to Chicago.
[time=2500] What a great time.
[time=2501] One of our favorite babysitters of all time got married.
[time=2505] She's been with us for about four years.
[time=2507] Her big day was yesterday in one of the suburbs.
[time=2510] We went up Friday.
[time=2512] The kids had never been downtown.
[time=2515] My wife had never been downtown.
[time=2518] Now I'm thinking I shouldn't have taken her, but that's another story.
[time=2524] We decided it would be a lot of fun to go downtown Chicago.
[time=2529] I had been several times.
[time=2530] I thoroughly enjoy it.
[time=2532] Get a hotel room and go to the wedding the next day on Saturday and so forth.
[time=2537] The kids are so fired up.
[time=2538] We're driving over and we get down to downtown.
[time=2541] It's just kind of late afternoon.
[time=2543] It's Friday and the place is packed.
[time=2546] We get off on Ohio and we head down to Michigan and they're at the windows.
[time=2550] Just looking out.
[time=2551] My kids have never seen anything bigger than one summit square.
[time=2554] Except my son Russell who's been to New York on a missions trip.
[time=2557] He's seen the big daddies, the big kahunas of all buildings.
[time=2561] But he's still amazed.
[time=2562] They just can't believe it.
[time=2564] They're so excited.
[time=2565] We get into the parking garage.
[time=2566] We pass over to Michigan, turn into the parking garage there, get out.
[time=2569] They take the car up and park it and I pull us together.
[time=2573] Because I know we're about to have a lot of fun, but I also know we're about to walk on a street with about 10,000 people.
[time=2579] And there's like, you know, an army of us.
[time=2581] And I don't want to lose anybody.
[time=2584] And so I'm trying to do it in a way that's not like scared and frightened, but I'm also just, I mean, I'm trying to, you know, do what needs to be done.
[time=2590] So I do this.
[time=2593] Maddie and Wesley hold hands.
[time=2595] And Maddie and Wesley, they love holding hands.
[time=2597] They'd hold hands if you didn't tell them to hold hands.
[time=2599] They just, they're going to be good.
[time=2600] Maddie and Wesley, they're going to hold hands.
[time=2601] So Maddie and Wesley held hands.
[time=2603] And I said, where's Abby?
[time=2604] Abby, come here.
[time=2605] I'm going to hold on to Abby.
[time=2606] So I'm going to hold Abby.
[time=2608] And then I said to my oldest son, Russell, hold Jake's hand.
[time=2616] And see, there's a reason I did that.
[time=2619] Because yeah, Jake can tend to get going.
[time=2621] Jake can tend to get out ahead.
[time=2623] Jake can tend to scatter.
[time=2625] I mean, Jake could just be one minute, just gone.
[time=2626] Jake could be at the lake by the time we knew.
[time=2629] I mean, but you know what I knew?
[time=2633] I know how my oldest son feels about his little brother.
[time=2638] And I said to him, hold his hand.
[time=2641] And I knew that when I said that to Russell T, that five hours later, when we made our way back to the Yukon, Jake's hand would be brilliant.
[time=2648] Jake's hand would be bruised.
[time=2651] I knew the blood would have been cut off.
[time=2654] His hand would be sweaty.
[time=2656] I knew that four, five, six times then it happened.
[time=2658] During the excursion, Jake would be crying, Dad, don't Russell let go of my hand.
[time=2664] But you know what?
[time=2665] I wasn't going to do it.
[time=2667] Because I know how he feels about his little brother.
[time=2670] Sealed.
[time=2673] Secure and preserved.
[time=2677] He worried a little bit, but not much.
[time=2679] And man, we had a blast.
[time=2680] I'm telling you, it was so much fun to see the seven of us.
[time=2683] Kevin didn't get to hold anybody's hand.
[time=2684] I said, maybe we should have another kid.
[time=2686] She said, no.
[time=2688] So you don't get to hold anybody's hand.
[time=2692] But what a picture.
[time=2695] Does that make sense to you?
[time=2697] People, that's your future.
[time=2700] It's sealed.
[time=2703] And that's an amazing thought.
[time=2705] You know what?
[time=2706] A future found in him is a perfect future.
[time=2709] Write that down.
[time=2710] It is a perfect future.
[time=2713] There's this amazing spiritual truth that tells us that we will arrive at our future.
[time=2719] Not only will we be in our future, in our spiritual home, not only will we be perfect,
[time=2725] but there's this kind of this cool thing where we get brought to it in the end.
[time=2730] Perfect.
[time=2731] We're never perfect here.
[time=2732] But Philippians 1, 6 is an amazing truth, because it says in Philippians 1, 6, 4, I am Paul,
[time=2739] says I am confident, church at Philippi.
[time=2742] He writes to them to remind them of this.
[time=2744] He says I am confident of this very thing that he who began a good work in you, the point
[time=2751] of full surrender, that he who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of
[time=2758] Christ Jesus people.
[time=2759] He will keep working on you.
[time=2763] He will keep confronting you in your sin.
[time=2765] He will keep challenging you with new areas of growth.
[time=2768] He will not let you go.
[time=2770] You are sealed.
[time=2771] And he is going to until the day of the Lord keep you in his hand and work you.
[time=2776] Chisel away at you.
[time=2779] Hold you up.
[time=2780] Teach you.
[time=2781] Strengthen you.
[time=2782] Anybody thankful for that?
[time=2787] And I am so very thankful.
[time=2789] You know what I think I get more and more thankful the older I get, because the older I get, and the more bad decisions I continue to make, I am so grateful that he is committed
[time=2804] to holding onto me and keep chipping away at me and keep working on me, perfecting me.
[time=2813] What's that word mean so that you are not confused?
[time=2815] It means he is going to sanctify you.
[time=2817] He is going to slowly but surely make you more like Christ.
[time=2820] And that is a painful experience at times, but in the end, at the end of the day a joyous truth.
[time=2828] A future found in him is a sealed future, secure and preserved.
[time=2833] It is a perfect future.
[time=2835] Every blemish is made clear in time.
[time=2838] Every rough edge made smooth.
[time=2840] Every crack re-fortified and strengthened, and it never stops.
[time=2845] One of the most encouraging things in the everyday of my life, ministry and personal, is to bump into and be friends with 60-year-old, 64-year-old people, 55 and overs.
[time=2857] I know a bunch of them, and it is so amazing to me to know some 55 and overs who say to
[time=2863] me on a regular basis, "I'm still learning." Boy, I really messed up last week.
[time=2871] I'm still growing.
[time=2873] He's not done with me yet.
[time=2875] Man, if you're a 55 and over in this place, know how thankful we are for those of you
[time=2881] who are willing to live with that kind of authenticity, with that kind of hope and with
[time=2887] that kind of strength.
[time=2890] You know what else it is?
[time=2891] A future found in him is a safe future.
[time=2894] Write that down.
[time=2895] That might sound synonymous with secure.
[time=2897] It is.
[time=2898] But there's something here I just want you to see and something I want you to be reminded of today.
[time=2902] So Romans, turn to Romans chapter 8, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, Romans, go to Romans
[time=2909] chapter 8, says in Romans chapter 8, we're going to pick it up in verse 31.
[time=2916] Listen to this.
[time=2917] Be reminded of this today.
[time=2919] Hey on to this truth today.
[time=2921] Romans 8, 31, it says there, "What then shall we say to these things?
[time=2927] If God is for us, who is against us?" I mean, think about that just for a moment.
[time=2934] Because if you know him today, that's true, God is for you.
[time=2940] He's on your side.
[time=2942] God, the God of the universe, the God of all mankind, is for you.
[time=2950] Now there's a little support for you.
[time=2953] There's a little pat on the back, huh?
[time=2957] If God is for us, who is against us?
[time=2960] He who did not spare his own son, he was so for you.
[time=2966] He's so on your side.
[time=2968] He didn't spare his own son, but delivered him over, his son, for us all.
[time=2972] How?
[time=2973] If he's going to do that, how will he not also with him freely give us all things?
[time=2979] Look at verse 38, "For I am convinced that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities
[time=2990] nor things present nor things to come nor powers nor height nor depth nor any other created
[time=2997] thing will be able to separate us, will ever be able to separate us from the love of God
[time=3003] which is in Christ Jesus, our Lord, amen."
[time=3010] Who's going to come snatch you away, nobody?
[time=3017] You know, I'll talk to a young person, you know, I'll talk to one of my kids or I'll bump into, you know, an elementary age, you know, little one trying to make his or her way and they'll tell me, Pastor Bird, I've accepted Christ 28 times and I'll kind of do
[time=3032] what you just did, you know.
[time=3035] They'll get it, they'll understand it in time.
[time=3040] It breaks my heart when I hear a 50-year-old say that and they don't usually say it with
[time=3048] a smile on their face.
[time=3050] They usually say it through tears of despair and frustration and it breaks my heart that
[time=3056] somewhere they didn't learn the truth, that once you are his, you are his, sealed and
[time=3065] safe, protected, nothing, and there's nothing you can do and there's nowhere you can go
[time=3074] and there's no road you can walk down that's going to make him look at you and see what
[time=3080] you've done or take in what you've given yourself to and say, "You know what, that's it.
[time=3086] I'm done with you." See God doesn't bail on the redemption thing, on the regeneration thing, on the family of
[time=3097] God thing, on the precious child of God.
[time=3100] I gave my son for you, you believed, you submitted your heart to me, you are mine.
[time=3105] See, he doesn't go back on that.
[time=3108] Your future, it's safe.
[time=3113] You're found in him, it's sealed, it's perfect, it's safe.
[time=3117] Let's do one more here.
[time=3119] You know this is an important one for you and I to consider in these days.
[time=3124] People are future and him is a heavenly future, not an earthly one.
[time=3130] It is a heavenly future, Hebrews 11.
[time=3133] We've looked at this many times in the past, I want you to see it again this morning because I can't think of a better picture, a better example of one who evidenced for you and I, and it means what it looks like to live today with heaven in view.
[time=3146] Hebrews 11.8, "By faith, Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place
[time=3153] which he was to receive foreign inheritance, and he went out not knowing where he was going.
[time=3160] God said, "Follow me," God said, "I'm going to give you a land." God says the same thing to you and I, different words, same thought, same concept.
[time=3168] He says to you and I, "Follow me." You and I don't always know where he's going to take us, do we?
[time=3175] We don't always know what that road is going to look like.
[time=3179] This life of following Christ, this living out of the Christian faith, he says, "Come, come after me.
[time=3185] Come on, you follow me." And you and I say, "What?" I want to, sometimes we say, "I really, really want to," but you see, if I go there, then
[time=3203] I kind of got to let go of this and I'm really, really enjoying this.
[time=3212] Keep going.
[time=3214] By faith, he lived as a what?
[time=3216] What's the word?
[time=3217] Say it.
[time=3218] Alien.
[time=3219] He lived here as a stranger, right?
[time=3222] By faith, he lived as an alien in the land of promise.
[time=3225] As in a foreign land, dwelling in tents, keyword there, one of the most important words in
[time=3231] this entire passage because of what it communicates, and I don't want you to picture the actual tents, I want you to picture what it says about the guy who would live in one.
[time=3243] This place was not his home.
[time=3246] He had lost his fascination with all the stuff.
[time=3250] You see that?
[time=3253] As in a foreign land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs of the same promise, for he was looking for the city which has foundations whose architect and builder
[time=3264] is God, a city who has the city which has foundations.
[time=3270] He was looking for, he was mindful of, he was given to a future that included one city,
[time=3277] it's called what?
[time=3280] Heaven.
[time=3281] See, when you've really submitted and given him your heart and life, when you are genuinely following Christ, you become much more cognitive of your home, not your brick and mortar and
[time=3293] not your square footage, not what you drive or your next vacation destination.
[time=3298] See, it just, it just, it loses its luster.
[time=3304] It's just not a big deal.
[time=3307] Guess what becomes a big deal to the one who is heavenly minded?
[time=3313] Guess what becomes a big deal to the one who has placed their hope and their future in him?
[time=3319] You know what becomes a big deal to those people?
[time=3323] People.
[time=3325] People become a big deal.
[time=3326] Ministry becomes a big deal.
[time=3330] Eternity becomes a big deal and you can take a little test, you know, you can take a little
[time=3336] quiz.
[time=3337] It's just one, there's many I could give you.
[time=3339] What impresses you?
[time=3341] Now just be honest, what impresses you?
[time=3347] I mean what really revs your jets, what makes you step back and go, wow, now that's amazing.
[time=3356] I'd like a little bit more of that.
[time=3358] I mean what do you really, really want?
[time=3364] I mean what really motivates you I guess is what we're asking.
[time=3370] That one trip you haven't made yet, that certain size, house, that certain car, that
[time=3378] certain accomplishment, those are options.
[time=3384] Or if you come all the way over to the other side of the, other side of the playing field, could it possibly be?
[time=3390] I mean what really revs your jets and what really, really rests at the bottom of your
[time=3397] motivation?
[time=3398] Might it be that a friend of yours might come to faith in Christ?
[time=3413] And I got to ask you this morning, do you have a friend who hasn't?
[time=3420] Come to faith in Christ?
[time=3421] I know a lot of you do.
[time=3424] And I hope as you think about your future, and I hope as you think about your life today,
[time=3430] I hope you're willing to, having surrendered your heart and life to Him, live each day in the reality of a future found in Him, sealed, perfect, safe, and heavenly in nature.
[time=3445] What a gift He's given you.
[time=3448] There may be somebody here this morning, and in the honesty of your heart today, you may
[time=3454] sit here and say to me, "You know what, Kelly?
[time=3457] You have no idea how inviting that sounds.
[time=3462] You have no idea of this journey that I have been on, and you may be here today, and you may have been asking a lot of spiritual questions in recent weeks or months, and I just want to tell you, today you can clear this up.
[time=3475] You can have a future secured.
[time=3476] Come talk to us.
[time=3478] Come let us encourage you.
[time=3480] Talk to the person who brought you.
[time=3482] Talk to the friend who you trust, but you don't want to let this future issue.
[time=3487] You don't want to let that one go.
[time=3490] Would you stay in and let's pray?
[time=3492] We're a little late, so make sure you get on and get those kids.
[time=3494] Father, thank you so very much for the privilege this morning of not only being together, but being again exposed to your Word, and it's great, great truth.
[time=3503] God I pray that if there are those in the room this morning who need help understanding and clarifying their spiritual future, God that they would ask and give us the privilege of doing so.
[time=3513] God for those who know you, I pray you would strengthen us, God that you would envision us for a way of life that evidences not only our confidence and our future, but God our
[time=3523] gratitude for it.
[time=3527] God we pray that you would watch over us, continue to teach us in the hours and the days to come.
[time=3532] Bring us back together again.
[time=3533] God if that be your will, and we'll thank you for it in your son's name.
[time=3536] [AMEN]
[time=3547] Thank you.
[time=3577] a lot of you.
