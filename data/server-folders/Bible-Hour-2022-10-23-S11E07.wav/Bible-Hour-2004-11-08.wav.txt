[time=30] (dramatic music) (upbeat music)
[time=60] (upbeat music) - Hi, I'm Kelly Bird and I have the privilege
[time=87] of serving as the senior pastor here at Black Hawk Ministries and we are so thankful that you've tuned in to the Bible Hour.
[time=94] I wanna tell you that over the last couple of weeks I've had the opportunity to talk to a number of people, three interactions come to mind today that I wanted to share with you.
[time=104] And I've shared stuff like this with you in the past, but just every once in a while I feel like I hear enough and I hear it again and again and I just, I gotta tell you and I wanna share it with you because I think that there are some of you out there who maybe need to hear it.
[time=120] I was at a reception this last weekend for some friends and I met a couple, one of the most gracious, kindest couples I've interacted with in a long time and an older couple who came up to me, introduced themselves to me, let them know that, let me know that they were now a part of our church that they had been coming to Black Hawk since the four week Passion of the Christ series which culminated on Easter.
[time=147] And they wanted me to know how much that meant to them and how welcomed they felt, how much a part of this place they were beginning to feel, how they had hardly missed a Sunday sense and they wanted me to know that after 30 some years in another place they finally felt like they had come to a place that was home where the Bible was taught, where their hearts were encouraged and they wanted me to know that prior to coming they used to watch the Bible hour.
[time=176] And I hear that again and again and again, I met a gal Sunday by herself, waited around while I talked to some other people.
[time=183] I finally got a chance to say hello to her and she just let me know that she was going through a really hard time in her life.
[time=190] Some things were happening that were very, very confusing that she had been a Christ follower, she said, that she had been a Christ follower for maybe six months that that had happened at Black Hawk and that prior to coming she had spent several months just watching each and every Sunday morning right here on the Bible hour.
[time=210] I was at a lunch on Sunday.
[time=213] We have a monthly lunch for people new to Black Hawk.
[time=216] It is so encouraging to go around to the tables and talk to family after family, individual after individual, all of them somewhat new to our family at Black Hawk and talk to two families this last Sunday who had been around for about three, four, five months and both of them had come because after watching the Bible hour for a number of months they finally felt like, you know what?
[time=239] We should just go and check it out.
[time=242] And so I know you're out there and I know many of you who watch have church homes and I've told you before, we're very thankful for that and don't want that to change but there are a number of you, a lot of you I think, who don't have a church home and I want you to know that we would count an absolute privilege to get to spend that kind of time with you, to meet you and to be able to share with you not only the ministry there on Sunday but this incredible family as well.
[time=270] I'm so hopeful that you'll open your heart to what God is doing and maybe He'll lead you here and in leading you here further your journey toward faith.
[time=280] You know what, coming up in the next couple of weeks around here, it is a very, very big and exciting time at Black Hawk.
[time=287] Many people's journey toward faith can be traced back to His work in their heart and life around the Christmas time, around the Christmas message really and we have the privilege of hosting and putting on for you the community of Fort Wayne for the 28th year, our annual celebration of Christmas.
[time=307] We would love for you to come and be a part of Christmas with Black Hawk.

[time=347] We hope to see you soon.
[time=348] [MUSIC - 212 seconds]
[time=568] We are not ashamed. We are not ashamed. We are not ashamed of the gospel, of the gospel of Jesus. Jesus is my life. So will we have, oh we have everlasting everlasting life.
[time=568] [REPETITIVE CONTENT - 78 seconds] We are not ashamed. We are not ashamed. We are not ashamed of the gospel, of the gospel of Jesus. Je...
[time=676] What a powerful song, we are not ashamed, that's a great reminder to you students here today it's a great reminder to you adults as well we should never ever ever be ashamed of what we believe never be ashamed for the stands that you take never be ashamed of the convictions that you have and it's interesting the last couple of weeks listening to the to the pundits and the spinners you'd think we should be ashamed.
[time=706] For having values and morals vote in our next president and what an amazing thing it was to see across this land of ours people voting their values and people voting their convictions and as we mentioned the Sunday before the election we leave all that in God's hand.
[time=726] But what an encouraging thing to see that truth and that which matters still really does matter in the hearts and lives of so many so to those of you that we're willing to go and vote your values well done.
[time=742] I want to encourage you to write this down first Timothy two one and two just write this down as our president George W. Bush begins a second term it's important I think many of you already do this but let me encourage you the rest of you that maybe haven't done this as a practice you need to I think each and every day pray for him to pray for him to pray for those who lead with him they lead us today in a world that is absolutely
[time=770] incredible of confusion and issues things that are demanding of them unbelievable amount of an unbelievable amount of wisdom and insight so first Timothy two one says first of all then I urge that in treaties and prayers petitions and thanksgivings be made on behalf of all men for kings and all who are in authority.
[time=792] Why so that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity.
[time=798] And so do that would you remember him specifically and remember those that work with him as they give leadership to this great nation of ours.
[time=807] And hey speaking of this great nation of ours Thursday was a very special day it was Veterans Day and it gave us an opportunity to celebrate and be so very thankful for those who have given so much many thousands of them as you know have given their lives so that we
[time=823] can enjoy the enduring freedom that we have today and so we didn't want to let this morning go by without saying thanks as well so if you're here this morning and have served or are serving or are the relative of one who has passed who did serve in our armed forces would you just stand and allow
[time=840] us the privilege of thanking you for that service and that dedication awesome thank you so very much.
[time=857] Hi man thanks for all that you have done and thank you so very much for serving in the way that you've served.
[time=868] Well hey just a couple of things before we jump in this morning I want to make sure that you're aware of the fact that if you're in the college age range 18 to 24 we are so thankful for what God is doing in that arena here at Black Hawk
[time=885] there is a new ministry called encounter for those in that college age you may be going to school you may be going to work you may be doing a little school and a little work but Sunday nights at seven o'clock encounter is exploring truth through
[time=900] lively discussion and fun interaction at the home of our college pastor Dave Walters the information is in your bulletin you can look down there under college age encounter and find out his direction his address and his phone number call.
[time=914] If you need any help also want to just remind you that coming up on Friday night December 3rd is our annual premier dinner our Christmas with Black Hawk season begins with a wonderful event that each year goes to support and further the ministry of our school it's called our premier dinner
[time=934] and you may want to be a part of that night it's an opportunity for you to financially contribute to what God is doing in the school while at the same time enjoying a fantastic evening not only at the dinner but then going to the premier concert as well so if you want to find out more about the premier
[time=951] dinner make sure you call Steve wild who is in charge of development and also the athletic director at our school Steve's extension is four four zero and you can get ticket information and talk to him about possibly attending the premier dinner Friday night December 3rd
[time=968] hey be be encouraged today I just found this out late last week we have almost 75 people today meeting after second hour at what we call our welcome to Black Hawk lunch it's for just new people who have either been through access Black Hawk who people who have turned in a visitor card and said we want to know more about what's going on they've they've responded to an invitation to come and share a meal together almost 75 folks coming today
[time=994] to have lunch with us and that's yeah that's worthy of a praise God and thank you especially to those on our assimilation team who do such a great great job
[time=1006] well last week in the eighth and final installment of our series from the book of Proverbs we talked about our spiritual futures how those fully surrendered to Christ those who have given their hearts and lives to him as Savior and Lord have a heavenly safe perfect sealed and secure eternity to look forward to
[time=1032] We talked about how if you know the Lord not just know about the Lord but if you know him personally we were reminded that there is secure and safe for you an eternal life with him
[time=1049] We talked about our spiritual futures we were reminded that one future day maybe even soon this all of this not only this building that we sit in this morning
[time=1061] but this world that we live in it will all be gone there will be a day when it will all go away
[time=1073] this world will come to an end Christ will return to rule and in time take his people home
[time=1080] and what I want you to see today what I want you what I want to teach you today if I can is that any spiritual discussion or spiritual truth regarding our spiritual future
[time=1091] whenever you find yourself whenever you find us talking about or teaching about or reading about our spiritual futures there is always inherent in that discussion
[time=1103] and usually immediately following that discussion in the text whenever you're talking about your spiritual future there is always great implication on your spiritual today if you will
[time=1120] spiritual future brings great implication and consideration for your and I spiritual reality the way you and I would live our lives today the fact that my future in heaven is secured should move me to live more faithfully here on earth
[time=1140] the idea of our heavenly reality then should compel us to a holy living today it should it's the way it should pan out you see future glory should prompt faithful living
[time=1159] all that has been provided all that has been promised all that has been secured should compel you and I to a kind of living and a kind of thinking and a kind of choosing
[time=1170] that would evidence growing faithfulness and a growing commitment to holiness and a growing desire to be the people he's called us to be
[time=1181] but you see talk of the future and all that has been provided for some you see this is provided a place where they kind of step off and really begin to go in a tragic direction this is where some have made an enormous and deadly mistake
[time=1199] some have chosen to view God's provision of a future as a free pass to godless living today they really have I've met them I've talked with them I've seen them you've seen them you may be have struggled with this yourself see having come here's how it works having come to a certain level of understanding
[time=1223] having comprehended cognitively the truth of salvation and eternal life they've they've nodded their heads right they've nodded their heads toward following Christ but have never bowed or surrendered their hearts
[time=1242] to him and there's a difference there's a real difference they've nodded their heads toward faith but have never bowed their will the total of their life to him they've chosen to live in and I use my words carefully here they've chosen to live in patterns of sin and willful rebellion
[time=1266] they've spurned the confession of sin and repentance and have banked on salvation without surrender and here lies the deadly danger and let me just wrap up the deadly danger here in a phrase for you
[time=1283] because what happens when you start to do that is you presume upon the grace of God and people you don't want to do that you don't want to ever presume upon the grace of God
[time=1300] it's thinking that kind of goes like this I can and I've heard it before I can mentally think this they think I can mentally accept the gospel it's almost as if they're playing games I can mentally accept the gospel
[time=1315] and the salvation or future that comes with it but then at the heart level intentionally and progressively and habitually and heartheartedly live sinfully
[time=1328] I can in essence do whatever I want I can live however I might choose to live knowing that because I nodded my head
[time=1340] I might have prayed a prayer I might have walked an aisle I'm I nodded my head see it's a scary proposition because it says in James even the demons what even the demons believe
[time=1353] demons nod their heads because they know certain things to be true but what about this what about this
[time=1366] with real fear and trepidation and I mean that with a real sense of caution and awe I'll invite you to turn to a passage in Hebrews
[time=1374] go back to Hebrews I want you to just turn your Bibles to Hebrews chapter 10 because in Hebrews chapter 10 verses 26 to 31 we see the author of Hebrews dealing with this exact principle
[time=1389] and he brings he brings unbelievable clarity to this challenge that some have brought upon themselves look at Hebrews 10 verse 26
[time=1408] says in Hebrews 10 verse 26 in honor of God's word I'll ask you to stand with me this morning quietly as we read this says in Hebrews 10 26 to 31 for if we go on sinning willfully
[time=1423] after receiving the knowledge of the truth there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins but a terrifying expectation of judgment and the fury of a fire which will consume the adversaries
[time=1440] anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses how much severe punishment do you think he will deserve who has trampled underfoot the fulfillment of that law
[time=1456] see back in Deuteronomy 17 when someone would be guilty of idolatry when someone would serve a different God when someone would go down a different path and blaspheme the name of God on the witness of two or three that person would be put to death
[time=1474] because God cared a great deal about how his name was handled God cared a great deal about how worship was offered and under the law back in the day anyone who set aside the law of Moses dies without mercy
[time=1493] how much severe punishment verse 29 do you think he will deserve who has trampled underfoot the fulfillment of that law the Son of God and has regarded as unclean the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified and has insulted the spirit of grace
[time=1512] for we know him who said vengeance is mine I will repay and again the Lord will judge his people it is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God
[time=1526] Father God we come before you this morning having been reminded recently about our our future an amazing glorious wonderful future and God we have at the same time been reminded that that is a future reserved for those that know you
[time=1546] really God those who have surrendered their hearts and lives to you completely and so Father God as we study this morning as we look to your word and as we are challenged in our own hearts to consider the kind of commitment that we have made or not yet made
[time=1565] God I pray that your spirit and your word would transform us convict us and encourage us do whatever you might need to do God to grow us toward a relationship with you or God to grow us further in our relationship
[time=1582] and understanding of you we ask it in your son's name amen you can be seated very important phrase there in Hebrews 1026 for us to look at this morning very important for me to explain to you it's intent and what it means
[time=1598] because you are I could read 1026 and go wait a minute for if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth you go well wait a minute what sin isn't willful
[time=1612] you know you and I might want to kind of say I willfully sin I mean I make the choice I willfully sin each and every day so what am I in trouble here well you have to understand the context you have to understand
[time=1626] the actual meaning of that word the Greek word for sinning willfully carries the idea of deliberate intentional repeated and hard key phrase here hard hearted sin
[time=1644] where it says for if we go on sinning willfully that's describing a deliberate intentional repeated hard hearted act of sin that progressively and intentionally and habitually just gets worse and worse and worse and there is no remorse
[time=1660] and if you and if you do that it says in 1026 go on sinning willfully like that after receiving the knowledge again this ability to kind of mentally grasp it or say okay I get it
[time=1675] the heart isn't engaged there's trouble this kind of sin it rejects Christ and his lordship by its very activity what do I mean by that well what I mean by that is this a true believer
[time=1691] somebody who genuinely has given their heart and soul to Christ that is not descriptive of their journey through life you would not look at a true believer someone who has genuinely given his or her heart in life to Christ
[time=1705] and see deliberate intentional repeated hard hearted patterns of sin
[time=1712] now if I had a whiteboard I would draw it for you but I think maybe the gals were able to put it up on the screens were we able to do that yay or nay yep
[time=1721] they are amazing okay look at that you see that that is that is the life pattern you know what that's my life pattern right there
[time=1732] I have 20 I fully surrendered my heart and life to Christ that's the dot there the big dot and as I and as I did that and embarked upon this journey it has been a steady progression toward north east
[time=1747] you with me it's moving up to the top right I mean I'm getting there but the journey there has been full of deliberate willful choices at times
[time=1758] but see here's the point when the spirit of God resides in the heart of the fully surrendered and the sinful choices made
[time=1765] see the spirit of God convicts there becomes this welling up of godly sorrow in my heart and remorse over what I've done and I confess that sin and I move in a new direction
[time=1777] and I move in that new direction for a time and then boom something else comes up or something repeated comes up and I might fall again
[time=1785] I might find myself down feeling like I'm at the bottom of the deal going gee how can I be here again but the spirit of God moves and the word of God does it's convicting work and I seek forgiveness
[time=1796] and I move away from the sin I don't stay in a deliberate intentional hard-hearted pattern of sin the child of God can't do that
[time=1808] and yours you know it's just kind of a rough sketch there but do you get the idea? That's the heart of one who truly believes
[time=1816] now I mean if we just kind of threw up the opposite what you have to realize today is that though there might be a dot go ahead and show the next one
[time=1823] though there might be a dot there may have been a point in someone's life where they heard the gospel presented
[time=1830] they heard the truth explained and they may have gone okay well that makes sense but don't forget the demons say that
[time=1837] and if the pattern of their life is one of southeast progressive repeated habitual hard-hearted patterns of sin with no remorse
[time=1851] and no regret no confession no repentance then we have a problem then we have a problem and you can't be on that track
[time=1863] and somehow in the midst of that with a presumptuous heart be banking on some kind of future bliss
[time=1876] so very important that you understand that the future that has been secured the future that has been sealed
[time=1885] the future that is heavenly all that we talked about last week is for those who have fully committed and given their hearts and lives to him
[time=1894] so my future shouldn't lead to presumptuous living it should compel and motivate me to holy living to God honoring living
[time=1905] let's look at a couple of examples what do you say of this I want to show you this principle at work in the scriptures and here's a phrase for you to write down
[time=1915] as we start just kind of capitalizing all that we've just said future truth should be prompting and moving us toward a more meaningful obedient today
[time=1924] write that down future truth any truth any discussion about what God has provided you and I in the future should be prompting and moving us toward a more meaningful
[time=1934] obedient today and it's amazing you guys how in scripture anytime you come across a passage that talks specifically about what is to come
[time=1944] I saw it again this week anytime and I'm going to show you a few of them anytime in the scriptures you find a passage that deals specifically
[time=1952] with all that is going to happen to this earth with all that we're going to experience in glory with him
[time=1958] passages that talk about the second coming passages that talk about the resurrection body almost in each and every example of that almost without exception
[time=1969] in the immediate context following that passage there's talk about the way we should live today now that's a reality future truth should be prompting
[time=1984] and moving us toward a more meaningful obedient today here's one for you second Peter chapter three turn there if you would
[time=1991] go back to second Peter on past Hebrews back toward the back of your New Testament just before you get to first John you'll find second Peter chapter three
[time=2000] second Peter chapter three verses eight through the first part of fifteen let me read this for you here we have a passage absolutely packed
[time=2011] with truth and principles and realities regarding the future and then watch what it says second Peter three verse eight but do not let this one fact escape your notice
[time=2026] beloved that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years and a thousand years like one day the Lord is not slow about his promise as some count slowness
[time=2037] but is patient toward you not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance but the day of the Lord will come like a thief the day of the Lord the second coming of Christ it says that day will come like a thief
[time=2053] hey people how does a thief come announced or unannounced unannounced it says in verse ten but the day of the Lord this amazing day dreadful day for some glorious day for others but the day of the Lord will come like a thief
[time=2069] in which the heavens will pass away with a roar and the elements will be destroyed with intense heat and the earth and its works will be burned up all of it
[time=2081] look at verse eleven since all these things are to be destroyed in this way what sort of people ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness
[time=2095] kind of goes back toward the future he went future in the first few verses then verse eleven brings us back to the present now he goes back to the future looking for and hastening the coming of the day of god because of which because of which the
[time=2110] heavens will be destroyed by burning and the elements will melt with intense heat but according to his promise we are looking for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells
[time=2121] therefore here you go therefore beloved since you look for these things be diligent work so very hard that word diligent means give yourself completely physically and emotionally work to be found by him in peace
[time=2138] spotless and blameless and the first part of fifteen and regard people regard the patience of our Lord as salvation or better translated as an opportunity for the salvation of others
[time=2157] verses 8 to 13 gives us a clear and powerful picture of what is to come it describes certain factual information about what is going to happen in the what say it in the future the unbeliever the unrepentant will perish
[time=2173] the second coming will transpire unannounced the earth will be destroyed with a roar and with fire and it says there in verse eleven since all of this is going to happen what sort of people ought you and I to be
[time=2189] it's specifically answered in verse fourteen first part of fifteen I want to show you three things we are to be a people that while we wait he says be at peace while we're waiting for all of this to transpire and it will he says be at peace
[time=2207] be pure spotless and blameless he says be pure and then he says in the first part of fifteen be be purposeful remember there's a reason he is prolonging this
[time=2221] let's look at that first one can we for a few moments this morning be at peace God's word says to you and I as we anticipate all of this happening in the future in the present we are to be a people who are at peace
[time=2235] this piece here has more to do with an internal peace though it would include a relational harmony know today that this describes an internal peace while waiting for the future where to live today in the peace of Christ
[time=2250] which knows no worry which knows no fear which knows no panic which knows no doubt regarding this life or his coming judgment be found by him in peace
[time=2266] you see saved secure sanctified sealed Christ followers in God's design are not to live in panic fear trouble or speculation Philippians four six and seven gives us great insight you can turn there I believe it'll be on the screen for you as well Paul in his letter to the folks that Philippi speaks to this very issue
[time=2290] Paul knew there were people in Philippi just like I know there are people in this room who battle with this thing called anxiety who struggle with this this thing called worry who sometimes stay up late at night or or can't even get to sleep because so many doubts
[time=2309] and frustrations and panic is is flooding their minds see Paul knew that this was a a strategy of the enemy to rob you and I of the joy and the peace that God provides
[time=2324] and so he writes in Philippians four six and seven be anxious be anxious for nothing it's good to it's good to define anxious just so we're all on the same page it's the unsettled soul
[time=2338] it's the unsettled soul it's a soul that is scared that is a soul that is scared by the worry fear and doubt of some future uncertainty it is the unsettled soul a scared soul scared by worry fear and doubt of some future uncertainty
[time=2359] he says be anxious for nothing some of you in the room this morning might be reading this verse for the first time and you're looking at me going you got to be kidding me the Bible really says that they have the Bible really says that
[time=2373] it really is what God has for you and I to be anxious for nothing but here you go but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving make your requests bring your worries bring your fears bring your doubts bring your panic
[time=2391] bring your unsettled soul he says to me whatever it might be whoever it may entail make your requests known to God very important that you understand that concept of making your requests known to God it is a it is an absolute and complete giving over of all of it
[time=2413] every question every bit of worry every nuance every angle every thought all of it you're backing up the truck and you're dumping it all on him you're getting out of room and you're hopping in the bed of the truck and you're sweeping out every single corner
[time=2434] it's all given over to him make your requests known to God and the peace of God and the peace of God which surpasses all comprehension will will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus
[time=2454] the peace of God you do that and God's word and God's word says that the peace of God will the peace of God that will absolutely blow your mind will guard your heart and your lives because you are how does the verse end in Christ Jesus
[time=2473] now I bump into folks often who want to tell me that this verse isn't true and as we engage in the conversation you see here's how it goes they'll say you know I tried the Philippians 4 6 and 7 thing it didn't fly doesn't work I say really tell me about that
[time=2490] well they'll say you know what you know I brought my situation to him I brought my fear I brought my concern I brought my worry to him and I'm still worrying
[time=2506] see it's amazing that we take this and we think that I understand it because I've done it we in our humanness we think if I pray the prayer then the cancer will go away
[time=2519] see if I pray the prayer then my 15 year old will stop making me so nervous by doing that's not what it says it's not what it says it doesn't say that outcomes get changed it doesn't say that circumstances get all it says the peace of God will guard your heart
[time=2539] do you understand that's something we have to really work to kind of get our spiritual arms around but you got to work at that you got to give yourself to that right there and I say to those people you know what you're wrong it does work
[time=2554] it doesn't sound very scholarly I know I just say no it's not that's not true it does work see when you really see I'm a little nervous about my mom going to Kabul most of you know that some of you maybe don't my mom's going next week to be a missionary for a year in Afghanistan
[time=2573] I'm a little anxious all right so I'm praying and you know what I'm doing I'm praying and I'm supplicating and I'm giving thanks praying praying and this is if this helps fine I hope this helps because my mom's going to Kabul I don't know what your life entails
[time=2594] but if you've got any anxiousness if you've got any worry here's what God's word says pray meaning God your God here's me in my study at home last week here's me in the in the car recently God your God
[time=2608] and I'm not and you are an amazing God you are an awesome God and I am so grateful for you
[time=2617] and I confess again my sin and shortcoming I thank you again for your forgiveness and grace I pray I exalt God and having done that then I'll say to him in my own words I'll say now I've got to request supplication I want you to please watch over my mom
[time=2635] I'm anxious about what might happen to her I'm anxious about what she might encounter I don't want to see her on CNN
[time=2645] and then I thank him and I say having asked him to watch over my mom and having dumped that truck having backed that truck up and given him all of those thoughts I thank him for the way that he will deal and handle the way he will deal with that and handle that request
[time=2661] and then I say amen and I go back to my day and it is amazing how when I do that here's the other thing you got to learn see some folks say I tried that I say did you really
[time=2671] tell me about that well yeah it was like last month I did that once see I've done that with my mom and me and God in the last week and a half I've done it probably about 20 times
[time=2685] you say well how come you have to keep doing it see it doesn't work no no it does work
[time=2691] it says keep doing it it's in the present participle it's an ongoing continuous I'm going to continue to do that
[time=2700] and in doing that each and every time since more and more the presence of a loving God who's got his hand on my life and my mother's and the peace of God
[time=2712] which absolutely blows my mind guards my heart and my mind
[time=2722] you know what I was thinking about this week that's why it is so very important listen that is why it is so very important for you and I in the midst of whatever the circumstance might be
[time=2733] medical physical relational tension whatever the anxiousness is stemming from wherever the worry might be emanating from see it's why as you pray like that and give yourself to Philippians 4 6 and 7
[time=2746] it is so important to have a high and accurate view of God
[time=2754] I was reading again this week Romans eight thirty one Romans eight thirty one I know this is really simple but follow me here
[time=2763] Romans eight thirty one says this if God is for you
[time=2769] anybody finish that for me who can be what yeah it's a rhetorical deal if God is for that the understood truth there is that God is what
[time=2779] say it God is for who?
[time=2785] it's right say say it say God is for me you got some worries do you
[time=2797] you got some anxiousness going on and you're hard in life you got some tension brewing at home
[time=2804] you got some future uncertainty at work hey listen listen God the God of the universe God Almighty Jehovah God the mighty one the holy one the majestic one the forgiving one the one who is like no other people God is for you
[time=2827] we forget this sometimes sometimes people will say to me you know I wish I could be optimistic like you you're always you know you like smiling and everything's going to be okay your glass is half your glass isn't even half full
[time=2841] they say it's like it's like full it's like rolling over and you know what there might be some personality component there and I might be that kind of a person that's true but you know what I'm learning as life goes by I'm learning this I'm learning that analogy real quick switch here I'm learning that I've entered a two on two tournament I've entered a two on two basketball tournament the stakes are as high as it gets it's a fourth grade boys tournament and my partner is Shaquille O'Neal
[time=2873] are you with me? I mean I want you just to think about how ridiculous that would be can you just picture me and Shaquille against your fourth grade son and his buddy you know what?
[time=2889] I got no worries I'm going to win win I'm going to be okay God is for you and when you're willing to give him all of it again and again and again and then move away from that and choose and live allowing the peace of God to guard your heart and mind it is an amazing amazing thing while we wait he says be it peace secondly while we wait be pure right that down while we wait he wants to come back he wants to come back when all of this is ending and he returns he wants to come back and find that you and I have been spotless and blameless he wants us to be found pure you see it there in verse 14 and verse 14 it says spotless and blameless those phrases are best translated characterized by purity characterized by purity there's a younger one in our home who when this younger one gets disciplined over not telling the truth will often lay there on the bed just crying the eyes out going I'm a liar oh daddy I'm a liar and you know what this certain one isn't really
[time=2981] hear me not characterized does that make sense?
[time=2985] that characterized back to the deliberate patterns back to the graph which ways it going there he knows you and I aren't going to be spotless or blame less he knows that our pursuit of purity moral personal purity will not be a perfect one he is talking about here the pursuit and what you are characterized by he talked about it back in verse 11 since all these things are to be destroyed look at that since all of these things are to be destroyed in this way what sort of people ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness holy conduct separated from sin write that down holy conduct separated from sin this is talking about specifically in this context a moral purity as we see in verse 14 spotless and blameless separated from sin I love that phrase godliness write that down from verse 11 what sort of people ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness here you go here's the definition for you on godliness it is a spirit and attitude of reverence it is a spirit and attitude of reverence let me ask you a couple questions there what sort of people ought you to be in here you go holy conduct spotless blameless moral purity holy conduct and godliness let's go back to moral conduct let's go back to the pursuit of purity what is the single greatest enemy of personal purity today what is the single greatest enemy of personal purity the single greatest enemy of your pursuit or mind of holiness what do you think think about it this culture your world in mind today you and I sit here and say you know what I see the value I see the god honoring value of pursuing personal purity in my heart and life as a young man, as a young woman, as a parent, as a senior adult and in this culture what would you say is probably the enemy's greatest deterrent that he throws at you and I in this pursuit of personal purity anybody I asked a few people this week got a lot of different answers had several folks as I asked them that question kind of just come up with the major heading of entertainment entertainment if you push them a little bit on that what came up was movies television and www.you fill in the blank and you know as I thought about that I want to just instead of going to the negative I want us to say this when it comes to entertainment today movies television in the worldwide web you know what all of that all of that is on the rise you know that all of that is on the increase you know that all of that is worse than it's ever been you know that but let's not go there for a moment let's go the other way and let's just be reminded of what all of that has taken the place of all of that has taken the place of a thing called relationship building all of that has by and large taken the place of Candyland board games talking walking being together and you and I know the families in trouble you and I know that at times we're in trouble because to some degree we've gone toward entertainment in the midst of that had our personal pursuit of purity and holiness absolutely slaughtered or at least challenged and in the process have left an entire arena called relationship building in the lurch something to think about what's the single greatest enemy of godliness how did we define godliness remember it's a spirit of reverence if godliness people is reverence this kind of this healthy we talked about in Proverbs kind of this healthy being in awe of god this healthy view of god this utter and deep respect for god god being who he is and you and I being who we are what would you say is one of the greatest enemies of reverence as I thought about it as we talked about it several of us interesting what came up again and again and again we actually in the church we actually in the church have at times hurt this effort in an effort to make god cool in an effort to make god accessible to all we've reduced god at times to a buddy in an effort to make god approachable we've reduced god to
[time=3313] a dude we hang out with as somebody said it to me recently and see here's the tension with that you know what god is accessible god is approachable and you know what I believe god wants to be in relationship with you if you want to call that hanging out that's fine but see what we've done is we've at times we have lost the front end of that picture and the front end of that picture which makes that end of the picture even more amazing is the front end of the picture is that he is god and we need to teach a little bit more about him talk a little bit more about and read a little bit more about how amazing how other he is who was reading recently about a guy who had so developed a healthy sense of who god was that was the first time he was ever going to preach in this church he had just been called to and as he got up to step onto the stage the very first time he was ever going to preach without any forethought or planning he realized as he was walking up where he was walking to and what he was going to do and without any forethought or planning he took off his shoes he said and it was interesting as he wrote because he talked about realizing that he was that day and was going to be lord willing for many years having the privilege of standing on what felt to him like holy ground and you and I have to do our very best to not only in our own hearts and lives develop a healthy reverence and respect for him but teach that to others as well and when you grab and gain and maintain a healthy view of how unbelievable he is like face in the ground I am not worthy I mean that kind of amazing then the thought that he was walking through the garden wondering where Adam and Eve were because he wanted to be with them becomes even more amazing he really does want to be with you and he really is very approachable but we've got to make sure we maintain that mix that balance well he wants to find us at peace and he wants to find us pure and he wants to find us living with evangelistic purpose and we'll get to that the next time we're together in this passage I want to ask you to stand if you would next week we have the privilege I mean it I am so looking forward to next Sunday morning we have Blackhawk Christian school Sunday the entire school faculty and staff will be bringing our worship service to us we are really looking forward the faculty will form the choir Dr. Sam Barfel will be preaching you'll hear stories of kids and their lives changed and I can't wait for you to be here and take it all in then we'll come back to next Sunday and finish up here in 2 Peter 3 father as we go we say thanks for the fact that we can approach a God like you live in relationship with a God like you God you are so other your majestic splendor God your awesome and mighty character are such that you told Moses he couldn't even get a peek that simply a glimpse would kill him and yet God you allow us in your grace and mercy to live an intimate relationship with you to walk closely with you and how that works God I don't know but I am so grateful and I pray God that you would strengthen each and every one of us here today to be able to again and again to you for the peace that surpasses all understanding God to pursue purity no matter what the cost God thank you so very much we look forward if it be your will to being together again soon and we thank you and we praise you and we offer you our lives as we leave this place in your son's name and all the people agreed and said amen
