[time=583] (audience applauds)
[time=596] Good job.
[time=598] There they are, the faculty and staff of Black Hawk Christian School, and aren't they awesome?
[time=604] Good job.
[time=605] (audience applauds) I also want to say a thank you
[time=614] and a special recognition to our band.
[time=616] The band today was students from Black Hawk Christian School with some support from their band teacher, Mr. Holbrook, and some parents, and some alumni.
[time=623] So let's give our appreciation to our band.
[time=626] (audience applauds) Good job.
[time=628] (audience applauds) My name is Sam Barfel, and I have the absolute privilege of serving as a superintendent of a great school, Black Hawk Christian School, and I want you to know that I have completed my first year.
[time=643] I'm now in my second year, and I'm so excited because I'm no longer the new guy, and it feels really good not to be the new guy.
[time=651] As a matter of fact, every year my family and I, we take a family picture in the fall, and then we use that picture for our Christmas cards and that kind of thing, and so two years ago, it was our last year at our former school, Liberty Christian School in Anderson, Indiana, and we thought that it would be appropriate our last year there to take our family photo in Liberty Christian Red and Gold.
[time=673] That was the school colors of my former school, and so we did that.
[time=676] Two years ago, we went out to the big rock, and we had our family picture taken.
[time=681] There it is, Liberty Christian Red and Gold.
[time=683] All the barfels now bleed blue and gold, there they are.
[time=686] (audience applauds) I wanted to show that to you too because that is a testimony to the fact that I'm a very rich man, a beautiful wife who loves the Lord and three kids who've given their heart and life to Jesus Christ and trying to walk and faith in obedience and what a joy it is to lead that crew, and I'm a rich man.
[time=709] I just wanted to take a few minutes to share with you just a real quick little presentation we're calling BCS by the numbers.
[time=716] The reason we want to just give you a little bit of the history and statistics of our school is because in this group right here, and listening on TV, there will be people who are really familiar with Black Hawk Christian School, and then there's gonna be some who know that Black Hawk Christian exists.
[time=730] They might have heard of a basketball team or a volleyball team or something like that, but they don't know a lot about the school.
[time=736] There may be some here in the listening audience today who just don't know a thing about Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=741] So we just want to take just a few minutes and share with you some really important and cool things about the school.
[time=747] So we're gonna start with the number one.
[time=749] Here it is, the first year of ministry.
[time=751] 1973 was our first year.
[time=754] That makes us, we're in our 31st year of ministry.
[time=758] In that first year, there were 31 students who were enrolled, 31 students, okay?
[time=765] During our 31 years, there have been four administrators or four superintendents, and I can't tell you who the first two were, but the last two, myself, and a guy named Steve Longbrake who served in that capacity for 24 of the 31 years of this school.
[time=784] And you know, I've learned something about Steve Longbrake.
[time=788] If you go down the hall towards the commons, we call it alumni hall.
[time=791] We have all the pictures of all the alumni, and Longbrake is in every one of those pictures.
[time=795] You know, his school photo is there, and you go all the way back to like 1979, and there he is in all of his glory, Mr. Longbrake, and that's him.
[time=804] Now that's 1979.
[time=805] Now the interesting thing that I observe is I walk down alumni hallway and get from 1979 all the way to 2003 is he hasn't changed.
[time=816] He has a beard, and that's about it.
[time=819] He looks exactly, he's timeless.
[time=821] Steve, that wisdom and maturity.
[time=825] I mean, it's just been there, you've been old forever, Steve.
[time=827] We're in the world, are ya?
[time=828] (audience laughs) I saw him earlier, he was wearing his pumpkin shirt.
[time=832] There he is, way back there.
[time=832] He's got an orange shirt on.
[time=834] He thinks it's Halloween.
[time=835] No, I'm kidding.
[time=836] Steve, it is a pleasure and a privilege to lead the school after you, and after a person of your character and your integrity, and I counted a high honor.
[time=847] Well, yeah.
[time=849] (audience applauds) Well that administrative team, led by Steve those 24 years has evolved a little bit, and today our administrative team looks like this.
[time=860] There they are, that's the crew.
[time=862] There on the left is Larry Wilhite.
[time=863] He's our elementary principal next to him is Tom Hopewell, our secondary principal.
[time=867] In the middle there, the handsome guy in the middle, no, the back middle, is Steve Wild, and he's our director of development and our athletic director.
[time=877] Then in the front there is Happy Waltz.
[time=879] Happy is our assistant elementary school principal.
[time=883] Next to her is Jeff Co-Watch.
[time=885] Jeff is kind of new, but a veteran, been here for many years, but has just recently come back and joined our administrative team as director of student services.
[time=893] Not pictured there is Barb Balschmidt, who is the director of our preschool program, and I can just tell you, it's a pleasure to work with these people every day, and what a great privilege it is for me to work with them.
[time=903] Let's continue, BCS by the numbers.
[time=905] The number eight, that was the number of students in the first graduating class in 1981, way back there when Steve, well he looked the same back then, but eight graduates.
[time=915] The next number is number 25.
[time=916] 25 is a significant number because that's how many openings we have today in our school.
[time=921] In other words, we take 25 more students, and the majority of that 25, there's openings in three grades, kindergarten fifth grade and seventh grade, then we're at capacity, 100% filled.
[time=931] And in fact, the rest of the grades, almost all of the grades are at capacity, and some of them even have waiting lists.
[time=936] Matter of fact, there are 13 people still on waiting lists trying to get into our school.
[time=941] That's unique and exciting because God's blessed us with an incredible enrollment, and blessed us with just a solid ministry, but it's a tough problem to solve, and pray with us and for us as we figure out what God has worse in the future as we consider how we can minister and serve more students, more families.
[time=960] The next number is 27.
[time=961] That's the number of years we've been accredited by the Indiana Department of Education.
[time=966] That's right, Black Hawk Christian School is accredited by the state DOE.
[time=969] That's not a female deer.
[time=970] That's the Department of Education.
[time=973] And we've been accredited for these 27 years, and we have to go through that accreditation cycle, and that's an important thing for us because that guarantees that all the rights and privileges that come with a high school diploma at Black Hawk Christian School are afforded to all of our graduates, and they get into the colleges and universities and of their choice.
[time=989] The next thing is the number 61, which is the number of employees, all 61 people that you saw singing there just a few moments ago.
[time=998] That's our faculty and staff this year, 61 people.
[time=1001] Compare that to four 31 years ago, and it's amazing to see God grow this place.
[time=1008] But there they are, and when you came in, if you didn't get one of these little pictures, it's on a magnet, make sure you get one on the way out.
[time=1015] Our hope and our desire is that this little deal will end up on your refrigerator or at your desk at work or something, that this would be a reminder to pray for the ministry of Black Hawk Christian School, the faculty and the staff, and all the students.
[time=1027] And so we hope that that makes it to your refrigerator.
[time=1030] Then the next number is 60, and I mentioned that there were eight students in the first graduating class, well 60 is the number of students in this year's senior class, and that class is at capacity, and here's a picture of our senior class, the class of '05, just taking a couple of weeks ago, and a couple of clowns in the front row, of course, gotta do something fun, but that's what it's all about being a senior.
[time=1051] The next number, 765.
[time=1054] 765 is the total amount of students we have in our school, preschool, elementary, junior high, and high school, all the way through 765 students, this year at Black Hawk Christian.
[time=1065] Another number is 610.
[time=1067] 610 is the number of alumnus that we have, who've graduated from the 12th grade here, and have gone on to college, got married, raised their family, and all the rest, 610 alumni.
[time=1079] Here's another number, 454.
[time=1083] That is the number of families represented by the 765 students, 454, the number of families.
[time=1091] Now here's another cool thing.
[time=1092] 203 of the 454 families say that Black Hawk is their home church.
[time=1100] And then the next part of that is the other 250 families go to 69 other great churches here in the area.
[time=1108] And we like that, we think that's a sign of strength, and we, those of you who are visiting here today, who are part of the Black Hawk Christian school family, and visiting today because of Black Hawk Christian school Sunday, we say thank you for being here, we're glad you're plugged in and involved and faithful to your church, and then we see that as a strength.
[time=1125] I want to shift gears just a little bit and talk a little bit about academic achievement.
[time=1129] If we're looking at Black Hawk Christian school by the numbers, you know, we are a school, so we've got to do that reading, writing, arithmetic thing, right?
[time=1136] So here's some numbers on academic achievement.
[time=1138] The first one is 89.7.
[time=1142] That is the percentage of students who have passed the I-Step, the I-Step GQE, which is because we're accredited, all of our students take the I-Step, the GQE is the graduate qualifying exam, and 89.7% of our students pass the I-Step first time.
[time=1158] And then as it goes, those who didn't quite pass in one of the areas, math or language, will take it again and ultimately pass it.
[time=1165] Here's why this is significant.
[time=1166] Of all the schools in Allen County, both public and non-public schools, all of them, all of them, we rank third in Allen County for the GQE rate, the I-Step rate.
[time=1177] That's pretty cool, right?
[time=1178] (audience applauds) Now, the school that nudged us out in second place, be this by three-tenths of a percentage point.
[time=1188] I think they were 90.1% and then the school that took first place in Allen County was like 95%.
[time=1194] And I'm not telling you what those other schools were.
[time=1198] We were third in Allen County of our percentage of students passing the I-Step.
[time=1201] The next number is 90 plus, 90 plus percent of our students who have graduated over all of our graduating classes, all 610 alumni, 90 plus percent have pursued a post-high school education.
[time=1217] That's what Ph.S. stands for, post-high school education.
[time=1220] That's pretty significant.
[time=1221] The last number I wanna share with you is another very significant number, and it's the number 1,111.
[time=1227] And that is the average SAT score of our students from just last year.
[time=1234] That's the latest statistic.
[time=1235] And you know what SAT is, right?
[time=1237] The school-astic aptitude test, that's the college entrance test.
[time=1240] And I wanna tell you, in Allen County, we rank second.
[time=1244] There's only one school that beat us, but we rank second in the school-astic aptitude test scores.
[time=1250] That is very significant that we ranked second.
[time=1253] Now, yeah, thank you.
[time=1255] (audience applauds) Now, here's the thing, academic achievement is very important, we are a school, and we have to provide an academic education.
[time=1269] But listen to me, if that's all we do, if that's the sum total of our success, those three statistics right there, listen, we have failed our job.
[time=1280] Let me say that again.
[time=1281] If that's the sum total of all that we've accomplished as Blackout Christian School, we have missed the mark and we've not accomplished what we've set out to do at Blackout Christian School.
[time=1291] Academic excellence is important, but listen, that is a byproduct of trying to do everything to honor the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1300] It is not our primary focus.
[time=1302] It clearly is a focus, and it happens because what we're trying to do is teach all the kids that what God has called you to today, you have to do your very best.
[time=1312] God's called you to be a student today, and so your job is to be diligent and disciplined and to work hard, and that's the byproduct, the academic excellence is a byproduct of our heart of what we're trying to accomplish to honor God and his son Jesus Christ with everything we do, including academics.
[time=1331] Well, that leads me to our mission.
[time=1334] Blackout Christian School exists to glorify God.
[time=1338] This is our mission statement, I just want to work through it real quick before we get to the word.
[time=1342] Blackout Christian School exists to glorify God.
[time=1344] We've got to pause right there because the organization, the institution, the school itself of Blackout Christian exists to bring honor and glory to Jesus Christ.
[time=1353] That's the first and preeminent thing that we're about.
[time=1357] And we're also about partnering with parents.
[time=1360] Now, let me explain what that means.
[time=1361] Partnering with parents, do you know that in America, American public education, the American public education system believes they have the authority in the lives of the students.
[time=1370] You know what, God has given the authority and responsibility to train and nurture children to who, mom and dad.
[time=1376] And we will come alongside and we will partner with.
[time=1379] And the only authority we have in the life of a student at this school is the authority vested to us by mom and dad, because that's where it belonged and that's God's design.
[time=1388] And so we exist to glorify God by partnering with parents to assist parents, to come alongside parents, to walk alongside parents in their God-given responsibility to train and nurture their children in academics and in the spiritual training.
[time=1402] That's so important.
[time=1403] So we wanna partner with parents to equip students for life.
[time=1407] Notice it doesn't say we're not trying to equip students to get a great education, so then go to college and get a great job and earn a lot of money.
[time=1413] 'Cause that's not what we're about.
[time=1415] That's not what life is about.
[time=1418] We wanna train the kids to equip them for life, a life of service, a life of worship to God and to living their life in accordance with God and His will for them.
[time=1428] And that may or may not include making lots of money.
[time=1431] So we wanna equip our students for life and we wanna do that through a biblically based curriculum in a Christ-centered environment.
[time=1440] And everything that we teach, we say comes from a biblically directed perspective.
[time=1446] Whether that's science or math or history or the arts or social studies or whatever, it comes from, it emanates from the truth of scripture.
[time=1454] Let me give you an illustration of how that works.
[time=1455] Do you know a Black Art Christian school?
[time=1457] Do you teach evolution?
[time=1458] You say what?
[time=1459] Yes, we teach evolution.
[time=1460] We teach it as the theory that man concocted when he removed God out of the equation.
[time=1465] Yet to come up with some way to figure out how we got here so evolution was their best shot.
[time=1469] We teach it as simply that, the theory that man has developed and created once God was removed from the equation.
[time=1476] What we teach as truth is that God said he created this universe and this earth and my body and my soul and that's the truth.
[time=1485] And we get to teach everything from a biblically directed perspective.
[time=1490] That's a biblically based curriculum centered around the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1495] I'll tell you what, that's enough to get me up on a Monday morning come into work.
[time=1499] I can get excited about that pretty quick.
[time=1502] I wanna tell you this too.
[time=1504] We're gonna get to the word here in just a minute, but I just wanna make this comment.
[time=1507] There is not a time, I believe there's not a time in our history in America.
[time=1512] We're training the next generation how to live for God, how to be people of faith, to know God's word and to live God's word.
[time=1521] There's not a more critical or necessary time than today in America, to train or guess.
[time=1525] And that's whether you have your kids in a Christian school, in a private school, in a homeschool, in a public school.
[time=1532] It is still our responsibility to train the next generation so they can think biblically to know the word and to live a life of faith and obedience.
[time=1541] There couldn't be a more critical time than today.
[time=1544] We've gotta be busy and active about doing this.
[time=1546] Look at our post-modern culture, no absolutes.
[time=1551] Truth is totally relative.
[time=1552] What's true for you is good and what's true for you is good.
[time=1555] We're taught to tolerate everything because truth is relative so we have to be tolerant.
[time=1562] Listen, the Bible says nothing about tolerating false error.
[time=1569] And that's our post-modern culture.
[time=1571] And here's the interesting thing, there's a war going on.
[time=1574] And the war is for the minds and the hearts of the next generation.
[time=1579] And the war as a strategic, coming war, crafted by the enemy himself.
[time=1585] And today is the day we've gotta be busy and active about training the next generation to have a biblical mind and to think biblically.
[time=1594] And you know, in this war for the hearts and minds of our kids, education over the years has been the battleground of the ages.
[time=1604] When I was in seminary, I had a professor who said, and I can remember him saying it just as if it were yesterday, he said, this battlefield of the ages, this thing called education, it started all the way back in the garden when Satan came and tempted Eve because he came and he camped underneath the tree of knowledge.
[time=1625] He camped under the tree of knowledge and his target was Eve's mind and the weapon he pulled out was deception and it started back in the garden.
[time=1635] And so Satan first pitched his tent under the tree of knowledge and I can tell you today he hasn't moved it, he hasn't moved it.
[time=1644] Would you take your Bibles and turn to Genesis chapter three?
[time=1648] And I wanna look at the account of where Eve encountered Satan disguised as a serpent.
[time=1654] Go to Genesis chapter three, it's a passage that we commonly refer to as where the fall of man is recorded, the first human sin entered mankind right here in the garden.
[time=1666] Genesis chapter three, starting verse one, would you stand with me in honor of God's word as we read it together?
[time=1672] Says this, now the serpent was more crafty
[time=1681] than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said to the woman, indeed, has God said that you shall not eat from any tree of the garden?
[time=1690] And the woman said to the serpent, from the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat, but from the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God has said you shall not eat from it or touch it lest you die.
[time=1702] And the serpent said to the woman, you surely shall not die?
[time=1706] For God knows that in the day you eat from it your eyes will be opened and you will be like God knowing good and evil.
[time=1715] When the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was a delight to the eyes and that the tree was desirable to make one wise, she took from its fruit and ate and she gave also to her husband with her and he ate.
[time=1728] Then the eyes of both of them were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loin coverings.
[time=1736] Would you bow your heads in your hearts with me in prayer?
[time=1738] Father, thank you so much for your word.
[time=1740] Thank you that it's authoritative and powerful and alive and quicker and sharper than any two-edged sword and thank you that we can look at a passage today that was written and inspired thousands of years ago, but the truth of it hasn't changed and it's totally relevant for us today.
[time=1758] And I pray, God, as we consider this text and this passage that you would do a work in our hearts, that you would illuminate our minds so that we could see the cunning of the enemy in regard to our thinking and our minds.
[time=1773] And Father, I pray that our time in your word and our time in fellowship with one another would be honoring to you, but it would also change us today.
[time=1780] And I ask these things in Jesus' strong name, amen.
[time=1783] Thank you, maybe seated.
[time=1785] Well, there we are in the garden.
[time=1787] Satan has appeared in the form of a serpent.
[time=1791] He's disguised himself.
[time=1793] And as I said, his target was Eve's mind
[time=1799] and the weapon he used from his arsenal was deception.
[time=1802] And let's just break it down a little bit.
[time=1804] Let's unpack it and see exactly what he did.
[time=1807] You know, the very first thing he did there in verse one, very simple, he simply distorted God's word.
[time=1816] Look at what he said in verse one.
[time=1819] "Indeed, as God said, 'You shall not eat "from any tree of the garden.
[time=1823] "Time out, we gotta go back and look "and let's see what did God say." And so just go across the page to chapter two where God's word is clearly recorded.
[time=1834] Here's God's word in chapter two, verse 16 and 17, just on the other side of the page.
[time=1838] It says this, "And the Lord God commanded the man, "saying, from any tree of the garden, "you may eat freely, but from the tree of the knowledge "of good and evil, you shall not eat.
[time=1850] "For in the day that you eat from it, "you shall surely die." Now that's God's word.
[time=1856] Now let's compare it to what Satan did because he took a lot of truth and twisted and distorted one part.
[time=1863] He said, "Indeed, did God say you shall not eat "from any tree of the garden?" If you read that first verse quickly, you'll miss the distortion that Satan put in that comment.
[time=1876] God didn't say that.
[time=1879] Yes, God did speak.
[time=1881] Yes, God talked about the trees.
[time=1884] Yes, God put some parameters around there, but Satan twisted and distorted one small thing.
[time=1890] And here's something I learned as I studied the commentaries in the past few weeks.
[time=1895] Do you know that in the original Hebrew language, based on the construction and the syntax of the original language, you can even get from that language the tone and inflection in Satan's voice.
[time=1907] And what is in that passage in the original text is the idea that Satan was mocking, had a tone of superiority or a condescending air about him.
[time=1916] Here's how he said it.
[time=1917] Did God really say that you can't eat from any tree?
[time=1922] It was mocking.
[time=1926] It was a tone of superiority.
[time=1929] It was a condescending tone.
[time=1931] And then he just raised one little doubt, not a big one, just one little doubt.
[time=1938] And do you know what else he did?
[time=1939] He didn't distort the whole word of God.
[time=1942] He took one part of the word of God and just put a little twist on it.
[time=1947] And then just in that comment, he also helped Eve question or caused Eve to question God's heart.
[time=1958] And it's very goodness as if God wasn't good and surely he doesn't want you to do that.
[time=1966] Just in that comment right there in verse one, indeed as God said, you shall not eat from any tree of the garden, Satan distorted God's word.
[time=1976] And look what it caused.
[time=1977] The next verse tells us what it caused, verses two and three.
[time=1981] It caused confusion in Eve.
[time=1984] Look at Eve's response.
[time=1986] Go to verse two and three.
[time=1988] And the woman said to the serpent, "From the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat." So this is Eve responding now to Satan's distortion.
[time=1996] I'm not sure she picked it up, but when she came back to respond, she was confused because here's what she said.
[time=2001] "From the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat, but from the fruit of the tree, which is in the middle of the garden, God has said you shall not eat from it or touch it, lest you die.
[time=2011] Hold it, time out.
[time=2012] Let's go back to God's word.
[time=2014] Look across the page, chapter two again, verse 16 and 17.
[time=2017] God said, "From any tree of the garden you may eat freely, but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat for in the day that you eat from it, you shall surely die." Go back to Eve's words.
[time=2031] Do you know, in Eve's response as confused as it was, here's what happened because of Satan's distortion.
[time=2038] First of all, she omitted the word freely.
[time=2040] God said, "From all of the trees of the garden you may freely eat." Eve missed that.
[time=2046] She omitted the word freely.
[time=2050] Secondly, she added to God's word because she said, "Well, we can eat of all the trees, but we can't touch it either." Hold it.
[time=2060] God didn't say you can't touch the trees or couldn't touch the tree of knowledge.
[time=2066] She added to God's word.
[time=2069] And then lastly, she said, "Lest you die, instead of surely you will die." She changed to God's word.
[time=2077] So in her one confused response, here's what happened to Eve.
[time=2081] She omitted part of God's word.
[time=2083] She added to it.
[time=2084] She took from God's word.
[time=2086] She added to it and she changed in a confused response that all came from a simple distortion.
[time=2094] Wow.
[time=2095] Do you see that today?
[time=2098] The distortion of God's world in our culture, in our society, and the confusion that has come as a result of that distortion?
[time=2109] Listen, our country still considers itself herself a Christian country.
[time=2116] And if you ask most American, they would say, "Well, they believe the Bible." But if you dug into a little bit further, you know what they'd say, "Well, I'm not sure we're supposed to take it totally literally though." You know, the Ten Commandant thing, that's pretty good.
[time=2127] But there's other stuff.
[time=2129] I'm not sure, you know, that virgin birth thing.
[time=2130] I'm not sure if I can buy that one.
[time=2132] And so that distortion by the enemy has caused great confusion,
[time=2140] not only in our culture and our world, but I've even seen that confusion in the church.
[time=2146] Listen, God clearly teaches in His Word that our salvation comes by faith alone, nothing else.
[time=2156] But you know what?
[time=2158] In churches across America today, in pulpits today, there's something else that's being preached.
[time=2163] And that's faith plus something.
[time=2165] You fill in the blank.
[time=2167] And that's a distortion of God's Word and it's caused great confusion.
[time=2171] And the cost of that, the price of that is huge.
[time=2175] Here's another distortion that I've seen in God's church.
[time=2179] In us, American evangelical community.
[time=2184] And that's the idea that God's grace will cover it.
[time=2187] I remember speaking to a lady in my office a couple of years ago who was talking about something that she was going to do that was clearly wrong.
[time=2196] And I had the privilege and opportunity to open the word and show her that her decision was wrong.
[time=2200] And if she made that decision, it would violate God's will and His Word.
[time=2204] Because by the way, God's will for you and me is always in harmony with His Word, right?
[time=2209] And I showed that to her and you know what her comment to me was?
[time=2212] Well, I'm sure God's grace will cover that.
[time=2215] And I cringed.
[time=2216] You know what Paul said about that?
[time=2218] He said in Romans chapter 6, "Should we continue to sin so that grace may abound?" You know his response was, "God forbid, may it never be." We cannot trample on God's grace, thus distorting and confusing the Word of God.
[time=2235] You know, I heard this week that someone told me that an old Bible preacher named Dr. Jay Vernon McGee, who you probably can still hear on the radio.
[time=2245] I believe he's passed away now, but he preached his all the way through the Bible and took 30 years to do it.
[time=2250] And he used this phrase.
[time=2252] He said, "Satan is very happy to hide a thimble of error
[time=2258] in a lake of truth." And we see that right here.
[time=2264] And we see the confusion that follows.
[time=2267] Well, not only did Satan distort God's Word, but if we look in verse 4, we'll see that he ultimately denied God's Word.
[time=2276] Look at verse 4 with me.
[time=2277] And the serpent said to the woman, so first the serpent talks you distort God's Word, Eve responds, and the next response from Satan is the denial of God's Word.
[time=2287] And the serpent said to the woman, "You surely shall not die." Hold it, God said, "You surely would die." And look at the progression.
[time=2295] To get to the denial of God's Word, the first thing that has to happen is a small distortion of a small part of the truth.
[time=2303] And then the doubt, and then the confusion, and then ultimately the denial of God's Word.
[time=2310] And that's right there what Satan did in the very first encounter with humankind.
[time=2315] And what did that cause?
[time=2319] In verse 6, we see what it caused.
[time=2322] It caused rejection.
[time=2324] The denial of God's Word caused Eve to reject God and his Word and the authority of his Word.
[time=2332] Look in verse 6 with me.
[time=2334] Verse 6 says, "When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one wise, she took from its fruit and ate, and she gave also to her husband with her." There it is.
[time=2346] The first human sin recorded right there.
[time=2348] This is when sin entered into the world and changed the entire course of history.
[time=2353] Eve and Adam, and by the way, the New Testament writers,
[time=2359] Paul attributes the entrance of sin into the human race through Adam because Adam was right there with her.
[time=2365] And sin entered the human race right there, and it was because first the distortion, then the doubt, and then ultimately the denial and rejection of God and his Word.
[time=2377] You know, I have three kids, and you saw their picture just a few moments ago, and they're three teenagers, and we're just having a blast being parents of teenagers.
[time=2385] And our lives are busy and full, but as we think back to our years of raising our three kids, and as we still do it, we have this little line about being obedient.
[time=2396] Matter of fact, Jen would sing this little song.
[time=2399] Obedience is the very best way to show that you believe.
[time=2402] Oh, be, eat, you ever heard that song?
[time=2404] Our kid, you guys can make it sing it for you.
[time=2407] But we had this other little saying, delayed obedience is still disobedience.
[time=2411] And partial obedience is still disobedience.
[time=2416] It's still a rejection of mom and dad.
[time=2420] We've taught them and are teaching them that to obey mom and dad is honoring and loving mom and dad.
[time=2427] Just like in our spiritual life, as we obey God and take Him at His Word and live a life of faith and obedience, we're showing our love and our honor and our respect to who God is.
[time=2436] And so the result was rejection.
[time=2441] Adam and Eve sinned.
[time=2442] They rejected God and His Word.
[time=2444] Do you see that in our culture today, in our society?
[time=2448] Do you see that in our society, we have said as a people, God is of no consequence.
[time=2457] We've taken him out of our schools.
[time=2458] We've taken him out of the public square.
[time=2460] He's not a part of public life.
[time=2462] He is of no consequence to our life in America.
[time=2465] That's what we said as a people.
[time=2466] That's the philosophy.
[time=2467] That's the thinking of our American culture today in 2004.
[time=2471] We've rejected God's Word.
[time=2474] And our culture says the Bible is not the authoritative, inspired Word of God.
[time=2479] And it has no relevance to me in my life.
[time=2481] It's an ancient, outdated writing.
[time=2484] And there's no relevance to me today.
[time=2485] That is a rejection of God and His Word.
[time=2488] Or what about you?
[time=2491] Is there an area in your life that you could look at your life as you examine yourself today?
[time=2496] Is there an area of God's Word that you've rejected and said, "No, I'm not going to do that." Is there something that you've not given up for the Lord totally and complete obedience and complete faith?
[time=2510] No, I'm going to do it my way.
[time=2513] That is the result of the denial of God's Word.
[time=2516] Rejection of God is the result of the denial of His Word.
[time=2520] Well, not only did Satan distort God's Word and deny God's Word,
[time=2527] in verse 5 we'll see that he de-elevated God.
[time=2530] Look with me in verse 5.
[time=2532] Here's Satan responding again.
[time=2534] After he said, "You surely shall not die, and here's why." He said, "For God knows that in the day you eat from it, your eyes will be open and you will be like God." Here's an interesting thing about what Satan does.
[time=2546] Whenever he denies God's Word, he replaces it with a lie.
[time=2552] Satan is a liar and the father of it so says the New Testament.
[time=2558] And whenever he denies a part or all of God's Word, he replaces it with a lie.
[time=2564] And the lie that he replaced this one with with Eve was, Eve, if you just do this, you'll be like God.
[time=2570] God will be de-elevated.
[time=2572] You will be elevated to be like or better than God.
[time=2575] And all of a sudden, that was appealing to Eve.
[time=2578] Because the very next verse tells us that when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, that it was the delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one wise, then she took it.
[time=2591] The truth was replaced with a lie.
[time=2597] And you know, in 1 John 2, 16, it's going to be on the screen here.
[time=2600] You don't need to turn there.
[time=2601] But in 1 John 2, 16, it says this, "Do not love the world nor the things in the world." If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
[time=2610] And the next verse says, "For all that is in the world," listen to this, "the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the boastful pride of life is not from the Father, but is of the world." And the world is the cosmos.
[time=2624] The whole world system that has been set up in opposition and contrary to God.
[time=2629] And those three things, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, the boastful pride of life, we see that paralleled right here in the Genesis 3 passage.
[time=2637] Look at that, will you?
[time=2639] Eve said in verse 6, "When she saw that it was good for food, that's appealing to the physical, to the flesh, to the body.
[time=2645] When she saw that it was pleasant to the eyes, that's the emotions, our sense of aesthetics, that's the lust of the eyes." And then she saw that it was good to make one wise.
[time=2659] That was appealing to her mind in her pride of knowledge.
[time=2662] That's the pride of life that the New Testament writer talks about.
[time=2665] Interesting parallel, isn't it?
[time=2667] That when the writer first John writes these words, it's paralleling the very strategy, the very craftiness of the enemy in the first encounter with humankind.
[time=2681] And so what did the de-elevation of God cause?
[time=2684] It caused humiliation.
[time=2687] Look at verse 7, "Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked, and they went and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loin coverings.
[time=2698] They covered themselves because of shame and humiliation." And can I tell you today that the end result
[time=2708] of de-elevating God and elevating ourselves, and the end result of denying God's word and rejecting his authority in our life, and the end result of buying the lie and taking the distortion, the end result is always humiliation, shame.
[time=2724] One day, we will all stand before God and give account for our life.
[time=2732] Well, the humiliation came. That was the cause of de-elevating God or elevating man.
[time=2739] Boy, and I see that in our world today.
[time=2742] Our world has said God is of no consequence.
[time=2744] I'm totally autonomous.
[time=2746] It's called humanism, is what we call it today.
[time=2749] You know, I came across a prayer that was delivered by a pastor in the Kansas State Senate.
[time=2758] He was asked to come and be the chaplain for the day, and his task was to open in prayer.
[time=2763] And here is what he prayed, and it's worth repeating today because it so very much kind of captures the essence of what our culture is today.
[time=2773] And here's what he said.
[time=2774] This is Pastor Joe Wright praying before the Kansas State Senate.
[time=2779] Heavenly Father, we've come before you today to ask your forgiveness and to send your direction and guidance.
[time=2784] We know your word says woe to those who call evil good, but that is exactly what we've done, Father.
[time=2789] We've lost our spiritual equilibrium and reversed our values.
[time=2793] And so today we confess that we've ridiculed the absolute truth of your word and called it pluralism.
[time=2800] We confess that we've exploited the poor and we call it the lottery.
[time=2804] We confess that we've rewarded laziness and call it welfare.
[time=2808] We confess today that we've killed our unborn children and call it choice. We confess that
[time=2815] we've shot the abortionist and called it justifiable. We've neglected to discipline our children and we've called it building their self-esteem. We've abused power and we call it politics.
[time=2825] We've polluted the airways with profanity and pornography and we call it freedom of speech.
[time=2831] We have ridiculed the time-honored values of our forefathers and we call it enlightenment.
[time=2837] And then he closes his prayer this way, "Search us, O God, and know our hearts cleanse us from every way of sin and set us free." And then he prayed, "Guide and bless the men
[time=2848] and women who have been sent to direct us to the center of your will and we openly ask these things
[time=2854] in the name of your Son, the living Savior, Jesus Christ, amen." I wish I would have been there to hear that prayer. Listen, doesn't that just kind of catch the essence of where our culture and our
[time=2866] society, our world is at today? It comes from the distortion of God's word that brings confusion.
[time=2871] It comes from the denial of God's word that brings rejection of God and it comes from the de-elevation of God which ultimately brings humiliation. Well, let me ask you today. What about you?
[time=2883] What about your life? What about where you're at spiritually in a relationship with God through
[time=2889] His Son, Jesus? Is there an area in your life that is you examine yourself this morning? You would say,
[time=2896] "I'm a little bit afraid of the humiliation and shame that could come because of my disobedience."
[time=2902] Or is there an area that you've rejected God? God, I'm going to obey you here, here, and here,
[time=2909] but this area I'm going to keep to myself. Would there be an area in your life that the distortion has caused confusion? And let me ask you, can you go back and trace that back and find
[time=2923] either in your own humiliation or shame or in the rejection of God or His word or the confusion?
[time=2930] Could you identify the denial, the lie that you've replaced, that you've allowed to be replaced with the truth? Can you go back and trace the word of God that you've rejected and said,
[time=2941] "No, that part of it, I don't accept." Can you go back and find the doubt that's been cast by the
[time=2948] enemy, the distortion that comes from that? Well, I know as I have examined myself in these weeks
[time=2956] and just preparation of this passage and of this morning, I know I've got on my face before God
[time=2964] and said, "God, I'm all yours. Take my life and let it be consecrated, Lord, to thee." I give it all.
[time=2972] I do it again. And the areas I hold back, I give to you again today. Would you join me in that prayer
[time=2980] today that that would be your heartbeat? I want to, as we close, just point out a couple
[time=2987] other passages. Would you take your Bibles and turn to the, we're in the front of the Bible, go all the way nearly to the back, the New Testament, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, excuse me, 2 Corinthians, chapter 2. Let me try that again. 2 Corinthians, chapter 11. I think we got it now.
[time=3009] 2 Corinthians 11, verse 3. Here's what Paul says as he writes to the Christians in the church in
[time=3016] Corinth when he is referencing this account in the Garden of Eden with Satan and Eve. Here's what he
[time=3023] says. But I am afraid, verse 3, 2 Corinthians 11, verse 3, "But I am afraid lest as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, your minds should be led astray from the simplicity and purity of
[time=3035] devotion to Christ." Paul himself recognized that back there in the Garden, the target that Satan
[time=3044] put his sights on was Eve's mind and the weapon he used was deception. Don't let that be true of you
[time=3051] today. And then just turn over another page, 2 Corinthians, chapter 10, verse 5. If we're going
[time=3058] to camp under the tree of knowledge, then I want to ask you today, make sure you camp under the tree
[time=3064] of knowledge. And that is God in his Word and his Son Jesus Christ. Because in 2 Corinthians 10,
[time=3070] verse 5, it says this, "We are destroying speculations and every lofty thing raised up
[time=3076] against the knowledge of God and we're taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ."
[time=3082] That's the picture right there of camping under the tree of knowledge under this right here,
[time=3090] under the authority of God's Word and that it has its effect in your life and that's the picture,
[time=3097] that every thought is taken captive to the obedience of Christ.
[time=3104] Well, I want to go to one more passage as we wrap it up here. We're just about done.
[time=3108] When you go back to the Old Testament, Deuteronomy chapter 6, and we're not going to read the whole passage, but I want to go to verse 5. Deuteronomy chapter 6, verse 5 says this,
[time=3126] "And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your might, and these words which I am commanding you today shall be on your heart." Now listen to this verse 7, "And you shall teach them diligently to your sons, and you shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up, and you shall
[time=3145] bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontals on your forehead." Listen, here's our task today, and here's what I'm asking you to consider today. When you consider God's Word in your life, the first thing is you've got to know God's Word. You've got to know it. What are you
[time=3161] doing to learn God's Word, to study it, to ingest it, to make it a part of you so that you know the
[time=3167] whole counsel of God? Because the next thing we have to do is to live God's Word or to validate it.
[time=3173] And then the important thing, and it falls right in line with what we're talking about today,
[time=3180] we have to deposit God's Word into those around us. For you, that may be your children. It may be a
[time=3186] Sunday school class. It may be the class you teach biology in the classroom, but our task is to know
[time=3194] God's Word, to live God's Word, and to deposit God's Word. Listen, I've asked our audition choir
[time=3201] if they would come and close our time with this song, and it kind of just catches the heartbeat,
[time=3207] just captures it just a bit of the ministry of Blackout Christian School. Mr. Darren McCown has been our vocal choir leader, and he does an awesome job. He's a fun guy to work with,
[time=3218] and the students love him, and he just takes a bunch of average singers and turns them into
[time=3224] something really great. And I'm proud of these guys, and Mr. McCown, what you've done, close our time, would you?
[time=3242] [MUSIC - 114 seconds]
[time=3366] [APPLAUSE]
[time=3378] Thank you, audition choir, Darren. Thank you so very much, and would you all just stand with me, please?
[time=3384] I hope you can tell this morning from what you've seen and heard how very appropriately proud we are
[time=3392] of our school, how thankful we are for what God is doing in that ministry. Sam, thank you so much for a powerful, excellent message, and I hope all of you have been not only encouraged but
[time=3404] reminded of the things that you and I are to give ourselves to. Whether you're the parent of a
[time=3410] Black Hawk Christian school student, whether you're a public school parent, private school parent, home school parent, really much of what has been said today, you know, is for us, and we just want
[time=3421] to encourage you. This is the next generation, and the investment that we make and the deposit of
[time=3427] truth and love that we make will make a difference, and our hope is that you will continue to partner
[time=3434] with us in this amazing endeavor. Thank you for all that you do, school parents, thanks for the support
[time=3440] that you give. We're so grateful for you, and I hope that you've enjoyed the morning. Hey, real quick, those of you in the Black Hawk family, our decorators have a lot of work to do this week.
[time=3451] You may not have been able to help from nine to three each day so far, but maybe you could jump
[time=3457] in this week. They really need your help from nine to three each day. Obviously, they'll break on Thursday for Thanksgiving, but they've got a lot of work yet to do, so if you could give some time and effort on the decorating front, that would be really, really much appreciated. So give that
[time=3472] some thought. Don't forget to get your tickets, and also Black Hawk Christian school family, and Black Hawk Ministries family. Anybody wanting to support the school, get your premier dinner tickets today out at the guest center. Steve Wild will be out there. Anybody who's
[time=3488] welcome, it's a great night, a huge dinner, and then you get to come and be a part of the opening performance. So join us for that. Would you bow with me in a word of prayer? God, what a blessing it is for all of us in this room. What a gift to be able to receive this today,
[time=3502] to open up your word and to be reminded of great truth, to know that that great truth is not only
[time=3508] great truth, but God, it penetrates our hearts and lives. It reminds us of things that we need to
[time=3514] be reminded of. God, for many in the room, it calls us to new places of growth and surrender.
[time=3522] And God, I pray that as we leave this place, that your spirit and your word working together would change us, transform us, continue to grow us into the people, God, that you've called us
[time=3533] to be. Thank you so very much for our school. Thank you for the years and years and years that
[time=3539] you have been at work. God, we pray you would continue to give our faculty and staff strength
[time=3545] and courage of heart to be the people that you've called them to be. And we'll thank you for it and your son's name. Amen.
