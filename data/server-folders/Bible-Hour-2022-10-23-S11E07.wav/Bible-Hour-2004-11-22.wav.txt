[time=121] [MUSIC]
[time=124] I want to be, I want to be.
[time=127] I want to be more like Jesus.
[time=130] I want to be, I want to be less likely.
[time=136] I want to be, I want to be.
[time=140] I want to be more like Jesus.
[time=143] I want to be, I want to be less like me.
[time=150] [MUSIC]
[time=162] >> And when you come to my home, Lord, am I too busy to sit down at your feet?
[time=172] [MUSIC]
[time=175] And when you speak to my heart, Lord, am I too selfish to hear what I really need?
[time=186] Yeah, 'cause you are everything I need.
[time=192] You come to treat me, and I am nothing without you, Jesus.
[time=201] I'm tired of tearing myself down.
[time=204] I need to know your mercy.
[time=207] I want to see me more like you.
[time=211] You see me.
[time=216] [MUSIC]
[time=245] Oh, I want to be like you.
[time=250] Yeah, I want to be, I want to be.
[time=255] I want to be more like Jesus.

[time=267] I want to be more like you.
[time=270] I want to be, I want to be less like me.
[time=277] And when I look in the mirror, what do I see?
[time=283] Do I see your son and me?
[time=287] [MUSIC]
[time=291] >> Hi, I'm Kelly Bird, and I have the privilege of serving as the senior pastor here at Blackhawk Ministries.
[time=297] And as you can see from the set behind me, we are in full swing around here as the season of Christmas has come upon us, and we get to celebrate this amazing story, the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ again with so many of you.
[time=313] For 28 years, Blackhawk has been celebrating the story of Christmas, and we call it Christmas with Blackhawk.
[time=320] And over the next two weekends, the first two weekends in December, we are bringing a total of 10 performances to you and those in this community that we care for, and we counted a privilege to give ourselves to.
[time=334] There are still some tickets available, just a few.
[time=337] We've got some $10 reserve seats that are still open in a few of those concerts, and there are some free general admission tickets.
[time=344] You can take care of all of your ticket needs by just copying down the phone number and the extension that you see on the screen here.
[time=352] We'd love to have you join us.
[time=354] Bring some family, bring some friends, bring the kids.
[time=357] It is kid-friendly.
[time=359] It is going to be absolutely spectacular, and the music and the drama and the story, and especially some of the staging, you are going to absolutely be amazed.
[time=369] And I hope encouraged.
[time=371] I want to tell you about a special part, though, of these two weekends, and that would be the second Saturday, Saturday, December 11th at 10 a.m.
[time=379] We do something we really, really are thankful for.
[time=382] We call it our special needs concert.
[time=385] We bring the whole production to that Saturday morning at 10.
[time=390] We do the whole thing, and we invite those in our community with special needs.
[time=395] You may know someone, or you may have a family member directly there in your home, and there may be some physical needs or some emotional mental needs.
[time=404] Whatever the special need might be, we love getting the chance to just pack this place with those special people, kids, students, adults, and their caregivers.
[time=416] Moms and dads, grandmas and grandpas, brothers and sisters, just bring the whole crew, anybody in that special need arena, Saturday morning, December 11th, right here at 10 a.m., and we're going to give you the whole concert.
[time=429] We can't wait.
[time=430] We love you, and we are so thankful for what many of you give to those with special needs, and we want to honor them, and we want to honor you as well with a special treat.
[time=440] So come and join us.
[time=442] We are so grateful that our Lord came.
[time=445] We're so thankful that we serve a God who was willing to come near and give us His Son, and we can't wait to share that truth and to celebrate this season with you.
[time=457] Come and be with us, and we hope to see you soon.
[time=460] Merry Christmas.
[time=462] [MUSIC - 212 seconds]
[time=678] We are obviously, not only can you tell by the set design and look of our room here this morning,
[time=686] but if you watch any television at all, if you're listening to the radio, I mean, you know that it's here.
[time=692] I mean, the season has descended upon us.
[time=695] And I know personally, oftentimes, I kind of try and keep it at bay if that makes sense.
[time=700] I oftentimes feel like it kind of comes too quick and they start playing the songs too soon.
[time=705] We start hearing the commercials too early, but nonetheless, you know, it comes and it's here.
[time=710] And we, those of us, especially those of us that know him, have this amazing privilege of beginning the process of celebrating and remembering the absolute glory and beauty
[time=722] and significance of that amazing morning in Bethlehem.
[time=726] And each year, I think I started this so, gosh, maybe four, five, six years ago, I kind of felt like if I wasn't careful, oftentimes, as the season would come and as the days would turn into weeks and all of a sudden, it's the 25th, you know, there's so many things going on and there's so much activity.
[time=742] And again, many of it, good activity, but nonetheless, there's a lot of it.
[time=745] And sometimes my mind and my heart wouldn't be very focused.
[time=749] I feel like I got to January 1 and never really, never really took in
[time=755] the full significance and impact of that which we celebrate, the birth of our Lord.
[time=761] And so a few years ago, I began to just kind of purpose in my heart that as the season would descend upon us, I was going to do my best with God's help to kind of land on a truth for that year.
[time=774] A Christmas truth, a truth related to the birth of our Lord.
[time=780] And there are many of them.
[time=782] And I realized that as I began to sit down and think through the many different truths, the many different principles, I mean, the stories that are connected to this life-changing event.
[time=793] And so I wanted to just encourage you this morning, you may not need any help in this arena, but if you are open to or feel like you do need some encouragement.
[time=800] I want to encourage you this year, like starting today, to kind of pick a truth,
[time=807] to pick a Christmas truth and read about it and focus on it and have that truth,
[time=813] have that story, have that principle be kind of the center of your devotional time with him as the days and weeks go by leading up to December 25th.
[time=821] Have it be something you talk with your friends about.
[time=823] Have it be something that you talk about as a family?
[time=826] I mean, in the list is long, I wrote a few of them down here for you this morning.
[time=829] You could in the next few weeks focus your heart and mind on Jesus becoming human.
[time=835] You could focus your heart and mind on this idea of Emmanuel.
[time=839] God near, God coming near us, the person of Christ taking on the form of human flesh,
[time=847] becoming 100% human while remaining 100% divine.
[time=852] He did that for you.
[time=857] You could talk about and read about and study about and meditate on the divine conception and the birth by a virgin.
[time=866] That in itself is one of the most miraculous things in this whole story, how God chose to work through a young teenage girl, how the Son of God came through the virgin birth, and what that meant, how that set him apart in such a dramatic and unbelievable way.
[time=886] You could read about that.
[time=888] You could go back and study through that.
[time=890] You could allow the truth of the virgin birth to be the truth that you focus on and give your heart and mind to in the days to come.
[time=896] I wrote down prophecy fulfilled.
[time=899] You could go back to the many, many prophecies in the Old Testament and go directly to the birth of Christ, prophecy about where he would be born, prophecy about when he would be born, prophecy about who would bear him, prophecy about those who would visit.
[time=915] I mean the list goes on and on and on and every one of those prophecies we find fulfilled perfectly.
[time=923] You could go back and be reminded of that.
[time=928] Another one I wrote down I think is the one that I've landed on for this season,
[time=934] as I've thought this through.
[time=937] And it's the fact that God the Father sacrificed and gave His only Son.
[time=943] We oftentimes connect that truth with Easter, and obviously it is a great Easter truth.
[time=950] But the giving of His Son didn't begin at the cross, no, the giving of His Son began in that stable, in that trough on that morning in Bethlehem,
[time=960] as that young teenage virgin gave birth to the very Son of God.
[time=965] God gave, John 3, 16.
[time=968] Many of you know that verse, it says, "For God so loved the world that He what?
[time=972] That He gave His only Son.
[time=976] I memorized it as a kid, that whosoever believed in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life." We were in Washington, D.C., some of you know that others, if you may not, our family got to go visit an aunt and uncle on my wife's side for Thanksgiving.
[time=994] We drove out their Tuesday night, got their Wednesday morning, had a great Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and came home Saturday.
[time=1002] And I had never been to D.C., it was a fascinating experience.
[time=1005] We had an absolute blast.
[time=1007] His loved it, Cabernet, and we went downtown there, went down to the mall area, to the monument, to the memorials, and to the pond, and to the White House.
[time=1017] We walked until they were begging to go to the car.
[time=1021] I mean, it was really, really something else.
[time=1024] I was absolutely amazed with the beauty of it and the significance of it.
[time=1029] It was very eye-opening, and we were really, really thankful that we went.
[time=1034] The very last thing we did before we hit the road on Friday night was we went to the Smithsonian.
[time=1039] Well, there are several Smithsonian's.
[time=1041] We went to one of the Smithsonian museums and just had a kick walking around looking at different exhibits, and we ended up up on the second floor at the 9/11 exhibit, and there were a lot of people in the room, a lot of people.
[time=1054] I mean, they were stacked in there.
[time=1056] The place was just crawling with folks, and you know what?
[time=1058] We had done a really, really good job as a family in the midst of all the crowds.
[time=1063] Those two days, and I think, you know what?
[time=1066] I think I just got tired, and I know Deborah got tired, and we were kind of fading fast, and we knew it was time to leave, and so we gathered up everybody one last time to kind of make our exit out of the museum, and as we walked, I think I walked a little quick.
[time=1082] And I believe we got a little bit distracted, and we lost Jake.
[time=1090] I mean, we lost him.
[time=1093] He was gone.
[time=1098] And we had made our way about maybe 100 yards down, 50-100 yards down the way, and all of a sudden, you realize you're not all there, and so we just kind of huddled everybody together, and Russell T. stayed with the little ones, and Deborah and I just did what you were doing, and we just shot back where we had come from.
[time=1116] And, you know, we just went up and down the exhibit,
[time=1122] and I'm yelling for Jake.
[time=1125] And you would imagine, I mean, there were those in the room there with us, who once they heard me yelling for Jake, I mean, they realized what had transpired.
[time=1133] I think many of them felt our confusion and our panic, and others began to look, and he wasn't there.
[time=1143] So, after about three or four times, down and back, you know, when you feel like you've exhausted all your immediate opportunities, I just decided to head for the door, and there was a door there, halfway down, that led to outside, and as I walked around the corner into the door, here he comes with a very large security guard by his side,
[time=1167] holding his hand, and they're walking my way.
[time=1170] And Jake's got these big tears running down his cheek, and the guard was incredibly gracious to him.
[time=1176] I don't think it was too impressed with me.
[time=1180] We had a brief interaction, and then I just knelt down and put my arms around.
[time=1186] My boy, and I held him really tight, and I was reminded a few hours later
[time=1195] that I wouldn't give him to anybody.
[time=1201] I wouldn't give that little boy to save any of you.
[time=1207] I mean, that's how I feel, right?
[time=1210] And that's real stuff, and God so loved you, that at Christmas,
[time=1217] in his divine plan that was preordained before the foundations of the world, he so wanted you to know him that he gave his son so that we could have life.
[time=1230] And as I held on to that little rascal, I asked him, I said, "Jake, where'd you go, buddy?" He said, "I wanted to go outside, Dad." You know, they were tired, it was true, and they just wanted to get out, and the first door he saw, he went out.
[time=1243] And as I held him that day and hugged him, you know, "If you've lost kids, you know how it is, you just hug them every 15 minutes." We gathered outside as a family, we prayed, and thank God for watching over us, and I was just struck by that. He gave his son, it's a great, great truth, mind-boggling.
[time=1262] And I want to encourage you to think about a truth that you can hold on to,
[time=1268] a truth that you could really give yourself to in the next several weeks.
[time=1274] It may be something that would really encourage you.
[time=1278] Well, hey, two weeks ago, we started a message.
[time=1282] I realized that after having the absolute treat of being able to have Dr. Sam Barfell
[time=1288] and those from our school share the ministry of Black Caught Christian with us last Sunday, I was sitting down this week realizing we had a message that we didn't get all the way through the week before.
[time=1298] And I kind of wanted to come back if I could and talk about that and kind of finish that up.
[time=1304] What brought us to this message a couple weeks ago, if you'll think back, we had just finished, remember we had just finished the series on Proverbs.
[time=1313] And in that last message in our series on Proverbs, we had talked about our spiritual futures.
[time=1319] It was a great time together as we look to God's Word at the reality of the fact that at the end of this life, we have a future still.
[time=1327] For those that know and have surrendered their hearts and lives fully to Him, their future is a safe and secured and perfect and heavenly future.
[time=1338] And it was an amazing study to be reminded of the fact that this life here is just a blip on the screen
[time=1347] and that you and I, if we know Him, have an amazing eternity to look forward to.
[time=1353] Well, as I kind of chewed on that and thought about that in the days that followed the conclusion of our Proverbs series,
[time=1360] I realized that throughout Scripture, we see that there is a very real and very significant pattern found in Scripture.
[time=1368] And the pattern is this.
[time=1370] I saw in my studies that whenever there is biblical teaching about our future, it is oftentimes followed, oftentimes.
[time=1378] I'd say like 85 to 90 percent of the time.
[time=1382] Whenever you find a passage that deals with the future, that deals with Christ's return,
[time=1388] that deals with the resurrection body, that deals with our futures and what heaven will be like.
[time=1394] Whenever you come across biblical teaching on the future, it is oftentimes followed by teaching and exhortation
[time=1402] regarding our today, regarding the way we live now.
[time=1409] The security we have in heaven someday should lead to distinctive, purposeful living on this day.
[time=1417] Here's how we set it. You can look at the screen.
[time=1419] You'll see something that we had up there a couple weeks ago, and we'll come back to this thought this morning.
[time=1424] Future truth should be prompting and moving us toward a more meaningful, obedient today.
[time=1431] I believe that with all my heart, and I believe God's word teaches that.
[time=1434] Future truth, truth about our future, should be prompting you and I not to a kind of presumptuous living,
[time=1441] not to a kind of living that says, "Okay, that's my future. Now today, then I'll just live however I want.
[time=1447] Do whatever I want to do, go wherever I want to go, because hey, I'm covered." I got a little insurance here. See, you don't view eternity.
[time=1456] You don't view the future relationship. You and I have the privilege of sharing with him.
[time=1461] You don't view that as insurance. No.
[time=1464] It should prompt you and move you and I to more meaningful, obedient living today.
[time=1471] And we found this pattern in a number of different places in the New Testament, especially one of those places
[time=1478] where we find this writing and this teaching about the future being immediately followed by teaching about today
[time=1486] was in 2 Peter 3, and in honor of God's word.
[time=1490] Would you stand with me this morning?
[time=1494] As we read 2 Peter 3, we're going to begin at verse 10.
[time=1499] 2 Peter 3, verse 10, let me read this for us, and then we'll move on.
[time=1503] 2 Peter 3, 10 through the first line of verse 15.
[time=1508] "But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a roar and the elements will be destroyed with intense heat, and the earth and its works will be burned up."
[time=1519] Since all these things are to be destroyed in this way, what sort of people ought you to be
[time=1525] in holy conduct and godliness, looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God
[time=1531] because of which the heavens will be destroyed by burning and the elements will melt with intense heat.
[time=1537] But according to his promise, we are looking for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells.
[time=1543] Therefore, beloved, since you look for these things, be diligent, be diligent, give great effort.
[time=1552] That word talks about a physical, emotional, spiritual effort being exhausted toward.
[time=1559] Be diligent to be found by him in what?
[time=1562] In peace, spotless and blameless.
[time=1567] And regard verse 15, and regard or view the patience of our Lord as salvation.
[time=1578] Let's pray.
[time=1579] Father, God, we stand before you this morning in humility.
[time=1585] God, with heads bowed and eyes closed, God, with everything we have laid before you.
[time=1595] We come to this place this morning where we need desperately to hear from you.
[time=1599] God, many in the room this morning need reminders of great truth that should be affecting our lives.
[time=1607] Others in the room this morning, God, don't know you.
[time=1610] Haven't come to that place of full surrender.
[time=1612] And God, we pray that your word and your spirit would be at work in their hearts and lives.
[time=1617] God, collectively, we come honoring you, respecting you.
[time=1622] As Proverbs taught us, Father, we come in fear of you.
[time=1625] Not because we fear you'll hit us, but God, because we know how great and mighty you are.
[time=1631] We sang about it earlier.
[time=1633] God, we fear you because our respect and our admiration for you is so deep and so great.
[time=1639] And that you would embrace us, God, that you would love us as much as you've loved us, God, that you would give as much as you've given.
[time=1647] And God that you would take us today and gently, yet powerfully, lead us to the understanding of new truth,
[time=1655] the remembering of old truth that our hearts have wandered away from God.
[time=1659] We are amazed by that, by your kindness and your patience.
[time=1664] God, continue in these minutes to build into us the understanding of you that we need to live the life God that you've called us to live in your son's name we pray.
[time=1673] [AMEN] So here we see our pattern.
[time=1678] If in fact this is going to happen and it will, the earth will be burned up, the elements will melt away,
[time=1685] the Lord will return, spiritual futures will be realized.
[time=1689] If in fact that's going to happen, then live like this today.
[time=1694] Here's what he said.
[time=1695] And we saw three things there in our passage in 2 Peter 3.
[time=1698] Number one, we saw that we are to be a people who are found by him upon his return at the onset of this
[time=1705] spiritual future, we are to be a people who are at peace.
[time=1709] Number one, two weeks ago, while we wait, he said be at peace.
[time=1714] Obviously he would desire for you and I to be a people who were at peace with each other.
[time=1719] Relational harmony, very important and talked about often in God's word, but the context here gives more
[time=1725] specific direction to the idea of your personal peace with him.
[time=1731] See, God has not called you to a life of fear.
[time=1739] God has not called you to an unsettled soul.
[time=1743] See, God has in relationship with him given you and I the privilege of living at peace.
[time=1751] Paul described it in Philippians 4 as a peace that transcends a peace that goes beyond anything you and I could ever comprehend.
[time=1759] And we went to that passage in Philippians 4 where it says be anxious for what?
[time=1764] Say it louder.
[time=1766] Absolutely nothing.
[time=1768] Whatever you might face, whatever it is you're encountering, whatever trial or temptation the enemy might bring your way.
[time=1775] God's word says to you and I, those of us that know him, be anxious.
[time=1778] This deep-seated sense of fear or anxiety about some future contingency.
[time=1784] Be anxious, he says, for nothing, but through prayer and supplication with thanksgiving make your request known to God and the peace of God which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts.
[time=1800] It will.
[time=1802] It doesn't mean that you gave it to him once three years ago.
[time=1807] It means you and I are willing as we said two weeks ago to give it to him moment by moment by moment if that's what's needed.
[time=1817] Be at peace.
[time=1819] And you know what?
[time=1820] Let me just say this to you this morning and we're going to move on.
[time=1822] If you're not and you need some help, ask.
[time=1830] If you're not, if your heart is unsettled, if fear and anxiety and panic and the unsettled soul is more the norm than the exception and you need some encouragement.
[time=1844] You need some help.
[time=1845] You feel like you need somebody to kind of walk through whatever it is you're going through.
[time=1851] Let us know so the body of Christ can come alongside.
[time=1856] So the Spirit of God and the Word of God and the people of God can come alongside and help you experience the kind of peace that he intended you to live in.
[time=1865] It said be at peace.
[time=1866] Secondly is we made our way through the passage and the passage I'm referring to is there in 2 Peter 3, 14.
[time=1871] Therefore beloved, since you look for these things, be diligent to be found by him in peace.
[time=1878] Secondly, spotless and blameless.
[time=1881] Stop there.
[time=1882] That was our second point two weeks ago.
[time=1884] While we wait people, we are to be a body of Christ.
[time=1888] We are to be Christ followers who are given absolutely in every arena imaginable.
[time=1896] We are to be a people given to purity, purity.
[time=1902] Peter writes here to a culture that was absolutely declining in moral purity.
[time=1907] That phrase spotless and blameless in the original text that would give specific reference to their moral life.
[time=1914] See, fornication was on the upswing.
[time=1916] Permiscuous living was on the upswing.
[time=1919] Immerality and infidelity.
[time=1921] I mean there were things going on there in Peter's day as he writes mind-boggling stuff.
[time=1929] And he says if you're going to be the people of God, living today in a way that would honor God
[time=1935] with a future with God to be realized, be diligent, he says.
[time=1941] And it's important that we come back to this word, especially in this arena of purity.
[time=1947] Because the bottom line here in the text is clear, be diligent.
[time=1950] Listen, do men and women, students, young middle-aged and old.
[time=1957] I can stand here and describe for you the culture that Peter writes to, and I just did.
[time=1962] I mean that's factual stuff, those things were going on in that culture.
[time=1966] Well you know what, those things continue to transpire today.
[time=1970] And I'm convinced today more than ever before that this is the arena, the enemy is going, this is the arena, the enemy has chosen to attack you and me.
[time=1980] This is the arena, moral purity is the arena.
[time=1985] He has chosen to attack with everything he has, you and me.
[time=1993] And so when it says be diligent there in the text, and we're talking about being a people who are pure, we are at peace and we are pure, then it's important for me to remind you
[time=2004] and it's important for you to remind me and it's important that together we would be a people who stop at absolutely nothing, that you and I would be as aggressive as we would
[time=2015] need to be, to ask for whatever level of help, to submit to whatever levels of accountability,
[time=2024] to talk about it, to strategize for it, to pray about it, to be a people, young middle-aged
[time=2031] and old alike, that put a stake in the ground and say you know what, we are going to fight with everything we have, to stand for and give ourselves to purity.
[time=2043] And when failure comes we'll admit it and when struggle comes we'll wave the flag.
[time=2051] But those are the actions of diligent people, giving themselves to not only a life of peace
[time=2058] with God but a life of purity before Him.
[time=2063] Well, we got to our third point a couple weeks ago and we didn't have any time to go on, so we're going to finish that up this morning.
[time=2069] While we wait, we are to be a people who are at peace.
[time=2076] And number three, we are to be purposeful.
[time=2080] Purposeful, that's right.
[time=2083] Let's go back and read through verse 14 again.
[time=2086] See how this thing leads up to the first sentence there in 15.
[time=2089] Therefore beloved, since you look for these things, be diligent to be found by Him in peace,
[time=2095] spotless and blameless, and regard verse 15 and regard the patience of our Lord as salvation.
[time=2105] What does that mean?
[time=2113] You and I, the Scripture says here, are to regard, we are to regard the...
[time=2117] While we wait, we are to regard the patience of our Lord, it says.
[time=2123] We are to view it.
[time=2125] We are to observe it and conclude that what that is, his patience were to view that as salvation.
[time=2135] Think about it.
[time=2136] What does that mean?
[time=2141] Well, let me answer, let me answer that question with Scripture.
[time=2145] It's usually the best way to answer a question.
[time=2148] It's just to answer it with Scripture.
[time=2150] And to answer it with Scripture, we don't need to go very far.
[time=2153] Look back up to 2 Peter 3.8.
[time=2157] Here you go, but do not let this one fact escape your notice, beloved, that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years and a thousand years is like one day.
[time=2165] Verse 9, here you go.
[time=2166] The Lord is not slow about his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you.
[time=2172] Not wishing is patient toward you, Peter writes to a believing audience.
[time=2178] But is patient toward you not wishing for any to what?
[time=2184] Not wishing for any to perish, but for all to come to repentance.
[time=2190] Did you catch that?
[time=2193] Why is he waiting?
[time=2196] Is the earth going to be destroyed?
[time=2198] Yes or no?
[time=2199] Will Christ come again?
[time=2201] Yes or no?
[time=2202] Will all the elements melt away?
[time=2204] Yes or no?
[time=2205] Will a new kingdom be received?
[time=2206] Yes or no?
[time=2209] Why is he waiting?
[time=2213] He's waiting for what?
[time=2215] Say it louder.
[time=2218] He's waiting for people to come to faith.
[time=2227] And he could have done that any way he wanted to.
[time=2230] Remember this, he could have done the coming to faith thing any way he wanted to.
[time=2234] The way he decided to do it was he decided for reasons I've yet to figure out.
[time=2240] He has decided to use you and me.
[time=2245] We're the instruments he has chosen.
[time=2248] Do we save them?
[time=2249] No, God saves them.
[time=2250] But God has chosen to use you and I to proclaim what is true, to live what is true, to offer what is true.
[time=2257] He has chosen you and I to be the people who would walk across the driveway or rock across the street or walk across the office,
[time=2265] extending a hand of love and relationship to those far from God, to genuinely give ourselves to them,
[time=2273] to invite them, to encourage them, to have conversations with them.
[time=2279] So the Spirit of God can do what only the Spirit of God does and that is bring them to faith.
[time=2286] Why are we here?
[time=2289] Why is he waiting?
[time=2291] What are we to make of God's patience?
[time=2295] Well, when you think about all the activity, all the God designed activity that he calls you and I as Christ followers to engage in,
[time=2304] furthering community, giving glory to God, worshiping God.
[time=2308] Some of the most amazing things that he's called us to.
[time=2312] When you think about that which he's called us to, there's one thing that we'll not do.
[time=2318] Listen, there's one thing that we will not do.
[time=2322] There's one thing that we get to do here that we will not do there.
[time=2330] And that is, what?
[time=2335] Sharing our faith.
[time=2337] Living, I like to say it this way, living with a redemptive passion.
[time=2344] Living with a redemptive passion, building redemptive relationships.
[time=2352] We get to worship and bring glory and give glory to God here.
[time=2356] I realize that.
[time=2357] It's one of the greatest callings that he's called us to.
[time=2360] But you know what?
[time=2361] We'll get to do that there and it'll be better than it is here.
[time=2366] We get to be with each other here.
[time=2368] Well you know what? If I had my choice of being with you here or being with you there, I'd rather be with you where?
[time=2374] There.
[time=2377] I mean go ahead and scratch your head, think it through.
[time=2379] I mean what are we here for?
[time=2384] He says he's waiting.
[time=2388] The Lord is not slow about his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you.
[time=2395] As some, but is patient toward you not wishing for any to perish, but for all to come to repentance.
[time=2402] Do all come to repentance? Does everybody in the end get saved?
[time=2406] Yes or no?
[time=2407] No.
[time=2409] Because he gave us a thing called what?
[time=2411] He gave Adam and even the garden a thing called what?
[time=2414] Choice.
[time=2415] And he's never rescinded that and he never will.
[time=2417] It's not about puppets and buttons that he pushes.
[time=2420] He gives every single one of us a choice.
[time=2428] And he waits on you and I to be a people.
[time=2431] I don't know how long he's going to wait.
[time=2433] I don't know when he's going to call it a day.
[time=2436] But he's left you and I with the opportunity to build redemptive relationships.
[time=2441] What does that mean?
[time=2442] Building redemptive friendships with people far from God and watching God bring them to faith in Christ.
[time=2448] He uses us to do that.
[time=2450] And we participate that in the church.
[time=2452] We participate in that endeavor as a church corporately.
[time=2455] I'm reminding of what it says in Ephesians 4.
[time=2458] You can turn there if you'd like.
[time=2461] It says in Ephesians 4 as he describes the activity, the God-ordained activity of the church.
[time=2471] In Ephesians 4, he says this, it says in Ephesians 4, 12, it says, and he gave, you remember that passage?
[time=2485] Ephesians 4, 12, 11, and he gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as pastors and teachers.
[time=2497] In the way he designed the church originally, as you look at the blueprint of how the church is to function,
[time=2505] he says he gave for his bride the office of evangelists.
[time=2509] He obviously has it in mind that we would corporately as a church be engaged in
[time=2515] and giving those with that gift, the opportunity to exercise that gift within the context of the local church.
[time=2522] There are pastors and teachers as well.
[time=2524] He obviously equips the church with those who are able to fulfill the great commission.
[time=2530] To go, to go and reach, to go and proclaim, to go and live out what is true, to go and make disciples,
[time=2538] then teaching them all that he has commanded.
[time=2542] And we do that today.
[time=2544] We are absolutely wholeheartedly devoted to having evangelism,
[time=2550] the proclamation of that which is true and right, be a part of so many of the things that we do.
[time=2556] Now we are also extremely committed to having the teaching of God's Word, the building up of the believer,
[time=2562] central to what we do, especially in this setting.
[time=2564] But you know what the cool thing is about that?
[time=2566] Some folks want to kind of distinguish between evangelism and the building up of the saints.
[time=2570] And it's so amazing for me to read 1 Corinthians 14.
[time=2573] We see this happen all the time, though we have evangelism activity, and though we have people gifted in that arena, and though we provide opportunities for them to exercise that giftedness, it happens everywhere.
[time=2587] When we gather here on Sunday mornings to equip the saints to teach the Word of God and to proclaim what is true,
[time=2593] so many times we see and hear about this happening, 1 Corinthians 14.
[time=2598] Therefore, if the whole church, verse 23, therefore, if the whole church assembles together, I don't think this one will be on the screen, but you can follow along with someone next to you.
[time=2607] 1 Corinthians 14, 23, therefore, if the whole church assembles together and all speak in tongues,
[time=2613] and ungifted men or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are mad?
[time=2620] Will they not be confused?
[time=2622] But if all prophesy, prophesy the proclamation of God's truth, if all prophesy and an unbeliever or an ungifted man enters, he is convicted by all.
[time=2633] He is called to account by all.
[time=2635] The secrets of his heart are disclosed, I believe, by the Spirit of God and the Word of God,
[time=2642] and so he will fall on his face and worship God declaring that God is certainly among you.
[time=2651] It's amazing to see that happen.
[time=2653] It's amazing to hear stories of people who come through these doors, sit in a back row pew, and simply witness the proclamation of what is true and good and right,
[time=2663] and they witness that through worship and song, they witness that through the teaching of God's Word, and the Spirit of God can use that to bring them to faith.
[time=2671] The Spirit of God also uses evangelists within the context of the local church,
[time=2679] and that's all good.
[time=2680] That's how he designed it, but you know what?
[time=2683] To this day I believe the most powerful, to this day I believe the most powerful example
[time=2689] of this great endeavor, redemptive living, is seen when you and I live it out out there.
[time=2699] The most powerful example of this I continue to see is when you care enough about this, when this means enough to you, when your gratitude goes so deep that in where you work and in where you live and in those that you know you can't wait, hopefully, please God,
[time=2715] be used of him to encourage and come alongside somebody far from God to extend a hand and a heart to them,
[time=2723] offering them not only what is true and right, but offering them you.
[time=2727] That I believe is the most powerful context for evangelism.
[time=2734] When we open our hearts and lives and schedules to involvement in the life-changing journey of another.
[time=2744] First Peter, back where we are this morning.
[time=2747] We're in second Peter, but if you go back just one book to 1 Peter 3, it says in 1 Peter 3, 15.
[time=2756] It says, "But sanctify Christ, but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts always being ready to make a defense,
[time=2766] always being ready to explain, always being ready to engage, always being ready to make a defense
[time=2773] to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you, yet with gentleness and reverence
[time=2784] and keep a good conscience for 16.
[time=2787] Can you do that?
[time=2789] Every one of you here this morning that knows him.
[time=2793] Can you do that? Can you listen? Can you give an account?
[time=2797] Can you articulate? I mean, could you answer someone's question when they said to you,
[time=2804] "Hey, could you explain this God thing?" I mean, you're not perfect. I mean, you've obviously got some things to still work on, but you seem to have come kind of down this road a little further than myself.
[time=2815] Could you help me with that?
[time=2818] Could you talk to me a little bit about the Bible?
[time=2820] I mean, could you talk to me a little bit about church?
[time=2822] I mean, what's going on there?
[time=2826] Are you ready? Are you willing? Are you able to give that kind of account?
[time=2830] And do you structure your days?
[time=2834] I was reading this week. It should be one of your greatest joys, one of your highest priorities.
[time=2839] You should pray for them incessantly, serve them and care for them sacrificially.
[time=2843] You should give yourself to them willingly.
[time=2845] You and I should ready ourselves daily before God, pleading with God to build into these friendships
[time=2854] that we could have conversations that matter and live out our faith authentically.
[time=2861] Why is he waiting, people? Why is he waiting?
[time=2868] Well, he's waiting for people to come to faith, people that he will bring to faith, but for some reason, he chooses to use you and I.
[time=2877] Are you mindful of that process?
[time=2880] That process that I just read, it should be one of your greatest joys, one of your highest priorities.
[time=2885] You should pray for them incessantly, serve and care for them sacrificially.
[time=2888] Give yourself to them willingly.
[time=2890] You and I should ready ourselves daily to build into these friendships, have conversations that matter and live out our faith authentically.
[time=2897] Are you mindful?
[time=2899] Every one of you here that knows him. Are you mindful?
[time=2901] Are you immersed in that process?
[time=2903] Are you characterized by a commitment to that process?
[time=2907] I hope and pray so. Listen, for your sake.
[time=2912] You say, "Well, what about their sake?" You know what?
[time=2914] I'm not worried about them because God will save them.
[time=2919] He's been doing that for years without you.
[time=2924] I'm worried about you and I get worried about me sometimes.
[time=2929] I hope you would be immersed and given to that.
[time=2932] I hope you would be readying yourself daily. I hope it means that much to you for your sake.
[time=2939] Because if it doesn't, if somehow you've kind of sequestered that part of following Christ
[time=2946] over here to the side, then you've become spiritually unhealthy, spiritually half-hearted.
[time=2953] That isn't at all the way God designed you and I to live.
[time=2957] Christ followers, I've learned some things over the years, Christ followers that don't fully engage
[time=2963] and build relationships, redemptive relationships with those far from God, typically don't because they're too busy.
[time=2970] And you know the sad and tragic thing is oftentimes they're too busy in the church.
[time=2975] Oftentimes they're too busy spiritually.
[time=2977] They choose not to give heart and time to those searching because they're either too involved with the already convinced or their hearts have shrunk over the years due to a lack of redemptive activity
[time=2989] and with a small, shrinking heart they just don't care that much.
[time=2999] He says, "Be at peace." He says, "Be pure." And he says, "Look, I've left you here to do something.
[time=3008] I'll take you out of here and someday we'll do all that other stuff together.
[time=3012] But I've left you here to do something."
[time=3018] And so I ask you this morning and I ask myself this morning, are we doing that?
[time=3023] I'll tell you what, when you do it, when you give yourself to that endeavor, when you really make room in your life to give heart and soul and time to those searching,
[time=3036] when you're willing to do what it takes to build a friendship that really counts, it is absolutely life-changing.
[time=3046] I'm going to have you watch this video this morning and I want you to watch it because I want you to celebrate the new life in Christ that it represents.
[time=3056] I also want you to watch it because we got to talk with every single one of these individuals and every single individual that you'll see this morning.
[time=3066] God used another.
[time=3069] It may have been a parent, it may have been a coworker, it may have been a friend, it may have been a neighbor, but God used the redemptive effort of another to reach into the lost searching heart of these individuals.
[time=3082] And he brought them to faith.
[time=3085] That's just how he chooses to do it. Please, I'm begging you.
[time=3090] Be available and be open. Don't walk through this life spiritually half-hearted.
[time=3097] Be at peace. Be pure. Be purposeful.
[time=3101] This, I believe, is the greatest purpose of all.
[time=3104] And I am so grateful that we get to take part in it.
[time=3107] Watch and thank God for what he does and pray that he would use you in the days to come
[time=3113] to reach those he's given you opportunity to love and come alongside.
[time=3121] About four years ago, I hit rock bottom of my life.
[time=3130] My selfishness and my pride just got in the way.
[time=3134] And I believe truly that God hated me.
[time=3137] And I believe that for so many years.
[time=3142] I never thought I was working off for Jesus to be saving.
[time=3161] I now look to Christ for significance, contentment, security and control.
[time=3167] Now your burden's lifted and carried far away.
[time=3175] Precious blood is washed away this day.
[time=3180] So sing to Jesus.
[time=3186] Just in the last year, I realized that I can't live what God under in life and not be a voice rendered.
[time=3192] I want to publicly ask His forgiveness for ignoring Him for 27 years.
[time=3198] I wanted to fully surrender myself because I was so appreciative of what He had done for me.
[time=3222] God kept on asking me when are you going to turn back to me?
[time=3253] Here's my life.
[time=3256] Here's my marriage.
[time=3257] Here's my kids.
[time=3258] Here's my family.
[time=3259] Take it all.
[time=3260] And that's been part of the journey for me.
[time=3262] It's just to lay down my life and give God the shame and the sin and the pain and just watch Him turn into something really beautiful for His Kingdom.
[time=3282] I literally could not be standing here if it wasn't for Christ.
[time=3296] I can't express what it means to me to tell you that Jesus Christ is my Savior.
[time=3305] With your final heartbeat, kiss the world goodbye, then go in peace and laugh on glory side.
[time=3320] And fly to Jesus.
[time=3334] Today I see no love, Christ is my Savior and God.
[time=3340] And it's a privilege as your pastor and friend.
[time=3345] To baptize you, the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[time=3356] I love you Jesus.
[time=3365] [AMEN] Well why don't you stand with me this morning.
[time=3367] And as you stand, I'll just share with you again with your heads bowed and your eyes closed.
[time=3376] I'll just share with you again if I could wish and hope and pray for anything in your life, you personally.
[time=3384] It wouldn't be that you would live with a vocational passion, although I would want you to work well,
[time=3394] heartily as unto the Lord, that's true.
[time=3399] I wouldn't want you to live with an athletic passion necessarily or a financial passion.
[time=3406] I would want you to live each and every one of you that knows Him this morning.
[time=3410] I want for you to live with a biblical, redemptive passion.
[time=3415] It's what we're here to do and it brings great glory to Him.
[time=3420] It is an act of obedience.
[time=3424] And it represents the fullest expression of Christ following when we are as devoted and committed and surrendered to the opportunities He gives you with them, those on the outside looking in.
[time=3437] Those who haven't yet come to that place of full surrender, the opportunity and privilege He gives us with them.
[time=3445] And then the opportunity and privilege He gives us with them when they come to faith to teach them God's Word
[time=3452] and to build into their hearts and lives the spiritual disciplines which lead to godliness.
[time=3458] I would long for each and every one of you in this room to have that kind of holistic, big picture, biblical, redemptive passion.
[time=3467] And if you don't and you need some help, let us know.
[time=3471] God, I pray this morning that we would be purposeful.
[time=3476] It says there in 2 Peter 3 that you wait on us and we can't believe that you would even name us in this process, God, that you are so in control of and over.
[time=3489] But God, you allow us to participate and God, we commit again to be purposeful.
[time=3495] And the building of redemptive friendships in lives of purity and in the pursuit of peace, God, peace with you.
[time=3505] God, we pray that your spirit and your word and your people would come alongside us in the process so that we could be pleasing to you.
[time=3514] We thank you for this time this morning and we thank you so very much for the miracle of life that we just saw in that video.
[time=3522] God, give us the strength and wisdom to continue in this ministry that you've given us, a ministry that is able to participate in and celebrate the joy of new life and baptism.
[time=3538] God, as we go, continue the work that you've begun here today. May your spirit continue to shape and mold us, bring conviction where it's needed, and we'll thank you for it in your son's name, we pray. Amen.
[time=3568] God, we pray that your spirit and the love of God, we pray that our spirit and the love of God, we pray that our spirit and the love of God, we pray that our spirit and the love of God.
[time=3583] God, we pray that our spirit and the love of God, we pray that our spirit and the love of God, we pray that our spirit and the love of God, we pray that our spirit and the love of God, we pray that our spirit and the love of God, we pray that our spirit and the love of God, we pray that our spirit and the love of God.
