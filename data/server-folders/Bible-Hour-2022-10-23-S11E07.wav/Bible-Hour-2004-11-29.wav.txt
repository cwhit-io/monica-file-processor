[time=60] [MUSIC]
[time=88] >> Well, I'd like you to help me welcome Tricia Gould.
[time=93] [ Applause ]
[time=100] Everybody say hi, Trish.
[time=101] >> Good morning.
[time=103] >> Isn't that cool?
[time=104] >> Yeah.
[time=105] >> Oh, yeah.
[time=106] >> That's right.
[time=107] Now, we met a little over a year ago, right?
[time=111] >> August.
[time=112] >> Where Blackhawk meets and eats at cosmos on Colosseum.
[time=117] How many people have ever eaten at cosmos, right?
[time=119] See what I mean?
[time=120] >> That's why I don't like people.
[time=122] >> Yeah, that's right.
[time=123] So, I was in there one day full of joy, and I invited the hostess to church.
[time=129] I found out that she was looking for a church, and she could only come on Wednesday night, so I invited her to Common Ground.
[time=135] I actually proceeded to invite Trish.
[time=137] And you wave from me from the soda area, the fountain, and said, I'm coming.
[time=142] >> I couldn't leave a friend alone.
[time=144] >> That's right.
[time=149] So, I want you to share with them what happened the first two nights?
[time=156] >> Well, the first week I came, I walked into the room, went for something, drawed me to the front of the room, the front room.
[time=163] And I saw a sense of peace through these people.
[time=167] Their smiles on their face was just, I wanted to have what they had.
[time=172] So, I came back the second week, sitting in the front row again, and a gentleman was up giving his testimony.
[time=179] >> Troy Harder.
[time=180] >> Troy Harder was up there.
[time=182] And as I sat in the front row, Troy was telling my story of life,
[time=188] telling some of my trials and tribulations I had endured.
[time=192] And I raised my hand after Troy was done, tears have fallen down my face.
[time=198] >> I'm getting ready to preach, and you're interrupting.
[time=201] >> Yeah, I need to say something, Mitch.
[time=203] And I shared with Troy that he wasn't alone in his sins.
[time=209] He wasn't alone with his guilt and shame that I had felt that before and that it was going to be okay.
[time=216] He was new to Fort Wayne, and I wanted to let him know that he wasn't alone.
[time=221] >> I was going to teach the prologue, is that what comes first?
[time=225] Epilogue's last, the prologue of the Gospel of John.
[time=228] We're beginning our series on that when Trish raised her hand.
[time=231] And it was John 1, 1 through 18.
[time=234] And I just, after she said she wanted what he had, I felt like 100 sets of eyes looking at me saying, "Okay, what are you going to do?" So I said, "Trish, why don't you come up here just like this?" And on the stool beside me, and instead of teaching this, we're going to experience it tonight.
[time=251] And I started reading through that to her explaining as we went.
[time=254] We got to verses 12 and 13, they're going to come on the screen.
[time=258] And I think of these as Trish's theme verses now.
[time=261] Yet to all who received him, to those who believed or fully surrendered, it's a commitment, it's not just mental ascent.
[time=268] To those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God.
[time=273] Very important here that you catch this, what we're saying.
[time=276] And the next verse says, children born not of natural descent,
[time=282] nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God.
[time=287] And after Trish that night, that night Trish prays in front of everybody
[time=293] and fully renders her life to Christ as Savior and Lord.
[time=297] Yeah, thanks, that's good.
[time=299] Thank you.
[time=300] And all these joyful people, she talked about just,
[time=307] she's like, it's kind of like she's a rock star that night, and they're just all over and giving her phone numbers and things.
[time=312] Remember that?
[time=313] And you said, I'm overwhelmed, I'll never forget what you said.
[time=315] Then it hit me, wait a minute, she has two daughters in Awana.
[time=322] Maybe we better go pray with them.
[time=325] And so we went and got them.
[time=327] At that time, Brianna was 10 and Sarah was 5, today they're 11 and 6.
[time=332] And we went down in the harvest room and we prayed, and what happened there?
[time=336] And my 10-year-old daughter Brianna ended up fully surrendering her life to Christ.
[time=342] And in Sierra, she's definitely got Jesus in her heart.
[time=347] There's no doubt about that, the story behind her.
[time=349] And I want you to tell Sierra's story, because what I heard now made those verses even pop more than what they had just done upstairs.
[time=359] Back in '97, I was having dinner with some friends of mine, and I was going on and on about how wonderful it was to be a mother.
[time=367] I was a single mother to Brianna, and it's such a gift to be a parent to give these children's morals and teach them the way of life.
[time=377] And the following Tuesday, this friend calls me, and she says, Trish,
[time=384] I'm getting abortion on Thursday, but if you tell me you'll take this kid, I'll have the baby for you.
[time=390] So on March 5th, there was a beautiful baby girl born.
[time=394] She was four pounds, 5.6 ounces, she was about 48 days premature,
[time=400] spent 16 days in ICU, and came home in a cabbage patch doll outfit.
[time=406] It was too big. No, it was too big, that's how tiny of a...
[time=410] She was a child that needed 24-hour care.
[time=412] Oh, you mean she came home bitterly in the doll's play clothing?
[time=415] Yes, because she was so small.
[time=419] But today, I have the most kind, sympathetic, compassionate child.
[time=425] Jesus definitely had his hands around her the day that her biological parents
[time=431] loved her enough that they gave her life.
[time=444] The theme at Christmas of Black Hawk this year is generations.
[time=448] And it hit me that night that not one generation was surrendering its life to Christ, but two,
[time=460] and that there would be more.
[time=463] And God had never used me like that before.
[time=467] But I want you to know that He will use every single person in this room,
[time=475] and within the sound of my voice, who will fully surrender your time, your talent, and your treasures to Him for the benefit of others in Him.
[time=487] All you have to do is be a humble, willing conduit of the Holy Spirit in you,
[time=494] a smile, a hello, peace, joy, and invitation.
[time=504] So let's put a face, two faces, with these names. Do you girls want to come up?
[time=511] Breanne and Sierra?
[time=513] Life.
[time=525] Life that only comes by the grace of God, and life that we only have in its fullest, by surrendering humbly and fully to our Savior and Lord, Jesus Christ.
[time=542] I'd like you to stand, you're going to sing with the team.
[time=547] Hallelujah what a Savior.
[time=550] Hallelujah what a Savior, and I want you to picture this family.
[time=556] Two generations, the beginning of a ripple effect of many more,
[time=562] who are going to grow up in the covenant community of Jesus Christ because an addict said, "I can't God, you can take me."

[time=602] Wow, I love stories, and I'm just so encouraged that we have a church
[time=611] where a story with these events can be shared, Trish.
[time=618] I really appreciate you sharing.
[time=620] That is an unbelievable story.
[time=624] I love stories.
[time=626] I mean, I love them.
[time=628] Not so much the novel kind, but the movie kind.
[time=631] My wife is a reader, she reads all the time.
[time=634] I love movies and how they take characters and they develop them, and they put them in situations and create a plot that twists, and then there's a climax, and it's amazing.
[time=648] I love how, in fact, I don't watch a movie so much for entertainment value as much as for how the plot just moves and the characters develop with it.
[time=657] Today, movies are different in that they are looking for character-based plots
[time=664] rather than a plot-based plot, if that makes sense.
[time=669] Jesus' stories were always character-based, and we're going to talk about and look at those, one of those today.
[time=675] But before we do, I have a little competition for you.
[time=679] I'm a little hot.
[time=680] Can you lower my mic a little bit?
[time=683] I have a list of movie quotes.
[time=686] Every great movie has a great character, and at some point into that movie, the character will do something or say something that is memorable.
[time=696] It's the turning point.
[time=697] It's what you remember that movie about.
[time=700] And I have a number of these, and we're going to have a competition.
[time=703] We're going to split this church up and do quadrants.
[time=706] We're into quadrants here, so we're going to divide it this way.
[time=709] We have the lower half, we have quadrant 1, quadrant 2, quadrant 3, and quadrant 4.
[time=718] Okay, now here's the deal.
[time=719] I'm going to tell you the line and you have to yell out the movie it's from.
[time=725] Okay, now there's about 10,000 people in this room, so you're going to have to be quick and you're going to have to be loud.
[time=734] All right, so you're going to get out of your comfort zone, you may say the wrong answer, but that's okay because we probably won't hear it, so I mean, don't think you're going to win anything either.
[time=741] Like, we'll give you 5% off your tie than 2005.
[time=744] How does that sound if you win?
[time=746] No, elders need to approve that.
[time=750] Okay, are we ready?
[time=752] Remember, you're this quadrant, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
[time=757] Okay, here we go.
[time=760] I've got a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
[time=764] I think I heard it up there, they got it up there.
[time=767] Okay, it's Wizard of Oz, Dorothy said that in Wizard of Oz.
[time=771] Okay, ready, here's another one.
[time=773] Two infinity and beyond.
[time=776] Right here, right here.
[time=778] Not that child here, but the parent who's watched that movie hundreds and hundreds of times, over and over it.
[time=786] Yeah, I know, I'm with you.
[time=788] Okay, ready?
[time=792] This is quadrant 1.
[time=794] The wood, yeah, Mitch.
[time=797] You always got a bean count, someone who has a count over there.
[time=800] Okay, ready?
[time=802] I'll be back.
[time=806] I have to go to the quadrant 1 again.
[time=808] We got it done over here.
[time=811] Okay, ready, here we go.
[time=812] Come on, I'm not hearing much from over here.
[time=814] Ready, here we go.
[time=816] Go ahead and make my day.
[time=819] Right here, I'm going to give it over here.
[time=821] We got it over here.
[time=823] Sorry, sorry.
[time=825] Hey, you can leave.
[time=829] We've already taken the offering, you can leave.
[time=833] All right, may the force be with you.
[time=838] That's a tie.
[time=839] I'm not going to split this church.
[time=843] Okay, here's a tough one.
[time=844] My favorite movie of all time.
[time=845] All right, here we go.
[time=847] Here's looking at you, kid.
[time=849] Yes, who was that of?
[time=851] All right, Casablanca from 1942.
[time=854] Rick Blaine says that to Elise.
[time=856] Whatever her name is, Elsie, it's one of those names.
[time=861] Houston, we have a problem.
[time=864] Okay, there's a tie right here.
[time=867] Okay, you've seen this like a hundred times already, okay, in this season.
[time=871] Look, daddy, teacher says every time a bell ring an angel gets his wings are there, okay?
[time=880] Okay, this time I want everyone to kind of let this quadrant up here say something.
[time=884] They're the only ones.
[time=885] I mean, you're part of our family, okay?
[time=888] Let's make sure you're living.
[time=889] Okay, here we go.
[time=890] You got like two seconds and they get to jump in.
[time=893] So you have two seconds to get this answer.
[time=895] Here we go.
[time=896] My mama always said life is like a box of chocolates.
[time=900] Good job.
[time=901] You never know what you're going to get.
[time=903] All right.
[time=904] That's all I got to say for now.
[time=906] Okay, last one.
[time=910] Everyone who exalts himself will be humbled.
[time=913] He who humbles himself will be exalted.
[time=916] Jesus Christ.
[time=917] That's right.
[time=918] Good one.
[time=920] That's the one that's in a story and it's in the Bible.
[time=924] He who humbles himself will be exalted.
[time=926] He who exalts himself will be humbled.
[time=928] And that's a story we're going to talk about today.
[time=931] Rabbis had a view and religious teachers from 2000 years ago.
[time=936] They viewed the text as a jewel.
[time=939] And they saw this as like a gem or a jewel.
[time=942] And light comes and hits it and it reflects a certain way and it refracts this way.
[time=945] And it has a certain sparkle and it looks beautiful.
[time=948] And what they would say is the Bible, the text, is just like that.
[time=952] And if you take this text, just like you would a jewel, and if you spin it,
[time=958] it sparkles totally different.
[time=960] The reflections are totally different just as beautiful but different.
[time=964] This morning what I like to do is I'd like to take a parable Jesus told and spin it.
[time=972] And so we see it just a little different.
[time=976] I first like to tell a story before we go into that story.
[time=982] A while back, a town was having a revival service.
[time=986] And the churches, they all worked together on this revival service.
[time=990] And it was a huge success. On the last night, people were finding their way to the front of the church
[time=996] and they were kneeling at the little altar and pouring out their hearts.
[time=1000] They were crying. They were just confessing things out loud to one another.
[time=1005] It was truly a God moment in that town.
[time=1007] It was a God moment that that town needed.
[time=1011] At the end of the last night, there were two people in particular who were near the front of the sanctuary.
[time=1017] One person was a local pastor.
[time=1020] And he stood up. He held his shoulders back. He lifted his head up.
[time=1024] And he said aloud enough for those people around him to hear.
[time=1027] He says, "Dear Lord, thank you for what you've done in me.
[time=1031] I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
[time=1034] I have obeyed your call to ministry. I have been faithful in all things.
[time=1039] I have preached the word faithfully. I have never stolen a penny from anyone.
[time=1045] I have visited the sicken hospitals, and I have comfort to those at funerals.
[time=1050] I thank you that I've not been sucked into some lifestyles of being drunk or doing drugs.
[time=1056] I've never gotten a divorce, nor do I have any illegitimate kids running around.
[time=1061] I thank you that, and he paused.
[time=1065] He heard a commotion in the corner, but it stopped, so he kept going.
[time=1072] Thank you that I don't struggle with immorality, like so many other people do on the internet and in movies.
[time=1080] I thank you that he stopped again. He heard that same noise he didn't recognize.
[time=1085] He stopped and he looked, and what he saw stunned him.
[time=1089] There in the corner, kind of in the dark by herself, was this woman on the ground.
[time=1095] She was wearing high heels, a black fishnet stockings, and a tight revealing dress that advertised her vocation.
[time=1103] It was a town prostitute.
[time=1107] So he looked back and finished his prayer by saying, "I thank you, Lord, that you've spared me from the consequences."
[time=1115] Consequences that a woman like this will have.
[time=1120] The woman, kind of hearing that looked up and her mascara was dripping, and just kind of looked back down, put her hands in her head and her hands,
[time=1129] and just said, "God have mercy on me, the dirtiest person in here. Please have mercy on me."
[time=1140] Which one was made right with God that night?
[time=1147] My theme this morning is when pastors are pretenders and prostitutes are pure.
[time=1156] That can happen, often that does happen.
[time=1162] Let's turn to Luke 18. If you have your Bibles with you, turn to Luke 18.
[time=1168] We're going to start in verse 10.
[time=1172] If you don't have your Bible, we're going to display it on the screen. If you would stand as we read God's Word, and reverence for His Word, would you stand?
[time=1183] Luke 18, starting with verse 10.
[time=1189] Two men went up into the temple to pray, one of Pharisee and the other, a tax collector.
[time=1196] The Pharisee stood up and was praying this to himself, "God, I thank You that I am not like other people, swindlers, the unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.
[time=1209] I fast twice a week, and I pay ties of all that I get.
[time=1216] But the tax collector, standing some distance away, was even unwilling to lift up his eyes to heaven, but was beating his breath saying, "God, be merciful to me, the sinner."
[time=1231] I tell you, this man went to his house justified rather than the other. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted.
[time=1246] Please be seated.
[time=1251] I want to look at this story from a Jewish perspective. I want to try to create for you what the environment and what the atmosphere was when Jesus told this story.
[time=1260] I also want to create for you what would a Jewish listener, 2,000 years ago, what would he have felt? What would he have heard with this story?
[time=1270] It's going to be a little different than I think what we in our Western American culture would feel in here.
[time=1276] So if you can imagine with me being, let's say in a synagogue, which is a Jewish church from 2,000 years ago, it's packed. It is a full house, standing room only, and we are standing along the back leaning against the wall.
[time=1292] That is our perspective. So we hear this rabbi up front speaking and telling stories, and we see people's reactions. We get to feel what they feel with them.
[time=1302] That's the image I want to have and continue the rest of this morning.
[time=1307] So Jesus begins the story, and by this time in Jesus' ministry, he has hundreds, if not thousands of people following him around.
[time=1315] He's very notorious. His storytelling is phenomenal. People are just wondering, "Okay, what's he going to do today? What's he going to talk about today? Who's he going to stump today?"
[time=1324] I mean, it was exciting to be around this rabbi called Jesus. So he begins to tell a story. Two men went up to the temple to pray, okay?
[time=1335] I understand that I'm a good Jew. I understand that twice a day we go to the temple. Sometimes we do sacrifices twice a day.
[time=1342] You have your outer courts. You walk in there. Then only Jews can go into the inner court, and there's the altar right in the middle.
[time=1348] Jesus himself talks about how the temple is the house of prayer. So of course, two men, they're going to go into the temple. What are they going to do in the temple? Pray. It's a house of prayer. No big deal.
[time=1363] Next phrase, "One of Pharisee and the other a tax collector. Introduce the characters." Now, we, if I were to say to you, John, you're acting like a Pharisee. Would I be cutting him down or would I be complimenting him?
[time=1381] I'd be cutting him down, wouldn't I? Not so, two thousand years ago. If someone were to call you and say, "You remind me of a Pharisee," you would say,
[time=1392] "I thank you," because the view of Pharisees was extremely high. They represented holiness. They represented living the life God intended you to live. They represented obeying their law, the Old Testament, their scripture.
[time=1409] We think that Jesus cut down the Pharisee system, that He basically said, "It's no good. That's not what He did." He confronted those Pharisees who were proud. He confronted those Pharisees who were hypocrites, who lacked the love for the people they were leading. He never wants, we don't find anywhere in Scripture, in any of the Gospels, where He ever condemned the Phariseeic system, just the opposite.
[time=1438] He often said, "They teach with authority. They're lifestyles. Just do what they teach, but just don't always do what they do." He commended their righteousness many times, but it's those Pharisees who lacked the love, who were hypocritical. It's those Pharisees who were proud. Those are the ones we find confronted in Scripture, and this is what He's trying to get at this morning.
[time=1465] So, a Pharisee, as a Jewish person leaning against the back wall in the synagogue, listening to Jesus say, "Pharisee, Pharisee good guy, protagonist, hero, enter the villain, the tax collector." Now, the tax collector was a Jew, but the Jewish nation was under the rule of Rome, and Rome collected taxes, and so the emperor would say, "This is your tax right here, this level." Well, a tax collector would collect this much and keep that much for himself.
[time=1494] So, Jews consider tax collectors traitors. You are our brother, and you're stealing from us. You're being dishonest. You're deceiving us. You are a traitor.
[time=1505] They would take a tax collector and put them as low as you can get, like a Samaritan, someone who had Jewish blood and Gentile blood, not a true Jew.
[time=1514] This attitude is very similar to the attitude that an Adolf Hitler had in the Third Reich. Very, very prejudiced. These people are not even people. They're less than humans.
[time=1526] That is their attitude towards a tax collector. So, as a good Jew standing in the synagogue in the back, we would hear this story, and right away, we have our hero, we have our villain, we have our bad person.
[time=1540] And any time a story, what makes stories so impacting is that you identify with characters as soon as you can. So, right away in the synagogue, most of these people in the synagogue would be identifying with the Pharisee.
[time=1554] Say, "Okay, we're like the Pharisee. What is he going to say this tax collector? How is he just going to rip him apart? Go after him, Rabbi, get him." That would be our attitude.
[time=1564] The Pharisee stood and was praying this to himself, "God, I thank you that I am not like other people, swindlers, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.
[time=1574] I fast twice a week and I pay ties on everything I get. That was a prayer you want to hear your Rabbi pray.
[time=1582] You want to know that your Rabbi is an honest man. You want to know that he's fair. You want to know that he's faithful.
[time=1588] You want to know that he's not involved in things you don't want him involved in. I want to know that my pastor is a faithful to his wife.
[time=1597] I want to know that he's not stealing money from my church. I want to know that he's an honest person. I want to know that he's dealing fairly with people that we do business with or people that he counsels with.
[time=1608] I need to know that as a member of this church. Don't you? Don't you want your pastoral staff doing those things? So this is a good thing.
[time=1617] I want to know this thing. In fact, Pharisees were taught to pray this way, is that you thank God for the things he has given you.
[time=1624] Psalms David says, I thank you that I'm fearfully and wonderfully made. So, a Pharisee was just doing what he's been taught to do. Thank you, God, for these things in my life.
[time=1637] But he's missing something. He's missing the contact with God. Notice who he prays to. He's praying this to who? To himself.
[time=1647] Did you notice that? The Pharisees stood and was praying this to himself. So he wasn't praying to God. He's praying this to himself. Enter the bad guy, the tax collector.
[time=1658] The tax collector standing some distance away was even unwilling to lift up his eyes to heaven, but was beating his breath saying, God be merciful to me, the sinner, the twist, the cringe factor.
[time=1675] This is where, if we were standing in the back and we could see the crowd, we'd see squirming happen. We'd see them pulling their robes like this.
[time=1682] We'd see them, you know, if they had the turban, they'd fix it. I mean, we would see them squirming because they know they've just been had.
[time=1689] Because the Pharisee, who they respected, the tax collector, who they found repulsive, just went like this.
[time=1699] Because this is the issue. As a good Jew, standing in that synagogue, listening to this, we know that your heart condition, the humble heart, is the primary focus that God wants.
[time=1712] It's called kavana. It's a Jewish term. It's called kavana. I think it's going to come up here on the screen.
[time=1718] Kavana. It doesn't, we'll keep going. The definition of kavana is heart direction. This is your heart direction. What direction is your heart pointing?
[time=1728] Does God have your full concentration in your mind? Is your heart directed towards God? That's called kavana.
[time=1736] To a Jew, this was everything. If your kavana was not directed towards God, you had a very serious problem on your hands.
[time=1747] Deuteronomy 6.4 is the mantra of the Jewish nation. If we're standing back in that synagogue, we know Deuteronomy 6.4.
[time=1755] Here, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. We know that that is the main verse. That is the mission statement of our nation.
[time=1764] That is so important that when you say that you are acknowledging, I am your family. Our God is our God, and He is the only God.
[time=1774] That is a serious acknowledgement. But when they said that, and they called on God, and they said to God, "God, you are our God. You are the only God."
[time=1784] When they said that, they were calling on God's name. They took that very seriously. Do you call on God's name and not have that kavana directed towards God was a crucial, crucial mistake.
[time=1798] Deuteronomy 5 has a ten commandments in it, so we're just a chapter before Deuteronomy 6.4.
[time=1806] Commandment number three, what does it say about God's name? Do not take the name of the Lord in vain. Do not misuse God's name.
[time=1816] What does that mean? That's just not about swearing or cursing. That's using God's name carelessly.
[time=1823] It's saying it, but not really meaning anything by it. It's using it flippantly. It's just throwing it around and it's not really thinking about what you're saying.
[time=1833] That is misusing God's name in vain. Well, Dave, I mean, when I get mad, you know, that may slip here, or I may tell God what to do to somebody and where to send them.
[time=1843] I mean, I don't mean anything by it. That's the point. That is the point God is making.
[time=1850] If you don't mean to call on me, then don't use my name. I deserve more than that. I should be honored. I should be revered more than for you to use my name flippantly.
[time=1860] If you're going to call my name and I'm going to come to you, you better be directed and fully concentrated on me.
[time=1867] Otherwise, don't do it. That's the point. That's misusing God's name. Kavana was crucial.
[time=1877] In fact, here at Real Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. If they were even walking and they heard someone say that, or they start saying that, they would stop.
[time=1886] Just to make sure that their Kavana was directly focused on God and their full concentration on God, they would stop walking.
[time=1893] They would stop everything they're doing with this verse. With this, it's called Shema. This verse is called their Shema.
[time=1899] In fact, when they would do blessings, everything was ritualistic, and the Jewish prayers were all written down. And so when they would give a blessing on a home, they would say, "Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one."
[time=1910] Bless our family. The Lord our God, the Lord is one. Bless this. After every blessing, hear, O Israel. Very, very easy when you're doing something repetitive to your mind to wander, to something else.
[time=1924] It was crucial that this did not happen, because if you did, you were in violating commandment number three. You were violating God's law. You were misusing His name.
[time=1934] So it's crucial that the Kavana was directed towards God. Church, this morning, you've heard a couple of prayers already. You've sung some worship songs.
[time=1948] How great thou art. When you sang that, where was your mind? Were you fully singing to God? When you said, "How great thou art," it's like God came and said, "Yes, was your heart directed towards God?" So when He came to you, when you called to Him, did He have your full attention?
[time=1970] Church, if not, you were dangerously close to misusing His name. Your heart direction to God is what God is after.
[time=1984] The lifestyle of the Pharisee is great, but there was no Kavana. There was no contact with God. He prayed to Himself. The tax collector whose life was a mess, his Kavana was God have mercy on me, the sinner.
[time=2003] Notice, they were in the temple praying. Most likely, the Pharisee would bring His sacrifice. He'd go up to the altar, and there is where He would pray and give thanks for the things God has given to Him. While the sacrifice's throat was being slit from side to side, blood would just be pouring out. It was a mess.
[time=2023] The priest who is doing this, his robe is fully read by now in blood, but it was a symbol of the cost of his sin. That's going to create a general brokenness and humility before God.
[time=2037] And so the Pharisee to stand there and just pray to Himself, versus the tax collector who wouldn't even approach the altar, who's over here just saying, "I'm the sinner." That animal shouldn't be there. I should be there. I am the sinner. That's the heart direction God is looking for.
[time=2058] If I were to ask you, which one are you? Jesus told a story. We identify with characters.
[time=2072] Let me just be candid with you. Wednesday morning, I'm about to tell you the exact time. I knew where I was at 1030. I almost called Kelly Bird, the senior pastor here, and I almost backed out of speaking here this morning.
[time=2085] I pulled up to the corner of Maple Crest in state at a red light, pulled up, and looked to my right, and there's an old beat-up car, and there's a guy in it, and I noticed he was smoking.
[time=2100] I just got to be thinking, what are you doing? You're going to kill yourself with those things. Then I just kept going with it.
[time=2110] I said, how much money do you spend on those things? You could at least get your car washed.
[time=2117] Let alone fix the tail light that's broken, fix that scratch. I mean, what a waste. Then all of a sudden, I am the Pharisee.
[time=2130] When pastors are pretenders, I was pretending. I was the pastor who was pretending.
[time=2138] I thought, how dare I get behind this pulpit and teach you about something that I don't get myself? Who am I? What kind of credibility does this bring? What kind of authority can I possibly teach with?
[time=2152] When I'm sitting here saying, I am the Pharisee. I'm the pretender here. I'm not this one who has the right Kavana. I'm over here praying to my—look, I'm judging this guy.
[time=2164] I thought about calling him up and saying, I can't do this. I just can't do it.
[time=2170] Then I think God just brought to my memory the following character, the tax collector. God have mercy on me, the sinner.
[time=2182] I just slumped in my seat and I just said, Lord, I am the sinner. It's not over there. It's me. I'm the pretender.
[time=2193] That is what God is after from his church. He wants people who are full attention to him. When they call his name and he comes to hear, they're talking to him. They're listening to him. That is what he's after.
[time=2209] Psalm 51 says, "For you do not delight in sacrifice. Otherwise, I would give it. You are not pleased with birth offering. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, a broken and contrite heart. Oh God, you will not despise."
[time=2224] Contemporary English version says, "Offering and sacrifices are not what you want. The way to please you is to feel sorrow deep in our hearts. This is the kind of sacrifice you will not refuse."
[time=2238] This week, I just think I just realized that I need help with this. I'm wondering if this won't take care of this.
[time=2253] If this will create fruit here that is pleasing to God, that the honesty, the not cheating, the being faithful to my wife is a result in the fruit of a kavana that is directed to God 100%.
[time=2270] Do you think? Church, where are we? I have a privilege of working with this emerging generation, these 18 to 24-year-olds. They get it. This whole kavana thing, it's natural for them.
[time=2288] They do not get stuck on some of the forms and the methods. They connect with God through hymns, they connect with God through choruses, they connect with God through symbols, they connect with God through being in community with one another. They connect with God through silence alone.
[time=2306] They get this kavana thing. They are just struggling with this. Church, this is what I wonder. I wonder if we're not looking at this younger generation and we are not looking at this in their life and pointing a finger.
[time=2324] Just like I did when I pulled up to that intersection, this was not quite right. Instead of filling sorrow or wanting to help him, I judged him. The Pharisee was not helping the tax collector. He was judging the tax collector.
[time=2341] I just wonder if maybe we as a church, if we're not maybe looking at this younger generation and looking at their lifestyle and totally not seeing this that they got going on and wondering if they may be able to help us with this.
[time=2358] A few weeks ago, I asked during our encounter on Sunday night, I asked them, "What do you want the church to know about you and your journey with God? What do you want them to know about how you approach God?" Man, they told me. They wrote. This is just a fraction of what I got back.
[time=2378] I just want to read for you just a few of their thoughts about what they want you and us to know about them. We are the media generation. We're more wired. We're more connected than ever. We love to serve other people. We want to be loved and we want to be noticed just like anybody else.
[time=2399] I think we all grew up with different or at least stronger negative influences than any prior generation to be offered drugs on a school bus at 15. To be offered a beer at a birthday party at 16 should not be happening.
[time=2414] Persecution occurs in school, but it doesn't make an acceptance by my culture any less hard or hurtful. Our generation is surrounded by secret temptations at our fingertips. I'm wondering if she's talking about the Internet.
[time=2431] We are living in a world where we are constantly being stimulated. I personally am in need of an older woman who can be a mentor or an accountability partner. Over half of these people are asking, literally we're asking for help. I want help with my lifestyle.
[time=2450] My generation is being picked off by this culture. We are being assaulted day after day after day with images and values that are contrary to what we experience here and we need help. Church, will you help us? That is what they're saying.
[time=2475] I didn't have it so easy. And to survive in this world, we try to fall on God, but the world is falling on us most of the time. Twenty-three year old. Twenty-two year old.
[time=2486] It talks about I think girls in particular think sexy is the way to be the only desirable and beautiful and normal. It feels like there isn't a way to escape that particular expectancy from everyone else. Maybe we look at how they dress and we think we never would have dressed like that.
[time=2504] She's acknowledging that, but she's asking for help. Can you give me another value? Can you give me another standard church? Twenty-two year old. A nineteen year old says culture says be open with sin as in sex and drugs. And as a Christian, it's hard not to get caught up in it because it's so open and acceptable to do those things.
[time=2525] It's very hard as a struggling Christian who has already messed up in almost every way to get back to where I was when I was younger.
[time=2534] I want to have close relationships with people I go to church with. I want to know the pastor and others. I want them to know me, my name, my joys, sorrows, struggles. I would really like to have this.
[time=2546] It would be great to be part of an extended family. I'll be more inclined to participate and give back if I knew the people I worshiped and worked with. And they knew me. That is the crave. They want to be part of this church. They want to be connected to this community.
[time=2564] I got permission to talk about this last story as long as I kept it anonymous. There was a beautiful young woman who started coming from the counter and she wasn't from this area and the reason she had told us was because she wanted to move closer to family.
[time=2582] As kind of weeks went by, we got the rest of the story. She moved from out of state because she was advised to because her ex, her fiance that she had broken up with tried to kill her two times.
[time=2599] And she was advised to move out for her own safety. And so she came to Fort Wayne, not knowing anybody. Comes to encounter, not knowing anybody. And an older woman came alongside her and just did life with her, just became her friend.
[time=2618] And this was an email that she was willing to share with me that she gave me permission to share with you.
[time=2622] I know very little about the whole Christian thing. I began reading the Bible to find out more. But the more I read, the more confused I got and I still get.
[time=2633] Some people at a church I tried to go to treated me like I was horrible because I lived with my ex. That's why I got turned off to the whole church thing.
[time=2642] But I've really felt like something is missing. I'm not even really sure what it is, but I'm really drawn to the church and I'm drawn to Christians.
[time=2650] I'm drawn to learning more about God. Basically, I don't understand. Could you answer this question for me?
[time=2657] Are the people right when they say that God would love me no matter what I did or those other people right, that God hates me for the way I have screwed up my life?
[time=2669] That confusion should not be exist in someone this young. It's a 23-year-old.
[time=2674] A couple of weeks ago, Dave was talking about our relationship with God. When does that begin? Is that something we are born into like a natural family or is there something we need to do or know to get into the family?
[time=2688] Do you hear? I want this. I crave this, but I don't know how. I know, and this kills me. I know that Jesus died for my sins.
[time=2698] But why? I really like the Easter story. It is my favorite thing I have ever heard, but nothing explains why.
[time=2706] I mean, nothing I have done was worth anyone dying. I just don't get that. I am not worth that.
[time=2715] I am really trying to turn my life around to be a better person, but it seems that no matter how much I try, I can't be good enough to make God love me.
[time=2726] What am I doing wrong? Just this week I had three guys ask me if I would disciple them, if I'd mentor them.
[time=2739] You know what my answer was? I can't. I don't have time. This girl here, this story, this past weekend, she fully surrendered her life to Christ.
[time=2768] That was a week ago. You know my number one prayer this week has been? It's not for this time spent with you.
[time=2775] It's not that God would speak through me to you. That's been number two, but number one has been Lord.
[time=2783] Please send her someone, an older woman, to do life with her. Please, she doesn't need a Bible scholar.
[time=2792] She doesn't need a Bible study, per se. She needs someone who will come alongside her and love her.
[time=2799] And be Jesus to her. Be the church to her.
[time=2806] Church, the pa, they pass a pa, says on many different occasions, older women teach younger women.
[time=2816] Older men encourage the younger men. Church, where are you?
[time=2824] Men, where are you? Older women, where are you at?
[time=2831] This generation is pleading for help. They look at your lifestyle. That's what they want.
[time=2838] They got this, but they're being picked apart here, and they're asking us for help.
[time=2846] Will you help them? They will not ask forever. The window is closing.
[time=2853] Will they will find their answers somewhere else? The church, can we stand up and give them the answers that they're craving for?
[time=2862] Just maybe, just maybe, maybe we will get this with them. My guess is most of us identify with the Pharisee.
[time=2874] I do. I'll be honest with you. I'm that pastor of our pretending. More than I am the other one.
[time=2884] But working with this emerging generation, they're kavana that they have. It's challenging me like crazy.
[time=2892] It's awesome. I love it, because I'm beginning to see how they do this, and I'm experiencing new things this way through them.
[time=2902] But at the same time, by doing life with them, they're getting this from my wife and I.
[time=2908] We meet in our basement. We're not going to be able to meet there very much longer. We're growing out of it.
[time=2911] But they're seeing what a husband and wife, how they treat each other. They're seeing how we parent our kids.
[time=2917] They're seeing these things, and they're asking questions about that, and I'm getting this.
[time=2923] So I'm privileged to be working with them.
[time=2928] There's another concept I want to bring up. You may have seen me hold this up and wondered what's up with this.
[time=2935] How many of you have ever sold a home, either by yourself or through a real estate agent? You've owned your home and then you've sold it.
[time=2941] You know what I'm talking about when this is a huge relief when you can put this in your front yard.
[time=2947] When you can put this in your front yard, all of a sudden there's this burden that is lifted, and now you can live for the future.
[time=2955] You can live your life and think about future. You're not stuck on thinking about when this is going to happen or what that's going to happen.
[time=2964] There's another word for this. It's called paid in full.
[time=2969] In Jewish society, if you had a bill or if you had a debt and it got paid off, they would write on the front of it, paid in full.
[time=2977] And some scenarios they'd write sold. There is a Hebrew or Aramic word that represents this.
[time=2984] It's called, "It is finished." Have you heard that before, Church? Yes, we have.
[time=2992] In fact, we're celebrating the season where a baby came down and the whole purpose was to get to that point where he could say, "It is finished."
[time=3000] Sold. You were bought at a price. This moral debt that we have amassed in life has been lifted because a baby came down with the purpose of living a life to be able to say, "It is finished."
[time=3018] We sing a song today called "Alleluia, What a Saviour." And Beth, if you could put those words up there, says, "Man as sorrows, what a name for the Son of God who came, ruined sinners to reclaim, "Alleluia, what a Savior, bearing shame and scoffing rude, in my place condemned, he stood, sealed my pardon with his blood, Alleluia, what a Savior."
[time=3042] Guilty, vile and helpless, we, spotless, lamb of God was he. Full atonement, can it be? "Alleluia, what a Savior."
[time=3055] Lifted up was he to die. It is finished was his cry. Paid in full, sold. This young lady experienced it is finished.
[time=3069] The burden is gone. A legal transaction happened. Live for the future. Move ahead. It is finished. Sold. There's relief in that. Is that not right?
[time=3085] So where do we go from here? I'd like to give you three very, very specific applications. And I'm going to ask Dave if he can come up now in the band to come up.
[time=3102] I believe most of us probably need help with the kavana, with this heart direction, being fully concentrated, that when I call in the name of the Lord, when I pray, when I worship, help me to really concentrate into fully make contact with God, and this will be ironed out.
[time=3120] We have the younger generation who's got this, but needs help, needs mentored, needs someone who's older, a woman who's older, a man who's older, to help them with this.
[time=3131] And you know, when, as any discipleship relationship, as we help them with this, they start helping us with this. It's reciprocal.
[time=3140] So here's my challenge to you, church. Older men do life with a younger man. Older women do life with a younger woman.
[time=3152] We have a children's ministries. We have a school. Men in particular. I want to address you because this is close to me.
[time=3160] There are young boys in our school and in our children's ministry who are fatherless.
[time=3168] Do you realize the impact you could have if you just spent two hours a month being a father to the fatherless?
[time=3177] Can you imagine what that would do to you and your family? Women. They are young women in middle school and high school who are going through changes and they're not sure what this looks like and what that looks like who desperately need an older woman who's been there to walk them in through that and just do life with them.
[time=3197] We're not talking about a major Bible study. We're not talking about you have to be a scholar. We're just talking about doing life together.
[time=3204] I think Trisha's story is unbelievable. I'm so glad that here you have a single mom who is the hero.
[time=3212] I'm so glad that we have a church that doesn't have to be this perfect married couple who's never made a mistake and I go like that.
[time=3220] I fit that category, not the never made a mistake, but we're married. I love that we have a single mom who did something great and we can look at that and applaud that.
[time=3230] We need people like the Trisha's to take younger people. Will you do that?
[time=3237] Rafael will be standing back in the children's ministry department. If you feel led to do that, I want to encourage you today.
[time=3243] Do not let the son go down on this commitment you're going to make. Go there and talk to him this morning about it.
[time=3250] Don't wait. You're not making any commitment right now except to go talk to him and say I feel like I have enough to give.
[time=3258] I am rich in experience. God has blessed me with a great life. I want to give that to somebody. I want to help a younger child.
[time=3268] What does that look like? Rafael will walk through that with you. Something you may say, maybe not children, but maybe middle school high school.
[time=3277] Rick Vance and Ken Wester will be here. Ken's going to be down here. Again, the student ministry is right there.
[time=3285] I asked him just Thursday, do you have any middle school high school students who need a mentor?
[time=3292] He goes, you've got to be kidding that you got to ask. They're there. They are all over the place.
[time=3300] College age, maybe you're interested in college age and some of these stories. I'm going to be up here.
[time=3306] We're not asking you to teach a Bible study. We're not going to start a new program. I promise you, we are not starting another event or another program.
[time=3315] All I'm looking for is could you maybe for two hours a week meet at an anchor room, meet at higher grounds, meet at the mill, meet somewhere and say, how are you doing?
[time=3325] And for an hour they'll talk about how they're doing. Then maybe open up your Bible, read a chapter and discuss it together, discover something together.
[time=3334] That's doing life together. That's all that needs to happen. That's all they're asking for.
[time=3342] Older men encourage younger men. Older women teach younger women. Church, let's rise to the occasion.
[time=3353] Let's respond to their pleas for help. If we don't help, I don't know where they're going to go and get the right answers.
[time=3364] Would you please stand? We're going to have an opportunity to sing again. So here's another chance.
[time=3380] I want to encourage you to do this. I want you to, during this song, I really want you to, this kavana, this being fully directed to God, fully concentrated on a hymn.
[time=3392] When you sing, do that. If you're not there, quit singing. But I want you to do this. I want you to go and ask God to search your heart.
[time=3404] Have you been calling on His name? Have you been calling out for Him? And then your mind goes over here.
[time=3412] You start thinking about this person. You start thinking about this that's coming up. And maybe your response needs to be, God, have mercy on me, the sinner. Not a sinner, the sinner.
[time=3430] But when you start singing, man, encourage you to worship the God that's coming down to respond to your call. Let's pray.
[time=3445] Father, as a church, we come before you corporately, and I know with many of us, boy, we're guilty. I am the sinner. I'm the chief sinner here, and I've been pretending too many times to count.
[time=3466] Would you have mercy on me? Would you have mercy on us as a body? Would you show us what it means to pray to you in full want accord? Would you show us what it means to worship you in spirit and in truth?
[time=3484] I pray for anyone here who needs to get right with you. The humble is who are justified. Thank you for what you're doing in this place right now, Holy Spirit, thank you for moving.
[time=3502] And Father, we lift up our voices to you, and we worship you, and I pray that you would be pleased and honored and glorified as we worship you and get right with you.
[time=3514] And Jesus, it's because of what you said on the cross, it is finished, that it gives us the opportunity to approach your throne.
[time=3529] Oh Lord my God, when I am awesome, wonder, consider all the words my hands have made. I see the stars.
[time=3548] I hear the rolling from birth, I part throughout the universe this day.
[time=3557] Then it seems my soul might save your God to me. How great thou are. How great thou are.
[time=3585] God is somehow squaring, send him to die.
[time=3615] [BLANK_AUDIO]
