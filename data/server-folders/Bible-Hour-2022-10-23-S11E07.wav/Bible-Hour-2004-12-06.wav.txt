[time=30] (dramatic music)
[time=60] (upbeat music) - He made himself nothing, and he humbled himself,
[time=89] and he took on the nature of a servant by becoming a human.
[time=94] And he humbled himself again by becoming obedient to death.
[time=99] Do you understand that God does not die, and so when Christ becomes obedient to death, it's an act of humility.
[time=107] And not only did he just simply die, but he took on a humiliating kind of death, death on a cross.
[time=117] In Isaiah chapter 14, on the contrary, the prophet is describing Lucifer, and it says that he wanted to be like the Most High.
[time=131] You see, he was a character, an angel, a creature of God who had no right to attain equality with God, but he was striving to be like the Most High.
[time=144] It said that he wanted to make a throne on the holy mountain that was sacred, and Lucifer, the creature of God had no business doing that.
[time=153] And here's what happens with the attitude of Lucifer and Isaiah chapter 14, God humbles him.
[time=160] Lucifer wanted to be exalted, and so he gets humbled to the extreme.
[time=166] And then Christ, who being in very nature God, but didn't consider equality with God, something to be grasped, and kept humbling himself.
[time=174] Philippians 2 says, "Therefore God exalted him "to the highest place, and gave him the name "that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus Christ, "every knee shall bow in every tongue confess in heaven, "and on earth, and under the earth, "that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God, the Father." And so he goes from utter humiliation to total exaltation.
[time=195] And what does Jesus say?
[time=199] But whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
[time=205] God's been teaching me a lot about humility recently, and how important it is to have the attitude of Christ.
[time=216] And I hope that this Christmas season, as we recall the incarnation of the God of the universe, the one who sits enthroned above the circle of the earth, but humbles himself to be inside the womb of a girl, and to be born into a barn, and to be worshiped by shepherds that nobody's heard of before.
[time=238] That we see in that humility, something to be mimicked and attitude, a posture to be taken on.
[time=246] Jenny's gonna sing for you a song, and then we're gonna sing it all together.
[time=252] And I want this to be our theme song, as holiday together, as a body, and as a family.
[time=257] Christ is a humble king, and that we want to take on that attitude for ourselves.
[time=262] (gentle piano music)
[time=283] [MUSIC - 96 seconds]
[time=384] Sing together.
[time=386] [MUSIC - 182 seconds]
[time=575] Father in heaven.
[time=579] We pray this morning that you and, that you would transform our hearts, and that you would transform our attitudes, and to be like Christ.
[time=593] And to mimic him in his humility.
[time=598] And Lord, that you would humble us, that you would make us aware of our lowly state.
[time=604] And God, we say together this morning that you alone are God, and we are not.
[time=611] That we acknowledge you as creator of everything.
[time=616] The sustainer of everything.
[time=620] And we pray, Lord Jesus, this morning, that you would teach us through your powerful word, to understand you better.
[time=627] [AMEN] (gentle music)
[time=650] (gentle music) - Well, good morning, everybody.
[time=667] It's great to be with you.
[time=668] Good to see all of you.
[time=670] I am looking forward.
[time=671] I gotta tell you, the last two weekends have been amazing, but I am so looking forward to the next three Sundays.
[time=676] You see the last two weekends, this one that we're in the midst of included.
[time=681] If you've been to the Christmas with Black Hawk presentation, you know that our theme is generations.
[time=687] And in that presentation, you see the generational impact that one grandmother had on a family, an impact of love, life, and truth.
[time=700] And as I have been thinking about generations, and as I have been thinking about these three Sundays, we're gonna get to have together.
[time=706] I have, in my mind, I feel like God has led me to the story of Jesus, this baby whose birth we celebrate this season.
[time=714] And as I look at the story of Jesus, as I read and study about Jesus and his coming, his birth, I began to look at and I began to consider his family.
[time=725] I don't know if you've done that ever before, really taking a look at the generations, if you will, that led up to him and the generational impact that that had and the story that's entailed when you look at his family.
[time=741] It's really quite interesting.
[time=743] And I wanna invite you to a three-week look at a generational tree like no other.
[time=751] I promise you, you've ever seen.
[time=754] And I wanna ask the question as we start.
[time=758] It's the question we've always gotta ask.
[time=760] It's the question you always want to ask as you consider things of this nature.
[time=764] What does God's word have to say?
[time=767] What does God's word have to say about Jesus and his earthly beginnings, his family, his lineage, his mother and the miraculous way in which he came near?
[time=780] What does God's word have to say?
[time=783] Three weeks is what we're gonna give this as we look at the miracle of his birth and the generations that came before and after.
[time=790] I want you to take these three weeks, if you would.
[time=792] Take these next three Sundays.
[time=794] I hope you're open to this.
[time=797] An opportunity to take the next three Sundays and see Jesus in a new light, allowing the story of his family to change your life and your family forever.
[time=812] Now, as I mentioned just a minute ago, if we're gonna take an intelligent and insightful look at Jesus and his birth, we've gotta begin with scripture, right?
[time=824] With the perfect, holy and preserved word of God.
[time=829] Let me just say that again, it's important that all of us would at least be on the same page as it relates to a beginning point.
[time=836] And again, if you're new around here, this is our beginning point.
[time=841] And I meant what I just said.
[time=844] I believe it with all of my heart.
[time=845] And at Black Hawk here, we believe deeply that the word of God is the perfect.
[time=852] There are no errors.
[time=853] There are no mistakes.
[time=856] Nothing misguiding, nothing misleading.
[time=861] We believe the word of God is perfect.
[time=864] And I hope you do.
[time=866] We believe it's perfect, we believe it's holy.
[time=868] The word holy means set a, what, set a, set a part.
[time=872] Any other book in the world like it?
[time=875] Any other book in the world is powerful as this book?
[time=879] Any other book is penetrating.
[time=880] Any other book is divine.
[time=882] Any other book, answer no.
[time=885] We believe it is absolutely perfect and completely holy, set a part.
[time=890] And it has been, this is the amazing thing.
[time=893] Over all the years, perfectly preserved.
[time=896] What you have, don't miss how amazing that is.
[time=902] What you have, I hope you've got one there.
[time=903] What you've got in your hands right there has been by God, sovereignly, providentially preserved for you.
[time=912] You have His word.
[time=914] And we have the privilege of coming to it again, reading it, studying it and looking into this life and this family of Jesus.
[time=924] Well, a good place to start.
[time=926] Any time you're gonna study or talk about Jesus and especially His earthly birth and His beginnings, a great place to begin as the gospels.
[time=933] And before we jump in, I wanna just make sure you understand some things about the gospels and it pertains to our study this morning.
[time=940] On the screen, you're gonna see the four gospels and what I wanna make sure you catch this morning is that with each of the four gospels, in God's mind and as God kind of oversaw and inspired the writing of Scripture, with each gospel, there was a specific intent.
[time=957] I mean, yes, the gospels in many ways are alike, but as you read through them, you begin to realize that there was a specific purpose that God had in mind as He works in the heart and mind and pen of the writer.
[time=970] As the inspiration takes place, there's a specific priority that rises to the top.
[time=975] And in Matthew, in Matthew, the specific intent was for you and I, the reader and those who read it in those days, to see Jesus as King.
[time=985] If you read through the book of Matthew, you see it again and again and again.
[time=989] Jesus is lifted up as Messiah.
[time=992] Messiah is the Hebrew word, the King, the one who had been promised, the one who was coming to reign, the one who was coming to rule.
[time=1000] In Matthew, the intent there is to paint Jesus with a picture of kingship.
[time=1004] In Mark, if you read Mark, the intent there is to lift up His humanity.
[time=1009] Most of you would understand that when Jesus comes, He comes, it's the miracle of Jesus.
[time=1015] He comes 100, He comes as 100% man, right?
[time=1020] Completely and absolutely and thoroughly human.
[time=1023] Hebrews 4 talks about how we have a sympathetic savior who understands and had been through all that we face and have seen, it's because He was human.
[time=1033] But He was at the same time 100% divine.
[time=1038] Mark lifts up his humanity.
[time=1041] We see the phrase often in Mark, the son of man.
[time=1044] Luke, if you go to Luke and you read through Luke, what's lifted up there about Christ is His servant's heart.
[time=1050] The priority and the importance of Him coming as a servant, one who came to be, not so much to be served, but to serve, to give.
[time=1062] And in John, you see the balance of Mark.
[time=1065] In John, you see Christ lifted up and portrayed as God, which He was 100% deity.
[time=1072] He was divine in every way while being human at the same time.
[time=1077] We will, this morning, jump in.
[time=1079] And if you've got your Bibles, open up to Matthew chapter one.
[time=1082] We will begin at Matthew chapter one.
[time=1084] You see in God's providential design, as He works through the inspiration of Scripture, He leads Matthew as we noted to lift up Jesus as King.
[time=1093] Now, this is a very important place to start because this was something so very, very important for the people then and now, but especially then to see.
[time=1105] You see, the Jews had been waiting for their King.
[time=1108] The Jews had been longing for their Messiah.
[time=1111] Scripture had predicted that He would come and it was time in their minds and in their hearts they had been waiting oh, so long for this Messiah to come and Matthew now begins to write.
[time=1122] And as we see the story unfold from Matthew's pen, so to speak, we see Jesus being lifted up.
[time=1128] We see Jesus being presented as we see Jesus as the King and consistent with that purpose of revealing Jesus to be the Messiah and the King of the Jews.
[time=1140] Matthew begins his gospel by showing Jesus is lineage, all right?
[time=1145] His family tree, he shows us this royal line of Israel.
[time=1150] If Jesus is to be heralded and proclaimed King, there must be proof that He comes from the recognized royal family.
[time=1161] And most of you know that the recognized royal family, as far as scriptures would teach, we knew that Messiah's royal line would begin with who?
[time=1170] David, through the prophet Nathan.
[time=1174] God promised that it would be David's descendants through whom he would bring the great King, who would ultimately reign over Israel and establish His eternal kingdom.
[time=1186] You can write this down and we'll see it on the screen.
[time=1188] Second Samuel, write that down, second Samuel, 7, 12, through the prophet Nathan.
[time=1193] David is told, you see it right there.
[time=1196] When your days, David, when your days are complete and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your descendant singular after you who will come forth from you, from your line, from your lineage and I will establish His kingdom.
[time=1217] Second Samuel, 7, 12, the promise, as most of you know, was not fulfilled in Solomon, David's son who succeeded him or in any other king that ruled in Israel or Judah.
[time=1231] And the people waited.
[time=1233] They waited for another one to be born of David's line to fulfill the prophecy at the time of Jesus' birth.
[time=1240] When Jesus was born, the Jews were still anticipating, still waiting upon the arrival of the promised monarch and the restored glory of His kingdom and many of them waited with the prophetic words of Isaiah in mind, a verse, a passage that maybe will be familiar to some, Isaiah chapter nine, verses six and seven.
[time=1260] They knew it had been said, "For a child will be born to us.
[time=1266] "A son will be given to us and the government "will rest on his shoulders." There you see the kingship.
[time=1273] And his name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.
[time=1279] And then it says in verse seven, "There will be no end to the increase of his government "or of peace on the throne of David and over his kingdom "to establish it and to uphold it with justice "and righteousness from then on and forevermore.
[time=1295] "Zeal of the Lord of hosts will accomplish this "and that is exactly what they were waiting for." So now we come to the beginning of Matthew and this whole story now is about to unfold.
[time=1309] God chooses to move at this time and place and so we begin here at the beginning of Matthew and a look at this amazing family that the Christ came out of.
[time=1322] In honor of God's word, would you stand this morning as we read Matthew one to 17?
[time=1328] And you're standing there thinking, wait a minute, did he just say one, one to 17?
[time=1332] Well, I did.
[time=1333] And I want you to bear with me here on this, okay?
[time=1336] This is a little abnormal.
[time=1338] And you're already looking ahead, you're going, oh my gosh, it's 17 verses of names.
[time=1344] And I kind of, I gotta admit, I've oftentimes in my study of the Bible gone past the names.
[time=1352] Anybody wanna admit to that?
[time=1354] I just, I see a page and I have a name and I go, okay, well we'll see, where's that pick back up here?
[time=1359] All right, now here we go.
[time=1362] And I gotta tell you, having looked at this for the last week and especially in this instance, Matthew one and even in Luke, let me just say this publicly, I stand corrected.
[time=1378] There is great truth to be gained.
[time=1385] And I hope this morning you'll open your heart and your mind to it, bear with me.
[time=1389] We're gonna read through all these names.
[time=1391] First of all, because I practiced them, okay?
[time=1393] And so you're gonna just give me the pleasure of reading these names 'cause I worked hard all week to get 'em right and I still messed up first hour.
[time=1401] But way above and beyond my pronunciation, I hope you'll just bear with me on this.
[time=1408] As we read through and then begin to talk about this, I think you'll see something that I believe will be encouraging for some of you.
[time=1415] It'll be new truth and I hope as a result of it will be as a family strengthened and encouraged.
[time=1423] Here we go, you ready?
[time=1424] Matthew one, one through 17.
[time=1427] The record of the genealogy of Jesus, the Messiah, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
[time=1435] Abraham was the father of Isaac and Isaac, the father of Jacob and Jacob, the father of Judah and his brothers.
[time=1442] Judah was the father of Perez and Zera by Tamar.
[time=1446] Perez was the father of Hezron and Hezron the father of Ram.
[time=1450] Ram was the father of Aminadab and Aminadab the father of Naishan and Naishan the father of Salmon.
[time=1457] I thought Salmon sounded better than salmon.
[time=1459] He may have been salmon but we'll just call him Salmon.
[time=1464] Kinda gives it a nice little Hebrew flair, doesn't it?
[time=1467] Salmon was the father of Boaz by Rahab.
[time=1473] Boaz was the father of Obed by Ruth and Obed the father of Jesse.
[time=1480] And Jesse was the father of who?
[time=1482] David, the who, the king.
[time=1486] David was the father of Solomon by Bathsheba.
[time=1490] Did you know that?
[time=1493] David was the father of Solomon by Bathsheba who had been the wife of Uriah.
[time=1500] Salmon was the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abidja and Abidja the father of Asa.
[time=1506] Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Joram and Joram the father of Huziah.
[time=1511] Huziah was the father of Jotham and Jotham the father of Ahaz.
[time=1515] And Ahaz the father of Hezekiah and Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh.
[time=1519] Manasseh the father of Amon and Amon the father of Josiah and Josiah became the father of Jekoniah and his brothers at the time of the deportation to Babylon.
[time=1534] After the deportation to Babylon, you know, I'll tell you one thing as we start here on 12, after the deportation to Babylon they got wacky with their names.
[time=1542] Wow, here we go.
[time=1546] Say a little prayer for me right now.
[time=1548] Jekoniah became the father of Sheeltyl and Sheeltyl the father of Zerubabel.
[time=1554] Zerubabel was the father of Abihood and Abihood the father of El, see it happened again, Alliah Kim and Alliah Kim the father of Azor.
[time=1564] Azor was the father of Zaidok.
[time=1566] Zaidok the father of Akim and Akim the father of Eliyud.
[time=1569] Eliyud the father of Eliyazor and Eliyazor the father of Matan.
[time=1573] Matan the father of Jacob.
[time=1574] Jacob was the father of Joseph, the husband of who?
[time=1579] By whom who was born?
[time=1582] Who was called the what?
[time=1583] The Messiah, the Christ.
[time=1586] So all the generations from Abraham to David are 14 generations.
[time=1594] From David to the deportation to Babylon, 14 generations.
[time=1599] And from the deportation to Babylon to the Messiah, 14 generations.
[time=1605] Let's pray.
[time=1608] Father God, just reading through these 17 verses.
[time=1617] I know for many in the room, God, we are already, even as we begin this study, we are already amazed at the order and the planning and the providence and the way in which you work and move through the lives of people.
[time=1637] A lot of people.
[time=1639] A lot of generations in God and you had it all along in mind in this generation, in this genealogy, God that it would lead to the King, that it would lead to the King, the promised one who would come to free his people, to bring salvation.
[time=1655] And God, we are today standing here, so many years removed from that activity, still so very grateful for what it brought.
[time=1663] So grateful for your son.
[time=1665] So thankful that you gave him.
[time=1667] And so thankful that we can celebrate the season, his birth and his life.
[time=1673] God, I pray this morning that every ear and every heart would be open to the uncompromised, holy, preserved truth of your word.
[time=1685] God, that it would change us.
[time=1688] God, that we would see things today that you would use to allow us the privilege of living differently today and tomorrow.
[time=1696] We pray you would do this.
[time=1698] God, I pray that we would be receptive in your son's name, we pray.
[time=1702] [AMEN] You can have a seat.
[time=1705] You know, somebody mentioned to me after first hour, I haven't seen the article, but I guess in one of the national news publications, maybe it was time that there is an article, maybe this week having to do with this issue of Christ's genealogy and the difference between the one in Matthew and the one in Luke.
[time=1721] Now, I haven't seen the article, but I hear it was a bit confusing, at least for the individual whom I spoke with after last service.
[time=1728] Let me just say it to you this way, see if you can follow along here.
[time=1732] Matthew's genealogy presents a descending.
[time=1736] Think about that, presents a descending line from Abraham through David, through Joseph to Jesus, who is called verse 16, "The Christ." Luke's genealogy presents an ascending line starting from Jesus and going back through David, Abraham and even all the way back to who?
[time=1758] Adam, the son of God, you see that in Luke three.
[time=1761] Luke's record is apparently traced from Mary's side, all right?
[time=1771] If you look in Luke three, the Eli mentioned there is Joseph's father-in-law and therefore Mary's natural father.
[time=1778] Matthew's intent is to validate Jesus' royal claim, right?
[time=1782] He's lifting Christ up as king.
[time=1784] Matthew's intent is to validate Jesus' royal claim by showing his legal dissent from David through Joseph who was Jesus' legal father.
[time=1796] Luke's intent is to trace Jesus' actual royal blood ancestry through his mother, thereby establishing his racial lineage from David.
[time=1807] Matthew follows the royal line through David and Solomon, David's son and successor to the throne.
[time=1813] Luke follows the royal line through Nathan, another son of David.
[time=1818] Jesus was therefore the blood descendant of David through Mary and the legal descendant of David through Joseph.
[time=1827] Isn't that amazing?
[time=1829] God had it covered either way, it's all there.
[time=1835] Absolutely, thoroughly and completely qualified.
[time=1840] Over and above all others, Jesus perfectly qualified to take the throne that was rightfully his, the throne of David, promised through Nathan to David in Samuel.
[time=1855] Well, it says there that he is called the Christ in verse 16.
[time=1860] You see that?
[time=1861] By whom Jesus was born who is called the Christ or the Messiah.
[time=1865] Christos is the word there, Christ.
[time=1868] It's the Greek form of the Hebrew word Mashiach.
[time=1870] It's where we get our English word Messiah, which means anointed one and people.
[time=1874] He was that.
[time=1877] He was the anointed one.
[time=1878] In Israel's culture, prophets, priests and kings were anointed.
[time=1883] And Jesus was anointed as all three, prophet, priest and king.
[time=1886] He was the anointed one, the Mashiach.
[time=1890] And yet because of their unbelief, this is where it gets, so tragic, this is where it gets so sad, because of their unbelief and because of their misunderstanding of the word, their misunderstanding of the very scripture they had learned.
[time=1903] Many Jews refused to recognize Jesus as the Christ, as the Mashiach.
[time=1910] And there were many reasons behind the rejection that so many offered.
[time=1914] Some rejected him for the very reason that his parents were known to them.
[time=1919] See, there was this thought that this guy would come out of nowhere, that nobody would know him, nobody would know from where he came, nobody would know his parents or his lineage.
[time=1928] When he went back to his hometown of Nazareth, he began teaching them, it says, in their synagogue, so that they became astonished and said, where did this man get his wisdom?
[time=1938] And these miraculous powers is not this, the carpenter's son, is not his mother called Mary, and his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas, and his sisters, are they not well known and with us?
[time=1953] You see that verbiage there in Matthew chapter 13.
[time=1959] On another occasion, others in Jerusalem said of Jesus, the rulers do not really know, but this is the Christ, do they?
[time=1968] However, we know where this man is from, but whenever the Christ may come, no one will know.
[time=1973] John seven, see, they're confused.
[time=1976] A short while later, some of the multitude, therefore, when they heard these words were saying, this certainly is the prophet, others were saying, this is the Christ, still others were saying, surely, the Christ is not going to come from Galilee, is he?
[time=1990] Confusion, misunderstanding, still others.
[time=1996] Some others may be better taught in the scriptures, but unaware of Jesus' lineage and birthplace said, has not the scriptures said that the Christ comes from the offspring of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was.
[time=2012] Well, yeah, that's what it said, and that's exactly where he had come from, but they were unaware.
[time=2020] He was right there in front of them, and so many of them said no.
[time=2025] This genealogy that we just read establishes the Messiah's royal line.
[time=2032] Matthew's intent is not to have you or I digress into a study of each and every name, but instead to show that all of these individuals point to the royal team.
[time=2042] Remember Matthew's purpose, the kingship of Christ, prophetically he had been promised with exact lineage and the necessary family ties, and biblically, historically, he had come.
[time=2056] So in these first 17 verses, we see more than just names.
[time=2061] We see a royal line, we see the kingship of Mosheia clearly set forth, and the reality confirmed that the king and sovereign lord which had been promised had been delivered, but you know what?
[time=2074] As I read those 17 verses and I read them again
[time=2080] and again and again, and then I picked up this book and I picked up that book and I listened to some things that had been taught and said about this passage,
[time=2095] and as I read and as I prayed and as I listened, it began to be very, very clear to me, and I hope it will be to you as well this morning, that there is even more in this text
[time=2112] than just the established royal line of Mosheia.
[time=2117] Very important, but I would suggest to you today that as you look at these names, and maybe you should just real quick kind of just start going back through there, just looking through those names 'cause every one of those names represents a story, my friend, and if you know anything about any of the stories mentioned in those names, I would submit to you that what we see in these 17 verses above and beyond the royal lineage is the grace of God.
[time=2146] The grace of God at work in some amazing
[time=2152] and miraculous ways, in a legacy of names and lives leading to a savior, we find the graciousness of God.
[time=2162] And the graciousness of our Lord, our Christ as well,
[time=2168] you see, Jesus was sent to be a king of grace and compassion, and what we realize as we read through this is that he was sent by a father of grace and compassion.
[time=2180] And the people God chose to be his ancestors, the people God and his sovereignty set in place, the names and the stories, the individuals he chooses to use to set up this royal line when you begin to look at it
[time=2199] and when you begin to consider it and when you begin to study it, you just sit there and you go, wow, what a God.
[time=2207] What a gracious God, you begin to see the wonder of his grace and you know what?
[time=2214] It gives hope to all sinners like you and me.
[time=2219] It really does, so let's look at it this way.
[time=2222] Four things I wanna show you over the next few weeks, we see God's grace in the choice of one woman.
[time=2229] We see God's grace in the descendants of two men,
[time=2235] and I won't say anything about that, I'll leave you thinking about that one, who the two might be.
[time=2240] We see God's amazing grace, his miraculous grace in the choice of one woman, the descendants of two men, the history of three eras and the inclusion of four, pretty amazing outcasts that he uses.
[time=2258] And I won't speak for you, but I found myself thankful that he used an outcast or two as he established the one who would save us all.
[time=2270] Let's jump in number one, what do you say?
[time=2272] We see God in these 17 verses of names, we see God's grace, number one in the choice of one woman.
[time=2279] In the choice of one woman, look at verse 16 again, Jacob was the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary by whom Jesus was born.
[time=2290] People, God shows his grace by choosing a girl
[time=2297] like Mary to be the mother of Jesus.
[time=2301] Just say that to yourself just quietly there for just a moment.
[time=2304] The mother, we understand it was a miraculous deal, but still she bore him, she cuddled him, she raised him, she taught him, she cleaned him, she 100% human, right?
[time=2322] He chooses a girl to be the mother of Jesus Christ.
[time=2327] There's a lot of grace there.
[time=2332] You know, let me say it to you differently, I just thinking about it, I just wrote this down, you know what I said, as a matter of fact, he shows his grace by allowing anyone.
[time=2342] Any human being, he shows his grace by allowing anybody
[time=2351] let alone a 13 year old girl to be the mother, the caretaker, the provider for his son, the Messiah.
[time=2360] Let's just do a visual.
[time=2364] Please don't be embarrassed, gals, stay with me here.
[time=2369] If you're between the ages of 12, if you're 12, 13, 14, every scholar, every book you read puts you somewhere in there, if you're 12, 13, 14, and you're a young lady, would you just stand quietly in this room, wherever you are in the room, just stand quietly.
[time=2387] Go ahead, just everybody be real quiet.
[time=2390] And then gals, thank you, just stay standing, just for a moment.
[time=2393] And this is, listen now, this is not, stay standing, this is not to any way diminish these beautiful, wonderful girls who are standing, all right?
[time=2402] But just look at 'em.
[time=2404] I mean, I want you to look wherever you're seated, just look, this is what God chose.
[time=2410] God chose to use a 12, 13, 14 year old girl to mother, care for, and birth the son of God.
[time=2421] Girls, thank you, you can sit down.
[time=2423] And I love all of you, and I'm thankful for all of you.
[time=2426] And girls, I would say this about me if it were me.
[time=2429] So this is not a knock on you, ladies.
[time=2431] He deserved better than any of us.
[time=2435] You understand what I'm saying?
[time=2437] He chose a 12, 13, 14 year old girl
[time=2443] to be the mother of his son.
[time=2446] Although descended from the royal line of David, Mary was an ordinary.
[time=2453] It's important that we understand this.
[time=2454] There are so many teachings that would kind of promote a different picture of Mary.
[time=2459] Although descended from the royal line of David, Mary was an ordinary, unknown young woman.
[time=2467] Contrary to claims of her own immaculate conception, there are some teachings out there that would say she herself was immaculately conceived.
[time=2476] Contrary to that, Mary was just as much a sinner as all other human beings ever born.
[time=2485] Now she was likely much better morally and spiritually
[time=2491] than others her age than most of her time but she was not sinless.
[time=2498] She was not perfect.
[time=2500] She was deeply devout and faithful to the Lord as she demonstrates by her humble and submissive response to the angel's announcement.
[time=2508] You can turn there real quick, just go over to Luke.
[time=2511] You can see how this 12, 13, 14 year old girl
[time=2519] who was visited by the angel of God, told that her entire life is now going to change, told that she's gonna have some unbelievably mystical experience with the spirit of God whereby she'll become pregnant with the Son of God with all of her life and all of her future drastically and forever changed.
[time=2539] And this young girl says, "Behold." Verse 38 of Luke 1, "Behold the bond slave of the Lord."
[time=2548] May it be done to me according to your word and the angel departed from her.
[time=2555] Faithful to the Lord, submissive and humble to the Lord.
[time=2561] But Mary like every other human being who ever lived needed a savior.
[time=2569] As she herself acknowledged at the very beginning of her song of praise often called the Magnificat, look at that, Luke 1, 46.
[time=2578] You see in 46, 47, and 48, this acknowledged need of a savior.
[time=2583] It says, "My soul exalts the Lord and my spirit "has rejoiced in God my what?
[time=2590] "My savior, for he has had regard "for the humble state of his bond slave." Now I came across some things here at this point.
[time=2602] I'm gonna just stop us.
[time=2604] It's not gonna be a true tangent.
[time=2606] It's not gonna be a digression.
[time=2608] I just, you know, I've looked at this Magnificat.
[time=2612] I have read these words offered up by this 12, 13, 14 year old girl many a time.
[time=2621] It just so happened that this time as I'm reading through it and thinking through these issues preparing for our time this morning that I was able to do some reading and do some listening.
[time=2630] I was incredibly challenged by the teaching of a pastor in Michigan who I listened to often was even referred by him as I listened to him to some other resources that I had a chance to look at and think through.
[time=2644] And there's something here that I want you to see.
[time=2649] There's something here in this passage that we've come to that I want every person in this room to not miss.
[time=2658] And unless you do some digging, and unless you do some research, unless you do a little bit of study, you wouldn't just see it on the surface.
[time=2667] So I wanna share this with you if I can.
[time=2669] And here's how I'm gonna do this.
[time=2671] Open your Bibles, maybe they're already opened.
[time=2673] If you haven't opened it yet, go ahead and open it.
[time=2676] And if your Bible has cross references listed in the margins, then I wanna show you something.
[time=2685] If your Bible doesn't have cross references in the margins, then just listen, all right?
[time=2690] You don't, I promise you, you don't wanna miss this.
[time=2694] Okay, here's the first thing I want you to notice.
[time=2699] And it's a repeat, but you gotta have this in your mind as we go down this road, we're about to go down.
[time=2703] She was how old?
[time=2704] 12, 13, or 14?
[time=2707] 12, 13, 14 years of age.
[time=2711] You with me?
[time=2713] I want you to notice from 46 to 55 is what we've called the great Magnificant.
[time=2720] Mary's unbelievable response to this privilege that she's been given.
[time=2725] Now, watch this.
[time=2727] If you go through, let's start at 46.
[time=2729] And if instead of going through the text of 46 to 55, if you just begin to skim your way through the cross references, watch what happens.
[time=2739] 46 we see that she's quoting from 1 Samuel 2, 1 to 10.
[time=2745] And also, citing Psalm 34 verse two.
[time=2749] You go on to verse 47 of the Magnificant.
[time=2752] You see, she's pulling from Psalm 35 verse nine.
[time=2755] Habakkuk 3 verse 18.
[time=2758] If you go on to 48, you see that she's citing passages and reciting words from Psalm 138 verse six.
[time=2767] You go down to verse 50 of the Magnificant in the cross reference section.
[time=2771] You see, she's reciting and calling forth from her heart and her mouth is proclaiming Psalm 103 verse 17.
[time=2779] In verse 51, you see that she's bringing from inside of her.
[time=2783] She's reciting from Psalm 98 one, Psalm 118 verse 15.
[time=2788] In verse 52, she calls forth truth from Job chapter five verse 11.
[time=2794] In verse, how old is she?
[time=2795] 12 say it out loud, 12, 13 or 14.
[time=2801] Job five 11. In verse 53 of the Magnificant, she's calling out in a prayer.
[time=2807] This is not a, she's not reading here people.
[time=2810] This is a response from her heart.
[time=2814] In 53, verse 53 of the Magnificant, you see her calling from Psalm 107 nine.
[time=2819] From verse 55, Genesis 17, 19.
[time=2823] Psalm 132 11 and Genesis 17 seven.
[time=2832] How in the world does that happen?
[time=2837] You know, I'm not making a commentary
[time=2844] on the young ladies who stood up.
[time=2846] You know, I've got a 12 year old in my home.
[time=2849] You've got some 12 year olds and 13 year olds and 14 year olds that you know.
[time=2853] And at a point of unbelievable crisis, at a point of unbelievable tension, at a point where all of a sudden life changes and some news is given, what are they going to say?
[time=2866] What are they going to respond with?
[time=2870] As I listened this week and learned, I learned a lot this week.
[time=2876] I began to kind of go back into, I was taken back into the time of our Lord back into the customs and traditions of first century Jewish culture.
[time=2886] And here's some insight for you.
[time=2890] Something you may want to just kind of hold on to.
[time=2893] It would have been typical, not only typical, it would have actually in the Jewish faith at that time been required.
[time=2900] See, they valued education greatly.
[time=2903] Not only education, but specifically the spiritual education that would come from the study of what they call the Torah, the first five books of the Old Testament.
[time=2913] This was the word of God.
[time=2915] This was something valuable and precious to these people.
[time=2918] This was something that they lived for, looked to and held on to tightly.
[time=2923] And they would begin to educate their children with Torah.
[time=2926] They would begin to educate their children with the scriptures at the age of six.
[time=2931] Who has a six year old or five year old?
[time=2934] Let me see your hands.
[time=2935] Who has anything above five, six.
[time=2937] Let me see your hands, five, six and above.
[time=2939] Yeah, at the age of six, the children would be gathered and they would go to school under the teaching of the local rabbi at the local synagogue.
[time=2948] And they would begin a process that was called Betsefer.
[time=2951] Betsefer, for those between the ages of six and nine or 10, somewhere in there.
[time=2959] And they would come and they would meet with their rabbi at the age of six and their rabbi would begin a process with them whereby they would, as six year olds, begin to memorize the Pentateuch.
[time=2970] They would begin to, at the age of six, memorize and hide in their heart every single word of the Torah, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, numbers, Deuteronomy, six year olds,
[time=2989] seven year olds, eight year olds, nine year olds.
[time=2998] It was what they gave themselves to.
[time=3002] It was the discipline of their life.
[time=3004] It was the desire of their heart because you see, they loved their God and they knew that with God was life.
[time=3009] And they knew that apart from God, there was death.
[time=3015] And they knew that it was his word.
[time=3017] It was his holy teachings that would save them, keep them and give them and provide for them all that they would ever need.
[time=3025] And so at the age of six, they begin to memorize the first five books of the Old Testament, at the age of nine or 10, somewhere in there, they would graduate.
[time=3037] Most would go forward.
[time=3039] Girls were getting married and be given, betrothed and they were being given to marriage at the age of around 13.
[time=3046] So still at this next stage, there were young ladies involved.
[time=3051] It was called Bet Talmud, T-A-L-M-U-D.
[time=3055] Bet Sefer would then be followed by Bet Talmud, a period of time spent with the rabbi.
[time=3062] Between the ages of nine and 10, it would go up to about the age of 14.
[time=3066] And in Bet Talmud, they would start with Joshua.
[time=3072] What comes after Deuteronomy?
[time=3073] Joshua.
[time=3089] And they'd memorize the rest of the Old Testament.
[time=3092] Word, the rest, I'll say it to you again, the rest of the Old Testament from Joshua all the way to Malachi.
[time=3104] Right here.
[time=3109] So by the age of 14,
[time=3117] all of it hidden deep in their hearts.
[time=3121] What's your nine-year-old got hidden deep in his heart?
[time=3127] What's your 12, 13, 14-year-old reciting these days?
[time=3134] What is it that our children can spit out?
[time=3138] And I don't just mean spit out to spit out.
[time=3140] I mean, what is it that resides?
[time=3141] See, in our culture, in Western culture, I would admit, we've kind of gone to this notion of education that leads us to taking information and spit it out.
[time=3150] See, these kids lived with this stuff.
[time=3153] They talked about it.
[time=3154] They not only memorized it, but they studied it.
[time=3156] They had conversations about it.
[time=3158] There was discourse.
[time=3160] There was Q and A.
[time=3161] It was an educational process that affected every component of their life, and they took the entirety of God's word and hid it in their hearts.
[time=3176] You know what? That is something I have struggled with.
[time=3180] My whole life.
[time=3182] I've tried to and have made a little bit of progress on it in recent years.
[time=3188] There's a little bit more of it in me than there used to be.
[time=3193] But I tell you what, if you get me, if you were just to take me just the way I am, sorry, I'm just, it's just the way I am, and I've made some choices, and I'm gonna keep working at some things in my life.
[time=3207] But I'll tell you right now, I can spit out for you more statistics about sports, movies, and television.
[time=3216] Then I could about what it says in Joshua 22.
[time=3224] And that's just me. I don't know about you.
[time=3233] But don't you or I, don't we dare, don't don't don't you or I dare think that they weren't onto something, 'cause they were.
[time=3245] And you see it, you see it in the response of a 12, 13, 14-year-old girl whose whole world gets absolutely thrown in a new direction, and what pours out of her heart and mouth is verse after verse after verse, ranging from Genesis 7 all the way to the story of Job.
[time=3266] And so I hope, I hope and I pray that you and I
[time=3273] would give some thought to what it is their hearts and minds are being filled with.
[time=3280] And not just on the memorization front, I think that's a huge front, but even on the discussion front, talks about in Deuteronomy, you and I talking about it with them, when we get up and when we go to bed, when we walk along the road, we've talked about it before, people, please.
[time=3300] If ever there was a day for you and I to stand up and take note, it would be this day, a day when there are so many competing influences.
[time=3309] The Bible knows nothing of Mary's grace, except that which she received from the Lord.
[time=3318] She was the recipient, never the dispenser of grace.
[time=3322] The literal translation of favored one is one in dude with one given grace, just as all the rest of fallen mankind.
[time=3333] Mary needed God's grace and salvation, that is why she rejoiced in God her Savior.
[time=3339] She received a special measure of the Lord's grace by being chosen to be the mother of Jesus, but she was never a source of grace.
[time=3348] God's grace chose a sinful girl to have the unequal privilege of giving birth to the Messiah.
[time=3356] Should we view her with honor and respect?
[time=3358] Should we harbor great gratitude in our hearts for the mother that she was and for the care and guidance that she offered?
[time=3365] Yes or no?
[time=3367] Yeah, absolutely.
[time=3368] Should we buy into some notion of her deity or exalted divine position?
[time=3374] No, she was a sinner who loved God and his word and was saved by the grace of God.
[time=3385] We'll look at those 17 verses and other examples
[time=3391] of God's grace found in them when we come together next week.
[time=3394] I hope you'll join us.
[time=3395] Would you stand and we'll pray as we leave.
[time=3398] Again, don't forget the day 330 and 730.
[time=3401] I hope you can come back and be with us.
[time=3404] Let's pray before we go.
[time=3406] Father, we stand before you this morning.
[time=3411] Many of us very humbled.
[time=3414] Many of us very convicted about that
[time=3420] which we have chosen to value.
[time=3423] The information, the activity.
[time=3432] The events, the materials, the hobbies.
[time=3437] None of them inherently evil, but God, all of them, so lacking in terms of lasting value and benefit when compared to the truth, the life-changing truth of your word.
[time=3451] God, that we would be a people who with our children and even in our own lives, God.
[time=3457] It's never too late to start.
[time=3458] Never too late to become with your help and by your grace, God, individuals who really, truly value the word of God.
[time=3467] And don't just say that we do, but God, we take the time and we give the effort and we open our lives to the kind of taking in that would really change us, God, that would really strengthen us.
[time=3480] God, I pray we would with our children.
[time=3485] I pray we would with each other, God, be a people who in time of crisis, God, in times of despair, in times of confusion could respond immediately, spontaneously, God, from our hearts with the truth of your word, that it would be scripture that would come to our minds, that it would be God's word, your word, God, that would come out of our mouths, God, that we would be a people.
[time=3511] That given and that devoted to that which is so very true, beneficial, valuable and unique.
[time=3520] God, we thank you for your grace.
[time=3524] Every one of us in this room can look at our family tree.
[time=3527] We can look at grandmas and grandpas, moms and dads, great grandfathers.
[time=3531] Many of us can look back at the lineage that we have come from and see your grace.
[time=3537] And we are thankful for it, your grace.
[time=3542] God, as we see it at work and the line of our Messiah, our Savior, our King, our Lord.
[time=3548] Guide us, please, as we continue in this study, and God, give us grace and strength as we leave this place today in your son's name and all the people agreed and said, amen.
[time=3572] (gentle music)
