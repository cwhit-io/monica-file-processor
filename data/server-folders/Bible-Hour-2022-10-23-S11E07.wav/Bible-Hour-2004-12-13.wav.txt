[time=547] [MUSIC - 58 seconds]
[time=609] - Father, this morning we ascribe to you the God of creation and your son, Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit.
[time=617] We ascribe to you, glory and honor in praise, adoration, exaltation, Lord, we lift you high and we want to make your name known in this room together, Lord.
[time=633] Would you fill us in this moment with your spirit?
[time=636] And would you dwell among your people here today in a unique and special way as we come together together of forming a new temple for you to dwell in one that has many parts, many parts with one body and one purpose?
[time=656] Lord, we pray that you would be pleased and honored that the sacrifice of praise that we lift to you and in through our tongues and Lord, the sacrifice of worship through the hearing of the word and through the application in our own lives, may it be a sweet aroma to you this morning.
[time=675] May you be honored and glorified by us.
[time=680] It's such a privilege.
[time=682] We've done plenty, Lord, and we confess this morning to dishonor you.
[time=691] But Lord, we claim Christ this morning and we boast in His sacrifice and in His cross.
[time=700] And I ask you, Father, to see us through Christ's righteousness and not our own.
[time=707] May you receive all the glory and praise and honor from us this morning and this time.
[time=717] We pray these things in Jesus' name.
[time=720] [AMEN] - And not a day goes by when I'm not reminded
[time=730] of what an unbelievable privilege it is to get to do what we do here at Blackhawk.
[time=735] It is an amazing thing, amazing, most of all, because you and I are engaged in the gifts that you give and the resources that you offer and the investment that you make, we get to take all of that and gear it toward the transformation of a human life.
[time=752] And there isn't anything more special.
[time=756] There isn't anything more encouraging than to see people's lives absolutely radically changed.
[time=763] And your gifts allow that to happen.
[time=766] I was reminded of that again this week.
[time=768] I was so thankful that Sam Barfell, the superintendent of our school sent me over this letter.
[time=774] And this is just, this is special.
[time=777] This is special, but people again hear me.
[time=780] This stuff is happening all the time and we get to be a part of it.
[time=787] Sam received a letter.
[time=788] The school received a letter from a very thankful mother.
[time=792] The mother of a young man by the name of Joe, Joe Thompson.
[time=798] And Joe Thompson is a special young man.
[time=805] I believe 20 years of age and just this week finished his final credits, allowing him to graduate from Black Hawk.
[time=814] Joe is physically impaired and it has been a struggle for Joe over the years.
[time=823] And let me read this letter to you and just realize what it is we get to be a part of each and every day.
[time=830] Words cannot express the gratitude we have for Black Hawk Christian and their staff.
[time=834] We began our journey with you a few years ago through Kathy McFadden, whom Black Hawk was gracious enough to loan her a couple of rooms for children like my son, Joe.
[time=844] She soon was able to get Joe into the normal school routine.
[time=848] One class at a time, thanks to the willingness of Steve Longbreak.
[time=852] Eventually, Kathy needed to find space elsewhere off the Black Hawk campus, but by then Joe was doing fairly well without her.
[time=860] Joe has come a long way in many aspects from that boy who first began.
[time=865] Having come from a situation where he was struck by a teacher and constantly being sent home and more, we were not sure what was going to happen next.
[time=874] Joe told me that he actually felt like he belonged and had friends finally.
[time=880] We are grateful for Mr. Myers and his time with Joe.
[time=887] For Coach Merrill, for letting Joe help manage the basketball team.
[time=895] For Mrs. Ryan, for all the math help.
[time=897] For Mr. Guthrie, for going bowling with Joe.
[time=902] For Mrs. Schleibaugh, for allowing Joe to touch a machine.
[time=905] For Mr. Freeborn, just because I heard his name a lot.
[time=908] For Mr. McCown, whom Joe thought was very funny
[time=914] and talked a lot about.
[time=916] For Mrs. Hamilton, for allowing Joe to be in the library a lot.
[time=920] For Mr. Holloway, for giving Joe a part in the play.
[time=923] For Mrs. Griggs, giving Joe much pleasure on the yearbook staff.
[time=927] For Mr. Hopewell and Mr. Koach.
[time=929] For faithfully guiding Joe's progress and putting up with me, his mother.
[time=934] And for all the teachers who have helped over the last few years that I may have missed.
[time=938] Also thanks to Marge and Becky in the office for answering my many questions.
[time=943] Last, but not least, to the students.
[time=950] Who befriended Joe.
[time=952] Who ignored some of his many antics.
[time=955] Who gave him rides, invited him to parties.
[time=958] And said hi when they saw him out and about.
[time=960] You will never know how those kindnesses touched us all.
[time=965] We will always remember all the special moments with grateful hearts Gary, Pat, Joe, and Carly Thompson.
[time=973] Amen?
[time=974] Wow.
[time=975] (audience applauds)
[time=981] Every single day, we get the privilege of being engaged in the greatest endeavor of all.
[time=990] The endeavor to, with God's help, bring change and transformation to the human heart.
[time=996] And your gifts, your regular ongoing gifts, and anything special you may be able to do at the end of the year, it allows us to continue to do that.
[time=1006] And we are so grateful for the way in which you as a family have supported these efforts.
[time=1011] Well, let's get going here.
[time=1015] What do you say?
[time=1016] Why don't you first start by taking your Bible and turning to Matthew chapter one.
[time=1021] Matthew chapter one.
[time=1024] This is where we began last week and this is where we will return to this week.
[time=1029] We began a three week Christmas series entitled A Family Tree Like No Other.
[time=1036] A look at the family tree of our Lord.
[time=1040] And what an amazing look it is shaping up to be.
[time=1044] I don't know about you, but oftentimes, let me just say this as we start, oftentimes when I meet somebody, oftentimes when we begin to have discussion, oftentimes it may be here, it may be out and about, it could be a number of different places, but I'll meet someone, begin to talk with them.
[time=1058] And I don't know if it's because of me and who I am.
[time=1060] I think maybe this might be a common experience with most folks, but if the conversation in any way shape or form begins to kind of go spiritual, if we begin to talk about things that matter, oftentimes people will begin to apologize for their past.
[time=1078] Oftentimes you can sense it in their voice,
[time=1085] you can kind of see it in their face, they begin to speak about, they begin to refer to their family, how they were raised, where they've been, what they've done.
[time=1097] Oftentimes these things are the beginning of, oftentimes these things produce a great level of shame and embarrassment.
[time=1107] Can you identify with that?
[time=1111] Oftentimes that's what you bump into.
[time=1113] And I oftentimes want to just remind them that God is a God that is so much bigger than anybody's past.
[time=1122] And I'll tell you what, the more I study this passage, I want to quickly remind them of the family and the past from which our Messiah came.
[time=1133] We began to see that last week.
[time=1136] We began to see this incredible story unfold from 17 verses of names.
[time=1142] And I'm gonna invite you to just stand with me again this morning in honor of God's word.
[time=1146] I haven't practiced the names all week and we're gonna just do this again.
[time=1151] And you're thinking, now why are we doing this again, Kelly?
[time=1153] It's just 17 verses of names.
[time=1155] Well, if you were here last week, you realized along with me that it's a whole lot more than just 17 verses of names.
[time=1164] And I want you to just bear with me.
[time=1166] I want you to open your heart and open your mind as we again visit this family tree like no other.
[time=1173] Matthew one, verses one through 17.
[time=1178] The record of the genealogy of Jesus, the Messiah, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
[time=1183] Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers.
[time=1188] Judah was the father of Perez and Zera by Tamar.
[time=1192] Perez was the father of Hezron and Hezron the father of Ram.
[time=1195] Ram was the father of Aminadab and Aminadab the father of Neshon and Neshon the father of Salmon.
[time=1202] I actually did talk with a Hebrew friend of mine and I was given permission to go with the whole Salmon thing instead of salmon.
[time=1210] He said that was a good call.
[time=1212] The pronunciation would be Salmon, not salmon.
[time=1215] They wouldn't have called this guy salmon back there.
[time=1217] So Salmon is it.
[time=1219] Salmon was the father of Boaz by Rahab.
[time=1223] Boaz was the father of Obed by Ruth and Obed the father of who?
[time=1227] Jesse was the father of who?
[time=1230] The what?
[time=1231] The King.
[time=1233] What's the purpose of Matthew?
[time=1235] Matthew's purpose is to present Jesus as what?
[time=1239] King, right?
[time=1240] We learned that last week.
[time=1242] David was the father of Solomon by Bathsheba who had been the wife of Uriah.
[time=1248] Salomon was the father of Raya Boam and Raya Boam the father of Abidja, an Abidja the father of Asa.
[time=1254] Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat and Jehoshaphat the father of Joram.
[time=1258] Joram the father of Uzziah.
[time=1260] Uzziah was the father of Jotham and Jotham the father of Ahas and Ahas the father of Hezekiah.
[time=1266] Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh, the Manasseh the father of Amon and Amon the father of Josiah.
[time=1272] Josiah became the father of Jekoniah and his brothers at the time of the deportation to Babylon.
[time=1280] That there referring to the captivity which the Jewish nation endured as they were taken captive and sent to Babylon.
[time=1288] After the deportation to Babylon, Jekoniah became the father of Shiel Thiel and Shiel Thiel the father of Zerubbabel.
[time=1296] Zerubbabel was the father of Abahud and Abahud the father of Elikim.
[time=1301] Elikim the father of Azor.
[time=1302] Azor was the father of Zaidok and Zaidok the father of Akim and Akim the father of Eliyud.
[time=1308] Eliyud was the father of Eleazar.
[time=1310] Eleazar the father of Matan and Matan the father of Jacob.
[time=1314] Jacob was the father of Joseph, the husband of who?
[time=1318] By whom who was born?
[time=1320] Who was called the Christ, the Messiah.
[time=1324] So all the generations from Abraham to David are 14 generations.
[time=1332] From David to the deportation to Babylon, 14 generations and from the deportation to Babylon to the Messiah himself, 14 generations.
[time=1344] Let's pray.
[time=1348] God in heaven, we stand before you this morning, standing in honor of your word.
[time=1354] And God, as we stand to honor it, we as well commit again today to open our hearts and minds to what you would have for us.
[time=1363] We believe as always and again today that there is in your word life-changing truth.
[time=1371] And God, we want our lives changed.
[time=1374] Most of us.
[time=1379] God, there may be some in the room who are this morning resisting the change that you can bring.
[time=1386] God resisting encouragement that only you can allow.
[time=1390] God resisting the obedience that you've called each and every one of us that knows you to exhibit.
[time=1398] And so God, those that find themselves willing and ready this morning to be taught and reminded and encouraged and changed God, change us.
[time=1408] God, those that would be resistant, we pray that your spirit, powerful, life-changing, eternity-altering spirit of God.
[time=1420] God, that he would be at work, softening the hearts and painting a picture for them of life and hope that only you can fulfill.
[time=1429] God, it is a privilege to gather together.
[time=1432] We thank you and this season, God, we thank you for your son, for this family that you gave him to and the stories that we see.
[time=1441] God, the reminders that are there, continue, please, in our study, God, to change and grow each of us.
[time=1448] We thank you for this time together in your son's name, we pray, amen.
[time=1452] You may be seated.
[time=1453] So verses one to 17, in Matthew one, not just a list of names, much more than just a genealogical listing.
[time=1462] It is 17 verses of life stories, 17 verses of miracles, 17 verses of spiritual victories and moments of shame.
[time=1472] We came to see that tucked away throughout this entire messianic genealogy is case after case, example after example, reminder after reminder after reminder of the amazing grace of God.
[time=1490] You see it everywhere.
[time=1492] And the more I read it and the more I've studied it in these weeks, that I've had the opportunity to kind of engage in these 17 verses, the more evident it is the grace of God seen top to bottom.
[time=1505] We began last week by looking at the grace of God.
[time=1510] There's four areas, four arenas, four points that we're gonna make here as we go through these 17 verses.
[time=1516] We see the grace of God in the choice of one woman.
[time=1521] We talked about last week as you look at the genealogy and you come down to this idea of verse 16, Jacob was the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary by whom Jesus was born.
[time=1535] You realize as you look into that, as you study that, you realize that the grace of God was huge in the choice of any woman, for that matter, but in this case, the choice of a girl, 12, 13, 14 year old girl who God chose to be the one who would bear the child, the Christ child, the Messiah.
[time=1558] Last week we were so encouraged.
[time=1560] Many of you challenged, I know because you told me, challenged as I was challenged, as we looked at Mary, this 12, 13, 14 year old girls, we looked at her response to this calling that God had placed on her.
[time=1572] We saw in the Magnificot there in Luke 2, verses 46 to 55, we see this response that Mary gives to God.
[time=1581] She responds to the message of the angel and she responds with personal opinion or scripture, scripture, verse after verse after verse, as she gives to him the response of her heart, verse after verse is nothing but quotations from the scriptures themselves.
[time=1603] We see her quoting from Job.
[time=1604] We see her quoting from Genesis.
[time=1606] We see her quoting from Psalms again and again, verse after verse, kind of a saying back to God.
[time=1612] All that, and we learned this, all that she had hid in her heart.
[time=1616] We learned last week that as a young Jewish girl, as it was with most Jewish children, beginning at the age of six, she would have been part of what is called Betsephyr, the memorization of the Torah.
[time=1629] They would start them at the age of six, memorizing every single verse, talking about teaching on, dialoguing about, doing Q&A regarding every single verse in Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, numbers, and Deuteronomy.
[time=1646] By the age of 10, they would graduate to what was called a period of teaching called Bet Talmud.
[time=1653] And in Bet Talmud, they would pick up where they left off, beginning with Joshua and going all the way to Malachi, the rest of the Old Testament, memorized.
[time=1664] Verse by verse, every word, every thought, every truth, talked about, studied, learned, hidden in their hearts.
[time=1674] And when life began to unfold, when crisis hit, when the unexpected came, her response was born out of that
[time=1683] which filled her heart, and that was the word of God, the truth.
[time=1690] We saw God's grace in the choice of one woman.
[time=1694] We touched base on some things.
[time=1696] We talked about Mary, a lot of teaching out there on Mary.
[time=1699] We talked about how she should be viewed with honor and respect.
[time=1702] We should harbor great gratitude in our hearts for the mother that she was and the care and guidance that she offered.
[time=1709] Should we buy into some notion of her deity or exalted position?
[time=1713] No.
[time=1714] She was a sinner who loved God and who loved God's word, saved by the grace of God.
[time=1722] You see, God's grace is everywhere in this amazing story, this amazing lineage, this incredible group of individuals that God chose sovereignly to bring forth the Messiah.
[time=1737] Well, let's keep going.
[time=1737] What do you say?
[time=1738] Number two, you also see God's grace.
[time=1740] As you read through these 17 verses, you see God's grace evidenced.
[time=1745] You see God's grace seen in the descendants of two men, the descendants of two men.
[time=1752] And you can look right there at the first verse, the record of the genealogy of Jesus, the Messiah, the son of who?
[time=1761] The son of Abraham, the son of David, and the son of Abraham.
[time=1768] People, here we have two men, David and Abraham.
[time=1775] Pillars, pillars in the history of our faith
[time=1781] and pillars in the beginning stages of this amazing genealogy, two men who committed unspeakable acts of sin and evil.
[time=1794] And yet both, both by the grace of God were placed as pivotal ancestors in the royal line of Messiah.
[time=1806] David, David sinned terribly in committing adultery with Bathsheba and then compounded the sin by dealing with her husband Uriah in the way that he did.
[time=1818] And it's a hard story to read.
[time=1828] If you know anything about David, like I know about David, if you've studied David, if you've read David in the Psalms, if you've developed the kind of love and appreciation and respect for David, that I know many in this room have developed.
[time=1846] I mean, he was a man after all that God said, man didn't say it.
[time=1849] God said he was a man after whose own heart?
[time=1852] God's.
[time=1854] And so any of you, like myself, who have kind of walked through some seasons of life in relationship with Christ, you can't help but realize, what an amazing man.
[time=1865] What a gifted man, David was and how he, when you read the Psalms, I mean, it just jumps off the page.
[time=1871] He loved God.
[time=1876] And it makes it very, very difficult to read his story.
[time=1881] And I was just going to mention it this morning, but I thought you know what?
[time=1884] We should read it.
[time=1886] We should look at this ancestor of our faith.
[time=1889] We should look at the grace of God.
[time=1890] It's what this series is about.
[time=1892] So let's just be reminded of how this thing unfolded.
[time=1895] Go with me, if you will, a second Samuel, 11.
[time=1899] Second Samuel, 11.
[time=1902] And we're going to start right there at the beginning of that chapter.
[time=1907] Second Samuel, 11, verse 1.
[time=1911] Then it happened, quite a way to start out there.
[time=1917] Then it happened in the spring, at the time when kings go out to battle,
[time=1924] that David sent Joab and his servants with him and all Israel.
[time=1930] And they destroyed the sons of Amun and besieged Rabah, but David stayed at Jerusalem.
[time=1938] You want to stop right there just for a moment and then just kind of take a note as we go here.
[time=1944] And I would guess, for many of you in the room, I know for myself this is true, that as you read through this, I would guess that there are points along the way where you'll be able to identify with some of the choices that were made here.
[time=1959] What David chooses here in verse 1, my friends, is something called complacency.
[time=1966] It was the springtime, and all the kings were out to battle.
[time=1971] I understand that there are times for breaks.
[time=1974] This wasn't one of them.
[time=1976] This was a time when he was to be engaged.
[time=1978] This was a time when he was to be at the forefront.
[time=1981] This was the time when he was to be sleeves rolled up out there with the rest of them doing what God had called and to do.
[time=1988] And for some reason in his spirit, he decides to take a break.
[time=1996] And that's a great lesson.
[time=1997] It's a sad and tragic, but great lesson for you and I.
[time=1999] Be very careful when it is you decide to take a break from that which God has called you to.
[time=2011] Sometimes when you and I take breaks, sometimes when we grow complacent, sometimes when we disengage, it just begins to filter through the rest of our life.
[time=2022] Does that make sense?
[time=2023] If it doesn't, read verse 2.
[time=2024] I bet it'll make sense.
[time=2026] Now when evening came, David arose from his what?
[time=2031] From his what?
[time=2033] What was he doing in bed at night?
[time=2038] You ever gotten complacent?
[time=2040] Complacency often leads to laziness.
[time=2045] You ever stayed in bed too long?
[time=2049] Yeah.
[time=2050] It just kind of has a way of numbing things.
[time=2054] It kind of has a way of bringing you and myself down.
[time=2059] When complacency hits, when laziness is chosen, when you stay in bed too long,
[time=2065] things get a little muddy.
[time=2069] Things are about to get real muddy.
[time=2072] Now when evening came, David arose from his bed and walked around on the roof.
[time=2078] It's bored of the king's house and from the roof he saw a woman bathing
[time=2084] and the woman was very beautiful in appearance.
[time=2086] So David sent and inquired about the woman and one said, "Is this not Bathsheba,
[time=2093] the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?" David sent messengers and took her and when she came to him he lay with her and when she had purified herself from her uncleanness she returned to her house
[time=2109] and the woman conceived and she sent and told David and said, "I am pregnant."
[time=2118] Now the end of verse 5 there brings David as it brings you and me in different situations.
[time=2129] There are moments of pause where decisions get made, where choices are thought through,
[time=2139] where a direction right can be chosen and the end of verse 5 brings a moment of pause
[time=2148] and an opportunity for David.
[time=2151] And here's what he chooses.
[time=2154] Then David sent to Joab saying, "Send me Uriah the Hittite." So Joab sent Uriah to David. When Uriah came to him, David asked concerning the welfare of Joab
[time=2165] and the people and the state of the war, then David said to Uriah, "Go down to your house and wash your feet." And Uriah went out of the king's house and a present from the king
[time=2176] was sent out after him, but verse 9, "But Uriah slept." See David wanted Uriah to go and sleep
[time=2183] with his wife. David wanted this thing covered, but verse 9, " Uriah slept at the door of the king's
[time=2193] house with all the servants of his Lord and did not go down to his house." Now when they told David saying, " Uriah did not go down to his house," David said to Uriah, "Have you not come from a journey? Why do you not go down to your house?" Uriah said to David, "The ark, the ark of the covenant. The ark and Israel and Judah
[time=2215] are staying in temporary shelters. I've left my friends out in the battlefield. They're sleeping
[time=2221] intense, my Lord. Shall I then go to my house to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife
[time=2229] by your life and the life of your soul. I will not do this thing." Then David said to Uriah, "Stay here today also and tomorrow. I will let you go."
[time=2240] So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next, now David, verse 13, called him and he ate
[time=2247] and drank before him and he made him. David made Uriah drunk and in the evening he went out
[time=2253] to lie on his bed with his Lord's servants, but he did not go down to his house.
[time=2260] The end of verse 13 brings a moment of pause. He brings it to you and he brings it to me,
[time=2268] a chance to decide to go a certain way. Things have transpired, stuff has occurred,
[time=2276] here is an opportunity to change the course. What's he do?
[time=2284] Verse 14, now in the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent the letter by the hand of Uriah
[time=2292] and the letter that he sent, he had written in the letter saying, "Place Uriah, Uriah carries
[time=2299] this letter. Place Uriah in the front line of the fiercest battle and withdraw from him
[time=2305] so that he may be struck down and die." So it was as Joab kept watch on the city.
[time=2314] That he put Uriah at the place where he knew there were valiant men. The men of the city went
[time=2320] out and fought against Joab and some of the people among David's servants fell and Uriah,
[time=2326] the Hittite also died, killed him, murdered him. David, a man after God's own heart.
[time=2347] As you read through David's life, you see in a number of different places,
[time=2356] how he was a very poor father who failed to discipline his children,
[time=2362] one of whom Absalom tried to take his throne away from him by armed rebellion.
[time=2369] And then you have Abraham. Abraham, though a man of great faith, twice lied about his wife,
[time=2378] Sarah, out of fear for his life and a lack of trust in God, he told two different pagan kings
[time=2386] that she was his sister. You can write that down. Genesis 12 and Genesis 20. Genesis 12 and
[time=2393] Genesis 20, you can turn there later and read the story of two separate times where Abraham
[time=2399] with his wife, Sarah, who was very beautiful, very desirable as they would approach cities,
[time=2405] fortresses with kings. He was afraid. See, he had scenarioed this thing out and he knew that the
[time=2412] king would want his wife and if he knew that it was his wife, Abraham knew the king would have
[time=2418] him killed, so he didn't want to die. So he had Sarah lie and tell the kings that he was her
[time=2424] brother, that she was his sister, because he had it all figured out. Do you ever do that?
[time=2431] Do you ever scenario things out in your mind? Do you ever find yourself in a difficult spot?
[time=2437] And although the scenario will include disobedience, you've got your view of how this thing's going
[time=2444] to go and you know it's going to go this way and you know you don't have any choice. If you're going to protect you, you're going to have to make some decisions here. And so you scenario the
[time=2455] thing out and you start making choices, disobedient and dishonoring to God and you don't trust
[time=2461] him. You don't really live out that he causes all things to work together for good Abraham.
[time=2468] The father of our faith chooses to take matters into his own hands.
[time=2471] In doing so he brought shame, great shame on Sarah, his wife, on himself and on the God in whom he
[time=2481] believed and whom he claimed to serve. Yet God made Abraham the father of his chosen people,
[time=2487] Israel, from whom the Messiah would arise. And he made David the father of the royal line from
[time=2493] whom the Messiah would descend. Jesus was the son of David by royal descent and the son of Abraham
[time=2501] by racial descent. Now watch this, God's grace also extends to the descendants of these two incredible
[time=2508] guys. Isaac, for example, was the son of promise and a type of the sacrificial savior,
[time=2515] being himself willingly offered up to God by his father. God gave the name of Isaac's son, Jacob, later renamed Israel to his chosen people and Jacob's sons, Judah and his brothers became
[time=2528] heads of the tribes of Israel. All of those men were sinful and at times were weak and unfaithful,
[time=2534] but God was continually faithful to them and his grace was always with them even in times of
[time=2540] rebuke and discipline. Solomon on David's side, David's son and successor to the throne, was
[time=2546] peaceful and wise, but also in many ways extremely foolish. We've studied in recent days here
[time=2553] some of these choices that Solomon made. He sowed seeds of both domestic and spiritual corruption
[time=2559] by marrying hundreds of wives, most of them from pagan countries throughout the world at that time,
[time=2565] and they, these hundreds of wives, turned Solomon's heart and the hearts of many other Israelites
[time=2571] away from God. The unity of Israel was broken and the kingdom soon became divided, but the royal
[time=2578] line remained unbroken and God's promise to David eventually was fulfilled. God's grace prevailed.
[time=2588] It always did. It always does, and it always will. A careful look, we've been kind of quick
[time=2600] here today, but if we took even more time and searched the scriptures even further,
[time=2606] brought to the surface these stories in an even clearer fashion, a careful look at the
[time=2612] descendants both of Abraham and of David reveals people who were often characterized by unfaithfulness, immorality, idolatry, and apostasy, but God's dealing with them was always
[time=2623] characterized by what? Grace. Verse 1, Matthew 1, Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham,
[time=2634] was sent to overcome the failures of both those men and all their descendants and to accomplish
[time=2643] what they could never have accomplished. The king of grace came through the line
[time=2649] of two sinful men. God's grace. God's grace. God's grace, my friends, always prevails.
[time=2657] Your own efforts are mine. All your best efforts in mine, at righteous living, will always fall
[time=2666] short. It doesn't mean that we should stop living in that direction, but you and I know our best efforts in time will fall short. God's grace never does. Our determined, disciplined
[time=2679] efforts itself denial and godliness, though commendable and at times because of his help,
[time=2685] successful, will at other times be frustrated and we will falter. God's grace never does.
[time=2692] Ever. You can't, by your own merit, earn his favor or grace. You can't, by your own merit,
[time=2701] merit, keep it. He gives his grace to the unfaithful and undeserving. He's done it again and again and
[time=2708] again. Now I know some of you in the room this morning. I know a lot of you and I know a lot of
[time=2717] you in the room this morning have dealt with this issue that I'm about to raise and you've dealt with it and you have to continue to deal with it in the days to come, but there was a point in time where you were able to understand what I'm about to say and by God's grace you grew in that
[time=2735] and you've been able to follow him and continue on in your relationship with him with a better understanding of this. What am I about to say here? Some of you in the room
[time=2746] really, really need to hear this because some of you in the room this morning have not figured
[time=2753] this out yet and I believe the Spirit of God and the Word of God is here today to maybe give you
[time=2760] some help on this because some of you in the room are still trying to get cleaned up for God.
[time=2767] See you haven't, you haven't fully grasped or understood this thing called grace and there are
[time=2776] some and I meet you and we talk and we converse and I begin to understand how this works in you.
[time=2781] You're trying so hard to get cleaned up for God. See you think that somehow you've got to be good
[time=2791] enough. You think that somehow you've got to accomplish something. Somehow you have got to wipe the crud off your life to somehow be presentable to this God. I mean it's encouraging in that in
[time=2801] a sense it shows a healthy view of God. I mean there's a sense where you realize how pure and
[time=2807] holy and perfect and great and awesome he is but then there's this thought in you that somehow
[time=2813] you're going to have to do something to somehow be acceptable to a God that great.
[time=2819] Some of you due to the lies of religion pounded into your mind over the years still think you've
[time=2828] got to somehow be good enough to come to him for salvation or good enough to keep walking with him
[time=2837] once saved. You're spending your days and sometimes your nights trying to be good enough for a God
[time=2844] who offers grace. And if you just think about it for a minute, I mean you're trying to be good
[time=2853] enough for who? You're trying to be good enough for God? You're going to do that? How's that going
[time=2865] to go? How long are you going to work at that being good enough for God? You can ask me well Kelly,
[time=2875] don't you? Aren't you trying to be good? Don't you try to make good... Oh yeah, I try to do good and
[time=2881] I try to make good decisions. But I try to make good decisions and I try to be good to honor God
[time=2888] not to earn his love or his favor or his grace. And I think that's a good place just to stop
[time=2896] just for a minute. There's a lot of different directions we could go from that thought but I want to just say this to parents. Moms and dads, grandmas and grandpas, caregivers. I mean I'm
[time=2908] talking about with two-year-olds, twelve-year-olds, thirty-year-olds, it doesn't matter. Moms and dads, remember that. Remember that the love of God, the grace of God. Remember that the love and mercy
[time=2923] and grace of God. God says to you and I as parents that we are to exercise and evidence and offer
[time=2929] that same kind of love when it talks about loving our children, when it talks about shepherding our
[time=2935] home. That is the kind of love that we're to offer. Please, parents, don't forget this. Sometimes this
[time=2941] gets a little foggy. Love was never intended by God as he designed it. Love was never intended
[time=2949] to be earned. Right? Right? You don't earn love. Not real love. Not God's love. It's not earned.
[time=2963] I learned that that that wasn't that wasn't something I felt growing up. I kind of felt the
[time=2975] opposite many a time that I had to be. I met a good friend who years ago taught me the opposite
[time=2986] and I watched him exercise that very thing with his family. I watched him time and time and time
[time=2992] again and he would tell me how very important it was that we communicate to our children
[time=2998] that they can never do anything. Think about this. They could never do anything. They could never
[time=3006] go anywhere. They could never make a decision. They could never choose anything that would ever
[time=3014] separate them from his love. And you might hear that this morning and think, well, that's just
[time=3021] kind of spiritual platitudes and that sounds good. But no, you think about that and you think about really living. You think about the choices a child can make, especially when that child gets to be
[time=3031] 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. You think about the decisions that can be made and how we
[time=3040] we toy with that picture and all of a sudden love starts to be withheld.
[time=3047] See, here's the thing. And especially with the younger ones as they're growing up, people, love was never intended to be earned. If you're holding it back for whatever reason,
[time=3057] as you attempt to manipulate them or punish them or teach them some lesson and you know what,
[time=3064] they know it, right? They sense it. They feel it when your love is being withheld and the scary
[time=3070] thing is, and they know this too, that if they can earn it, they can also, what, lose it.
[time=3076] And there isn't anything more damaging and more frightening for a child than to think in his
[time=3086] or her mind and heart that somehow they could lose your love. It's not so with God. Ephesians 2,
[time=3094] 8, and 9, Ephesians 2, 8, and 9, let me have you just read it from the screen here. Let me just
[time=3100] read it and you listen for by grace. See, this is the grace of God. This is the love of God.
[time=3104] This is how God operates. This is what He calls us to do, to not only be people who would receive
[time=3110] this kind of grace, but to be the kind of people who would extend it as well, for by grace you have
[time=3116] been saved. It's important for most folks just to stop right there and realize no matter what
[time=3122] you've been taught, no matter what you've been told, salvation comes by grace. Who's grace?
[time=3129] His grace for by grace you have been and can be saved. Through faith and that, not of yourselves,
[time=3141] it is the gift of God. Here's the amazing thing about that, here's the amazing thing about that sentence right there. Even the faith, listen, even the faith that you exercise, me 20 some years ago,
[time=3157] 1983, back row, you've heard the story, head forward on the back of the pew, finally just
[time=3163] with tears dropping off my cheeks, said I'm in. I fully surrender my heart and life to you,
[time=3170] for you, wherever that was, whatever that looked like. Even the faith for by grace you have been
[time=3177] saved through faith and that, what's that referring to? And that, what? The faith. And that,
[time=3186] not of yourselves, even the faith is a gift. Yes, you and I have to make a choice and we do,
[time=3197] but the choice of faith, even the very faith that saves you is a gift. Even that you didn't have anything to do with. He gave you it all by his grace through faith, not of yourselves,
[time=3211] it is the gift of God, not as a result of works. Nothing was earned so that no one may boast.
[time=3220] We are redeemed by what? Say it. Grace. We are saved by what? Say it. We are made new by what?
[time=3231] Given hope by what? Forgiven by what? Can you jump for it? No. You run for it? No. Can you earn it?
[time=3241] Something you can do to merit it? No. It is a gift. It is the merciful grace of God that brings you
[time=3249] and I to saving faith. And it was the merciful grace of God that took two men, one a fearful liar,
[time=3257] the other a murderer and an adulterer and made them cornerstones, pillars in the genealogical
[time=3264] lineage that leads to Mosheia, Messiah, the Christ, our Lord and people. If he can do that,
[time=3272] and he did, if he can do that out of the likes of them, if he can produce and bring forth Messiah
[time=3282] from the likes of David and Abraham, what could he do with you and the generations that will follow?
[time=3290] I reminded, I reminded the folks during the concerts over the last two weekends, every chance I had
[time=3299] to speak at one of those, I just looked at folks and just told them each and every night, a generation
[time=3307] will follow. You don't get a choice in that. Whoever you are, there will be some who will
[time=3314] come after you. It's just going to be that way. They're going to follow you. And having followed
[time=3321] you and the choices you've made and the life you've lived, they'll make certain choices. They'll
[time=3327] have a certain mindset. There will be things that you've invested in them. And when you look at
[time=3335] this unbelievable lineup of folks that our Christ came out of, it is a reminder to you and I that
[time=3342] by the grace of God, no matter where you've been, no matter what you've done, it doesn't matter.
[time=3348] He is a God of new beginnings. And he is a God who in relationship with him, you have the unspeakable privilege of making a generational investment of truth and life and hope and meaning.
[time=3364] And I pray today, our hope today is that you would do that very thing.
[time=3368] By his grace, he saves and restores the broken. And in the process brings to life
[time=3375] something new. Let me have you stand and let me have you read 2 Corinthians 5, 17.
[time=3382] What a great way to end our time today as you think about the opportunity that God has given you
[time=3391] to influence, love, impact and give guidance to a new generation. Sometimes where we've been,
[time=3397] sometimes the choices we've made, sometimes the family lineage even, sometimes it can be discouraging. But praise God that this is true. It says in 2 Corinthians 5, 17,
[time=3409] with one voice, read it with me, okay, here we go. Therefore, if anyone is in Christ,
[time=3415] he is a new creature. The old things passed away. Behold, new things have come. Amen? Let's pray.
[time=3424] Our Father in heaven, we are so grateful that with you new things can come.
[time=3433] God, when we consider where we've been, God, when we consider the journey of life that you have seen
[time=3443] each and every one of us down. Some lives in here, still young, others more seasoned,
[time=3450] God, but yet when we look back and we realize that you are a God that no matter where we have
[time=3456] traveled, you bring forgiveness, you bring grace, you bring mercy, you bring hope. And in relationship
[time=3463] with your son, the son whose birth we celebrate this season, God in relationship with him,
[time=3471] Paul says there to the church at Corinth, old things pass away. Our sin and our failure
[time=3478] is removed by the grace and mercy of God and in relationship with you Father. We have new life.
[time=3486] God, I pray that the new life that so many in this room today have, God, I pray that we would live
[time=3492] it well. God, I pray that today would be a reminder that each and every day, each and every moment,
[time=3500] God with each and every breath you grant, we have the privilege of depositing into the hearts and
[time=3506] lives of others life-changing truth. And God, would you please give us strength to do that as parents?
[time=3514] Would you give us strength to do that as friends? Would you give us strength to do that with those God that you have brought into our lives? God, that we would be by your grace and with your help.
[time=3523] God, relentless, passionate and intentional and our willingness and readiness to pass on to
[time=3535] the next and coming generation of love for you, a love for your truth and a sensitivity to your
[time=3541] spirit. God, we thank you for this time together today. We pray, God, that you would bring us back
[time=3547] together again soon if that be your will. Change us as we go. Grow us in the days to come.
[time=3554] And all the people agreed and said, amen.
