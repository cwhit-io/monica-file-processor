[time=60] [MUSIC - 194 seconds]
[time=284] Christmas what a wonderful time and I was thinking this past week as I was reflecting of Mary and the fact that when the angel of the Lord came to her she had a choice to make she could have accepted that or she could have rejected it we know she accepted that choice to carry that child and to really welcome him into this world.
[time=308] Well now we have some choices as well today we the you know the greatest shopping day of the year we have choices what stores we're going to go to if we're going to brave that out there whether to regift or not to regift that is the question.
[time=319] And now most importantly we have a choice is folks are starting to take down the Christmas tree in the ornaments and the seasonal things that were used to we have a choice are we going to take those down and not carry them with us throughout the year.
[time=335] That's our choice are we going to welcome him into our world not just the season, but our world.
[time=342] [MUSIC]

[time=495] [MUSIC]
[time=504] Well for the past two weeks we have enjoyed and been challenged by a 17 verse long list of names.
[time=514] That's right in celebration of the birth of Christ we have spent some time considering and looking closely at the family line of Messiah.
[time=524] The generations leading up to our Lord the lineage if you will of Jesus Christ found for us in Matthew chapter one and listed for us there in all of its great detail.
[time=538] Admittedly as I told you a few weeks ago as we started this study I have in the past not been a real fan of genealogies.
[time=547] I mean I've read them they are a part of the scriptures I have made my way through them at times painstakingly trying to get through in whatever reading I might have been doing but admittedly.
[time=560] I realize now what I have missed and I have missed a great deal and I will not skim I will not skim the genealogies any longer because I have found and I think many of you have found as we have studied these 17 verses.
[time=575] We have been amazed because these list of names represent lists of lives and these lives represent stories.
[time=584] The story of a life is never boring the story of a life is always insightful and the story of these lives has brought great insight into the grace and power of God in the midst of a royal line leading to the king of kings.
[time=599] We've rediscovered some very normal human individuals.
[time=604] We've seen that God chose to use a band of fallen humans to form the family tree of the Son of God.
[time=612] We've seen the grace of God at work here in the midst of this genealogy we have seen the grace of God something very powerful at work in the lives of these people.
[time=626] God doing amazing things God doing miraculous things through common everyday ordinary fallen human beings like you and me.
[time=640] We've seen the grace of God evidenced in the choice of one girl we started there two weeks ago you see the grace of God evidenced in this entire genealogy in this family tree it begins by his choice of one girl.
[time=655] It was by the grace of God that any girl or woman would be chosen to be the mother of Jesus Christ and yet we see here in the life of this 12, 13, 14 year old young lady sinful human fallen just like the rest of us.
[time=672] We see the grace of God dished out in an amazing way as he gives her a young girl the privilege of bearing his son caring for his son.
[time=684] We see the grace of God evidenced in that he allowed two very sinful fallen men to play pivotal and sensual roles in the family line leading to Messiah we looked at that last week.
[time=698] We see the grace of God in the descendants of these two men David and Abraham we became last week kind of reacquainted if you will with these two guys and their story.
[time=711] A story full of greatness for sure I mean two men who form kind of the foundation they're kind of the pillars of our faith we we read stories to our kids about David and Abraham.
[time=724] We marvel at the things that they did for God we are so grateful for their faithfulness and their strength and the character that they exhibited so many times and their love for him and their service to him and yet these are two men who gave themselves to unspeakable acts
[time=744] of unfaithfulness and sin and rebellion and dishonesty.
[time=753] The grace of God all throughout this entire list and the choice of one girl and the allowance of these two men to play such pivotal roles and now today we come to a third glimpse into the grace of God evidenced for us in this unfolding story
[time=773] of names and time.
[time=776] Stand with me if you would in honor of God's word as we read Matthew 1 verses 1 to 17 one more time and as we read again just be reminded every life as a story and in every story the grace of God is revealed.
[time=793] The record of the genealogy of Jesus the Messiah the son of David the son of Abraham Abraham was the father of Isaac Isaac the father of Jacob and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers Judah was the father of Perez and Zara by Tamar.
[time=808] Perez was the father of Hezron and Hezron the father of Ram, Ram was the father of Aminadab and Aminadab the father of Naishan and Naishan the father of Salmon.
[time=818] Salmon was the father of Boaz by Rahab, Boaz was the father of Obed by Ruth and Obed the father of Jesse and Jesse was the father of who?
[time=828] The what? The king. David was the father of Solomon by Bathsheba who had been the wife of Uriah and Salomon was the father of Rea Boam. Rea Boam the father of Abaja and Abaja the father of Asa.
[time=843] Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Joram and Joram the father of Usaya. Usaya was the father of Jotham and Jotham the father of Ahaz and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah.
[time=855] Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh and Manasseh the father of Amon and Amon the father of Josiah. Josiah became the father of Jekoniah and his brothers at the time of the deportation to Babylon.
[time=869] After the deportation to Babylon, Jekoniah became the father of Shealtiel and Shealtiel the father of Zerubabel. Zerubabel was the father of Abahud and Abahud the father of Elekim.
[time=883] Elekim the father of Azor, Azor was the father of Zaidok and Zaidok the father of Akim and Akim the father of Eliyud.
[time=891] Eleud was the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matan and Matan the father of Jacob. Jacob was the father of Joseph, the husband of who?
[time=903] By whom Jesus was born who was called the what? Christ the Messiah.
[time=909] So all the generations from Abraham to David are 14 generations from David to the deportation to Babylon 14 generations and from the deportation to Babylon to the Messiah Himself 14 generations.
[time=927] Let's pray.
[time=931] God we stand before you this morning in humility. We stand humbly before you thankful that we can do even that.
[time=939] So thankful Father for your great love and your great commitment to us God, a love and a commitment that was willing to send your only son to be born, live and die on this earth, defeat death.
[time=953] And in his resurrection God bring hope and promise to those who would someday know you.
[time=961] God thank you so very much that in knowing him in a relationship God that we have with him God we can through your spirit and through your scriptures grow in that relationship.
[time=972] And God I pray today that you would do that through your spirit and through your word God that you would grow us that we would open our hearts and minds to whatever it is you might need to show us reveal to us teach us for the first time or remind us of
[time=987] Father we pray that your word would do what only your word can do God that it would penetrate deep into our souls God that it would it would expose whatever attitudes or mindsets might need to be exposed God that through the work of your spirit
[time=1005] and through the work of your word today God that we would repent that we would confess whatever might need to be confessed God that we would move away from whatever sin we might need to move away from God that we might experience
[time=1020] not only your direction and guidance but God your grace as well we thank you for it as we learn more about it today God I pray that your grace and your love for us your word and your spirit God your people this amazing family we're able to be a part of God I pray that today all of that would come together
[time=1044] and do a mighty work in each of us and we ask this in your son's name amen you can be seated
[time=1053] well we come this morning to our third point in this series we started two weeks ago and here in this third point we see God's grace seen in the history of three eras of time
[time=1065] three periods of time are mentioned in this great genealogy and in the midst of these three periods of time these three eras of time we see God's grace at work still
[time=1077] you see it there in verse 17 so all the generations from Abraham to David are 14 generations let me say this about that period of time
[time=1087] the first period mentioned here from Abraham to David was that of the patriarchs this would have been the time in Israel's history of Moses and Joshua and the judges it was a period of wandering
[time=1101] a period of enslavement in a foreign land that foreign land would have been what Egypt period of enslavement in a foreign land a period of deliverance a time of covenant making and law giving and of conquest and victory
[time=1119] that first 14 generation long period and you see in the midst of that God's grace again and again and again the second period from David to the deportation or the Babylonian captivity this was a time of monarchy
[time=1138] that's right this is a time when Israel having insisted on having human kings like all the nations around them they had they had Jehovah they had the one living in true God they had the king of all kings but they wanted what everybody else had so
[time=1158] they wined and they nagged and they complained enough and God gave him what they wanted and they soon discovered that those kings more often led them away from God and into trouble then toward God and into peace and blessing and prosperity
[time=1175] this was a period of almost uninterrupted decline the generosity immorality and tragedy there was defeat there was conquest there was exile and the destruction of Jerusalem and its temple only in David
[time=1193] Jehoshaphat Hezekiah and probably we could make a case for Josiah I mean only in those individuals during this period of time was there anything even resembling godliness
[time=1212] and then you have the third period this third era of time from the Babylonian captivity to the time of Christ and this was a time of exile frustration and basically of marking or passing time
[time=1229] of the men Matthew mentions in this period from Shiel Tl to Jacob the father of Joseph most of the men you see here in this Matthew one passage men that come in that period of time we don't even know who they were we know nothing about these guys
[time=1248] other than that Matthew mentions them I mean up until Joseph the father of Mary
[time=1256] was a period of time shrouded largely in darkness and characterized largely by inconsequence it was Israel's dark ages but nevertheless God's grace was at work on behalf of his people through all three periods
[time=1276] it never ceased it never ended it always prevailed the national genealogy of Jesus is one of mingled glory heroism and disgrace one of renown and obscurity Israel rises Israel falls
[time=1291] Israel goes into stagnation Israel rejects and crucifies the Messiah that God sent to them but God in his infinite grace yet sends his Messiah through them
[time=1305] never gives up on his plan never withholds his grace he gives it he extends it and in extending it comes the Messiah God's grace listen God's grace and his faithfulness even through the darkest of times
[time=1325] now let me just ask you this I know a lot of you in this room and I know there are a lot of you in this room who can identify with this can anybody here look back on your family's past and we're talking about family here
[time=1344] we're talking about a family tree we're talking about a lineage here anybody in the room this morning look back on your family's past and see dark days
[time=1361] somebody here in the room this morning look back on your family's past and see difficult times can you look at the lifestyle you grew up with the mindset that you came out of that mindset that you were kind of raised with
[time=1376] scenarios and settings that you found yourself in the addictions or sinful patterns of family members the decisions of others that shaped the possibly difficult course of your life anybody in the room
[time=1390] identify it all with this notion of periods of time dark days and the faithfulness of God some of you can identify with that some of you can look back at the heartache and failure stemming from an unchurched or unbelieving past
[time=1410] while others here in the room have come out of the dysfunction that exists in many Christian homes when we think about periods of time some of us can look back like I can look back
[time=1427] and you can say with me like I often say you can kind of stand there like I stand there at times like I stand here at times and say how in the world did I get here
[time=1448] you ever feel that you ever look at what God's given you you ever do you ever just think about it enough to realize that you know just like getting out of bed and having breath I mean do you ever consider the grace and mercy and faithfulness of God to the extent where you're just absolutely blown away that he gave you another day
[time=1470] not to mention the opportunities that he's put in front of you and me I look at me I look at the road I've traveled I look at what I came out of I look at the circumstances of my life choices that were made
[time=1487] are you kidding me why in the world would all of that lead to this you should have seen I'm glad you didn't you should have seen him at my high school reunion a few years ago
[time=1507] gosh that would have been about three years ago it was our 20th reunion and you know I didn't know the Lord I did not know the Lord I did not have a relationship with Christ in high school I did other things
[time=1523] and so I show up but I didn't go to any other reunions and I come to the 20 year reunion and I graduated with 624 and I think there were probably about 350 or 400 there that night it was it was absolutely amazing to see them all
[time=1542] and their wives and or their husbands I mean it was just an amazing event well I spent the entire I felt like I had just given a sermon I felt I spent the entire night with a line of people because the word got around that bird had become half of them thought I had become a priest
[time=1561] so much booze flowing through the room that night that the story just kind of got going you know what I mean so I had this line of people wanting to talk to me wanting to find out if it was true that I me Kelly bird bird I had become a what
[time=1577] they couldn't they just couldn't comprehend that the guy they knew was now doing this and you got to know that there are days I wake up like I'm sure many of you do and just go wow only by God's what only by God's grace
[time=1600] the events and circumstances of my life should have led me should have led me you know there but by God's grace they've led me here I look at that picture of my family I shared that picture with
[time=1618] many of you during the Christmas with Blackhawk performances I look at that picture of my family and many of you know my story I've been able to share that with you over the years many of you know what I came out of the things I faced the disintegration of
[time=1634] my own family and and my dad's involvement with the church and how confusing all that was for me growing up I was able to share my wife's story during the Christmas with Blackhawk those two weekends and I was really grateful she's not a very public person she wasn't sure she wanted her story out there for the thousands but she was willing to do that hoping maybe it would be an encouragement to some and it turns out it was
[time=1663] but when you hear her story and you realize what she came out of it was so amazing we were sitting talking with a friend a few days after the concerts and he just very insightfully and very lovingly and very gratefully pointed out you know that when you look at me and where I've been you know I should
[time=1681] I mean from a human perspective I mean I should hate the church I should hate the church I should I should distrust God I should be a long long way away from where I am today you look at her and he said you know she should be and I didn't get into all of her story or all of her genealogy but her father's addictions this was not new to their family
[time=1710] she should be an addict somewhere looking for a fix but instead of me hating the church and instead of her being an addict we we get that and we don't do that perfectly but we get to do that by the what by the grace of God
[time=1731] I don't know what your picture looks like but I certainly hope whatever it is whatever it is I hope you view it as a gift and a reminder that the grace of God is bigger than anything you or I have ever done or given ourselves to
[time=1747] be careful on this point here I just wrote this down be careful not to write yourself off a lot of you do that a lot of people I meet they write themselves off due to the years of wandering the years of failure or the years of sin
[time=1763] God's grace is amazing and it cuts through and embraces all of your years of wandering and all of your years of sin
[time=1775] God's grace is also seen point number four here write this down not only is it seen in the choice of one girl not only is it seen in the descendants of two men not only is it seen in the three eras or periods of time but God's grace is seen in a powerful way
[time=1792] in the inclusion of four outcasts that's right we see God's grace in the inclusion of four very interesting very amazing women that's right four women that God includes in this genealogy
[time=1808] for exceptional illustrations of God's grace and they are included here I believe for that reason they are amazing pictures of the grace of God the grace of God evidence towards sinful men and women
[time=1822] and they find themselves here in a list of names that is completely men and here God tucks away these four gals these four fallen sinful women and in bringing them to light he evidences again his great grace outcasts
[time=1845] you ever felt like an outcast anybody you ever felt what it feels like to kind of be on the outside looking in have you ever felt what it's like to kind of be viewed as different or unlovely or as unwanted
[time=1863] or as unattractive or I mean whatever it might be weird odd ever felt like an outcast you know what that's like I do I remember being in I remember being in fourth grade it was about
[time=1878] five eight and wait about sixty pounds and that's that's a that's a little bit of a stretch but not much it was not pretty I just grew to be so tall so if I've told many of you this you know in years come by I mean the head that I have right now I had this head in fourth grade
[time=1897] this was not a good thing these years that I have right here I had these years in kindergarten all right I got abused my friends I mean whatever I've turned into today I mean man oh man it was it was ugly back then
[time=1912] and they just you know how kids can be they just had a hey day with me I was absolutely excluded and abused I didn't get it I want all I want to do was play basketball at recess on the playground
[time=1924] and they wouldn't let me play basketball because I was and I was pretty decent but I was so tall they didn't want I'd go home and cry I didn't get it I thought being tall and good was a good thing why don't they want me on their team they just abused me
[time=1941] I was just viewed as weird and awkward and I was made fun of and God has an amazing way of using the awkward and unlovely he's an amazing way of making himself known to the neglected and unlovely and unwanted
[time=1966] he does amazing things without casts and he sure did here you can write these names down as we go if you'd like to number one the first outcast we'll look at his Tamar and you see Tamar in our list you see Tamar there in verse three Judah was the father of Perez and Zara by you see it by Tamar
[time=1988] Perez was the father of Hezron and Hezron the father of Ram watch this Tamar was the Canaanite or Gentile non Jew the Canaanite daughter-in-law of Judah
[time=2001] God had taken the lives of her husband Ur and of his next oldest brother Onon because of their wickedness because of their sin and because of their evilness God had wiped these guys out leaving her by herself
[time=2014] Judah then took the young childless widow into his own household promising that his third son Shayla would become her husband and raise up children in honor of his brother's name when he grew up
[time=2029] well after Judah failed to keep that promise Shayla did not marry Tamar Tamar in her response and her frustration and hurt she disguises herself you can read about this in Genesis 38 Tamar disguises herself as a prostitute
[time=2047] and tricks Judah into having sexual relations with her from this illicit union from this illicit union were born twin sons Perez and Zara as we learn from the genealogy here in Matthew one Tamar and Perez joined Judah in the messianic line
[time=2069] despite prostitution and incest God's grace fell on all three of those undeserving persons including a desperate and deceptive Gentile harlot
[time=2083] the grace of God
[time=2089] the second outcast also a woman also a Gentile also a prostitute
[time=2098] this one was different though this one was a prostitute not by virtue of a one-time choice this one made a living as a prostitute
[time=2108] Rahab Rahab and inhabitant of the city of Jericho that might ring a bell for a few of you
[time=2117] Rahab was the one who was the prostitute who protected the two Israelite men that Joshua had sent to spy out the city if you'll remember the Israelites were encamped around Jericho
[time=2129] Joshua wants to know what the score is what it's going to be like inside he sends two spies Rahab gives them cover
[time=2137] she was the one who because of her fear of the Lord and her willingness to be used by him she protects these two men as they come and ask her as the messengers of the king of Jericho come and ask her about the spies she covers for them
[time=2154] and because of her choice because of her willingness to honor God God spares her life and the lives of her family when Jericho is in fact besieged and destroyed in Joshua 2 and Joshua 6 she read about that
[time=2169] God's grace watched this God's grace not only spared her life but brought her into the messianic line as the wife later she becomes the wife of Salmon
[time=2180] remember our buddy salmon whose Hebrew name is Salmon Rahab marries him God brings her into this messianic line as the wife of Salmon and the mother of the godly Boaz who was in time David's great grandfather
[time=2202] all because of God's what grace the third outcast was Ruth write that down the third outcast here in this genealogy of Matthew 1 was Ruth the wife of Boaz
[time=2216] like Tamar and Rahab Ruth was a Gentile after her first husband and Israelite had died she returned to Israel with her mother-in-law Naomi
[time=2226] Ruth was a godly loving and sensitive woman who had accepted the Lord has her own God her people the pagan Moabites were the product of an incestuous relationship between lot and his two unmarried daughters
[time=2242] this is what this is what Ruth comes out of you're thinking about what you came out of you're thinking about your family lineage the situations and circumstances of your youth
[time=2254] well Ruth's lineage was the Moabites a group of people who were born out of incest between lot and his two unmarried daughters in order to preserve the family line because they had no husbands or brothers each of the daughters gets their father a lot drunk
[time=2271] causes him to unknowingly have relations with them the son produced by lots union with his oldest daughter was Moab father of a people who became one of Israel's most feared enemies
[time=2284] Milan the Israelite man who married Ruth did so in violation of the Mosaic law and many Jewish writers today see his early death as punishment divine judgment for his disobedience
[time=2298] though she was a Moabite by birth and former pagan with no right to marry an Israelite God's grace not only brought Ruth into the family of Israel but later through Boaz into the royal line she became the grandmother of David
[time=2320] this woman who had no rights this woman who had no business being there this woman who was born out of incest all because of God's what the fourth outcast was a woman we've come to know as Bathsheba
[time=2340] here in Matthew one simply mentioned as the wife of David and former wife of Uriah and we heard that story last week David commits adultery with her and has her husband sent to the battle front to be killed and then takes her as his own wife
[time=2361] the son produced by this adultery died in infancy but the next son born to them was Solomon
[time=2370] successor to David's throne and continue in the messianic line by God's grace Bathsheba became I know it's kind of hard to say it that way it's kind of hard to read it that way but see it's so far beyond
[time=2388] you and me by God's grace Bathsheba became the wife of David the mother of Solomon and an ancestor of the Messiah
[time=2405] you see my friends the genealogy of Jesus Christ that we've been looking at here in Matthew one one to seventeen is immeasurably more than just a list of names
[time=2418] it is even more than a list of Jesus's human forebearers it is a beautiful testimony to God's grace and to the ministry don't miss that
[time=2431] this list is an amazing it's a beautiful testimony to the grace of God and it also speaks to the ministry of his son Jesus Christ who was known as the friend of who
[time=2443] yeah you're right say it louder sinners a friend of sinners who did not come to call let's just look at that you can turn I don't think this will be on the screen go to Matthew just be reminded of this
[time=2457] this is all about the grace of God this is also about the kind of son that Jesus was the kind of man that he was the kind of Lord and Savior that he was go to go to Matthew nine and just be reminded
[time=2470] of his mindset be reminded of his philosophy of ministry if you will if you go to Matthew nine and you pick it up I think they're in verse ten
[time=2479] Matthew nine verse ten let me just read this for you as we come to the conclusion of this genealogy and these many evidences of God's grace look at the graceful king that it produced
[time=2493] you with me Matthew nine verse ten then it happened that as Jesus was reclining at the table in the house behold many tax collectors and sinners came and were dining with Jesus and his disciples stop right there
[time=2510] all right just think about that for a moment think about the kind of reputation okay this is Jesus this is the great rabbi here he is doing what he's doing and think about the kind of reputation he must have had
[time=2522] think about how they must have seen him think about how they must have viewed him think about how folks must have talked about him if as he's here reclining at the table in the house behold many many tax collectors and sinners
[time=2536] some of the most unlovely some of the most unwelcomed outcasts that that society knew came and were dining with Jesus now it doesn't seem if they came unannounced it doesn't say that he invited them the fact
[time=2553] of the matter is though that in that culture what there wouldn't have been a greater signal there wouldn't have been a greater sign of of community of hey he's with me and I with him there wouldn't have been a better setting for relationship
[time=2568] and closeness than a meal shared many tax collectors many and many sinners came and were dining with Jesus and his disciples when the Pharisees saw this they said to his disciples
[time=2586] why is your teacher why is your rabbi eating with the tax collectors and sinners but when Jesus heard this I love that it happens often times in the gospel I love it when they're asking the disciples a question sometimes it's kind of like that
[time=2601] I don't know because I wasn't there but I kind of get that remember growing up watching the six million dollar man anybody remember the six million dollar man and he had that big the big time ear thing going on right so he's over here at the other side of a room and somebody's asking a question over here and it's like
[time=2615] Jesus kind of goes hold on let me answer that question for you and the Pharisees they're so weak and pathetic they're over here warming around trying to ask the disciples a question they should have asked him while he hears it
[time=2628] I don't know if he was across the room or right next to him but he answers let me answer that for you you want to know why I'm dining with you want to know why I'm communing with sinners when Jesus heard this he said
[time=2644] it is not those who are healthy who need a physician but those who are what but go and learn what this means I desire compassion and not sacrifice for I did not come to call the righteous but I came to call who
[time=2668] this genealogy is a beautiful testimony to God's grace and to the ministry and life and character of his son amen now all of that's for not all three weeks all seventeen verses all those names and all those amazing stories
[time=2689] all of its for not unless you and I leave this place and actually actually do something about it it's called application you and I have got to bring we've got to bring application to this and I believe God is so honored and so glorified when you and I are willing to read it and study it and take it in that's good but we've got to then allow it to change and alter the way we live
[time=2716] it's called maturing it's called growing in your faith it's you and I allowing these words and these truths to make a difference so here you go couple two three things to take home
[time=2728] there's probably seven or eight things that we could derive from this but let's just start with three things to take home some truth to take with you as we think about these three weeks and the grace of God number one write this down the grace of God is bigger than all
[time=2742] underline all circle all write it down the grace of God is bigger than all of your sin the grace of God is bigger broader and more abundant than the failure sin and folly of all of mankind not just your sin but mine
[time=2759] and not just your sin in mind but his and hers and theirs see the grace of God is bigger than it all more abundant than it all three key words no matter what God's grace is bigger than any place you and I have gone anything you and I have done any choice you and I have made
[time=2784] do you think your sin some of us do think this at times do you think your sin and failure are too messy for you to ever be used by him well now you and I can just look at our Lord Jesus Christ's family picture
[time=2806] right you just look at the line you just look at the genealogy that leads to the Messiah and that question is answered and cleared up right there the grace of God is bigger broader and more abundant than the failure sin and folly of all mankind
[time=2828] now it's very important that while readily admitting that and seeing that it's very important that you write this next one down as well number two God's readiness to extend grace in no way removes our responsibility to pursue holiness
[time=2847] you with me with God's grace personal holiness the pursuit of God honoring living is still required see there's no there's no getting out of bed for you and I saying hey you know what it just doesn't matter because this grace covers
[time=2862] that all I'll go live how I want to live do what I want to do do whatever feels right do whatever feels good and at the end of the day I'm just you know it doesn't work that way we talked about that a few weeks ago that's called presuming upon
[time=2876] the grace of God and you and I do not want to be presumptuous with God first Peter 1 13 through 16 lot of different passages we could have gone to but just read this with me look at this I'll read it you follow along
[time=2891] first Peter 1 13 to 16 describing what though God's grace is real and though God's grace is powerful and though God's grace covers it all there is still this opportunity and responsibility on your part
[time=2905] and mine to get up each day and live life a certain way in a certain direction with a certain heart here you go therefore prepare your minds for action keep sober in spirit
[time=2918] picture hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ as obedient children do not be conformed to the former lusts which were yours in your ignorance
[time=2934] the way you used to think the way you used to live but like the holy one who called you be holy holy remember set apart distinct and different set apart to God but like the holy one who called you be holy yourselves also in
[time=2953] what in some of your behavior no in all of your behaviors is be holy for 16 because it is written you shall be holy for I am holy don't forget that don't let me forget that I won't let you forget that
[time=2976] God's grace is bigger than all of your sin and mine that in no way removes you and I from the watch this from the privilege it's not like some responsibility no it's a privilege
[time=2989] it's really an amazing endeavor it's a wonderful life to live to get up each day and do your best with his help alongside me me alongside you and pursue holiness
[time=3000] sure the grace of God is an amazing thing and his willingness to extend it again and again and again is always amazing again and again and again but it doesn't ever reduce the opportunity and calling on you and I to live lives daily
[time=3016] in obedience to him living holy lives because he is holy number three just write this down take this with you as you go he is gracious actually let me say it to you this way
[time=3035] answer me okay is he forgiving yes or no is he forgiving yes or no yeah he's forgiving and he calls you and I to be what to be forgiving he gives us that amazing illustration there in the gospels the story of the unmerciful servant you remember that
[time=3058] the immerciful servant the the servant who owed the king more than he could ever ever repay this guy had a debt that there was there was no way no matter how hard he worked no matter what he did this this servant was not going to be able to repay the king what he owed him sound familiar
[time=3075] and the king wipes it out says it's gone merry christmas he didn't say that I was just feeling in the moment here the debt's gone millions and millions of dollars let's say and the guy leaves the king's presence goes out finds the dude who owes him a buck fifty puts his hands around his neck and starts to choke him
[time=3098] say give me my money king hears about it throws him back in prison says shame on you you were forgiven so much and you couldn't forgive that see God is a forgiving God right amen and he calls you and I to be what is is God yes or no is God a loving God and God calls you and I to be what loving
[time=3127] from the heart right agape right I love you I sacrifice for you I give myself to you my son my daughter my wife my friend I love you he's a loving God who calls his people to be a loving people right
[time=3143] okay yes or no is God gracious my goodness is he gracious yeah hey you know what my friends be gracious be gracious be a gracious people I know I know what he did was awful
[time=3169] I know what she said was despicable yeah I know what they did hurts you deeply I understand that the grace of God what we've learned about the grace of God is that it is the extending of and the giving of unmerited favor
[time=3191] and you say well they don't deserve it well you know what neither did you and neither did I neither do you neither do I but he keeps extending it day after I scratch he keeps extending it moment by moment
[time=3209] and you and I need to be a gracious people and I hope that you will be some of you in the room today need to for the very first time experience the grace of God it's how salvation takes place it's how it's how you come into this life changing
[time=3231] eternity altering relationship that you hear us talk so much about Ephesians 2 says that by grace by God's grace through faith your willingness to believe and even the faith we learned last week is a gift
[time=3247] God's word says that by grace his grace through faith the belief that you would exercise then and only then are you welcomed into and brought into this saving relationship with Jesus Christ some in the room today maybe it's time for you
[time=3266] to confess over that line to confess and to proclaim with your mouth and your heart your love for him and your gratitude for what he has done and by his grace profess your love and your trust in him
[time=3280] others of you in the room today you've known him for two years five years 10 15 20 30 years maybe today you need a reminder maybe these three weeks for you have been a reminder of how very gracious he has been
[time=3294] with them but with you and maybe you need to be a little bit more gracious with those that he has brought into your life a roommate a family member a difficult neighbor I don't know
[time=3313] what I've done whatever they've said however difficult they've made it for you remember he was gracious with you be gracious be so very gracious and thank God for this amazing family that he used to bring us the Messiah
[time=3333] what a ray of hope for all of us if he can do that with them what can he do with you and I in our willingness and readiness to not only receive his grace but to then exercise it as well would you stand with me and with your eyes closed and your heads bowed
[time=3351] let me just remind you of this there wouldn't be anything for those of us here at Blackhawk for the team of people that minister here on a regular basis for even the family of folks who call this place home there wouldn't be anything more enjoyable
[time=3369] more meaningful more special to us than having the privilege of praying with you talking with you about your spiritual journey and maybe even on your journey he has brought you to a point today where you would want to finally kind of draw that line in the sand and put that stake in the ground that says I believe I am fully and completely his
[time=3392] and if you need some help with that please come and let us know if you have a trusted friend who you can talk with about those things I encourage you to do that I implore you to do that I beg you not to not to leave this place or not to let the sun go down tonight
[time=3409] without initiating that conversation with that friend who you know loves you cares for you not only physically and personally but spiritually you know they have a heart for you because you know they have a heart for God
[time=3425] we can do to help introduce you to the life changing grace of God we would love nothing more father we leave this place today so very grateful as we said earlier God humbled that in each and every life here in this room God there stands today a story
[time=3451] and for so many of us father that know you for so many of us in the room lord who lived today in that life changing relationship with you God our eternities have been altered and we have the promise of salvation
[time=3466] God many of us in the room as we stand here having experienced that realize that what we've come out of God choices that have been made decisions that were followed families that we were a part of circumstances God in settings
[time=3484] from early on for many of us in the room God we realize that where we are now in comparison to where we should be God it is an amazing picture of your grace and your faithfulness and your love
[time=3500] God I pray that there would be a deep sense of gratitude in our hearts for that and at the same time God a growing and deep sense of need in our hearts and lives to evidence that God to extend that to be a gracious people
[time=3517] God we thank you so very much for this study for this Messiah who you brought Lord this king who came and will rule one day God we're so thankful that we were able to yesterday celebrate his birth so thankful that today we can continue to celebrate his birth and his life
[time=3537] God I pray that as we leave today that you would be honored we pray that you have been and we pray God that as we leave this place to pursue holy living God that we would do so with whole hearts
[time=3552] thank you for the grace that will go with us and God thank you for the privilege of being your children we proclaim all of this God we say all of this and we lift this prayer in your son's name and all the people agreed and said amen
