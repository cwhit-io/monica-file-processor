[time=30] (upbeat music)
[time=60] - Hi, I'm Mitch, and I'd like to thank you for joining us here for the Bible Hour.
[time=78] You're gonna see a message about an idea that I'd like you to consider.
[time=81] Do you ever notice how much we compartmentalize our lives?
[time=87] I think about it a lot at New Year's because it's the time we tend to make resolutions and they fit in five areas that we have compartmentalized our lives.
[time=96] In the first one's physical, we make resolutions about our bodies.
[time=101] Mental would be the second one.
[time=103] We say I'm gonna read a book or get this degree or a particular set of education.
[time=108] Third, we say social categories.
[time=111] We say we wanna get out with a certain group of friends more often.
[time=115] That fourth area would be financial.
[time=117] We set financial goals, sales, profit, bottom line, budgets, whatever it is.
[time=122] And then finally, the fifth area is spiritual.
[time=127] So what we do is we even compartmentalize God.
[time=132] And that's what this message is about.
[time=134] It's entitled water.
[time=136] And water is symbolic for the Spirit of God throughout the Bible.
[time=140] And I'm gonna talk about how we compartmentalize the Spirit of God from different parts of
[time=146] our lives and become God-little-g in that area of our lives.
[time=150] So I hope you enjoy it and hope you are encouraged to release the flow of the Holy Spirit in
[time=157] your life.
[time=158] I'd like to invite you to our Wednesday night services, Common Ground, 6.45 to 8.15 PM.
[time=166] It's preceded by simple suppers that begin at 5.15 PM.
[time=171] And we also have an open, faith-based AA meeting that's called Into Action.
[time=178] And that's from 5.30 to 6.45.
[time=181] And I wanna thank you for joining us and being a part of our extended family.
[time=186] In a few weeks, we're gonna begin a series on First Peter.
[time=190] And we're gonna go verse by verse, really, really enjoy making that relevant to our lives.
[time=197] And we hope you join us, thank you so much.
[time=225] I love that song communicates a great passage
[time=254] of Scripture or the theme of it, at least.
[time=258] And the first chapter of Job talks about how God had sovereignly ordained hardship to
[time=265] come to Job, and Job had a great response.
[time=271] He mourned, but at the same time, he fell on his face and he worshiped God in the midst
[time=278] of the hardship that came his way.
[time=279] And that song communicates both the hard times and the good times.
[time=287] And you see God's sovereignly ordained hardship that he allows to take place all over in the
[time=296] Bible, in the Old Testament, in the New.
[time=299] He sovereignly ordains that Ruth experiences hardship, that the nation of Israel experiences
[time=305] hardship when they're exiled into Babylon.
[time=310] And then he sovereignly ordained that time with Job, but then also even when his son came to earth, God allows suffering to take place.
[time=318] He allows hard times to happen, even to himself or to the person of Jesus Christ who is God.
[time=326] And then he does it again with the New Testament church.
[time=329] And it's first started, he sovereignly ordained for them to experience persecution.
[time=335] And he says that it will happen again and it's happening today and it's just part of the way God works.
[time=340] He allows things to happen.
[time=341] And so what that means for us is that we come in here today and not everyone's feeling the best.
[time=348] Because sometimes God allows bad things and hard things to happen and it gets you down.
[time=354] But just like Job, we want to have his response, we want to mourn in a godly way where we experience the fullness of the sorrow, but at the same time we experience worship and joy in knowing who God is in the midst of it.
[time=368] I went to a conference about a year ago and I heard Matt Redmond talk a little bit about that song that he wrote and he said that the reason he wrote it is because he stumbled
[time=378] on a verse that isn't mentioned in the song and the verses in Romans chapter 12 and the verse says very simply rejoice with those who rejoice mourn with those who mourn.
[time=389] And Paul is writing to the body of Christ and he's saying be happy and celebrate with
[time=395] those who celebrate and then at the same time be sad and mourn and experience the heart
[time=401] ache with those who are experiencing heart ache.
[time=404] And a lot of times through our music, musical worship on a Sunday morning, we come in and
[time=410] many times we expect people to rejoice with those who rejoice.
[time=414] But this morning, after singing that song and into this next song, we want to have a chance as a body of Christ to mourn with those who mourn.
[time=422] And we want to sing a song that is about sorrow and hardship and having questions that don't
[time=430] get answered and not understanding why things happen because we don't have the whole picture yet because we know in part.
[time=438] And some of you are going to see these words on the screen and identify with them right away with something that's happening in your life today and you're going to want to sing them and meditate on them and pray them because of what's going on in your life right now.
[time=451] Others may read the screen and say, wow, I can't relate with that.
[time=454] And you have the opportunity then this morning to mourn with those who mourn by singing the song with them and saying that you are still worship God through the suffering and through the sorrow and through the hardships.
[time=466] Maybe this morning you can't even sing the song and that's okay.
[time=471] We're going to sing it and we want to invite you to join in at any time when you feel comfortable.
[time=476] But really listen to the words and jump on the opportunity that we have that we don't get very often to mourn with those who mourn today.
[time=495] I've had questions without answers, I've known sorrow, I have known pain.
[time=520] But there's one thing that will cling to, you are faithful, Jesus your truth.
[time=534] When hope is lost, I'll call you safe, you're when pain surrounds, I'll call you healer.
[time=548] When silence froze, you'll be the song within my heart.
[time=557] My sorrow, the darkest night of my soul, you surround me and sustain me.
[time=582] My tender forever when hope is lost, I'll call you safe, you're when pain surrounds, I'll
[time=601] call you healer, when silence falls, you'll be the song within my heart.
[time=618] I will praise you, I will praise you, when the tears fall, 'til I will sing to you.
[time=634] When hope is lost, I'll call you safe, you're when pain surrounds, I'll call you healer.
[time=661] When silence falls, you'll be the song within my heart.
[time=675] I will praise you, I will praise you, when the tears fall, 'til I will sing to you.
[time=690] I will praise you, when Jesus prays you, 'til the suffering still I will sing.
[time=720] I will praise you, when Jesus prays you, when Jesus prays you, when Jesus prays you,
[time=760] when confusion is all around me, with darkness is my closest friend, still I'll praise you,
[time=778] when Jesus prays you.
[time=786] God we recognize that you are the Savior for our hopelessness, you are the healer for
[time=794] our pain, and God you are the song in the silence, and as Bachic says, "When loser
[time=807] draw on this side as far as man measures things, we will praise you for your God."
[time=817] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=820] Hi I'm Mitch, oh not bad, first of all I need a lot of help.
[time=829] I'm a teaching pastor here at Black Hawk and I help serve with evangelism and outreach, so thank you for allowing me to be here, and it's new years and I want to ask you a question.
[time=844] Have you ever noticed how we compartmentalize our lives?
[time=850] Have you ever noticed how we compartmentalize our lives, and it becomes more evident I think
[time=857] at New Year's because we make New Year's resolutions, and we make them in about five areas of our lives, and first there would be a physical compartment, we make New Year's
[time=868] resolutions about our bodies, the second one would be the mental compartment.
[time=874] We make New Year's resolutions and we set goals about books we're going to read or degrees
[time=881] we're going to get.
[time=883] The third area would be social or relationship oriented compartment, where we would set resolutions
[time=889] about friends we're going to get together with, or things we're going to accomplish relationally with people.
[time=895] We have the financial compartment and we make goals, especially if we're in the marketplace,
[time=901] we make goals on finances, on the amount of money we want to earn, or sales that we're going to have, and we do this and we make strong, willed choices.
[time=912] And then the fifth compartment would be the spiritual one.
[time=916] We make goals or resolutions about maybe we're going to go to church more often, or maybe we're going to get involved in some ministry.
[time=924] So I used to sit down every January 1st and I set goals because I read a book that told me to, in each one of those compartments of my life.
[time=934] And I found that a funny thing would happen, that I would then take control of that compartment
[time=941] of my life, and I had created a boundary that didn't exist prior and I kept God out of it.
[time=950] Then as I would study the Bible more, and as I surrendered my life more and more to Christ and grew in my relationship with Him, I found that when I would sit down on January 1st, what I would write down was much more a matter of the heart of releasing the Holy Spirit
[time=965] in me in those compartments.
[time=969] So that's what I want to talk about today, and I need five volunteers.
[time=973] I need five people, and the first one I need is somebody to represent the physical compartment.
[time=979] So who wants to represent the physical compartment?
[time=983] Call for to me!
[time=985] That would be my very fine spacey man of physical fitness.
[time=989] Oh baby, you want to feel my muscle?
[time=993] Oh, they're good for you, yeah.
[time=996] Hey, meet you.
[time=997] How you doing?
[time=998] I'm glad to be here today.
[time=999] Oh, you're looking good.
[time=1000] Thank you for having me.
[time=1001] Excellent.
[time=1002] That kind of hurt.
[time=1003] You feel kind of motion?
[time=1005] I work hard for that motion.
[time=1007] I need to come to the Center for Physical Fitness, and we will pop you up.
[time=1012] Thank you.
[time=1014] Here's what I need you to do.
[time=1015] Just grab a glass, a cup, and go back there in one of the students.
[time=1018] Glasses.
[time=1019] All right.
[time=1020] Now I need...
[time=1021] You're the man.
[time=1022] Now I need somebody to be an imagerist symbol for the mental part of life, our intellect.
[time=1029] Is there anybody here, you sir in the back, yes, with the book, yeah, and the pipe.
[time=1036] Please, if you could come forward, that would help me.
[time=1040] You know, I'm a little nervous doing this, but as I say, those who can do, and those
[time=1049] who can't teach, so it's me.
[time=1055] I guess it can't be all that bad now, can it?
[time=1057] Dr. Mitchell P. Cruz III.
[time=1059] Thank you.
[time=1060] Take a cup, and go back to the stool beside Hans or Vladimir.
[time=1069] Is there anybody who would be kind enough to volunteer for the social part of our lives?
[time=1077] Hello.
[time=1078] Anybody?
[time=1079] Yeah.
[time=1080] Oh, just a minute.
[time=1081] Any back here?
[time=1082] Right here?
[time=1083] Where are you?
[time=1084] Oh, yeah.
[time=1085] Okay.
[time=1086] Could you come up?
[time=1087] That would be good.
[time=1088] You'd be the social part?
[time=1089] Okay.
[time=1090] Hey.
[time=1091] She's on the phone.
[time=1092] That's good.
[time=1093] That's perfect.
[time=1094] Come on up.
[time=1095] I'm at church right now.
[time=1096] Yeah, that's okay.
[time=1097] But it's okay because Pastor Kelly's not here, it's just Mitch.
[time=1101] Yeah.
[time=1102] No.
[time=1103] Okay.
[time=1104] Well, can I call you back in just a few minutes?
[time=1105] Okay, thanks.
[time=1106] Bye.
[time=1107] Sorry.
[time=1108] My life.
[time=1109] Sorry.
[time=1110] You don't know problem.
[time=1111] Yeah, you'll be perfect for the role.
[time=1112] Perfect.
[time=1113] Thank you.
[time=1114] That's, yeah, the seat back there.
[time=1115] Talk to those two guys.
[time=1116] Of course, I need a kind of a strong, willed person.
[time=1120] I need somebody for the fighting, representing the financial part of our life.
[time=1124] You're good at making decisions.
[time=1125] You're into the marketplace.
[time=1127] How about Jeff Winkler?
[time=1128] Where are you, Jeff?
[time=1129] Jeff, come on up.
[time=1130] You're studying to do all that.
[time=1131] And Palm Beach?
[time=1132] Jeff, how are you?
[time=1134] This is all me, man.
[time=1136] Have a seat, Jeff.
[time=1137] Okay.
[time=1138] I don't.
[time=1139] Tim Johnson.
[time=1140] How are you, Mitch?
[time=1141] Good to see you.
[time=1142] You want to take a cup and go back there?
[time=1143] That'd be great.
[time=1145] I need someone who could represent the spiritual compartment of our lives.
[time=1151] Is there anybody here who could, oh, yes, with your hand up there?
[time=1154] Well, this is just perfect.
[time=1155] Look, I've got this alister.
[time=1156] Go to church.
[time=1157] Shake hands with a pastor.
[time=1158] Oh, thank you.
[time=1162] If you want to just take a cup and walk straight back about 10 steps and go to that final stool in BC.
[time=1167] Hey, baby cakes.
[time=1168] You want to fill my muzzle?
[time=1170] Wow.
[time=1171] Yes.
[time=1172] The message title today is water.
[time=1179] And water is symbolized throughout the Old Testament for the spirit of God, for the
[time=1186] spirit of God.
[time=1189] And what we do when we compartmentalize our lives is we harden our heart in a few areas
[time=1196] and we stop the flow of the Holy Spirit in our lives and we become God, little G, in
[time=1203] that area.
[time=1204] So we have a physical compartment.
[time=1210] We have the intellect or the mental compartment.
[time=1215] We have the social, emotional, relational type compartment.
[time=1222] We have the financial, strong will, good marketplace choices compartment.
[time=1229] Easy, easy.
[time=1233] There we go.
[time=1234] And then we have the spiritual compartment.
[time=1242] Do you see that last one?
[time=1246] Partly because of the Greek philosophy that Alexander the Great conquered the world with.
[time=1251] Partly, because I think from the first sin, we have compartmentalized God.
[time=1263] We have compartmentalized God and dammed the flow of the Holy Spirit in each area of
[time=1271] our lives.
[time=1272] We created boundaries that didn't exist.
[time=1273] We've hardened our hearts in those areas of our lives and we've become God, little G,
[time=1282] in that area of our lives.
[time=1283] And God did not intend it to be that way.
[time=1289] We have compartmentalized God.
[time=1294] I want to show you the verse, the theme verse for today, through which we're going to see everything that we say and it's Jeremiah 213, if you want to stand up and read it with me.
[time=1306] Jeremiah 213, let me set the scene for you.
[time=1309] Babylon's getting ready to take Judah in captivity because you'll see in verse 11 if you open your Bible that they forsaken God and they had taken idols.
[time=1319] And here's what God says.
[time=1322] My people have committed two sins, they have forsaken me, the spring of living water and
[time=1332] have dug their own cisterns, broken cisterns that cannot hold water.
[time=1341] Let's pray.
[time=1343] And now God may your spirit flow.
[time=1351] May I model what you're teaching and may each heart hear.
[time=1357] Feel the presence of you and the flow of your Holy Spirit.
[time=1361] In Jesus' mighty name we pray, amen.
[time=1365] You may be seated.
[time=1367] Now listen, see did I say sit it?
[time=1371] You Americans are so poorly read.
[time=1374] Seated.
[time=1375] All right.
[time=1376] So we have five compartments.
[time=1378] We have built five cisterns.
[time=1380] We've committed two sins.
[time=1382] We forsaken the spring of living water.
[time=1385] The psalmist say we have a thirst for God.
[time=1388] It's interesting in the Garden of Eden it says that there was a river flowing and out of that river flowed the four rivers we talk about in the Garden of Eden.
[time=1397] Throughout the prophets, they prophesied that one day a river will flow, meaning the
[time=1405] Holy Spirit water will flow from the temple which they believed to be at the core or
[time=1411] the belly of the earth, the navel of the earth they called it.
[time=1416] All right.
[time=1417] So water is symbolic for the Holy Spirit and we've committed two sins.
[time=1423] We've created five cisterns, five cisterns where we've hardened our heart, compartmentalized
[time=1430] our lives and dammed the flow of the Holy Spirit and Jesus said those who dammed the
[time=1437] flow of the Holy Spirit in their lives will be dammed at judgment.
[time=1444] So this is serious.
[time=1447] First we have the physical cistern.
[time=1449] You want to stand up?
[time=1450] Vladimir.
[time=1451] You'll complete.
[time=1453] You must have good physique.
[time=1455] To feel complete, you must have good physique.
[time=1457] I like that.
[time=1458] How do we compartmentalize God out of the physical?
[time=1463] It kind of goes one or two ways but the bottom line is we use the physical for our own satisfaction.
[time=1469] So let's go the one way.
[time=1471] We eat whatever we want to eat for our satisfaction.
[time=1475] We drink whatever we want to drink and how much we want to drink it for our satisfaction.
[time=1480] Might eat protein.
[time=1482] Fish.
[time=1483] Eggs.
[time=1485] There you go.
[time=1486] We might abuse substances.
[time=1491] Maybe it's anything from illegal drugs and steroids.
[time=1497] Okay.
[time=1498] Just check it.
[time=1499] From creams.
[time=1500] What?
[time=1501] Creams.
[time=1503] Okay.
[time=1504] And we do all of that for our own satisfaction.
[time=1508] We even work out and build our bodies for our own satisfaction.
[time=1512] Okay.
[time=1513] So we kind of go the other way and it's like what we're not going to eat and it's how we're going to how much harder we're going to work out.
[time=1518] But the bottom line is that all is about me.
[time=1522] Well God never intended it to be that way.
[time=1524] Let's look at 1 Corinthians 6, 19 and 20.
[time=1529] 1 Corinthians 6, 19 and 20.
[time=1531] Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you whom you have
[time=1540] received from God.
[time=1542] You are not your own.
[time=1544] You were bought at a price.
[time=1546] Therefore honor God with your body.
[time=1551] Now this is lifted from a sexual faithfulness or lack of it context and that's another way
[time=1557] that we abuse our bodies and build the cistern and harden our heart, stop the flow of the Holy Spirit and make it all about me, God with a little G in that area of my life.
[time=1567] But God didn't intend it to be that way.
[time=1570] So I got to think and how can I better release the Holy Spirit in my physical life.
[time=1577] And so when I started thinking more about bringing God into what I ate to be more thankful,
[time=1584] to not get so hung up on not eating that and eating this and offending the people I'm around and here's what I did on the workout thing.
[time=1592] I decided to, if I was on a treadmill to put in a worship DVD or a CD if I was running outside, if I was on the elliptical machine where you can read because there's less impact, I'd read the Bible.
[time=1602] And so I still try to do that.
[time=1604] I'll read the Bible for on that day for 40 minutes to an hour in that setting.
[time=1608] Wait, wait, wait.
[time=1611] Eric and Macy, Doran are, they are needed in nursery.
[time=1617] That's what the sign said.
[time=1619] Eric, Doran, Macy, over this way.
[time=1622] Thank you.
[time=1623] It's true.
[time=1624] It's not part of the act.
[time=1625] All right, so...
[time=1628] You can read.
[time=1630] I just read.
[time=1634] Droveau, thank you.
[time=1643] Maybe you, maybe you can do that and bring the flow of the Holy Spirit into your physical
[time=1651] life, into your body.
[time=1654] Maybe that's by not having the sexual infidelity that you're contemplating or in.
[time=1663] Maybe that's by lightening it up on what you eat and what you drink.
[time=1668] Maybe that's getting a little more intentional about what you eat or what you drink.
[time=1671] Maybe it's when you work out, if you're going to do that, that you bring the Spirit of God into that.
[time=1677] I was on the board of the YMCA after I was running outside and there was something happening.
[time=1682] I was listening to worship music and the blood was flowing and oxygen was flowing and something
[time=1689] unique happens when you worship God like that in that kind of a setting.
[time=1693] So I went to the Y director and I said, "Hey, I think that we ought to have this thing called praise aerobics where we play worship music with a good groove."
[time=1703] They work out to that.
[time=1704] I think it would be huge.
[time=1706] I said, "Something happens when you do that." Then he did it and it ended up being the most popular class.
[time=1712] In fact, you couldn't get in because it was sold out.
[time=1716] So it's amazing.
[time=1717] I encourage you to do that.
[time=1719] Well, my people, believers, have committed two sins.
[time=1724] We forsaken the spring of living water.
[time=1727] This is our symbol of the spring of living water since it didn't bring a hose on stage.
[time=1731] And we've dug cisterns, five cisterns, cisterns that are broken and can't hold water physical,
[time=1739] social, financial, spiritual.
[time=1742] Now, we're going to look at the intellect, mental.
[time=1746] What we do here is we get knowledge for knowledge's sake apart from God.
[time=1754] And we grow in that and then we go on autopilot and we just make decisions, make decisions based on the way we were taught and the knowledge that we got apart from God.
[time=1763] And we just go on autopilot.
[time=1766] What kind of happens is our thoughts become a very safe place for a Christian to sin,
[time=1776] to lust for someone who's not your spouse, to desire a life that you don't have.
[time=1785] And it's interesting that those thoughts will eventually come out.
[time=1788] We don't think they will, but they eventually come out of our mouth in the social compartment.
[time=1792] They eventually come out with the way we live and steward our bodies.
[time=1798] And so here's what I'm asking you to do.
[time=1802] To release the Holy Spirit in your thoughts.
[time=1805] Look at what 2 Corinthians 10-5 says.
[time=1808] 2 Corinthians 10-5 says, "We demolish arguments in every pretension," see, we have a tendency to pretend that we're smarter than we are, "that sets itself up against the knowledge of God and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ."
[time=1825] We take captive every thought, not some, and make it obedient to Christ.
[time=1830] I don't think you will succeed at that if you don't first release the Holy Spirit in
[time=1837] your life and learn more about the Bible.
[time=1841] And so here's what I want to ask you to do.
[time=1843] I'm going to ask you to do one or two things, but it involves reading your Bible every day.
[time=1853] I've tried to read through a translation, a different translation, every six months to a year.
[time=1858] I'm going to take a couple guys through the Bible this year by reading only four chapters a day, four chapters a day, and you can get through the Bible in a year.
[time=1868] You need to do that to take every thought, captive, and obedient to Christ.
[time=1873] You've got to have the Word of God in you.
[time=1876] Now if you say, "Oh, Mitch, I can't do it," nope, just can't do it.
[time=1879] And here's what I'm going to ask you to do.
[time=1880] I'm going to ask you to pick even little bitty parts of Scripture and memorize them.
[time=1885] So write that down.
[time=1886] You're either going to read the Bible through into your four chapters a day or you're going to memorize Scripture.
[time=1892] I go to extremes and I was doing this and I was trying to change this in my life.
[time=1895] And I was on an airplane and I memorized a sermon on the Mount and I think it's 119 verses and I'm going through them and I'm going through them and you kind of know how you go through them and you stop and you're trying to remember and a little bit of time it goes by.
[time=1907] I remember looking at my watch and thought, "Man, on this airplane that time it just flown." And it just hit me that I would think about typically whatever was in front of me, whatever
[time=1918] I wanted to do, whatever I'd harden my heart about, whatever picture, whatever person, whatever was in front of me, that's where my thoughts would go.
[time=1924] And then I realized I can take every thought and make it obedient to Christ and the flow
[time=1932] of the Holy Spirit by drinking of the living water changes me and the cistern goes away.
[time=1939] My people, believers, have committed two sins.
[time=1943] They have forsaken the spring of living water, the Spirit of God, and dug cisterns, broken
[time=1951] cisterns that won't hold water, five of them, physical, mental, social, financial, and spiritual.
[time=1961] Let's look at the social.
[time=1965] What we do when we build this cistern and we dam the flow of the Holy Spirit in our lives, the water, we create this compartment, oh, you got a call.
[time=1974] Oh, you got a call.
[time=1978] Did you hire her?
[time=1982] Well, of course he's wearing black.
[time=1983] He always wears black.
[time=1985] Yeah.
[time=1986] Okay.
[time=1987] I'll tell him.
[time=1988] Okay.
[time=1989] Bye.
[time=1990] You know, we go to fashion shows and stuff all the time and she said to tell you that black is in.
[time=1992] Oh, good.
[time=1993] She looked trim too.
[time=1994] Yes, it does.
[time=1996] Okay.
[time=1997] So what we do with the social compartment is we have friends.
[time=2000] We make relationships, right, that's now for our benefit only.
[time=2007] I can't tell you how many times, Kelly and Stephen, I have heard.
[time=2011] I want to marry him or I want to marry her because he or she completes me translated.
[time=2019] I'm building a cistern, a cracked cistern that will not hold water because my completion
[time=2026] needs to come from the flow of the Holy Spirit in me.
[time=2031] We do it with our children.
[time=2033] We do it with our social relationships, it might be for benefit for us for business.
[time=2039] But God's designed something different.
[time=2042] First John 4, 19 to 21, let's look at it.
[time=2045] First John 4, 19 through 21 and you can't compartmentalize God in your relationships
[time=2054] because God is love and he loved us first.
[time=2058] There is no such thing as being in the kind of social relationship God's designed for
[time=2065] you and not making it about other people.
[time=2069] God loved the God, a self-sacrificial serving love.
[time=2072] It's about others' relationship for their benefit with God.
[time=2077] God loved us first, first 20.
[time=2081] If anyone says I love God yet, he hates his brother and we tend to do that, right?
[time=2084] We've got the companions or the friends that we want, we've got the ones we don't want.
[time=2088] So if anybody hates his brother, Jesus said everyone's your brother, he's a liar.
[time=2093] For anyone who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen.
[time=2099] And he has given us this command, whoever loves God, self-sacrificial, loves God, agape
[time=2105] love, must also self-sacrificial love his brother.
[time=2109] It's interesting, Proverbs 1824 talks about this kind of a person and this kind of a heart
[time=2115] and this kind of a sister, and it says a man of many companions may come to ruin.
[time=2121] But there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother the way God designed it to be a real friend by releasing the Holy Spirit in my relationships.
[time=2129] A man of many companions in Hebrew, many companions, and ruin is the same root word.
[time=2137] And it's a picture, get this, it's a picture, of hardening my heart and making a sister,
[time=2143] a crack sister that won't hold water, and it breaking to pieces when it gets brittle.
[time=2148] That's the picture that it makes, it's amazing.
[time=2153] James 4-4 says this, "You adulterous people, don't you know that friendship with the world
[time=2160] is hatred toward God.
[time=2162] Anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God." And does that say that I shouldn't be a friend of sinners like Jesus was?
[time=2173] Well if you read the three verses before it, it doesn't mean that at all.
[time=2176] It's being a friend of the world.
[time=2178] It's building a cistern that I will make every relationship about me and for my benefit.
[time=2185] That's what that context is.
[time=2188] So what would happen if in 2005 you'd release the Holy Spirit in your relationships?
[time=2197] Your friends with people who are outside the kingdom, that would be evangelistic.
[time=2202] Your friends with people who are inside the kingdom, that would be discipleship, they might disciple me.
[time=2208] This is what convicted me to start a small group and get couples together who are thirsty for God and get them out of their systems and out of their compartmentalization of life
[time=2219] and release the Holy Spirit in them.
[time=2222] What would it look like in 2005 if you would release the Holy Spirit in your relationships?
[time=2229] My people have committed two sins.
[time=2232] They have forsaken me, the spring of living water, and dug sisters for themselves, broken
[time=2240] sisters which cannot hold water, five of them, physical, mental, social, financial, and spiritual.
[time=2252] Let's look at financial.
[time=2257] You can be seated.
[time=2258] That would be all right.
[time=2259] What we do is this is an area of our will.
[time=2262] See this is interesting.
[time=2263] This is our life.
[time=2264] To intellect the emotions, our social relationships, and the will, the way we handle that in finances,
[time=2271] that's our soul.
[time=2272] You add the spirit, our vertical connection to God, and that's our heart, and you add the body, the very trim fit body, and you got life, how it's lived out, the skin on the
[time=2285] human heart.
[time=2286] Here's what we do and how we build the cistern to stop the flow of the Holy Spirit in our
[time=2293] financial world.
[time=2296] We say give God 10%.
[time=2303] What?
[time=2304] Five percent.
[time=2305] What do you mean?
[time=2306] Well, my annual income is well into six figures.
[time=2309] My five percent is more than most people's ten percent, and probably more than a pipe boy makes in a year.
[time=2316] Okay.
[time=2317] Well, there's one way to look at it.
[time=2321] We give God five or ten, but God has intended something totally different.
[time=2328] God's intended that we give Him 100% of our resources, 100% of our time, of our talent,
[time=2337] of our treasures, releasing the Holy Spirit in our lives and giving all of it to God.
[time=2347] Let's look at what Deuteronomy 8 says, verses 11 through 18.
[time=2351] God's designed something differently, and He warned us.
[time=2354] Be careful that you do not forget the Lord your God, failing to observe His commands, His laws and His decrees that I'm giving you this day.
[time=2361] Otherwise, when you eat and are satisfied, when you build fine houses and settle down,
[time=2367] and when your herds and flocks grow large, and your silver and gold increase, and all you have is multiplied, then your heart will become proud, and you will forget the Lord
[time=2377] your God, because you heart became proud, and you created a cistern.
[time=2387] And He brought you out of Egypt and out of the land of slavery.
[time=2390] He led you through the vast and dreadful desert, that thirsty and waterless land with its venomous stakes and scorpions.
[time=2397] He brought you water out of hard rock, and He did bring physical water.
[time=2403] He was the source, Paul writes in 1 Corinthians 10, 4, that Jesus was the spiritual rock with
[time=2410] the spiritual water in the desert.
[time=2413] He gave humanity to eat in the desert, something your fathers had never known, to humble and to test you so that in the end, it might go well with you.
[time=2423] You may say to yourself, "My power and the strength of my hands have produced this wealth
[time=2429] for me.
[time=2430] I've said it." Remember the Lord your God, for it is He who gives you the ability to produce wealth, and so confirms His covenant, which He swore to your forefathers as it is today.
[time=2440] When I made a lot of money, and I was building a cistern, and I had my own goals, I said, "Look what I did." When I lost a lot of money, I said, "Look what I did." I changed, and I started to see it as a flow of the Holy Spirit, and God could handle the resources, however He wanted to, my part was to surrender my heart to Him, including my
[time=2463] financial decisions, and I began to say, "Look what God did."
[time=2469] It's a radical transformation.
[time=2474] Look what Deuteronomy 15 says, "If there's a poor man among your brothers in any of the
[time=2481] towns of the land that the Lord your God is giving you, do not be hard-hearted.
[time=2486] Don't build a cistern." See, they were made with stone, and in Palestine, flowing water, flowing water was rare, but
[time=2497] when you found a spring that meant life, that meant life for your cattle, that meant life for your sheep, that meant life for you to drink, that meant water for your pastures.
[time=2508] But cisterns, they would take the roof water and they'd try to funnel it into stone hard,
[time=2514] and they would plaster it with lime plaster, and it would crack, and it would break, and that's the picture.
[time=2519] And there's this picture all throughout the Bible that we harden our heart when we compartmentalize our lives, just like this.
[time=2525] Do not be hard-hearted or tight-fisted toward your poor brother.
[time=2530] Look what it says, "Rather be open-handed and freely lend him whatever he needs, because
[time=2536] your source and my source is a spring of living water.
[time=2541] That's the Holy Spirit, and he will never go dry." My people have committed two sins.
[time=2550] They have forsaken me.
[time=2552] They have forsaken me, the spring of living water, and they built five cisterns, cisterns
[time=2558] that don't hold water, physical, mental, social, financial.
[time=2562] What would it look like?
[time=2564] What would it look like in your life if you would release the Holy Spirit in your finances?
[time=2569] If you honored God with your car, if you honored God with your house, maybe how you act in
[time=2576] your car, and who you invite in it, and what you say, and how you listen.
[time=2580] Same thing in your home.
[time=2581] Maybe you need to open your home to a small group.
[time=2583] What would it look like if you honored God with 100% of your time, talent, and treasures?
[time=2590] Well, finally, we built a spiritual cistern, a spiritual cistern.
[time=2596] We've compartmentalized God.
[time=2599] And you might say, "Well, how do we do that?" Actually, this one's the easiest one of all, because we limit God in this cistern to a building,
[time=2612] to an hour a week, to a quiet time, to an ABF, to a Bible study, to a small group, and
[time=2624] we kind of take control back of the other 167 hours of the week.
[time=2631] And man has been doing it with legalistic religion since the first sin.
[time=2636] And God did not intend it to be that way.
[time=2641] Look at Deuteronomy 6, 4 through 9, devout Jews would recite this twice a day.
[time=2646] Now, look at this, "Hero Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.
[time=2652] Love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your
[time=2660] strength, no sisters.
[time=2664] These commandments that I give you today are to be upon your hearts.
[time=2669] Impress them on your children.
[time=2671] Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up.
[time=2677] Apply them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads.
[time=2682] They'd recite it twice a day.
[time=2685] So I took the challenge.
[time=2687] I memorized it, and I'm not doing well at reciting it twice a day, but I checked myself and you might want to do this, to take this cistern and release the Holy Spirit in your
[time=2698] spiritual life to give God every moment, recognizing that every act is a spiritual one.
[time=2707] You might want to memorize this, and you might want to recite it twice a day because God
[time=2714] is not made to be compartmentalized.
[time=2720] When we say we believe, when we say we believe, something unique happens, and it's the way
[time=2729] God designed it.
[time=2734] We've committed two sins.
[time=2741] We forsaken the spring of living water, and we've dug for ourselves cisterns, five cisterns,
[time=2747] we've compartmentalized our lives, and we've dammed the flow of the Holy Spirit in each one of them, hardening our hearts, becoming God little g in that area of our lives, and we've done it with a physical sister, we've done it with a mental system, we've done it with social and our relationships, we've done it financially and we've built a cistern spiritually.
[time=2767] What would it look like if in 2005 you would release the Holy Spirit in your life physically?
[time=2772] Do the worship CD, the worship DVD, read the Bible when you lift weights, be thankful when you eat.
[time=2778] What would it look like if mentally if your thoughts were taken and made them obedient
[time=2784] to Christ because you read the Bible or you memorize Scripture?
[time=2787] What would it look like if you released the Holy Spirit in your relationships and every time you go out and every time you shop, you can release the Holy Spirit because every encounter with another human being is a chance to release the Holy Spirit.
[time=2802] What would that look like?
[time=2803] What would it look like if financially you gave all your time, all your talents, all your treasures to God and honored Him and released the Holy Spirit in your career and in your
[time=2813] financial decisions, the way you treat your employees, the way you work with your vendors, the way you pay bills on time, the way you make transactions.
[time=2821] What would that look like for you?
[time=2824] In church, what would it look like spiritually if we would release the Holy Spirit in 168 hours
[time=2830] of our lives and fully surrender all to Him recognizing that every act is a spiritual
[time=2836] one.
[time=2837] What would God do?
[time=2838] I want to show you, I'm asking them to come up each one of you and pour your water back
[time=2845] in the picture.
[time=2848] We're going to look at something Jesus said and this is what He's designed and I want
[time=2854] to set the scene for you.
[time=2856] Jesus says this and we're going to look at it at the last feast of the year and He's
[time=2865] in the temple and there are a lot of people there probably closer to 500,000 than 2,000
[time=2875] back on this campus today, closer to the size of the crowd at the Indianapolis 500 versus
[time=2881] here.
[time=2882] What would happen at the Feast of Tabernacles is the priest would lead each day for seven
[time=2888] days, the people out to their source of water, the Gion spring, and they'd come through the
[time=2895] water gate and they'd take a picture, a gold picture of water that they had and they'd pour it on the altar, commemorating what we talked about, God leading and being the spiritual
[time=2912] drink and giving them physical water for the Israelites through the Exodus and they would
[time=2918] pray for autumn rains for their crops and they'd carry a branch, the people would carry a branch
[time=2925] in one hand being indicative, a tree branch of the tabernacles or the booze that were built in the desert when the Israelites, two and a half million of them were in the wilderness and they'd carry a citrus branch, recognizing, giving God the credit for all of life, for the harvest as well.
[time=2942] Now on the seventh day they did it seven times, seven times and so they'd go out to the spring,
[time=2950] they'd bring the picture of water, they'd sing, they'd sing from Isaiah and they'd go out and they'd do it again seven times and on the seventh time here's what happened and remember it's a huge crowd of people, it's John 7, John 737 I think that's where
[time=2964] we're going to start, and Jesus on the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood
[time=2971] and said in a loud voice, "If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink, whoever believes
[time=2981] in me, whoever fully surrenders his entire life to me," as the Scripture has said, "streams
[time=2988] of living water will flow from the core of his being, from his belly, from his heart."
[time=2996] By this he met the Spirit, the Spirit whom those who believed, who fully surrendered
[time=3003] their lives to him, who those who believed in him were later to receive.
[time=3007] Not to that time the Spirit had not been given since Jesus had not yet been glorified.
[time=3013] Dead, buried, resurrected, ascended into heaven and providing his Spirit to live through
[time=3025] those who fully surrendered their lives to him.
[time=3030] God didn't intend for us to make cisterns, rather all of life is an opportunity to release
[time=3039] the flow of the Holy Spirit of our lives, to drink, to drink from the stream, the spring
[time=3047] of living water, but here's what God intends.
[time=3058] When we fully surrender our lives to Jesus Christ, He transforms the color of everything.
[time=3071] God says, "My people have committed two sins.
[time=3076] They forsaken me the spring of living water that flows and quenches your thirst, and
[time=3083] they've dug cisterns, five cisterns, five hard-hearted broken cisterns that can't hold water."
[time=3096] Jesus Christ's blood has paid the price for those sins, and when we fully surrender our
[time=3104] lives to Him, He transforms the color of everything by releasing the Holy Spirit, His
[time=3110] Spirit in us, and that changes a culture, that changes the world, that changes me, and
[time=3118] it changes you.
[time=3122] I've asked the team to come up, and we're going to sing a song.
[time=3128] What can wash away my sin?
[time=3132] What can make me whole again?
[time=3135] Nothing.
[time=3137] Nothing but the blood of Jesus, releasing the Holy Spirit in all of my life.
[time=3144] I'm going to ask you to stand, and I'd like you to join with them in singing.
[time=3151] And if you're here today, and you've never surrendered your life to Christ, you're hard-hearted.
[time=3159] You have those cisterns quite possibly, and now you see it for the first time.
[time=3164] And you're God, little G, G-O-D, you're God in your life.
[time=3169] Why not come alive in 2005 and surrender your life to Jesus Christ?
[time=3174] He's paid it all.
[time=3176] You can add nothing but a humble heart, willing to receive His grace.
[time=3182] But people who have come in here today as fully surrendered to Christ, and you've compartmentalized
[time=3190] your life.
[time=3191] You have to come back, control in certain areas as we sing this song.
[time=3194] Surrender that back to the flow of the Holy Spirit in your life, align God and His Spirit in all of life as you sing this song.
[time=3208] Your blood speaks a better word than all the empty claims I've heard upon this earth,
[time=3227] speaks righteousness for me, and stands in my defense, Jesus, it's your blood.
[time=3242] Your blood speaks a better word than all the empty claims I've heard upon this earth,
[time=3253] speaks righteousness for me, and stands in my defense, Jesus, it's your blood.
[time=3264] Please sing with us.
[time=3288] Jesus, what can wash us pure and snow will come as the friends of God?
[time=3305] It's nothing that's your blood, nothing that's your blood, Jesus.
[time=3324] Your cross testifies in grace, tells of the Father's heart to make a way for us.
[time=3335] Only we approach, not earthly confidence, it's only by your blood, what can wash, what
[time=3351] can wash away our sins, what can make us whole again, nothing but God.
[time=3365] Nothing but the blood of Jesus, what can wash us pure and snow will come as the friends
[time=3386] of God, it's nothing but your blood, nothing but your blood, King Jesus.
[time=3401] What can wash away our sins, what can make us whole again, nothing but the blood of
[time=3415] Jesus, what can wash us pure and snow will come as the friends of God, nothing but your
[time=3441] blood, nothing but your blood, King Jesus.
[time=3459] See that prophecy has been fulfilled, Jesus is the temple and his spirit is flowing to
[time=3476] anyone who would come to him and fully surrender his life and receive that forgiveness and
[time=3483] let him be Lord of your life, it's free.
[time=3487] The spirit is flowing in church in 2005, let's be a church who releases the Holy Spirit
[time=3498] in all of our lives and see what God does.
[time=3504] Let's pray and God may each person here in his or her heart surrender the hardness of
[time=3511] heart, the cisterns and the compartmentalization of you and may by the blood of Christ, may
[time=3519] we be with our bodies the temple of the Holy Spirit, may we take every thought captive
[time=3526] and obedient to you, may we love self-sacrificially because you loved us first, may we surrender
[time=3533] all of our time talents and treasures to you and may every act be a spiritual one, release
[time=3540] the Holy Spirit in our lives.
[time=3542] In Jesus' name we pray and all God's people agreed and said amen.
[time=3570] [AMEN - 36 seconds]
